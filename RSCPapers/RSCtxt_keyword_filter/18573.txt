    , Accepted 31st August 2022First published on 31st August 2022AbstractTandem solar cells based on perovskites have been gaining ever-increasing attention for applications in photovoltaics. Here, we stack the wide-bandgap CsPbI3 top subcell with the low-bandgap Kesterite Cu2ZnSnSxSe(4−x) (CZTSSe) bottom subcell mechanically to form a four-terminal tandem solar cell. The thickness of the CsPbI3 and CZTSSe layers, as well as the thickness of ZnO/ZnS and Spiro-OMeTAD layers are optimized to achieve significantly improved absorption, thereby reducing reflection loss and parasitic absorption. The doping concentration on CsPbI3 and CZTSSe is investigated to equalize open-circuit voltage and short-circuit current. The energy band-bending and built-in electrical field correlated with carrier separation are discussed. The simulated four-terminal CsPbI3/CZTSSe tandem solar cell affords a summed PCE of 32.35%. The study of the CsPbI3/CZTSSe tandem solar cell provides a promising reference for designing high-performance devices.
1. Introduction
Halide perovskites are promising optoelectronic materials with excellent properties such as high absorption coefficients, tunable band gaps, and long carrier diffusion lengths.1 All-organic CsPbI3 and triple-cation hybrid-halide lead-based perovskite shows a suitable band gap as the absorber layer for solar cells; considering the structural stability, the crystal structure of CsPbI3 changes from the cubic phase to the orthorhombic phase at room temperature. The crystal structure of MAPbI3−xBrx and organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites is more stable than that of CsPbI3. However, the perovskites with mixed halide compositions tend to be phase-segregated into iodide and bromide-rich phases under light illumination which were reported in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3, (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 and CsPb(I1−xBrx)3 films.2,3 Organic cations such as CH(NH2)2 and CH3NH3 are unstable for organic-inorganic hybrid perovskites and easily interact with oxygen and moisture resulting in compromised chemical stability. Organic molecules in perovskites can be decomposed. When hydrogen atom loss occurs, the resulting “vacancy” will greatly reduce the efficiency. Therefore, the existence of molecules causes damage to the overall efficiency of materials, further impacting the hygroscopic and volatile nature of the solar cells. However, CsPbI3 perovskites can deliberately avoid phase segregation that often occurs in mixed-halide perovskites, leading to its outstanding photostability. In addition, a high temperature cubic structure is achieved at 634 K for CsPbI3. The temperature at which this phase transition occurs already proves that this inorganic alkali halide perovskite can withstand much higher temperatures than its hybrid organic–inorganic counterpart. Studies indicate that the stability of PSCs can be enhanced by replacing the hybrid organic–inorganic absorber layer with an inorganic halide perovskite layer, without compromising the photovoltaic performance of the device.4 Researchers have synthesized highly stable black phase CsPbI3 at room temperature under ambient conditions,5 which improves the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all-inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Over the past decade, the PCE of PSCs has reached record levels, rapidly increasing from 3.13%4 to 25.8%.6,7 However, PSCs still have lower PCE due to the Shockley–Queisser (S–Q) limit,8 like other single-junction solar cells. Perovskite-based tandem solar cells (TSCs) represent an exciting possibility for a breakthrough in photovoltaics, enhancing the PCE of TSCs beyond the S–Q limit while maintaining low production cost. TSCs can be formed by combining a top subcell with a bottom subcell using a two- or four-terminal (2T or 4T) configuration. Compared to the 2T configuration, the 4T setup (mechanically stacked top and bottom subcell) has a slightly higher theoretical efficiency, because the 4T setup requires no current matching between the two subcells. The top subcell has a wide bandgap (Eg ≈ 1.5–2.2 eV) and absorbs short wavelength solar energy. Correspondingly, the bottom subcell has a narrow bandgap (Eg ≈ 0.9–1.2 eV) and absorbs long wavelength solar energy.
According to previous reports, PSCs are chosen as the top subcell, while silicon solar cells, Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) solar cells, gallium arsenide (GaAs) solar cells, organic solar cells, or PSCs are selected as the bottom subcell.9–17 CZTSSe thin film solar cells have many advantages, such as a high light absorption coefficient and a suitable optical band gap.18 The early found CZTSSe is a great light absorber in thin film solar cells. Experiments and theory calculations show that the band gap of CZTSSe is 0.95–1.51 eV,19–21 which is suitable for the bottom subcell in 4T TSCs. Shin et al. reported a single CZTSSe solar cell in which the PCE reaches 8.9% using a TiN diffusion barrier.22 Wang et al. obtained a total-area CZTSSe solar cell of 12.6% PCE by configuring the interfacial energy band structure.23 Li et al. demonstrated that the PCE reaches 16.1% for a reflective 4T perovskite/CZTSSe TSC.24 Besides, this solution process and the reflective tandem configuration could dramatically reduce the material cost. Very recently, Wang et al. reported a PCE of 22.27% for 4T perovskite/CZTSSe TSC by coupling a semitransparent PSC with a 1.1 eV CZTSSe bottom subcell.25
Research studies have shown that state-of-art perovskite TSCs have advantages of a high record PCE of 29.1%, high VOC, good indoor performance, and covering a wide spectral range, which enable their use for unique applications in addition to the dominant common applications in PV plants when combined with the commercial Si modules, which must meet the 25 year application requirement. Additionally, the fabrication of perovskite TSCs is in a mature industrial line. In order to realize a low initial investment, less modification of the already existing industrial lines for other subcell modules as possible is the most feasible and promising technology. For this purpose, the fabrication of tandem modules may be the most feasible and rapid way to accelerate their commercialization at the current stage.26–28
Here, we design efficient 4T all-inorganic tandem solar cells by mechanically stacking a 1.73 eV wide-Eg CsPbI3 top subcell with a 1.13 eV low-Eg CZTSSe bottom subcell. In a 4T tandem solar cell, ZnO/ZnS is used as an electron transport layer (ETL) since the ZnS interlayer has proven to be an effective ETL for high-performance solar cells.29 The simulation results show that the ZnO/ZnS ETL significantly improved the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and the PCE of the 4T tandem solar cell in this study. The optimal thickness of the ZnO/ZnS and Spiro-OMeTAD layers are obtained. At the same time, the effects and mechanisms of the doping concentration on the PCE and VOC are analyzed by energy bands and the photogeneration rate. Our work can provide important guidance for device design and optimization from the considerations of theory.
2. Results and discussion
The structure diagram of the 4T TSC used for device simulation and the energy diagram and energy band-bending are shown in Fig. 1a and b. This simulation is conducted with a front contact of indium tin oxide (ITO) having a work function of 4.5 eV, an electron transport layer (ETL) of n-type zinc oxide (ZnO/ZnS), a hole transport layer (HTL) of Spiro-OMeTAD, and a back contact of molybdenum (Mo) with a work function of 4.6 eV.33 Orthorhombic CsPbI3 perovskite and CZTSSe are taken as the absorber layers of the top and bottom subcells, respectively. The high dielectric constant of the perovskite and CZTSSe structures allows incident photons to readily dissociate into free charge carriers. As electrons and holes are generated, they drift and diffuse through the absorber layer and transport layers. These charges are ultimately collected by the electrodes at the back and front contacts of the cells. For the whole tandem cell, the incident light comes from the ITO/ZnO side of the PSC, and photons with higher energy are absorbed by the top subcell, while lower energy photons pass through the top CsPbI3 subcell and are absorbed by the CZTSSe bottom subcell. The key simulation parameters that are used in the simulation are summarized in Table 1. All parameters are taken as the input parameters of the simulation and calculated by the analytical method to ensure that the correct electrical characteristics of the device can be obtained in the experiment. In this study, the extinction coefficient and refractive index of all the materials are determined from the literature, ref. 30–38. The complete modelling of the 4T TSC device is done using COMSOL Multiphysics with key inputs from all layers, and the detailed computation method is presented in the ESI.†

The current–voltage (J–V) curves of the CsPbI3 top subcell, CZTSSe bottom subcell and stand-alone CZTSSe cell are shown in Fig. 1c. The stand-alone CZTSSe solar cell exhibits a PCE of 24.76%, with a JSC of 40.39 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.72 V and an FF of 87% (Table 2). As shown in Fig. 1f, the value of the total photo-generation rate (Gtot) of the top CsPbI3 subcell is higher than that of the bottom CZTSSe subcell. The value of Gtot of the stand-alone CZTSSe solar cell is one order of magnitude higher than that of the bottom CZTSSe subcell (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Consequently, the combined CsPbI3 top subcell and filtered CZTSSe bottom subcell afford a summed PCE of 32.35% in the 4T CsPbI3/CZTSSe TSC. The corresponding device parameters are summarized in Table 2.

From Fig. 1d, the PSC and CZTSSe subcells have main absorption ranges of 350–700 nm and 600–1200 nm, respectively. Although the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of a single CZTSSe solar cell has an absorption spectrum range from 350 to 1200 nm (Fig. 1d, green curve), the EQE of the top PSC subcell improves and then decreases obviously after the overlapping absorption spectra for two subcells in 4T CsPbI3/CZTSSe TSC. The perovskite has difficulties absorbing incident light with wavelengths greater than 700 nm, according to the results. It has been reported that Gtot has a high peak at the CZTSSe side of the interface since CZTSSe has a higher absorption compared to CdS.33 CdS has a larger bandgap and is able to absorb high-energy photons which are not absorbed by CZTSSe layers and photons that exceed the bandgap of CdS. Fig. 1f shows the same high peak at the interface of ZnS/CsPbI3, and the bandgap of ETL is also wider than CsPbI3 (the energy band diagrams can be seen in Fig. 1b). An electric field accelerates the transfer of electrons, especially in the ETL and perovskite layers. The band alignment plays a critical role in heterostructures. As shown in Fig. 1e and Fig. S10 (ESI†), the middle interlayer ZnS couples with ZnO to form a type-I band alignment. Although the simulation results are different from the assumption, according to the known experimental data, such as Table 1, we can clearly judge that they are type-II heterojunction alignment, and the research shows that the energy difference less than 1 eV will not effectively limit the movement of electron holes. ZnO/ZnS/CsPbI3 and CdS/CZTSSe heterojunctions can be thought of as type-II band alignments, and the cascade ETL provides a favorable stepped channel for the transfer of carriers.
The perovskite layers in PSCs, although they are lightly doped into n- and p-types, are treated as intrinsic (i) layers in the literature. An et al. also reported that the p-perovskite allowed better power conversion efficiency in PSCs.34 Therefore, as shown in Fig. S2–S4 (ESI†), the lightly doped (1 × 1017 cm−3) n- and p-type CsPbI3 are studied. In the ESI,† we supplement Fig. S2a and b (ESI†). The locations of energy band-bending are distinguished for n- and p-perovskite devices. Comparing Fig. S2a and b (ESI†), the bending lies in the region close to the HTL/n-perovskite (p-perovskite/ETL) junction for the n-perovskite (p-perovskite) system. This difference in band-bending will lead to spatially localized built-in electrical fields. The built-in electrical field F, that is, the bending region has a high F which contributes to better carrier separation under a strengthened carrier drifting effect. The simulated F profiles along the junction are illustrated in Fig. S2c (ESI†), which indicate that a large F is formed at HTL/n-perovskite (p-perovskite/ETL) interface, implying that holes (electrons) are extracted more effectively than electrons (holes) in PSCs with n-perovskite (p-perovskite). Under a strong F, the photogenerated electron–hole pairs will be separated more efficiently and accordingly the possibility of the carrier to recombine in the bulk will be decreased. However, as the light incidence is from the ETL side more carriers are generated at the top perovskite region of the PSC, that is, close to the ETL; therefore, the bulk recombination will be much higher if the high bulk recombination occurs in a similar region close to the ETL. This shows the defect of PSCs using n-type doping for the perovskite, since the bulk recombination in the high carrier concentration region is very intensive; in other words, a strong built-in electrical field at the perovskite/ETL interface is preferred, which can be realized by choosing the p-doping perovskite layer for the considered structure (namely “n–i–p” structure). Here, we would like to indicate that if the light is incident from the HTL side (namely “p–i–n” structure), n-type doping for the perovskite layer is beneficial for the same reason. In our simulation, the light incidence is from the ETL side. As is shown in Fig. S2d (ESI†), the short-circuit current density of the top cell obtained by the p-type doped perovskite is higher than that of n-type doped perovskite. We also compare the PCE and JSC for the n/p-type doped perovskite in different thicknesses of CsPbI3 (see Fig. S3a and b, ESI†). Hence, we select p-doped CsPbI3 to design high performance 4T CsPbI3/CZTSSe TSC in the next study.
In the CsPbI3 and CZTSSe absorbing layers, free charge carriers are generated through photon absorption. The performance of the device is mainly determined by the thickness, doping concentration, and other characteristics of the absorber layer since absorption is dependent on these. Since the diffusion paths of photocarriers are related to the thickness of the absorber layer, the recombination and extraction of charge carriers are also highly dependent on the thickness of the absorber layer. To investigate further the performance characteristics of 4T CsPbI3/CZTSSe TSC, the thicknesses of the top and bottom absorbing layers are optimized. We vary the thickness of the CsPbI3 and CZTSSe absorbing layers from 200 to 1000 nm, and 1 to 4 μm, respectively, while maintaining the thickness of HTL and ETL layers. The ideal thicknesses of the CsPbI3 and CZTSSe layers are 500 nm and 2 μm, respectively. Fig. 2a–c shows the variations in performance parameters of the 4T TSC and subcell with increased thickness of the absorber layer. When the absorber layer is too thick, carriers can recombine before they reach the electrodes, deteriorating device performance.

EQE for the top PSC and the bottom CZTSSe subcell with (e) different thicknesses of CsPbI3, (f) ZnO, and ZnO/ZnS ETL layers. 
In Fig. 2a, the thickness of the CZTSSe layer is 2 μm, while the thickness of CsPbI3 increased from 200 to 1000 nm. Thus, the top subcell PCE shows a steady upward trend, while the bottom subcell PCE shows a steady downward trend. Meanwhile, the 4T TSC PCE demonstrates an upward trend and declines as the CsPbI3 thickness approaches 900 nm. We simulated the JSC and EQE of both subcells in order to investigate the cause of this phenomenon. Fig. 2b and e indicate that the trend of PCE mainly originates from JSC. Therefore, three thicknesses of 200, 400, and 1000 nm of CsPbI3 are studied. The main absorption spectrum is observed in Fig. 2e for the PSC top subcell between 350 and 700 nm, and 600–1200 nm for the CZTSSe bottom subcell. With an increase in the CsPbI3 thickness from 200 to 400 nm, the EQE of the top subcells at 500–700 nm increased. Accordingly, at the overlap of absorption spectra of the two subcells, the EQE of the top subcell decreases significantly. Simultaneously, the EQE in the 800–1000 nm wavelength range of the bottom subcell declined evidently, indicating that CsPbI3 at a thickness of 1000 nm has less red and IR reflection loss. CsPbI3 absorbs short-wavelength light almost immediately without reflection. Nearly no fluctuations are observed in the short-wavelength EQE of CsPbI3. A CsPbI3 thickness of 200 nm results in a low JSC and PCE in the CZTSSe bottom subcell. For this reason, selecting the appropriate thickness of CsPbI3 is necessary in order to increase the total photon absorption of tandem solar cells. Fig. 2c shows that the thickness of CsPbI3 is maintained at 500 nm, and the CZTSSe is increased from 2 μm to 4 μm. The results show that the increase in the CZTSSe thickness has a very small effect on the top PSC PCE. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), we also studied the PCE of top PSCs, bottom CZTSSe and 4T solar cells when the thickness of CsPbI3 was 600 nm, 700 nm and 800 nm respectively, and the thickness of CZTSSe varied from 1 μm to 4 μm. When the thickness of CsPbI3 is 600 nm, the blue polyline first shows an increasing trend, then decreasing and then increasing. Since the thickness of CZTSSe is variable, the change in the trend of PCE of the bottom CZTSSe solar cell is consistent with that of 4T total PCE. In combination with the data in Table S3 (ESI†), we found that the simulated PCE values at 2000 nm and 4000 nm were 0.012% different. The best 4T total PCE of 33.03% is obtained when the thickness of CZTSSe is 2000 nm. This shows that the performance of the 4T device is the best when the CsPbI3 thickness is 600 nm and the CZTSSe thickness is 2000 nm. When we increase the thickness of CsPbI3 to 700 nm, the change in the trend (the red broken line of Fig. S11, ESI†) of PCE of the 4T device is consistent with that of 600 nm. Although the maximum value of 4T PCE is 33.99% when the thickness of CZTSSe is 4000 nm, this is only 0.014% higher than 33.49% (see Table S4, ESI†). We continue to increase the thickness of CsPbI3 to 800 nm, and the 4T PCE reaches the maximum when the thickness of CZTSSe is 3000 nm. Referring to the data in Table S3 (ESI†), the difference in the 4T PCE between CZTSSe thicknesses of 2000 nm and 3000 nm is only 0.004%. We draw the EQE diagram (Fig. S12, ESI†) to discuss the change of light absorption caused by the change of CZTSSe thickness. The magenta line marks the bandgap extracted from the inflection of the EQE curve. As shown in Fig. S12a and b (ESI†), when the thickness of CZTSSe is 2000 nm, the light absorption intensity of the bottom solar cell is the largest. However, from Fig. S12c (ESI†), when the thickness of CsPbI3 is 800 nm, we can see that with the increase of CZTSSe thickness, the light absorption of the bottom cell remains almost unchanged, indicating that the light absorption of the top PSCs has reached saturation. Research studies have also shown that a layer thickness of 1–2 μm is generally enough to absorb most of the incident solar radiation because of the direct band gap. Therefore, if we choose 2000 nm as the thickness of CZTSSe, when CsPbI3 is 700 nm, the optimal total PCE of a 4T device is 33.49%, which is only 0.034% higher than that of 500 nm. So we chose to use a thinner thickness of 500 nm to construct the device.
As shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S4 (ESI†), we study the tendency of PCE versus CsPbI3 thickness of 4T CsPbI3/CZTSSe TSC (green curve) and subcells (red and blue curve) with a ZnO/ZnS double ETL and ZnS ETL, respectively. The PCE of 4T CsPbI3/CZTSSe TSC with the ZnO/ZnS double ETL is higher than the overall PCE of those with ZnO and ZnS single layer (Fig. 2a, d and Fig. S4, ESI†). Under conditions of ZnS as the ETL, the PCEs of the 4T tandem solar cell maintain a flat state after the CsPbI3 thickness increases to 400 nm. Differently, the PCE of the 4T tandem solar cell exhibits a steady improvement in the case of ZnO/ZnS as the cascade ETL. Research studies have shown that longer optical paths may increase parasitic absorption in the contact layer. In that case, we set 500 nm as the thickness of perovskite in the 4T tandem solar cell. Fig. 1f shows the Gtot of the top PSC with the ZnO/ZnS cascade ETL, which is comparable to the top PSC with the ZnO single ETL and ZnS single ETL (Fig. S6, ESI†). Fig. 2f shows the EQE of the top PSC and bottom CZTSSe subcells with two different ETLs, where the main difference is the EQE of the top PSC. For ZnO/ZnS as the ETL (Fig. 2f, blue curve), the analogous change of trend is the improvement of the EQEs for both the top PSC and the bottom subcell. Comparing Fig. S5a and b (ESI†), it is obviously observed that the EQE of the top PSC with the ZnO/ZnS ETL is better when the wavelength range is about 450 nm to 780 nm. Fig. S5d (ESI†) shows that the ZnO/ZnS device exhibited a JSC of 19.59 mA cm−2, whereas the bare ZnO device showed a JSC of 18.30 mA cm−2. COMSOL Multiphysics is used to simulate the optical field distribution in the 4T device. The transmittance spectra and intensity of |E| is given in the ESI.† Fig. S13(a) (ESI†) shows the transmittance of CsPbI3 and CZTSSe with ZnO and ZnO/ZnS ETL. On the whole, for the top PSC and the bottom CZTSSe solar cell, the transmission of ZnO/ZnS as the electron transport layer is stronger than that of ZnO as the electron transport layer. As shown in Fig. S5c (ESI†), the EQEs of top PSCs improve significantly from 350 to 565 nm when the ETL is ZnS, which is partly due to the reduction in parasitic absorption. With the support of the ZnS interlayer, slight energy is easier to transmit. Fig. S13(b) (ESI†) gives the corresponding plots of the simulated optical field distribution (|E|) as a function of the device depth. It is clear that the peak intensity of |E| varies with the depth of the device (red presents an optical field peak, and blue indicates an optical field trough). It is found that the perovskite cell shows good transmittance in the infrared range. Combined with Fig. S13(a) and (b) (ESI†), it is found that the PSCs have good transmittance in the infrared band. As we can see, for ZnO as the ETL, the intensity of |E| is stronger than that with ZnO/ZnS as the ETL, which produces parasitic absorption in the ETL and affects the absorption of the bottom solar cell. The intensity of |E| of CZTSSe is different in the case of ZnO and ZnO/ZnS as ETLs, and the transmittance is also different. Therefore, the PCE of CZTSSe is affected.
The thickness of the ETL and HTL has a significant impact on the performance of the solar cell. As shown in Fig. 3 and Tables S1, S2 (ESI†), the performance parameters are affected by ETL and HTL thicknesses. The data used in Fig. 3a–d are shown in Tables S1 and S2 in the ESI,† marked with turquoise. Fig. S7a (ESI†) first shows a decreasing trend, then increasing and then decreasing, and the inflection point is when the thickness of ZnO/ZnS is 100 nm. Therefore, the optimal thickness of the electron transport layer is 100 nm by exploring the influence of the thickness change of ZnO/ZnS on the performance of the device. Fig. 3c and d present the J–V curves of the top PSC and the bottom CZTSSe subcell. The JSC of the top subcell and bottom solar cell, respectively, reach 19.75 and 9.50 mA cm−2 when the thickness of ZnO/ZnS is 20 and 100 nm, respectively. As we can see from Fig. S14 (ESI†), the transmittance of Spiro is influenced by the thickness. In the wavelength range of 600 nm to 1100 nm, the transmittance is the highest when the Spiro thickness is 50 nm. Under other thicknesses, there is parasitic absorption in the bottom carrier transport layer of the top PSCs, that is, Spiro, and there is a certain refractive loss at the interface between the top PSCs and the bottom CZTSSe. In a perovskite tandem solar cell, the bottom carrier transport layer of the top cell may capture the absorption spectrum of the bottom cell, resulting in more complex parasitic absorption losses. In addition, when the thickness of the HTL exceeds by more than 50 nm, the PCE of the device decreases (see Fig. S7b, ESI†). This occurs because the recombination of charge carriers exceeds the charge extraction.39,40 The thickness of Spiro is set to be 50 nm. It should be noted that no matter what the ZnO/ZnS total thickness is, the thicknesses of ZnO and ZnS are equal. Actually, the trend of two EQE curves is similar when the thickness of ZnO/ZnS is 60 and 140 nm, which is shown in Fig. 3f. In general, the PCE of 4T tandem solar cell reaches 32.35% when the thickness of ZnO/ZnS is 100 nm. Similarly, we next investigate the influence of the thickness of Spiro-OMeTAD, which is shown in Fig. 3e and f. Actually, the top subcell PCE at 10 nm Spiro-OMeTAD thickness is a little higher than that at 50 nm. The top subcell PCE shows a downward trend from 50 to 130 nm while the bottom subcell shows a downward trend from 10 to 130 nm. As Fig. 3e shows, the EQE of CZTSSe shows a shift with the change of the Spiro thickness. The performance of the device could also be affected by the intensity of light or transmittance of the components. Increasing the thickness of both the ETL and HTL is likely to reduce the transmittance of the top-subcells, thereby, reducing the photovoltaic performance of the bottom-subcells. We give the transmittance spectra of the samples with different thicknesses of the ETL and HTL in Fig. S8 and S9 (ESI†). Fig. S14 (ESI†) shows the transmittance of CZTSSe in the case of different thicknesses. The shift of transmittance is corresponding to the EQE, in other words, the thickness of Spiro affects the light transmittance of CZTSSe. The bottom carrier transport layer of the top PSCs may capture the absorption spectrum of the bottom cell, resulting in more complex parasitic absorption losses. The variation in JSC and VOC of the top subcell is very small, while the variation in JSC and VOC of the bottom subcell is large.

Research studies show that many factors including the doping concentration can affect the performance of the solar cell. Fig. 4a shows the PCE of the top PSC increases continuously as the doping concentration improves. To investigate the cause of this phenomenon, the energy bands of the top PSC and bottom CZTSSe solar cell at different doping concentrations are investigated. Fig. 4d shows the energy band-bending under different doping concentrations and large energy band-bending occurs with the 1 × 1017 cm−3 doping concentration. Fig. 4e shows that the PCE of the bottom subcell increases continuously as the doping concentration improves. Fig. 4b shows that the VOC has been increasing with the improvement of the doping concentration, which is different from the JSC reaching saturation when the doping concentration increases to 1 × 1017cm−3 (Fig. 4c). The J–V performance and energy diagrams of the bottom CZTSSe subcell are shown in Fig. 4c, g and h to investigate this phenomenon. We obtain the results that an increase in doping concentration leads to a decrease in JSC and an improvement in VOC. However, the JSC tends to be saturated at 1018 cm−3 after a rapid decline. It is found that higher doping concentrations result in a more bent energy band for the CdS/CZTSSe heterojunction (see Fig. 4h), which improves the VOC to some degree. Furthermore, the energy level on the electrode is more aligned with the energy level on the anode, making it easier for the electrode to collect holes. The increased doping concentration, however, leads to a large number of defect recombination centers inside the bottom CZTSSe subcell, which decrease the JSC and increase electron and hole recombination rates. Therefore, the doping concentrations of CsPbI3 and CZTSSe are set to 1017 cm−3 and 1018 cm−3 respectively in our work.

3. Conclusion
In summary, we report a 4T tandem solar cell and perform further photoelectric investigation of the 4T CsPbI3/CZTSSe TSC in this work. The findings show that p-doped perovskite combined with a layer of electron transport forms a type-II heterojunction that is conducive to electron transfer. The suitable thickness of CsPbI3 and CZTSSe can help obtain high photon absorption. The cascade ZnO/ZnS electron transport layer provides a strong built-in electric field which facilitates the transport of carriers. The doping concentration of CsPbI3 and CZTSSe is selected to be 1017 cm−3 and 1018 cm−3 to improve VOC. Our work is of great significance for further understanding the basic physical mechanism of photovoltaics and providing a reference for the development of high-efficiency solar cells.
