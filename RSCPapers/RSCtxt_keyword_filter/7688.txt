    , Accepted 28th November 2018First published on 28th November 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been achieved with impressively dynamic improvement in power conversion efficiency (PCE), becoming the hottest topic in photovoltaics. One of the hot topics is to develop inexpensive and efficient hole transporting materials (HTMs). In the present work, we systematically investigated the impact of different atoms in the heteromerous structure on the performance of perovskite solar cells. In addition, the influence of the structural modification of the HTM molecular building blocks was also revealed. To further understand the relationship between the charge-transport properties and the structural modification, the electronic properties, reorganization energy, and hole transporting properties of a series of organic hole transporting materials were investigated using first-principles calculations combined with Marcus theory. Moreover, the orientation function μΦ (V, λ, r, θ, γ; Φ) was applied to quantitatively evaluate the overall carrier mobility of HTMs in PSCs. It is revealed that this model predicts the hole mobility of HTMs correctly. The calculated results indicate that hole transporting materials with heteroatoms and larger dimensional structures show higher hole mobility, which may significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have rapidly been developed and display great potential to replace conventional semiconductor-based solar cells. Their easy fabrication methods and high power conversion efficiencies indicate their usefulness for low-cost and large-area solar electrical energy generation in the near future. During the past few years, the power conversion efficiency of this type of solar cell has already surpassed 23.6%.1 In particular, methylammonium lead halide perovskite solar cells (CH3NH3PbX3 or MAPbX3, X = Cl, Br, and I) have attracted considerable attention.2,3 Among various device architectures, the highest efficiencies have been reported for architectures fabricated on the basis of the transparent electrode/electron-transporting material (ETM)/perovskite absorbing layer/hole-transporting material (HTM)/metallic counter electrode configuration.4 In PSCs, the hole transporting material plays an important role in facilitating hole transport from the valence band of perovskites to the back contact and impeding back electron transfer as well.5,6
Typically, the general requirements for designing an ideal HTM are as follows:7,8 (1) suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels for efficient hole transportation and electron blocking; (2) good hole transporting properties to reduce charge recombination; and (3) stability against moisture and oxygen. Most recently, small molecular HTMs, such as squaraine derivatives,9 carbazole derivatives,10–12 linear conjugated molecules,13 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) derivatives,14 oligothiophene derivatives,15 butadiene derivatives,16 a 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivative,17 triphenylamine-based derivatives,18 various thiophene derivatives,15,19 a tetrathiafulvalene derivative,20 and silafluorene derivatives,21 have been utilized in efficient PSCs owing to their excellent charge carrier transport properties. Among the many HTMs reported, amorphous Spiro-OMeTAD is an efficient and commonly used organic small molecule hole transporting material due to its good solubility in organic solvents, good film-forming performance, and matching frontier molecular orbital energies.22,23 However, the multi-step synthesis necessary for the preparation of Spiro-OMeTAD and its low hole mobility limit its practical applications. In this regard, the development of efficient and cost-effective HTMs remains a challenging and imperative task.
Recently, a low-cost spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) based organic hole transporting material, termed X60,24 was applied in DSSCs and PSCs with efficiencies of 7.3% and 19.8%, respectively. Bi and co-workers25 synthesized a new organic HTM (X59) with the spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] core substituted by 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine donor groups. The PCE of X59 is up to 19.8%, which could be competitive to that of Spiro-OMeTAD. Hua et al.26 designed fluorine-based HTMs and achieved an efficiency of 6.4% in DSSCs and 18.0% in PSCs using the material 9,9-bis(4-(bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino)phenyl)-N2,N2,N7,N7-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-9H-fluorene-2,7-diamine (HT2) as the HTM. Rakstys et al.27 investigated the impact of different atoms in the heteromerous bistricyclic aromatic ene (BAE) structure. These HTMs have a twisted three-dimensional structure, similar to that of Spiro-OMeTAD. They also show good solubility, as well as a good hole transporting ability. Spiro-type compounds have been successfully synthesized as the central bridges in small molecular HTMs to improve their good charge transporting properties, inhibit aggregation on the perovskite surface, and suppress the charge recombination.28,29 However, it is unclear how the structural modification of the HTM molecular building blocks to influence on the electrochemical properties in PSCs? Until now, few theoretical studies have been focused on these issues. Moreover, anisotropic mobility as an intrinsic property of organic materials has attracted much attention. Based on previous research,30 our group systematically investigated anisotropic hole mobilities in PSCs.31
Interested in developing high performance HTMs, we have been motivated to perform a full and accurate theoretical investigation about the relationship between the geometry of an HTM molecule and its charge-transport properties. Herein, we consider a series of spiro-structure organic hole transporting materials (Fig. 1). The electronic properties, reorganization energy, and hole transporting mobility were investigated using first-principles calculations combined with Marcus theory. Besides, the orientation function μΦ (V, λ, r, θ, γ; Φ) was applied to quantitatively evaluate the overall carrier mobility of HTMs in PSCs. The theoretically calculated results indicate that this model predicts the hole mobility of HTMs correctly. We found that larger three-dimensional molecular structures can significantly improve the hole mobility of HTMs. Besides, introduction of heteroatoms is beneficial to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. We are expected to gain insight into the hole transport properties for rational design of efficient hole transporting materials.

Computational methods
Theoretical background
In this work, Marcus theory is used to describe the charge transport behavior.32,33 The hopping model is preferred for predicting hole mobility under ambient conditions. The charge hopping rate (k) can be expressed as  where |V| is the electronic coupling between adjacent molecules in the crystal structure, λ is the reorganization energy which is computed by the adiabatic potential energy surface method,34,35h is the Planck constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. In our work, only internal reorganization energy is considered. The reorganization energy can be expressed as follows:36λ = (E0* − E0) + (E+* − E+)where E+* and E0* represent the total energies of the cationic and neutral species with the geometries of the neutral and cationic species, respectively. E+ and E0 are the total energies of the cationic and neutral molecules in their lowest energy geometries, respectively.
Furthermore, site energies (HRR and HPP), spatial overlap (SRP) and charge transfer integrals (JRP) for one dimer are the essential parameters of electronic coupling,37 as shown in the following equation:  
Based on the Einstein relation, the drift mobilities for hole transport of the investigated molecules can be calculated in organic semiconductors:38  where n represents the spatial dimensionality, i is a selected hopping pathway, ri is the charge hopping centroid to centroid distance, and ki denotes the charge hopping rate. Pi is the hopping probability, which can be expressed as  
The equation of angular resolution anisotropic mobility can be described as follows:  where ri, γi, and θi represent the intermolecular packing parameters in the organic crystals. γi is the angle of the hopping pathway relative to the transport plane of the organic crystal molecular stacking layer, θi and Φ are defined as the orientation angles of the projected electronic coupling pathways of different dimer types and the conducting channel relative to the same reference axis (commonly using the crystallographic axis), respectively. Thus, the angle between the different pathways and the conducting channel is (θi − Φ). For the hopping pathways on the basal transport stacking layer, the values of γi are 0°.
Computational details
A series of hybrid functionals including BMK, B3LYP, PBE0, M06, and M06-2X together with different basis sets were used to optimize the ground-state (S0) geometry of the model molecule X60. The calculated results indicate that the HOMO energy of molecule X60 computed at the BMK/6-31G(d) level agrees well with the experimental value (listed in Table S1, ESI†). Accordingly, the structures of all the molecules in their neutral and charged states were optimized with the BMK functional and the 6-31G(d) basis set. All the optimized geometries show no imaginary frequency, which guarantees the local minimum of the potential energy surface. The conductor-like polarizable continuum model (C-PCM) (in a dichloromethane environment) was also taken into consideration.39 All the calculations in the present work were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.40
Moreover, the molecular crystal structure was predicted using the Polymorph module of the software package Materials Studio 8.0 based on the optimized geometry.41 The Dreiding force field was used for the prediction.42 Then, we selected the center molecule in the crystal as the carrier donor and took all its neighboring unduplicated molecules as dimers. All the electronic coupling calculations in different molecular dimers were performed with the PW91/TZP method using the Amsterdam Density Functional (ADF) package.43 Then, the angular resolution anisotropic mobilities can be obtained by relating the crystal packing and electron coupling V to the outer measuring channel angle Φ.
Results and discussion
Geometrical structures and electronic properties
The optimized structural conformations of the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). We can find that all the molecules exhibit highly twisted nonplanar molecular structures in PSCs, and the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of the HTMs are associated with the power conversion efficiency of PSCs. In particular, good delocalization of the HOMO is favorable for hole transport, and the high hole mobility of the HTMs plays an important role in increasing the performance of the solar cells.44 The highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) of the molecules are investigated and depicted in Fig. 2. The FMOs of all the molecules have similar distribution patterns due to the similar electronic and geometric structures of the molecules. The HOMOs are delocalized throughout the central fluorene core and the terminal diphenylamine groups, whereas the LUMOs are mainly located on the central fluorene core segment. Hence, sufficient orbital overlap between the HOMOs and LUMOs indicates that all the molecules have good hole transport performance, making them potential hole transport materials.

In PSCs, the HOMO level of the HTM is also a key factor in determining the open-circuit voltage of the solar cells, which is relative to the difference between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the HOMO energy level of the HTM. A deeper HOMO level offers a higher open-circuit voltage. For HTMs, their HOMO level should be higher than the valence band of the perovskite. The LUMO level should be higher than the conduction band of the perovskite to block the electron transportation from the perovskite to the metal electrodes. Traditionally, mesoporous TiO2 is the most widely used electron transporting material in PSCs, with a conduction band minimum of 4.0 eV. Fig. 3 and Table S2 (ESI†) illustrate the energy levels of the HOMOs.
 Fig. 3  Energy level diagram of the corresponding materials used in perovskite solar cells. 
In our work, the LUMO energy level can be calculated from the following expression: LUMO = HOMO + E, where E is the first excitation energy (listed in Table S3, ESI†). Obviously, all the investigated molecules have almost similar HOMO values, which are all well matched with that of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV). Meanwhile, the corresponding LUMO levels are much higher than the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3 (−3.93 eV). Therefore, a higher open-circuit voltage can be obtained and the backflow of electrons can also be effectively blocked for all the molecules being used as HTMs. Overall, the HTMs with more extended three-dimensional molecular structures and higher degrees of conjugation can enhance the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. Note that in the present work we do not calculate one of the important factors determining the performance of PSCs, the interfacial electron transfer (IET), which will be affected by the large dipole appearing at the metal interface.45
Reorganization energy and hole mobility
In general, at room temperature, the charge transport properties of these materials are determined by the hopping model. The charge hopping rate depends on two microscopic parameters: the reorganization energy and the effective electronic coupling. The charge mobility can be improved by optimizing these parameters.46 Herein, the reorganization energy can be divided into two parts: external reorganization energy (λext) and internal reorganization energy (λint). λint is a measure of structural change between ionic and neutral states.47λext represents the effect of polarized medium on charge transfer. For most amorphous organic solids, λext is small and often neglected (λ ≈ λint).48 Therefore, we mainly study the λint of the isolated organic π-conjugated systems, ignoring the environmental changes and relaxation. In this work, λ was obtained by calculating the optimized geometries in the neutral and cationic states at the BMK/6-31G(d) level and the related results are presented in Table 1. The λ values of all the investigated molecules (X60, X59, ST2, ST, HT2 and HT) are 0.306, 0.273, 0.321, 0.271, 0.339 and 0.283 eV, respectively. According to the calculated reorganization energies, the hole mobilities of the molecules can be obtained using the Einstein relation.

Besides, hole mobility is a significant parameter to assess the potential usability of new HTMs in PSC applications. Previous studies49 have pointed out that faster hole mobility is responsible for the larger short-circuit current densities and higher fill factors of PSCs. Therefore, obtaining reliable hole mobility is a significant step towards developing efficient HTMs. The crystal structure data are essential for the calculation. The crystal structures of molecules X60, X59 and HT2 are extracted from the Cambridge Structural Database. The molecular crystal structures of ST2, ST and HT were predicted using the Polymorph module of the Materials Studio software package. Han and coworkers37 certified the reliability of the predicted crystal structures. The crystal structures of all the molecules with the lowest total energies and the corresponding lattice parameters are presented in Table S4 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). Based on the predicted crystal structures, one molecule was arbitrarily chosen as the center for the charge transport, and neighboring molecules can be characterized as transverse dimers (T), parallel dimers (P), and longitudinal dimers (L). The most important four dimers are shown in Fig. 4. The angles between the hopping pathways of the P, T1, T2, and T3 dimer types and the reference axis are marked, which are labeled θP, θT1, θT2, and θT3, respectively. The orientation angle of the conducting channel relative to the reference axis is Φ.
 Fig. 4  Main hole-hopping pathways selected based on the crystalline structures for all the molecules. 
The centroid to centroid distances (ri, Å), electronic couplings (|V|, eV), hole hopping rates (kij, s−1), and hole mobilities (μΦ, cm2 V−1 s−1) of the hopping pathways selected based on the crystalline structures are listed in Table 2. For molecules X60 and X59, the reference axis is set as the crystallographic a axis, and the orientation angle of the conducting channel relative to the reference a axis is Φ. The hopping pathways of the P, T1, T2, and T3 dimer types are exactly on the a–b plane. We can observe that the predicted maximum hole mobilities of the model molecules agree well with experimental data. From Table 2, the hole mobility of molecule X60 (1.38 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) is larger than that of X59 (3.30 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Likewise, the hole mobilities of molecule HT2 (1.15 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and ST2 (1.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) are larger than those of HT (2.50 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and ST (4.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), respectively. The introduction of bulky bis(methoxyphenyl)amine units may significantly suppress charge recombination and improve hole extraction. Previous research of first-principles simulations on the Spiro-OMeTAD interface with MAPbI3 revealed that the HTM/perovskite interaction occurred mainly between the HTM methoxy groups and the perovskite methylammonium sites.50,51 Bulky bis(methoxyphenyl)amine groups render a stronger adhesion and enhanced interfacial coupling between HTMs and perovskites. Moreover, six-membered O/S-bridged rings can enhance the intramolecularly overcrowded dipolar aromatic “push–pull” system, having great potential to show high charge-carrier mobility. In particular, replacement of the oxygen atom by sulfur showed an improved hole mobility most likely due to the improved interface between the perovskite and HTM caused by stronger Pb–S interaction. Thus, the design of new HTMs with a more extended three-dimensional molecular structure and the introduction of heteroatoms will improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. It is worth noting that to accurately calculate the charge transport parameters the variation of the molecular structure with temperature should also be considered.52

Solubility and stability
Commonly, solubility and stability should be considered in the use of HTMs for PSC applications. The solution process at low temperature is an efficient approach to reduce the processing cost. Thus, good solubility becomes an essential requirement for the HTMs. The solubility of the material can be predicted using solvation free energy (ΔGsolv). The solvation free energy is defined by the following relation:53,54 ΔGsolv = Gsol − Ggas, and relevant data are shown in Table 3. The negative solvation free energy indicates that the solution process is a spontaneous process for these potential HTMs. Moreover, the solvation free energies for X60, ST2 and HT2 are more negative than those of X59, ST and HT, leading to better solubility. The reason can be their larger three-dimensional molecular structures and the introduction of bis(methoxyphenyl)amine groups.

Stability is also a vital factor deserving to be considered. PSCs would deteriorate quickly even under low humidity conditions because of the extreme solubility of CH3NH3PbI3. It has been tested that the HTM also plays a vital role in controlling the stability of PSCs. The stability can be evaluated by the absolute hardness (η), which is defined as55η = (IP − EA)/2, where IP signifies the adiabatic ionization potential and EA denotes the adiabatic electron affinity. From Table 3, the calculated absolute hardness values of all the molecules (X60, X59, ST2, ST, HT2 and HT) are 2.53, 2.54, 2.46, 2.56, 2.49, and 2.53 eV, respectively. All the molecules have similar values for hardness, which imply that they have similar stabilities.
Importantly, the electrostatic surface potential (ESP) is used to further explore the isolated molecular stability.56 The ESPs of all the investigated molecules are shown in Fig. 5. The green color represents the neutral region, whereas the red and blue colors represent negative charge and positive charge regions, respectively. The positive charge is mostly located on hydrogen atoms and benzene rings, while oxygen and nitrogen atoms are more negatively charged owing to their strong electron withdrawing ability. The stronger electron donating bis(methoxyphenyl)amine units impart negative charge on most of the carbon atoms. More negative charges on the molecule make the oxidation easier, thereby decreasing the molecular stability. Therefore, the stabilities of X60, ST2 and HT2 are slightly smaller than those of X59, ST and HT, respectively. These results are in well agreement with the absolute hardness.

Conclusion
In summary, we theoretically investigated a series of spiro-type molecules to further understand the relationship between the charge-transport properties and the structural modification of the materials. The computational results presented here employ quantum-chemistry combined with Marcus theory to shed light on the electronic structures, reorganization energies, and hole mobilities of the studied HTMs. The solubility and stability of all the molecules were also evaluated. These HTMs with a twisted three-dimensional structure show good solubility, as well as a good hole transporting ability. Moreover, the orientation function μΦ (V, λ, r, θ, γ; Φ) was applied to quantitatively evaluate the overall carrier mobility of HTMs in PSCs. It is revealed that this model predicts the anisotropic hole mobility of HTMs correctly. The present results indicate that the introduction of larger three-dimensional molecular structures and O/S heteroatoms can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. It is hoped that this method can provide theoretical guidance for the further development of molecular HTMs for perovskite solar cells.
