    , Accepted 4th January 2016First published on 6th January 2016AbstractCu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films were prepared with excess Cu concentrations (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1) by a successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. The deposited films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), UV-visible spectroscopy and I–V analysis. XRD analysis confirms the formation of tetragonal structured Cu2CdSnS4 thin films for all the excess Cu concentrations, while the corresponding FESEM images showed microstructural change. It may be attributed to the injection of excess Cu atoms into the Cd sites of the Cu2CdSnS4. The absorption coefficient is found to be greater than 104 cm−1 in the visible region and the bandgap energy is slightly tuned from 1.68 eV to 1.58 eV when compared to Cu2CdSnS4. The Cu2.1Cd0.9SnS4 film showed the highest photoresponse.
1. Introduction
Solar energy is the renewable energy source that is most abundant, clean, and readily available throughout the year. Photovoltaic devices/solar cells are one of the most effective means of harvesting solar energy and converting it into electricity for useful applications. The p–n junction Si photovoltaic (PV) device was first reported by Chapin et al. in 1954.1 Since then, the science and technology of PV devices and systems have undergone revolutionary developments. The present bottleneck or hurdle to the use of solar cells is their production cost, because the current PV industry mainly depends on Si wafer technologies.2 The fabrication process of this Si based PV technology has a high cost.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one of the most promising photovoltaic devices as they have low cost and light-to-energy conversion with relatively high efficiency.3 DSSC was reported by Regan and Gratzel (1991).4 A typical DSSC consists of three key components: a dye-sensitized semiconductor photoanode, an electrolyte with a redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE). Platinum is most commonly used as the CE, but it has a high cost. Several attempts have been made to replace Pt with a low cost, stable material without affecting cell performance.5–7
The CZTS compound is a p-type semiconductor that belongs to the Cu2-II–IV–VI4 family. It can be used as a potential absorber layer in thin film solar cells to replace expensive solar absorbers (CIS, CISe, CIGS and CIGSe) and CE for DSSCs owing to its high optical absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) and ideal direct band gap (1.4–1.5 eV). The constituents of CZTS are abundantly available in the earth's crust, are notably non-toxic and can be produced at low cost. CZTS exhibits a stannite type structure.8 A recent study of CZTS showed that it has a high power conversion efficiency of about 12%.9 The study also showed that CZTS can be an alternatative to the high-cost Pt electrode; this could considerably reduce the cost of solar cells. Sawanta S. Mali et al. (2014) and Shanlong Chen et al. (2015) reported higher efficiency of DSSC with FTO/CZTS as CE than the DSSC with Pt as CE.10,11
Cu2CdSnS4 (CCTS) is a member of the Cu2-II–IV–VI4 family that exhibits a high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1) analogous to that of CZTS.12 Thus, it is used as an absorbing material in solar cells.13 Mokurala et al. (2014) reported lower efficiency using DSSC with FTO/CCTS as CE than the DSSC with Pt as CE.14 Therefore, the present investigation was motivated to prepare the CCTS compound and to study its opto-structural, morphological and photoconversion properties.
CCTS thin films have been prepared by chemical bath deposition,15 spin coating,16,17 atom beam sputtering18 and spray pyrolysis.12 Herein, for the first time, the quaternary CCTS thin films were deposited by a simple low cost SILAR method at room temperature and their photocurrent generations were studied. Compared to other methods, the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method is a simple, less expensive, and less time-consuming method for the deposition of binary semiconducting thin films. It is also applicable in the deposition of large-area thin films. The SILAR method was first reported by Ristov et al. (1985).19 The name SILAR was ascribed by Nicolau in the mid-1980s.20
SILAR has a number of advantages: (i) it offers an extremely easy way to dope films, (ii) it does not require high quality target and vacuum at any stage, (iii) the deposition rate and the thickness of the film can be easily controlled, (iv) operating at room temperature can produce films on less robust materials, (v) it does not cause local over heating, which can be detrimental for materials to be deposited and (vi) there are virtually no restrictions on the substrate material, dimensions or its surface profile. The detailed explanation of the SILAR method is given by Pathan and Lokhande (2004).21
2. Experimental section
In this study, A.R. grade copper chloride (CuCl2), cadmium chloride (CdCl2), tin chloride (SnCl2) and sodium sulfide (Na2S) and double distilled water were used. Thin films of the Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 system were deposited on microscopic glass slides by the SILAR method at room temperature. The quality and quantity of thin film mainly depends on how well the substrate was cleaned. Thus, the glass substrates were cleaned with chromic acid and acetone. The SILAR method involves parameters of precursor concentration, dipping time and number of cycles. In this study, we have enriched the Cu ion concentration while reducing the Cd ions into the Cu2CdSnS4 system.
For the synthesis of Cu2CdSnS4 film, cationic precursors, namely, 0.1 M CuCl2, 0.05 M CdCl2 and 0.05 M SnCl2, were dissolved in distilled water. The anionic precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Na2S in distilled water to make a 0.2 M Na2S solution. First, the precleaned substrates were immersed in the composite cationic solution for 30 s to adsorb Cu2+, Cd2+ and Sn2+ ions. Then, the substrate was rinsed in distilled water for 10 s to remove the loosely adsorbed ions if any. Subsequently, the substrate was immersed in the anion solution (S2−) for 30 s, where the chemical reaction occurred between anions and cations to form CCTS. The substrate was again rinsed in distilled water for 10 s to remove the powdery precipitate if any. The abovementioned four steps are one SILAR cycle, and it was optimized. Similarly, 70 cycles were employed to obtain homogeneous CCTS film. The same procedure was adopted to enrich Cu concentrations (2.02, 2.04, 2.06, 2.08 and 2.10) into the CCTS system. The deposited films were annealed at 250 °C for 2 h in an air atmosphere. The schematic representation of the SILAR method is shown in Fig. 1, and the corresponding sample codes are given in Table 1.

The prepared CCTS films were characterized using XRD, FESEM, SEM, TEM, UV-Vis, and I–V techniques. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained using a PANalytical X′PERT-PRO diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5460 Å). The diffraction patterns were collected in the range of 2θ = 10°–80°. To investigate the surface morphology and roughness of the particles, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was carried out (FEI NAVO-SEM 450 instrument) with an accelerating voltage of 15 keV. To find the film thickness, the cross sectional view SEM images of the films were recorded using a JEOL-scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM—5610 LV). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigations were performed with a Tecnai 20 microscope (Philips, Holland) equipped with a W emitter and LaB6. TEM images were obtained at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Optical spectra were recorded using a UV-2400 PC series UV-Visible spectrometer. I–V measurements were carried out by linear sweep voltammetry (CH instruments CHI60E electrochemical analyzer) under dark conditions and mercury vapour lamp irradiation (visible light) with the following speculations: applied voltage = ±1 V, scan rate = 0.1 V s−1, and sensitivity = 0.001 A V−1. A film of 2 cm length and 2.5 cm breath was used to study the I–V photoconversion of the prepared Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin film. A setup of the two-probe device was constructed by simply connecting two crocodile clips to the Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin film surface with a typical spacing of 25 mm.
3. Results and discussion

Table 1 shows the thicknesses of the deposited Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films. It shows that the excess Cu added films are of lower thickness compared to the Cu2CdSnS4 thin films. Fig. 2a shows that the XRD pattern of the CCTS thin film for each of the different enriched Cu concentrations indicates a polycrystalline nature. After carefully substantiating the glass substrate hump (2θ = 25–30°), prominent peaks are observed at 2θ = 27.8° and 46.3° due to the (002) and (110) reflections of the wurtzite structure of CCTS, respectively.22 A small peak observed at 2θ = 32.3° is due to (200) reflection of the stannite structure of CCTS [JCPDS. Card No. 290537]. The results suggest that the deposited product has two different structures, as visible in the FESEM image of CCTS-0. Shifting of the (110) plane towards a higher angle with excess Cu concentration can also be noticed (Fig. 2b). This suggests that the added Cu2+ ions replace Cd2+ ions because the ionic radius of the Cu2+ ions (0.72 Å) is smaller than that of the Cd2+ ions (0.97 Å). A similar result has been reported for CZTS thin films obtained for different cycles by a SILAR method.23 The appearance of a broad hump in the range of 2θ = 25°–35° is due to the amorphous nature of the glass substrate. The crystallite size and microstrain can be calculated from the XRD, because both affect the peak shape. Thus, grain size and microstrain effects are interconnected in the line broadening of peaks, which makes it difficult to separate.

The crystallite size was estimated by using Scherrer's formula24 (1)where β is full width at half maximum (FWHM), λ is the wavelength of the X-ray source, and θ is the Bragg angle. The prepared CCTS film is polycrystalline in nature, and hence a large number of grains with various relative positions and orientations cause variations in the phase difference between the wave scattered by one grain and that by the others. The total intensity scattered by all grains is the sum of individual intensities scattered by each grain.25 On the other hand, the stresses are one of the most important unfavorable factors affecting the structural properties and can result from geometric mismatch at boundaries between the crystalline lattices of the films and the substrate.26 These stresses can cause microstrains (ε) in the films. The micro strain can be calculated from the following relation:27 (2)
A dislocation is an imperfection in a crystal associated with the misregistry of the lattice in one part of the crystal with that in another part. Unlike vacancies and interstitial atoms, dislocations are not equilibrium imperfections.28 The regular patterns are interrupted by dislocations or crystallographic defects.29 Dislocation density (δ) was evaluated by the following formula30 for obtaining information about the amount of defects in the films. (3)
Average crystallite size was calculated from the plane (220) for all Cu concentrations, and the results are presented in Table 2. The calculated ‘D’ values suggest that the deposited systems are nanocrystalline in nature, and the values are constant for almost all the films, with the exception being the CCTS-5 film. A similar trend is reflected in the lattice strain and dislocation density of the deposited CCTS films. The results agree well with the earlier report on CCTS film obtained by a spray pyrolysis method.12 The increase in crystallite size for CCTS-5 may be due to the coalescence of small crystallites while the dislocation density and microstrain decreases. Because dislocation density and microstrain are the manifestation of a dislocation network in the films, the decrease of both indicates the formation of high-quality films.31

Because the surface of the thin film influences its optostructural and electrical properties, it is an important aspect in the application of optoelectronic and solar cell devices. Fig. 3 shows the FESEM images of CCTS-0 thin film with two different magnifications (lower Fig. 3a and higher Fig. 3b), which show that it is dense, compact and void-free.

In Fig. 3(a), a large number of spherical particles can be observed with good adherence to the glass substrate. The presence of flakes that are combined with the spherical particles are also clearly visible in Fig. 3b. The average sizes of the spherical particles and flakes are about 88 μm and 4.7 μm, respectively. In the case of CCTS-1 (x = 0.02), columnar grains (Fig. 4a) appeared without pores on the film surface, and they are clearly visible in Fig. 4b. The average size of the grains is found to be less than 100 nm. A similar result was reported for the Cu2CoSnS4 film deposited by a sol–gel method.32 Furthermore, with increase in the x value to 0.04 (CCTS-3), the columnar grains were coalesced and tended to grow into bigger sized particles (Fig. 5(a and b)) on the glass substrate. The average size of the particles is about 150 nm (Fig. 5(a and b)).

The CCTS-5 film exhibited distinct morphological features, such as hexagonal-like, square-like and flake-like particles, when compared to the others. The transformation in the morphology of the compound may be due to the injection of excess Cu atoms into the Cd sites of the Cu2CdSnS4 films. The average size of the hexagonal particle was found to be about 2.23 μm (Fig. 6(a and b)). A similar morphological structure was recorded for Cu2ZnSnSe4 nanoparticles prepared by a solvothermal method.33 FESEM images reveal well reordered grain boundaries in the CCTS system and the presence of columnar crystal lead to interspace at the surface. This reduces electron–hole recombination and effectively enhances the availability of light in optoelectrical devices.34 Conspicuously, microstructural change is monitored in the CCTS system by varying Cu concentration. The chemical composition analysis was carried out on CCTS-2 and CCTS-5 thin films by energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis. Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†) show the representative EDX patterns of the CCTS thin films, which confirm the formation of the Cu2.02Cd0.98SnS4 and Cu2.1Cd0.9SnS4 systems and also indicate the presence of Cu, Cd, Sn and S in the CCTS matrix. The quantitative analysis of the abovementioned elements for CCTS-2 is Cu-53.01, Sn-11.31, S-35.22, and Cd-0.46 and for CCTS-5 is Cu-55.42, Sn-12.87, S-31.67, Cd-0.04. The observed final composition of each film would demonstrate the relative changes in composition and correlate this data to changes in peak position in XRD (Fig. 2b).

The thicknesses of the CCTS films were measured using the cross-sectional view of the SEM images. The films were broken, and the images were recorded of the broken side. The cross-sectional images of the films are shown in Fig. 7, and their thicknesses are given in Table. 1.

The TEM image of CCTS-2 film shows mixed structures of polygonal, spherical, flake, and rhombohedral structures, and the results are in accordance with the FESEM analysis (CCTS-3). The presence of a spot in the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) image of CCTS-2 represents the polycrystalline nature of the deposited films (Fig. 8).

To evaluate the film as a potential active layer for photovoltaic applications, we measured the optical and photoconductivity properties of the Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films. Fig. 9 shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of CCTS films deposited for different x values (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, and 0.10). It can be seen from the spectra that all the CCTS films show better absorption in the visible region except for the CCTS-0 film. The absorption is lower in the latter film may be because of the low substitution of Cd2+ ions by Cu2+ ions.The result coincides with the earlier report for Cu2CdSnS4 film by Yong Cui et al.22 However, gradual reduction is noticed in the absorption profile between 500 and 600 nm for all the films, which is attributed to d–d transitions of Cu2+.35
 Fig. 9  UV-Visible absorption spectra of Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 films (x = 0 to 0.1). 
The absorption coefficient ‘α’ was calculated using the following formula:36 (4) The α value of every CCTS film is found to be greater than 104 cm−1 (Fig. S3 given in ESI†). The increase in ‘α’ caused a decrease in the transition energy of the charge carriers.37 The result confirms that the deposited films can be used for optical applications.
Bandgap energy (Eg) is defined as the optical energy band gap between the valence band (VB) and the conduction band (CB). The optical band gap energy was calculated using the following equation:38 αhν = A(hν − Eg)n(5)where ‘α’ is the absorption coefficient, ‘hν’ is photon energy, ‘A’ is a parameter that depends on the transition probability, ‘h’ is Planck's constant, and exponent ‘n’ depends on the nature of the transition during the absorption process. The value of n is 1/2, 3/2, 2, and 3 for direct allowed, direct forbidden, indirect allowed and indirect forbidden transitions, respectively. The type of transition depends on the absorption coefficient value. When the α value is larger than 104 cm−1, the transition is called a direct transition, in which the electron moves from the VB to CB with a different wave vector, while the energy and momentum are conserved. However, the indirect transition occurs when the value of the absorption coefficient is less than 104 cm−1,39 in which the electrons are transferred from VB to CB at the same wave vector. The momentum and energy must be conserved with phonon assistance.39
The ‘α’ values are found to be greater than 104 cm−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†) for all the Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films. A very thin layer of film (1–2 μm) can absorb over 90% of the photons over the spectrum with energy higher than that of the band gap.40 The results suggest that the films have direct allowed transition when the value of n is selected as 1/2. The band gap of each Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin film was determined by extrapolating the linear region to the energy axis. The plot of (αhν)2versus hν for all the films (x = 0.02 to 0.1) is shown in Fig. 10. It is noticed that the Eg decreases from 1.68 to 1.58 eV for all the deposited films (x = 0.0 to 0.1). A similar trend was reported for Cu-doped Cu2CdSnS4 films by Min-Ling Liu et al.41 However, the Eg values of the present results are relatively low, which is attributed to the valence band maximum (VBM) caused by the stronger hybridization of Cu 3d and S 4p orbitals with the increasing Cu-doping concentration.42 The high absorption coefficient (in the range of 400–600 nm) and the tunable band gap of Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films would be advantageous for absorber layers of solar energy devices and photovoltaic applications. The variation in bandgap energy of Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films proposes that the optical properties of the thin films can be controlled by varying the Cu doping concentration. It is an important factor for the optoelectronic applications.

The extinction coefficient (k) is a measure of light lost due to scattering and absorption per unit volume. The value ‘k’ was calculated from the following relation,36 and the results are given in Fig. 11. (6)where α is the absorption coefficient and λ is the wavelength. The calculated values (k) are found in the range of 0.0003–0.0035, and the positive values indicate the strong absorbing (optical energy) nature of the deposited systems,43 which can be attributed to the better smoothness of the surface and homogeneity of the compound.44 Comparing the results, the CCTS-5 film shows a higher ‘k’ value than other films. It was also noticed that the maximum value of ‘k’ shifts towards longer wavelength with an increase in Cu concentration, attributed to decrease in ‘Eg’ value. This behavior can be ascribed to the higher absorption coefficient45 of the films (Fig. S3 given in ESI†). Moreover, the gradual decrease in the ‘k’ value towards shorter wavelength indicates that the fraction of light was lost because of scattering.46

Refractive index (n) is one of the fundamental properties for an optical material because it is closely related to the electronic polarization of ions and the local field inside materials.47 It is also a significant factor in optical communication and in designing devices and spectral dispersion.48 The ‘n’ values were calculated using the following relation,49 and their results are presented in Fig. 12. (7)
 Fig. 12  Refractive index pattern of Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films (x = 0 to 0.1). 
The value of ‘n’ increased with increase in photon energy for the deposited Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films except for CCTS-0. This may be attributed to the presence of excess Cu that strongly absorbed the light energy. A similar result was observerd for CZTS thin films obtained by a spray pyrolysis method.50
The complex dielectric constant is a fundamental intrinsic property of a material. The real part (εr) is associated with the term that, how much it will slow down the speed of light in the material and imaginary part (εi) showed how a dielectric absorbs energy from the electric field due to dipole motion. The ‘εr’ is the normal dielectric constant and ‘εi’ represents the absorption associated with radiation by free energy.51 The obtained ‘n’ and ‘k’ can be used to calculate the εr and εi from the following expressions (8) and (9): εr = n2 − k2(8) εi = 2nk(9)Fig. 13 and 14 show the variation of εr and εi with respect to the photon energy of Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films. It can be seen from the plots that both εr and εi are found to follow a similar trend; however, the magnitude of the εr is higher than that of the εi. It was also noticed that εr and εi increased in value for x = 0.02 to 0.1, which is attributed to the deceleration of the speed of light in the material and the effect of the dipole motion of free carriers on the absorption, respectively.52

The optical conductivity (σopt) of the Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films can be calculated from the following relation (10), (10)where c is the velocity of light, α is the absorption coefficient and n is the refractive index. Fig. 15 shows the optical conductivity of Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films. The σopt is found to increase with increase in photon energy, and excess Cu concentrations contributed to the high optical absorption (Fig. S3, ESI†) by CCTS thin films, because CCTS is a p-type semiconductor and the number of carriers available for electrical conduction is controlled by electrons. As the Cu concentration increases, the number of donors increases and the energy levels slowly shift towards the conduction band of CCTS.

Photoconductivity is a prerequisite for a material to be suitable for solar cell applications. The photoconductivity of a semiconductor involves two processes: generation and transport. The absorption of a photon by a photoconductor could result in the generation of free electrons excited from the valence band to the conduction band. Concurrently, a hole is generated in the valence band. The application of an electric field through the material results in the transportation of both electrons and holes through the material and consequent production of an electric current in the circuit. This process increases the conductivity of the semiconductor. The photosensitive responses of Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films were recorded using a visible light source in air at room temperature using a CHI604E electrochemical workstation. Fig. 16 shows the I–V characteristics of CCTS-4 (Fig. 16a) and CCTS-5 (Fig. 16b) film, which exhibit ohmic behavior for both dark and illuminated (visible light) conditions. However, the latter showed a higher photosensitivity, attributed to the visible light photons that excite the electrons in the valence band to the conduction band, and then increase in the holes in the presence of light enhances the film conductivity of the CCTS. A similar result was reported for the CZTS thin films.53 The I–V measurements show no rectification behaviour, which indicates the absence of a Schottky barrier at film contacts.

The photosensitivity can be calculated using the following formula (11):54 (11)where S is photosensitivity, Idark is dark current and Ilight is current generated under illumination. The percentages of photosensitivity for the deposited Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films are presented in Fig. 17. The measured photocurrent values are found to be 0.096% for CCTS-0, 1.57% for CCTS-1, 1.74% for CCTS-2, 1.87% for CCTS-3, 3.92% for CCTS-4 and 8.94% for CCTS-5. It is important to notice that the photocurrent values are higher for CCTS-4 (Fig. 16a) and CCTS-5 (Fig. 16b) owing to the incorporation of excess Cu concentration into the Cu2CdSnS4 system, which enhances the quantity of photo-generated carriers. This result identified the potential active layer in the thin film solar cells. This property may be utilised for the generation of the photocurrent.
 Fig. 17  Photosensitivity for Cu2+xCd1−xSnS4 thin films (x = 0 to 0.1). 
By comparing our results (Table 3) with earlier reports, it can be inferred that the present study shows high values for photocurrent.23 This may be attributed to the bigger sized particles (Fig. 3–6) present in the system that increase the diffusion length of the carriers. It is well known that bigger particle size is beneficial to the collection of charge and for decreasing the recombination at the grain boundaries of the final devices.14 However, the present result is relatively lower than that of CZTS and Cu2CoSnS4 thin films56,60 because the systems have low Eg values of 1.5 eV and 1.58 eV, respectively. Generally, a device with higher band gap gives lower efficiency, because it absorbs fewer photons, which in turn reduces the photosensitivity.61 Thus, further investigation are carried out to increase the photocurrent of the CCTS films from that of Cu2ZnSnS4 and Cu2CoSnS4 films by varying its deposition time, film thickness, and annealing temperature and to fabricate CCTS based solar cells.

4. Conclusions
Cu2−xCd1−xSnS4 thin films were prepared for various Cu concentrations (x = 0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08 and 0.1) by a SILAR method. The deposited CCTS system shows a polycrystalline nature within the tetragonal system, and increase in excess Cu concentration gives the same crystal structure. The plane (220) shows shift towards higher angles with excess Cu concentration. FESEM image shows spherical, flake, square, rhombohedral and hexagonal morphologies for increase in excess Cu concentration. The transformation of morphology may be due to the injection of excess Cu atoms into Cd sites in the CCTS system. The TEM image also confirms the polygonal, sphere and flake structures, which support the morphological changes observed in the FESEM analysis. SAED pattern confirms the polycrystalline nature of CCTS-2 films. The absorption coefficient is found to be greater than 104 cm−1 for all the CCTS films. The bandgap energy is slightly altered from 1.68 eV to 1.58 eV. The positive and low values of extinction coefficient indicate the strong absorbing nature and smoothness of the deposited films. The increase in refractive index confirms the strong absorbing nature of the films. The percentage of photosensitivity is higher for Cu2.1Cd0.9SnS4 thin films, attributed to the increase in electron–hole pairs. It is concluded from the opto-structural and morphological studies that the Cu-rich films show better optical properties, which are suitable for photovoltaic applications.
