    , Accepted 22nd January 2021First published on 25th January 2021AbstractTransition metal complexes offer cost-effective alternatives as hole-transport materials (HTMs) in perovskite solar cells. However, the devices suffer from low performance. We boost the power conversion efficiency of devices with transition metal complex HTMs from 2% to above 10% through energy level tuning. We further demonstrate the excellent photostability of the device based on the additive-free HTM.
International excitement surrounding the prospects of perovskite solar cells shows no signs of abating. Many groups now achieve >20% light-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (PCE) for benchmark laboratory devices,1 a level suitable for commercial application. A natural shift in research focus on improving the stability and cost of device components is occurring internationally to address these challenges. Indeed, many reports are showing that it is becoming clear that the incumbent hole transport material (HTM) 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di-(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is not suitable for commercial application due to the high cost of production, even at volume, and chemical instability. In practice, the required additives for increased performance of spiro-OMeTAD and related HTMs comes at a cost to stability. Investigation of dopant-free HTMs are therefore an active field for synthetic chemists.2 Indeed, techno-economic reviews suggest structural simplicity is required of all materials for commercial application to be produced at scale.3,4 This motivates investigation to identify HTMs with high stability, low cost, and simplified synthetic processing.
Originally used as redox mediators in liquid junction dye cells,5 simple transition metal complexes have begun to receive attention for solid-state charge transport. Frietag et al.6 serendipitously discovered excellent solid-state hole transport for bis Cu(I/II) complexes. Kashif et al.7 employed a hexadentate Fe(II/III) coordination complex mediator with N-donors based on the heterocycle pyridine mediator to achieve a modest 2% PCE in a perovskite solar cell. Here, the novel wide-bandgap FAPbBr3 was required for energy matching considerations owing to the deep HOMO level of the iron complex. We reasoned that higher PCEs would be readily attainable with state-of-the-art perovskite formulations, such as Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3,8 provided that we could adequately match the energy levels. We have previously reported tuning the redox potential of cobalt bipyridine complexes by as much as 420 mV through ligand derivatisation via electron withdrawing/donating groups.5 We further employ this strategy to optimise the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level for compatibility with more conventional perovskite formulations.8
We synthesised simple homoleptic iron(II/III) triflate complexes in Fig. 1avia a coordination reaction with 4,4′-disubstituted-2,2′-bipyridine ligands with electron-donating groups (–NH2, –tBu, –OMe, –H). All ligands were commercially-sourced (Fig. S1, ESI†). We evaluated the HOMO level (Fig. S2, ESI†) and electronic transition (Fig. S3, ESI†) of the coordination complexes by photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) and UV-visible spectroscopy, respectively. The energy level diagram constructed in Fig. S4 (ESI†) demonstrates a positive shift of the ionisation potential suitable for all complexes containing electron-donating substituents. A shift of ∼700 meV is recorded for the substituent with the highest donation strength. We have previously measured this perovskite valence band maximum to be −5.5 eV by PESA,9 meaning that the hole injection is favourable for the electron-donating ligands. Furthermore, the magnitude of the shift in the HOMO level is rationally-engineered by the established Hammett Parameter formalism10 (Fig. 1b). Cyclic voltammetry of the coordination complexes recorded in acetonitrile at a Pt electrode revealed quasi reversible (ΔEp = 66–80 mV) redox couples, which is ideal for hole transport applications (Fig. S5, ESI†).

We performed an initial screening of the HTMs via time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) quenching measurements on pristine perovskite films (Fig. 1c). Each transient was described by a bi-exponential fitting, with parameters in Table S1 (ESI†). The FeII-DA and FeII-DTB complexes impart rapid quenching of the lifetime, which may be from hole injection and or non-radiative recombination. Interestingly, FeII-DMO and the energetically mismatched complex FeII-Bpy passivate the second decay process, extending its lifetime beyond that of the control. Full device screening was conducted in a n-i-p FTO|SnO2|perovskite|HTL|Au architecture.11 The hole transport layer (HTL) was p-type doped with the corresponding Fe(III) complex at 10 mol% to improve the hole conductivity,7 an approach which has been successful with spiro-OMeTAD.12,28 We screen the HTLs in the absence of the usual additives LiTFSI and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) due to their extrinsic contribution towards device instability.13–15 The high JSC shows that hole injection is favourable and efficient, whilst a reduced VOC indicates that there is an increase in non-radiative recombination. The performance of the other candidates can be improved with the usual HTM additives (Fig. S6, ESI†); however, our focus is additive elimination for stability reasons. Interestingly, the amino-functionalised FeII/III-DA complex has significantly decreased the J–V hysteresis. Photocurrent hysteresis requires both ion migration/accumulation and significant surface recombination.16 We expect that surface recombination rates to be similar amongst the HTLs. We posit that either the Lewis basicity of the terminal 4,4′-amino group is sufficient to bind under-coordinated lead or that its structure delays ion migration coulombically to a slower timescale. Regardless, this screening highlighted FeII-DA complex to be the leading candidate, for which we pursued further optimisation.
We conducted the study on different FeIII-DA doping ratios of 10, 20 and 50% as FeDA-10, FeDA-20 and FeDA-50, respectively. Fig. S7 (ESI†) depicts the top-view SEM image of the bare perovskite film together with those covered with FeII-DA films of different doping ratio. The image of the bare perovskite film is representative of high-quality triple-cation mixed-halide perovskites films with a slight excess PbI2 phase.23,24 The covering Fe-complex films showed the presence of some pinholes, being more prevalent at higher FeIII-DA ratio. Pinhole defects may cause enhanced charge recombination as well as possible shunting. In addition, the inferior interface will dominate the final VOC, further efforts are needed to optimise the quality of HTL to suppress non-radiative recombination at the perovskite/HTL interface.25 Some initial screening indicates PMMA additive or the FeDA chloride salt rather than the inert triflate than can passivate the perovskite|HTM interface and reclaim some VOC deficit.
We measured the ionisation potential of each FeII-DA film made on top of the perovskite film. The HOMO level of FeDA-10, FeDA-20, FeDA-50 films were determined to be −5.41, −5.43, −5.52 eV from PESA (Fig. S8, ESI†), respectively. We then constructed the energy level alignment diagram of the completed device17 in Fig. 2a. The energy level alignment shows the HOMO levels of FeDA-10 and FeDA-20 are higher than the perovskite's HOMO level which is beneficial for the hole extraction. In contrast, FeDA-50 is too highly p-doped which lowers the HOMO level below the HOMO level of the perovskite, to a mismatched position for hole injection.

To investigate the hole injection dynamics, we performed photoluminescence (PL) experiments on perovskite films coated with each FeII-DA film (Fig. 3b). The average PL lifetime obtained from bi-exponential fittings of the decay curves are 19.8, 17.5 and 41.9 ns for perovskite films coated with FeDA-10, FeDA-20 and FeDA-50, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). Again, the PL lifetime dramatically quenched when in contact with the Fe-complex. Comparing to FeDA-10 and FeDA-20, the relatively longer PL lifetime of the perovskite coated with FeDA-50 indicates inferior hole injection in FeDA-50.18,19 This result is consistent with the energy level alignment arguments given earlier. The inset contains the corresponding steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy. We observe a PL quenching that is consistent with the TRPL results.

We made complete devices based on the FeIII-DA dopant series. Fig. S9 (ESI†) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of the device with FeDA-20, we can observe the functional layers FTO|SnO2|perovskite|FeDA-20|Au. As observed in the SEM image, the FeDA-20 HTL is a very thin layer. J–V curves were recorded on a batch of devices. The statistical distribution of device performance parameters is shown in Fig. 2c. We observed that the short current density (JSC) of devices decreased with increasing ratio of FeIII-DA.
The FeDA-20 HTL was the optimum dopant ratio, owing to an improved fill factor (FF) and open-circuit voltage (VOC) comparison. Despite having a higher p-type doping level, FeDA-20 possesses a higher VOC than FeDA-10. To explain this result, we characterised the recombination behaviour of full devices via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The EIS data were obtained under stabilised open-circuit conditions. The Nyquist plots, equivalent circuit and fitting results are shown in Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†). In general, the low-frequency process can be attributed to recombination processes in the devices.20,21 The fitted recombination resistances (Rrec) as a function of device VOC are given in Fig. 2d. As observed, the Rrec of the device based on FeDA-20 is much higher than the Rrec of the devices based on FeDA-10 and FeDA-50, reflecting lower charge recombination in this device. Those results explained the higher observed VOC from J–V measurements. The increased hole conductivity transports holes away from the perovskite|HTL interface reducing recombination.
Whilst organo-lead halide perovskites semiconductors are relatively tolerant to extrinsic iron impurities,22 we note that we cannot exclude the possibility of high accumulation of B-site substitution at the perovskite|HTL interface. However, the cumulative formation constant for three bidentate ligands is large (log10β3 = 17),23 which should limit the free iron concentration for exchange. Further, our solvent nitromethane is a weak ligand for iron24 so we can exclude solvolysis. Iron has a stronger affinity for N-donors than I-donor, whilst Pb has a reverse affinity, in keeping with a low expected substitution. Hexadentate Fe–N6 complexes would have even lower free iron concentration and still show enhanced recombination compared to spiro-OMeTAD.7 Conversely, when used as an ionising dopant with spiro-OMeTAD, another hexadentate Fe(III)–N6 dopant can achieve higher VOC through suppressed recombination.25

Fig. 3a depicts the best performing device of this study based on an FeDA-20 HTM (J–V curves of champion devices based on FeDA-10 and FeDA-50 shown in Fig. S12, ESI†). The device with FeDA-20 shows the best PCE of 10.5%, with negligible hysteresis. This result is significant for solution-processed coordination-complex HTLs. Amongst this class of material, only ultra-thin thermally-evaporated porphyrinoid complexes of Cu, Zn and Pt have exceeded this level. The use of lower oxidation state metal centres and larger delocalised systems in the ligand/coordination structures further stabilise charge transport leading to enhanced device performance.
Having developed a low-cost HTM without reactive additives, we evaluated the photostability of devices held at their initial maximum power point. Devices were encapsulated and measured under simulated AM1.5G irradiance. Fig. 3b shows the long-term stability of encapsulated devices with spiro-OMeTAD, FeDA-20 and without HTL. Even though the J–V performance of the device based on FeDA-20 is lower than devices based on spiro-OMeTAD with additives (see Fig. S13, ESI†), the stability of the device is markedly improved. Devices with spiro-OMeTAD and without HTL degraded rapidly within two days. However, the device based on FeDA-20 retained 90% of its initial PCE after 600 h of testing. The promising stability indicates the Fe-complex HTL not only avoided the issue caused by additives like Li+ or 4-tert-butylpyridine, but that the higher density of the transition metal complex HTM blocked Au diffusion into the perovskite which causes irreversible degradation.26,27
Existing HTMs for PSCs such as the widely used spiro-OMeTAD have several drawbacks that impede its use in large-scale commercialisation of PSCs technology. Transition metal complexes provide a unique opportunity for developing scalable HTMs for PSCs. By derivatising simple homoleptic iron bipyridine analogues and optimising the Fe(II/III) dopant level, we successfully developed a device with over 10% PCE, low hysteresis and excellent photostability to over 600 h continuous illumination. The physical chemists’ toolbox is filled with ways to manipulating properties of such model transition metal complexes. This work provides an insight into exploring low-cost and stable HTMs to improve device stability and commercialisation of efficient and stable PSCs.
