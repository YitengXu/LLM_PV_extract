    , Accepted 28th June 2021First published on 29th June 2021AbstractIncreasing electroluminescene quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of the photoactive layer to reduce non-radiative recombination energy loss (Eloss) has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to improve open-circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Meanwhile, incorporating a third component into the active-layer film can improve power conversion efficiency (PCE) of resultant ternary OSCs, mostly contributed from increments in short-circuit current density and fill factor but less in the Voc. Herein, we report a highly fluorescent molecule (IT-MCA) as a third component to reduce the Eloss and enhance the Voc for ternary OSCs. Applying the IT-MCA to three binary hosts, a significant increase of Voc (41 mV) is acquired and a best PCE of 16.7% is obtained with outstanding device stability. This work provides a new guideline to design the third-component molecule by enhancing its fluorescence for efficient and stable ternary OSCs with improved Voc.

New concepts
Reducing the non-radiative recombination energy loss (Eloss) to improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has become a significant way to increase the device efficiency. In this work, a highly fluorescent molecule acting as a fluorescence intensifier was introduced into ternary OSCs to reduce the Eloss, thus improving the Voc of devices. The newly synthesized molecule named IT-MCA possessing a high photoluminescence quantum yield in the film enhances fluorescent emission and electroluminescene quantum efficiency of the ternary film via the Förster resonance energy transfer to the acceptor component. The non-radiative recombination Eloss is thus reduced, resulting in an improved Voc of up to 41 mV and a PCE of 16.7% is achieved from ternary devices with improved stability. This work proposes a new method of fluorescence intensifier-induced Voc increase of ternary OSCs for the first time, leading to a great Voc increase in different binary host systems.

Introduction
In recent years, organic solar cells (OSCs) have made great progress with power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 18% for single-junction devices.1–5 Thanks to the advances of non-fullerene acceptors with near-infrared absorptions, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of OSCs has been remarkably improved contributing to high PCEs. However, open-circuit voltage (Voc) remains relatively low compared to the theoretical value because of large energy loss (Eloss).6 In principle, Eloss is determined by three factors.7–11 The first one (ΔE1) is caused by the radiative recombination originating from the absorption above the optical gap, typically in a range of 0.25–0.30 eV, unavoidable for any kind of solar cells. The second (ΔE2) is due to the radiative recombination below the optical gap, which could be reduced by minimizing the energetic offset between energy gap and charge transfer (CT) state. The last one (ΔE3) is the non-radiative recombination energy loss, which could be calculated from an equation: ΔE3 = qΔVnon-radoc = −kTln(EQEEL), where the EQEEL is the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photoactive layer. Particularly, reducing ΔE3 plays a crucial role in increasing the Voc and draws wide concerns for its adjustable space by enhancing the photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY) of low-bandgap materials.6–8 Some efforts have been made to enhance the PLQY of the acceptor material to decrease ΔE3 in binary OSCs.12,13 For example, Gao et al. developed benzotriazole-based NFAs with a high PLQY, acquiring a small ΔE3 of 0.25 eV and thus a high Voc of 0.879 V.12 Recently, Hou et al. developed a chlorinated NFA, decreasing ΔE3 to 0.20 eV by increasing EQEEL and obtaining a high Voc of 0.867 V.13
On the other hand, introducing a third component into the binary photoactive layer is an effective method to improve the performance of OSCs.14–19 In such ternary OSCs, the third component usually plays a role in complementing the absorption scope15,16 and modulating the crystallinity and morphology of the blend film, benefitting improvements of Jsc and fill factor (FF).20–25 However, it seldom contributes to reduce the Eloss and improve the Voc, which is just concerned very recently.26–28 For instance, Sun et al. introduced a polymer PBDTm-T1 to the PTB7-Th:FOIC host system, reducing ΔE3 and obtaining a Voc increase from 0.740 to 0.762 V (PCE of 13.8%).27 Hou et al. reported a third-component molecule that can attenuate the aggregation-caused emission quenching (ACQ) of the IT-4F acceptor, acquiring an improved Voc from 0.710 to 0.770 V (PCE over 11.5%).29 Nevertheless, the fluorescence property of the third component has never been considered to tune the ΔE3 of the host system. In principle, a third-component molecule with high PLQY has the potential in decreasing ΔE3, as discussed above for the binary OSCs.
Herein, we report the incorporation of a highly fluorescent molecule into a binary blend to reduce ΔE3 and thus improve the Voc and PCE of ternary OSCs. Such a fluorescence intensifier is designed, containing an indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDT) core flanked with methyl cyanoacetate (MCA) at both sides (IT-MCA, Fig. 1a). Thanks to high coplanarity, weak electron push–pull effect, and absence of fluorescence-quenched heteroatoms (such as halides), the IT-MCA molecule possesses a high PLQY (10.3%, see details below) in the film. By being added into a highly efficient PM6:IT-4F blend,30–33 the IT-MCA acts as neither a donor nor an acceptor, yet increases the PLQY and EQEEL of the ternary film via the Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET, from IT-MCA to the IT-4F), leading to decreased ΔE3 and thus enhanced Voc. Meanwhile, the ternary film exhibits good morphology and enhanced face-on orientation when using an appropriate ratio of IT-MCA. Accordingly, a ternary OSC based on PM6:IT-4F containing an optimal ratio of 20% (in weight) IT-MCA acquires an enhanced Voc from 0.838 V to 0.879 V without sacrificing Jsc and FF, giving a PCE of 14.0%. This fluorescence intensifier is also applicable to other binary hosts such as PBDB-T:ITIC and PM6:Y6; in particular a high PCE up to 16.7% is obtained for the latter case with a high Voc of 0.882 V, among the highest Voc in Y6-based ternary OSCs. In addition, non-encapsulated ternary OSCs based on the IT-MCA exhibit higher stability than binary counterparts after 500 h under light radiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) or thermal stress at 80 °C.

Results and discussion
The target IT-MCA was synthesized by a facile condensation reaction between dialdehyde-substituted IDT and methyl cyanoacetate, as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Its structure was unambiguously confirmed by NMR spectra and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (see details in ESI†). The IT-MCA molecule is readily soluble in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene, ensuring its solution processability as a third component to be added into a binary blend host. UV-Vis absorption spectrum of IT-MCA displays a strong band in a region of 450–600 nm (Fig. 1b), where the PM6 and IT-4F present weak absorptions. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements (Fig. S1, ESI†) show that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the IT-MCA are −5.70 and −3.55 eV, respectively, corresponding to an energy bandgap of 2.15 eV in agreement with the value calculated from the absorption onset. It can be seen that the LUMO and HOMO levels of IT-MCA are almost the same as the LUMO of PM6 and the HOMO of IT-4F (Fig. 1c). This type of energy-level alignment is different from a traditional cascade one,34,35 where the third component facilitates the charge transfer by providing additional pathways and suppressing charge recombination. In our case, the energy-level alignment does not allow for efficient charge transfer between IT-MCA and each of the host materials, making the IT-MCA as neither a donor nor an acceptor in this ternary system. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we fabricated two binary devices composed of PM6:IT-MCA and IT-MCA:IT-4F, respectively, showcasing very weak photovoltaic effects (Table S1, ESI†). It is thus believed that there is almost no photoinduced charge transfer between IT-MCA and either PM6 or IT-4F. The results suggest that the IT-MCA will not contribute to photoinduced charge generation in the PM6:IT-4F blend, which is quite distinctive from most of previously reported third components for ternary OSCs.17–20
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 1d, e and Fig. S2, ESI†) reveal that the IT-MCA exhibits a high coplanarity with a strong rigidity in the conjugated backbone. XRD characterization shows a sharp peak at 6.12° for this molecule (Fig. 1f) and two dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D GIXD) pattern validates its strong crystallinity (Fig. 1g). These results imply that the IT-MCA molecule can be of strong fluorescence. Accordingly, we test the photoluminescence (PL) spectrum and calculate the PLQY of the IT-MCA in film. As shown in Fig. 2a, its film displays a very strong emission band peaking at 674 nm with shoulders at 590 and 755 nm, from which the PLQY is calculated to be as high as 10.3%. By contrast, the IT-4F and PM6 emit extremely weak fluorescence with the PLQY of 0.7% and 0.1%, respectively. Therefore, it can be predicted that the fluorescent property of the PM6:IT-4F blend film will be profoundly varied after adding the IT-MCA.

To investigate the function of IT-MCA in the blend, we first compared its emission band with the absorption spectra of IT-4F and PM6 (Fig. 2b). It is found that the spectral overlap between IT-MCA and IT-4F is much larger than that between IT-MCA and PM6, suggesting a more effective FRET process in the former blend.36,37 Then, we added IT-MCA into IT-4F film with different ratios and found that an emission band peaking at around 760 nm appeared, whose intensity gradually increased with the increased IT-MCA ratios (Fig. 2c). Interestingly, this PL spectrum is different from that of the neat film of either IT-MCA or IT-4F (Fig. 2a). In order to explore the origin of the new emission band, we detect the PL spectra of IT-MCA and IT-4F in diluted solutions because the two molecules are to a certain extent dispersed in their blend film. As depicted in Fig. 2d, the IT-MCA and IT-4F display a maximum emission peak at 590 and 759 nm in their 10−4 M solution, respectively, which shifts to blue with the appearance of a vibronic band in a more diluted solution (10−5 M). Obviously, the fluorescence of the IT-4F:IT-MCA blend film stems from the IT-4F component, while the emission from the IT-MCA is completely quenched. Even in the blend with IT-4F:IT-MCA = 1:5, no signal from the IT-MCA is observed, clearly indicating that the fluorescence of IT-MCA transfers to the IT-4F efficiently in their blend via the FRET process. It should be noted that the dilution effect in the IT-MCA:IT-4F blend film can also enhance the emission of IT-4F because of the reduction of ACQ, as previously proposed by Hou et al.29 However, the emission of IT-4F was not further increased when the blending ratio exceeds 1:1, inferring that the dilution effect only works in a specific range of blending. Differently, in our case, the emission of IT-4F is progressively improved with the increased IT-MCA content even at a high blending ratio (e.g. IT-4F:IT-MCA = 1:5), indicating the significant contribution of the FRET process on the emission enhancement. Identical experiments are conducted on the PM6:IT-MCA blend film and the results verify that the FRET between these two molecules is less efficient (Fig. S3, ESI†) because of a small overlap of their absorption and PL spectra as mentioned above. Therefore, when incorporating the IT-MCA into the PM6:IT-4F blend, the fluorescence of the ternary film will be intensified thanks to enhanced emission of the IT-4F.
In order to figure it out, the IT-MCA is added into the PM6:IT-4F blend film with different ratios (10, 20, and 50% of IT-MCA on the basis of PM6:IT-4F = 1:1, in weight) and their PL spectra are measured. It is clearly seen that the ternary films exhibit enhanced PL intensity (Fig. 2e) and PLQY (Table 1) with the increase in IT-MCA amount. The emission dominantly stems from the IT-4F component, indicative of the occurrence of FRET between IT-MCA and IT-4F in agreement with the cases of binary films. For the sample with 50% of IT-MCA, a weak emission band from the third component is observed, which should be due to the presence of PM6 in the ternary film impeding somewhat the FRET between the other two species. Furthermore, we fabricate electroluminescence devices based on the ternary films and measure their EQEEL. Similarly, the EQEEL is also improved as the feed ratio of IT-MCA increases in the blend (Fig. 2f and Fig. S4, ESI†), resulting in reduced ΔE3 calculated by the equation of ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL), which is listed in Table 1.13 Overall, the addition of highly fluorescent IT-MCA into the PM6:IT-4F host can reduce the non-radiative recombination of the ternary blend as demonstrated by the enhanced PL and EQEEL, which is supposed to contribute to the improvement of Voc in devices.

In addition to intensifying the fluorescence and EQEEL, the IT-MCA will also impact the morphology and crystallinity of the ternary film. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the surface property (Fig. 3a–d), showing that the ternary blend films even containing a high feed ratio of IT-MCA exhibit comparable surface roughness and phase separation to the PM6:IT-4F host. We speculate that the IT-MCA is well miscible with the IT-4F owing to their similar coplanar structures, forming a well-mixed phase, which does not vary the morphology of the blend film. Furthermore, the 2D GIXD measurements were performed and the results (Fig. 3e–h) display that the ternary blend film with 10% IT-MCA is similar to the binary host. When the feed ratio of IT-MCA reaches 20%, the blend film exhibits a stronger (010) peak at 1.73 Å−1 in the out-of-plane direction, which implies an enhanced face-on orientation in the film and thus benefitting the charge transport.11–13 In addition, the three blend films (0, 10, 20% IT-MCA) exhibit a similar π–π stacking distance of 3.63 Å and a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 2.57 nm, indicating no obvious change in their crystallinity. Further increasing the IT-MCA ratio (50%), the ternary film presents a mixed orientation, with a strong (100) peak at 0.42 Å−1 and a weak (010) peak at 1.68 Å−1 in the in-plane direction (Fig. S5, ESI†), both of which correspond to signals of the pristine IT-MCA. Therefore, the crystallinity and orientation of the ternary film is considerably altered in the case of containing a high proportion of the IT-MCA. Moreover, with the addition of IT-MCA, a (100) peak at 0.32 Å−1 gradually vanishes and another at 0.30 Å−1 becomes stronger in the in-plane direction (Fig. S5, ESI†), which should be due to the good miscibility between IT-MCA and IT-4F as discussed above. The crystallization behavior of IT-4F can thus be affected, lowering the ACQ and improving PL emission of the IT-4F as mentioned in literature.29 More importantly, the good miscibility also favors the FRET from IT-MCA to IT-4F, intensifying the emission from the latter and reducing the ΔE3.

After evidencing that the introduction of IT-MCA into PM6:IT-4F binary films could reduce the ΔE3 while guaranteeing efficient charge transport, it is reasonable to use the ternary blend film to enhance the performance of OSCs. Thus, devices based on an inverted architecture of ITO/ZnO/PM6:IT-4F:IT-MCA/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. Details about the device fabrication procedure are presented in the ESI.† The weight ratio of donor PM6 and acceptor IT-4F is controlled at 1:1 while the IT-MCA feeding content is 10, 20, and 50%, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4a and Table 2, the binary cell exhibits a PCE of 12.2% with a Voc of 0.838 V, comparable to values in literature.30 With the incorporation of 10% IT-MCA, the device affords an improved PCE of 13.2%, which is mostly contributed by the increased Voc (0.861 V). A best device is obtained from the 20% IT-MCA-added device, yielding a PCE of 14.0% with a Voc of 0.879 V, which is a significant improvement of 41 mV compared to that of the reference binary cell. When the IT-MCA ratio is 50%, the Voc continues increasing to 0.899 V but the PCE drops to 9.4% because of apparently reduced Jsc and FF, which can be attributed to the change in crystallization and orientation of the ternary film containing the excessive IT-MCA, as mentioned before.

To compare the best ternary device with the reference binary cell, we can see that the addition of the IT-MCA only results in a slightly increased Jsc, which is confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4b and Table 2). By comparing the EQE spectra and the absorption spectra of binary and ternary films (Fig. S6, ESI†), it can be seen that the IT-MCA component barely contributes to the photocurrent by itself. Meanwhile, a subtle increase of the FF is also presented. These observations are in agreement with slight increments in charge carrier mobility of the ternary devices relative to the reference ones, as measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Table S2 and Fig. S7, ESI†), which can be attributed to the enhancements of molecular packing and orientation in ternary films. Therefore, the PCE enhancement is mostly contributed from the increased Voc of up to 41 mV, as a result of the reduction of Eloss. The Eloss was calculated by the equation of Eloss = Eg − qVoc, where the optical bandgap (Eg) of the PM6:IT-4F blend was obtained from the intersection of the absorption and emission bands of the IT-4F (Fig. S8, ESI†).38 The overall Eloss of the PM6:IT-4F blend is evaluated to be 0.74 eV, which is reduced to 0.70 eV with the addition of 20% IT-MCA molecule. According to previous discussions, the Eloss reduction is enabled by decreasing the non-radiative recombination energy loss (ΔE3) as a result of the increased PL and EL emissions of the acceptor component, which originate from the efficient FRET process from IT-MCA to IT-4F accompanying partial contributions from the suppressed ACQ of IT-4F. It should be noted that in literature the FRET process from third component to either donor or acceptor material typically contributes to the increased Jsc owing to the additional photoinduced charge generation.36,37 In our work, the IT-MCA acts as an inert component for photoinduced charge transfer to host materials and the FRET process thus does not improve the Jsc but the Voc by intensifying the emission property of the ternary blend film. In order to further study the origin of the increased Voc, we carry out the Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S9, ESI†) to detect built-in voltages (flat-band potentials) of the binary and ternary devices, which can suggest whether the third component affects the driving force associated with the Voc of the binary host system. It is found that there is almost no change in the built-in voltage for the control binary and IT-MCA-based ternary OSCs, proving that the enhancement of Voc does not result from the upshifting LUMO level of IT-MCA. In addition, correlation of the Voc increase with the IT-MCA ratio is also established (Table S1 and Fig. S10, ESI†), showing that the Voc non-linearly improves with the increased IT-MCA ratio. This observation is quite different from the linear improvement in Voc for ternary OSCs in which an “alloy model” of dual acceptors is formed. We also notice that a fluorine-containing MCA-based third-component molecule (IBC-2F) was reported to fabricate ternary OSCs,39 leading to an enhanced PCE relative to binary cells owing to the significantly increased FF but less Voc improvement (18 mV for the best cell). In our case, the IT-MCA without fluorine atoms exhibits strong fluorescence, resulting in an apparent improvement in Voc of up to 41 mV for the best ternary devices. Additionally, non-annealed ternary devices give a PCE of 13.2% with a quite high Voc of 0.909 V. It turns out that the Eloss can be more obviously reduced without thermal annealing, which suggests that a strategy able to tune the active-layer morphology at room temperature is needed, in order to retain a high Voc.
To gain more insight into the influence of IT-MCA on charge recombination process, we measured the dependence of Jsc at various light intensities (Pin). In general, Jsc follows the power law of Jsc ∝ Pαin, where the exponential factor α refers to the degree of bimolecular recombination and when it equals to 1 the bimolecular recombination is totally suppressed. The α values are 0.986, 0.991, and 0.976 for OSCs based on PM6:IT-4F, PM6:IT-4F:IT-MCA (20%), and PM6:IT-4F:IT-MCA (50%), respectively (Fig. S11, ESI†), which reveals the more effective suppression of bimolecular recombination in the 20% IT-MCA-containing ternary OSCs. Furthermore, the light intensity dependence of Voc is also measured and the slope of Voc ∝ lnPin is used to investigate the charge recombination behavior. The slope of the optimal (20% IT-MCA) ternary OSCs is 1.14kT/q (k, q, and T are Boltzmann constant, elementary charge, and temperature, respectively), which is lower than those of binary OSCs (1.17kT/q) and 50% IT-MCA-based ternary OSCs (1.19kT/q). The data suggest that the bimolecular recombination which domains in these devices is more effectively suppressed in the optimal ternary OSCs.
Encouraged by the excellent performance of IT-MCA in the PM6:IT-4F system, we investigated its versatility in two more binary blends, PBDB-T:ITIC40 and PM6:Y641–47 (Fig. 5a, Fig. S12, Table S3, ESI†). The PL emission band of IT-MCA also overlaps with the absorption spectra of ITIC and Y6 (Fig. 5b and c), suggesting a potential FRET process in their ternary blends. Thus, we believe that the addition of IT-MCA into these two systems could also increase the EQEEL and reduce the ΔE3 of the ternary films, thus improving the Voc and PCE. The device results, as shown in Fig. 5d, e and Table 2, verify our hypothesis with the PCE improved from 9.2% to 9.7% for the PBDB-T:ITIC and from 15.5% to 16.7% for the PM6:Y6, respectively. Similar to the PM6:IT-4F host, the improvement in PCE mostly originates from the increased Voc (31 and 41 mV, respectively), in support of the general applicability of IT-MCA serving as a fluorescence intensifier to improve the performance of OSCs.

Finally, the device stability was tested. Previous reports have indicated that the addition of a third component is an efficient strategy to increase the device stability owing to the stabilized blending film morphology.39,48 In our case, the IT-MCA molecule can be miscible with the IT-4F thanks to their similar coplanar structures, which facilitates the suppression of the latter's crystallization and thus improving the ternary film morphology.49 This is believed to be able to prolong the device lifetime. We thus investigate the device stability of optimal ternary OSCs based on the PM6:IT-4F system under light (1 sun illumination), thermal stress (80 °C), and shelf-storage in nitrogen (Fig. 6). All devices for the stability test are non- encapsulated. After continuous 500 h light radiation (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), the PCE of binary devices degrades to 60% while the ternary devices still maintain 75% of its pristine values. Similarly, tests for thermal and shelf-lifetime stability also indicate that the IT-MCA-containing ternary OSCs are more durable than the reference binary ones in the aging period of 500 h. These results suggest that the introduction of IT-MCA into the binary film can not only improve the OSC efficiency but also stabilize the device under various stresses.

Conclusions
In summary, we have presented the use of a highly fluorescent molecule, IT-MCA, as a third component to reduce energy loss, improving Voc for ternary OSCs. The IT-MCA, as a fluorescence intensifier, can enhance the PLQY and EQEEL of the ternary film via an efficient FRET process from IT-MCA to IT-4F, resulting in the reduced non-radiative recombination energy loss. Meanwhile, with the addition of appropriate amount of IT-MCA (20%) into the binary host, the ternary blending film acquires enhanced face-on orientation without obvious change in morphology. When the IT-MCA is applied to three donor:acceptor host systems, the ternary OSCs yield enhanced Voc and PCE compared to the binary counterparts. A highest PCE of 16.7% is acquired for PM6:Y6:IT-MCA-based ternary OSCs. Moreover, the introduction of IT-MCA can improve the device stability under shelf-storage, light illumination, and heat. Our work provides a new strategy for reducing the non-radiative recombination energy loss of ternary OSCs by incorporating a high-fluorescence third component, enabling improved Voc and device performance.

New concepts
Reducing the non-radiative recombination energy loss (Eloss) to improve the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has become a significant way to increase the device efficiency. In this work, a highly fluorescent molecule acting as a fluorescence intensifier was introduced into ternary OSCs to reduce the Eloss, thus improving the Voc of devices. The newly synthesized molecule named IT-MCA possessing a high photoluminescence quantum yield in the film enhances fluorescent emission and electroluminescene quantum efficiency of the ternary film via the Förster resonance energy transfer to the acceptor component. The non-radiative recombination Eloss is thus reduced, resulting in an improved Voc of up to 41 mV and a PCE of 16.7% is achieved from ternary devices with improved stability. This work proposes a new method of fluorescence intensifier-induced Voc increase of ternary OSCs for the first time, leading to a great Voc increase in different binary host systems.
