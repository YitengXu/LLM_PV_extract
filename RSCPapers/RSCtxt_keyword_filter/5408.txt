    , Accepted 9th January 2017First published on 10th January 2017AbstractSolution-processed small molecule solar cells (SMSCs) are fabricated based on DRCN5T:PC71BM as active layers, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is markedly increased from 3.63% to 9.11% for the active layers undergoing up-side-down thermal annealing and solvent vapor annealing post-treatments. The PCE improvement should be attributed to the appropriate phase separation consisting of enhanced crystallinity of donor and purified acceptor domain at nanoscale. The nematic liquid crystal small molecule BTR is selected as the second donor and morphology regulator to prepare ternary SMSCs. The champion PCE of ternary SMSCs was improved to 10.05% by mixing 1.5 wt% BTR, which corresponds to a 10.3% PCE improvement compared with the optimized binary SMSCs. The performance improvement is mainly attributed to the further optimized phase separation and complementary photon harvesting between DRCN5T and BTR, which could be well demonstrated from absorption spectra, two dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
Introduction
During the past few years, bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) have achieved great progress based on the synergistic developments of molecular design, morphological optimization, interfacial modification and device structure.1–4 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have already exceeded 10%, even up to 11.7% for polymer solar cells.5–8 However, it is a great challenge to precisely control the degree of polymerization and polydispersity index batch by batch and the related optoelectronic characteristics from the aspect of polymer synthesis. Compared with the polymer counterparts, the small molecule materials exhibit some outstanding advantages, such as a well-defined molecular structure, less batch-to-batch variation and easier purification/synthesis. Chen and coworkers have successfully synthesized a series of highly efficient small molecule photovoltaic materials, which exhibit PCEs more than 9% working with fullerene derivatives as electron acceptors.9–12 The PCEs of small molecule solar cells (SMSCs) can be significantly improved by employing some treatments, such as thermal annealing (TA), solvent vapor annealing (SVA) and solvent additive processing, on active layers leading to enhanced donor crystallinity and optimized phase separation.13–15 Ge et al. successfully designed and synthesized a series of non-conjugated small-molecule electrolytes as efficient cathode interlayers to enhance charge carrier collection and improve the performance of PSCs.16–18 By flipping the substrate up-side-down to make active layer growth (hereafter named the “up-side-down” method), the up-side-down drying method has been demonstrated as an effective strategy to optimize vertical phase separation driven by capillary force which derives from the surface tension of the interstitial solvent.19–21 Lu et al. also reported the positive effect of up-side-down drying treatment on the performance of P3HT:PC61BM-based OSCs, which is attributed to the optimized crystallization and surface morphology of active layers during the up-side-down drying process and the following normal thermal annealing.22 It should be expected that the up-side-down thermal annealing (DTA) or up-side-down solvent vapor annealing (DSVA) treatment can not only maintain the advantages of TA or SVA treatment, but also optimize vertical phase separation driven by the gravity and capillary force during the up-side-down process. In general, the crystallinity of small molecule donor can be enhanced by post-treatments, which is beneficial to form the well-ordered donor molecular arrangement and relatively pure acceptor domain at the nanoscale. The optimized phase separation is the prerequisite to yield high performance of SMSCs, especially for ternary OSCs.
Recently, a ternary strategy has been demonstrated as an effective method to further improve the performance of solar cells by increasing photon harvesting, especially for two donors and one acceptor system.23–25 The introduction of the third component would result in a more complex morphology in ternary active layers due to the existence of multiple phases at multi-length scales. More recombination centers or morphological traps may be formed, which results in the decreased charge carrier transport and low fill factor (FF).26,27 Therefore, the morphological control plays a crucial role in obtaining highly efficient ternary SMSCs, which strongly depends on post-treatments and the miscibility of materials. For the selection of the third component, the popular strategy is employing two donors with molecular miscibility and complementary absorption to design parallel-linkage structures or alloy model ternary OSCs.28–31 In addition, high-crystallinity or high-mobility materials were selected as the third component to fabricate highly efficient ternary OSCs by optimizing the morphology or improving charge carrier transport in ternary active layers.32,33 As a matter of fact, most investigations are based on the efficient ternary polymer solar cells (PSCs) by mixing a polymer or small molecule material as the second donor or acceptor.34–36 A 10–20% PCE improvement is generally realized by employing ternary strategy, leading to the PCE exceeding 10% for ternary PSCs.37,38 However, it is rarely reported for ternary SMSCs with PCE close to 10%, which is a challenge for SMSCs compared with PSCs. In this work, a series of binary SMSCs were fabricated with (2,2′-((5Z,5′Z)-5,5′-((3,3′′′,3′′′′,4′-tetraoctyl-[2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′:5′′′,2′′′′-quinquethiophene]-5,5′′′′-diyl)bis(methanyly-lidene))bis(3-ethyl-4-oxothiazolidine-5,2-diylidene))dimalononitrile) (DRCN5T):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) (DRCN5T:PC71BM) as active layers undergoing different post-treatments. The PCEs of binary SMSCs were markedly improved from 3.63% to 9.11% by employing DTA and DSVA treatments. The PCE improvement is attributed to the enhanced DRCN5T crystallinity and optimized vertical phase separation. The nematic liquid crystal small molecule benzodithiophene terthiophene rhodanine (BTR) has been demonstrated as an efficient photovoltaic material.39–41 Based on the optimized binary SMSCs, BTR was selected as the second donor and morphology regulator to prepare ternary SMSCs because the BTR molecule may induce DRCN5T molecular crystallinity and enhance photon harvesting due to their complementary absorption. The most important is that the phase separation of ternary active layers may be optimized by mixing different amounts of BTR. The champion PCE of ternary SMSCs was improved to 10.05% by mixing 1.5 wt% BTR and employing DTA and DSVA treatments, which should be among the highest values reported for ternary SMSCs. Fig. 1 presents the chemical structure of used materials, schematic illustration of the device architecture, and different post-treatment methods on active layers. The experimental details are described in the ESI.†

Results and discussion
Optimizing post-treatments technology to improve performance of binary SMSCs
Binary SMSCs were fabricated with DRCN5T:PC71BM (1:0.8, wt/wt) as active layers and the only difference is active layer post-treatment conditions. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves of SMSCs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, as exhibited in Fig. 2a. It is apparent that the SMSCs without any post-treatment on active layers exhibited a rather low PCE of 3.63%, along with an open voltage (VOC) of 0.99 V, short circuit current density (JSC) of 7.40 mA cm−2 and FF of 49.6%. The PCE values of SMSCs were markedly improved to 8.08% for the active layers with TA treatment or 8.41% for the active layers with DTA treatment. It is apparent that the effect of DTA treatment on performance is better than that of TA treatment, which may be attributed to the optimized vertical phase separation. The champion PCE of SMSCs was further increased to 9.11% for the active layers with DTA and DSVA treatments. The VOC values are decreased from 0.99 V to 0.91 V for the active layers with DTA and DSVA treatments, which is similar to the results of other literature.42–44 The reduction of VOC is mainly attributed to the lowering in quasi-Fermi levels for electron and hole transport due to a depleted steady carrier density caused by the variety of DRCN5T molecular packing as well as the film morphology.45 The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all binary SMSCs were measured and are shown in Fig. 2b. The EQE spectra of SMSCs were markedly enhanced in the whole spectral range for the active layers with different post-treatments, which may be attributed to the increased photon harvesting and the optimized phase separation. By integrating the corresponding EQE spectra, the fitted JSC values of SMSCs are 6.93, 13.69, 14.15 and 15.01 mA cm−2, respectively, for active layers with different post-treatments, as exhibited in Fig. 2b. The fitted JSC values are 5%–6% mismatch compared with the values obtained from J–V curves, the decreased JSC may be due to cell degradation during EQE spectra measurement under air conditions. The series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (RSH) of SMSCs were calculated according to the J–V curves under light illumination to investigate charge carrier transport and collection. The RS of SMSCs were markedly decreased for the active layers with post-treatments, even to 4.5 Ω cm2 with DTA and DSVA treatments. The decreased RS should be beneficial to charge carrier transport in active layers.46 Meanwhile, the RSH of SMSCs were increased to 549 Ω cm2 for the active layers with DTA and DSVA treatments, indicating that the leakage current can be effectively constrained due to the optimized morphology.47 It is known that FF is a very sensitive parameter to evaluate charge carrier transport and collection. The increased FF values should be attributed to the more efficient charge carrier transport and collection for the active layers with TA treatment, especially with DTA and DSVA treatments. To intuitively observe the effect of post-treatment conditions on the performance of SMSCs, key photovoltaic parameters of all SMSCs are listed in Table 1. The absorption spectra of blend films with different post-treatments were measured and are shown in Fig. 3a. It is obvious that the absorption intensity of blend films was enhanced by DTA treatment and further enhanced by the following DSVA treatment. Meanwhile, the characteristic absorption peaks at 375 nm and 685 nm were markedly increased by post-treatments due to the enhanced π–π stacking of DRCN5T. To further confirm this phenomenon, absorption spectra of neat DRCN5T films with different post-treatments were measured, as shown in Fig. 3b. It is clearer that the similar phenomenon can be observed from the neat films, suggesting that the enhanced absorption intensity should be due to a more ordered DRCN5T molecular arrangement. Two dimensional grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXD) was performed to further investigate the effect of post-treatments on molecular arrangement in blend films, as exhibited in Fig. S1.† The out-of-plane line-cuts abstracted from 2D-GIXD patterns are exhibited in Fig. 3c. The (100) diffraction intensity of the blend film was increased by TA treatment, especially for the blend film with DTA and DSVA treatments. The enhanced (100) diffraction intensity also indicates the more ordered DRCN5T molecular arrangement in blend films with DTA and DSVA treatments. The variation of molecular arrangement should influence the morphology of blend films, which was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as exhibited in Fig. 3d. No featured morphology can be observed for the blend film without any post-treatment. Some fibril structure becomes more and more obvious for blend films with TA or DTA treatment. The bright and dark regions in the TEM images correspond to the DRCN5T-rich and PC71BM-rich domains, respectively.48 The donor and acceptor bi-continuous interpenetrating network may be further optimized by DTA and DSVA treatments, and donor molecule crystallinity can be enhanced along with a purified PC71BM domain at the nanoscale. The vertical phase separation of the blend film can be optimized by DTA and DSVA treatments. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on the blend films without or with DTA and DSVA treatments, as shown in Fig. S2.† The S is the characteristic atom of DRCN5T. Therefore, the ratio of S (2p)/C (1s) is closely correlated with the PC71BM content near the top surface of blend films. The ratio of S (2p)/C (1s) near the top surface of blend films is decreased from 0.048 to 0.044 by DTA and DSVA treatments. The weight ratios of DRCN5T:PC71BM can be calculated according to the ratios of S (2p)/C (1s) near the top surface of blend films. The calculated weight ratio of DRCN5T:PC71BM is approximately 1:0.75 or 1:0.87 for the blend films without or with DTA and DSVA treatments. The calculated values are very close to the real weight ratio (1:0.8) of DRCN5T:PC71BM in their blend solution. The decreased S (2p)/C (1s) ratio indicates that more PC71BM could be elevated towards the top surface of the blend film with DTA and DSVA treatments, resulting in appropriate vertical phase separation for the efficient charge carrier transport and collection.

For binary SMSCs with different post-treatments on active layers, the PCE was markedly improved from 3.63% for the active layer without any post-treatment to 9.11% for the active layer with DTA and DSVA treatments. The underlying reason for PCE improvement is mainly ascribed to the optimized phase separation driven by DRCN5T molecular crystallinity during post-treatments. It means that donor molecular crystallinity may be beneficial to optimize phase separation with the purified PC71BM domain at the nanoscale.49 Inspired by this experimental result, it may be a smart strategy to enhance donor molecular crystallinity by mixing the nematic liquid crystal small molecule as a morphology regulator, resulting in the optimized phase separation. In this work, the nematic liquid crystal small molecule BTR was selected as the second donor and morphology regulator to prepare ternary SMSCs. Meanwhile, BTR has a relatively high absorption coefficient and complementary absorption spectra with DRCN5T. A series of ternary SMSCs were prepared with DRCN5T, BTR as donors and PC71BM as the acceptor. The weight ratio of donors to acceptor was kept constant as 1:0.8 and the only difference is the amount of BTR. On the basis of the optimal post-treatment conditions on binary active layers, all ternary active layers were successively treated by DTA and DSVA treatments to optimize phase separation.
Adopting ternary strategy to further improve the performance of SMSCs
The J–V curves of ternary SMSCs with different amounts of BTR were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and are shown in Fig. 4a. It is apparent that JSC values of ternary SMSCs were increased and then decreased along with the increase of the BTR amount. The VOC values of ternary SMSCs were almost kept constant with 0.01 V deviation. For the DRCN5T:PC71BM and BTR:PC71BM-based SMSCs, the similar VOC indicates that hole transfer between DRCN5T and BTR should be effective due to the smooth highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels, which is beneficial to hole transport in ternary active layers. The HOMO barrier between DRCN5T and BTR is about 0.06 eV according to the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement of neat films, as shown in Fig. S3.† The calculated values are listed in Table S1.† The FF values of SMSCs were markedly increased from 63.5% to 67.5% by mixing 1.5 wt% BTR, which should be due to the optimized charge carrier transport channels in ternary active layers. It can be further confirmed from the decreased RS (from 4.5 to 3.0 Ω cm2) and the increased RSH (from 549 to 834 Ω cm2). For the optimized ternary SMSCs with 1.5 wt% BTR in donors, the champion PCE approached 10.05%, along with a JSC of 16.12 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.90 V and a FF of 67.5%. The SMSCs without any encapsulation were sent to the National Institute of Metrology (NIM), China for certification. A certified PCE of 9.38% was obtained with a JSC of 15.11 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.92 V, and FF of 67.5%, as shown in Fig. S4 and S5.† The averaged PCE of the optimized ternary SMSCs was 10.01% based on 30 cells prepared from different batches. The certified PCE of SMSC differs by ∼6% from the average PCE value measured in high-purity nitrogen-filled glove box. Among the key photovoltaic parameters, the decreased JSC should be mainly due to the degradation of cells without any encapsulation testing under air conditions. BTR:PC71BM-based SMSCs exhibited a high FF of 73.5%, suggesting an ideal phase separation for efficient charge carrier transport and collection. The EQE spectra of ternary SMSCs were measured to further confirm the positive effect of the BTR amount on performance improvement, as shown in Fig. 4b. A spectrally flat EQE over 70% from 350 nm to 650 nm was observed for BTR:PC71BM-based SMSCs with ∼250 nm active layers, which should be attributed to different charge carrier collection efficiency for the incident light with different wavelengths in the thick active layers. The thickness of the BTR:PC71BM blend film was measured and is shown in Fig. S6.†50,51 The similar phenomenon was also reported in the previous studies on BTR:PC71BM-based SMSCs.40 It is apparent that EQE spectra of ternary SMSCs were continuously improved in the whole spectral range along with the BTR amount up to 1.5 wt%. It can be mainly attributed to two factors: (i) enhanced photon harvesting by BTR in the short wavelength range; (ii) the optimized phase separation for efficient charge carrier transport and collection. When the BTR amount is larger than 1.5 wt%, the EQE spectra were markedly decreased due to the disrupted charge carrier transport channels in ternary active layers. Fig. 4c shows the absorption spectra of blend films with different amounts of BTR. The thickness of the optimized binary and ternary blend films is approximately 120 nm under the same preparation conditions due to the rather low amount of BTR, as shown in Fig. S7.† There is an apparent spectral overlap between BTR and DRCN5T in the short wavelength range. The normalized absorption spectra of neat BTR, DRCN5T and PC71BM films are shown in the inset of Fig. 4c. The small molecule BTR exhibits a relatively narrow absorption range with two absorption peaks at 575 nm and 620 nm. The small molecule DRCN5T exhibits a relatively broad absorption range with absorption peak at 700 nm. The maximal extinction coefficients (ε) at absorption peak are 7.5 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 1.1 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for DRCN5T and BTR, respectively.9,40 It means that mixing BTR can complement the photon harvesting in the short wavelength range for ternary blend films. In fact, the contribution of BTR on photon harvesting in the short wavelength range should be weak due to the low amount of BTR. The absorption intensity of ternary blend films was slightly enhanced in the whole spectral range by mixing BTR, which should be due to DRCN5T molecular arrangement variation in ternary blend films,52,53 because BTR has almost no absorption for light with wavelengths longer than 680 nm. To intuitively exhibit the effect of BTR and active layer post-treatment methods on performance of SMSCs, the relative variation of key parameters of all SMSCs compared with the optimized binary SMSCs are described in Fig. 4d. Obviously, the performance of SMSCs can be further improved by employing the ternary strategy; about 10.3% PCE improvement was obtained compared with the optimized binary SMSCs. According to the J–V curves and EQE spectra of SMSCs with different amounts of BTR, the key photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2.

The 2D-GIXD was employed to further investigate molecular crystallinity or arrangement in ternary blend films, as depicted in Fig. S8.† The out-of-plane line-cuts of neat DRCN5T and BTR films are shown in Fig. 5a. The (100) diffraction peak intensity of the neat BTR film is much stronger than that of the neat DRCN5T film, indicating the more ordered molecular arrangement of BTR compared with DRCN5T in the neat films. The little difference between qz = 0.32 Å−1 for the neat BTR film and qz = 0.33 Å−1 for DRCN5T may be mainly due to the different side chain length. Meanwhile, an obvious π–π stacking (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.65 Å−1 can be observed for the neat BTR film along the out-of-plane direction, suggesting the occurrence of face-on orientation of small molecule BTR. The in-plane line-cut of neat BTR films abstracted from 2D-GXID patterns is shown in Fig. S9.† The occurrence of a face-on orientation can be confirmed from the (010) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane line-cut and the (100) diffraction peak in the in-plane line-cut. The high-crystallinity small molecule BTR may induce DRCN5T molecule ordered packing in ternary blend films. The out-of-plane line-cuts of blend films with different amounts of BTR are shown in Fig. 5b. All blend films exhibit an obvious (100) diffraction peak at qz = 0.33 Å−1, corresponding to DRCN5T crystallinity with a d-spacing of 18.7 Å−1. The intensity of the (100) diffraction peak is gradually enhanced along with the BTR amount up to 1.5 wt% and then decreased with increasing BTR amount. It means that the DRCN5T crystallinity degree can be slightly improved by mixing a small amount of BTR, which may be beneficial to form appropriate phase separation in ternary blend films. This phenomenon is very similar to that of the binary active layers with different post-treatments, as shown in Fig. 3c. According to the Scherrer equation, the crystal coherence length (CCL) can be estimated to be 16.9 nm and 20.1 nm for the optimized binary blend film and ternary blend film with 1.5 wt% BTR, respectively.54,55 The increased CCL is consistent with the well-developed nanofibrillar structure in ternary blend films. The TEM was used to investigate the bulk morphology of blend films with different amounts of BTR, as shown in Fig. 5c. A nanofibrillar structure with a relatively small phase separation could be observed for the optimized binary blend film. The well-developed nanofibrillar structure with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network can be clearly observed for the ternary blend film with 1.5 wt% BTR. The appropriate phase separation should be beneficial to efficient charge carrier transport and exciton dissociation. An excessive phase separation can be observed with a large donor or acceptor domain size for the ternary blend film with 5.0 wt% BTR, resulting in the inefficient exciton dissociation.

The balance of charge carrier transport is also a key parameter for determining the performance of solar cells. The J–V curves of hole-only and electron-only devices were measured in the dark, as exhibited in Fig. 6a and b. The hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) were calculated according to the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.56 The μh and μe were slightly increased and then decreased along with the increase of the BTR amount. It means that charge carrier transport channels can be optimized by adjusting the BTR amount. The μh/μe of 1.12 indicates more balanced charge carrier transport in the ternary active layer with 1.5 wt% BTR, resulting in the highest FF for the corresponding ternary SMSCs. The experimental results indicate that BTR can be an excellent morphology regulator to form more effective bi-continuous interpenetrating network for charge carrier transport in ternary active layers.

The J–V curves of the optimized binary and ternary SMSCs were measured under different light intensities, as shown in Fig. 7a and b. According to J–V curves, JSC dependent on light intensity is described in Fig. 7c. A power law dependence of JSC on light intensity can be generally expressed as JSC ∝ Iα in organic solar cells.57 Here, I is light intensity and α is the exponential factor which is close to unity when bimolecular recombination is negligible in the active layer. The α value for the optimized ternary SMSCs is 0.96, which is larger than 0.91 for the optimized binary SMSCs, suggesting that charge carrier recombination can be effectively suppressed by mixing 1.5 wt% BTR due to the optimized phase separation.

In addition to the enhanced photon harvesting and optimized phase separation by mixing the appropriate BTR, the intermolecular interaction between DRCN5T and BTR was investigated to clarify the working mechanism of ternary SMSCs. The normalized absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat DRCN5T and BTR films are depicted in Fig. 8a. There is an apparent spectral overlap between the DRCN5T absorption spectrum and BTR PL spectrum, which means that energy transfer from BTR to DRCN5T may occur according to the Förster resonance energy transfer theory.58 The PL spectra of DRCN5T:BTR blend films with different amounts of BTR were investigated, as shown in Fig. 8b. The PL emission peak of neat DRCN5T and BTR is located at 770 nm and 700 nm, respectively. The 770 nm PL intensity of blend films is continuously enhanced along with the increase of the BTR amount, which should be attributed to the energy transfer from BTR to DRCN5T. Gupta et al. also reported the energy transfer in the PTB7:PCDTBT system based on their PL spectra with a similar phenomenon.58 Meanwhile, the PL spectra of blend films also exhibit a slight blue-shift along with the increase of the BTR amount, which may be due to the PL spectral overlap between BTR and DRCN5T or the molecular arrangement variation of DRCN5T. A similar phenomenon was also observed in the blend solutions with different amounts of BTR, as shown in Fig. S10.†

The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra of neat and blend films were measured by monitoring 770 nm emission to confirm energy transfer from BTR to DRCN5T, as depicted in Fig. 8c. A detailed information on the calculation of fluorescence lifetime has been described in the ESI.† The emission lifetime of neat DRCN5T and BTR is 4.64 ns and 9.86 ns, respectively. The emission lifetime of blend films is monotonically increased along with the increase of the BTR amount, even up to 10.1 ns for the blend film with 5.0 wt% BTR. The prolonged emission lifetime further indicates the existence of energy transfer from BTR to DRCN5T, which may provide a potential route for improving BTR exciton utilization efficiency. The J–V curves of cells with DRCN5T, BTR or DRCN5T:BTR as active layers were measured, as shown in Fig. S11.† The JSC values of the DRCN5T:BTR-based cell are in between that of the DRCN5T-based cell and BTR-based cell, suggesting that the charge transfer at the DRCN5T/BTR interface should be neglected. Based on the above analysis, the potential processes of charge carriers and excitons in ternary active layers can be schematically described in Fig. 8d. The excitons on BTR can be directly dissociated into free charge carriers at the BTR/PC71BM interface or transfer its energy to DRCN5T following exciton dissociation at the DRCN5T/PC71BM interface. Both processes can contribute to the performance improvement of cells. The photogenerated holes can be efficiently transported along DRCN5T with high crystallinity assisted by mixing appropriate BTR and employing post-treatments. The photogenerated electrons will be transported along the channels formed by PC71BM. The experimental results indicate that it is practical to improve SMSCs performance by the synergetic effect of mixing a small amount of liquid crystal material and employing appropriate post-treatments. The DTA and DSVA methods should be efficient and simple strategies to optimize the morphology and molecular arrangement during the active layer formation process.
Conclusions
In summary, the PCE of DRCN5T:PC71BM-based SMSCs was markedly improved for active layers with DTA and DSVA treatments due to the enhanced crystallinity of DRCN5T and purified PC71BM domain at the nanoscale. The PCE arrives to 9.11% with a JSC of 15.77 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.91 V and a FF of 63.5% for the optimized binary SMSCs. Based on the optimal active layer post-treatment conditions, nematic liquid crystal small molecule BTR was selected as the second donor and morphology regulator to further improve the performance of SMSCs. The champion PCE of ternary SMSCs arrives to 10.05% with a JSC of 16.54 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.90 V and a FF of 67.5% when the BTR amount is increased to 1.5 wt%. The performance improvement of ternary SMSCs should be mainly attributed to the enhanced photon harvesting and optimized phase separation with the purified acceptor domain at the nanoscale by mixing appropriate amount of BTR. Experimental results indicate that using a liquid crystal material as the second donor may be an effective strategy to improve the performance of ternary solar cells. The up-side-down solvent vapor and thermal annealing treatment should be an efficient and simple strategy to optimize the morphology of active layers for obtaining highly efficient organic solar cells.
