    , Accepted 8th January 2016First published on 12th January 2016AbstractSolar cells based on organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites have been proven to be one of the most promising candidates for the next generation thin film photovoltaic cells. Mixing Br or Cl into I-based perovskites has been frequently tried to enhance the cell efficiency and stability. One of the advantages of mixed halides is the modulation of band gap by controlling the composition of the incorporated halides. However, the reported band gap transition behavior has not been resolved yet. Here a theoretical model is presented to understand the electronic structure variation of metal mixed-halide perovskites through hybrid density functional theory. Comparative calculations in this work suggest that the band gap correction including spin–orbit interaction is essential to describe the band gap changes of mixed halides. In our model, both the lattice variation and the orbital interactions between metal and halides play key roles to determine band gap changes and band alignments of mixed halides. It is also presented that the band gap of mixed halide thin films can be significantly affected by the distribution of halide composition.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention as emerging cost-effective thin film photovoltaic absorbing materials. Since the Miyasaka group first implemented methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3+) lead tri-iodide (MAPbI3) as a sensitizer of dye sensitized solar cells,1 there has been a dramatic increase of the power conversion efficiency of perovskite based solar cells, which has already reached over 20% by the Seok group.2 The unprecedented fast evolution of perovskite solar cells can be attributed to the development of easy fabrication methods3–8 and the immunity against defects.9–12
To enhance the solar cell efficiency, the electronic band gap engineering is essential. The electronic properties of organic–inorganic hybrid metal halide perovskites (ABX3) can be manipulated by changing their constituents, cationic organic molecules,13–15 cationic metals, and anionic halides.4,16,17 The compositional variation of organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites (OIPVKs) exhibits various band changes. It is reported that Sn substitution for Pb makes the band gap smaller than 1.3 eV.18,19 Although exchanging the cationic molecule does not affect the formation of conduction and valence band edges directly, the inorganic frame change induced by cationic molecules is quite relevant with band gap changes of OIPVKs.20–23 Noh et al.16 showed that colors of OIPVKs can be successfully engineered by alloying Br to MAPbI3, which makes the band gap wider from 1.55 eV to 2.28 eV, and the stability can be enhanced by Br incorporation. Moreover, Snaith group's famous work triggering explosive interests on perovskite solar cells was achieved with the incorporation of chloride into MAPbI3. Subsequent experimental works reported that Cl enhances grain growth as well as solar cell efficiency.9,16,24,25
The band gap transition of mixed halide perovskites shows somewhat complex behaviors. It is reported that Br incorporation into MAPbI3 can successfully manipulate band gap according to its alloying ratio.16 On the other hand, Cl inclusion into MAPbI3 seldom affects the band gap of OIPVKs.4,25 Former X-ray diffraction analysis and theoretical investigation presented that Cl incorporation into MAPbI3 is restricted below 4%25 and this small amount of chloride formation was ascribed to the origin of little band gap changes.
However, the band gap variation issues for mixed halides are still under debate considering recent experiments and theoretical studies. Recently, Starr et al. demonstrated that there is a highly concentrated Cl region in the bottom half of the perovskites or near the perovskite/TiO2 interface.26 Moreover, previous theoretical studies using conventional density functional theory (DFT) revealed that the band gap may not be changed by Cl incorporation into MAPbI3 for certain optimized lattice structures.25,27 As the precise concentration and location are hardly controlled by experiments, theoretical investigation based on ideal lattice structures can be helpful to understand the real role of mixing halides in the band gap transition of OIPVKs.
Prior studies on the band edge alignment among mixed halides are also interesting.28–31 Considering only the chemical bond characteristics between Pb and halide, it is easily expected that the incorporation of Cl or Br may mainly affect the valence band maximum (VBM) rather than the conduction band minimum (CBM) as the CBM mainly consists of Pb-6p orbitals.11,32 However, it was previously shown that the energy level of CBM is also affected by the replacement of I with Cl or Br,28–31 which becomes more remarkable for MASnI3−xBrx which shows VBM alignment.18
In our previous work, we showed that one of the key factors to determine the band edge position and the electronic structure of OIPVKs is inorganic lattice changes or inorganic frame transformation.20 Without considering the effect of inorganic lattice changes on mixed halide perovskites, the theoretical model cannot explain the above mentioned complex band gap transition behaviours in mixed-halide hybrid perovskites. Here, we present a theoretical model including inorganic frame impact to understand the band gap modulation and band edge alignment of mixed halide hybrid perovskites observed in experiments and suggest appropriate theoretical methods. Theoretical investigations with first principle calculations have been successfully applied to reveal the physical origin of the unique features of OIPVKs.33–43 Based on our theoretical findings, the importance of the distribution control of mixed halides will also be suggested.
Numerical methods
Electronic structures and optimum lattice structures are computed with the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP)44,45 using the modified Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof generalized gradient approximation (PBEsol-GGA).46 The PBEsol exchange correlation is efficient to predict the experimental lattice constants. The projector-augmented wave (PAW) method is used to describe the core–valence interaction.47 The cutoff energy of the computation is 500 eV and 5d-electrons of Pb are considered as valence charges. To overcome band gap underestimation for the spin–orbit calculation of OIPVKs, the Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof (HSE06)48 hybrid functional is adopted. The value of the screening parameters for HSE is 0.2 and those of the mixing parameters are 0.35 and 0.5 for cationic molecule systems and effective charge models, respectively. The optimum lattice constants of cubic and tetragonal systems are obtained with k-points generated by 6 × 6 × 6 and 4 × 4 × 4 Γ-point centered Monkhorst–Pack sampling.
Results and discussion
The inorganic frame model neglecting cationic molecules is used to exclude the complexity resulted from cationic molecules as shown in Fig. 1a, which was successfully adopted to analyze the band gap transition behaviors in our previous study.20 To compensate the absence of cationic molecules, an electron is added per removed cationic molecule and resulted band structures agreed well with those considering cationic molecules.

(b) HFSO predicted band gap variations according to volume changes for [PbI3]−, [PbI2Br]−, and [PbI2Cl]−. “(z)” represents only z-directional volume changes. 
The lattice structures and calculated band gaps are listed in Table 1. The upper and lower panels of Table 1 represent the tetragonal lattice constants and band gaps of methylammonium lead halides including cationic molecules and those of cubic inorganic frame models without considering cationic molecules, respectively. The lattice constants for inorganic frame models without considering cation molecules are set to correspond to the experimental volumes. The GGA band gaps are obtained with the PBEsol exchange correlation functional without considering the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) interaction. It is already known that the similar band gap in experimental and conventional GGA-DFT calculations originates from error cancelation, a compromise between band gap underestimation by the GGA band gap and overestimation from neglecting the spin–orbit interaction.49 The GGA-predicted band gap of MAPbI3 is overestimated while that of MAPbCl3 is underestimated with PBEsol comparing with the experiments. As it can be observed from the values of MAPbI2Br and MAPbI2Cl in the table, the GGA predicted band gaps of mixed halides are seldom affected by halide alloying, which are consistent with previous calculations using GGA exchange correlation.27

Hybrid density functional scheme, HSE06 coupled with SOC (HFSO), is applied to correct the underestimation of band gap for chlorides, which predicts that the band gaps of MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 are closer to experimental values. The HFSO band gap increment of MAPbI2Br (0.2 eV band gap difference with MAPbI3) is quite similar to that of the experimental value16 (0.16 eV band gap difference). Although the band gap changes by mixing halides can be reproduced by considering SOC only, the band gap changes from MAPbI3 to MAPbBr3 and MAPbCl3 are not enough to reflect those of experiments and HFSO calculations.
Our HFSO calculation results indicate that the band gap of mixed halides increases with the addition of Br or Cl in contrast to conventional DFT or SOC only calculations which cannot give the quantitative estimation of band gap transition. Especially, the band gap of MAPbI2Cl should be increased by 0.25 eV than that of MAPbI3.
The band gap tuning made by mixing halides comes from not only alloying effects but also lattice constant changes or volume changes. It is already shown in our previous study that the band gap of OIPVK is sensitive to changes in the lattice constant and increases with volume expansion.20 Therefore, in order to precisely understand the band gap tuning mechanism in mixed halide perovskites, the contribution of compositional changes should be decoupled with that of volume changes.

Fig. 1b shows the band gap variations of MAPbI3, MAPbI2Br, and MAPbI2Cl according to volume changes. The maximum (249 Å3) and minimum values (226 Å3) are set to the optimized volume for MAPbI3 and MAPbI2Cl, respectively. The lattice constant of [PbI3]− is obtained by the optimization of the cubic MAPbI3 phase and set as a maximum value. The minimum value represents the lattice constants of MAPbI2Cl, the lattice structure of which is cubic, and it is obtained by dividing the optimized volume of MAPbI2Cl by the number of unit-lattices. To focus on the bonding length between Pb and halides, the lattice symmetry is kept to have cubic structures and the resulted lattice constants are given in Table 1. As the lattice constants of MAPbI2Cl change only along the z-direction comparing with those of MAPbI3 according to Lee et al.'s work,4 we consider another volume change mode, z-axis contraction without change of x and y directional lattice constants which are denoted with open symbols in the figure and (z) in the legend.
The band gap variations with volume clearly show the competition between the band gap widening by compositional changes with Br/Cl and the band gap narrowing by volume contraction originated from reduction of the bond length. Because of the antibonding characteristics of CBM and VBM between Pb and halides and the sensitiveness of VBM to the lattice strain over that of CBM, the band gap becomes wider under tensile strain.20Fig. 1b shows that band gap changes with its volume are quite similar among [PbI3]−, [PbI2Br]−, and [PbI2Cl]− (0.017, 0.015, and 0.015 eV Å−3 respectively). This trend represents that the band gap changes with volume changes can be generally predicted irrespective of its composition for OIPVKs.
The band gap of OIPVKs can be tuned by incorporating Br or Cl into the I position. When I is partially replaced by Br or Cl without lattice contraction, the resulting band gaps largely increase to be 1.74 and 1.92 eV, respectively. But this compositional contribution to band gap change diminishes due to lattice contraction. Assuming that the volumes of [PbI2Br]− and [PbI2Cl]− keeping cubic structures decrease until their optimum volumes, their band gaps are reduced to 1.49 and 1.48 eV, which become similar with the band gap of [PbI3]−, 1.45 eV.
As already mentioned, the experimental results reported that the addition of Cl changes mainly the z-directional lattice constant. Thus, it is more plausible that the real lattice structures of mixed halides follow the tetragonal lattice symmetry (open symbols in Fig. 1b). The z-directional lattice constant changes induce smaller band changes so that the band gaps of [PbI2Br]− and [PbI2Cl]− become wider than that of [PbI3]− by 0.11 and 0.23 eV, respectively. Therefore, we can conclude that the band gap tuning by Br or Cl incorporation into MAPbI3, mixed halide perovskites, should be wider with the incorporation ratio of Br and Cl.
The origin of the band edge alignment issue in mixed halides can be successfully understood based on our findings. Contrary to the expectation based on the orbital interaction characteristics between Pb and halides, the incorporation of Br/Cl induces the remarkable changes of CBM.18,29Fig. 2 represents the unique band edge alignment of mixed halide perovskites based on our model. Without considering the lattice change, Br or Cl mixing affects only the energy level of VBM by compositional contribution (Ecomp) while CBMs are aligned. The density of states of each mixed halide can be found in the ESI.† However, as the lattice constants become shorter by replacing I by Br or Cl, the energy levels of both CBM and VBM increase due to antibonding characteristics.20 This is the origin of the unique band edge alignment of mixed halides. As the change of VBM energy (EVB,strain) is more sensitive to lattice changes than that of CBM (ECB,strain), the magnitude of band gap widening becomes smaller than that without lattice changes.
 Fig. 2  The origin of band edge alignment among mixed halide perovskites. The left panel represents the band edge alignment without lattice changes and the right panel shows the band edge movement and the band gap narrowing induced by lattice contraction. 
Although our theoretical results show that the band gap of MAPbI3 can be tuned by the incorporation of Cl, there is still an unresolved issue about the origin of the negligible band gap change by Cl inclusion observed in the experiments. The minute change of the band gap may be ascribed to the small solution limit of Cl into MAPbI3.25 According to experimental reports, Cl is seldom detected at the surface and there can be a Cl segregated region within perovskite layers.26 Therefore, we paid attention to the role of the distribution of mixed halides within thin films rather than to the atomic position in the symmetry points which was the common point of view in previous theoretical works.25,27
To investigate the effect of Cl distributions on the band gap of MAPbI2Cl, supercell models are made by forming a 1 × 1 × 9 cubic PbI3 supercell as shown in Fig. 3a. Fig. 3a and b–d represents the models for MAPbI3 and MAPbI2Cl, respectively. Lattice constants are fixed as the size of the optimum cubic lattice of MAPbI3. Chloride segregation is modeled with heterojunction between [PbI3]− and [PbCl3]− as shown in Fig. 3b. Uniformly distributed chlorides are described by ordered and disordered Cl distributions in a supercell as shown in Fig. 3c and d respectively. A comparison of the density of states (DOS) of Fig. 3a (Fig. 3a′) with that of Fig. 3b–d (Fig. 3b′–d′) clearly shows the effect of mixed halide distribution on the band gap of perovskites.

The atomic configuration of the supercell structures of (a) 9[PbI3]−, (b) 6[PbI3]− 3[PbCl3]−, (c) ordered [Pb9I18Cl9]9−, and (d) disordered [Pb9I18Cl9]9−. (a′–d′) Density of states of (a–d) atomic configurations respectively. The valence band maximum energy is set to zero for the x-axis. The red line and the green region represent the total density of states and the projected density of states of Cl. 
The band gap of Fig. 3a is almost the same as that of Fig. 3b, which implies that the band gap of MAPbI2Cl should be same as that of MAPbI3 when the chloride is segregated in the perovskite film. The distance from [PbI3]− and [PbCl3]− is shorter than 4 nm. Therefore, the band gap of mixed halide perovskites cannot be changed when there is a Cl depletion region as shown in the recent experiment. However, the band gap can be increased when Cl is well dispersed within perovskite layers as shown in Fig. 3c and d. This result represents that the control of Cl or Br profiles along the thickness direction is one of the key factors to manipulate the band gap of mixed halide perovskites and the surface depletion of Cl would be ascribed to the origin of the band gap immunity of Cl mixed perovskites.
The similar band gap in 9[PbI3]− (Fig. 3a) and 6[PbI3]− 3[PbCl3]− (Fig. 3b) can be well described by their charge density profiles of the CBM and the VBM as shown in Fig. 4a and b. The band gap is not affected by Cl incorporation into the [PbI3]− supercell, which means that the electronic structure of PbI3 layers can be separated from PbCl3 so that type-I band alignment can be found.51 The charge density profiles of the CBM and VBM of 6[PbI3]− 3[PbCl3]− appear only at the PbI3 layers so that the overall band gap of the supercell must follow that of the lower band gap material, MAPbI3. This type-I band alignment feature is represented through layer resolved local density of states (LDOS) of each PbX3 cubic layer in Fig. 4c. The bottom 3 panels in Fig. 4c represent the LDOS of the [PbCl3]− layers (red filled line), which shows wider band gap features of [PbCl3]− comparing with that of the superlattice (green line). This implies that the wavefunction of [PbCl3]− fast decays into the [PbI3]− layers. The importance of the distance between [PbCl3]− and [PbI3]− layers is analyzed with the smaller superlattice, 4[PbI3]− 2[PbCl3]−. The resulted band gap of 4[PbI3]− 2[PbCl3]− is wider by 0.12 eV than that of 9[PbI3]−. Thus it would be expected that the effective band gap modulation is achievable when the chlorine depletion layers are shorter than 6 lattice constant unit.

(c) Layer resolved local density of states (LDOS, red color) for each PbX3 (X = Cl, I) cubic layer and total density of states (green line). The zero point of the x-axis is set to the valence band maximum energy. Each LDOS figure corresponds to that of PbX3 of right-hand atomic configuration respectively. 
Our computational results demonstrate that the distribution control of the mixed halides is very important for the effective band gap modulation which is represented in Fig. 5a and b. The depletion of chlorides along the z-direction (photon absorption path) localizes the wider band gap region so that the observed band gap follows a narrower band gap (Fig. 5a). This band gap narrowing occurring in the thin film level can be overcome by controlling the profile of mixed halides uniformly. Previous density functional study revealed that the bromide has a little site preference while the chloride prefers to be on the apical position in the perovskite.27 Thus, it may be expected that Br-mixed halide perovskites have a more uniform distribution so that the band gap modulation of Br-mixed materials becomes more effective than that of Cl-mixed halide perovskites. The surface segregation or depletion of specific halides may also be responsible for this discrepancy, but this needs the massive calculations of the preferential position of each halide component for various types of surfaces and defects, which is out of scope of this study.
 Fig. 5  Conceptual picture of band gap narrowing for mixed halide perovskites appeared in the thin film level. (a) Atomic feature represents the chloride depletion or segregation within the thin film and resulted band gap narrowing in the film level. (b) Uniform distribution of chlorides and band gap opening in the thin film. 
The type-I band alignment feature shown in Fig. 4 may also present one of the reasons why the carrier diffusion length can be dramatically enhanced by using chloride during synthesis.9,10 When chlorides are segregated near interfaces and grain boundaries, they generated electrons and holes by incident photons, and the potential barrier made by chloride hinders the generated carrier captured by such defects. The theoretical estimation of this kind of segregation behaviors will be worthy of further investigation.
Conclusions
In summary, we suggest a theoretical model to understand the complex band gap variation features of mixed halide perovskites based on first principle calculations. To understand the energy level modulation of VBM and CBM by mixing halides, the lattice change effect should be considered together with orbital interactions at band-edges. Hybrid density functional theory in this study showed that the band gap of MAPbI3 should increase by mixing Cl as well as Br, although the increment may be hindered by the band gap narrowing due to the lattice contraction. The issue on the band edge alignment among mixed halides can be successfully understood by the competition between lattice contraction and Br/Cl alloying. And we reveal that the uniform distribution of mixed halides is one of the key factors to manipulate the band gap for Br and Cl doped OIPVKs. When the Cl depletion width is greater than 4 nm, the band gap of thin films cannot be modulated with Cl doping. Our findings suggest that a more elaborate study on the dopant halide profiles within the perovskite layers is inevitable to describe the real feature of mixed halide perovskites.
