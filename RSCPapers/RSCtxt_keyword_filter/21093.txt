    , Accepted 29th June 2015First published on 3rd July 2015AbstractTwo novel polymers, PDTBO and PD2TBO, containing diketopyrrolopyrrole and alkoxyl-substituted benzothiadiazole were designed and synthesized for polymer photovoltaics. The introduction of thiophene and bithiophene as different π-bridge units results in good planarity of the polymer backbone but a different curvature in polymer chains. The inclusion of bithiophene in the repeat unit leads to a potentially larger curvature and a zigzag conformation for PD2TBO. This increased curvature does not damage the thin-film crystallinity. Instead, high hole mobility is recorded for PD2TBO which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of linear PDTBO. Furthermore, high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3% is obtained for the PD2TBO/PC71BM blend film ascribed to good miscibility while the linear polymer PDTBO exhibits a moderate PCE of 2.1%. Our work demonstrates that the modulation of the chain curvature is an efficient approach to improve the performance of polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Considerable progress has been made in improving the performance of polymer solar cells in recent years.1–3 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of bulk-heterojunction solar cells containing conjugated polymers as the donor and fullerene as the acceptor has reached up to 8–9%.3,4 Extensive efforts have been focused on designing and synthesizing new polymers to broaden the absorption range,5,6 tune their energy levels7 and improve phase separation.8–10 The general strategy is the alternative copolymerization of a suitable electron-rich (D) unit and electron-deficient (A) unit in the polymer chain as a D–A type polymer.11,12 Among the various conjugated units, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has attracted tremendous attention and exhibited high performance in thin-film devices.13–16 The low conformational disorder and the highly coplanar skeleton of DPP promote a more delocalized orbital distribution along the backbone and strong π–π stacking, which enhance intramolecular and intermolecular charge-carrier hopping.17 Systematic research on the molecular weight,18,19 side chain engineering,13,20,21 and aggregation behavior22 has shed light on the relationship between the structure and properties of DPP-based polymers and small molecules. However, curvature, as a crucial aspect for polymer chain spatial geometry, is paid little attention with respect to DPP-based polymer semiconductors. In the past, the curving of π-conjugated polymers was mostly induced by the nonlinear monomer geometry.23–25 The Klaus Müllen group investigated a series of polymers in which the different degrees of curvature of benzodithiophene isomers influence solubility, energy levels, and film morphology. As a result, the intermediate degree of curvature yielded the highest charge-carrier mobilities. Recently, the Woo group presented that “conformational locking” in the polymer backbone induced the curvature of chains and dramatically influenced the PCE of solar cells.26,27 Therefore, the modulation of the polymer curvature via rational molecular design seems to be a new strategy to improve the performance of polymer photovoltaics.
To understand better how the curvature of the polymer chain determines the solid-state structure and governs the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of DPP-based polymers, we synthesized PDTBO and PD2TBO, containing DPP and alkoxyl-substituted benzothiadiazole (BTDO) as building blocks, with different thiophene numbers in the polymer backbone as π-bridge units. By incorporating one thiophene into the polymer chain, PDTBO shows a linear conformation while bithiophene incorporated between DPP and BTDO in the polymer backbone induces a zigzag conformation in PD2TBO. Two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction indicates that the increased curvature does not damage the thin-film crystallinity, instead, high hole mobility is recorded for PD2TBO, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of PDTBO. Furthermore, high power conversion efficiency of 5.3% was achieved for the PD2TBO/PC71BM blend film attributing good miscibility while a moderate PCE of 2.1% was obtained for the device based on the PDTBO/PC71BM blend film.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
Synthetic routes to two polymers are shown in Scheme 1. Monomer 1 was synthesized from the reaction of thienyl-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole with lithium diisopropylamide and quenching with isopropoxyboronic acid pinacol ester.28 The resulting monomer was purified via recrystallization using methanol carefully. Monomer 2 was commercially available and monomer 3 was synthesized according to the literature.29 The typical palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling in toluene was used to obtain the polymers. In order to exclude the influence of molecular weight, careful control of polymerization conditions was realized. Very close number-average molecular weights (17.7 kDa and 18.3 kDa for PDTBO and PD2TBO, respectively) and polydispersity index (PDI) (2.2 and 2.7 for PDTBO and PD2TBO, respectively) were obtained for the two polymers by carrying out high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 150 °C with 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as the eluent, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. S1.† The two polymers showed good thermal stability with deposition temperatures (Td) over 320 °C (Fig. S2†). On employing differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), only PDTBO exhibits an endothermic peak at 269 °C while no thermal transition is observed for PD2TBO (Fig. S3†).

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
We recorded the UV-vis absorption spectra of two polymers in dilute chloroform solution and thin films (Fig. 1a). To our surprise, even though the longer repeat unit is existent, PD2TBO exhibits an obvious hypochromic shift absorption with a difference of ∼100 nm compared with PDTBO at the maximum absorption wavelength both in the solution and in the solid state. This result is contrary to the general expectation that increasing the number of thiophene units contributes to the conjugated length.30,31 Therefore, we believe that the polymer chains of PD2TBO constitute special conformation which somewhat disrupts the “push–pull” effect between the donor and acceptor moieties and reduces the efficient conjugation length. Both the polymers display strong low energy band absorption (600 nm–950 nm) attributed to intrachain charge transfer (ICT).32 While transforming from solution to the film state, significant bathochromic shifts (∼30 nm) in the absorption onset were observed and the shoulder peaks became intense for the two polymers, which could be attributed to the solid-state packing effects.33 After being annealed at 150 °C for 30 min, the intensities of the shorter-wavelength shoulders of the two polymer films further increase although the absorption range does not show a significant difference (Fig. S4†). By employing cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements on thin films, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO)/the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) extracted from the onset of the reduction waves and oxidation waves8 are displayed in Fig. 1b and summarized in Table 1. The LUMO/HOMO energy levels for PDTBO are −3.84/−5.36 eV. For PD2TBO, the LUMO/HOMO energy levels are −3.60/−5.18 eV. The incorporation of one more thiophene raises the LUMO and HOMO energy levels, simultaneously, attributing to the electro-rich character of thiophene. The larger electrochemical band gap of PD2TBO than that of PDTBO is in accordance with the result of optical measurement.

DFT calculations
To investigate how the chain geometry induces the high-energy absorption of PD2TBO, we simulated the orbital energy levels of two polymers by changing the number of repeat units (Fig. 2a). Before that, it is a requisite to optimize the geometries of two building blocks, thienyl-substituted DPP and thienyl-substituted BTDO. The alkyl chains were replaced with the methyl groups for computational simplicity. For thienyl-substituted DPP, the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonds arising from the protruding carbonyl group and neighboring thiophene units ensures the planar backbone and the minimum-energy conformation.34 By changing the torsional angle between thiophene and BTDO moieties, the optimized conformation was calculated to be the structure III (Fig. S5†) in which C–H⋯N and S⋯O non-covalent inter-actions allow for a planar structure. According to these results, on increasing the repeat units, we found that the band gaps of the two polymers decrease simultaneously. For monomers of the two polymers, PD2TBO exhibits a smaller band gap than that of PDTBO because of its longer π-conjugated backbone. However, this phenomenon is broken in dimers. As shown in Fig. 2b, in dimer, trimer and tetramer, the band gaps of PD2TBO are significantly larger than those of PDTBO. It is noteworthy that all these oligomers possess good planarity even for the tetramers (Fig. S6†), which excludes the influence of distortion of the backbone on the effective conjugation length. From the minimum energy conformation of these oligomers, it can be obviously observed that the dramatic difference between the two polymers is the chain curvature (Fig. S7†). For PDTBO, the chain remains a linear pattern with the increase of the number of repeat units while the chain of PD2TBO tends to form a zigzag conformation from the dimer and the chain curvature is apparent in the tetramer (Fig. 2c). Therefore, the curved conformation reduces the effective conjugation length of the backbone and results in blue-shift absorption of PD2TBO.

Photovoltaic device performance
Solution-processed photovoltaic devices were fabricated using a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The performance of devices were carefully optimized by varying the layer thickness, the spin-coating solvent, the weight ratio of the donor and the acceptor, the temperature of post-treatment, etc. With a series of testing, the ratio of polymer to PC71BM was kept at 1:3 in this work. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was used as an additive with the concentration of 1% volume in chlorobenzene. Fig. 3a shows the corresponding current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of two optimal devices. Tables 2 and S1† summarize the photovoltaic parameters for these devices. For PD2TBO devices, a remarkable short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.4 mA cm−2 in combination with a high fill factor (FF) of 0.56 gave a PCE of 5.3%. The PDTBO/PC71BM devices gave a moderate PCE of 2.1% with decreased Jsc of 7.6 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.41. The open-circuit voltage (Voc) (0.65 V) of PD2TBO devices is smaller than that of PDTBO devices (0.69 V) which accords with the fact that Voc is mainly determined by the difference between the HOMO energy levels of donor materials and the LUMO energy level of PC71BM.35 For optimized devices, the EQE spectra agree well with the Jsc obtained from J–V measurement (Fig. 3b). The Jsc values integrated from EQE data are 7.2 mA cm−2 and 13.7 mA cm−2 for PDTBO and PD2TBO, respectively (within 5% error). It indicates that the exciton generation is more efficient in PD2TBO-based devices than that of the PDTBO-based device.36

Thin film morphology and microstructural analysis
We investigate the microstructure of pure polymer films and blend films via two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (2D-GIXRD) to illustrate how the chain curvature influences the morphology and the performance of thin-film devices. Two pure polymers exhibit different orientations in thin films. In Fig. 4a, in the out of plane, PDTBO displays a strong diffraction peak at 2θ = 5.0° and 2θ = 24° corresponding to the lamellar distance of 17.7 Å and the π–π stacking distance of 3.7 Å, respectively. In addition, the lamellar structures can also be observed in the in-plane pattern indicating that there is no preferential orientation formed in the PDTBO film. In contrast, for the PD2TBO thin film (Fig. 4b), in the out of plane pattern, clear diffraction signals at 2θ = 5.1° with the second diffraction peak corresponding to the lamellar distance of 17.4 Å, meanwhile, π–π stacking diffraction at 2θ = 24° corresponding to d-spacing of 3.7 Å, exists in the plane pattern. This indicates that the polymer chains prefer to constitute edge-on orientation and the curvature of the backbone has no impact on the π–π stacking distance. The slightly shorter lamellar distance and the preferential orientation of PD2TBO indicate that alkyl chains intercalate each other more intensely and much ordered stacking exists in the thin film. Topographical information of the annealed polymer films obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM) indicates that the PD2TBO film exhibits more intense packing with larger Ra (average roughness) than that of the PDTBO film (Fig. S8†), suggesting better carrier transport in the PD2TBO film. The measurements of hole mobilities of the two pure polymers confirm the results (Fig. S9†). PD2TBO shows good hole mobility with the highest value of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 while PDTBO has significantly lower mobility of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1 under ambient conditions (Table S2†). After being mixed with fullerenes, the lamellar structures of the PDTBO film vanish in two dimensions and strong diffraction peaks of PC71BM appear, which suggests that the packing of polymers are completely disturbed by fullerenes. Different from PDTBO, the PD2TBO/PC71BM film retains the lamellar packing patterns in two dimensions. Moreover, the lamellar distance in the out of plane pattern increases to 20.7 Å. These results suggest that PC71BM could intercalate well into the lamellar structure of polymer chains.37

The schematic illustration of microstructures of PDTBO/PC71BM (c) and PD2TBO/PC71BM blend films (d), respectively. The light gray shadow in figure (c) represents steric hindrance of alkyl chains. 
On the basis of the above observation, the difference in crystallinity, especially in the lamellar structure, between the two polymers in both the pure film and blend film is markedly large and thus dramatically influences the solar cell performance. The zigzag conformation of the backbone is more favorable to form ordered and intense interlamellar packing than the linear conformation. It can be attributed to bithiophene in PD2TBO providing enough space for adjacent alkyl chains to extend and interlock each other intensely, which to some extent reduces the displacement between the adjacent zigzag chains. In contrast, the reduced distance between the solubilizing alkyl chains in PDTBO results in increased steric interaction that could impair the polymer packing. In the blend film, as illustrated in Fig. 4c, fullerenes interrupt the packing of PDTBO and tend to self-aggregate inducing large domains to decrease performance. However, in the PD2TBO-based blend film, the perturbation of fullerene is relatively weak because fullerenes could intercalate well into the lamellar structures of polymers (Fig. 4d). Good miscibility is responsible for the improved photovoltaic performance. The blend film absorption spectra reveal that, compared with the featureless absorption profile of the PDTBO-based film (Fig. S10†), the fine vibration absorption at 700 nm–800 nm in the PD2TBO-based film still exists after mixing with PC71BM. This confirms that polymer PD2TBO retains its packing pattern in the blend film. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to further probe the morphology of the blend films (Fig. 5 and S11†). As mentioned above, in the PDTBO/PC71BM blend film, polymer-rich and PC71BM-rich domains occur on a scale of 50 nm–100 nm which is considered too large and thus unfavorable for exciton dissociation. In contrast, well-defined interpenetrating networks with a fibril width of ∼20 nm are beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport in the PD2TBO-based blend film.38 From the AFM images, the PD2TBO/PC71BM blend film showed smaller phase separation (∼20 nm) domains with a greater surface roughness than that of the PDTBO/PC71BM blend film, suggesting its more favorable morphology for photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
In conclusion, two novel polymers, named PDTBO and PD2TBO were designed and synthesized. With different π-bridges, thiophene and bithiophene, similar planarity but different backbone conformation is correlated with the film crystallinity, morphology, and photovoltaic properties of PDTBO and PD2TBO. The backbone of PDTBO exhibits a linear backbone while PD2TBO has a much curved conformation. Despite the existing zigzag structure, ordered interchain packing can still be formed in the film of PD2TBO which is responsible for the high mobility of 0.4 cm2 V−1 s−1 in OFET. As active layer, PD2TBO/PC71BM shows a high PCE of 5.3% while PDTBO/PC71BM shows a moderate PCE of 2.1%. It suggests that the modulation of the polymer chain curvature would be a useful tool to improve the photovoltaic properties.
Experimental section
Materials and characterization
Unless otherwise specified, the starting chemical materials were purchased from Alfa and Sigma and were used without further purification. The solvents were obtained from the Beijing Chemical Plant. Toluene was freshly dried over sodium and benzophenone under an inert argon atmosphere. The gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed on a Polymer Labs PL 220 system with a refractive index detector, using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (TCB) as the eluent at 150 °C and polystyrene standards as calibrants. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were recorded by using a Shimadzu thermogravimetric analyzer (model DTG-60) under a dry nitrogen gas flow at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a Mettler Toledo Instrument with a DSC822 calorimeter. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Shimidazu UV-3600 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. Elemental analyses were performed using a Flash EA 1112 elemental analyser. The electrochemical properties were characterized in a conventional three-electrode cell consisting of a platinum working electrode coated with a thin film layer of polymer, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/AgCl reference electrode with ferrocenium–ferrocene (Fc+–Fc) as the external standard. Tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) (0.1 M) was used as the supporting electrolyte. Atom force microscopy (AFM) was determined by a Bruker Multimode 8 using the tapping mode with a scan speed of 1 Hz. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEM-2011 operated at 100 kV. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) data were obtained at 1W1A, Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility. The films were illuminated at a constant incidence angle of 0.2° (λ = 2dsinθ = 1.5464 Å).
Synthesis of PDTBO
In a Schlenk tube, 1 mL H2O solution of K3PO4 (424 mg, 2 mmol) and a drop of Aliquat 336 was added to a degassed 6 mL toluene solution of 2,5-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3,6-bis[5-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxoborolan-2-yl)thiophene-2-yl]-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (1) (150 mg, 0.169 mmol) and 4,7-dibromo-5,6-bis(octyloxy)-benzothiadiazole (2) (93 mg, 0.169 mmol). The solution degassed before Pd2(dba)3 (4.6 mg, 0.005 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (6.2 mg, 0.02 mmol) were added. After being heated to 120 °C for 48 h, the mixture was cooled to room temperature and poured into a mixture of methanol and water. The resulting precipitate was purified by Soxhlet extraction successively with methanol, acetone, hexane, and finally with chloroform, and then precipitated in methanol again. The polymer PDTBO was obtained as a purple solid (167 mg, 70%). Anal. calcd for C60H90N4O4S3: C, 70.13; H, 8.83; N, 5.45. Found: C, 69.95; H, 8.80; N, 5.29%.
Synthesis of PD2TBO
To ensure similar molecular weight, the synthetic procedures of PD2TBO were almost the same as that of PDTBO. The polymer PDTBO was obtained as a purple solid (152 mg, 87%). Anal. calcd for C68H94N4O4S5: C, 68.53; H, 7.95; N, 4.70. Found: C, 68.31; H, 7.63; N, 4.65%.
OFET device preparation and characterization
OFET devices were prepared with a bottom-gate/top-contact configuration. SiO2/Si substrates were cleaned and treated with octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS). The polymer solution in chlorobenzene (4 mg mL−1) was spin coated at a speed of 2000 rpm for 50 s. The samples were thermally annealed at 150 °C in N2 for 30 min. Then the gold source and drain electrodes (60 nm) were deposited by vacuum evaporation on the organic layer through a shadow mask. The channel length (L) and width (W) were 30 μm and 500 μm, respectively. Field-effect mobilities were determined at room temperature in air by using a Keithley 4200 SCS. The mobility in the saturation region was extracted from the following equation:IDS = Ciμ(W/2L)(VG − VT)2where IDS is the drain current, Ci is the capacitance of the SiO2 dielectric layer (Ci = 10 nF cm−2), μ is the mobility, VG and VT are the gate voltage and threshold voltage, respectively.
OPV device fabrication and testing
The photovoltaic devices were fabricated with conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/PC71BM/Ca/Al, the ITO substrates were cleaned and exposed to a 30 min UV/O3 treatment, and then PEDOT:PSS (2000 rpm for 30 min) was spin-coated and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the chlorobenzene solution of the polymer/PC71BM mixture was spin-coated at a speed of 1000 rpm for 30 s. Then calcium (20 nm) and aluminum (80 nm) were successively thermally evaporated on a photoactive layer. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured by using a Keithley 2400 source measure unit. The measurements were conducted under the irradiation of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured by using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011.
