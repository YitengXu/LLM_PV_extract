    , Accepted 11th April 2014First published on 17th April 2014AbstractTwo new D–D–π–π–A type stable organic sensitizers, DT3 and DW3, were successfully synthesized for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). DT3 displayed η values of 10.03% and 8.05% in liquid and quasi-solid-state DSSCs, respectively, under standard global 1.5 solar conditions, offering an example achieving the highest efficiency to date in quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on pure organic dyes.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a green energy producer, have been intensively studied to improve the sensitizer, which plays a crucial role, to determine the power conversion efficiency (η) as well as cell stability.1 To date, overall conversion efficiencies of up to 12%,2 11%3 and 10%4 were achieved from liquid DSSCs by employing zinc, ruthenium complex and pure organic dyes, respectively, but the devices are subject to long-term instability. Quasi-solid-state (QSS) DSSCs have been proposed as potential candidates to overcome this problem and improve commercial development.
Compared to metal complex dyes, which are usually expensive and hard to purify, the pure organic dyes, commonly constructed into a donor–π bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration, feature a high extinction coefficient and low cost. However, up to now, their open circuit voltage (Voc) and long-term stability still fall behind metal complex dyes.5 One main reason for the lower Voc of the organic dyes is due to the strong interaction between iodine and organic dye, leading to the fast recombination of electrons. In order to solve the problem, one strategy is to introduce more donor units to the primary donor, thereby forming cone-shaped D–D–π–A structures. In contrast to normal rod-shaped analogues,6 cone-shaped dyes are beneficial for better thermostability and lower aggregation tendency. In addition, their absorption regions can be broadened and molar extinction coefficients can be increased. Several groups have accomplished such strategy by transforming the rod-shaped dye into a starburst type, usually employing triarylamine units as the donor, to improve the Voc value. This enhancement should be attributed to their aggregation-resistant nonplanar configuration and multiphenyl segments on the starburst triarylamine, which can block the approach of triiodide in the electrolyte.5a,7 On the other hand, the poor stability of organic dyes in DSSCs is mainly ascribed to the formation of excited triplet states and unstable radicals. An efficient approach to tackle this problem is to incorporate an oligothiophene moiety into the organic framework, where the radical center could be delocalized among the dye cations.8
Along this line, we recently reported a starburst D–D–π–A organic sensitizer (D3) using triarylamine (TPA) and carbazole as duplex electron donors, the 3,4-ethoxythiophene (EDOT) unit as π-spacer, and cyanoacetic acid as electron acceptor, yielding 6.15% power conversion efficiency under AM 1.5 G irradiation.9 Herein we improved the structural model and synthesized two new starburst sensitizers, DT3 and DW3, which form D–D–π–π–A type organic dyes by incorporating 3,4′-dihexyl-2,2′-bithiophene in addition to the EDOT moiety to act as the duplex π-spacers (Scheme 1). The optical, electronic and photovoltaic studies unveiled outstanding η values for DT3 in both liquid DSSCs (10.03%) and quasi-solid-state (QSS) DSSCs (8.05%) under AM 1.5G irradiation. To the best of our knowledge, the former is comparable with the hitherto world record of organic dye in liquid DSSCs while the latter represents the highest efficiency so far observed for QSS-DSSCs based on pure organic sensitizers.4,7a,10
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for DT3 and DW3 production in comparison with known D3. 
The synthetic route for DT3 and DW3 production is outlined in Scheme 1. DT3–CHO was synthesized by Suzuki coupling reaction of 1c and 2f in the presence of K2CO3 as base and Pd(PPh3)4 as catalyst. DT3 was obtained by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid, which can convert carbaldehydes to cyanoacrylic acids. The dye DW3 was conveniently synthesized from 3a and 2fvia a two-step process involving phase transfer catalyzed N-alkylation, followed by Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes with cyanoacetic acid.
The UV-vis absorption spectra of DT3 and DW3 in CHCl3 are shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum of DT3 exhibits two maxima at 512 nm (32800 M−1 cm−1) and 341 nm (36500 M−1 cm−1, showing a shoulder at 380 nm). The former is attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the starburst donor and cyanoacrylic acid while the latter arises from the π–π* electron transition. Under the same conditions, the DW3 sensitizer displays absorption bands at 490 nm (30700 M−1 cm−1) and 340 nm (64900 M−1 cm−1). It is clear that the extinction coefficient of π–π* transition in DW3 is higher than in DT3, apparently owing to the larger conjugated system in the electron donor unit. This is in accordance with the computation results that the oscillation strength of the second absorption band in DW3 is stronger than in DT3 (Table S1†). However, DT3 exhibits an enhanced molar extinction coefficient in the ICT band and the absorption bands red-shift to larger numbers, due to the stronger donor and better coplanarity between the electron donor and acceptor in DT3,7b as verified by the computation results. Upon adsorption of the dyes on TiO2 films, the absorption bands are broadened and red-shift can be observed (Fig. S1†), most likely due to electronic coupling of the dyes on the TiO2 surface.7c
 Fig. 1  The absorption spectra of DT3 and DW3 in CHCl3 solution. 
Moderately high oxidation potentials were found for DT3 and DW3 and the zero–zero excitation energy (E0–0) was calculated from the absorption onset to estimate the excited state potential (E*0–0). The deduced E*0–0 values (DT3, −1.0 and DW3, −0.80 V, versus NHE, normal hydrogen electrode) are more negative than the bottom of the TiO2 conduction band (−0.5 V vs. NHE), indicating that the electron injection process is energetically permitted. On the other hand, the first oxidation potentials of the dyes (DT3, 1.12 and DW3, 1.39 V vs. NHE) are more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (∼0.4 V vs. NHE), thus allowing an effective dye regeneration and suppressing the recapture of injected electrons by the dye cation radical.
Molecular-orbital calculations (Fig. 2) indicate that the HOMO levels of DT3 and DW3 are delocalized mainly at the donor group consisting of TPA and carbazole, and further extend to the carbazole or TPA core. Examination of the molecular orbitals of both sensitizers illustrates that the HOMOs in DT3 are more delocalized on the π bridge than in DW3, because of its better coplanarity in the conjugated pathway. The LUMOs of DT3 and DW3 are located in the cyanoacrylic moiety through dithiophene and EDOT. As a result, the HOMO–LUMO excitation could transfer the electron distribution from the starburst donor to the cyanoacrylic acid moiety through the π-conjugation bridge.

The photovoltaic performance of DT3- and DW3-sensitized solar cells with liquid and quasi-solid-state electrolyte is shown in Fig. 3, and the detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. The photocurrent action spectra of liquid DSSCs were obtained using an electrolyte comprising 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propyl imidiazolium iodide (PMII), 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS), 0.05 M LiI, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of DT3 exceeds 81% in the range of 410–610 nm, reaching the highest value of 91% at 481 nm. Under the same conditions, the IPCEs for DW3 decrease above 500 nm toward the long-wavelength region. The results indicate a stronger light harvesting ability for DT3. Under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions, DT3-sensitized solar cells give a short circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 19.18 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 752 mV, and a fill factor (ff) of 0.70, corresponding to an overall η of 10.03%, which is amongst the highest reported values for DSSCs based on organic sensitizers.4,7a In contrast, the DW3-sensitized solar cells give a Jsc of 18.42 mA cm−2, a Voc of 745 mV, and an ff of 0.67, corresponding to a η of 9.15%. Since the π-conjugated bridge and electron acceptor of the two dyes are identical, the superior performance of DT3 over DW3 can be traced to the subtle modifications in the structural design of the donor moieties (D1 and D2).

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were also carried out to clarify the above photovoltaic findings. The large semicircle in the Nyquist plot (Fig. 4) represents the charge recombination (Rr) at the interface of the TiO2/electrolyte. A lower Rr value indicates faster electron recombination from TiO2 to electron acceptors in an electrolyte and thus resulting in lower Voc. Therefore, the smaller semicircle radius of DW3 indicates that its electron recombination resistance is lower than DT3. Electron lifetimes (τ) derived from curve fitting are 242.1 and 301.2 ms for DW3 and DT3, respectively (Table S2†), which agrees well with the trend in Voc values. The increase in electron lifetime in the TiO2 film is accompanied by a pronounced rise in the charge transfer resistance, which relies on the sensitizer structure as a result of the different coverage of dyes on the TiO2 surface. It is known that the sensitizer adsorption amount greatly affects the lifetime and Voc, and therefore, the shorter lifetime of starburst sensitizer DW3 was probably attributed to its lower dye packing density on TiO2 compared to DT3 (adsorbed amounts of DT3 and DW3 are 2.2 × 10−7 and 1.7 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively), which would result in higher I3− concentration in the vicinity of the TiO2 surface and lower charge recombination resistance.

For QSS-DSSC evaluation, silica nanoparticles were mixed with 0.5 M iodine and 0.45 M benzimidazole (BI) in pure 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) to prepare an ionic liquid-based QSS electrolyte. As seen in Fig. 3a, the IPCE data exceed 70% for DT3 and 50% for DW3 in the spectral range of 435–630 nm, while the maxima for DT3 and DW3 reach 87% at 490 nm and 82% at 500 nm, respectively. The IPCE value for DT3 in the range of 400 to 700 nm is higher than for DW3, suggesting that DT3 is more attractive because a more extended absorption spectra will enhance cell efficiency. Under standard global AM 1.5 solar conditions, the QSS-DSSCs using DT3 as sensitizer exhibit Jsc of 16.08 mA cm−2, Voc of 716 mV and ff of 0.70, while the overall η reaches 8.05% (Table 1). This high η value represents the highest efficiency ever reported for QSS-DSSCs based on metal-free sensitizers,7a,10 and is also far superior to analogous QSS-DSSCs based on metal complex dye N719 (η = 6.07%). However, it should be noted that higher efficiencies have been observed for QSS-DSSCs based on ruthenium complex dye in polymer gel electrolytes,11 implying that the present organic dye DT3 may achieve even higher efficiency using polymer gel electrolytes in QSS-DSSCs (investigation is under way in our group). Under the same conditions, QSS-DSSCs based on DW3 give a Jsc value of 13.75 mA cm−2, a Voc of 691 mV, and an ff of 0.71, corresponding to the η value of 6.75% (Table 1). DT3 shows higher η than DW3 in QSS-DSSCs, which might be attributed to its wider IPCE spectra, better dye adsorption on TiO2, and higher injection efficiency arising from the starburst bis-carbazole substituted triphenylamine group.
The long-term stability of DSSCs is a critical requirement for their photovoltaic application, for which lifetime is a vital factor. A simple and efficient method has been developed by Katoh et al. to evaluate the stability of dyes, which can accelerate the dye aging process by light irradiation on dye-loaded TiO2 film without redox electrolyte.8a,b Wu et al. have also assessed the photostability of their dyes by this method.7fFig. 5a illustrates photographs of the dye-loaded TiO2 film based on DT3 and DW3 before and after 60 min irradiation, and which display no obvious change in the color of films. Fig. 5b and c show the absorption curves of dyes DT3 and DW3 after aging by light irradiation with AM 1.5 light (0, 30, and 60 min). No clear variation in absorbance was observed, suggesting that they are stable enough according to the method of Katoh et al. The excellent photo-stability of starburst DT3 and DW3 may be ascribed to the following contributions: (1) the bulky structure of the dyes which probably protects the TiO2 surface and hinders desorption,7c (2) the presence of holes on the oligothiophene moieties which remarkably enhance the dye stability,8 and (3) the carbazole donor as a photostable hole-transporting moiety for DSSCs.7c,8c

Conclusion
We have designed and synthesized two novel starburst D–D–π–π–A type dyes DT3 and DW3 which incorporate the following molecular engineering concepts: (1) the duplex triphenylamine and carbazole donors are alternately arranged to tune the starburst structure for better Voc and overall cell performance; (2) the mixed bithiophene and EDOT units are employed to delocalize radicals for better dye stability, as well as to increase the red-shift of the absorption maximum and the molar extinction coefficients; and (3) two long alkyl chains on the bithiophene bridge are introduced to suppress the aggregation of dye molecules, enhance the solubility, and form a tightly self-assembled monolayer to block the recapture of injected electrons by I3− or cations. The two resulting dyes exhibit excellent photostability as testified by the accelerated dye aging method using light irradiation on dye-loaded TiO2 film. Strikingly, the DT3 organic dye displays a high power conversion efficiency of 10.03% in liquid DSSCs and 8.05% in QSS-DSSCs under standard global 1.5 solar conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a high efficiency has been obtained for ionic liquid-based QSS-DSSCs with either pure organic or metal complex dyes as sensitizers, and also the highest efficiency observed for QSS-DSSCs based on metal-free organic sensitizers. The better conversion efficiency of DT3-sensitized DSSCs than the DW3 counterparts may arise from the red-shifted absorption, higher absorptivity above the visible spectrum, and longer electron lifetime. These findings offer a promising future for the design of starburst organic DSSC photosensitizers and analogous derivatives by judicious molecular engineering.
Experimental
Materials and reagents
Tetrahydrofuran, toluene, and chloroform were purified using the MBRAUN MB SPS-800 system. Methanol and acetonitrile were dried over a molecular sieve without normal pressure distillation. Anhydrous solvents used in the Suzuki coupling reaction were degassed by N2 bubbling for 20 min. Optically transparent fluorine doped SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass was purchased from Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan (15 Ω per square), and cleaned by a standard procedure. All other chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources without further purification. 1a–c and 2a–b were obtained as previously reported by our group.9 The intermediates 2c–f and 3a were synthesized according to the procedures in ESI.† The detailed synthesis of DT3–CHO, DT3, DW3–CHO, and DW3 was as follows.

A mixture of 1c (805 mg, 1.1 mmol), 2f (556 mg, 0.96 mmol), and Pd(PPh3)4 (59 mg, 0.047 mmol) was added to a Schlenk flask under a nitrogen atmosphere, and then 2 M degassed anhydrous K2CO3 solution (359 mg, 2.6 mmol, 1.3 mL) and degassed dimethoxyethane (60 mL) were added. The reaction solution was then heated at 90 °C. After completion of the reaction as monitored by TLC, the mixture was cooled and evaporated to dryness. The residue was dissolved in ethyl acetate and the organic phase was washed with water and brine.

The reaction solution was heated at 90 °C for 5 h. Upon cooling to room temperature, the resulting mixture was neutralized to pH 2–3 with 0.5 M aqueous HCl and extracted with dichloromethane. The extract was washed successively with water and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered and evaporated to afford a crude product which was further purified by silica-gel column chromatography using dichloromethane and acetic acid (50:1, v/v) as eluant to give 111 mg of dark red solid.

Characterization

1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed on a BRUKER 400 MHz with tetramethylsilane (TMS) as internal standard. Elemental analyses were carried out with an Elementar Vario EL Cube instrument. Mass spectral data were obtained on an ultrafleX-treme MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics). The absorption spectra of the dyes (in solution and adsorbed on TiO2 films) were observed with a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer and fluorescence spectra were measured with a Hitachi F-4500 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammogram (CV) curves were obtained with a CHI 832 electrochemical analyzer using a normal three-electrode cell with dye-sensitized photoanode as working electrode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and a regular Ag/AgCl reference electrode in saturated KCl solution which was calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium as external reference. The supporting electrolyte was 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate in CHCl3.
Fabrication of cells
The anatase TiO2 nanoparticles were synthesized according to our earlier study.12 First, Ti(OBu)4 (10 mL) was added to ethanol (20 mL) under stirring for 10 min. Then a mixture of deionized water (50 mL) and acetic acid (18 mL) was added to the solution with vigorous stirring for 1 h. The solution was moved to an autoclave and heated at 200 °C for 12 h. Finally, the precipitates were washed with deionized water and ethanol several times. A white powder was obtained after drying in air. The as-prepared TiO2 nanoparticles were anatase crystals with diameters of about 20 nm, as confirmed by SEM, TEM, and XRD. The prepared TiO2 powder (1.0 g) was ground for 40 min in a mixture of acetic acid (0.2 mL), ethanol (8.0 mL), ethyl cellulose (0.5 g), and terpineol (3.0 g) to form a slurry, and then the slurry was sonicated for 5 min to obtained a viscous white TiO2 paste. The TiO2 paste was then screen-printed onto the surface of FTO coated glass to form a photoanode film. The thickness of films could be easily controlled by repeating screen-printing times. Afterwards, a programmed heating process was carried out to remove the organic substances in the film. The as-prepared TiO2 films (∼15 μm) were soaked in a 0.04 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C and then sintered at 520 °C for 30 min. After cooling to 80 °C, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in 0.3 mM optimal organic solution (CHCl3–ACN–tBuOH = 1:2:2) of the dyes and kept at room temperature for 6 h for cells with liquid electrolyte and for 12 h for cells with gel electrolyte. Then the prepared TiO2 working electrodes were sandwiched together with a Pt-counter electrode. The active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film was 0.16 cm2. The electrolyte was injected into the inter-electrode space. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (PMII), 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate (GuNCS), 0.03 M I2, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (t-BP) in acetonitrile and valeronitrile (85:15, v/v). For the quasi-solid state electrolyte, 12 nm silica nanoparticles (5 wt%) were mixed with 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) based liquid electrolyte containing 0.5 M iodine (I2) and 0.45 M benzimidazole (BI) in an agate mortar.7c,e The dye-adsorbed TiO2 film as working electrode was placed on top of a Pt coated FTO glass as counter electrode. The electrolyte was introduced into the space between the two electrodes by capillary force.
Characterization of cells
The TiO2 film thickness and active area of the dye-coated TiO2 film were measured using a profilometer (Ambios, XP-1). The current–density voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination from an AM 1.5 G simulated solar light. IPCEs of DSSCs were measured with a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed using an electrochemical workstation (Zahner, Zennium) with a frequency response analyzer at a bias potential of −800 mV in the dark with a frequency ranging from 10 mHz to 1 MHz. The amounts of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film were measured using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrometer.
The dye aging process
The dye aging process experiment was performed according to reported studies.7f,8a The photostability of dyes adsorbed on the nanocrystalline films was evaluated by visible-light (>400 nm) irradiation from a solar simulator (Newport Company) operating at AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) with an ultraviolet (UV) cut-off filter. Irradiation was carried out under ambient conditions. In order to evaluate the degradation of the dyes, absorption measurements were carried out with a spectrometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450) equipped with an integrating sphere at 0, 30 and 60 min irradiation times.
