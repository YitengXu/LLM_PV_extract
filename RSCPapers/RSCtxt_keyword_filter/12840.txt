    , Accepted 6th July 2017First published on 6th July 2017AbstractIn this study, we report the synthesis of a novel heteroleptic Ru(II)-sensitizer, (Ru(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-4,4′-bis(4-piperidin-1-yl)phenyl ethenyl)-(2,2′-bipyridine) (NCS)2, denoted as SD-1; moreover, its photophysical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic performances were compared with those of N719 and K77-7 (N,N′-diaryl Ru-sensitizer, namely Ru(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic-acid)-4,4′-bis(2-(4-N,N′-diphenylaminophenyl)ethenyl)-2,2′-bipyridine (NCS)2). The photovoltaic performance of SD-1 outperformed those of N-719 and K77-7, particularly in the red region, and the overall efficiency of SD-1 was 8.5% as compared to 8.0% of K77-7 and 7.7% of N719 under the same experimental device conditions. The superior light harvesting efficiency of SD-1 can be attributed to the strong electron donor sp3-nitrogen, which is attached to two sp3-carbons (dialkyl), whereas in the case of K77-7, all carbon atoms attached to the sp3-nitrogen are sp2, which decrease the electron density on the latter and minimize the electron-donating power of the ancillary ligand in K77-7. To gain a quantitative understanding of the electron density on nitrogen in SD-1 and K77-7, first-principle calculations using molecular and thermodynamic descriptors, such as frontier molecular orbitals, ground-state oxidation potential (GSOP), excited-state oxidation potential (ESOP), optical gap (E0–0), and charge distributions, were conducted in solution. In addition, for understanding the anchored structures of dyes on Ti24O48, density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) were utilized. Results of computational studies are in excellent agreement with the experimental results, which can be used as a screening tool for the design of more efficient molecular motifs for DSSCs.
1. Introduction
In the last two decades, after the first report by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) have gained popularity because they are highly efficient under diffused light, independent of incident light angle, easy to fabricate, and economical.1,2 The main components in DSSC include a sensitizer, nanocrystalline TiO2 particles, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode, which perform explicit tasks such as electron injection, charge transfer/separation, and redox mediator.3,4 Optimization of light-absorbing components is compulsory for obtaining higher solar-to-electric efficiency.5–11 The record efficiency of Ru(II) dyes is 11.9%.12
The most common bipyridyl Ru(II) complexes studied in dye-sensitized solar cells are N719, N3, and black dye.13,14 Historically, N719 is the most popular benchmark serving as a scaffold for the design and evaluation of new photosensitizers with better light harvesting efficiency (LHE).15,16 One of the disadvantages is its relatively low molar extinction coefficient in the visible region. In the past two decades, various kinds of structural modifications of N719 have been carried out to generate novel highly efficient ruthenium sensitizers that display superior conversion efficiency as compared to N719.7,17 Similarly, terpyridyl photosensitizers and cyclometalated chromophores are also being used in Ru(II) complexes for highly efficient dye-sensitized solar cells.18–21 Yun Chi and co-workers reported a series of cyclometalated Ru(II) sensitizers with single 4,4′-dicarboxylic acid-2,2′-bipyridine and two functionalized 2-pyridyl azolate ancillary ligands labeled as TFRS-1–3 with the efficiency of up to 9.5%.22 Another series (TFRS-11–14) based on carboxyvinyl-pyrazolate was reported with less efficiency than the parent sensitizer TFRS-2. This was due to poor packing of these sensitizers on the TiO2 surface and less positive ground-state oxidation potentials.23
Ru(II) complexes with ancillary ligands possessing an N,N′-diaryl moiety were reported, and the total conversion efficiency considerably varied depending on the nature of the ancillary ligand such as HMP-9 with –OC6H13 attached to the para-position, which showed a total efficiency of 5.34% with a photocurrent density of 16.7 mA cm−2.24 However, Ru-TPD-NCS with a methyl group attached to the meta-position of the bis-triphenyl group furnished an efficiency of 3.4% with 9.6 mA cm−2.25 Another N,N′-diaryl ancillary ligand-based dye JJ-12 provided η = 8.34%.7 The molecular structures of the abovementioned sensitizers are shown in Fig. 1. The photosensitizers 1, 2, and 3, as shown in Fig. 1, are also representatives of N,N′-diaryl ancillary ligands tethered to bpy without an olefinic bond and show the photocurrent densities of 5.37, 11.48, and 12.00 mA cm−2 with the device efficiencies of 2.41, 5.17, and 5.68%, respectively.26

Considering the abovementioned facts, to further probe the electronic effect in the ancillary ligands on device efficiency, we developed a novel sensitizer, denoted as SD-1, with an ancillary ligand possessing N,N′-dialkyl and compared its photophysical properties and photovoltaic performance with those of the N,N′-diaryl sensitizer known as K77-7 (Fig. 2). The primary objective of this study was to develop a novel sensitizer with a stronger electron donor ancillary ligand than that of K77-7 to achieve three main goals: (i) better light harvesting efficiency (LHE), (ii) narrower optical gap while maintaining favorable GSOP and ESOP, and hence, (iii) greater photovoltaic performance than those of N719 and K77-7.

Density functional theory (DFT)27 and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)28 were successfully utilized to optimize the structures, calculate the molecular orbital energy levels, and isodensity plots and analyze polarizability properties, energy gaps, absorption spectra, and excited-state oxidation potentials for natural dyes, ruthenium sensitizers, metal-free sensitizers, and organic solar cells.29–34
To probe the electronic and thermodynamic properties of SD-1 and K77-7 at the molecular level, optimized molecular geometries, vertical electronic excitations, dipole moments, natural bond orbital method-based atomic charges, Fukui reactivity indices based on the atomic responses to electrostatic potential surface fluctuation, electron-injection driving force (−ΔGinject) and electron-regeneration driving force (−ΔGregen), the difference in the charge on the TiO2 surface between the ground state (S0) and excited state (S1), frontier molecular orbitals, and polarizabilities of SD-1, K77-7, and N719 and their anchored structures on the anatase Ti24O48 model surfaces were studied via molecular modeling methods based on the conceptual density functional theory (DFT)27 and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT)28 calculations.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and equipment
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific or TCI-America and were used as received. Sephadex LH-20 used for purification of dyes was purchased from Fischer Scientific. FT-IR (ATR) spectra were obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 470 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and UV-visible spectra were obtained using the Cary 300 spectrophotometer. The mass spectrometry analysis was carried out via a high-resolution mass spectrometer – the Thermo Fisher Scientific Executive Plus MS, a bench top full-scan OrbitrapTM mass spectrometer using heated electro-spray ionization (HESI). Samples were dissolved in methanol, sonicated for 15 minutes, then diluted 1:1 with 20 mM ammonium acetate, and analyzed via syringe injection into a mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 10 μL min−1. 1H-NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. The Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.) was used to measure the fluorescence and emission decay at room temperature.
2.2. Synthesis of the ancillary ligand: 4,4′-bis(4-(piperidin-1-yl)-2,2′-bipyridine) (SL-I)
The synthesis of the ancillary ligand (SL-I) was carried out according to the procedure reported in the literature.35
2.3. Synthesis of SD-1
The synthesis of SD-1 was carried out according to the procedure reported in the literature.36 4-(1-Piperidinyl)benzaldehyde and 4,4-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridyl were reacted in a pressure tube in the presence of little excess of chlorotrimethylsilane to produce the corresponding bis-stilbazole in the Knoevenagel condensation-type reaction, as previously reported by our group.37 Detailed synthetic procedures for the ligand and complex can be found in the ESI.† The proposed Ru(II) sensitizers were then synthesized via the typical one-pot three-step synthetic scheme, as given in the ESI.† The yield of the crude products was in the range of 85–90%, and they were purified twice through the Sephadex LH-20 column to obtain the highly pure product in 50–58% yield. The pure product was then characterized by 1H-NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (ESI†).
FT-IR, 2101.1 cm−1 (–NCS stretch, N-bonded isomer, very strong); 1719.9 cm−1 (CO stretch of –COOH) (Fig. 1S, ESI†); High Resolution ESI-MS [M + H]+; Theo. m/z = 987.20542, Found. m/z = 987.20889, error = 3.522 ppm (Fig. 2S, ESI†).

N,N′-Diaryl AL-based Ru-dye, i.e., K77-7, was also synthesized via following the same procedure. The chemical structures of SD-1, K77-7, and N719 are depicted in Fig. 2.
2.4. Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements
Fluorescence spectra were obtained via a 1 cm path length quartz cell using 2 × 10−5 M solutions on Fluorolog-311. The emitted light was detected in the steady-state mode using a Hamamatsu R2658 detector. The emission was measured in the steady-state mode via excitation at the MLCT λmax for each dye with exit and entrance slits set at 11 nm with 0.1 s integration time.
2.5. Ground-state oxidation potential (GSOP) and excited-state oxidation potential (ESOP) measurements
The experimental HOMO and E0–0 energy values for SD-1 and K77-7 were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and absorption onset, respectively. The CV was carried out in DMF with 0.1 M [TBA][PF6]− as an electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Glassy carbon was used as the working electrode (WE), Pt wire was used as the counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile was used as the reference electrode. Fc/Fc+ was used as an internal reference, and the voltage measured was converted to NHE via the addition of 0.63 V. Fig. 3S and 4S (ESI†) show the CV graphs for all the sensitizers.
2.6. TiO2 electrode preparation and device fabrication
The photoanodes composed of nanocrystalline TiO2 and counter electrodes were prepared using procedures reported in the literature.20 Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glasses (thickness of 2.2 mm, sheet resistance of 8 Ω cm−2, TEC 8, Pilkington) were sequentially washed with detergent, deionized water, acetone, and absolute ethanol. After this, FTO glass plates were immersed in a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol. A thin layer (8–12 mm thick) of TiO2 (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was deposited (active area, 0.18 cm2) on a transparent conducting glass via squeegee printing. After drying the electrodes at 500 °C for 30 min, a scattered layer (5 mm thick) of TiO2 particles (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide R/SP) was printed. The TiO2 electrodes were heated under an airflow at 350 °C for 10 min, followed by heating at 500 °C for 30 min. After being cooled down to room temperature, the TiO2 electrodes were treated with 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with deionized water and absolute ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and left to cool down to 80 °C before being dipped into the dye solution. The dye solutions (0.3 mM) were prepared in 1:1:1 acetonitrile, tert-butyl alcohol, and DMSO. Deoxycholic acid was added to the dye solution as a co-adsorbate at a concentration of 20 mM. The electrodes were immersed in the dye solutions with the active area facing up and then kept at 25 °C for 20 h for the adsorption of dye on the TiO2 surface.
For preparing the counter electrode, pre-cut TCO glasses were washed with deionized water and then with 0.1 M HCl in EtOH and sonicated in acetone bath for 10 min. These washed TCO were then dried at 400 °C for 15 min. A thin layer of Pt-paste (Solaronix, Platisol T/SP) on TCO was printed, and the printed electrodes were then cured at 450 °C for 10 min. The dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes were sandwiched with Pt counter electrodes, and the electrolyte (Solaronix, Iodolyte HI-30) was then injected into the cell, whereas the two electrodes were held together with clips.
2.7. Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the devices fabricated from SD-1, K77-7, and N719 were measured using the Keithley 2400 source meter under illumination of AM 1.5G solar light from a solar simulator (SOL3A, Oriel) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (91160, Oriel). The incident light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Newport Oriel, 91150V) to be set at 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2). The measurement was fully controlled using the Oriel IV Test Station software. IPCE (incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency) experiments were carried out using a system (QEX10, PV N NO O Measurements, USA) equipped with a 75 W short-arc xenon lamp (UXL-75XE, USHIO, Japan) as a light source connected to a monochromator. Calibration of incident light was performed before measurements using a silicone photodiode (IF035, PV Measurements). All the measurements were carried out without the use of any anti-reflecting film.
2.8. Computational methods
Density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) using B3LYP, CAM-B3LYP, PBE1PBE, and M06-2X hybrid exchange–correlation functional methods was used to optimize the geometries of the dye sensitizer structures in their neutral forms.38–41 The functional PBE1PBE abbreviated as PBE0, which is weighed at 25% exchange and 75% correlation, was found effective in simulating ground-state geometry optimizations and absorption spectra for the sensitizers and bipyridyl-containing molecules.42,43 Calculations were conducted at different levels of basis sets for geometry optimization in the case of isolated dye molecules in DMF solvent. The conductor-like polarizable continuum solvent model (C-PCM), which treats the solvent as a homogeneous dielectric medium, has been employed to reproduce the DMF solvent effect.44 Singlet-to-singlet electronic transitions were calculated by time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT). The excitation spectrum was calculated for the optimized geometries for the first 50 singlet excited states. The ground-state oxidation potential (GSOP) based on Koopmans' theorem and the excited-state oxidation potential (ESOP) of the dyes, which is defined as the free energy difference between the neutral and oxidized species in the excited state, was calculated. E0–0 was approximated as the lowest singlet–singlet vertical transition of the system for the ground-state geometry of dyes to calculate the ESOP.45,46 The Ti24O48 model was constructed from the crystal structures of anatase to model the surface of TiO2 in the present study. The ground-state geometries of the pristine Ti24O48 cluster and each dye molecule were first separately optimized; then the ground-state geometry optimization of each dye anchored onto the Ti24O48 slab using the same PBE0 functional and 3-21g* basis set were used for excited state calculations for dye-anatase surface to obtain GSOP, E0–0, and ESOP47,48 of the dyes followed by anchoring of dyes to TiO2. Natural population analysis (NPA) at the PBE0 level for the neutral dyes, TiO2, and dyes–TiO2 models49 was performed, and finite difference approximation was used for the calculation of Fukui reactivity indices, which is the response of atoms to electrostatic potential variation.50 Dipole moments, polarizabilities, density of states (DOS), the difference in the charge between the ground state and the excited state for dyes on the TiO2 surface, the negative free energy difference (−ΔGinject), which is the injection potential of electrons from the excited states of dye molecules to the semiconductor substrate, calculated as the difference between the oxidation potential of the excited dye (Edye*) and the reduction potential of the conduction band of TiO2, as well as the negative free energy of dye regeneration (−ΔGregen), which is the difference between the oxidation potential of the dye and the redox potential of the electrolyte I−/I3−, were calculated. All theoretical calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09.A.02 quantum chemistry package,51 and GaussSum52 was used for the visualization of UV absorption and DOS.

In Fig. 3, the absorption peak found for SD-1 at 544 nm with an extinction coefficient of 23876 M−1 cm−1 was assigned to the MLCT transition as compared to the peak at 537 nm with an extinction coefficient of 17886 M−1 cm−1 for the N,N′-diaryl sensitizer K77-7. The introduction of a stronger electron-donating N,N′-dialkyl ancillary ligand resulted in higher molar extinction coefficients as compared to that of N,N′-diaryl of K77-7. Furthermore, in the case of SD-1, the alkyl groups are electron donating via the inductive as well as hyper-conjugation effect as previously discussed,53 whereas the aryl groups decrease the electron density on nitrogen through resonance of the lone pair with π-electron system of two phenyl rings. Maximum absorption wavelength, λmax, of the low-energy MLCT was also red shifted for N,N′-dialkyl sensitizer by 7 nm as compared to that for the N,N′-diaryl sensitizer. A slight red shift from 542 nm to 540 nm by SD-1 as compared to the case of K77-7 was validated by calculating UV absorption wavelengths and vertical electronic excitation peaks using the TD-DFT methods (Table 1 and Fig. 3B). This effect can be attributed to the stronger electron-donating power of sp3-hybridized piperidine ring, which results in the destabilization of the HOMO (t2g), and translated into a smaller E0–0; hence, better LHE was obtained as compared to those of K77-7 and the benchmark N719, as shown schematically in the energy level diagram of Fig. 4.

The trend of the calculated UV-vis absorption spectra for SD-1, K77-7, and N719 given in Fig. 3B was in agreement with that of the experimental spectra, where N,N′-dialkyl sensitizer SD-1 showed red-shifted absorption as compared to the N,N′-diaryl sensitizer K77-7 in addition to the slight red-shifted spectra observed for both of them as compared to that observed for N719. This is one of the strongest evidence that confirms the advantage of using SD-1 over N719 or K77-7 for high-efficiency DSSCs. These results provided strong evidence that increase in the number of aryl groups attached to sp3 nitrogen decreases the electron density on nitrogen.
3.2. Electrochemical measurements
The ground-state oxidation potentials (GSOP) of SD-1 and K77-7 were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in solution, and the results are summarized in Table 2. CV voltammograms were used to calculate the oxidation onset that is equivalent to the GSOP (ground-state oxidation potential) or the HOMO level of the dye. Additionally, E0–0 was calculated from the onset of the absorption spectrum. The values of E0–0 and GSOP were used to calculate the ESOP (excited-state oxidation potential), and the values in volts (V) against NHE were converted into electron volt (eV) by adding a value of 4.7 as given in eqn (1). ESOP = [(GSOP (V) + 4.7) − E0–0] eV(1)GSOP, ESOP, and E0–0 are important photoelectrochemical dye parameters that can help us to gain better insight into the potential excited-state electron injection and dye regeneration quantitatively by comparing these values for the dyes as well as with the I3−/I− and TiO2 energy levels.54–56 The difference in the energy between the ESOP and TiO2 CB edge has been rationalized as electron injection free energy, and the difference in the energy of the GSOP from the redox potential of I3−/I− is the dye regeneration free energy. This interrelationship between the GSOP, ESOP, electron injection, and dye regeneration for SD-1, K77-7, and N-719 is summarized in Fig. 4. The GSOP values of −5.52 and −5.68 eV for SD-1 and K77-7, respectively, confirmed that the HOMO level of both of these dyes was more negative than that of the I3−/I− redox couple (−5.2 eV), there was enough thermodynamic driving force for efficient dye regeneration, and the GSOP of SD-1 was more destabilized than that of K77-7. Additionally, the ESOP values of SD-1 and K77-7 were −3.76 and −3.83 eV, respectively, which lie above the conduction band edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 (−4.2 eV), and the ESOP of SD-1 is more destabilized than that of K77-7, which results in more negative free energy of electron injection of the former into the CB edge of TiO2.

DFT calculations confirmed the slightly decreased optical gap for SD-1 shown by the E0–0 values for sensitizers independent of functional and basis set (given in Table 2). SD-1 sensitizer has stronger polarization in the acceptor direction, as given in the ESI,† due to the absence of aryl group; this leads to lower vertical energy and excitation energy and enhanced overall photovoltaic efficiency.
Furthermore, electrostatic potential surface map calculations were carried out to determine the electron donor and acceptor differences between sensitizers for ground-state equilibrium molecular geometry, and the results are given in Fig. 5. Blue-red color representations with the same gradient were used for visualization, where blue color represents low electrostatic potential and red color represents high electrostatic potential parts. Both representations show that the –NCS groups are the main electron donors. Extension of the electron donor site towards 4-piperidin-1-yl direction was observed for SD-1 for the same gradient parameters pointed by the red areas in square in Fig. 5a, which clarifies the reason for the increased efficiency for SD1. However, no electron density was observed on the ancillary ligand of K77-7 due to the conjugated and delocalized electrostatic potential over the phenyl groups.

Atomic charges for K77-7 and SD-1 based on the natural population analysis were calculated. The calculated charges are for the structures coordinated by metallic center, and only charges for electron donor sites are given in Fig. 6. The main difference in the charges is the slightly higher negative charge on the nitrogen atom of piperidine in the electron donor site of the SD-1. The difference is not significant, which indicates that there should be another effect for the significant enhancement of the SD-1 photovoltaic efficiency.

Although atomic charges and electrostatic potential maps are important indicators to determine atoms susceptible for electron donation, real comparison of this susceptibility can only be understood when the system stimulated with voltaic difference with excitation and donate an electron. Finite difference approximation based on Fukui electrophilic and nucleophilic reactivity indices, which were calculated via the addition and subtraction of an electron to determine the most susceptible sites to electrophilic and nucleophilic attacks, is given in Fig. 7. According to our approach, the most sensitive sites for the addition of an electron to dye molecule are those that are the most electron deficient and the most susceptible to nucleophilic attack. Susceptible sites for the addition of an electron determine acceptor sites, i.e., sites susceptible to nucleophilic attack. These sites were determined to be on the phenyl groups and carboxylic acid group as electron acceptors independent of dye sensitizer structures.
 Fig. 7  (A) Atomic IDs and (B) Fukui reactivity indices for the electrophilic and nucleophilic attack sites according to these IDs for dye sensitizers. 
Susceptible sites for the donation of an electron by dye define the electrophilic attack sites. It was shown that Ru(II)c center and –NCS groups were the most susceptible sites for electron donation (electron richest) on the N719, as expected. Highest susceptibility for electrophilic attack site, which is the most sensitive site as an electron donor, is determined as nitrogen atom of 4-piperidin-1-yl on SD-1 and 4-N,N′-diphenylaminophenyl group on K77-7. The reactivity indices that are relative values for the electron donation potential on the nitrogen atom (atom ID: 111 in Fig. 7A) are calculated to be 0.186 for SD-1 and have been found to be higher than the electron-donating potential of N in K77-7, calculated to be 0.156 (atom ID: 81 in Fig. 7A). According to this result, piperidin-1-yl group increases the electron transfer susceptibility in SD-1.
Another important descriptor to compare the photovoltaic performances of dye sensitizers is the dipole moment on the molecule towards the TiO2 direction, which is strongly related to the open-circuit photovoltage and overall power efficiency. Gräetzel and coworkers showed that the large vertical dipole moment (μ) of an adsorbed dye sensitizer in the TiO2 surface direction could significantly increase the efficiency of a dye-sensitized solar cell.57 DFT calculations showed that for both the electron-donating ancillary ligand SL-I state without an electron acceptor center and the SD-1 state coordinated by Ru(II), the dipole moment is higher than that of K77-7 and its ancillary ligand, as given in the ESI.† These dipole moments are given in Table 3 for both donor sites and the total molecule. It should be noted herein that K77-7 has higher total polarizability and hyperpolarizability as compared to SD-1 as a whole molecule mainly due to the polarizable aryl groups. However, the directionality of polarization and hyperpolarization is more important than polarizability. Although total polarizability and hyperpolarizability values for SD-1 are lower as compared to those of K77-7, the dipole moment component directed towards the acceptor is higher for SD-1. The charge difference between ground and excited states for TiO2 anatase surface was also calculated, and the results are given in Table 3. Injection potential and dipole moment advantages of SD-1 sensitizers can be observed in action via charge transfer to the TiO2 surface.

HOMO and LUMO orbital diagrams of the sensitizers are given in Fig. 8. All frontier highest occupied orbitals for N719 are evenly distributed over the symmetric cis-NCS groups. Similarly, all four frontier highest unoccupied orbitals for N719 are distributed on Ru(II) and bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid. These results are in accordance with susceptible donor and acceptor sites. HOMO–LUMO orbitals calculated by Gratzel in a previous study gave similar orbital graphs for N719.58 The first four highest occupied orbitals for SD-1 and K77-7 are delocalized on the –NCS groups, which are the most electron-rich sites. However, HOMO−5 and HOMO−6 are mostly on bis(4-piperidin-1-yl) and bis(4-N,N′-diphenylaminophenyl) for both SD-1 and K77-7, respectively. The contribution of these MOs in the higher occupied excited states caused the main difference between these two sensitizers. Higher dipole moment and electron localization on the nitrogen center of 4-piperidin-1-yl resulted in the enhanced electron donor potential in the HOMO−5 and HOMO−6 orbitals of SD-1; this led to the increased overall photovoltaic efficiency.
 Fig. 8  Frontier occupied and unoccupied orbitals for (A) SD-1, (B) K77-7, and (C) N719. 
Electrostatic potential surfaces and highest occupied and unoccupied orbitals of dye sensitizers anchored by their carboxylic acid groups onto Ti24O48 surface are given in Fig. 9. Electrostatic potential surfaces show that NCS groups have highest electrostatic potentials; thus, the highest occupied orbitals can be expected to be present in the NCS groups (Fig. 9A). TiO2 has both low (blue) and high electrostatic potential (red) parts; thus, both occupied and unoccupied frontier orbitals can be expected to be present on the TiO2 surfaces. According to the electrostatic potential surfaces, the outer surface of TiO2 slab has higher electrostatic potential than the inner part of the slab. Moreover, 4-piperidin-1-yl on SD-1 and 4-N,N′-diphenylaminophenyl group on K77-7 have low electrostatic potential, where unoccupied frontier orbitals can be expected to be present.

HOMO, HOMO−1, and HOMO−2 are on the NCS group, similar to the case of its isolated state for N719, and HOMO−3 is determined to be on pyridine, which is coordinated by a tributyl ammonium group. All the lowest unoccupied orbitals are located on the TiO2 anatase surface, which are expected to be responsible for good performance of a dye sensitizer. The highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied orbitals for SD-1 and K77-7 on the anatase surface are very similar. HOMO, HOMO−2, and HOMO−3 are on the electron-rich NCS groups and HOMO−1 is on the opposite outer side of the TiO2 surface; this is in agreement with the electrostatic potential surfaces. Unoccupied orbitals showed intriguing delocalization that started with the LUMO delocalized on the bipyridyl group of the ancillary ligand, LUMO+1 on the donor of the ancillary ligands, LUMO+2 on the bipyridyl of the acceptor moiety, which is in accordance with electrostatic potential surfaces, and LUMO+3 on the TiO2 slab, on which the dye is anchored.
DOS for the neutral and anchored complexes given in the ESI,† also showed more red-shifted E0–0 for SD1 as compared to that for K77-7. Both SD1 and K77-7 have significantly smaller E0–0 as compared to N719. The difference in DOS of K77-7 and SD-1 is mainly in the fingerprint region, where higher occupied orbitals are shifted towards HOMO and unoccupied orbitals are shifted towards LUMO more in the case of SD-1 than that of K77-7. These shifts increase the probability of electron transfer for SD-1 as compared to that for K77-7.
3.3. Photovoltaic device characterizations
The photovoltaic performance of the complexes SD-1 and K77-7 on the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was studied under standard AM1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) of one sun illumination using an electrolyte (Solaronix, Iodolyte HI-30; 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, and 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile). Fig. 10 shows the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the cells fabricated with the complexes SD-1, K77-7, and N719, where the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values are plotted as a function of wavelength.
 Fig. 10  Photocurrent action spectra (IPCE) obtained for the dyes SD-1, K77-7, and N719 anchored on the nanocrystalline TiO2 film. 
The strong photon harvesting features of the N,N′-dialkyl ligand translated into impressive external quantum efficiency for SD-1. Higher external quantum efficiency was achieved in the range of 400–580 nm for SD-1 than that for K77-7, with SD-1 outperforming N719 in the NIR region as well. Higher molar extinction coefficients of SD-1 translated into superior IPCE as compared to those of K77-7 or N719 in the visible and NIR regions, which resulted in a higher photocurrent density, as given in the I–V curve of Fig. 11. The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factors (FF), and overall cell efficiencies (η) are summarized in Table 4.

4. Conclusions
Herein, we investigated three heteroleptic Ru(II)-sensitizers via experimental and first-principles quantum mechanics calculation (DFT/TD-DFT) methods. In conclusion, a novel sensitizer, i.e., Ru(2,2′-bipyridine-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid)-4,4′-(bis(4-piperidin-1-yl)phenyl ethenyl)-(2,2′-bipyridine) (NCS)2, denoted as SD-1, with N,N′-dialkyl ancillary ligand was compared with N,N′-diaryl ancillary ligand containing sensitizer K77-7 and the benchmark dye N719. SD-1 achieved a higher molar extinction coefficient of 24.0 × 103 M−1 cm−1 and a higher efficiency of 8.5% than K77-7 with 8.0% efficiency and N719 with 7.7% efficiency under the same experimental device conditions. The enhanced light-harvesting ability of SD-1 was attributed to the presence of sp3-N as part of the piperidine ring, which increased charge transfer and dipole moment in the direction of TiO2 anatase, resulting in greater light harvesting and higher photovoltaic performance as compared to those of N719 and K77-7. This result was supported by DFT studies, which shows higher charge transfer to the anatase surface, higher polarization, and higher response to the electrophilic effects. The molecular modeling method developed in this study can be utilized as an effective screening tool for the development of more efficient sensitizers for DSSCs.
