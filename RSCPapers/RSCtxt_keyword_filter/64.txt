To improve the device performance, we utilize a phenothiazine-based dye for the postadsorption into the black dye anchored TiO2 nanoparticle surface. On the ground of the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency spectrum alternation, it is observed that the phenothiazine-based dye is inserted into the interstitial sites of the pre-adsorbed black dye molecules. This type of dye loading can (1) increase the light absorption for higher photocurrent density of the cosensitized devices and (2) suppress the back charge transfer from the conduction band of TiO2 to the electrolyte. The electrochemical characterizations confirm this conclusion. Finally, the efficiency is increased to 8.0%, which is improved by 27% and 23% when compared with the individual dye-sensitized devices.
To solve the energy crisis in the future, one of the most promising ways is to convert sunlight into electricity by solar cells. A high quality solar device should simultaneously meet the requirements of high efficiency, low cost, long-term stability as well as being environmentally friendly in terms of both material sources and processing. Unfortunately, there has been no such kind of solar cell that can satisfy all the requirements. Therefore, researchers have made continued efforts into the development of new device structures as well as fabrication techniques. The third-generation excitonic solar cells, such as dye (quantum dot)-sensitized solar cells, organic (polymer) solar cells and perovskite based solar cells,1–7 possess low fabrication cost while they suffer from either poor long-term stability or low solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency (PCE). However, due to the potential low cost for future industrial productions, increasing attention has been paid to the overall performance improvement.
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) take advantage of dye molecules for light absorption; they can be fabricated with liquid or quasi-solid-state electrolyte or solid-state hole transporting materials (HTM).8–17 In terms of device fabrication, liquid electrolyte infill is usually conducted by a convenient injection approach. Nevertheless, the electrolyte leakage and dye dissociation into liquid electrolyte are significant degradation mechanisms in this type of device structure.18 The corrosion on the counter electrode is also a main concern in the application of liquid electrolyte. The use of solid-state hole transporting materials (HTM) can significantly improve the device stability and avoid the problems,19 while the infiltration of HTM is usually conducted by spin coating, which poses severe challenge in the large area production. Furthermore, the spin coating process also causes considerable materials loss. Quasi-solid-state gel electrolyte based device show long-term stability and infiltration of the electrolyte can be conducted by the conventional injection method,20–23 which possesses the advantages of both liquid and solid-state devices. In specific, once the electrolyte heated up to around 80 °C, it is transformed to fluidic state which allows facile injection. When fluidic electrolyte cooling down to room temperature, it transforms back to pseudo-solid-state. Compared with the liquid electrolyte and solid state HTM based DSSCs, however, quasi-solid-state DSSCs are less investigated.
In DSSC, dye molecule plays the role as light harvester, and the light harvesting efficiency sets the threshold of final PCE. To date, several classes of molecular sensitizers have been developed such as ruthenium complexes based dyes (e.g. N719, N3 and N749), porphyrin based molecules as well as the organolead perovskite based materials.1,2,8,24 Notably, only the N749 dye (black dye) can extend the light absorption to the red and near-infrared (NIR) range, which provides possibility for high efficiency light harvesting. N749 has been widely used in the liquid electrolyte based DSSCs,25–27 while it is rarely seen in the quasi-solid-state devices. To take full advantage of the N749 dye molecules, for the first time we apply it for the sensitization of quasi-solid-state solar cells and explore the coadsorption of small organic sensitizers for the performance improvement.
The UV-vis-NIR absorption of the N749 solution shows typical absorption spectra ranging from visible to NIR (∼900 nm) (Fig. 1a and b), the dye-anchored TiO2 nanoparticle mesoporous film also presents light absorption to NIR region (Fig. 1c). With this broad spectral response, it is of great interesting in the liquid electrolyte based DSSCs and showed high photovoltaic performance, the PCE can reach around 11%.25–27 In the fabrication of quasi-solid-state DSSCs, we assemble the dye-soaked film into DSSC by stacking with Pt sputtered counter electrode separated by a thermal melting film. The quasi-solid electrolyte is injected through the holes predrilled in the counter electrode using an injection-and-evacuation fashion according to our reported method.23 It was finally sealed with a melting parafilm. The effective areas of the devices are controlled to be 0.196 cm2. The optimization shows that the anode film composed of 12 μm of transparent layer and 6 μm of scattering layer generate highest PCE of 6.32% (device 1), with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 13.76 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.632 V and fill factor (FF) of 72.7%.

In our previous investigation we found that the postadsorption of small molecules into the interstitial site of porphyrin sensitized anode films can significantly reduce the back reaction between the electrons on the conduction band of TiO2 and I3− species in the electrolyte.28 If the small molecules are dye sensitizers, the spectral response of the device can also be improved. Herein, we apply this method to improve the light harvesting of ruthenium based dye molecules. A phenothiazine-based dye (Fig. 1a, PT) is applied, which is synthesized according to our reported method.29 The absorption spectrum shows that PT presents one broadened absorption peak from blue end to ∼560 nm. It also noted that the absorption of N749 in the blue region (∼450 nm) is relatively weak (Fig. 1b and c). When they are coadsorbed on the anode film, the light absorption is able to be significantly improved (Fig. 1c). Therefore, the combination of these two kinds of dye molecules can be expected to improve the spectral response of the DSSCs.
A stepwise dye-loading method was used for the co-sensitization. For comparison, DSSC individually sensitized by PT (device 2) were also prepared, showing PCE of 6.5% (Fig. 2a). In the cosensitized devices, optimization shows that the dye soaking in N749 for 8 h, followed by immersing it in PT for 3 h can generate highest PCE of 8.0% (device 3), with Jsc of 17.59 mA cm−2 and Voc of 0.645 V (Fig. 2a). The photovoltaic parameters of all devices are summarized in Table 1 for easy reference. It can be concluded that after the adsorption of PT, the N749-sensitized device show remarkable efficiency enhancement.

To investigate the wavelength dependent light response of the devices, we performed incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) characterization (Fig. 2b). The IPCE is associated with the product of light harvesting efficiency (ηlh), charge injection efficiency (ηinj), and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll). From Fig. 2b, the IPCE spectrum of N749-sensitized device stretches from the visible light range to nearly 900 nm, which shows the typical photocurrent generation behaviour of the N749. The IPCE of cosensitized device is boosted in a broad wavelength similar to the black dye while exhibits a huge hump in 400–600 nm, this improvement is attributed to the PT dye molecules. Therefore, the significantly improved Jsc in the cosensitized device (17.59 mA cm−2) is mainly due to the improved light harvesting, which is consistent with the UV-visible spectra alternations where the co-sensitized film presents increased light absorption, especially at the absorption peaks of PT (Fig. 1b). The Voc of the co-sensitized device 3 (0.645 V) falls in between those of the devices sensitized by solely N749 (0.632 V) and PT (0.721 V).
In the process of optimization, we also tried the cocktail dye-loading approach that is to blend the two dyes together in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution for dye adsorbing, denoted as device 4. The IPCE of device 4 in Fig. 2b shows that the performance of N749 is quite low compared to the optimized device 3, the characteristic region of N749 from 600–900 nm becomes much lower, while the characteristic region of PT around 470 nm is a little higher. The final PCE is only 6.6%, showing negligible improvement when compared with the devices individually sensitized by N749 and PT.
Therefore, the stepwise method is an appropriate strategy for dye co-sensitization in this case. Detailed inspection shows that the IPCE of co-sensitized device 3 from 610 nm to 900 nm remains nearly unchanged compared with that of individually sensitized device 1, revealing that the post-adsorption of small organic dye would not cause detachment of pre-adsorbed N749 molecules. Therefore, by first incubating the N749 dye for an enough timespan to reach its saturated dye-loading concentration, we successfully avoid the competition in the cocktail dye-loading circumstance, obtaining an optimized dye-loading process.
To further justify the advantage of sequential dye soaking method for the efficiency improvement in the quasi-solid-state DSSCs, we fabricated another set of devices using the PT co-absorbed with a zinc porphyrin based dye (ZnP).28 Details are provided in the ESI.† J–V characteristics and IPCE spectra are also performed and presented in Fig. S1 and Table S1.† Remarkable results show that the PCE of the co-sensitized device is boosted to 9.2% (device 5, Table 1), which is comparable to the highest PCE in literature in quasi-solid-state DSSCs (9.1%).30 In addition, the device solely sensitized by the porphyrin molecule gives a PCE of 6.5% (Fig. S1 and Table S1†).
To gain insight into the charge transfer behaviour of the devices (co)sensitized by N749 and PT, we performed electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) under the dark conditions. As shown in Fig. 3a, the interception of EIS curves on the x-axis indicates the resistance of FTO glass surface. The straight lines at high frequencies imply ion diffusion resistance through the 3D anode network. They are overlapped, indicating similar ion transport speed in the devices. Further, the Nyquist arcs appeared at intermediate-frequency regime are associated with the recombination resistance (Rct) at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte, i.e., the recombination kinetics between conduction-band electrons in TiO2 and I3− species from the electrolyte. The calculated resistance values (Rct) are listed in Table S2;† the larger the Rct, the slower the recombination kinetics. It is noted that device 2 presents the largest Rct (1592.6 Ω, Table S2†). This is because the small molecular can form densely packed monolayer on the TiO2 surface which can much more effectively supress the back charge transfer.31 This result contributes to the higher Voc of PT sensitized device. Also, the lowest Voc of N749-sensitized device can be explained by its smallest Rct (287.2 Ω). The large molecules usually form less densely packed monolayer due to the steric repulsion, thus leading to more available site on the TiO2 surface for I3− approaching. Furthermore, the calculated Rct of co-sensitized device 3 is 443.1 Ω, in the middle of device 1 and 2. This observation is consistent with the Voc evolution as discussed above.
 Fig. 3  (a) Nyquist and (b) Bode phase plots of DSSCs based on individual N749 and PT sensitized electrode (device 1 and 2) and N749 + PT co-sensitized electrodes (device 3). 
On the other hand, from the Bode phase plots of the devices (Fig. 3b), the characteristic back charge transfer frequency (f) can be obtained, which corresponds to the peak of the Bode phase plot. The electron lifetime (τn) in the TiO2 film can be calculated from eqn (1): 
(1)where f is the characteristic frequency, corresponding to the peak in intermediate-frequency regime. The obtained τn values are also shown in Table S1.† It can be seen that the device sensitized by N749 alone displays the shortest τn among all the devices. While that with the co-adsorption of PT, the electron lifetime is prolonged, quite close to that of the individual PT sensitized device.
To further probe the recombination kinetics of the devices, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) curves were recorded, which can continuously record the lifetime of Voc from a steady state to dark equilibrium.32 Fig. 4 shows the OCVD profiles of devices 1 to 3. First the decay rate of the devices is quite slow, suggesting a reduced recombination rate in the quasi-solid state DSSCs. The correlation between Voc decay and electron lifetime (τ′n) can be expressed by eqn (2): 
(2)where KB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and e is the electron charge. Therefore, the electron lifetimes can be extracted from the initial slope of Voc decay curves. Firstly, the decay curves of device 1 presents the steepest slope while device 2 display the slowest one, which suggest the shortest electron lifespan of N749-sensitized device and the longest one of PT sensitized device. This variation matches well with the photovoltaic and EIS analysis of the devices sensitized by the two dyes.

In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time panchromatic light harvesting by using black dye in quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells. To further improve the performance, a small organic dye is inserted into the interstitial site of black dye on the TiO2 surface. The overall performance for the N749 and PT co-sensitized device is improved by 27% and 23% with respect to individual dye-sensitized devices. The device performance improvement is mainly due to the enhanced light harvesting in the short-wavelength region and reduced back charge transfer. Quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells possess unique advantages in the practical applications in terms of long-term stability, low cost and facile fabrication. The colorfulness and semitransparency are especially attractive in the building integrated photovoltaics. Our method in extending the spectral response and boosting the energy conversion efficiency would facilitate the future practical applications.
Experimental
Materials
All chemical reagents were used without further purification. Dye sensitizer N749, TiO2 paste were purchased from Dyesol company. PT molecule was synthesized according to our reported method.29 Chenodeoxycholic acid (≥97%) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Gel electrolyte containing I3−/I− is prepared according to the reported method with minor modifications.21
Device fabrication
A layer of ca. 6 μm TiO2 paste (20 nm in diameter) was printed onto the FTO conducting glass and then dried for 6 min at 150 °C. This procedure was repeated to prepare a thickness of ca. 12 μm and the resulting surface was finally coated by a scattering layer (ca. 6 μm) of TiO2 paste (200 nm). The final thickness of the electrodes is ca. 18 μm. These TiO2 electrodes were gradually heated under an air flow at 275 °C for 5 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, 470 °C for 30 min to remove polymers. Afterwards, these sintered films were soaked with 0.02 M TiF4 aqueous solution for 60 min at 70 °C, washed with deionized water, further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The black dye (N749, 0.2 mM) and deoxycholic acid (DCA, 10 mM) were dissolved in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution; and the organic dye (PT, 0.5 mM) was also dissolved in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1:1, v/v) solution. After cooling down to ca. 80 °C, the electrodes of device 1 and 2 were immersed in N749 solution and PT solution, respectively. They were placed for 12 h to reach enough dye loading for the maximum efficiency. The electrodes of device 3 were all firstly soaked in N749 solution for 8 h, and then they were transferred into PT solution for 3 h. The electrode of device 4 was immersed in a cocktail solution of 0.2 mM N749 and 0.5 mM PT for enough timespan to reach a stable dye loading state. Subsequently, the electrodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove the non-adsorbed dyes and dried in air. Pt counter electrodes were prepared by sputtering method at 15 mA for 90 s at a power 150 W. Two holes (0.75 mm in diameter) were pre-drilled in the FTO glass for introducing electrolyte. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt film (SX1170, thickness 60 μm) at ca. 100 °C. The quasi-solid electrolyte was melted at 80 °C and then introduced into the cell through the drilled holes in the back of the counter electrode using an injection and purge method and relaxed at 60 °C for 30 min before cooling down to room temperature. At last, the holes were sealed by parafilm and covering glass (0.1 mm thickness) at elevated temperature. The effective areas of all the TiO2 electrodes were 0.196 cm2.
Characterizations
Absorption spectra in the UV-vis-NIR region were carried out using Hitachi U-3501 UV-visible/NIR spectrophotometer. The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the assembled cells were measured by a semiconductor characterization system (Keithley 236) at room temperature in air under the spectral output from solar simulator (Newport) using an AM 1.5G filter with a light power of 100 mW cm−2. IPCEs of DSSCs were recorded in Solar Cell QE/IPCE Measurement System (Zolix Solar Cell Scan 100) using DC mode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out by applying bias of 700 mV under dark condition over a frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz and AC amplitude of 10 mV. The parameters were calculated from Z-View software (v2.1b, Scribner AssociatNe, Inc.). For the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements, the cell was first illuminated for 20 s to a steady voltage, then the illumination was turned off for 80 s and the OCVD curve was recorded, this process was repeated for three periods to further confirm the stability of the OCVD. The above two measurements were performed on a CHI 660D electrochemical workstation.
