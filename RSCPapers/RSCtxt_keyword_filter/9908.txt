    , Accepted 14th May 2017First published on 17th May 2017AbstractDye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant interest in the last few years as effective low-cost devices for solar energy conversion. We have analyzed the excited state dynamics of several organic dyes bearing both cyanoacrylic acid and siloxane anchoring groups. The spectroscopic properties of the dyes have been studied both in solution and when adsorbed on a TiO2 film using stationary and time-resolved techniques, probing the sub-picosecond to nanosecond time interval. The comparison between the spectra registered in solution and on the solid substrate evidences different pathways for energy and electron relaxation. The transient spectra of the TiO2-adsorbed dyes show the appearance of a long wavelength excited state absorption band, attributed to the cationic dye species, which is absent in the spectra measured in solution. Furthermore, the kinetic traces of the samples adsorbed on the TiO2 film show a long decay component not present in solution which constitutes indirect evidence of electron transfer between the dye and the semiconductor. The interpretation of the experimental results has been supported by theoretical DFT calculations of the excited state energies and by the analysis of molecular orbitals of the analyzed dye molecules.
Introduction
In recent years, research interest towards the development and improvement of Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells (DSSCs) has greatly increased. The major advantages of these devices are represented by their relatively easy fabrication procedure and their low production costs, which make them attractive in comparison with other systems currently employed for solar energy conversion.1,2 In DSSCs solar light is harvested by an organic or metalorganic dye molecule, linked on a nano-crystalline thin-film semiconductor through a molecular bridge. Upon photoexcitation, the dye injects electrons into the semiconductor conduction band (CB) allowing the generation of an external photocurrent across the device.3 The main advantage of DSSCs is connected with the possibility of employing thin-film semiconductor layers, thanks to a large effective surface area for light absorption, which greatly decreases the fabrication costs of the device, increasing at the same time the efficiency of charge separation between the dye and the semiconductor. In the last 20 years continuous improvements have been achieved in terms of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability, making it possible to incorporate DSSCs in the fabrication of colored photovoltaic modules to be installed on windows and walls.4 One of the essential aspects of DSSCs is represented by the light-absorbing dye, whose most important properties should meet the criteria for high absorption coefficients, long term stability, high yield for interfacial electron transfer into the semiconductor CB and relatively slow charge recombination dynamics. Although record PCE values of about 13% have been reported up to now for porphyrins5 and polypyridyl ruthenium complexes such as N3 and N719,3,6 the use of metal-free organic dyes offers several potential advantages, in terms of versatile synthetic strategies, low fabrication costs, low toxicity and high molar extinction coefficients. As a result of the continuous synthetic effort in this field, comparable PCE values to those achieved with metal containing dyes have recently been reported also in the case of a few organic photosensitizers.7 Generally, organic dyes present a D(donor)–π(bridge)–A(acceptor) structure, which allows for a rational design of the system and the independent optimization of the different block components. By systematically varying the structure of the different components it is possible to monitor the effect of each part of the dye on electron transfer efficiency. Triphenylamine systems have been widely used as donor moieties, leading to dyes with high conversion efficiencies.8 Recently, notable attention has been devoted to the optimization of the acceptor/anchoring groups, an essential part of the sensitizer, which should ensure a good electronic communication with the semiconductor and a stable binding with the surface.9 Currently, the most used anchoring group is represented by cyanoacrylic acid, mainly for its ability to form a bidentate linkage with TiO2, ensuring reasonably strong couplings between the dye and the semiconductor. Recently, however, different kinds of anchoring groups have been tested, such as rhodanine,10 carboxypyridines11 and alkoxysilanes.7,12 In particular silanols and alkoxysilane groups have the ability of forming strong Si–O–metal bonds, which have been shown to greatly improve device stability upon air and water exposure, limiting dye desorption from the surface.7,12
In order to investigate the effect of the anchoring group on the electron injection properties of organic photosensitizers, we have characterized newly synthesized dyes possessing either a 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane or a p-aminophenyltrialkoxysilane anchoring group and we have compared them with parent compounds bearing the more usual cyanoacrylic acid group (see Fig. 1 and Scheme 1). To have a good understanding of the relationship between the sensitizer structure and its efficiency, and to characterize its excited state dynamics, it is important to characterize both the excited states energies and the photodynamics of the system. The comparison between the excited state relaxation dynamics of the dye observed in solution and on the solid state surface can be useful to identify the factors influencing the efficiency and timescale electron injection and to spectroscopically identify marker bands connected with the occurrence of electron transfer towards the semiconductor. In this context, fast and ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy techniques have often been employed to determine the rate constants and quantum yields of the individual processes taking place on sensitized TiO2 films.13 Based on these consideration, we have firstly analyzed the solvent dependence of the spectroscopic properties of the synthesized molecules, by using both steady-state and time-resolved absorption spectroscopy.

Following this preliminary characterization, we have measured the transient absorption spectra (TAS) of the dyes when absorbed on a TiO2 film, with the aim of characterizing the dynamics of photoinduced electron transfer towards TiO2 and compare the performances of dyes with different anchoring groups. To complement the experimental investigations, a theoretical analysis, based on DFT/TDDFT calculations, was carried out, aimed at rationalizing the electronic structure of the dyes, and their excited state energies and charge transfer capabilities were characterized. The interplay between experimental and theoretical outcomes allowed us to elucidate important aspects regarding the photoinduced behavior of the analyzed compounds and individuate which of them could represent a promising system for photovoltaic applications.
Experimental section
Preparation of TiO2 functionalized films
The titania paste (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP, Solaronix, containing 100% anatase particles, average diameter 15–20 nm, total TiO2 content 18% w/w, mixed with terpineol and ethylcellulose as organic binders) was screen-printed on a 2.5 cm × 2.5 cm sodalime glass substrate, and the resulting films (active area: 1.0 cm2) were sintered in a muffle furnace at 450 °C for 30 min. Titania films were then sensitized by immersion at 60–70 °C into the appropriate dye solution (5.0 × 10−4 M in toluene) for several hours up to overnight. After sensitization, the films were rinsed with EtOH and deionized water.
Spectroscopic measurements
Sub-picosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) has been carried out using a system based on a Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifier laser system (BMI Alpha 1000) and a fs-laser oscillator (Spectra Physics Tsunami). The details of the experimental system have been described in previous work.14 For the current measurements the pump wavelength has been fixed either at 400 nm, obtained by second harmonic generation of the fundamental laser radiation at 800 nm, or at 520 nm. Visible pulses have been obtained by mixing the output of a commercial optical parametric generator and amplifier (TOPAS by Light Conversion, Vilnius, Lithuania) with the residual laser fundamental.15,16 Excitation power was set at 100–150 nJ. The probe pulses have been obtained by focusing a portion of the 800 nm laser radiation on a 3 mm thick CaF2 window. Both pump and probe were focused on the sample with a 150 mm parabolic mirror, the spot size of both beams on the focus was about 100 μm. Transient spectra have been recorded for a time interval spanning between −5 and 1500 ps. The IRF of the system was about 150 fs. The sample was contained in a quartz cell with a 2 mm optical path, mounted on a movable stage in order to minimize photodegradation. Solid state samples were directly mounted on the same motorized stage used for solution samples. The OD of all analysed samples was between 0.2 and 0.5 at the excitation wavelength. Visible absorption spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer LAMBDA 950, while fluorescence was recorded using a Perkin Elmer LS55 fluorometer.
Data analysis
Femtosecond transient absorption spectra have been analysed by global analysis, which consists of the simultaneous fitting of all the collected kinetic traces by means of exponential functions. The number of kinetic components has been identified by singular values decomposition (SVD).17,18 Global analysis has been performed using the GLOTARAN software (http://glotaran.org),19,20 and employing a linear unidirectional kinetic scheme. Transient spectra were numerically corrected for the chirp of the white light pulse before global analysis, using a third order polynomial function.
Computational methods
DFT and TDDFT calculations on compounds DF15, MB25, MB56, MM35 and MM62 have been performed using the Gaussian 09, Revision C.01 suite of programs.21
Geometry optimization was carried out in vacuo using the B3LYP functional22,23 and the standard 6-31G* basis set for all atoms. Methyl groups have been used in place of the alkyl chains to reduce the computational cost.
The absorption maximum (λamax), vertical excitation energy (Eexc) and oscillator strength (f) in solution were calculated on the minimum structures via time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) at the CAM-B3LYP/6-31G*24 and MPW1K/6-31G*25 levels. Solvent effects have been included by using the polarizable continuum model (PCM).26
Geometry optimizations of the dyes on TiO2 was carried out using a Ti16O32 model which has been proven to be a suitable model for computing energies and molecular orbitals of organic dyes/TiO2 systems.27–30 The dyes were anchored on the semiconductor using a bidentate bridging mode and the optimizations of the dye/TiO2 systems were performed using the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level, in which the standard LANL2DZ basis set was used for the Ti atom.
The absorption maximum (λamax), vertical excitation energy (Eexc) and oscillator strength (f) of dyes on TiO2 were calculated on the optimized structures at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level in which the standard LANL2DZ basis set was used for the Ti atom; for the sake of comparison, λamax, Eexc and f for DF15, MB25, MB56, MM35 and MM62 dyes in CH2Cl2 were also computed at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory.
The total densities of states (TDOS) and partial densities of states (PDOS) for the optimized isolated dyes and dye/TiO2 structures were obtained using GaussSum 3.0.31 DOS spectra were obtained by convoluting orbital contributions with Gaussian curves of a full width at half maximum of 0.3 eV.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of the new dyes
Two photosensitizers with a structure related to the well-known organic dye D532 were selected as reference compounds (Fig. 1).
The first one, DF15, differs from dye D5 for the presence of hexyloxy substituents on the terminal donor group, while the second, MB25, for the introduction of a propylene-dioxythiophene (ProDOT) unit endowed with two n-pentyl chains in the π-spacer. The two backbones were designed to allow an evaluation of the influence of the relative position and orientation of the long alkyl substituents on different parameters, such as the charge transfer nature of the excited states and the kinetics of the corresponding electron exchange events.
The preparation procedure of dye DF15 was previously described,11 and was slightly modified in the case of MB25 to allow the insertion of the ProDOT moiety. The two cyanoacrylic dyes were then elaborated by introduction of three different (trialkoxoxysilyl)acetamido-groups, leading to dye MM35, having an alkyl chain as the spacer, and dyes MM62 and MB56, having an aromatic ring in the same position (Scheme 1). It should be pointed out that the difference of terminal groups between MM62 (having a triethoxysilyl moiety) and MB56 (featuring a trimethoxysilyl group instead) should ultimately be inconsequential, since these compounds are supposed to bind to TiO2 by means of a transesterification reaction, forming at least two new Si–O–Ti bonds and releasing the corresponding alcohols.33
To forge the amide bond of dyes MM35, MM62 and MB56 we followed different procedures depending both on the sensitizer backbone and the different anchoring groups, whose detailed description will be reported elsewhere.34 Briefly, preparation of MM35 took place by means of the same protocol reported to obtain the known sensitizer ADEKA-1:35 thus, compound DF15 was first reacted with oxalylchloride, and the resulting acyl chloride was treated with 3-(triethoxysilyl)propylamine and triethylamine to give the desired product in reasonable yield.
For the preparation of MM62, DF15 was instead treated with 4-iodoaniline using EDC-Cl/HOBt as a coupling agent. After purification, 4-iodophenylamide 1 was isolated in satisfactory yield and could be reacted with triethoxysilane in the presence of Hunig's base and a Pd2(dba)3/JohnPhos mixture as the catalyst,36 yielding the product with good efficiency. Finally, dye MB56 could be prepared in moderate yield by reacting 4-(trimethoxysilyl)aniline with triphosgene to get the corresponding 4-(trimethoxysilyl)phenylisocyanate,37 and treating the latter in situ with compound MB25 in the presence of DIPEA.
Static spectroscopic characterization
The absorption spectra of all the analyzed compounds have been recorded in dichloromethane, benzene, acetonitrile and on TiO2 films. In Fig. 2, the absorption spectra of DF15 and its ethoxysilane derivative MM35 are compared in panels A and B. The absorption spectra of the second derivative, MM62, are reported in ESI.† Both DF15 and its ethoxysilane derivatives MM35 and MM62 show an absorption band in the visible region, peaked near 500 nm. The exact position of the maximum absorption depends on the solvent. In the case of DF15, absorption peaks at 528 nm in dichloromethane where the band furthermore shows a broadened red-tail. The absorption maximum then peaks at 515 nm in benzene and at 495 nm in acetonitrile, thus showing dependence both on polarity and polarizability of the external medium. Similar trends are observed for both MM35, whose absorption maxima are at 501 nm in dichloromethane, 498 nm in benzene and 483 nm in acetonitrile, and MM62, thus demonstrating that the produced modifications of the anchoring part of the molecule do not affect to a high extent the nature of its low lying electronic state.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of: panel (A) DF15; panel (B) MM35; panel (C) MB25 in dichloromethane (black lines), benzene (red lines) and acetonitrile (blue lines). Panel D reports the absorption spectra of all the analysed compounds on a TiO2 film. 

Fig. 2 also reports the absorption spectra of MB25 in the three analysed solvents (panel C). In this case, besides the band at ca. 500 nm, the absorption spectra show the appearance of two higher energy bands, respectively, peaking at about 360 and 315 nm. The spectra of the corresponding ethoxysilane derivative MB56 are reported in the ESI;† also in this case, modification of the anchoring part of the molecule has a minor effect on the steady-state absorption.
Finally panel D reports the spectra of all the analysed molecules when adsorbed on a TiO2 substrate. Under the conditions employed for sensitization (500 μM dye concentration, 16 h immersion time) the resulting dye coverage could be considered homogeneous on the entire film surface, as previously observed for Ru-based and organic dyes.33 All the spectra appear to be blue-shifted if compared with the respective absorption measured in dichloromethane; however a broadening towards the red part of the spectrum is observed, which is more pronounced in the case of siloxane compounds. The blue shift is particularly evident in the case of molecules bearing a cyanoacrylic anchoring group (the maximum absorption shifts at 458 nm in the case of both DF15 and MB25), which is most probably due to deprotonation of the carboxylic group on the surface. The observed shift is in fact in line with the computed difference in the vertical excitation energy between neutral and deprotonated forms (see Table S1, ESI†). In the other cases the blue shift observed with respect to the solution may be caused by the formation of H-aggregates on the surface, which is commonly observed in DSSC photoanodes prepared without the addition of any anti-aggregating agent.13,38,39
Together with individual dye properties (such as structure, light-harvesting ability, electronic distribution and geometry of adsorption on TiO2) aggregate formation is one of the most important parameters to control in order to improve DSSC efficiency.40 Suppression of such detrimental behaviour is usually pursued both by the introduction of long alkyl chains on dye structures41,42 (be they organic D–π–A dyes, phorphyrins or squaraines)43–45 and by the addition of co-adsorbates into the dye solution when sensitizing TiO2 films, the most popular of which is chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA).46,47
The sensitizers studied in this work were indeed endowed with long alkyl chains, either in the donor (DF15, MM35, MM62) or in the intermediate conjugate section (MB25, MB56), precisely to avoid excessive aggregate formation on the TiO2 surface. Nevertheless, such behaviour could still be hypothesized in the case of dye DF15 following the observation that photovoltaic performances of the corresponding DSSCs improved upon the addition of CDCA.11 To test this hypothesis, we recorded the UV-Vis absorption spectra of DF15 adsorbed on TiO2 at different staining times, with and without the co-sensitizer (Fig. S3, ESI†). It could be noticed that, when the staining was conducted for 16 h, the sensitizer absorption peak was significantly blue-shifted (approx. 25 nm) and broadened compared to that obtained after only 0.5 h of immersion. Such a trend could be partially reversed upon the addition of CDCA, indicating that the progressive formation of aggregates was indeed related to the observed changes in the absorption spectrum. A similar change, although much less pronounced (approx. 10 nm), could be observed in an analogous experiment in which the absorption spectrum of MM62 was measured both in the absence and in the presence of dodecyltriethoxysilane (DES) used as a co-adsorbent (Fig. S3, ESI†). In this case, the smaller blue-shift of the peak maximum upon aggregation could perhaps be due to a lower amount of dye adsorbed on TiO2.
Fluorescence spectra of all dyes in the three analysed solvents are reported in Fig. S4 (ESI†). For both DF15 and its two siloxane analogues MM35 and MM62 fluorescence yields increase in benzene compared to the other two solvents and a very low fluorescence is observed in acetonitrile. Both MB25 and MB56 show fluorescence of comparable intensity in benzene and dichloromethane; lower fluorescence intensity is observed in acetonitrile also in this case. In all cases fluorescence spectra are very broad and usually blue shifted in benzene with respect the two other solvents.
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Measurements in solution
Transient absorption spectra have been recorded in solvents differing both in polarity and polarizability for all molecules in order to investigate the effect of the external medium on the electronic properties of the systems. DF15, MM35 and MM62 samples have been excited either at 400 or 520 nm, but changing the excitation conditions had no remarkable effect on the measured transient absorption spectra and on the dynamic evolution of the excited states, while MB25 and MB56 have been excited at 480 nm, in order to reach the lower excited state of the molecule. A notable effect both on the excited state lifetimes and on the spectral shapes can be observed depending on the solvent properties, in particular, in the case of DF15 and its alkoxysilane analogue MM35. The quantitative analysis of the data obtained by the ultrafast transient absorption experiments has been performed by global analysis, which retrieves both the kinetic constants necessary to describe the dynamic evolution of the system and the corresponding spectral contributions (evolution associated decay spectra EADS).20 In the majority of cases three kinetic components have been necessary in order to accurately fit the kinetic traces. Fig. 3 reports the EADS obtained by analyzing the transient absorption data recorded for DF15 and MM35 in dichloromethane, and the kinetic traces registered at the maximum of the excited state absorption band (625–650 nm) in all the analyzed solvents for both molecules, together with the fit obtained by global analysis. The EADS registered in acetonitrile and benzene are reported in the ESI,† together with those obtained for the remaining compounds MM62, MB25 and MB56. In the case of MM62 we could not measure transient absorption spectra in acetonitrile, due to the extremely low solubility of the dye in this solvent. In order to have an idea of the effect of solvent polarity on the excited state properties of this molecule we registered transient spectra in another polar solvent, DMSO, where the molecule is more soluble. The observed behavior of MM62 is in line with the trend observed for the other compounds.
 Fig. 3  EADS obtained by the global analysis of transient data recorded for (A) DF15 in dichloromethane; (B) MM35 in dichloromethane. Panels (C) and (D) respectively report the kinetic traces at 625 nm registered for DF15 in the three solvents (scattered points) and the kinetic trace registered at 650 nm for MM35 in all the analysed solvents. Red lines underlying the kinetic traces lines on panels C and D represent the fit resulting from global analysis. The structured noise appearing in the short time spectral component is due to interference effects caused by dielectric mirrors used in the experiment which lasts for the duration of the white light chirped pulse. 
The transient absorption spectra of DF15 and MM35 reported in Fig. 3 are qualitatively very similar. In both cases a very broad excited state absorption band can be noticed, besides a negative feature corresponding to the bleaching of the ground state absorption. The transient spectrum of MM62 in the same solvent, reported in the ESI,† is again very similar. For all molecules, the excited state absorption band increases in intensity and broadens towards the red on ca. 1 ps timescale (black to red evolution in Fig. 3A and B). On a short timescale after excitation several processes can occur, concerning both the relaxation of the initially excited state and reorganization of the solvent. In analogy with what observed in similar dyes presenting a D–π–A structure,13 the spectral evolution occurring on a few ps timescale can be indicative of the evolution from an initial local excited state (LE) to an excited state with charge transfer character (CT). This is confirmed by the analysis of the HOMO and LUMO molecular orbitals of the dyes, reported in the ESI,† showing that the transition corresponding to the excitation towards the S1 state, which can be mostly described as an HOMO–LUMO transition, determines a pronounced electron density migration from the donor to the acceptor part of the molecule. In dichloromethane, the excited state absorption band significantly decays on a 10 ps timescale for DF15. The timescale of the decay increases to 40 ps in the case of MM35, while the residual signal recovers in ca. 750 ps/1 ns. In the case of MM62 in dichloromethane an additional evolution on a 2 ps timescale is observed, which can be ascribed to vibrational relaxation, which is accompanied by a slight blue shift and narrowing of the excited state absorption band. The following decay of the excited state absorption occurs on a 46 ps timescale. When measurements are repeated in the more polar solvent acetonitrile (DMSO for MM62) the observed spectral shapes and the dynamic evolution of the transient signals are qualitatively similar to what was observed in dichloromethane. The difference is an overall acceleration of the excited state dynamics and of the recovery of the ground state. The excited state signals in fact mostly recover in 3.8 ps in the case of DF15, with a residual decay occurring in 60 ps. In the case of MM35 and MM62 ground state recovery occurs respectively in 7.6 and 21 ps. When measurements are performed in benzene, the excited state absorption band appears to be more structured for both DF15 and MM35, while it is again very broad in the case of MM62. In this solvent, excited state relaxation is significantly slower than what was previously observed in more polar media, in agreement with the increased fluorescence yield observed for the three dyes. For both DF15 and MM62, besides an initial evolution occurring on a <1 ps timescale, which can be ascribed to the relaxation of the initially hot excited state, a further dynamics evolution is observed on a 7–10 ps timescale. The associated spectral changes mostly consist in a blue shift, narrowing and increasing in intensity of the excited state absorption band, which induces association of this dynamic evolution with vibrational cooling and solvent induced structural relaxation of the excited state. In the case of MM62 the transient spectra in benzene are qualitatively similar to those observed in dichloromethane and acetonitrile, but a significant increase of the excited state lifetime is observed.
Although with several specific differences, the overall excited lifetime is dependent on the solvent polarity for all derivatives, resulting quite short in acetonitrile (DMSO for MM62), intermediate in dichloromethane and significantly longer in benzene. This finding further suggests that the excited state stabilized upon visible excitation in polar media has a significant charge transfer nature, as expected in the case of push–pull dyes.48–50
As already noticed from steady state absorption spectra, the similarity in the transient absorption spectral shapes and in the trend observed for the solvent effect on the excited state lifetime confirms that modification of the cyanoacrilic group present in DF15 by either a 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane and a p-aminophenyltriethoxysilane anchoring group has a minor effect on the excited state electronic distribution (see ESI†). On the contrary, in the case of MB25 and MB56, several differences could be noticed. Although the spectral shape of the transient spectra of these two molecules is qualitatively similar to what was observed for DF15, the excited state absorption band is narrower and slightly red shifted in MB56. Furthermore, the solvent effect is less pronounced. In all solvents the excited state lifetime is on the ns timescale, and appears to be slightly longer in dichloromethane as compared with acetonitrile and benzene. This finding suggests that the excited state reached upon excitation at 480 nm in both MB25 and MB56 has less charge transfer character as compared with the previously analysed compounds, by the effect of structural modification introduced in these systems if compared with DF15.
The lifetimes obtained by global analysis for all the investigated compounds in the different solvents are summarized in Table 1.

Measurements on TiO2 films

Fig. 4 reports the transient absorption spectra of all the dyes when absorbed on a TiO2 film. In all cases, the excited state lifetime increases significantly upon absorption on the semiconductor surface, which is already an indirect indication of the occurrence of electron injection towards the semiconductor. With the exception of MM62, showing an extremely broad excited state absorption band, the transient spectral shape is qualitatively similar for all dyes. Soon after excitation, a very broad absorption band is visible in the spectra, which partly decreases in intensity on a 0.5–2 ps timescale. On the same timescale, the spectral shape of the excited state band becomes more structured, allowing us to distinguish a double peak structure. The appearance of an excited state band peaking in the 700–750 nm region has been ascribed to the formation of the dye radical cation upon electron injection into the semiconductor substrate in similar systems, in particular, in the D5 molecule, which is a structural analogue of DF15, lacking the long-chain alkoxide substituents on the triarylamine group.10,51,52 Based on previous studies and on the comparison between the normalized spectral shapes of the last EADS measured in solvents and on TiO2, shown in the ESI† in the case of DF15, we could thus associate the red-most absorption band to the cation of the dyes. Although the appearance of the cation band can be observed for most of the dyes on a very short timescale (<1 ps), it is very difficult to disentangle all the processes occurring upon light absorption, since they can include relaxation of initially excited hot molecules, vibrational and structural relaxation of the excited dyes, ultrafast injection and excited state annihilation due to the close proximity of the dye molecules absorbed on the surface. In most cases it has been observed that electron injection from organic dyes can occur in a multi-exponential way13,38,39,51 from both the unrelaxed and relaxed excited states. In any case, the analysis of the transient absorption spectra suggests that the electron injection process occurs at least in part on a very short timescale all the analysed compounds, as previously reported for similar organic dyes.10
 Fig. 4  EADS obtained by the global analysis of transient data recorded for all the investigated dyes when absorbed on a TiO2 film. (panel A: DF15; panel B: MM35; panel C: MM62; panel D: MB25; panel E: MB56.) Panel F shows the comparison between the normalized kinetic traces recorded at 720 nm for different molecules. 
The analysis of the kinetic traces at a wavelength of >700 nm, due to the cation absorption, can provide information on the semiconductor–dye recombination kinetics and on the amount of injected electrons, which reach the conduction band of the substrate. As can be noticed in Fig. 4, panel F, the kinetic traces registered at 720 nm for all dyes show a fast bi-exponential decay component and a long lasting offset. The fast decay is associated with rapid charge recombination due to the electrons injected on the surface of the semiconductor, or with cation quenching due to dye aggregation on the surface. The timescale of the fast recombination process spans between a few ps and 90 ps, which is in reasonable agreement with what was previously observed for other organic D–π–A dyes.53 A qualitative dependence on the anchoring group can be observed: in the case of alkoxysilane dyes it appears that the substitution of the cyanoacrylic moiety with a 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane group decreases the recombination rate, the measured timescale (besides the initial ultrafast decay, which is also associated with excited state relaxation of the absorbed dyes) resulting ca. 20 ps in the case of DF15 and MB25 and 90 ps in the case of MM35: such effect could be due to the larger distance of the chromophore from the semiconductor surface, as determined by the presence of the non-conjugate propyl spacer.54 When p-aminophenyltriethoxysilane is used, as in the case of MM62, the timescale of fast recombination shortens to ca. 14 ps, possibly as the effect of the increased conjugation of the anchoring group, or of a different absorption geometry on the semiconductor surface.55 It has to be pointed out that the relatively large amount of the fast decay component could result from the preparation procedure adopted for the colored films, which did not involve the addition of any anti-aggregating agent to the dye solution, and to the fact that TAS measurements have been performed by directly exposing the film to air. Furthermore, no electrolyte able to regenerate the dye has been used in our preparation. Several ultrafast spectroscopy studies executed on real cells have shown that the addition and the nature of the electrolyte can induce modifications both on the electron injection and charge recombination timescale.13 The principal aim of our work was to compare the electron injection capabilities of the different analyzed dyes, in order to evaluate the effects of the produced structural modifications. To fulfil this purpose, we have at the moment only considered transient measurements executed in air and without the addition of the electrolyte, extension of this study will be the object of future work. In order to evaluate the electron injection capabilities of the dyes, here we have compared the relative amount of the constant offset measured at >700 nm, which, being due to the long lived cation form of the dye, can be connected with the amount of electrons injected in the semiconductor CB.10 As evidenced in Fig. 4, panel F, DF15 and MB25 show the most intense residual signal. The constant offset for both MM35 and MM62 is only slightly smaller with respect to DF15, while that of MB56 is reduced to almost 1/3 of the value measured for the corresponding dye bearing the cyanoacrylic moiety. The outcomes of time resolved measurements thus suggest that the modifications produced both on the anchoring group and on the molecular backbone should guarantee that the efficiency of the newly synthesized dyes would remain in most cases comparable to that previously measured in the case of DF15.11
Computational results
Isolated dyes
TDDFT absorption maxima (λamax), vertical excitation energies (Eexc) and oscillator strengths (f) of CH2Cl2, C6H6 and CH3CN are shown in Table 2. Calculations show that the main visible band in the spectrum of all dyes is due to a HOMO → LUMO transition and, in agreement with experimental values, the vertical excitation energies are computed in the 2.52–2.63 eV and 2.40–2.51 eV ranges at the CAMB3LYP/6-31G* and MPW1K/6-31G* levels of theory, respectively. The higher energy bands recorded in the spectra of MB25 and MB56 are predicted to be at about 3.7 eV at the CAMB3LYP level and 3.5 eV at the MPW1K level for the computed S2 state of MB25 and at about 3.9 eV at both functionals for the computed S3 state of MB56 (see Table S1, ESI†). These values well agree with the experimental ones of about 3.4 eV and 3.9 eV for MB25 and MB56, respectively.

The energy values of the FMOs for all the computed structures of DF15, MB25, MB56, MM35 and MM62 dyes are reported in Table S3 (ESI†). The wave function plots of the corresponding orbitals are shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). The plot shows that the HOMOs of all dyes are mainly localized on the triphenylamine donor group and the π-conjugated unit. Concerning the LUMOs, in the case of DF15 and MB25 dyes, the electron density distribution is shifted towards the cyanoacrylic acid anchoring groups while in the case of MB56, MM35 and MM62 dyes, the electron density remains substantially on the π-conjugated units. There is no significant contribution arising from siloxane anchoring moieties, which limits the intramolecular charge-transfer nature of the excitation process for MB56, MM35 and MM62 dyes.
Dyes/TiO2
The optimized geometries of dyes on TiO2 are shown in Fig. 5. Compared to their arrangement in solution, geometries of the dyes do not show any major change upon binding to TiO2. Indeed the dihedral angles between the donor and the π-conjugated units and between the spacer and the cyanoacrylic acid (see dihedral angles in Fig. 5) do not significantly deviate from planarity either when isolated or upon binding the semiconductor, meaning that the degree of π conjugation is conserved. As a consequence, the energy values of the HOMOs for the isolated DF15, MB25, MB56, MM35 and MM62 dyes are comparable with those for the same dyes on TiO2 (Fig. 6). The LUMO energy levels instead are considerably stabilized when bound to TiO2 thus reducing the H → L energy gap. This is consistent with the red-shifted absorption maxima computed for all the dye/TiO2 systems (see Table 3). Nevertheless, as previously reported,56 on going from dye/solvent to dye/TiO2 systems, the observed blue- or red-shift of the absorption maximum is rather mainly caused by the protonation state of the dye in solution and by the dye aggregation which, in turn, depends on the dye packing on the surface and thus it is not predictable. For all these reasons and contrarily to the predicted reduced energy gap, a blue shift is observed in the experimental UV/Vis absorption spectra of all dyes/TiO2 systems (see Fig. 2D).

The complete set of TDDFT absorption maxima (λamax), vertical excitation energies (Eexc) and oscillator strengths (f) for DF15, MB25, MB56, MM35 and MM62 dyes on TiO2 are shown in Table 3. For comparison, the same values are also reported for DF15, MB25, MB56, MM35 and MM62 dyes in CH2Cl2 computed at the CAM-B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory.
It is well known that the efficiency of the electron injection is influenced by the electronic coupling between the dyes and the TiO2. The coupling is stronger in the presence of a consistent contribution of the virtual states of the dye to the dye/TiO2 unoccupied states. From the partial densities of states (PDOS) spectra in Fig. 7, it is evident that for all dyes, states above the conduction band edge with a certain contribution of dye are present. However, in the case of the silyl-anchor MB56, MM35 and MM62 dyes the energy levels of these virtual states are approximately equal to the energetic levels of the isolated dyes (see for comparison the TDOS of the isolated dyes in Fig. S9, ESI†), while for DF15 and MB25, there is a significant downshift of their energy toward the energy levels of the conduction band. This can be related to a stronger coupling for DF15 and MB25 and thus a more efficient injection process.

Conclusions
In this paper we reported the spectroscopic and theoretical characterization of a series of new dyes to be used for photovoltaic applications, differing in the anchoring group towards a TiO2 surface. In particular, three different dyes were analyzed bearing a siloxane anchoring moiety. The ground and excited state electronic properties of the dyes have been investigated both theoretically, at TD/DFT level, and experimentally by measuring the steady state and time resolved spectra in different solvents. Furthermore, the ability of electron injection towards a semiconductor surface has been assessed by measuring the transient absorption spectra of the dyes anchored on a TiO2 surface. All the studied compounds showed the ability to inject electrons into the semiconductor CB; however a fast charge recombination phase, which can be ascribed to dye aggregation or to the presence of local trap states on the semiconductor surface, has been observed. By comparing the residual intensity of the cation band recorded by transient absorption spectroscopy, it can be concluded that the efficiency of the these new compounds should remain comparable to that of the previously characterized DF15 dye.11 If compared with the corresponding carboxylic analogues, the alkoxysilane dyes showed a slight decrease of the long lived charge separated component, which, based on the results of the theoretical analysis, can be ascribed to a decreased electronic coupling with the TiO2 semiconductor. Nevertheless, considering the expected higher stability of the silane–TiO2 bond,34 our results indicate that the development of dyes bearing alkoxysilane anchoring groups is a promising strategy for improving the performances of DSSCs.

 	Fig. 1  Reference dyes with a cyanoacrylate anchoring group.	 

 	Scheme 1  Synthesis of alkoxysilane dyes.	 

 	Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of: panel (A) DF15; panel (B) MM35; panel (C) MB25 in dichloromethane (black lines), benzene (red lines) and acetonitrile (blue lines). Panel D reports the absorption spectra of all the analysed compounds on a TiO2 film.	 

 	Fig. 3  EADS obtained by the global analysis of transient data recorded for (A) DF15 in dichloromethane; (B) MM35 in dichloromethane. Panels (C) and (D) respectively report the kinetic traces at 625 nm registered for DF15 in the three solvents (scattered points) and the kinetic trace registered at 650 nm for MM35 in all the analysed solvents. Red lines underlying the kinetic traces lines on panels C and D represent the fit resulting from global analysis. The structured noise appearing in the short time spectral component is due to interference effects caused by dielectric mirrors used in the experiment which lasts for the duration of the white light chirped pulse.
