    , Accepted 18th November 2017First published on 18th November 2017AbstractWe for the first time employ bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide as a dopant for graphene to enhance the efficiency and the stability of graphene/Si quantum dot (SQDs)-embedded SiO2 (SQDs:SiO2) multilayer (ML) heterojunction photodetectors (PDs). With increasing the doping concentration (nD) to 30 mM, the sheet resistance of the doped-graphene transparent conductive electrode (TCE) sharply decreases to ∼155 ohm sq−1 with only 1% reduction in its transmittance at 550 nm, whilst the work function gradually increases to ∼4.95 eV, indicating p-type doping, useful for the graphene/SQDs:SiO2 MLs interface. The DC conductivity/optical conductivity ratio saturates to ∼75 at nD = 20 mM, much larger than the minimum industry standard (= 35) for the optoelectronic applications of TCEs. The PDs optimized at nD = 20 mM exhibit 0.413 A W−1 responsivity (R), 92 dB linear dynamic range, 1.09 × 1010 cm Hz1/2 W−1 detectivity, and 81.33% external quantum efficiency at a peak wavelength of 630 nm, and the loss of R is almost negligible while the PDs are kept for 700 h in air. These characteristics are comparable to those of commercially-available Si PDs and better than those of previously-reported graphene/Si PDs.
1. Introduction
Photodetectors (PDs) that convert the absorbed optical signals into measurable electrical signals are of central importance in many applications, such as optical communications, biomedical imaging, and motion detection. Graphene, due to its unique two-dimensional structure and remarkable electronic and optical properties, has attracted significant attention for its application in the development of high-performance optoelectronic devices.1–5 In 2010, Li, et al. first reported rectifying behaviors and photovoltaic effects in a planar graphene/Si heterojunction solar cell, in which graphene acts as a carrier collector due to its high conductivity and transparency.6 To date, many researchers have been actively studying graphene/Si heterojunction PDs. Recently, An, et al. developed a Schottky-type PD based on the 1-pyrenecarboxylic-acid-doped tri-layer graphene/Si heterojunction, which exhibits 0.435 A W−1 responsivity (R) and ∼65% photon conversion efficiency in the 850 to 900 nm and 550 to 800 nm wavelength ranges, respectively.7
In a graphene/Si heterojunction PD, Si absorbs photons to generate electron–hole pairs, while graphene acts as a transparent electrode for the Schottky junction. The photoexcited electron–hole pairs are separated by the built-in electric field at the graphene/Si interface, which subsequently generates an electrical current as a function of incident light power. Despite the excellent performance of the graphene/Si heterojunction PDs,7 the interface between graphene and Si normally contains a relatively high density of surface states pinning the surface Fermi level, which leads to a large leakage current noise that limits the overall performance. In addition, the absorption by Si is weak over the entire wavelength range,8 resulting in low photoresponse, especially in the ultra violet (UV)-visible range. Therefore, a lot of efforts have been made to employ large-band-gap compound semiconductors for PDs instead of Si,9,10 but their fabrication processes are very complicated and are not compatible with Si technology.9,10
The performance of graphene/Si heterojunctions strongly depends on the contact properties at the interface of graphene/Si, which can be improved by forming Si quantum dot (SQDs)-embedded SiO2 (SQDs:SiO2) multilayers (MLs) on Si, as previously proved in the PDs showing a high R (∼0.35 A W−1) in the visible range at −3 V.11 However, further enhancement of the performance was not available due to the big reduction of the transmittance caused by the Au nanoparticles on the surface of the AuCl3-doped graphene.11 In addition, the AuCl3-doped graphene deteriorates the stabilities of the PDs because it is highly unstable in the air.12,13 To overcome this problem, it is important to find another dopant by which the doped graphene will be kept more stable after a long time. Recently, low-resistive, high-transparent, and long-term-stable doped-graphene transparent conductive electrodes (TCEs) were successfully fabricated by using p-type dopants such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)-amide (TFSA).13–18 Here, we first report significant enhancement in the performance of the graphene/SQDs:SiO2 ML heterojunction PDs by employing the TFSA dopant for graphene. At room temperature (RT), the TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 ML PDs exhibit an R/specific detectivity (D*) of up to 0.413 A W−1/1.09 × 1010 cm Hz1/2 W−1, respectively at the peak wavelength of 630 nm and a maximum linear dynamic range (LDR) of 92 dB under a low voltage of −2 V, together with greatly improved long-term stability. The performances of the PDs are discussed based on systematic studies on their structural, electrical, and optical properties.
2. Experimental section
Preparation of Si quantum dots
SiOx/SiO2 MLs with 50 periods of 2 nm thin layers were grown on n-type Si wafers at RT using an Ar+ beam with an ion energy of 750 eV and a Si target under an oxygen atmosphere in a reactive ion beam sputtering system.11 The deposition chamber was evacuated to a pressure of 5.0 × 10−9 Torr prior to introducing argon gas into the system. The stoichiometry of the SiOx film was analyzed and controlled by in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy using a Al Kα line at 1486.6 eV. The stoichiometric SiO2 thin film was used as a reference for determining the relative sensitivity factors of the Si 2p and O 1s peaks. After deposition, the samples were annealed at 1100 °C in ultra-pure nitrogen by using a horizontal furnace to form SQD MLs regularly embedded in SiO2.
Doping of graphene
Single layer graphene films were grown on 70 μm-thick Cu foils by chemical-vapor-deposition under the flow of a gas mixture of CH4 (30 sccm) and H2 (10 sccm) at 1000 °C for 30 min, and subsequently transferred onto 100 nm SQDs:SiO2 MLs/Si and quartz substrates based on a conventional transfer method.19 TFSA powder used for p-type doping was dissolved in nitromethane at concentrations (nD) from 5 to 30 mM for preparing the TFSA solution. For doping of graphene, the dopant solution was dropped on the whole surface of graphene sheet and after 2 min (this time is defined as doping time) elapsed, it was spin-coated at 2500 rpm for 1 min. The doped graphene sheets were annealed at 100 °C for 1 min.
Fabrication of graphene/SQD heterojunction PDs
Au and InGa films of 50 nm were deposited on the front and back sides of the graphene/SQD:SiO2 MLs/Si substrates, respectively as the electrodes. The front electrodes were patterned to obtain 5 × 5 mm2 illumination windows by photolithography and standard lift-off processes. The fabricated PDs were heated in a rapid thermal annealing apparatus at 250 °C for 10 min to eliminate residues on the graphene layers.
Characterization
The topographic images of graphene layers were obtained in a non-contact mode of an atomic force microscope (AFM, Park system, model XE-100). Raman spectroscopy with an excitation laser line of 532 nm wavelength and 1 mW power was used to characterize the optical properties of the graphene films. The transmittance, sheet resistance, and work function of the TCEs were measured with a UV-visible-near-infrared optical spectrometer (Agilent Varian, model Cary 5000), 4 probe van der Pauw method (Dasol eng, model FPP-HS8-40K), and Kelvin probe force microscopy (Park systems, model XE 100), respectively.
Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements to characterize the electrical behaviors of the PDs were carried out using a Keithley 2400 source meter controlled by a LabView program. The dark current noise under forward bias was measured with a dynamic signal analyzer (Agilent 35670A) coupled to a low-noise current preamplifier (Stanford Research SR570) in the frequency range of 1 Hz to 10 kHz. The bias was provided by the current preamplifier when needed. The spectral response of the PDs was detected in the 300–1100 nm wavelength range by using a 450 W xenon light source and a 0.25 m grating monochromator (Newport Cornerstone, model 260 1/4 m). The incident light intensity was monitored with a motorized variable wheel attenuator and a Newport calibrated UV-enhanced Si photodiode. 532 nm monochromatic light from a diode laser was used for analyzing the photosensitivity linearity with light power. The light was modulated to have a frequency of 100 Hz with a mechanical chopper (Standard Research Systems) and the photocurrent (PC) response at various bias voltages was recorded with a Signal Recovery 7265 DSP lock-in amplifier. Optical neutral density filters were used to vary the light intensity from 1 nW up to 9.15 mW.
Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at RT using the 325 nm line of a HeCd laser as the excitation source. Emitted light was collected by a lens and analyzed using a grating monochromator and a GaAs photomultiplier (PM) tube. Standard lock-in detection techniques were used to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio. The laser beam diameter was about 0.3 mm and the power was about 3 mW. The excitation for time-resolved PL was done by means of a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (wavelength: 355 nm, pulse energy density: 0.6 mJ cm−2, repetition frequency: 20 Hz, pulse duration: 20 ps). The emitted light was analyzed by using a monochromator equipped with a gated intensified charge-coupled device (CCD) (detection energy: 1.38–9.92 eV, response time: 40 ps, PI-Max, Princeton Instrument,) triggered by an exciting laser pulse.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows a schematic of a typical TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 MLs/n-Si heterojunction PD employing Au and InGa films as the top and bottom electrodes, respectively. A window was opened through the Au/graphene stack to define the effective active area (25 mm2) of the PDs. The total thickness of the SQDs:SiO2 MLs is ∼100 nm, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy proved regularly-distributed ∼2.8 nm-thick SQDs within the SiO2 matrix in our previous report11 (see also Fig. S1, ESI†). The PL spectrum and its decay behavior of the SQDs:SiO2 MLs were also shown to be almost invariant irrespective of the graphene transfer (the peak wavelength and the decay time are ∼760 nm and ∼16 μs, respectively) (Fig. S1, ESI†). These results demonstrate that the SQDs are well formed in the heterostructure and almost no structural variations of SQDs are developed during device fabrication.

Here, the TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 MLs PD was fabricated at nD = 20 mM. 
To check the effect of the TFSA dopant on graphene, the structural, optical, and electrical properties of the doped graphene were analyzed (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). Before doping, the Raman spectrum is peaked at ∼1580 and ∼2700 cm−1, representing the G and 2D bands of pristine graphene. With increasing nD, both G and 2D bands are blue-shifted, indicating the charge transfer from the dopants to graphene, resulting in phonon softening, as reported before.14,15 The intensity ratio of G to the 2D peaks I(G/2D), another parameter to estimate the doping strength, increases with increasing nD (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The I(G/2D) of undoped graphene is 0.48, also a signature of single-layer graphene.20
The sheet resistance (Rs) of pristine graphene ranges from 680 to 760 Ω sq−1. As nD increases to 30 mM, the Rs first decreases sharply and then saturates to 155 ohm sq−1 (78% reduction from its pristine value) (Fig. S2b, ESI†). At the highest nD, the transmittance at 550 nm was reduced by about 1% (Fig. S2c, ESI†), almost negligible compared to other dopants, as reported before.21 The work function, averaged after being taken from 10 different sample positions, monotonically increases to 4.92 ± 0.16 eV with increasing nD to 20 mM (Fig. S2c, ESI†). The TFSA dopant, well known as an electron-releasing molecule containing a high negative ion atom,22,23 tends to accept electron charges from graphene, thereby making the graphene p-type, consistent with previous reports.14–17 The TFSA-doped graphene is therefore suitable as a TCE for SQDs:SiO2/n-Si PDs, as will be detailed below.
To check whether the doped graphene is suitable for a TCE, it is essential to analyze the Rs/transmittance (T) in a composite manner. The ratio of DC conductivity/optical conductivity (σDC/σop) is generally used as a parameter to evaluate the optoelectronic performance of a TCE. It can be calculated from the formula: T = {1 + (Zo/2Rs)(σop/σDC)}−2.24 High values of σDC/σop indicate better TCE due to the high T and low Rs. The σDC/σop values of the TFSA-doped graphene were estimated for various nD (Fig. S2d, ESI†). The σDC/σop value is over ∼35 at all nD, and reaches a maximum (∼90) at nD = 20 mM, much larger than the minimum industry standard (σDC/σop = 35).24 After the TFSA doping, the surface of graphene sheet was characterized by AFM. The root-mean-square roughness was estimated to be ∼0.47 nm and ∼0.98 nm on the graphene without/with TFSA, respectively by means of AFM height profiles (Fig. S3, ESI†). The surface of the graphene doped with TFSA was smoother with no protrusions, compared to the graphene layers doped with other dopants.21

Fig. 1(b) shows a typical J–V curve of the TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 MLs/n-Si heterojunction PD at nD = 20 mM under dark at RT. Fig. 1(c) shows a typical J–V curve of the PD under illumination (1 Sun, 100 mW cm−2). The PD exhibits an evident photovoltaic behavior, resulting from the built-in potential at the TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 ML interface, with the parameters of 0.550 V open-circuit voltage, 0.554 mA cm−2 short-circuit current density, 17.57% fill factor, and 0.053% power-conversion efficiency. These results indicate that the PD is operated like a self-driven device operated at zero bias voltage, thereby allowing low-power consumption. Bias-induced strong enhancement of the photo-response is therefore expected from the PDs, as will be shown below. Fig. 1(d) shows the wavelength (λ)-dependent photo J–V curves. Under illumination, incident photons generate electron–hole pairs in SQDs, resulting in a PC by tunneling through SQDs:SiO2 MLs under forward bias as well as under reverse bias, based on the energy-band diagram of the heterojunction,11,25 as shown in Fig. 2. The PC is expected to be increased by the TFSA doping under forward bias as well as under reverse bias, resulting from the increased available density of states of graphene at the Fermi level (EF) by the downward shift of EF, as shown in Fig. 2, but is invisible in any case under forward bias because the dark current is too high (S4, ESI†). These results suggest that the graphene/SQDs:SiO2 ML heterojunction PDs are much more sensitive under reverse bias. This explains why we analyzed the PD characteristics only under reverse bias (Va), as follows.
 Fig. 2  Schematic band diagrams of (a and c) forward-, and (b and d) reverse-biased SQDs:SiO2 ML heterojunction under dark and illumination. Under low forward bias (V > 0), the barrier oxide field increases linearly with the applied electric field, resulting in a flow of majority carriers (electrons) through the SQDs:SiO2 MLs from n-Si to graphene by direct tunneling, thereby producing a dark current. The dark current is enhanced by doping due to the increased available density of states of graphene at the EF by the downward shift of EF, thereby increasing the number of electrons towards graphene. Under a low reverse bias (V < 0), very few majority carriers are supplied from graphene due to the high energy barrier at the graphene/oxide interface. The PC behaviors are described in the text. Here, EF(GR) and EF(D-GR) represent the Fermi levels of pristine and doped graphene layers, respectively. 

Fig. 1(e) shows R as a function of bias voltage at each λ. The R is maximized at Va = −2 V for all wavelengths, and the peak R value is about 0.413 A W−1 at λ = 630 nm, as shown in Fig. 1(f). On the other hand, under fixed Va and λ, the R shows a maximum at nD = 20 mM (Fig. S5, ESI†). The EF of the TFSA-doped graphene TCE is monotonically lowered with increasing nD (Fig. S2c, ESI†), more useful for the PC response, as explained above, but the transport/collection of the carriers to the graphene TCE can be hindered due to the impurities at higher nD. By the increase of nD, the Rs and T of the TCE are also monotonically reduced, resulting in the maximization of σDC/σop at nD = 20 mM (Fig. S2d, ESI†). Due to these nD-dependent trade-off correlations, the photoresponse including R is maximized at nD = 20 mM.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) is similar to the spectral R, except for a small difference between their peak wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 1(f) (for other biases, see Fig. S6, ESI†), resulting from the strong absorption of the SQDs in the high-energy side.26 The EQE in the visible range (∼550 nm) reaches ∼86%, much larger than those reported for graphene/bulk Si,7,27,28 graphene/porous Si,29 nanographene/Si,30 reduced graphene oxide/Si,31 SQDs/graphene/Si,32 boron (B)-doped SQDs/graphene/SiO2/Si,33 AuCl3-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2,11 metal/SQDs,34 and metal/II-VI-QD PDs35 (see Table S1, ESI†). The spectral R of commercially-available Si PDs is peaked at approximately 900 to 1000 nm,36 but by the use of the SQDs:SiO2 layer, the R and EQE spectra shift to the visible region, as shown in Fig. 1(f), with their absolute values comparable to those of the Si PDs. The thickness of the SQDs:SiO2 MLs is ∼100 nm, resulting in the incomplete transmission of the light through the Si-wafer substrate. Therefore, the R and EQE are dominantly governed by the electrons/holes photo-induced in the SQDs:SiO2 MLs despite the minor contribution from the Si wafer. By the use of undoped graphene, the photo-response of the PD was almost negligible due to high Rs and low work function despite the excellent transmittance (Fig. S7, ESI†).
Based on the above results, further PD characteristics were analyzed for nD = 20 mM. Fig. 3(a) shows PC response switching at various bias voltages by chopping a continuous-wave 532 nm laser line with a spot size of 25 mm2. The switching behaviors are very regular, almost irrespective of the bias voltage. Fig. 3(b) shows the normalized responses as functions of pulse frequency under various reverse biases. A typical photoresponse of 3 dB bandwidth corresponds to the 0.15–0.18 MHz frequency range, indicating a response time of ∼7 μs. This behavior is much faster compared to graphene/bulk-Si PDs with a response time of ∼ms.7,27 From the magnified photoresponse curve, as shown in Fig. 3(c), the rise time (tr) and decay time (td) are extracted to be 0.71–0.89 μs and 5.6–6.3 μs, respectively for various biases (Va).

(c) Normalized transient photocurrents for various bias voltages, excited by a 532 nm laser chopped at a frequency of 20 kHz. (d) Photo J–V curves under different incident light powers at 532 nm. (e) Photoresponse linearity as a function of irradiance under various bias voltages. (f) Spectral D* under various bias voltages. Here, the TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 ML PD was fabricated at nD = 20 mM. 

Fig. 3(d) shows the J–V curves under illumination at 532 nm for the light intensities from 3 × 10−4 to 5.45 mW cm−2. The light-intensity dependences of the PC density at different reverse biases are summarized in Fig. 3(e). In general, the dependence of the PC on light intensity satisfies the relationship Iph ∝ Pα, where Iph is the photocurrent, P is the light intensity, and α is an empirical value related to the recombination processes of the photo-excited carriers. By fitting the curves in Fig. 3(e), α is calculated to be in the range from 0.97 to 1.04 in this work. In particular, the α = 0.99 − 1.00 for the reverse biases of −3 and −2 V, indicating negligible recombination loss resulting from the well-defined graphene/SQDs:SiO2-MLs interface.37 The LDR, obtained by the equation: LDR (in units of dB) = 20log(Iph/Idark),38 where Idark is the dark current, reaches up to 92 dB at −2 V, comparable to that of the inorganic-materials-based PDs.27,37,39
Noise equivalent power (NEP) is another important figure-of-merit indicator for PDs. It represents the minimum collision light power the detector can distinguish from noise. The NEP is expressed as the following equation: NEP = (In2)1/2/R,40 where (In2) the time average of the squared total noise current (Fig. S8a, ESI†), was estimated from the spectral R (Fig. S6, ESI†). The NEP is related to the specific D*, indicating the detection limit of a PD, by the following equation: ,40 where A is the absorbing area and f is the electrical bandwidth in Hz. Fig. 3(f) shows the spectral D* at nD = 20 mM for various Va. The minimum NEP is 45.73 pW Hz−1/2 at Va = −2 V and λ = 630 nm (Fig. S8b, ESI†), resulting in a D* of 1.09 × 1010 cm Hz1/2 W−1. It should be noted that the D* in this work is larger than ever achieved in planar graphene/n-Si heterojunction PDs.7
We also studied the long-term stabilities of the PD performance for about 700 h under an ambient atmosphere at 35–50% humidity. Fig. 4(a) shows the time-dependent dark and photo J–V curves. The estimated R remains almost constant over 700 h, regardless of Va as well as λ, as shown in Fig. 4(b) (Fig. S9, ESI†). In contrast, the R of the AuCl3 film shows about 20% reduction of its initial value after 700 h, as shown in Fig. 4(c) and (d). These results suggest that the TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs heterojunctions are promising as next-generation PDs with high efficiency and stability.

4. Conclusion
SQDs:SiO2 heterojunction PDs were successfully fabricated by employing TFSA-doped TCEs with low sheet resistance, high transparency, and long term stability, and showed high performance in responsivity/external quantum efficiency/detectivity with their values reaching 0.413 A W−1, 81.34%, and 1.09 × 1010 cm Hz1/2 W−1, respectively at a peak λ of 630 nm. The R was consistent for 700 h, regardless of bias voltage and λ. These characteristics are comparable to those of commercially-available Si PDs and better than those of previously-reported graphene/Si PDs. Future challenges towards practical applications of the graphene/SQD heterojunction PDs are to improve the structural quality of large-area graphene and to precisely control the uniformity of the SQDs. In addition, the optimization of the packaging and processing technology is expected to further improve the performance and reliability of the PDs.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) A schematic of a typical TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 ML/n-type Si wafer PD with Au and InGa as the top and bottom electrodes, respectively. (b) Dark J–V curve. (c) Photovoltaic behavior measured under simulated solar illumination. (d) Photo J–V curves for various λ from 400 to 1000 nm. (e) Responsivities as functions of bias for various λ from 400 to 1000 nm. (f) Spectral responsivity and quantum efficiency at a bias of −2 V. Here, the TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 MLs PD was fabricated at nD = 20 mM.	 

 	Fig. 2  Schematic band diagrams of (a and c) forward-, and (b and d) reverse-biased SQDs:SiO2 ML heterojunction under dark and illumination. Under low forward bias (V > 0), the barrier oxide field increases linearly with the applied electric field, resulting in a flow of majority carriers (electrons) through the SQDs:SiO2 MLs from n-Si to graphene by direct tunneling, thereby producing a dark current. The dark current is enhanced by doping due to the increased available density of states of graphene at the EF by the downward shift of EF, thereby increasing the number of electrons towards graphene. Under a low reverse bias (V < 0), very few majority carriers are supplied from graphene due to the high energy barrier at the graphene/oxide interface. The PC behaviors are described in the text. Here, EF(GR) and EF(D-GR) represent the Fermi levels of pristine and doped graphene layers, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Repeated photocurrent switching at various bias voltages measured by chopping a continuous-wave 532 nm laser line. (b) Normalized frequency response at various bias voltages. (c) Normalized transient photocurrents for various bias voltages, excited by a 532 nm laser chopped at a frequency of 20 kHz. (d) Photo J–V curves under different incident light powers at 532 nm. (e) Photoresponse linearity as a function of irradiance under various bias voltages. (f) Spectral D* under various bias voltages. Here, the TFSA-doped graphene/SQDs:SiO2 ML PD was fabricated at nD = 20 mM.
