    , Accepted 21st August 2012First published on 29th August 2012AbstractWe employ a ZnO nanorod/Si3N4-coated Si microgroove-based hierarchical structure (HS) for a light-harvesting scheme in 5 inch single crystalline Si solar cells. ZnO nanorods and Si microgrooves were fabricated by a simple and scalable aqueous process. The excellent light-harvesting characteristics of the HS, such as broadband working ranges and omnidirectionality have been demonstrated using external quantum efficiencies and reflectance measurements. The solar cells with the hierarchical surface exhibit excellent photovoltaic characteristics, i.e., a short-circuit current (JSC) of 38.45 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage of 609 mV and conversion efficiency of 14.04%. As incident angles increase from 0° to 60°, only 5.3% JSC loss is achieved by employing the hierarchical surface, demonstrating the enhanced omnidirectional photovoltaic performances, also confirmed by the theoretical analysis. A viable scheme for broadband and omnidirectional light harvesting using the HS employing microscale/nanoscale surface textures on single crystalline Si solar cells has been demonstrated.
Introduction
A record efficiency of 24.5% on single crystalline Si solar cells is achieved with an inverted pyramid structure, which enhances sunlight absorption by suppressing surface reflection.1 However, the required lithography process prohibits such a structuring technique from practical use due to manufacturing costs. Moreover, the microgrooved surface has been widely used to suppress the optical reflection loss of Si solar cells through the multiple reflections on the textured surfaces.2 Recently, nanostructures acting as the light trapping layer with many superior antireflection (AR) characteristics, such as broadband working range, omnidirectionality, and polarization-insensitivity have been demonstrated.3–6 Unlike multiple reflections in microscale surface texturing based on the geometrical optics, the interaction between the incident light and subwavelength nanostructure surface is dominated by wave optics. As the wavelength of incident light is much higher than the geometric feature of the structure, the decrease in reflectance can be explained by the effective medium theory.7 Light strikes on the subwavelength nanostructures as if it encounters a thin layer with an effective refractive index (ne) between the refractive indices of air and Si, avoiding the abrupt transition from air to device, and thus leading to the enhanced light trapping. On the other hand, if the incident wavelength is much shorter than the structure dimension, the multiple reflection process should become dominant for light trapping.
To render solar energy cost-competitive, third-generation photovoltaics demands an efficiency-boosting mechanism using cost-efficient nanotechnology.8 Solar cells based on a variety of nanostructures not only exhibit extremely low surface reflection but also allow a radial distribution of p–n junctions through a core–shell structure, which benefits the collections of photogenerated carriers.9–16 Tian et al. have reported a single coaxial Si nanorod solar cell with a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 23.9 mA cm−2 and a conversion efficiency (CE) of 3.4%.12 Garnett et al. reported Si nanowire solar cells with a CE of ∼5% and a JSC higher than that of the planar counterpart.10,13 Si nanohole solar cells exhibited a JSC of 32.2 mA cm−2 and a CE of 9.5%.14 The solar cells incorporated with periodically aligned Si nanopillar arrays exhibited a CE of 9.24% with a JSC of 29.5 mA cm−2.15 Unfortunately, most attempts using nanotechnology have yielded unsatisfactory results; even with complicated processes, the resulting solar cells using nanostructuring methods showed low efficiency due to large shunting across the cells, and excessive junction and surface recombination losses.16 Moreover, the conformal deposition of the metal electrodes over high aspect-ratio Si nanostructure surface for efficient photogenerated carrier collection is particularly challenging.
In addition to Si nanostructures, numerous nanostructures obtained with other material systems have been reported as the ideal AR materials for light trapping.17–21 For example, Xi et al. fabricated nanostructured multilayers by an oblique-angle deposition on AlN, and showed that the undesired Fresnel reflection can be virtually eliminated due to the grading of refractive indices from air to AlN.19 However, multilayer deposition is time-consuming, and the high-temperature (typically above 300 °C) process makes the feasibility of this technique unknown to solar cell applications.22 To address these issues, ZnO nanorod arrays (NRAs) synthesized by the hydrothermal method serve as a candidate with promising potential due to the advantage of low-temperature (<100 °C), high growth rate (>2500 nm h−1), simple (lithography-free), and wafer-scale uniformity.23,24 Similar to Si nanowires, ZnO NRAs also exhibit excellent antireflective properties owing to their moth eye-like structures.17,25,26 Moreover, the hydrothermal process allows ZnO NRAs growing on any surface of the substrates regardless of their lattice match or surface chemistry. These merits all render the hydrothermally grown ZnO NRAs readily compatible with the well-developed processes for single crystalline Si solar cells; yet such a study is scarcely reported to date.
Nature provides impressive examples employing multi-scale, hierarchical structures (HSs) with sophisticated, unique functionalities.27,28 In the past, a number of methods have been explored to synthesize man-made hierarchical microstructures/nanostructures with interesting structure/functionality relations.29,30 The nanostructures integrated on a micro-scale surface textures are expected to bring the AR characteristics beyond the aforementioned performances.
In this study, a HS combining ZnO NRA/Si3N4-coated Si microgroove is employed to enhance the light-harvesting in single crystalline Si solar cells on a 5 inch wafer, showing the feasibility of its practical use. With the antireflective microgrooves and the quarter-wavelength (λ/4) Si3N4 layer, which have been optimized on the device for light trapping, the 500 nm-long ZnO NRAs can further reduce the surface reflections over a wide range of wavelengths and incident angles, determined by the spectral, angle-dependent reflection and external quantum efficiencies (EQE) measurements. The solar cell with the hierarchical surface exhibits excellent photovoltaic characteristics, i.e., JSC of 38.45 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 609 mV, and CE of 14.04%. The excellent omnidirectional light trapping performances were demonstrated by the angle-dependent EQE measurements and the simulations based on finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) analysis; as the incident angle of air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5G) solar illumination increases from 0° to 60°, the JSC loss (only 5.3%) of the cells with hierarchical surfaces is suppressed, as compared to 21.6% JSC loss of the cells with only bare microgrooved surfaces. The structure design and the fabrication technique presented here should be applicable to many other types of solar cells and thus provide a way to bring the photovoltaic industry into the next level in the foreseeable future.
Experimental
The 5 inch single crystalline Si solar cells with ZnO NRA/Si3N4-coated Si microgrooved surfaces were fabricated by standard processes with the layer structure, shown in Fig. 1. The cell fabrication includes immersion in a mixture of KOH, water and isopropyl alcohol to attain the randomly distributed microgroove surface textures, followed by the formation of top contacts (Ag) and bottom contacts (Al/Ag) using the screen-print process.31 A 70 nm-thick Si3N4 layer was deposited by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition to serve as the λ/4 AR coating. The growth of ZnO NRAs was carried out using a chemical solution process. Before the NRA growth, the single crystalline Si solar cell was cleaned by acetone, ethanol and DI-water. After cleaning, the ethanol solution containing 5 mM zinc acetate dihydrate was spin-coated on the solar cell. After annealing at 300 °C for 25 min, a 10 nm-thick ZnO layer was formed as the seed layer for the subsequent growth of NRAs. During the growth, the sample was placed downward in the beaker containing the aqueous solution of zinc nitrate hexahydrate (10 mM) and ammonia on a hot plate for 2 h. In order to precisely control the length of ZnO NRAs, slow growth rate (∼250 nm h−1) was adopted by setting the hot plate temperature to be 60 °C, below which the NRAs could barely grow as it has been shown that the over-lengthened NRAs would lead to excessive optical absorption of ZnO.17,32 Finally, the obtained NRAs were cleaned with ethanol and dried in the air.

Results and discussion
The hierarchical surface texturing was observed using a JEOL JSM-6700f field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). Fig. 2(a) and (b) and Fig. 2(d) and (e) show the SEM images of the microgrooved surfaces of Si solar cells with Si3N4 layers before and after the growth of ZnO NRAs, respectively. The 70 nm-thick Si3N4 layer can be seen in the inset of Fig. 2(a). Fig. 2(c) presents the optical image of the full Si solar cells with Si3N4 layers. In Fig. 2(d), it is found that the NRAs are evenly grown on the Si3N4-coated microgrooves and aligned perpendicularly to the surface. X-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicate that the nanorods were aligned along the [0001] direction (see Fig. S1 in ESI†). The inset of Fig. 2(d) illustrates that the ZnO nanorods display tapered structures. The length-dependent antireflection properties of ZnO NRAs have been investigated in our previous study.25,32 Although prolonging the NRAs results in further reduced reflectance, an excessive length of the NRAs can lead to decreased CEs of the solar cells. This is due to the absorption of ZnO, which was demonstrated by reduced transmittance of lengthened nanorods.32 The length of 500 nm employed in this study is the result of optimization work performed on crystalline Si solar cells, where the trade-off between light trapping and optical absorption of ZnO NRAs is considered. In addition, the morphologies of ZnO NRAs can be controlled via synthesis conditions, such as seed layer thickness and reaction time. By tuning the synthesis conditions, the ZnO nanostructures exhibiting rod-like, flower-like and tapered features have been reported in our previous studies.26,33 The correlation between nanostructures' morphologies and their light-harvesting capabilities is linked by the depth profile of the ne of nanostructures, which is mainly determined by the space filling ratios of ZnO. In general, flower-like and tapered morphologies exhibit lower reflectance than that of rod-like ones. The results are attributed to the increased grading in the ne's of flower-like and tapered nanostructures. The applicability to the large-scale fabrication of the hydrothermally grown ZnO NRAs is demonstrated in Fig. 2(f), which presents the optical image of ZnO NRAs grown on the 5 inch Si solar cell wafer. One can see that the NRAs were uniformly distributed on the entire 5 inch wafer surface. The microgrooved surface of the Si solar cell with the Si3N4 layer displays the color of sky blue while it turns into black after the coverage of ZnO NRAs due to the significantly reduced reflectance.

Since the incident sunlight impinges on a solar cell from different directions during the day, a desirable AR coating must reduce the reflection over wide angles of incidence (AOIs). Here, we study the omnidirectionality of the solar cells with three different surface conditions: the one with bare microgrooved surface, the one with microgrooved surface covered by a 70 nm-thick Si3N4 layer, and the one with the ZnO NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved structure. Fig. 3(a)–(c) present the specular reflectance measured with various AOIs and incident wavelengths. On the bare microgrooved surface, Fig. 3(a) shows that the reflectance at most wavelengths is increased for the AOI above 40°, indicating that surface reflection suppression by the microscale textured surfaces is less effective at high AOIs. In Fig. 3(b), the high-AOI reflectance is mitigated on the Si3N4/microgrooved surface; the reflectance is effectively reduced for the AOI up to 50°, but only for wavelengths above 550 nm. On the NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved surface, Fig. 3(c) shows that the AOI limit is further pushed to 65°, below which the reflectance is less than 0.3% for all the wavelengths. It is also noted that a slight oscillation of reflectance occurs on the NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved surface. This is attributed to the interference between the light reflected at the air-NRAs and the NRAs-Si3N4 interfaces.34 The results in Fig. 3(a)–(c) clearly demonstrate that the hierarchical ZnO NRA/Si3N4/Si microgrooved surfaces can suppress the undesired Fresnel reflection for a wide range of AOIs and wavelengths.

It has been reported that light backward scattering can be severe on NRAs due to the increased surface roughness.25,26 As severe backward scattering can sacrifice the optical absorption of the solar cells by increasing the portion of the light scattered back to air, it is necessary to clarify backward scattering on the NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved surface by varying the angles of detection (AODs). Fig. 3(d)–(f) present the specular reflectance measured with various AODs and incident wavelengths. Schematics of the AOI- and AOD-dependent measurements are presented in Fig. S2 in ESI.† In Fig. 3(d), one can see that the bare microgrooved surface gives the strongest backward scattering, which is attributed to the roughness on the microgrooved structure. By adding the λ/4 Si3N4 layer on the microgrooved surface, the backward scattering is decreased over broadband range, as shown in Fig. 3(e). Further grading in refractive index by inserting Si3N4 layers between air and Si not only results in additional destructive interference among the reflected lights, but also reduces the backward scattering intensities on the microgrooved surface by improving the impedance match between air and Si. The superior ability of the ZnO NRA/Si3N4-coated Si microgroove to suppress the undesired backward scattering particularly between 380 and 550 nm is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 3(f), where it shows that surface reflections on the NRA/Si3N4-coated microgrooved surfaces over a wide range of AODs and wavelengths are considerably weaker than those on bare microgrooved and Si3N4-coated microgrooved surfaces. The result can be explained by two effects. Firstly, the subwavelength dimensions of ZnO NRAs behave like an effective homogeneous medium with a continuous gradient of refractive index, and therefore reduce the reflectance at long wavelengths through additional destructive interferences among the reflected light. Secondly, the multiple reflections between the nanorods help trap the reflected light of short wavelengths, and thus lead to the very low reflectance.
In order to study optical transmission across the layer interfaces with different AR coatings, the distribution of electromagnetic fields within the device structures was simulated by FDTD analysis. The simulated structures are described in Fig. S3 in ESI.†Fig. 4(a)–(c) show the transverse electric (TE)-polarized electric field intensity (Ey) distributions for the surfaces. The distributions within the Si region are magnified in Fig. 4(d)–(f). It can be seen that the field intensities transmitted into the device are enhanced upon the applications of the λ/4 Si3N4 layer and the ZnO NRA/Si3N4 structure on the microgrooved surfaces. The light trapping abilities of these structures are also confirmed by the observation that the purely reflected field intensities at Z = 0–1 μm in Fig. 4(b) and (c) are reduced with respect to those in Fig. 4(a). Evidently, the greatest enhancement of light harvesting is achieved by the HS owing to its superior AR performances. To further quantify the optical enhancement in solar cells, the normalized optical absorption as a function of times for the three solar cells is simulated, as shown in Fig. 4(g). The steady-state absorption values for the devices with bare microgrooved, Si3N4/microgrooved, and NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved surfaces are 0.60, 0.89 and 0.99, respectively. The results indicate that light harvesting can be maximized with NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved surfaces which increase the number of the photons reaching the light absorption regions.

(g) Normalized optical absorption as a function of time for the three surface conditions. 

Fig. 5(a)–(c) show the measured angle-dependent EQEs of the three types of surfaces over the 360–1100 nm wavelength range at 0°, 15°, 30°, 45° and 60°. All types of surfaces show decreased EQEs when the AOI is increased. The results can be attributed to the reduced vertical penetration depth of the incident light at high AOIs, which leads to less optical absorption by the active regions of the solar cells. To clearly compare the overall CE as a function of AOI, the values of JSC obtained from integrating the EQE spectra against the AM 1.5G solar spectrum are shown in Fig. 5(d). One can see that as the AOI increases from 0° to 60°, the JSC loss (only 5.3%) of the solar cells with hierarchical surfaces is suppressed, as compared to significant loss of JSC (up to 21.6%) of the solar cells only with microgrooved surfaces. For verifying our measurements, we calculated angle-dependent optical absorptions of the Si substrates with the three types of surfaces. Accordingly, the normalized steady-state absorption efficiencies at the wavelength of 500 nm are obtained by the FDTD method, as shown in Fig. 5(e). Among the three types of surfaces, the bare microgrooved surface exhibits the relatively large EQE reduction from 0° to 60° shown in Fig. 5(a) and summarized in Fig. 5(d), echoing the most reduced calculated absorption efficiencies when AOI increases from 0° to 60° shown in Fig. 5(e). It is worth noting that generally the EQEs of Si3N4/microgrooved surface become red-shifted as AOIs increase, as shown in Fig. 5(b). This is most likely because the specific wavelength for fulfilling the λ/4 condition becomes red-shifted as the optically effective thicknesses increases with AOIs. As the AOI increases, the red-shifted EQE curve of Si3N4/microgrooved surface deviates from the AM 1.5 G solar spectrum, leading to the decrease of JSC. In comparison with the microgrooved surface in Fig. 5(a), the higher values and limited variation of JSC obtained from EQE and simulated absorption with the AOIs indicate that the Si3N4/microgrooved surface exhibits an improved omnidirectional light trapping effect. The increased reflectance of λ/4 layer with increasing AOI obeys Fresnel equations for non-polarized light.35 For the results obtained on the ZnO NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved surface, the excellent omnidirectional light-trapping capability is demonstrated by the highest and most insensitive JSC values over the AOIs. The subwavelength ZnO NRAs with continuous gradient of refractive index harvest photons through additional destructive interferences among the reflected light by the microgrooved surfaces even at the high AOI. The superior omnidirectional property of the HS supports significantly enhanced photovoltaic performances under the illumination of solar spectrum.

(d) Values of JSC obtained from integrating the EQE spectra against the AM 1.5G solar spectrum and (e) angle-dependent normalized optical absorption for the three surface conditions. 
To verify the AR properties of the three types of surfaces, the spectra of total reflection are measured in Fig. 6(a). On the bare microgrooved surface, the reflection stays above 30% for the entire wavelength range. The reflection is minimized in the section between 600 and 700 nm but gradually increases as the wavelength moves towards blue and infrared regions after the coverage of the Si3N4 layer, functioning as a typical λ/4 AR coating. The reflectance reaches a minimum of 4.78% at 640 nm after subtracting the contribution from metallic contacts.36 It is clear that adding ZnO NRAs on the Si3N4-coated microgrooved surfaces further suppresses the reflection for most of the studied wavelengths. The averaged total reflectance from 380 nm to 1000 nm is around 8.09% on ZnO NRA/Si3N4-coated Si microgrooved surfaces. Highly tapered ZnO NRAs and the Si3N4 layer can eliminate the reflection significantly due to the grading of refractive index between the Si and air, i.e., an improved impedance match, and microgrooved textures can make reflected light getting more chances to transmit into Si through multiple reflections.

The EQE of the solar cells at the wavelength range 360–1100 nm were measured by coupling the halogen lamp to a monochromator. Fig. 6(b) presents the EQE spectra measured with the three types of solar cells. As compared with bare microgrooved surfaces, the EQE of solar cells with Si3N4-coated microgrooved surfaces shows improvement at 360–1000 nm, consistent with the reduced reflectance at the same wavelength range. Except at the wavelengths of 580–780 nm where the λ/4 Si3N4/microgrooved surface shows the best AR performance, the EQE obtained on the NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved surfaces is noticeably enhanced at 400–580 nm and 780–1100 nm, which results from the broadband AR performance of ZnO.
NRA/Si3N4-coated Si microgrooved surfaces. The EQE enhancement at 400–580 nm is particularly important as this wavelength range corresponds to the one giving the strongest solar radiation, which agrees well with the simulated result seen in Fig. 4(g). Additionally, we find that the mismatch between the spectra of total reflectance and EQE at the wavelengths below 400 nm, the main reason is the bandgap absorption of ZnO (Eg = 3.3 eV).17 Since the UV light is absorbed by ZnO, very limited photocurrents can be excited despite the extremely low reflectance in the same wavelength region. The low EQEs in the UV region measured with the NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved device should affect the JSC generated by AM 1.5G illumination little, since the UV wavelengths contribute much less irradiance than the visible ones in the solar spectrum.

Fig. 6(c) shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells under the illumination of AM 1.5G obtained with a Keithley 4200 source meter. The measured device characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The increased JSC's of the microgrooved solar cells with Si3N4 or ZnO NRA/Si3N4 layers indicate that these AR layers enhance light absorption of the solar cells, which agrees with total reflection, EQE and simulation results. The 11% enhancement in absorption shown in Fig. 3(g) (i.e. from 0.89 to 0.99) is less than the 18% enhancement in JSC (from 32.48 mA cm−2 to 38.45 mA cm−2). The reason to cause the difference may be the scattering effect on the electrodes. The simulated absorption values are only the optical power integrated over the 3 μm-wide region in which the presence of electrodes is not considered. However, during the measurement of JSC, the edge of the silver electrodes can lead to scattering and make the optical waves reach the solar cell surface at high angles, increasing the photon absorption possibility at the active regions. Since the NRA/Si3N4/microgrooved structure is of a superior omnidirectional property to that of the Si3N4/microgrooved, and the absorption contributed by high AOIs should become more evident when the illumination area is enlarged, it is not surprising that the enhancement in measured JSC is greater than that in the simulated absorption considering the 5 inch-wide area of the real device. It is found that adding AR layers leads to the increased VOC. This can be attributed to the reduced dark saturation current contributions from device surfaces.37,38 The increased JSC and VOC lead to the greatly improved CEs. As expected, the device with the NRA/Si3N4/microgrooves structuring attains the largest CE, which is 57% higher than that obtained on the bare microgrooved surface. With respect to the result on the Si3N4/microgrooves layer, the enhanced CE through NRAs mainly comes from enhanced light trapping in near ultraviolet and near infrared regions, as shown in EQE results (Fig. 6(b)).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we combined microscale/nanoscale surface textures employing ZnO nanorods/Si3N4-coated Si microgrooves to enhance the light harvesting with 5 inch single crystalline Si solar cells. The HS significantly suppresses both specular and diffuse reflections. Optical measurements and simulation verify that the tapered ZnO NRA/Si3N4-coated Si microgrooves act as a gradient index dielectric and effectively reduce the reflectance, and the microgroove morphology gives the escaped light more chances to be absorbed due to the multiple reflections. This HS eliminates backward scattering over a broadband wavelength (400–1100 nm) and enhances the CE by up to 57% compared to the optimized solar cells with bare microgrooved surface. As the AOI increases from 0° to 60°, the JSC loss (only 5.3%) of the solar cells with hierarchical surfaces is suppressed, compared to the significant loss of JSC (up to 21.6%) of the solar cells with only microgrooved surfaces. The giant broadband and omnidirectional enhancement by the hierarchical surface textures on 5 inch wafers demonstrates a feasible, scalable efficiency-boosting scheme for a wide variety of photovoltaic devices.
