    , Accepted 20th August 2019First published on 20th August 2019AbstractArsenene, a single-layer arsenic nanosheet with a honeycomb structure, has recently attracted increasing attention due to its numerous exceptional properties. In this study, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate and compare the interactions of Li, Na and Mg ions with the Arsenene monolayer for the purpose of using it as an anode in lithium, sodium, and magnesium ion rechargeable batteries. The results indicated that the Li, Na and Mg adatoms preferentially adsorbed on the valley sites, with negative adsorption energies of −2.55, −1.91 and −1.10 eV, respectively. This strong binding between the alkali metals and the Arsenene monolayer is an important factor for battery applications. Also, it was found that Arsenene exhibited high theoretical specific capacities of up to 1430 mA h g−1 for Li and Mg and 1073.18 mA h g−1 for Na, which are extremely higher values than those of commercially used graphite anodes (372 mA h g−1) in Li-ion batteries. Furthermore, the diffusion barrier energies of the Li, Na and Mg ions were calculated using the nudged elastic band method. The activation energy barriers of these ions showed isotropic behavior for the different pathways (X, Y, and diagonal directions), where the obtained values were 0.16, 0.05 and 0.016 eV for Li, Na, and Mg ions, respectively. Our findings indicate that the high capacity, low open circuit voltage, and ultrahigh barrier diffusion make Arsenene a good candidate for application as an anode material for rechargeable batteries.
Introduction
Although the use of smartphones, smart electronics, and even smart wearables is expanding ever more progressively, these devices are still limited by power.1 Big technology companies and car companies that are making electric vehicles are conscious of the limitations of lithium-ion batteries.2 Therefore, energy storage technologies are essential to meet the global challenge of clean and sustainable energy by improving the intermittent problems with sustainable energy sources such as solar, biomass and wind.3,4 Rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) offer stability but suffer from lower capacity, high-cost, and slow charge and discharge; they also degrade quickly, which limits their number of life cycles.5,6 The development of electrode materials has greatly accelerated because of their remarkable applications in different areas of energy storage, and several studies have improved the performance of the, electrolytes, cathodes and anodes.7–11 However, various intrinsic obstacles still exist; the conventional rechargeable lithium-ion batteries are composed of graphite negative electrodes and oxide positive electrodes, yielding a bulk system with a limited lattice space. This limitation involves a slow movement of the ions, leading to slow charge–discharge processes, rapid electrode failure, and limited rate performance.1,12 More importantly, the phase transformations, which are caused due to inactive phases and volume expansion may lead to a decrease in the capacity.1,13 Therefore, phase transformations and the mechanical degradation of electrode materials are critical factors that kill the batteries. In order to obtain a high power density, the system must exhibit rapid ion and electron transport and maximize the number of sites for ion intercalation. Designing a new electrode material on a nanometer scale has become one of the most helpful methods for improving the performance of lithium-ion batteries.14 Recently, novel architectures using two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have been widely explored theoretically and experimentally15–17 as these 2D materials provide large diffusion channels that permit the fast motion of lithium and other ions, higher energy and power densities, and a longer cycle life.18–22 For example, graphene has been introduced into Li-ion batteries because of its high charge carrier mobility and mechanical strength, but due to the charge being stored only on the surface, graphene presents moderate capacity.23–26
Many 2D materials, such as graphene, have been reported as potential electrodes for energy storage applications, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs, such as MoS2), transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes, such as Ti2C and Ti3CN), and transition metal oxides (TMOs) including layered structures (for example, V2O5). TMDCs exhibit a high capacity, but owing to a conversion reaction occurring on the first discharge cycle, a new inactive phase appears, leading to a low capacity. TMOs present a high average voltage redox activity, which suggests their preferential use as cathodes. However, the low electronic conductivity of oxides limit their application.27–29 MXene presents a good performance in terms of capacity, electronic conductivity, and mechanical properties, but the difficult synthesis of this type of materials limits their use.30–33 Very recently, attention has turned to two-dimensional monoatomic structures, such as phosphorene, silicene, and stanene. The structure of phosphorene has generated research interest to produce Li batteries based on phosphorus, as it produces a high-performance anode for constructed lithium battery devices. Black phosphorus presents a high theoretical capacity of 2596 mA h g−1, but the cycling efficiency is limited due to volume expansion. Accordingly, the phosphorene monolayer shows an ultrafast diffusion of about 0.08 eV along a zigzag direction about34,35 but its theoretical capacity is limited at 432.79 mA h g−1 due to structural degradation during the lithiation process.35–38 Hence, it seems that the enhanced diffusion does not enhance the electrochemical performance as expected. Silicon-based anodes can be considered as one of the promising approaches due to the high specific capacity of 4200 mA h g−1 (Li22Si5)39–41 for silicon bulk and 954 mA h g−1 for silicene.42,43 However, the insertion of ions into a silicon framework induces a large volume change44,45 thus reducing the capability of the system.46,47 Pnicogens (P, As, Sb, and Bi) have also garnered considerable attention because of high theoretical capacities.48 Arsenic is an alternative Li alloying element with a capacity of 1073 mA h g−1. Motivated by this data, we propose a novel candidate, i.e., an Arsenic 2D monolayer (termed Arsenene), similar to phosphorene, as an atomic thick material that belongs to the fifth main group of elements. In addition, it was possible to construct the Arsenic 2D monolayer experimentally by exfoliating it from gray arsenic (similar to blue phosphorene) owing to the weak interactions between layers in bulk grey arsenic.49,50 Thus, introducing Arsenene as a new 2D material and a promising electrode for ion batteries. The current study presents a computational study, which was used to study the electrochemical reaction of Li, Na and Mg ions on the buckled structure of the Arsenene monolayer using first principles calculations. This study is organized in the following manner: in the next part, i.e., Section 2, we defined the computational method employed for the current study. Section 3 contains the results and discussion, where the advantages and drawbacks of using Arsenene for LIBs, NIBs, and MIBs as electrode materials are discussed. Then, in Section 4, we recap our results.
Computational details
The DFT51-based calculations were implemented in Quantum espresso.52 This code resolves the Kohn–Sham equations53 within a pseudopotential approximation, whereby the electrons are described in the approximation (GGA)54 based on the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation exchange–correlation function.55 However, Li (2s), Na (2p, 3s), Mg (2p, 3s) and As (3d, 4s, 4p) valence electrons were expanded using the projector augmented wave method (PAW),56 with an energy cutoff of 612 eV (45 Ry). In this study, van der Waals interactions have been included using the semi-empirical correction of Grimme (vdW-DF2).57 A supercell containing 4 × 4 primitive cells of arsenic was taken for all calculations, and the structural convergence criteria for energy in the self-consistent field cycle was selected to be 10−10 Ry. A k-point is equal to 12 × 12 × 1 was used for the integration of the Brillouin zone. The isolation of a 2D arsenic sheet was modeled by a single layer with a vacuum of 20 Å between the layers to reduce the inter-layer interaction. Similar to silicene, Arsenene could form different possible honeycomb geometric structures, the most known are planar, puckered and buckled, with gray being the most common and stable, which is a two-dimensional arsenic nanosheet isolated from bulk gray arsenic. (see Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†). In this study, only the buckled structure was considered. To investigate the effect of the adsorption on the magnetization of the studied systems, the spin polarization was considered for all calculations, and the results reveal that the obtained total magnetic moments are null (see Table S3, ESI†) even for high concentrations of adsorbents. Consequently, the computed adsorption energy, potential and barrier energy are not affected.
In order to assess the dynamic stability of the materials, the Quantum Espresso code was used in combination with the phonopy package.58 The finite displacement method based on a modified Parlinski-Li-Kawazoe method59 was used to extract the force constants from forces and displacements. Phonon frequencies (ω) were then calculated by the diagonalization of the dynamic matrix obtained from the force constant. Likewise, the thermal stabilities of the structures were tested using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) performed at finite temperatures.60 Newton's equations of motion were integrated with time steps of 1 fs by means of the Verlet algorithm.
Furthermore, in order to investigate the activation barriers for a variety of possible diffusion hops of Li, Na and Mg adatoms, the nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) method was used, including for van der Waals interactions. The calculations were performed at a constant volume using the optimized lattice parameters of the lowest-energy Li0.125As, Na0.125As and Mg0.125As configurations.
Results and discussion
Electronic properties and lattice dynamic stability of Arsenene
First, we examined the configuration of the pristine Arsenene structure (Fig. 1a). After energy minimization and geometry optimization, the optimized lattice constant was 3.83 Å, which agreed well with previous results.61–63 The interatomic bond between two atoms of arsenic was calculated to be 2.6 Å. The buckling parameter, which is the perpendicular distance between the lower arsenic plane and higher arsenic plane, is 1.43 Å, which is also in agreement with other reports.64–68 We considered graphene, silicene, phosphorene, germanene, and stanene for comparison, whose parameters are illustrated in Table 1. As can be observed, Arsenene is more buckled than the other 2D materials listed in Table 1, except for the puckering of phosphorene.

Unlike graphene, the ground state of the Arsenene monolayer is a semiconductor, and the calculated indirect band gap from the PBE calculation is 1.72 eV. The valence band maximum (VBM) lies at the gamma point, and the conduction band maximum occurs at the M point (Fig. 1c), similar to results reported previously in theoretical studies.69 In addition, the covalent bonding character could be confirmed by the calculated differential charge density distribution plotted in Fig. 1b.
The calculated phonon dispersion relations along the high symmetry lines within the Brillouin zone (BZ) are shown in Fig. 1d together with the phonon density of states. The unit cell of 2D arsenic contains 2 base atoms, and therefore there are six vibrations modes (three acoustic and 3N – 3 optical phonon modes). Each mode is labeled according to its polarization, with the acronyms ‘L’, ‘T’ and ‘Z’ used as abbreviations for the longitudinal, transverse and out-of-plane vibrations, respectively. The acronyms ‘A’ and ‘O’ represent the acoustic and optic modes, respectively. The LA and TA modes show linear dispersion around the Γ point, while the ZA mode exhibits quadratic dispersion and originates from the surface interactions, which is a particular characteristic of 2-dimensional materials.70 The ZO mode has a low frequency compared to the transverse optical frequency (TO) and the longitudinal optical (LO) modes. The explanation for this result is that the ZO mode presents its movement in the out-of-plane direction, while the TO and LO modes follow in-plane movements. As illustrated in Fig. 1d, no soft modes corresponding to possible instabilities are found along any high-symmetry direction of the Brillouin zone. Alternatively, the structure of the Arsenene monolayer with Pm1 (N# 164) symmetry is stable. The calculated phonon frequencies and the values for different high symmetry points are presented in Table 2.

Adsorption of single adatoms on the Arsenene surface
The most stable site for the Li, Na and Mg adatoms on the Arsenene monolayer were identified. Four typical adsorption sites were considered: hollow (H), top (T), valley (V) and bridge (B). The corresponding sites are shown in Fig. S2 ESI.† The adsorption energy Ead is defined by Ead = EMAs − (EAs + EM)(1)where EAs and EMAs are the total energies of Arsenene before and after the metal atom adsorption, respectively, and EM is the per-atom lattice energy of the metal adatoms (M = Li, Na and Mg).
After full relaxation, the adsorption energies of all the adatoms (Li, Na and Mg) were negative in terms of indicating an exothermic formation, as shown in Fig. 2. As we can see from this figure, the strongest binding energy occurs at the valley site, and the second most favorable site is the hexagonal hollow site. It was also demonstrated that the Li adsorption energy at the valley (−2.55 eV) is much larger than the adsorption energies of the Mg atom (−1.10 eV) and Na atom (−1.91 eV). It is worth noting that after the geometrical optimization, the Li adsorbed on the bridge site moved to the valley site. Consequently, the adsorption of Li on the top site is unstable compared to other sites. Also, Arsenene presents the lowest adsorption energy for all of the alkali atoms (Li, Na and Mg) among other 2D materials (see Table 3). A low value of adsorption energy indicates a stronger binding of the adatom to the Arsenene layer, which makes Arsenene energetically favorable and capable of easily accommodating the adatoms (Li, Na and Mg) on its surface.

Arsenene surface loading with Li, Na, and Mg
During the electrochemical processes of ion rechargeable batteries, the ion concentration increases or decreases as a function of the current direction. In our model, the lithiation, sodiation and magnesiation processes were computed by increasing the Li, Na or Mg content on both sides of the Arsenene surface.78 We started by positioning the adatoms on the valley sites (most stable) and then the hollow sites (second most stable), and the average adsorption energy per adatom was calculated using the following equation: (2)where EAs and EMxAs are the total minimized energies of the Arsenene monolayer without and with adatoms, respectively, EM is the total energy of the metal adatoms (M = Li, Na and Mg), and n is the number of adatoms adsorbed.

Fig. 3 shows the fully relaxed structure of the Arsenene monolayer as a function of the adatom content, and the corresponding computed average energies are listed in Table 4. The negative adsorption energies for a range of adsorption sites indicate that the Li, Na and Mg adsorptions over the Arsenene monolayer are spontaneous processes, which is a necessary quality for alkaline batteries. Also, the binding energy associated with the adsorption of Li, Na and Mg is the largest near the valley chains; thus, the adatoms atoms tend to accumulate near these Arsenene valley chains.

At low concentrations of LixAs (x < 50%), the ions are adsorbed on the Arsenene surface through physisorption (interactions at a distance from the surface) with interatomic distances of 2.68 Å, and the lattice parameters increasing slightly with the increasing Li content (see Table S3, ESI†). However, at x = 1, binding to specific sites occurs scattered across the Arsenene monolayer, showing a transition from the buckled structure to a new two-dimensional sheet formed by lithium and arsenic atoms, where the trigonal Rm (n#166) symmetry is transformed Pm1 (n#164) for LiAs. It should be noted that during the lithiation process, the lattice constants “a” and “b” in the Arsenene monolayer system slowly increase, and a maximum value of surface expansion of 9.66% is obtained for Li3As. The maximum capacity reached was 1609.77 mA h g−1 for Li4.5As with a small volume expansion and strong binding energy, thus presenting a suitable electrode material for LIBs. Moreover, for the sodiation and magnesiation processes, all of the Na and Mg atoms remain isolated and maintain their positions above the valley site. These results are illustrated in Fig. 3b and c, revealing that upon increasing the Na or Mg content, no deformation is observed, even after reaching the fully saturated structure. Similarly, the surface area remains almost constant with the increase in the Na or Mg adatom concentration. Therefore, the studied structures of the Arsenene monolayer do not degrade mechanically upon Na and Mg adsorption. From the obtained maximum Na3As and Mg2As compositions, we can evaluate theoretical specific capacities of 1073.18 and 1430.90 mA h g−1 respectively. These results indicate that Arsenene is suitable for NIBs and MIBs. In comparison to other two-dimensional anode materials for (Li, Na, and Mg)-ion batteries, the Arsenene monolayer demonstrates a larger theoretical capacity than MoS2 (146 mA h g−1), Ti3C2 MXenes (352 mA h g−1), Sn (847 mA h g−1) and a higher capacity than that of the commercially used graphite anode (372 mA h g−1) in Li-ion batteries.79 A further important implication is that during the adsorption of Na, the surface of Arsenene remains stable and suitable for hosting adatoms, with a lattice constant change of solely 2%. However, the magnesiation process results in a contraction of the Arsenene surface (for detailed results, see Table S3, ESI†).
The average open circuit voltage
We assume the charge–discharge reactions of the half-cell are as follow: As + xLi+ + xe− ⇌ LixAs(3) As + xLi+ + xe− ⇌ LixAs(4) As + xMg2+ + 2xe− ⇌ MgxAs(5)
The average open circuit intercalation potential is commonly discussed as one of the most important parameters to determine the performance of batteries. Theoretically, it is obtained using the following equation: (6)where ΔG is the difference in the Gibbs free energy for the half-cell reaction, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the number of electrons adsorbed on the surfaces. In general, it is always assumed that the changes in volume and entropy are negligible and small, respectively, during the half-cell reaction, so the average intercalation potential is approximately obtained directly by the internal energy given by: (7)where ΔE is the difference of the obtained total energies. Thus, the average open circuit voltage OCV is calculated by the obtained energies in the concentration range of x1 < x < x2: V = (EMx1As − EMx2As + (x2 − x1)EM)/(x2 − x1)e(8)where EMx1As, EMx2As, and EM are the total energies of Mx1As, Mx2As and M, which are the per-atom lattice energies of the metal adatoms (M = Li, Na and Mg), respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the voltage profiles of the Arsenene monolayer as a function of the specific capacities of the alkali-metal adatoms. Overall, the discharge voltage curves of Li–Arsenene, Na–Arsenene and Mg–Arsenene decrease with the increase the alkali-metal content, and at some concentration of the stored energy, the OCV profile remains flat. Fortunately, this characteristic is favorable for an ion battery-based material. Starting with the LixAs system, which presents the highest average open circuit voltage beyond other adatoms (Na and Mg), at low concentrations, there is a dramatic drop for Li adatoms from 2.55 V when x < 0.125 to 1.03 V for x = 1. This drop may be induced by the formation of new high-ordered LiAs 2D structure. Then, the OCV plateau attributes a slow decreasing process from 0.7 to 0.5 V. A further reduction dropped the OCV to 0.15 for the Li-rich compound (Li4.5As). In the case of NaxAs, a considerable decrease occurred from approximately 1.92 V when x < 0.125 to 0.88 V (x < 0.375), followed by another decrease to 0.61 V for x = 0.75. At a high concentration, the existence of Na chains creates a repulsive interaction between sodium atoms; therefore, the attractive interaction between Na–Arsenene is reduced. As a result, the OCV is reduced to 0.29 V for Na2As and to 0.06 V for the fully sodiated Arsenene, introducing a good candidate for NIB applications. The open-circuit voltage of MgxAs is lower than that of Li and Na. Moreover, no stabilization of the OCV is observed before x = 0.5. Then, the voltage profile becomes a gently sloping curve, where the computed open circuit voltage is around 0.04 V, which is accurate for the practical anodic applications.

Electronic structure
In this section, we discuss the trends in the electronic and magnetic properties from the results of four different concentrations of MxAs with M = Li, Na, and Mg and from a pure Arsenene monolayer structure as a comparison. Fig. 5 shows the spin-polarized total density of state of the Arsenene monolayer and M0.125As with M = Li, Na, and Mg. Based on the magnetic moment (Table S3, ESI†), and the high symmetry of the total density of state (spin up and down from Fig. 5), the Arsenene monolayer has non-magnetic characteristics. Also, no magnetization was observed after the adsorption the alkali-metals Li, Na and Mg, and the structures remain nonmagnetic even at higher concentrations of ad-atoms (as shown in Table S3 and Fig. S3, ESI†).

 Fig. 6  Total and partial density of state of (b) lithiated Arsenene, (c) sodiated Arsenene and (d) magnesiated Arsenene at different concentrations. 
To get more insight, the partial densities of state were plotted in Fig. 6. As illustrated, the increase in the adsorbent contents (Li, Na and Mg) on the Arsenene monolayer introduces a new state at the Fermi level, which makes the semiconductor character disappear in favor of a metallic one at a specific concentration that depends on each adsorbent. Hence, the electron transport in an Arsenene anode is expected to be sufficiently fast.
Thermal stability
The structural stability of Li3As, Na2As and Mg2As was assessed using the Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulation. The final snapshots of the atomistic structures after 5.0 ps of the fully lithiated, sodiated and magnesiated Ab initio Molecular Dynamics (AIMD) simulation at 600 K are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that, at high temperatures, the Li3As binds strongly to the arsenic atoms constructing the LiAs sheet. The Mg2As system presents good stability with a few Arsenic atom bonds broken, due to a minor increase in the interatomic bond length. Also, for Na2As, the system is stable and capable of accommodating Na atoms. Therefore, Arsenene is a good candidate as an anode material for LIBs, NIBs and MIBs.

Diffusion of adatoms on the Arsenene surface
The rate capability of an electrode material depends on the kinetics of the electron transport and intrinsic ion diffusion. Fast ion diffusion is desirable for high charge/discharge rates in practical ion batteries. The examination of electron mobility and ion diffusion in an electrode material is major issue. As mentioned above, the V site is the most stable position for all the adatoms (Li, Na, and Mg) on the Arsenene surface. The diffusion of the adatoms in Arsenene occurs in the form of jumps between neighboring V sites; the calculated diffusion pathways and the corresponding energy profiles are illustrated in Fig. 8. Overall, our results demonstrate that the diffusion of all alkali atoms on Arsenene is isotropic, and the adatoms (Li, Na and Mg) tend to directly reach the other most stable adsorption site (V) with energy barriers of 0.16; 0.05 and 0.016 eV, respectively. Compared with other known 2D materials, the calculated energy barriers for Na and Mg are smaller than those on graphene (0.10 eV),80 boron-doped graphene (0.16–0.22 eV),81 H-passivated silicene (0.12 eV)82 and MoS2 (0.28 eV).83 Moreover, the calculated value is smaller than the energy barrier for Li diffusion in commercially employed graphite (0.22 eV).84

Conclusion
To conclude, the application of the Arsenene monolayer as an anode material for metals (Li, Na, and Mg) was investigated using the first principal calculations. The calculation results demonstrate that Arsenene can store Li, Na, and Mg via adsorption with a high theoretical capacity of 1609.77 mA h g−1 for Li, 1073.18 mA h g−1 for Na and 1430.91 mA h g−1 for Mg, which makes Arsenene a good candidate as an anode material for LIBs and beyond. In addition, the average voltage of the adatom adsorptions on Arsenene are estimated to be lower than 0.55, 0.29, and 0.044 V for Li, Na, and Mg, respectively. Also, based on AIMD calculations, the adatom–Arsenene systems show reasonable stability at high temperatures. Moreover, the diffusion of adatoms on the Arsenene surface was investigated, and due to its buckled structure, the diffusion of the adatoms on Arsenene is highly isotropic along the X, Y, and diagonal directions, with an ultrafast barrier energy (see Table 5). This structural isotropy plays an important role in the migration of the adatoms on its surface. Therefore, it is expected that this study will provide helpful information for the design and fabrication of Arsenene-based anode materials for rechargeable batteries.
