    , Accepted 15th October 2019First published on 17th October 2019AbstractRecently, a series of PffBT4T-based polymers were developed and their photovoltaic performances depended much on the branching positions of the alkyl side chains. Herein, we investigated the backbone conformations and aggregation behaviors of three PffBT4T polymers with different branched alkyl chains by means of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that the modification of the alkyl-chain branching positions not only changes the steric hindrance, but also results in different degrees of backbone twists. The first-position branched alkyl chains bring about both a big steric hindrance and a highly twisted backbone, thus resulting in very weak polymer aggregation in solution. In contrast, the third-position branched alkyl chains bring about a much smaller steric hindrance and a decreased backbone twist, and therefore very strong polymer aggregation appears at both room temperature and an elevated temperature. Notably, the polymer with the second-position branched alkyl chains shows a moderate backbone twist and alkyl-chain steric hindrance, thus exhibiting desirable temperature-dependent aggregation. Our work provides the rationalization of experimental observations and is helpful for the establishment of the structure–property relationship for polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention in the past two decades owing to their potential advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility, and compatibility with large-area production.1,2 Generally, the BHJ active layer comprises two distinct organic semiconductors of electron-donating and electron-accepting π-conjugated molecules or polymers. The photoelectric conversion of BHJ OSCs needs a series of successive electronic processes: (1) light absorption to form excitons; (2) exciton diffusion to donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces; (3) exciton dissociation and charge separation at D/A interfaces to generate hole and electron charge carriers; (4) hole and electron migration along the D and A materials toward the anode and the cathode, respectively; and finally (5) charge collection at the respective electrodes.3,4 Therefore, both the global morphologies (e.g. phase separation domain size and purity) and the local morphologies (e.g. molecular conformations, intermolecular stacking, and D/A interface geometries) of the active layers are crucial for achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).5–7
However, the establishment of a reliable structure–property relationship is not straightforward because of the difficulty in obtaining molecular self-aggregation processes and thin-film morphologies at atomic accuracy by experimental techniques, such as X-ray and photoelectron spectroscopy.8–10 In particular, for amorphous polymer thin films, it is impossible to characterize the conformational (backbone torsion) and stacking (local ordering) attributes. However, the backbone conformations can directly change the electronic structure, optical absorption, and intra-chain charge transfer properties.11–18 Also, the presence of local ordered aggregates can prompt inter-chain charge transport and broaden the absorption spectra due to enhanced electronic interactions.17–23 Therefore, it is of great importance to unveil the conformational and aggregation behaviors of π-conjugated polymers for understanding the relationship between molecular structures and photovoltaic properties.
The active layer morphologies rely on both molecular structures and processing conditions.24–28 To realize solution processing in organic solvents, alkyl side chains are requisites for attachment to the π-conjugated backbones, and side-chain modifications, such as different lengths, branching patterns, anchoring atoms, and substitution positions, can have an important impact on both pure D or A packing structures and D/A interfacial arrangements in the active layers.29–39 The different side chains can also strongly influence the backbone planarity and rigidity of π-conjugated polymers.40–42 Even a subtle change in the branching positions of the alkyl chains can lead to distinct changes in molecular orientations, π–π stacking distances, crystallinity, and domain sizes.22,43–46
In the past few years, Yan et al. developed a series of D–A copolymers based on (difluorinated) quaterthiophene (4T) and (difluorinated) benzothiadiazole (BT),22,32,47,48 and found that only polymers (e.g., PffBT4T-2OD, see Fig. 1a) that exhibit highly temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) behavior (dissolved at a high temperature but strongly aggregated at room temperature in solution) can achieve nearly perfect nanophase separation and high PCEs of 10–12% when blended with fullerene acceptors. In contrast, after changing the branching position of the alkyl chains from the second to the first position, PffBT4T-1ON is difficult to aggregate during the cooling process from a high temperature to room temperature, leading to poor crystallinity for the formed films and a very low PCE of 0.6%. On the other hand, excessive aggregation occurs at both high and room temperatures for PffBT4T-3OT with the third-position branched alkyl chains; the solution is completely a gel and precipitates into solid polymers even at ∼400 K and cannot be processed into devices.22 In this contribution, to elucidate the role of alkyl-chain branching positions, we investigated the conformational and aggregation properties of PffBT4T-1ON (1ON), PffBT4T-2OD (2OD), and PffBT4T-3OT (3OT) by means of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

Methodology
MD simulations
All MD simulations were carried out using the Gromacs-4.6.7 package based on the general AMBER force field (Fig. S1a, ESI†).49,50 To reliably describe the polymer conformations and inter-chain interactions, the force field parameters for the bond lengths, bond angles, and inter-ring torsion angles (Fig. S1b, ESI†) were optimized according to density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level on the PffBT4T oligomers (two repeated units), and the atomic charges were obtained by using the restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) fitting scheme at the DFT-ωB97XD/cc-PVTZ level.51 The simulations were performed with 3D periodic boundary conditions using a leap-frog integrator with a time step of 1.0 fs under the NPT ensemble. A velocity rescaling thermostat52 and a Berendsen barostat53 were used to control the temperature and pressure, respectively. A spherical cut-off of 1.2 nm for the summation of van der Waals interactions and short-range electrostatic interactions and a particle-mesh Ewald solver for long-rang electrostatic interactions were used throughout.
To probe the conformational and aggregation properties of the PffBT4T polymers in solutions, a box containing 30 polymer chains (each comprises 10 repeat units) and 50000 chlorobenzene (CB) molecules was constructed and then equilibrated for 50 ns at a constant temperature (300 K) and pressure (1 bar). Similarly, a polymer/PC71BM solution was obtained by adding extra 328, 357 or 367 PC71BM molecules according to the experimental D:A weight ratio of 1:1.2. To remove the impact of polymer aggregation, we also simulated a single polymer chain in solution. The self-assembly of polymer chains during solvent evaporation was modeled by using a quasi-equilibrium approach (Fig. S2, ESI†),54–56 in which 200 CB molecules were randomly removed every 300 ps from the solution at 300 K and 1 bar. After solvent evaporation, the dried film was further equilibrated for 45 ns. The same scheme was applied to obtain the blending films from the polymer/PC71BM solutions. For each equilibrated solution or film, an additional 5 ns simulation was performed for sampling and 500 snapshots were generated every 10 ps.
Because of excess polymer concentrations (50–60 mg mL−1) in the simulated solutions, some polymers appear to aggregate together. It should be noted that the formation of perfectly ordered polymer aggregates will take a very long time, beyond our simulation timescales. Thus we imitated the disaggregation process of model polymer stacks in solutions. The model ordered stacks were constructed by parallel packing eight polymer chains (each has three repeat units) with an inter-chain distance of 0.4 nm, and then they were placed in a box containing 10000 CB molecules, followed by equilibration under 1 bar at room temperature (300 K) for 50 ns and then at an elevated temperature (400 K) for 50 ns.
First-principles calculations
The excited states of PffBT4T were calculated by time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) at the ωB97XD/6-31G(d,p) level. To well describe the polarization effect, the range-separated parameter (ω) of the long-range corrected functional was optimally tuned in the dielectric environment that was considered via the polarizable continuum model with a dielectric constant of 3.0.57,58 All the DFT and TDDFT calculations were performed by using the Gaussian 16 package.59
Results and discussion
Main-chain conformations
To characterize the main-chain conformations, we extracted the distributions of the dihedral angles α, β, and γ (as labelled in Fig. 1a). The results for the polymer solutions at room temperature are displayed in Fig. 1b. Because the branched alkyl chains are adjacent to β but away from α and γ, the distributions of the three types of polymers are almost the same for α and γ. The distribution of α is concentrated at ca. 10° and 180°, implying nearly coplanar configurations between the BT and adjacent thiophene units. This can be attributed to the attractive S⋯F, N⋯H, S⋯N, and F⋯H nonbonding interactions between the two units. Relatively, the dihedral angle γ is distributed around 35° and 155°, and has a much broader distribution than α due to the lack of nonbonding interactions. Because of being directly influenced by the alkyl chains, the dihedral angle β is more perpendicular than α and γ. The β distributions are similar and concentered around 45° and 135° for 2OD and 3OT, and even around 65° and 115° for 1ON. This can be due to the larger steric hindrance on β for the first branching position with respect to the second- and third branching positions, as confirmed by more alkyl carbon atoms around the linked thiophene unit in 1ON (Fig. 2a).
 Fig. 2  (a) Number of alkyl carbon atoms around the conjugated units (ffBT: rings 2 and 3; T with R: rings 1 and 4; T: rings 5 and 6, see Fig. 1a) for the single polymer chain solutions. The alkyl carbon atoms are counted when the distance to the center of mass of each ring is within 0.4 nm (solid line) or 0.5 nm (dashed line). (b and c) Probability of conjugation lengths (b) and average persistence length versus average radius of gyration (c) for the solutions containing 30 polymer chains. (d) Average radius of gyration for the solutions and films containing 30 polymer chains. 
The distributions of the dihedral angles were also estimated for the neat polymer films, polymer/PC71BM blending solutions and films, and single polymer chain solutions at room temperature, which are displayed in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Interestingly, all the results are similar to those of the polymer solutions, indicating that the PffBT4T backbone conformations are hardly changed by the surrounding solvents and inter-chain interactions. This further confirms that the larger backbone twist in 1ON than in 2OD and 3OT stems from the bigger steric hindrance of the first-position branched alkyl chains.
Previous electronic-structure calculations showed that the backbone planarity has an important impact on the electronic properties of π-conjugated polymers.14,60 When going from a coplanar to a perpendicular conformation, the ionization potential and the bandgap are increased (leading to blue-shifted optical absorption) whereas the intra-chain electronic couplings are decreased. Notably, when the torsion angle is greater than 40°, the electronic coupling between adjacent thiophene moieties will drop quickly. Thus we use 40° as the threshold to evaluate the ‘effective’ conjugation length, as proposed by Lipomi et al.61 The probability distributions of the conjugation lengths for the three PffBT4T polymers are shown in Fig. 2b and Fig. S4 (ESI†). Because of almost no distribution when α > 40° or < 140°, the probability for the conjugation length larger than 3 moieties is mainly limited by β, especially for 1ON. Indeed, compared with 2OD and 3OT, 1ON has a much lower probability when the conjugation length is larger than 3 moieties. This result implies that the intra-chain charge transfer in 1ON is relatively slow among the three PffBT4T polymers.
Backbone rigidity of a polymer chain also has an important impact on intra-chain charge transport,16 which can be described by radius of gyration and persistence length. Increasing the persistence length is favourable for obtaining a larger charge diffusion coefficient and a higher mobility.16 Here, the persistence length is calculated as the module of the sum of the vectors defined by the two connecting atoms of each π-conjugated moiety (Fig. S5, ESI†). As expected, there is a positive correlation between the persistence length and the radius of gyration, despite different polymer systems and environments (Fig. 2c and Fig. S6, ESI†). Generally, the average persistence lengths follow the trend: 1ON < 2OD < 3OT. In addition, from solutions to films, the radius of gyration and persistence length are substantially reduced (Fig. 2d and Fig. S6, ESI†). Interestingly, the addition of PC71BM molecules increases the persistence lengths of 1ON and 2OD, especially for 1ON.
Strong and broad absorption spectra are desirable to achieve high short-circuit current densities and PCEs for OSCs. Despite the same kind of backbone, very different absorption spectra were found for the three PffBT4T polymers by experiments. At room temperature, the absorption spectra of 2OD and 3OT in solutions show two absorption peaks at ca. 690 and 630 nm. The first absorption peak is induced by inter-chain aggregation. In contrast, 1ON shows no aggregation-induced absorption peak and the first absorption peak is located at ca. 535 nm. Thus the large red shift (ca. 100 nm) from the first absorption peak of 1ON to the second absorption peak of 2OD or 3OT can be primarily due to the smaller backbone twists. This is confirmed by the TDDFT-calculated absorption spectra with representative β values (Fig. 3a, 1ON: 65°/135°, 2OD and 3OT: 45°/135°). Because the HOMO is delocalized over the whole backbone while the LUMO is located mainly on the BT unit (Fig. 3b), the HOMO energy is more dependent on the polymer conformations than the LUMO energy. In addition, the more twisted the backbone, the lower the HOMO energy. Considering that the first singlet excitation arises from the HOMO → LUMO transition, the blue-shift in the absorption from 2OD and 3OT to 1ON results from the drop of the HOMO energy. Moreover, the twist induced changes in the HOMO energy of the polymers can influence the polymer/fullerene interfacial charge-transfer state energy and the device open-circuit voltage.62

Inter-chain packing
The inter-chain radial distribution functions (RDFs) of the polymer backbones were calculated to analyze the polymer aggregation behaviors. We recall that the RDF describes the variance of the number density of particles (ρ) as a function of distance (r) from a reference particle. Here, each ring in the polymer backbone (Fig. 1a) is regarded as a particle. In solution, the first RDF peak is located at ca. 0.4 nm for all the three PffBT4T polymers, corresponding to inter-chain π–π stacking (Fig. 4a). However, the peak intensity shows a quite large difference, in the order of 1ON ≪ 2OD < 3OT. This implies that 1ON has very weak aggregation ability and hence poor charge transport in the bulk. As expected, the trend is unchanged upon mixing with PC71BM, but the inter-chain aggregation is much decreased for all the polymers (Fig. 4b), which will reduce charge transport in the polymer/PC71BM mixtures. The aggregation trend among the polymers is further confirmed by the number of local π–π stacks (Fig. 4c). These results are consistent with the experiment that 1ON is hard to separate from fullerene acceptors. In contrast, strong and long π–π stacking can be found for the other two polymers (Fig. 4d); this can not only facilitate inter-chain charge transport but also result in an aggregate absorption band in the range of longer wavelengths in the 2OD and 3OT solutions at room temperature.22 From solution to film, the volume of the system is reduced, leading to an increase of ρ and a decrease of the RDF peak intensity. However, the number of local π–π stacks is greatly increased due to the closer packing after solvent evaporation. Importantly, the trends of the peak intensity and the number of local π–π stacks remain unchanged (Fig. S7, ESI†).

(d) Representative inter-chain packing structures extracted from MD simulations (for clarity, the alkyl groups after the branching position are replaced by methyl and all hydrogen atoms are omitted). 
Among the three PffBT4T polymers, only 2OD was found to show strong TDA in experiments.22 This phenomenon is further demonstrated by our simulations of the disaggregation process of perfectly ordered polymer stacks in solutions at room temperature and an elevated temperature (400 K). As shown in Fig. 5, after 50 ns simulation at 300 K, the 1ON stack is dispersed into several fragments; the 2OD stack becomes disordered but all the polymer chains still remain together; in contrast, the 3OT stack remains ordered and very stable. Interestingly, after 50 ns simulation at 400 K, the 1ON and 2OD stacks are completely separated into isolated polymer chains, while the 3OT stack is just slightly disturbed and starts to disaggregate.
 Fig. 5  Initial model parallel π–π stacked polymer chains and extracted snapshots of polymer chains in solutions after simulation at 300 K for 50 ns and then at 400 K for 50 ns. For clarity, the alkyl groups after the branching positions are replaced by methyl and all the hydrogen atoms and solvent molecules are omitted. 
To summarize, the first-position branched alkyl chains in 1ON provide excessive steric hindrance, which not only results in a highly twisted main-chain conformation but also impedes inter-chain π–π stacking. This is why the 1ON polymer chains cannot aggregate at both room and elevated temperatures. In contrast, 3OT is strongly aggregated and undissolved at both room and elevated temperatures because of the weak steric hindrance of the third-position branched alkyl chains, and hence cannot be used for device fabrication. Interestingly, because of the moderate steric hindrance of the second-position branched alkyl chains, 2OD can disaggregate and be well dissolved at a high temperature (allowing for easy processing), but form strong aggregates at a low temperature (leading to high crystallinity). This verifies that the second branching position is the key to achieve the desirable TDA properties for PffBT4T polymers.63
Conclusions
We have investigated the impact of alkyl-chain branching positions on the conformational and packing attributes of three PffBT4T polymers (1ON, 2OD, and 3OT) by means of atomistic MD simulations. The results show that the branching positions of the alkyl chains can significantly affect the backbone torsion of the polymers. Particularly, the torsion degree of 1ON is obviously greater than those of 2OD and 3OT. Moreover, because of the large steric hindrance of the first-position branched alkyl chains, 1ON is hard to form π–π stacking between the conjugated moieties. As the branching position moves away from the backbone, the number of local π–π stacking is steadily increased from 1ON to 2OD and 3ON. Consequently, as shown by the simulations on the disaggregate process, only 2OD has temperature-dependent aggregation properties; in contrast, 1ON tends to disaggregate and fully separate while 3OT retains ordered packing at both room temperature and 400 K. Our work rationalizes the experimental observation of different aggregation properties of PffBT4T polymers and provides atomistic insight into the role of alkyl-chain branching positions.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Chemical structures of 1ON, 2OD, and 3OT and illustration of the dihedral angles between adjacent conjugated moieties (α, β, and γ). (b) Distributions of α, β, and γ extracted from the simulated polymer solutions at room temperature and representative conformations of two adjacent thiophene units related to the β dihedral angle (all hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity).	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Number of alkyl carbon atoms around the conjugated units (ffBT: rings 2 and 3; T with R: rings 1 and 4; T: rings 5 and 6, see Fig. 1a) for the single polymer chain solutions. The alkyl carbon atoms are counted when the distance to the center of mass of each ring is within 0.4 nm (solid line) or 0.5 nm (dashed line). (b and c) Probability of conjugation lengths (b) and average persistence length versus average radius of gyration (c) for the solutions containing 30 polymer chains. (d) Average radius of gyration for the solutions and films containing 30 polymer chains.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Calculated absorption spectra for PffBT4T with different values of β (45°, 65°, 115° and 135°) and the same values of α (180°) and γ (150°). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels are given in the inset. (b) Pictorial representation of the HOMO and the LUMO and the weight of the HOMO → LUMO transition in the first singlet excited state.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a and b) Radial distribution functions (RDFs) of inter-chain conjugated rings, and (c) number of π–π stacks (inter-chain ring pairs with a center-of-mass distance < 0.5 nm) in polymer solution and polymer/PC71BM solution. (d) Representative inter-chain packing structures extracted from MD simulations (for clarity, the alkyl groups after the branching position are replaced by methyl and all hydrogen atoms are omitted).	 

 	Fig. 5  Initial model parallel π–π stacked polymer chains and extracted snapshots of polymer chains in solutions after simulation at 300 K for 50 ns and then at 400 K for 50 ns. For clarity, the alkyl groups after the branching positions are replaced by methyl and all the hydrogen atoms and solvent molecules are omitted.
