    , Accepted 26th March 2013First published on 2nd April 2013AbstractNovel and highly effective composite electrolytes were prepared by combining the two dimensional graphene (Gra) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) for the solid electrolyte of dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Gra sheets were uniformly coated by the polymer layer through the ester carboxylate bonding between oxygenated species on Gra sheets and PEO. The Gra–PEO composite electrolyte showed the large scale generation of iodide ions in a redox couple. From rheological analysis, the decrease in viscosity after the addition of LiI and I2 in the Gra–PEO electrolyte might be explained by the dipolar interactions being severely disrupted by the ionic interactions of Li+, I−, and I3− ions. A composite electrolyte with 0.5 wt% Gra presented a higher ionic conductivity (3.32 mS cm−1) than those of PEO and other composite electrolytes at room temperature. A high overall conversion efficiency (∼5.23%) with a very high short circuit current (JSC) of 18.32 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.592 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.48 was achieved in DSSCs fabricated with the 0.5 wt% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte. This enhanced photovoltaic performance might be attributed to the large scale formation of iodide ions in the redox electrolyte and the relatively high ionic conductivity.
Introduction
Nanocrystalline TiO2 semiconducting electrode-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been studied as an alternative new generation solar cell.1–7 So far, DSSCs based on Ru-complex dye sensitized TiO2-electrodes with average particle sizes of 15–20 nm have shown the highest conversion efficiency of 11.4% reported for DSSCs.8 Due to undesirable intrinsic properties of liquid redox electrolytes, the liquid electrolyte-based DSSCs are still facing problems in device long-term durability and operational stability.9 The use of liquid electrolytes intrinsically includes potential leakage of toxic organic solvents and evaporation of volatile iodine ions in organic solvents as a major drawback, which results in higher overall internal resistance due to the lower concentration of charge carriers.10 Several approaches have been developed to overcome liquid electrolyte leakage using various kinds of solid electrolytes such as room temperature ionic liquids,11 organic or inorganic hole-transport materials12,13 and polymer electrolytes.14–17 Among them, polymer-composite electrolyte fabricated DSSCs have received much attention as promising alternative electrolytes for DSSCs due to the relatively high ionic conductivity and stability. However, the conversion efficiency of polymer electrolyte based DSSCs was found to be lower than those of DSSCs with liquid electrolytes because of the lower ionic mobility of the I−/I3− species in the polymeric medium and incomplete wetting of the mesoporous TiO2 thin film.
Recently, polymer–inorganic nanofiller composite electrolytes have shown greatly improved thermal, mechanical, and ionic conductivity properties in comparison to solid state polymer electrolytes, owing to their stronger interaction between polymer and nanofiller phases.18,19 Carbonaceous nanomaterials are known as promising nanofillers for improving the stability and conductivity of polymer electrolytes due to their flexibility in structural, electrochemical, and mechanical properties.20–22 Recently, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been successfully utilized as nanofillers in several polyglycol and polyether based electrolytes improving the interaction and cross-linking with polymer molecules, which may significantly enhance the morphological and electrical properties of composite electrolytes.23,24 Graphene, a new kind of carbon nanomaterial featuring a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, has recently received a great deal of interest owing to its remarkable electronic properties of a 0 eV band gap, i.e., the filled valence band touches the conduction band,25 exploring various applications in optoelectronic, electronic, and photovoltaic devices.26,27 Similar to filler behavior of CNTs in polymer composites, unique graphene nanomaterials could be anticipated as the effective nanofillers to the polymer composite electrolytes. In this paper, highly effective and advanced graphene (Gra)–polyethylene oxide (PEO) composite electrolytes were prepared and applied as solid-state electrolytes for the fabrication of DSSCs. Moreover, the electrochemical properties, ionic interaction and cross-linking of the Gra–PEO composite electrolyte were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, XPS and rheological analysis. The enhanced photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with the Gra–PEO composite electrolyte might be attributed to the large scale formation of an iodide couple in the redox electrolyte and the relatively high ionic conductivity. This is the first report on the application of the graphene–PEO composite electrolyte in DSSCs and study on the correlation between rheological behavior and electrochemical properties of the composite electrolyte.
Experimental
Preparation of graphene sheets
The Gra sheets were synthesized by adopting the well-known Hummer's method.28 In brief, graphite flakes (2.0 g, Sigma-Aldrich) and NaNO3 (1.0 g, 99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in concentrated H2SO4 (50 mL, 95–98%, Sigma-Aldrich) and placed in an ice bath. After that, KMnO4 (5.0 g, 99.0%, Junsei Chemicals) was added slowly in small portions. The mixture was heated to 40 °C under stirring and subsequently deionized water (150 mL) was added, which generated a high exothermicity to 98 °C. The reaction temperature was maintained at 98 °C for 15 min by external heating, then the reaction was cooled using a water bath for 10 min. Additional deionized water (420 mL) and 30% H2O2 (3 mL, 30.0%, Samchun Chemicals) were added, which produced another exothermic process. After air cooling, the mixture was purified by the following steps: filtration, multiple washings with deionized water, centrifugations and decantation and vacuum drying to produce 1.2 g of solid graphene.
Preparation of Gra–PEO composite electrolytes
The Gra–PEO composite materials were prepared by adding 0.5 wt% and 1 wt% of prepared graphene powder to 10% PEO acetonitrile solution. The Gra–PEO gel was made after stirring the Gra–PEO slurry for 2 h. For the Gra–PEO electrolyte, 0.1 M of LiI and 0.015 M of I2 were added to the Gra–PEO gel and then the mixture was sonicated to distribute graphene in the PEO matrix for 30 min and finally kept stirring for 24 h. The Gra–PEO composite electrolyte films were obtained by casting onto fluorinated tin oxide glass (FTO, Hartford Glass Co., 8 Ω □−1, 80% transmittance in the visible spectrum) for further characterization. The prepared composite electrolytes were denoted as 0.5% Gra–PEO to indicate the amount of Gra wt% in PEO.
Characterization
The morphology of the composite electrolyte thin films was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi 4700, Japan). Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the composite electrolytes were measured using a Perkin-Elmer TA 2010. The ionic conductivities of the Gra–PEO composite electrolyte films were measured using a digital conductometer (CM-21P, TOA-DKK) at room temperature. Raman spectroscopy was conducted using a scanning confocal Raman microscope (Nanofinder 30, Tokyo Instruments Inc.). The bonding and crosslinking properties of Gra–PEO composite materials were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS-NOVA, Kratos Inc.).
Measurement of rheological properties
The rheology experiments were performed using a Malvern Kinexus Pro stress controlled shear rheometer (Model no.: KNX2100), equipped with a Peltier oven and a solvent trap. For the measurements, a 50 mm/1° and 20 mm/1° cone and plate geometry were used. The oven was saturated with the solvent acetonitrile to avoid evaporation. The measurements consisted of viscosity functions (η()) being performed from small to large shear rates at a constant temperature of 25 °C after equilibrating the Gra–PEO composite sample to this temperature for 5 min. Due to the low viscosities, the scatter was reduced by averaging several datasets obtained under identical conditions. Each experiment was repeated on at least 3 samples. It was found that for shear rates  ≈ 3000 s−1, the flow becomes unstable due to centrifugal forces, which leads to an ejection of the sample.
Fabrication of DSSCs
The fabrication of DSSCs was reported elsewhere.23 In brief, the nanocrystalline TiO2 thin film electrodes were prepared with the TiO2-slurry, in which the TiO2-slurry was prepared by the incremental addition of 2 mL of aqueous polyethylene glycol (Fluka, average Mw of 20000 g mol−1) solution to 0.5 g of TiO2 powder (P25, Degussa) in a mortar under vigorous grinding with a pestle. The uniform TiO2-slurry was coated on fluorinated tin oxide glass (FTO glass, Hartford Glass Co., 8 Ω □−1, 80% transmittance in the visible spectrum) by using a doctor blade technique. After drying at room temperature, the thin film was calcined in air at 450 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 thin film electrodes were immersed in the ethanolic dye solution of 0.3 mM ruthenium(II) 535 bis-TBA (N-719, Solaronix) dye for 24 h at room temperature. Afterward, the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode was rinsed with ethanol and dried under a nitrogen stream. A Pt counter electrode (60 nm thickness) was placed over the dye-adsorbed TiO2 working electrode and the edges of the cell were sealed with Surlyn (60 μm). A Pt counter electrode (60 nm thickness of Pt layer) was placed over the dye-adsorbed TiO2 working electrode by pressing the two electrodes together at 80 °C. Finally, the Gra–PEO composite electrolyte was introduced through holes in the Pt counter electrode using a syringe, and then the DSSC fabrication was finalized without sealing, as the composite electrolyte solidifies at room temperature within several minutes.
The photocurrent density composite electrolyte was introduced through holes in the Pt counter electrode using a syringe, and then the DSSC fabrication was finalized wkithout sealing, served as a simulated sun light source, and its light intensity (or radiant power) was adjusted to simulated AM 1.5 radiation at 100 mW cm−2 with a Si photodetector fitted with a KG-5 filter (Schott) as a reference calibrated at NREL (USA). The J–V measurement system was maintained in the range of 20–30 °C using a small cooling fan. With this setup, the spectral mismatch parameter for dye cells is within 3% of unity,29 allowing for measurements of actual solar efficiencies without the need for correction.
Results and discussion
Morphological and structural properties

Fig. 1 shows the FESEM images of Gra and Gra–PEO composites. The typical layered morphology of Gra with several hundred nanometers is shown in Fig. 1(a). The introduction of PEO in Gra increases the thicknesses of layered Gra-sheets by homogeneous mixing and well covering of Gra-sheets. The 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte shows the uniformity as compared to the higher wt% of the Gra (1 wt%) composite. Moreover, the quality of Gra–PEO composites is comparatively good in nature as reported elsewhere.30,31

Fig. 2 shows the AFM images of Gra and Gra–PEO composite electrolytes. Bare Gra displays the layered, regular and clear sheet morphology in Fig. 2(a). The Gra-sheets become thicker by the addition of PEO. The composite electrolyte with 0.5 wt% Gra depicts the uniform covering of PEO on the Gra-sheets (Fig. 2(b)), whereas a less uniform surface of Gra is observed in the 1% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte (Fig. 2(c)). The topographical images are consistent with FESEM results. Furthermore, the roughness properties of Gra and Gra–PEO composite electrolytes have been examined by analyzing the root mean surface roughness (Rrms) of the AFM images, as summarized in Table 1. The bare Gra shows a relatively low Rrms value of 6.0 nm. After introduction of PEO, the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte shows a considerably higher Rrms value of 14.6 nm, whereas the 1% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte presents a lower Rrms value of 6.2 nm. It is reported that the higher Rrms value of the thin film represents the higher amorphicity in the composite materials.18,32 The higher Rrms of the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte indicates the increase of amorphicity in comparison with bare Gra and other composition of composites.

The XPS-spectra of carbon (C 1s) of PEO and Gra–PEO composite electrolytes are shown in Fig. 3. The two resolved C 1s peaks at 284.6 eV and 286.6 eV are observed by bare PEO (Fig. 3(a)), which are associated with the vibration of CH2 (polymer backbone) and C–O–C (ether oxygen connected to two carbons) of PEO molecules, respectively.33,34 The four resolved C 1s peaks are obtained in 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolytes as shown in Fig. 3(b). The resolved binding energies at 284.9 eV and 286.3 eV in 0.5% Gra–PEO composites are assigned to CH2- and CO-groups, respectively. It is reported that the binding energy near 284–285 eV represents the sp2 carbon network by the C–C bond of graphene.35 The binding energy at 284.9 eV in the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite material is ascribed to the C–C bond of Gra intermingled with the C–C bond of PEO. Other two binding energies at 287.1 eV and 288.2 eV confirm the existence of CO and −O–CO bonds in 0.5% Gra–PEO composites.36,37 These XPS results indicate the formation of the ester carboxylate bonding between oxygenated species on graphene sheets and PEO.

Fig. 4(a) shows the I 3d XPS spectra of bare PEO and Gra–PEO composite electrolytes. The bare PEO electrolyte exhibits two prominent peaks at 618.5 eV and 630.2 eV along with a small peak at 620.3 eV, corresponding to neat I2/LiI and formation of triiodide (I3−) ions, respectively.38 After the addition of Gra, the composite electrolytes show negative shifts in binding energies from 618.5 to 618.2 eV (I−) and 630.2 to 629.6 eV (I3−) as compared to the bare PEO electrolyte. This kind of lower binding energy shift might have arisen from the complex formation of Li+ ions and oxygenated surface species of the polymer in the composite, which results in bond weakening between Li+ ions and I− ions from the polymer matrix in the composite electrolyte.39 Moreover, the interaction between the surface functional group of carbon nanomaterials and polymers represents the enhancement of ionic transport properties in the polymer–inorganic composite electrolyte surface.39 As compared to other composition of electrolytes, the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte exhibits the highest peak intensities, suggesting the large amount of I3− ion formation in redox electrolytes. Fig. 4(b) shows the Raman spectra of the bare PEO and Gra–PEO composite electrolytes, which are obtained in the Raman shift region of 0–250 cm−1 with an excitation laser wavelength of 632.8 nm. A strong Raman peak at 111.1 cm−1 is obtained by bare PEO and Gra–PEO composite electrolytes, corresponding to the symmetric stretch of I3− ions in redox electrolytes.40,41 The Gra–PEO composite electrolyte exhibits a new small Raman peak at 148.4 cm−1, which can be assigned to the vibration mode of higher polyiodide species, such as I5−.42 The 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte possesses higher peak intensities as compared to bare PEO and 1% Gra–PEO composite electrolytes, indicating the large amount of I3− ion formation in redox electrolytes. This result is consistent with the results of FESEM and AFM, and it was found that the optimized mixing ratio of Gra and PEO is 0.5 wt% Gra in PEO to achieve the advanced morphological and electrochemical properties in Gra–PEO composite materials. It is speculated that a high content of Gra deteriorates the properties of the Gra–PEO composite. It was reported that the formation of I3− depends on the concentration of I2 in the redox couple, in other words, the high amount of I2 forms high amount of I3− and polyiodides.23 Moreover, carbon nanomaterials generally show a high availability of I2 adsorption.43 Generally, the large scale generation of I3− ions is responsible for the momentous supply of a large amount of ions/charges during the charge transport process within the device, which might increase the ionic conductivity of the electrolyte.44 The Raman and I 3d XPS results reveal that the Gra (0.5%)–PEO composite electrolyte might produce a high amount of I3− and polyiodide species, resulting in high ionic conductivity of the composite electrolyte. Furthermore, a proportional relationship is found between the ionic conductivity and concentration of I3− and polyiodide species of the composite electrolyte.

The data of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) of the composites such as Tm (melting temperature) and ΔHm (heat of melting, area integration of the Tm peak) are summarized in Table 1. In general, the degree of crystallinity of polymers and composites is calculated by the following equation:23 Xc = (ΔHm/ΔHomW) × 100(1)where Xc is the degree of crystallinity and W is the molecular weight. Bare PEO shows the relatively high Tm of 74.3 °C and ΔHm of 119.5 J g−1. After addition of Gra, the Tm and ΔHm values are decreased in Gra–PEO composite electrolytes. The 0/5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte presents the lowest Tm (64.8 °C) and ΔHm (74.2 J g−1) as compared to bare PEO and 1% Gra–PEO composite electrolytes. The lowest values of Tm and ΔHm in the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte indicate the significant decrease of crystallinity after adding 0.5 wt% Gra in PEO. It is well known that the addition of nano-fillers in the polymer improves the transport properties, recrystallization, and enhancement of ionic conductivity due to the enlargement of the amorphous phase in the polymer network.45 Moreover, the enlargement of the amorphous phase or low degree of crystallinity of polymer composites is favorable for ion conduction of the polymer electrolyte, which might be due to the decreased interaction between the composite and I−/I3− couple in the redox electrolyte.45 The ionic conductivities of Gra–PEO composite electrolyte films were analyzed using a digital conductometer at room temperature, as summarized in Table 1. As compared to bare PEO (1.2 mS cm−1) and 1% Gra–PEO composite (2.62 mS cm−1) electrolytes, the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte exhibits the highest ionic conductivity of 3.22 mS cm−1, which is attributed to drastically decreased amorphicity, as shown in AFM and DSC results.
Rheological behavior
To explain the ionic conductivity, the rheological properties of bare PEO and Gra–PEO composites have been measured at room temperature as shown in Fig. 5. In general, the rheological properties strongly depend on the presence of surface groups in composites. Bare PEO and Gra–PEO composites show light shear thinning – typical of entangled polymer solutions, while the 0.5% Gra–PEO/LiI/I2 electrolyte is much more Newtonian (viscosity independent of shear rate) as depicted in Fig. 5(a). As expected for a lower viscosity, it is noticed that the viscosity of the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite decreases by adding I3−/I− (LiI/I2) ions. Fig. 5(b) shows that the viscosities of the electrolyte solutions increase when adding Gra to PEO, which is expected considering the transient network formed by Gra. When adding solids (1 wt% Gra) to PEO solution, the magnitude of the effect is increased by a factor of 2, which is rather large effect.

The more unusual finding is that the addition of LiI and I2 in the form of iodide ions leads to a reduction of viscosity by a factor of ≈10, which can be partially compensated for by adding tertiary butyl pyridine (TBP) as an additive to the electrolyte solution. These changes in the rheological behavior are far from expected and demand an in-depth analysis of the molecular processes involved.
PEO and Gra are similar to each other in so far as they both are partially oxidized hydrocarbons. It is known that aqueous PEO-solutions interact with each other not only by entanglements but also by supra-molecular interactions.46,47 However, as PEO and Gra-sheets tend to strongly interact with each other, it is cogent to assume that both species interact in a transient supra-molecular network based on dipolar interactions. The finding that the addition of LiI and I2 leads to a strong decrease of viscosity can rationally be explained by the dipolar interactions being severely disrupted by the ionic interactions of Li+, I−, and I3− ions, as illustrated in Fig. 6. The loss of shear thinning and the reduction of viscosity by a factor of approximately 10 to 30 times the viscosity of the solutions are a clear footprint of this breakup. The addition of TBP leads to an increase of the viscosity by a factor of ≈2.2, which is the logical consequence of the reduction of the effective concentration of ions due to complexation. From rheological characterization, it is clear that the drastic decrease in the viscosity after addition of LiI and I2 is the consequence of interactions between these ions on one hand and Gra and PEO on the other hand, which disrupts the transient supramolecular network of Gra and PEO. The logical consequences are improved ionic interactions of I−, and I3− ions on the surface of the composite. These improvements significantly influence the ionic conductivity properties of Gra–PEO composite electrolytes.

Photovoltaic performance

Fig. 7 shows the current density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of DSSCs fabricated with bare PEO and Gra–PEO composite electrolytes and performances of devices are summarized in Table 1. A low conversion efficiency of 1.9% with a low short circuit current density (JSC) of 5.7 mA cm−2 is obtained from the DSSC fabricated with the bare PEO-electrolyte. The performance and photocurrent density of devices are drastically increased by the addition of Gra in the PEO electrolyte in comparison with the bare PEO electrolyte. The DSSC fabricated with the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte shows the highest conversion efficiency of 5.2% with a high JSC of 18.32 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.592 V. Whereas, the DSSC fabricated with the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte without TBP achieves a low conversion efficiency of 3.7%, VOC of 0.541 V and fill factor (FF) of 0.38 with almost the same JSC of 18.1 mA cm−2. This indicates the role of TBP-addition for the improvement of VOC and FF, as explained in the rheology results. As compared to bare PEO electrolytes, DSSCs with Gra–PEO composite electrolytes drastically increase JSC and conversion efficiencies. The enhanced JSC could be explained by the charge transport mechanism in the I−/I3− couple in the redox electrolyte, which is based on the physical diffusion in the electrolyte.48 In general, the diffusion coefficient and the limited current density (Jlim) of the device are described by the following relationship: Jlim = 2neoDI3−cI3−NA/l, where n denotes the number of electrons transferred in the reaction (here n = 2), eo the elementary charge, DI3− the diffusion coefficient of I3−, cI3− the concentration of I3− ions, NA the Avogadro constant, and l the distance between electrodes. From this equation, it is clear that the photocurrent density depends on the concentration of I3− ions, i.e., a high concentration of I3− ions delivers the high ionic conductivity and photocurrent density as well. In this case, the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte exhibits the enhanced morphological properties, high concentration of I3− ions, and ionic conductivity, as described in AFM, DSC and Raman results, which considerably enhances the photocurrent density and conversion efficiency. Moreover, the low FF in DSSCs with the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte is attributed to the sufficiently reduced ohmic contact to increase the electron exchange in the PEO-network of the electrolyte region FF. For comparison, the zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticle-based photoanode is used to fabricate the solid state DSSCs with the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte, which shows a relatively low conversion efficiency of 1.6% with a JSC of 5.15 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.632 V and similar FF of 0.48 (as presented in Table 1). The DSSC performance of the Gra–PEO composite is comparable to the DSSC fabricated with the ZnO photoanode and the liquid electrolyte.49–52

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were carried out to elucidate the photocurrent characteristics of fabricated DSSCs as shown in Fig. 8. A low IPCE of ∼25% in the broad absorption range of 400–650 nm is recorded for the DSSC fabricated with the bare PEO electrolyte.23 The IPCE is significantly enhanced by the addition of Gra into the PEO electrolyte. The highest IPCE of 49.4% is obtained by the DSSC fabricated with the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte, whereas the DSSC with the 1% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte exhibits a low IPCE of 31.2%. The highest IPCE is attributed to the highest ionic conductivity of the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte (as shown in Table 1) and enhanced interfacial contact between electrode and electrolyte layers.53 Thus, the improved morphological generation of a high amount of I3− ions in the redox electrolyte and ionic conductivity in the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte significantly results in high JSC and cell performance.

Conclusions
Novel and highly effective composite electrolytes were prepared with the combination of the two dimensional Gra and PEO, which were applied as solid electrolytes for DSSCs. Gra sheets were uniformly coated by PEO. The oxygenated species on graphene sheets interact with PEO and form strong bonding between them. The optimized 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte exhibited a significantly improved ionic conductivity of 3.32 mS cm−1 and a JSC of 18.32 mA cm−2, resulting from the improved generation of the iodide redox couple and enhanced ionic interactions of Li+, I−, and I3− ions. From rheological characterization, it is clear that the drastic decrease in the viscosity after addition of LiI and I2 is the consequence of interactions between these ions on one hand and Gra and PEO on the other hand, which disrupts the transient supra-molecular network of Gra and PEO. High overall conversion efficiency (5.2%) with a very high JSC of 18.32 mA cm−2 was achieved in the DSSC fabricated with the 0.5% Gra–PEO composite electrolyte. The enhanced photovoltaic performance is attributed to the large scale formation of the iodide couple in the redox electrolyte and relatively high ionic conductivity.
