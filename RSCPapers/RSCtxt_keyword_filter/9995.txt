, Accepted 15th May 2023First published on 16th May 2023AbstractThree-dimensional printing (3DP) is an emerging technology to fabricate complex architectures, necessary to realize state-of-the-art flexible and wearable electronic devices. In this regard, top-performing devices containing organic ferro- and piezoelectric compounds are desired to circumvent significant shortcomings of conventional piezoceramics, e.g. toxicity and high-temperature device processibility. Herein, we report on a 3D-printed composite of a chiral ferroelectric organic salt {[Me3CCH(Me)NH3][BF4]} (1) with a biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer that serves as a highly efficient piezoelectric nanogenerator (PENG). The ferroelectric property of 1 originates from its polar tetragonal space group P42, verified by P–E loop measurements. The ferroelectric domain characteristics of 1 were further probed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), which gave characteristic ‘butterfly’ and hysteresis loops. The PFM amplitude vs. drive voltage measurements gave a relatively high magnitude of the converse piezoelectric coefficient for 1. PCL polymer composites with various weight percentages (wt%) of 1 were prepared and subjected to piezoelectric energy harvesting tests, which gave a maximum open-circuit voltage of 36.2 V and a power density of 48.1 μW cm−2 for the 10 wt% 1-PCL champion device. Furthermore, a gyroid-shaped 3D-printed 10 wt% 1-PCL composite was fabricated to test its practical utility, which gave an excellent output voltage of 41 V and a power density of 56.8 μW cm−2. These studies promise the potential of simple organic compounds for building PENG devices using advanced manufacturing technologies.

New concepts
In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of simple and efficient two-component ferroelectric material 1 of formula {[Me3CCH(Me)NH3][BF4]} consisting of a chiral 3,3-dimethyl-2-butylammonium (DMBA) cation and a multi-atomic tetrafluoroborate anion. The simplicity of its preparation and structure has enabled the first-time fabrication of a high-performance small-molecule-based scaled-up nanogenerator device by ‘additive manufacturing’ popularly termed ‘the three-dimensional printing’ technique. The noncentrosymmetric structure of 1 was probed by DSC, SHG, dielectric and ferroelectric measurements. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) of the single crystals of 1 showed the existence of clear-cut electrical domains and well-resolved amplitude butterfly and phase hysteresis loops confirming the ferro- and piezoelectric nature of 1. Furthermore, the energy harvesting utility of 1 as a piezoelectric nanogenerator was performed on the composite thin films of 1 with biodegradable polycaprolactone polymer and on its 3D-printed composite slabs. The output voltages and power densities of the best-performing 10 wt% composite film were found to be retained on the scaled-up 3D-printed composite device yielding a maximum power density of 56.8 μW cm−2, the highest among the nanogenerators of all-organic composites. The energy storage activity of the device shows the rapid charging of a 100 μF capacitor within 200 seconds. This work, therefore, demonstrates the use of chirality as a tool for preparing high-performance polar ferroelectric materials and 3D printing as a platform for the fabrication of complex piezoelectric nanogenerator device architectures for future wearable electronics.

Introduction
Composite materials simultaneously exhibiting ferroelectric, dielectric, and piezoelectric properties may be one of the most renowned multifunctional materials due to their applications in memory devices, sensors, transducers, wearable electronics, medical devices, robots, and energy storage materials.1–4 Ferroelectric materials with embedded piezoelectric characteristics facilitate the interconversion between electric voltage and mechanical stimuli and are employed as mechanical energy harvesters, popularly known as piezoelectric nanogenerators (PENGs).1,5–9 PENGs are perceived to possess numerous applications in modern high-tech electronics and devices that function in the harvesting, storage, and dissipation of electrical energy.10 In recent years, many PENGs derived from conventional ferro- and piezoelectric ceramics such as lead zirconate titanate, lithium niobate, zinc oxide, and barium titanate and polymers such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) have been explored, and commercially applied.11–17 The PENGs based on these materials are typically commissioned in their neat form or as composites with flexible materials such as polymers.
Additive manufacturing, also known as three-dimensional printing (3DP), is an emerging technology to print physical objects layer-by-layer and provides efficiency to the scaled-up processes for device miniaturizations.18–21 This technique has gained prominence due to its simple, customizable preparation and is finding its way into the pharmaceutical, electronic and robotic industries.19 Three important techniques, namely, fused deposition modelling (FDM),22,23 stereolithography (SLA),24 and selective laser sintering (SLS)25 are well explored for 3DP applications. Amongst these, FDM is the most common in 3DP technology due to its easy operation, environmental benignity, high efficiency, and low cost.26–28 The use of the 3DP technique for PENG applications is highly desired as it offers efficient force-to-electricity conversion compared to traditional 2D thin-film-based devices. Moreover, the 3D printing prompts the uniform distribution of the compressive stress during PENG measurements and facilitates the directional arrangement of dipole moments leading to improved output performance. 3D-printed architectures of ceramic and oxide materials are somewhat known in the recent literature. However, using these materials brings certain disadvantages for applications in miniature and wearable electronics because of the challenges associated with their device formulations. The most pressing challenge is the poor mechanical stiffness, even at low strain values, apart from toxic metal contents.29 Recently, Zhang and co-workers have demonstrated the enhancement of the piezoelectric output voltage of a 3D printed PVDF device compared to that of a device composed of neat PVDF film.30 This may be attributed to the reduction in the material's modulus prompted by the porous nature of the cast material. However, PVDF-based devices require external additives or high-voltage poling to exhibit the desired effects.10,31
Thus, it is advantageous to investigate small-molecule-derived ferro- and piezoelectrics and their composites as 3D-printable PENG devices. Because these materials are soluble in common solvents and are compatible with several polymer matrices, they can be printed into customized shapes using the FDM technique. Organic materials and their polymer composites are highly advantageous in terms of their flexibility, toughness and mechanical properties. The scientific community has previously reported efficient energy harvesting outputs derived from all-organic-based composite devices. For instance, composites like DPDP·PF6/PDMS, DPDP·BF4/TPU, [Bn(4-BrBn)NMe2]·BF4, Boc-FF_PCL, 3NA@PCL, etc.32–36 have shown sizable PENG outputs but were only tested in the form of their 2D thin-films. However, studies on such materials using the additive manufacturing technique could offer attractive solutions for obtaining complex scalable architectures for energy applications. Also, it is desirable to prepare organic ferroelectrics with high output characteristics to achieve 3D-printed PENG devices.
Herein, we report a simple organoammonium salt {[Me3CCH(Me)NH3][BF4]} (1), containing 3,3-dimethyl-2-butylammonium (DMBA) cations with a chiral carbon center and tetrafluoroborate anion. Compound 1 crystallizes in the tetragonal P42 space group at both 120 and 298 K suitable for ferroelectric properties. The ferroelectric behavior of 1 was confirmed by polarization (P) versus electric field (E) hysteresis loop measurement, which gave a saturation polarization (Ps) of 1.82 μC cm−2 at 298 K. The PFM analysis showed excellent ferroelectric domain structures and characteristic amplitude and phase responses at a single point of the crystalline thin film. Furthermore, various composite devices (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%) of 1 were prepared in combination with the biodegradable polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer and employed as PENGs. The optimal 10 wt% 1-PCL gave a maximum open-circuit peak-to-peak voltage (VOC–PP) of 36.2 V with the corresponding power density of 48.1 μW cm−2. Subsequently, gyroid (Gy) shaped 3D-printed ensembles were prepared for the 10 wt% 1-PCL composite with an enhanced output voltage of 41 V and power density of 56.8 μW cm−2. These results present the potential of 3D-printed all-organic PENG devices for efficient energy harvesting applications and open up new avenues for them in future wearable electronics.
Results and discussion
Chiral ammonium salt 1 was prepared by adding tetrafluoro boric acid into a methanol solution of (S)-3,3-dimethyl-2-butylamine (Scheme S1,ESI†). Rod-shaped colorless crystals of 1 were obtained from the reaction mixture after seven days. The single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) analysis revealed that at 120 K, 1 crystallizes in the tetragonal P42 space group. The asymmetric unit of 1 contained two DMBA cations and two BF4− anions (Fig. 1a). The packing diagram of 1 shows the presence of a H-bonded tetrameric assembly consisting of four DMBA cations and four BF4− anions. In the tetramer structure, each DMBA cation is H-bonded to two BF4− anions and in return, the BF4− anion is bonded to two ammonium cations (Fig. 1b). These tetramers are seen to stack one below the other via the N–H⋯F interactions and form a helical 1D network (Fig. 1b and Fig. S4, ESI†).

(c) Molecular structure of 1 at 298 K. (d) Projection of the dnorm-mapped Hirshfeld surface of 1 at 298 K. 
The single crystal X-ray diffraction (SCXRD) data of 1 at 298 K were solved in the same tetragonal P42 space group (Fig. 1b). Although, the obtained structure shows similar structural features as that of its 120 K data, the fluorine atoms in both the BF4− anions are disordered with each of them being located in two independent sites. Nevertheless, the H-bonded tetrameric assembly is retained in 1 at 298 K as well (Fig. S5, ESI†). A detailed Hirshfeld surface analysis of 1 was carried out for its structure at 120 and 298 K. Among several interactions present in the molecule the H⋯F/F⋯H interactions were found to contribute significantly to the inter-molecular interactions contributing 45.8% of the total interactions at 298 K (Fig. 1d and Fig. S6–S11, ESI†).
The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of 1 shows the high stability of the compound until 550 K (Fig. S12, ESI†). A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiment was performed in the temperature range of 200–450 K to map any structural phase transitions in 1. From the DSC profiles, two phase transitions at 239/230 K (low-temperature phase (LTP) to intermediate-temperature phase (ITP)) and 326/320 K (intermediate-temperature phase (ITP) to high-temperature phase (HTP)) were noticed in the heating/cooling runs (Fig. 2a). The enthalpy changes were found to be 3.90/4.45 J g−1 and 14.30/7.34 J g−1, respectively, at 239/230 K and 326/320 K in the heating/cooling runs. The corresponding entropy changes were estimated to be 0.0163/0.0193 J g−1 K−1 and 0.0438/0.0229 J g−1 K−1. The first phase transition at 239/230 K corresponds to the ferroelectric–ferroelectric phase transition (vide infra) as observed from the SCXRD data of 1 at 298 K (in the same space group of P42). Notably, the disorder of the BF4− anions and some perturbations of the cations could have caused the heat anomaly in the DSC profile. The HTP structure of 1 could not be obtained as the crystals of 1 turned opaque above 320 K. Hence, to track the HTP of 1, temperature-dependent powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements were carried out. The room temperature PXRD profile of 1 shows a good correlation with that of the simulated patterns from the 298 K SCXRD data. Changes in the PXRD profiles were noticed from 328 K onwards and the stabilization of the new phase was noticed at 338 K (Fig. S13, ESI†). Indexing the 338 K PXRD profile yields the unit cell parameters for the HTP of 1 in the chiral tetragonal space group P42212 (Table S5, ESI†). This suggests a polar to non-polar structural transformation of 1 in the HTP.

The inset shows the integral SHG intensity of 1 plotted as a function of temperature. (c) The temperature-dependence of ε′ and tanδ data for 1. (d) The P–E hysteresis loop measurements and leakage current densities of 1. 
Furthermore, the PXRD analysis of 1 after a period of five months showed no degradation in the peak profiles, confirming its long-term stability (Fig. S14a, ESI†). Since ammonium salts are known to suffer from moisture instability, the stability of 1 was checked by performing PXRD measurements after exposing the powder sample of 1 to different relative humidity conditions (RH = 25% to RH = 99%) at 298 K. As observed from the PXRD analyses, compound 1 retains its crystallinity up to RH = 75% (Fig. S14b, ESI†). However, signs of the loss in crystallinity were evident upon exposing 1 to 99% RH conditions.
The non-centrosymmetric nature of 1 is further supported by the second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements at room temperature, using the measurement of a Kurtz–Perry type.37 The powder sample of 1 upon irradiation with 800 nm, 1 kHz laser pulses with a width of ca. 75 fs produces the SHG (400 nm) signal with the relative efficiency of 0.01 with respect to the standard potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) sample of the same particle size (Fig. 2b). The temperature-resolved SHG experiment (dT/dt = 5 K min−1) in the range from 140 to 400 K shows that the room temperature ITP crystal phase features approximately 9-fold higher relative SHG intensity than the neighboring LT (low temperature) and HT (high temperature) phases (Fig. 2b inset and Fig. S15, ESI†).
To further understand the structural transformations of 1, the dielectric permittivity measurements were recorded on its powder-pressed pellet in a frequency range of 1 kHz to 1 MHz (Fig. S16, ESI†). The temperature-dependent real-part of the dielectric permittivity (ε′) at a frequency of 100 kHz showed two heat anomalies for 1: a broad transition peaking around 250 K and a step-like transition onset above 350 K. These two anomalies are consistent with the phase changes observed from the DSC and X-ray diffraction data (Fig. 2c and Fig. S17, ESI†). A maximum ε′ value of 14.8 was recorded at 277 K at 100 kHz frequency associated with the LTP-ITP transition. Moreover, the temperature-dependence of dielectric loss factor (tanδ) profiles of 1 matches with the ε′ vs. T plot, consistent with the observed phase changes in the system. The permittivity values of 1 are well supported by the reasonably high dipole moment values obtained from the ONIOM calculations on their crystal structures (Table S6, ESI†).
Compound 1 exhibits a point group symmetry of C4, which is one of the ten polar point groups that allow for ferroelectricity. The polarization (P) vs. electric field (E) measurements on a powder-pressed pellet of 1 gave a rectangular P–E hysteresis loop. A polarization value of 1.82 μC cm−2 was obtained at the maximum electric field of 0.25 kV cm−1 at 298 K and 0.01 Hz (Fig. 2d). The obtained current density vs. electric field (J–E) curve shows very low leakage current densities and exhibits two opposite peaks at the coercive field (Ec) of 0.15 kV cm−1, which is typical for ferroelectric materials (Fig. 2d). The existence of ferroelectricity in the LTP of 1 was again confirmed by performing the P–E loop measurements at 218 K (Fig. S18, ESI†).
Furthermore, the microscopic polarization state of the crystals of 1 was examined by the vector-mode piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) technique. Fig. 3a–d show the observed ferroelectric amplitude and phase domain structures overlaid on the corresponding topography (Fig. 3e). The PFM data show stripes of alternating upward and downward ferroelectric polarization patterns. Significant displacements in opposite directions as observed from the amplitude images indicate a pronounced piezoresponse in 1. From the amplitude images, it is evident that the out-of-plane (V-PFM) piezoresponse is more pronounced than the in-plane (L-PFM) response; however, they are in good correspondence to each other. From the phase responses, large domains with opposite polarity can be visualized. From the phase responses noted from the out-of-plane and in-plane images, the existence of multi-axial polarization can be observed.38 Similar responses have been observed in the vertical (V-PFM) and lateral (L-PFM) measurements on a drop-cast film of 1 as well (Fig. S20, ESI†). Additionally, the PFM spectroscopy measurements were performed at a single point on the thin film of 1 by applying a constant bias voltage of ±60 V at the tip. This resulted in a phase-bias rectangular hysteresis loop and butterfly-shaped amplitude-bias loop characterizing the ferro- and piezoelectric nature of the material (Fig. 3f).39

(h) The amplitude vs. drive voltage measurements on the surfaces of 1 and DIPAB. 
We also obtained a PFM resonance curve at 2 V on the crystal surface of 1, which shows an excellent piezoelectric response compared to the standard DIPAB sample (Fig. 3g). Furthermore, pointwise amplitude vs. drive voltage measurements were performed on the ferroelectric domains across both 1 and the standard sample of DIPAB (Fig. 3h). A linear rise in the amplitude data firmly confirms the intrinsic piezoelectric nature of these samples. The slopes of these fitted straight lines yield the comparative measure of the piezoelectric coefficient of 1 to that of DIPAB. From Fig. 3h it is evident that the magnitude of the relative piezoelectric coefficient of 1 is more than twice that of DIPAB.40,41
The direct piezoelectric response (d33) of 1 was obtained using the “BerlinCourt” method on its compacted pellet. The bulk d33 coefficient of 1 was measured to be 3.7 pC N−1 at an operating frequency of 110 Hz and with applied mechanical stress of 0.25 N. The corresponding piezoelectric voltage (g33 = d33/ε33) and the transduction (d33 × g33) coefficients were calculated to be 10.60 × 10−3 V m N−1 and 39.24 × 10−15 m3 J−1, respectively, suggesting the feasibility of 1 for efficient mechanical to electrical energy conversion.
The utility of 1 for PENG applications was further probed on its polymer composite films that endow the crystallites of 1 with high mechanical flexibility. Various weight percent (5, 10, 15 and 20 wt%) composite films of 1 were prepared with polycaprolactone (PCL) polymer by adding appropriate quantities of 1 into a DMF solution of PCL (Fig. S22, ESI†). The folding, bending, stretching, and rolling operations performed on the 1-PCL films demonstrate the excellent flexibility of these composite materials (Fig. 4a). Concomitantly, a film of neat PCL was also prepared for comparative studies.

(e) The reversibility of the output signals obtained upon providing forward and reverse connection to the oscilloscope. (f) The calculated output current (IPP) profiles of 1-PCL composite devices. 
The field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) analysis shows a uniform distribution of the crystalline ferroelectric particles in the 5 and 10 wt% 1-PCL composite films, while the aggregation of the particles was observed for the 15 and 20 wt% composite films (Fig. 4b and Fig. S23–S26, ESI†). The X-ray 3D-microtomography images were recorded for all the composite films, which gave a clearer visualization of the embedded particles in the composites (Fig. 4c and Fig. S27–S29, ESI†).
Both the FE-SEM and 3D-microtomography images suggest the presence of voids in the particle distribution in all the composites.42 The PXRD profiles of all 1-PCL composites reveal the crystalline nature of the embedded particles and the phase purity of 1 in the heterostructure (Fig. S30, ESI†). Furthermore, the intact nature of the crystallites of 1 inside the PCL matrix has been verified by Raman spectral analysis (Fig. S31, ESI†). For neat PCL, the Raman active modes were observed for C–C (1037, 1064, and 1109 cm−1), CH2 (1418 and 1441 cm−1) and CO (1723 cm−1) groups.43 Compound 1 showed Raman active vibrational modes corresponding to the C–H (2816, 2912, and 2976 cm−1), C–C (900 cm−1), C–N (767 cm−1), N–H (2875 cm−1) and B–F (538 and 700 cm−1) functionalities. Notably, the characteristic peaks due to both 1 and PCL were seen to be present in all the 1-PCL composite films validating the retention of crystallinity of the compound inside the polymer matrix.
To check the mechanical strength and modulus of all of the 1-PCL composites, their stress–strain behavior was determined using a universal testing machine. All the composite films were stretchable up to 50% strain (Fig. S32, ESI†). Noticeably, the stress values for the 5 and 10 wt% composites at 50% strain were found to be uncompromised (12.52 and 9.29 MPa) relative to neat PCL (12.11 MPa) suggesting the efficient structural and interfacial interactions between the polymer and the ferroelectric particles. Reduced stress values of 6.15 and 5.14 MPa for the 15 and 20 wt% composites at 50% strain can be attributed to the agglomeration of 1 in the PCL matrix, as suggested by the FE-SEM and X-ray 3D-microtomography analyses.
For the PENG measurements, the composites were suitably electroded and protected with Kapton tapes. All the measurements involving 1-PCL composite devices were performed at an optimized external load of ≈21 N and an operating frequency of 10 Hz (Fig. S34, ESI†). The measured peak-to-peak open-circuit voltages (VOC–PP) for 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% 1-PCL composite devices are 7.9, 36.2, 15.3, and 10.6 V, respectively (Fig. 4d and Fig. S35, ESI†). The device made up of a neat PCL device gave a VOC–PP of only 0.34 V, confirming that the voltages obtained from the composites originate from the piezoelectric nature of 1. As seen in Fig. 4d, the VOC–PP increases until 10 wt% of 1 in the PCL composites and abruptly decreases for the 15 and 20 wt% 1-PCL composites. This decrease in voltage output can be related to the agglomeration of the crystallites of 1 in the polymer matrix at higher concentrations as evident from FE-SEM images (15 and 20 wt% composites). Also, the measured frequency-dependent dielectric permittivities on all the composite films show an initial increasing trend in the ε′ values and exhibit the maximum values for the 10 wt% 1-PCL material (Fig. S36, ESI†). A reduction in ε′ value for the higher wt% (15 and 20 wt%) composites clearly indicates the reduction in the effective dipoles in the system. The agglomeration of the particles is known to produce weak insulation of the composites (Maxwell–Wagner–Sillars polarization) and lower the dielectric constants due to electrical breakdown.
Furthermore, the polarity-switching test, by reversing the connections to the electrodes, was performed on the best-performing 10 wt% 1-PCL device (VOC–PP = 36.2 V). The observation of the signal of equal magnitude and opposite directions for the press and release operations confirms the true piezoelectric nature of the composite device (Fig. 4e and Fig. S37, ESI†). Subsequently, the peak-to-peak currents (IPP) were calculated by attaching a 4.7 MΩ resistor and measuring the voltages across the circuit. The obtained IPP values were observed to be 1.3, 6.9, 2.2, and 1.8 μA for the 5, 10, 15, and 20 wt% 1-PCL, respectively (Fig. 4f and Fig. S38 and S39, ESI†).
Spurred by the high VOC–PP value of the 10 wt% 1-PCL device, we explored the fabrication of a 3D-printed large-scale device for this composition. To minimize the compound and polymer required for large-area devices, hollow 3D-printed patterns were probed for this application. Thus, we first prepared four different 3D-printed slabs of neat PCL polymer (1.5 × 4 cm2) in the grid, zigzag, triangular and gyroid geometries, which showed the % porosities of 51.3, 56.7, 56.9 and 59.8%, respectively (Fig. S40, ESI†). Finally, the gyroid-shaped pattern was chosen for obtaining the 3D-printed PENG devices due to its higher porosity and increased exposure area. Before the FDM printing, 10 wt% 1-PCL composite filaments were prepared from the as-made composite film using a melt extruder (Fig. 5a). Subsequently, the composite filament was fed to the 3D printer and patterned as gyroid-shaped slabs (Fig. 5b).

(b) Image of a computerized gyroid design and the photograph of a 3D printed Gy-1-PCL slab.

(g) Measured open-circuit VOC–PP and (h) voltage (V) and power density (PD) values of the Gy-1-PCL composite device under different load resistances. The inset shows a magnified view of the PD profile in the low resistance region showing the maximum value at 760 kΩ. 
The microstructure analysis of the 10 wt% gyroid 1-PCL (Gy-1-PCL) shows a clearly formed gyroid pore and uniform distribution of the crystallites of 1 in the polymer matrix at the walls of the gyroid slabs as evident from its FE-SEM (Fig. 5c). The 3D-microtomography analysis reveals the thickness of the crystallites in Gy-1-PCL in the range of 1–10 microns with an average thickness of around 5 microns (Fig. 5e, f and Fig. S41, ESI†).
The Gy-1-PCL device (Fig. 5d) was then utilized for piezoelectric energy harvesting under similar operating conditions of ≈21 N and 10 Hz. These measurements gave a VOC–PP of 41 V signifying that the output voltages were uncompromised during the scale-up of the process (Fig. 5g, Fig. S42a and S43, ESI†). A marginal increase in voltage output (4.8 V) for Gy-1-PCL as compared to that of the thin-film based 10 wt% 1-PCL device could be attributed to better dipole alignment provided by the shear force of the 3D printing process, reduced clamping effect and increased device surface area (3.6 to 6 cm2). The IPP of the Gy-1-PCL device was measured to be 7.6 μA at a load resistance of 4.7 MΩ, which is slightly higher than that of the 10 wt% 1-PCL device (6.9 μA) (Fig. 5h inset and Fig. S42b, ESI†).
Furthermore, to evaluate the utility of Gy-1-PCL for practical applications, its output voltages were measured under different load resistances ranging from 100 kΩ to 88 MΩ (Fig. S44, ESI†). For comparison, a parallel set of experiments were performed for all the composite film-based devices as well (Fig. S45, ESI†). Notably, the voltage increases with the increase in load resistances approaching a value close to VOC–PP and saturates for higher load resistances for all these devices. The corresponding power density (PD) values at each load resistance were calculated using the formula VI/A (where V, I and A are the peak voltage, peak current at 760 kΩ and area of the device, respectively). The maximum power density (PD) value of 56.8 μW cm−2 was observed for the Gy-1-PCL device at a peak resistance of 760 kΩ (Fig. 5h). This value is slightly higher than that of the thin-film based 10 wt% 1-PCL device (48.1 μW cm−2) (Fig. S46, ESI†). The observed PD values for both these devices are among the highest reported for any nanogenerator device containing all-organic components (Table S7, ESI†). The durability test performed on the best-performing 10 wt% Gy-1-PCL and 1-PCL devices for 10000 cycles showed no degradation in the output voltages confirming the mechanical robustness of the embedded material in them (Fig. S47–S48, ESI†).
The PENG measurements performed on both the 10 wt% 1-PCL and Gy-1-PCL devices showed significant durability even after a period of 5 months under ambient conditions (Fig. S49, ESI†). Remarkably, both these devices, 10 wt% 1-PCL and Gy-1-PCL, showed no performance degradation after exposing them to different relative humidity conditions ranging from 25 to 99% corroborating their utility under practical conditions (Fig. S50, ESI†). The retention in voltage output even at 99% RH can be attributed to the device architecture involving the encapsulation of the ferroelectric crystallites in the polymer matrix and its further protection by using Kapton tapes.
Capacitor charging experiments were performed to evaluate the energy storage capabilities of both Gy-1-PCL and 10 wt% 1-PCL devices by using a 100 μF capacitor. For this purpose, a four-diode bridge rectifier circuit was connected to these devices to convert the generated AC voltages during the impact measurements into DC potentials (Fig. 6a). Both these devices store sizable charges (calculated from the voltages stored shown in Fig. S51, ESI†) with Gy-1-PCL storing a higher value of 241.7 μC, while 10 wt% 1-PCL stores 164.9 μC (Fig. 6b). The corresponding energies stored in the capacitor were also seen to follow a similar trend with the maximum stored energies of 121.6 and 83.2 μJ, respectively, for the Gy-1-PCL and 10 wt% 1-PCL devices (Fig. S52, ESI†). The increase in the charge accumulated in the capacitor using the Gy-1-PCL device is a testament to the efficient energy harvesting and storage capabilities of the large-scale 3D printed device.

Conclusions
The design and discovery of high-fidelity mechanical energy harvesting devices necessitate fine-tuning of the piezoelectric material performance at both molecular and macroscopic levels. In this work, the chiral molecule containing DMBA cation was employed to code for the polar order and resulting phenomena of its tetrafluoroborate salt. While the supramolecular material 1 is intrinsically efficient at piezoelectric energy harvesting, as shown for 10 wt% composite devices with the PCL polymer (output voltage of 36.2 V and power density of 48.1 μW cm−2), its performance could be preserved by the fabrication of gyroid-shaped microstructures through 3D printing. Indeed, miniaturized gyroid-shaped 10 wt% 1-PCL composite slabs feature an exceptionally high output voltage of 41 V translating to a power density of 56.8 μW cm−2, thus setting up a new benchmark for energy harvesting performance in the class of all-organic nanogenerator devices. Remarkably, the output performance of the material was found to be uncompromised in the scaled-up process.
This advancement has been enabled by obtaining new chiral organic ammonium salt 1 crystallizing in the non-centrosymmetric tetragonal P42 space group with rich inter-molecular H-bonding interactions that strengthen its long-range polar order. The SHG measurements confirm the acentric setting of 1 across all phases. Indeed, 1 exhibits two phase transitions, namely of ferroelectric–ferroelectric and ferroelectric–piezoelectric type, as determined from XRD, DSC, dielectric and P–E loop measurements. The ferro- and piezoelectric domain characteristics and polarization switching behavior of 1 were further established by PFM measurements. Also, the piezoelectric nature of 1 was further established by d33 measurement on its compacted pellet. All in all, from an environmental perspective, combining a biodegradable polymer such as PCL with a high-polarization salt such as 1 makes these 1-PCL composite devices less toxic and less expensive for future use in wearable electronics. Currently, we are working towards such processes in employing these and similar materials for next-generation electronics.

New concepts
In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of simple and efficient two-component ferroelectric material 1 of formula {[Me3CCH(Me)NH3][BF4]} consisting of a chiral 3,3-dimethyl-2-butylammonium (DMBA) cation and a multi-atomic tetrafluoroborate anion. The simplicity of its preparation and structure has enabled the first-time fabrication of a high-performance small-molecule-based scaled-up nanogenerator device by ‘additive manufacturing’ popularly termed ‘the three-dimensional printing’ technique. The noncentrosymmetric structure of 1 was probed by DSC, SHG, dielectric and ferroelectric measurements. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) of the single crystals of 1 showed the existence of clear-cut electrical domains and well-resolved amplitude butterfly and phase hysteresis loops confirming the ferro- and piezoelectric nature of 1. Furthermore, the energy harvesting utility of 1 as a piezoelectric nanogenerator was performed on the composite thin films of 1 with biodegradable polycaprolactone polymer and on its 3D-printed composite slabs. The output voltages and power densities of the best-performing 10 wt% composite film were found to be retained on the scaled-up 3D-printed composite device yielding a maximum power density of 56.8 μW cm−2, the highest among the nanogenerators of all-organic composites. The energy storage activity of the device shows the rapid charging of a 100 μF capacitor within 200 seconds. This work, therefore, demonstrates the use of chirality as a tool for preparing high-performance polar ferroelectric materials and 3D printing as a platform for the fabrication of complex piezoelectric nanogenerator device architectures for future wearable electronics.
