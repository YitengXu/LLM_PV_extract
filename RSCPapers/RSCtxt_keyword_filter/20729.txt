    , Accepted 30th June 2012First published on 4th July 2012AbstractClose-packed graphene suffers from a low surface area, which limits its electrocatalytic activity as the counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). We report herein the synthesis of a porous graphene/SiO2 nanocomposite converted from graphene oxide mixed with SiO2 nanoparticles (∼12 nm) through facile hydrazine hydrate reduction. Graphene and graphene/SiO2 films prepared by drop-casting the suspensions without organic binder or surfactant onto the conductive glass substrates at room temperature without heat treatment have been applied directly as counter electrodes in DSSCs. As compared to the nonporous graphene film, the porous graphene/SiO2 composite film demonstrates much better electrocatalytic performance for the reduction of triiodide in DSSCs due to the remarkably enhanced surface area. As a consequence, the incorporation of SiO2 nanoparticles in the graphene film improves the fill factor and power conversion efficiency by 65% and 69%, respectively. With a 2.5 μm-thick graphene/SiO2 composite film as the counter electrode, the power conversion efficiency of the DSSC achieves 6.82%, which is comparable to that for the DSSC with a Pt counter electrode.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted tremendous attention from scientific and technological fields in the past two decades, since O'Regan and Grätzel published a seminal paper on a dye-sensitized nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cell with fairly good photovoltaic performance.1,2 Owing to the low cost and relatively high efficiency, DSSCs have been considered as the most promising alternative to traditional silicon solar cells, although some properties need to be further improved. Typically, DSSCs have a sandwich structure with two conductive glass substrates, which consist of a photoanode comprising TiO2 nanocrystals sensitized by dye molecules, an electrolyte containing the iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple, and a counter electrode (CE). Due to its superior conductivity, stability and high electrocatalytic activity toward the I−/I3− redox couple, platinum (Pt) is extensively used as a competent CE material for DSSCs. However, the high cost of this precious metal limits its application, especially for large-scale production, which stimulates numerous research efforts to exploit substitutes for the Pt cathode of DSSCs in order to reduce the overall cost.3
A wide variety of carbonaceous materials have been utilized as CEs, such as activated carbon,4,5 carbon black,6,7 graphite,8–10 and carbon nanotubes.3,11–14 As one of the most promising materials in nanotechnology and new energy, graphene presents many amazing features and has been employed as a CE in DSSCs by several groups.15–19 We developed a self-assembled monolayer of graphene/Pt as a CE and achieved a good power conversion efficiency.16 H. Choi and co-workers17 prepared graphene based CEs through electrophoretic deposition followed by annealing at a proper temperature and obtained a power conversion efficiency of 5.69%. I. Aksay's group reported a novel CE based on polymer functionalized graphene and achieved a power conversion efficiency of 4.99%, which was comparable to 5.48% for a Pt electrode.18 M. Grätzel's group used commercial graphene nanoplatelets as CE materials and got a power conversion efficiency of ∼5.1% in both liquid and ionic liquid electrolytes.19 According to the reported results, graphene exhibits great potential as an alternative to Pt for use as the cathode of DSSCs. However, we notice that graphene nanosheets (GNS) accumulate tightly through π–π stacking just like graphite, which results in a low surface area and hence a low electrocatalytic activity when applied as the CE in DSSCs. Therefore, GNS with a porous structure is expected to exhibit better catalytic performance for reducing I3−.
Herein, we attempted to reassemble GNS in the presence of SiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), which are common and cheap nanomaterials with good chemical stability and no deterioration of electrocatalytic properties for GNS. The incorporation of SiO2 NPs in nonporous graphene results in a meso-porous structure and thus enhances the catalytic performance for I3− reduction remarkably due to the increased surface area. A power conversion efficiency of 6.82% for the DSSC with the GNS/SiO2 composite CE has been achieved, which is 69% larger than that for the GNS CE based DSSC. It should be noted that all the processes for fabricating the Pt-free CEs were performed in air at room temperature without any annealing steps, because the resulting films contain no surfactant or binder. The facile preparation procedure for the GNS/SiO2 composite CE offers a new path for fabricating cost-effective Pt-free CEs and can be applied to the mass production of DSSCs.
Experimental
Synthesis of GNS and GNS/SiO2 suspensions
Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from natural graphite powder (Alading Reagent Inc.) by a modified Hummers method,20 and the GNS suspension was prepared by hydrazine hydrate reduction as described in a previous publication.21 To obtain the GO/SiO2 composite material, 5.0 mg of SiO2 NPs (12 nm in diameter, Strem Chemicals, Inc.) were added to 10 mL of GO aqueous suspension (0.25 mg mL−1), and a brown suspension without observable sediment was obtained after the mixture was ultrasonicated for 1 h. Subsequently, 25 μL hydrazine hydrate (10 wt%, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) was added to the above suspension, which was heated in an oil bath at 100 °C for 1 h to form the GNS/SiO2 suspension.
Fabrication of CEs and DSSCs
The GNS/SiO2 CE was fabricated by a drop-casting method, as shown in Scheme 1. 50 μL GNS/SiO2 suspension was drop-casted onto the surface of conductive glass (fluorine-doped SnO2, FTO glass, 15 Ω per square, transmittance 80%, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd.), which was masked by 3M scotch tape with an aperture area of 0.5 × 0.5 cm2. The droplet of GNS/SiO2 suspension was dried at room temperature. The composite loading was adjusted by repeating the drop-casting deposition, and the thickness of the CE was determined with a surface profiler (Dektak 150, Veeco). A series of CEs with certain thicknesses (±0.02 μm) were selected from a pile of CEs prepared in one batch. Pure GNS CEs, which were employed as reference, were prepared via the same method as that for the GNS/SiO2 CE, and the graphene loading was controlled to be equal to that in the 2.5 μm-thick GNS/SiO2 CE. The adhesion of these graphene based films to FTO was good, and the films did not peel off during the fabrication of DSSCs. For comparison, pyrolytic Pt CEs were prepared by the deposition of 20 μL of H2PtCl6 in ethanol (5 mM) on a 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 FTO glass followed by 400 °C heat treatment for 30 min.

The TiO2 photoanodes were prepared according to a previous paper,22 and were soaked overnight in N719 solution (Lumtec Corp., 0.3 mM in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and tert-butanol with a volume ratio of 1:1). The DSSCs were assembled with a dye-sensitized photoanode, a CE, and an electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-n-propylimidazolium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich Co.) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (Acros).
Characterization
The Raman scattering measurements were performed at 25 °C with 633 nm excitation on a Renishaw spectrometer using a 100× objective. The structural properties of graphene and the graphene/SiO2 composite were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F, JEOL). Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, S-4800, Hitachi) was applied to study the morphologies of the CEs. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) specific surface area and pore size distribution were analyzed by the BET equation and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) theory using a surface area and porosity analyzer (ASAP 2020, Micromeritics). Symmetric dummy cells assembled with two identical CEs were used for electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements, which were filled with the same electrolyte as that used for the DSSCs. The active area of the dummy cell was 0.36 cm2. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 in a three-electrode system with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode and various CEs as the working electrode. An anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 was used as the supporting electrolyte. The reference electrode was calibrated with a ferrocene solution after the CV measurements. CV and EIS measurements were performed on an electrochemical workstation (ZAHNER ZENNIUM CIMPS-1, Germany). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs, from which the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (η) can be determined, were recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-91193 equipped with a 1000 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5 filter). The light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Oriel-91150). A black mask with an aperture area of 0.2304 cm2 was applied on the surface of the DSSCs to avoid stray light completely.
Results and discussion
Characterization of GNS and GNS/SiO2 composite
Fig. S1 (see ESI†) shows the Raman spectra for the GO, GNS and GNS/SiO2 films. The G-band and D-band for GO are located at 1593 and 1331 cm−1, respectively. Upon chemical reduction of GO to GNS, the G-band shifts to 1587 cm−1 while the D-band remains unchanged. From the pure GNS to the GNS/SiO2 composite film, the peak positions for the D-band (1331 cm−1) and G-band (1587 cm−1) did not change and neither did the intensity ratio. This indicated that the SiO2 NPs were physically adsorbed on the surface of graphene (ESI†).
The GNS and GNS/SiO2 composite samples were examined by TEM. The TEM image of GNS (Fig. 1a) demonstrates a folded structure due to the flexibility, and the edge of GNS could be clearly identified. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) shows a spot hexagonal pattern, indicating the single-crystalline nature and the regular carbon framework of the GNS (the inset in Fig. 1a). This proves that the GNS is well exfoliated via the chemical reduction of GO.23 Furthermore, the intensity ratio of the inner and outer circle spots is determined to be ∼1, corresponding to a single-layer graphene structure.24 The image of the GNS/SiO2 composite (Fig. 1b) reveals that small SiO2 NPs in an aggregated form are adsorbed on the surface of the GNS as residual oxygen-containing groups on the GNS had interactions with the SiO2 NPs.25

FESEM was used to examine the morphologies of the GNS and GNS/SiO2 films, which served as the CEs in the DSSCs. Fig. 2 gives top view SEM images of the drop-casted GNS and GNS/SiO2 films on FTO glass with different magnifications. The GNS CE showed a relatively homogeneous and smooth morphology with nearly no cracks and pores on the film surface (Fig. 2a and b). By contrast, the GNS/SiO2 film has a rough surface and many pores are observed due to the presence of SiO2 aggregates. The reassembling of GNS with SiO2 NPs results in the separation of nanosheets due to the adsorption of SiO2 NPs on the GNS surface.

To substantiate the formation of pores within the composite film, the BET surface areas and pore size distributions are characterized using nitrogen gas sorption, as shown in Fig. 3. The theoretical BET surface area of fully exfoliated pristine graphene is up to 2620 m2 g−1,26 but the BET surface area of the GNS film tested in this work is only 8.6 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of 0.002 cm3 g−1. There are no obvious porous features for the GNS sample, as shown from the isotherm (Fig. 3a) and pore size distribution curve (Fig. 3b), suggesting a closely packed structure. However, the BET surface area for the GNS/SiO2 (weight ratio 1:2) composite film increases up to 229.0 m2 g−1 with a pore volume of 0.66 cm3 g−1. As the BET surface area of the SiO2 NPs used is 151.8 m2 g−1, the specific surface area of graphene in the GNS/SiO2 film is calculated as 383.4 m2 g−1 by subtracting the contribution from the SiO2 NPs. The enhanced specific surface area of the GNS is evidently caused by the incorporation of SiO2 NPs in the graphene film. A type IV isotherm with an H3 type hysteresis loop is observed for the GNS/SiO2 sample (Fig. 3a), indicating that the pores are formed between nanosheets separated by SiO2 NPs. The graphene/SiO2 composite has a narrow pore size distribution centered at 4.0 nm, as shown in Fig. 3b. SiO2 NPs play a significant role in the graphene layers to build up a porous architecture.

Electrochemical behaviors of CEs
As an important and efficient tool for analyzing the catalytic activity in an electrochemical system, CV was used to evaluate the electrochemical catalytic activity for reducing I3− at the same conditions. Fig. 4 shows the CV curves for the GNS, GNS/SiO2 and Pt CEs in a solution containing the redox couple I−/I3−. In the scan direction from negative to positive, I− is first oxidized to I3− (peak Ox-1, Fig. 4) and then oxidized to iodine (peak Ox-2). In the scan direction from positive to negative, iodine is reduced to I3− (peak Red-2) and then reduced to I− (peak Red-1). Since the CE of a DSSC plays a role in catalyzing the reduction of I3− to I−, the characteristics of peaks Ox-1 and Red-1 are the focus of our analysis. I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)

Fig. 4a compares the CV curves for the GNS, GNS/SiO2 composite (with the same graphene loading) and Pt CE. For the Pt CE, the two pairs of redox peaks are distinct, implying its great catalytic activity. The peak attributed to the reduction of I3− (peak Red-1) was not resolved for the GNS film, while it was clearly observed for the GNS/SiO2 composite film. In addition, the cathodic and anodic peak current densities corresponding to reaction (1) for the GNS/SiO2 film are much higher than those for the GNS film. Although the specific surface area of the composite film is 45 times that of the graphene film, the peak currents for the composite film do not increase in value with the surface area. As some pores in the composite film are too small to be available for the redox species and electrolyte diffusion within the film is limited by the pores in the composite film, it is reasonable that the observed CV peak currents for the composite film are smaller than expected. As SiO2 is electrochemically inactive, the improved electrocatalytic performance for reducing I3− to I− by mixing SiO2 NPs into GNS is attributed to the enhanced surface area.

Fig. 4b shows the film thickness dependence of the CV characteristics for the GNS/SiO2 composite film. As the film thickness of GNS/SiO2 increases, both the cathodic and anodic peak currents increase as the number of effective catalytic sites increases with the film thickness due to the increased GNS amount.
EIS was carried out using a symmetric cell (CE∥electrolyte∥CE) consisting of two identical CEs to investigate the properties of charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface and electrolyte diffusion in bulk solution or the film pores. The effect of incorporation of SiO2 on the electrocatalytic activity has been investigated, and the Nyquist plots are compared in Fig. 5a, where a curve for the dummy cell with the Pt CE is also included for reference. The dependence of the catalytic performance on the thickness of the GNS/SiO2 film is displayed in Fig. 5b. According to the equivalent circuit shown in Fig. 5c, Rs is the Ohmic serial resistance, Rct is the charge-transfer resistance at the electrode interface, CPE is the constant phase element describing the deviation from ideal capacitance due to the roughness of the electrodes, Zpore is the Nernst diffusion impedance in the pores of film, and ZN is the Nernst diffusion impedance in the bulk electrolyte solution between the electrodes.6,18,27,28

The insets in (a) and (b) give magnified curves in the high-frequency region. The samples are measured from 500 kHz to 0.1 Hz at 0 V bias and an ac amplitude of 10 mV. (c) Equivalent circuit diagram. 
The Nyquist plot for the Pt CE presents the typical characteristics of a thin film CE, where the catalytic reaction occurs on a virtually nonporous surface and the parameter Zpore can be omitted.27 The left semicircle in the higher frequency region arises from Rct and the corresponding CPE at the electrode/electrolyte interface, while the right semicircle in the lower frequency region arises from ZN of the I−/I3− redox couple in the bulk electrolyte.19 The EIS curve for the GNS CE exhibits only one large semicircle for charge transfer at the electrode interface. The semicircle for bulk electrolyte diffusion is not resolved due to possible overlapping with the middle-frequency semicircle. The absence of a semicircle for Zpore is attributed to the nonporous structure of the GNS, similar to the observation for the Pt CE. Therefore, the parameter Zpore for the GNS CE can also be ignored. By contrast, the high-frequency semicircle (left side) for Zpore is observed for the GNS/SiO2 CE due to its porous structure. The right semicircle in the middle frequency region is attributed to Rct and the corresponding CPE at the electrode/electrolyte interface. Another semicircle due to ZN which should appear in the low-frequency domain is not resolved due to possible overlapping with the middle-frequency semicircle.
Generally, Rs and Rct are the main parameters for EIS investigation, which are determined from the high-frequency intercept of the left semicircle on the real axis and the real component radius of the corresponding semicircle, respectively.29 In addition, we estimated the Zpore by the real component radius of the left semicircle in the high frequency region. The obtained parameters are summarized in Table 1. Comparison of the EIS spectra for the GNS and GNS/SiO2 films (Fig. 5a) reveals that the Rs decreases from 15.4 to 5.6 Ω and Rct decreases from 111.5 to 39.8 Ω upon introduction of SiO2 into graphene (Table 1). The presence of SiO2 can improve the adhesion of the CE film onto FTO, which is responsible for the reduced Rs. The porous structure of the GNS/SiO2 composite film, which has a larger surface area than the GNS film, enhances the accessibility of the electrolyte to the inside of the film and is favorable for the reduction of I3− to I−. Therefore, the high surface area of the GNS/SiO2 composite is the main reason for its low Rct as compared to the GNS film. This conclusion is consistent with the CV results.

The film thickness dependence of the EIS spectra for the GNS/SiO2 film (Fig. 5b) indicates that Zpore increases but Rct decreases with the film thickness. The thicker film has more pores, which blocks electrolyte diffusion within the composite film, resulting in increased Zpore. Conversely, the thicker film contains more graphene to catalyze the redox reactions, resulting in reduced Rct. As Zpore and Rct change oppositely with the film thickness, there should be an optimized CE film thickness for the best solar cell performance, which will be discussed below.
Photovoltaic performance
To optimize the CE film thickness towards higher solar cell performance, DSSCs based on the GNS/SiO2 CE with various thicknesses were tested, and the derived photovoltaic parameters were summarized in Table 1. Three parallel devices for each sample were tested, and the deviations were listed in Table 1. The Voc is independent of the CE film thickness in the range of 0.5–4.5 μm, while Jsc and FF are influenced by the film thickness. As the Voc is in principle determined by the difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 under illumination and the redox potential of the redox couple, it is reasonable that the Voc is not affected by the CE. Jsc decreases slightly with increasing film thickness, inversely correlated with Zpore. This indicates that photocurrent generation is somewhat limited by electrolyte diffusion in the pores. As Rs is similar for the composite CE films with various thicknesses, the different FFs should be related to the Rct. FF increased from 0.48 to 0.61 when the CE film thickness increased from 0.5 to 2.5 μm due to a significant decrease in Rct. As Rct decreased slightly with further increasing the CE thickness from 2.5 to 4.5 μm, the change of FF was negligible. As a result, the 2.5 μm-thick GNS/SiO2 CE is optimal for solar cell performance.

Fig. 6 compares the photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs with GNS and GNS/SiO2 that contain the same amount of graphene. The DSSC with the GNS CE produced an η of 4.04% (Jsc = 15.17 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, FF = 0.37), while the DSSC with the GNS/SiO2 CE containing the same amount of graphene produced an η of 6.82% (Jsc = 15.52 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, FF = 0.61). The incorporation of SiO2 increased the Jsc slightly but improved FF remarkably. As a consequence, η was raised by 69%. The significant increase in the FF by 65% is attributed to the much reduced Rct and Rs. For comparison, the DSSC with a Pt CE produced an η of 7.28% (Jsc = 15.79 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.72 V, FF = 0.64).

Conclusions
We have developed a new type of Pt-free counter electrode based on graphene/SiO2 composites for use in DSSCs. The GNS/SiO2 nanocomposite without any organic binder or surfactant can be drop-casted on conductive glass to form crack-free films at ambient conditions. It deserves to be mentioned that all the processes for fabricating the Pt-free GNS/SiO2 CEs are carried out in air at room temperature without any sintering steps, since the composite contains no surfactant or binder. Non-porous graphene can be converted to a porous architecture when SiO2 NPs are mixed with graphene. This porous structure facilitates the electrolyte permeating through the composite film and exposes much more active sites of graphene to the electrolyte for catalyzing the reduction of I3−, accordingly resulting in the enhancement of the charge transfer reaction. The fill factor and power conversion efficiency of the DSSC are improved by 65% and 69%, respectively, upon incorporation of SiO2 NPs into the GNS. By optimizing the thickness of the CE, the DSSC assembled with a 2.5 μm-thick GNS/SiO2 CE achieved an overall power conversion efficiency of 6.82% under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. Considering the simple method and mild conditions, the GNS/SiO2 composite film as a cathode is very promising to replace Pt CE by virtue of its great cost advantage.
