    , Accepted 6th December 2012First published on 6th December 2012AbstractPhotoactive NiO electrodes for cathodic dye-sensitised solar cells (p-DSCs) have been prepared with thicknesses ranging between 0.4 and 3.0 μm by spray-depositing pre-formed NiO nanoparticles on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates. The larger thicknesses were obtained in sequential sintering steps using a conventional furnace (CS) and a newly developed rapid discharge sintering (RDS) method. The latter procedure is employed for the first time for the preparation of p-DSCs. In particular, RDS represents a scalable procedure that is based on microwave-assisted plasma formation that allows the production in series of mesoporous NiO electrodes with large surface areas for p-type cell photocathodes. RDS possesses the unique feature of transmitting heat from the bulk of the system towards its outer interfaces with controlled confinement of the heating zone. The use of RDS results in a drastic reduction of processing times with respect to other deposition methods that involve heating/calcination steps with associated reduced costs in terms of energy. P1-dye sensitized NiO electrodes obtained via the RDS procedure have been tested in DSC devices and their performances have been analysed and compared with those of cathodic DSCs derived from CS-deposited samples. The largest conversion efficiencies (0.12%) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies, IPCEs (50%), were obtained with sintered NiO electrodes having thicknesses of ∼1.5–2.0 μm. In all the devices, the photogenerated holes in NiO live significantly longer (τh ∼ 1 s) than have previously been reported for P1-sensitized NiO photocathodes. In addition, P1-sensitised sintered electrodes give rise to relatively high photovoltages (up to 135 mV) when the triiodide–iodide redox couple is used.
Introduction
For the last two decades the interest in the development of efficient dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs) has been growing fast and, with the increasing awareness of the importance of reducing CO2 emissions, the subject has become more relevant than ever before. So far, investigations have been carried out mostly on the optimisation of n-type devices based on TiO2,1 and DSCs based on photoactive cathodes (p-DSCs) were reported for the first time only in 1999 by He et al.2 The aim of the research on p-DSCs is to couple dye-sensitised photocathodes with state-of-the-art dye-sensitized photoanodes1 in tandem cells3 in order to achieve higher efficiencies with respect to DSCs that use one photoactive electrode alone. However, at present, the efficiency of tandem DSCs is limited by the low efficiency of the photocathode (the maximum reported efficiency is 0.4%),3d and substantial improvements in both photocurrent and photovoltage are still required to exploit the potential of tandem devices. Recently, there has been a renascent interest towards photoactive cathodes for DSCs based on NiO, because relatively high incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) could be achieved,3d,4 and open circuit voltage (VOC) increased.3c,5 Much of this improvement stemmed from the introduction of new dyes specifically designed for NiO, which exhibit efficient photo-induced charge separation and slower charge recombination at the NiO–dye interface.3d,6 In addition, thicker NiO cathodes with larger surface areas have been prepared to increase the dye loading and, consequently, light harvesting efficiency.4a,7 The study of new redox couples that replace the system I3−/I− was also undertaken for improving the photovoltage in p-DSCs.3c,8 The most challenging target is to replace the semiconductor with one displaying a lower valence band edge in order to increase the maximum achievable photovoltage. Compared to the range of n-type semiconductors that are available,1b relatively few p-type semiconductors exist with appropriate valence band edge potential with respect to the redox potential of DSCs shuttles.8 Those which do include metal oxides like NiO,9 CuO,10 Cr2O311 and, more recently CuGaO2.12 Despite these efforts in search of stable, transparent, p-type substrates with mesoporous morphology, NiO remains the most suitable material as photocathode for p-DSCs. TiO2 films generally show higher photocurrents than NiO electrodes by virtue of their larger thickness (l ∼ 8–10 μm for TiO2 in n-DSCs compared to 1–2 μm for NiO in p-DSCs) and, consequently, greater dye loading.13 In the present work we report a new scalable method for the preparation of nanoporous NiO electrodes for p-DSCs, by spraying films of NiO nanoparticles (diameter ∼50 nm) onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrates and subsequent sintering using a technique based on microwave assisted plasma sintering.14 This is a faster sintering procedure when compared to conventional furnace sintering (CS), and this is why it is also known as rapid discharge sintering (RDS) technique. RDS results in sintering of thick NiO films (l ∼ 3 μm)3c with good mechanical stability, and strong adhesion on various types of substrates.14d The electrodes of sintered NiO were characterised with a range of surface and electrochemical techniques. The NiO films obtained were sensitised with the organic dye P1 which have been previously shown to produce high IPCE in combination with NiO.4 Sealed devices containing the photoactive P1-sensitized NiO electrodes, prepared using the two different techniques, were assembled with a platinised FTO anode and infiltrated with an acetonitrile solution of triiodide–iodide. The J–V characteristics of these p-DSCs were measured and the photoelectrochemical behaviour was determined. Samples prepared by the CS techniques are called 1, and those by RDS are 2. The samples were prepared with three different thicknesses: samples 1a–c and 2a–c. The results obtained are compared with those previously reported for p-DSCs based on NiO photocathodes prepared with wet, non-scalable methods that require the utilization of NiO precursors and do not make use of preformed NiO nanoparticles.4a,5,7b,15 To our knowledge this is the first report on nanoporous NiO photocathodes prepared with a scalable method for p-DSCs purposes.
Experimental section
NiO layer deposition
The fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass (supplied by Solaronix with a sheet resistance ∼15 Ω sq−1 and glass thickness 3 mm) was cut to an area of 2 × 2 cm2 and cleaned in an ultrasonic bath for 5 minutes in propanol and then acetone. NiO nanoparticles films were then deposited by spraying a slurry made of NiO nanoparticles (obtained from Sigma-Aldrich with a diameter of ca. 50 nm, as confirmed from SEM pictures recorded for films prior to sintering) in 2-propanol (20 mg mL−1) onto the FTO substrates according to the procedure reported by Halme et al. for the deposition of TiO2 layers.16 Layer thickness could be varied through the number of spraying passes: for samples a (thickness 0.4 μm) a single pass was applied, whereas samples b (thickness 1.5–2.0 μm) and samples c (thickness 2.5–3.0 μm) required 3 and 5 passes, respectively. Samples b and c were sintered with a single thermal treatment after the completion of the number of spraying passes.
NiO thin film sintering
After spray deposition, a sintering step was carried out to optimise the electrical connectivity between the NiO particles in the sprayed layer, and to achieve a higher level of adhesion between the NiO film and the FTO substrate. The sintering was carried out using two different approaches: 1 in a conventional muffle furnace (CS method), and 2 using the microwave assisted plasma sintering technique (RDS method).14d Three samples of each type were made to compare the reproducibility of the electrochemical results and the DSCs performance (vide infra).
In the CS method three NiO films (type 1) were heated in air in a Carbolite Furnace (RHF 1200) at the rate of 15 °C min−1 until the maximum temperature of 450 °C was reached and then sintered for 5 minutes. After this a cooling ramp of 15 °C min−1 was applied.
RDS (type 2) was carried out using a circumferential antenna plasma (CAP) microwave system described in detail elsewhere.17 An input power of 2.4 kW was supplied from a Mugge microwave power supply operating at a frequency of 2.45 GHz. The microwaves were guided to the plasma chamber via a coaxial tunable waveguide, which had a radial expansion and was directed towards a ring-shaped quartz window. The microwaves passed through the window with uniform amplitude and phase distribution, and possessed a rotational symmetry of propagation. Plasma was formed in a gaseous mixture of argon and oxygen with a partial pressure ratio 10:1 at the total pressure of 5 mbar. The composition of the gas mixture and the total pressure were selected in order to achieve the required treatment temperature of 450 °C during the RDS process. The dwell time of the samples in the plasma chamber during the RDS treatments was 5 minutes. During sintering the temperature of the substrates was continuously monitored with a LASCON QP003 two-colour pyrometer from Dr Merganthaler GmbH & Co. Three spray-deposited NiO samples were simultaneously treated with plasma by rotating them inside a 5 cm diameter plasma sphere located at the centre of the CAP chamber.
NiO film characterization
The NiO film thickness (l) was measured by step height measurement using a WYKO NT1100 optical profilometer in the vertical scanning interferometry (VSI) mode.
For the cross-sectional investigations and morphological analysis, the NiO electrodes were mounted on stubs using double-sided carbon tape, and sputter-coated with platinum using an Emitech K575X sputtering unit. The metallization of NiO coatings prevented surface charging by the electron beam. Samples morphology was then examined using a FEI Quanta 3D FEG Dual Beam (FEI Ltd, Hillsboro, USA).
The XPS data were taken with a Kratos AXIS 165 XPS spectrometer. XPS spectra were collected in the normal mode with X-rays excitation along the direction normal to surface for testing the binding energy range 0–1400 eV. The curve fitting was carried out on Ni2p and O1s core level peaks to determine and survey the chemical composition of NiO coatings. Casa XPS software was used to analyze the data.
Electrochemical characterization of NiO coatings
Electrochemical investigations were carried out using a CH Instruments (Austin, Texas, USA) potentiostat (604C) and a three-electrode cell configuration: the NiO coatings and their dye-sensitised version on fluorine doped-tin oxide (FTO) substrate were used as working electrodes; the counter electrode was a platinum disk (diameter: 2 mm, from CH Instruments); the reference electrode was the Ag/AgCl redox couple in water. The electrolyte composition was aqueous 0.2 M KCl, 0.01 M KH2PO4 and 0.01 M K2HPO4.15e For cyclic voltammetry experiments a scan rate of 40 mV s−1 was used.
Cathodic DSC preparation and characterization
Sintered NiO films were cut, washed with ethanol and dried at 250 °C for 10 min and allowed to cool to 100 °C. Subsequently, the films were immersed in the sensitizer solution (0.2 mM P1 in acetonitrile) for 16 h. The transmittance spectra of the sensitized films were recorded using a Varian Cary 5000 spectrophotometer fitted with an integrating sphere. The sensitised films were sealed face-to-face with a platinised FTO counter electrode in a sandwich configuration using a 30 μm thick pre-cut Surlyn® thermoplastic frame (6 × 6 mm interior) as the separator. The device was filled with the electrolyte 0.1 M I2, 1.0 M LiI in acetonitrile through a pre-drilled hole in the counter electrode using reduced pressure. The hole was finally sealed with Surlyn® and a glass cover-slide. For J–V and IPCE measurements the films were masked using a 4 × 4 mm opaque frame and in all cases the cells were illuminated from the NiO working electrode side. J–V characteristic curves were measured with a Newport solar simulator (model 91160) giving light with AM1.5G spectral distribution. The spectrum of the incident light was calibrated using a reference cell (Fraunhofer ISE) certified to an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. IPCE spectra were recorded using a computer controlled setup consisting of a xenon light source (Spectral Products ASB-XE-175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110), and a potentiostat (EG&G PAR 273). Hole lifetime and transport times measurements were performed using a white LED (Luxeon Star, power: 1 W) as the light source. Voltage and current traces were recorded with a 16-bit resolution digital acquisition board (National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems SR570), and a custom made system using electromagnetic switches. IPCE was determined according to the experimental procedure reported in ref. 18. Transport times and lifetimes were determined by monitoring photocurrent and photovoltage transients at different light intensities upon application of a small square wave modulation to the base light intensity. The photocurrent and photovoltaic responses were fitted using first-order kinetics to obtain time constants.18b
Results and discussion
NiO electrodes characterization
The NiO electrodes were prepared as shown in Table 1. The thicknesses are given with an uncertainty of 0.5 μm because of the non-uniformity of the film height as observed using the optical profilometer. The thickness slightly decreased in passing from the centre to the side of the NiO electrode irrespective of the sintering method.

The maximum sintering temperature (TMAX = 450 °C), and the dwelling time (5 min) at TMAX for the completion of NiO coatings sintering are the same in both CS and RDS procedures. However, the heating/cooling time was considerably longer for the CS procedure (see Fig. S1 in the ESI†), and, more importantly, the direction of the heat flow during the sintering process. In the muffle furnace the heating element causes heat to flow from the exterior towards the bulk of the sample. Conversely, the RDS procedure has the unique feature of heating a sample from its bulk to its borders (inside-out heat flow) as a consequence of the presence of plasma which confines the volume where microwave radiation is absorbed and heating takes place.14
The morphology of the NiO samples was investigated using SEM (Fig. 1). For the RDS samples 2, there was a reduced grain growth and the surfaces, were less even than those of CS samples 1. The increased growth of NiO grains in samples 1 is ascribed to the slower cooling rate (15 °C min−1 – see the Experimental section) employed in the CS procedure. Longer cooling times lead to the actual prolongation of the sintering process which can occur also at temperature values slightly different from TMAX. In contrast, in the RDS procedure the heating, which is based on rapidly switchable microwave radiation, requires only 5 min of cooling time subsequent to the plasma treatment. This represents the minimum period necessary to prevent thermal shocks that would cause coating cracks or the breakage of the FTO/glass substrates.

The mesoporous features of the differently sintered NiO coatings were also examined using a FIB/SEM cross-sectional view of the films (Fig. 2). From these images it is clear that RDS sintered electrodes 2 present larger voids than CS electrodes 1 through the whole thickness of the film. As a consequence of that samples 2 have a more open morphology and exhibit a higher porosity than samples 1. This difference can be explained in terms of the different heating dynamics in the RDS and CS procedures. As already outlined, RDS treatment involves the volumetric heating of the sample, and it is chosen for providing a homogeneous release of heat inside a small matrix like micron-sized NiO electrodes. In the CS procedure, the furnace operates by means of a conductive mode of heating and the outer surface of the NiO electrodes represents the primarily selected heat-affected zone.19

The surfaces of samples 1 and 2 have been also characterized with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to analyse their chemical composition and the surface morphology5 (Fig. 3). A larger extent of crystallinity in the type 2 samples is expected from the better resolved shoulders associated with the main signals of Ni 2p3/2 [shoulder at 856 eV, Fig. 3a] and O 1s [shoulder at 531.5 eV, Fig. 3b] in the XPS spectra of RDS.20 The type 1 samples generally display broader peaks in their XPS spectra which indicates a lower degree of crystallinity.20 Differences in the number of electronic defects, e.g. Ni3+ sites, and structural defects like O2− vacancies, on the surface of NiO cannot be ruled out as possible origins of the variations observed in the XPS spectra of CS and RDS samples.21

Electrochemical properties of sintered NiO electrodes
The cyclic voltammograms of the nanoporous NiO coatings prepared with the two different sintering procedures present the characteristic profiles of compact22 and nanostructured sol–gel films15e with two broad reversible oxidation peaks in an aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 4). The direct comparison of the cyclic voltammograms of NiO samples 1 and 2 having the same thickness is provided in Fig. SI4 (ESI†). The current waves are generated by the reversible transformations of Ni(II) into Ni(III) (eqn (1)–(3)) and, possibly, Ni(III) into Ni(IV) (eqn4), and are associated with a succession of the solid-state electrochemical reactions as shown below:23,24 NiOx(OH)n(H2O)p → NiOx(OH)n+1(H2O)p−1 + e− + H+(1)
for oxidation peak I, and NiOx(OH)m → NiOx+1(OH)m−1 + e− + H+(2)
for oxidation peak II, or, alternatively, by the succession of the processes:15e,22b NiOx(OH)m → NiOx+1(OH)m−1 + e− + H+(3)
for oxidation peak I, and NiOx+1(OH)m−1 → NiOx+2(OH)m−2 + e−+H+(4)
for oxidation peak II, depending on the actual extent of hydration of the sintered nickel oxide layers upon contact with the aqueous electrolyte.22

The total charge exchanged reversibly by the different NiO electrodes during the oxidation processes I and II has been calculated by time-integrating the current density profiles of Fig. 4. The corresponding electrochemical parameters for samples 1 and 2 with different thicknesses a–c have been listed in Table 2. For the evaluation of  we have used an averaged thickness value in the case of samples b and c as discussed in the Experimental section. The proportionality between the current density exchanged by the oxide and its thickness reveals the mesoporous nature of the two types of sintered NiO electrodes. This is a direct consequence of the fact that thicker nanoporous samples have a larger electroactive surface area.1a Moreover, it indicates that both CS and RDS methods generate an effective electrical contact between metal oxide nanoparticles, and between the FTO substrate and oxide layer during sintering process. Since NiO oxidation is localised at the surface of the oxide film Jp(I) and Jp(II) being linearly dependent on the scan rate for both samples 1 and 215e (see ESI,† Fig. SI2 and SI3), it is reasonable to assume that the amount of charge exchanged by the coatings is directly correlated with the surface area of the oxide samples within the examined range of thicknesses 0.4 ≤ l ≤ 3.0 μm.7 CS electrodes 1 display lower values of Qexc and  with respect to RDS electrodes having the same thickness (Table 2) as a consequence of the larger voids and higher porosity of the latter films (Fig. 2).

Within the same type of samples the volume density  of the total charge exchanged by the NiO electrode presents the lowest value for the intermediate thickness b, whereas thicknesses a and c have considerably larger and comparable values of  (Table 2). A possible explanation for such an anomalous trend could be because the thicker electrodes b and c, i.e. the samples obtained through multiple spraying passes, are not uniform (see the Experimental section). The area of the sample considered for the calculation of the average thickness of electrodes b and c is based on the scan of a small portion of the samples. For electrodes b with intermediate thickness the variability of the height over the total geometrical area of the electrode may be more pronounced than for samples c. As a consequence of that, the evaluation of the average thickness could have been less well defined for electrodes b than for the thickest layers c.
The sensitisation of NiO electrodes with P1 dye4a,b,6a does not introduce any additional redox process† in the examined range of potential as verified by the comparison of the voltammograms of P1-sensitised NiO and its bare version (Fig. 5). This finding (not shown) is common for all NiO coatings obtained with both RDS and CS sintering procedures. The different shapes of the voltammograms and the shifts of the oxidation peaks are ascribed to the different extent of protonation of the NiO surface in passing from the bare to the sensitised state. The nature of the redox processes observed in P1-sensitised NiO is the same as in the case of bare NiO coatings and involve NiO as the electroactive species (Fig. 4). They illustrate the conversion of Ni2+ to Ni3+ (peaks I and II in Fig. 4), and eventually to Ni4+ (peak II in Fig. 4), in combination with proton exchange between the NiO surface and the electrolyte (eqn (1)–(4)).15e,22a This implies that the actual chemical composition of the oxide surface is better described as a mixture of nickel oxide and nickel hydroxide.15e,22b Since sensitizer anchoring implies the replacement of the surface protons of the oxide with the carboxylic group of P1,25 the extent of NiO surface protonation is altered slightly. This affects the electrochemical behaviour of the sensitized oxide as observed (Fig. 5).

Photoelectrochemical performance of p-DSCs based on sintered NiO samples
The P1-sensitized NiO electrodes were assembled in p-DSCs with the I3−/I− redox shuttle in acetonitrile, and a platinised counter electrode.3c,4a,b The dark J–V characteristic curves of P1-sensitized CS samples 1 and 2 were recorded for the three different thicknesses (Fig. 6). The dark current density of the p-DSCs increased with the thickness of P1-sensitized NiO films and followed the same trend of the current density of bare NiO electrodes in the aqueous electrolyte (Fig. 4). Therefore, sensitisation of mesoporous NiO coating with P1 does not create a blocking layer and the P1 sensitized nanostructures retain their electrochemical reactivity as in the bare state.
 Fig. 6  Dark J–V curves for p-DSCs assembled with NiO samples 1 (dotted line) and 2 (full line) with different thicknesses a–c. 
The J–V characteristic curves obtained under illumination are shown in Fig. 7 and the parameters obtained from these profiles have been listed in Table 3. The direct comparison of the characteristic curves obtained under illumination of NiO samples 1 and 2 having the same thickness is available in the ESI† (Fig. SI5 and SI6). On the basis of the data presented in Table 3 the behaviour of the various samples can be compared and the potential of the application of the CS and RDS deposition methods evaluated. The p-DSCs assembled with the thinnest NiO samples a and b (0.4 ≤ l ≤ 2.0 μm) give the larger open circuit potential VOC and higher overall efficiencies η with respect to the corresponding thicker electrodes c (2.5 ≤ l ≤ 3.0 μm). The overall efficiency increases in going from a to b whereas the short circuit photocurrent JSC always increases with thickness over the whole examined range 0.4 ≤ l ≤ 3.0 μm. In summary, the photocurrent increase observed in going from samples b (1.5–2.0 μm) to c (2.5–3.0 μm) is offset by a decrease in the open circuit photovoltage (Table 3).

These findings are explained considering that the increase in the film thickness increases the surface area of the film. Since more dye can be absorbed, higher photocurrents are observed.26 In addition to that, thicker films expose a larger surface to the electrolyte and, consequently, give more recombination with the redox shuttle.26 Recombination scales linearly with the thickness of mesoporous films whereas light absorption and photo-injection do not follow an analogous trend. The greater recombination in the thickest samples c lowers the Fermi level of illuminated P1-sensitized NiO and lower photovoltages are found for c compared to a and b (Table 3). Further information can be obtained from the transmission spectra of the samples before and after sensitization as shown in Fig. 8 for NiO electrodes 1a–c. The predominant contribution to the absorption of visible light comes from the NiO material itself. For example, at a film thickness of 0.40 μm (sample a) 48% of the light is absorbed by the film itself, and adsorption of P1 only decreases the transmittance by a further 28% at the peak maximum (Fig. 8 and Table 4).
 Fig. 8  Transmission spectra of unsensitised and sensitised NiO samples 1a–c. 
Since the spectrum is practically saturated for sensitised films with 1.5–2.0 μm thickness (sample b), sensitisation brings a little gain in optical density on increasing the film thickness to 2.5–3.0 μm (sample c). Because of that, further increase in the film thickness of sintered samples 1 and 2 does not significantly improve the overall light harvesting efficiency, LHE, defined as 1–10−A, A being the absorbance of the sample (Table 4). It was noted that the photocurrent density, measured at 100 mW cm−2, increased for 2c compared to 2b (Table 4), whereas IPCE, which is measured at a lower light intensity,3c,18a decreased over the visible spectrum with the thickness of sample 2 going from 1.5–2.0 to 2.5–3.0 μm (Table 4). This is not the case for samples 1 (Table 4). The observed behaviour of 2 implies that for these samples higher light intensity, i.e. the condition of a larger number of photons impinging the electrode per time unit during current–voltage measurements, overcomes the shortening of photo-holes lifetime induced by the increase in the thickness in the nanoporous electrode (vide infra). P1-sensitised electrodes 1 and 2 display among the largest values of conversion efficiencies ever reported3d,4,6a,b,27 being IPCE in the order of 40–50% within the spectral interval 400–600 nm (see ESI,† Fig. SI8). To our knowledge only double layered NiO samples prepared from colloids gave a better result with the sensitizer P1 being with IPCE values in the range 45–60% in the same spectral range.4a,6a
When comparing samples 1 and 2, data show that for the thickness range 0.4 ≤ l ≤ 2.0 μm CS coatings produce larger VOC values but lower η values than their type 2 analogues, whereas RDS coatings 2 always display the largest photocurrents (Table 3). The latter observation on photocurrent is consistent with the trends the dark current observed for types 1 and 2 electrodes in both bare and sensitised states (Fig. 6 and SI4, ESI†).
The comparison of the optical spectra of bare NiO films reveals that RDS samples 2 are generally more transparent and less scattering than CS samples 1 within the thickness range 0.4 ≤ l ≤ 2.0 μm (see ESI,† Fig. SI7) by virtue of the lower density of electrodes 2vs. electrodes 1 (Fig. 1 and 2). Since the grain size of NiO particles in sample 2 appears to be smaller (Fig. 1 and 2), this enables a larger loading of sensitizer per unit area and explains why RDS samples 2 have more contribution to light harvesting from the dye than CS samples 1 (Table 4).
The hole lifetimes (τh) of both samples 1 and 2 were dependent on the film thickness (Fig. 9). The comparison of samples 1 and 2 shows that CS samples 1 display the longest hole lifetimes in the order of 0.5–1 s (samples c, Fig. 10), in accordance with the observed trend of VOC (Table 3).
 Fig. 9  Hole lifetimes (τh) as a function of open circuit potential (VOC) for p-DSCs prepared with NiO samples 1 in three different thicknesses a–c. 
 Fig. 10  Hole lifetimes (τh) as a function of the open circuit potential (VOC) for p-DSCs prepared with NiO samples 1–2 with thickness c. 
In fact, the smaller surface area of 1 with respect to 2 (Fig. 2, 4 and 6) brings about a slowest charge recombination in NiO 1.
The τh value for the thickest CS sample 1c is very high and similar to that of the thinnest CS sample 1a (Fig. 9) in contrast to what one would expect if the trend of the open circuit photovoltage is considered (Table 3). This finding is consistent with the idea that in the case of CS sample 1c a fraction of the total surface is actually photoactivated (and eventually in contact with the electrolyte) under the condition of open circuit. When τh values of sintered samples 1 and 2 are compared with those reported for the best performing p-DSCs based on sol–gel NiO photocathodes sensitized with P1, we find that the NiO electrodes prepared with RDS and CS methods have longer hole lifetimes at the same value of open circuit photopotential when the redox couple triiodide–iodide is used (see ESI,† Fig. SI9).4a,6c,27 This implies that the rate of charge transfer between the electrolyte and our NiO samples is generally slower with respect to the mesoporous NiO samples obtained via wet methods.3,4 The slope of τhvs. VOC is less steep in comparison to NiO electrodes with comparable thickness prepared using sol–gel techniques (ESI,† Fig. SI9).4a,5,6c,7,10,27 This is associated with the suppression of charge recombination in sintered samples. A possible cause of this effect is the structural order present in sintered NiO samples (Fig. 3), which derives from the narrow distribution of the diameter in the starting nanoparticles and the low dispersion of the grains size in the resulting sintered films (Fig. 1).
The logarithmic dependence of the hole lifetime with the incident intensity of the light mainly arises from the fact that the hole photo-injection rate follows an exponential law with light intensity.28 The absorption of visible light accomplished with the dye-sensitizer and LHE (vide supra) are correlated and depend on the molar extinction coefficient of the dye as imposed by the exponential law of Lambert–Beer, whereas the hole transfer from the oxide to the excited/oxidized dye is controlled by the electronic coupling between the donor and the acceptor states of the oxide and the dye-molecule, respectively.28 An increase in the incident light intensity brings about an increase in the amount of absorbed photons and creates larger surface concentrations of holes. The latter increases the rate of recombination between surface-localized holes and the reduced form of the redox mediator, the formation of which at the electrode interface is also light-intensity dependent being directly generated by the neutralization of the reduced dye. The recombination hole-reduced redox mediator is a bimolecular event the rate of which depends linearly on the product of the hole surface-concentration by the surface-concentration of the reduced units of the redox shuttle. Both surface-concentrations are light intensity-dependent parameters. In addition to that, the surface-concentrations of the holes and the reduced units of the redox shuttle are also affected by the phenomenon of back diffusion towards the bulk of the mesoporous oxide and of the electrolyte, respectively. Such a transport mechanism is not light intensity-dependent. Back diffusion of holes is generally much faster than the back diffusion of I− and is influenced by the degree of crystallinity of the nanostructures (Fig. 3), and the extent of necking (Fig. 2), which both control the hole diffusion length.1b,28 On the other hand, the back diffusion of I− does not relent considerably the process of hole transfer associated with recombination in NiOx since back diffusion of large ions like I− is much slower than an electron transfer process between a slowly diffusing species and an electrode surface.28 The possible influence of ionic back diffusion on hole lifetime manifests itself more clearly during the irradiation of thickest porous electrodes. In fact, the observed decrease in the hole lifetime vs. the film thickness (samples 1a and 1b, Fig. 9) could be also due to the fact that the time the redox shuttle takes to leave the pores of the electrodes is longer when the electrode is thicker and, consequently, the probability of recombination between the pore-trapped I− and the surface localized holes increases. In addition to that, hole trapping phenomena can play a major role in thicker films with the consequent increase in the hole-recombination rate and decrease in the hole lifetime.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated that NiO electrodes obtained via sintering of preformed NiO nanoparticles can be proficiently used as photoactive electrodes for cathodic p-DSCs. The deposition procedures considered are conventional sintering and microwave plasma assisted sintering, both of them representing scalable procedures. In particular, RDS possesses the important feature of transmitting heat from the bulk of the system towards its outer interfaces (outgoing heating mode) within a confined volume. This has proved to be advantageous for the preparation of nanoporous NiO electrodes having large voids through the entire thickness of the film. As a consequence of that, the efficient sensitisation of the RDS samples could be achieved with positive consequences on the light harvesting properties, dark-/photo-current densities and photo-carrier lifetimes. In operational terms the adoption of RDS reduces drastically the processing times with respect to all the other coating methods traditionally used for the preparation of DSCs electrodes. Overall efficiencies as high as 0.12% and IPCEs of about 50% were obtained with P1-sensitized RDS samples having a thickness 1.5–2.0 μm. The conversion efficiencies of the p-DSCs based on sintered NiO films sensitized with P1 are among the largest ever reported for photoactive NiO cathodes. In all p-DCS devices reported, the photogenerated holes lived significantly longer (τh ∼ 1 s) than has previously been found for P1-sensitised NiO photocathodes in analogous photocell configurations. These important results derive from the suppression of charge recombination and combine with the determination of relatively high photovoltages (up to 135 mV) when the triiodide–iodide redox couple is used.
The photovoltages reported here are relatively high with respect to p-DSCs based on differently deposited nanoporous NiO cathodes with a film thickness in the same range and sensitized either with the same dye4 or with different dyes.3a–c,6a,15f Improvements on the performances of the p-DSC derived from RDS NiO samples are expected due to the wide margins of optimisation of the microwave sintering technique. This will enable further gains of efficiency and photocurrent densities when mesoporous NiO samples with a larger thickness (up to 7–8 μm) will have to be considered.
