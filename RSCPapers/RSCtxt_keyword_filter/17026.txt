    , Accepted 5th August 2019First published on 6th August 2019AbstractThe synthesis and characterisation of [Cu4In(PPh3)3SePh(μ-SePh)3(μ3-SePh)3] (1) is described together with its use as a precursor of CuInSe2. Compound 1 is a kind of single source precursor that has increased thermodynamic stability relative to many other organometallic compounds, and it can be used to generate the CuInSe2 sensitizer. The CuInSe2 generated from 1 was immobilized in TiO2 to give the composite CuInSe2/TiO2 (1a), which behaves as an active and robust photocatalyst for water splitting.
Introduction
There is currently great interest in developing metal chalcogenide supported in TiO2 due to its significant and promising applications in materials science, especially in relation to the production of the so-called “solar fuels” (e.g., hydrogen, methanol, methane, etc.).1–11
The development of main-group-semiconductor clusters has attracted much attention recently due to their diverse structures, atomic compositions, and variety of applications; for example, they are attractive precursors for generating and combining different materials.12,13 The combination of different materials plays an important role, because photoelectron separation is closely associated with the kinetics of the electron-transfer processes at the interface, and can certainly improve the efficiency of these systems.14–17
In this context, copper chalcopyrite CuME2 (in which M = Ga, In; E = S, Se) is among the best absorbers of solar energy.18,19 This class of sensitizer is considered to be a nontoxic alternative to cadmium- or mercury-based semiconductors, due to its high absorption coefficient, good radiation stability, low toxicity, and high photovoltaic efficiency.20–23 A great advantage of this class of materials for photoelectrochemistry (PEC) applications is the band gap tailoring based on composition, with band gaps ranging from 1.0 eV in CuInSe2 to 1.6 eV in CuGaSe, and up to 2.43 eV in CuGaS2.24 The band gap of CuGaSe2 is attractive for PEC applications, and photocurrent densities exceeding 13 mA cm−2 have been observed with this material in biased PEC cells.25
Different methods for obtaining such materials have been reported, including ionothermal synthesis, the sintering method, sputtering selenization, hydrothermal selenization, and chemical vapour deposition (more traditionally).1,12,20,22 In thermolytic generation, chalcogenolates (MER, in which M = metal centre; E = S, Se, Te; and R = alkyl or aryl group) and mixed chalcogenide/chalcogenolate complexes (ME/MER) containing the desired elements (Cu, In, and S/Se) in a single molecule (single source precursor) are used in order to simplify the deposition process of CuInE2 semiconductors, given that these single source precursors already have the M–E bonds.22,23
Hollow chalcopyrite CuInSe2 nanospheres are prepared by colloidal synthesis, for the first time, and assembled inside TiO2 nanotube arrays as a high-performance photocatalyst for hydrogen evolution.26 The synthesis of ultrasmall CuInSe2 quantum dots (QDs) with diameters below the exciton Bohr radius of 10.6 nm was carried out via a solvothermal method. The synthesis is conducted in oleylamine without any organometallic precursors.27 Under one sun of simulated irradiation, the resulting QD-sensitized solar cell based on CdS/CuInSe2 had a power conversion efficiency of about 2.27%, which was 55% higher than that of the single CdS-sensitized solar cell.
The intrinsic NIR-absorbing properties of CuInSe2 and CuInSe2–ZnS alloyed QDs make them more interesting, due to the suppressed charge recombination and concomitantly better photovoltaic performance obtained in the CuInSe2–ZnS QD based and sensitized solar cells.28
The photocatalytic activities of the CuInS2/TiO2 particles prepared via a one-step solvothermal process were evaluated by hydrogen evolution reactions. The activity reached a maximum value at about 273.25 μmol when the CuInS2/TiO2 ratio was 2.5%. The greatly enhanced photocatalytic activity is about seven times higher than that of pure commercial TiO2 (Degussa P25).29
McDaniel et al. showed the great potential of CuInSexS2−x QDs in TiO2 as active materials for creating low-cost, robust, and efficient photovoltaics, as well as a platform for investigating various advanced concepts derived from the unique physics of the nanoscale-size regime.30,31
In order to improve the activity of TiO2 (band gap of 3.2 eV), shifting the absorption to the visible light, near infrared, and infrared regions, various approaches were used to increase the sensitization of TiO2 with semiconductor materials like the ternary chalcopyrite ABC2 (A = Cu, Ag; B = Ga, In; C = S, Se, Te).26 In order to contribute to the progress of this area, we present the synthesis and characterization of the new molecular cluster compound that can be used as a single source precursor for including CuInSe2 as a sensitizer into different materials.
Results and discussion
Based on our previous experience in the synthesis of multi-nuclear cluster compounds,32–34 the goal of this present work was, firstly, the synthesis and characterisation of [Cu4In(PPh3)3SePh(μ-SePh)3(μ3-SePh3)] (1), and to determine its use as a single source compound for the deposition of CuInSe2 in TiO2 (1a). We subsequently described the activity of 1a as a photocatalyst in visible light for hydrogen production by water splitting. Scheme 1 shows the route to obtain 1, followed by the reaction with titanium(IV) isopropoxide in acetic acid to generate 1a.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route for preparing 1 and 1a. 
The molecular structure of compound 1 (see Fig. 1) is composed of a core with three copper atoms and one indium atom connected by six phenylselenolate ligands to form an adamantane skeleton with an extra copper atom (Cu4) located in the middle of the six-membered ring (Cu1, Se6, Cu2, Se7, Cu3, Se5). The indium atom (In1) is connected to the copper atoms by three phenylselenolate ligands, and its tetrahedral coordination geometry is completed by one more phenylselenolate group. The core is stabilized by three triphenylphosphines bonded to each external copper atom.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structure of cluster 1 (hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity). 
The Cu4 atom interacts simultaneously with selenium and copper atoms, in accordance with the inter-atomic distances shown in Table S1 (ESI†). Other cluster compounds with a similar structure have already been described in the literature; for example, the anionic cluster [Cu7In4(SePh)20]− has Cucentral–Se distances between 2.353 and 2.638 Å and Cucentral–Cu distances between 2.274 and 2.284 Å;35 while the [CdCu4(PPh3)4(μ-TePh)3(μ3-TePh)3] cluster has Cucentral–Te distances between 2.601 and 2.690 Å and Cucentral–Cu distances between 2.580 and 2.676 Å.36–39
Density functional theory studies were carried out in order to confirm the existence of interactions between the isolated copper atom (Cu4) and the six-membered ring [Cu3Se3] at the base of 1. The blue semi-sphere centered at the Cu4 atom in Fig. 2 shows the non-directional nature of the natural bond orbital centered at the Cu4 atom. The Wiberg bond index between the Cu4 atom and neighboring Cu atoms is 0.13, while the bond index with the neighboring Se atoms is 0.06, indicating that all six atoms in the hexagonal ring contribute to stabilizing the isolated Cu4 atom.

Compound 1 was used as a single source compound that has increased thermodynamic stability relative to many other organometallic compounds, and it can be used to generate the CuInSe2 sensitizer. The CuInSe2 was immobilized in TiO2 to prepare the CuInSe2/TiO2 composite (1a), which behaves as an active and robust photocatalyst for water splitting.
As shown in Fig. 3, the sample of 1a is composed of a large number of nanograins ranging from 5 to 10 nm, which are inserted into the TiO2. A HRTEM image of the nanograins showed a similar morphology, which is typical for two-dimensional InSe/CuInSe2 nanosheets with interplanar distances of 0.34 nm.36 The probable formation is based on the decomposition of compound 1. Analysis of the core lattice fringes indicated a lattice spacing in the vicinity of 0.34 nm, which is close to that of the (100) plane for wurtzite CuInSe2.38
 Fig. 3  HRTEM image of 1a showing an interplanar distance of 0.34–0.35 nm. 
The nanomaterial identified by HRTEM in Fig. 3 is nearly composed of CuInSe2, as measured by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX)—see Fig. S8 (ESI†). The EDX spectrum exhibits the characteristic peaks of Cu, In, Se, Ti, and O corresponding to CuInSe2/TiO2. This result agrees with the XRD analysis (Fig. 4a), which shows that, after chemical treatment of cluster 1 (which was initially amorphous), a new material (composite 1a) was formed.
 Fig. 4  (a) XRD pattern for cluster 1 and composite 1a; (b) diffuse reflectance spectra of Np TiO2, cluster 1, and composite 1a; and (c) photoluminescence spectra of cluster 1 and composite 1a. 

Fig. 4b shows the diffuse reflectance spectroscopy results of the synthesized samples cluster 1 and composite 1a in regards to TiO2. It could be seen that cluster 1 had significant absorption in the region of the visible spectrum around 500 nm. A red-shift was observed after the chemical treatment of CuInSe2/TiO2 (composite 1a), and through the Tauc equation it was possible to estimate the optical band gap of the studied materials.
The Tauc plot showed a steep absorption edge. The Eg value was obtained by extrapolating the steep absorption edge to the intersection with the energy axis.20 As a result, a value of 2.00 eV was obtained for the optical band gap of composite 1a. This Eg value is close to the band gap energy described for the direct semiconductor materials CuGaS2 and CuInSe2 (range of 2.50–1.03 eV, depending on composition and nanomaterial size).39,40

Fig. 4c shows the photoluminescence spectra for cluster 1 and composite 1a. Both curves show similar behaviour with two well defined peaks. The main difference occurred in the region of 680 nm, where a significant increase in emission is evident. Such an event shows the formation of composite 1a (CuInSe2/TiO2), given that CuInSe2 is emitted in the region of 745 nm.41
It is well known that the substrate (TiO2) can displace and broaden the emission band of the compound; thus, it can be stated that the band at 680 nm corresponds to composite 1a; whereas the peak at 745 nm corresponds to the residual CuInSe2.42 This result confirms the formation of CuInSe2/TiO2 (composite 1a), which has great potential for use as a photocatalyst in the water splitting single catalyst.
The hydrogen photogeneration results (Fig. 5) confirmed the excellent performance of composite 1a compared to the TiO2 nanoparticles (see Fig. 5a). For its part, the precursor cluster 1 did not furnish good efficiency results.
 Fig. 5  Hydrogen evolution using the following: (a) TiO2 NPs, cluster 1 and composite 1a in a water/triethanolamine solution (1:1/4); (b) filter cut on 400, filter UV band pass, and UV and visible irradiation for the sample; and (c) hydrogen generation with composite 1a in a water/triethanolamine solution (1:1/4) under UV-vis irradiation, for five successive cycles of 5 h. 
As shown in Fig. 1, cluster 1 has a series of bonds that can act as a trap for the free electrons, which allows recombination. Additionally, the material behaved amorphously, as Fig. 4a shows, which contributed to reducing the efficiency of the system. However, deposition of TiO2 in the next step enabled a chemical interaction between CuInSe2 and TiO2 without the presence of an organic binder. Such a system facilitates the transport of charge between the semiconductors, in part due to the crystallinity of the material, which is essential for efficient modulation of the heterojunction type. Obtaining the composite also avoids problems common to physical adsorption steps; for example, leaching of the particles and agglomeration of CuInSe2 nanoparticles in the pores. These characteristics promote the excellent stability observed in the system.

Fig. 5b shows the performance of composite 1a under different types of radiation. Hydrogen production with visible radiation is practically non-existent. As is well known, the QDs suffer photocorrosion; therefore, under visible radiation, there is no contribution of TiO2, which leaves the CuInSe2 susceptible to this type of problem. However, in the presence of only UV radiation, the contribution is exclusively from TiO2; whereas under radiation similar to the solar spectrum, a synergetic effect between CuInSe2 and TiO2 occurs, which reduces the recombination process and allows the absorption of photons from the visible region, thus causing an increase in hydrogen production.
The results obtained in Fig. 5c show that the material has exceptional stability, even when subjected to several cycles of irradiation; thus proving that the synergistic effect significantly reduces photocorrosion problems.
Conclusions
In this work we prepared compound 1 and explored its use as a single source precursor for immobilizing the CuInSe2 in TiO2 (composite 1a). Composite 1a behaves as an active and robust photocatalyst for water splitting—it can generate hydrogen at a good yield, and has good stability for recycling under the tested conditions.
The use of main-group-semiconductor clusters as single source compounds to insert sensitizers in photocatalysts is not yet common.6 Cluster compounds have an atomically precise composition and well-defined crystallographic structures, and we believe that they play an important role in the exploration of this new class of photocatalysts, which have a bright future. The use of clusters of varying reactivity and compositions is also the route for the methodological development of new high-performance photocatalysts that have not yet been explored.
Experimental
Preparation and tools
General information about minor synthetic procedures used in this work are available in the ESI.† Elemental analysis (CHN) of 1 was conducted with a PerkinElmer 2400 analyser. The infrared spectrum of 1 was obtained using a Bruker Tensor 27 mid-IR spectrometer over the range 4000–400 cm−1. The melting point of 1 was determined on a Microquímica MQAPF-301 melting point apparatus, and it was reported uncorrected. The diffuse reflectance spectrum of 1 was measured using a UV-vis 1650-PC Shimadzu spectrometer—fitted with a diffuse reflectance accessory—over the UV-vis wavelength range of 200–800 nm. The band gap energy (Eg) of 1 was estimated following the methodology described by Lang et al.33,43 Data for the X-ray structure determination of 1 were collected with a Bruker APEX II CCD diffractometer operated using a graphite monochromator and Mo-Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å); see Table S3 (ESI†). The molecular crystal structure of 1 was solved by direct methods implemented in SHELXS,44 and the final structure was refined with SHELXL,44 using anisotropic displacement parameters for all non-hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen atoms were placed in ideal positions and refined as riding atoms with relative isotropic displacement parameters. Transmission electron microscopy images were obtained using an FEI TECNAI 20 operating at 200 kV and coupled to an electron probe energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS) for surface mapping. For this analysis, the sample was firstly dispersed in ethanol, and a thin film of this suspension was then deposited on a copper grid and covered with carbon.

Preparation of [Cu4In(PPh3)3SePh(μ-SePh)3(μ3-SePh3)] (1). 
In a test tube, 0.087 g (0.15 mmol) of In(SePh)3 and 0.072 g (0.20 mmol) of Cu(PPh3)Cl was suspended in 8 mL of methanol. The test tube was placed in a stainless steel reactor (Fig. S6, ESI†) and the reactor was then closed. The system was heated in an Oxylab OXY-E-1 oven—equipped with a NOVUS N1200 temperature controller—in accordance with the parameters described in Table S2 (ESI†). When the oven temperature returned to lower than 30 °C, the reactor was opened and the yellow solution was transferred to a vessel. The remaining golden crystals (blocks) were washed with methanol and dried under vacuum. Yield: 60% (0.068 g; 0.03 mmol), based on In(SePh)3. Properties: air stable, golden crystalline solid. Calcd for C96H80Cu4InP3Se7 (2248.21): C, 51.28; H, 3.59. Found: C, 51.11; H, 3.37. Melting point: 174–177 °C. IR (KBr): 3050 [ν(C–H)Ar]; 1575, 1476 and 1434 [ν(CC)]; 1023 [δip(CC–H)]; 737 and 693 [δop(CC–H)]. Crystal data and further details of the data collection and refinement are shown in Table S3 (ESI†). The molecular structure of 1 in 50% probability ellipsoids is shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†).


Preparation of CuInSe2/TiO2 (1a). 
Composite 1a was prepared by adapting the methodology described by Wu and Chen.45 In a 5 mL flask, (i-PrO)4Ti (1 mmol) and CH3COOH (4 mmol) were stirred under ambient atmosphere (solution A). In a second flask identical to the first, cluster 1 (0.05 mmol) was suspended in isopropanol (4 mmol), and CHCl3 was added until total solubilisation of 1 (solution B). At this point, solution B was added to solution A and the system was kept under stirring and ambient atmosphere for 24 h. The system was then heated (160 °C) until elimination of all solvents. The yellow solid obtained was pulverized manually and characterized as 1a by HRTEM and EDX.

Measurements of H2 production via gas chromatography (GC)
All chemical reagents used for photocatalytic reaction testing were of analytical grade and were used without further purification. The photocatalytic activity for hydrogen production occurred in a double-walled quartz photochemical reactor—the water circulated through this and acted as the IR filter to control the temperature of the solution (23 °C) during the photocatalytic experiments.
Samples with 9 mg of 1a were dispersed in 9 mL of a H2O:triethanolamine (1:1/4) solution with pH 10, which was then introduced into the reactor. Triethanolamine was used as the sacrificial reagent. Prior to irradiation, the system was deaerated by the bubbling of Ar gas and drained for about 45 min to remove the air from the reactor.
A 300 W high-pressure Xe arc lamp (ScienTech Inc.) was used as the light source for the photolyses. The irradiance on the reactor was 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun), which was measured using a standard solar cell at the same working distance. Hydrogen gas evolution was monitored by collecting 500 μL aliquots of the gas using a Hamilton syringe with a valve (model 1005SL Sample Lock Syringe) that was connected through a rubber septum in the lid of the reactor. The measurements were obtained at intervals of 30 min for 5 h under continuous magnetic stirring. Multiple sample aliquots were taken at each time period to ensure precision. The hydrogen gas produced was monitored using an Agilent GC chromatograph with 30 m HP-PLOT/Q columns and a 30 m HP-MOLESIEVE at room temperature. The gases generated were analysed simultaneously with a thermal conductivity detector. Calibration curves were found to be linear over a wide range of H2 concentrations.
Computational details
Density functional theory calculations were performed using the hybrid B3LYP exchange and correlation functional, and the CEP-31G split-valence effective core potential basis set.46 The geometrical structures were optimized, and an analysis of the infrared vibrational spectrum showed all real frequencies. All calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 code.47
