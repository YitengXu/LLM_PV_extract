    , Accepted 28th May 2021First published on 31st May 2021AbstractA double layer distribution can be observed in Cu2SnZnSe4 (CZTSe) thin films prepared via the selenization of metallic precursors. The double layer structure may cause the back contact of Mo substrates with absorber layers to degrade, thereby suppressing the performance of solar cells. Hence, to eliminate the problematic structure, we reduced the loss of SnSex during the selenization of precursors by modifying the laminated structures of the precursors formed by the deposition of CuxSe and ZnxSn1−x. In addition, the effects of different laminated structures on the thin-film properties of CZTSe were studied through X-ray diffraction analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. The results demonstrate that the changes in the laminated structures help in reducing the loss of SnSex and in promoting the reactions between ZnSe and Cu–Sn–Se. As a result, the drawbacks of CZTSe thin films, such as the double layer distribution and existence of air holes, can be addressed. Furthermore, changes in the crystal structures are also noted. Photoluminescence results reveal that signals indicative of ZnSe-related defects were weakened and the band-tail effects became insignificant. Moreover, the internal resistance and quality of the interface in CZTSe solar cells were investigated through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results prove that the improvement of the double-layer distribution of absorber layers leads to high photoelectric conversion efficiency. Therefore, we modified the laminated structures of precursors to eliminate the distribution of absorber layers, which considerably improved the photoelectric conversion efficiency (from 2.9% to 5.67%).
Introduction
Photovoltaic devices for fossil fuel-free energy are inherently sustainable, unless they are too expensive to produce, raw materials are depletable, or they are environmentally unsafe. In recent years, thin-film solar cell technologies based on CdTe and polycrystalline CuIn1−xGaxSe2 (CIGS) absorber materials have achieved record-breaking efficiencies of 20% and 22.9%, respectively, for laboratory-scale devices and have already reached the commercial production stage.1,2 However, these thin-film photovoltaic technologies suffer from serious drawbacks such as toxicity, high material costs, and low availability of raw materials. These disadvantages are predicted to severely limit the production, mass deployment, and economic sustainability of these solar cells. Thus, intensive research efforts have been triggered to develop alternative thin-film solar absorber materials composed of abundant, low-cost, and non-toxic elements that can yield high-efficiency devices and will be economically competitive with conventional energy sources in the near future. Meanwhile, CZTSe, as a new-generation material, has received much attention. Because of its high absorption coefficient (approx. 104 to 105 cm−1), it can be converted into a p-type material by adjusting the elemental ratio. In addition, the raw materials needed for the CZTSe absorber layers are more abundant and cheaper, compared to those needed for CIGS. At present, the highest efficiency of CZTSSe is 12.6%, which is obtained through hydrazine-based liquid processes performed by IBM.3 However, hydrazine is toxic and explosive, and it requires expensive equipment. As a result, the yield is limited. In recent years, satisfactory efficiencies have been obtained for CZTSe thin-film solar cells prepared in a vacuum. The solar cells made using co-evaporation have an efficiency of 11.6% while those produced through sputtering followed by selenization have an efficiency of 11.4%.4,5 These values are the highest efficiencies obtained via preparation in a vacuum. In particular, sputtering, followed by selenization, has attracted the most attention. This method can produce large, even, and smooth thin films, and it allows rapid mass production. Nevertheless, the development of CZTSe still significantly lags behind that of CIGSe. This is mainly due to the huge difference in their open-circuit voltages (Voc). The Voc of CZTSe cannot reach the expected value because of various factors, such as defects, absorber crystallization, and the homogeneous composition. Among these factors, the quality of the absorber layers and the back contact have great impact on CZTSe solar cells. It is generally found that the absorber layer shows the double layer distribution as it is prepared by selenization of metallic precursors. Large grains are noted in the upper layers of the thin films while small grains are present in the lower layers.6–8 The small grains give rise to more grain boundaries, which create leakage paths when photogenerated electrons flow to the back contacts. As a result, the solar cell efficiency is lowered. In order to address the double layer distribution of CZTSe thin films, Zhang et al. and Yao et al. attempted to mix Se and SnSex gases.9,10 In particular, Yao et al. improved the double layer distribution by accurately controlling the Se vapour pressure. Unfortunately, all these methods have various shortcomings. For example, it is difficult to control the SnSe pressure; thus, SnSex phases will be easily formed on the surface. These have to be removed through etching. In the meantime, accurate control of the Se vapour pressure leads to cumbersome preparation processes and high technical costs. Hence, we attempted to reduce the loss of SnSex. In addition, this paper proposed the combined use of sputtering as well as CuxSe and ZnxSn1−x targets to form precursors with different laminated structures through deposition. This is followed by selenization, which is aimed at improving the double layer distribution. First of all, precursor thin films were formed via deposition using CuxSe and ZnxSn1−x targets. These two targets were selected because the use of CuxSe and ZnxSn1−x alloy stacking layers allows CuxSe to enhance the growth of CZTSe grains,11 while ZnxSn1−x alloy solves the problem of self-assembled Zn and Sn metal clusters and promotes the compositional homogeneity of CZTSe thin films.12 The precursor formed also contains selenium and is able to enhance the quality of selenization outcomes.13 Moreover, from research wherein CuxSe and ZnxSn1−x targets were utilized in depositing and preparing precursors, it was revealed that, after deposition and formation of CuxSe/ZnxSn1−x thin films, CTSe phases were generated first in the interlayers.14 This leads to several advantages as illustrated below. For example, during the selenization of precursors, binary phases are first formed and, subsequently, they directly react with each other to form CZTSe.6–8 When the temperature exceeds 350 °C during selenization, compounds in the form of SnSex start to undergo re-evaporation.15 The resulting thin films have non-homogeneous compositions, and the double layer distribution exists. Comparatively speaking, CTSe compounds do not re-evaporate easily. Thus, it can reduce the amount of SnSex compounds that are re-evaporated during selenization. Furthermore, CTSe phases give rise to larger grains. In addition to employing the aforementioned methods to improve precursor thin films, we also attempted to address the loss of SnSex by modifying the laminated structures of the precursors. The double layer structures of CZTSe thin films were improved according to the compositions, microstructures, and optical properties of the thin films. The differences are reflected by those in the efficiencies of the CZTSe thin-film solar cells. The efficiencies range from 2.9% to 5.67%.
Experimental
In our study, CZTSe thin films were formed via sputtering followed by selenization. First, at room temperature, 1 μm of molybdenum (Mo) was coated on a glass substrate of 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 using a sputtering machine. After that, ZnxSn1−x and CuxSe targets were employed to prepare their precursors separately. Argon gas (Ar) was used. The preparation was conducted at a pressure of 0.5 mTorr and RF powers of 100 W and 200 W. There were two precursor structures: CuxSe (250 nm)/ZnxSn1−x (600 nm) and CuxSe (125 nm)/ZnxSn1−x (600 nm)/CuxSe (125 nm). Following deposition, the precursor films were placed in quartz boxes (which were closed) with 700 mg of solid Se (99.999% purity). Subsequently, they were put into high-temperature furnace tubes. After Ar gas was introduced into the tubes, two-stage selenization was conducted. The highest temperature was 550 °C. All samples were taken out after natural cooling. The samples of precursors CuxSe/ZnxSn1−x and CuxSe/ZnxSn1−x/CuxSe were labelled as double layer (D) and single layer (S), respectively. After which, chemical bath deposition (CBD) was conducted to prepare a CdS layer of 50 nm while sputtering was employed to synthesize an i-ZnO layer of 50 nm and an AZO layer of 300 nm. After the solar cell was synthesized, sputtering was conducted again to deposit a Ni layer of 50 nm and an Al layer of 1 μm as the front contact.
The device was then characterized using current–voltage (I–V) measurements and external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements while the as-deposited CZTSe thin films were characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), Raman spectroscopy, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), and photoluminescence (PL) analysis. The foregoing processes aim to investigate the structural, optical, and electrical properties of the CZTSe thin films and CZTSe thin-film solar cells. The active area of the device is 0.28 cm2 (excluding the front grids). XRD analysis was conducted using a SIEMENS D500 X-ray diffractometer with CuKα (1.5418 Å) radiation. The diffracted beam scanned with a step of 0.1°, an angular θ–2θ range of 10° to 80°, and an integration time of 1 s. The produced CZTSe film has also been characterized via micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature by using an Ar laser (514 nm) and a triple monochromator (Horiba Jobin-Yvon Triax) combined with a TE-cooled CCD detector. For photoluminescence (PL) measurements, the excitation source used was a 635 nm-line semiconductor laser (PicoQuant LDH-D-C-635M dual mode laser, 30 mW) under continuous-wave (CW) excitation. The signal was dispersed using a 0.5 m-monochromator with a 600-groove mm−1 grating (Jobin Yvon iHR) and detected using an infrared-photo multiplier (HAMAMATSU H10330A-75). EQE spectra were acquired by using a 300 W-xenon lamp (Newport 66984) light source and a monochromator (Newport 74112). The beam spot size projected on the sample was approximately 1 mm × 3 mm. The temperature was controlled at 25 ± 1 °C during measurements.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) and (b) show the SEM cross-sections of samples D and S while Table 1 shows the atomic percentages of the different laminated structures measured via EDS. It is noteworthy that there are significant changes in the atomic percentages of Zn and Sn atoms. The atomic percentage of Zn decreased from 15.5% to 13.41%, a change of approximately 13.48%. However, the atomic percentage of Sn increased from 10.52% to 12.08%, a change of approximately 14.83%. In contrast, Se and Cu only changed slightly. We deduced that, during selenization, when the temperature is higher than 350 °C, SnSex undergoes re-evaporation. This leads to loss of Sn atoms. Meanwhile, the laminated structure of the precursor of sample S can reduce the number of Sn atoms lost unlike that of sample D. In addition, as the temperature increases, all the samples were placed in Se vapour. Hence, this provided sufficient Se atoms for the reduction of Se loss caused by the re-evaporation of SnSex. According to research reports, with regard to the atomic ratio of the CZTSe absorber layer, when the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio is approximately 0.8 to 0.9 and the Zn/Sn ratio is approximately 1.1 to 1.3, high-efficiency solar cells can be obtained.16 In this study, the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratios of sample D and sample S were 0.88 and 0.9, respectively, both within the aforementioned range. However, the Zn/Sn ratios of sample D and sample S were 1.47 and 1.11, respectively. Only that of sample S is within the preferred range. According to previous studies, the Zn/Sn ratio will affect the formation of defects and defect clusters in CZTSe films. After exceeding the threshold value of the Zn/Sn ratio, all excess Zn will exist in the form of ZnSe phase. Therefore, it suggested that sample D has a high probability of producing the ZnSe phase. Based on the cross-sections studied, all CZTSe thin films have an identical thickness of 1.5 μm. For sample D, the CZTSe thin film showed an obvious double layer distribution. The upper layer consisted of large and dense grains whereas the lower layer was made up of small and scattered grains and pores. Contrary to the foregoing, the CZTSe thin film made up of sample S had no obvious issues such as double layers and pores. According to the literature, lamination is mainly due to non-homogeneous compositions, and the small and scattered grains are mostly Zn-rich phases.9,10 This reveals insufficient reactions of the phases in the interface regions.10 The smaller grains lead to more grain boundaries which can provide a leakage pathway by having photo-generated electrons flow toward the back contact, thereby lowering the efficiency of the device. In addition, there were many pores in the absorber layers. The literature suggests that this is attributed to the loss of SnSex.17 This argument is consistent with the EDS results. When the thin films with more pores are used for device production, the leakage current will increase, and the efficiency will drop. Furthermore, the insets in the cross-sections show the top-view SEM images of the samples. We discovered that, compared to sample S, sample D had relatively more pores on the thin film surface. Fig. 1(c) and (d) show the SIMS measurements for samples D and S, respectively. The elemental compositions of the thin films along their depth were analysed. The results of the CZTSe thin film made up of sample D are shown in Fig. 1(c), wherein the normalized intensities of Cu, Zn, Sn, and Mo have been plotted as a function of depth. In Fig. 1(c), three regions can be noted in the SIMS spectrum. Before 500 nm, the intensity of Zn is lower. Between approximately 500 nm and 1400 nm, there is a Zn-rich zone with a higher Zn intensity. After 1400 nm, Mo dominates. Fig. 1(d) illustrates the results of the CZTSe thin film prepared using sample S. The distributions of all elements of sample S are more even, compared to those of sample D.

Fig. 2(a) shows the normalized XRD spectra for samples D and S. We observed that all substrates show distinct (112), (220), and (312) diffraction peaks of CZTSe thin films, and that no additional peaks indicated other phases. To better understand the preferred directions of crystal growth in thin films, several indicators were proposed and computed. R1 is defined as the ratio of the intensity of the (112) peak to the sum of the intensities of all peaks in the XRD image (eqn (1)). Similarly, R2 is the ratio of the intensity of the (220) peak to the sum of those of all peaks (eqn (2)). The R1 values for samples D and S were 0.69 and 0.66, respectively. The corresponding R2 values were 0.21 and 0.23, respectively. In the CIGS structures, a higher R1 value indicates that there are more crystals growing in the (112) direction. In the meantime, a higher R2 value indicates that the (220) direction is more preferred than the (112) direction and that there are non-radiative recombination centres of lower density,18 open structures,19 and relatively inactive grain boundaries.20 CZTSe possesses the properties of CIGS. Therefore, when the (220) direction becomes the more preferred direction of crystal growth in CZTSe, the CZTSe thin films will exhibit more satisfactory photoelectric performances.21,22 (1) (2)

Since the XRD peaks of the second phases and CZTSe (112) were close to each other, it was difficult to distinguish one from the other. The samples were, therefore, subjected to Raman spectroscopy.10Fig. 2(b) shows the normalized Raman spectra for the CZTSe thin films prepared using samples D and S in mode A1. There are three distinct signals located at approximately 171 cm−1, 192 cm−1, and 231 cm−1 in the spectra. They are all indicative of CZTSe.23–25 There were no other distinct signals that suggested multiple phases. Fig. 2(c) shows the normalized PL spectra for the CZTSe thin films made up of samples D and S at 10 K. There were two PL emission peaks observed. One of them was located at about 0.9 eV to 1.0 eV while the other one was at approximately 1.2 eV. The PL emission peak at around 0.9 eV to 1.0 eV is due to the band-to-band transition of CZTSe.26 In this region, the full width at half maximum of sample D was greater than that of S, suggesting the relatively poor quality of the CZTSe thin film made up of sample D. In addition, careful examination of the low-energy regions reveals that sample D has more significant band-tail effects than sample S. This is because band gaps and electrostatic fluctuations trigger the formation of tail states in the band gaps.27 Meanwhile, electrostatic fluctuations are probably caused by the non-homogeneous compositions of absorber materials. If the difference exceeds the stoichiometric limit, charged point defects or secondary phases may manifest. This, in turn, causes band-gap and band-edge fluctuations.28 As described in current literature, the most probable cause of band tails is believed to be the disorder of atoms on the Cu–Zn planes.29 The formation of band tails significantly increases the possibility of non-radiative recombination induced by defects and, thus, causes large Voc deficits in the CZTSe solar cells.30–32 In addition, the broad PL emission peak at 1.2 eV can be attributed to the luminescence caused by ZnSe-related defects.33 In Fig. 2(d), schematic diagrams of reactions in samples D and S are shown. When the selenization temperature is higher than 350 °C, re-evaporation of SnSex takes place. The laminated structure of the precursor of sample S is able to enhance the probability of Cu–Sn–Se formation more efficiently, as compared to that of D. The probability of SnSex re-evaporation is lowered and the number of Sn atoms lost is reduced. Therefore, sample S has a lower chance of having a double layer distribution and air holes caused by non-homogeneous elemental compositions, as compared to sample D.

Fig. 3(a)–(f) show the characteristics of CZTSe solar cells made of the absorber layers of samples D and S. To clearly understand the actual impacts of samples D and S on solar cells, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to measure the changes in the interface characteristics of these two structures. Fig. 3(a) shows the Nyquist plots obtained via EIS in a dark environment for these samples. The illustration in Fig. 3(a) shows the equivalent electric circuit model used in this analysis, indicating that the chemical composition and shape around the CdS/CZTSe interface was non-uniform. This circuit model was made of a resistor (R), a constant phase element (CPE), and a recombination resistance (Rrec). The EIS measurement results were fitted using this circuit model. The Nyquist curve fitting results are presented in Table 2. As seen in this table, R was related to contact and material resistances, such as the Mo contact, ZnO:Al front window, and Ag:Mo contact grid. CPE can be defined as CPE-T and CPE-P, which are related to interface capacitors and ideal capacitors, respectively. The capacitors and resistors in parallel corresponding to the low- and high-frequency sides of the Nyquist plots describe the CdS/CZTSe heterojunction in the AC response. Because the contact electrodes used in this study were all made up of the same materials and with the same parameters, no obvious difference was observed in the R value. However, Rrec is the recombination resistance, which is inversely proportional to the charge recombination rate of the device. The values of Rrec around the CdS/CZTSe interface in the CZTS solar cells made of the absorber layers of samples D and S were 16313 and 90672 Ω cm2, respectively. The Rrec value of sample D was 17.99% of sample S. CPE indicates the state of the CdS/CZTSe interface, while the CPE values of samples D and S were almost the same. As the CdS layers used in this study were prepared under the same conditions and with the same parameters, the influence of Rrec was mainly due to the influence of the characteristics of the CZTSe absorber layers. According to the literature results, in the CZTSe layers, if leakage current paths were generated in the CZTSe cells, Rrec in the CZTSe solar cells was considered to be lower than that expected from the leakage current paths.34 As sample D had ZnSe-related defects, lamination, and air holes, its Rrec value was low.

Furthermore, the EIS measurement results were validated. In Fig. 3(c), the measured dark current (Idark) is plotted against the voltage to give the IV curves of CZTSe solar cells, in which CZTSe thin films made up of samples D and S are used as the absorber layers at room temperature. The dark current and voltage measurements are summarized in Table 3.

It is worth noting that two regions can be identified for all IV curves in Fig. 3(c) according to the current behaviour caused by offset voltages. Region I spans from reverse bias to forward bias below 0.3 V, where the current exhibits a space-charge-limited behaviour originating from the shunt leakage current. Region II starts from forward bias above 0.3 V, where a high forward bias voltage was applied and a diode current was obtained. In region I, the CZTSe solar cell prepared using sample S shows a lower parallel leakage current. This is probably because of the small grains and ZnSe-related defects in the laminated absorber layers. In addition, the air voids formed in the CZTSe absorber layer can lead to discontinued deposition of the CdS buffer layer on the CZTSe surface, resulting in the formation of shunt leakage paths and, thus, shunt leakage currents. Furthermore, smaller grains also provide leakage paths and, hence, reduce the efficiency of the device, which is supported by the EIS measurement results. In region II, sample S exhibits a lower series resistance (Rs). This is possibly because the CZTSe thin film made up of sample S has a lower point defect concentration. There is a higher concentration of nonradiative recombination centres which resulted from the loss of SnSex and ZnSe-related defects, as compared to that of sample D. The junction rectifying character, which can be expressed as the ratio of the value of dark current at 0.3 V to the value of dark current at −0.3 V, measures the excess forward current flowing through recombination states and hopping paths.
The junction rectifying characteristics demonstrate that the device made up of sample S has better rectification performance than the one made up of sample D. According to the SEM, EDS, and PL observations, the higher Rs and leakage current of the device made up of sample D are due to air holes and high defect concentrations. The properties of the CZTSe solar cells composed of CZTSe thin films made up of samples D and S were analysed by conducting IV and EQE measurements. Fig. 3(d) shows the current density (J) versus voltage curves of all solar cells at 25 °C under the AM1.5G solar spectrum. The parameters of the solar cells thereby obtained are summarized in Table 4. In the meantime, Fig. 3(e) shows the average conversion efficiencies of the CZTSe solar cells made up of samples D and S. The average conversion efficiency was obtained by selecting 24 solar cells from each substrate and taking the average of their efficiencies. The efficiency of the CZTSe solar cell used as the benchmark in this study was 2.9%, which is similar to the conversion efficiency reported in many studies.35–43 It differs with the variations in the rectification properties of solar cells. The lower Voc and short-circuit current density (Jsc) values are attributed to the reduction in the junction rectification ratio. The Voc values can be calculated using the diode equation where I0 is the saturation current density, q is the electronic charge, IL is the light-generated current density, T is the temperature, and k is Boltzmann's constant. (3)According to eqn (3), low I0 and high IL values result in a higher Voc. The low Voc values of the CZTSe solar cells prepared using sample D resulted in a higher shunt leakage current, as inferred by the comparison of reverse currents, as shown in Fig. 3(b). In addition, with regard to the CZTSe thin films made up of samples D and S, band tails also affect Voc. This is due to the formation of tail states inside the band gaps, which is mainly caused by band gaps and electrostatic fluctuations. The electrostatic fluctuations are possibly caused by the non-homogeneous compositions of absorber materials. If the difference exceeds the stoichiometric limit, charged point defects or secondary phases can be formed. They are responsible for fluctuations in the band gaps and at the band edges. The formation of band tails can easily increase the probability of non-radiative recombination induced by defects, thereby causing a large Voc deficit in CZTSe solar cells.30–32 In this study, the CZTSe absorber layer produced using sample S exhibits no obvious ZnSe-related defects, lamination, and air holes. This absorber layer was then used to prepare a CZTSe solar cell. This resulted in a more satisfactory efficiency, which is 95.52% higher, compared to that of the solar cell made up of sample D. The efficiency of the solar cell is 5.67%, with a Voc and Jsc of 0.31 V and 35.68 mA cm−2, respectively. The fill factor is 51%. In Fig. 3(f), the EQE results of solar cells made up of the CZTSe absorber layers prepared using samples D and S are illustrated. The most optimal EQE values are noted for the solar cell made up of sample S over the entire spectrum. In the energy-gap range between 2.58 eV and 1.18 eV, the EQE values are approximately between 70% and 95%. At 3.35 eV, 2.58 eV, and 0.95 eV, there are distinct absorbing boundaries. They indicate the absorption by the boundaries of AZO, CdS, and CZTSe, respectively. Moreover, the energy gaps above 1.12 eV were sharply reduced. This is due to incomplete carrier collection. The decrease in the carrier collection can be attributed to a shorter minority carrier diffusion length and a narrow space charge region. This results from the high defect density of the CZTSe absorber layers, which can be caused by the ZnSe-related defects as well as air holes. This also indicates the superior quality of the CZTSe absorber layer made of sample S.

Conclusions
In this study, CZTSe solar cells were made through the sputtering of precursors deposited using CuxSe and ZnxSn1−x targets and subsequent selenization using mixed Se/Ar gas. By modifying the laminated structures of precursors, we attempted to address issues such as the double layer distribution and air hole existence in the CZTSe absorber layers. Because there is a higher chance for precursors to form CZTSe compounds first, the loss of precursors in the form of SnSex compounds during selenization can be reduced. At the same time, the reactions between ZnSe and Cu–Sn–Se can be enhanced, thereby promoting growth in the CZTSe grains. The quality of the resulting grains is, therefore, considerably enhanced. In this study, we proposed a simple method to address the double layer distribution problem of CZTSe thin films obtained through two-stage preparation. The findings can provide a new direction in the development of highly efficient thin-film solar cells.
