    , Accepted 5th March 2013First published on 5th March 2013AbstractSolution-processed star-shaped triphenylamine (TPA) derivatives and dialkylated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based small molecules have been widely studied because they both yield promising photon-to-electron conversion. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of covalent star-shaped TPA-DPP derivatives is still very low. To design star-shaped TPA-DPP derivatives with better photovoltaic performance, we embedded a thiophene ring in between the TPA and DPP units, namely TPA-T-DPP, and reported the comparative studies of the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP. Benefiting from the covalent thiophene bridges, compared to the TPA-DPP solid film, the TPA-T-DPP film showed enhanced light-harvesting ability, for instance, an improved absorptivity (Abs. = 1.72/100 nm vs. 1.23/100 nm), a broader absorption band (131 nm vs. 107 nm) and a narrower band gap (1.86 eV vs. 1.91 eV), from cyclic voltammetry. Studies on the photovoltaic properties revealed that the best TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM based device showed a dramatically enhanced PCE of 2.95%, increased by 2.14 times with respect to the efficiency of the best TPA-DPP based device (1.38%). The improvement of PCE also was observed in the small molecule:PC61BM based devices (1.81% vs. 1.13%). Test of the hole mobilites of the active layer provided further insight into the impact of the embedded thiophene units. The hole mobility of the TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM blended films was higher by about one order of magnitude (1.16 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1) than that of the TPA-DPP:PC71BM blended films (3.85 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). These results clearly indicated that embedding the thiophene ring enlarged the conjugation, thus enhanced the light-harvesting ability and hole mobility, while further significantly improving the device performance. Additionally, TPA-T-DPP was also used as the electron-acceptor material, and the best P3HT:TPA-T-DPP based device exhibited a very high open-circuit voltage (1.14 V), which was among the highest values reported for single-layered OSC devices.
Introduction
In the 21st century, scientists are actively finding and exploiting clean and renewable energy to address the energy crisis.1,2 In this respect, organic solar cells (OSCs), especially the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) OSCs, have recently attracted much attention due to their predominant advantages such as low cost, light weight, and the compatibility with flexible substrates.3–7 The active-layer structure of BHJ-OSCs ideally consists of an interpenetrating network of an electron-donor material (including polymers and small molecules)8,9 and an electron-acceptor material, typically, [6,6]phenyl-C61 (or C71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or PC71BM). Currently, BHJ-OSCs based on conjugated polymers have been well studied and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been promoted up to 7–9% recently.2,9–16 In contrast, OSCs based on small molecules have not been so intensively studied up to date. With respect to the polymer materials, solution-processed organic small molecules have some obvious advantages, including well-defined molecular structure, definite molecular weight, and easy purification as well as well-reproducible device performances.17,18 Although the PCE of the small-molecule based organic solar cells (SM-OSCs) have reached to about 6–7% recently,19–22 the highly efficient SM-OSCs, typically, with PCE > 5%, are still rare, and the reported devices are all based on the following four kinds of molecular structure: (I) the oligothiophene derivatives with electron-withdrawing end groups such as 3-ethylrhodanine and alkyl cyanoacetate groups;19,23–25 (II) dithienosilole (DTS) with benzothiadiazole derivatives;22 (III) dialkylated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives,26 for example, we have recently found that covalent incorporation of 4,8-bis(2-(2-ethylhexylthienyl)) benzodithiophene (BDT) in between two DPP units yielded a high PCE of 5.29%;27 (IV) functionalized squaraine derivatives.28 Therefore, enriching the molecular tool-box with new molecular backbones that can afford high-efficiency is essentially urgent in the organic electronic community.
Triphenylamine (TPA) backbone generally shows good electron-donating and high charge-transporting properties because of its special propeller starburst-like molecular structure.29 The efficiency of over 4% has been recently reported from the TPA-based solution-processed SM-OSCs.30 On the other hand, dialkylated diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives, possessing good solubility, strong light-harvesting ability and easy chemical modification, are promising building units of electron-donor materials for SM-OSCs.31 PCE over 4% has been achieved with the DPP-based molecules as donor materials.27,32–35
As such, both the TPA and DPP are promising building blocks for donor materials in SM-OSCs. However, the covalently linked TPA-DPP backbone has received little attention and the reported efficiencies from the covalently linked TPA-DPP backbone are still very low, with a rather modest PCE of ∼2%.36,37 Is there a feasible and accessible method to improve the PCE of these covalent linked TPA-DPP molecules, which contain two excellent building blocks?
Herein, considering the inherently excellent properties of TPA and DPP units, we chose these two moieties as the basic building blocks, firstly obtained a benchmark star-shaped molecule TPA-DPP through covalently linking the two units together, as shown in Scheme 1. Furthermore, a thiophene unit was embedded in between the covalent TPA and DPP units, obtaining TPA-T-DPP for the purpose of enlarging the conjugation. We reported the comparative studies on the optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of these two small molecules. Our results indicated that embedding the thiophene units in may enhance the light-absorptivity, enlarge the absorption band and lower the band gap, yielding enhanced light-harvesting ability. Enlarging the conjugation also enhanced the intermolecular π–π interactions, improved the molecular ordering and facilitated the charge carrier mobility. Both could significantly improve the device performance. The best TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM based device showed a 2.14-fold enhanced PCE, up to 2.95%, with respect to the best TPA-DPP based device (1.38%). The PCE of the best TPA-T-DPP:PC61BM based device was also 1.6 times higher than the PCE of the best TPA-DPP based device (1.81% vs. 1.13%). Additionally, when TPA-T-DPP was used as the electron acceptor material, the best P3HT:TPA-T-DPP based device exhibited a very high open-circuit voltage (1.14 V), which was among the highest values reported for single-layered OSC devices.

Experimental
Materials
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, Alfa Aesar or TCI, and used as received. Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were distilled from sodium benzophenone ketyl under nitrogen before use. PC71BM and PC61BM was bought from ADS (American Dye Source Inc.)
Measurements and characterization
The 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE 400 MHz spectrometer with tetramethylsilane (TMS; δ = 0 ppm) as an internal standard. Elemental analysis was recorded on a flash EA1112 analyzer. Mass spectra (MALDI-TOF-MS) were determined on a Bruker BIFLEX III mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA-7 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under nitrogen flow. UV-vis absorption was measured on a Hitachi U-3010 spectrometer. The electrochemical measurements were carried out under argon at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 at room temperature with a computer-controlled Zennium electrochemical workstation. A glassy carbon electrode, a Pt wire, and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the working, counter, and reference electrodes, respectively. The samples were dissolved in chloroform with tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M) as the electrolyte. AFM images were measured from the SM-OSC samples using a Nanoscope V AFM (Digital Instruments) in tapping mode. X-ray diffraction (XRD) samples of pristine films were prepared by drop-casting of solutions on silica slides and small molecule/PCBM blending films were spin-coated using the same conditions of the best devices. The XRD pattern was recorded by a Rigaku D/max–2500 diffractometer operated at 40 kV voltage and a 200 mA current with CuKα radiation (1.5418 Å) at a scan speed of 8° min−1.
Fabrication and characterization of SM-OSCs
The SM-OSCs devices were fabricated with the traditional configurations of the indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/small molecule:PCBM/Ca/Al in the glove box under the protection of N2 flow, O2 ≤ 0.1 ppm and H2O ≤ 0.1 ppm. Prior to use, ITO glass was cleaned with deionized water, acetone and isopropanol and treated in a Novascan PSD-ultraviolet-ozone chamber for 30 min, respectively. A thin layer (30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP AI 4083, Germany) was spin-coated onto the ITO glass with a spin-coating speed of 2000 rpm and baked at 150 °C for 10 min. Then, a 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution of small molecule/PCBM with different weight ratios was subsequently spin-coated on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer (ca. 100 nm). At last, the Ca/Al cathode was deposited on the photoactive layer by vacuum evaporation (ca. 20/80 nm). The effective area of every cell was 4 mm2. The current–voltage (J–V) measurement of the devices was measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit in the dark and under white light illumination with AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2). EQE measurements were determined using an oriel IQE 200 (Newport).
Testing of the charge carrier mobilities

Hole mobilities of small molecule/PC71BM. 
The devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC71BM/Au. The active layers were spin-coated under the conditions that afford the best photovoltaic results. The following equation was applied to estimate the hole mobilities:38,39 ln(JL3V−2) = 0.89(1/E0)0.5(V/L)0.5 + ln(9εε0μ0/8)(1)where ε is the average dielectric constant of the blended film, ε0 the permittivity of the vacuum, μ0 the zero-field mobility, E0 the characteristic field, J the current density, L the thickness of the films, and V = Vappl − Vbi; Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential, which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode (in this device structure, Vbi = 0.2 V). The hole mobility of the blending films was deduced from the intercept value of ln(9εε0μ0/8).


Electron mobilities of P3HT/small molecule. 
The devices were fabricated with a configuration of ITO/TIPD/P3HT:TPA-T-DPP/Al. The blended films were prepared using the same conditions as the preparation of the best OSC device. Electron mobilities were extracted by fitting the current density–voltage curves using the Mott–Gurney relationship (space charge limited current) as follows: J = 9εε0μeV2/8L3(2)where ε is the dielectric constant of the electron-acceptor, ε0 = 8.85419 × 10−12 C V–1 m−1, μe the zero-field mobility, L the thickness of the films, and V = Vappl − Vbi; Vappl is the applied potential, and Vbi is the built-in potential, which results from the difference in the work function of the anode and the cathode (in this device structure, Vbi = 0 V). The electron mobility of the blending films was deduced from the intercept value of ln(J).
The TIPD buffer layer was prepared by spin-coating (3000 rpm) a 3.5 wt% TIPD isopropanol solution on the pre-cleaned ITO substrate and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min. Subsequently, the blended films were prepared using the same conditions as the preparation of the best OSC device. Finally, a 1000 nm Al layer was thermally deposited on the top of the blended films in vacuum.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterizations

TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP were synthesized using the Suzuki and Stille coupling reaction, as shown in Scheme 2. TPA-DPP was synthesized from compound 2 and TDPP-Br (3) with a yield of 35%, while TPA-T-DPP was synthesized from compound 5 and TDPP-Br (3) with a yield of 41%. Both TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP are soluble enough in commonly used organic solvents, such as DCM, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran (THF), chlorobenzene, o-DCB and toluene.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the temperature with 5% weight loss was 399.8 °C for TPA-DPP and 391.8 °C for TPA-T-DPP (Fig. 1). Such thermal stability was high enough for the studies of SM-OSCs.

Optical properties

Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP in DCM and the related optical data are summarized in Table 1. Due to the photo-induced intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transition from the TPA core to the DPP arms,42 both of them exhibited a broad absorption band positioning at ca. 596 nm. For TPA-T-DPP, the absorption around 395 nm is the characteristic absorption peak of thiophene. The arms of both compounds adopted planar conformation with small dihedral angles of <20° (ESI, Fig. S1†), indicating nice coplanarity for both compounds. The covalent thiophene bridges in TPA-T-DPP could extend delocalization of the HOMO and increase orbital overlapping between HOMO and LUMO, which contributed to the enhanced absorption coefficient.43TPA-T-DPP showed enhanced light-harvesting ability, with maximum molar extinction coefficient (εmax) enhancing by 1.4-fold, from 1.2 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for TPA-DPP to 1.7 × 105 M−1 cm−1 for TPA-T-DPP. The optical band gap of TPA-T-DPP is 1.86 eV estimated from the onset of absorption of the solution (λedge = 665 nm), being narrower than that of TPA-DPP (1.92 eV). The full-width-at-half-maximum (fwhm) is 101 nm for TPA-T-DPP, 1.1 times wider than that of TPA-DPP (92 nm). Thin film absorption spectra of TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP at per 100 nm film thickness are shown in Fig. 2b. As compared to the solution spectrum, the film absorption spectrum of TPA-DPP showed an obviously broader and bathochromic absorption (Δλmax = 22 nm) for the ICT band due to the strong π–π interaction and intermolecular interaction in the film.44 The film absorption spectrum of TPA-T-DPP was also red-shifted in comparison with its solution. However, benefiting from embedding thiophene in between TPA and DPP backbone, the absorption edge of the TPA-T-DPP film extended up to 702 nm, red-shifting by 28 nm compared to the TPA-DPP film. In addition, the fwhm of the TPA-T-DPP film was 131 nm, being broader than that of TPA-DPP (107 nm), which was attributed to a rigid coplanarization of the conjugated systems enforced by the molecular packing. The absorbance of TPA-T-DPP (abs. = 1.72) at per 100 nm film thickness was increased by 1.4 times compared to that of TPA-DPP (abs. = 1.23). The experimental data indicated that embedding thiophene units between the TPA and DPP units can enhance absorptivity, broaden absorption band and reduce the optical band gap both in solutions and films. Due to its enhanced light-harvesting ability, TPA-T-DPP is expected to afford a better photovoltaic performance with respect to that of TPA-DPP, as will be discussed in the photovoltaic section.

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the two compounds were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and Table 1 summaries the electrochemical data. In cyclic voltammograms (Fig. 3), the oxidation onset potentials of TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP were estimated to be 0.78 V and 0.73 V, respectively, while the onsets of reduction potential were at −1.15 V and −1.08 V, respectively. The energy levels of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) were calculated as −5.18 eV and −3.25 eV for TPA-DPP and −5.13 eV and −3.32 eV for TPA-T-DPP, respectively, by the following empirical eqn (3):36 EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eonset(ox/red) + 4.4)(3)

The up-shifted TPA-T-DPP HOMO energy level was expected due to its more electron-rich thiophene units on the backbone. The electrochemical band gap slightly decreased from TPA-DPP (−1.93 eV) to TPA-T-DPP (−1.81 eV), both agreeing well with the values and the changing trend of the optical band gap of these two compounds (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 4, the energy levels of the LUMO and HOMO of TPA-T-DPP and TPA-DPP located in between those of PC61BM, PC71BM and P3HT, suggesting that both the compounds are potential candidates that can be used as either the electron-donor materials when blended with PCBM or the electron-acceptor materials when mixing with P3HT.

Photovoltaic properties and characterizations of the SM-OSCs using TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP as the electron-donor materials

Photovoltaic properties. 
BHJ-OSCs were fabricated with the conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PCBM/Ca/Al and the device fabrications were described in Experimental section. The active layers were prepared by blending TPA-DPP or TPA-T-DPP with PC61BM or PC71BM at various weight ratios. The results of different devices under various donor (D)/acceptor (A) ratios were displayed in Table S1 (ESI).† The optimal D/A ratios for TPA-DPP/PCBM and TPA-T-DPP/PCBM were 1:2 and 1:4, respectively, as shown in Table 2. Owing to its broader absorption and higher absorption coefficient, the PC71BM as an acceptor helped to adsorb a greater number of photons as shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI),† thereby providing a higher value of JSC than that of PC61BM, which contributed to the higher PCE. We have to note that most of the devices based on small molecules reported in the literature exhibited the best results when the donor concentration was dominant in the active layer.20,45 However, in our results, when the donor concentrations were inferior to the acceptor, it gave the best photovoltaic performances, probably due to the stronger light-harvesting ability of the donor materials and the higher exciton separation efficiency. TPA-T-DPP/PCBM showed even lower D/A ratios of 1:4, partially resulting from the stronger light-harvesting ability of TPA-T-DPP.

The best TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM based device showed a dramatically enhanced PCE of 2.95%, which was increased by 2.14 times with respect to the efficiency of the best TPA-DPP based device (1.38%). The increased efficiency was mainly from the 1.98-fold increase of the short-circuit current density, JSC (10.06 mA cm−2vs. 5.08 mA cm−2) and was also contributed from the increase of the open-circuit voltage, VOC (0.81 V vs. 0.77 V) and the fill factor, FF (36.2% vs. 35.2%). It was recognized from the UV-vis absorption spectra that TPA-T-DPP showed enhanced light-harvesting ability and the charge carrier mobility studies also revealed that TPA-T-DPP had a higher hole mobility (vide post), both attributed to the improvements in JSC and FF, and therefore, the efficiency. Though the HOMO energy level of TPA-DPP is lower than that of TPA-T-DPP, the VOC of the TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM blend is higher than that of the TPA-DPP:PC71BM cells. As is known, the VOC depends on the difference between the HOMO of the donor molecule and the LUMO of the acceptor molecule, and the charge recombination process and film morphology.3,4,46 It can be deduced that the higher hole mobility and better film morphology (vide post) both account for the higher VOC for TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM cells.
The data of devices using PC61BM as the electron-acceptor material also confirmed the improvement of the photovoltaic performance by embedding the thiophene units in the TPA-DPP backbone. As indicated from Table 2, the best TPA-T-DPP:PC61BM based device gave a PCE of 1.81%, which is about 1.60 times higher than that value of the best TPA-DPP:PC61BM based device (1.13%). Both of the TPA-T-DPP:PC61BM and TPA-DPP:PC61BM based devices showed a close VOC (0.83 V vs. 0.84 V). However, the former device exhibited a higher JSC (5.60 mA cm−2vs. 4.19 mA cm−2) and an improved FF (38.8% vs. 31.9%).
Taken together, the photovoltaic results from both the PC71BM and PC61BM based devices clearly demonstrated that enlarging the conjugate of the TPA-DPP backbone, by embedding thiophene rings in it, can significantly improve the device performance.
The accuracy of the photovoltaic measurements was confirmed by the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum. The EQE spectrum from a typical TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM based device is shown in Fig. 5b. The data showed that the EQE curve closely agreed with the absorption spectrum of the blended TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM film prepared under the same condition as the preparation of the best OSC device. The EQE curve covered a broad response from 300 nm to 700 nm, much broader than that of TPA-DPP (400–700 nm),36 which indicated that both the electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials contributed to the photocurrent generation. It exhibited a significant improvement in photocurrent generation with a maximum EQE of 48%, much higher than the value of the device based on TPA-DPP (41%).36 The current density from integration of the EQE response was 11.45 mA cm−2 by following the eqn (4).47 EQE = 1240JSC/λPin(4)where JSC is the short circuit current, Pin the illumination intensity and λ represents the wavelength of the monochromatic incident light, respectively. This value is in good accord with the JSC value of the TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM based device (10.06 mA cm2).

Hole mobility. 
Hole mobility of the active layer is another important factor to influence the device efficiency. We used the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC)38,48 method to measure hole mobilities of the blended films with the device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC71BM/Au. The blended films were prepared using the same conditions as the preparation of the best OSC device. Fig. 6 shows the typical SCLC curves of the TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP based devices. The results are plotted as ln(JL3V−2) vs. (V/L)0.5, as shown in Fig. 6. The hole mobility of the blending films was deduced from the intercept value of ln(9εε0μ0/8). The hole mobilities of TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP were estimated as 3.85 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.16 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The 3D spatial geometry of the star-shaped molecular structure facilitated intra- and intermolecular hole transporting, which contributed to the high hole mobilities.49 The hole mobility of the TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM blended film was about one order of magnitude higher than that of the TPA-DPP:PC71BM blended film. Enlarging the conjugation length by embedding the thiophene unit in the TPA-DPP backbone enhanced the intermolecular interactions and improved the molecular packing ordering, which was beneficial to the hole transporting. The higher hole mobility was also consistent with its finer film morphology (Fig. 7) and accounted for the higher JSC and the better performance of the device.

Film morphology. 
We used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to analyse the film morphology of the active layers, which were prepared under the same condition as the preparation of the best OSC device. The AFM height and phase images of the blended films of TPA-DPP:PC71BM (1:2, w/w) and TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM (1:4, w/w) are shown in Fig. 7. The AFM height images showed that the two blended films were smooth enough with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.292 nm for the blended films of TPA-DPP:PC71BM and 0.260 nm for the blended films of TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM, respectively. The blended film of TPA-T-DPP/PC71BM had a relatively lower RMS, implying better miscibility between TPA-T-DPP and PC71BM, which was consistent with the higher FF of the best TPA-T-DPP based device. The phase images in Fig. 7 revealed the presence of two domains and uniform dispersement. The phase separation sizes of both the films were estimated by the cross-section profiles to be about 9–15 nm, within the distance range of the efficient exciton diffusion.50


X-ray diffraction. 
To investigate the molecular packing of the small molecules in the pristine solid-state films and the blended films with PC71BM, thin film X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed. The XRD patterns of the pristine films of TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP, which were spin-coated from the corresponding o-DCB solutions, are presented in Fig. 8. Both films exhibited a broad diffraction band in the smaller angle region of 5–9° and another broad one in the wider angle range from 15–25°. The former band was assigned as being from the ordered assembly along the molecular arms, the (100) direction and the latter one was contributed from the ordered π–π stacking between the conjugated main backbones, the (010) direction (Fig. 8 and Table S2, ESI†).51,52

(b) Schematic model of the TPA-T-DPP in the solid state. 
With respect to TPA-DPP, TPA-T-DPP has longer molecular arms (16.01 Å vs. 20.31 Å) because of the embedded thiophene units. As a result, the (100) diffraction band of TPA-T-DPP localized at a smaller 2θ degree of 6.05° (corresponding to a d100 spacing of 14.60 Å), while that of TPA-DPP positions at a larger 2θ degree of 6.30° (relative to a d100 spacing of 14.02 Å). The values of the d100 spacing, 14.60 Å for TPA-T-DPP and 14.02 Å for TPA-DPP were both smaller than twice the full extended length of the molecular arms, strongly suggesting the overlapping of the terminal DPP units (Fig. 8). For the ordered packing along the π–π stacking between the coplanar conjugated main chains, the broad (010) diffraction from TPA-DPP appeared around 20.11° (2θ), which corresponded to a d010 value of 4.42 Å. In contrast, the broad (010) diffraction from TPA-T-DPP occurred at a larger 2θ degree of 21.60°, corresponding to a smaller d010 spacing of 4.11 Å. The smaller d010 spacing from TPA-T-DPP than that from TPA-DPP strongly suggested closer interlayered π–π stacking for the molecules of TPA-T-DPP than TPA-DPP in the solid films, due to the fact that embedding the thiophene units enlarges the conjugation length and further enhances the inter-main chain's interactions.
After blending with PC71BM, the molecular arrangement of TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP were rather different to their corresponding pristine films. Both the (100) and (010) diffraction peaks were interrupted in the blended films, and the blended films showed a relatively broad diffraction peak appearing around 16–22°. This diffraction peak was overlapped from both the ordered stacking of PC71BM (2θ = 19.25°, d = 4.61 Å) and the π–π stacking (010) of the small molecular backbones (about 4.76 Å). Both TPA-DPP and TPA-T-DPP had good miscibility with PC71BM, which corroborated the AFM results discussed above.53

Photovoltaic properties and characterizations of the SM-OSCs using TPA-T-DPP and TPA-DPP as the electron-acceptor materials
Since the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of TPA-T-DPP match well with the energy levels of P3HT, TPA-T-DPP and TPA-DPP54 can be used as the electron-acceptor material, while P3HT is used as the electron-donor material to construct SM-OSC devices. The SM-OSC devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:TPA-T-DPP/Ca/Al and illuminated under an AM 1.5 G white light with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The photovoltaic performances at different D/A weight ratios are shown in Table S3 (ESI).† When the D/A ratio reached to 1:1, best results were obtained and shown in Table 3. Fig. 9a is the characteristic J–V curve from a typical best device. The best device gave a VOC of 1.14 V, a JSC of 1.33 mA cm−2, and a FF of 41.4%, yielding a PCE of 0.63%.

The EQE response supported the accuracy of the photovoltaic measurement. As shown in Fig. 9b, the best device showed a broad EQE spectrum ranging from 300 to 700 nm. The EQE curve agreed with the absorption spectrum of the blended film, which was prepared under the same conditions as the preparation of the best OSC device. This indicated that both the donor and acceptor materials contributed to the photo-to-electron conversion. The current density (1.61 mA cm−2) integrated from the EQE curve matched well with the values (1.33 mA cm−2) obtained from the J–V measurements.
The electron mobility of the 1:1 blended P3HT:TPA-T-DPP film was measured by the SCLC method with a typical device structure of ITO/TIPD/P3HT:TPA-T-DPP/Al. The results are plotted as ln(J) vs. ln(V), as shown in Fig. 10. The electron mobility of the blending films was deduced from the intercept value of ln(J). The electron mobility was estimated as 1.0 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.

The AFM height and phase images of the blended film of P3HT:TPA-T-DPP (1:1, w/w) are shown in Fig. 9c and d. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness was 1.57 nm and the phase separation size estimated by cross-section profiles was about 10–20 nm, which was within exciton diffusion range.
We also used XRD to investigate the molecular arrangement in the 1:1 blended film of P3HT and TPA-T-DPP. In Fig. 11, there was a sharp and strong peak at 2θ of 5.49° (d = 16.10 Å) towards a lower angle region, which was assigned from the ordered assembly of P3HT, the (100) direction. The second-order diffraction peaks (200) at 2θ of 10.98° (d = 8.05 Å) could be observed, which indicated that TPA-T-DPP blended with P3HT had long-range order.25,55

Conclusions
We embedded thiophene units as bridges between the TPA and DPP units and synthesized a new solution-processable small molecule, TPA-T-DPP. Benefiting from the thiophene bridges between TPA and DPP units in TPA-T-DPP, it showed enhanced light-harvesting ability and higher hole mobility with respect to the mother backbone of TPA-DPP. The photovoltaic properties of these two molecules were investigated by constructing the conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PCBM/Ca/Al. The best TPA-T-DPP:PC71BM based devices showed a dramatically enhanced PCE of 2.95%, which was increased by 2.14 times with respect to the efficiency of the best TPA-DPP based devices (1.38%). When using PC61BM as the electron-acceptor material, the PCE of the best TPA-T-DPP based devices was also 1.6 times higher than the value of the best TPA-DPP based devices (1.81% vs. 1.13%). The results indicated that the structural modifications with embedding covalent thiophene as bridges in the star-shaped TPA-DPP backbone can significantly enhance the device performances. The experimental data highlighted the importance of synthetic design about embedding a thiophene for realizing highly efficient SM-OSCs. Moreover, TPA-T-DPP was also a promising electron-acceptor in OSCs. The VOC of the solution-processed BHJ-OSC based on a blend of TPA-T-DPP as acceptor and P3HT as donor was 1.14 V, which was among the highest values reported for single OSCs. We anticipate that our work will likely expand the star-shaped TPA-DPP building block applications in the organic photovoltaic field and enrich the train of design ideas about the higher efficiency materials in solution-processed SM-OSCs.
