    , Accepted 19th October 2016First published on 19th October 2016AbstractA thermo-cleavable fullerene derivative was used as an interfacial engineering material in planar perovskite solar cells. The modified TiO2 surface shows exceptional resistance against polar solvent washing and the perovskite film grown on it was of high quality with less pinholes. Consequently, high performance devices without hysteresis have been achieved.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells have ranked among the top in the photovoltaic research field since their power conversion efficiency (PCE) was boosted from about 3% to over 20% in less than 5 years.1–3 They were originally developed by replacing liquid electrolytes and organic dyes in sensitized solar cells (SSCs) with solid-state hole transporting materials and organometal halide perovskite absorbers.1 Taking full advantage of the inherent properties of perovskite materials such as a high absorption coefficient, adjustable band gap, long charge transporting distance and high carrier mobility, hybrid perovskites have manifested excellent performance both in meso- and planar-structured architectures.4–6 Even if it is not yet clear which architecture is beneficial over the other, the unique feature of solution processing used for the fabrication of perovskite active layers ensures that planar-structured architectures have great flexibilities and prospects. TiO2 has long been considered as one of the best electron extraction and transporting materials due to its suitable energy level compatible with those of perovskites; hence the compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2) film is widely used as an electron transporting layer (ETL) in conventional planar heterojunction structures.7–9 However, the produced c-TiO2 film inevitably exhibits a deficiency that should be taken into account, namely UV-light induced surface trap states.10 Meanwhile, the quality of perovskite films is highly dependent on the surface properties of TiO2 as well.11 Consequently, modification of the c-TiO2 surface is indispensable in order to reduce the energy loss caused by charge recombination and severe hysteresis arising from the large density of defects in perovskite films and trap sites on the c-TiO2 surface. It has been proven that the insertion of an interfacial layer based on fullerene materials between the c-TiO2 and perovskite is one of the most effective ways to eliminate the abovementioned drawbacks. These materials have been distinctly demonstrated to be superior in aspects such as good electron mobility, tunable energy levels and good compatibility with the perovskite active layer. They can be exemplified by fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), tri-block fullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid dioctyl-3,3′-(5-hydroxy-1,3-phenylene)bis(2-cyanoacrylate)ester (PCBB-2CN-2C8) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyricacid (PCBA).8,9,12 All of them have shown a certain effect on the passivation of the c-TiO2 surface. However, the main drawback of most of these materials is that they can be removed from the c-TiO2 surface during the subsequent wetting process in all probability. Therefore, the desirable interfacial materials should be intact in the polar solvent used for coating the perovskite precursors and possess excellent electron extraction and hole blocking abilities. Here, we introduce a thermo-cleavable fullerene derivative di-tert-butyl methano[60]fullerene-61,61-dicarboxylate (DBMD), which was initially used to modify the ZnO surface in polymer solar cells.13 DBMD is fully soluble in common organic solvents and can be used to fabricate thin films by solution processing. After heating the DBMD films to 170 °C, DBMD decomposed to form an insoluble methano[60]fullerene-61-carboxylic acid (MCA) layer. The very small carboxylic acid group should endue the MCA film with very good electron conductivity. Additionally, the enhanced hydrophobicity should be helpful to form a high quality perovskite film.14 As expected, a pinhole-free high quality perovskite film was grown on the MCA modified c-TiO2 surface and the photovoltaic performance especially the longevity of devices was remarkably improved.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and instruments
Titanium tetra-iso-propanoate (97%), 1-butanol (99.9%), hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water), and methylamine (40 wt% in water) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received without any purification. Anhydrous N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (99%) were purchased from J&K. 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD), lead(II) iodide and tert-butyl pyridine (>96.0%) were purchased from Chemlin Chemical Industry Co., Ltd (Nanjing, China), Alfa Aesar and TCI, respectively.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was carried out by using a Bruker X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα as the radiation source. UV-visible (ultraviolet-visible) absorption spectra were obtained on a PerkinElmer UV-vis spectrometer model Lambda 750. SEM (scanning electron microscope) images were acquired by using an S-4800 (Hitachi) field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer-LS55. Time resolved PL spectra were recorded on a PL spectrometer FLS 900 (Edinburgh Instruments), excited with a picosecond pulsed diode laser (EPL-445) and measured at 775 nm after excitation at 445 nm. XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy) and UPS (ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy) were performed using a Kratos AXIS UTRADLD UPS/XPS system (Kratos analytical, Manchester, UK). XPS studies were performed using a monochromated Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. The UPS measurement is carried out on an integrated ultra-high vacuum system (3.0 × 10−8 Torr) using the He(I) (21.22 eV) line in order to shift the spectra from the spectrometer threshold. Contact angles were measured using an OCA20 instrument (Data-Physics, Germany), and the system was maintained at ambient temperature and saturated humidity. In each measurement, a 2 μL droplet of water was dispensed onto the substrates under investigation. The average contact angle value was obtained from three different positions of the same sample.
2.2 Synthesis of DBMD
The thermo-cleavable fullerene DBMD was synthesized using the method described elsewhere.13
2.3 Perovskite film preparation and characterization
Methylammonium iodide (MAI, CH3NH3I) was prepared according to a previously published method. Perovskite precursor solution was prepared referring to a modified one-step procedure. In brief, CH3NH3I and PbI2 (1:1, mol/mol) were dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide (DMF) at a concentration of 320 mg mL−1. 25.3 mg mL−1 NH4Cl was used as an additive to facilitate the formation of a high-quality perovskite crystal.15 For the sake of characterization, perovskite films were prepared by spin coating the mixed solution onto c-TiO2 or c-TiO2/MCA coated fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates at 3000 rpm for 60 s, and the substrates were heated at 55 °C for 15 min. The obtained films were investigated by UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, XRD and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
2.4 Solar cell fabrication and characterization
For the device fabrication, first FTO coated glass substrates (15 × 20 mm, 15 Ω sq−1 resistance) were etched with zinc powder and HCl (2 M). Then these FTO substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially. Afterwards, FTO glasses were treated with an alkaline solution (with the volume ratio of H2O:H2O2:NH3 (aq) = 5:1:1) at 160 °C for 40 min, and then washed with deionized water several times to remove the residual alkaline solution. The c-TiO2 ETL was made by subsequently spin-coating 1.0 M titanium tetra-iso-propanoate 1-butanol solution (containing 1.0 M HCl) onto FTO substrates at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Then the substrates were dried at 125 °C to remove the solvent and sintered at 500 °C for 60 min.16 After the substrates cooled down to room temperature, 9 mg mL−1 DBMD solution in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) was spin-coated (2500 rpm for 60 s) on the c-TiO2 layer. The DBMD-coated film was heated at 170 °C for 10 min to induce thermal cleavage of tertiary alkyl ester to form the MCA film. The as-prepared perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto a c-TiO2 (or c-TiO2/MCA) layer at 2500 rpm for 60 s, and the substrates were heated at 55 °C for 15 min. 1 mL of Spiro-OMeTAD solution (80 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene), 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butyl pyridine and 17.5 μL of Li-TFSI solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) were mixed and used as the precursor for the hole transport layer (HTL). The above doped Spiro-OMeTAD solution was deposited on the pre-prepared CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite layer by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, the Ag counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation on the HTL layer at a pressure below 10−6 Torr. All the devices were kept overnight in air for the full doping of Spiro-OMeTAD via oxidation.17 The device was measured in nitrogen with an effective area of 0.04 cm2. J–V (current density–voltage) characteristics were recorded at room temperature using an Agilent B2902A Source Meter under the illumination of an AM 1.5G AAA class solar simulator (model XES-301S, SAN-EI) with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and the white light intensity was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si solar cell.
3. Results and discussion
The planar heterojunction perovskite photovoltaic solar cells were constructed in a typical conventional configuration of FTO/c-TiO2 (150 nm)/CH3NH3PbI3 (250 nm)/Spiro-OMeTAD (100 nm)/Ag (80 nm) as illustrated in Fig. 1a on the left hand side. Detailed fabrication procedures are described in the Experimental section. For the modified devices, a MCA layer was additionally inserted between the c-TiO2 and perovskite film as shown in Fig. 1a on the right hand side. The MCA layer was produced by thermal cleavage of the pre-spin coated DBMD layer (see ESI Table 1†). The successful deposition of DBMD was preliminarily proven by the contact angle measurement as described below. Due to the absorption of the fullerene moiety in MCA, the existence of MCA could be further confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. S1,† a proportionally enhanced absorption in the range of 300 and 350 nm for MCA modified substrates is observed with the increase of DBMD concentration. The presence of MCA could also be verified based on the analysis of XPS curves of the FTO/c-TiO2 substrates with and without MCA (see Fig. S2†). The C 1s peak appeared at 285.0 eV and the Ti 2p peaks appeared at 458.8 and 464.5 eV. After modification with the MCA layer, the component ratio of C to Ti significantly increased in comparison with the bare FTO/c-TiO2 film. It is worth noting that the characteristic absorption and crystallization of the perovskite active layer were not affected after the insertion of the MCA layer (see Fig. S3 and S4†).

Both the pristine and MCA modified devices tested in our work were fabricated under the optimized conditions. Each layer of the devices was successfully constructed which could be clearly distinguished from the cross-sectional scanning electron microscope (SEM) image shown in Fig. 1b. The photovoltaic properties of the devices were preferentially investigated and the results are summarized in Table 1. In order to better understand and further elucidate the photo-response behaviour of the devices, both forward and reverse measurements were carried out, and the J–V curves of the devices with and without the MCA layer are shown in Fig. 2a. For the sake of clarity, we take the best data collected under forward measurements for the following discussion.

A relatively low PCE value of 8.12% was obtained for the pristine devices in the forward scanning direction; whereas under the reverse bias scan the PCE was markedly enhanced to 11.74%. Such a big difference particularly stemmed from the varied fill factor (FF), which increased from 41.86% for the forward scan to 58.60% for the reverse scan, and could be interpreted by the commonly observed hysteresis phenomena.18 The current hysteresis typically shows itself in the current–voltage characterization of many devices as shown in the top half of Fig. 2a and will essentially induce an over- or under-estimation of the overall PCE value. However, this disparity in PCE almost vanished for the MCA modified devices. As shown in Table 1, very close PCE values of 16.41% and 17.09% measured under the forward scan and the reserve scan, respectively, are presented for devices with a MCA layer inserted between the c-TiO2 and perovskite active layers. Many more devices were tested and the statistical histograms displayed in Fig. 2c further testified the encouraging reproducibility of efficiencies for devices with MCA modification measured in different scanning directions. In combination with the small hysteresis index of 0.043 and almost superimposed J–V curves in the bottom half of Fig. 2a, it is reasonable to believe that MCA modification could be an efficient strategy to alleviate hysteresis behavior.19 This effect is observed even for the larger active area device (Fig. S6†). Moreover, the measured Jsc value fits very well with that integrated from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves in Fig. 2b.
It is also noticeable that the overall PCE increased more than one-fold from 8.12% to 16.41%, mainly assigned to the slightly increased Voc and the greatly enhanced Jsc and FF. This indicates that, on one hand, the modification of the c-TiO2 ETL by MCA could be helpful to modulate the energy offset between the ETL and perovskite active layer. Revisiting Fig. 1c, it can be seen that the work function of c-TiO2 is uplifted by ∼100 meV after the modification with MCA. In this way, a well matched energy level has been provided for efficient electron extraction and the improvement of built-in potential in devices thus contributes to the higher Voc; on the other hand, MCA modification could be potentially beneficial to reduce charge recombination and facilitate charge-carrier transfer/transport since boosted Jsc and FF were both achieved. This can be further delineated on two fronts, namely crystal perovskite film growth and interface control.
The quality of perovskite films is regarded as the most important factor to acquire high performance perovskite solar cells.20,21 So an ingenious manipulation of the morphology and/or surface coverage is always pursued so as to produce a perovskite film with less defects and hysteresis. In our work, all the perovskite films were fabricated via the one-step method and the morphology of both the pristine and MCA modified CH3NH3PbI3 film was investigated. Fig. 3a reveals a basically continuous CH3NH3PbI3 film but with plenty of voids. The film grown on the MCA coated c-TiO2 layer (Fig. 3b) is much more continuous and pinhole free, suggesting that the morphology of the perovskite film is strongly dependent on the interfacial properties of ETLs. This is well consistent with that described in previous publications and also observed in inverted thin film devices using PEDOT:PSS as hole transport layers (HTLs).7–9,22,23 Therefore, the interfacial effect of MCA on the perovskite film growth was first investigated. In Fig. 3c–g, different water droplet contact angles are presented and this demonstrates that the surface wettability is variable among the pristine c-TiO2, c-TiO2/DBMD and c-TiO2/MCA layers. The c-TiO2/DBMD film has strong hydrophobicity since the contact angle was sharply increased from 11.6° to 90.2° after spin-coating DBMD solution, indicating the successful deposition of DBMD onto c-TiO2 and the two di-tert-butyl groups could be responsible for the high hydrophobicity. Subsequently heating the c-TiO2/DBMD film could lead to thermal cleavage of DBMD. For the consequently produced c-TiO2/MCA layer, the contact angle was measured to be 83.8°. It is reasonable to understand the decrease of the contact angle with the removal of the two tert-butyl groups. Only one carboxylic group remained, making the c-TiO2/MCA layer a little bit hydrophilic, which facilitates the precursor deposition (CH3NH3I and PbI2) from DMF solution. More importantly, the MCA layer was observed to be quite stable during the fabrication of the perovskite film by solution processing as a similar contact angle of 79.9° was measured even when the substrate was subjected to multiple rinsing with DMF. This unique feature differentiates MCA from the mostly used PCBM, PCBA and PCBB-2CN-2C8 as mentioned earlier, which indicates that MCA outperforms other fullerene derivatives in improving the solvent resistance against the DMF washing. Such appropriate surface wetting capability combined with the high solvent resistance of MCA guaranteed the fabrication of high quality perovskite films by the one step solution processing method. As shown in Fig. S5,† the surface of pristine c-TiO2 consists of a lot of discrete particles. These particles may act as nucleating sites for the crystallization of the perovskite film. As demonstrated by Huang et al., a smooth and homogeneous hydrophobic surface can decrease the nucleating sites, leading to pinhole-free perovskite films with a large crystal size.14 In our case, the successfully formed c-TiO2/MCA layer was found to be smooth and homogeneous with appropriate hydrophobicity. This means less nucleating sites for the crystallization of the perovskite film which could lead to the formation of pinhole-free perovskite films with a large crystal size. These greatly reduced pinhole defects in the perovskite film are quite helpful to speed up the photocurrent response of devices. Moreover, MCA should possess excellent electron extraction and hole blocking abilities as a well matched energy level of c-TiO2 was observed after the modification with MCA. Additionally, after thermal cleavage, only a very small acetic acid group was left on the fullerene cage, which will endow the MCA film with very high electron mobility and conductivity. This is also experimentally confirmed by the three-fold increased μe of the device with MCA modification as shown in Fig. S7.† As a result, the MCA modification layer can passivate the surfaces of the c-TiO2 film, effectively reduce the charge recombination, and diminish the undesired hysteresis behaviour of inverted perovskite solar cells. The effective extraction of electrons by the MCA modified c-TiO2 layer is verified by measuring steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) of the c-TiO2/perovskite and c-TiO2/MCA/perovskite films. As displayed in Fig. 4a, the PL intensity is greatly reduced when the c-TiO2 and perovskite layers were interfaced with MCA (see ESI†), manifesting fast electron injection from the perovskite into MCA modified c-TiO2. Meanwhile, good electronic coupling between the conduction band of the perovskite and the LUMO of MCA could be expected by revisiting Fig. 1c. Correspondingly, the PL lifetimes were also substantially shortened as recorded in TRPL decay transient spectra (Fig. 4b). Fitting the data with an exponential diffusion model gives a relatively long time, on average, of 11.63 ns for the c-TiO2/perovskite film. Under identical experimental conditions, the lifetime was cut in half to 5.57 ns for the c-TiO2/MCA/perovskite film. These results suggest a much faster charge-carrier transfer from the perovskite film to the c-TiO2/MCA layer. PL quenching primarily originates from the charge carrier extraction across the interface, so it is highly dependent on the quality of the perovskite film and the interfacial properties between the perovskite film and carrier collection layer. In our case, the reduced PL intensity and lifetime can be ascribed to the MCA modified c-TiO2 surface and the pinhole-free CH3NH3PbI3 film grown on it. This coincides well with the enhanced Jsc and FF values measured for the MCA modified devices. This is not only because the MCA modified TiO2 leads to an accelerated electron transfer, but also because MCA can very likely reduce the electronic trap density within the perovskite film and/or TiO2 surface via passivation, which is evidenced by less hysteresis behaviour observed in J–V curves as we discussed before. The current hysteresis is typically observed in the devices with a large density of defects.8,9,24 These defects are usually responsible to a large extent for the charge trapping and detrapping processes that slow down the photocurrent response of devices. This can be substantiated in our work by measuring the steady-state photocurrent output at the maximum power point (0.86 V).25 As shown in Fig. 4c, a sufficiently rapid increase of photocurrent to a maximum value of 19.70 mA cm−2 was achieved upon immediate light illumination of devices. This brings about a PCE of 16.94% that is very close to 17.09% obtained from the reverse bias scan model. Such a significantly increased photocurrent response speed indicates that using MCA is highly effective in mitigating the defect states in devices. This rationalizes the boosted photocurrent and FF since a great deal of defects has vanished within the perovskite film and c-TiO2 for example pin-holes as we addressed before. Additionally, the negligible hysteresis behaviour in MCA-based devices can also be interpreted here. We speculate that the passivation of surface traps via MCA modification is the key to eliminate the hysteresis phenomenon. In this case, the long-term ambient stability of the perovskite solar cells has been improved as demonstrated in Fig. S8.† The MCA-based devices maintained more than 60% and 90% of their initial efficiency and photocurrent, respectively, after 14 days of exposure to an ambient environment without any encapsulation, whereas the equivalent decay happened in less than 2 days for pristine devices without MCA modification. According to the report by Snaith's group, many more trap sites would be created on the TiO2 surface due to the UV light induced release of O2 and this is regarded to be the major cause of the fast degradation of perovskite solar cells.26 Therefore, the MCA interlayer has a remarkable effect in improving the stability of TiO2 and the corresponding devices via efficient passivation.

4. Conclusions
To conclude, we have made use of a thermo-cleavable fullerene derivative DBMD for ETL interfacial engineering in planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. With simple heating, this compound decomposed and generated MCA in situ on the c-TiO2 surface. The MCA acted as the actual interfacial material and the measured contact angle remained almost the same before and after repeated rinsing with DMF, indicating remarkably improved resistance against polar solvent washing. The perovskite film grown on this MCA underlayer was of high quality with less pinholes and it was proven to be beneficial for accelerating charge carrier transfer as well as reducing charge carrier recombination. Finally, a doubled power conversion efficiency of 17.1% was achieved for the best performing devices with a slightly increased Voc of 1.17 V, a greatly enhanced Jsc of 20.6 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.6%. In combination with alleviated hysteresis behaviour and enhanced long-term ambient stability of devices, we proposed that the modification of the TiO2 surface with MCA is an effective approach to improve photovoltaic performance, especially the stability. It is noteworthy that the improved solvent resistance against DMF washing is very impressive, which implies that the formation of a fullerene derivative modification layer by thermal cleavage is a very promising strategy for interfacial engineering in planar perovskite solar cells.
