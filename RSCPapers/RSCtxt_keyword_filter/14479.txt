    , Accepted 16th December 2014First published on 16th December 2014AbstractSemiconducting Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) thin-film is prepared by the spray-pyrolysis of aqueous precursor solutions of copper (CuCl2), indium (InCl3), gallium (GaCl3), and sulphur (SC(NH2)2) sources. The non-vacuum approach of making the CIGSSe thin film using environmentally benign halide-based aqueous precursor solutions paves the way for fabricating solar cells at a much cheaper cost. Here, gallium (Ga) is incorporated into the host lattice of CuIn(S,Se)2 (CISSe) films grown on a Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrate to modify the optoelectronic properties of CIGSSe films. The bandgap engineered, Ga-doped CIGSSe film leads to better photovoltaic characteristics and shows one of the highest efficiency for CIGS thin film solar cell made by the non-vacuum deposition of environmentally-friendly precursors. The optimum efficiency of solar cells with the device configuration of glass/Mo/CIGSSe/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO show j–V characteristics of Voc = 0.621 V, jsc = 24.29 mA cm−2, FF = 69.84%, and a power conversion efficiency of 10.54% under simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illuminations, demonstrating its potential in making a cost-effective thin film solar cell.
Introduction
Thin film solar technologies have the potential to produce cost-effective solar cells. Nowadays, chalcopyrite Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS)-based thin film solar cells show power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 20.9%.1,2 However, they require complex deposition processes, involving expensive vacuum technologies, to sputter or co-evaporate constituents of the CIGS thin films.2,3 Although they show excellent PCE in solar cells, the preparation approach involves expensive instrumentation and a toxic post-selenization step, i.e., in H2Se gas, thus raising the production cost of solar cells.4 In this regards, a non-vacuum solution-based CIGS thin film preparation approach has shown ability to avoid the issues related to the toxicity and high production cost because it requires inexpensive instruments and non-/less-toxic precursor materials. Very recently, solution-processed spray-coating approach has been utilized to grow CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite material for planar heterojunction solar cells, suggesting the potential of this approach for fabricating an efficient large-area solar cell at a much cheaper cost.5
To date, many solution-based chemical approaches have been utilized to prepare CIGS thin films.6–14 In the reported methods, precursors of copper (Cu), indium (In), gallium (Ga) and sulphur (S) have been utilized to prepare CIGS films. However, their photovoltaic performance was limited by the poor crystallinity of the films and presence of various impurities, which resulted in low open circuit voltage (Voc), and short-circuit photocurrent density (jsc). The commonly used solution-based approaches are the spray-pyrolysis of precursor solution,6,9,15 spin-coating of molecular precursors,16–22 and use of pre-synthesized nanoparticles.23–28 Among these approaches, the decomposition of Cu2S, In2Se3, and Ga2S3 in hydrazine has demonstrated the highest known efficiency of 15.2% among solution processed thin film solar cells.21,29 However, hydrazine-based synthesis approach may not be suitable in an industrial production line because of its toxicity and explosive nature. In addition, the spray-pyrolysis and spin-coating approaches showed carbonaceous impurities in the CIGS films, especially when alcohols were used to dissolve the halide and/or nitrate-based precursors of Cu, In, and Ga.30,31 The carbonaceous impurity affects the crystal growth of CIGS films and acts as a barrier for charge extraction in the solar cell.
To evade the above mentioned issues of toxicity and impurity, our group has reported CuIn(S,Se)2 (CISSe) films prepared by the spray-pyrolysis of aqueous CuCl2, InCl3, and thiourea precursor solution on a molybdenum (Mo) substrate and subsequent selenization.32 The usage of water as a solvent and non-toxic chemicals made the CuInS2 (CIS) film preparation approach environmentally benign and facile. In addition, the use of water as a solvent allowed the CISSe films to be free from carbonaceous impurities. However, the reported efficiency of the CISSe film-based solar cells showed a PCE of only 5.9%, in which the PCE was found to be affected by low Voc and fill factor (FF).32 To enhance the Voc of solar cells, doping of the CIS films with Ga is widely used to enhance the optoelectronic properties (i.e., bandgap energy (Eg), charge carrier mobilities and concentrations, etc.).33 Depending on the concentration of Ga dopants, the Eg can be systematically increased from 1.05 eV (CuInSe2) to 1.2–1.5 eV for Cu(In,Ga)(S, Se)2 (CIGSSe), which directly improves the efficiency of solar cells by improving Voc and FF. In this study, using a non-vacuum spray-pyrolysis method and subsequent selenization step, different amounts of Ga dopant are systematically incorporated into the CISSe film to obtain CIGSSe films with favourable optoelectronic properties. An optimized CIGSSe film prepared by the spray-pyrolysis of metal halide precursors and thiourea solution on the Mo-coated soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate at 300–350 °C, and subsequent selenization at 500 °C leads to a PCE of 10.54%. This efficiency of the CIGSSe-based solar cell is one of the highest among the solution-processed thin film solar cells. A combination of XRD, Raman and FE-SEM analyses show that the properties of the CIGSSe thin films can favourably be changed with successful Ga doping, which ultimately contributes to higher Voc, and FF; thus, the PCE of solar cells increases.
Experiments
Preparation of molybdenum (Mo) substrate
SLG substrate was cleaned by sequential sonication in 5% Decon 90 aqueous solution at 60 °C for 30 minutes followed by rinsing with deionized (DI) water and drying in N2 stream. To further remove the water residue from dried SLG, they were finally dried in an electric oven at 70 °C for 15 minutes. Subsequently, a Univex 350 sputtering system was used to deposit a Mo film on the SLG, in which the surface of the SLG was further cleaned by an argon plasma source generated at 200 W. The operating pressure of the deposition chamber was approximately 7 × 10−6 mbar. Single and bi-layer Mo film of approximately 1 μm thickness was deposited onto the SLG substrate with a DC bias at 360 W. To avoid the oxidation of the as-deposited thin film Mo, it was naturally cooled to room temperature inside the deposition chamber before exposing it to air.
Preparation of light absorbing thin films
The Mo-coated SLG substrate was cleaned by sequential sonication with an aqueous solution of 2.5% hellmanex-III for 5 minutes followed by a mixture of ethanol and deionized water, and finally in deionized water for 10 minutes each. Subsequently, they were dried in a N2 stream prior to the deposition of CIS and CIGS films. Aqueous 0.2 M copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O, 99.99% Aldrich), 0.2 M indium(III) chloride (InCl3, anhydrous 99.999%, Aldrich), 0.2 M gallium(III) chloride (GaCl3, anhydrous 99.999% Aldrich), and 1 M thiourea (SC(NH2)2, 99.0%, Sigma Aldrich) were prepared and used as stock solutions. Diluted aqueous solutions were prepared by keeping the volume of Cu and S precursor's stock solution constant, but varying the volume of In and Ga precursors to change the composition of sprayed CIS and CIGS films. The similar graded spray-pyrolysis approach was reported earlier by our group.32 In brief, the precursor solution was sprayed onto the cleaned Mo substrate at a temperature of 300–350 °C using an airbrush with N2 as the carrier gas at 4 bars in a fume hood.
The thin films were prepared with and without Ga variations by maintaining Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.00 for CIS and Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30 for CIGS. The CIS thin film was used to compare the performance of the CIGS films. The precursor material decomposes on the Mo substrate at the deposition temperature of 300–350 °C, and the resulting film is often amorphous or nanocrystalline and may include impurity phases.32 Therefore, the as-sprayed CIS and CIGS films were selenized in an argon filled selenization tube furnace (Thermo Scientific, single zone) to allow the grain growth and densification of the films by taking 30 mg of selenium (Se) pellet in a quartz tube at an optimized temperature of 500 °C for 10 minutes. After selenization, the CIS and CIGS films transform to CuIn(S,Se)2 (CISSe) and Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe), respectively. The selenization parameters include the Se evaporation temperature, flow rate of argon carrier gas, and selenization time. In addition to the grain growth, the selenization condition also simultaneously reduces defect states at the inter-crystalline boundary regions. Following the selenization step, they were cooled to room temperature and immediately transferred from the tube furnace into the chemical bath for CdS deposition.
Characterization of thin films
The crystal structure of the as-sprayed and selenized films were characterized by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique with a Bruker D8 advance diffractometer using Cu Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.1541 nm). The microstructure of CISSe and CIGSSe films were characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM-7600F). Prior to electron microscopy, a thin Pt layer was deposited to prevent charging effects. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental analysis of the films was carried out using the above FESEM instrument fitted with an EDS analyser. Raman spectroscopy measurement was carried out with a micro-Raman spectrometer (Renishaw system) in the backscattering configuration using a diode-pumped solid state laser at 532 nm with an excitation power of 1 mW. The carrier mobility and concentration in the films were estimated using a temperature variable Hall measurement system (MMR technologies). The films were prepared on glass substrates with an area of 1 cm2 and four aluminum square electrodes (1.6 × 1.6 mm2) were thermally evaporated. The Hall measurements were carried out at room temperature (302 K).
Fabrication of solar cells
To fabricate the heterojunction thin film solar cells with p-type CIGSSe films, an n-type CdS buffer layer of approximately 50 nm thickness was deposited onto the CISSe and CIGSSe films by chemical bath deposition. The temperature of the water bath was 80 °C, and the thin films were placed in a 200 ml aqueous solution that contained 4 mM cadmium acetate hydrate (Cd(CH3COO)2, 99.00%, Aldrich), 4 mM ammonium acetate (NH4(CH3COO), 99.99%, Sigma Aldrich), 2 mM thiourea (SC(NH2)2, 99.0%, Sigma Aldrich), and 0.3 ml ammonium hydroxide solution (NH4OH, 28–30% solution, Sigma Aldrich). After CdS deposition for 11 minutes, the thin films were rinsed with deionized water and immediately dried in N2 stream. Subsequently, an approximately 50 nm thick intrinsic zinc oxide (i-ZnO) and 500 nm thick aluminium-doped ZnO (AZO) were deposited by the Univex 350 sputtering system with an RF power of 100 W for 10 min and 160 W for 120 min, respectively. Finally, to collect photogenerated charge carriers and reduce the series resistance, a patterned top electrode made of Ni/Al was thermally evaporated onto the above mentioned electrodes using aluminium (Al) and nickel (Ni) pellets as the evaporation source. Subsequently, they were mechanically scribed to define the active area of individual solar cells to be 0.1 cm2.
Characterization of solar cells
A solar simulator (VS-0852) was utilized to measure the j–V characteristics of solar cells under the simulated AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination using a Keithley Source meter (2612A) and IV tester software package. The solar simulator was equipped with a 500 W xenon lamp, and the light intensity was calibrated using a Si reference solar cell (Fraunhofer). Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra was measured with a spectral resolution of ca. 5 nm using a PVE300 photovoltaic device characterization system (Bentham) equipped with a xenon/quartz lamp. The incident photon flux was determined using calibrated silicon (Si) and germanium (Ge) photodiodes, which allowed us to measure the IPCE up to a photon wavelength of 1800 nm. Controlling of the monochromator and recording of the photocurrent spectra were performed using a PC running Bentham software package.
Results and discussion
Structural and morphological characterizations of thin films
The as-sprayed CIS, CIGS, selenized CISSe, and CIGSSe films were characterized by glancing angle XRD with an incident angle of one degree, as shown in Fig. 1. The XRD patterns of the as-sprayed films show characteristic diffraction peaks, indicating the presence of polycrystalline CIS material (Fig. 1(a)). They show XRD peaks with broad full width half maximum (FWHM) and low intensities, suggesting the poor crystallinity of the as-sprayed films. The XRD patterns of the as-sprayed films confirm the absence of crystalline impurity phases of Cu2−xS, MoO2, and MoS2 (Fig. 1(a)).
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns of CIS, CIGS, CISSe, and CIGSSe thin films prepared on Mo-coated SLG substrate with different Ga/(In + Ga) ratio of 0.00, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25. The words, AS and Se, in the bracket refer to the as-sprayed and selenized films, respectively. The XRD pattern of Mo-coated SLG substrate is also included for reference. Fig. 1(b) shows a cross-sectional image of a CIGSSe solar cell. 
The Ga incorporation during the selenization step at 500 °C causes a shift of XRD patterns of the CIGSSe films towards a higher 2θ with respect to that of the CISSe film, indicating successful Ga doping into CISSe films (atomic size of Ga is smaller than In). The incorporation of Se into the as-sprayed CIS and CIGS films during selenization (Se has larger atom size than S) causes the lattice expansion of CISSe and CIGSSe films; thus, their XRD patterns are left-shifted as compared to the as-sprayed films (Fig. 1(a)). To ensure that the amount of lattice expansion due to selenization is similar in all the films, the Cu/S in the as-sprayed films was kept constant (using the same amount of Cu and S precursor solutions), and the same selenization condition was used for all the films. Therefore, the right shift of the CIGSSe film is purely attributed to the effect of Ga substitution in the In lattice. The lattice parameters of these films were also determined by the profile fitting (Rietveld refinement) of the full XRD patterns, which show that as compared to the CISSe film, the unit cell parameters a, c and volume (V) of tetragonal body centered CIGSSe films progressively reduce with increasing Ga content, as shown in Table 1. These unit cell parameters also confirm the partial substitution of bigger In atoms by smaller Ga in CIGSSe films.

To avoid the interference of the possible impurities related to Mo, such as Mo metal, MoS2, and MoSe2 in the XRD peaks of the films, the thin films were simultaneously deposited onto the glass substrate, which show the same right-shifted XRD patterns (ESI, Fig. S1†). The XRD peaks corresponding to Cu–Se compounds (e.g., Cu2−xSe) were not observed in the CISSe and CIGSSe films because they are less prone to form in a Cu-poor condition.34 The Cu-deficient CIGS inhibits the formation of detrimental Cu2S at the heterojunction interface of CdS and CIGSs. Fig. 1(b) shows the cross-sectional FESEM image of the CIGSSe solar cell. The size of crystal grains is found to be 300–500 nm with a film thickness of approximately 1.15 μm. A conformal CdS layer with a thickness of approximately 50 nm can be seen on top of the CIGSSe film (Fig. 1(b)). It should be noted that the as-sprayed CIS and CIGS films are polycrystalline with grain size in the range of 20–40 nm.32 The high surface energy of the small grains is believed to be beneficial for the incorporation of selenium (Se2−) vapor during selenization at 500 °C. The microstructural change of the CISSe and CIGSSe films usually depends on selenization temperature, which was kept constant at 500 °C for all of the films.35 While the selenization recipe was same, it was observed that the grain size of the CIGSSe films was reduced with increasing Ga incorporation, which is in agreement with previous reports.36–38 The densification process was also discussed in the previous report by Ho et al.32 As an example, the CIGSSe film with Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.30, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), has smaller crystal grains than that of the CIGSSe film with Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.20 (Fig. 1(b)). Therefore, the grain size and densification of the CIGSSe films as well as the structural properties were affected by the incorporation of Ga, which negatively impact the performance of solar cells.39
Raman studies
Raman spectroscopy measurement was conducted using a micro-Raman instrument at room temperature to further check the crystal quality and phase purity of the films (Fig. 2). The as-sprayed films (Fig. 2(a)) show the dominant A1 phonon mode at 295 cm−1 (294 for pure CIS), which indicates CIS phase.40 The A1 mode is broad, suggesting the amorphous nature of the Cu-deficient films that is consistent with the deposition condition because all the as-sprayed CIS and CIGS films were removed from the hotplate immediately after the spraying of precursor solutions without further annealing. The slightly higher but similar A1 modes at 295 cm−1 for all the films (Fig. 2(a)) are due to the presence of Ga in the as-sprayed CIGS films, suggesting that the pyrolysis temperature of 300–350 °C is not sufficient for the Ga to be incorporated into the host lattice of CIS films. The shoulder peak at 338 cm−1 could be the ELO mode of CIS. The Raman spectra do not show impurity phases such as CuS and Cu2−xS.
 Fig. 2  Raman spectra of the as-prepared CIS and CIGS (a), and selenized CISSe and CIGSSe (b) films with different Ga/(In + Ga) ratio of 0.00, 0.15, 0.20 and 0.25 on Mo-coated SLG substrate. The inset of (b) shows the right-shifted A1 mode of the films with increasing Ga content. 

Fig. 2(b) shows the dominant A1 mode at 175 cm−1 for the CISSe film, which represents the vibration of Se anions in the x–y plane, while cations remains at rest.41 However, the frequency of A1 mode is increased to 177–179 cm−1 (inset of Fig. 2(b)) with Ga incorporation into CIGSSe films, which is consistent with the linear increase of A1 mode with Ga content.42,43 It can also be seen that the intensity of A1 mode decreases with increasing Ga/(In + Ga) ratio, which is consistent with published data.44 These films also show mixed B2/E modes at 214 cm−1 for CISSe film and at approximately 221 cm−1 corresponding to CIGSSe films. The missing vibrational mode at 260 cm−1 indicates the absence of the A1 mode of Cu–Se compounds, such as Cu2−xSe, CuSe and Cu3Se2, further supporting XRD results (Fig. 1(a)) that the CISSe and CIGSSe films are single phase. The missing broad vibrational mode at 150 cm−1 indicates that there are no order defects compound phases of Cu(In,Ga)3(S,Se)5 or Cu2(In,Ga)4(S,Se)7, which are usually observed in Cu-poor CIGS films, especially when Cu/(In + Ga) < 0.80, further confirming that our CISSe and CIGSSe films possess the values of Cu/(In + Ga) higher than 0.80, validating the EDS elemental analysis (ESI,†Table 1).45 These impurity-free and Cu-poor optimized CISSe and CIGSSe films were used to fabricate the solar cells.
Compositional analysis of thin films
EDS elemental analysis was conducted to determine the composition of CISSe and CIGSSe films. With an uncertainty of <0.1 wt% of the EDS measurement, it shows the Cu/In value of CISSe and Cu/(In + Ga) value of CIGSSe films to be approximately 0.85 (ESI,†Table 1), which is considered an optimum composition of thin films for high performance CIGS solar cells. It also suggests that there is no loss of In in the form of volatile In2Se during the selenization step.46 The benefits of the Cu-poor films are two-folds: first, the formation of highly conductive detrimental impurity phases of Cu2−xSe, Cu3Se2, and CuSe can be avoided; thus, a post-treatment step in toxic KCN is not required.13 Second, the semiconducting properties, such as charge carrier mobility and carrier concentration (1 × 1016 cm−2) become more favourable for solar cell applications.33,47 It is worth noting that despite the spraying of the metal chloride aqueous precursor solution at a rate that allows sufficient time for chlorine (Cl) to escape with N2 gas in the form of HCl, Cl in the CISSe film was previously observed by wavelength-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.32 The high nucleophilic strength of Cl− with metal cations implies that a larger supply of thermal energy is required to decompose anions for generating pure CISSe and CIGSSe films.48 It has been recently shown by thermogravimetric analysis that Cl−-containing CIGS ink continued to lose weight until 650 °C. This indicates that the temperature of 300–350 °C to deposit the CIS and CIGS during spay-pyrolysis and their selenization at 500 °C to obtain CIGSSe films do not completely remove the Cl− impurities.49 More careful investigation on the role of Cl− is required to understand its influence on grain growth and device properties.
Photovoltaic characteristics
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the sprayed films, solar cells were fabricated with different Ga content and characterized as shown in Table 2. As expected, the Voc of solar cells was found to increase with progressive Ga incorporation into the CIGS film. However, the increase in Voc is dependent on the Ga/(In + Ga) ratio, which began to level out and eventually approached a saturation value of approximately 0.62 V. On the contrary, the jsc was found to decrease almost linearly with the increasing Ga content in the film, which is consistent with the progressive blue-shifted onsets of IPCE spectra (Fig. 3(a)). The CISSe thin film was used as a reference showing the highest jsc but the lowest Voc and FF. It has been reported that the Ga incorporation reduces the electrical resistivity of the CIGS film, while the carrier concentration remains fairly constant up to Ga/(In + Ga) of 0.30.33 The incorporated Ga also diffuses toward the back contact, creating a bandgap graded CIGS film that generates back surface field, which greatly suppresses the back contact recombination and increases the Voc of solar cells.50 It has also been reported that charge carrier mobility of the CIGS film increases with the Ga/(In + Ga) ratio of up to 0.40, while the carrier concentration remains almost the same.33

 Fig. 3  
j–V characteristics of solar cells made of CISSe and CIGSSe films containing the Ga/(In + Ga) of 0.00, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25 and 0.30. The IPCE spectra (a) shows blue-shifted onsets of IPCE spectra with progressive Ga increment in thin films, the jsc and Voc (b) show an opposite trend with Ga/(In + Ga), and (c) efficiency and Eg variation with Ga/(In + Ga). 
Therefore, with the increase of the Ga/(In + Ga) ratio, the charge carrier separation and collection of the CIGSSe film are expected to be improved and result in higher Voc and FF. The IPCE spectra show photocurrent response of the solar cells made of the CISSe and CIGSSe films (Fig. 3(a)). As the Ga in the CIGSSe films increases, the onsets of IPCE spectra were shifted towards a shorter wavelength, resulting in a drop of jsc (Fig. 3(b)). Despite the jsc drop, the Voc and FF increments result in an improved PCE. At an optimum value of Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.20, the PCE of the solar cells are 8.15% (Table 2). At this optimum value of Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.20, the Eg of our CIGSSe film was calculated to be 1.28 eV.
The efficiency of solar cells drops when Ga/(In + Ga) > 0.20 mostly due to the reduced crystallinity of the CIGSSe film (Table 2). Considerably reduced crystal grains can be observed when the film has a Ga/(In + Ga) ratio of 0.30 (ESI, Fig. S2†), which may affect charge transport properties of the resulting CIGSSe films. As a result, as shown in Fig. 3(a), the peak IPCE of solar cells drop when the Ga/(In + Ga) > 0.20, implying that beyond this value the charge separation and collection becomes inefficient. It should be noted that the bandgap of the best reported CIGS solar cell deposited by co-evaporation is 1.15 eV, and by hydrazine-based method is 1.16 eV, which means that with further optimization, we may be able to improve the efficiency of our solar cell.29,39 The higher Eg of our film may be caused by the high amount of S existing in the CIGSSe film (Table S1†).
A single layer Mo-coated SLG substrate was utilized to prepare the non-optimized solar cells, as shown in Table 2. Subsequently, we found that double layer Mo-coated SG substrate showed better adhesion properties between Mo and CIGSSe films, and a very thin MoSe2 layer was observed after selenization. Therefore, using the double layer Mo substrate, an optimized solar cells was found to be at Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.20. Solar cells made of an optimized CIGSSe film of Ga/(In + Ga) = 0.20 shows excellent PCE; η = 10.22%, Voc = 0.619 V, jsc = 23.37 mA cm−2, and FF = 70.73% under AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 illumination (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Clearly, the optimized device demonstrates significant improvement in FF that may result from reduced carrier recombination and/or low series resistance. The much suppressed carrier recombination in the narrow space charge region is related to the quality of CIGSSe absorber layer, which generally increases the Voc and FF of the device. In addition, the better electronic properties may lead to a large shunt resistance (Rsh) and low series resistance (Rs), as shown in Table 2. A several orders lower Rsh (589 ohm) than our observed value, as shown in Table 2, has been reported in CIGSSe solar cells by Guo et al., suggesting that the improved FF resulted from the improved diode characteristics.51 When an anti-reflection polymer film (ARC) was placed onto the optimized solar cells to reduce the reflection loss, a higher jsc, consistent with the enhanced IPCE spectra, was observed, which eventually led to the PCE of 10.54% as shown in Fig. 4.
 Fig. 4  Shows j–V characteristics (a) and IPCE spectra (b) of an optimized solar cell made of CIGSSe thin film with Ga/(Ga + In) = 0.20. The usage of an anti-reflection polymer film (ARC) enhances the light harvesting efficiency and photocurrent response of solar cells as observed from an upward shift of IPCE spectra. 
To the best of our knowledge, the device efficiency of 10.54% is the highest among the spray-pyrolysis-based CIGSSe thin film solar cells to date. The spray-pyrolysis technique has the potential to prepare CIGS thin films with large and uniform area. It should also be noted that the highest obtained jsc is approximately 23.5% with the best condition for a CIGSSe film with 1.15 μm thickness. Therefore, the film thickness could be doubled to increase light absorption and subsequent charge separation. To further enhance the charge separation of the solar cells, considerable efforts are needed to enhance the crystallinity of the CIGSSe thin films.
Conclusions
The Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 thin films were prepared by the spray-pyrolysis of aqueous precursor solutions onto Mo-coated soda-lime glass. The use of water as solvent makes the film preparation method very facile and non-toxic, and the films are free of carbon impurity. The properties of CIGSSe thin films were modified by the successful incorporation of Ga. The grown films were pure, which is much desired for solar cell application. Optimized solar cells made of CIGSSe thin films exhibited significantly higher FF and Voc, which eventually resulted in power conversion efficiencies of 10.54%.
