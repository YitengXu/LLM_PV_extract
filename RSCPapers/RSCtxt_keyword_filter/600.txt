    , Accepted 24th March 2019First published on 25th March 2019AbstractThe increasing energy demands and global population together with concerns over global warming are driving the search and development of clean and renewable energy sources such as solar cells, fuel cells, batteries, and supercapacitors; in the last few decades, quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSCs) have attracted significant interest because of their perceived benefits over some alternative solar cells in terms of high light, thermal, and moisture stability; tunable absorption range; high absorption coefficient; multiple exciton generation possibility; solution processability, as well as their facile fabrication and low-cost availability. Compared to molecular dyes, quantum dots (QDs) have several advantages, which have exhibited higher molar extinction coefficients and a tunable photoresponse, resulting in a dramatic increase in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 5% to 13%. This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the development of QDSCs, including the photoanodes, sensitizers, electrolytes, and counter electrodes (CEs), and discusses future prospects for the development of highly efficient and stable QDSCs.

1. Introduction
To prevent the collapse of the current climate due to global warming and meet the increasing energy demands, extensive research has been carried out on solar cells over the last several decades.1,2 For humanity's future and to help solve the energy crisis, solar photovoltaic (PV) technology is one of the most abundant, sustainable and green energy sources because of its cost-effectiveness, easy fabrication, and environmental friendliness. Over the last two decades, the PV market has been the fastest growing industry for its size, maintaining a high growth rate of more than 40%, making it the fastest growing energy conversion technology.3 Solar cells are PV devices that directly convert sunlight to electricity through the photovoltaic effect, which is a physical and chemical phenomenon.4–6Fig. 1 presents the history of solar cells, which can be commonly classified into three categories: first-, second-, and third-generation solar cells.
 Fig. 1  Different generations of solar cells: first, second and third generations of solar cells. 
First-generation solar cells, i.e., mono-crystalline and poly-crystalline silicon cells, are a commercial and established technology for the broad absorption of the solar spectrum, offering high carrier mobility. The PCE of these devices is limited to 33% according to Shockley–Queisser7 and their production cost is very high with sophisticated processing hindering their widespread application globally. To overcome this, second-generation solar cells based on thin-film technologies have been introduced. The examples include amorphous silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), gallium arsenide (GaAS), and cadmium telluride (CdTe).8–14 The PCE of second-generation solar cells is now beyond 21%, and their market share is approximately 15%. These second-generation solar cells improve the PV technology, which offers cost reduction in the manufacturing procedures, particularly with respect to materials savings and low ambient temperature processing. Following these enhancements, thin-film technology has reached the stage of commercialization to enter the PV market.
Finally, after 20 years of research and development, several groups have been actively engaged in optimizing new type of solar cells, which represent the third-generation of PVs. The third generation of solar cells is focused on reaching a high photoconversion efficiency (PCE) per unit area and reducing the cost per watt typically by the development of new materials, such as quantum dots, nanotubes, silicon wires, solar inks, organic dyes, and conductive plastics, as well as novel approaches for light manipulation such as solar spectral modification, plasmonic enhancement, surface texturing. All these kinds of solar cells are of particular interest because of their simple fabrication process and high conversion efficiency. In 1991, a novel sandwich construction of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was first introduced, following the development of the concept in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and this represented a promising alternative cell to conventional p–n junction photovoltaic devices (first generation). O’Regan and Gratzel proposed DSSCs made of a natural dye or organic dye-sensitized mesoporous photoanode, a liquid electrolyte (I−/I3−) redox couple, and a CE.15,16 The cell structure of DSSCs has attracted considerable attention over the past 27 years owing to its low-cost and simple manufacturing processes together with such a type of cell having a number of advantageous attributes (e.g., light weight, flexible, low toxicity, and good performance in diverse light conditions). Up to now, a maximum PCE of 14–15% has been recorded for DSSCs. Further, they have a high potential for commercial use from optimizing a combination of good conversion efficiency, functionality for different applications (flexibility, indoor or outdoor lighting, short-lasting or long-lasting use, etc.), and reasonable cost.17–19 To promote the utilization of photovoltaics as significant energy devices, dyes have been replaced with a new type of light-absorbing material, namely QDs, for the design of QDSCs. QDs are a special class of semiconductor with diameters less than 10 nm that have unique opto-electronic properties, such as band gap controllability by size control,20 high extinction co-efficient,21 large intrinsic dipole moments,22 multiple exciton generation (MEG),23 and easy fabrication process.24 The inverse Auger effect of MEG has attracted considerable interest for QDSCs for obtaining higher efficiency because the MEG process can convert a high-energy photon to multiple electron–hole pairs instead of a single pair in a bulk material, which could be expected to generate higher photocurrents in the device.25 Based on these advantages, QDSCs are attracting enormous attention, and the number of relevant research articles is increasing annually. For example, Zhao et al. first reported an efficiency of 8.21% by recombination control in 2008.26 To overcome the instability of QDSCs, Ren et al. reported an efficiency of 9.73% using metal oxyhydroxide coatings on the photoanode.27 Du et al. produced carbon CE-based QDSCs with a certified efficiency exceeding 11.39%.28 Jiao et al. designed nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbons as a CE in QDSCs with a PCE exceeding 12%, making them very promising QD-based cells.29 Currently, Luther's group reported the highest PCE of QDSCs of 13.43%.30 Recently, researchers have also focused on the development of well-suited electrolytes for improving the performance and stability of QDSCs. On the other hand, recent results have shown that some challenges still remain in improving the performance of QDSCs. To achieve this goal, a number of studies have explored different approaches, such as in situ and ex situ methods. In situ methods include chemical bath deposition (CBD), successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR), microwave assisted CBD (MACBD), electric field assisted CBD (EACBD), potential induced ionic layer adsorption and reaction (PILAR), and electrochemical deposition (ECD). In ex situ methods, molecular linker attachment (MLA), direct adsorption (DA), and electrophoresis are commonly used for QD deposition. Among these methods, CBD and SILAR are widely used for preparing QDs and counter electrodes as they can provide a high surface coverage of QDs with different nanostructures, easy fabrication, low temperature growth, are cost effective, and allow efficient growth according to the deposition time. CBD and SILAR have particularly gained popularity owing to their simplicity and the intimate contact between the donor and acceptors through which the QDs are formed directly on the substrate by ionic species from precursor solutions. This review primarily summarizes the development of QDSCs over the most recent 5 years using in situ methods. The impact of QDSCs can be visualized from the number of published papers in individual years (Fig. 2). An initial growth in published papers can be seen during the first decade of their development (2004–2014), largely stimulated by the synthetic breakthrough in controlling growth and size dispersion, while also passivating the surface using ligands. Remarkably, all of these papers continue to draw a large number of citations. For example, more than 500 papers published in 2015 have garnered good citations so far. The outstanding impact of QD research is an indication of its influence across various disciplines in science and technology. After 2015, the growth of QDSCs slowed due to the stability and PCE issues and consequently, the technology has yet to be applied commercially and extensive research is still being carried out at the laboratory level to improve their effective use. The need to design environmentally friendly semiconductor QDs has now led to the development of QDSCs by optimizing the QD sensitizers, nanostructured TiO2, redox electrolyte, and CE.

2. Working mechanism of QDSCs
The classical architecture of a QDSC shows a very similar structure to that of a DSSC. The main components of QDSCs include a several-microns-thick semiconductor photoanode (usually TiO2 OR ZnO), QDs (sensitizer), an electrolyte containing a redox couple, and a CE, as shown in Fig. 3.31 Its operation involves the following process: (1) if the cell is exposed to light, the QDs absorbed on the photoanode produce electron–hole pairs at the interface between the nanocrystalline oxide and QDs. (2) The electrons from the QD are injected into the TiO2 and the holes concomitantly oxidize the polysulfide electrolyte through the reaction of nS2− + h+ Sn2−. (3) The photoanode is connected to the CE via an external circuit so that the electrons in the fluoride-doped tin oxide (FTO) can move to the cathode via the hole transportation of the redox couple of the polysulfide electrolyte and thus participate in the reduction reaction of the CEs/electrolyte interface. An aqueous polysulfide electrolyte has been proven to be the most competitive QDSC, with the working mechanism of QDSCs reported in detail by many researchers.32–37 Many researchers have focused on modifying the photoanode to reduce the undesired recombination and to improve the performance of QDSCs. In addition, several studies have been conducted to improve the stability by exploiting various QD sensitizers,38–41 electrolytes,42–44 and CEs.31,45–48 Several parameters influence the QDSC performance, such as the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and series resistance (Rs). Under one sun illumination, the PCE (η) of solar cells is obtained as follows:49  where P is the incident solar power on the device, and Jsc depends mainly on the light-harvesting efficiency, charge-collection efficiency, and electron and hole injection efficiency.50 According to the equation, the Voc decay rate is related directly to the electron lifetime. The Voc is the maximum voltage that a solar cell can generate, which is determined by the difference between the Fermi level of the wide-band-gap semiconductor with respect to the redox potential of the redox system.51–53

3. QDSC fabrication techniques
In QDSCs, the fabrication technique is an important area for optimizing the solar cell performance. Several different methods are available to deposit films of semiconductors; CBD and SILAR are of special interest because they represent simple and efficient approaches.
3.1. CBD
The CBD solution growth technique or chemical solution deposition (CSD) has been used to deposit semiconductor nanostructures and thin films and has been applied in industry to deposit CdS buffer layers for thin-film photovoltaics since 1869.54,55 This method is a well-known technique in a few specific areas, notably sensors, transparent conductive oxide coatings, catalysts, thermal barrier coatings, “super-hydrophobic” layers, and more recently, in thin film solar cells. Recently, nanotechnology has played a vital role in all aspects, where nanostructures provide a boost for CBD because it is a low temperature technique and the crystal size is often very small. The preparation of CdS using CBD was first reported in 1884.55 Much later, around 1980, the focus of CBD films turned slowly toward solar energy applications. CBD is traditionally performed in a beaker, requiring only a substrate to be immersed in a supersaturated solution of aqueous precursors, such as metal salts, complexing agents, and pH buffers. This provides for powerful and versatile control, allowing the preparation of high-quality nanostructures, which has inspired many researchers to initiate work in this area. CBD involves two steps, specifically nucleation and particle growth, and the deposition of thin films occurs via the following steps.
(1) Equilibrium between the complexing agent and water;
(2) Formation/dissociation of ionic metal ligand complexes [M(L)i]n−ik, where Lk− denotes one or more ligands;
(3) Hydrolysis of the chalcogenide source; and
(4) Formation of the solid.
In 1993, Liu et al. reported CdSe QD deposition over TiO2 thin films and experimentally improved photoelectrochemical characteristics.56 Nair and Lokhande et al. also reported the application of this simple technique.57–62 Several factors influence CBD, such as the concentration of the reactants and complexing agent, pH, deposition time, annealing, temperature, and spacing of the substrate. Overall, the scope of this technique in the field of PVs is massive. Fig. 4 presents a schematic diagram of CBD.
 Fig. 4  Working mechanism and schematic of CBD. 
3.2. SILAR
To improve the fill factor and conversion efficiency of QDSCs, a solution-based SILAR technique has been introduced. SILAR was first developed by Nicolau in 1985. The basic idea of the SILAR method is to achieve an ion-by-ion growth of thin films, which allows higher control of the reaction between the precursor elements. This method is inexpensive, simple, and convenient for large-area thin-film deposition and it is an extension of the CBD method. In CBD, the deposition of metal chalcogenide semiconducting thin films occurs due to direct growth by immersing a wide-band-gap nanostructured electrode into a solution that contains the cationic and anionic precursors, which then react in a single bath. On the other hand, this results in precipitation in the bulk of the solution. To avoid this unnecessary precipitation, CBD-modified SILAR was developed. The SILAR method is based mainly on the adsorption and reaction of the ions from the solutions, whereby cationic and anionic precursor solutions are prepared separately and placed in two different containers. For one deposition cycle, the bare nano-structured electrode is dipped into the precursor solution containing the metal cation. After rinsing with distilled water, the electrode is dipped into the anionic precursor solution containing the anion, which is again followed by rinsing and drying. This entire process completes one SILAR cycle (Fig. 5). This effective method can be operated at room temperature and the desired QD growth depends on the number of SILAR cycles, the rate of dipping, the reaction temperature, and the composition of the precursor solutions. Table 1 presents the different advantages and disadvantages of the CBD and SILAR techniques.

• The main disadvantage of CBD is the inefficiency of the process that converts the precursor materials into useful deposits




3.3. QDSCs assembly
QDSC fabrication consists of the following steps:
(i) Cleaning the conductive glass substrate;
(ii) Identifying the conductive side;
(iii) With the conductive side facing up, apply two parallel strips of tape on the edges of the substrate;
(iv) TiO2 paste;
(v) Apply a portion of paste near the top edge of the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass between the two pieces of tape;
(vi) Spread the paste across the substrate by doctor blade method;
(vii) Sintering the titania layer at 450 °C for 30 min in the furnace;
(viii) Soaking the electrode with QD sensitizers (CdS/CdSe);
(ix) Preparation of the counter electrode with metal sulfide as an oxide layer;
(x) Putting the two electrodes together;
(xi) Finally, the gap left between the two plates is filled with electrolyte and sealed.
4. Recent advances in photoanodes for QDSCs
The photoanode is also known as the working electrode in QDSCs. The anode consists of wide-band-gap semiconducting metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, SnO2, NbO5, or SrTiO3) deposited on a TCO substrate, typically FTO (fluoride-doped tin oxide) or ITO (indium tin oxide) glass. ITO films exhibit ideal transparency (transmittance over 80%) and resistivity (ca. 10−4 Ω cm) at room temperature and are widely used in optoelectronic devices. For example, Tahar reported a resistivity of 6–8 × 10−4 Ω cm from a dipping method.63 Recently, Chen et al. reported double-sided transparent TiO2 nanotube/ITO electrodes for efficient CdS/CuInS2 quantum dot-sensitized solar cells.64 On the other hand, the low resistivity could deteriorate during the calcination process in the QDSC's fabrication. Preparation of the photoanode in QDSCs involves a coating on conductive substrates using metal oxides at high temperatures, ca. 450 °C, to improve the electronic contact.15 When ITO films are exposed to high temperatures above 300 °C, the sheet resistance surges radically, leading to very poor performance. In addition to ITO, fluoride-doped tin oxide with a similar structure has been attempted. FTO substrates have 70–80% transmittance in the visible range at a thickness of 750 nm, which is approximately 10% less than that of the ITO substrate. The sheet resistance of the FTO substrate is <12 Ω, which is approximately 20% less than that of an ITO substrate. Therefore, FTO-coated glass is preferred over ITO substrates in QDSC applications and they are one-third less expensive than ITO substrates.65 The working function of the photoanode in QDSCs can be divided into two main aspects: (1) when the photon energy from the sun falls on the QDs, the photoanode supports the QDs molecules to transfer the photoexcited electrons from the conductive substrate; and (2) the ideal photoanode should have a high surface area to ensure sufficient QDs for efficient light harvesting.66 Although more electrons are generated, there is also a higher likelihood of electrons recombining at the interface of the semiconductor/electrolyte, which results in electron–hole recombination. The rate of this process should be low to achieve a higher conversion efficiency. Therefore, electron transport in the photoelectrode plays an important role in QDSCs. FTO is used most widely in QDSC applications because of its excellent electrical conductivity and optical transparency. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, a considerable number of studies have been performed using TiO2, ZnO, and SnO2 films in QDSCs to increase the electron mobility in the photoelectrode.67,68 TiO2 is a wide-band-gap semiconducting material (Eg = 3.2 eV) that it is widely used in most promising applications of solar cells, particularly dye-sensitized, quantum dot-sensitized, and perovskite solar cells.69–71 In 2005, Ohsaki's group synthesized TiO2 nanotubes by a hydrothermal method and evaluated the fabrication conditions, such as pH of the paste, temperature, and the electrolyte, for the TiO2 nanotube electrode in DSSCs.72 Currently, TiO2 has become the best option for solar cells because of its low cost, market abundance, non-toxicity, and biocompatibility. In addition, ZnO is a wide-band-gap material (∼3.37 eV) with a large excition binding energy (∼60 eV). Over the past few years, the author's group has focused on designing and improving the QDSC performance using TiO2/ZnO photoanodes (Fig. 6).73
 Fig. 6  Schematic structure of a QDSC with different layers: photoanode (FTO/TiO2), QD sensitizer (CdS/CdSe), electrolyte, and CE. 
For example, Kim et al. produced branched TiO2 nanorod-based Mn/CdS and Mn/CdSe using a hydrothermal method.74 In their study, the Mn doping effect improved the photovoltaic performance of QDSCs significantly with the help of a branched TiO2 nanorod structure. Moreover, the branched TiO2 nanorods structure (BTNR) enabled effective electron transport, which suppressed charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and enhanced the electron lifetime (τe). The amount of QD deposition was enriched with Mn/CdS and Mn/CdSe quantum dots. Owing to the increase in the QD deposition and the reduced electron recombination, the branched TiO2 nanorod structure showed an impressive power conversion efficiency of 1.88%, as shown in Fig. 7F.

In QDSCs, electron recombination plays a vital role between the TiO2/QDs/electrolyte. To overcome the recombination, Kim et al. reported the synthesis of TiO2 nanoparticles coated with three different metal oxides. The UV spectra revealed higher absorbance compared to bare TiO2 because of the higher IEP (high isoelectric point) value. The IEP was used to enhance the absorption of QDs, which resulted in a small increase in Jsc and a large increase in Voc. The barrier layer led to an increase in physical separation of the injected electrons/QDs/polysulfide electrolyte. As a result, the PCE increased from 2.35% to 3.56%. In their paper, the surface modification of TiO2 nanoparticles decreased the electron-recombination reactions and enhanced the absorption of QDs, which increased the electron lifetime and electron transport rate.75
In another innovative approach, Kim et al. fabricated QDSCs using a TiO2 compact layer to prevent recombination between the FTO/electrolyte interfaces.76 According to Choi and Ruhle, a TiO2 compact layer suppresses recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface.77,78 In this study, the TiO2 compact layer thickness was optimized by varying the soaking time in a TiCl4 solution. They found that the conversion efficiency was improved with a thickness of 120 nm.
Myeong-Soo et al. prepared CdS QDs on a (TiO2) nonoporous film using the SILAR method with different adsorption times.79 They found that the surface of the CdS adsorbed on the TiO2 particles was rougher than bare TiO2 and the particle size increased with increasing adsorption time. In the UV-region, the CdS QDs were blue-shifted compared to bulk CdS (512.7 nm), and they calculated the particle size using effective mass approximation theory.80–82  
From the JV characteristic curves, they reported that Jsc improved with respect to the adsorption time and a maximum current density of 7.24% was achieved. The growth of the CdS QDs led to increased light harvesting and decreased charge-transfer resistance (Rct). Therefore, the maximum PCE, η (1.86%), was reported at an adsorption time of 30 min.
Kim et al. reported the elimination of a heterogeneous interface between FTO and nanorods with ZnO nanoparticles deposited in the interstices of the ZnO nanorods.83 In the first method, ZnO seeds were spin-coated on an FTO substrate. The second method involved the growth of ZnO nanorods by a CBD method followed by sintering at 400 °C for 30 min. ZnO nanoparticles were prepared by a ball milling method. Consequently, the composite ZnO nanoparticle/ZnO nanorods structure was fabricated by the doctor blade method. In their study, the nanorods acted as the backbones because ZnO nanorods exhibit high electron transport, whereas the ZnO nanoparticles have a large surface area for QD deposition. The ZnO NP/NR composite structure achieved a remarkably improved performance of 2.44% compared to the others tested due to an enhancement of the overall parameters.
Justin Raj et al. presented ZnO nanorod-based CdSe/CdS/PbS QDSCs.84 The combination of two successive layers of PbS QDs with a CdSe/CdS/ZnO photoanode showed a higher conversion efficiency than that of CdSe/CdS/ZnO. This was attributed to the large accumulation of photoinjected electrons in the conduction band of the photoanode and the low recombination of photoelectrons within the electrolyte. These results showed that a CdSe/CdS layer over the PbS/ZnO NRs array is a potential approach for the production of QDSCs.
Kim et al. also proposed a simple CBD method for the fabrication of Al2O3-coated ZnO nanorods in a CdS/CdSe QDSC (Fig. 8).85 They reported that the core–shell nanostructure enhanced the absorption intensity over the entire UV-visible region, as shown in Fig. 7e. In the present study, the level of QD adsorption increased with increasing deposition time. The deposition time of 45 min achieved the highest conversion efficiency compared to bare ZnO NRs. From these results, the alumina acted as a barrier layer at the ZnO/QDs/electrolyte, which improves Voc by impeding recombination when it is very thin, but blocks electron injection as it becomes thicker.

(d) Schematic diagram of a CdS/CdSe-sensitized and Al2O3 overlayer on ZnO nanorods, (e) UV-visible spectra of an alumina-coated ZnO nanorod, (f) J–V and (g) electrochemical impedance spectra of bare ZnO and alumina-coated ZnO nanorod under one sun illumination (reproduced from ref. 85 with permission from Material Chemistry and Physics, Elsevier). 
Kim et al. treated ZnO nanoflower-based QDSCs with ammonia to increase the adsorption intensity.86 The ammonia concentration was varied to fabricate 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 ml. The UV-vis absorption spectra revealed ZnO NF0.8 to have the highest absorption intensity because it has a stable flower-like structure that facilitates a sufficient surface area and pore volume to enhance the amount of CdS and CdSe QD deposition. As a result, the ZnO NFs containing 0.8 ml of ammonia showed the highest conversion efficiency of 1.30% with a Voc of 0.61 V, Jsc of 6.22 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.34.
In another study, Kim et al. synthesized yttrium-doped ZnO nanorods QDSCs to enhance the light-harvesting efficiency.87 They optimized the yttrium concentration and examined the effects of yttrium doping on the structural, optical, and electron-transport properties. The light-harvesting ability of the QDs was improved by the introduction of yttrium, which facilitated the growth of ZnO nanorods with a large surface area. Moreover, the density of ZnO nanorods increased with increasing yttrium concentration, having a substantial effect on the chemical and surface modification of ZnO. The exclusion of Y2O3 at the surface of ZnO offered an opportunity for enhanced material loading, resulting in PCE and Jsc increasing gradually. A PCE of 3.30% was achieved, which was 44% higher than that of Un-d ZNR.
Myeong-Soo et al. developed a new strategy to improve the efficiency of ZnO-based QDSCs;88 they prepared copper-doped zinc oxide (ZnO) powders by a co-precipitation method. The enhanced absorbance increased the light harvesting, which resulted in sufficient electron generation and an increasing Jsc gradually from 9.074 to 9.865 mA cm−2. A PCE of 2.61% was achieved and Cu doping was shown to enhance the performance of ZnO CdS/CdSe QDSCs.
In 2013, Justin Raj et al. designed highly efficient ZnO porous nanostructures using a CBD method with a Pt and CuS CE.89 Oxalic acid was used to prepare the ZnO nanostructures. An improved efficiency was observed using the same photoanode for the Pt and CuS CE. From the Voc observation, it was found that the Voc decay and electron life time was similar in both CuS and Pt CE based QDSSCs and this observation reveals that the two sets of heterostructure photoanode (Pt and CuS CE) behave almost similar and suppresses the recombination of photoinjected electrons with the redox electrolyte and hence, more electrons are accumulated in the photoanode resulted in improvement of Voc of the cells. Table 2 lists the improvements in the photoanode performance of QDSCs.

5. Recent advances in sensitizers for QDSCs
In QDSCs, the QDs act as photosensitizers, which are usually anchored on the metal oxide surface. They should possess a high absorption coefficient with an appropriate band gap to maximize the harvesting efficiency from sunlight.123,124 An ideal QD has several properties: first, in the presence of sunlight, the QD sensitizer absorbs a photon and produces a photoexcited electron. Second, a crucial requirement for a QD sensitizer is that it injects carriers into the porous electrode, i.e., the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of the QD must be sufficiently higher than the conduction band of TiO2 for efficient charge injection.125 In addition, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of the QD must be lower than that of the hole-transport material for efficient regeneration of the electrolyte. The energy levels of the QDs in QDSCs must match those of the sensitized wide-band-gap semiconductors, which results in facile electron transfer, which is beneficial to increase the electron density on the photoanode and the Jsc. The strategies for the fabrication of high-performance QDs can generally be summarized into two types: in situ and ex situ fabrication. CBD6 and SILAR126 techniques belong to in situ fabrication and are widely used for the preparation of QDs on nanostructured wide-band-gap semiconductors, which provide for a high surface coverage of QDs. In contrast, linker-assisted assembly (LAA) is an example of an ex situ process.127In situ techniques are preferred over ex situ techniques, but it is difficult to control the QD size distribution precisely, and the surface trap state density in QDs is high. To the best of the author's knowledge, extensive research has focused on enhancing the light-harvesting efficiency of QDSCs using different QDs, including Ag2S,128 Ag2Se,129 AgInS2,130 Ag:ZnInSe,131 Sb2S3,132 Bi2S3,133 CdS,134 CdSe,135 CdTe,136 CdS/CdSe,137 CdSe/CdTe,138 Cu2S,139 CuInS2,140 Cu2ZnSnS4,141 InAs,142 In2S3,143 InP,144 PbS,145 PbSe,146 Si,147 graphene,148 perovskite CH3NH3PbI3,149 CsPbI3,30 and carbon150 (Table 2).
Among these sensitizers, Cd chalcogenide QDs (Fig. 3; e.g., CdS,134 CdSe,135 and CdTe136) are preferred because they are more stable in QDSCs, even though they may degrade upon visible illumination. In addition, the co-sensitization of two or three QDs, e.g., CdS/CdSe,137 CdS/CdTe,151 CdS/PbS,152 CdS/CdSe/PbS,153 CdSe/CdTe,154 CuInS2/CdS,155 CuInS2/In2S3,156 CdSe/GO,157 ZnTe/CdSe,158 AgInS2/In2S3,159 and In2S3/PbS,160 is a well-accepted means for extending the wavelength range of light harvesting and/or improving the performance. The recent design of colloidal QD materials offers unique properties, such as immense tunability in the material band gap, the energetic positions of the electronic states, surface chemistry, and efficient multiple exciton generation. For example, CsPbI3 quantum dot arrays with a tunable band gap between 1.75 and 2.13 eV were fabricated successfully and achieved a record efficiency for QDSCs with a certified PCE of 13.43%.30 This remarkable PV performance was supposed to be associated with a small Voc deficit, double the film mobility, and enhanced carrier mobility, which resulted in a high loading capacity of QDs, broad light-harvesting range stretching to the near-IR region, reduced charge-recombination rate, and rapid electron extraction from the special alloyed structure of the CsPbI3 QD films. Another example of copper deficient Zn–Cu–In–Se QDs was revealed by the fact that the Cu content in the ZCISe QDs could remarkably influence the optical properties of QDs as well as the resulting PV performance of solar cells. As a result, the highest PCE of 12.57% (Jsc of 25.97 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.752 V, and FF of 0.644) was achieved using ZCISe QDs with a Cu/In molar ratio of 0.7 under AM 1.5G one full sun illumination. This is one of the highest efficiencies achieved in QDSCs to date.161 ZCISe-alloyed QDs are another promising alternative with a wide light absorption range. A very high PCE of up to 12.75% was achieved.162 Considerable work has been done to make improvements in QDSCs, as summarized in Table 3.

6. Recent advances in redox electrolytes for QDSCs
An electrolyte is a substance that conducts electricity via the movement of ions. The most common electrolyte used for DSSCs is the I−/I3− redox couple.171 Unfortunately, the I−/I3− redox couple is corrosive to QDSCs because of photoanode dissolution, which degrades the QDSC performance.172 The electrolytes can be classified mainly into three categories: liquid, quasi-solid, and solid electrolyte. The most widely used electrolyte for QDSCs is an aqueous polysulfide electrolyte172 because of its good compatibility with sensitizers and superior hole-extraction ability from the valence band (VB) of semiconductor sensitizers,173 which leads to it showing the best performance in many types of QDSCs. The major drawback of using polysulfide in QDSCs is related to the high regeneration rates of oxidized QDs, leading to a low Voc and very poor FF. The main three parameters of QDSCs, (Jsc), (Voc), and (FF), are influenced by the electrolyte. For example, Jsc depends mainly on the light-harvesting efficiency, charge-collection efficiency, and electron and hole injection efficiency.174,175 The FF can be affected by charge transfer at the CE/electrolyte interface, and it reduces the internal resistance, recombination rates, and concentration gradients in the electrolyte.28,29,69,176 Generally, Voc is determined by the energy difference between the TiO2 Fermi level and the electrolyte redox potential. Consequently, the redox potential of the electrolyte should be negative compared to the oxidation potential of the QD sensitizer and should have high conductivity. Some requirements are needed for an effective redox electrolyte of QDSCs: high solubility, high ionic mobility, and rapid electron-transfer kinetics as well as good thermal and chemical stability in the both the dark and under illumination. On the other hand, there are some undesirable intrinsic properties that should be avoided or minimized, such as leakage and volatilization of liquid solvents, possible desorption, and photodegradation of the attached QDs, which limit the long-term performance of devices, which are some negative characteristic of a liquid electrolyte that can significantly affect the long-term durability and commercialization of QDSCs.
To overcome such limitations, researchers have worked on replacing liquid electrolytes with solid-state177 or quasi-solid-state electrolytes,178 with many studies focused on optimizing the polysulfide electrolyte, including controlling the concentration of the redox mediator,179 introducing additives (e.g., SiO2,180 polyethylene glycol (PEG),181 poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP),182 and guanidine thiocyanate),183 and using a modifying solvent.184 Naresh Kumar et al. suggested Ag plasmonic nanostructures and a novel gel electrolyte for high-efficiency TiO2/CdS solar cells. In this report, the liquid S2− electrolyte was replaced with a S2− gel containing fumed silica; however, the gel-based cells showed diminished solar cell performance compared to their liquid counterparts. Nevertheless, the Ag/TiO2/CdS electrode continued to outperform the TiO2/CdS electrode.185 In another study, Duan et al. reported a plastic crystal-based solid-state electrolyte composed of plastic crystal succinonitrile and sodium sulfide (Na2S), which was creatively synthesized using a simple blending approach.186 They found that the succinonitrile plastic crystal accelerated Sn2−/S2− migration and enhanced the kinetics of Sn2−  S2− interconversion.
Feng et al. reported a polyelectrolyte with superior water-absorbing and water-holding capacities, and attempted to use sodium polyacrylate (PAAS) to gelate with conventional aqueous polysulfide electrolytes to construct quasi-solid-state QDSCs.187 The PAAS gel could penetrate readily into the framework of the mesoporous TiO2 film electrodes due to the strong coordination ability of carboxylate groups on the PAAS polymer chains with metal ions, and consequently, an impressive photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of 8.54% under one sun illumination was obtained. Dang et al. developed benzimidazolium salt-based solid-state electrolytes for efficient QDSCs and fabricated a device that showed excellent long-term stability, maintaining 67% of the initial efficiency after 504 h.188Table 4 lists the improvements obtained by electrolyte modification in QDSCs.

7. Recent advances in CE for QDSCs
The PCE of QDSCs depends primarily on the materials used in each component. QDSCs typically involve a sandwich device structure, which is composed of a QD-sensitized photoanode, redox electrolyte, and CE. The CE is an indispensable part of the QDSCs and it transfers electrons from the external circuit into the electrolyte and catalyzes the reduction reaction of the oxidized electrolytes at the electrolyte/CE interface. The impact of the CE on the performance of QDSCs is derived mainly from the material conductivity, high catalytic activity toward the reduction reaction of the oxidized electrolyte, and good chemical and mechanical stability.203 Therefore, an appropriate CE material needs to display excellent electrocatalytic activity and good stability at the CE/electrolyte interface. A Pt CE is the most commonly used in DSSCs because of its stability and superior catalytic activity toward triiodide (I3−) reduction.4,204 On the other hand, Pt CEs are poorly active in a polysulfide electrolyte due to the chemisorption of sulfur species on the Pt surface, which results in large charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface and a low current density and fill factor.205,206
Recently, significant efforts have been made to develop an alternative to Pt CEs, such as using noble metals (e.g., Au),207 conducting polymers (e.g., polyaniline, polypyrrole, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene),208 metal chalcogenides) (e.g., copper sulfide (CuS),209 nickel sulfide (NiS),31 lead sulfide (PbS),210 and cobalt sulfide (CoS),211 CuSe,212 FeS2,213 Cu2SnS3,214 Cu2ZnSnSe4,215 carbonaceous materials) (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene, mesoporous carbon, activated carbon, carbon black, and carbon foams),216,217 and composite materials (CuS/CoS,218 CoS-NiS,211 and NiCo2S4219). Among these materials, metal chalcogenides are promising because they exhibit excellent electrocatalytic activity toward the polysulfide electrolyte, good physical and chemical stability, low cost, and ease of fabrication. For example, new types of nanostructured materials (CuS,209 NiS,31 PbS,210 NiS/CoS,211 and NiCo2S4219) exhibiting high catalytic activity have been developed.
7.1. Copper sulfide (CuS) CE
In 1954, Reynolds et al. reported CdS/Cu2S heterojunction solar cells.220 Later, Hodes et al. suggested that metal sulfides were a more suitable electrode for the polysulfide reaction compared to the conventional Pt CE and these consequently attracted considerable attention as an important component of PV cells.221 CuS is a p-type semiconductor with a band gap of 1.1–1.4 eV, and it is used widely in QDSCs as a CE material. In general, copper sulfide is fabricated by immersing a piece of brass foil in hydrochloric acid to remove the zinc component to form a compact Cu2S film.222 The disadvantage of this method is the corrosion caused by the polysulfide electrolyte, making the CE chemically and mechanically unstable in the photovoltaic device. To resolve this problem, several alternatives have been explored to replace the brass substrate by an FTO substrate.
A CuS on an FTO substrate was developed with hydrochloric acid (HCl) via CBD.209 The different deposition times were optimized and HCl acted as both a complexing agent and improved the S2− concentration against S atoms. As shown in Fig. 9(e), the photovoltaic performance was improved significantly and the optimized deposition time of CuS 60 min resulted in a higher PCE of 4.06%, Jsc of 12.92 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.60 V, and an FF of 0.52 compared to CuS 50 min, CuS 70 min, and a Pt CE. In addition, enhanced light harvesting was observed at longer wavelengths (Fig. 9d). The deposition time played an important role in the formation of nanoplate structures on an FTO substrate. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization measurements were used to examine the electrocatalytic activity of the CuS and Pt CEs. The CuS 60 min sample showed low charge-transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte interface, which resulted in excellent electrocatalytic activity and a higher energy conversion efficiency compared to the other CEs. In another report, Savariraj et al. deposited a knit coir mat structured CuS film directly on an FTO substrate using CBD. They reported that the density of Cu vacancies could be increased by varying the deposition time, leading to enhanced CE performance.223

7.2. Nickel sulfide (NiS) CE
NiS and CuS are two chemically simple binary compounds that exhibit rich phase diagrams with a number of thermodynamically stable crystal structures and stoichiometry. NiS is one of the main metal sulfides and has attracted attention because of its remarkable electronic conduction, slight toxicity, cost-effectiveness, simplicity of fabrication, and variety of valence states. Nickel sulfides with many different phases, such as Ni3S2, α-NiS, β-NiS, Ni3S4, and NiS2,224,225 are inexpensive and abundant materials with widespread applications in DSSCs,226,227 lithium-ion batteries (LIBs),228 ceramic tougheners, hydrogenation catalysts, and supercapacitors (SCs).224,225
This paper reports an effective conversion route for the controllable synthesis of uniform NiS nanostructures via an in situ chemical ion-exchange method (Fig. 10). In this approach, NiS precursors were decomposed thermally in the presence of acetic acid to obtain NiS nanostructures with nanoparticle, nanosheet, and nanorod shapes (Fig. 9(a–c)). The NiS was strongly adhered to the FTO substrate by acetic acid, which acted as a stabilizer and strong reagent in this one-step preparation. The nanosheet-structured NiS CE in QDSCs under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 MW cm−2) yielded a high Jsc of 13.53 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.570 V, (FF) of 0.450, and PCE (η) of 3.47%. Remarkably, these nanostructures were assembled entirely from ultrathin NiS nanosheets with a thickness of a few nanometers. When evaluated for potential use in QDSCs, the NiS nanosheet structure exhibited excellent electrochemical performance due to its unique structure and high surface area. EIS and Tafel-polarization measurements were used to investigate the electrocatalytic activity of the NiS and Pt CEs.

7.3. Lead sulfide (PbS) CE
PbS is an important IV–VI direct gap semiconductor with a bulk band gap of 0.41 eV in the bulk state. PbS (consisting of natural abundant elements) has emerged as an appropriate low-cost p-type absorber layer material for photovoltaic applications because of its stability and low toxicity compared to other lead chalcogenides. Compared to other semiconductors, it has a larger exciton Bohr radius of 18 nm, which leads to strong quantum confinement.229 Most importantly, the optical absorption band of PbS QD can be tuned easily from 0.4 to 1.5 eV, which results in large relativistic splitting in the band structure of PbS, making it favorable for band gap engineering.230 PbS QDs have received widespread attention because the luminescence that they emit can cover the entire visible and near-infrared spectrum, leading to some significant potential applications, such as in infrared detectors,231 solar absorbers,232 and optical switches.233 On the other hand, PbS exhibits inimitable properties too, including a narrow infrared direct band gap (∼0.41 eV at the L symmetric point of the first Brillouin zone), a high optical dielectric constant (εPbS = 17.2), small effective carrier mass (which causes a large blue shift in the absorption edge), and multiple exciton generation effect.234,235 Therefore, PbS is an ideal CE for QDSCs.
Regarding the unique properties of PbS, here, as an alternative novel CE, PbS was applied to fabricate CdS/CdSe-sensitized solar cells via a CBD method. SEM images clearly showed that the size and shape of the PbS nanocrystals could be controlled easily by varying the deposition time (Fig. 11(a–c)). The nanocrystal structured PbS CE in QDSCs under one sun illumination (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) yielded a high Jsc of 11.20 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.560 V, FF of 0.55, and PCE (η) of 3.48% (Fig. 11d). The superior electrocatalytic activity of the PbS 2 h CE was also proven by fitting the Nyquist plot from the EIS measurement and recording a Rct value of 20.28 Ω compared to the Pt CE of 29.91 Ω at the polysulfide/electrolyte interface (Fig. 11f). In addition, the PbS 2 h CE had a longer electron lifetime of 3.04 ms. The concentration of acetic acid plays an important role in determining the size and shape of the PbS nanocrystals in the nucleation and growth process. Some studies have examined the structural, morphological, optical, and electrical behaviors of PbS thin films fabricated by CBD technique, as shown in ref. 236 and 237–244.

7.4. CoS@NiS composite CE
In the pursuit of QDSCs with good PCE, the bimetallic Ni–Co–S with abundant redox chemistry is considered one of the most promising electrochemically active materials, and has exhibited a 2 orders of magnitude higher activity than that of NiCo2O4 and ∼104 times higher electric conductivity, as well as favorable corrosion stability and excellent redox activity compared to conventional single-metal compounds.245,246 Its low-cost and simple fabrication make it promising for electrochemical energy storage and conversion, particularly for realizing practical SCs, LIBs, and as a CE for DSSCs as well as for application in water electrolyzers.
Because the Ni–Co–S microstructure is the main factor determining its electrochemical performance, a variety of Ni–Co–S nanostructures with different morphologies have been investigated. The typical structures include urchin-like and cauliflower-like structures as well as spheres, which can facilitate charge transfer and enhance the performance of solar cells (SCs). Defect engineering on transition metal oxides can be an effective method for generating active sites and for enhancing the intrinsic conductivity. If defects, such as sulfur vacancies, can be introduced into the metallic Ni–Co–S compounds, more active sites and higher conductivity could be obtained and the electrochemical performance of the Ni–Co–S system could be improved further.
In a previous study, the growth of NiS nanostructures was controlled successfully. The performance of these materials is strongly dependent on the valence state and their morphology. Bimetallic Ni–Co–S, which allows facile access of electrolytes to the electrocatalytic centers, exhibited an even higher electrochemical performance than the nanosheet-like NiS reported in previous studies. On the other hand, Ni–Co–S nanostructures reported in the literature have either exhibited low porosity or involved a complex synthesis procedure. Therefore, it is important to develop a facile method to prepare NiCo2S4 with excellent mechanical stability.
In the present work, NiCo2S4 nanoparticles were synthesized directly on FTO glass substrates. First, cobalt oxide (CoO) nanoparticles were grown by a CBD method, followed by a hydrothermal method in the presence of NiS (Fig. 12). The hydrothermal treatment of the CoS–NiS composite electrode showed outstanding electrocatalytic activity and unsurpassed stability in the polysulfide electrolyte, which led to an impressive PCE of 4.70% compared to the Pt electrode (Fig. 12d). EIS, CV, and Tafel-polarization measurements were used to examine the electrocatalytic activity of the CoS–NiS composite and Pt CEs. Table 5 lists the development of the counter electrodes used in QDSCs.

8. Colloidal QDs-based solar cells (CQDs)
CQDs solar cells have drawn special attention as light harvesters in QDSCs due to their versatile optoelectronic properties, such as size/composition-tunable absorption band edge, high absorption coefficient over a broad spectral range, large intrinsic dipole moments, and solution processability. In addition, MEG and hot electron extraction could boost the theoretical PCE of the QDSCs beyond the Shockley–Queasier limit of 32.7%. However, technical progress in the growth of CQDs is most important to construct realistic solar cell structures, which include the use of appropriate materials with high crystal quality, well-controlled heterointerface, and surface passivation. Kramer and Sargent265 methodically reviewed the architecture of CQDs with special focus on the materials and devices. Wang266 reviewed the device physics in CQDS. In the past few years, the photovoltaic performance of CQDs has improved significantly with various device structures, including for Schottky solar cells, depleted heterojunction solar cells, extremely thin solar cells, QDSCs, and inorganic–organic heterojunction solar cells. Specifically, lead chalcogenide CQDs-based thin film solar cells exhibit better cell performance owing to their wide tuneable band gaps covering the visible to near-infrared wavelength regime, arising from their broad exciton radius-multiple distinct facets exposed at the CQD surface. Due to the advantages of a high dielectric constant and extinction coefficient, lead chalcogenides can be easily separated into electrons and holes in CQDs. Recently, a certified PCE of 13.4% for PbS CQDs solar cells was achieved. The family architecture of CQDs is presented in Fig. 13.
 Fig. 13  Family architecture of colloidal quantum dot solar cells photovoltaic devices. 
The properties of QDs can be adjusted by their size, shape, and material; for example, in the size range of 2–6 nm, QDs possess a high density of surface trap states/defects, which degrade the chemical and optical stability. To overcome this problem, Selopal et al. explore a nanoengineering approach to highlight the influence of an alloyed interface on the optical and electronic properties of CdSe/(CdS)6 “giant” core/shell (CS) QDs by introducing CdSexS1−x interfacial layers between the core and shell. Obviously, the core/shell QD architecture offers a reduced density of surface trap states/defects and enables an enhanced spatial separation of electrons and holes (forming a quasi-type-II band structure in which the electrons leak into the shell region, while the holes are confined within the core QD), which significantly improves the quantum yield (QY), prolongs the photoluminescence (PL) lifetime, and endows the QDs with better chemical, thermal, and photochemical/physical stability compared to bare QDs.267
The surface modification of a CQD is an important factor that limits not only the features of the CQD but also the characteristics of the resulting PV device. In addition, the electron blocking layer (EBL) at the semiconductor metal oxide/QD/electrolyte interface is used to prevent the recombination by blocking the hole transport at the interface. For example, Baek et al. reported a hydro/oxo-phobic hole selective layer (HSL) introduced in PbS solar cells to increase both the PCE and the stability (Fig. 14). In this report, they found that a small molecular layer, a p-doped N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(4-methoxyphenyl)-benzidine (MeO-TPD), passivated on the PbS layer could notably enhance the stability of CQD solids.

The device structure comprises: glass/ITO (150 nm)/ZnO (25 nm)/PbS-I (290 nm)/PbS-MPA (35 nm)/MeO-TPD (5 nm)/p-MeO-TPD (50 nm)/Ag electrode (150 nm). TEM cross-section images of the devices. Scale bar: 50 nm. (b) Energy level of each layer in the p-MeO-TPD-deposited CQD-based solar cells. Reproduced from ref. 268 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
The introduction of HSL substantially improved the internal charge extraction, and simultaneously, the hydro/oxo-phobic nature of the HSL efficiently blocked the oxygen and moisture permeation into the CQD layer. Obviously, the durable high electrical and hydro/oxo-phobic properties of the p-MeO-TPD layer efficiently protect the PbS layer, thereby enabling it to achieve excellent stability performance and a PCE of 11.7%.268
The ligands play an important role in CQD synthesis and in the electronic film properties, especially when the diffusion of excitons or minority carriers represents the dominant transport model. Surface ligands generally have an amphiphilic structure consisting of a polar head group and a nonpolar aliphatic group and their main function is to maintain colloidal stability in the solution phase and to prevent CQDs from aggregating during the nucleation. CQDs generally have a high surface-area-volume ratio and the surfaces are prone to form dangling bonds, which increase the carrier recombination and thus reduce the charge-extraction efficiency. In particular, deep traps act as recombination centers, capturing an electron and a hole and ultimately leading to their recombination. To address this challenge, several strategies have been proposed to passivate the trap states at each step in the processing, and in this regard, ligand strategies have been proven to be efficient paths to decrease recombination losses, such as in organic–inorganic hybrid passivation, atomic passivation, and perovskite-matrix passivation. In earlier research, CQD solar cells mainly relied on organic ligands and most these organic ligands consisted of three parts: an inner anchor to the quantum dot, a middle hydrophilic segment, and an outer functional group. The freedom of choosing a functional group gives CQD materials versatility for different applications via a doping effect and these functional groups bind to the cationic metals on the CQD surfaces and produce nonstoichiometric CQDs, resulting in a doping effect. Typically, p-type or n-type semiconductors exhibit doping polarity under anion-rich conditions or cation-rich conditions. Thus, doping can be controlled by using these ligands. Herein, Stavrinadis et al. proposed a nonintrusive solution-based strategy for doping QDs with iodide to further optimize solar cell performance. It was evident that the iodide doping of PbS QDs in solution could improve the solar cell performance as long as it mainly results in n-type substitutional doping and does not cause a significant alteration of the final QD film's surface chemistry. The optimum precursor I/Pb ratio was found to be in the 1.5–3% range at which iodide substitutes S without excessively altering the dots’ surface chemistry. This allows for band engineering and for decreasing the density of deep trap states of the QDs, which taken together lead to PbS QD solar cells with efficiency in excess of 10%.269
The operating principle of any QD PV cell consists of the absorption of light by the active layer, which is important for the formation of excitons, followed by their circulation and dissociation, and then the transport of the charge carriers to the corresponding electrical contacts. To realize this process, major advances can be categorized in to two broad headings: improvements in device architecture and improvements in materials science and engineering. Introducing buffer layers into CQD solar cells can also be used as a band engineering tool and can reduce the density of electron trap states at the interface to diminish this problem slightly. In 2006, Kagan's group introduced a CdI2-treated CdSe QD buffer layer at the junction between ZnO nanoparticles and PbS QDs in a solar cell. They exploited the surface- and size-tunable electronic properties of the CdSe QDs to optimize the carrier concentration and energy band alignment in the heterojunction. Using external quantum efficiency (EQE) and time-resolved microwave conductivity (TRMC) measurements, they showed that the CdSe QD buffer layer reduces interface recombination and provides additional photogenerated carriers, resulting in significantly higher Voc and Jsc values and therefore a 25% enhancement in PCE for ZnO NP/CdSe QD/PbS QD solar cells in comparison to reference cells without the CdSe QD layer. For future applications, these results show that the CdSe QD buffer layer can be applied to air-stable PbS/Se QD solar cells and to devices with structured, nonplanar geometries.270 In this chapter, recent progress in CQDs solar cells has been reviewed briefly. We believe that this review introduces the dynamic and ever-evolving field of CQDs-based solar cells and will prove intriguing to the newcomer or expert alike (Fig. 15).

9. Conclusion and future prospects
In the past two decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to the development of QDSCs to achieve comparable efficiencies to DSSCs. Academics, scientists, the government, and photovoltaic industry professionals are working relentlessly to develop new materials that can improve the performance of solar cells. Remarkably, it is inspiring that the PCE of QDSCs has been improved greatly to 13%, which is comparable to that of DSSCs. This review highlights the essence of the different generation routes of solar cells and summarizes the recent progress in the photoanodes, QDs, electrolyte, and CEs in QDSCs. The main obstacle to the efficient improvement of QDSCs is their energetic loss due to electron recombination at the FTO/electrolyte interface and the limited absorption of incident light. Achieving a high-enough photocurrent is a feasible task. Therefore, the future big leaps in QDSCs will involve rational strategies to increase the Voc and FF values of cell devices. Solid-state electrolytes could be possible substitutes to the traditional liquid electrolytes because solid-state hole-transport materials (HTMs), such as CuSCN, P3HT, and spiro OMeTAD, are deposited on the surface of the sensitizing semiconductor, after which a layer of metal contact is evaporated on top of the hole-transporting material. The obvious advantage of solid-state QDSCs is that they are expected to be more stable through easier and better device sealing and offer higher photovoltages compared to those with aqueous polysulfide electrolytes. The development of nonvolatile electrolytes, QDs sensitizers, nanoporous semiconducting photoanodes, and cheaper CEs will allow QDSCs to gain market share in the future solar cell market. This all-inclusive and edifying communication could serve as a taxonomy for navigating and understanding the research advancements toward QDSCs.

Venkata Thulasivarma Chebrolu
	Venkata Thulasivarma Chebrolu received his Master's degree (MS) from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at the Pusan National University, Republic of Korea, in 2016. Presently, he is pursuing a doctoral course (PhD) under the supervision of Prof. Hee-Je Kim in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering, Pusan National University, and the Republic of Korea. His current research interests are focused on designing novel nanostructured materials and flexible electrodes for energy storage and conversion devices, such as supercapacitors, batteries, solar cells, and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs).

Hee-Je Kim
	Prof. Hee-Je Kim received his PhD in 1990 from Kyushu University. He was appointed as a professor at Pusan National University (1995–2010) and currently works as the leader of BRL (Basic Research Lab.) Group. Currently, he is working as an associate editor of NJC (New Journal of Chemistry) and RSC Advances. His research area is dynamic, multi-objective, practical solution-based research with a focus on highly efficient solar energy conversion and effective energy storage. His research work is related to mainly three areas: (I) fabrication and commercialization of next-generation solar cells, i.e., dye-synthesized solar cells, quantum-dot, and perovskite solar cells; (ii) improving the efficiency of existing solar PV systems using different tools and techniques; (iii) high energy and power density flexible supercapacitors for hybrid energy storage systems.

Advantages
• CBD is a simple and low-cost technique
• Multicomponent films can be prepared
• Intent conversion possible by easy methods
• It is a safe procedure with minimum environmental hazards
• Suitable for large-area deposition
• Reproducibility is high
• Wastage can be minimized
• Operates at atmospheric pressure


Disadvantages
• Doping the intrinsic semiconductor thin films with external dopants at the time of film formation is difficult
• When used for the deposition of ternary and other multicomponent compounds, control of the stoichiometry is difficult
• Selection of the substrate is restricted in CBD
• Deposition of the multilayers by the CBD technique needs to be done carefully
• This technique cannot be used to deposit very thick layers of materials
• Usually performed under low-temperature conditions, which limits large-scale and cost-effective production
• Cause surface defects
• The main disadvantage of CBD is the inefficiency of the process that converts the precursor materials into useful deposits
