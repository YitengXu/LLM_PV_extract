This small molecule having a strong electron withdrawing moiety exhibits a broader absorption band in thin film. The JK216D exhibited suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels, compatible with that of PC71BM, for efficient photoinduced electron transfer. The bulk heterojunction solar cell fabricated with JK216D:PC71BM (optimized weight ratio of 1:2 and processed with CB) exhibited a PCE of 3.60% (Jsc = 9.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.42). The PCE has been further improved up to 5.25% (Jsc = 11.86 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.82 V and FF = 0.54), when the optimized JK216D:PC71BM (1:2) active layer was processed with the addition of 3 v% 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) into the CB solution.
Introduction
Organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have been developing with a quick pace in the past few years due to the number of advantages such as low cost, light weight and large area fabrication on flexible substrates.1 Among the various organic semiconducting materials used in BHJ organic solar cells (OSCs), an encouraging power conversion efficiency (PCE) about 8–10% has been achieved with low bandgap conjugated polymers as the donor and fullerene derivatives as the acceptor in BHJ OSCs2 through enormous efforts including device architectures and optimization of device processing. These polymers have potential applications in next generation solar cells and can compete with inorganic solar cells. However, the polydispersity inherent to polymers can represent a possible source of problems regarding the reproducibility of the synthesis, and purification.3
Meanwhile, solution-processed small molecules as donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells have attracted considerable interest in recent years due to their well-defined structure, reduced batch-to-batch variations, and easier purification or synthesis compared with polymeric donor materials. Since fabrication methods with semiconducting small molecules are more suited to mass production compared to those of polymer based materials. Significant research efforts in recent years have been directed to develop efficient small molecule organic semiconducting materials in an effort to improve the performance of solution processed small molecule BHJ OSCs.4 Recently, SMOSCs with PCE in the range of 7–10% have been reported after the combination of structural design, morphology control and device engineering,5 thus making solution processed SMOSCs strong competitors to polymer solar cells (PSCs).
To achieve the high PCE of the SMOSCs, it is necessary to design the small molecule donors with a broad absorption profile that matches with the solar spectrum, low optical bandgap and suitable energy levels compatible with the PCBM acceptors. The most commonly reported organic semiconductors used in SMOSCs often have push–pull molecular skeletons composed of electron donating groups bridged with electron accepting groups via π-conjugated motifs.6 The push–pull structure of small molecules enhances the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), yielding a higher molar absorption coefficient in addition to a narrow bandgap. In addition, triarylamine groups such as triphenylamine (TPA) and bis(9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)aniline (bisDMFA) can play an important role in stabilizing holes dissociated from excitons and thereby improving the transporting in the device. Moreover, chromophores containing the squaraine (SQ) moiety have also been developed for small molecule based solar cells7 due to their high molar extinction coefficients, intense absorption in the NIR region of the solar spectrum, and excellent photochemical and photophysical stability.8 The SQ based small molecules used in those devices have a symmetrical molecular structure donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D).9 However, asymmetrical SQs (D–A–D′) are more promising candidates relative to symmetrical SQs because of their better photophysical properties.10
Major factors for the design of small molecules in organic solar cells are to keep their stability and good morphology, as well as to have broad and red-shifted absorption bands. To incorporate these required properties, we have designed and synthesized the unsymmetrical small molecule JK216D that consists of the dimethylfluoreneaniline unit acting as an electron donor and alkyl cyanoacetate and squaraine (SQ) moieties as the electron acceptor, the two functions being connected by conducting thiophene and pyrrole units. The dimethylfluoreneaniline moiety in JK216D ensures greater resistance to degradation when exposed to light and high temperatures compared to simple triphenylamine.11 The moiety is also amorphous, helping to keep good morphology.11a,12 The bridging thiophene and pyrrole units are introduced to provide conjugation in order to increase the molar extinction coefficient. The squaraine unit was also introduced to obtain the red-shifted and broad UV spectrum. The alkyl cyanoacetate was adopted in the small molecule because of its capability for intramolecular charge transfer and facile control of morphology.13
Herein, we report the synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of a novel near-IR small molecule: bisDMFA-Th-SQ-Th-DCA denoted as JK216D as the donor along with PC71BM. We have achieved a PCE of 3.60% with the optimized JK216D:PC71BM active layer processed with CB solvent and further improved this up to 5.25% when the active layer was processed with optimized 3 v% 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) solvent additive. The improved PCE has been attributed to the enhancement in Jsc and FF.
Experimental details
General methods
All reactions were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Solvents were distilled from appropriate reagents. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, TCI and Alfa Aesar. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian Mercury 300 spectrometer. Elemental analyses were performed with a Carlo Elba Instruments CHNS-OEA 1108 analyzer. Mass spectra were recorded on a JEOL JMS-SX102A instrument. The absorption and photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 2S UV-visible spectrometer and a Perkin LS fluorescence spectrometer, respectively.
Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry was carried out with a BAS 100B (Bioanalytical Systems, Inc.). A three electrode system was used and consisted of a non-aqueous reference electrode (0.1 M Ag/Ag+ acetonitrile solution; MF-2062, Bioanalytical System, Inc.), a platinum working electrode (MF-2013, Bioanalytical System, Inc.), and a platinum wire (diam. 1.0 mm, 99.9% trace metals basis, Sigma-Aldrich) as the counter electrode. The redox potential of dyes was measured in CH2Cl2 with 0.1 M (n-C4H9)4NPF6 at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 (vs. Fc/Fc+ as an external reference).

Results and discussion
Synthesis of JK216D
We prepared a new p-type near-IR organic semiconductor based on squaraine according to the synthetic protocol reported in Scheme 1. The condensation reaction of 1 with 2 in toluene–isopropanol produced compound 3. The Suzuki reaction of 3 with 1.2 equivalents of 5-formyl-2-thienylboronic acid yields 4. JK216D was prepared through a Knoevenagel condensation of 4 with hexyl cyanoacrylate. Additional details are given in the Experimental section (ESI†).

Optical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 1 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of JK216D in chlorobenzene (CB) solution and as a thin film cast from CB solvent, and the corresponding optical properties are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 1 (black line), the absorption spectra of JK216D in CB showed a sharp absorption in the longer wavelength region 600–800 nm with a high molar absorption coefficient of 119000 M−1 cm−1 at 720 nm. This high molar extinction coefficient may be caused by the stronger intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from bis-DMFA to the squaraine core. The film cast from the CB solvent exhibited a broadened spectrum up to 900 nm, but the maximum absorption peak was red-shifted by around 16 nm, showing the absorption of the NIR. The red-shift and broadening of the absorption band in the longer wavelength region was attributed to the presence of intermolecular interactions and aggregation of small molecules in the solid state. The optical bandgap estimated from the onset absorption edge is about 1.48 eV.

In order to determine the redox behavior of JK216D and determine its HOMO and LUMO energy levels, we have investigated the cyclic voltammetry (CV) of JK216D in the solid state, shown in Fig. 2(a) (oxidation cyclic). The electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table 1. The HOMO energy level can be deduced from the oxidation onset with the assumption that the energy level of ferrocene is 4.8 eV below the vacuum level. But the reduction potential of JK216D was not clearly observed in the cyclic voltammogram. Therefore, we have determined the E0–0 transition energy from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra of JK216D in solution (Fig. 2b). The HOMO energy level of JK216D, estimated from the onset oxidation potential observed in CV, was −5.086 eV. The lower energy is beneficial for a high value of Voc, when used as the donor for the fabrication of BHJ solar cells along with PC71BM as the electron acceptor. The LUMO energy level was estimated according ELUMO = EHOMO − E0–0 and was about −3.436 eV. In general, an exciton dissociation and efficient electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor molecule requires a higher LUMO level of the donor by at least ∼0.3 eV compared to the LUMO energy level of the acceptor molecule.14 The LUMO level of the PC71BM has values in the range between 3.9 eV to 4.1 eV.15 In our case, the LUMO–LUMO offset between JK216D and PC71BM is larger than ∼0.3 eV, therefore, it could be expected that the exciton might easily dissociate at the donor–acceptor interface formed in the BHJ active layer.

DFT calculations
The electronic properties of JK216D have also been investigated through theoretical calculations. Fig. 3 shows the optimized structures of JK216D (for details, see Table 2), which were calculated by TD-DFT using the B3LYP functional/6-31G* basis set. The orbital density of the HOMO and HOMO−1 of JK216D was the bis-DMFA-thiophene-pyrrole core owing to its greater electron-donating strength, whereas the orbital density of LUMO and LUMO+1 was predominantly located between the squaraine and cyanoacrylate unit. These results indicate that the ICT of JK216D was efficiently demonstrated between the bis-DMFA-thiophene-pyrrole (HOMO, HOMO−1) and squaraine-cyanoacrylate (LUMO, LUMO+1) units.

Photovoltaic properties
In BHJ organic solar cells, the relative amounts of the donor and acceptor materials used in the active layer play an important role for efficient photovoltaic performance, since there should be balance between the absorbance and charge transporting network of the active layer. When the acceptor content is too low, the electron transporting ability will be limited, while when the acceptor content is too high, the absorbance and hole transport ability in the active layer will be decreased. BHJ active layers with a blend of JK216D and PC71BM in CB in different weight ratios were investigated and the optimized blend ratio was found to be 1:2, for which we observed the highest photovoltaic performance. We have only discussed our results for this blend ratio.

Fig. 4 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of the JK216D:PC71BM (1:2) film cast from CB (black color). As shown in Fig. 4 the absorption band of JK216D in the JK216D:PC71BM blend deposited from CB was blue shifted by 18 nm compared to that of its pristine film in Fig. 1, but extended up to 900 nm. Moreover, the absorption spectra of the blend showed the combination of both PC71BM and JK216D, indicating that both components used in the active layer might contribute to the exciton generation and thereby photocurrent generation.

The photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy of the blend was measured to investigate the exciton separation efficiency. The PL spectra of JK216D and JK216D:PC71BM are shown in Fig. 5. It can be seen from this figure that the pristine JK216D showed a strong emission peak at 772 nm, which might reduce the possibility of charge recombination in the film state, and hence induces the exciton diffusion towards the donor–acceptor interface, which is ultimately beneficial for exciton dissociation.16 While when JK216D was blended with PC71BM, this emission peak is significantly quenched and the quenching is more effective with DIO–CB. This effective PL quenching suggested that the excitons generated by absorbing the photons would dissociate to free charge carriers (electrons and holes) effectively. Thus, effective charge transfer from the JK216D donor to the PC71BM acceptor took place.17

The current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of BHJ organic solar cells, under stimulation (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2), with JK216D:PC71BM (1:2) spin cast from CB solution are displayed in Fig. 6a (black color) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are complied in Table 3. The device showed an overall PCE of 3.60% with Jsc = 9.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.42. This PCE is higher than the small molecule bis[DMFA-Th]-DiF-BT-HxTh3, reported earlier by us.18 It may be due to the broader absorption profile of JK216D compared to bis[DMFA-Th]-DiF-BT-HxTh3, due to more exciton generation, leading to higher Jsc.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values were estimated from the expressionIPCE (λ) = 1240Jsc/λPinwhere Jsc is the photocurrent under short circuit conditions, and λ and Pin are the incident photon flux and wavelength of incident monochromatic light, respectively. The IPCE spectrum (Fig. 6b, black line) of the device closely resembles the absorption spectrum of the active layer, indicating that both the JK216D and PC71BM contribute to the exciton generation, thereby generating the photocurrent.
The overall PCE of solar cells based on the JK216D:PC71BM blend active layer processed from the CB solvent is considered to be low, compared to the latest developments in polymers and some small molecules. Although, the Voc of the organic solar cell fabricated with JK216D:PC71BM processed with CB is quite high, its poor PCE is attributed to the low values of Jsc and FF. These values are directly related to the light harvesting efficiency of the active layer, morphology of the active layer, charge transport and their collection to the respective electrodes. Since in BHJ organic solar cells, the Jsc value is determined by the transportation rates of both electrons and holes within the active layer towards the respective electrodes, i.e. electrons and holes towards the cathode and anode, respectively. Generally, the electron mobility is much higher than the hole mobility, resulting in an unbalanced charge transport. It leads to the formation of space charge at the anode and recombination loss of charge carriers within the active layer before reaching the electrodes. Moreover, for efficient organic BHJ solar cells, the active layer morphology should have an interpenetrating network of donor and acceptor materials with domain sizes on the order of the exciton diffusion length or around 10–20 nm.19 Moreover, the active layer should have enough interfacial area to dissociate all the excitons generated in the active layer, while also maintaining continuous charge transport pathways to the electrodes. Therefore, an appropriate nanoscale morphology of the active layer is necessary to both above processes for efficient organic solar cells. In general, the typical parameters that affect the morphology of the active layer include the solvent, donor–acceptor concentrations, thermal annealing times and temperature, solvent annealing conditions, solvent additives and the interlayer surface energies.20–22
In an effort to improve the performance of the BHJ organic solar cell based on the JK216D:PC71BM (1:2) active layer, we have used the solvent additive method and cast the active layer from the optimized concentration of 3 v% mixture of DIO in CB. The J–V characteristics of the resulting device are shown in Fig. 6a (red line) and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are complied in Table 3. The PCE value of the device was improved from 3.60% to 5.25% (Jsc = 11.86 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.82 V and FF = 0.54). The changes in the properties such as film morphology and hole mobility will be discussed in a later part of the discussion.
The enhancement in the overall PCE of the latter device is attributed to its increased Jsc (from 9.97 mA cm−2 to 11.86 mA cm−2) and FF (from 0.42 to 0.54) values. In order to investigate the effect of the solvent additive (DIO) on the device performance, UV-visible absorption spectra of blend films and IPCE were measured. As shown in Fig. 4 (red color), in comparison with the spectra of the blend cast from CB solvent, the spectra of the film processed with DIO–CB showed an enhanced absorption coefficient, particularly in the near-IR region. The increase in the Jsc value is ascribed to the higher values of IPCE (Fig. 6b, red color) and broader response of the latter solar cell compared to the former cell.23 The calculated Jsc obtained from the integration of the IPCE curves are about 9.86 mA cm−2 and 11.74 mA cm−2 for devices processed with CB and DIO–CB, respectively. These values are consistent with the values experimentally observed from the J–V characteristics. Moreover, as can be seen from Fig. 5, the PL emission is significantly quenched when the JK216D:PC71BM blend is cast from DIO–CB solvent, the exciton separation is more effective in this active layer compared to that of the film processed with CB solution. The more effective quenching in the BHJ active layer processed with DIO–CB compared to CB implies two possibilities: (i) better exciton separation in the active layer, and (ii) a larger contact area between JK216D and PC71BM through more optimal nanoscale phase separation. The former could be ruled out because the same donor and acceptor were used in both active layers. The latter was thus mainly responsible for effective PL quenching, as confirmed from the film morphology studies and will be discussed in the following discussion.
The performances of organic solar cells using a BHJ active layer are closely related to its morphology. Therefore, we have investigated the film morphologies of JK216D:PC71BM (cast from CB and DIO–CB in optimized active layers) by performing tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 7 shows the AFM height images of active layer films spun cast from CB and DIO–CB solvents. It is well known that smooth morphology and a homogeneous blend with a nanophase separation are responsible for the large donor–acceptor interface area needed for exciton dissociation.24 The BHJ active layer JK216D:PC71BM film processed with CB (Fig. 7 (left)) is relatively homogeneous and nearly flat surface with a root mean squared (rms) roughness of 0.64 nm. But it does not show much phase separated surfaces, indicating that the flat surface does not provide sufficient D–A interfaces for exciton dissociation as well as pathways for charge transport, leading to the low value of Jsc. However, the film cast from DIO–CB showed more aggregated domains and phase separated surfaces with a larger rms roughness of 1.98 nm. The larger domains most likely originated from the enhancements in the intermolecular interactions of JK216D.25 The higher roughness of the active layer processed with DIO–CB indicates that this film exhibits reduced internal resistance and more efficient charge separation in the device.26 A higher surface roughness also leads to increased internal light scattering and enhanced light absorption,27 as confirmed from the absorption spectra of the active layer (Fig. 4). The proper homogeneity and phase separated domain sizes of JK216D and PC71BM in the blend layer provide enough surface area for exciton dissociation and a bicontinuous network, which acts as percolation channels for efficient carrier collection within the active layer of the BHJ solar cells.28 These effects lead to an increase in the Jsc and overall PCE of the device.

The low FF value of the device processed from the CB solvent is due to a number of reasons such as domain size, morphology and series resistance. The series resistance is composed of resistance of the active layer of the device in addition to the resistance of different interfaces. The low FF is related to the increase in the series resistance of JK216D:PC71BM/PEDOT:PSS/ITO, resulting in a high recombination rate.29 The high FF of the device with JK216D:PC71BM processed with DIO–CB is related to its low series resistance of ∼5.34 Ω cm2 compared to that for the CB processed device with high series resistance of ∼8.23 Ω cm2.
In BHJ solar cells, the electron and hole mobilities of donor and acceptor materials play a crucial role, as these should be balanced in order to achieve an efficient charge transport. The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of JK216D and PC71BM in the blended active layers were estimated from the hole-only and electron-only devices from the space charge limited current (SCLC) J–V characteristics in the dark.30Fig. 8 shows the dark J–V characteristics of hole-only devices processed with CB and DIO–CB solvents. The bias voltage was corrected for the built-in voltage determined from the difference between the work functions of Au and PEDOT:PSS. Similar J–V characteristics were observed for electron-only devices. The SCLC behavior of J–V characteristics can be expressed by the Mott–Gurney square law:J = 9/8εμ(V2/L3)where ε is the static dielectric constant of the medium, μ is the carrier mobility, V is the applied bias voltage corrected with the built-in potential, and L is the thickness of the active layer. The average μh and μe are 1.68 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.48 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively for the devices using the above Mott–Gurney law in the JK216D:PC71BM active layers processed with CB solvent. However, when the active layer was processed with DIO–CB, the average μh and μe are 5.72 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.42 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The μh of the device processed with DIO–CB is higher than that of the device processed with CB. This difference is closely related to intermolecular packing interactions, enhanced exciton separation efficiency, and charge transport.31 The increase in the μh, reduces the ratio between μe and μh in the active layer from 14.76 (for CB processed) to 4.12 (DIO–CB processed), enhancing the Jsc and FF and overall PCE.32

Conclusion
We have demonstrated the synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of a new small molecule JK216D. The electrochemical energy levels of JK216D are compatible with PC71BM for efficient exciton dissociations and charge separation. The solution processed BHJ organic solar cell fabricated from the blend thin film of JK216D as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor in the optimized weight ratio of 1:2 (CB cast) showed a PCE of 3.60% with Jsc = 9.97 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.86 V and FF = 0.42. In order to improve further the PCE of the organic solar cell, the JK126D:PC71BM active layer was spin cast from a mixture of 3 v% DIO–CB. The device showed a PCE of 5.25% that was attributed to the enhancement in the Jsc (11.86 mA cm−2) and FF (0.54). The enhancement in Jsc and FF is related to the more appropriate phase separated nanomorphology and improved balance charge transport. Since the blend JK216D:PC71BM exhibited a broad absorption profile, the PCE of the organic solar cell using this blend can be further improved by employing the appropriate electron and hole transporting layers. This work is in progress.
