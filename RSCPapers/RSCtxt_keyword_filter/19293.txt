Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are promising as an inexpensive alternative to conventional p–n junction solar cells owing to their low cost, simple device fabrication process, and high power conversion efficiency (PCE).1,2 A typical DSSC is composed of transparent conducting oxide (TCO), dye-coated nanocrystalline porous oxide (TiO2), electrolyte, and counter electrode (CE). The TiO2 photoanode in DSSCs is one of the most important components, and its role is to act as a support for the dye molecules and as a region for electron transport. Since the performance of DSSCs is strongly dependent on charge collection and electron transport in the TiO2, the TiO2 photoanode should preferably be an excellent electron conductor, and its conduction band (CB) matches the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of a dye. TiO2 can be n-type doped to enhance charge collection and electron transport efficiency within the TiO2 layer. In recent years, for example, many studies have been reported on electron generation, injection, and transfer behavior in niobium (Nb)-doped TiO2 and recombination process of electrons with holes in the electrolyte.3–8 Moreover, several studies have examined TiO2 photoanodes doped with Nb up to a doping level of 20 mol%.9–13 However, such heavy doping is unfavorable for photoanode applications in Ru sensitizer-based DSSCs due to the electron recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Lü and co-workers11 showed an increase in the photocurrent of DSSCs fabricated with highly Nb-doped TiO2 photoanode, which was due to efficient electron injection and transfer by means of the increased driving force for electron injection, namely the difference between the CB of TiO2 and the LUMO energy level of the dye; meanwhile, the open circuit voltage (Voc) decreased with increases in the Nb-doping content in the TiO2 lattice.11
In order to enhance electron injection in TiO2, doping of Nb into TiO2 lattice is a commonly adopted method of tailoring properties such as the CB position and trap/defect level distribution in nano-TiO2.14,15 Nb-doped TiO2 photoanode could be used as a favorable electron-transfer mediator in DSSCs, but it should be settled on the negative effect of the Voc drop attributed to the positive shift of TiO2 CB. In the present study, we have synthesized Nb-doped anatase TiO2 nanoparticles by means of the sol–gel process followed by a hydrothermal treatment.10 The sol–gel technology provides an opportunity to prepare nano-sized TiO2. The doping of Nb in the TiO2 lattice was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman shift spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) elemental analysis. Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were successfully used as the photoanodes in the NKX2677-sensitized DSSCs. They were found to facilitate electron injection and transfer, thus contributing to a significant improvement in the short circuit current (Jsc) of DSSCs, and could also prevent the Voc drop, associated with use of a multi-functional hole conductor coadsorbent (HC-A) (see Fig. S1, ESI†)16–20 developed by our group, instead of the deoxycholic acid (DCA) commonly used as a coadsorbent in organic DSSCs. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study further supported the effect of the NKX2677/HC-A-sensitized DSSCs with Nb-doped TiO2 electrodes and the electron transport and recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.
Experimental section
Preparation of Nb-doped TiO2
All chemicals were purchased commercially and used without further purification. Titanium isopropoxide (TiOiPr4, Aldrich, 97%, TTIP) and niobium ethoxide (NbOEt5, Aldrich 99.95%) were used as starting materials. Nb-doped TiO2 powders were prepared by the synthetic route on the basis of the typical sol–gel process. As an example, the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 sample was obtained as follows: First, TTIP (11.427 ml, 0.2 mol) and acetic acid (2.278 ml, 0.2 mol) mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min to obtain a well-dispersed TTIP solution. Next, 2.5 mol% NbOEt4 was added to the TTIP solution and vigorously stirred at room temperature for 30 min. Deionized H2O (56.55 mL) was added to the precursor solution while stirring vigorously and the mixture was hydrolyzed at room temperature for 1 h. Then, HNO3 (65%, 0.663 mL) was added to the mixture to peptize continuously under stirring at 80 °C for 75 min. To increase the degree of crystallinity, the resultant mixture, with the addition of H2O (15.6 ml), was kept in a titanium autoclave and heated at 250 °C for 12 h. To obtain a well-dispersed mixture, HNO3 (0.336 mL of 65%) was added to the mixture, which was then sonicated using an ultrasonic horn at a frequency of 30 pulses every 2 s. The resultant solution was concentrated with a rotary evaporator to remove the H2O residue and then centrifuged to remove HNO3. Finally, it was washed with ethanol to produce a white precipitate TiO2. The Nb-doped TiO2 paste was prepared according to a typical process.21
DSSC fabrication
The fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (FTO, TEC-8, Pilkington) used as a current collector was first cleaned and pretreated with a TiCl4 solution (40 mM) at 70 °C for 30 min. The paste was then coated on the FTO glass by doctor blade printing, dried at 25 °C for 2 h, and then heated at 500 °C for 15 min. The scattering layer containing 500-nm-sized anatase particles (ENB Korea, STP-500N) was then coated by doctor blade printing and then dried at 25 °C for 2 h and then at 500 °C for 15 min. The resulting double layer was treated again by TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a THF/ethanol (v/v, 2/1) solution containing 0.3 mM NKX2677 and 40 mM DCA or 1 mM HC-A, and kept at room temperature for 12 h. The Pt counter electrode (CE) was obtained by coating a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (5 mM in ethanol) on the FTO glass and heating this at 400 °C for 15 min. The dye-covered TiO2 electrode and Pt CE were assembled into a sandwich-type cell. The electrolyte solution was composed of 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodine, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile.
Characterization
Identification of the crystal structure and phase of the samples was performed by X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku HD-2000) with a monochromatized source of Cu-Kα1 filtered radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm) and a 2θ range from 20° to 80° at 1.6 kW (40 kV, 40 mA). Phase identification was performed using the database ICDD. Raman spectra were taken with an He–Ne laser (532 nm) as the excitation source using confocal Raman microscopy (Alpha 300S, WITec, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a Thermo Fisher Al K-alpha XPS spectrometer. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) was performed on a FEI Nanonova 230. UV-vis spectra were recorded using an Agilent-Cary 5000 spectrophotometer equipped with an external diffuse reflectance accessory. Photovoltaic measurements were recorded employing a 1000 W xenon light source (Oriel, 91193) by scanning an external bias voltage while measuring the photocurrents. The light intensity was adjusted with a silicon solar cell that was double-checked to 100 mW cm−2 using a NREL calibrated silicon solar cell (PV Measurement Inc.). This process was fully automated using Wave metrics software. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of DSSCs were measured with an impedance analyzer (VersaSTAT3, AMETEK) connected to a potentiostat in the frequency range of 0.1–106 Hz and AC amplitude of 10 mV at room temperature. EIS data analysis was processed using Zplot/Zview 2 software.
Results and discussion
The crystal phase identification of Nb-doped TiO2 samples was carried out by use of XRD. Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of the undoped and Nb-doped TiO2 powders with different Nb contents. All peaks of the TiO2 samples can be assigned to the anatase phase, indicating that the anatase nanocrystalline structure is retained after Nb doping, which is consistent with the proposition that the increase in the Nb-doping content in the TiO2 lattice enhances the growth of anatase phase TiO2 and hinders the formation of rutile phase TiO2.22 The diffraction peaks shift to lower theta values with increasing Nb content because of the larger radius of Nb5+ (0.64 Å) compared to that of Ti4+ (0.61 Å),11 in accordance with the Bragg equation: 2dsinθ = λ (Fig. 1b). From the anatase 101 peak at 25.3°, the crystallite size was determined by use of the Debye-Scherrer equation. The crystallite sizes of the anatase phase decreased from ca. 16 nm to ca. 14–16 nm with increasing doping concentration for Nb-doped TiO2 samples, and they were shown to be consistent with the SEM images of the undoped and 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 shown in Fig. 1c and 1d.

In addition, Raman spectra of the prepared TiO2 samples are given in Fig. 1e. Characteristic anatase peaks were observed at 144, 397, 516, and 638 cm−1 for the undoped and Nb-doped TiO2, whereas rutile peaks did not appear; thus it could be expected to act as a good photoanode for DSSCs.

The XPS spectra in the regions of Ti 2p and O 1s sub-shell emissions are presented in Fig. S2, ESI.† The binding energy values, BE for Nb 3d5/2 for Nb metal and Nb oxides are BE(Nb(0)) = 202.2 ± 0.3 eV, BE(Nb(II)(0)) = 203.7 ± 0.8 eV, BE(Nb(IV)-O2) = 206.1 ± 0.9 eV, and BE(Nb(V)2O5) = 207.4 ± 0.4 eV.10 As can be seen in Fig. 2b, the peak positions of Nb 3d5/2 are located at the binding energies of 207.8 and 207. 9 eV for the two samples. It is evident that only peaks associated with Nb5+ and Ti4+ appear in XPS for the two samples.10

In order to investigate the distribution of Nb in the Nb-doped TiO2, EDX (FE-SEM) measurement was performed. Fig. 3 shows the FE-SEM images of the undoped and 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and corresponding elemental mapping. The homogeneous distribution of Nb atoms within the sample is clearly visible (Fig. 3b). As can be seen from the EDX spectra, undoped TiO2 has only Ti and O, while Nb-doped TiO2 has Nb together with Ti and O (Fig. 3c). In addition, elemental mapping of the 5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 sample is presented in Fig. S3, ESI.† A quantitative evaluation of Nb yields 0.24 and 0.32% for the 2.5 and 5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2, respectively.

To further examine the effect of Nb doping on the DSSC performance, solar cells with different Nb contents were fabricated using a NKX2677 organic dye. Performance characteristics of the NKX2677/DCA-sensitized DSSCs based on the undoped and Nb-doped TiO2 with different Nb contents are shown in Fig. S4, ESI† and their performance parameters are summarized in Table S1, ESI.† The Jsc increases continuously with the further Nb-dopant content increase, but Voc shows the opposite behavior. For the DSSC based on the 5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2, however, both Jsc and Voc decreased significantly. The value of Jsc is the highest for the DSSCs fabricated with 2.5 mol% doped TiO2 (Fig. S4, ESI†). However, a negative influence of Nb doping on the Voc was investigated and could be attributed to the fact that the conduction band edge was changed by the Nb doping. In order to prevent the Voc drop in the DSSCs based on the Nb-doped TiO2, a multi-functional HC-A, developed by our group, as a coadsorbent instead of DCA was introduced (see Fig. S1, ESI†).16–20 The HC-A has multiple functions, such as the light-harvesting effect as a short-wavelength light absorption dye molecule to increase Jsc and the prevention effect of the π–π stacking of organic dye, associated with the hole-conducting function, which enhances Voc by reducing the charge recombination process.

Fig. 4a shows the current density-voltage curves of the NKX2677- and NKX2677/HC-A-sensitized DSSCs based on the undoped and 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2, and their performance characteristics are summarized in Table 1. A pronounced increase in the Jsc for the NKX2677-sensitized DSSC based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 was observed compared to the DSSC based on the undoped TiO2. A PCE of 6.37% was achieved for the NKX2677-sensitized DSSC based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2, which was ca. 25.4% higher than that of the undoped one. The intrinsic improvement in the Jsc could be primarily related to the enhanced electron injection of the Nb-doped TiO2 as well as the slightly higher amount of dye adsorption as summarized in Table 1.12 When HC-A was introduced into the NKX2677-sensitized DSSC based on the undoped TiO2, the lower dye adsorption arising from the co-adsorption of HC-A reduced Jsc but improved Voc due to the slower charge recombination process through the hole-hopping process.16–20 Also, as can be seen in the NKX2677/HC-A-sensitized DSSCs based on the undoped and 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2, there is no distinct difference in the Voc between the DSSCs based on undoped and Nb-doped TiO2, but the photocurrent of the DSSC based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 increased significantly, as it was ca. 21% higher than that of the undoped one. As shown in Fig. 4b, the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra exhibited a significant enhancement in the DSSC performance based on the Nb-doped TiO2 compared to those of the DSSCs based on the undoped TiO2. Thus, we can conclude that the intrinsic increase in the photocurrent is primarily related to the enhanced electron injection and transfer ability of the Nb-doped TiO2.

In order to find out the reasons for the higher photocurrent in the DSSCs based on the Nb-doped TiO2, the band gap shift due to the Nb-doping in the TiO2 lattice was investigated by using the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Based on the DRS of the Nb-doped TiO2, a plot of the modified Kubelka-Munk function (where R is reflectance, and α and S are the absorption and scattering coefficients) versus the energy of the exiting light is shown in Fig. 5, which affords the corresponding band gap energies (Eg).23,24 (1)

As shown in Fig. 5, doping also modifies the light absorption characteristics of TiO2. The DRS of the Nb-doped TiO2 samples was shifted slightly to a longer wavelength with a band gap transition. The results suggest that CB has a positive shift with increases the content of Nb doping in the TiO2 lattice. This tendency was similar to the Eg shifts reported by Hirano et al.25 and Lü et al.11 On the other hand, Voc is defined as the voltage difference between the electrolyte redox potential (Eredox/q) and the quasi-Fermi potential of electrons (EF,n/q) in the TiO2 semiconductor.26,27 Considering that redox potential of I−/I3− (Ered) would not change strongly in DSSCs fabricated under similar conditions, Voc is determined by the potential of the conduction band edge (ECB) and the electron density (n) in TiO2. These two parameters are closely related to the surface charge and charge recombination, respectively. Possible factors influencing Voc for DSSCs involve the TiO2 surface blocking, conduction band movement, and electrolyte-dye interaction. Therefore, the Voc of the DSSC based on the Nb-doped TiO2 decreased, compared to that of the undoped TiO2, because of the positive shift in CB as shown in Fig. 5, and similar trend was observed in Mott–Schottky measurement (Fig. S5, ESI†). In the present study, however, the Voc drop in the DSSC based on the Nb-doped TiO2 could be prevented by using a multi-functional HC-A as a coadsorbent (Fig. 4a and Fig. S1, ESI†).
The effect of Nb doping on the electron injection, transfer, and recombination of the DSSCs are discussed below by means of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Photocurrent generation depends on competition between the charge-transfer and charge-recombination processes. Nyquist and Bode plots were obtained at a forward bias of −0.6 V with an alternating current amplitude of 10 mV in the frequency range of 0.1–106 Hz under dark conditions (Fig. S6a, ESI†). Large semicircles in the middle frequency region were attributed to charge transport and recombination competition at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The increase in the interfacial resistance is beneficial for suppressing the charge recombination, which can compensate for the drop in the Voc caused by the positive shift of CB. The NKX2677-sensitized DSSC based on the Nb-doped TiO2 exhibited a slightly low resistance compared to the undoped one. The NKX2677/HC-A-sensitized DSSC based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 also revealed relatively lower resistance compared with the undoped one, and the frequency was apparently shifted to the lower frequency region. The maximum frequencies (ωmax) in the middle frequency region of the Bode plots of the NKX2677/HC-A-sensitized DSSCs based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped and undoped TiO2 were 3.1 and 10.5 Hz, respectively (Fig. S6b, ESI†). Since ωmax is inversely associated with electron lifetime (τ), τ = 1/(2πf),28–33 a decrease in ωmax indicates a reduced rate of the charge-recombination process of the DSSCs. The insulating molecular layer of HC-A effectively inhibits back electron transfer from the TiO2 to I3− ions and prevents the Voc drop in the NKX2677/HCA-sensitized DSSC based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2.
Furthermore, the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs is evidently reflected by the charge collection efficiency (ηcc) derived from ηcc = (1 + Rt/Rr)−1 or ηcc = (1 + τt/τr)−1.34,35Table 2 summarizes the result of the EIS analysis fitted using an equivalent circuit known as the transmission line model,28 as shown in Fig. 6c, while fitted Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 6a and Nyquist plots at the highest frequency regions are shown in Fig. 6b. The NKX2677/HC-A-sensitized DSSC based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2, exhibited faster electron transport times (τt = Cμ·Rt)34,35 than the DSSCs based on the undoped TiO2. Moreover, its electron lifetime (τr = Cμ·Rr)34,35 was significantly increased, which might also be due to the significant increase in capacitance (Cμ) at the interface of the CE/electrolyte solution (Table 2). Eventually, the charge collection efficiency of the NKX2677/HC-A-sensitized DSSC based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2 reached up to 98% and could demonstrate greatly improved device performance. The EIS results also confirm the mechanism of improvement in the DSSCs based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2.

Conclusions
Nb-doped TiO2 nanocrystalline powders were obtained by employing the sol–gel process, and they were successfully applied as photoanode materials in organic DSSCs for the first time. After Nb doping, anatase TiO2 structure was retained. EDX elemental mapping analysis revealed the homogeneous distribution of Nb in the TiO2 nanoparticles. The CB of the Nb-doped TiO2 was lower than that of the undoped TiO2, which could enhance the electron injection from the dye to the TiO2 conduction band, but the Voc has the opposite behavior. On the other hand, the Voc drop in the DSSCs based on the Nb-doped TiO2 could be prevented using a multi-functional HC-A as a coadsorbent instead of DCA. As expected, a PCE of 7.41% was obtained for the NKX2677/HC-A-sensitized DSSC based on the 2.5 mol% Nb-doped TiO2, which was an improvement of 11% compared with that of the undoped counterpart. The improvement was ascribed to the enhanced electron injection and transport efficiency caused by the positive shift in CB of Nb-doped TiO2, and the mechanism was verified by EIS analysis.
