Basic drying principles of inkjet printed features are understood and fundamental correlations between processing properties and film characteristics can be drawn.

1 Introduction
For the preparation of conventional inorganic electronics, vacuum and photolithography techniques are used for a roll-to-roll (R2R) processing, which are cost-intensive and rather rigid processing methods. The introduction of a digital, non-contact and mask-less solution processing technique at R2R velocity would significantly reduce the total costs for the production of (organic) electronic devices.1 In the field of organic electronics, applicable fabrication processes benefit from the solubility of the organic conductors, e.g. conjugated polymers or small molecules, in organic solvents.2 An enhanced solubility of the conjugated polymers is obtained by attaching side chains to the polymer backbone. This enables a cost-effective processing via solution deposition methods, although the molecular packaging of the polymers may be affected by the addition of bulky side chains.3 On account of this, the chemical tailoring of polymers shows an influence on the polymer characteristics, including charge carrier mobilities as well as morphological and optical properties of the processed films.4 In addition, the application of various processing conditions can influence the film characteristics, including the thickness, the homogeneity and the optical behavior. Therefore, each preparation method requires an optimization of the processing parameters with the focus on the application of the processed layers.
The efforts and challenges of optimizing the applied solution deposition techniques to be addressed in the field of organic electronics are of particular interest for organic photovoltaics (OPVs). This research area shows the potential of specific film formation techniques for an efficient and reliable processing. On the other hand, however, also challenges arise that need to be solved, including the drying mechanisms and film formation characteristics. Since not only surface characteristics of the deposited films can be tuned by different applied solution and processing conditions, but also an optimized nano-morphology of the active layer is of importance; OPVs represent the significance of optimized preparation settings. Organic solar cells can be classified by their active layer architecture as layered or bulk heterojunction solar cells, where the donor (e.g. polymer) and acceptor (e.g. fullerene derivative) materials are either deposited as separate layers or from a mixture as one layer, respectively.5 The latter architecture is favored due to an improved charge generation assigned to an increased contact area when the donor and acceptor materials are mixed. For the preparation of bulk heterojunction organic solar cells the nano-morphology, which is strongly dependent on different applied processing methods and conditions, is crucial. As a consequence, the discussion on the drying properties and the thin film optimization is represented here using the example of OPVs.
Krebs pointed out that for further developments of organic solar cells it is necessary to evaluate besides the efficiency values, also the long-term device stability as well as the processing techniques.6 All three aspects need to be assessed in order to develop organic solar cells that can compete on the current photovoltaic market (Fig. 1). In recent research, high-efficiency values have surpassed each other, and currently the highest reported efficiency for a single layer bulk heterojunction solar cell is 7.4%7 and for a tandem solar cell 8.6%.8 Recently, Heliatek reported an efficiency of 10.7%9 for its organic tandem solar cell, confirming that OPVs can reach efficiencies >10%10 for single layer solar cells and >15%11 for tandem cells. The advancement of efficiency over recent years was realized by improving the properties of photoactive materials, like benzodithiophene,7 as well as by the development of new material geometries, like poly(3-hexylthiophen-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) nanowires.12

Krebs, Fabrication and processing of polymer solar cells: a review of printing and coating techniques, Sol. Energy Mater. Sol. Cells, 93, 394–412, Copyright 2012, with permission from Elsevier.6 
The second factor, i.e. the importance of a long-term stability of the organic solar cells, has not been frequently addressed by researchers; only a few reports discuss the stability of complete devices over a longer time period13 and the classification of conjugated polymers according to their degradation rate.14
For the third factor, i.e. the device preparation techniques, research is mainly focused on spin-coating, while a few groups use other solution deposition methods, like inkjet printing or doctor blading. The main reason is that spin-coating is characterized by an easy handling and fast processing. However, spin-coating is not able to be used in an automated fabrication and cannot pattern a substrate selectively. Inkjet printing is, in contrast to spin-coating, able to pattern in an automated and variability manner.15 Inkjet printing and doctor blading reveal a complex drying behavior of the printed features. Inkjet printing, however, shows many advantages, like a non-contact, mask-less and combinatorial processing, wherein hundreds of different materials – or better ink compositions – can be screened, while consuming little amounts of materials as well as generating a low amount of waste. Inkjet printing has been used as an on-demand, digital patterning as well as film forming technique in several printed electronics applications, including organic thin film transistors (OTFTs),16,17 organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs)18,19 and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).20,21 Inkjet printing was also used for applying light emitting quantum dots,22 silver electrodes1 and chemical sensors.23
Besides spin-coating and inkjet printing, solution deposition techniques, like doctor blading24 and screen printing,25 were also used for the fabrication of OPVs. However, all patterning techniques require a continuous development in order to produce efficient devices in a reproducible R2R manner.
This contribution is divided into five sections. After an introduction, various common solution processing techniques, including spin-coating, doctor blading and screen printing, will be discussed regarding their film formation characteristics. In the next section, advantages and challenges of the inkjet printing process will be discussed, with the focus on the application of inkjet printed layers for organic solar cells. The fourth section presents a direct comparison and a critical classification of film preparation conditions and final film properties for spin-coating, doctor blading and inkjet printing. It is discussed that a comparison of these processing techniques in terms of applied solvents or processing temperatures cannot (yet) be done. Instead, inkjet printing requires different processing conditions to yield optimal layer properties. For the evaluation of the quality and resulting device efficiencies little research is reported so far in the field of inkjet printing. Therefore, a critical overview about challenges and possibilities that will arise with the use of inkjet printing is given in the fifth section, which evaluates inkjet printing as one of the prospective applied solution deposition techniques for organic electronics.
2 Common solution processing techniques
Favorable techniques are characterized by low processing costs as well as low materials consumption, but there is a clear difference between lab scale methods and R2R processes. For both types of processing the sizes of the final devices, the processing speeds as well as the possibility to use flexible substrates represent important factors. Whereas lab scale methods are sufficient for fundamental studies, R2R processes are required for the up-scaling of OPVs production.
In order to address advantages and disadvantages of inkjet printing for the preparation of organic solar cells and to gain an overview of the challenges and possibilities of this technique, other solution deposition processes are also discussed here. A selection of techniques will be highlighted that are frequently reported in the current literature. Moreover, a detailed discussion on the drying behavior and the film formation characteristics will be presented. A detailed technical summary of a few preparation methods with the main focus on R2R processes was recently presented by Krebs.6
In the research area of organic photovoltaics the interaction between working principles and processing conditions is not yet fully understood. Despite the many published studies that show improvements and new developments, the fundamental correlations between processing conditions and the utilized polymers for organic solar cells are not elucidated. Once a good process is found for a donor–acceptor, i.e. a polymer–fullerene blend, it does not automatically imply that it will also work for other donor–acceptor combinations in a similar way, or sometimes at all. Every polymer (class) requires therefore a special processing and post-production treatment to perform well as a donor material. The reason why several methods are currently discussed in the literature is based on the fact that different active layer materials require different processing methods and conditions for an optimized device performance. A selection of these processing techniques that are used as lab-scale processes for fundamental studies, including spin-coating, doctor blading and screen printing, will be described in the following sections and compared to inkjet printing.
2.1 Spin-coating
Spin-coating is an often discussed processing technique in the open literature. The reasons can be found in the ease of handling, reproducibility and applicability of a wide variety of materials. First of all, the process of spin-coating is characterized by a high simplicity and by the easy deposition of the solute material onto a rotating substrate (Fig. 2). This technique reveals homogeneous films in a very reproducible way with little investments for the equipment. However, a significant disadvantage is the one-by-one operation of this technique. Only one substrate can be coated at a time and it needs to be changed manually when moving to the next substrate. Therefore, a fast and automated processing is not possible with this technique, which is the reason why spin-coating is not applicable for a R2R processing. Secondly, most of the applied material (>90%) is wasted due to the ejection of solution from the substrate during rotation.22 Although only a little amount of material is required for the preparation of a spin-coated film, the high waste consumption is a clear drawback of this technique.6

During spin-coating centrifugal forces induce a strong sheering of the coating solution. Due to a radial flow most of the material is ejected and the film becomes thinner until equilibrium is reached, which is determined by the spin speed and the increase in solution viscosity. The final film thickness, which can be adjusted by the solute concentration and the applied spin speed, is reached when the solvent is evaporated.26 The film thickness increases with increasing concentration as well as with decreasing spin speed. It was found that solvents with a higher vapor pressure result in thicker films than solvents with lower volatilities, while using the same concentration for the coating solution.27
When applying spin-coated polymer films in electronic devices, relationships between coating parameters and the final device characteristics can be evaluated. For spin-coated films these correlations are well understood for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs).
The morphology of a spin-coated layer is, besides the processing conditions, dependent on the solvent. It is known that polymers in solution tend to aggregate above a certain concentration and that this behavior is strongly influenced by the polymer class. For example, at concentrations below 0.4% the polymer poly[2-methoxy-5-(2′-ethyl-hexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) shows no aggregation, while it is highly aggregated at concentrations >1%.28 It was discussed by Shi et al. that the morphology of MEH-PPV films can be varied in the region between these two concentrations for loose aggregation (CLA) by changing the spin speed. By using low concentrations the loose polymer chains tend to stretch due to the effective radial flow, resulting in films that show absorption at higher wavelengths due to an improved packing of the polymer chains and enhanced conjugation. In contrast, when coating from highly concentrated solutions, the radial flow is not strong enough to break the polymer aggregates, which results in a coiled polymer chain with a reduced conjugation and, as a consequence, absorption at lower wavelengths is observed.28 Subsequently, the optical and electronic properties can be tuned by preparing thin films from solutions having the prescribed intermediate concentration, which is also dependent on the molar mass of the polymer and the solvent.
Furthermore, by screening thin film properties of spin-coated polymer layers it was found that the emission color of spin-coated films depends on the drying time. At lower spin speeds and, thus, with a longer drying time, the polymer coils are entangled and the formation of interchain species is preferred, which leads to a red-shift as well as to additional aggregation peaks at higher wavelengths in the emission spectra.29
For the investigation of field-effect mobilities of conjugated polymers, e.g. of P3HT, in spin-coated films, it was discussed that the boiling point of the processing solvent represents another critical processing parameter due to the resulting drying time of the processed films.30 Whereas low-boiling solvents lead to a drying within seconds, high-boiling solvents increased the drying time to a few minutes, which was found to be sufficient for the self-organization of the polymer into the thermodynamically favored structure and for improved electrical properties. As a result, the microstructure of P3HT can be controlled by the choice of solvent, as high-boiling solvents lead to a higher degree of P3HT crystallization. A comparison between spin-coated and drop-cast films was performed by Larsen and coworkers using the same processing solvent.27 Drop-casting resulted in higher charge carrier mobilities than spin-coating, which was caused by the longer drying times for drop-cast films. Hence, film morphologies as well as electrical properties can be tuned by different drying speeds originating from the preparation method itself.
In addition, DeLongchamp et al. investigated the orientation of P3HT chains as a function of the spin speed. The authors discussed the relationship between the obtained crystal structure and the drying speed at varied spin velocities. With increased spin speed, the orientation of P3HT changes from edge-on to plane-on orientations (Fig. 3).31 Therefore, not only the crystallinity of P3HT is affected by the drying speed, but also the orientation distribution of the polymer chains.32

For the preparation of solution-processed active layers in OPVs, spin-coating is currently the most frequently reported technique in the literature to obtain thin and homogeneous films with a well segregated film morphology. It was found for spin-coating of P3HT/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) mixtures that slower drying results in improved solar cell performances due to an increased hole-mobility of the P3HT polymer.33 Therefore, a higher boiling solvent, for example ortho-dichlorobenzene (oDCB), is preferred over lower boiling solvents, like chloroform. This approach revealed balanced charge carrier mobilities for P3HT and PCBM, leading to a more optimized charge transport in the solar cell. Li et al. investigated OPV performances of spin-coated P3HT/PCBM films as a function of the drying time. Improved solar cell characteristics were found when the films were dried very slowly (∼20 minutes) and, as a result, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) is 65%, whereas a fast evaporation of the solvent (∼20 seconds) revealed an EQE of only 19%, resulting in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 3.5% and 1.4%, respectively (Fig. 4).34 The authors discussed that P3HT is highly ordered due to the slow drying, showing enhanced optical as well as charge carrier mobilities, which leads to a balanced charge transport in the active layer.

Recently, Dang et al. studied the role of the used solvents for spin-coating P3HT/PCBM blends. Six different solvents with different boiling points, ranging from 61 to 214 °C, were investigated (see Fig. 5a).35 A red-shifted and strongly structured absorption of the P3HT/PCBM layer was observed with increasing boiling point of the processing solvent, which is consistent with earlier reports.30 Although a rough film surface is observed when using solvents with a boiling point above 150 °C, a clear phase separation was observed, which led to increased solar cell efficiencies (Fig. 5b). This study shows that within a used processing method, the choice of the applied solvent has a significant effect on the resulting film absorption and morphology. Layer properties must therefore be optimized by the correct choice of solvent as well as the processing conditions.

Another approach for improving the morphology of an active layer is to use a post-processing treatment. The crystalline polymer P3HT showed enhanced chain packaging after thermal annealing of the prepared film. Treat et al. reported highly efficient OPVs built from P3HT/PCBM due to an increased P3HT-crystallinty and improved photoconversion efficiencies upon thermal treatment.36 For amorphous polymers it was recently reported that improved morphologies and efficiencies were obtained by adding a small amount of 1,8-octanedithiol, which has a relatively high boiling point as well as a selective solubility for polymers and fullerenes.37
2.2 Doctor blading
As a second lab-scale technique, doctor blading is used for the preparation of the active layer for organic solar cells. With this method, a well-defined film thickness can be obtained by moving a sharp plate at a fixed distance over the substrate to be coated (Fig. 6). A disadvantage of this contact deposition technique is the large amount of waste that remains on the sharp plate after processing. Doctor blading is similar to spin-coating, in terms of cost-effectiveness and complexity, but is much slower in terms of processing.6
 Fig. 6  Schematic representation of the doctor blading process. 
For doctor blading, as well as for inkjet printing, which will be discussed in a later section, the wetting behavior of the coating solution is an important factor. For a good wetting, which results in a good film formation, the surface tension of the coating solution needs to be lower than the substrate surface energy.38 The homogeneity of bladed films depends on the solute concentration and the coating speed.39 Wang et al. identified three different stages during the drying of a doctor bladed film. After a fast evaporation step of the solvent, until a solute content of approximately 50%, a rapid crystallization takes place, followed by a slow evaporation and a slow crystallization.40
Schmidt-Hansberg and coworkers investigated the optical properties of P3HT/PCBM films prepared by doctor blading from oDCB as a function of the drying speed. The authors reported that a more featured and red-shifted absorption is obtained upon a slow drying process.39 At reduced coating temperatures, a slow drying was observed for doctor bladed P3HT/PCBM films prepared from chlorobenzene, which resulted in a preferred morphology due to slower crystallization kinetics. Despite a longer drying time, the obtained films revealed a rough film surface. At increased temperatures, a stronger phase separation was observed attended by a decreasing surface roughness.24 Subsequently, improved solar cell performances were achieved by decreasing the substrate temperature, which resulted in a PCE of 2.1% at 15 °C.41 Other research groups, however, obtained different results; for the same polymer/fullerene system, but with different solvents, including toluene and tetralin, an optimum substrate temperature of 60 °C was found to reveal a high efficiency. Toluene and tetralin resulted in a PCE of 3.8%42 and 3.3%,43 respectively. Both solvents, toluene (bp 110 °C) and tetralin (bp 205 °C), have a significant difference in their boiling points that cause different drying speeds of the bladed films.
Therefore, it can be concluded that an optimum layer morphology is not only dependent on the drying speed, but also on the used solvents as well as the resulting rheological properties. These findings indicate that a prediction of best processing parameters cannot be given at this point, and further investigations are required to understand the influence of the processing conditions for this particular coating technique.
Knife-over-edge coating is the R2R equivalent to doctor blading, where the knife is stationary and the substrate is moving during coating. By using this technique, smooth films were obtained in a reasonable production time by transferring the know-how obtained from doctor blading to this process.6
2.3 Screen printing
As a third technique, screen printing has been reported for the preparation of the active layers for solar cells. This technique forces the ink through a screen by applying pressure with a squeegee (Fig. 7)44 and results in the formation of homogeneous films. However, large film thicknesses and long drying times are observed. This method is highly R2R compatible by using a rotational screen printer, but additional costs arise, for example, when changing the printing layout, which requires a unique screen and needs to be changed every time the layout changes. The inks entail a high viscosity and more waste is produced during processing; the material remains on the screen and the squeegee after processing.

Krebs et al. showed that the R2R production of flexible organic solar cells is possible by screen printing.25 Using this technique, the devices were able to be prepared in large scale as well as under ambient conditions. Furthermore, the exclusion of the expensive indium-tin-oxide (ITO) ensured the demonstration of a cost-effective and green processing.2 A major drawback of this technique is the lack of possibilities for morphology as well as film thickness optimization, which results in low OPV efficiencies.
3 Inkjet printing – control of features morphology
For a detailed understanding of the preparation techniques as well as to evaluate whether inkjet printing has the potential for producing high-efficiency solar cells, the drying processes and resulting film morphologies need to be well understood. This will be further discussed in this section for inkjet printed droplets, lines and films. The requirements and characteristics of the droplet generation as well as the impact of the droplets on the substrate were reviewed elsewhere.45,46 Here, the focus will be on drying processes and the resulting film properties.
3.1 Inkjet printing characteristics
Inkjet printing represents an accurate and reproducible film preparation technique, which relies on the formation of individual droplets that are ejected from a nozzle. The subsequent drop coalescence at the substrate depends on the dot spacing, which is defined as the center-to-center distance between two adjacent droplets, and forms the final printing patterns (Fig. 8). The ejected sub-nanoliter droplets have a diameter approximately equal to the size of the nozzle orifice and can be slightly adjusted by the operating conditions.47
 Fig. 8  Schematic representation of variations in dot spacing, indicated by the arrow: (a) single droplets when the dot spacing in the x- and y-direction is larger than the droplet diameter on the substrate, (b) horizontal lines when the dot spacing in the x-direction is reduced and (c) vertical lines for a reduced dot spacing in the y-direction. Continuous films (d) are formed when in both x- and y-directions the dot spacings are smaller than the droplet diameter on the substrate. Reprinted with permission from ref. 50. 
Inkjet printing has not yet attracted as much interest as spin-coating for the preparation of OPVs, which can be ascribed to a more complex film preparation and drying process. For inkjet printing, all solute parameters have a significant influence on the preparation of the printed patterns, which makes the ink development crucial. Important factors include the ink viscosity and surface tension as well as the nozzle diameter. Compared to other solution processing techniques, inkjet printing is characterized by high material efficiency; only small amounts of materials are required and only a little waste is produced. Inkjet printing allows an instant change of the printing pattern by the printer software. Therefore, no masks or lithography steps are required, which decreases the processing costs significantly. Depending on the number of operating nozzles (1 to 128 for lab scale inkjet printers) the printing speed can be varied. By means of inkjet printing, features with a thickness of several tens of nanometers up to multiple tens of micrometers can be produced in a reproducible manner.48,49 When using multiple nozzles and print heads, a high speed production of thin films can be performed. However, up to now, no reports are available in the open literature that discuss inkjet printing as a R2R coating technique.
For a lab scale technique, which provides fundamental knowledge, a combinatorial screening of materials and parameters is crucial to assure reproducibility as well as reliability. A large number of printing parameters influences the morphology and homogeneity of active layers, and it is not possible to investigate each single parameter individually and in a decent amount of time.51 Not only process-depending parameters, like the dot spacing for inkjet printing, need to be optimized, but also the solvent/solute parameters, like the used solvent(s) and concentration. Several studies report the optimization of single parameters: concentration,52 solvent system,20 blend ratio,53 dot spacing,54 and substrate temperature,40 but in most cases a combinatorial screening was not performed, which leaves possible synergies between the parameters undiscovered. Consequently, the results are difficult to compare. Therefore, a large number of crucial parameters need to be evaluated in a systematic screening in order to identify the optimal parameters for the used film preparation technique.
Renz et al. showed a multiparametric optimization of spin-coated P3HT/PCBM films by the variation of PCBM content, spin time and annealing time.55 This study shows a comprehensive optimization of the mentioned parameters with respect to their morphological properties and, most importantly, solar cell characteristics. With the subsequent investigation how each variation of the parameters affects the solar cell results, a screening is given, which is only limited by the non-automated processing via spin-coating.
In contrast, inkjet printing allows a fast, easy and reproducible screening of compound libraries, for example, of conjugated polymers,56 CdTe nanoparticles,57 as well as of polymer/fullerene blends for OPVs.58 Teichler et al. presented a screening workflow that included the ink preparation with a pipetting robot, the thin-film library preparation by using inkjet printing and the characterization of the produced compound libraries by using high-throughput analytical tools, including UV/vis plate readers (Fig. 9).20 Hereby, a complete combinatorial screening of solute properties and their influence on the thin-film properties of the inkjet printed films was introduced. Subsequently, structure–property relationships were evaluated that lead to optimized processing conditions for the used polymer/fullerene combinations as well as to the elucidation of synergies that may exist between different parameters.

3.2 Drying processes
Not only the solution properties, like the solvent and the concentration, have an effect on the rheological properties of the coating solution, but also the used coating process itself has an influence on the final film characteristics.59 As concluded from the previous section, the processing time has a significant effect on the final morphology. The drying time is determined by the boiling point of the used solvent and the applied processing technique. Whereas spin-coating is seen as being a fast drying method, doctor blading and inkjet printing are techniques where the film drying proceeds at a longer time scale. Therefore, by choosing one of the latter preparation techniques, one has to take into account that the best working conditions, like solvents and concentrations that show a good film forming performance, cannot be adapted easily to another processing technique. In fact, the control over the obtained morphology represents a complicated interaction between various parameters and cannot be predicted easily.
In the previous section, the importance of the drying speed of the prepared films was discussed for spin-coating and doctor blading. The drying speed is also crucial for a successful inkjet printing procedure. Individual inkjet printed sub-nanoliter droplets dry in a fraction of a second, while the drying speed of an inkjet printed film strongly depends on the thickness of the film and, hence, the number of placed droplets. In this case, the drying of a film may take several minutes, which explains why inkjet printing is characterized as a slow drying process in contrast to spin-coating. The following section will discuss the detailed analysis of the drying and solidification behavior of different printing solutions and their influence on the morphology of the final features.

Coffee drop effect. 
One of the main challenges in the inkjet printing process is to gain control over the resulting film homogeneity during drying. A complete understanding of processes taking place in a drying droplet is very complex, and the coffee drop effect and Marangoni flow are both considered to be important factors. Therefore, a prediction of the resulting film characteristics is at this point rather difficult and strongly depends on the system as well as the features' size. The so-called coffee-drop-effect,60 which describes the accumulation of solute material at the rim of a drying droplet, is a result of an inhomogeneous evaporation of the solvent and of a pinned contact line (Fig. 10a).61 Several mechanisms have been reported to minimize the coffee-drop-effect and mostly rely on the controlled evaporation of the solvent.

First, coffee rings can be reduced by an increased vapor pressure around the drying feature. Kajiya et al. showed that an enhanced drying pattern was obtained by exposing the drying droplet to an increased solvent vapor.62 Furthermore, Park et al. found that for this so-called solvent vapor, annealing a high-boiling solvent with a high surface tension is required to improve the rearrangement of the deposited material.63
As a second solution to the coffee-drop effect, a more feasible approach is suggested by printing from a solvent mixture, in which the main solvent has a lower boiling point and a higher surface tension than the co-solvent.64 Typically, the minor component of the solvent mixture is added in a few tens of volume percentages.61 During the drying of the printed feature, i.e. a droplet, a line or a film, the low boiling solvent evaporates first at the contact line, which leads to an outward flow of the solvent carrying solute towards the edge. Therefore, the addition of the high-boiling solvent strongly reduces the evaporation of the solvent at the edges, since the amount of high-boiling solvent is here locally higher than that of the low-boiling solvent. At the same time, a surface tension gradient is induced in the printed feature that leads to an inward flow of material – the so-called Marangoni flow.65 A resulting circulation of the material leads to a homogeneous material distribution (Fig. 10b).
Finally, the drying speed of a printed feature can be controlled by creating a temperature difference between the ink and the surface. By increasing the substrate temperature from 25 to 60 °C for the inkjet printing of an aqueous poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS) ink, an improved drying pattern and a reduction of the droplet width from 100 μm to 65 μm were observed by Zhou et al., which were explained by the reduced time for a complete spreading.66 It is believed that an increased substrate temperature stimulates solvent evaporation, which reduces the in-flight droplet diameter as well as the impact diameter at the substrate, and, as a consequence, the spreading of the droplet.67 However, other reports that used other materials revealed the appearance of drying inhomogeneities when the substrate temperature was set too high.54,68 Therefore, the substrate temperature needs to be carefully screened for each ink and substrate combination in order to form homogeneous surfaces.


Controlling line and film formation. 
When droplets are inkjet printed close to each other, lines or films are formed upon drop coalescence that show a more complex dependence on the printing parameters. In the case of printing lines, the dot spacing, or drop-to-drop distance, of the droplets results in different line morphologies, as shown in Fig. 11. When the dot spacing is chosen too small, bulging effects, as depicted in Fig. 11a, will appear due to too much deposited material, whereas a large dot spacing results in scalloped but continuous lines (Fig. 11c) or individual droplets (Fig. 11d). Only when the dot spacing is optimized are homogeneous and continuous lines formed (Fig. 11b).61

However, the dot spacing is just one of the factors that determine the quality of inkjet printed lines or films. In fact, many parameters have an influence on the film formation, including the solute concentration, the solvent as well as the substrate temperature. All parameters require an optimization for each polymer class to reveal homogeneous features.
Teichler et al. discussed the elucidation of optimized film qualities by the preparation of a poly(phenylene-ethynylene)–poly(phenylene-vinylene) (PPE–PPV) library. The best film quality was observed for a concentration of 4 mg mL−1, a solvent system of toluene/oDCB 90/10 and inkjet printing at ambient conditions.54 A faster drying, induced either by a reduction of the high boiling solvent oDCB or by an increased substrate temperature, led to a reduction of the film homogeneity. Furthermore, an increase in the solute concentration does not show a positive effect on the film quality. The report demonstrates that optimized processing conditions can be revealed easily by using inkjet printing. However, a simple prediction of the best printing parameters has not been given so far.
At this point, it is worth mentioning that printing conditions, which result in the best film homogeneity, are not automatically the best printing parameters for a desired application. For instance, inkjet printing performed from a specific solution results in a homogeneous film with a typical film thickness, but the properties of the inkjet printed features are strongly dependent on the layer thickness. For example, a red-shifted polymer emission as well as a change in the shape of the emission peaks was found for thicker films, indicating more pronounced inter-chain interactions.56,69 Furthermore, another discrepancy arises when the obtained film thickness that shows the best film quality is too thick for a desired application. In particular, the active layers for solar cells should have a thickness between 100 and 200 nm.5 However, the approach to vary the dot spacing to adjust for the required film thickness may not result in homogeneous layers. Therefore, ink properties, like the concentration, need to be changed and, consequently, a new ink has to be developed, which again requires optimization of the printing parameters. The elucidation of best layer as well as application properties represents a complex interaction between the solution and the printing characteristics that, in addition, needs to be adjusted for the desired application of the inkjet printed feature. Preferably, a combinatorial screening of each parameter is then performed to identify synergies between multiple parameters as well as to speed up the investigation.
The importance of the solvent system used in the inkjet printing process on the film properties of semi-crystalline TIPS-pentacene was recently reported by Madec et al.70 The authors found a significant change in morphology as well as a strong increased hole-mobility due to an increased crystallinity simply by adding 10% of a higher boiling solvent to the main solvent. Furthermore, Chung et al. performed inkjet printing of TIPS-pentacene from the high boiling solvent propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PEGMEA, bp 145 °C) and found charge carrier mobilities similar to those for drop-casting, but significantly higher than for spin-coating.71 This result indicates that a slower drying process reveals an improved material crystallinity.
Moreover, for the active layer of an organic solar cell the solvent and the drying time play a critical role, since only a well-segregated nano-morphology leads to a high PCE. Therefore, an optimum drying time of the processed layers exists; too short (long) drying times would lead to too little (much) segregated morphologies. Aernouts and coworkers reported the preparation of P3HT/PCBM solar cells, where the active layer was inkjet printed from a mixture of chlorobenzene and tetralin in a volume ratio of 1:1.52 Different solute concentrations (1, 2 and 3 wt%) were investigated for their film formation properties. It was found that an increased concentration led to a film formation with a higher surface roughness. The authors did not further study the processing or ink parameters. Hence, the obtained power conversion efficiency of 1.4% represents the performance of a not fully optimized inkjet printed device.
Another approach was presented by Lange et al.,72 who used a solvent system consisting of relatively high boiling solvents (chlorobenzene, trichlorobenzene) for the inkjet printing of P3HT/PCBM layers. To stimulate solvent evaporation, the authors used subsequent heating, which resulted in a reduced drying time. Therefore, a fast drying of the films (<30 seconds) was achieved, resulting in well-segregated morphologies and efficiencies of 2.4%, which are similar to spin-coating (2.6%). Neophytou et al. showed that heating during processing improved the performance of P3HT/PCBM solar cells from 1.5% (substrate temperature 34 °C) to 2.7% (substrate temperature 42 °C).21
Finally, Eom and coworkers added 1,8-octanedithiol to the ink. This resulted in efficiencies of 3.7% due to a morphology tuning by the ability of 1,8-octanedithiol for a selective solubility of one of the active layer materials. In addition to the prepared P3HT/PCBM layers, also the PEDOT:PSS layer was inkjet printed for these devices.73
This section showed that by means of inkjet printing a controlled and reproducible material deposition is possible. Despite the fact that over recent years significant progress was made to improve the understanding of the drying behavior of inkjet printed features, further investigation on the effects of processing conditions on layer properties is required.

4 Direct comparison of applied processes and film characteristics
Many reports in the open literature discuss different processing techniques in order to achieve optimized device properties and efficiencies, but only a few reports allow a direct comparison between different coating techniques. From reports discussing, for example, spin-coating or inkjet printing, a rough overview is provided on challenges and possibilities for a single process, while mainly the donor/acceptor system P3HT/PCBM is used. A direct comparison of the methods, where the same operators as well as the same characterization tools are used, is, however, preferred. Following this approach, a better analogy of current classifications as well as future developments can be drawn.
Wong and coworkers investigated the charge carrier mobilities and related morphological properties of inkjet printed, drop-cast and spin-coated P3HT films, prepared from a chlorobenzene solution (Fig. 12).59 The authors found a remarkable difference in the resulting film properties depending on the preparation method. The highest crystallinity was observed for the inkjet printed films, whereas spin-coating resulted in the lowest crystallinity. Low root-mean-square (rms)-roughnesses for drop-cast and spin-coated films revealed an improved contact to the underlying surface, in contrast to the rough inkjet printed films. Hence, improved charge carrier mobilities were obtained only for spin-coated and drop-cast films. The study shows a significant difference in the resulting morphologies depending on the preparation method. Therefore, different drying kinetics as well as processing properties significantly affect the film formation and the nano-morphology. Furthermore, the study showed that an optimized degree of crystallinity of P3HT results in high charge carrier mobilities as well as smooth film surfaces. It was assumed by the authors that a too long drying time of the relatively thick inkjet printed P3HT film (1.7 μm) leads to a too high crystallinity, whereas a thinner inkjet printed film may reveal improved film characteristics due to a shorter drying time.

For the preparation of efficient P3HT/PCBM organic solar cells, Hoth et al. optimized the ink and processing properties for the respective applied preparation technique. The authors investigated polymer solar cells with inkjet printed and doctor bladed active layers (Fig. 13).74 The processing conditions of doctor bladed samples were transferred to the inkjet printing process, but, unfortunately, this transfer of parameters was found to be much more complex. Whereas for doctor blading highly regioregular (RR, 98%) P3HT showed the best performances, the preparation of inkjet printed films from the same solvent system was not possible in a simple manner due to a too fast gelation of P3HT and, subsequently, an increase in solution viscosity (Fig. 13a). For doctor blading the ink's viscosity had no significant influence on the processability, but inkjet printing requires a low viscosity (<100 mPa s).75 Therefore, P3HT with a lower RR, which shows a slower gelation time, was used for inkjet printing and resulted in more homogeneous films (Fig. 13b). Furthermore, the authors found a strong dependence of the substrate temperature during processing on the film homogeneity. For doctor blading a plate temperature of 60 °C showed the best results, while inkjet printing resulted in strong inhomogeneities when printing above 40 °C. First printing trials were performed with a single solvent (tetralin, bp 204 °C), which revealed a long drying time of the prepared films and, as a consequence, led to rough film surfaces as well as to a strong demixing of P3HT and PCBM. The authors have therefore developed a solvent system consisting of 68% ortho-dichlorobenzene (bp 179 °C) and 32% mesitylene (bp 165 °C), which revealed a reduced drying time as well as an improved film formation. By using this solvent mixture the surface roughness was lowered, the morphology was enhanced and the overall solar cell results were improved (Fig. 13d). The solar cells with an inkjet printed active layer of 96% RR P3HT/PCBM revealed an efficiency of 3.5%, which was a little lower than the efficiencies obtained with doctor bladed devices (4.1%, Fig. 13e). The authors explained the small difference by a higher surface roughness for the inkjet printed compared to the doctor bladed devices.74

Jung et al. described the preparation of inkjet printed P3HT/PCBM solar cells using a single solvent. The authors did not mention problems that typically occur during printing from a single solvent, i.e. the formation of a coffee drop and low overall film homogeneity. The authors revealed relatively high efficiencies of 3.8% when using chlorobenzene (bp 132 °C) and 3.6% for oDCB (bp 179 °C) by optimizing the dot spacing of the deposited droplets. The lower values for the higher boiling oDCB were attributed to a longer film drying time. In contrast, the spin-coated reference devices yielded slightly higher device efficiencies for the higher boiling oDCB, but lower efficiencies for the lower boiling chlorobenzene.76 This was attributed to the discrepancy between the drying rate requirements for the different deposition methods, as was described in a previous section. The lower boiling point solvent chlorobenzene seems to be more suitable for a slow drying process such as inkjet printing, whereas the higher boiling point solvent oDCB leads to improved results for spin-coated devices. Hence, both cases may result in optimal overall drying rates, depending on the processing techniques.
The results in this section confirm that a simple prediction of the resulting film morphology is not possible by easily switching the processing methods while using the same solute as well as processing conditions. A summary of applied film deposition techniques, processing techniques and device efficiencies reached is provided in Table 1. Since this review is focused on inkjet printing, data for spin-coating and doctor blading are provided for the purpose of comparison. Note that optimized PCE for spin-coated films exceeds 5%.77 The values reported here represent only a direct comparison of processing conditions and process. Each preparation method needs a separate optimization for the applied solution as well as for the desired application; whereas inkjet printing requires a faster film drying for efficient solar cell performances, the spin-coating process prefers a slow film drying.43 Moreover, the current literature focuses mainly on the donor–acceptor combination P3HT/PCBM, while other systems may potentially show different results.

5 Discussion
In the previous sections the drying characteristics and resulting film properties of different film preparation methods were discussed. It was shown that the control of the film morphology depends on the used preparation technique. The characteristics of organic semiconductor layers, e.g. charge carrier mobilities, optical and morphological properties, significantly depend on the molecular ordering of the polymer in the dried film, which can be tuned as a function of the film forming process as well as fabrication conditions. Whereas for spin-coating the correlations between processing parameters and layer properties are relatively well understood, there is much work to be done in order to fully understand the general drying kinetics for the inkjet printing process.
To form a complete picture of the advantages and drawbacks of the inkjet printing method as well as to elucidate potential developments of this process, an overview of properties and challenges is summarized in Fig. 14.
 Fig. 14  Schematic representation of characteristics, requirements, possibilities and challenges of the inkjet printing process. 
An attractive issue when using inkjet printing is that only a little amount of the materials is required and, due to a low waste production, inkjet printing is characterized as a material-efficient technique. Due to the fact that inkjet printing is an additive technique, there is no limitation for the used substrates, and flexible, curved substrates can be used besides rigid, planar surfaces. Therefore, inkjet printing can be easily applied for the fabrication of flexible devices. However, the solute properties, i.e. solvent, viscosity and surface tension, are more critical parameters for applicability in the inkjet printing process, in contrast to spin-coating. Furthermore, inkjet printing can be used in a combinatorial screening workflow to characterize materials and thin-film properties. This approach significantly accelerates the materials research.
Depending on the chosen inkjet printer system, there is a specific window for a useable surface tension, viscosity and density of the ink. Fromm predicted the successful printing of an ink when the Z-number, which depends on the nozzle orifice d, the surface tension γ, the density ρ and the viscosity η, is greater than 2.78 Some studies report a printability only in the range 2 < Z < 14,79 while other studies confirm printability of fluids with Z > 60.67 In practice, however, the lower limit is determined by the viscosity that dissipates the pressure pulse,15 whereas the upper limit represents the formation of satellite droplets.80 Furthermore, systems where the Z-number is much larger than 10 are printable as long as the formed satellites merge with the main droplet. The main factor that appeared to affect an ink's printability is its vapor pressure, with unstable droplets and no droplets being produced for solvents with vapor pressures higher than approximately 13 kPa. As soon as significant solvent evaporation takes place at the nozzle orifice, nozzle clogging may occur and printing is disturbed.
Besides the ink's rather small working window, a second challenge of the inkjet printing process is the ink's wetting behavior on the substrate. For thin film preparation, a good wetting behavior, hence a low contact angle of the ink with the underlying substrate, is preferred. Despite the fact that film size and thickness can be easily varied by changing the number of deposited droplets, the drying control of different film sizes is very complicated. Applying the solute and the printing parameters, which were found to be the optimized values for small films, does not automatically result in a good film formation for increased film sizes.
A third challenge is the dependence of the size of the device on its final efficiency. All reported efficiencies in the open literature are small, lab-scale produced devices. However, by increasing the film size, for example, from 0.04 to 1 cm2, device parameters, like the fill factor (FF) and the power conversion efficiency (PCE), significantly decrease.81
Other effects, such as the drying kinetics and the fluid flow within a drying droplet, are at this moment not fully understood and not able to be controlled. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the final film formation using inkjet printing. All these factors show the importance of evolving complete knowledge and, subsequently, controlling the drying processes that take place in an inkjet printed film.
When inkjet printing is applied for bulk heterojunction solar cells, the preparation and optimization are very complicated, since both the processing techniques as well as the solution properties affect the final device efficiency. For instance, it is not clear whether the surface roughness or the nano-morphology is the main limiting factor for the power conversion efficiency. This knowledge is, however, crucial for the choice of processing parameters, as a high boiling solvent leads to an increased surface roughness. It is noticeable that in the literature, contradicting results are reported, for example on the effect of the substrate temperature during coating.54,66 Up to now no general guideline was found for an optimized device efficiency, since most of the research groups change only a single (or at best a few) parameters out of many. At this point, a combinatorial screening would lead to more comparable results and better insight.
Most of the reported results indicated a correlation between the drying speed, either induced by the solvents or by the applied methods, and the device characteristics.35,59 However, it was also reported that not only do the drying kinetics influence the resulting film properties, but also the type of solvents, independent of the boiling point.42,43 Zhang et al. investigated the use of a solvent mixture, consisting of a main solvent chloroform and a co-solvent (xylene, toluene or chlorobenzene).82 From the discussions above, a general improvement of the spin-coated polyfluorene (PF)/PCBM layers was expected since the three co-solvents increase the boiling point of the solvent mixture significantly. Instead, only chlorobenzene showed improved OPV characteristics, whereas the other two co-solvents revealed a reduction of PCEs due to the formation of pronounced domains and increased surface roughnesses. The optimized parameters cannot be transferred easily to other polymer/fullerene combinations, since every compound solution has different rheological and, as a consequence, drying properties. P3HT is a semi-crystalline polymer, whereas processing dependent studies for more amorphous polymers, such as PF, are not available to such an extent.
Furthermore, polymer–polymer combinations have been used in OPVs to broaden the absorption spectrum and, as a consequence, to improve the efficiency of the solar cell. The combination of materials results in a more complex drying behavior compared to a single polymer system.5 Since polymers tend to segregate in solution, a fast drying of the prepared layer is preferred, otherwise the polymers are not well mixed in the final active layer and charge generation cannot take place. Arias et al. found enhanced morphological properties by using spin-coating compared to doctor blading by applying a lower boiling solvent as well as by increasing the substrate temperature during the fabrication of a polyfluorene blend, which contradicts the P3HT processing properties, as discussed in a previous section.83
In the near future one more challenge remains, which is to investigate more environmentally friendly solvents. Schmidt-Hansberg and coworkers investigated the replacement of the common solvents used for OPVs with non-halogenated solvent mixtures in doctor bladed films.84 It was found that indane in combination with toluene represents a suitable replacement for the common chlorinated solvents, resulting in good absorption behaviors as well as a high polymer crystallinity. Furthermore, a combination of acetophenone and mesitylene was proven to be a good solvent system for spin-coated films in order to replace oDCB in OPV preparation.85
The advantages of inkjet printing demonstrate that the required efforts are profitable, because inkjet printing can emerge as a material-efficient, cost-effective and R2R-compatible patterning technique. However, for the application of inkjet printing in a commercially available device there are many challenges to overcome, which is the reason why inkjet printing up to now has mainly been used in a scientific research environment.
6 Conclusion
This review discussed different printing and coating techniques applied for organic electronics. Since the nano-morphological structure of solar cell active layers, which can be significantly tuned by applied parameters, can be correlated directly to the device efficiency, the effect of processing conditions was discussed in particular for OPVs. The emphasis was on the drying characteristics of the preparation techniques. The relatively new and nascent technology of inkjet printing was compared to spin-coating and doctor blading – the latter two are currently the most commonly used preparation techniques for active layers in organic electronics. It was shown that film properties strongly depend on the drying time, which is influenced by the used solvent as well as by the processing technique itself. Spin-coating was found to give good layer properties when using solvents with a high boiling point, whereas in the slow drying processing of inkjet printing, solvents with a lower boiling point are preferred. On the other hand, the interplay between the drying kinetics and film properties is more complicated.
The analysis of the drying characteristics of the different preparation methods showed that basic principles are well understood, but that there is not yet a complete understanding of drying behaviors and resulting film characteristics. A prediction of layer properties when using a combination of ink and processing method is currently not possible, but it needs to be a major aim for further research in order to gain a complete understanding of the morphological properties as well as to evolve the ability to transfer existing knowledge to new materials. Different ways to control the drying process via the variation of preparation characteristics as well as tuning the drying speed of the as-prepared films were shown.
From a current point of view, none of the processing methods is considered to be the best for the preparation of OPVs in order to produce homogeneous layers with an optimal nano-morphology. Spin-coating is a well developed technique that reaches the highest reported efficiencies, but is not characterized by a material-efficient or R2R-compatible processing method. In contrast, inkjet printing is able to produce devices with sufficient efficiencies in a reproducible and material efficient manner. Inkjet printing has proven to be highly useful for the preparation of single lab devices and is a promising technique for R2R processing, but clearly needs more optimization to produce devices in larger numbers as well as in size and in a reproducible way.
In summary, inkjet printing is promising as a material-efficient and non-contact deposition process tool. In the field of organic electronics, in particular OPV, the state of research is increasing, but behind other solution deposition methods like spin-coating. Optimal processing parameters, like solvent or substrate temperature, cannot be transferred easily to other solution processing methods. At this point it is therefore clear that the fabrication of organic solar cell devices may use different preparation methods for each individual layer. For more efficient fabrication, R2R processing is preferred, since multiple processing techniques can be easily applied in sequence.
Inkjet printing, however, can bridge the gap between polymer synthesis and solid-state or surface property evaluation, since the technique opens the way to the automatic preparation of thin-film libraries of polymers, polymer blends and composites, with a systematic variation of parameters such as chemical composition or thickness. When novel compounds are to be processed via inkjet printing, an optimization of film properties needs to be performed by the use of a combinatorial screening for each individual parameter that influences the homogeneity.
