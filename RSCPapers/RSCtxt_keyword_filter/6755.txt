    , Accepted 10th June 2011First published on 8th July 2011AbstractBrief 160 °C annealing treatments dramatically enhanced the performance of bulk heterojunction inverted polymer solar cells with an ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag structure. The influence of such treatments on cell performance has been correlated to vertical phase segregation and crystallization within the photoactive layer of such cells. The photoactive layer, comprised of a mixture of P3HT and PCBM deposited on ZnO, was annealed for 10–30 min at 160 °C. Depth profiling with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that such annealing resulted in enrichment of the P3HT concentration near the ZnO layer, particularly after 20 and 30 min of annealing. Crystallization of P3HT was detected by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses after 10 to 30 min of such annealing, with little difference in the extent of crystallization detected over this time frame. It was found that vertical segregation does not seem to play a role as significant as that of crystallization on cell performance.

Broader context
Organic solar cells hold the potential to become a disruptive technology for sustainable energy generation by redefining current paradigms of solar power technologies. Organic solar cells are inherently compatible with low-cost roll-to-roll manufacturing, could be fabricated on light-weight, flexible and low-cost substrates, and overall could have small fabrication and life-cycle carbon foot-prints. The economic potential of organic solar cells will lie on their ability to be produced at very low costs, which could make them commercially viable even if the power conversion efficiency and lifetimes remain smaller than those of their inorganic counterparts. During the last decade, major advances of the efficiency and lifetime of bulk heterojunction solar cells has been achieved by a combination of improved material engineering, novel device geometries and control of the nanoscale morphology of the active layer. However, the nanoscopic nature of these thin-film devices makes them extremely dependent on processing conditions and on the physicochemical properties of the relevant interfaces in a device. Insight into the effects on the device performance of the nanoscale morphology of the active layer, which in turn depends on the processing conditions and device geometry, will be critical for future material and device optimization.

Introduction
Polymeric bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic cells show promise as potentially versatile portable devices for harvesting renewable solar energy.1–3 Extensive efforts are underway to increase the power conversion efficiencies (PCE's) of such cells through development of novel polymers and through control of the active layer micro/nanostructure.4–6 Post-deposition treatments, such as thermal annealing, have been used to induce phase separation in the active layer.7,8 Phase separation and vertical segregation can improve device performance by increasing the interfacial area between donor and acceptor phases for efficient charge separation and charge transport.9 The phase separation of blended films of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in BHJ solar cells has been examined by a number of authors.10–14 The extent of vertical phase segregation in these films has been modified by altering the surface energy of the substrates10 or the end-functional group of a donor polymer.13

Polymer solar cells with a transparent electron-collecting electrode have recently been fabricated in order to improve the cell stability in air.15,16 For such “inverted” structures, the work function of ITO (indium-doped tin oxide, the electron-collecting electrode) was reduced by applying a thin metal oxide layer (e.g., ZnO, TiOx, or Al2O3).15–20 In the present study, brief 160 °C annealing treatments have been found to dramatically enhance the performance of such inverted polymer solar cells with a structure ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag. The influence of these thermal treatments on vertical phase segregation and crystallization within the photoactive P3HT:PCBM layer deposited on ZnO has been examined using depth profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses, respectively. The changes in vertical segregation and crystallization within the P3HT:PCBM layer with annealing time at 160 °C have then been correlated with changes in cell performance.
Experimental
A. Device fabrication
Inverted polymer solar cells (Fig. 1a) were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates with active layers comprised of polymeric blends of the donor P3HT (4002E, Rieke Metals, Lincoln, NE) and the acceptor PCBM (PCBM, Nano-C, Westwood, MA). The ITO-coated glass substrates (Colorado Concept Coatings LLC, Loveland, CO) possessed a sheet resistivity of 15 Ωsq−1. The substrates were cleaned sequentially in an ultrasonic bath of deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, with intermediate drying conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere. To modify the work function of ITO, 20-nm-thick ZnO layers were deposited on cleaned ITO substrates by atomic layer deposition (ALD) (Savannah 100, Cambridge NanoTech, Cambridge, MA) using sequential 15 ms pulses of H2O and diethylzinc at 200 °C. E-beam deposition (AXXIS, Kurt J. Lesker, Clairton, PA) was used to deposit a patterned, 300-nm-thick layer of SiOx through a shadow mask on the ITO/ZnO substrates. The substrates were then ultrasonicated in isopropanol for 10 min and dried in a nitrogen atmosphere. After loading into a nitrogen-filled glove box, P3HT:PCBM films were spin-coated onto the ITO/ZnO substrates for 1 min at 700 rpm from solutions comprised of a mixture of P3HT and PCBM in chlorobenzene (P3HT:PCBM weight ratio = 1:0.7; total P3HT + PCBM concentration = 34 mg/ml). These solutions were filtered through 0.2-cm-pore PTFE filters prior to spin coating. Some of the resulting samples were then annealed at 160 °C for 10, 20, or 30 min in a nitrogen-atmosphere glove box. After loading the samples into a vacuum thermal evaporation system (SPECTROS, Kurt J. Lesker, Clairton, PA) connected to the glove box, a 15 nm-thick layer of MoO3, and then a 150 nm-thick layer of Ag, were deposited through a shadow mask at a base pressure of 2 × 10−7 Torr. The completed devices were transferred in a sealed container to another nitrogen-filled glove box for electrical measurements. Current–voltage characteristics were measured using a source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments, Cleveland, OH) controlled by a LabVIEW program. For illumination, an AM1.5G solar simulator (Oriel 91160, Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT) with an irradiance IL = 100 mW cm−2 was used inside the glove box.

B. Characterization
In order to allow for depth profiling of vertical phase segregation by XPS analyses, samples with structure ITO/ZnO(20 nm)/P3HT:PCBM(200 nm) were prepared using the same procedures as for the inverted devices up to the MoO3/Ag deposition step. The average water contact angle on a given ITO/ZnO substrate was obtained from three measurements with a contact angle analyzer (Phoenix 300, SEO, LA, CA). Pristine P3HT and PCBM films were also prepared on ITO/ZnO substrates. XPS analyses (K-Alpha XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) were conducted using incident photons with an energy of 1486.6 eV from an Al Kα monochromatic source and with a spot size of 300 microns. Depth profiling was conducted viamilling with an Ar+ ion-beam with an energy of 3000 eV using a raster size of 1.0 mm2. Each milling step was conducted for 60 s, after which a general XPS analysis of the surface (with a step size of 1.0 eV) and a high resolution XPS analysis (with a step size of 0.01 eV) of the S 2p peak (indicative of P3HT) were conducted. This procedure was repeated 9 times until the sulfur peak was no longer observed. The data collected was analyzed using Thermo Advantage data acquisition software. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of the samples were conducted with Cu Kα radiation using an X-Pert Pro Alpha 1 diffractometer and an X'Celerator linear detector (PANalytical, Almelo, The Netherlands).
Results and discussion

XPS analyses of pristine P3HT and PCBM films are presented in Fig. 1c. Prior to data acquisition, the surfaces of the samples were etched using an Ar+ beam for 2 min to remove contaminants deposited during exposure to air. Ar 2p, C 1s, and O 1s peaks were detected in the pristine PCBM film, whereas S 2p, S 2s, and C 1s peaks were detected in the pristine P3HT film. The Ar 2p peak in the pristine PCBM film was attributed to Ar trapped during Ar+ beam sputtering. While the O 1s signal was an indicator of the presence of oxygen-bearing PCBM (Fig. 1b), the relatively low intensity of this peak and the possibility of oxygen contamination from exposure to air made questionable the use of this peak for the identification of PCBM. However, the S 2p peak in the pristine P3HT film possessed a relatively high intensity and the use of this peak for tracking the presence of P3HT (Fig. 1b) was not so plagued by air contamination as for the O 1s signal for PCBM. Hence, depth profiling of the P3HT concentration within the P3HT:PCBM-bearing films was conducted with high resolution XPS analyses over the range from 167 to 163 eV within which the S 2p peak was located.

XPS analyses of the P3HT:PCBM films obtained near the film/air interface, the film midpoint, and the film/ZnO interface before and after annealing at 160 °C for 10–30 min are shown in Fig. 2a. For the as-cast P3HT:PCBM film, the intensity of the S 2p peak was constant throughout the film thickness, which indicated that there was no detectable tendency for the P3HT molecules to preferentially segregate near the ZnO substrate or near the top interface with air during spin-coating of the film. A slightly reduced intensity, if any, of the S 2p peak near the air/P3HT:PCBM film interface relative to the film/ZnO interface was observed after 10 min of thermal annealing. However, an increase in the thermal annealing time to 20 or 30 min resulted in a distinct differences in the intensity of the S 2p peak near the P3HT:PCBM film/ZnO interface, the P3HT:PCBM film midpoint, and near the air/P3HT:PCBM film interface; that is, the S 2p peak intensity was higher near the P3HT:PCBM film/ZnO interface than at the P3HT:PCBM film midpoint which, in turn, was higher than near the air/P3HT:PCBM film interface. Fig. 2b reveals a plot of the integrated counts of photoelectrons associated with the S 2p peak as a function of the Ar+ ion-beam sputtering time (i.e., as a function of the distance into the film from the air/film interface). The integrated counts for the as-cast film, and for the film annealed for 10 min, remained relatively constant with depth into these films. However, substantial increases in the integrated counts for S 2p photoelectrons were observed with distance from the air/P3HT:PCBM film interface for the films that were annealed for 20 and 30 min at 160 °C.

Vertical phase segregation within P3HT/PCBM films can be strongly influenced by the relative interfacial energies of P3HT-bearing and PCBM-bearing phases with the substrate and with each other. For example, Campoy-Quiles et al. reported that P3HT was preferentially found close to a silica substrate, and PCBM was displaced towards the air/P3HT:PCBM film interface, when the silica substrate had been modified with a hydrophobic self-assembled monolayer and when the assembly was exposed to thermal treatment.10 The hydrophobic nature of the ZnO/ITO substrate in the present work was confirmed by water contact angle measurements, which yielded values of 64 ± 3°, consistent with other ZnO films processed at low temperatures21,22 Hence, while the detailed mechanism of vertical phase segregation in these inverted solar cells is not fully understood, thermal treatment of the P3HT:PCBM films resulted in preferential segregation of the P3HT molecules to the interface with the relatively hydrophobic ZnO/ITO substrate, which was consistent with previous reports.

XRD analyses of the P3HT:PCBM films conducted as a function of annealing time at 160 °C are shown in Fig. 3. The single diffraction peak observed near 2θ = 5° after 10 min of annealing corresponded to diffraction arising from the interchain spacing in the P3HT crystallites, a behavior that is well documented in the literature for a variety of annealing conditions.18,23 The extent of P3HT crystallization, as suggested by the intensity and width of this diffraction peak, did not appear to increase after further annealing for 20 and 30 min. This further confirms previous observations found by M. Campoy-Quiles and co-workers10 in that the onset of vertical segregation correlates with the onset of crystallization of P3HT, as clearly observed on our XPS and XRD experiments.

The observed changes in the vertical segregation and crystallization of P3HT with annealing time at 160 °C were then correlated with the photovoltaic performance of such films, embedded within an inverted polymer solar cells with a structure ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag. Fig. 4a reveals the J–V characteristics measured on inverted solar cell devices for various times of annealing of the P3HT:PCBM layer (note: such annealing was conducted prior to MoO3 and Ag deposition). Table I provides the values of the photovoltaic performance averaged over five devices for a given thermal annealing treatment.

Annealing of the P3HT:PCBM layer for 10 min resulted in a dramatic enhancement of the performance of the inverted solar cell, which was consistent with a number of studies involving thermal treatments of other cells with active layers comprised of P3HT:PCBM blends.8,24 Upon such annealing, the crystallization of P3HT chains forces the PCBM molecules out of the P3HT-rich phases, inducing nanoscale phase separation that facilitates exciton dissociation and charge transport. Unexpectedly, however, although substantially greater vertical phase segregation of P3HT near the interface with ZnO was detected after the 20 or 30 min heat treatments than after 10 min, little difference was detected in the photovoltaic performance of devices annealed for 10, 20, or 30 min at 160 °C. These results, to some extent, contradict conventional wisdom in that an enrichment of an acceptor-rich phase near the electron-collecting electrode should greatly facilitate the efficient collection of photo-generated electrons. Although these results do not rule out the possibility that an acceptor rich-phase near the electron-collecting electrode would improve the solar cell performance, the vertical P3HT phase segregation in these inverted solar cells appears to be less important than the crystallinity and the nanomorphology of the donor–acceptor phases in the blend. Indeed, while an increase in crystallinity of the P3HT nano-domains was detected after 10 min of annealing, little change in crystallinity was observed after further annealing for 20 and 30 min; that is, the time dependence of the changes in the crystallinity of the P3HT nano-domains appeared to correlate better with the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells than the time dependence of the P3HT vertical phase segregation.
Conclusions
In summary, thermally-induced vertical phase segregation and crystallization in bulk-heterojunction photoactive layers, comprised of a blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) deposited on ZnO, have been examined viaXPS and XRD analyses, respectively. Depth profiling with XPS analyses revealed that thermal annealing at 160 °C for 20–30 min resulted in significant vertical phase segregation with preferential enrichment of a P3HT-rich phase adjacent to the bottom ZnO layer used as an electron-collecting electrode. XRD analyses revealed an increase in crystallinity of the P3HT nano-domains after 10 min of annealing, with little detectable additional change after 20 and 30 min. Inverted polymer solar cells with the structure ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3/Ag were found to exhibit dramatically-improved photovoltaic performance after annealing of the active P3HT:PCBM layer for 10 min at 160 °C, with little further improvement after 20 and 30 min of annealing at this temperature. These results suggest that the enhanced crystallinity of the P3HT:PCBM films, and particularly of the P3HT domains, resulting from thermal annealing at 160 °C had a larger influence on the improved photovoltaic performance of the thermally-treated inverted solar cells than did the vertical segregation of P3HT.
