    , Accepted 27th March 2015First published on 30th March 2015AbstractA novel copolymer based on fluorene and perylene diimide with pendent amino groups, namely poly[2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-5-methyl-12-(7-methyl-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)anthra(2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′)diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone] (PF-PDIN), has been synthesized and developed as a cathode interlayer for inverted polymer solar cells (I-PSCs). PF-PDIN shows good alcohol solubility and uniform film morphology. The device with the configuration of ITO/PF-PDIN/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag exhibits a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.54%. The resulting device shows higher efficiency and better stability relative to the device using an organic small-molecule analogue, 2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)anthrax(2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′)diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone (PDIN), as the cathode interlayer. This work indicates that PF-PDIN is a new promising candidate cathode interlayer for highly efficient and stable PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted much attention due to their potential applications in flexible, lightweight, and large area devices through low-cost solution processing.1–6 Over the past several years, PSCs based on the nanoscale phase separated blend of semiconducting conjugated polymer electron donors and fullerene derivative electron acceptors have shown a remarkable breakthrough. The highest reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) has exceeded 9.2% for single solar cells7 and 10% for tandem solar cells.8 PSCs have two main types of device structures, which are the conventional structure (ITO substrate/hole transport layer/active layer/electron transport layer/metal electrode) and the inverted structure (ITO substrate/electron transport layer/active layer/ hole transport layer /metal electrode).9 In the conventional structure, their instability, particularly in the presence of oxygen and moisture, becomes a critical issue for real commercial applications because the active layer is normally sandwiched between transparent indium tin oxide (ITO), and low work function metals (normally Ca/Al), which are very chemically active in air. Compared to conventional PSCs, inverted PSCs (I-PSCs) have attracted increasing attention because of their greatly improved device stability by using air stable metals as the hole collecting electrode and ITO as the electron collecting electrode.10 Unfortunately, the I-PSCs fabricated with a bare ITO cathode exhibit inferior performance because not only the high WF of the ITO cathode (−4.7 eV) hinders the ohmic contact with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of fullerene, reducing the open-circuit voltage (Voc),11,12 but also the organic active layers have poor contact with the inorganic ITO cathode, which will result in low fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc). Therefore, in order to improve the PCE and stability of PSCs, finding some solution-processed organic interlayer inserted between the ITO and the photoactive layer becomes an important issue to PSCs.
Many materials such as zinc oxide (ZnO),13,14 titanium oxide (TiOx),15 MoO3–Al composite,16 cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3),17,18 water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO),19 and alcohol soluble fullerene derivatives9,20–24 used as cathode interlayers have successfully enhanced the PCE of PSCs. In those interlayers, water/alcohol-soluble organic or polymeric materials have advantages compared to inorganic interlayers due to their simple, vacuum-free and environmentally friendly procedure to form a film during the device fabrication. Moreover, most inorganic layers are sensitive to the UV-irradiation and the surface adsorption of oxygen.25 To overcome the disadvantages of inorganic interfacial layers, we need to develop the promising candidates for the interlayer of PSCs. The organic polymeric/molecular interface materials require the introduction of specific functional groups (such as ethylene oxide,26 phosphonate,24,27 amino or ammonium,7,28–32etc.) that can form the desired interfacial dipole with the ITO substrate, thus reducing the WF of ITO and significantly improving the charge transport and collection efficiency. Especially, perylene diimide-based interfacial materials have attracted great attention due to their several fascinating properties, such as photochemical stability, high electron affinities, easy functionalization and high conductivities.28,33–38 As we know, PDIN as an organic small-molecule is one of the most attractive reported cathode interfacial materials in organic solar cells. Despite the enhancement in the PCE, the device has a lower stability due to its strong crystalline, which renders the use of this material for a long time. Moreover, PDIN as an organic small-molecule has bad film formation, which limits its application. Therefore, finding some organic polymeric interface materials which have good film formation is necessary. Especially, fluorene-based interfacial materials have attracted great attention. As we know, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-ioctylfluorene)] (PFN) as a water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer is one of the most attractive reported cathode interfacial materials in organic solar cells.7,39 The excellent electron extraction originated from the pinning Fermi level and the additional interface electric field is believed to contribute to the enhanced efficiency of the I-PSCs employing PFN as the cathode interfacial layer.39
Herein, based on the good performances of fluorene and perylene diimide, we synthesized a water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymer PF-PDIN named poly[2,9-bis(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-5-methyl-12-(7-methyl-9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)anthra(2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′)diisoquinoline-1,3,8,10(2H,9H)-tetraone]. PF-PDIN has good film formation, and good electron transport and collection properties. Most importantly, PF-PDIN can improve the PCE in I-PSCs with the device architecture of ITO/PF-PDIN/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag where P3HT represents poly(3-hexylthiophene). For comparison, the reference devices with/without PDIN were prepared under the same conditions. Prominent PCEs as high as 3.54% were achieved, which were much higher than those of the reference devices.
Experimental section
Materials and measurements
3,4,9,10-Perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride (PDA) and 5,12-dibromoanthra[2,1,9-def:6,5,10-d′e′f′]diisochromene-1,3,8,10-tetraone (2BrPDA) were purchased from HWRK Chem and used without further purification. Fluorene was obtained from ENERGY CHEMICAL. Tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (Pd(PPh3))4 was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were purchased from American Dye Sources (ADS). Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 15 Ω per square was obtained from Shenzhen Display (China). Solvents were carefully dried and distilled from appropriate drying agents prior to use. All reactions were monitored by using thin-layer chromatography (TLC) with Merck pre-coated glass plates. Compounds were visualized using UV-light irradiation at 254 and 365 nm. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz Fourier transform NMR spectrometer; chemical shifts were quoted relative to the internal standard tetramethylsilane. High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained using a Bruker Maxis UHR-TOF, Ion Source: APCI system. The absorption spectra were recorded using a Hitachi U-4100 UV-Vis-NIR scanning spectrophotometer. The molecular weight of the polymer was measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) performed using an ELEOS System, and polystyrene was used as the standard (room temperature, tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed on a CHI660D electrochemical workstation. The work station is equipped with a three-electrode cell consisting of a platinum working electrode, a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode. The measurements were carried out in anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 M n-Bu4NPF6 as a supporting electrolyte under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Thin films were deposited from chloroform solution onto the working electrodes. The redox potential of the Fc/Fc+ internal reference is 0.38 V vs. SCE. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels were determined by using the empirical formula40 and , where Eox and Ered are the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, respectively.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement was performed using a SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.

Fabrication and characterization of PSCs

Fabrication of PSCs. 
The PSCs were fabricated as an inverted photovoltaic device architecture, ITO/cathode interlayer/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag. Firstly, ITO coated glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned sequentially in detergent, water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. PF-PDIN (1.5 mg mL−1) and PDIN (1.5 mg mL−1) were dissolved in methanol in the presence of a small amount of acetic acid. Then, PF-PDIN or PDIN was spin-cast onto the ITO substrates with the speed at 2000 rpm. The active layer was then spin-coated onto the cathode interlayer (P3HT/PC61BM = 1:1 with a total concentration of 18 mg mL−1 in dichlorobenzene (DCB)) with the addition of DIO at 800 rpm. Finally, a thin layer of MoO3 (3 nm) and Ag (80 nm) was thermally evaporated under 2.0 × 10−4 Pa to complete the inverted structure. As for comparison, the devices without a buffer layer were made under the same conditions. The effective area of a single device was 0.15 cm2.
The PCEs of the inverted solar cell devices were measured using an AM 1.5G solar simulator (Oriel model 91160). The photo and dark current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under simulated 100 mW cm−2 irradiation from a Newport solar simulator. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of solar cells were analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.

Physicochemical properties
Polymer PF-PDIN is alcohol soluble, while it needs the assistance of acetic acid (4‰ in volume). However, it has poor solubility in chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, which is very important for inverted device fabrication. Its absorption spectra and cyclic voltammogram are provided in Fig. 2 and physicochemical properties are collected in Table 1. PF-PDIN showed three absorption peaks in solution, which were similar to other reported PDI-based polymers.43 The absorption spectra of the films were not notably red-shifted compared with those in solution, indicating that little intermolecular interaction occurred in the solid state, probably due to the large steric hindrance of the many bulky side chains. From the cyclic voltammogram, the onset reduction potential (Eredon) and onset oxidation potential (Eoxon) were evaluated to be −0.58 and −1.10 V for PF-PDIN. The reference electrode was calibrated by the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) (4.8 eV below the vacuum level)43 to obtain accurate energy levels. The LUMO levels of PF-PDIN were thus calculated to be −3.83 eV. The LUMO was very close to that of PC61BM (about −3.71 eV), which could smoothly bridge electrons to transport from the fullerene acceptor to the cathode side.28 The HOMO energy levels of PF-PDIN were estimated to be −5.51 eV. In addition, the Kelvin probe results show that the WF of ITO coated by PF-PDIN was reduced from 4.70 eV for pure ITO to 3.85 eV by using a KP 6500 Digital Kelvin probe (McAllister Technical Services. Co. Ltd).

Photovoltaic performance
I-PSCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/PF-PDIN/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag to study the interfacial function of PF-PDIN. In this inverted device structure, ITO was used as the cathode, MoO3/Ag was used as the anode, and P3HT and PC61BM were used as the donor and acceptor, respectively. The chemical structure of P3HT and PC61BM, the device configuration, and the energy levels of the corresponding materials in the devices are presented in Scheme 2. PF-PDIN from its alcohol solution was deposited on the top of ITO as an interlayer. For comparison, control devices with/without PDIN as the cathode interlayer were also fabricated under the same conditions.

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves for the I-PSCs measured under AM 1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) are presented in Fig. 3 and the corresponding device characteristics including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values, shunt resistance (Rsh), and series resistance (Rs) are summarized in Table 2. I-PSC with a bare ITO electrode performed poor with a PCE of 1.94%, a Voc of 0.53 V, a Jsc of 8.92 mA cm−2, and a FF of 41%. After inserting a thin interlayer of PDIN, the PCE of the device reached 2.99% with a significantly enhanced FF of 58%, a fairly improved Voc of 0.56 V and a Jsc of 9.21 mA cm−2. Interestingly, the device with PF-PDIN as the cathode interlayer delivered comparable performance as the device using PDIN as the interlayer. The PF-PDIN/ITO electrode device showed a higher PCE of 3.54%, with a Voc of 0.60, a Jsc of 9.52 mA cm−2 and a FF of 62%. Notably, Voc, Jsc and FF of the device with PF-PDIN as the cathode interlayer were simultaneously enhanced relative to the bare ITO electrode device, which led to higher overall performance. It is interesting that PF-PDIN exhibited comparable performance as an cathode interlayer material relative to PDIN, making it a good alternative cathode interlayer material in I-PSC device design.

To further scrutinize the electrical characteristics of the PF-PDIN-based interlayer in inverted devices, the dark J–V characteristics were measured (Fig. 4). In the regime of −0.50 to 0.68 V, the reverse and leakage currents of the device with the cathode interlayer of PF-PDIN and PDIN were suppressed compared to that of the bare ITO electrode device. It has been reported that the reduced reverse dark current contributed to the Voc enhancement by incorporating the water/alcohol-soluble conjugated polymers as the cathode interlayers in PSCs.30,46 Meanwhile, such a reduced dark leakage current is also beneficial for PCE improvements in PSC devices.47 While in the region over 0.68 V, the devices with PDIN and PF-PDIN as a interlayer showed higher injection currents compared to that of the bare ITO electrode, which is indicative of increased electron injection from the ITO electrode and is consistent with the decreased Rs (18.22, 11.02, and 9.21 Ω cm2 for the bare ITO, PDIN/ITO and PF-PDIN/ITO devices, respectively) (see Table 2).24 The increased Voc could be attributed to the interface dipoles generated by PF-PDIN, and the increased electric field could improve charge transport properties, eliminate the build-up of space charge and reduce recombination loss,48 leading to increased Jsc and FF.49

To gain a further understanding of the improvement of device performance after inserting the PF-PDIN cathode interlayer, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (see Fig. 5) of the I-PSCs both with and without interlayers were recorded. With different cathode interlayers, the shape of the EQE curve of the devices was almost identical across the entire wavelength range. In addition, it is seen that the ITO/PF-PDIN device shows the highest EQE value, which is consistent with the value obtained from J–V curves.

The ability of adjusting the morphology of the interlayer is very important for optimizing device performance, since the ohmic contact between the active layer and the ITO electrode is strongly dependent on the morphology of the interlayer in devices. So an atomic force microscope (AFM) in tapping mode was used to track the surface morphologies of the PDIN and PF-PDIN interlayer on the ITO substrates. For comparison, the surface morphologies of ITO without an interlayer were measured by AFM. The corresponding images are presented in Fig. 6. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the bare ITO surface was 0.80 nm. By coating a thin PF-PDIN interlayer onto the ITO, the RMS roughness value was 0.88 nm, which indicated that PF-PDIN had a good film forming property. Correspondingly, the RMS roughness of the ITO/PDIN layer increased to 1.38 nm due to the properties of PDIN aggregation, which were much higher than those of the bare ITO and ITO/PF-PDIN films. The PF-PDIN interlayer showed a smooth and homogeneous morphology and can effectively prevent the leakage current at the interface between the active layer and the ITO electrode, thus enhancing the efficiencies of the devices.

To illustrate the solvent resistance of the PDIN and PF-PDIN thin films, UV-vis absorption spectra of the thin films were recorded before and after being washed with dichlorobenzene (DCB), and the UV-vis spectra are shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen from Fig. 7 that the PDIN film was washed 58% away, however, the PF-PDIN film was only washed 20% away, which indicated that PF-PDIN has a better solvent resistance ability.

These devices were stored in nitrogen at room temperature and periodically tested for 20 days to gauge the device stability [Fig. 8(a)–(d)]. The device using PDIN as the cathode interlayer was very unstable. The PCE of the corresponding devices reduced with a rapid speed after seven days of storage and reached 0.5% after twenty days. The rapid reduction of PCE should be contributed to the characteristics of easy aggregation and ability of weak solvent resistance, which could be seen from Fig. 6(b) and 7(a). In contrast, the device using PF-PDIN as the interlayer showed high stability. Both FF and Voc over the period of 20 days remained relatively constant with the Jsc slightly decreasing over this time leading to a PCE of over 75%.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a water/alcohol soluble conjugated polymer PF-PDIN containing pendent amino groups was synthesized and employed as a cathode interlayer for the I-PSCs. This new polymer demonstrates the properties necessary for an effective interface material including uniform film formation, good solvent resistance ability and excellent electron extraction. Compared to the device with PDIN as a cathode interlayer, a simultaneous enhancement in Voc, Jsc and FF of the I-PSCs with PF-PDIN as a cathode interlayer has been observed. As a result, the inverted device ITO/PF-PDIN/P3HT:PC61BM/MoO3/Ag showed a PCE of 3.54%. It indicates that PF-PDIN is a new promising candidate as a good cathode interlayer for highly efficient and stable I-PSCs.
