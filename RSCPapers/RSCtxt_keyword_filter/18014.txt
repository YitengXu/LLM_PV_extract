    , Accepted 20th October 2020First published on 22nd October 2020AbstractCarbon nitride (CN) films have emerged as promising photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting cells. However, due to their intrinsic poor charge transfer dynamics and the absence of a controllable film deposition method, their performance remains unsatisfactory. Here, we report an in situ textured CN film that is strengthened by a band-gap state modulation strategy with superior PEC performance. The optimized film possesses a 15-fold improvement in photocurrent density over pristine CN film, reaching up to 119.2 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus RHE without any hole scavengers. Through experimental characterizations and theoretical verifications, we found that the remarkable photocurrent density originates from the synergistic effect of long wavelength photon harvesting and efficient charge migration. The substantial enhancement of PEC activity highlights the importance of nanoengineering in terms of controlling the macroscopic film morphology and modulating the microscopic electronic structure for the precise design of multipurpose photoelectrodes.
Introduction
The photoelectrochemical (PEC) process, which occurs on semiconducting thin films, plays crucial roles in solar energy storage, conversion and industrial production reactions (i.e., hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, and nitrogen reduction). The multi-electron transfer chemistry and the accumulation of multiple redox equivalents in photo-initiated redox reactions kinetically retard the PEC process. To date, various semiconductors such as titanium dioxide (TiO2),1 bismuth vanadate (BiVO4),2 cadmium sulfide (CdS),3 molybdenum disulfide (MoS2),4 and phosphorene5 have been recognized as promising photoelectrodes.
Among them, carbon nitride (CN) film outperforms other semiconductors and is a promising candidate in the field due to its suitable band structure, low cost, and robust stability. However, most previous endeavours were devoted to developing photocatalyst CN powders rather than photoanode thin films. Due to the poor solubility of CN powders in most solvents, little progress has been made in the deposition of CN on films. Although high-quality CN films prepared via vapor-assisted methods have been reported,6–8 the inherent poor charge transport characteristics of CN films impede their practical applications. Demands for efficient solar energy conversion provide the impetus for functionalizing CN films.
Recently, various strategies have been used to tailor the properties of CN films through composition regulation by introducing heteroatoms to tune the electronic structure/construct nanojunctions,9,10 or to combine with other semiconductors to engineer CN-based heterojunctions/bulk heterojunctions.11,12 Unfortunately, despite increased light absorption due to the additional absorber, the energy level mismatching in the heterojunction has led to limited success in achieving excellent PEC performance. Similarly, even though most dopants contribute to the extended visible light absorption by narrowing the bandgap, efficient charge transfer is sacrificed due to the excessive defects formed in the doped system. A profound understanding of the functions of substitution atoms in the doped system is urgently needed to guide the compositional design of the photoelectrodes.
Alternatively, building novel film architectures that increase the surface area will effectively affect the PEC process.13 Furthermore, the topography of the photoelectrodes dominates the interfacial charge transfer and charge collection because charge separation occurs on electrode/electrolyte interfaces. To improve CN film-based photoelectrodes, the charge transfer behaviour must be captured in compositional dependence, and topography control in the film growth mechanism must be understood.
Herein, we developed a multi-step thermal vapor condensation (MSTVC) method to prepare pristine CN and oxygen-doped CN films (OCN) with in situ textured topography and tuneable electronic structure. The as-prepared films were photoelectrochemically and theoretically characterized. With the oxygen (O) heteroatom incorporation, the in situ textured OCN film achieves a photocurrent density as high as 119.2 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under simulated 1 sun illumination. This impressive PEC performance among CN-based photoanodes reveals the synergistic effects of in situ engineering for both topography and composition.
We combined the experimental characterization and the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculation, and determined that (i) the in situ textured surface facilitates charge transfer at the electrode/collector and electrode/electrolyte interfaces and (ii) the implanted O atoms primarily improve the long wavelength photon harvesting by introducing band-gap states and enhance the charge separation along and between CN interlayers via localizing the electrons/holes.
Experimental section
Deposition of the CN film
In this work, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further treatment. First, different volumes (20 mL, 50 mL, and 75 mL) of 30 wt% hydrogen peroxide solution were added to 18 g melamine. The obtained mixtures were continuously stirred at ambient temperature for 30 min and then moved to a 90 °C drying oven. After 6 h, the obtained powder was finely milled. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glasses (50 mm × 50 mm × 3.2 mm, Sigma-Aldrich, 8 Ω sq−1) were pre-treated in a mixture of deionized water (18.2 MΩ cm−2), acetone, and isopropanol (1:1:1 vol%) in an ultrasound sonication bath for 30 min before use.
The treated FTO glass was then placed on the top of a finely polished crucible (25 mL) with prepared precursor inside. A 500 g ceramic plate was placed over the FTO glass, and then, the setup was transferred to a muffle furnace (Carbolite) and heated to 600 °C at different heating rates in a multistep reaction sequence. The sample was first heated to 300 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, then heated to 390 °C at a rate of 1.5 °C min−1, and this temperature was maintained for 20 min. Then, the sample was continuously heated to 520 °C at a rate of 3 °C min−1, and this temperature was maintained for another 20 min. Finally, the sample was heated to 600 °C at a rate of 3 °C min−1. Upon reaching 600 °C, the sample was removed from the muffle furnace and allowed to cool to room temperature. The ability to change the heating rate during different temperature intervals was used to control the film topography.
The deposition process mentioned in this work refers to the above routine. Deposition processes that follow other sequences are illustrated in the ESI (Table S1).† After deposition, the as-prepared CN films were cut into identical rectangular pieces with areas of approximately 0.25 cm2 for further investigation.
Material characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded on a Smartlab X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data and surface film composition were obtained from a Thermo Fisher Scientific USA Model ESCALAB 250XI spectrometer with Al Kα radiation, and the peak positions were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.5 eV. The Ar+ sputtering rate for the XPS depth profile was 2.1 nm min−1. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy spectra were recorded on a Thermo Fisher Scientific USA Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were acquired at room temperature on a Varian fluorescence spectrometer.
Top and cross-sectional views of film morphologies were observed using a JEOL JSM-670F field-emission scanning electron microscope. The fine structure, crystalline nature, element distribution, and bulk film composition were investigated using a FEI Titan Tecnai G2 F20 field-emission transmission electron microscope. Surface topographies, roughness, and film thickness were obtained using a VEECO Multimode V atomic force microscope.
Theoretical calculations
Calculations in this work were performed using the atomic orbital-based density functional theory (DFT) method implemented in SIESTA code.14 We adopted the DRSLL exchange-correlation functional, which includes vdW interactions,15,16 and the double zeta plus polarization orbitals basis set. The detailed parameters used in the calculations include an energy cut-off of 300 Ry, a maximal force threshold of 0.02 eV Å−1, a projected atomic orbital energy shift of 10 meV, a maximal displacement tolerance of 1.0 × 10−4 Å, and a k point sampling of 1 × 1 × 1.
Note that SIESTA has been successfully applied in many simulations of two-dimensional surfaces.17–19 The calculations of geometries and UV-Vis absorption spectra were carried out at the levels of ωB97XD/6-31G* and TD-ωB97XD/6-31G*, which were implemented in the Gaussian 09 package.20 The electron–hole pair distribution was observed using a multifunctional wave-function analyser.21
Photoelectrochemical measurement
The PEC performance of the films was characterized on a three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai Chenhua Limited, China) with CN, SCN, and SOCN-75 films as the working electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode, and an Ag/AgCl (in saturated KCl) electrode as the reference electrode. Before the PEC measurement, the cut films were sealed with epoxy resin, and the effective contact area between the photoelectrode and electrolyte was maintained at approximately 0.5 cm−2. The electrolyte consisted of 0.1 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) buffer with (pH 11.6) and without (pH 7) 0.05 M sodium sulfide (Na2S). The potentials referenced to Ag/AgCl were converted into RHE according to the Nernst equation (at 25 °C):ERHE = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 V × pH + 0.197
Light on PEC measurements were carried out under the illumination of an air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (NewBet HSX-F300) with a calibrated power density of 100 mW cm−2. Nyquist plots were achieved at open circuit voltage conditions with a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and AC voltage of 10 mV. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the films was calculated according to the following equation:  where λ denotes the wavelength of the monochromic incident light and is equal to 360, 380, 400, 420, 440, 460, 480, 500, 520, 540, 560, 580, 600, 620, 640, 660, 680, and 700 nm. Pmono is the power of the incident monochromatic light at a given wavelength generated by a monochromator (SOFN 71MU1021), and Jph is the corresponding photocurrent density under monochromatic light illumination.
The Mott–Schottky relationship was determined according to the equation:  where Csc denotes the space charge layer capacitance of the photoelectrode upon applied bias; εr, ε0, e, and A denote the relative permittivity of the semiconductor, the vacuum permittivity, the charge of an electron and the effective surface area of the photoelectrode, respectively; Nd denotes the free carrier density; E represents the applied potential and Efb indicates the flat band potential; k denotes the Boltzmann constant; and T denotes the absolute temperature. Mott–Schottky plots were acquired in the dark with a sinusoidal modulation at frequencies of 1000, 3000, and 5000 Hz.
Results and discussion
Topography texture and structural characterization
The in situ textured CN film (denoted as SCN film) and OCN film (denoted as SOCN-x film, where x represents the volume of hydrogen peroxide solution involved in the precursors) were deposited as shown schematically in Fig. 1a. The condensation of melamine starts with the rearrangement of melamine into melam and melem (tris-s-triazine) at approximately 390 °C (Fig. S1†), followed by further condensation at approximately 520 °C, resulting in connected networks and polymeric CN.22,23 Thus, the deposition process can be divided into two steps: (i) the condensation of the precursor (<520 °C) and (ii) the deposition of the pre-condensed product (>520 °C).

The condensation process is accompanied by the elimination of significant amounts of ammonia, leading to a high partial ammonia pressure inside the crucible. During the deposition process, the vaporized species form steam that collides with the ammonia gas molecules and hits the substrate, sticks to it, and forms a film. Therefore, the partial ammonia pressure governs the kinetic energy of the depositing species and allows film morphology to be controlled.
Recently, X. Wang et al. reported a carbon/nitrogen steam reforming reaction, during which water molecules can intercalate into CN interlayers, etch the surface, and exfoliate the layered material.24 The critical diameter of an ammonia molecule (0.26 nm) is similar to that of a water molecule (0.25 nm), implying that the released ammonia can penetrate, raise the internal pressure between CN interlayers, and etch the CN film surface. Accordingly, adjustment of the film topography is accomplished by changing the ammonia partial pressure via controlling the heating rate during the different deposition steps (Fig. S2†).
To determine the in situ texture effect on film morphology, condensed thermal vapor (ESI†) CN film (denoted CN film) was prepared for a fair comparison. The topographies of the CN, SCN, and SOCN-75 films were observed using AFM: the SCN film exhibited a smooth surface (Fig. 1c), and the surface roughness slightly increased after the O heteroatom was introduced (Fig. 1d). The CN film lacked sufficient ammonia texture and exhibited a rough surface with a small contact angle, as shown in Fig. 1b. Compared to CN film, SCN and SOCN-75 films showed larger contact angles, suggesting that the ammonia-introduced in situ texture improved the hydrophilicity of CN films. Top and cross-sectional views of the film morphologies were observed by SEM (Fig. 1e–g), and the CN film presented pyramid-like particles with an average size of approximately 600 nm. Sphere-like particles with an average size of approximately 100 nm were observed on the SCN film. After the incorporation of O heteroatoms, the size of the spherical nanoparticles on the SOCN-75 film expanded to approximately 300 nm.
It should be noted that even though the film morphology varied with different deposition routines, the thicknesses of all films were similar (55 ± 5.4 nm). The fine structure and the crystalline nature of the SOCN-75 film were further investigated using TEM. The SCN and SOCN-75 films showed a much thinner texture than the CN film due to the delamination effect caused by the ammonia atoms inserted between interlayers (Fig. 1h and S3†). The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) mapping image (Fig. 1h inset) exhibits a homogeneous distribution of C, N, and O elements in the SOCN-75 film. Fig. 1i is a high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image of the SOCN-75 film, and it shows a lattice fringe with an interplanar spacing of approximately 0.3 nm. This is consistent with the (002) crystal plane of the CN film and can be further verified by TEM-selected area electron diffraction (SAED) observation (Fig. 2i inset). The as-prepared CN, SCN, and SOCN-75 films show distinct colours in appearance (see Fig. 1j), suggesting their considerable differences in physicochemical properties.

Optical properties and electronic structure
The crystalline phases of CN, SCN, and SOCN-x films were studied using XRD patterns (Fig. S4†). The characteristic peaks that arise from CN interlayer stacking (approximately 27.7°) can be observed for all the in situ textured films. In the pristine CN films, the characteristic peak shifted to a higher degree (approximately 27.9°) due to the delamination effect as mentioned above. Additionally, the peaks of the SOCN-x films attenuated with increased amounts of O heteroatom due to the dissimilar atomic radii of O, C, and N atoms. The chemical structure of the textured films was further verified by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Ramen spectroscopy. The absence of new bands arising implies that all the films preserve the local CN structure (Fig. S5†).
The surface composition and chemical states of SCN and SOCN-x films were studied by XPS. Two distinct binding species were seen in C 1s high-resolution spectra for both SCN and SOCN-x films. Specifically, the C–NC bond locates at 288.2 eV and the absorbed sp2 C contamination locates at 284.6 eV (Fig. 2a).25 A new peak at 289.0 eV appeared in the SOCN-x film, which refers to the C–O bond and suggests the presence of O species.26,27 In Fig. 2b, three deconvoluted N 1s peaks corresponding to C–NC (398.5 eV), N–C3 (399.9 eV), and C–N–H (400.8 eV) bonds can be observed in all films.28 The lower intensity of the N–C3 peak derived from the N 1s spectra of the SOCN-x film compared to that of the SCN film provides further evidence of the replacement of N–C3 bonds with C–O bonds.
As shown in Fig. 2c, SCN films possess a single O 1s peak that is centred at 535.0 eV, which is assigned to surface-adsorbed water.29 However, a new peak at a lower binding energy of 531.5 eV emerges for SOCN-x films, which can be recognized as the C–O and N–C–O species in the lattice. After Ar+ etching, the XPS data show that the SOCN-75 film still hosts lattice oxygen, signifying that O atoms are substituting for N atoms in the film matrix (Fig. S6†). To further deduce the compositional dependence effect on physiochemical properties, the surface composition of the films was analysed by XPS (summarized in Table S2†).
To demonstrate the optical properties in component dependence, we used UV-Vis spectroscopy to analyse the CN films. Compared to the SCN film, the SOCN-75 film has an absorption edge that spans the entire visible light spectrum (cf.Fig. 3a). After O heteroatom incorporation, the absorption edge displays a significant redshift from 450 nm to over 700 nm. Unlike the conventional doping effect that causes the modified semiconductor to exhibit a tail-like absorption spectra,30–32 SOCN-75 achieved full spectrum absorption in the visible light region, suggesting that it hosts a distinguishable electronic structure with respect to its pristine counterpart.

(b) DFT-calculated total and atomic density of states (DOS) of pristine CN and OCN films. The partial DOS of O is enlarged 5 times. Side views of four-layer (c) pristine g-CN (CN) and (d) O-doped g-CN (OCN) films with seven bay-site N atoms substituted by O atoms. The layer distance is approximately 3.4 Å. The supercell geometries are optimized in a lattice constant of a = b = 21.03 Å, c = 30.0 Å, and α = β = 90°, γ = 120° by first-principles DFT calculations. The doping rate between N and O is set as 65:7 (35:4 in our experiment). The replacement of N by O at the bay site was confirmed in a previous study as the most favourable with the lowest doping energy. The grey, blue, and red colours denote C, N, and O atoms, respectively. 
Total density of states (TDOS) of pristine CN and oxygen-doped CN (OCN) films were calculated by first-principles DFT calculations (Fig. 3b) to explore the impact of the implanted O heteroatoms upon the film's electronic structure. The bay site of N for substitution by O has been confirmed to be the lowest energy position,18,33 and thus, the following calculation models regarding OCN films were based on this type of substitution by adopting the composition of SOCN-75 film (see Fig. 3c and d, surface energies for forming CN and OCN films are 0.29 and 0.28 J m−2, respectively). Based on DFT calculation results, the incorporation of O heteroatoms results in maintenance of the pristine CN bandgap, with only slight narrowing, from 1.093 to 1.003 eV. Although the bandgap of pristine CN here is underestimated compared with the experimental value (2.6 eV) due to the well-known limitations of DFT,34 the reduced shift value can reveal the alternation of the electronic structure.
To illustrate the enhancement of photon capture capability in SOCN-75 film, the difference in the TDOS between CN and OCN film was analysed (Fig. 3b). In OCN films, each O atom has one more valence electron than N so that the extra outer valence electrons of O are concentrated on the conduction band minima (CBM), which is penetrated by the Fermi level, resulting in an electron-like band structure. This electronic structure created by introducing bandgap states with film disorder will facilitate more complex transitions: (i) the electrons of CBM below the Fermi level can more easily transit to the nearby unoccupied orbitals upon longer wavelength absorption by leaving behind more holes; and (ii) the hole states localized at the CBM can provide lower unoccupied MO levels than pristine CN for electron transition from the valence band (VB) to the CBM. Consequently, although the introduced O heteroatoms in SOCN-75 film maintain a bandgap similar to that of pristine CN film, the photon absorption and the electronic transition probabilities are promoted by forming bandgap states.35–37
Estimated from Fig. S7a,† the difference between the VB position in SCN and SOCN-75 film is only approximately 0.05 eV. Combined with the DFT results, the band structure of pristine CN and OCN film is outlined (Fig. S7b†). To analyse the optical properties of the SOCN-75 film, the UV-Vis absorption spectra and the probabilities of the electronic transitions were calculated by the TD-DFT method (the one-layer nonplanar model was applied, as shown in the Fig. 3a inset, and the other structures were also adopted to calculate the UV-Vis absorption spectra and are summarized in Fig. S16†).
As shown in the Fig. 3a inset, there are two strong absorption peaks for SOCN-75, with a large absorption coefficient (the curve) nearly 40 times greater than that of the SCN film. The calculated UV-Vis spectra of SOCN-75 film is intense and broad with an absorption edge that is beyond 800 nm, implying that the SOCN-75 film possesses good capability for long wavelength photon harvesting. The oscillator strengths (blue column) of SOCN-75 representing the electron transition probability show a significant value at 451 nm and 780 nm, matching well with the experiment results. These long wavelength absorption peaks correspond to the electron transitions of the introduced O heteroatoms from CBM to nearby unoccupied orbitals above Fermi level, as revealed by DOS results.
PEC measurement
The films were evaluated as photoanodes by testing their PEC water/sulfide oxidation performance in a standard three-electrode configuration. Linear sweep voltammograms (LSV) were recorded under simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2) using an AM 1.5 G filter. As shown in Fig. 4a, the SOCN-75 film generates a sulfide oxidation photocurrent density as high as 122.1 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE. To investigate the synergistic effect of the in situ texture and the O doping, transient photocurrent density curves (i–t curves) of the CN, SCN, and SOCN-75 films were obtained, as shown in Fig. S8.†
 Fig. 4  (a) The light-chopped LSV curves. The electrolyte for water oxidation is 0.2 M Na2SO4 (pH 6.8) and for sulfide oxidation is 0.2 M Na2SO4 and 0.05 M Na2S (pH 11.7); (b) the IPCE spectra. (c) The transient photocurrent density curves of water oxidation under visible light (λ > 420 nm) illumination. (d) Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra; the inset shows a digital image of the CN films under 254 nm UV illumination. 
For PEC water oxidation, the SOCN-75 photoanodes exhibited a photocurrent density of 119.2 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE, which is over 3 times higher than that of the SCN film and 15 times higher than that of the CN film. The excellent water oxidation performance of the SOCN-75 film indicates the crucial role of both in situ texture and O incorporation in enhancing the PEC activity. As for the O doping effect, change in charge migration behaviour is expected, depending on the degree of doping. SOCN-75 film outperforms other OCN films (Fig. S9†), and thus, it is identified as the optimized film composition in this study. However, the effects of doping on PEC performance are not always beneficial, as it can somehow increase electron–hole recombination and impede charge transport with defects and traps. Therefore, to increase our understanding of the impact of the dopants on the electronic structure, the Mott–Schottky relationship was determined (Fig. S10†). Mott–Schottky measurements of SCN and SOCN-75 films show that the introduction of a higher proportion of O dopants increases the free electron density by only 1.37 times.
This phenomenon indicates that the PEC performance improvement is not simply due to the increase in charge carrier density. Indeed, one possibility is that O dopants enhance the visible light absorption as previously mentioned and is evidenced by the IPCE measurements (Fig. 4b). The SOCN-75 film showed a higher IPCE than the SCN film in the full spectrum, especially in the visible light region where the SCN film showed negligible IPCE. As a consequence, the SCN film produced nearly no photocurrent under visible light illumination (λ > 420 nm), while the SOCN-75 film generated an obvious photocurrent density of over 15 μA cm−2 (Fig. 4c).
Another possibility is that O dopants promote the charge carrier diffusion length/lifetime by passivating electron–hole recombination and facilitating the charge migration. A comparison between PEC water oxidation and sulfide oxidation reveals that sulfide significantly increased the photocurrent of SCN film, but only a negligible increase was observed for SOCN-75 film. The different impacts of sulfide on the SCN and SOCN-75 films verifies that an efficient charge separation occurs upon O dopant incorporation (Fig. S9†).
Based on the above understanding of the charge migration in SOCN-75, we measured the PL spectrum to study the charge recombination rate in SCN and SOCN-75 films. Compared with SCN film, SOCN-75 film quenched the PL intensity, indicating a lower charge recombination rate within the film (Fig. 4d). Additionally, after performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. S11†), a decreased semicircle was observed for SOCN-75 film, which demonstrated that the introduced O heteroatoms suppressed the charge transfer resistance at the electrode/electrolyte interface.38
Enhanced charge separation mechanism
Theoretical calculation clarifies how the O dopants modulate the charge migration in the films and provides substantial evidence. As shown in Fig. 5a–d, the electrons are localized around N and C atoms in the OCN films, suggesting that O dopants prevent hole/electron recombination along the plane (Fig. 5a and c) and between interlayers (Fig. 5b and d). The hole–electron distributions based on the TD-DFT calculations are shown in Fig. 5e–h (which adopts a one-layer and two-layer nonplanar model, as shown in Fig. S12†).

Each orbital is shown in top view and side view. C, N, and O atoms are coloured in grey, blue, and red, respectively. Yellow and blue regions represent the MO wave function with two opposite phases. The isovalue is set as 0.007 atomic units (a.u.) to provide a clearer illustration.

Blue and green isosurfaces represent the hole and electron distribution, respectively. The isovalue is set as 0.0001 a.u. to provide a clearer illustration. 
In CN films, the photo-induced hole and electron are homogeneously distributed over the plane and between interlayers. By contrast, the spatial distribution between photoelectron and photohole in OCN is obviously separated by spreading on different triazines. The calculation results suggest that OCN films will have a relatively longer electron/hole recombination time, which elongates the charge carrier lifetime and facilitates the charge transfer along the plane and between interlayers. Elemental O has a stronger electronegativity than N, which leads to a larger transition dipole moment upon illumination as the N is replaced by O in OCN films. O heteroatoms will spatially separate the electron and hole, which allows the electron (hole) to freely diffuse from layer to layer. The overlap of the electron distribution between interlayers is significant in OCN films (Fig. 5h), and thus serves as a conveyor belt of electrons. A large population of electrons (holes) reaches the film's surface and participates in the redox reactions before the electrons meet and recombine with holes (electrons).
The above experimental and theoretical analyses reveal the O dopant effect, and next, we will explore how the in situ texture enhances charge migration in the PEC process. The in situ textured surface is responsible for at least two beneficial effects: (i) sufficient interfacial contact between the electrode and FTO current collector, which minimizes the contact resistance at this junction; and (ii) a high electrode/electrolyte contact area that reduces the interface transfer resistance.
In addition to promoting the photocurrent, the in situ textured films exhibited robust photostability in electrolyte under illumination. After the durability test, the SCN and SOCN-75 films maintained over 95% of the initial photocurrent, while the CN film lost over 60% of its initial photocurrent. Top and cross-sectional views of SEM images of the SOCN-75 film after a 4 h stability evaluation (Fig. S13†) confirm that no collapse or structural damage occurred. Interestingly, numerous micro-size particles emerged on the film after the long-term PEC test (Fig. S14†), which were later identified as sulfur by the XPS data (Fig. S15†). It is reasonable that the sulfide existing in the electrolyte was continuously oxidized by the photoholes and resulted in epitaxial sulfur on the film's surface.
Conclusions
In summary, we prepared in situ textured CN films with bandgap states that possess remarkable capabilities of visible light harvesting and charge migration enhancement. After a rational design of topography and composition, the SOCN-75 film delivered a photocurrent density of 119.2 μA cm−2 at 1.23 V vs. RHE without any hole scavengers. Such a high photocurrent density is a consequence of enhanced charge separation at the collector/electrode and electrode/electrolyte interfaces, which is attributed to in situ textured film topography. Additionally, introducing O heteroatoms leads to the formation of bandgap states, and allows a full range of visible light absorption. Furthermore, O dopants spatially separate the photogenerated electron (hole) and construct a conveyor belt of electrons between interlayers.
This research may provide an effective strategy for simultaneously improving the light harvesting capability and charge separation efficiency throughout a photoelectrode, with considerable prospects towards practical application of CN-based PEC cells.
