    , Accepted 9th November 2016First published on 10th November 2016AbstractThe emergence of inorganic–organic lead-halide perovskites has revolutionized solar cells due to their high power conversion efficiency; however, the toxicity of Pb leads to severe environmental concerns for their large-scale implementation. It is thus of great interest to explore non-toxic alternative materials for overcoming the existing energy challenge. In the present paper, we have investigated a nontoxic layered heavy-element compound BiI3 and its single layer comparatively using density functional theory with and without spin—orbit coupling (SOC) effect. The SOC effect is found to play a decisive role in the band gap and band edge of single layer BiI3. Our results indicate that single-layer BiI3 can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystal and can be stable even above 600 K, as confirmed by the phonon dispersions and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. The PBE + SOC calculation predicts that the single-layer BiI3 has an indirect band gap of 1.63 eV and high absorption for visible light. Moreover, we also find that the electronic structure of single-layer BiI3 can be tuned by biaxial strain and a small compressive strain of about 4% can make the absolute band edges straddle water redox potentials. Finally, the predicted acoustic-phonon-limited carrier mobilities are electron dominated and highly asymmetric. And the electron mobilities are found to be above 200 cm2 V−1 s−1. The unique combination of the suitable energy gap, tunable band edge, and moderate carrier mobilities predicted here makes single-layer BiI3 a promising candidate for future low-dimensional solar energy conversion applications.
1 Introduction
Seeking sustainable and cost effective alternative energy sources for depleting fossil fuels is crucial to meet the currently growing energy demand. Due to its wide availability and environmental friendliness, solar energy is one of the most important renewable energy resources. The development of novel low-cost and highly efficient solar energy conversion materials is regarded as one of the most promising solutions to overcome the existing energy challenge. In the past few years, inorganic–organic lead-halide perovskites1–4 have emerged as one of the most promising materials for next-generation solar devices owing to their high power conversion efficiency up to 22%.4 Meanwhile, they are also proposed for other applications such as light-emitting diodes, lasers and photo-detectors.3 Nevertheless, the toxicity of lead raises substantial concerns about the potential environmental issues of these materials.5
Recently, various alternative materials including novel all-inorganic perovskites6,7 and phosphorene-based materials8,9 have been predicted and synthesized, which show promising potential for optoelectronic application. As a more environmentally friendly alternative for Pb, bismuth-based photovoltaics such as Bi-based perovskites10 and photo-catalytic materials like BiOX (X = Cl, Br, I)11,12 have also received a lot of attention. Similar to Pb, Bi has a large element number and significant relativistic effects, which thus leads to exotic physics and diverse properties. As a typical bismuth-based compound, BiI3 was known as a promising material for room temperature gamma-ray detectors for a long time due to the high atomic numbers of the constituent elements and high mass density. It crystallizes in a layered structure with space group R, in which the I–Bi–I trilayers stacked along the [001] direction in a hexagonal lattice with a large van der Waals gap as shown in Fig. 1(a). And the Bi3+ ions are coordinated by edge-sharing octahedra surrounded with six I ions within the atomic plane. Due to its technological importance, the optical properties of BiI3 have been extensively investigated. However, there are still some lively debates about the character and size of the energy gap.13–17 Most of the studies13–17 have agreed that BiI3 has an indirect energy gap of about 1.6–1.8 eV. Recently, BiI3 has also been proposed as a candidate for energy application. Using optical (UV-Vis) absorption, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and HSE06 calculations, Lehner et al.15 have determined the absolute band positions of BiI3 and suggested its promising optoelectronic properties. Guided by the predictive discovery framework, E. Brandt et al.16 also suggested bismuth triiodide (BiI3) as a candidate for thin-film photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. They found that BiI3 demonstrated a band gap of 1.8 eV and an absorption coefficient >105 cm−1 in the visible region of the solar spectrum. On the other hand, due to the weak interlayer vdW bonding between I–Bi–I trilayers, it is thus possible to exfoliate single-layer nano-sheets from the layered BiI3 materials.18 The quantum confinement of electrons in single-layer materials is expected to lead to intriguing electronic and optical properties distinguished from their bulk, which has been evidenced in the case of graphene and MoS2 monolayers. It is thus interesting to explore the fascinating physical properties of such an intriguing single-layer material.

Very recently, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites19 have been made into atomically thin two-dimensional (2D) sheets, which are also found to exhibit efficient photoluminescence, color-tunability, and unique structural relaxation. This study opens up opportunities for fundamental research on atomically thin 2D hybrid perovskites. However, the presence of organic cations complexes the determination of the geometry and thus the modification of various physical properties. Considering the fact that Bi3+ has the same electronic configuration and similar large relativistic effects to Pb2+ in lead hybrid perovskites, detailed knowledge about the electronic and optical properties of single-layer BiI3 should also be insightful to understand low-dimensional organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites.
In the present paper, we have investigated BiI3 and its single layer systematically. The technologically important physical properties including its electronic structure, optical properties, band edge and carrier mobility are given in detail. The role of spin–orbital coupling is emphasized especially in the calculations. Phonon dispersion calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are also performed to evaluate the stability of the single layer. The obtained geometries and electronic structures are then compared with the available experimental data. Our calculations indicate that single-layer BiI3 is a stable two-dimensional semiconductor with a suitable band gap, good absorption for visible light, tunable band edge and moderate carrier mobility.
2 Computational details
The present calculations have been performed using the Vienna ab initio simulation package (VASP) code20,21 within the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method22,23 and general gradient approximations (GGA) in Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) implementation.24 To calculate the van der Waals forces between I–Bi–I trilayers, non-local van der Waals density functionals in the form of optB88-vdW25,26 are used, in which charge density dependent non-local interaction is included. Our previous studies indicate that optB88-vdW can give a much improved description for various vdW-binding systems including graphene/metal interfaces27 and layered CrX3 materials.28 The screened hybrid functional HSE06,29,30 in which 25% short-ranged exchange of the PBE functional is replaced by the self-energy-free exact Hartree–Fock (HF) exchange energy, is used in calculating the electronic structure and optical properties. Since spin–orbit coupling effects are known to increase roughly with Z2 (Z is the nuclear charge), it should affect the physical properties of the present heavy-element BiI3 system significantly. To evaluate the importance of the SOC effect, we perform comparative calculations for BiI3 with and without SOC. A plane-wave basis set with a cutoff energy of 500 eV is used in the calculation, which can ensure that the total energy converges to 1 meV per atom. K-Points with a mesh of 6 × 6 × 6 generated by the scheme of Monkhorst–Pack31 are used for sampling the Brillouin zone of bulk BiI3 as shown in Fig. 1(d). A large vacuum space of 18 Å is included in the supercell of the monolayer to avoid interaction between images, and a 6 × 6 × 1 mesh is used for a single-layer BiI3 (Fig. 2). All the lattice constants and atomic coordinates are optimized until the maximum force on all atoms is less than 5 × 10−3 eV Å−1. The phonon calculations have been performed using the finite displacement approach, as implemented in the Phonopy code,32 in which a 5 × 5 × 1 supercell and a displacement of 0.01 Å from the equilibrium atomic positions are employed. Moreover, ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a canonical (NVT) ensemble using the Nosé heat bath scheme are performed up to 8 ps with a time step of 2 fs at different temperatures to examine the thermal stability of the single-layer BiI3. To minimize the constraint of periodic boundary conditions, a large (4 × 4) supercell is used in the MD calculations. The absorption coefficient α(ω) is calculated using  in which n is the index of refraction given by ε1 and ε2 are the real and imaginary parts of the frequency-dependent dielectric function in the independent-particle (IP) picture, and c is the speed of light in vacuo.

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Structure, cleavage and stability
As shown above, BiI3 consists of I–Bi–I trilayers binding with weak vdW interaction. It is well established that the vdW interaction challenges the widely used (semi-)local functional such as LDA and PBE, and we thus use non-local van der Waals density functional optB88-vdW25,26 to investigate the structure of bulk BiI3. As shown in Table 1, the PBE functional significantly overestimates the lattice parameters, especially c, by about 10%. When the SOC effect is considered, the calculation seems to give even worse results. The good agreement between theory and experiment can be only achieved when vdW interactions are included in the optB88-vdW functional. It should be noticed that the optB88-vdW functional not only predicted the reasonable out-of-plane lattice parameter c but also gave a very close in-plane lattice parameter a to the experimental one. We thus use this functional to calculate the cleavage energy of BiI3. However, the non-local vdW correlation in the present optB88-vdW functional is evaluated on total densities on collinear calculation but not for non-collinear spin–orbit calculations. Further effort should be made to include non-local vdW correlation in non-collinear SOC calculation. Following the previous procedure for layered materials,28 we increase the interlayer distance d between I–Bi–I trilayers to simulate the exfoliation procedure. As shown in Fig. 1(b), the energy increases with d gradually and converges to the cleavage energy of about 0.25 J m−2. And the theoretical cleavage strength is about 1 GPa, which is given by the maximum derivative of the cleavage energy. The obtained cleavage energy is smaller than the experimentally estimated cleavage energy of graphite (0.36 J m−2)33 and the theoretical value of other similar systems like CrX3 (0.28 to 0.30 J m−2). This indicates that it is easy to exfoliate single layers from bulk BiI3 experimentally, which was also confirmed by Ma et al.'s work.18 On the other hand, van der Waals epitaxial growth is known as a promising way to produce 2D materials. It is also noticed that a highly perfect single crystal BiI3 film has been obtained on PbI2 and CdI2 substrates by Takeyama et al. using van der Waals epitaxial growth.34 Thus, it can be expected that such a vdW epitaxial growth can be used to produce single-layer BiI3 under optimized conditions. The structure of exfoliated single layer BiI3 is shown in Fig. 2. We can find that the Bi3+ ions coordinated by edge-sharing octahedra surrounded with six I− ions are arranged into a honeycomb lattice. The lattice parameter remains almost invariant compared with the bulk materials.

To further confirm the stability of free-standing single-layer BiI3, phonon calculations and NVT ab initio molecular dynamics simulations were also performed. Since the strong SOC effect is expected in the case of BiI3, we also calculate the phonon dispersion of single-layer BiI3 using the PBE functional with and without SOC. As shown in Fig. 3, the imaginary frequency is found to be absent in both calculations around the whole Brillouin zone. This suggests that the single layer BiI3 is dynamically stable and can exist as a freestanding 2D crystal. According to group theory and the symmetry of single-layer BiI3, the irreducible representation of the phonon modes at the Γ point is given by Γ = 4Ag + 4Au + 42Eg + 42Eu, whereas 2Eg/u modes are doubly degenerate. We have also labeled the eigen-frequencies for Raman modes in Fig. 4, which is provided for further experimental verification. Interestingly, we find that SOC softens the phonon modes slightly, which is in agreement with the larger in-plane lattice parameter given by PBE + SOC calculation.

Furthermore, we have also performed ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for the single-layer BiI3 at 300 K, 600 K and 900 K. The evolution of the total potential energy with simulation time and the final snapshot after 8 ps are shown in Fig. 5. The total potential energies at 300 K and 600 K also remain almost invariant during the simulation but the amplitude of the oscillation increases at 900 K. Our results also indicate that the honeycomb network of the Bi3+ ions, octahedra of BiI6 and hexatomic ring of the I− ions in the hole region remain unchanged basically under 300 K. As the temperature increases to 600 K, the distortion of octahedra of BiI6 increases significantly but the honeycomb network still remains. At 900 K, the octahedral and honeycomb networks seem to be destroyed and the hexatomic ring of the I− ions becomes disordered fully. This suggests that the single layer BiI3 is unstable at 900 K but thermally stable at about 600 K.

3.2 Electronic structures and optical properties
Now, we turn our attention to the electronic structures and optical properties of single-layer BiI3. Since the PBE functional usually underestimates the energy band gap of materials, HSE06 calculations, which included parts of exact exchange, were also performed for comparison. Our calculations indicate that both PBE and HSE06 calculations predict BiI3 as a semiconductor with an indirect gap and the spin–orbital coupling effect has a quite important effect on the electronic structure. As shown in Fig. 6, SOC lowers the conduction band largely but affects the valence band only slightly. This asymmetrical behavior between the valence and conduction bands leads to the energy gap difference calculated with and without SOC to be larger than 1 eV in the case of bulk systems. We also find that HSE06 and PBE functionals give a quite similar band structure except for the size of the energy gap. Recently, J. Podraza et al.13 have confirmed that a BiI3 single crystal has an indirect band gap of 1.67 ± 0.09 eV. As shown in Table 2, the PBE + SOC calculations give the closest value (1.56 eV) to the experimental value among all methods. And the value (2.12 eV) obtained by the HSE06 + SOC method is slightly larger than the experimental value but seems to be reasonable considering the uncertainty of the experiment. However, the calculations without SOC overestimate the gap significantly. Generally, the self-interaction error in the (semi)-local functional is known to lead to the substantial underestimation of the energy gap of materials. However, for main-group compounds with heavy elements such as BiI3 focused here, the relativistic effect from the heavy constituent elements plays a more crucial role and has to be considered explicitly in the electronic structure calculation. When the material is exfoliated into single layers, the energy gap increases slightly from 1.56 eV to 1.63 eV and the band gap nature remains still indirect (Fig. 7). This gap is similar to that of silicon and inorganic–organic lead-halide perovskites and thus suitable for electronic and optoelectronic application.

As shown in Fig. 8, both PBE and HSE06 calculations indicate that the valence band states near the Fermi level are dominated by I-p states where Bi-p states hybridized with the I-p states in the energy range from −4 to −2 eV and the conduction band. When SOC is included in the calculations, all electronic states broaden a little. The I-p states still dominate the valence band. While the conduction states move towards the low energy region and narrow the energy gap. Meanwhile, CB states are also split into two parts distinctly due to degenerate states and the destroyed symmetry induced by SOC. The density of states of single-layer BiI3 are very similar to that of the bulk states. PBE gives a similar DOS to HSE06 while the SOC plays a decisive role in electronic states (Fig. 9).

The optical properties of BiI3 have received a large amount of attention recently. We thus also calculated the optical properties of BiI3. Fig. 10 and 11 show the calculated optical absorption coefficient of bulk and monolayer BiI3 using different functionals. Our results demonstrate that both bulk and single-layer BiI3 can absorb visible light effectively. The strong absorption for visible light implies that BiI3 can be a potential candidate for highly effective photovoltaic applications. In addition, we also find anisotropic optical properties between the x(y) axis and z axis, in agreement with an earlier experimental report.36 As shown in the figure, the band edge of the first absorption peak along x(y) directions is about 0.4 eV lower than that along z directions in the PBE + SOC calculations.

3.3 Band edge and photocatalytic properties
The production of hydrogen from photocatalytic water splitting, which provides a clean and renewable energy source, has attracted increasing interest recently. Generally, the band edges of potential materials for photocatalytically splitting water must straddle water redox potentials. In particular, the conduction band minimum energy EAbsCBM is higher than the reduction potential of H+/H2 (−4.44 eV) and the valence band maximum energy EAbsVBM is lower than the oxidation potential of O2/H2O (−5.67 eV). On the other hand, the absolute band edge of semiconductors is also an important and necessary parameter in material and device design. According to the definition, the absolute band edge is calculated by EAbsCBM/VBM = EDFTCBM/VBM − Vvacuum, where the EDFTCBM/VBM is the eigenvalue of VBM/CBM obtained in the DFT calculation directly and Vvacuum represents the electrostatic potential in the vacuum region. As shown in Table 3 and Fig. 12, the calculations using the PBE (HSE06) functional without SOC predict the EAbsVBM and EAbsCBM to be −6.60(−7.19) eV and −4.01(−3.91) eV. It seems that BiI3 fulfils the previous requirements of photocatalysis. However, when the SOC is considered, the EAbsVBM and EAbsCBM obtained using PBE + SOC (HSE06 + SOC) changed to −6.33(−6.93) eV and −4.70(−4.71) eV. Compared with the water reduction and oxidation potentials shown in Fig. 12, we can find that the VBM is energetically favorable for oxygen evolution but the CBM is insufficient to drive hydrogen evolution. As shown above, although the band edge energy of single-layer BiI3 is dependent on the methods used in the calculations, the qualitative conclusion of justification for photocatalysis seems to be only affected by the spin–orbital coupling effect but not by the exchange–correlation functional. This can be understood by the fact that although KS-DFT with approximated xc functionals cannot predict accurate band gaps and band edges, it can nevertheless give the band gap center (BGC) defined by the average of the VBM and CBM energies reasonably.37,38 As shown in Table 3, the deviation of the band gap center between PBE and HSE06 is within 0.2 eV, which is thus too small to alter the relative magnitude of EAbsCBM and the reduction potential of H+/H2 (−4.44 eV). This also confirms the widely used band-gap-center model approximation. As discussed in Sec. 3.2, when the SOC is included, the CBM and VBM relative to the Fermi level move in an asymmetrical way. The larger change in the amplitude of the CBM then lowers the EAbsCBM pronouncedly below −4.44 eV, and thus gives a qualitatively different conclusion about photocatalysis.

 Fig. 12  The absolute band edge of single-layer BiI3 calculated using PBE, PBE + SOC, HSE and HSE + SOC methods. 
It should be pointed out that although monolayer BiI3 is not an intrinsic photocatalyst, its CBM energy (−4.7 eV) is very close to the reduction potential of H+/H2 (−4.44 eV). To drive hydrogen evolution, only a very small bias potential of 0.3 V is required, which is much smaller than that in other systems and should be feasible in experiments. For example, a bias potential of at least 0.9 V is needed for single-layer SnS2 to proceed water splitting,39 which is evidenced as an efficient photocatalyst for water splitting experimentally.40 To further tune the band edge, we also investigate the electronic structure of monolayer BiI3 by biaxial strain engineering. As shown in Fig. 13, both PBE + SOC and HSE06 + SOC results indicate that the biaxial strains not only tune the energy gap but also the band edge gradually. Compressive strains enlarge the band gap and shift the band edge energy linearly. It is interesting to notice that the band gap of the BiI3 monolayer increases to 2.38 eV and the CBM and VBM energies shift to −4.65 and −7.03 eV under about 4% biaxial compressive strain. Moreover, we can also find that the band edges of the BiI3 monolayer with strain from −4% to −10% straddle water redox potentials and these results are independent of the exchange–correlation used in the calculations. This indicates that the strained BiI3 monolayer should be a potential photocatalyst for water splitting. It should be pointed out that an appropriate 2D semiconductor to facilitate photocatalytic water-splitting should also satisfy the other conditions like insolubility in water.41 From a practical point of view, there are still many issues to be overcome, which is nevertheless beyond the present study.

3.4 Mobility
High carrier mobility is also a necessary requirement for efficient energy conversion materials. For inorganic semiconductors like BiI3, the coherent wavelength of thermally activated electrons or holes at room temperature is much larger than their lattice constant and is close to that of acoustic phonon modes in the center of the Brillouin zone. The electron–acoustic phonon coupling thus dominated the scattering of thermally activated electrons or holes, which can be effectively calculated by the deformation potential (DP) theory proposed by Bardeen and Shockley.42,43 We thus estimate the carrier mobility of single-layer BiI3 using an acoustic-phonon-limited scattering model based on deformation potential (DP) theory and effective mass approximation, in which only the primary scattering mechanism due to acoustic phonons is considered. To demonstrate different carrier transport directions along the armchair (x) and zigzag (y) directions, we build a rectangular supercell as shown as blue dashed lines in Fig. 2(a).
The acoustic-phonon-limited carrier mobilities are given by (1)
The carrier effective mass  in the transport direction is given by . And the average effective mass md is determined by . The term Ei1 represents the deformation potential constant of the valence-band minimum for holes or the conduction-band maximum for electrons along the transport direction, defined by . Here ΔV is the energy change of the valence band (conduction-band) under appropriate strain, l0 is the lattice constant in the transport direction and Δl is the deformation of l0. The elastic modulus C2D in x and y directions is derived from (E − E0)/S0 = C(Δl/l0)/2, where E is the total energy and S0 is the equilibrium area of a 2D system. All data are calculated using a strain step of 0.5%. The temperature used for the mobility calculations was 300 K.
It should be noticed that the carrier mobility seems to be sensitive to the geometry used in the calculations. As discussed in Sec. 3.1, optB88-vdW gives the closest in-plane lattice parameter to the experimental value among all used methods. And the electronic structure is found to be influenced by the SOC effect seriously but insensitive to the exchange–correlation functional. We thus used the optB88 functional to relax the atomic structure of strained single layers and then applied the PBE + SOC method to obtain their electronic structures. The elastic modulus is derived using the optB88-vdW functional directly whereas the carrier effective mass and deformation potential constants are predicted using the electronic structure using PBE + SOC on the basis of the structure obtained by using the optB88-vdW functional. The evolution of the band gap with strain and the eigenvalue of the valence band and conduction band near extreme points are shown in Fig. 14 and the fitting data are also shown in Table 4. We can find that both the deformation potential and carrier effective mass show a very weak direction-dependence except for the effective mass of holes. However, they exhibit a very strong asymmetry between electrons and holes. The effective mass of holes is found to be much larger than that of electrons. Moreover, the deformation potential of the VBM (∼2.2 eV) is also found to be larger than that of the CBM (∼1.6 eV). It should be noticed that the deformation potential predicted here seems to be smaller than that of few-layer black phosphorus with high mobility. However, as shown in an early experiment,16 BiI3 is a very soft material. The elastic modulus C2D is indeed only 14 J m−1, much smaller than that of graphene44 and black phosphorus.45 The resulting electron mobility of single-layer BiI3 is about 200 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is smaller than that of black phosphorus but comparable with that of monolayer MoS2 (∼217 cm2 V−1 s−1).43 As shown above, the pristine BiI3 monolayer has a suitable band gap for electronic and optoelectronic application. Combined with the present predicted moderate electron mobility, we thus suggested that the BiI3 monolayer should be an important candidate for electronic and optoelectronic device application. Moreover, we also find that the predicted electron mobility (212 cm2 V−1 s−1) along y(x) is about 27.7(6.6) times the value of holes in the same direction, implying that the carrier mobility is highly asymmetric between electrons and holes, and the carrier transport behaviour is electron dominated. Such an asymmetry should be beneficial to lower the recombination of the photo-generated electron–hole pairs if the material is used for photocatalysis. We also evaluate the carrier mobility of single-layer BiI3 using the PBE functional without SOC and also found a similar asymmetry but a lower mobility.

In the present paper, we have investigated the geometry, electronic structure and optical properties of layered BiI3 and its single layer systematically. Our results indicate that the optB88-vdW functional can describe the interlayer vdW interaction of bulk BiI3 quite well while PBE(HSE06) + SOC calculations give a consistent band gap with the experimental one. The predicted low cleavage energy indicates that single-layer BiI3 can be easily exfoliated from the bulk crystal and its stability has also been confirmed by the phonon dispersion calculation and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Moreover, we also find that the electronic structure and band edge are insensitive to the exchange–correlation functional but determined by the SOC effect. PBE + SOC calculation suggested that single-layer BiI3 possesses an electronic gap of about 1.63 eV and high absorption for visible light, which are suitable for electronic and photovoltaic applications. Moreover, biaxial strains are found to affect the band edge largely, and a small compressive strain of about 4% can make absolute band edges straddle water redox potentials. The predicted acoustic-phonon-limited carrier mobilities are electron dominated and can be also comparable with those of monolayer MoS2. The high absorption for visible light, tunable band edge and moderate carrier mobility of single-layer BiI3 make it a good candidate for future low dimensional electronic and optoelectronic applications.
