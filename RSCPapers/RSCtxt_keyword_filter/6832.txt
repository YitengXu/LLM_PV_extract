, Accepted 15th September 2016First published on 16th September 2016AbstractPbI2 layers with a mesoporous structure are facilely prepared by spin coating of PbI2 in DMF solution with n-butanol additive, which can improve crystallization and modify the orientation of the MAPbI3 layers produced by an interface reaction. The recombination and charge transfer process are improved in the perovskite solar cells with these harvester layers.
The perovskite solar cell is a kind of low cost photovoltaic device with excellent solar-to-electric efficiency, and uses hybrid organic/inorganic lead halide with a perovskite structure as the light harvester layer.1–4 Although the perovskite solar cell is a new emerging device, extensive investigations have been performed in the last 5 years.5–16 CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) is one of the most efficient perovskite materials in the literature, and it is found that the quality of MAPbI3 layers can remarkably affect the performance of perovskite solar cells.17–22
MAPbI3 layers can be fabricated by the interface reaction with CH3NH3I (MAI) precursor after preparing PbI2 layers on the substrates. Recently several reports indicate that the property of PbI2 layers can affect the interface reaction process remarkably. The PbI2 layers are usually produced by spin coating of PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) solution, and their morphology can be controlled by several preparing conditions, such as solution concentration,23 spin coating speed,24 growing time.25 Detail studies indicate that the morphology of PbI2 layers influences the crystallization of MAPbI3 layers.
In the solution process for fabricating PbI2 layers, the property of solvent can also influence the resulted films. Strong coordinative dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), instead of DMF, as the solvent for PbI2 is reported, which results in extremely uniform and amorphous PbI2 films.26 A small amount of tertbutyl pyridine or halogen acid is used as additive in the PbI2 precursor solutions, which significantly improves the uniformity and coverage of MAPbI3 film.27,28 Solvent post treatment is also an effective method for tuning the property of PbI2 layers, such as isopropanol,29 DMF vapor,30 toluene and chlorobenzene vapors.31 These reports indicate that PbI2 layers with suitable porosity facilitate the interface reaction between MAI precursor and PbI2 layers, which leads to a complete transformation to MAPbI3 with improved crystallization. Therefore, a facile method of tuning PbI2 layers is desirable for promoting the quality of MAPbI3 layers.
In this study, we control the property of PbI2 layers by modifying the precursor solution with n-butanol additive. It is found that n-butanol additive can generate a mesoporous structure in the PbI2 layers, which improves the crystallization and modifies the crystalline orientation of MAPbI3 layers. Perovskite solar cells are assembled with these MAPbI3 layers, and their photoelectric properties are studied.
FTO glass substrates were etched by Zn powder in HCl solution and cleaned by ultrasonic bath. Compact TiO2 films were deposited by spray pyrolysis with 50 mmol L−1 Ti(OPr)2(acetylacetonate)2 in ethanol solution at 450 °C. Mesoporous TiO2 films were spincoated with TiO2 paste solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the samples were dried and sintered at 100 °C for 30 min, 125 °C for 30 min, 325 °C for 30 min and 500 °C for 30 min. After further treatment with 40 mM TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, the samples were rinsed with water and ethanol, and sintered at 450 °C for 30 min. Then, PbI2 films were spincoated on the samples by 462 mg mL−1 PbI2 in DMF solution with and without 5 v% n-butanol (BuOH) additive at 4000 rpm for 30 s. MAPbI3 layers were formed by the spray reaction method as previous report.32 The spiro-MeOTAD hole conductor layers were deposited by spin coating at 4000 rpm for 20 s. After being aged in the dried air condition for 12 hours, silver electrodes were deposited to complete the devices. The experiment details can be found in the ESI.†
Fig. 1a and b show the surface morphology of PbI2 layers prepared by spin coating with PbI2 in DMF solutions without and with BuOH additive, respectively. Although both solutions can produce smooth PbI2 layers, their microstructure is obviously different. The DMF solution produces a PbI2 layer with relative compact structure, while a mesoporous structure with relative large grain size is obtained by the DMF/BuOH mixed solution. The porous structure is likely related to the increase of supersaturation in the PbI2 solution by BuOH additive (Fig. S1†), which leads to a fast precipitation of PbI2 and then generates the space of pores by slow evaporated solvent. These two kinds of PbI2 layers are converted to MAPbI3 layers by an interface reaction with MAI precursor, and the surface morphology of these MAPbI3 layers is shown in Fig. 1c and d, respectively. The SEM images indicate that both kinds of PbI2 layers can lead to even MAPbI3 layers with compact structure, but the grain size of these MAPbI3 layers is different. The PbI2 layer with DMF/BuOH mixed solution can produce MAPbI3 layer with average grain size of 596 nm, which is larger than the average grain size (248 nm) of MAPbI3 layer produced from the PbI2 layer without the aid of BuOH additive. This result means the morphology of PbI2 layers affects the crystallization of MAPbI3 layers. The mesoporous structure of PbI2 layers can provide the transport channel of MAI precursor, and the pores also provide the space for grain expanding in the conversion from PbI2 to MAPbI3. Therefore, the PbI2 layers with mesoporous structure are beneficial for creating MAPbI3 layers with large grains.

(e) XRD patterns of above samples, peaks assigned to MAPbI3, PbI2 and FTO are marked with solid circle, triangle and open circle, respectively. The scale bar is 1 μm. 
We perform the XRD characterization for these two kinds of PbI2 layers as shown in Fig. 1e. The XRD peaks of 14.2° can be assigned to the diffraction from (001) lattice planes of hexagonal phase, which illustrates the preferential orientation of PbI2 layers along the caxis.11 In the XRD measurement, the PbI2 layers with/without BuOH additive have quite similar XRD patterns. Therefore, BuOH additive does not affect the crystal structure and orientation of spincoated PbI2 layers. After the interface reaction with MAI precursor, a series of new peaks emerges in the XRD patterns, which can be assigned to the diffraction from (110), (220), and (310) lattice planes of MAPbI3 with tetragonal structure, and the diffraction peaks of PbI2 are disappeared simultaneously.24 It means that pure MAPbI3 layers with tetragonal structure can be obtained for both kinds of PbI2 layers. For the MAPbI3 layer produced without BuOH additive, both the first-order (110) and second-order (220) diffractions from (110) lattice planes give intensive diffraction peaks. After the addition of 5 v% BuOH, the first-order (110) diffraction peak attenuates remarkably. It indicates that the dihedral angle between (110) planes and substrate plane increases, which induces the attenuation of small angle diffraction from (110) planes. Therefore, BuOH additive can modify the orientation of crystalline in MAPbI3 layers. MaPbI3 layers are prepared by a reaction between PbI2 layers and CH3NH3I precursor. For the PbI2 layers produced without BuOH additive, the compact structure leads to a diffusion limited reaction. It means that CH3NH3I precursor needs to diffuse in the PbI2 layers for this reaction. And it is also noted that MAPbI3 crystalline likely grows in the vertical direction of substrate planes for the compact PbI2 layers. For the PbI2 layers produced with BuOH additive, the porous structure provides additional transport channels for CH3NH3I precursor. The reaction can take place at the bottom part of PbI2 films rapidly. And the porous structure of PbI2 layers also provides the feasibility of three dimension growth for MAPbI3 crystalline. The different orientation of crystalline in these two kinds of MAPbI3 layers is likely related with the difference in reaction process and crystal growth.
These two kinds of MAPbI3 layers are used for assembling perovskite solar cells, and typical photocurrent density–photovoltage curves illustrate in Fig. 2. For the MAPbI3 layer without BuOH additive, the solar cell gives a power conversion efficient (PCE) of 13.8% with photocurrent density of 20.5 mA cm−2, photovoltage of 1.01 V and fill factor of 0.67. By introducing the BuOH additive, the PCE of corresponding device increases to 15.5%. Although both kinds of devices have similar photocurrent and fillfactor, photovoltage can be remarkably increased by using BuOH additive for preparing MAPbI3 light harvester layers. This improvement is confirmed by the statistical analysis of 30 devices in Fig. S2 and S3,† and the best device with BuOH additive reaches a PCE of 17.2%. The SEM images and XRD patterns indicate that BuOH additive can increase the grain size and modify the crystalline orientation in the MAPbI3 layers. These properties usually affect the recombination process and the interface charge transfer process in perovskite solar cells.

We perform the impedance measurement to analyze the recombination and charge transfer in the perovskite solar cells.33 Fig. 3 shows the Nyquist plots of two kinds of devices under constant illumination at an applied potential of 0.9 V. In the impedance spectra, both devices with and without BuOH additive have three impedance arches. As previous reports, the high frequency arch can be assigned to the charge transfer process at the interface between MAPbI3 layers and selective contacts, and the middle frequency arch is assigned to the recombination process in the MAPbI3 layers. After fitting the impedance spectra with the equivalent circuit (Fig. 3), the recombination resistance and charge transfer resistance are extracted for both kinds of devices. By adding BuOH additive in the fabrication process of MAPbI3, the recombination resistance increases from 35 Ω to 88 Ω and the interface charge transfer resistance decreases from 195 Ω to 156 Ω. This means that BuOH additive can decrease the recombination of photoelectrons in the MAPbI3 layers and promote the charge transfer at MAPbI3/selective contact interface. SEM images indicate that BuOH additive induces large grain size and low density of grain interfaces, which is in accordance with the decrease of recombination in the MAPbI3 layers. The low frequency arch of Nyquist plot reflects a slow dynamic process, and it is related to the dielectric relaxation of perovskite materials in previous reports.34 The time constant of this process can be expressed by the multiplication of low frequency capacitance (Clf) and low frequency resistance (Rlf), which are extracted from the low frequency impedance arch by fitting with the equivalent circuit. The device assembled with BuOH additive has a shorter time constant (1.64 s) than that of device assembled without BuOH additive (2.61 s). A fast dielectric relaxation usually promotes the response speed and reduces the hysteresis in perovskite solar cells.

Photoluminescence (PL) is a facial tool for analysis the charge separation at the interface between MAPbI3 layers and selective contact layers.35 We measured the PL spectra of MAPbI3 layers with and without TiO2 selective contact for evaluating the charge transfer process at MAPbI3/TiO2 interfaces. Fig. 4a shows the PL spectra with the excitation of 532 nm light from glass substrate side. For the PL spectra of MAPbI3 layers on glass substrates, the PL intensity of films with BuOH additive is a little higher than that of films without BuOH additive, which can be related to the increase of grain size in the MAPbI3 layer by adding BuOH. After inserting the TiO2 electron selective contact under MAPbI3 layers, the PL intensity from both kinds of MAPbI3 layers is quenched remarkably. It means that TiO2 extracts photoelectrons from the MAPbI3 layers. The PL intensity of MAPbI3 with BuOH additive quenches to 11% of the original PL intensity without TiO2 layers, while the PL intensity quenches to 18% for MAPbI3 layers without BuOH additive. This result indicates that BuOH additive can improve the charge separation process at MAPbI3/TiO2 interfaces. As shown in Fig. 4a, the peaks of PL spectra from both kinds of MAPbI3 layers locate at 786 nm, while they blue-shift to 779 nm by contacting with TiO2 layers. In previous reports,36 the blue-shift of PL spectra is attributed to the passivation of spontaneous radiative recombination from the trap states of MAPbI3 layers. As the excitation light of 532 nm has much less penetration length than the thickness of TiO2 porous layers, the PL spectra come from the porous TiO2/perovskite mixed layers. The porous TiO2 likely has the function of passivating trap states in MAPbI3 layers. We also perform PL measurement by exciting the MAPbI3 layer from top side in Fig. 4b. Although the PL intensity without TiO2 selective contact is similar with that of Fig. 4a, the quenching of PL peaks is different after inserting TiO2 layers. In Fig. 4b, the PL intensity quenches to 20% for the MAPbI3 with BuOH additive, and it quenches to 75% for the film without BuOH additive. Therefore, BuOH additive can remarkably increase the charge extraction from the top side of MAPbI3 layers. The above result is also in accordance with the low charge transfer resistance in the impedance measurement for MAPbI3 layers with BuOH additive. As the (110) diffraction peak of MAPbI3 layers attenuates by BuOH additive in the XRD patterns, the improved interface charge extraction is likely related to the modification of crystal orientation in MAPbI3 layers. The photovoltage of perovskite solar cells is determined by the fermi level of TiO2 layers under illumination. The improvement of charge extraction and recombination can increase the charge density in TiO2 layers, which is beneficial for promoting the fermi level position.

Conclusions
In summary, we investigate n-butanol as the additive for tuning the morphology of spincoated PbI2 layers, and these PbI2 layers are beneficial for preparing high quality MAPbI3 layers in perovskite solar cells. Detail studies indicate that BuOH additive can create mesoporous PbI2 layers with large grain size, which can induce the large grain size and preferential orientation in the MAPbI3 layers. The photoelectric measurement shows that BuOH additive increases the photovoltage of perovskite solar cells, and the PCE of devices increase from 13.8% to 15.5% by this improvement. The impedance spectra and PL spectra indicate that BuOH additive can suppress the recombination process and improve the charge extraction process. We think this BuOH additive can be general applied in the two step assembling method of perovskite solar cells.
