    , Accepted 28th April 2023First published on 16th May 2023AbstractTwo-dimensional metallic halide perovskites with interlayer alternating cations (ACI) have shown great potential in photovoltaics. Compared to their Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) and Dion–Jacobson (DJ) counterparts, ACI perovskites have a narrower band gap (Eg) and enhanced optical absorption. However, the relatively low power conversion efficiency (PCE) hampers the development of ACI-based devices due to their crystal orientation and quality. In this paper, a method of passivation of hybrid GAMAnPbnI3n+1 (n = 5) perovskites by additive engineering was reported. Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) were prepared by adding polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and povidone–iodine (PVP-I), and the synergistic passivation effect of PVP and I was investigated. The optimal PVP-I concentration reduces the trap density, and enhances the charge mobility and transport because of the improved crystallinity and energy cascade, which eventually generates a PCE of 15.73%. Additionally, the optimized devices without encapsulation retain 80% of their initial efficiency for more than 700 h after storage under ambient conditions.
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using 3D organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite light absorbers have made great progress in the past decade, with the most advanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25%.1 However, the environmental instability of 3D perovskite materials is still a key obstacle to the practical application of PSCs.2,3 Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites prepared by inserting larger organic cations into 3D structures show excellent long-term stability, which is due to the van der Waals interaction between their hydrophobic bulk organic cations and the capping organic molecules. The lower layer number (n value) of inorganic layers sandwiched between two adjacent organic spacers can make PSCs have better stability. The general formulas of RP and DJ phases in the 2D perovskites are L2An−1BnX3n+14,5 and LAn−1BnX3n+1,6,7 respectively, where L represents monovalent or divalent organic spacer cations, A represents monovalent cations, B represents divalent metal ions, and X represents halogen ions. However, RP and DJ perovskites suffer from poor charge dissociation and transport in polycrystalline films, which significantly limit the PCE of PSCs.
Hybrid halide ACI perovskites are novel perovskite materials derived from the oxide perovskite family with marvelous structures and promising applications in solar cells.8 Generally, a 2D ACI perovskite can be described by the general formula of GAMAnPbnI3n+1.9 Compared to typical RP phase perovskites, ACI perovskites exhibit narrower optical band gaps,10,11 lower exciton binding energies, and longer carrier lifetimes due to the small volume of GA and MA.12,13 Despite these advantages, it remains a challenge to control the crystallization and film formation and defect passivation of ACI perovskites. Various effective post-processing methods have been reported to improve the quality of perovskite films, such as mixed crystallization,14 additive engineering11,13 and solvent ligand engineering.15,16 As additives, polymers are selected to be effective candidates for additive engineering, such as mono-polymer polystyrene (PS),17 polyethylenimine (PEI)18 and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA).19 It has been reported that the interaction between a polymer and the perovskite mesophase increases the perovskite grain size, thereby increasing the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), indicating that the polymer may be an effective candidate for additive engineering.
In this work, the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs with ACI quasi-2D perovskites were improved by the PVP-I additive contained in the perovskite precursor solution. By comparing the effects of PVP and PVP-I on perovskites, the synergistic passivation effect of PVP-I on perovskites is revealed. The dissolution of PVP and I in the precursor will lead to the interaction with the perovskite crystal to improve the performance. The synergistic effect of PVP-I is more pronounced compared to PVP alone. The optimal concentration of PVP-I relative to GAMA5Pb5I16 was determined and the effect of PVP-I and PVP on device efficiency was compared. It was found that PVP-I can significantly improve the photovoltaic performance. Morphological and optoelectronic studies were performed. ACI-type perovskites were fabricated in a n–i–p device structure with higher efficiency, while the p–i–n device structure is more stable during the preparation of the devices. Considering the large-scale application of perovskites, the improvement in the PCEs of inverted p–i–n devices was investigated. In addition, the stability before and after PVP-I treatment was compared, and it was observed that the stability of perovskite devices treated with PVP-I was significantly improved.
Experimental section
Materials
PbI2 (99.99%), guanidine hydroiodide (GAI), poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA, Mn:<6000) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) and methylammonium chloride (MACl) were purchased from Dyesol. Bathocuproine (BCP) was purchased from Lumtec. Isopropanol (IPA, 99.5%) was purchased from J&K. DMF (N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ≥99.9%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All reagents and solvents were used as received.
Solution preparation
To prepare the perovskite solutions, 1.3 M based PbI2 mixed with GAI, MAI and PbI2 at molar ratios of 1:5:5 was solubilized in the solvent mixture of DMF/DMSO (v/v = 8/1), MACl was added as an additive to the perovskite precursor solution at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 (10 mg was added to 1 mL precursor solution), and then stirred overnight in a N2-purged glovebox. The PTAA solution was prepared by dissolving 5 mg of PTAA in 1 mL of toluene. The PC61BM solution was prepared by dissolving 20 mg of PC61BM in 1 mL of toluene. The BCP solution was prepared by dissolving 0.5 mg of BCP in 1 mL of IPA.
Device fabrication
Commercially available ITO glass (15 Ω sq−1) was sequentially cleaned with deionized water, ethanol, and IPA for 15 min, respectively, and then dried under a N2 flow. PTAA was spin coated onto UV-Ozone treated ITO at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and annealed at 120 °C for 20 min in N2. The GAMAnPbnI3n+1 (n = 5) perovskite film was prepared by spin-coating at a low speed of 1000 rpm for 3 s and a high speed of 4000 rpm for 20 s, where 90 μL of IPA was dropped onto the substrate at 10 s before the end of the spin-coating. These films were then annealed at 150 °C for 20 min. Next, 40 μL of PC61BM solution was then spin-coated on the top of the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 30 s and BCP was dropped onto PC61BM at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s to form an electron extracting layer. Finally, a 100 nm silver counter electrode was thermally deposited onto a BCP layer under a pressure of 2 × 10−4 Pa by using a shadow mask.
Characterization
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a Nicolet 6700 at room temperature, and the powder samples for FTIR measurement were prepared by grinding PVP, PVP-I, PVP/PbI2 or the PVP-I/PbI2 mixture with KBr. The crystal structure of perovskite films was determined using a Shimadzu X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation source (λ = 0.1541 nm). The surface morphology of the thin films was analyzed using atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Multimode 8). The optical absorption spectra of perovskite films were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-3600 UV-vis spectrometer. The steady-state PL spectrum and PL decay curve were measured using an Edinburgh FLS980 fluorescence spectrometer. UPS and XPS measurements were performed using a Thermo Fischer, ESCALAB 250Xi, system. The J–V characteristics of solar cells were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Keithley 2400 type light source under 100 m W cm−2 (Newport 94023 A, AM 1.5G) calibrated using a standard silicon solar cell (certified by NREL) as the reference. For J–V measurements, the scan voltage was set from −0.1 V to 1.2 V with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Before the J–V test, a 0.0625 cm2 nonreflective mask was used to define the accurate active cell area. The Nyquist plot was obtained by conducting EIS analysis at a voltage of 1.0 V under dark conditions using a CHI660E electrochemical workstation. The IPCE spectra were recorded using a TLS-300XU system, calibrated using a Si reference solar cell.
Results and discussion
ACI two-dimensional perovskite GAMA5Pb5I16 thin films were fabricated by a one-step spin-coating method. Anti-solvent (IPA) was dripped during the spin-coating process. The concentration of PVP and PVP-I was 0.05 mg mL−1 (as shown in Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). The spin-coated film was then annealed at 100 °C for 20 min to form a perovskite film (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram of the preparation and postprocessing processes of GAMA5Pb5I16 films. 
To study the effects of different additives on the morphology of ACI perovskite GAMA5Pb5I16 films, the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of perovskite films with and without additive treatment were obtained. As shown in Fig. 2a, with the addition of PVP-I, the perovskite film surface becomes denser and smoother. The grain size of the pristine film is small and not uniform. After adding PVP, large grains appear, and small grains are distributed around large grains. After adding PVP-I, the grains become larger and are evenly distributed. The average grain size increased from 254 nm to 354 nm and 389 nm after treatment with PVP and PVP-I. Blurring of the grain boundaries indicates that the grains are tightly bound, indicating that the film homogeneity is improved. The film with PVP-I has the largest grain size, which is likely due to the change in the crystal growth dynamics under the action of PVP and I. The improvement of the film quality may be due to several different types of functional groups in PVP-I, which can not only make the grains more tightly bonded, but also passivate anionic defects (such as lead-I antisite defects and methylammonium (MA+) vacancies) and cationic defects (such as insufficiently coordinated lead).20 Atomic force microscopy analysis further shows that the surface became flat and more uniform after the addition of additives in Fig. 2b. The root mean square roughness of the irregularity height determined by the Rayleigh-Reiss theory decreases from ∼13.0 nm to ∼11.1 nm and ∼11.7 nm.

Fig. 3a shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of perovskite films before and after post-treatment with different additives. The two strong peaks of 14.26° and 28.54° correspond to the (110) and (220) crystal planes of GAMA5Pb5I16, respectively. After the treatment of PVP and PVP-I, the peak positions of the two peaks are basically unchanged, while the peak intensities are significantly improved, and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (110) plane decreased from 0.223 to 0.220 and 0.218. The results show that the addition of additives can improve the crystallinity of perovskite films. The average crystal size can be estimated by the Scherrer equation:21–23D ≈ Kλ/βcosθ, where D is the crystallite size, λ is the X-ray wavelength, β is the corrected half width of the diffraction peak, θ is the diffraction angle, and K is the shape coefficient characteristic of the particles. The estimated average crystal size is 590 nm, 593 nm, and 630 nm before and after the treatment of PVP and PVP-I. This indicates that the introduction of PVP-I makes the particles larger. This is consistent with the SEM characterization results.

Empty circles represent the measured data, and solid lines represent the fit data. 
The photoluminescence properties of GAMA5Pb5I16 perovskite films were further studied. Fig. 3b shows the photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films. All films are spin-coated on non-conductive glass substrates. After the addition of additives, the shift of the luminescence peak is negligible, while the peak intensity is enhanced, indicating that the nonradiative recombination of perovskite films is inhibited and the crystal is enhanced after additive treatment. The time-resolved luminescence (TRPL) spectra of the perovskite film are shown in Fig. 3c. The curves were fitted according to a biexponential rate law (1):24,25 I(t) = γ0 + A1e−t/τ1 + A2e−t/τ2(1)where γ0 is a constant, A1 and A2 are the relative amplitudes, and τ1 and τ2 represent the fast decay lifetime and slow decay lifetime for the trap-mediated surface non-radiative recombination and free carrier radiative recombination, respectively. The average carrier lifetime increases from the untreated 221.52 ns to 253.71 and 584.50 ns after PVP and PVP-I treatment, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). The PVP treatment has little effect on the carrier lifetime of perovskite films. For PVP-I treated films, the fast decay lifetime (τ1) increased from 6.23 ns to 7.45 ns, the slow decay lifetime (τ2) increased from 221.77 ns to 584. 60 ns, and the ratio of τ2 also increased from 95.99% to 98.39%, which means fewer defect density and more adequate time to transfer electrons in perovskite films treated with PVP-I. Combined with X-ray diffraction analysis, we conclude that low concentrations of PVP-I can increase the carrier lifetime due to increased crystallinity and effective defect passivation, which is beneficial to increase Voc and FF.26–28
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed to further study the change of the binding energy of perovskite core-level peaks in the presence and absence of additives. Compared to the pristine film, the O1s peak of the perovskite film treated with PVP and PVP-I changed from 529.58 eV to 529.72 and 529.78 eV (Fig. 3d), indicating that there is a bond interaction between oxygen in PVP and perovskite nanocrystals, which is consistent with FTIR results. In Fig. 3e and f, the Pb4f and I3d peaks of the perovskite films after the additive treatment are shifted to lower binding energy directions due to the effective passivation of the non-coordinated lead and iodine species. The N1s and C1s splitting components also show abnormal deviation (Fig. S6, ESI†), which supports the hypothesis that the PbI6 octahedron interacts with the PVP chain.29
In order to understand the effect of PVP-I on the electronic properties of perovskite films, electron-only devices (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/PC61BM/Ag) (Fig. 4a) were prepared to study the defect density and electron mobility. Fig. 4b–d show the dark J–V characteristics of devices based on perovskite films without and with PVP or PVP-I treatment. The trap density (Ntrap) is calculated by the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) using the formula Ntrap = (2ε0εrVTFL)/(qL2),30,31 where εr, ε0, q and L are the relative dielectric constant, the vacuum capacitance, the elemental charge and the perovskite film thickness, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4b–d, the electron Ntrap of the pristine films, and the films treated with PVP and PVP-I are 7.91 × 1016, 7.23 × 1016 and 4.74 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. The electron trap density of perovskite films after the addition of PVP-I is minimal, which means higher quality films. The electron mobility is further estimated by Mott–Gurney's law μe = (8JDL3)/(9ε0εrV2),32,33 where JD is the current density and V is the applied voltage.34 The electron mobility (μe) increased from 0.03879 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 0.04289 and 0.04927 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. It can be seen that the PVP-I treated films have the lowest trap density and the highest carrier mobility, which are beneficial for increasing the charge quantity and charge transfer, such that the short-circuit current density (Jsc) enlarges.

(e) FTIR spectra of pure PVP, pure PVP-I, the PVP mixed with PbI2 and the PVP-I mixed with PbI2. (f) Energy diagram of the GAMA5Pb5I16 perovskite alongside utilized charge transporting layers with the values for perovskite extracted from UPS and optical absorption measurements. 
As shown in the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra in Fig. 4e, the stretching vibrations of CO at 1691 and 1692 cm−1 shifted to 1624 cm−1 after the mixture of pure PVP and pure PVP-I with PbI2, indicating that the bonding strength of CO in PVP and PVP-I was weakened due to the interaction between PVP and PbI2 through Lewis acid–base adducts.35 This interaction may slow down the crystal growth process, resulting in increased crystal size and morphological changes.36
In Fig. 4f, the band diagram of the 2D PSC is shown based on the UPS data analysis. The valence band maximum (VBM) value was determined by analyzing the UV photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurement results (Fig. S4, ESI†), and the conduction band minimum (CBM) value was derived on the VBM value with the corresponding optical band gap. The optical band gap is calculated from the absorption spectrum in Fig. S4 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4f, the CB energy levels (Ec) of the perovskite films are −4.78 eV, −4.49 eV and −3.81 eV for the pristine film and those treated with PVP and PVP-I, respectively. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level (−4.2 eV) of PC61BM is higher than −4.78 eV and −4.49 eV of perovskite films treated without and with PVP, which is unfavorable to transfer electrons from the perovskite layer to PC61BM. Compared with the pristine and PVP-treated films, the perovskite layer with PVP-I has a more favorable energy level alignment with the LUMO level of PC61BM because of the higher Ec (−3.81 eV), which is expected to reduce the energy barrier of the PC61BM/perovskite interface, favoring charge extraction.37–39
The ACI perovskite film was prepared into a device as ITO/PTAA/perovskite/PC61BM/BCP/Ag (Fig. 6a). The parameters of the champion device are listed in Table 1. With the introduction of additives, the average PCEs (PCEave, obtained from 16 cells) increased from 11.93% to 13.18% and 14.01% (Fig. 5). The superior performance obtained with the addition of PVP and PVP-I is attributed to the improvement on short-circuit current density (Jsc) and FF compared to those of the pristine devices. After adding PVP, the Voc slightly improved from 0.97 V to 0.99 V and 1.01 V, and the FF increased from 71.72% to 73.59% and 75.96%, and the Jsc increased from 19.48 mA cm−2 to 19.59 mA cm−2 and 19.72 mA cm−2. The optimized ACI perovskite solar cell prepared using PVP-I additive provides a 15.73% champion PCE (PCEmax) (Fig. 6b). In addition, the hysteresis of the J–V curve of the PSC for different scan directions is significantly reduced after the PVP-I treatment, indicating that the trap density in the ACI perovskite is reduced and the carrier transport and extraction are improved.40

Fig. 6c shows the stable output power of the optimized and pristine devices, which is recorded for 200 seconds at a fixed maximum power point voltage under continuous AM1.5G, 1 sun illumination. Compared with the pristine device, the optimized device has higher stable output efficiency (14.93% vs. 12.24%) and stable Jsc (19.52 vs. 17.43 mA cm−2), as well as better lighting stability. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum shows that the optimized cell has higher intensity at ∼576–670 nm and ∼690–750 nm compared with the pristine cell, where the photocurrent comes from photons absorbed in low n QWs (n = 1–4) and high n QWs or 3D bulk phases, respectively. This result indicates that in the optimized cell, the charge generated from low-n and high-n QWs or 3D bodies is more efficiently extracted than the charge extraction layer in the pristine cell, resulting in an increase in the comprehensive Jsc from 19.22 mA cm−2 to 20.44 mA cm−2 and 20.82 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6d).
These findings are further verified by dark current measurements of the aligned 2D PSCs, as shown in Fig. 6e. Clearly, the addition of the PVP-I post-processing greatly suppresses the dark current and current leakage, which improved the FF. The passivation effect is investigated via Voc light intensity experiments (Fig. 6f).41 The slope of the device without and with PVP treatment was 0.82 and 1.38 kBT/q, respectively. After the addition of PVP-I, the slope was 1.08 kBT/q, which is closer to 1 kBT/q, indicating that the PVP-I addition is dominated by two-molecule recombination, with only a small amount of single-molecule recombination.42,43
Finally, the stability of PSCs was studied in a dark environment with a temperature of 20 ± 5 °C and a relative humidity (RH) of 20 ± 5%. Fig. 7 shows that the PSC with PVP maintains ∼79% of the initial PCE, the PSC with PVP-I maintains ∼81% of its initial PCE, and the PCE of the pristine device decreases rapidly, only ∼59% of the initial PCE. And under continuous illumination, the efficiency of the device with PVP-I is still 78% of the initial efficiency after 170 h (Fig. S7a, ESI†). At 40% ± 5% RH, the efficiency of the device with PVP-I is 95% of the initial efficiency (Fig. S7b, ESI†). It is reported that the stability of PSCs is strongly dependent on point defects, because the degradation of perovskites in air is caused by defects.44 Therefore, defect engineering can improve both the photovoltaic performance and stability. Additive engineering is an effective method to control the defects and improve the stability of perovskite films. In our work, PVP and PVP-I were used as additives, which led to an improvement in the carrier lifetime, as shown in the TRPL data in Fig. 3c. This extended lifetime is due to the defect passivation of the PVP. In addition, the detailed Pb XPS analysis in Fig. 3f confirms that I in PVP-I can passivate iodide vacancies. Therefore, passivation of defects with PVP-I is more helpful to improve the stability.45

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a defect-passivation and crystallization-control strategy based on PVP-I treatment. First, PVP improves the crystallinity of perovskite crystals and increases the crystal size. Second, PVP in the bulk phase of perovskite films significantly deactivates the trap state of the film. Moreover, the interaction of the carbonyl group in PVP with the disassortative Pb2+ effectively deactivates the cation defects and increases the grain size. Iodine can also passivate the iodine vacancies and improve the film quality. The obtained PCE of the champion device after PVP-I treatment was 15.73%. In addition, the stability of the PSCs is significantly improved. The PCE of the device with PVP-I maintained ∼80% of its initial value after 30 days in the air and ∼99% of its original efficiency under 200 s of AM 1.5G illumination. This PVP-I based processing provides a synergistic strategy to improve the performance and stability of ACI inverted PSCs.
