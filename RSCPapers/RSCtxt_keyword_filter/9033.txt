A systematic investigation of the relationship between the structures and physical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties has been conducted. The devices sensitized by TJ101 which employed m-carboxyl-N-methylpyridinium as the acceptor group has achieved a conversion efficiency of 5.4% (Jsc = 10.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 680 mV, FF = 74.2%) under AM 1.5 irradiation. In contrast, much lower efficiency of 4.0% was obtained when a reference dye TJ101R with m-carboxylpyridine as the acceptor group was employed as a sensitizer.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention due to their low cost and high power conversion since Grätzel and coworkers first reported them with an impressive efficiency of 7.9%.1 So far, a record power conversion efficiency of 13% has been achieved.2 As a key component, a variety of efficient sensitizers have been designed to get higher power conversion efficiency for DSSCs, such as ruthenium polypyridyl complexes,3–5 porphyrin sensitizers6–13 and metal-free organic dyes.14–22 Concerning the cost and limited ruthenium resource and the low yield of porphyrin sensitizers, metal-free organic dyes have received much attention due to high molar extinction coefficient, ease of tunable molecular structure and low cost. In these dyes, cyano acrylic acid are usually served as acceptor and anchoring group.14,19–22 However, compared with electron donor groups, there are few reports on the investigation of electron acceptor groups. Recently, pyridine derivatives as acceptor groups have been successfully applied in DSSCs for the strong electron withdrawing ability and excellent charge injection ability.23–26 Hydroxylpyridium served as electron acceptor and anchoring group in DSSCs was reported by our group.23 It is reasonable to replace the hydroxyl group with the carboxyl group to strengthen the withdrawing ability of acceptor group and anchoring group for higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiency.
In this paper, two pyridinium dyes (TJ101 and TJ102) with alkoxyl triphenylamide as donor group, vinylthiophenyl as π-bridge group and pyridinium (m-carboxyl-N-methylpyridine and N-methylcarboxylpyridine) as acceptor group have been synthesized to study the effect of the pyridinium unit and the position of carboxyl on the performance of DSSCs. The structures of the sensitizers (TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R) are shown in Fig. 1 and the specific synthetic steps are displayed in the ESI†.

Results and discussion
Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The UV-Visible absorption spectra of TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R in a diluted solution of CH2Cl2 and on TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 2. The corresponding data are collected in Table 1. All the dyes have two absorption maxima: the absorption band at 300–350 nm is ascribed to S0 → S2 transition and the band at around 430–470 nm can be assigned to S0 → S1 transition. The maximal absorption for TJ101R, TJ101 and TJ102 are located at 424 nm (ε = 34600 mol−1 cm−1), 459 nm (ε = 31000 mol−1 cm−1), 455 nm (ε = 25900 mol−1 cm−1), respectively. In contrast to TJ101R, the maximal absorption peak of TJ101 and TJ102 are red-shifted 35 nm and 31 nm, respectively, indicating that the introduction of pyridinium can increase the electron withdrawing ability of the electron acceptor. In addition, compared to TJ102, TJ101 exhibits a little red-shifted maximal absorption peak and high molar extinction coefficient, which is probably due to a better withdrawing synergistic effect of carboxyl group with pyridinium ring for TJ101 than that for TJ102.

The absorption spectra of the TJ series of dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 2b. Obviously, the absorption peak wavelengths on the TiO2 film are blue-shifted 10 nm, 11 nm and 23 nm for TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R, respectively, with respect to these dyes in CH2Cl2 diluted solution. Such phenomenon is attributed to the aggregation of these dyes on TiO2 surface and deprotonation of carboxylic acid upon adsorption onto the TiO2 surface. Therefore, the addition of CDCA as coadsorbent in dye bath is essential for DSSCs to restrain dye aggregation.
The electrochemical properties of TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R in CH2Cl2 have been studied by cyclic voltammetry and the corresponding data are present in Table 1. The HOMO levels of TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R are more positive than the redox potential of I−/I3− (0.42 vs. NHE)28 with 0.61 V, 0.62 V, 0.67 V versus NHE, respectively, demonstrating that the oxidized dyes can be regenerated by the electrolyte effectively. The values of LUMO levels, ranging from −1.62 V to −1.87 V versus NHE, are more negative than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE).28 Therefore the electron can be injected into the CB of TiO2 effectively. Noticeably, the introduction of pyridinium has a beneficial influence on the values of LUMO. The LUMO levels of TJ101 and TJ102 have a positive shift in comparison to the LUMO levels of TJ101R, which is mainly caused by the enhanced withdrawing ability of electron acceptor. Thus the band energy gap (E0–0) was decreased for TJ101 (2.23 eV) and TJ102 (2.30 eV). Additionally, the LUMO values of TJ101, with different positions of carboxyl as anchoring group, is more negative than that of TJ102, which can be attributed to a better withdrawing synergistic effect of the carboxyl group with pyridinium ring for TJ101 than that for TJ102.
Calculation study
To further investigate the electronic properties of TJ series of dyes, density functional theory calculations are employed to analyze these dyes at B3LYP/6-31G*level. The electron distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R are shown in Table 3. From the calculation result, it is easy to find that for TJ101R, the electron density distribution of HOMO and LUMO overlaps on the π-bridge part. However, for TJ101 and TJ102, the electron density distribution of HOMO is originally located at the donor moiety (TPA), while the electron density of LUMO is located at the acceptor unit. Hence, different from TJ101R, TJ101 and TJ102 can get obvious electron separation. This is mainly due to the stronger electron withdrawing ability of pyridinium with respect to TJ101R.

Photovoltaic and photoelectrochemical properties
The photocurrent density–photovoltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs based on dyes TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R are tested under standard AM 1.5G illumination. As is present in Fig. 3, in the absent of the CDCA, photon-to-electron conversion efficiency, ranging from 3.2% to 3.9%, have been achieved for the devices based on TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R. Coadsorbent of CDCA is often employed to suppress the dye aggregation by coadsorption with sensitizer on TiO2 surface, thus improving the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, CDCA is added into the dye bath and expected to achieve a more excellent photovoltaic performance (Table 2).
 Fig. 3  (a) J–V curves of DSSCs based on TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R without CDCA as coadsorbent; and (b) J–V curves of DSSCs based on TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R with CDCA as coadsorbent. 
With the addition of CDCA, all the dyes (TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R) have a great improvement on Jsc values and the conversion efficiency. Compared with TJ101R, with the introduction of pyridinium, a higher short-current density (Jsc) is obtained for TJ101 and TJ102, respectively. The explanation for the higher short-current density of pyridinium dyes can be mainly attributed to the broader absorption spectra compared to that for TJ101R. Specifically, for TJ101, open circuit voltage (Voc) increased from 646 mV to 680 mV, Jsc is improved by 1.9 mA cm−2 and correspondingly η is improved to 5.4%. What's more, the device sensitized by TJ102 under the same condition shows relatively low Jsc and η compared to the device based on TJ101. Considering that the main difference between TJ101 and TJ102 is the position of carboxyl in the acceptor, when carboxyl group is on the pyridine ring, a better conjugated effect could be achieved for TJ101 than that for TJ102, which is beneficial for excited electron injection.
The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the dyes are displayed in Fig. 4. From the test results, it is easy to find that the DSSCs using TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R without CDCA as coadsorbent show lower IPCE values when compared to the DSSCs employed TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R with CDCA as coadsorbent in the same region, manifesting that the addition of CDCA facilitate the electron injection and charge collection.

With the addition of CDCA, it can be noted that the IPCE spectrum response based on TJ101R is ended at 590 nm and the highest IPCE value is close to 90% in the range of 400–500 nm. In contrast, although the IPCE maximum value of TJ101 and TJ102 are lower than TJ101R, they exhibit broader IPCE spectra response in 350 to 600 nm, which keeps accord with the absorption spectra on TiO2 film (Fig. 1). Moreover, the IPCE spectrum for the device based on TJ101 is slightly higher than that of TJ102 in the same region, showing a higher electron injection efficiency and electron collection efficiency of the m-carboxyl-N-methylpyridinium group.
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was introduced to study interface charge transfer processes in DSSCs based on TJ101 and TJ102. The impedance spectroscopy was carried out by subjecting the cell to the dark conditions at room temperature and to the bias at −0.8 V which was scanned from 106 to 10−2 Hz. The alternate current (AC) amplitude was set at 10 mV. The Nyquist plots are displayed in Fig. 5. The larger semicircles in lower frequency range (100 Hz to 1 kHz) reflect the recombination resistance (Rrec) on the surface of TiO2–electrolyte–dye interface, while the smaller semicircle in higher frequency range corresponds to charge transfer resistance (Rce) on the surface of Pt–electrolyte interface.
 Fig. 5  (a) Nyquist plots of DSSCs based on dye TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R without CDCA as coadsorbent; and (b) Nyquist plots of DSSCs based on dye TJ101, TJ102 and TJ101R with CDCA as coadsorbent. 
Any difference can be showed by the two cells based on TJ101 and TJ102 in the larger semicircle (Rrec) and smaller semicircle (Rce). Noticeably, The Rrec for devices based on TJ101R is 86 ohm, which is much larger than that of TJ101 and TJ102, indicating that the recombination on the TiO2–electrolyte–dye interface can be suppressed effectively for dye TJ101R. This phenomenon is reflected on the trend of the Voc. The Voc of devices based on TJ101R (795 mV) is much higher than devices based on TJ101 (646 mV) and TJ102 (611 mV) in the absent of CDCA. So the introduction of pyridinium as the acceptor group has a negative effect on the improvement of Voc.
With the addition of CDCA, there is an increase of the Rrec for TJ101 and TJ102, respectively. It can be seen from the Nyquist plots (Fig. 5b) that the diameters of the larger semicircles in lower frequency is 27.4, 25.1 ohm for TJ101 and TJ102, respectively, which result in the improvement of Voc of TJ101 (680 mV) and TJ102 (644 mV). However, the addition of CDCA leads to a decrease of TJ101R in the larger semicircle. These results showing that the CDCA can be applied into the pyridinium dyes for improving the Voc. At the same time, for TJ101 and TJ102, the electron recombination can be blocked more effectively for TJ101 than TJ102, as a result of the different positions of carboxyl in the pyridine ring. These results suggest that different acceptor groups indeed have large effect on the electron recombination between the TiO2 film and the electrolyte.
Conclusions
In summary, two metal-free organic dyes with pyridinium (m-carboxyl-N-methylpyridinium, N-methylcarboxylpyridininium) as the acceptor and anchoring group have been synthesized. The physical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the dyes TJ101 and TJ102 are systematically investigated. It can be found that the introduction of pyridinium as acceptor lead to a red-shifted absorption spectrum and the introduction of pyridinium to synthesize the dyes have favourable effects on improving the overall cell performance, but adverse effects on Voc. With the different positions of the carboxyl in the pyridine ring, a maximal photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of 5.4% (Jsc = 10.8 mA cm−2, Voc = 680 mV, FF = 74.2%) under AM 1.5 irradiation is obtained for the device based on TJ101, while for the devices sensitized by dye TJ102 achieves the conversion efficiency of 4.2%. Based on these analyses, it can be concluded that the m-carboxyl-N-methylpyridine with withdrawing synergistic effect of the carboxyl group and pyridinium ring shows excellent DSSCs performance. Moreover, a great improvement of the overall cell performance based on TJ101 and TJ102 is improved by the addition of CDCA. This result will lay a foundation for the further pyridinium molecular design in DSSCs.
