Introduction
With the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution, the development and utilization of new energy has become one of the most urgent tasks for mankind. Among these, new energy based on solar energy has great potential for development, its rich resources, convenient acquisition, and clean and pollution-free properties fully meet the requirements for sustainable development of human society.1–5 At present, the utilization of solar energy is mainly for light, thermal energy and photovoltaic power generation, photovoltaic power is one of the important ways to make use of solar energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have the advantages of low cost, adjustable color, convenient assembly and high conversion efficiency.6–8 For DSSCs, sensitizers play an important role in capturing photons and producing electrons, and so the research and development of high-efficiency sensitizers has been the focus of attention for researchers.9–11 High efficiency dyes for DSSC devices can be classified into three main categories: ruthenium-complexes, zinc-porphyrins and metal-free organic dyes.12–16 In 2015, Kakiage and co-workers prepared a silyl-anchored organic dye ADEKA-1, the PCE of the device was up to 14.3% with a cobalt-based redox electrolyte, this is the highest PCE of DSSCs up to now.17
Through the continuous efforts of researchers, significant progress has been made in the design of dye sensitizers, and the basic structure of D–π–A (donor–π–acceptor) is established.18–23 This structure has excellent charge transfer properties and is very convenient to modify, therefore, the establishment of this configuration has greatly promoted the development of DSSCs. Currently, the donors with better properties are aromatic amines, indoline, carbazole, phenothiazine, coumarin, fluorene and so on.24–27 The π-bridge can not only extend the conjugation degree of the molecule, but also ensure the smooth transfer of charge from donor to acceptor, therefore, it must have a good conjugated structure and planarity, examples include alkenes, alkynes, benzene rings, fused rings, thiophene, furan, pyrrole and other heterocycles,28–30 and the electron acceptors usually contain carboxyls, cyanoacrylic acid, phosphoric acid, tannin, pyridine and other groups.31–34 With the deepening of research, some new structures such as D–A–π–A, D–π–(A)n and D–D–π–A, D–π–A–π–A, (D–π–A)n have been successfully developed, this provides a good direction for the design of efficient dyes.35–38 The introduction of new narrow band gap groups, such as benzothiazole, pyrroledione and other analogues, greatly improves the spectral response of dyes and improves the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of DSSCs. The wide use of a large conjugated π-bridge with a branched chain also effectively increases the conjugation of the molecules and increases the capacity of charge separation and migration, and the performance of the device will be improved greatly.39,40 The anchor group also plays a very important role, this determines the efficiency of charge injection and the degree of bonding between the sensitizer and semiconductor surface.41–43 Carboxylic acid is the most commonly used anchor in the design of dye molecules, because it has a good charge injection efficiency and has good electronic coupling between the dye and semiconductor. Even so, some new anchoring groups, such as pyridine, phosphoric acid, hydroxamic acid and catechol, have also been developed, therefore, it is necessary to analyze the effect of different anchoring groups on the properties of dyes.44–46
In this work, phenothiazine was used as the electron donor. Phenothiazine has excellent electron donor properties, its electron donating ability is better than that of triphenylamine, carbazole and other common groups, it also has excellent hole transport properties, a large π-conjugation system and rigid structure properties.47–49 In addition, spirobifluorene and long carbon chains units were introduced onto the donors of phenothiazine dyes to construct stereoscopic structures, this strategy can effectively suppress charge recombination, and the strongly electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit (BTD) was also introduced to improve the spectral responsiveness of these dyes. What's more, carboxylic acid, cyanoacrylic acid and pyridine were used as anchors for these dyes, and we investigated the optical properties, electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performance of these dyes to analyze the influence of different anchors on them. Under the same conditions, the DSSC based on JA6 with a cyanoacrylic acid anchor exhibited the highest PCE of 7.34%, which was higher than that of JA0 (6.69%, carboxylic acid anchor) and JA7 (3.05%, pyridine anchor).
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The structures of JA0, JA6 and JA7 are shown in Fig. 1, JA0 was prepared in accordance with the literature,50 and the synthesis of JA6 and JA7 is provided in the ESI.† The synthetic routes are depicted in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The synthesis details and characterization data are shown in the ESI.†

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of JA0, JA6 and JA7 in DCM at a concentration of 1 × 10−5 M are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding data are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). For the three dyes, the high energy absorption should be due to π–π* transitions, and the low energy absorption after 400 nm can be attributed to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor. The ICT absorption maximum for JA0 is at 452 nm, with a molar extinction coefficient of 1.08 × 104 M−1 cm−1, while the absorption of JA6 has a marked red shift, the ICT absorption maximum for JA6 is at 508 nm, which is red-shifted by 52 nm compared with that of JA0, and the molar extinction coefficient reached 1.02 × 104 M−1 cm−1. In addition, the spectral response of JA6 reached about 700 nm, which is longer than that of JA0 and JA7, this should be ascribed to the higher tendency of the thiophene and the greater electron-accepting ability of cyanoacrylic acid, this will help to improve its light-harvesting ability. The maximum absorption of JA7 also has a slight red shift compared to that of JA0, but the molar extinction coefficient was only 0.67 × 104 M−1 cm−1. The absorption spectra of the three dyes adsorbed onto transparent TiO2 surfaces are shown in Fig. 2b, it is clear that the absorptions of the three dyes are significantly higher and broader than those of the dyes in solution, especially for JA6, the spectral response reached about 770 nm, this will greatly improve their light-harvesting capability, the improvement can be seen by comparing the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs.

FTIR spectra analysis
The anchor group also plays a very important role in DSSCs, this determines the efficiency of charge injection and the degree of bonding between the sensitizer and semiconductor surface. We recorded the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the dye powders and the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films to investigate their binding mode (Fig. S1, ESI†). From Fig. S1a (ESI†), we can see that the vibration frequency of ν(CO) for JA0 powder is located at 1685 cm−1, and this band is not observed in the spectrum of the sensitized film, this means that JA0 was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface in a bidentate mode.51 This is the same for JA6, the vibration frequency of ν(CO) for JA6 powder was located at 1696 cm−1, and the band disappeared after anchored on the TiO2 surface, so JA6 was adsorbed on the TiO2 surface in a bidentate mode. The stretching vibrations of CC and CN were observed at 1596 cm−1, 1561 cm−1, 1473 cm−1 and 1450 cm−1 for dye JA7 powder, after adsorption of the dye onto TiO2, a new absorption band appeared at 1614 cm−1, which can be assigned to the pyridyl group coordinated to a Lewis acid site of the TiO2 surface.52,53
Electrochemical studies
To observe the ability of electron injection and dye regeneration, the ground state oxidation potential (EOX) of the dye is compared with the electrochemical potential of the electrolyte (0.4 V vs. NHE) and the excited state potential (EOX*) of the dye is compared with the conduction band edge (−0.5 V vs. NHE) of TiO2.54,55 Cyclic voltammograms of JA0, JA6 and JA7 were recorded (Fig. S2, ESI†), and EOX can be estimated. From Fig. 3, we can see that the EOX values of JA0, JA6 and JA7 are 0.98 V, 0.95 V and 1.04 V (versus NHE), respectively, it is clear that the values are all more positive than that of the redox I−/I3− couple (0.4 V versus NHE), this indicates that these oxidized dyes can be effectively regenerated. The optical band gap or ground state energy (E0–0) can be estimated from the absorption of these dyes, and the values for JA0, JA6 and JA7 were 2.10 eV, 1.82 eV and 2.06 eV, respectively. Therefore, the EOX* values of the dyes can be calculated by the formula EOX* = EOX − E0–0, and the EOX* values of JA0, JA6 and JA7 were −1.12 V, −0.87 V and −1.02 V, respectively. Obviously, their EOX* values are all more negative than the conduction band edge (−0.5 V vs. NHE) of TiO2, the results show that these excited dyes can efficiently inject electrons into the conduction band of TiO2.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
In order to study the influence of different anchors on the performance of DSSCs, the devices were fabricated under the same conditions. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of DSSCs with the three dyes and a liquid electrolyte containing 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII), 30 mM I2, 50 mM LiI, 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M guanidiniumthiocyanate (GuNCS) in a solvent mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio 85:15) under AM 1.5 full sunlight (100 mW cm−2) illumination are shown in Fig. 4, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table S2 (ESI†). The DSSC based on JA0 had a Voc of 840 mV, a Jsc of 12.32 mA cm−2, and a FF of 64.63%, corresponding to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.69%. What is surprising is that the Voc is so high, this result shows that our stereoscopic strategy has played a very good role in suppressing charge recombination, therefore, the Voc of the device has been greatly improved. After the anchoring group was replaced with cyanoacrylic acid, the DSSC based on JA6 showed a PCE of 7.34%, with a Voc of 800 mV, a Jsc of 13.93 mA cm−2, and a FF of 65.83%, the Voc is reduced by 40 mV, but the Jsc increased by 1.61 mA cm−2, the higher tendency of the thiophene unit and the greater electron-accepting ability of cyanoacrylic acid effectively improved its light-harvesting ability. In contrast, dye JA7 with a pyridine anchor showed a low performance, the PCE was only 3.05%, with a Voc of 615 mV, a Jsc of 7.32 mA cm−2, and a FF of 67.94%, we speculate that this should be attributed to its poor dye adsorption properties. To verify this speculation, the amount of dye adsorption of the three dyes anchored on TiO2 surfaces was further measured, the values for JA0, JA6 and JA7 were 6.95 × 10−7 mol cm−2, 5.73 × 10−7 mol cm−2, and 2.49 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. Obviously, the lower dye adsorption amount will reduce the Voc and Jsc of the device, this is the main reason for the low PCE of JA7. The IPCE spectra of the DSSCs were recorded to further analyze the differences between their Jsc values, as shown in Fig. 4b, it is clear that the IPCE of JA6 is higher and broader than that of JA0 and JA7, which almost has the highest value in the entire visible light area. The maximum IPCE value of JA6 reached about 71% at 510 nm, and exhibited photocurrent generation up to about 770 nm, while JA0 exhibited photocurrent generation up to about 660 nm, this also explains why JA6 has the highest Jsc. Obviously, the IPCE spectrum of JA7 appears narrow and low, the maximum IPCE value of JA7 was only 51% at 450 nm, and it exhibited photocurrent generation up to about 650 nm, so the DSSC based on JA7 has the lowest Jsc, the lower amount of dye adsorption is another major reason.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
The Voc of DSSCs will be greatly affected by charge recombination dynamics, therefore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed in the dark to study the effects.56–58 In this work, the Nyquist plots of the DSSCs were obtained under the open-circuit condition at a bias of −0.7 V in the dark and scanned from 105 to 1 Hz (Fig. 5). Two semicircles can be observed in Fig. 5a, the small semicircle is related to electron transport resistance at the Pt/electrolyte interface, and the large semicircle is related to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. Obviously, the radii of the large semicircles of these DSSCs decreased in the order: JA0 > JA6 > JA7, a larger electron recombination resistance means a smaller dark current, and less charge recombination, this is the same trend as their Voc values. The electron recombination lifetime (τ) can be estimated from Bode phase plots via τ = 1/(2πf), where f is the frequency at the lower frequency region. From Fig. 5b, the τ values of DSSCs based on JA0, JA6 and JA7 are 41.9 ms, 22.7 ms and 3.7 ms, respectively. The much shorter electron lifetime for JA7 compared to the other dyes can be attributed to insufficient coverage of the TiO2 surface because of low dye loading. JA0 has the longest electron lifetime, indicating that the dark current is also lowest, and so the Voc of JA0 is up to 840 mV.

Conclusions
In summary, three D–A–π–A stereoscopic phenothiazine dyes JA0, JA6 and JA7 were prepared and applied in dye-sensitized solar cells. Phenothiazine was used as the electron donor mainly due to its excellent electron donating ability, large π-conjugation system and rigid structure properties. In addition, spirobifluorene and long carbon chain units were introduced onto the donors to construct stereoscopic structures, this strategy can effectively suppress charge recombination by decreasing back reaction of the injected electrons with triiodide species in the electrolyte. The Voc of the DSSCs based on JA0 and JA6 were both over 800 mV. The strongly electron-withdrawing benzothiadiazole unit (BTD) was also introduced to improve the spectral responsiveness of these dyes, and the IPCE of JA6 exhibited photocurrent generation up to about 770 nm. What's more, carboxylic acid, cyanoacrylic acid and pyridine were used as anchors for these dyes, and we investigated the optical properties, electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performance of these dyes to analyze the influence of different anchors on dyes. The results show that cyanoacrylic acid is the best anchor for this series of dyes, which is very helpful to improve the light-harvesting ability of dyes. The DSSC based on JA6 with a cyanoacrylic acid anchor exhibited the highest PCE of 7.34%, which was higher than that of JA0 (6.69%, carboxylic acid anchor) and JA7 (3.05%, pyridine anchor).
