Introduction
In recent years, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices—ranging from solar cells to photodetectors—have been attracting more and more attention. Their unique potential in the field of light-weight and low-cost large area fabrication is the major driving force for this compelling trend.1 In general, materials with potential for OPV are investigated through device performance and material characterization. Recently, the focus shifted to the integration of carbon nanotubes (CNT),2 which have emerged as an outstanding class of carbon materials, into OPV. Particularly noteworthy are the remarkable physical3 and chemical4 features of CNT in general. These properties include high conductivity, which is, in fact, comparable to those of copper and/or silicon and exceeds those of any conducting polymer by several orders of magnitude,5 strong mechanical,6 thermal7 and environmental resistance.8
Notably, the conductivity of single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) varies between semiconducting and metallic and depends, in large, on the chiral angle of the tubes and their diameter. They readily accept electrons, which can then be transported under nearly ideal conditions along the axis. On the other hand, multiple concentric graphene cylinders—multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)—exhibit metallic or semiconducting properties,9 which depend solely on their outermost shell.10
In this Highlight article we will focus mainly on the most important strategies for implementing CNT in OPV cells, which are shown in Fig. 1. These are the implementation of CNT as an integrative part of the photoactive layer, and, alternatively, the use of CNT for the construction of semitransparent and flexible hole collecting electrodes. As a leading example, devices have been fabricated and tested that are based on combining an electron donating conjugated polymer (i.e., regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT) with an electron accepting fullerene (i.e., (6,6)-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PCBM). Last, but not least, we will sketch attempts to interlayer a P3HT:PCBM based solar cell on the hole collection side of the photoactive layer with CNT.
 Fig. 1  Prototypes of CNT based solar cells: (a) dispersing SWCNT into the photoactive layer of a OPV device that has the glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT:P3HT/Al configuration and (b) CNT as semitransparent electrode in a glass/SWCNT/PEDOT:PSS/PCBM:P3HT/Al configuration. 
Dispersing CNT into the photoactive layer
The overriding motivation to pursue this strategy is to combine the physicochemical properties of conjugated polymers with the long range charge transport characteristics of CNT (i.e., ballistic transport along the CNT axis) in order to obtain efficiently performing OPV devices. In fact, initial reports revealed appreciable success in integrating CNT as electron accepting material into ITO based photovoltaic devices. Most profitable were assembly strategies that followed the protocols of layer-by-layer (LBL) deposition,11electrophoresis,12 or spin coating.13
The LBL approach, namely, deposition of monolayer based stacks, is universal and has been extended from SWCNT to double wall carbon nanotubes (DWCNT), MWCNT and thin multi-wall carbon nanotubes (thin-MWCNT), for example, together with water-soluble porphyrins and polythiophene derivatives. Among all of the CNT that were tested, thin-MWCNT revealed by far the best photovoltaic performance: for this electron acceptor layer material a maximal incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of 1.9% was established.14
Exposing SWCNT that were suspended with the assistance of tetraoctylammonium bromide in tetrahydrofuran to an electrophoretic field emerged as a valuable approach to deposit them and also stacked-cup carbon nanotubes (SCCNT) onto substrates.12,15 In fact, considerable photoconversion efficiencies were achieved when SWCNT were deposited together with light harvesting CdS quantum dots and porphyrins with maximal values of 1.5% and 13%, respectively.16
Still, the most common strategy to implement CNT materials into organic solar cell is based on i) the dispersion of CNT in a solution of an electron donating conjugated polymer—typically P3HT or poly(3-octylthiophene), (P3OT)—and ii) spin coating these blends onto a transparent conductive electrode with thicknesses that range from 60 to 120 nm. Such electrodes are typically glass covered with indium tin oxide (ITO) and a 40 nm sublayer of (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). PEDOT:PSS favors selective hole injection into ITO electrode, helps in smoothing the ITO surface, reduces the density of pinholes and suppresses current leakage effects that arise around shunting paths. Finally, a cathode consisting of a 20–70 nm thick layer of aluminium—sometimes with an intermediate layer of lithium fluoride—is thermally evaporated and/or sputtered on top of the photoactive material. Correspondingly, both MWCNT13a,b,17 and SWCNT18 have been integrated into the photoactive material.
The generation of electrical power from, for example, sun rays involves a chain of events—see for illustration Fig. 2. Initially, sunlight photons are absorbed somewhere within the photoactive layer, which might be either the electron donating or electron accepting material. This leads to the generation of locally confined excitons, which subsequently start to migrate. When these excitons reach an interface, that is, where separate phases of electron donor and acceptor materials interact tightly, before their deactivation, they might dissociate. In turn, free charge carriers such as electrons and holes are formed. If in fact these free charge carriers persist and do not recombine on their path through the film to the electrodes, they might be collected there and, subsequently, taken to an external circuit.
 Fig. 2  Schematic photovoltaic processes in CNT/polymer composites: (a) photoabsorption, (b) exciton migration, (c) exciton dissociation, and (d) charge transport. 
From this mechanistic consideration we must deduce that one of the most critical factors—in determining the overall efficiency of photocurrent generation—is the control over a uniform blending of the electron accepting CNT and the electron donating conjugated polymer. Implicit is that this must equally apply to the exciton diffusion with approximately a length scale of 10 nm and to the charge transfer, which is given by the distances between the interfaces and the electrodes. Here is where CNT bear great potential: besides just possessing electron accepting features, their high aspect ratio seems to be perfectly suited to support migration of charges along their tubular axis.
Post-fabrication treatment such as heating to the point beyond the glass transition temperature of either P3HT or P3OT is beneficial for manipulating the phase separation of the blend. Since the polymers are microcrystalline systems it also affects the ordering of the polymeric chains. Overall, this annealing improves charge transfer, charge transport, and charge collection throughout the device.19 As a consequence of such ordering, the hole mobility, and hence the power efficiency of the polymer nanotube device, increases significantly.20
So far, following this strategy a maximum power conversion efficiency (η) of 0.22% has been obtained.21 Although the polymer CNT cells give rise to an exceptionally high open circuit voltage (Voc) between 0.75 and 1 V as well as an advantageous near-infrared light harvesting,22 their photocurrents are quite low. Please compare, for example, 0.25 to 0.5 mA cm–2 to 10.6 mA cm–2 measured for an optimized ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al OPV device.23
Several factors are thought to contribute to the limited efficiency. Firstly, the presence of charge recombination pathways must be taken into account, since CNT are—in contrast to PCBM—only randomly dispersed within the P3HT matrix. Secondly, an incomplete exciton dissociation, especially at low nanotube concentration, about 1.0 wt% for SWCNT24 and 5 wt% for MWCNT,25 is another factor. Dissolving, on the other hand, higher percentages of CNT within the polymer matrix decreases the efficiency. The latter is rationalized on the basis of short circuits, since the CNT length is comparable to the overall thickness of the photoactive layer. Finally, the presence of CNT ropes/bundles and, moreover, appreciable amounts of metallic entities should be considered. All these rationales decrease the carrier selectivity (i.e. holes and electrons) in the device and favor the recombination processes.
In a recent publication an impressive power conversion of 4.9% was obtained in a modified ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al solar cell, after depositing a SWCNT layer between the ITO and the PEDOT:PSS or between the PEDOT:PSS and the photoactive blend. Here, SWCNT were deposited by dip-coating from a hydrophilic suspension after an initial argon plasma treatment of the surface.26
CNT as transparent electrode
OPV cells necessitate the implementation of transparent anodes. Currently, the material of choice is ITO. While extensively developed and optimized, ITO bears, nevertheless, a number of deficiencies. One disadvantage results from its high deposition temperature of around 600 °C, which renders a compatibility with, for example, flexible substrates more than just problematic. What is even more puzzling is that traditional ITO has poor mechanical properties and is brittle. Of economic and social concern are, on the other hand, the facts that high quality ITO is expensive and that indium is toxic. Consequently, developing and commercializing a substitute for ITO is at the forefront of OPV research.
A wide range of methods have been probed to fabricate CNT thin films—like spraying,27spin coating,13a casting,28LBL6 and Langmuir–Blodgett deposition.29 The most appropriate procedure to obtain flexible and optically transparent films involves, nevertheless, the transfer from a filter membrane to the transparent support by utilizing a solvent30 or in the form of an adhesive film.31 Such a procedure guarantees better dispersions, when compared to the aforementioned techniques, and the prospect to remove the solubilization agents by a simple washing/rinsing step.
Recent work, which has demonstrated that films made of arc-discharge CNT exhibit higher conductivity and transparency than films based on HiPCO CNT, evolved as an important milestone.32 In addition to this pioneering work, the following aspects point to CNT as optimal material for transparent flexible OPV anodes. In particular, theoretical and experimental studies have established that the work function of SWCNT networks is in the 4.8 to 4.9 eV range. ITO, for instance, possesses a work function of 4.7 eV. In other words, the SWCNT work function should be sufficiently high to ensure efficient hole collection—see Fig. 2.33 Important is also the electrical sheet resistance of SWCNT films, which is at 100 Ohm sq–1 an order of magnitude higher than that found typically for the sheet resistance of ITO (i.e., 10 Ohm sq–1). Its high optical transparency in a very broad spectral range that starts in the UV-Vis and extends deep into the near IR range (3–5 µm) is another benefit. Notable, many transparent conducting coatings are transparent in the visible part of the spectrum, but only a few materials retain good transparency in the infrared while maintaining good electrical conductivity.30aSWCNT films are, in contrast to brittle ITO, highly flexible and do not creep. In fact, SWCNT films on polyethyleneterephthalate do not crack after bending, while ITO films become insulating.34 Finally, the high thermal conductivities35 to tolerate heat dissipation and the high radiation resistance—even when irradiated in air—are particularly striking.
Early results confirm the proof of principle by attesting that OPV devices with SWCNT thin films as transparent and conducting electrodes for hole collection are, in fact, competitive—with device efficiencies between 1 and 2.5%33,36—with comparable devices fabricated using ITO.
Prospects and challenges
There are several possibilities for improving the efficiency of CNT/polymer based solar cells, especially with respect to morphology and energy; for example, developing better processing procedures for CNT, which need to address fine debundling in solvents or solvent mixtures. In this context, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone appears as a potent choice.37 Equally important are the purification, separation, and shortening steps. In short CNT, for example, lower van der Waals attractions facilitate the debundling and processing when compared with long CNT. Recent work has indicated photoluminescence assays of CNT suspensions as a means to test the fine debundling and the compositions of the different CNT.38 Finally, the purification should be considered, which allows deposition of CNT that provide the best frontier orbital energy offset with the co-deposited polymer—see Fig. 3.

When talking about the morphology, on the other hand, it will be crucial to keep the exciton and carriers losses at a minimum through the optimization of the film structure. To this end, composite films are needed, where the phase segregation is smaller then the average exciton diffusion length. A “bicontinuous” carrier transport pathway between the two electrodes is another target. Here, the choice of the polymer structure—with proper and regioregular side chains (i.e., molecular weight and poly-dispersity index)—is certainly an important issue.
In terms of electron transfer efficiency. aligned CNT arrays outperform randomly dispersed CNT.39 Moreover, vertically aligned (i.e., perpendicular to the substrate) arrays reveal improved carrier transport properties. The alignment rate on the surfaces can, for example, be tested by polarized absorption and Raman spectroscopies.40
Deposition methods and post-deposition treatments will be equally important to contribute toward the ultimate goal, namely, to further boost the efficiency of CNT/polymer OPV devices.
