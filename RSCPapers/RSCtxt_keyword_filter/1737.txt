    , Accepted 7th March 2017First published on 8th March 2017AbstractMetal–air batteries show great promise because of their high theoretical energy density resulting from the use of an unlimited, low-mass O2 gaseous reactant. Nevertheless, several issues remain to be tackled for their practical implementation in ambient air. In this work, we constructed a hybrid-type Na–air battery with a flow-through configuration for direct use of ambient oxygen as the cathode, and studied the effect of the flow of the aqueous catholyte on its electrochemical properties. In addition, the effect of the catholyte pH on the open-circuit and discharge–charge voltage behavior of the hybrid Na–air battery was systematically investigated. An enhanced operation voltage was found for the flow cell using an acidic catholyte composed of 1 M NaNO3 and 0.1 M citric acid (pH = ∼1.8). Further improvement in the cell performance was observed in a cell employing both Pt/C and IrO2 electrocatalysts, which showed an average voltage gap of ∼0.4 V between the charge (∼3.7 V) and discharge (∼3.3 V) voltages vs. Na+/Na at a current rate of 0.1 mA cm−2 over 20 cycles (200 h total). These findings suggest that the hybrid Na–air battery system using a flow-through mode and an acidic catholyte could be a promising way to achieve practical Na–air cells with desirable performance.
Introduction
Rechargeable batteries are seen as a powerful technology that enables progress toward a carbon-neutral, sustainable society; they act as a smart medium that interconnects end-users and renewable energy resources, such as wind, solar and geothermal energy.1–3 Although substantial advances in battery technologies have been made over the past decade, society still demands better batteries—higher-energy-density, cheaper, and more sustainable batteries—beyond existing Li-ion batteries (LIBs).3–5 Numerous studies of new chemistries, such as metal–air (Li, Na, and Zn), Li–S, Na–ion, multivalent ions, and redox flow, for next-generation batteries have been conducted to meet such needs.3–5 Among these candidates, Li–air batteries based on aprotic electrolytes possess an extremely high theoretical energy density that exceeds that of LIBs, owing to the combination of highly electropositive Li metal and a significantly low-mass O2 gas phase: 2Li+ + O2 + 2e− ↔ Li2O2.6–10 However, these batteries suffer from fundamental drawbacks, such as (i) passivation of the cathode by the formation of insoluble, insulated discharge products (LiOx), inducing high overpotentials upon charge/discharge and (ii) side reactions with CO2 and moisture introduced from ambient air, leading to corrosion of the Li metal anode and electrolyte degradation.6,11 These factors decisively affect the battery performances, such as the cycling stability, energy density, and energy efficiency.3,6,8–10 In particular, the latter issue necessitates an auxiliary air-filtration or gas-separation technology to prevent ingress of impurities for practical implementation of Li–air systems.
To date, several approaches have been reported to resolve this issue for Li–air systems, such as (i) applying an O2 membrane that allows O2 permeation while blocking moisture from the surrounding air12 and (ii) forming a stable, artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Li metal anode by adding LiNO3 to the electrolytes.13 However, steady degradation of highly reactive Li metal anodes and electrolytes by O2 crossover and/or H2O/CO2 impurities remains a challenge for stable operation of aprotic Li–air systems in ambient air.
An alternative strategy to circumvent the issue is to introduce a hybrid electrolyte system comprising a Li superionic conducting solid electrolyte (LISICON, Li1+x+yTi2−xAlxP3−ySiyO12; x = 0–0.25 and y = 0–0.3), which separates the Li anode in an aprotic electrolyte from the air-electrode in an aqueous electrolyte (catholyte).14 This hybrid-type Li–air concept has been developed primarily by Zhou's group,14–19 Imanishi's group,20–24 and Li et al.25–29 since patents were obtained by PolyPlus Battery Company in 2004.30,31 Although the use of hybrid electrolytes would increase the total volume (weight) of a practical battery system by the addition of a solid electrolyte and an aqueous solution, this protects both the Li metal anode and aprotic electrolyte from detrimental H2O and CO2 in ambient air and induces soluble discharge products (LiOH) on the cathode side [4Li+ + O2 + 2H2O + 4e− ↔ 4LiOH (aq)], eliminating the above problems with aprotic Li–air systems.
Alternatively, the hybrid electrolyte approach to Na–air batteries has been investigated recently by our group32,33 and Hayashi's group.34,35 Although the reduction potential of Na (−2.71 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)) is higher than that of Li (−3.01 V vs. SHE), the replacement of the Li metal anode by Na metal provides several advantages in hybrid-type cells: (i) utilization of a Na superionic conducting solid electrolyte (NASICON, Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12; x = 2) with a higher ionic conductivity (typically >10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature) than LISICON (1–7 × 10−4 S cm−1 at room temperature);36–39 (ii) the absence of a chemical reaction between the NASICON electrolyte and Na metal electrode, indicating the high stability of NASICON against Na metal;40 (iii) cost reduction due to the use of inexpensive Na metal and Na-based precursors for NASICON; and (iv) formation of more soluble discharge products, NaOH, together with Na2CO3, which may be produced by a chemical reaction of NaOH (aq) with CO2 from ambient air, compared to the Li case (refer to Table S1 and ESI Notes 1 and 2†). Owing to the high solubility of the discharge products, hybrid Na–air batteries can provide more than 2.5-fold higher theoretical energy densities than hybrid Li–air batteries, even though the cell voltage is typically reduced by ∼0.3 V as a result of replacing the Li anode with Na (ESI Notes 1 and 2†).34 The overall charge/discharge reactions of a hybrid Na–air cell can be expressed as follows: 4Na+ + O2 (g) + 2H2O (l) + 4e− ↔ 4NaOH (aq), (4-electron transfer, in neutral and alkaline solutions)(1)
As schematically depicted in Fig. 1, during the discharge process, the metallic Na anode in an organic electrolyte is oxidized into Na ions, which move into an aqueous electrolyte through the NASICON film; simultaneously, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) occurs at the air-cathode, forming water-soluble NaOH. During charging, the reverse process occurs via the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) on the cathode side.32–35 Since the cathode reaction in hybrid metal–air batteries relies largely on the kinetics of the OER/ORR on the air-electrode in an aqueous catholyte, the electrode potential (with a 4-electron transfer pathway) theoretically decreases linearly as a function of the catholyte pH, according to the Nernst equation (refer to the upper dotted line for the O2/H2O redox couple in Fig. 3 below). Accordingly, the cathode reaction (OER/ORR) of eqn (1) has a theoretical potential of 0.401 V vs. SHE at pH = 14, whereas the use of an acidic catholyte [eqn (2)] increases the potential to 1.229 V vs. SHE at pH = 0. The overall charge/discharge reactions of a hybrid Na–air cell using an acid (A) can be expressed as follows: 4Na+ + O2 + 4H+ + A* + 4e− ↔ Na4 − A* (aq) + 2H2O, (4-electron transfer in acidic solutions),(2)where A* and Na4 − A* represent the conjugate base of an acid (A) and its Na complex, respectively.
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the hybrid Na–air flow battery equipped with a catholyte tank. The cell consists of the anode (Na metal) in an organic electrolyte and the air-cathode in an aqueous electrolyte, separated by a solid electrolyte (NASICON). The aqueous catholyte is circulated in flow-through mode, continuously replacing the reaction products with fresh reactants near the air-cathode and helping convert ambient oxygen gases to dissolved oxygen (DO) in the catholyte. 
This indicates that the cell voltage of a hybrid Na–air battery as well as its other electrochemical performances can be modulated by using a low-pH solution as the catholyte (refer to ESI Note 3†). The effect of acidic catholytes on the cell voltage and battery performance of hybrid Na–air batteries was investigated systematically in this work. In addition, we employed an open-structured air-cathode, consisting only of the catalyst layer without a conventional gas-diffusion layer in the hybrid Na–air battery. The catalyst layer was simply immersed in the aqueous catholyte (‘Na–water’ concept),41 which was circulated in a flow-through configuration with a scalable storage tank for the fuel (catholyte), as schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. In this system, the energy and power capabilities of the battery can be separated. The power density depends on the physical dimension and configuration of the air-cathode.19,42 This flow-through mode enables a continuous supply of the reactants to the reaction sites on the air-cathode by circulation of the aqueous catholyte in the cell. In particular, the flowing motion allows O2 gas to quickly diffuse from ambient air into the catholyte, providing dissolved oxygen (DO) for the immersed air-electrode. This process helps equalize the O2 concentrations of the ambient air and the catholyte.
In this study, a hybrid Na–air battery with a catholyte-flow-through mode was constructed for the first time, and the effects of the catholyte flow and catholyte pH on the cell performances were investigated. On the basis of this study, a hybrid Na–air flow battery using an acidic catholyte [0.1 M citric acid (CA) + 1 M NaNO3, pH = ∼1.8] was assembled, and its electrochemical performance was further improved by employing Pt/C and IrO2 electrocatalysts, which yielded discharge and charge voltages of ∼3.3 V and ∼3.7 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively, at a current rate of 0.1 mA cm−2 over 20 cycles (200 h total).
Results and discussion
We used commercially available carbon felt as the air-cathode for the hybrid Na–air flow batteries in this work. The carbon felt has abundant microscale empty space between the carbon fibers, as shown in Fig. S1a,† which allows facile transport of the catholyte through the entire air-cathode. Before use, it was heat-treated at 500 °C under an air atmosphere to enhance its hydrophilicity.43 The heated carbon felt (HCF) showed a relatively rough (etched) surface morphology as a result of the heat-treatment, compared to the smooth surface of the pristine carbon felt (Fig. S1a and b†). This change in the surface morphology seemed to be the result of mild oxidation of the carbon surface in ambient air, leading to CO and/or CO2 evolution and the formation of oxygen functional groups such as CO and C–O on the new surface (Fig. S1c†).43 Consequently, a relatively high ID/IG ratio in the Raman spectra, indicating the disordered structure of the graphitic layers, was found for the HCF (Fig. S1d†).
Prior to investigation of the effect of the acidic catholyte on the electrochemical properties of the Na–air cells, we examined the flow and pH effects of the catholyte on the cell performance. Hybrid Na–air cells were assembled using two types of air-cathodes, bare HCF and Pt/C (20 wt% Pt)-coated HCF (see the Experimental details section), because Pt/C is a widely used, representative electrocatalyst for the ORR based on a direct four-electron transfer process. On the other hand, the HCF was tested as a carbonaceous electrode featuring a two-electron transfer ORR pathway. The cells using the bare HCF and Pt/C-loaded HCF are hereafter referred to as the HCF cell and Pt/C cell, respectively. The aqueous catholyte was prepared using 1 M NaNO3 and the pH was varied by using CA and KOH to obtain acidic and alkaline catholytes, respectively.
We examined the discharge behavior of the HCF and Pt/C cells under flow and static catholyte modes. Fig. 2a shows the in situ measurement configuration of a test cell for monitoring the changes in the DO and pH of the catholyte during discharging in ambient air. Initially, the measured DO content and pH of the catholyte were ∼8.6 mg L−1 and ∼6.8, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2b, the HCF and Pt/C cells showed discharge voltages of ∼2.6 V and ∼2.8 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively, at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 under the flowing conditions, which were attributed to the different electrocatalytic abilities of the HCF and Pt/C toward the ORR. The discharge process reduced the DO content while increasing the pH for both cells (Fig. 2c and d, respectively), indicating that the cathode reaction includes a typical ORR at the air-cathode during discharging. It should be noted that the DO content was saturated at ∼8.1 mg L−1 and ∼8.0 mg L−1 for the HCF and Pt/C cells, respectively. This result reveals that the supply rate (by dissolution and transport of ambient oxygen) and consumption rate (by the ORR process) of the DO on the cathode side reached a steady state in flow mode. Interestingly, immediately after the flow was shut off (static mode), the discharge voltage decreased steadily for both cells; however, the reduction rates differed somewhat (shaded region in Fig. 2b).

Photographs showing a test cell system and in situ measurement configuration (a); discharge voltage behavior (b) of the HCF cell (green) and Pt/C cell (orange) at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2 and the changes in DO (c) and pH (d) in the catholyte. The pH and DO measurement probes were placed around 1 cm away from the surface of the air-cathode. The shaded region indicates the static mode without catholyte flow. 
It is found that catholyte flow plays a significant role in supplying the reactants, such as oxygen to the air-cathode by facilitating conversion of ambient oxygen to DO in the catholyte and its diffusion toward the air-cathode. This process reduces the mass-transfer boundary-layer thickness, and hence, increases the limiting current density for the ORR during the discharge process. It appears that the effect of flow is stronger for the HCF cell than for the Pt/C cell; the voltage differences between the flow and static modes were estimated to be ∼0.92 V and ∼0.83 V for the HCF and Pt/C cells, respectively. Although the DO content and pH oscillated somewhat under the static conditions, the overall trends were the same as those under the flow conditions. After the flow was resumed, the discharge voltages of both cells increased abruptly and returned to almost the original values. Similarly, the DO gradually returned to the saturated value and the pH increased monotonically as discharge proceeded.
Next, the effect of the catholyte pH on the open-circuit voltage (OCV) of the HCF and Pt/C cells was investigated (refer to ESI Note 4†). The pH of the catholyte [1 M NaNO3 (aq)] was controlled by varying the amount of CA or KOH, and the OCV was recorded with at least 1 h of catholyte flow. Fig. 3a displays the measured OCV values of the HCF cell (open squares) and Pt/C cell (open circles) as a function of the catholyte pH, together with the fitted lines. For references, four types of theoretical reactions under the standard conditions are also plotted: (i) O2 + 4H+ + 4e− ↔ 2H2O (4-electron transfer reactions based on the O2/H2O redox couple); (ii) O2 + 2H+ + 2e− ↔ H2O2 and (iii) O2 + H2O + 2e− ↔ HO2− + OH− (2-electron transfer reactions based on the O2/peroxide redox couple in acidic and alkaline environments, respectively); and (iv) 2H+ + 2e− ↔ H2 (hydrogen reduction reaction).14,44

OCV of the HCF (open squares) and Pt/C (open circles) cells (a); OCV values of hybrid Li–air cells using various types of air-cathodes from the literature (b). The pH of the catholyte was controlled by using CA (acidic) or KOH (basic). Dotted lines in (a) and (b) represent (i) 4-electron reactions based on the O2/H2O redox couple (upper), (ii) and (iii) 2-electron reactions based on the O2/peroxide redox couple (middle), and (iv) the hydrogen reduction reaction (bottom). The OCV values of hybrid Na–air cells from the literature are also plotted in (a). The size of the symbols in (a) and (b) represents the degree of error of the measured (or obtained) OCV value; i.e., larger symbols represent higher errors in the pH and OCV values. 
The OCV increased with decreasing catholyte pH for both cells, overall, and the curves were located below theoretical line (i) describing 4-electron transfer reactions. For the Pt/C cell, which used a Pt electrocatalyst featuring a direct 4-electron transfer pathway, the variation in the OCV over the entire pH range had a slope similar to that of theoretical line (i); however, the fitted line (red line) was located 0.22–0.30 V below line (i). It has been reported that the electrode surface of noble metals could be covered with an oxide layer in the presence of O2, and hence, the electrode potential will be a mixed potential.44 For Pt electrodes, the OCV (vs. reversible hydrogen electrode) has not typically been 1.23 V, but ∼1 V owing to the surface oxide layer (PtOx),45 which was thought to be responsible for the lower OCV behavior of the Pt/C cell. The HCF cell exhibited a different OCV vs. pH behavior from the Pt/C cell, and the OCV values were closer to theoretical lines (ii) and (iii), which correspond to 2-electron transfer processes. The OCV data in the acidic region almost overlapped line (ii). On the other hand, the data in the alkaline region were located ∼0.15 V above line (iii). These results showed obvious differences in the electrocatalytic activities of HCF and Pt/C toward the OER/ORR in the aqueous catholyte, leading to the distinct OCV behavior as a function of the pH.
We compared the OCV values to those of hybrid Na–air cells (4 references in Fig. 3a) and those of hybrid Li–air cells (20 references in Fig. 3b) from the literature,15–18,20–28,32–35,41,42,46–50 which are summarized in Table 1. All the OCV data were located between line (i) and lines (ii) and (iii) (yellow region), except for one ref. 23. The deviation from theoretical line (i) may be attributed to the lower activity of Na+ (or Li+) in the catholyte than that under the standard conditions, the oxygen partial pressure, and the junction potentials between the solid electrolyte and liquid electrolytes.20 In addition, the catalytic ability toward both the OER and ORR (bifunctionality) of the electrocatalysts, as well as their surface area and hydrophilicity (which determine the effective interface area with aqueous catholytes) could affect the OCV. Although the OCV data for our HCF and Pt/C cells do not lie on the ideal 4-electron transfer process line [line (i)], these results clearly show that the OCV can be increased by modulating (decreasing) the pH of the aqueous catholyte in hybrid Na–air batteries.

The discharge–charge voltage behavior of the Na–air cells and its dependence on the catholyte pH were examined by varying the pH of the catholyte using acidic (pH ∼ 1.8), neutral (pH ∼ 7), and alkaline (pH ∼ 12.5) solutions. The discharge–charge voltage profiles of the HCF cell measured at a current density of 0.01 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4a. Not only the OCV, but also the discharge and charge voltage varied with the catholyte pH (refer to the inset in Fig. 4a); at lower pH values, the OCV and discharge–charge voltage were higher. However, the change in the voltage gap (Vgap) between the discharge and charge curves with changing pH was inconsistent with the OCV change: Vgap was observed to be smaller in the acidic and alkaline catholytes than in the neutral catholyte (inset in Fig. 4a). The larger Vgap in the neutral catholyte was thought to originate from a significant deficiency in H+ or OH− ions, compared to those in the acidic and alkaline cases.51,52 These results indicate that the voltage behavior and voltage efficiency of the cells can be improved by optimizing the catholyte chemistry and selecting appropriate catalysts.

Hybrid Na–air cells based on the acidic catholyte composed of 1 M NaNO3 and 0.1 M CA (pH ∼ 1.8) were assembled using bare HCF, Pt/C-loaded HCF, and Pt/C- and IrO2-loaded HCF as the air-electrode. Fig. 4b exhibits the initial discharge–charge voltage profiles of the HCF and Pt/C cells measured at a current rate of 0.1 mA cm−2. The HCF cell showed charge and discharge voltages of ∼3.96 V and ∼3.04 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively, with a Vgap of ∼0.92 V, whereas the Pt/C cell exhibited a small Vgap of ∼0.46 V and charge and discharge voltages of ∼3.81 V and ∼3.35 V, respectively. To further reduce the Vgap, we added IrO2/C (50 wt% IrO2) electrocatalyst particles onto the Pt/C-coated HCF. IrO2 is one of the best electrocatalysts for the OER in both acidic and alkaline media.53 The cell employing HCF loaded with both Pt/C- and IrO2, hereafter referred to as the Pt/C–IrO2 cell, displayed the smallest Vgap of ∼0.36 V as a result of enhanced kinetics toward the ORR and OER by the catalysts: the charge and discharge voltages were measured to be ∼3.68 V and ∼3.32 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively. The rate capability of the Pt/C–IrO2 cell was also estimated at current densities of 0.05–0.5 mA cm−2 (Fig. S2†). As the current rate was increased, the discharge voltage decreased, whereas the charge voltage increased monotonically, widening the Vgap (inset of Fig. S2†). For example, the Vgap was ∼0.21 V at 0.05 mA cm−2, whereas the value increased to ∼0.94 V at 0.5 mA cm−2.
Next, we studied the cycling stability of the HCF, Pt/C, and Pt/C–IrO2 cells using the acidic catholyte at a current density of 0.1 mA cm−2 for 5 h for each step (Fig. 5a). Overall, all the cells displayed stable cycling performance. The HCF cell displayed a relatively large Vgap of ∼0.93 V, whereas the Pt/C cell had a considerably reduced Vgap of ∼0.47 V during 10 cycles. Although the Pt/C cell showed stable cycling performance, small but notable fluctuations on the charge curve were found as cycling proceeded, which probably resulted from the effect of steady corrosion of carbon particles from the Pt/C during charging.54 For the Pt/C–IrO2 cell, good cycling stability was observed: the charge and discharge voltages were ∼3.68 V and ∼3.32 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively, maintaining a small Vgap of ∼0.36 V during 20 cycles (total 200 h).

Dashed curves in (a) indicate the initial voltage profiles of the cells. Bottom panel in (b) shows the reference XRD pattern of the NASICON phase (Na3Zr2Si2PO12, JCPDS #35-0412). 
The morphological and structural changes of the NASICON in the Pt/C–IrO2 cell after 20 cycles were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in the XRD patterns in Fig. 5b, although the catholyte side of the NASICON exhibited somewhat degraded crystallinity after cycling, compared to pristine NASICON, no significant phase change was found, except for a newly emerging small peak at 35.3°. This peak was assigned to a hydronium-NASICON phase (+symbol), which appeared to be the result of substitution of H3O+ ions provided by the acidic catholyte at Na+ sites in the NASICON.55,56 There was no noticeable change in the surface morphology during repeated cycles (insets in Fig. 5b). The impedance of the Pt/C–IrO2 cell before and after cycling was measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), as shown in Fig. S3.† After 1 cycle, the impedance spectra showed a reduced interface resistance (Ri) which was related to the grain boundary resistance of the NASICON and the interfacial resistances between the NASICON and two liquid electrolytes,35,57 which was thought to be the result of mild etching of the grain boundary of the NASICON during cell operation. However, the Ri increased again after 20 cycles, which was mainly due to the formation of a hydronium-NASICON secondary phase.

Fig. 5c shows the polarization curves and areal power density–voltage characteristics of the HCF and Pt/C–IrO2 cells, measured at a scan rate of 0.05 mA s−1. The current–voltage curve shows that the HCF cell initially exhibited a voltage drop, due to the activation polarization related to the ORR kinetics.58 On the other hand, an almost linear voltage decrease was observed in the initial region for the Pt/C–IrO2 cell owing to the enhancement of the ORR kinetics by Pt/C. The cell using the electrocatalysts produced a maximum output power of ∼5.4 mW cm−2, which was higher than that of the HCF cell (∼4.2 mW cm−2). The total internal resistances of the HCF and Pt/C–IrO2 cells were estimated to be ∼247 Ω and ∼284 Ω, respectively, from the slope of the polarization curves. The relatively high internal resistance of the Pt/C–IrO2 cell was probably attributed to the use of a hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder to coat the HCF with the catalyst particles, resulting in the increases of ohmic and concentration polarizations at high current densities, which should be ameliorated to achieve higher power Na–air batteries.
Conclusions
We explored the effect of the flow and pH of an aqueous catholyte on the electrochemical performance of Na–air flow batteries with hybrid electrolytes. In situ measurements revealed that catholyte flow facilitated conversion of ambient oxygen gases into DO in the catholyte and constantly provided fresh reactants to the air-cathode, which improved the reaction kinetics during discharging. Lowering the pH of the catholyte gave rise to increases in the OCV and operation voltage of the cells. We employed an acidic electrolyte consisting of 1 M NaNO3 and 0.1 M CA (pH = ∼1.8) as the catholyte and electrocatalysts Pt/C and IrO2 on the air-electrode. The cell showed charge and discharge voltages of ∼3.68 V and ∼3.32 V vs. Na+/Na, respectively, at a current rate of 0.1 mA cm−2 and good cycling stability with an average Vgap of ∼0.36 V during 20 cycles (200 h total). The surface morphology and structural properties of the solid electrolyte (Na3Zr2Si2PO12) in the cycled cells revealed no significant changes; however, the formation of a hydronium-NASICON phase should be circumvented for longer-term use in acidic catholytes. Because of their high cost and scarcity, the noble metal-based electrocatalysts used in this work for the OER and ORR, Pt and IrO2, should be replaced with noble metal-free catalysts, such as heteroatom-doped carbon nanostructures.58 In this regard, further development of O2 electrocatalysis technologies for use in aqueous solutions will contribute to enhancing the reaction kinetics at the air-cathode and hence the battery performance of hybrid Na–air cells. In addition, reversible deposition/stripping of Na metal on the anode side, which was not covered in this work, remains a high priority for stable, long-term operation of hybrid Na–air cells.
Experimental details
Characterization
The surface morphology and microstructure of the carbon felt and NASICON ceramic discs were observed by SEM (Verios 460, FEI Company, 10 kV). The crystal structure and structural characteristics were examined by an XRD instrument (D/Max, Rigaku) equipped with a Cu Kα X-ray source and by Raman spectroscopy (Alpha300S, 532 nm laser, WITec). The chemical bonding states were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, K-alpha, Thermo Fisher, UK) with a Mg Kα X-ray source. The pH and DO content were monitored using an Orion™ Star A216 pH Benchtop Meter (Thermo Scientific). The measurement probes were set ∼1 cm from the surface of the air-cathode, which was vertically immersed in the catholyte at a depth of ∼1 cm from the catholyte surface.
Electrochemical evaluation

Preparation of the cell components. 
Carbon felts (XF30A, Toyobo) with a thickness of 4 mm were used as the air-cathodes for Na–air flow batteries. In order to increase the hydrophilicity of the carbon felts, we heat-treated them at 500 °C for 3 h in ambient air. Prior to use, all the HCFs were cleaned by sonication in ethanol and DI water for 10 min each. Coin-type NASICON ceramic electrolytes (Na1+xZr2SixP3−xO12, x = 2) were fabricated according to the procedure described in previous reports33,59,60 and used as a Na+ ion conductive membrane with a thickness of 1 mm and an exposed area of 2 cm2 to separate the anode from the cathode. The ionic conductivity of the NASICON discs was measured to be around 1 × 10−3 S cm−1 at room temperature. The aqueous catholytes were prepared by dissolving NaNO3 (Alfa Aesar) in DI water (18 MΩ cm). The pH of the catholytes was controlled by using CA (Alfa Aesar) or KOH (SAMCHUM Pure Chem.). The acidic catholyte (pH = ∼1.8) was composed of 0.1 M CA and 1 M NaNO3.
Air-cathodes loaded with the commercially available electrocatalysts Pt/C (20 wt% Pt on Vulcan XC-72, Premetek) and/or IrO2 (Alfa Aesar) were prepared as follows. First, the catalyst slurries consisting of the electrocatalyst powder and PVDF (Sigma Aldrich) binder with a weight ratio of 9:1 in a solvent of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (Sigma Aldrich) were prepared. For the IrO2-loaded air-cathodes, a Vulcan XC-72 conducting agent was added to fabricate an IrO2/C mixture (50 wt% IrO2). The slurry was coated on HCFs with an area of 2 cm × 2 cm and then dried in an oven at 80 °C. The loading levels were 1 mg cm−2 and 2.5 mg cm−2 for Pt and IrO2, respectively.


Cell assembly and testing. 
Pouch-type cells were assembled for Na–air flow batteries with hybrid electrolytes. First, the anode compartment was assembled by mounting the NASICON disc on the open-structured top part of the anode and then sealed with the bottom part of the anode, where a Ni tap current collector (Solbrain LTK) with Na metal (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) attached and an organic electrolyte consisting of 1 M NaCF3SO3 (Sigma Aldrich) in tetraethylene glycol dimethyl ether (Sigma Aldrich) were inserted. Assembly was performed in a glovebox under a high-purity Ar atmosphere (O2 and H2O < 1 ppm). The assembled anode compartment and the air-cathode were mounted in a flow cell apparatus with an open-structured cathode (421 Energy Co., Ltd), where the air-cathode was immersed in 200 ml of the flowing catholyte at a depth of approximately 1 cm from the ambient air. The electrochemical properties of the Na–air flow cells were evaluated by using a battery measurement system (WBCS 3000 battery cycler, WonATech). The discharge–charge voltage behavior was tested at current rates of 0.01–0.5 mA cm, (per exposed area of NASICON) at room temperature in ambient air. The EIS was performed with a potentiostat (VSP-300, BioLogic) in a frequency range of 11 kHz to 10 mHz with an amplitude of 10 mV.

The cell consists of the anode (Na metal) in an organic electrolyte and the air-cathode in an aqueous electrolyte, separated by a solid electrolyte (NASICON). The aqueous catholyte is circulated in flow-through mode, continuously replacing the reaction products with fresh reactants near the air-cathode and helping convert ambient oxygen gases to dissolved oxygen (DO) in the catholyte.
