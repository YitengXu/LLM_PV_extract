    , Accepted 19th April 2021First published on 20th April 2021AbstractHeavy-metal-free quantum dots (QDs) are promising luminophores for luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) because of environmental friendliness, which is essential for industrial applications. In order to keep high optical quality and inhibit aggregation-induced quenching, usually QDs can only be loaded at low concentration in a polymer optical waveguide material for LSCs, which significantly impairs the power conversion efficiency (PCE). Thus, it is a challenge to fabricate high-performance LSCs with high QD loading. Here, dual emission Eu-doped ZnO QDs with strong solid-state fluorescence are synthesized via a simple sol–gel method, which enables two characteristic photoluminescence peaks at 551 nm and 614 nm. Furthermore, Eu-doped ZnO QDs with dual fluorescence emission are for the first time reported to be applied in LSCs. The performance of LSCs can be influenced by the loading concentration of Eu-doped ZnO QDs in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) films. The obtained external optical efficiency (ηopt) of the LSCs based on Eu-doped ZnO QDs can be relatively high (4.37%) compared to the reported LSCs with a similar area when the loading concentration of Eu-doped ZnO QDs is up to 13.2% because of both their high photoluminescence intensity and dual fluorescence emission. Our results demonstrate that dual emission Eu-doped ZnO QDs with strong solid-state fluorescence are promising candidates as luminophores for LSCs.
Introduction
Recently, in order to solve problems like energy shortage and environmental protection, clean energies such as solar energy have been widely exploited. Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) as one of the most popular research topics in solar energy have attracted more and more attention.1 LSCs are simply structured optical devices, consisting of a glass or polymer optical waveguide and a fluorescent material that can absorb sunlight and reemit fluorescence.2,3 When sunlight enters the front surface of the optical waveguide, the fluorescent materials therein absorb part of the sunlight and emit fluorescence at a longer wavelength. The excited fluorescence is totally reflected in the optical waveguide material and propagates to the smaller side edges. Solar cells attached to the lateral surfaces of the optical waveguide complete the light gathering and convert it into electrical energy.4–6
Quantum dots (QDs) have been drawing more and more interest because of their wide range of visible light to near-infrared light emission spectrum, large Stokes shift, good optical stability and high fluorescence quantum efficiency.7–10 In addition, heavy metal quantum dots have tunable band gap energy, which can meet the requirements of optoelectronic devices in the near-infrared and short-wavelength infrared band.11–14 Thus, heavy metal quantum dots have been widely employed as luminophores in LSCs because of their high quantum efficiency and good optical properties. Most semiconductor QDs belong to II–VI and IV–VI QDs such as CdS/Se and PbS/Se QDs, which can be employed in LSCs as efficient phosphors. However, these QDs containing heavy metal elements would cause environmental issues, which significantly hinders their industrial applications.15–17 Therefore, researchers have gradually shifted their attention to environmentally friendly and low-toxicity quantum dots. Silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) are indirect band-gap materials with earth-abundant elements, low toxicity,18 near-infrared emission, and less overlap between absorption and emission spectra. Therefore, Si QDs were used in LSCs and a good optical efficiency was obtained.19–21 However, Si QDs are usually difficult to prepare and have poor stability. Carbon quantum dots (CQDs) are a new type of environment-friendly material with high quantum yield, stable optical properties and tunable fluorescence which can be adjusted to the entire visible light spectrum.22–26 Recently, CQDs have been reported to be dispersed in the polymers to prepare LSCs.27–30 However, CQDs were poorly compatible in polymers and were prone to aggregation-induced quenching, which results in a low-loading concentration of CDs and a low optical efficiency. Therefore, there is a high demand on developing suitable QDs to be employed as luminophores for LSC fabrication with high-loading concentration, which can lead to a high optical efficiency.31,32
Zinc oxide quantum dots (ZnO QDs) are photoluminescent semiconductor materials with excellent properties such as low price, low toxicity, good stability, and high quantum efficiency. They have been widely used in optical devices, sensors, and biomedical labels.33,34 Stable water-dispersible ZnO QDs with good fluorescence properties can be synthesized using a simple sol–gel method.35,36 By forming ZnO–graphene quasi-core–shell QDs, white light-emitting diodes with excellent optical properties were fabricated.37 Indium phosphide-zinc oxide core–shell quantum dot structures (InP/ZnO core/shell QDs) were synthesized and applied in LSCs with an optical efficiency of 1.45%.38 The optical performance of ZnO QDs can also be improved through element doping. For example, rare earth element-doped ZnO QDs have been used in biological cell imaging,39 anti-counterfeiting inks40 and fluorescence sensors.41 Among various rare earth element doping, only a few studies have addressed the investigation of europium ion-doped zinc oxide quantum dots (Eu-doped ZnO QDs).42
In this paper, we synthesize Eu-doped ZnO QDs with strong solid-state fluorescence, and report for the first time the application of Eu-doped ZnO QDs in LSCs with high-loading concentration. The fluorescence intensity of the synthesized Eu-doped ZnO QDs is significantly enhanced compared to pure ZnO QDs, and they exhibit yellow-red dual emission fluorescence with a large Stokes shift. The performance of LSCs is influenced by the loading concentration of Eu-doped ZnO QDs in polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) films. For optimum QD concentration, the obtained external optical efficiency of the LSCs based on Eu-doped ZnO QDs can be relatively high compared to the reported LSCs with a similar area. Our work paves the way for the realization of the industrial application of LSCs.
Experimental

Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(Ac)2·2H2O, >99%), europium nitrate hexahydrate (Eu(NO3)3·6H2O, >99.99%), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, >99%) were purchased from Aladdin. All of them were analytical reagents. Potassium hydroxide (KOH, >98%), ethanol (C2H5OH, >99.9%), ethyl acetate (C4H8O2), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) and acetone were supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. The chemical reagents were used as received without further purification. The float glass was purchased from Luoyang Glass Co., Ltd.
Preparation of ZnO QDs and Eu-doped ZnO QDs

ZnO QDs. 
1.1 g Zn(Ac)2·2H2O was dissolved in 30 mL mixed solution of ethanol and DMSO (the ratio is 2:1) under continuous stirring. Then, 4 mL KOH ethanol solution (1.75 M) was put into the above solution. The mixed solution was transferred to a three-neck flask, and continuously stirred and refluxed at different temperatures (20–60 °C) for different reaction durations (1–4 hours), and then cooled to room temperature. Finally, precipitation occurred when ethyl acetate was added to the mixed solution. After that, the precipitates were washed several times with ethanol and water, respectively, and were finally dried in an oven at 80 °C.


Eu-doped ZnO QDs. 
First, Eu(NO3)3·6H2O (0 g, 0.05 g, 0.1 g, 0.15 g or 0.2 g) and 1.1 g Zn(Ac)2·2H2O were dissolved in 30 mL mixed solution of ethanol and DMSO (the ratio is 2:1) and heated to 50 °C under continuous stirring. Then, 4 mL KOH ethanol solution (1.75 M) was put into the above solution. The mixed solution was continuously stirred and refluxed at 50 °C for 3 hours, and then cooled to room temperature. Finally, precipitation occurred when the ethyl acetate was added to the mixed solution. After that, the precipitates were washed several times with ethanol and water, respectively, and were finally dried in an oven at 80 °C.

Fabrication of Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP thin-film LSCs with various QD loading concentrations
The float glass with a size of 2 × 2 × 0.1 cm3 was polished at the edges, followed by ultrasonic cleaning with acetone, deionized water and ethanol for 1 h. 2 g PVP was dissolved in 10 mL Eu-doped ZnO QDs (doped with 0.15 g Eu(NO3)3·6H2O) ethanol solution (2.2 wt%, 4.4 wt%, 8.8 wt%, 13.2 wt%, 17.6 wt% or 22 wt%) and stirred at 60 °C for 1 h to form a homogeneous mixture. 0.3 mL Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP mixture solution was drop-coated on the glass substrate. The substrate was heated at 60 °C for 5 h and annealed at 80 °C for 1 h to form a highly uniform film. Finally, these Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP thin-film LSCs (with an active area of 4 cm2) were coupled with monocrystalline silicon solar cells (with an active area of 0.18 cm2) for subsequent testing. The solar cells were manufactured by Sunshine Science and Education Energy Co. Ltd. The J–V curve of the silicon solar cell used under 1 sun is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Characterization
UV–visible absorption spectra were recorded using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (UV2600, Shimadzu Corp., Tokyo, Japan).43 Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured at room temperature with a time-resolved fluorescence spectrometer (FL3-22, Jobin-Yvon, USA). The fluorescence lifetimes were collected by a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) spectrometer (Newport, USA) with a femtosecond laser (Spirit 1040-8W, Spectra-Physics, USA). Quantum yield measurements were performed with the FLS1000 Photoluminescence Spectrometer (Edinburgh, UK). The morphology of the samples was measured by Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEM-2100F TEM (JEOL, Japan).44 X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed using a D8 Advance diffractometer (Bruker, Germany, Kα = 1.5406 Å) to get the structures of ZnO QDs and Eu-doped ZnO QDs. The actual Eu doping in a ZnO structure was quantified by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectra (ICP) using a Prodigy 7 (USA, Leemanlabs). The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of the samples were collected by using a Thermo Fisher Scientific ESCALAB 250Xi spectrometer (USA). Photovoltaic properties of the Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP thin-film LSCs were obtained with a solar simulator (IV4112, Newport Corp., Irvine, CA, USA) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (1 sun), calibrated through a calibrated silicon solar cell. During the test of the photoelectric conversion performance, one side of the optical waveguide was in contact with the solar cell and the other three sides were closely attached with a flat mirror. The purpose is to let the light gather and exit only from the side containing the solar cell.
Results and discussion
In order to optimize the synthesis parameters, we carried out the synthesis experiments of ZnO QDs at different reaction temperatures (in the interval 20–60 °C) with different reaction time (between 1 and 4 hours). As shown in Fig. 1a, the photoluminescence intensity of pure ZnO QDs reached a maximum value when the synthesis temperature was at 50 °C under the constant reaction time of 3 h. Based on different reaction times, it can be seen that the photoluminescence intensity of pure ZnO QDs was the strongest when the reaction time was 3 h under the constant reaction temperature of 50 °C, as shown in Fig. 1b. In the following experiments, we fabricated ZnO QDs and Eu-doped ZnO QDs by using the optimal process parameters (3 h, 50 °C).

Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis absorption spectrum of pure ZnO QDs and Eu-doped ZnO QDs, which reveals that Eu-doping did not change the absorbance of ZnO QDs. Fig. 2b shows the emission spectra of pure ZnO QDs and Eu-doped ZnO QDs with different doping concentrations at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. As the doping concentration increased from 0 to 0.2 g europium nitrate hexahydrate, the fluorescence intensity of Eu-doped ZnO QDs decreased first and then increased. When the doping concentration was 0.15 g, the fluorescence intensity reached the maximum value. Fig. 2c shows the fluorescence emission spectrum of pure ZnO QDs under different excitation wavelengths from 365 nm to 405 nm. The maximum emission peak of pure ZnO QDs was kept at 551 nm, and the fluorescence intensity was the largest under the excitation wavelength at 365 nm. This reveals that pure ZnO QDs emit good yellow fluorescence and have no excitation-dependent properties. As shown in Fig. 2d, under the excitation wavelength at 380 nm, Eu-doped ZnO QDs with doping concentration of 0.15 g exhibited dual emission fluorescence with the emission peaks of ZnO QDs at 551 nm and Eu at 614 nm, which is produced by the 5D0 → 7F2 transition of an Eu3+ ion.42 The above results show that the absorption peaks of Eu-doped ZnO QDs are far away from the emission peaks. Therefore, the large Stokes shift is quite beneficial for the application of LSCs. As shown in Fig. 2e, when the excitation wavelength gradually increased to 395 nm, the PL intensity of europium ions reached the strongest, much higher than the intensity of ZnO. The emission peaks of Eu-doped ZnO QDs were at 585 nm and 614 nm which are produced by the 5D0 → 7F1 and 5D0 → 7F2 transition of the Eu3+ ion. There was a weak emission peak at 693 nm belonging to the 5D0 → 7F4 transition of the Eu3+ ion. Fig. 2f shows the photoluminescence excitation spectra (the left) and photoluminescence spectra (the right) of the pure ZnO QDs and Eu doped ZnO QDs have a similar peak position. The photoluminescence excitation spectra from 300 nm to 500 nm indicate that the optimal excitation peak is at 365 nm. The maximum emission peak of pure and Eu-doped ZnO QDs is at 551 nm from the photoluminescence spectra excited by 365 nm wavelength. This is consistent with the results in Fig. 2b. According to Fig. 2f, comparing the PLE with PL, the Stokes shift is about 186 nm which is noteworthy and promising for the application of Eu-doped ZnO QDs in LSCs.

The morphologies of pure ZnO QDs and Eu-doped ZnO QDs were characterized by TEM (Fig. 3). From Fig. 3a, it can be seen that the shape of the pure ZnO QD particles was regular. The inset in Fig. 3a is the high-resolution TEM which shows that the interplanar spacing was 0.24 nm, corresponding to the (101) crystal plane of ZnO. The obvious lattice fringes confirm the high crystallinity of the ZnO QDs. Fig. 3b shows that the particle size of the ZnO QDs was uniform. Most of the particle sizes were between 4 and 7 nm, and the average particle size was ∼5.8 nm. According to Fig. 3c and d, it can be seen that Eu-doped ZnO QDs had a uniform particle size with an average size of 4.6 nm. The inset in Fig. 3c shows that the interplanar spacing was 0.25 nm. Compared to pure ZnO QDs, the interplanar spacing of Eu-doped ZnO QDs was slightly larger and the particle size was generally smaller. It is speculated that a part of the Zn ions are replaced when Eu3+ ions with larger ionic radius are inserted. Therefore, the interplanar spacing becomes larger. At the same time, during the growth of the crystal, Eu doping will affect the movement of the interface during the growth of the crystal, resulting in smaller particle size.

We measured the concentration of actual Eu doping in the ZnO structure using ICP. As shown in Fig. 4, the concentration of actual Eu doping in the ZnO structure increased with the amount of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O from 0.05 to 0.20 g. The actual Eu concentration in the ZnO structure was 3.46% when the amount of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O was 0.05 g. When the amount of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O was 0.15 g, the actual Eu concentration in the ZnO structure reached 7.57%. The above inference was further demonstrated by the XRD results as shown in Fig. 5. All the XRD peaks of the sample (pure-ZnO QDs) can be readily indexed to wurtzite ZnO (JCPDS 89-1397). The XRD diffraction peaks (2θ) of Eu-doped ZnO QDs were located at 31.65°, 34.28°, 36.08°, 47.4°, 56.6°, and 62.7°, which correspond to (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), and (103), respectively.45 Compared to pure-ZnO QDs, these peaks showed a blue shift of about 0.2°, which indicates that Eu ions were successfully doped into the lattice of ZnO QDs. As shown in Fig. 6, the lifetime was measured by the emission at 550 nm with the excitation wavelength at 380 nm. For the decay curves of all samples, they were fitted using a biexponential decay function, revealing that the decay curves of each sample have two decay profiles with a fast decay (τ1) and a slow decay (τ2). The τ1 and τ2 of pure ZnO QDs are 4.81 and 36.37 ns. With the different concentrations of Eu doping, there are slight changes in the decay curves. The τ1 slightly decreased from 4.75, to 4.69, 4.66 and 4.56 ns as the doping concentration increased from 0.05 g to 0.20 g Eu(NO3)3·6H2O. However, the τ2 slightly increased from 37.21, 37.38, 37.64 to 38.50 ns. This shows that for Eu-dopd ZnO QDs the energy transfer from the ZnO host to the europium ion is efficient.15,46

In addition, XPS spectra were collected to analyze the chemical composition of pure ZnO QDs and Eu-doped ZnO QDs (Fig. 7). As shown in Fig. 7a, the XPS spectra of both the pure ZnO QDs and Eu-doped ZnO QDs contain the signal from Zn 2p 3 and O 1s, located at 1021.1 eV and 530.9 eV, respectively. There is no obvious difference in Zn and O signal between the Eu-doped and the undoped sample except for the Eu signal. The only difference is that the signal from Eu 3d was located at 1134.6 eV in the XPS spectra of Eu-doped ZnO QDs, which is in good agreement with the XRD results. As shown in Fig. 7d, the peaks of Eu 3d are located at 1134.6 eV and 1164.2 eV, corresponding to Eu 3d 5/2 and Eu 3d 3/2. Additional peaks at 1124.5 eV and 1154.2 eV are due to the shake-down satellites of Eu3+ 3d 3/2 and Eu3+ 3d 5/2, respectively.47 The high-resolution spectrum of Zn 2p exhibited two peaks, Zn 2p 3/2 and Zn 2p 1/2, located at 1021.1 eV and 1044.1 eV, as shown in Fig. 7b. The O 1s band was deconvoluted into three peaks at 529.7 eV, 531.1 eV and 532.3 eV, which are consistent with the O–Zn bond (OM), oxygen vacancy (OV) and hydroxyl bond (OH), respectively, as shown in Fig. 7c.48

We used Eu-doped ZnO QDs as luminophores to fabricate LSCs since they show good fluorescence properties: the self-quenching-resistant Eu-doped ZnO QDs exhibit strong solid-state fluorescence. As a result, these QDs can be highly loaded in a polymer waveguide matrix such as PVP for LSC fabrication. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of Eu-doped ZnO QDs with different concentrations of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O. The results show that the PLQY of the Eu-doped ZnO QDs was up to 75.26% when the concentration of Eu(NO3)3·6H2O was 0.15 g. We studied the effect of different loading concentrations of Eu-doped ZnO QDs on the performance of LSC. We measured the photovoltaic parameters of Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP thin-film LSCs with various loading concentrations as shown in Table 1. The external optical efficiency (ηopt) is defined as ηopt = Pout/Pin = ILSC/Isc × G, where Pout is power coming out of the edge of the LSC, and Pin is the incident solar power. ILSC refers to the measured short circuit current from the PV cell attached to the LSCs. Isc represents the short circuit current of the identical PV cell under direct solar radiation. G is defined as the ratio of the LSC area (ALSC) to the solar cell area (Acell). In our case, G is 22. They are all the important parameters to evaluate the performance of LSCs.49

It can be seen that the values of Isc, Voc, and ηopt first increased with the mass concentration of Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP and then decreased according to the data in Table 1. Photovoltaic parameters of pure ZnO QDs/PVP thin-film LSCs are shown in Table S1 (ESI†), which reveals that the value of ηopt is only 1.11%. Fig. 8a shows the schematic illustration of the LSC consisting of PVP film and Eu-doped ZnO QDs. As shown in Fig. 8b, the value of ηopt could reach up to 4.37%, when the loading concentration of Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP was 13.2%, which means that ZnO QDs can be highly loaded in the PVP polymer matrix, and the highly loaded QDs are quite beneficial for the performance of the LSCs. The reason why the maximum value appears is that as the QD concentration increases, the absorption rate of the UV light portion becomes higher, at the same time, more light is transported from the medium to the side. The increased light flux per unit area results in increased optical efficiency. However, at higher concentration, the light is self-absorbed when passing through the film, and the waveguide losses are greater, resulting in a weaker unit light intensity transmitted to the solar cell. The excellent photovoltaic performance of the LSCs based on Eu-doped ZnO QDs is also due to the large Stokes shift and dual emissive of Eu-doped ZnO QDs which are the key parameters. The inset in Fig. 8b is the photograph of the Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP thin-film based LSC sample under UV illumination, which clearly shows that the emitted light can be wave-guided to the slab edges of LSCs through total internal reflection. Another feature, which helps to improve the efficiency, is the presence of the glass substrate, which can act as a non-absorbing waveguide in the so-called laminated LSC structure.50 It should be noted that, in our case, the obtained external optical efficiency is relatively high compared to the reported LSCs with a similar area (dimensions of 2 × 2 cm2) because of both their high PL intensity and dual emission (Table 2). Finally, we studied the stability of the Eu-doped ZnO QDs LSCs. The results show that after six days, the ηopt is 3.63%, revealing the good stability of the LSCs (Fig. S3, ESI†).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we reported a facile approach to synthesize Eu-doped ZnO QDs with good stability, low toxicity, high fluorescence, large Stokes shift and dual emission. For the first time, we demonstrated that Eu-doped ZnO QDs could be applied to fabricate LSCs with high-loading concentration. We investigated the performance of Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP thin-film based LSCs with various loading concentrations of Eu-doped ZnO QDs. The Voc and ηopt of LSCs could reach 0.59 V and 4.37%, when the loading concentration of Eu-doped ZnO QDs was 13.2%. The obtained ηopt of the LSCs based on Eu-doped ZnO QDs can be relatively high (4.37%) compared to the reported LSCs with a similar area because of both their high PL intensity and dual emission. Based on the above results, Eu-doped ZnO QDs/PVP thin-film LSCs may be a promising candidate in smart windows, contributing to solving the issues related to the use of toxic materials, offering at the same time good efficiency for large scale exploitation.
