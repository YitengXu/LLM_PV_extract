    , Accepted 17th September 2018First published on 10th October 2018AbstractMetal–organic framework (MOF)-derived carbon materials have been widely used as catalysts for a variety of electrochemical energy applications, and thermally carbonized zinc-2-methylimidazole (ZIF-8) has shown particularly high performance owing to its microporous structure with a large surface area. However, in the presence of bulky chemical species, such as triiodide, in mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), the small pore size of carbonized ZIF-8 causes a significant limitation in mass transfer and consequentially results in a poor performance. To resolve this problem, we herein report a simple strategy to enlarge the pore sizes of ZIF-8-derived carbon by increasing the dwelling time of Zn in ZIF-8 during the thermal carbonization process. A thin and uniform polydopamine shell introduced on the surface of ZIF-8, with the aim of retarding the escape of vaporized Zn species, leads to a dramatic increase in pore sizes, from the micropore to mesopore range. The porosity-tailored carbonized ZIF-8 manifests an excellent electrocatalytic performance in triiodide reduction, and when it was applied as the counter electrode of DSCs, an energy conversion efficiency of up to 9.03% is achievable, which is not only superior to that of the Pt-based counterpart but also among the highest performances of DSCs employing carbonaceous electrocatalysts.
Introduction
On account of rapidly growing demands on renewable and sustainable energy sources, great efforts have been put to the development of highly efficient solar cells. Among various types of photovoltaics, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have gained attention owing to their reliable performance, economic feasibility, and wide range of possible applications.1–6 DSCs are generally driven by a mesoscopic TiO2 photoelectrode with visible light-absorbing dyes on the surface, and a counter electrode (CE) is used for electrocatalytic regeneration of redox species (typically triiodide/iodide, I3−/I−) in the electrolyte.7–9 These redox couples subsequently restore charges to the photoelectrodes, constituting the complete electrical circuit for solar-to-electrical energy conversion. Though the overall performance of DSCs is dominated by the light harvesting and charge collection efficiency of the photoelectrodes, CEs are responsible for a significant portion of manufacturing cost due to the usage of noble metal catalysts such as platinum.9–13 Various low-cost materials have been suggested as candidates to replace Pt, and meaningful progress has been made by using carbonaceous materials,14–18 conductive polymers,19–22 and inorganic compounds with diverse compositions and architectures.23–30
Recently, among various nanostructured composites,31–36 metal–organic framework (MOF)-derived materials have been intensively studied in electrochemical energy conversion and storage, for MOFs have a number of favorable characteristics such as a porous structure with high uniformity and a large variety of possible compositions.37,38 In DSCs, nanostructured sulfides synthesized using MOFs were first applied as electrocatalysts in CEs,39 followed by reports on numerous MOF-based composites with decent performances.40–45 Meanwhile, in other fields of electrochemical applications, nitrogen-doped microporous carbons prepared by thermal carbonization of a Zn-containing zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF), typically zinc-2-methylimidazole (ZIF-8), have been widely used.46–48 Unlike other metals in MOFs, Zn vaporizes during the thermal carbonization and forms microporous carbon with a large available surface area.49,50 In addition, it has high N-content due to the presence of imidazole in the framework, which serves as a rich N source. As a result, ZIF-8-derived carbons provide a large number of active catalytic sites for various electrochemical reactions, and the oxygen reduction reaction in fuel cells is a typical example.51–54 Carbonized ZIF-8 was also applied as a CE material for DSCs, and an energy conversion efficiency slightly lower than that of the Pt counterpart was obtained.55 Given that numerous types of carbonaceous materials manifested superior performances compared to Pt, it could be presumed that carbonized ZIF-8 has some limitation in the electrocatalytic reduction of triiodides.13,18 The large surface area of carbon-based electrocatalysts and the presence of N-dopants are known to increase the number of active sites and their activities, and thus the shortcoming of carbonized ZIF-8 was more likely to result from its structural property, which has significant influence on the mass transfer of redox species. The length of I3− is known to be approximately 1 nm,56 which is a significantly larger size than those of chemical species for which carbonized MOFs exhibit excellent performances. Therefore, insufficient pore size for facile movements of I3−/I− redox couples was suspected to be one of the most probable reasons.
As stated above, vaporization of Zn during the thermal carbonization of ZIF-8 leads to the formation of micropores. It is also widely known that Zn species serve as porogens in thermal carbonization of various organic and polymeric materials,57–60 and an increased amount of Zn present in the carbon precursors augments the size of pores even up to the mesoscale.57,58 Yu et al. have recently verified that enlargement of pore size occurs as a result of ZnO formation prior to vaporization, which accompanies deoxygenation of carbon precursors and promotes graphitization of the resulting carbon materials.61 However, since Zn constitutes the periodic framework of ZIF-8, its content cannot be increased further. Therefore, pore sizes of the resulting carbon are restricted to the micropore range, which is unfavorable for the mass transfer of the redox species. In this study, we suggest a simple strategy to enlarge the pore sizes of ZIF-8-derived carbons, by maximizing the influence of Zn within ZIF-8 during the carbonization process. We introduced a thin and uniform polydopamine shell on the surface of ZIF-8 in order to increase the dwelling time of Zn within ZIF-8 before the escape of vaporized Zn, which engenders the formation of open-pore structures. As a result, the pore size of the resulting N-doped carbon was increased to the mesopore range, and this porosity-tailored ZIF-8-derived carbon led to a significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performance in triiodide reduction. When the synthesized N-doped carbon with enlarged pores was applied as a CE material in DSCs, an energy conversion efficiency of up to 9.03% was achieved, which is a superior value compared to those obtained by using carbonized ZIF-8 (8.34%) and state-of-the-art Pt (8.85%).
Results and discussion
Synthesis and physical characterization
As depicted in Fig. 1, ZIF-derived N-doped carbons were prepared by thermal carbonization of pristine ZIF-8 particles with or without polydopamine shells. Polydopamine coating on ZIF-8 was carried out by immersing the ZIF-8 particles into a buffer solution (pH 8.5) containing 10 mM dopamine hydrochloride, followed by mild stirring for 2 h. Pristine ZIF-8 and polydopamine-coated ZIF-8 (ZIF-8-dopa) were then thermally carbonized in an Ar atmosphere at 800 °C for 2 h. The carbonized ZIF-8 (ZIF-8-C) and ZIF-8-dopa (ZIF-8-dopa-C) were first characterized by electron microscopy. Fig. 2a–d display the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of ZIF-8-C, where polyhedral structure with slight shrinkage (i.e. polyhedrons with concave faces) was observable. Meanwhile, the SEM images in Fig. 2e–h show that ZIF-8-dopa-C particles have a similar structure but with more rounded edges attributable to the polydopamine shells. Fig. 3 shows the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the ZIF-8-C (Fig. 3a) and ZIF-8-dopa-C (Fig. 3b). The morphologies of the ZIF-derived carbons in the TEM images matched well with those from the SEM analyses, and approximately 20 nm-thick shells were clearly observable in the outer parts of ZIF-8-dopa-C. Elemental maps of carbon and nitrogen were additionally obtained based on the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) technique, and the images are displayed as the insets of Fig. 3. Both C and N were uniformly distributed in ZIF-8-C, but for ZIF-8-dopa-C, signals from carbon were relatively stronger at the shell and a larger amount of nitrogen at the core was noted. This difference is attributable to the dissimilar C and N compositions in the precursors; N content of imidazolate in ZIF-8 is higher than that of polydopamine. Moreover, amorphous characteristics of the ZIF-derived carbons were recognizable from the TEM images of diverse magnifications (see Fig. S1 and S2† for the TEM images of ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C, respectively).

ZIF-derived N-doped carbons were then analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), the results of which are depicted in Fig. 4a. Given that pristine ZIF-8 particles have numerous diffraction peaks originated from their highly periodic structure (see the inset of Fig. 4a), which also matched well with the simulated XRD patterns,62,63 it could be verified from the XRD results that ZIF-8 and ZIF-8-dopa were completely transformed into amorphous carbons during the heat treatment. Fig. 4b displays the N2 sorption analysis results of the ZIF-derived N-doped carbons, from which Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas of ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C were obtained to be 629.22 m2 g−1 and 353.69 m2 g−1, respectively. ZIF-8-C showed a typical type I isotherm, indicating that the majority of its pores are micropores. Meanwhile, a I,IV-hybrid type isotherm was observed in the case of ZIF-8-dopa-C, verifying the presence of mesopores in ZIF-8-dopa-C, which seems to be the main reason for its smaller BET surface area. From the pore distributions of the ZIF-derived N-doped carbons calculated by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) method (see the inset of Fig. 4b), it was notable that mesopores were well-developed in ZIF-8-dopa-C, while ZIF-8-C had negligible pore volumes in that region.

As mentioned in the Introduction, Zn in thermal carbonization procedures was reported to facilitate carbon graphitization and deoxygenation (ZnO formation), which consequentially leads to an increased pore size after removal of Zn species.61 It is also widely known that the pore size can be increased by adding a larger amount of Zn salts to the precursors for carbon synthesis.57,58 Considering that there are no pore-forming agents in ZIF-8 and ZIF-8-dopa other than Zn in the frameworks and that the only difference between them is the presence of the polydopamine layer, the promoted formation of mesopores in ZIF-8-dopa-C is ascribable to the increased influence of Zn on the resulting carbon owing to the shell on the surface. Since the polydopamine coating process first generates a dense layer on the surface,64,65 vaporized Zn seems to escape from ZIF-8-dopa at a slower rate during the thermal carbonization when compared with the case of ZIF-8. In order to verify this, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out in an Ar atmosphere. Fig. 4c and d show the TGA curves of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8-dopa measured under an identical condition to the thermal carbonization process: elevation of temperature at a rate of 5 °C min−1 up to 800 °C followed by temperature maintenance at 800 °C for 2 h. As depicted in Fig. 4c, the weight of ZIF-8-dopa gradually decreased as soon as the temperature exceeded room temperature while ZIF-8 did not manifest a significant weight loss until ∼600 °C. The different behaviors of ZIF-8 and ZIF-8-dopa seem to be caused by the properties of polydopamine shells, as the polydopamine shells without ZIF-8 (removed by an acid treatment) manifested a substantial drop in weight as the temperature was increased from 25 to 600 °C (Fig. S3†). On the other hand, at temperatures above 600 °C, the weight of ZIF-8 showed a steeper decrease, and the overall weight loss of ZIF-8 exceeded that of ZIF-8-dopa soon after reaching at the temperature of 800 °C (Fig. 4d). This observation clearly shows that the dwelling time of Zn was increased by the presence of polydopamine shells, increasing the (pore-enlarging) influence of Zn and giving rise to the formation of mesopores, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 5.

Fig. 4e shows the X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) data of ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C at the carbon K-edge. In general, signals at around 285.3 and 293.0 eV are known to originate from sp2- and sp3-carbons, respectively, and the peak located at 288.5 eV is related to carbons bonded to oxygen or nitrogen.66,67 From the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) C 1s spectra (Fig. S4†), it could be verified that the degree of carbon oxidation is similar in ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C, though ZIF-8-dopa-C showed a slightly larger amount of oxygen near the surface (see Table S1a and Fig. S4†).68,69 Therefore, a smaller XAS peak from ZIF-8-dopa-C at 288.5 eV could be attributed to a lower N content of ZIF-8-dopa-C when compared with ZIF-8-C. This was additionally confirmed by XPS N 1s spectra (Fig. 4f), which showed that a significantly larger amount of nitrogen is present in the surface of ZIF-8-C than for the case of ZIF-8-dopa-C. We previously observed from the elemental maps of ZIF-8-dopa-C (Fig. 3b) that the N content in the ZIF-8-derived internal part is higher than that in the polydopamine-based shell, and this is in line with the XPS data which dominantly show the signals from the surface. The XPS N 1s spectra were fitted according to three types of nitrogen (pyridinic, pyrrolic, and graphitic),70,71 and the detailed results are displayed in Table S1b and Fig. S5.† Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that the XAS peak from sp2-carbon was larger in ZIF-8-dopa-C than in ZIF-8-C. Given that Zn facilitates graphitization of carbon and that its content is higher in ZIF-8 than in ZIF-8-dopa (because Zn hardly exists in the pristine polydopamine shell), ZIF-8-C was likely to show a larger sp2-carbon signal than ZIF-8-dopa-C. Nevertheless, the XAS peak at 285.3 eV was larger in the case of ZIF-8-dopa-C. This observation also supports our approach that introduction of the polydopamine shell confines Zn vapor within the ZIF particle for a longer time and thereby increases the influence of Zn during the carbonization (graphitization and pore enlargement).
Electrochemical performance for triiodide reduction
In order to prepare CEs employing ZIF-8-C or ZIF-8-dopa-C as electrocatalysts, N-doped carbons were sprayed onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/glass substrates with the assistance of Nafion binders, and the areal loading of the ZIF-derived N-doped carbons was 0.3 mg cm−2. The deposited N-doped carbons were then heat-treated at 500 °C in an Ar-filled tube for 4 h to improve the structural and electrical connections between the particles. State-of-the-art platinum CEs were also prepared as control samples by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 on FTO/glass substrates.72 Electrocatalytic activities of Pt, ZIF-8-C, and ZIF-8-dopa-C CEs were first investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) analyses in an acetonitrile electrolyte containing I3−/I− redox couples. From the CV diagrams depicted in Fig. 6a, we could observe two sets of redox peaks: signals from I3−/I2 and I3−/I− in relatively higher and lower potential regions, respectively.73,74 Given that CEs are responsible for the reduction of I3− to I− in DSCs, cathodic peaks located at lower potentials were chosen for proper comparisons (all of the potentials were calculated with regard to the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode). The peak for the ZIF-8-C CE was located at −0.337 V, which is a more negative potential when compared with the −0.286 V of the Pt CE. This indicates that ZIF-8-C has lower electrocatalytic activity than the Pt counterpart. On the other hand, the peak potential of the ZIF-8-dopa-C CE was observable at a relatively positive position (−0.273 V) compared to the case of the Pt CE, and this clearly demonstrates the superior performance of ZIF-8-dopa-C to Pt. The trend in the peak potentials matched well with the peak-to-peak distance of the I3−/I− reaction, which were 0.269, 0.367, and 0.260 V for the Pt, ZIF-8-C, and ZIF-8-dopa-C CEs, respectively.

Moreover, ZIF-8-dopa-C manifested the largest current densities among the three CEs prepared in this study, implying that the amount of I3− species being reduced to I− is the greatest when ZIF-8-dopa-C is used as the electrocatalyst. Though the large current density of the ZIF-8-dopa-C CE compared to the Pt counterpart was ascribable to its large surface area which originated from its porous structure, it was interesting to observe smaller currents from the ZIF-8-C CE. As can be seen from the strong linear correlation between the peak current densities and the square root of scan rates in Fig. S6,† electrocatalytic reduction of I3− to I− is governed by the mass transfer rate of the reactants and products. Given that the surface area of ZIF-8-C was significantly larger than that of ZIF-8-dopa-C from the BET analyses, the smaller current densities of ZIF-8-C show that its large surface area is not being utilized effectively in the electrocatalysis of I3−/I−, due to the hindrance in the mass transfer of the triiodide species caused by insufficient pore sizes. This clearly shows that the enlarged pores in ZIF-8-dopa-C increased the overall electrocatalytic performance by effective utilization of its nanostructure and facilitation of mass transfer of the redox species.
Additionally, long-term stability of the ZIF-derived N-doped carbons was investigated. Fig. 6b–d show the CV diagrams of Pt, ZIF-8-C, and ZIF-8-dopa-C measured up to 100 cycles. High durability of ZIF-8-dopa-C was observable from excellent retention of the peak potential, though a slight decrease in current density was unavoidable. In contrast, a significant drop of electrocatalytic activity was noted in the case of ZIF-8-C. As stated above, ZIF-8-C seems to suffer from poor mass transfer of redox species due to its small-sized pores. In this case, a significant amount of accumulated charges in the ZIF-8-C CE may not participate in the I3− reduction but consequentially degrade the electrode materials. On the other hand, ZIF-8-dopa-C with enlarged pores showed superior characteristics in terms of both the electrocatalytic performance and durability, owing to the enhanced mass transfer of redox species, which enables them to reach the active sites more easily.
For a more accurate comparison on electrocatalytic performances, symmetric cells were prepared by assembling the identical CEs using 50 μm-thick thermoplastic sealants (Surlyn, DuPont), followed by injection of the I3−/I− redox electrolyte. Fig. 7a shows the Tafel polarization curves of the symmetric cells employing the Pt, ZIF-8-C, or ZIF-8-dopa-C CEs. ZIF-8-dopa-C manifested the largest current densities in all voltage regions, demonstrating the highest electrocatalytic performance of ZIF-8-dopa-C among the three CE materials. Meanwhile, an opposite behavior was observed in the ZIF-8-C and Pt CEs depending on the applied voltages. When the voltage was relatively low (kinetic region), Pt showed higher current density than ZIF-8-C. This tendency was reversed in the relatively high-voltage region, wherein the number of active sites has a larger influence. This implies that Pt has higher catalytic activity but smaller surface area than ZIF-8-C. For a clearer evaluation of the electrocatalytic performances, the trend in exchange current density (J0) was compared based on the slopes of the polarization curves in the zero-voltage region (Fig. 7b). ZIF-8-dopa-C manifested a larger slope and thus a larger J0 compared to Pt, from which the superior performance of ZIF-8-dopa-C could be clearly confirmed. ZIF-8-C showed the smallest slope as expected from the CV results and Tafel polarization curves.

Analyses on kinetics by factors
In order to understand the origin of the high performance of ZIF-8-dopa-C in I3−/I− electrocatalysis, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analyses were carried out using the symmetric cells. Fig. 8a–c show the Nyquist diagrams of the symmetric cells employing Pt, ZIF-8-C, or ZIF-8-dopa-C obtained at various temperatures (from 283 to 323 K), respectively. The EIS results were fitted according to the equivalent circuit in Fig. S7,†75 and the detailed values are displayed in Table S2† and Fig. 8d and e. We should first note that there were small semicircles at the x-intercept (high-frequency region) of the Nyquist plots in the cases of ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C (see Fig. S8† for magnified plots). These signals were often observed when porous carbons were applied as CE materials, but their origin is still controversial; these semicircles are expected to be related to the Nernst diffusion of iodide species within the pores in the carbon76,77 or the response from the basal plane of carbon.17 Nonetheless, these semicircles were not taken into account in this study, because they are known to be of minor importance to the electrocatalytic performances of CEs and also those of DSCs.

Series resistance (Rs), which shows the overall ohmic resistance of the symmetric cell, is strongly dependent on the electrode–electrode distance in addition to the conductivities of electrocatalysts.6 For this reason, the difference in Rs values was not considered important, except for that between the cells employing ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C. Rs of the symmetric cell employing ZIF-8-dopa-C was significantly smaller than that of the ZIF-8-C-based cell. This was attributable to the difference in their electrical properties; porous carbon materials with larger pore sizes often have superior conductivity due to the thicker interconnecting channels. In addition, it was verified from the XAS analysis (Fig. 4e) that the degree of the sp2 characteristic was larger in ZIF-8-dopa-C compared to the case of ZIF-8-C, and this seems to be another reason for the superior electrical property of ZIF-8-dopa-C.
Charge transfer resistance (Rct) values of the prepared CEs were compared in order to investigate the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Rct value of ZIF-8-dopa-C was the smallest at all temperatures within the measurement range, followed by those of Pt and ZIF-8-C. This result is in line with the previous observations from the CV diagrams and the polarization curves of the symmetric cells, demonstrating the superior electrocatalytic performance of the ZIF-8-dopa-C CEs. Mass transfer characteristics of I3−/I− in the cells employing the Pt, ZIF-8-C, or ZIF-8-dopa-C CEs were then investigated by comparing the diffusion resistance (Rdif) values. Among the three CEs, Pt showed the smallest Rdif, and this could be understood as the result of its non-porous structure. Meanwhile, ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C manifested a substantial difference in the mass transfer of I3−/I−. As previously mentioned, the length of I3− is around 1 nm and is thereby unlikely to travel through the pores in microporous materials, such as ZIF-8-C. On the other hand, mass transfer of I3− in ZIF-8-dopa-C with enlarged pores was significantly enhanced compared to the case of ZIF-8-C, as can be clearly seen from the smaller Rdif values by an order of magnitude.
We additionally carried out capacitance retention measurements for ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C in aqueous solution containing 1.0 M NaCl or NaClO4 in order to elucidate the effect of different pore sizes on the mass transfer properties of the chemical species within the electrolyte. The ionic radii of Na+ and Cl− are known to be 102 pm and 181 pm, respectively, and that of ClO4− is known to be around 240 pm.78 Meanwhile, the hydrated radius of Na+ is 358 pm, while those of Cl− and ClO4− are 332 and 338 pm, respectively.79 The potential window for the capacitance measurement was 0.0 to 0.8 V vs. the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), wherein adsorption and desorption of anions on the electrode surface are responsible for the capacitive currents. Fig. S9 and S10† show the CV diagrams of the ZIF-derived N-doped carbons in NaCl and NaClO4 electrolytes, respectively. From the specific capacitances calculated from the area of the CV curves, we obtained the capacity retentions and summarized them in Fig. 9. The capacitance of ZIF-8-C was around two times larger than that of ZIF-8-dopa-C under slow scan rates, and this observation matched well with the difference in BET surface areas. On the other hand, the retention of capacitance was superior in ZIF-8-dopa-C when compared with that of ZIF-8-C, indicating that the mass transfer limitation is less severe when ZIF-8-dopa-C is used as the CE material. This enhancement is attributable to the enlarged pore size in ZIF-8-dopa-C, which resulted from the incorporation of the polydopamine shell on the surface of ZIF-8 prior to the thermal carbonization. Moreover, since I3− is significantly larger than Cl− and ClO4−, it could be concluded that the influence of different pore sizes of ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C would be more critical to the mass transfer properties of I3−/I− redox species.

Meanwhile, it is noteworthy that ZIF-8-dopa-C manifested similar capacitance retention behaviors in both NaCl and NaClO4 solutions, and this was ascribable to the comparable hydrated radii of Cl− and ClO4−; the difference is less than 2%. On the other hand, the capacity retention of ZIF-8-C was significantly lower in NaClO4 solution when compared with that for the NaCl electrolyte. It was previously reported that the degree of hydration decreases when ions are spatially confined.80 In the same manner, if the concentration of ions is locally too high, overlap between water molecules may occur, leading to a drop in the number of water molecules participating in hydration. When positive potential is applied to the ZIF-derived N-doped carbon electrodes, as in the case of the capacitance retention measurements, the number of anions within the pores increases. If the anions get overcrowded in the pores, the ions will then become incompletely hydrated, and the effective sizes of ions will rather depend on the original size of the ions (i.e., ionic radius). Considering that Cl− and ClO4− have significantly different ionic radii, imperfect hydration of the anions is likely to cause a large difference in the actual size of ions, and this explains the gap in the capacity retention of ZIF-8-C. From this viewpoint, the inferior capacity retention of ZIF-8-C in the NaClO4 electrolyte can be understood as the consequence of small pore sizes that do not provide sufficient space for complete hydration of ions. These observations clearly demonstrate that the transport of chemical species that are larger than few angstroms are strongly hindered by the small pore sizes. Together with the smaller Rdif of ZIF-8-dopa-C compared to the case of ZIF-8-C, the capacity retention measurement results clearly verify that the enhanced electrocatalytic performances are ascribable to the promoted mass transfer, which originates from the enlarged pore sizes. Fig. 10 shows the schematic illustrations of the ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C CEs with significantly different performance in reducing I3− into three I−, which is attributable to the dissimilar pore sizes.

Comparisons of intrinsic activities
EIS analyses of the symmetric cells reveal that the Rct values of Pt and ZIF-8-dopa-C are within a comparable range. Given that ZIF-8-dopa-C has a porous structure with a large surface area, similar Rct values are ascribable to the large number of active sites of the ZIF-derived carbon, which demonstrates the importance of proper nano-architecturing. Meanwhile, in order to further understand the different intrinsic activities of Pt, ZIF-8-C, and ZIF-8-dopa-C, we calculated the activation energy (Ea) for the electrocatalysis of I3−/I−. It is well known that J0 and Rct have the following relationship:75,81 J0 = RT/nFRct(1)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is the Faraday constant, and n is the number of electrons that are transferred during the electrochemical reduction of I3− to three I−. Based on the obtained J0 value, Ea was calculated by using the following Arrhenius equation:60,82 J0 = I0e−Ea/RT(2)where I0 is the exchange current density at infinite T. By plotting the logJ0 values against 1000/T (see Table 1 and Fig. 11), Ea values for Pt, ZIF-8-C, and ZIF-8-dopa-C were approximated to be 31.30, 34.60, and 31.36 kJ mol−1, respectively. Pt showed the smallest Ea, while those of ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C were somewhat larger. As previously mentioned, the higher nitrogen content in the N-doped carbon often leads to a superior catalytic performance by providing active sites with higher intrinsic activity. Meanwhile, Ea of ZIF-8-dopa-C was smaller than that of ZIF-8-C though the N-content of ZIF-8-C was higher. It is widely known that the electrochemical reduction of I3− to I− takes place through the following three-step reactions: I3− → I2 + I−(3) I2 + 2* → 2I*(4) I* + e− → I−(5)where * stands for the free active site on the electrode surface. The first step is known to be fast and in equilibrium, and the other two steps are in charge of the overall rate of I3−/I− redox reactions.73 In general, the activities of electrocatalysts are strongly dependent on the binding energy of the reaction intermediates on the catalyst surface.83,84 According to the reports by Hou et al.82 and Wang et al.,85 electrocatalytic activities of CEs are governed by the adsorption energy of the I atom on the surface, with the optimum at an intermediate binding strength that is neither too weak nor too strong. From this perspective, the binding energy of I on ZIF-8-dopa-C seems to be located near the optimum and catalyze I3− reduction with high intrinsic activity, though Ea cannot be directly correlated with the adsorption energy. Based on these results, we could conclude that the high overall performance of ZIF-8-dopa-C originates not only from the enhanced accessibility that originated from the enhanced mass transfer of I3−/I− redox couples by enlarged pore sizes but also from high catalytic activities per available sites.

As mentioned in the previous paragraphs, the higher N-content in carbonaceous electrocatalysts often leads to superior catalytic performances by providing certain sites with higher intrinsic activity. Meanwhile, Ea of ZIF-8-dopa-C was smaller than that of ZIF-8-C though the N-content of ZIF-8-C was higher. In order to elucidate this unexpected observation, we additionally carried out Raman analyses and the results are displayed in Fig. S11.† The peaks located at the wavenumbers of around 1350 and 1590 cm−1 were assigned to defective carbon (D) and graphitic carbon (G),86 respectively. The signals from sp3 carbons known to appear at approximately 1200 and 1500 cm−1 were not taken into account, because they were hardly distinguishable from the Raman spectra.87,88 The D/G ratios based on the peak intensities were 0.921 for ZIF-8-C and 0.949 for ZIF-8-dopa-C, and the D peak of ZIF-8-C was broader than that of ZIF-8-dopa-C. Since there was no notable difference in the G peaks, it could be concluded that the defect density is higher in ZIF-8-dopa-C than in ZIF-8-C. Given that defect sites are more active than ordered surfaces in carbonaceous electrocatalysts for triiodide reduction,16,18 the larger number of defects in ZIF-8-dopa-C was expected to be one of the reasons for the superior catalytic activity.
Regarding the different intrinsic performances, it was also notable that there was a significant difference in the content of N species in ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C. In various electrochemical reactions, binding energy of a reactant is strongly dependent on the type of the N species, which tailors the electronic structure of the adjacent carbon atoms that usually serve as active sites.70,71,77 In the XPS N 1s data of ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C (in Fig. S5†), the contents of pyridinic N and graphitic N were higher in ZIF-8-dopa-C while its pyrrolic N content was lower than that in ZIF-8-C. Since the XPS results of ZIF-8-dopa-C mainly show responses from the polydopamine-derived shell parts, the different N species cannot serve as the main origin of the different catalytic activity. Nevertheless, there is a possibility that pyridinic and graphitic N engenders the formation of catalytic sites with a higher activity (i.e., a more favorable I adsorption energy) than the case of pyrrolic N, and superior performances of N-doped carbon with high component ratios of pyridinic and graphitic N have been reported.77,89 We believe that further analyses on the different types of N (either by experimental or computational methods) would enable deeper understandings on the N-doped carbon catalysts for triiodide reduction and provide important guidelines for the catalyst design.
Application in mesoscopic solar cells
Finally, ZIF-derived N-doped carbons were applied as electrocatalytic CEs of DSCs employing the I3−/I− redox electrolyte. Mesoscopic photoelectrodes were prepared by doctor-blading and thermal sintering of the colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles on FTO/glass substrates, followed by the adsorption of N719 dyes on the surface. The cell assembly was carried out by using thermoplastic sealants, and the electrolytes were then injected into the cells. Fig. 12a shows the photocurrent density (J)–voltage (V) characteristics of DSCs employing the Pt, ZIF-8-C, or ZIF-8-dopa-C CEs, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. Since all of the photoelectrodes for DSCs were prepared by identical procedures, we did not consider open-circuit voltage (Voc) and short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) values as important indicators. Voc and Jsc mainly show the light harvesting and charge collection characteristic of photoelectrodes, and they do not often show meaningful behaviors with regard to the performances of CEs. On the other hand, the fill factor (FF), which is strongly influenced by the overpotentials in I3− reduction in CEs, showed notable differences. We previously observed from the polarization curves of the symmetric cells (Fig. 7b) that the overpotential of ZIF-8-dopa-C in the electrocatalysis of I3−/I− was smallest, followed by those of Pt and ZIF-8-C. The trend in FF values was also in the order of ZIF-8-dopa-C > Pt > ZIF-8-C. As a result, the power conversion efficiencies of DSCs employing the ZIF-8-dopa-C CEs (8.95 ± 0.10%) were significantly higher than those of DSCs with the ZIF-8-C CEs (8.26 ± 0.10%) or Pt CEs (8.76 ± 0.13%), with the champion performance of 9.03%. This value was among the state-of-the-art results from the DSCs with carbon-based electrocatalytic CEs, as can be seen from the comparisons with the values reported in previous publications displayed in Table S3.†Fig. 12b shows the incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of the DSCs employing Pt or ZIF-derived N-doped carbons, from which we could verify that the spectral responses are comparable for the DSCs regardless of the CEs. This matched well with the J–V results and also clearly showed that the difference in the photovoltaic performances originated from the diverse electrocatalytic performances of the CEs and not from the photoelectrodes, which were identical in all of the prepared DSCs.

Additionally, we carried out J–V measurements on DSCs employing the ZIF-derived N-doped carbon CEs using a cobalt bipyridine ([Co(bpy)3]3+/2+) redox electrolyte, in order to investigate the performances of the porosity-tailored carbons when larger-sized redox species are utilized. As can be seen from Table S4 and Fig. S12,† ZIF-8-dopa-C in place of Pt induced a dramatic drop in performance, and the performance was even lower when ZIF-8-C was used as the CE. These results were attributable to the poorer mass transfer of bulky [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox couples when compared with I3−/I− species, indicating that further increase in pore sizes is essential for chemical species that are significantly larger than I3−. This observation clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach and also emphasizes the importance of tailoring the pore sizes in accordance with the chemical species taking part in the targeted reactions.
Conclusions
In this study, porous N-doped carbons were prepared by thermal carbonization of ZIF-8 and were applied as electrocatalysts in DSCs. In order to resolve the significant mass transfer resistance of the I3−/I− redox electrolyte in ZIF-8-derived carbon materials, we increased the pore sizes by incorporation of the polydopamine shell on the surface of ZIF-8 prior to the thermal carbonization. This additional layer elongated the dwelling time of Zn within ZIF-8 and increased the size of pores in the resulting carbon materials. The N-doped carbon with augmented pore sizes manifested significantly enhanced electrocatalytic performances, which led to a superior energy conversion efficiency to the case of the state-of-the-art Pt counterpart, with the champion value exceeding 9%. Considering the reliability and robustness of the methods used in this study, these results and observations are even more promising. Moreover, since the approaches in this study give a simple route to control the pore sizes of carbonized MOFs, which are useful in various catalytic applications, the investigations performed here are anticipated to provide important insights into and profound understandings on the design of MOF-based functional materials.
Experimental
Preparation of CEs employing ZIF-8-C or ZIF-8-dopa-C
The ZIF-8 used in this study was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Basolite® Z1200). Polydopamine coating was carried out in a buffer solution (pH 8.5) containing 10 mM dopamine hydrochloride (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h with mild stirring. ZIF-8 and ZIF-8-dopa were thermally carbonized in an Ar-filled tube at 800 °C for 2 h, followed by acid treatment to remove the remaining Zn within the prepared ZIF-8-C and ZIF-8-dopa-C. These carbons were deposited on FTO glasses (TEC-8, Pilkington) by spraying them in the form of ink, wherein isopropanol and Nafion were used as the solvent and the binder, respectively, followed by heat treatment at 500 °C in Ar for 4 h to improve the connectivity between the carbon particles. The amount of Nafion binder in the catalyst ink was 1/10 of the ZIF-derived N-doped carbon by weight. Electrodes for capacitance retention measurements were fabricated by blending ZIF-derived N-doped carbons, carbon black conducting agent (Timcal), and polytetrafluoroethylene binder (Sigma-Aldrich) in a mass ratio of 8:1:1. Then, the mixture was kneaded in a pestle, pressed in a roll press machine, and dried in a vacuum oven. Platinum CEs were prepared by spin-casting of isopropanol containing 50 mM H2PtCl6 on FTO glasses, followed by heat treatment at 400 °C for 20 min in air.
Assemblies of symmetric cells and mesoscopic solar cells
Symmetric cells were assembled using identical CEs with the assistance of 50 μm-thick thermoplastic sealants (Surlyn, Dupont), and the I3−/I− redox electrolyte prepared by mixing 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 30 mM I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixed solution of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v = 85:15) was injected into the cells through pre-drilled holes. Mesoscopic TiO2 photoelectrodes for DSCs were prepared by sequentially doctor-blading commercial pastes containing colloidal TiO2 nanoparticles (DSL 18NR-T, Dyesol) and scattering particles (WER2-O, Dyesol) onto FTO glass substrates coated with a TiO2 blocking layer. The photoelectrodes underwent thermal sintering at 500 °C in air for 30 min and TiCl4 post-treatment to increase the surface area and enhance the electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band.90 Dye sensitization was carried out by immersing the TiO2 electrodes into ethanolic solution of 0.5 mM N719 sensitizer (D719, Everlight Chemicals) at 30 °C for 48 h. DSCs were prepared by assembling a photoelectrode and a counter electrode, followed by the injection of an electrolyte using the same method as for the preparation of symmetric cells. For the preparation of DSCs employing the [Co(bpy)3]3+/2+ redox electrolyte, Y123 dye (DN-F05Y, Dyenamo) was used as the sensitizer, and an acetonitrile solution containing 0.22 M Co(bpy)3(PF6)2 (DN-C01, Dyenamo), 0.033 M Co(bpy)3(PF6)3 (DN-C02, Dyenamo), 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine was used as the electrolyte.
Materials characterizations and (photo)electrochemical measurements
SEM and TEM analyses were carried out using a Carl Zeiss AURIGA and an FEI Tecnai F20, respectively. N2 sorption experiments were performed using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020. XRD patterns were obtained using a Rigaku D-MAX2500-PC equipped with a Cu-Kα radiation source, and XPS spectra were measured using a Thermo SIGMA PROBE with an Al-Kα source. XAS analysis was carried out at the 4D beamline of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL) in Republic of Korea. TGA measurements were carried out using a SDT-Q600 (TA Instruments). Raman spectra were collected using a Horiba Jobin-Yvon LabRam Aramis spectrometer, where the 514 nm line of an Ar-ion laser was used as the excitation source. CV analyses were carried out by using a potentiostat (Autolab PGSTAT, Metrohm). A graphite rod CE, a Ag/AgNO3 reference electrolyte counter electrode, and an acetonitrile electrolyte containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 were used for the CV measurements. EIS measurements were carried out by using a ZIVE MP1 with sinusoidal perturbations of 10 mV. The capacitance retention measurements were conducted by using a potentiostat (VersaSTAT3, Princeton Applied Research) in a three electrode configuration based on an activated carbon-based CE, a Ag/AgCl (sat. KCl) reference electrode, and a cellulose nitrate membrane separator. Photovoltaic performances of the prepared DSCs were evaluated under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (light intensity: 100 mW cm−2) by using a solar simulator (XIL model 05A50KS source measure units), and the J–V data were collected by using a potentiostat (1480 Multistat, Solartron). IPCE measurements were carried out using a QEX7 device (PV Measurements).
