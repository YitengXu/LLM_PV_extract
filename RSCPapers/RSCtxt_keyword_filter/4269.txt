    , Accepted 16th October 2019First published on 16th October 2019AbstractThe high recombination efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers is the primary factor suppressing the photocatalytic performance of polymeric carbon nitride (CN). To enhance the charge separation, Sb-doped CN (CN/Sb) was firstly synthesized using antimonate as a doping and oxidizing agent. The N–SbIII bond was fabricated in CN/Sb via a redox process, which works as a charge-capture center, evidenced by experimental and theoretical calculation methods, and leads to a prominent enhancement in the charge separation and transfer performance of CN/Sb. CN/Sb exhibits much higher photocatalytic activity than CN in water splitting and environmental remediation. The visible-light photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of CN/Sb can reach ∼1.75 mmol g−1 h−1, which is ∼4.5 times that of CN, with an apparent quantum yield of 6.4% at 420 nm. Reactive oxygen species generation rates of CN/Sb are also much higher than those of CN. This work provides not only a new effective way for CN modification but also a deep insight into the metal-doping structure in the CN framework, which can guide future research on metal-doped CN photocatalysts.
Introduction
Polymeric carbon nitride (CN) has drawn much interest from scientists because it can be used as a stable non-toxic visible-light-responsive photocatalyst in the solar energy conversion for water splitting, CO2 reduction, environmental remediation, etc.1–4 Unfortunately, some drawbacks of CN seriously suppress its photocatalytic performance and limit its industrial application, such as low conductivity and specific surface area,2,5 narrow photoabsorption range,6 and high recombination efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers.7
Many strategies have been employed to improve the photocatalytic activity of CN, such as heterojunction construction,8,9 structural modification,10 mesopore introduction,11 copolymerization,12,13 and elemental doping.14,15 Among these, elemental doping has been paid great attention because it can enhance the charge separation efficiency and photoabsorption simultaneously, sometimes with increased specific surface areas.15,16 Doping of CN is a process of introducing other elements or impurities into the CN framework to prominently tune the electronic, optical, and other physical properties of CN via changing its energy band structure1 and can be classified into nonmetal and metal doping. Most nonmetal elements (e.g., B, C, N, O, S, P and halogens)16 have been successfully used to dope CN. Doping ways and doping-induced changes of properties and performance of the photocatalysts have been well reviewed.1,16 The metal doping strategy also drew much attention from scientists because metal functionalization can effectively adjust the spectroscopic characteristics of organometallic complexes,17–19 and many metal ions were used to dope CN with photoactivity enhancement. However, the metal doping of CN still needs to be further researched because there are so many kinds of metal elements with various valences (reducibility or oxidizability), which may endow CN with unexpected properties and performance.
Introduction of metal ions into the CN framework can not only enhance the photoabsorption20 and charge separation14 but also create new catalytic active centers,14 which can significantly improve the photocatalytic performance. Traditional metal-doping ways mainly include two types. One is calcination of mixtures comprising raw materials of CN (e.g. urea and melamine) and low-valent metal salts (e.g. CoCl2 and NaCl) at ∼450–650 °C (ref. 1, 20 and 21) and the other is impregnation of CN in low-valent metal salt solutions.22,23 These two ways can only realize the doping of some metal elements (e.g. Fe, Co, Cu, Mn, Ce, Na and K)16,20 in CN. More strategies need be exploited to realize the doping of more metal elements and achieve more efficient CN-based photocatalysts. For example, Al-doped CN was successfully prepared through introduction of a bidentate type of metal coordination site in CN to fix Al ions and exhibits considerably increased photoactivity.18
According to the framework structure of CN composed of C, N and H atoms, the N atoms more probably interact with metal ions. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), there are three kinds of interacting sites, i.e. N–C3, N–C2, and N–H. Coordination interactions of N–C2 with metal ions (Fig. S2, ESI†) dominate in reported work.16 Several papers refer to coordination interactions between N–C3 and metal ions,1,24 but to our best knowledge, interactions of N–H (simply denoted as NH) with metal ions or fabrication of NH–metal bonds are still rarely reported, even though these interactions may endow excellent performance to the samples. Recently, we adopted a high-valent metal salt oxidation strategy to successfully synthesize Mn-doped CN with the stable NH–Mn bond formed, which exhibits prominently enhanced photocatalytic performance.25 However, the adaptability of this method for the synthesis of other metal-doped CN remains to be probed.
Antimony (Sb) has been successfully used as a dopant in SnO2,26 TiO2,27 ZnO,28 and Bi2O2CO3 (ref. 29) for photocatalytic solar energy conversion. For these photocatalysts, SbIII compounds are used as the Sb sources and the SbIII doping can narrow the bandgap,26 increase the photoabsorption,26,27 and increase the charge separation efficiency,26 which leads to significant improvement of photoactivity. However, there has not been any report on the doping of Sb in organic semiconductor photocatalysts like CN.
In this work, Sb-doped CN was firstly synthesized by a high-valent metal salt (NaSbO3) oxidation strategy, and the NH–SbIII bond was fabricated and works as a charge-capture center. The Sb-doped CN exhibits prominent enhancement in charge separation and photocatalytic performance. This work not only provides a new way to modify CN but also explicitly expounds the metal-doping mechanism in the CN framework, which can direct the preparation of other metal-doped CN photocatalysts.
Experimental
Materials
Urea (99.0%), urea-15N (98.5%) with 15N abundance of 10%, NaSbO3 (99.5%), NaCl (99.5%), rhodamine B (RhB, 99.0%), salicylic acid (99%), triethanolamine (99.5%), K3Fe(CN)6 (99.95%), K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O (99.99%), and 5,5′-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO, 97%) were bought from Aladdin (China). 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP, 99%) and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS, 1.3 wt% in H2O) were purchased from Sigma. All the chemicals were used as received.
Preparation of Sb-doped CN
Ten grams of urea and 5–15 mg of NaSbO3 were dissolved in 10 mL of H2O, after which the aqueous solution was evaporated at 80 °C under stirring until completely dried. The solid was further dried at 60 °C for 24 h in an oven. Afterwards, the dried sample was put in a crucible with a lid and heated at 550 °C for 4 h in a N2 atmosphere with a temperature ramp of 5 °C min−1. After cooling naturally to room temperature, the sample was dispersed in 200 mL of H2O and stirred for 24 h. The final product was obtained after filtration, washing with water and drying at 60 °C for 24 h. The as-prepared sample was denoted as CN/Sb-n, where n (mg) is the mass of the used NaSbO3. For comparison, pure CN was prepared via a similar process without the addition of NaSbO3. NaCl (3.0 mg) was substituted for NaSbO3 to synthesize a Na-doped CN sample, denoted as CN/Na. It should be noted that 3.0 mg of NaCl contains as many Na+ ions as 10 mg of NaSbO3. For 15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tests, homogeneously mixed urea-15N and urea with a mass ratio of 1 are used as the raw materials for sample preparation.
Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were measured on a PAN Analytical X'Pert3 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å), and the accelerating voltage and current are 40 kV and 40 mA, respectively. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was carried out on a Thermo Scientific Escalab 250Xi spectrometer (UK) with Al Kα radiation. Peak positions were calibrated by the C 1s peak at 284.8 eV. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) of samples were tested on the same instrument with He I (21.22 eV) as the excitation source and an applied bias voltage of −8 eV. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) measurement for the Sb K-edge was performed in the fluorescence mode on beamline 20-BM-B with an electron energy of 7 GeV and an average current of 100 mA which is located in the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Laboratory (USA). The radiation was monochromatized using a Si (111) double-crystal monochromator. The data were processed by Athena software. The morphologies of the samples were observed on a Zeiss Supra55 field emission-scanning electron microscope (SEM, Germany) and a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission electron microscope (TEM, Japan). An energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) equipped in the SEM instrument was used to do the elemental mapping analysis. Selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns were tested on the TEM. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was conducted on a UH-4150 spectrophotometer (Hitachi, Japan). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured using a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer (Japan) at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and excitation and emission slit widths of 5 and 7 nm, respectively. Time-resolved fluorescence decay spectra were recorded on an FLS920 time-resolved spectrofluorometer (Edinburgh Analytical Instruments, UK), with excitation and monitoring wavelengths of 375 and 460 nm, respectively. N2 sorption isotherms were measured on a Micromeritics TriStar II 3020 instrument (USA) at liquid nitrogen temperature. Samples were degassed at 150 °C for 3 h under vacuum before measurement. Solid-state 15N NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker AVANCE III 400 WB spectrometer with α-glycine as the reference substance. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were tested on a Bruker Tensor 27 spectrophotometer. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy was performed on a Bruker A300-1012 spectrometer at room temperature. To detect singlet oxygen (1O2), hydroxyl radicals (˙OH), and superoxide radicals (˙O2−), TEMP, DMPO, and DMPO in methanol were used as in situ trapping agents, respectively. A 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm, Ceaulight, China) was used as the light source for irradiation tests. The irradiation time for ˙OH and ˙O2− tests is 10 min and for 1O2 is 30 s. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) (PerkinElmer NexION™ 350X, USA) was conducted to test the metal ion concentration in the solution.
Photoelectrochemical tests
All of the photoelectrochemical tests were carried out on a CHI660E electrochemical work station (Chenhua, China) with a standard three-electrode system soaked in a 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution. Ag/AgCl and Pt wire were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively. The working electrodes were prepared by coating sample slurries onto clean ITO glass followed by drying at 60 °C for 24 h and calcination at 200 °C for 2 h in a N2 atmosphere. The slurries were obtained by grinding mixtures of 0.01 g of samples, 40 μL of PEDOT-PSS and 400 μL of H2O. A 300 W xenon lamp (CEL-HXF300, Ceaulight) with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm, CEL-UVIRCUT420, Ceaulight) was used as the light source for all the photoelectrochemical tests. The open-circuit potential (Voc) transients were measured without an external applied bias. For photocurrent density and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests, the applied bias is 0.4 V. The electrochemical impedance tests in the dark and under light irradiation were performed in a frequency range of 0.1 to 105 Hz with an AC voltage amplitude of 5 mV, and 0.1 M KCl solution containing 2.5 mM K3Fe(CN)6 and 2.5 mM K4Fe(CN)6 was substituted for the 0.2 M Na2SO4 solution.
Photocatalytic performance measurement
For each photocatalytic hydrogen evolution (PHE) experiment, 20 mg of the sample was dispersed in 80 ml of aqueous solution containing 10 vol% triethanolamine (TEOA). After sonication for 10 min, the solution was transferred to a reaction cell, with 1595 μL of H2PtCl6 solution (1 g L−1) dropped in (the mass ratio of Pt to the sample is 3 wt%). The reaction cell was vacuumized under stirring, after which Pt was in situ photodeposited onto the catalyst surface under irradiation of a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF300, Ceaulight) for 1 h. Then, the reaction cell was vacuumized again, and the 300 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm, CEL-UVIRCUT420, Ceaulight) was used as the visible light source for the hydrogen evolution reaction. The amount of generated hydrogen was monitored by gas chromatography (Beifen-Ruili: SP-2100, MS-5 Å column, TCD) with ultrapure Ar as the carrier gas.
To measure the apparent quantum yield (AQY), the above-mentioned CEL-UVIRCUT420 cutoff filter was replaced with a Thorlabs FB400-10 (λ = 400 ± 2 nm), FB420-10 (λ = 420 ± 2 nm) or FB-450-10 (λ = 450 ± 2 nm) band-pass filter. The average irradiation intensity (E) of the obtained monochromatic light was measured using an optical power meter (CEL-NP2000, Ceaulight). The irradiation area (A) is 3.46 cm2. Then, the AQY was calculated according to the equation AQY = (2hcNA·rH)/(EAλ) × 100%, where h, c, NA, and rH, are the Planck constant, the light rate, the Avogadro constant, and the H2 evolution rate (mol s−1), respectively.
Photodegradation experiments were performed on an XPA-7 photocatalytic reaction apparatus (Xujiang Electromechanical Plant, Nanjing, China) at the temperature of <35 °C. A 500 W Xe lamp with a cutoff filter (λ ≥ 420 nm) was used as the visible light source. For each run, 0.02 g of the sample was added to 50 mL of 10 mg L−1 RhB or 20 mg L−1 salicylic acid solution. Then, the suspension was stirred in the dark for 1 h to ensure sorption equilibrium. After the light was turned on, ∼4 mL of the suspension was taken out at every interval and analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 8453 UV-vis spectrophotometer (USA) at 554 nm for RhB or 296 nm for salicylic acid.
Theoretical calculation
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).30 The exchange–correlation interaction is described by generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.31 To better describe non-bonding interactions, Grimme's scheme van der Waals correction was utilized.32 The energy cutoff is set to 500 eV, and the Brillouin zone is sampled using a Monkhorst–Pack 7 × 6 × 4 K-point grid.1,33 For all the calculations, the convergence criteria for the electronic and ionic relaxation are 10−5 eV and 0.02 eV Å−1, respectively.
Results and discussion
Determination of structure and composition

Fig. 1a shows the XRD patterns of CN and CN/Sb-n. Two main peaks at ∼12.8° and ∼27.1° for CN are assigned to the (100) and (002) crystal facets, corresponding to in-plane packing of tri-s-triazine units and interlayer stacking of nanosheets, respectively.34 Similarly, these two peaks are observed for CN/Sb-n, but additional small peaks appear in the pattern of CN/Sb-15, which can be indexed to Sb2O3 with a cubic phase structure (JCPDS file no. 43-1071), indicating that a high amount of NaSbO3 is apt to form Sb2O3. Enlarged XRD patterns of CN, CN/Sb-5, and CN/Sb-10 show similar (002) peak positions, indicative of their similar interlayer distance, but the (002) peak of CN/Sb-15 remarkably shifts, owing to superposition with the (222) peak of Sb2O3 (Fig. 1a). CN/Na shows similar diffraction peaks to those of CN (Fig. S3, ESI†).
 Fig. 1  (a) XRD patterns and (b) Sb 3d and (c) N 1s core-level XPS spectra of samples. 
XPS was performed to investigate the composition and bonding structures of the samples. Fig. 1b shows the Sb 3d core-level XPS spectra of the samples. For CN, only one peak at the binding energy (BE) of ∼532.1 eV is observed, which is actually the O 1s peak.3 For CN/Sb-5 and CN/Sb-10, besides the O 1s peak, two peaks at BEs of ∼539.9 and ∼530.6 eV can be gained by deconvolution, which are separately assigned to 3d3/2 and 3d5/2 of Sb atoms probably in N–Sb bonds,35 indicating the successful Sb doping. These two peaks for CN/Sb-15 shift ∼0.2 eV (Fig. 1b) because of the formation of Sb2O3.

Fig. 1c shows the N 1s core-level XPS spectra of the samples. Peaks at BEs of 398.7, 400.0, 401.2, and 404.3 eV for CN are assigned to N atoms in CN–C, N–C3, and N–H bonds and the charge effect of heterocycles, respectively.3 The CN–C and N–H peak positions of CN/Sb-n are similar to those of CN, but their N–C3 peaks shift to a low BE. This shift probably results from formation of the NH–Sb bond whose peak is located slightly on the right of but superimposed with the N–C3 peak. The shift distance of N–C3 peaks for CN/Sb-n increases then decreases with increasing n, and CN/Sb-10 exhibits the most prominent shift (Fig. 1c). The increase of shift distance indicates increased NH–Sb bonds in CN/Sb-n and the subsequent decrease arises from reduced NH–Sb bonds because of the formation of Sb2O3. Therefore, CN/Sb-10 possesses the most NH–Sb bonds or the highest Sb doping concentration. This peak shift distance variation from CN to CN/Sb-15 also demonstrates that Sb2O3 is not formed in CN/Sb-5 and CN/Sb-10. Otherwise, the shift distance with increasing n should have changed monotonically or not changed. The N 1s spectra also indicate that the Sb ions in CN/Sb-10 are not fixed in the ring cavities of nanosheets through coordination interactions with N atoms in the CN–C bonds, because if so, the CN–C peak of CN/Sb-10 should have shifted to high BE compared with that of CN, as shown by K, Fe, or Pd doped CN.1,22,36
The C 1s core-level XPS spectra of CN and CN/Sb-n are similar (Fig. S4, ESI†), suggesting a negligible influence of the Sb doping on the electron density around C atoms or there are no direct interactions between C and Sb atoms in CN/Sb-n. The Na 1s core-level XPS spectra of CN/Sb-n reveal residual Na+ ions in the samples (Fig. S5, ESI†), but the influence of Na+ ions on the N 1s core-level spectra is negligible, because for CN/Na with Na+ ion doping (Fig. S6, ESI†), its N 1s spectrum, different from that of CN/Sb-10 (Fig. 1c), shows no shift of the N–C3 peak relative to that of CN (Fig. S7, ESI†).
FT-IR spectroscopy was performed to further characterize the bonding structures of the samples. Overall, the spectra of CN/Sb-n and CN show similar absorption bands (Fig. S8, ESI†). Enlarged absorption bands at 1443–1720 and 1120–1443 cm−1 are ascribed to ν(CN) and ν(C–N), respectively,37 as shown in Fig. 2a. Compared with the absorption band of CN at 1416 cm−1, those of CN/Sb-n exhibit a slight redshift because of formation of the C–NH–Sb bond which increases the electron density around N atoms and prolongs the C–N bonds.25 The redshift distance for CN/Sb-n first increases and then decreases with increasing n, and CN/Sb-10 exhibits the most prominent redshift, indicating the highest Sb doping concentration in it. This absorption band redshift variation of CN/Sb-n also verifies that Sb2O3 is not formed in CN/Sb-5 and CN/Sb-10, which accords well with the XPS results. The influence of residual Na+ ions is also negligible because the absorption peak redshift is not observed for CN/Na (Fig. S9, ESI†).

15N NMR spectra of CN and CN/Sb-10 were also tested to verify their structures. As shown in Fig. 2b, the chemical shifts at 196.8 and 188.9 ppm, 152.4 ppm, 132.7 ppm, and 113.1, 103.2 and 89.6 ppm are assigned to N atoms in CN–C bonds, N–C3 bonds, HN–C2 bonds and –NH2 groups at different positions, respectively.38 For CN/Sb-10, the chemical shifts of the –NH2 peaks decrease by 1.1, 2.9, and 2.5 ppm, respectively, with those of other peaks hardly changing compared with the chemical shifts of the corresponding peaks for CN. The shift of the –NH2 peaks arises from formation of the C–NH–Sb bond whose NMR peak is located on the right of but superimposed with the –NH2 peaks (N-6, inset in Fig. 2b).
Sb K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra were measured to confirm the oxidation state of Sb in CN/Sb-10. As shown in Fig. 3a, the peak position in the spectrum of CN/Sb-10 is similar to that of SbIII2O3 and quite different from those of NaSbVO3 and Sb0 foil (indicated by the vertical line), demonstrating that the Sb ions in CN/Sb-10 are three-valent. The similar height of normalized white lines39 for CN/Sb-10 and Sb2O3 (∼1.28), which are separately smaller and greater than that of NaSbO3 and Sb foil (∼1.40 and 1.04), also indicates the presence of SbIII in CN/Sb-10. On the whole, the Sb-doped CN was synthesized through a high-valent metal salt oxidation strategy with the NH–SbIII bond fabricated (eqn (S1)†).
 Fig. 3  (a) X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra and (b) schematic framework structure of Sb-doped CN. 
Based on the above analyses, the probable framework structure of Sb-doped CN is shown in Fig. 3b. The C–NH–Sb bond is fabricated and may be located at the edge of the nanosheet, which causes no obvious change of the crystal structure (see the XRD results).
According to the XPS data of CN and CN/Sb-n, their N/C molar ratios are ∼1.37, as shown in Table 1. The Sb contents in CN/Sb-5, CN/Sb-10, and CN/Sb-15 are ca. 0.70, 0.76, and 0.83 wt%, respectively. The molar contents of N–H bonds in N-containing bonds for CN and CN/Sb-n are 6.5–8.1% and increase then decrease with increasing n. CN/Sb-10 possesses the highest content. This suggests that the Sb doping process forms more –NHx groups.

Morphologies and properties
The morphologies of the samples were observed by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, CN/Sb-10 is composed of aggregated nanosheets with large pores formed. Similar morphologies are observed for CN and CN/Sb-15 (Fig. S10, ESI†). The SAED image of CN/Sb-10 shows a clear diffraction ring corresponding to the (002) facet (inset in Fig. 4b), and similar SAED results were obtained for CN and CN/Sb-15 (Fig. S11, ESI†), indicating that the Sb doping basically does not destroy the crystal structure of the CN framework, in accordance with the XRD results. The high-resolution TEM image of CN/Sb-15 shows the existence of small Sb2O3 particles (Fig. S12, ESI†), which, however, were not observed for CN/Sb-10, consistent with the XRD and XPS results. Fig. 4c shows EDS elemental mapping images of CN/Sb-10. Homogeneous distribution of Sb ions in the sample can be distinctly observed, further indicating the successful Sb doping. The O element comes from surficial adsorbed hydroxyl species.3
 Fig. 4  (a) SEM, (b) TEM, and (c) EDS elemental mapping images of CN/Sb-10. The inset in (b) is a SAED pattern. Scale bar in (c): 5 μm. 
The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of CN and CN/Sb-n show typical type IV isotherms featured with type H3 hysteresis loops (Fig. S13a, ESI†), indicating the existence of slit-like mesopores.40 Their pore-size distribution curves show a similar mesoporous size of ∼2.5 nm (Fig. S13b†). With increasing n, the specific surface areas and porous volumes of these samples gradually increase from 41.0 to 62.5 m2 g−1 and from 0.159 to 0.363 cm3 g−1, respectively (Table 1). UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the samples were measured to compare the photoabsorption performance of the samples (Fig. S14, ESI†). CN/Sb-n exhibits slightly higher visible light absorption than CN because of the Sb doping. The bandgap of CN/Sb-10 (2.73 eV) is a little smaller than that of CN (2.76 eV) (Table 1 and Fig. S14†).
To confirm the energy band levels of the samples, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was performed. As shown in Fig. 5a, the Fermi edge (EFm) and the secondary electron cutoff edge (Ec) of CN/Sb-10 are 2.61 and 17.54 eV, respectively. Then, its valence band (VB) maximum (EVBM = hν − Ec + EFm)41 is calculated to be 6.29 eV, where hv (21.22 eV) is the incoming photon energy from the He I source. Because the electrochemical potential, 0 V (vs. NHE), corresponds to the energy level, −4.44 eV (vs. vacuum level),41 the electrochemical potential of EVBM of CN/Sb-10 is calculated to be 1.85 V (vs. NHE). Similarly, EVBM of CN is determined as 1.80 V (Fig. S15, ESI†). Then, the conduction band (CB) minimum (ECBM = EVBM − Eg) of CN/Sb-10 and CN is calculated to be −0.88 and −0.95 V, respectively. The VB-XPS spectra of the samples were measured to confirm the energy (or potential) difference between EVBM and the Fermi level (Ef). As shown in Fig. 5b, there is only one linear part in the spectrum of CN, corresponding to (EVBM − Ef) of 2.44 eV. Then, Ef of CN is determined as −0.64 V. Intriguingly, there are distinctly two linear parts in the spectrum of CN/Sn-10. One corresponds to (EVBM − Ef) of 2.55 eV, i.e., Ef of CN/Sn-10 is −0.70 V. The other corresponds to an intercept of 2.25 eV, indicating the existence of an impurity level (EN) in the bandgap.42–44 The potential difference between EN and EVBM is 0.30 V (2.55–2.25 V). Thus, EN is 1.55 V, close to the VB edge.

The energy band levels of CN and CN/Sb-10 are shown in Fig. 5c. The Sb doping induces a downward shift of ECBM and EVBM but an upward shift of Ef. For CN/Sb-10, the EN can accept photogenerated holes coming from the VB edge and thus substantially increase the charge separation efficiency.
DFT calculation was done to further confirm the energy band structures of the samples. Fig. 6a shows the optimized geometric structures of CN and Sb-doped CN. Stable NH–Sb bonds can be fabricated, simultaneously with coordination interactions occurring between Sb ions and adjacent N atoms (as shown by dotted bonds). Fig. 6b shows the density of states (DOS) plots of the samples. There is indeed an impurity level (EN) above EVBM, consistent with the experimental results. EN is mainly contributed by the N 2p orbital, which should be induced by the NH–Sb bond. Furthermore, there is another impurity level below ECBM (ES), which is contributed corporately by Sb 5p, C2p, and N 2p orbitals. ES can accept photoelectrons arriving from the CB edge (Fig. 5c), further enhancing the charge separation. It should be noted that the Sb content in the theoretical model (Fig. 6a) is much higher than that in CN/Sb-10.

Charge separation and transfer performance
To determine the decisive factor for photocatalytic performance, the charge separation and transfer efficiencies of the samples were well investigated. Fig. 7a shows the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CN and CN/Sb-n. The PL intensities of CN/Sb-n decrease then increase with increasing n, and CN/Sb-10 exhibits the lowest intensity. Lowered PL intensity generally indicates a decreased charge recombination efficiency.45 The PL intensity of CN/Sb-15 approaching that of CN reveals that the formed Sb2O3 is much less effective than the Sb doping in enhancing the charge separation. Fig. 7b shows the time-resolved fluorescence spectra of CN and CN/Sb-10. Distinctly, the curve of CN/Sb-10 decays more slowly than that of CN. The decay curves can be well described by a tri-exponential model, I(t) = C1·exp(−t/τ1) + C2·exp(−t/τ2) + C3·exp(−t/τ3), where I, τ1–τ3 and C1–C3 are the intensity, the fluorescence lifetimes and the amplitudes of the corresponding components, respectively.46 The τ1–τ3 values of CN/Sb-10 are all longer than those of CN, as shown in the table in Fig. 7b. Nonetheless, C1–C3 of CN/Sb-10 somewhat differs from those of CN. To exclude the influence of this difference on the lifetimes, the average lifetimes (τm) of the samples were calculated via the equation τm = (a1·τ12 + a2·τ22 + a3·τ32)/(a1·τ1 + a2·τ2 + a3·τ3), where a1–a3 are the amplitudes of corresponding lifetimes.46 The τm (33.49 s) of CN/Sb-10 is still longer than that of CN (27.06 s). The prolonged fluorescence lifetimes for CN/Sb-10 indicate the decreased charge recombination efficiency.47
 Fig. 7  (a) Photoluminescence spectra and (b) time-resolved fluorescence spectra of samples. The table in (b) shows the results of fitting the decay curves to a tri-exponential model. 
Photoelectrochemical tests were done to further evaluate the charge separation performance of the samples. As shown in Fig. 8a, the photocurrent response of CN/Sb-n first becomes stronger and then weaker with increasing n, and CN/Sb-10 exhibits the strongest response, indicative of faster charge separation47 for CN/Sb-10 than for CN, which is consistent with the PL results. The decay profiles of open circuit potentials (Vocs) can reflect the surficial charge recombination rates of samples. As shown in Fig. 8b, the average charge recombination rates are determined via the equation (V − Vlight)(Vdark − Vlight)−1 = 1 − exp(−kr·t), where V, Vlight, and Vdark are Voc at any time, under light irradiation, and in the dark, respectively, and kr is the pseudo-first-order recombination rate constant.48 CN/Sb-10 exhibits a smaller kr (0.131 s−1) than CN (0.148 s−1) (inset in Fig. 8b), indicating a decreased charge recombination efficiency for CN/Sb-10. Electrochemical impedance spectra were tested to characterize the charge transfer performance of the samples. Smaller semicircular Nyquist plot radii generally suggest higher charge transfer performance.49,50 As shown in Fig. 8c, CN/Sb-10 shows smaller Nyquist plot radii than CN both in the dark and under light irradiation, demonstrating a higher charge transfer efficiency for CN/Sb-10.

Room-temperature EPR spectroscopy was performed to characterize the electronic structure of the samples (Fig. S16, ESI†). The EPR spectra of both CN and CN/Sb-10 show one single Lorentzian line centered at the g value of 2.003, corresponding to unpaired electrons in sp2-carbon in typical heptazine of CN.51 The slightly higher peak intensity of CN/Sb-10 than that of CN indicates increased unpaired electron density or electron delocalization51 owing to the Sb doping, which may benefit from electrons in 5s orbitals of SbIII. The increase in electron delocalization is favorable for charge transfer. Overall, the Sb doping remarkably enhances the charge separation and transfer efficiencies, which promises the improvement of photocatalytic performance.
Photocatalytic activity
The PHE rates of the samples were evaluated under visible light irradiation with Pt as the cocatalyst. As shown in Fig. 9a, the PHE rates of CN/Sb-n increase then decrease with increasing n and CN/Sb-10 exhibits the highest rate, ∼1.75 mmol g−1 h−1, which is ∼4.5 times that of CN and is comparable to those of most reported metal-doped CN photocatalysts (Table S1, ESI†). Without Pt, neither CN nor CN/Sb-10 exhibits detectable activity for PHE (Fig. 9a). The AQYs of CN/Sb-10 at 400, 420, and 450 nm are 11.8%, 6.4%, and 0.8%, respectively, and the change of AQYs with increasing wavelength basically accords with the variation of UV-vis absorption of the sample (Fig. 9b), suggesting the great importance of the optical absorption capability of photocatalysts.

Numbers in (a), (c), and (d) are hydrogen evolution rates, pseudo-first-order kinetics rate constants, and pseudo-zero-order kinetics rate constants, respectively. 
The photocatalytic activity of the samples for environmental remediation was also assessed. As shown in Fig. 9c, the photodegradation efficiencies of the model pollutant RhB on CN/Sb-n show similar variation to the PHE rates with increasing n. The pseudo-first-order kinetics rate constant (k) (Table S2, ESI†) of CN/Sb-10 is ∼2.6 times that of CN (Fig. 9c). Photodegradation of colorless salicylic acid on the samples was also investigated (Fig. 9d). CN/Sb-10 still shows the highest photoactivity. The pseudo-zero-order kinetics rate constant (k0) (Table S2†) of CN/Sb-10 for salicylic acid degradation is ∼1.44 times that of CN (Fig. 9d).
RhB photodegradation on CN/Na is much slower than that on CN/Sb-10 (Fig. S17, ESI†), indicating the negligible influence of residual Na+ ions on the photocatalytic performance of CN/Sb-10. We also substituted Sb2O3 and SbCl3 for NaSbO3 to synthesize the photocatalysts, CN–Sb2O3 and CN–SbCl3, via a similar route to the synthesis of CN/Sb-10 (S1, ESI†), and found that the photocatalytic activity of CN–Sb2O3 and CN–SbCl3 is much lower than that of CN/Sb-10 (Fig. S18, ESI†), which manifests that the redox reaction (eqn (S1)†) is necessary for effective doping of Sb in CN or that the high-valent metal salt oxidation strategy is superior to the traditional low-valent metal doping method.
Cyclic experiments on photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and RhB degradation for CN/Sb-10 are shown in Fig. 9e and f. After four or five consecutive runs, no obvious decrease in the photocatalytic efficiencies are observed and there are no Sb ions in the suspension detected by the ICP-MS method. The Sb 3d core-level XPS spectra and SEM images of CN/Sb-10 before and after the cyclic experiments are similar (Fig. 4a and S19, ESI†). These results indicate the high chemical stability of Sb-doped CN in the photocatalytic processes.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation rates can also reflect the photoactivity of the samples. EPR spectroscopy was performed to detect ROS (˙O2−, ˙OH, and 1O2) generated by CN and CN/Sb-10. As shown in Fig. 10a, the EPR signals of both CN and CN/Sb-10 show characteristic peaks of the DMPO–˙O2− adduct52 after light irradiation, and the much stronger EPR signal for CN/Sb-10 indicates that CN/Sb-10 can produce ˙O2− much faster than CN. Fig. 10b shows a four-peak EPR signal with an intensity ratio of 1:2:2:1 for CN and CN/Sb-10 after light irradiation, assigned to the DMPO–˙OH adduct.52 CN/Sb-10 exhibits a stronger EPR signal than CN (Fig. 10b), demonstrating faster generation of ˙OH for CN/Sb-10. Fig. 10c shows 1:1:1 triplet EPR signals for CN and CN/Sb-10, indexed to generation of TEMP-trapped 1O2, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO).52 The EPR signal for CN/Sb-10 is stronger than that for CN after light irradiation, indicating rapider 1O2 production for CN/Sb-10. Overall, CN/Sb-10 possesses a much higher capability in generating ROS than CN. Given that ˙O2− is generated via electron reduction of O2 (Fig. 5c) and that 1O2 can be generated through hole oxidation of ˙O2−,53 the faster generation of ROS suggests faster charge separation and promises higher photocatalytic performance in environmental remediation, anti-bacterial, and other ROS-related reactions.

The photocatalytic performance of samples can be influenced by many factors, such as the specific surface area, photoabsorption, crystallinity, and the charge separation efficiency. Because the XRD peak intensity of CN/Sb-10 is similar to that of CN (Fig. 1a) and only a minor increase in the visible light absorption can be observed after the Sb doping (Fig. S14†), the influences of crystallinity and photoabsorption on the photoactivity enhancement are negligible. Though the Sb doping can induce an increase in the specific surface area (Table 1), CN/Sb-15 possesses a higher specific surface area but lower photoactivity than CN/Sb-10 (Fig. 9a), and the specific surface area-normalized PHE rate (31.8 μmol m−2 h−1) for CN/Sb-10 is still much higher than that (9.5 μmol m−2 h−1) for CN. Therefore, the specific surface area is also not the key factor leading to the photoactivity enhancement. Then, the Sb doping induced photoactivity improvement of CN/Sb-10 should mainly arise from the enhanced charge separation and transfer performance. As shown in Fig. 5c, photogenerated electrons and holes in CN/Sb-10 can transfer to ES (working as an electron-capture center) and EN (functioning as a hole-capture center), respectively, which considerably increases their recombination efficiency. The electrons at ES can further participate in interfacial reduction reactions like hydrogen evolution and ˙O2− generation, while holes at EN take part in oxidation processes like TEOA oxidation.
Conclusions
Sb-doped CN (CN/Sb) with charge-capture centers was prepared for the first time by a high-valent metal salt oxidation method. XPS, FT-IR, XANES, and 15N NMR techniques confirm the doping structure, i.e. fabrication of the N–SbIII bond. Benefiting from the N–SbIII bond that works as the charge-capture center, CN/Sb exhibits a much enhanced charge separation efficiency and thus a ∼3.5-fold increase in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate. The reactive oxygen species generation rates and photodegradation efficiencies of organic pollutants for CN/Sb are also much higher than those of CN. CN/Sb exhibits high chemical stability. This work effectively verifies the feasibility of preparing metal-doped CN by the high-valent metal salt oxidation strategy and illustrates in detail the mechanism for enhanced charge separation induced by metal doping in the CN framework. Our next work will focus on utilization of this doping strategy to synthesize CN-based photocatalysts for overall water splitting or CO2 reduction.
