    , Accepted 19th October 2020First published on 20th October 2020AbstractIn this study, for the first time, a novel low-cost halogen-free supramolecular additive, namely 5-hydroxy-2-methylpyrimidine (ROPD), has been applied to control the morphology of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM active layer, resulting in higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) value, as well as substantially increased thermal stability compared with the classic 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive. The introduction of the ROPD additive brings an enhanced molar extinction coefficient, higher carrier transporting ability, as well as better nanoscale phase-separated morphology, which is ascribed to the interaction with both PTB7-Th and PC71BM through π–π or/and hydrogen bonding, and confirmed by FT-IR, 1H NMR and XRD spectra. Encouragingly, even without thermal annealing (TA) and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatments, the PCE of a specimen processed with the ROPD additive improved from 7.40% to 8.33%, getting close to the enhanced 13% of its initial value. In contrast, using the 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) solution additive in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based device only results in an increase from 7.40 to 7.86%. In particular, after successive 60 °C thermal annealing for 210 h illumination, the trend of approaching 84.2% of the original efficiency was still maintained, and more than 76.1% and 55.6% was achieved with and without the DIO additive, respectively. These findings reveal that the smart utilization of a simple halogen-free solid additive by inducing hydrogen bonding is a promising approach for fabricating highly efficient and stable PSCs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have been one of the hottest issues in the research area of photovoltaic devices due to their unique advantages, such as lightweight property, flexibility, semitransparency, low-cost fabrication and large-area processing feasibility.1–8 For both academic and industrial applications, acquiring high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and nice stability is still one of the major challenges for OSCs. To date, numerous strategies have been employed to obtain high PCE via synthesizing novel polymer donor/acceptor materials, and the PCE of polymer solar cells (PSCs) has exceeded 17%.9–12 Encouragingly, the PCE based on PSCs has achieved up to 18% through selected well-matched donor/acceptor materials and optimizing the structure of the devices so far.12 As is well known, the manipulation of the active layer nanoscale morphology with optimal phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrated donor/acceptor networks can be obtained by the inclusion of processing thermal annealing (TA),13–15 solvent vapor annealing (SVA),16–19 a small amount of liquid,20–33 and solid additives.34–38 For instance, Hou and co-workers explored a series of volatilizable solid additives by considering the molecular structure feature of an A–D–A type non-fullerene acceptor (NFA).38 The application of solid additives can enhance the intermolecular π–π stacking of the NFAs and thus facilitate the charge transport properties in the active layers, leading to the improved efficiencies of PSCs. Furthermore, devices fabricated using these solid additives exhibit higher stability and reproducibility in comparison with the OSCs processed with solvent additives. In photovoltaic devices, among the factors mentioned, some additives are the simplest and most rapid way to optimize the active layer morphology to achieve the purpose of improving the PCE. The previously reported outstanding high boiling point liquid additives, such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),20–22 1,8-octanedithiol (ODT),23–26 diphenyl ether (DPE),27–29 and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN)30–33 have been used to modulate a favorable micro-phase morphology of the active layer. This approach facilitates a better phase separation, domain size, phase purity and more balanced charge transport channel for the PSCs. Besides the high efficiency, good device stability is equally crucial for the commercialization of PSCs. Nevertheless, to enhance the stability of PSCs, using the liquid additive is not a reliable processing technology.21 The additives in the active layer cannot be completely removed and a small quantity of residual additives promote the photo-oxidative deterioration, and extremely degrade the stability of the device.31,32,38–42
More recently, some studies have shown that the exploration of supramolecular additives to optimize the morphology of the bis-adduct fullerene-based binary systems and optoelectronic properties has also been reported.43,44 This includes the functional roles of the selected supramolecular additives, such as hydrogen bonding, and the nature of their interaction with the acceptor/donor in the active blend. In particular, these additives can promote the intermolecular π–π stacking and the charge carrier mobility, which is beneficial for enhancing PCE of PSCs, and also allows for the fabrication of photovoltaic devices that exhibit better stability over a long period of time and reproducibility.43,44 Thus, apart from developing efficient donor/receptor materials, further research effort of the simple and low-cost additive to accomplish high-performance PSCs is still an especially important subject. For example, Zhan et al. developed a novel additive, molecular lock BPO, to enhance the efficiency and stability of OSCs simultaneously by the effect of hydrogen bonding.43 Meanwhile, Singh et al. demonstrated the strategy of an additive that was obtained from a diketopyrrolopyrrole dye (DPP-NCO) for the fabrication of a supramolecular assembly.44 The DPP-NCO gel used as an additive in OSCs yields a high efficiency of 7.9% due to a better nanophase separation of its active layer. These advantages proved that as a simple and effective method, the development of an additive provides an alternative idea for improving the PCE of PSCs, as well as the stability of the device, which will certainly become one of the areas of increased research interest in the future.
With the aim of obtaining better PSCs by optimizing the morphology of the photovoltaic active layer, we present in this article the use of a low-cost halogen-free solid additive by inducing hydrogen bonding interactions, 5-hydroxy-2-methylpyrimidine (ROPD), which was selected to optimize the blend morphology via strengthening the intermolecular π–π stacking interaction and supramolecular interaction of blends in BHJ-PSCs. Compared with the conventional additives mentioned above,20–33 the simple and low-cost halogen-free solid additive ROPD employed here is harmless to human health and environment. To prove that the addition of ROPD is an effective strategy, PTB7-Th, PC71BM and ROPD were selected as the polymer donor, acceptor and solid additive, respectively, to manufacture PSC devices and optimize the morphology of the photovoltaic active layer. Under conditions without the thermal annealing (TA) and solvent vapor annealing (SVA) treatments, the pristine specimen after ROPD additive treatment displayed better Jsc and PCE of 15.65 mA cm−2 and 8.33%, respectively, which is much higher than the Jsc/PCEs of 15.15 mA cm−2/7.40% and 14.74 mA cm−2/7.86% of the corresponding devices without any additive and with 3 vol% DIO as a liquid additive, respectively. Encouragingly, after a continuous 60 °C thermal annealing cycle for 210 h illumination with 3 wt% ROPD, the encapsulated devices still maintained 84.2% of the original PCE, while the devices were attenuated directly to 76.1% and 55.6% without or with 3 vol% DIO additive, respectively. As a result, the ROPD as an additive improved the molar extinction coefficient, enhanced the π–π stacking between ROPD and PTB7-Th, constituted an optimized micronanoscale blend morphology, and enhanced the charge carrier mobility, and also resulted in considerably photo-induced stability. This work supplies a novel approach to explore the simple-structured halogen-free small molecule via introducing hydrogen bonding as the additive. In particular, the application of ROPD into the devices was based on the PBTOR-FBTA donor45 and the device with an area of 0.16 cm2, and the method was also found to be versatile for efficiency optimization (see ESI†). In addition, this type of low-cost halogen-free solid additive should have potential commercial application of PSCs.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Measurements and characterization
Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra were recorded with a Varian Cary 50 UV-Vis spectrophotometer and PerkinElmer Ls 50 B luminescence spectrometer, respectively. The FT-IR and 1H NMR spectra were performed by a NICOLET IS 10 FT-IR spectrometer and a Bruker Dex-400 MHz NMR spectrometer using tetramethyl silane as a reference in deuterated chloroform solution at 298 K, respectively. Surface morphologies were measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM) on a Veeco-DI Multimode NS-3D apparatus in trapping mode under normal air condition at 298 K. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the blend films were conducted by a RINT2000 vertical goniometer operated at 40 kV voltage and a 250 mA current with Cu Kα radiation.
2.2. PSC fabrication and photovoltaic performance measurements
Employing the classic polymer PTB7-Th as an electron donor, PC71BM as an electron acceptor, and DIO or ROPD as an additive in the active layer, a series of BHJ OSCs were obtained. Under the illumination of AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2, solution-processed SMs with the optimized device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (3000 rpm, 130 °C, 30 min)/(PTB7-Th:PC71BM, 1:1.5, w:w) (1500 rpm)/PFN-Br (5 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated. The device structures are ITO/ZnO (30 nm)/active layer/PFN-Br (5 nm)/Al (100 nm) for the electron-only devices and ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) for the hole-only devices. The device area is 0.16 cm2, as defined by a shadow mask. The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned in detergent, successively ultrasonicated in deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and exposed for 20 min, respectively. Finally, the samples were heated at 90 °C in a vacuum drying oven, and the ITO glasses were treated with UV-ozone for 15 min after ultrasonic cleaning and nitrogen blowing. Then, PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 130 °C for 15 min. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend solutions were prepared by dissolving the components in a ratio of 1:1.5 (by weight) with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) with various ratios of ROPD from 1 wt% to 5 wt%, and without or with 3 vol% DIO for comparison. After the completion of spin coating, the active layer was placed in the vacuum transition chamber for 2 h to remove the solvent. PFN-Br (0.5 mg mL−1 in methanol) was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 30 s to obtain a thickness of ∼5 nm. Finally, 100 nm Al was thermally evaporated as the cathode with an active area of 0.16 cm2 under the vacuum of 4 × 10−4 Torr. As a result, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based devices possess the most optimal D/A ratio of 1:1.5, a ROPD additive concentration of 3 wt%, and a spin-coating rate of 1500 rpm without any treatment, such as TA and SVA treatment. The measurements of the corresponding PSCs were accomplished in air under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The current density–voltage (J–V) measurements of the photovoltaic devices were performed using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter. The characterization was conducted in the glove box under a simulated AM 1.5 G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). The EQE measurements were conducted through the Stanford Research Systems model SR830 DSP quantum efficiency measurement system. Atomic force microscopy measurements were used to observe the surface morphology of the active layers. The light intensity was calibrated using a Newport Oriel PN 91150 V Si-based solar cells. The hole/electron mobility was recorded by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, and determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC using the Mott–Gurney equation.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The effect of the ROPD additive on the PCE of PSCs based on the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blended films
The chemical structures of the active layer materials, including PTB7-Th as the donor, PC71BM as acceptor, and DIO or ROPD as the additive in this work, are depicted in Fig. 1a. To elucidate the processing potential of the two additives, DIO and ROPD, a conventional device with a configuration structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (3000 rpm, 130 °C, 30 min)/(PTB7-Th:PC71BM, 1:1.5, w:w) (100 nm)/PFN-Br (5 nm)/Al (100 nm) was used and is exhibited in Fig. 1d. From Fig. 1, it can be seen that the absorption range of the PTB7-Th is complementary to that of PC71BM (Fig. 1b). The energy level diagram for the device materials is shown in Fig. 1c. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the previously reported polymer donor PTB7-Th and PC71BM acceptor were 3.64/−5.22 eV and −4.00/−5.80 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps of 1.58 eV and 1.80 eV can be obtained from the LUMO/HOMO of PTB7-Th and PC71BM, which can form a better charge transport channel.

To assess the effect of the ROPD additive on the photovoltaic performances of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blends, the active layers were cast without TA and SVA treatment. Meanwhile, to achieve the best device performance, we first chose the ROPD additive in an o-DCB solvent varied ratio from 1 wt% to 5 wt%, respectively. Their tested J–V and external quantum efficiency (EQE) are depicted in Fig. 2a and b, respectively, and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As demonstrated, among the varied ROPD ratio additives, the device with 3 wt% ROPD displays the best photovoltaic properties with a highest Voc value of 0.80 V, a best FF value of 66.45%, a better Jsc value of 15.65 mA cm−2 and a highest PCE value of 8.33%, which indicates that the 3 wt% ROPD is the best ratio for an additive system. As comparison, the PSCs based on the active layers without or with an optimal proportion of 3 vol% DIO were also fabricated. The J–V and EQE tested results are exhibited in Fig. 2c and d, respectively, and the relevant photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. As for the processing without any additive, a decayed PCE of 7.40% was achieved with a Voc of 0.81 V, Jsc of 15.15 mA cm−2 and a FF of 60.04%. Under further mixing with 3.0 vol% DIO, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based PSC presents a PCE of 7.86% with a higher FF of 67.23%, slightly smaller Voc of 0.79 V and Jsc of 14.74 mA cm−2. Compared to its as-cast device the DIO and ROPD additive based devices were enhanced by 6.2% and 13.0% of its original value, respectively. Notably, the ROPD-processed device exhibited quite higher PCEs than the processed ones with DIO as well. In addition, to confirm the relatively higher Jsc value in the device processed with the ROPD additive, we introduced an EQE measurement as shown in Fig. 2d. All devices show a wide range of photocurrent generation in the region of 400–800 nm. The integrated current from the EQE spectra agree well with those obtained from the J–V measurements within 5% mismatches. Compared with the as-cast or DIO additive-based PSC, the ROPD additive-treated PSC exhibits a higher EQE across the incident light wavelength range. A significant improvement of the EQE spectra in the 350 to 770 nm range was observed, which may be ascribed to more light absorption, better crystallization, and a higher phase separation between the donor and acceptor.44,46–50 The varied photoresponse from the processing additive occurs because of the different absorption of the active layer.48

The electron mobility (μe) and hole mobility (μh) of the PTB7-Th/PC71BM blend films without additive, with 3 vol% DIO or 3 wt% ROPD were performed by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method in their electron-only and hole-only devices, respectively. Fig. 3a and b show the J1/2–V plots of the electron-only devices and hole-only device, respectively, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. For the PTB7-Th/PC71BM blend with no additions, with 3 vol% DIO and with 3 wt% ROPD additive, the μe/μh values were calculated to be 5.45/3.57 × 10−4, 7.47/6.06 × 10−4 and 9.70/8.61 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, with a μe/μh ratio of 1.52, 1.23 and 1.12, respectively. Clearly, this blend film with ROPD additive exhibits higher carrier mobility and better charge balance than those of the blend films with no additive and DIO additive, respectively. The results demonstrate that adding ROPD is beneficial to the well-organized and compact arrangement for the resulting active layer, and also responsible for the Jsc improvement.49,50

To further probe the photon harvesting and exciton dissociation characteristics of the PSCs, the dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) with different additives was measured. As shown in Fig. 3c, Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD represent the circuit density under illumination and dark conditions, respectively. Here, Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the external bias voltage. When Veff is at a relatively high value (2.0–3.0 V in this experiment), it can be assumed that the excitons are dissociated efficiently into mobile charge carriers and collected by electrodes, and the average current density at this time can be used as the saturation current density (Jsat). The ratio of the photocurrent density (Jph) to the saturated photocurrent density (Jsat) is the exciton dissociation efficiency (Pdiss) for this device. The Pdiss values for the none-additive, DIO and ROPD-based PSCs were calculated to be 92.7%, 93.6% and 93.7%, respectively. As a result, the devices with the ROPD of the supramolecular additive (such as hydrogen bonds) have better exciton separation and transport capability, which leads to the optimal device performance of the PTB7-Th:ROPD:PC71BM-based photovoltaic devices.50,51Fig. 3d presents the J–V characteristics of PSCs using the none-additive, DIO and ROPD as the active layer additives measured without illumination, respectively. The leakage current of the device with ROPD as the active layer additive is remarkably controlled, demonstrating that the recombination of the carrier was repressed by the active layer with the ROPD additive. Therefore, the higher photocurrent of the devices with the ROPD additive as the active layer additive is entirely predictable.51
3.2. The effect of the ROPD on the photophysical properties of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blended films
To explore the effect of the varied additives on the UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) intensities of the blends, their absorption and PL spectra of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM pristine film, PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film with 3 vol% DIO and 3 wt% ROPD additive were measured, and are outlined in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. As seen in Fig. 4a, their absorption spectra of the blend films with DIO or ROPD additive exhibit broader and stronger molar extinction coefficient in comparison to that of the pristine blend film without any additive. The PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film with 3 wt% ROPD additive exhibits the highest absorption coefficient among all blend films. To further understand the overlapping spectra of the different dopant films, the normalized absorption of the blend films with different additives were obtained. As recorded in Fig. 4a (inset), the absorption peaks have no obvious difference after adding ROPD, which may be due to the high molecular weight of the polymer PTB7-Th, and there is no obvious improvement in the stacking of the blend film.52 Consequently, the ROPD additive considerably benefits the redshift, width, and peak strength of the absorption spectra, which results in achieving a high Jsc value.50,51,53 The PL quenching measurements were employed to evaluate the exciton dissociation and charge transport in the active layer blend films. As shown in Fig. 4b, compared with the as-pristine blend film, the luminescence intensity of the active layer blend films decreases gradually with the addition of the DIO or ROPD additive. The luminescence quenching efficiency increases, and it is more obvious after adding ROPD. This indicates that the recombination of the hole electron pairs is less, and the exciton pair dissociation efficiency is improved, contributing to better exciton dissociation and charge transport towards higher Jsc.48,50 We demonstrate that the introduction of the ROPD additive into the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film can form an intermolecular hydrogen bond between ROPD and PTB7-Th:PC71BM, which is attributed to a good interpenetrating network structure and π–π stacking with the donor/receptor in the active layer,48,50 as elucidated below.

(c) FT-IR spectra of PTB7-Th, ROPD and mixed films (1:1, w:w). (d) FT-IR spectra of PC71BM, ROPD and mixed films (1:1, w:w), respectively. 
To understand the reason for the enhanced PCE of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based PSC through the addition of the ROPD additive, FT-IR spectra of the PTB7-T, PC71BM, ROPD, ROPD/PTB7-Th (1:1, w:w) and ROPD/PC71BM (1:1, w:w) films were measured. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the O–H stretching vibration peak of the hydroxyl groups is located at 1448.3 cm−1 in the ROPD neat film. While the ROPD was mixed with PTB7-Th and PC71BM, this absorption peak shifted to 1461.8 cm−1 and 1400.1 cm−1, respectively. The variational O–H vibration peaks suggest that the hydrogen bond interaction really exists between the hydroxyl groups in ROPD and PTB7-Th/PC71BM. Furthermore, to verify the existence of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds between ROPD and the PTB7-Th/PC71BM components, the 1H NMR spectra of PTB7-Th, ROPD, ROPD/PTB7-Th (1:1, w/w) and ROPD/PC71BM (1:1, w/w) were recorded, and are shown in Fig. 5a and b. The chemical shift peak of the hydrogen atom on the hydroxyl group in ROPD was found to be 10.07 ppm in deuterated chloroform. When PTB7-Th and PC71BM were added individually, the position of this peak shifted, indicating that the chemical environment of the hydroxyl hydrogen atoms was changed, confirming that the intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions existed between ROPD and the PTB7-Th/PC71BM components.50,54

3.3. Morphology and miscibility
To investigate the influence of different additives in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend films on the active layer morphologies, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. 6a-i, with the non-additive, DIO additive and ROPD additive, the root mean square (RMS) roughnesses (Rq) of 0.895, 2.99 and 4.86 nm were achieved in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM pristine films, respectively. The suitable surface roughness and phase separation of the blend films are expected to be advantageous to the higher photovoltaic performance in the related PSCs. Compared to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM pristine film, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:DIO blend film and PTB7-Th:PC71BM:ROPD blend film show improved domain size, which is compatible with their higher crystallinities indicated in the XRD measurements. In addition, among all blend films, the surface of the blend film (Fig. 6c and d) processed with the supramolecular ROPD additive had more grains, which is beneficial to suppress the charge recombination and enhance Jsc generation in efficient PSCs, eventually resulting in the enhancement of its photovoltaic performance.48,50

3.4. Crystallinity and π–π stacking characterization
To further verify the influences of the vertical phase separation of PTB7-Th:PC71BM pristine film with the DIO blend film and with the ROPD blend film, X-ray diffraction (XRD) of the blend film was employed to distinguish the π–π stacking of the active layers and crystallinity of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM pristine film, PTB7-Th:PC71BM:DIO blend film and PTB7-Th:PC71BM:ROPD blend film systems. Their d-spacing data can be determined with the Bragg equation in terms of the 2-theta angle (2θ) of diffraction. As shown in Fig. 7a, three peaks with almost the same diffraction (100, 200, 010) are observed for the different films, and their corresponding d (001) spacing data are 4.191 Å, 4.188 Å and 4.183 Å, respectively, which demonstrate the lamellar packing for both molecules.55 Meanwhile, after doping with 3 wt% ROPD, a sharper and stronger diffraction (010) peak at 2θ = 35.1° was observed in comparison with the pristine film and blend film with 3 vol% DIO additive. This suggests that the active layer containing 3 wt% ROPD additive can boost crystallization, and exhibit more ordered lamellar stacking of the active layer than those blend films without any additive or with the DIO additive. This results in a more homogeneous distribution, which is consistent with the AFM results mentioned above, leading to better device performance.55,56

3.5. Device stability
In the previous reports, solvent additives, such as DIO, are usually utilized in PSCs to boost PCE, but the device stability is seriously abated.21 Herein, the ROPD additive can improve molecular distributions due to its ease in forming hydrogen bond interactions in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM system, which is beneficial to the device stability. Their device-based blend films without any additive, with 3 vol% DIO and with 3 wt% ROPD additive under light radiation condition in an ambient atmosphere were measured, and all device values were recorded from seven samples for each parameter. As shown in Fig. 7b, after successive 60 °C thermal annealing for 210 h illumination, the PCE of PSCs still remained at 76.1% of its pristine state, while the efficiency of the device with DIO residual decayed dramatically to 55.6%. Encouragingly, the device with 3 wt% ROPD additive remained at 84.2% of its original PCE. These results indicate that adding the additive involving intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the active layer can enhance the device efficiency, and boost a significant increase in both thermal stability and photostability, which is a crucial strategy for commercial applications of PSCs.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we developed a novel low-cost halogen-free solid organic additive, ROPD, which can be employed to enhance the PCE of BHJ-PSCs without any TA and SVA treatments. When 3 wt% ROPD is added to the PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend film, better interpenetrating network structure and phase separation are achieved. As a result, an enhanced PCE value of 8.33% was obtained in the PTB7-Th:PC71BM:3wt%ROPD-based device, which is enhanced by 13% in comparison with that of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based device. Besides, the resulting device displays an improved device stability at 60 °C for 210 h. This ROPD as a simple halogen-free solid additive should be a promising strategy for fabricating highly efficient and stable PSCs.
