    , Accepted 23rd June 2013First published on 26th June 2013AbstractTitanium carbide/platinum (TiC/Pt) composites were prepared by a simple chemical route and subsequently introduced into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) as counter electrode (CE) catalysts to improve the catalytic activity and reduce the cost of DSCs. The DSC using TiC/Pt (containing 0.12 wt% of Pt) CE showed high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.63%, higher than those of DSCs using TiC and Pt CEs (6.40% and 7.16%, respectively). After a long-term (one year) stability test, the PCE of the DSC using this CE retained 86.9% of its highest value, proving the outstanding durability of the TiC/Pt composite. In large-scale DSCs (55 mm × 75 mm), the DSC using TiC/Pt CE yielded a PCE of 4.98%, comparable to that of a DSC using Pt CE (4.94%). This work points out the feasibility of using TiC/Pt composite CEs in practical applications.
1 Introduction
High power conversion efficiency (PCE) and low cost are two key issues for the industrialization of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The photoanode (semiconductor and dye), electrolyte (containing redox couples), and counter electrode (CE) are the three components of DSCs, and each plays a significant role in generating electricity.1 Exploring new dyes and mesoporous semiconductor oxide films is a crucial step in pursuing high PCEs; consequently, much attention has been given to the particular field involving DSCs.2–4 For the CE, platinum (Pt) is a common catalyst for the regeneration of redox couples in electrolytes. However, Pt is a noble metal, and its limited reserves and high cost prove to be significant obstacles to the industrialization of DSCs. Therefore, replacing Pt with Pt-free CE catalysts is an effective way to reduce the cost of DSCs.5 Economical catalysts, such as carbon materials,6–8 conductive polymers,9–11 and transition metal compounds, can be used to supersede Pt.12–20 Moreover, loading is a common method to reduce the quantity of the noble metal without sacrificing its catalytic activity. Composites are the products of loading. As the name implies, composites commonly comprise two or more components, such as carbon/TiO2, WC/carbon, MoC/carbon, Pt/carbon, carbon/PEDOT/PSS, CoS/PEDOT/PSS, PtNP/MWCNT, Pt/graphene, PEDOT/graphene, CNTs/graphene, and Pt/CNT, etc.6,12,21–35 Naturally, the advantages of the composite CEs are as follows: first, it combines the best qualities of all components into one composite; second, it can reduce the quantity of Pt regard to the Pt based composite CEs; third, it can obviously improve the catalytic activity.
In this paper, we prepared a titanium carbide/platinum (TiC/Pt) composite CE by an in situ chemical method for DSCs. The TiC/Pt composite containing 0.12 wt% Pt loading was found to achieve high catalytic activity, and the corresponding DSC showed a PCE of 7.63%. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), Tafel polarization, and lifetime-electron density results also confirmed the high catalytic activity of the TiC/Pt composite. Furthermore, the TiC/Pt composite exhibited excellent long-term stability, and the PCE retained 86.9% of its highest value after one year durability test. Finally, we assembled large-scale DSCs (55 mm × 75 mm) using the TiC/Pt CE which yielded a PCE of 4.98%, comparable to that of the DSC using the Pt CE (4.94%). Hence, the prepared TiC/Pt composite has been proved to possess potential for industrial applications.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Photoanode fabrication
A nanocrystalline film made up of 5 layers of TiO2 (solaronix D, Switzerland) sensitized with N719 dye (Solaronix, Switzerland) was used as the photoanode. In detail, a thin layer TiO2 was coated on FTO conductive glass using a screen printing technique. Then the TiO2 film was sintered at 200 °C for 15 min. The above mentioned process was repeated four times and a 5 layer TiO2 film was obtained. After sintering at 500 °C for 10 min and cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 film was treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution, and then washed with distilled water. After sintering at 500 °C for 30 min, the mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 film was completely fabricated. The thickness of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film was 12 μm. Then, the TiO2 film was pre-heated to 80 °C and immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye in acetonitrile–tert-butyl alcohol (1:1 volume ration) for 20 h and the photoanode was obtained. Two kinds of electrolyte were used in this research. The first is the 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN) electrolyte which contains 0.1 M of LiI, 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.07 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in MPN. The MPN electrolyte is used in small sized DSCs because it is stable for long-term durability test. The second is the acetonitrile (AC) electrolyte which contains 0.06 M of LiI, 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in AC. The AC electrolyte is used in large-scale DSCs because it has a good fluidity which favors for encapsulation.
2.2 CE fabrication
200 mg of TiC powder was dispersed in 4 mL isopropanol. The solution was then ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min and the TiC paste for spraying was obtained. The prepared paste was sprayed onto an FTO glass with an air brush. Subsequently, the FTO glass coated with TiC paste was sintered in N2 atmosphere at 500 °C for 30 min and the TiC CE was prepared. The TiC/Pt CE was prepared as follows: 400 mg of TiC powder was dispersed in 8 mL isopropanol followed by adding 50, 150, 250, or 350 μL isopropanol solution containing 0.5 wt% chloroplatinic acid. The solution was then ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min and the TiC/chloroplatinic acid paste was obtained. The prepared paste was sprayed onto an FTO glass and then sintered in N2 atmosphere at 500 °C for 30 min, producing the TiC/Pt CE. The prepared TiC/Pt CE were denoted as TiC/Pt-1 (50 μL, containing 0.024 wt% Pt loading), TiC/Pt-2 (150 μL, containing 0.072 wt% Pt loading), TiC/Pt-3 (250 μL, containing 0.12 wt% Pt loading), and TiC/Pt-4 (350 μL, containing 0.17 wt% Pt loading). The Pt electrode on FTO glass was fabricated by thermal decomposition as follows: isopropanol solution containing 0.5 wt% chloroplatinic acid was sprayed on FTO conductive glass for 5 s. The resulting conductive glass was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, and the Pt electrode was obtained.
2.3 Cells fabrication
DSCs were assembled with a photoanode and a CE clipping the electrolyte and sealed with a hot-melt surlyn film. A symmetrical cell was assembled with two identical CEs. The active area of the small sized DSC is 16 mm2. The active surface area of the large-scale DSCs is 1728 mm2. The active area of the symmetrical cells is 56 mm2.
2.4 Measurements
X-ray diffraction (XRD) were carried out with an automatic X-ray powder diffractometer (D/Max 2400, RIGAKU). Surface morphologies of the TiC and TiC/Pt were checked by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI QUANTA 450). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) was carried out with Oxford INCA Energy 350. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) for I3−/I− redox couple was carried out in a three-electrode system in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution which contained 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1 using a electrochemical analyzer (CHI630, Chenhua, Shanghai). Pt served as a counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ as a reference electrode. The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was carried out in simulated AM 1.5 illumination (I = 100 mW cm−2, PEC-L15, Peccell, Japan) with a digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA). EIS experiments were tested with the symmetrical cells, the small sized DSCs, and the large-scale DSCs using a computer-controlled potentiostat (Zennium Zahner, Germany). For the symmetrical cells, the EIS measurements were carried out in the dark, the measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz, and the bias was −0.70 V; for the small sized DSCs, the EIS measurements were carried out under light, the measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz, without bias; for the large-scale DSCs, the EIS measurements were carried out under dark, the measured frequency ranged from 10 mHz to 1 MHz, and the bias was −0.70 V. The amplitude of the alternating current was all set at 10 mV. Tafel polarization measurements were measured with an electrochemical workstation system (CHI630, Chenhua, Shanghai) with a symmetrical dummy cell. The scan rate was 10 mV s−1. The paragraphs were shot with PENTAX, K10D, and the lens is PENTAX, DA 35/2.4.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization of the prepared TiC/Pt composite

Fig. 1a presents the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the TiC before and after loading with Pt. The diffraction peaks at 36.06°, 41.86°, 60.70°, 72.70°, and 76.44° were assigned to the crystal planes of [111], [200], [220], [311], and [222] for TiC (PDF-2 database, no. 65-0966). In the case of TiC/Pt, the weak diffraction peaks at 39.76° and 46.24° were assigned to the crystal planes of [111] and [200] for Pt (PDF2-database, no. 04-0802, see the close-up XRD profile for Pt crystalline in Fig. 1b). These data indicated the successful preparation of the TiC/Pt composite. The SEM image in Fig. 2a shows that the diameter of the TiC particles is 30–50 nm. In Fig. 2b, no evident changes in the TiC/Pt composite could be observed compared with TiC. The Pt particle was too small to be observed due to poor crystallinity, as shown by the dull diffraction peaks. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) image in Fig. 2c shows that the weight content of Pt is 0.12%.

3.2 TiC/Pt composite CE applied in DSCs
In this work, we prepared 4 TiC/Pt composite CEs containing Pt loading of 0.024, 0.072, 0.12, and 0.17 wt%, denoted as TiC/Pt-1, TiC/Pt-2, TiC/Pt-3 and TiC/Pt-4, respectively. Then, these TiC/Pt composites were used as the CEs in DSCs. As shown in Fig. 3, the DSC using the pristine TiC CE showed a PCE of 6.40%, lower than that of the DSC using the Pt CE (7.16%) and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. In the case of TiC/Pt-1 to 4, the DSCs exhibited PCE of 6.66 to 7.68%. After adding 250 μL or more chloroplatinic acid solution to the TiC paste, the composite TiC/Pt CE exhibited the highest catalytic activity, while continuous addition of chloroplatinic acid solution did not enhance the catalytic activity obviously. That is to say, adding 0.12 wt% Pt into TiC is enough to obtain the highest catalytic activity. The superiorities of the TiC/Pt-based DSCs were seen in its high fill factor (FF), caused by the improved catalytic activity of the TiC/Pt composite CE. Thus, in situ loading is an effective method to obtain a highly effective catalyst. Further, the composite CE could greatly reduce the quantity of Pt used, subsequently reducing the cost of DSC without sacrificing PCE.

3.3 Electrochemical characterization of the TiC/Pt electrode by CV, EIS, Tafel polarization, and life time-electron density measurements
As the TiC/Pt-3 performed best, in the following section we used the TiC/Pt-3 CE to carry out a series of experiments. CV was performed to reveal the catalytic activity of the composite TiC/Pt CE. Fig. 4 gives the typical voltammograms for the iodide electrolyte. For Pt, two pairs of redox peaks were observed. The pair of peaks at low potential could be attributed to the redox reaction of eqn (1), whereas the pair at high potential could be attributed to the redox reaction of eqn (2). Likewise, TiC showed two redox peaks, indicating that TiC is a decent CE catalyst as previously reported.13 In the case of TiC/Pt, two pairs of redox peaks were observed, and the voltammogram had a perfect appearance. In addition, the current density was evidently improved for TiC/Pt compared with TiC. As for the left redox peaks, the cathodic peak of TiC/Pt moved toward the positive end, whereas the anodic peak moved toward the negative end, compared with TiC or Pt. In other words, the ΔEp (peak-to-peak separation) for TiC/Pt was smaller than that of TiC or Pt. Theoretically, ΔEp varies inversely with the charge transfer rate (ks), and the ks value for TiC/Pt is higher than TiC and Pt.36,37 Moreover, the low ΔEp indicated that TiC/Pt had better reversibility than TiC and Pt. The CV results proved the smoothness of the redox reaction of the triiodide/iodide materials on the TiC/Pt electrode, which produced favorable conditions for the regeneration of the sensitizer. This finding confirms that loading is a feasible method for producing an economical but superior catalyst. I−3 + 2e− = 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− = 2I−3(2)

EIS using symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes was carried out to investigate the electrochemical process for TiC/Pt, which had a close relationship with the catalytic activity. Fig. 5 shows the EIS spectra with typical (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Bode phase plots. In Fig. 5a, the high frequency intercept on the real axis corresponds to the series resistance (Rs). The left semicircle at the high-frequency region arises from the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding double layer capacitance (Cμ) at the electrode/electrolyte interface, whereas the other semicircle at the low-frequency region arises from the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the triiodide/iodide component in the electrolyte. The values of the EIS parameters were obtained by fitting the EIS plots with an equivalent circuit (inset in Fig. 5a). The corresponding EIS parameters are summarized in Table 2. The Rs values for TiC, Pt, and TiC/Pt could be considered the same. The Rct values for the TiC and Pt were 2.67 and 1.72 Ω, respectively. In contrast, the Rct value for TiC/Pt was reduced to 0.97 Ω. In addition, the ZN value for the TiC/Pt was larger than those of the TiC and Pt, indicating the low diffusion velocity of the redox couples.21 The large Cμ value for TiC/Pt demonstrated a large specific surface area, which was also favorable for achieving a high catalytic activity. EIS results showed that TiC/Pt behaved more effectively than TiC or Pt in the reduction of I3−. The difference in Rct, Cμ, and ZN led to the variety of efficiencies for the DSCs using the three CEs. The Bode phase diagram comprised two identical frequency (f) peaks. The left one was assigned to the ZN of the redox couples in the electrolyte, and the right one to the Rct at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The position of the high-frequency peak for TiC/Pt was much higher than those of TiC and Pt, which indicated that a high charge transfer velocity existed at the TiC/Pt electrode and electrolyte interface. I3− was smoothly reduced to I− on the TiC/Pt electrode surface. Based on eqn (3), the Rct values for TiC/Pt could be deduced to be smaller than those for both TiC and Pt, consistent with the data obtained from the Nyquist plots. (3)where Rct is the charge transfer resistance; f is the frequency, Cμ is the capacitance.

Tafel polarization measurements were carried out to reconfirm the catalytic activity of the TiC/Pt electrodes. Fig. 6 shows the Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells, similar to the ones used in EIS measurements. The curves showed logarithmic current density (J) as a function of voltage (U); a detailed analysis of the Tafel polarization can be found in our previous research.13
 Fig. 6  Tafel polarization curves of the symmetrical cells using Pt, TiC, and TiC/Pt electrodes. 
The exchange current density (J0) of the TiC was lower than that of Pt, indicating that TiC had a relatively lower catalytic activity than Pt. However, the curve of TiC/Pt showed a higher J0 compared with TiC and Pt, demonstrating that TiC/Pt performed better than TiC and Pt. In theory, J0 varies inversely with Rct (eqn (4)); the change tendency of J0, as deduced from the EIS results, is generally in accordance with those presented in the Tafel curves. After performing a comprehensive analysis of the CV, EIS, and Tafel polarization results, this study found that the photovoltaic performance is in agreement with the order of catalytic activity of the TiC, Pt, and TiC/Pt CEs. The high catalytic activity of the TiC/Pt composite CE could be attributed to the synergistic catalytic effects of the TiC and Pt.30 Moreover, electron lifetime (τ) and charge density measurements were done by step light-induced transient measurement of photocurrent and voltage (SLIM-PCV), as shown in Fig. 7. On the one hand, the lifetime of the TiC/Pt-based DSC was shorter than that of the TiC-based DSC, which induced a low recombination probability and in turn indicated an efficient charge collection for the TiC/Pt-based DSC.38 On the other hand, the charge density of the TiC/Pt-based DSC was higher than the TiC-based DSC, which was found to be favorable for a high PCE. (4)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, n is the number of electrons involved in the reaction, and Rct and J0 have the common meanings.

3.4 Long-term stability test of TiC/Pt composite CE
To be an eligible catalyst, the composite should possess robust stability aside from high catalytic activity. In this work, the long-term stability of the DSC using the TiC/Pt CE under light was checked. As shown in Fig. 8, after one year, the photovoltaic parameters, the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc), FF, and PCE retained 93.5%, 97.0%, 90.9%, and 86.9% of their highest values, respectively. The perfect stability of the DSC indicated that the TiC/Pt composite possessed excellent intrinsic corrosion resistance and perfect stability even under harsh conditions, which make the composite more suitable for low-cost, long-term, stable, and large-scale DSCs. Meanwhile, after one year, the PCE of the TiC based DSC decreased from 6.40% to 5.35%, showing that TiC was a stable CE catalyst in the iodide electrolyte.
 Fig. 8  Long-term stability test of the DSCs using TiC/Pt CE. 
EIS measurements were carried out with the DSC before and after the long-term (one year) stability test to investigate the changes in the electrochemical process of TiC/Pt-based DSCs after long-term use. Fig. 9 gives the Nyquist plots, and the high-frequency intercept on the real axis is generally attributed to Rs. The three semicircles in the high-frequency (left), middle-frequency (middle), and low-frequency (right) regions correspond to the charge transfer resistance [Rct(CE)] and the capacitance [Cμ(CE)] at the CE/electrolyte interface, the charge transfer and recombination resistance [Rct(AE)] at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces and the corresponding capacitance [Cμ(CE)], and the ZN of the triiodide/iodide component in the electrolyte, respectively.39 The Rs values for the DSCs before and after the long-term stability test were 27.0 and 27.6 Ω, respectively. Meanwhile, the Rct(CE) values were 2.4 and 2.5 Ω before and after the long-term stability test, respectively. No significant change was observed for the TiC/Pt CE, indicating excellent stability for TiC/Pt after long-term use. For the photoanode, the Rct(AE) value increased from 43.6 Ω to 56.9 Ω after the long-term stability test, and this increase may be ascribed to dye decomposition and desorption. Moreover, the ZN increased form 22.3 Ω to 26.6 Ω, which may be due to cell leakage, electrolyte volatilization, or iodide sublimation. The loss of PCE in the TiC/Pt-based DSC may have been caused by the deterioration of the photoanode and the electrolyte, which in turn supports the high stability of the TiC/Pt composite CE.

3.5 TiC/Pt CEs applied in large-scale DSCs
The above-mentioned experiments indicated the feasibility of the TiC/Pt for lab use; the active area of the DSCs was only 16 mm2. The cell scale should be enlarged if industrialization is to be achieved. In this research, we prepared a large-scale TiC/Pt CE and used it to fabricate large-scale DSCs. Fig. 10 shows photographs of the large-scale DSCs using Pt and TiC/Pt CEs. The dimension of the DSCs was 55 mm × 75 mm, and the active area of the DSCs was 1728 mm2.
 Fig. 10  Photographs of the large-scale DSCs using Pt and TiC/Pt CEs. 

Fig. 11 shows the J–V curves of the large-scale DSCs using Pt and TiC/Pt CEs. The DSC using the TiC/Pt CE obtained a PCE of 4.98%, similar to that of the Pt-based DSC (4.94%). The TiC/Pt-based DSC yielded a high Jsc of 15.10 mA cm−2, higher than that of the Pt-based DSC. By contrast, the TiC/Pt-based DSC showed a Voc of 673 mV, lower than that of the Pt-based DSC (722 mV). In the encapsulation of large-scale DSCs, the TiC/Pt-based DSC was more difficult to seal than the Pt-based DSC due to the high roughness of the TiC/Pt CE. Although the high roughness of the TiC/Pt is propitious to achieving a high catalytic activity, it can easily cause the cell to short-circuit because of the direct contact between the TiC/Pt CE and the photoanode. This direct contact can lead to a serious charge recombination and leakage of Voc. Therefore, the DSC using TiC/Pt yielded a low Voc value. If the TiC/Pt-based DSC is sealed without partly short-circuiting the cell, we believe that the Voc and PCE can be significantly enhanced.

Studies on EIS characterization for large-scale DSCs are scarce. Scientific EIS analysis can help to design high-efficiency DSCs. In this work, EIS measurements were carried out for the large-scale TiC/Pt- and Pt-based DSCs. As shown in Fig. 12, three semicircles are observed, and their assignments are similar to those of small-sized DSCs mentioned in section 3.4. The Rs values for TiC/Pt- and Pt-based DSCs were 0.24 and 0.29 Ω, respectively; whereas the Rct (CE) values for TiC/Pt- and Pt-based DSCs were 0.03 and 0.07 Ω, respectively. Compared with Pt, the TiC/Pt CE also showed superiority in large-scale DSCs. By contrast, the Rct (AE) values for TiC/Pt- and Pt-based DSCs were 0.23 and 0.47 Ω, respectively. Strictly speaking, the Rct (AE) should be divided into two parts: one is the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface, whereas the other is the charge recombination resistance (Rcr) at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface. In large-scale DSCs, recombination is more severe than that in small-sized DSCs due to the long lateral route of the electrons crossing the TiO2 network. More attention should be given to the Rcr, which may often be ignored in small-sized DSCs. In our study, the Rct(AE) value of the TiC/Pt-based DSC was lower than that of the Pt-based DSC. Moreover, the Rcr of TiC/Pt-based DSCs could be considered to be much lower than that of the Pt-based DSC, inducing a large charge recombination in the TiC/Pt-based DSC. This finding is the direct reason for the low Voc of TiC/Pt-based DSCs. Meanwhile, the ZN values for the TiC/Pt- and Pt-based DSCs were 0.13 and 0.17 Ω, respectively. Based on the analysis of the Rs, Rct (CE), Rct (AE), and ZN, the TiC/Pt composite can be reconfigured to behave as effectively as Pt.

4 Conclusions
TiC/Pt composite CEs were prepared by an in situ chemical method to reduce the quantity of Pt without compromising catalytic activity. 0.12 wt% Pt loading is enough for the TiC/Pt composite to obtain outstanding activity higher than Pt. The DSC using this composite CE yielded a high PCE of 7.63%, surpassing that of the Pt-based DSC (7.16%). The composite TiC/Pt showed a good stability and after a long-term (one year) durability test, the final PCE value retained 86.9% of its highest PCE value. The PCE loss resulted from photoanode and electrolyte deterioration and cell leakage, which occurred independently of the TiC/Pt CE. In the large-scale DSC module, TiC/Pt likewise showed a high catalytic activity, and the DSC (55 mm × 75 mm) yielded a PCE of 4.98%, which was comparable to the performance of the DSC using the Pt CE (4.94%). The preparation of economical composite CEs is an effective method for reducing the cost of DSCs, thereby paving the way for industrialization.
