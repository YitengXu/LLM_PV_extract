    , Accepted 11th December 2022First published on 12th December 2022AbstractZinc oxide (ZnO) is a readily preparable n-type semiconducting material with excellent electron transport properties and good transparency. Low-temperature sol–gel processes for the preparation of ZnO films on plastic substrates, which can accelerate application of the prepared ZnO films in flexible and lightweight organic optoelectronic devices have been recently reported. However, low-temperature-prepared ZnO exhibits high photocatalytic activity that can lead to low photodurability of the resulting organic devices due to the photodecomposition of organic active layer materials on the ZnO films. Here, we report a novel low-temperature sol–gel method that suppresses the photocatalytic activity of ZnO films. We found that the number of surface OH groups, which is related to the photocatalytic activity of ZnO, was reduced in ZnO films prepared by the low-temperature sol–gel method under gentle vacuum (∼5 × 103 Pa). Organic solar cell (OSC) devices based on ZnO prepared under gentle vacuum (ZnOvac) have higher photodurability than devices based on ZnO prepared in air (ZnOair). The low photocatalytic activity of ZnOvac compared with that of ZnOair was confirmed by alternating current-impedance measurements of the OSCs. We also found that the photo-decomposition rate of non-fullerene acceptor materials on ZnOvac is much lower than that on ZnOair, which indicates that ZnOvac could be effective to develop photodurable non-fullerene OSCs with high photovoltaic performance.
1 Introduction
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a useful n-type semiconductor for organic electronic and optoelectronic thin-film devices because of features such as good electron mobility, high thermal and chemical stability, and transparency in visible and near infrared light.1–3 Sol–gel methods, which involve the simple application of a precursor solution of ZnO and annealing under ambient conditions, yield uniform and strongly adhesive ZnO films on substrates for organic thin-film devices.4–6 Owing to the above features, sol–gel ZnO films have recently been used in the manufacture of organic electronic and optoelectronic devices as electron transport layer (ETL) materials.7–9 On the other hand, it is necessary to fabricate ZnO on plastic substrates because organic devices based on sol–gel-prepared ZnO films should be flexible and lightweight. However, the sol–gel methods for ZnO film fabrication generally require an annealing temperature (>200 °C) that is higher than the heat resistance temperature of conventional plastic substrates such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET).10,11 To avoid the degradation of the plastic substrates, a sol–gel method with low annealing temperature is required. Although low-temperature sol–gel methods (∼100 °C) for the preparation of ZnO have been reported and the prepared ZnO films show good performance as ETLs in organic optoelectronic devices,12–14 we found that low-temperature-prepared ZnO-based devices have low durability against prolonged photoirradiation.15 This low device durability is caused by the decomposition of organic active layer materials on the low-temperature-prepared ZnO, which has higher photocatalytic activity than the high-temperature-prepared ZnO (∼250 °C). This issue needs to be resolved for the development of durable optoelectronic devices based on organic active layer materials and ZnO. It has been reported that the photocatalytic activity of ZnO can be increased by increasing the number of surface OH groups and the amount of adsorbed water.16 Thus, reducing the number of surface OH groups on low-temperature-prepared ZnO could be the key to developing photodurable organic optoelectronic devices based on ZnO. It has also been reported that metal oxides prepared under high vacuum have oxygen defects,17–19 and so we surmised that thermal annealing in a low-oxygen environment would also reduce the number of surface OH groups on the resulting low-temperature-prepared ZnO film (Fig. 1). We describe herein a novel low-temperature sol–gel method for the preparation of ZnO, which can suppress the photocatalytic activity of the prepared ZnO. The sol–gel method with thermal annealing at 100 °C under gentle vacuum (∼5 × 103 Pa) gave ZnO(ZnOvac) having low photocatalytic activity. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on ZnOvac showed high device durability; the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the OSCs remained as high as 94% even after continuous photoirradiation for 100 h under ambient conditions, which is much higher than that of OSCs based on ZnO prepared in air (ZnOair).

2 Experimental
2.1. Materials
We used zinc acetylacetonate hydrate (Zn(AcAc)2, 99.995%, trace metal basis) as a precursor for the ZnO films. Poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT, average Mw 50000–100000) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) were used as active layer materials, and PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P) was used as a material for the hole transporting layer of i-OSC devices. These materials and 2,2′-[[6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydrodithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d']-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,8-diyl]bis[methylidyne(3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]]bis[propanedinitrile] (ITIC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates (sheet resistance = 10 Ω sq.) and Au (99.99%) were purchased from Furuuchi Chemical Corporation.
2.2. Fabrication of ZnO films
An ITO-coated glass substrate was cleaned by ultrasonication in isopropanol. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared by dissolving Zn(AcAc)2 (9.5 mg) in 2-methoxyethanol (10.0 mL) with 1 drop of acetyl acetone. A ZnO layer was prepared by spin coating of the precursor solution (1000 rpm, 60 s) and subsequent thermal annealing (100 °C) in an air atmosphere for ZnOair or under vacuum (∼5 × 103 Pa) for ZnOvac. For resistance measurements of the ZnO films, an Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (approximately 10−2 Pa) through a metal mask.
2.3. Fabrication of OSCs based on ZnO films
An o-dichlorobenzene (ODB) solution of the active materials (regioregular P3HT and PCBM, 1.25:1, 30 g L−1) was spin-coated onto the prepared ITO/ZnO substrate at 700 rpm for 40 s. After the spin coating, the resulting film (thickness; ca. 200 nm) was solvent-annealed for 40 min in a closed container with ODB. A PEDOT:PSS (Clevios® P) hole transporting layer was fabricated by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 60 s with a patterned surface protective film (Nitto Denko Corporation, E-MASK TP200). An Au electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (approximately 10−2 Pa) through a metal mask (active area: 0.1 cm2). Finally, the device was covered with a sealing film (Cellel, Kureha Extech). All fabrication steps except the Au deposition step were performed in air (relative humidity: ∼30%).
The J–V characteristics of the device were measured under simulated solar illumination (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) from a solar simulator based on a 150 W Xe lamp. The light source was a SAN-EI Electric XES-40S1 solar simulator, which was calibrated with a standard silicon photovoltaic detector. The J–V measurements were performed under ambient conditions. The active area of the device was defined by using a 0.1 cm2 photo mask. The photo-durability testing was performed under continuous photo-irradiation (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2). Environmental conditions of the photo-stability testing are the same as the condition of ISOS-L-1 (laboratory simulations, temperature: ambient and relative humidity: ambient).20
2.4. Analytical measurements
ATR-IR spectra were recorded on an FT/IR-460plus (JASCO Corporation). AFM images were measured with an SII SPI3800N AFM apparatus. Work function values were measured by using a Trek model 320C electrostatic voltmeter with a Kelvin probe unit. XPS analysis was performed by using a Shimadzu AXIS-ULTRA DLDXPS apparatus. AC-impedance measurements were carried out using an E4980A precision LCR meter (Agilent) under simulated sunlight irradiation. The frequency range was from 20 Hz to 1 MHz, the alternating signal magnitude was 5 mV and DC bias was 0 V. The data obtained were fitted with Scribner Associates Z-VIEW software v3.1 using the appropriate equivalent circuits. Water contact angles were observed using a DMs-200 (Kyowa Interface Science Co. Ltd).
3 Results and discussion
Low-temperature-prepared ZnO films were obtained by the thermal annealing of Zn(AcAc)2 precursor films at 100 °C for 60 minutes, as previously reported.15 First, we investigated the effects of annealing under gentle vacuum (∼5 × 103 Pa) on the resulting ZnO films and compared the properties of ZnOair with those of ZnOvac. The generation of ZnO from Zn(AcAc)2 was confirmed by attenuated total reflection infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2). The absorption signals at 1590 and 1542 cm−1, which are assigned to the carbonyl bonds of the acetylacetone ligands, became a broad peak around 1600 cm−1, which is assigned to Zn–O bonds, after thermal annealing of the precursor film at 100 °C. In the case of the film annealed under gentle vacuum (∼5 × 103 Pa) at 100 °C for 60 minutes, the ATR-IR spectrum of the resulting film showed a broad signal at 1600 cm−1, which indicates that ZnO is generated in a low-oxygen environment. It seems that the gentle vacuum condition per se did not promote the conversion of Zn(AcAc)2 into ZnO because the IR signals at 1590 and 1542 cm−1 were observed in the ATR-IR spectrum of the film obtained by annealing under gentle vacuum (5 × 103 Pa) with slight heating at 50 °C for 60 minutes. In addition, we found that an annealing time of 5 minutes is sufficient to obtain ZnO; the ATR-IR spectrum of the film annealed at 100 °C for 5 minutes is similar to that of the film annealed at 100 °C for 60 minutes, suggesting that the formation of ZnO is completed within 5 minutes. This short annealing time of the sol–gel method is advantageous for use in mass-production processes such as the roll-to-roll process.

The work function, water contact angle, thickness, and electrical resistance of ZnOair and ZnOvac are summarized in Table 1. Kelvin probe measurements show that ZnOair and ZnOvac films have the same work function (4.4 eV), and the work function of ZnOvac film does not differ even when the annealing time is 5 minutes. These results are good for comparing the properties of devices based on ZnOair and ZnOvac because ZnO films with different work function values may result in distinct electronic properties of the resulting devices.21,22 The electrical resistance value of ZnOvac films is slightly higher than that of ZnOair film (ZnOvac: ca. 38 Ω, ZnOair: ca. 32 Ω, Fig. S1†), and this difference may be related to the density of ZnO films. The thickness value of ZnOvac films is also slightly larger than that of ZnOair film (ZnOvac: ca. 13 nm, ZnOair: ca. 11 nm), which indicates that the density of ZnOvac films is slightly lower than that of ZnOair film. The short annealing time (5 minutes) of ZnOvac has a negligible effect on the electrical resistance and thickness values. These results indicate that the properties of ZnOair and ZnOvac films are not vastly different. However, the surface conditions of the films are different; water contact angle measurements show marked differences in the surface energies of ZnOair and ZnOvac (ZnOvac: ca. 74°, ZnOair: ca. 36°, Fig. S2†). This suggests that a large number of oxygen defects are present on the ZnOvac film surface compared with the ZnOair film surface. The ZnOair and ZnOvac films were further studied by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements (Fig. 3). The XPS spectra of both films contain a symmetric spectral component of Zn 2p3/2 (ca. 1021 eV) and two spectral components of O 1s that are fitted by Gaussian/Lorentzian deconvolution at 530.3 and 531.8 eV, and are similar to the XPS spectra of reported sol–gel ZnO films.15,23 The peak corresponding to Zn 2p3/2 of ZnOvac is slightly shifted (0.2 eV) relative to that of ZnOair, and the ratios of the spectral area of O 1s of ZnOair and ZnOvac are different; the integral-area ratios of the peak at 531.8 eV to that at 530.3 eV were calculated to be 0.79 and 0.96 for ZnOair and ZnOvac, respectively. These spectral characteristics of ZnOvac are similar to the reported XPS spectral characteristics of oxygen-deficient ZnO.24 Although it is difficult to confirm that the oxygen defects in ZnOvac are mainly found on the surface as depicted in Fig. 1 because the thickness of ZnO is similar to the sampling depth in XPS measurements (∼9 nm),25 these results offer solid evidence that ZnOvac contains more oxygen defects than ZnOair, as suggested by the water contact angle measurement.

ZnOair and ZnOvac films prepared by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 5 minutes were utilized as ETLs in OSC devices, and the device photodurability and the photocatalytic activity of ZnOair and ZnOvac in the devices were examined. We have developed photodurable OSCs based on ZnO; PCE of up to 95% was sustained even after continuous photoirradiation for 100 h under ambient conditions, although those devices required a high annealing temperature (250 °C) for preparing ZnO films.15,26–28 To clarify the difference of the effects of ZnOair and ZnOvac on device durability, OSCs having the same structure and prepared from the same materials (ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Au/barrier film) were used because the photostability of the OSC materials can be guaranteed except for the photodecomposition caused by ZnOair/ZnOvac. Moreover, P3HT and PCBM are relatively cheap and readily available active layer materials, which means both materials are useful for mass production of OSCs.29,30 As expected from the similar thin-film properties of ZnOair and ZnOvac, OSCs based on ZnOair and ZnOvac show similar PCE values and photovoltaic properties (Fig. 4a, Table S1†). On the other hand, the photodurability of the ZnOvac-based OSC device is higher than that of the ZnOair-based one (ratio of PCE value after photoirradiation for 100 h (PCE100h) to the maximum PCE value (PCEmax) for the ZnOvac-based device: 0.94, and that for ZnOair-based device: 0.74, Fig. 4b). This is mainly due to the difference in the stability of the short-circuit current density (JSC) values plotted against the photoirradiation time (Fig. S3 to S5†). The higher photodurability of ZnOvac-based devices than ZnOair-based ones may be due to the lower photocatalytic activity of ZnOvac thanks to the smaller number of OH groups on the ZnOvac film surface. We confirmed the low photocatalytic activity of ZnOvac by conducting alternating current (AC)-impedance measurements of the OSC devices (Fig. 5). From the obtained Nyquist plots (Fig. 5a and b), we estimated the equivalent circuits that connect one resistance and two parallel circuits of resistance and capacitance and recognized separately the resistance values of the ZnO layer (RZnO) and the active layer (RACTIV) (Fig. 5c). As regards our photodurable inverted OSCs, it has been revealed that RACTIV values increase as a result of decomposition of active layer materials by the photocatalytic activity of the ZnO layers during continuous photoirradiation.15 We conducted AC-impedance measurements during photoirradiation for 100 h and compared changes in the RACTIV values of the ZnOvac- and ZnOair-based OSCs during the photodurability test. The RACTIV values of the ZnOair-based device increased with photoirradiation time, whereas the RACTIV values of the ZnOvac-based device hardly changed (Fig. 5d). These results indicate that the photocatalytic activity of low-temperature-prepared ZnO is suppressed by fabricating under gentle vacuum and the resulting ZnO-based devices show improved photodurability. Moreover, we investigated the photodecomposition of a non-fullerene acceptor, which is a component of state-of-the-art high-performance OSC devices, on ZnOvac films because many researchers have pointed out that non-fullerene acceptors can be decomposed by the photocatalytic reactions on ZnO films.31–33 ITIC (Fig. 6a), a representative non-fullerene acceptor material, was utilized for this experiment, and a simple device with ITIC sandwiched by electrodes with an ETL or a hole-transporting layer (Fig. 6b, ITO/ZnO/ITIC (20 nm)/PEDOT:PSS/Au) was used to clarify the photodecomposition of ITIC on ZnOvac and ZnOair. Changes in the Nyquist plots and the resistance values of the ITIC layers on the ZnOvac- and ZnOair-based devices under continuous photoirradiation are shown in Fig. 6c–f. The resistance values of the ITIC layers increased with photoirradiation time for the ZnOair-based devices, whereas the resistance of ITIC did not change so much for the ZnOvac-based devices. These results suggest that ZnOvac is suitable for the fabrication of photodurable non-fullerene OSCs with high photovoltaic performance.

4 Conclusion
We reported the low-temperature preparation of ZnO by the sol–gel method under gentle vacuum (∼5 × 103 Pa). The low-temperature-prepared ZnOvac exhibits lower photocatalytic activity than the ZnOair. The ZnOvac films were utilized as ETLs of OSC devices, and those devices showed similar photovoltaic properties to ZnOair-based devices. The photodurability, for 100 h under ISOS-L-1 conditions, of the ZnOvac-based OSCs was much higher than that of the ZnOair-based ones. The low-temperature sol–gel method under gentle vacuum could be suitable for the preparation of ZnOvac for use in the fabrication of lightweight and flexible photodurable organic thin-film devices. It was also revealed that the photodecomposition of ITIC, a high-performance non-fullerene acceptor material, by the photocatalytic reaction was suppressed by using ZnOvac. In this study, we did not fabricate non-fullerene OSCs composed of ZnOvac, nor did we examine the effectiveness of ZnOvac for improving the photodurability on the non-fullerene OSCs because there are several yet unexplained photodecomposition pathways in high-performance non-fullerene OSCs that have made it difficult to discuss the photodecomposition of ITIC in the non-fullerene OSCs.34,35 Nevertheless, the photodurability test of the non-fullerene acceptor on ZnOvac provided important results for the development of photodurable OSCs with high photovoltaic performance. Further studies and development of photodurable OSCs based on low-temperature-prepared ZnO are underway in our laboratory.
