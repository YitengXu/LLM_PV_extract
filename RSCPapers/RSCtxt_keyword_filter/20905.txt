    , Accepted 13th May 2015First published on 13th May 2015AbstractThree amino-functionalized fluorene oligomers with different solubility were developed as cathode interfacial materials for inverted polymer solar cells (I-PSCs). By side chain design, we solved the interface layer erosion problem for I-PSCs, and the devices exhibit a power conversion efficiency as high as 8.94%.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn great attention owing to their potential applications in light-weight, flexible, and large-area devices through low-cost solution processing.1–5 A typical architecture for PSCs is a sandwich structure, where the photoactive materials are sandwiched between the anode and the cathode. In addition to new material design and morphology optimization of the photoactive layer,6–9 interface engineering of BHJ solar cells is fundamentally important to enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE). With the PCE exceeding 9%,10–16 the stability, especially in a moist atmosphere, becomes a key issue for their application. The inverted PSCs (I-PSCs), consisting of an active layer between the ITO bottom cathode and the high-work-function (WF) metal (Al, Ag, Au, etc.) top anode, offer an advantageous approach given the long-term device stability.17,18 But a bare ITO exhibits inferior performance because the high WF of the ITO cathode (∼4.7 eV) hinders the ohmic contact with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene derivatives, reducing the open-circuit voltage (Voc). To overcome this problem, an electron transport layer (ETL) inserted between ITO and the photoactive layer is necessary.
In recent years, a number of inorganic interlayers, including metal oxides (e.g., ZnO,19,20 TiO2,21,22etc.) and metal salts (CsF,23 Cs2CO3,24 C17H35COOCs,25etc.), have been proven to be effective in improving electron extraction properties of I-PSCs. Alternatively, organic polymeric/small molecular interlayer materials have also attracted great attention for I-PSCs, mainly due to their solution processability and excellent ITO modification properties.26–30 Especially, amine-functional interface materials always have excellent interface modification. For example, solution-processed polyfluorene (PFN) yielded a maximum PCE of 9.2% in an inverted device.10 However, some organic molecules, including small molecules and polymers, have similar solubility with the active layer, which is generally dissolved in dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) or chlorobenzene (CB).8,31–34 When spin-coating the photoactive layer, the interface layer could be washed away35 or could lead to interface mixing, which may exert negative influence on I-PSCs.36 In addition, orthogonal solvent processability of an interlayer material is critical for constructing multilayer devices via all-solution processes. As we know, quaternization is an effective method to adjust the solubility of amine compounds to overcome solvent erosion, but it sometimes results in worse efficiency.37,38 Furthermore, quaternization leads to stronger hydrophilicity, which always has an adverse effect on the surface morphology of the active layer.39 Recently, our group also demonstrated the beneficial effect of hydrophobic ETL in I-PSCs with organic small molecule interlayer materials.30,40
Actually, small molecules are more attractive because of their several intrinsic advantages over the conjugated polymer. They are synthesized easily without complex C–C coupling and polymerization, and are easy to purify. Besides, they are monodisperse in nature with a well-defined chemical structure without end group contaminants and have better batch-to-batch reproducibility.
Considering the problems mentioned above, in this context, we designed three oligomeric fluorene cathode interlayers with neutral amino as the pendant group, which can form the desired interfacial dipole with the ITO substrate, thus reducing the WF of ITO to significantly improve the charge-collection efficiency leading to high performance I-PSCs.41 In addition, for the sake of adjusting the solubility of the interface layer materials in chlorobenzene, which are typically used to process the upper photoactive layer, we modified different pendant groups on the fluorene in the middle of the molecule. Finally, we obtained tertiary amine–carboxylic ester, tertiary amine–carboxyl, and tertiary amine–carboxylic potassium salt mixed compounds, instead of quaternization. So we could not only maintain the efficient interface modification of the neutral molecule, but also solve the interlayer solvent erosion problem.
The three small molecules, possessing similar structures, are shown in Fig. 1a. The synthetic procedures and experimental details are given in the ESI† (Scheme S1). TFN2COOtBu was synthesized through a Suzuki coupling reaction, then TFN2COOH was obtained by ester decomposition of TFN2COOtBu in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), and TFN2COOK was synthesized by an acid-base neutralization reaction from TFN2COOH. These three new compounds were fully characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and high resolution mass spectrometry (ESI). All the analytical data are consistent with the proposed structure. All of them have good solubility in methanol, but with the pendant groups changing from carboxylic ester to carboxyl and then carboxylic acid potassium, their solubility in CB varies from easily soluble to insoluble. The three molecules were applied as cathode interlayers in I-PSCs, using an active layer of poly[4,8-bis-(2-ethylhexyloxyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]-dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-ethylhexyl-3-uorothithieno[3,4-b]-thiophene-2-carboxy-late-4,6-diyl] (PTB7, Fig. 1c) and [6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, Fig. 1c).

The cyclic voltammograms (CV) of TFN2COOtBu, TFN2COOH, and TFN2COOK are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), their lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are estimated, respectively, to be −2.47 eV, −2.37 eV and −2.30 eV. From the onset oxidation potential, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels are estimated to be −5.62 eV, −5.52 eV and −5.64 eV, respectively. Their absorption spectra are also provided in Fig. S2a (ESI†). In methanol, the absorption spectra are dominated by characteristic π–π* transitions and resemble each other, the absorption maxima are located at about 350 nm. While in solid films, TFN2COOH exhibits more prominent shoulder peaks for longer wavelengths, indicating stronger π–π stacking interaction between fluorene rings in different molecules.42,43 The optical band gaps (Eoptg) for the TFN2COOtBu, TFN2COOH, and TFN2COOK solutions are 3.19, 3.18, and 3.18 eV respectively, which are consistent with the electrochemical band gaps (ECVg). Their absorption data, HUMO energies, and LUMO energies are summarized in Table S1 (see ESI†).
The primary requirement of interlayers lies in their ability to produce large interfacial dipoles that induce a vacuum-level shift which can modify the work function (WF) of the electrode.44 To understand this, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was used to probe the electronic properties of the three oligomeric fluorene interlayers. Fig. S3 (ESI†) displays the results of UPS measurement for bare ITO and ITOs modified with different interlayers. The work function was 4.31 eV for a bare ITO substrate while it was 3.93 eV, 3.71 eV, and 3.64 eV for TFN2COOtBu, TFN2COOH, and TFN2COOK-coated ITO substrate, respectively. As they have the same pendant amine groups and main chain, oligofluorene, the difference in work function among them is related to the different polarities of carboxylic ester, carboxyl, and carboxylic potassium salt on the side chain.45 As is known, the polarities of carboxylic ester, carboxyl, and carboxylic potassium salt increase successively, resulting in the increase of their dipole moment, which is consistent with the variation tendency of the WF. Obviously, the WF of the ITO decreased from 4.31 to 3.64–3.93 eV when the amino-functionalized interlayers were applied. As low work function values of interlayer/ITO cathodes allow them to form ohmic contacts with the fullerene acceptor, these interlayer materials are suitable to obtain high Voc values in I-PSCs. The lowered WF values of interlayer/ITO cathodes could also increase the built-in field, which is beneficial to charge extraction efficiency and reduce recombination losses.46
In order to investigate the erosion problem of the interlayers, the absorption spectra of their films on quartz before and after washing with CB were recorded to examine whether they have been washed away (Fig. S2, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S2b (ESI†), TFN2COOtBu had only about 9% absorption left after washing with chlorobenzene, which means more than 90% of the film had been washed away. In contrast, the absorptions of TFN2COOH and TFN2COOK films did not change after CB treatment (Fig. S2c and S2d, ESI†), from which we can infer that washing with CB did not change the thickness of their films.
Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to study the surface morphologies of films with and without CB washing. Fig. 2 compares the surface morphologies of TFN2COOtBu, TFN2COOH, and TFN2COOK films before and after washing with CB. It is easy to see that the surface of TFN2COOtBu changed completely after washing with CB, which was finally proved to be almost the bare ITO. But for TFN2COOH and TFN2COOK, no obvious change in the surface morphology was observed, the root-mean-square (RMS) without CB washing is 1.98 nm and 3.20 nm, respectively. After treatment, RMS changed to 2.12 nm and 3.35 nm, respectively. The surface morphology results matched well with their solubility and previous absorption spectra measurement. Thus, there is no need to worry about the solvent erosion problem for the I-PSCs with TFN2COOH and TFN2COOK as interlayers.

To investigate the interfacial modification effect of the three compounds as cathode interlayers on I-PSCs, a PTB7:PC71BM blend was used as the photoactive layer with an ITO/interlayer/PTB7:PC71BM/MoO3/Al device configuration. The cathode interlayers were prepared by spin-coating the methanol solution on the ITO substrate.
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices under illumination of AM 1.5G, 1000 W m−2 are shown in Fig. 3a, and the Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE values are summarized in Table 1. The corresponding EQE spectra are also provided in Fig. 3b. The devices using TFN2COOtBu as the interface layer exhibited a moderate PCE of 8.28%, with a Jsc of 15.45 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.75 V, and an FF of 71.39%. For the devices with a TFN2COOH interlayer, the PCE reached a higher value of 8.94%, a Jsc of 15.86 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, and an FF of 73.72%. The device with a TFN2COOK buffer layer exhibited a relatively lower PCE of 8.08%, a Jsc of 15.13 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.76 V, and an FF of 70.76%. Apparently, although they have such different solubility in CB, all these devices with the three interface materials showed simultaneously enhanced Voc, Jsc, and FF relative to the bare ITO electrode device, which led to significantly improved device performance. It should be ascribed to the presence of the functional amine group. From the abovementioned UPS result, we know that the WF values of the ITOs modified with these materials were largely lowered, which matched well with the fairly high Voc values. In addition, the amino groups in PFN side chains were recently found to be hole-trapping centres that can act as effective hole-blocking layers,47 which can optimize the rectification ratio and reduce the carrier recombination. Thus, enhanced FFs and Jsc for all devices were achieved, which also accounted for the high PCEs.

The wetting properties of the cathodic interlayers were also tested. Contact angle measurements were performed on different surfaces with drops of water. As shown in Fig. 4, the contact angles of water on ITO/TFN2COOtBu, ITO/TFN2COOH, and ITO/TFN2COOK surfaces are 76.58°, 71.32°, and 44.98°, respectively. The larger water contact angles of ITO/TFN2COOtBu and ITO/TFN2COOH indicate that TFN2COOtBu and TFN2COOH are more hydrophobic than TFN2COOK. Hydrophobic surfaces have been proven to be beneficial for the spreading of the photoactive solution in our previous work, and consequently better morphology and interpenetrating networks were achieved.30,40 The relatively poor hydrophobicity of TFN2COOK leads to a poor morphology and interpenetrating networks of the upper organic active layer.39 Finally, the I-PSC with TFN2COOK displayed a little lower Jsc and FF when compared with TFN2COOtBu and TFN2COOH. As a result, TFN2COOH achieved a balance between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. Thus, in an I-PSC with a TFN2COOH interlayer we realized high performance and solved the interlayer solvent erosion problem at the same time.

In conclusion, three amino-functionalized fluorene oligomer cathode interlayers, with carboxylic ester (TFN2COOtBu), carboxylic acid (TFN2COOH) and carboxylic acid potassium salt (TFN2COOK) as pendant groups to adjust their solubility in CB, are developed for high performance I-PSCs, and all of them exhibited outstanding interfacial modification. Importantly, by introducing an additional carboxyl group to adjust the wetting properties, we realized a high PCE of 8.94% and simultaneously solved the interlayer solvent erosion problem.
