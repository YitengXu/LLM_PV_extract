    , Accepted 27th August 2021First published on 30th August 2021AbstractThis is the first review paper focusing on acenaphthylene (AN), an important building block of many organic semiconductors. We summarize the most important literature on π-conjugated AN derivatives, both small molecules and polymers, highlighting the synthetic approach and notable chemical modifications used in design of organic electronic materials. We also discuss the electronic structure and aromaticity of AN and notable device applications of AN derivatives. We expect this review to guide the further design of AN-based organic semiconductors for various optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Organic semiconductors (OSCs) have attracted significant attention for low-cost, printable, flexible electronics,1 including organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),2 organic photovoltaics (OPVs),3 and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs).4 Most important and widely investigated OSCs for organic electronics consist of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).5–8 The extended π-electron conjugation of PAHs leads to low reorganization energy for charge hopping; their planar structures favor tight packing with strong electron coupling between adjacent molecules.
Cyclopentannulated PAHs possess some unique properties that arise from their non-alternant electronic structures. Acenaphthylene (AN) is the basic building block of cyclopentannulated PAHs for notable OSCs with high electron affinity, including corannulenes9,10 and buckminsterfullerene.11 The chemistry of ANs has been studied since the early 1900s,12,13 but their application in organic electronics (not counting fullerenes) is quite recent. The first OLED study of AN-based emitter (decacyclene) was reported in 2001,14 followed by the first report of OPV (also with decacyclene as an acceptor) in 200715 and p-type OFETs (with fluoranthene derivatives) in 2008.16
To our knowledge, there are no reviews focusing on AN and AN-based OSCs, even though the properties of some AN derivatives, including corannulene,10 sumanene,17,18 and cyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene,19 have been reviewed before. A very comprehensive review of AN chemistry and its derivatives has been published in 1966 in a Russian book that is not easily accessible.20 Here, we summarize the important recent studies of AN-based OSCs while also giving the historic perspective of the AN chemistry. The review highlights the synthetic approaches for derivatization of AN and its incorporation in extended π-electron structures (Scheme 1). It also covers N-/S-heterocyclic AN derivatives, and AN-based conjugated polymers.

2. Synthetic approaches to AN-based OSCs
2.1 Acenaphthene derivatization reactions
Most synthetic routes to AN derivatives start from acenaphthene (ANH, Scheme 2). ANH was separated from coal tar and the related substitution/oxidation reactions were developed rapidly in the early 1900s.21 The synthetic strategies of ANH derivatization can be categorized into substitution, oxidation, and annulation.
 Scheme 2  ANH derivatization via electrophilic substitution. 
The electrophilic aromatic substitution of ANH preferentially occurs at positions 5 (major) and 3 (minor).22 For disubstitution, steric interactions of the substituents in 5,6-positions (dC5⋯C6 = 2.54 Å) may affect the reaction: the yield of dibromo 1 is lower than that of dichloro 2, because a steric repulsion of the large Br group leads to formation of other regioisomers (at 3,5/3,6-positions).23 For the same reason, 5,6-diiodo 4 cannot be prepared by direct iodination, and its synthesis requires multiple steps: nitration of 5-iodo 3, followed by reduction to the amine, diazotization, and the substitution of the diazonium group with iodine.24 Friedel–Crafts alkylation of ANH with bulky tert-butyl groups forms the least sterically encumbered 4,7-di-tert-butyl 5.25 Only one regioisomer 5 was observed, even though single tert-butylation of ANH can occur at either position 3 or 4.25 The exclusive formation of 5 is a result of AlCl3-catalyzed migration of the first t-Bu group in the ring to the most stable (sterically unencumbered) product.
The halogenated ANHs 1 and 2 have been used as intermediates for further functionalizations, such as cyanation (6),26 and dichalcogen bridging (7–8).27 Anhydride 9 and dicarboxyimide 10 were obtained by Friedel–Crafts acylation of ANH with N,N-dimethylcarbamoylchloride, followed by hydrolysis and imidation.28
The benzylic carbons of ANH can be selectively oxidized to carbonyl groups (Scheme 3). Monoketone 11 has been prepared using ceric ammonium nitrate,29 potassium permanganate,30 and sodium dichromate31 oxidants. A combination of sodium hypochlorite with tert-butylhydroperoxide (TBHP) was used to produce diketone 12 under mild conditions without toxic metals.32 These oxidation reactions have also been applied to many substituted ANHs producing useful electron-deficient building blocks, such as dibromo 13,33,34 dicyano 14,35 dicarboxyimide 15–16,36,37 whose oxidation state can be controlled by the amount of CrO3.
 Scheme 3  ANH oxidation reactions. 
The formed mono- and diketones are particularly useful as intermediates for various condensation reactions extending the π-conjugation of the AN moiety (Scheme 4). For example, aldol self-condensation of 11 under acid catalysis has been used to synthesize dimer 17,38 trimer 18 (decacyclene),38 and tetramer 19.39 The yields of AN cyclotrimerization vary widely depending on the AN structures and the reaction conditions, as studied in details by Scott and co-workers.38 Poor solubility of the dimer typically ‘arrests’ the further condensation; the reaction temperature (>100 °C), the solvent and the acidity of the catalyst often need to be optimized depending on the substituents.

Double Knoevenagel condensation of 12 with aliphatic ketones produces substituted cyclopentadienone-ANs (20),40 which are important intermediates for Diels–Alder reactions to produce π-extended 2141 and substituted fluoranthene 22.40 Also, condensation of 12 and diamines forms electron-deficient pyrazines 2342 and 24.43
2.2 Acene cyclopentannulation
The AN moiety can be embedded in acenes by metal-catalyzed cyclopentannulation of substituted acenes. These transformations have already been reviewed by Yamamoto and co-workers44 and here we give only a brief summary of the explored synthetic routes highlighting the design space of AN-containing semiconductors (Scheme 5). A Pd-catalyzed one-step reaction of halogenated naphthalenes and anthracenes with disubstituted alkynes has been used to prepare a series of AN derivatives (25–27).45–48 The efficient DDQ-promoted aromatization (yield: 82–88%) of a stable octahydro derivative (with anthracene conjugated core) has been used to prepare a π-extended pentacene derivative 28.48 Alternatively, cyclopentannulation of halogenated acenes could be achieved by Pd-catalyzed Sonogashira coupling with monosubstituted alkynes followed by intramolecular cyclization, in a one-pot process (29–31).49–51 Other Pd-catalyzed two-step one-pot approaches to fluoranthene-containing acenes include Suzuki (32–34)52 and Kumada (35)53 phenylation followed by intramolecular Heck cyclization. Also, FeCl3-promoted Scholl cyclization on phenylated tetracene and pentacene has been used to prepare fluoranthene-containing 3654 and 37.55 A series of π-extended fluoranthenes has been prepared from dialkynylnaphthalene by Rh-catalyzed [(2+2)+2] cycloadditions with alkynes (38) and AN (39),56 or by Pd-catalyzed coupling with iodobenzene (40) or diiodonaphthalene (41).57

3. π-Electron structure of ANs
The π-electron structure of AN is best described as a combination of an aromatic 10π-electron naphthalene moiety and a 2π-electron vinylene bridge. The X-ray crystallography suggests a strong π-conjugation between the two moieties: the vinylene CC bond is elongated (1.395 Å vs. 1.34 Å for non-conjugated CC), and the adjacent C–C bonds are shortened (1.466 Å vs. 1.54 Å for typical C–C).58 The X-ray crystallography also shows a substantial valence bond angle strain in the AN five-membered ring (106–109° vs. the unstrained 120° for sp2 hybridized atoms)59 which is even larger than the corresponding strain in ANH (110–111° for sp2 and 105° for sp3).60 However, the strain energy deduced from the heat of combustion of AN (∼2 kcal mol−1) is lower than that of ANH (6–7 kcal mol−1), likely due to stabilization of the former by π-conjugation.61 Analysis of the nucleus independent chemical shifts (NICS) shows both six-membered rings in AN (NICS(0) = −8.6 ppm) having similar aromaticity to those in naphthalene (NICS(0) = −9.9 ppm) while the five-membered ring is slightly anti-aromatic (NICS(0) = 2.9 ppm) (Fig. 1a).62 Also, most of the aromatic ring current in AN is localized on the naphthalene moiety (Fig. 1a).63

The antiaromaticity of pyracylene 42 (Fig. 1b) has been invoked in explaining the strong upfield shift in its 1H NMR signals (δ = 6.52 and 6.01 ppm).64 In principle, its π-electron structure can be presented as: (1) an aromatic 10π-electron naphthalene unit with two 2π-electron vinylene bridges, or (2) an anti-aromatic 12π-electron outer ring with an extra π-bond in the center. The X-ray crystallography supports the latter hypothesis: the antiaromatic destabilization leads to the greater C–C/CC bond alternation (1.492 and 1.346 Å) in the five-membered rings,65 comparing with AN. The enthalpy of hydrogenation of pyracylene is also at the boundary of aromaticity/anti-aromaticity within the experimental errors, while the related calculations suggest weak anti-aromaticity.66 The NICS(0) value shows strong anti-aromaticity (12.8 ppm) in the five-membered rings, and the six-membered rings are essentially non-aromatic (−0.1 ppm) (Fig. 1b).62 The antiaromaticity of the five-membered rings is also illustrated by strong paratropic ring current (Fig. 1b).63 A two-electron reduction of pyracylene to a 14π-electrons dianion is manifested in a strong diatropic ring current in the five-membered rings due to their stabilization as aromatic cyclopentadiene anions (Fig. 2a).67 Such gain of aromaticity explains a relatively high electron affinity of pyracylene-containing structure such as C60,5 comparing to benzenoid PAHs.

An interesting variation of the AN electronic structure is provided by the recently revisited acepleiadylene 43.68 Similar to the well-known case of azulene, the combination of five- and seven-membered rings stabilizes a fully aromatic zwitterionic resonance structure (Fig. 2b) and gives rise to an unusual (for PAH of such size) red color to the molecule (optical gap ∼560 nm, ∼2.2 eV).
The π-electron structure of fluoranthene 32 is less ambiguous and consists of aromatic naphthalene and benzene moieties. The X-ray crystallography suggests a limited conjugation between these two moieties: the C–C bond between them (1.476 Å) is slightly longer than the related C–C bonds (1.466 Å) in AN.69 The NICS(0) values of the naphthalene and benzene moieties show their aromaticity (−7.38 and −6.23 ppm, respectively), but the five-membered ring is anti-aromatic (4.98 ppm) (Fig. 1c).70 The aromatic current density clearly exhibits disjoint ring currents between naphthalene and benzene moieties (Fig. 1c).63
The extension of π-conjugation in the AN series is also apparent from their electronic absorption spectra. The absorption onset undergoes a progressive redshift from naphthalene 44 (295 nm, Eoptg 4.20 eV) to AN (345 nm, 3.59 eV), fluoranthene 32 (390 nm, 3.18 eV), and pyracylene 42 (480 nm, 2.58 eV) (Fig. 3).65,71 The non-incrementally large redshift of pyracylene is notable and is likely related to its peculiar electronic structure. Our own DFT calculations (B3LYP/6-31G(d)) also reproduce this experimental trend (HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.92 eV for AN and 2.84 eV for pyracylene).

4. Carbocyclic ANs
Fluoranthene (32), the parent of most carbocyclic AN derivatives (Fig. 4), was isolated from coal tar in 1878;72 its chemistry has been widely studied since the 1940s.73,74 As mentioned above, the absorption onset of fluoranthene is extended to ∼375 nm (Eoptg = 3.30 eV), comparing with AN (345 nm, 3.59 eV). The effect of further π-extension in fluoranthene derivatives 45 strongly depends on the position of benzannulation. As expected from the Clar's (disjoint sextets) rule,75 the anthracene derivative 45d shows the most redshifted absorption, and its Eoptg (2.36 eV) is significantly lower than that of phenanthrene 45a (2.99 eV) (Fig. 5).76 However, the smaller but still significant redshift of 45c (Eoptg 2.61 eV) vs.45b (2.88 eV) is less intuitive but is in-line with DFT predictions (HOMO–LUMO gap of 3.46 and 3.68 eV, respectively).

Although the unsubstituted AN has an extremely low photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) (<10−4),77 fluoranthene 32 shows a modest PLQY of 0.3 (in cyclohexane solution).7845b exhibits the highest PLQY, close to 1, in this series (0.53 for 45a, 0.07 for 45c, and 0.12 for 45d in n-heptane).76 However, its solid-state luminescence is suppressed by severe aggregation-induced quenching. Bulky substituents on fluoranthene can suppress such effect, and triphenyl fluoranthene 46 shows a high PLQY (0.51) in solid films.7946 was used in OLEDs by Wudl et al.,79 followed by a number of other phenyl-substituted fluoranthene derivatives 47,8048,81 and related dimers 4982 and 5083,84 developed as OLED materials.
The extension of π-conjugation lowers the LUMO and raises the HOMO levels. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) of 47a, its linked (47b) and fused dimer (47c) demonstrate multiple reversible redox waves with decreasing oxidation/increasing reduction potentials in this series (Fig. 6).85 The consequent contraction of the electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gap is particularly pronounced in the fused derivative 47c, which shows a greatly redshifted absorption onset to 590 nm (2.05 eV), comparing with 47a (2.99 eV) and 47b (2.69 eV).85,86 The HOMO/LUMO level can be further manipulated by introducing electron-deficient (or electron-rich) groups in the fluoranthene core. This approach has been used to prepare n-type OSCs with imide-fused 51–53.87–89 The π-stacking interactions of 53b in solution bring about formation of crystalline microfibers. These microfibers have been used to prepare bottom-gate top-contact OFETs with remarkable electron mobility μe = 1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1 (the highest among AN derivatives).89 In addition, imide-fused 54a–b90 exhibit very low LUMO (−4.04 and −4.03 eV, respectively). Despite different numbers of NDI moieties between 54, their similar LUMO levels suggest a limited conjugation among the π-cores. This is further supported by a pronounced single-bond character of the C–C bonds (1.485 and 1.504 Å) between the NDI and naphthalene moieties observed in 54 by X-ray crystallography.

Recently, the electron-deficient AN-dicarboxyimide moiety was used as a capping group in design of novel acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type non-fullerene acceptors (55).36 Aldol condensation of AN-dicarboxyimide monoketone with dialdehydes affords highly π-extended planar structures with low LUMO (−3.62 for 55a, −3.58 for 55b, and −3.68 eV for 55c). All three derivatives feature a fully co-planar conjugated structure and strong absorptivity in solid films (α > 105 cm−1) with a red edge at ∼700 nm (55a,b) and 750 nm (55c). With the widely-used indacenodithiophene core, 55c revealed a well-balanced hole and electron mobility of 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and its bulk heterojunction solar cells with the common donor polymer PBDB-T achieved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 10.8%.36 Most recently, aldol condensation of dicarboxyimide-substituted AN mono- and diketone was used to prepare planar AN dimers 56 with the notably low LUMO of 4.08 eV (estimated by CV).91 Solution-processed crystalline films of 56 were used to fabricate OFETs, revealing electron mobility of up to 3.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Acene-extended AN derivatives have attracted particular interest. Pentacene 3755 and 2848 (Fig. 4) have been synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of diphenylacene precursor and cyclization of dibromoacene with alkyne, respectively. Fused 37 and 28 demonstrate improved stability with half-life time in solution of several days, comparing to only few hours to their pentacene precursor. Tetracene 57 was synthesized by Diels–Alder reaction of benzofuran and naphthoquinone, followed by Grignard addition, intramolecular dehydration, and then aromatization (Scheme 6).925793 as well as the related rubicene 3494 have fully planar conformations, which result in close π–π stacking (dπ–π = 3.45 for 57 and 3.38 Å for rubicene) in single crystals. Their vacuum-sublimed films are crystalline and reveal reasonably good hole mobilities (μh = 0.01 for 57 and 0.32 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 34). On the other hand, the related 58–5995,96 show distorted conformations that give rise to chirality. 58a crystalizes in a racemic crystal with segregated stacks of M- and P-enantiomers, while 58b forms alternate stacks of M/P-enantiomers (Fig. 7). While 58a forms poorly connected crystallites in dip-coated films showing no conductivity, 58b forms ordered crystalline microfibers and resulted in the record hole mobility μh = 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1 among the AN derivatives.95

Decacyclene 18, the simplest star-shaped fluoranthene derivative, demonstrates a slightly twisted propeller conformation (due to intramolecular H⋯H repulsions); the 1D columnar π-stacks with a chiral space group result in formation of helically twisted crystals (Fig. 8).97 Decacyclene derivative 60 with long-chains alkylimide substituents also forms 1D π-stacks, but crystallizes in perfect hexagonal prisms with an achiral unit cell (Fig. 9).98,99 Due to its highly twisted structure, the AN tetramer 19 has a limited conjugation between its AN moieties. However, the butterfly (alternating up-down-up-down) conformation of 19 results in unique herringbone stacks in single crystals, which is of interest for 3D charge transport in semiconducting devices.39

Decacyclene derivative 61 with fused seven-membered rings was very recently synthesized through Ni-catalyzed cyclotrimerization of dibromoacepleiadylene (which was prepared on multi-gram scale from dibromo-ANH 1).68 The non-alternant electronic structure with azulene-type aromaticity results in low band-gap of 1.98 eV.
Scott and co-workers explored star-shaped AN oligomers as precursors for synthesis of C60 fullerene.100 Flash vacuum pyrolysis of 62 (synthesized through aldol cyclotrimerization of AN monoketones) yields pure C60, albeit in a very low yield (<1%).101 Fasel and co-workers used the related 63 to synthesize the caps of carbon nanotubes by surface-catalyzed cyclodehydrogenation in ultra-high vacuum.102
The reported optoelectronic properties and the device efficiencies of abovementioned carbocyclic ANs are summarized in Table 1.

5. N-Heterocyclic ANs
Condensation of AN-diketones with diamines has been widely employed in preparation of pyrazine-fused AN derivatives including monopyrazines 64,103–105 dipyrazines 65,37,106 and star-shaped tripyrazines 66 (Fig. 10).28 Many pyrazine-extended ANs also incorporate dicarboxyimide moieties resulting in highly electron-deficient molecules (LUMO = −3.33…−4.11 eV) that have been used as ambipolar/n-type OSC in device studies (Table 2). Some of these compounds have been recently reviewed by Shen et al.107

Pyridine-fused 67108 has been synthesized by Friedlaender condensation of AN monoketone with 2,5-dibenzoyl-p-phenylenediamine (Scheme 7). Interestingly, the LUMO of 67 (−3.6 eV) is as low as that of the pyrazine analogous (65a, −3.6 eV) despite fewer electronegative nitrogen atoms in the structure. Pyridine-fused rubicene 68 was synthesized by intramolecular Heck cyclization of quinoline-substituted dichloroanthracene.109 The electron-deficient pyridine moieties result in a significantly lowered LUMO (−3.77 eV) comparing with rubicene (34, −2.54 eV).

Several donor–acceptor ANs (69) have been studied as thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters.110–112 Combination of strong dicyanopyrazine acceptor and carbazole/triphenylamine donor group leads to small singlet–triplet excited-state energy gaps of 0.18 (69a), 0.11 (69b), and 0.14 eV (69c), which enables radiative relaxation of both singlet and triplet states via reverse intersystem crossing. 69b–c emit in the near-infrared (NIR) region (Fig. 11), and have been used to realized NIR OLEDs, in which 69c achieves a notably high EQE of 10.2% in doped devices.

6. S-Heterocyclic ANs
Emeraldicene (70), one of the most-studied S-heterocyclic ANs (Fig. 12), named from its vibrant green color, was synthesized by intramolecular Heck cyclization of dichlorodithienylanthracene in 1999.113 But its optoelectronic properties were not investigated until 2011.114 The introduction of sulfur atoms leads to longer absorption wavelength (690 nm) comparing with rubicene (34, 560 nm),114 while their HOMO levels are similar (−5.30 for 70 and −5.29 eV for 34). Dibenzodithienoparacylene 71, synthesized by intramolecular Scholl cyclization of dithienyltetracene, showed a similar bandgap (1.78 eV) with that of emeraldicene 70 (1.8 eV).115 A series of soluble donor–acceptor emeraldicene derivatives 72 have been recently synthesized as new n-type OSC.116 All three compounds show rather low LUMO (−4.0 eV for dicyanovinylene 72a, −4.2 eV for tricyanovinylene 72b and quinoidal dicyanomethylene 72c) and narrow band-gap (as low as 1.47 for 72c). Their OFETs reveal air-stable n-type behavior with electron mobility of up to 5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 3).

Electron-rich thiophene moieties have been combined with AN-imide groups to prepare several promising A–D–A materials. AN-diimide dithienopyrrole 73a and related benzodithiophene 73b were synthesized by a Pd-catalyzed [3+2] cyclopentannulation of 4-bromo-5-chloronaphthalenedicarboxyimides which include a one-pot Suzuki coupling with corresponding diboronic acids followed by intramolecular Heck cyclization.117 A more electron-rich dithienopyrrole core in 73a results in a narrower bandgap (1.53 eV) comparing with 73b (1.72 eV).
A moderately strong donor 74 has been obtained fusing the AN unit on tetrathiafulvalene (Scheme 8) and its charge-transfer complex with TCNQ has been characterized by optical (new charge-transfer band) and FTIR (characteristic shift of the CN stretch) spectroscopy.31 The related AN dimer 75 with two 13-e phenalene moieties fused to a thiophene ring has been designed to probe its biradical character.118 The interaction of singly occupied molecular orbitals (SOMO) of the phenalenyl radicals leads to a very small HOMO–LUMO gap, which is manifested in a remarkably extended absorption of up to 2000 nm (Eoptg = 0.6 eV).

7. AN-Based polymers
Most of the work of AN-containing polymers has been developed in the last decade, with the main focus on D–A copolymers for OPVs and OFETs (Fig. 13 and Table 4). The first AN-based polymer 76, however, was synthesized in 1970 by Diels–Alder self-polymerization of cyclopentadienone-fused AN.119 Although the poor solubility terminated the polymerization at a low Mn = 1.01 kDa (which corresponds to a ∼trimer), its rigid structure results in a significantly redshifted absorption (by ∼200 nm comparing with the monomer).

More recently, Wudl et al. used Stille polymerizations to prepare low band-gap D–A polymers 77 with absorption spanning beyond 1100 nm (1.13 eV).120 Higher electron-deficiency of the AN-dicarboxyimide unit in a related polymer 78 leads to further reduction of the bandgap to 1.06 eV and very deep LUMO of −3.88 eV.121 The most recent AN-dicarboxyimide D–A polymer 79122 also has low LUMO (−3.51 eV) but a broader bandgap (1.80 eV) comparing with 77–78. 79 has been used as a donor with the non-fullerene A–D–A type acceptor BTP-4F for OPVs achieving the highest reported PCE (15.2%) for AN derivatives.122
The electron-deficient AN-pyrazine unit has also been used to tailor optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers, such as polymers 80 prepared by Stille coupling.123,124 Both the dialkoxy 80a123 and difluoro 80b124 show sufficiently low LUMO levels (−3.57 and −3.78 eV, respectively), but the smaller size of the fluorine substituents has been suggested to improve the interchain π-interactions, explaining the enhanced PCE (4.7%) of 80b, comparing to alkoxy 80a (1.2%). The recently synthesized copolymer 81 incorporates strong electron-deficient thiadiazoloquinoxaline-AN-imide unit significantly lowering the LUMO to −3.85 eV.125 The alternating donor–acceptor structure of 81 results in the very low bandgap of 0.84 eV and ambipolar OFETs with hole and electron mobility of ∼10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been prepared with this polymer. Related low-band-gap copolymers 82 have been synthesized with bis(pyrazino-AN) acceptor and thiophene/bithiophene donor moieties.126 The LUMO in these copolymers (−3.80 for 82a, −3.74 eV for 82b) is only slightly higher than that in 81. The more electron-donating bithiophene unit in 82b brings about a much narrowed bandgap of 0.94 eV comparing with thiophene-linked 82a (1.29 eV). The extended π-structure of the fused bis(pyrazine-AN) promotes inter-chain interactions and remarkable large lamellar crystals have been observed in drop-casted films of 82a after annealing at 250 °C (Fig. 14). These annealed films revealed reasonably high electron mobility of 0.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 in bottom-gate top-contact OFETs.12682a was also used as an acceptor in bulk heterojunction blends with thiazolothiazole-dithienylsilole polymer donor and showed PCE of 2.6%.127

The AN moieties of the above mentioned D–A polymers are placed as the side groups of the polymer backbones, and have limited contribution to the overall π-conjugation. For example, the bandgap of thienopyrazine 83 (1.33 eV)128 is very close to that of an analogous thienopyrazine polymer with two phenyl substituents in place of AN (∼1.3 eV).129 On the other hand, π-conjugation through the AN moiety is realized in an emeraldicene-containing polymer 84 synthesized by Suzuki polymerizations.130,13184a shows a notably narrowed band-gap (1.0 eV) comparing with 84b (1.54 eV).130
A series of polymers 85–87 with AN in the conjugation backbone have been reported by Plunkett et al. Copolymer 85 was prepared by Sonogashira coupling of dibromocyclopenta[hi]aceanthrylene and diethynylfluorene units,132 and a related carbazole-containing copolymer 86 was synthesized by cyclization of the corresponding brominated poly(arylene ethynylene).133 A ladder polymer 87b was synthesized by oxidative Scholl cyclization of non-fused precursor polymer 87a.134 Due to extended π-conjugation, 87b shows shrinking band-gap (1.29 eV) comparing with 87a (1.55 eV).
8. Conclusions
AN chemistry has been explored for over a century, and this review summarizes important AN-based small molecules and polymers including their optoelectronic properties and OSC applications in OLEDs, OPVs, and OFETs. The synthetic approaches to AN functional π-materials are categorized as derivatization, oxidation, condensation, and cyclopentannulation reactions. The molecular design of AN-containing π-structures can be categorized into: (1) non-fused ANs with functional substituents to modify π-stacking, or electron-withdrawing groups to enhance electron affinity; (2) linearly π-extended ANs that can be further divided into fluoranthene-containing derivatives with planar π-cores, and acene-containing derivatives; (3) star-shaped π-extended ANs with chiral/achiral structures. Also, the incorporation of N-/S-heterocycles results in electron-deficient/electron-rich moieties in AN π-systems.
Such chemical and structural modifications enable tuning of optoelectronic behavior of these materials in electronic devices. AN-involving OSCs show the highest electron mobility (μe = 1.75 cm2 V−1 s−1) with NDI-fused 53b crystalline microfibers and the highest hole mobility (μh = 1.0 cm2 V−1 s−1) with rubicene-like 58b crystalline microfibers. The highest PCE (15.2%) is achieved by AN-dicarboxyimide D–A polymer 79 with non-fullerene acceptor, followed by that (10.8%) of A–D–A non-fullerene acceptor 55b with AN-dicarboxyimide end-caps and indacenodithiophene core. We envision that this review will stimulate further development of promising OSCs based on the versatile but underexplored AN building block.
