    , Accepted 15th August 2017First published on 15th August 2017AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic perovskites have recently emerged as one of the most important thin-film solar cell materials owing to their excellent environmental stability. The remaining major pitfall is their relatively poor photovoltaic performance in contrast to 3D perovskites. In this work we demonstrate cesium cation (Cs+) doped 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite solar cells giving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 13.7%, the highest among the reported 2D devices, with excellent humidity resistance. The enhanced efficiency from 12.3% (without Cs+) to 13.7% (with 5% Cs+) is attributed to perfectly controlled crystal orientation, an increased grain size of the 2D planes, superior surface quality, reduced trap-state density, enhanced charge-carrier mobility and charge-transfer kinetics. Surprisingly, it is found that the Cs+ doping yields superior stability for the 2D perovskite solar cells when subjected to a high humidity environment without encapsulation. The device doped using 5% Cs+ degrades only ca. 10% after 1400 hours of exposure in 30% relative humidity (RH), and exhibits significantly improved stability under heating and high moisture environments. Our results provide an important step toward air-stable and fully printable low dimensional perovskites as a next-generation renewable energy source.

Broader context
Ruddlesden–Popper two-dimensional (2D) perovskites as one of the most important solar cell materials have attracted intensive attention. These 2D perovskites exhibit wide tunability of their optoelectronic properties due to their large degrees of freedom in chemistry and quantum mechanics, as well as high environmental stability. However their poor photovoltaic performance has been the most serious bottleneck toward commercialization of the perovskite solar cells. We found that doping cesium (Cs) cations into 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite can help increase the grain size of the 2D planes, improve the surface quality, reduce the trap-state density, enhance the charge-carrier mobility and charge-transfer kinetics, leading to high performance solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 13.7% and negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the doped devices demonstrate amazing tolerance to the external environment and great improvement in thermal stability. Our results provide an important step toward material engineering to address some of the key challenges facing 2D perovskite solar cells.

Introduction
The rapid efficiency advance in the last few years has made the organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite materials a superstar for next-generation thin-film solar cells and optoelectronics.1–3 In particular, 3D methylammonium (MA, CH3NH3) lead iodide (MAPbI3) has demonstrated outstanding properties as a solar cell absorber material, including high extinction coefficient,4 appropriate band gap,5 small exciton binding energy, and long exciton and charge diffusion lengths.6 Tremendous efforts from multiple research groups have propelled the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells to the current world record of 22.1%.7
Unfortunately, these perovskites suffer from poor long-term stability which has hindered the large-scale commercialization of the perovskite solar cells. For instance, MAPbI3 perovskite undergoes a fast degradation upon exposure to moisture.8 This poor stability has been ascribed to the low formation energy and the pronounced hydroscopic nature of MAPbI3.9,10 In fact, even encapsulated devices and films degrade fairly quickly.11,12 This challenge has triggered intensive efforts to develop novel materials that are intrinsically stable. In particular, two-dimensional (2D) AnA′n−1MnY3n+1 perovskites crafted using bulkier organic molecules in place of CH3NH3 were developed for photovoltaics and optoelectronics, e.g., (C4H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1,13,14 (C8H9ONH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnBr3n+1,15 (C8H9NH3)2(CH3NH3)n−1PbnI3n+1,16–18 and NH3C4H9COO(CH3NH3)nPbnBr3n.19 Upon comparison to their 3D counterparts, the layered 2D perovskites offer more tunability of their optoelectronic properties due to their larger degrees of freedom in chemistry and quantum mechanics, and more importantly environmental stability. The increased stability has been attributed to stronger van der Waals interaction between the capping organic molecules and the [PbI6] units, hence more energy would be required to remove organic molecules from the 2D perovskite than from their MAI based 3D-structured counterparts.17 Furthermore, the bulkier organic component is more hydrophobic than the MA+ ions owing to its longer alkyl chain, which is beneficial for improved moisture stability.20 Unfortunately these 2D perovskites suffer from lower photovoltaic performance.16,17,21 The poor efficiency of the 2D perovskites has been attributed to their low absorption coefficient, poor charge transport, and large exciton binding energy.21 Interestingly, a recent study showed that for 2D AnA′n−1MnY3n+1 perovskite with n > 2, there exists an exciton dissociation to long-lived free carriers provided by lower-energy states at the edges of the layered perovskites, which could guarantee a high photovoltaic performance.22 By casting solution on a hot substrate, the crystal orientation in the n-butylammine (BA, C4H9NH3) based 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 film can be well-controlled to form an efficient charge transport layer along the out-of-plane direction and therefore give an improved photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 12.5% with greater humidity tolerance compared to its 3D counterparts.13 In spite of great success in the engineering of thin film formation, the poor material properties remain challenging to further advance the photovoltaic performance and device stability.
In this study, we sought to dope Cs+ into the 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 to modify the perovskite for enriched material properties. The improved film quality is corroborated by the calculated Goldsmith tolerance factor (GTF), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), ex situ grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). We further explored the influence of Cs+ doping on the photovoltaic properties by performing time-resolved grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) in situ during solution-processing, and by measuring the trap-state density, charge-carrier mobility, and charge-transfer kinetics in the semiconductor films. The outstanding film quality and optoelectronic properties are responsible for high-performance 2D perovskite solar cells with a PCE as high as 13.68%, the highest among the 2D devices reported, with much improved moisture tolerance under high humidity conditions and thermal stability at 80 °C in contrast to the 2D devices without Cs+ doping.
Results and discussion
Herein, a hot-casting method originally developed by Mohite13 was further optimized by introducing DMSO, which can function as a ligand to form a complex structure with the PbI2 precursor, to grow high-quality 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films (see Experimental Section). By using Cs+ to dope the 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite, we prepared (BA)2Cs3x(MA)3−3xPb4I13 with x ranging from 0% to 5%, 10% and 15%, labeled as Cs0-2D, Cs5-2D, Cs10-2D and Cs15-2D in the text for easy recognition. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) results suggest that the Cs+ doping concentration was maintained in the film as it is in the precursor solution (see Fig. S1 and Table S1 for the XPS results, and Fig. S2 and Table S2, ESI† for the EDS results).
To uncover the film formation mechanism of the 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite and its dependence on Cs+ doping, we performed in situ GIWAXS during spin-coating using synchrotron radiation. Representative 2D GIWAXS snapshots taken at the end of spin-coating (20 s) for both the Cs0-2D and Cs5-2D samples are shown in the ESI,† Fig. S3a. The time-evolutions of the scattering features with respect to the scattering vector q and time, are illustrated in Fig. 1a for both cases. The integrated intensity traces associated with the (111) reflection of the perovskite phase are plotted in Fig. S3b (ESI†). The out-of-plane line profiles at different times of 2, 10, 20 and 80 s are plotted in Fig. S3c and d (ESI†) and the corresponding FWHM of the (111) peak is listed in Table S3 (ESI†). From Fig. 1a, we observed a gel-like scattering halo at low q values (3–7 nm−1), which is assigned to the disordered precursor colloidal gel.23,24 The scattering of the precursor gel fades with time and a prominent (111) reflection of the layered (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite at q = 10 nm−1 appears for both cases, indicating direct phase transition from the disordered precursor to the perovskite. Importantly, we observed that the Cs+ doping changes the phase transition behavior. For example, the scattering of the precursor gel fades more slowly (5.9 vs. 7.8 s) and the crystallization kinetics is more prolonged in the case of the Cs5-2D solution (Fig. S3b–d, ESI†). The intensity evolution is also slower for the Cs5-2D sample. Furthermore, the FWHM of the (111) peak exhibits negligible variation (0.43–0.46 nm−1) from 10 s to 80 s for Cs0-2D, whereas for Cs5-2D it continuously decreases from 0.68 to 0.50 nm−1. These results clearly indicate that the Cs+ doping is influencing the perovskite crystallization behavior; the prolonged crystallization kinetics would potentially help the 2D perovskite grains grow larger.

(c) Schematic representation of the Cs+ doped 2D crystal structure. (d) Comparison of the absorption (dash line) and photoluminescence (PL, solid line) spectra of the Csx-2D perovskite films. 
We further investigated the crystal orientation and texture of the Csx-2D perovskite thin films after thermal annealing (Fig. 1b). We observed sharp Bragg spots without noticeable rings or arcs in the Csx-2D perovskites, demonstrating a highly textured crystalline 2D film in which the crystal domains are perfectly oriented with respect to the substrate. The crystallographic determination of the Bragg peaks was studied using a simulation diffraction pattern from the orthorhombic structure with the (101) plane parallel to the substrate surface (Fig. 1c) (see Fig. S4, ESI† for more details). Note that all Csx-2D films exhibit better crystal orientation in contrast to the observation reported by Mohite et al.13 We attributed this improvement to the changed crystallization with the formation of Lewis acid–base adducts25 upon addition of DMSO in the DMF solution (see Fig. S5, ESI† for the film morphology, crystal structure and device performance for the sample cast from neat DMF solvent). It should be also noted that with Cs+ doping the perovskite material retains perfect crystal orientation, highly textured crystalline 2D characteristics and phase-purity (see Fig. S6, ESI† for all GIWAXS patterns of the Csx-2D films); however it changes the perovskite lattice spacing. For instance, the peak positions of (0) and (1) slightly shift to a higher q with an increased Cs+ content, indicating reduction of the unit cell volume.
The changed lattice is also confirmed from X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Fig. S7, ESI†). XRD shows two dominant planes at ca. 14.2° and ca. 28.5° representing the crystallographic (111) and (202) planes for all Csx-2D perovskites,21 respectively. No additional phase is observed irrespective of the Cs+ content, indicating that the Csx-2D perovskites are phase pure. Careful examination shows that the Cs+ doping leads to a slight shift of the (111) peak from 14.23° to 14.32°, indicative of a decreased d-spacing from 6.22 Å to 6.18 Å. The crystallite size of the Csx-2D perovskites estimated using the Scherrer equation from the most intense (202) peak slightly changes from 37.1 nm to 39.2 nm and then to 33.5 nm with an increased Cs+ content from 0% to 5% and 15%. These observations are different from a previous report wherein both the crystallite size and crystallinity of the FA-based 3D perovskites were significantly enhanced by the Cs+ doping.26 Such difference might be due to different crystallization behavior between the 3D and the 2D perovskites. In 3D perovskites, the Cs+ assisted crystal growth is highly favorable during crystallization due to entropic stabilization. Thus the Cs+ doping could easily result in double-sized FA-based 3D perovskite crystals.27 By contrast, nucleation and crystallization are constrained to 2D planes for the Csx-2D crystals.

Fig. 1d further illustrates the influence of Cs+ doping on the optical properties of the 2D perovskites. It is found that the band gap of the 2D films (1.62–1.63 eV) is close to that of the 3D MAPbI3 film (ca. 1.57 eV, see Fig. S8, ESI† for optical properties of the 3D MAPbI3 film), indicating that it is indeed a good absorber for photovoltaic devices. A slight decrease in the absorption intensity was observed with an increased Cs+ content.28 Furthermore, the Cs+ doping yields a mild blue-shift of the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) peak from 760 nm to 750 nm. These results demonstrate that the Cs+ is indeed doped into the perovskite lattice without changing the intrinsic direct-bandgap properties of the (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite.13
The data shown in Fig. 1 attest to the fact that the Cs+ cation is integrated into the 2D perovskite lattice. The observed slight reduction of the cell volume with an increased Cs+ content results from the significantly smaller ionic radius of the Cs+ cation (1.81 Å) compared with MA+ (2.70 Å).29 The smaller cation yields stronger interaction between the cation and the X halide anions. The compositionally-dependent stability of the perovskite can be semi-quantitatively rationalized using a Goldsmith tolerance factor (GTF) concept:30 (1)where rA, rB and rX represent the ionic radii for ABX3 (rCs+ = 1.81 Å, rMA+ = 2.70 Å, rI− = 2.20 Å and rPb2+ = 1.19 Å).26,29 Stable perovskites are expected to exhibit a GTF range between 0.8 and 1.0.31,32 The calculated GTF decreases from 1.01 for the MA-based perovskite to 0.83 for the Cs-based perovskite. Clearly the GTF of MA-based perovskite can be effectively decreased when part of MA+ is replaced by a smaller Cs+ cation, resulting in higher material stability. This mechanism is also supported by the previous observation reported by Choi et al., who presented that by embedding a small amount of Cs+ in the 3D MAPbI3 structure, the stability of the perovskite film was improved.28
The fabricated Csx-2D perovskite films look uniform and black in appearance. While the Cs5-2D films are more shiny or reflective than the Cs0-2D films (see Fig. S9, ESI† for the photos), suggesting smoother surfaces, better film uniformity and thus more specular reflection. The film morphology was examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 2a shows plan-view SEM of the Csx-2D perovskite films. Uniform doping of Cs+ into the 2D perovskites was confirmed using X-ray energy disperse spectrometry (EDS) (see Fig. S10, ESI† for details). Excellent surface coverage by layered 2D planes with a size of 1–3 μm were observed for all the Csx-2D films, which are much better in surface quality in contrast to the films cast from neat DMF where granular grains with plenty of gaps were observed (see Fig. S5, ESI† for morphology).13 In the next step we compare the surface quality for the films upon Cs+ doping (Fig. 2b). The Cs0-2D film exhibits planar grain-boundaries between different layers, which are effectively alleviated for the Cs5-2D film. The SEM image further confirms the much larger grains, and flatter and more uniform surface texture in the Cs5-2D film. Further increasing Cs+ content to 15% yields a deteriorated surface with a high density of planar grain-boundaries and pin-holes with a size of tens of nanometers, which makes it challenging to fabricate working planar-type devices. It is apparent that we attained the highest surface quality for [Cs+] = 5%.

(c) Atomic force microscopy (AFM) of the Csx-2D perovskite films showing root-mean-square roughness (RMS) and work-function (WF). (d) Cross-sectional SEM images of the fabricated Csx-2D devices showing larger grain-size and more uniform packing of the 2D planes in the Cs5-2D films. 
Furthermore, AFM was used to gain more quantitative information on the flatness and work-function (WF) of the Csx-2D perovskite films (Fig. 2c).33 We observed densely stacked 2D layers with 1–6 μm grains for all Csx-2D films. The root-mean-square roughness (RMS) reaches the lowest value of 7.4 nm for the Cs5-2D, while it was 14.9 nm and 15.6 nm for the Cs0-2D and Cs15-2D films, respectively, indicating the smoothest surface for the Cs5-2D film. Meanwhile, the RMS value exhibits negligible variation (7.4–8.8 nm) with different magnifications (Fig. S11, ESI†), indicating that the morphology is quite uniform across different lateral length scales. Furthermore, the work-function (WF) measured is in the range of 5.09–5.10 eV for all Csx-2D films, meaning that WF is insensitive to the Cs+ doping.
The cross-sectional SEM images of the fabricated Csx-2D devices exhibit extremely well-packed, vertically oriented 2D crystallites (Fig. 2d). The 2D planes grow directly from the bottom to top surface in all Csx-2D films. We found different grain size and stacking behavior of 2D planes upon Cs+ doping, i.e., the 2D planes are the largest at 5% Cs+ doping. We also observed significant alleviation of the planar grain-boundaries upon 5% doping. Furthermore, the Cs5-2D sample exhibits a more compact interface between the perovskite and the Spiro-OMeTAD layers. These observations suggest that the growth of high quality 2D planes with a dense microstructure is assisted by the Cs+ doping, possibly due to prolonged crystallization kinetics as shown in Fig. 1a.
One important aspect of 2D perovskites for application in solar cells is their optoelectronic properties. The photovoltaic performance of the 2D perovskite solar cells appears to be limited by their multiple-quantum well structures.34,35 In other words, even though cation doping has been proven to be an efficient way to promote optoelectronic properties in 3D perovskites,36 it still remains unknown whether the same effect is attainable in 2D perovskites. In order to address this concern, the optoelectronic properties of the Csx-2D perovskites were investigated with respect to trap-state density, charge-carrier mobility, and charge-transfer kinetics.

Fig. 3a shows the dark current-voltage characteristics of the representative Cs5-2D perovskite film with an FTO/TiO2/Cs5-2D perovskite (ca. 700 nm)/PCBM (ca. 50 nm)/Ag (100 nm) structure (see Fig. S12, ESI† for other Csx-2D perovskites). The trap-state density was determined by the trap-filled limit voltage using the equation:37 (2)where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant (εr = 25),38VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap-filled limit region, q is the elemental charge, and L is the thickness of the film. We found that the trap density is in the range from 1.31 × 1015 cm−3 to 2.78 × 1015 cm−3 for all Csx-2D films with the lowest value obtained at Cs5-2D (Fig. 3b). The lower trap-state density in the Cs5-2D film could be attributed to its noteworthy film quality, as corroborated by SEM and AFM images as shown in Fig. 2. Even though Mohite et al. have carried out a very thorough study on the (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13-type 2D coatings and reported a trap-state density on the order of 1016 cm−3,13 there is very limited investigation on the trap densities for the present AnA′n−1MnY3n+1-type 2D materials. Our measurements show that the present films have slightly smaller trap-state density (1.31–2.78 × 1015 cm−3). The lower trap density in the current study could be ascribed to better film quality as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It is also worth noting that these trap density values in the Csx-2D films are much lower than that in 3D MAPbI3 films (ca. 1017 cm−3), but still significantly higher than those in single crystals (109–1010 cm−3).39,40 Furthermore, the intrinsic electron mobility measured using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method ranges from 0.16 to 0.29 cm2 V−1 s−1 with the highest value obtained in the Cs5-2D film (Fig. 3b). Although the Cs5-2D shows relatively good mobility and lower trap-density, the influence of the Cs+ doping in 2D perovskites is less prominent in contrast to what has been shown in the 3D perovskites, where 4-fold enhancement in charge-carrier mobility was achieved from ca. 4 to ca. 18 cm2 V−1 s−1 upon Cs+ doping.26

(b) The evolution of trap density and electron mobility in the Csx-2D films. (c) PL decay profiles of the Csx-2D films on FTO/TiO2 substrates. 
In addition, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was used to study charge-transfer kinetics (Fig. 3c) from the Csx-2D perovskites to the FTO/TiO2 substrate. TRPL displays two-exponential decay with a fast photocarrier lifetime (τ1 = 8.84 ± 1.65 ns) and slow one (τ2 = 18.15 ± 0.13 ns) in the Cs0-2D film, leading to an average lifetime of ca. 14.79 ns. The Cs+ doping yields decreased lifetime from 14.79 ns to 4.31 ns with the Cs+ concentration increasing from 0% to 15%. We ascribe this reduction in PL decay to faster charge-transfer kinetics, which is beneficial for suppressing the charge recombination at the perovskite–ETL interface.
These findings demonstrate that the optoelectronic properties of the 2D perovskites can be improved by Cs+ doping. It should be noted that this improvement is comparatively less prominent than those in the FA-based 3D perovskites. This is likely due to the already superior crystalline quality of 2D crystals as compared to 3D crystals; hence, further improvements in 2D crystal quality have comparatively less bearing on the optoelectronic properties. Furthermore, owing to highly confined charge transport within the 2D planes, any efforts to alleviate defects between 2D planes probably have little bearing on the transport and optoelectronic properties of the 2D planes themselves.
The solar cells were fabricated in the FTO/TiO2/Csx-2D perovskites/Spiro-MeOTAD/Au architecture (Fig. 4a) and measured under the standard AM1.5G (air mass 1.5 global 1 Sun) illumination with a scan rate of 0.1 V−1 s−1. We first performed a film thickness optimization for solar cell performance based on the Cs0-2D film and found that PCE was optimal for a film thickness of approximately 700 nm with Jsc reaching ca. 19.3 ± 0.8 mA cm−2. We found that thinner films decreased light harvesting, the Jsc and overall efficiency (see Fig. S13, ESI† for photovoltaic performance of thinner films). We then collected 50–80 devices for each Csx-2D sample. We observed statistically meaningful improvements in device performance upon 5% Cs+ doping: the FF increases from 59 ± 2% to 62 ± 2%, the Jsc increases from 19.3 ± 0.8 mA cm−2 to 19.9 ± 0.4 mA cm−2 and the PCE improves from 12 ± 0.3% to 13 ± 0.6% (Fig. 4b). The significant improvement in efficiency is mainly attributed to the enhancement in FF and Jsc, consistent with the observations of improved film quality and optoelectronic properties (Fig. 2 and 3). However, we observed “bad devices” with all device parameters deteriorating for Cs15-2D, especially in the standard deviation which reflects reproducibility. The deterioration in device performance results from bad film quality as shown in Fig. 2, which highlights the need to have precise Cs+ content control in the 2D perovskites.

(c) J–V curve for the peak efficiency of 13.68% obtained in the Cs5-2D perovskite solar cell. (d) External quantum efficiency (EQE; red) and integrated short circuit current density (Jsc; green) as a function of wavelength. (e) J–V curves recorded from the forward sweep (from Jsc to Voc) and reverse sweep (from Voc to Jsc) under AM1.5G illumination showing negligible hysteresis. 
We record a peak PCE of 13.68% with Voc = 1.08 V, Jsc = 19.95 mA cm−2 and FF = 63.47% for the Cs5-2D perovskite (Fig. 4c). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest PCE obtained for 2D perovskite solar cells.13,20,41 The measured external quantum efficiency (EQE) and the integrated Jsc for the Cs5-2D perovskite are illustrated in Fig. 4d. The EQE spectrum is in good agreement with the absorption profile which cuts off at ca. 768 nm (Fig. S14a, ESI†). A faster decline in EQE intensity above ca. 630 nm originating from lower absorption intensity was observed when compared to the 3D MAPbI3 film (Fig. S8 and S14b, ESI†). We have furthermore integrated the EQE spectra to extract the integrated Jsc and found excellent agreement within 4%. We also tested a hysteresis effect that has been reported in conventional 3D perovskites (Fig. 4e).42–46 Negligible variation was observed in J–V characteristics when changing from forward to reverse scans, suggesting suppressed hysteresis. The mechanism of low hysteresis in the 2D perovskite was recently investigated by different groups. Bakr and co-authors found that 2D crystals have three orders of magnitude lower self-doping concentration than those of typical 3D counterparts, which suppresses the hysteresis in 2D perovskite films.47 Meanwhile, Huang's group found that the ionic conductivity is highly suppressed in 2D perovskite films both in the dark and under illumination.48 It therefore hints that any small change in the material structure could alter the carrier collection at the electrodes and consequently bring changes in the J–V hysteresis of the perovskite solar cells.49
Furthermore, in Fig. 5 we investigated the stability of high performance Cs0-2D and Cs5-2D devices. We firstly performed long-term stability measurements for devices stored in air at room temperature (in the dark) without any encapsulation where the relative humidity is 30% RH. We recorded cell efficiency periodically as a function of time for the highest performing device (ηmax) and 8 average level devices (ηavg.). Fig. 5a shows the normalized PCE as a function of testing time. The Cs0-2D perovskite is well-known to pose higher environmental stability than its 3D equivalents under ambient conditions.13 In our case the Cs5-2D device exhibits even greater environmental stability in contrast to the Cs0-2D perovskite. The Cs5-2D device shows much slower PCE degradation for both average devices and the highest performance cell. The PCE of the Cs5-2D device still retains 89% of its initial efficiency after 1400 h, which is much higher than that of the Cs0-2D device (ca. 74%). The prolonged environmental stability of the Cs+ doped devices correlates well with its more stable phase structure as confirmed by the Goldsmith tolerance factor calculations.
 Fig. 5  Stability measurements for the Cs0-2D and Cs5-2D perovskite solar cells. (a) Long-term stability measurements of both solar cells without any encapsulation under ambient conditions where the relative humidity is 30% RH. Both the highest performing device (ηmax) and 8 average level devices (ηave) showing slower degradation for the Cs5-2D than the Cs0-2D solar cell as a function of time. (b) Humidity tolerance measurements for both solar cells at different humidities: 30%, 65% and 85% RH. (c) Thermal stability at 80 °C under an inert atmosphere without encapsulation for both Cs0-2D and Cs5-2D perovskite solar cells. 
It is found that the Cs+ doping leads to more hydrophobic surfaces (Fig. S15, ESI†), in fact, the Cs5-2D perovskite films can readily be prepared in air even when the relative humidity exceeds 60%. Indeed, we routinely obtained devices with initial PCE 10.49% without any specific optimization (Fig. S16, ESI†).
We further conducted aggressive studies on the humidity tolerance of Csx-2D devices under high humidity conditions (65% and 85% RH) at room temperature without encapsulation (Fig. 5b). After storing at 65% RH for 36 hours, the Cs5-2D and Cs0-2D devices retained 85% and 53% of their initial efficiency values, respectively. After being stored at 85% RH for 24 hours, the Cs5-2D and Cs0-2D devices retained 81% and 45% of their initial values, respectively. These humidity tolerance tests demonstrate that a superior humidity tolerance of 2D perovskite solar cells could be achieved by Cs+ doping.
Interestingly, the Cs+ doping also enhances the thermal stability. Both the Cs0-2D and Cs5-2D devices were thermally annealed at 80 °C under an inert atmosphere without encapsulation and the performance was recorded periodically. As shown in Fig. 5c, the devices retained 85% of their initial efficiency for the Cs5-2D film while only 55% for the Cs0-2D one. The enhanced thermal stability of the Cs5-2D film could be ascribed to higher structural stability as confirmed from GTF calculation, which suppresses MA+ desorption from the crystal.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated the excellent photovoltaic performance with a PCE up to 13.7% and superior humidity stability of a 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite solar cell achieved by Cs+ doping. By partially replacing MA+ with Cs+, both the grain size and surface quality of the phase-pure (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 films are effectively improved and near-ideal crystalline orientation was retained. Meanwhile the Cs+ doping aids improvement in optoelectronic properties in terms of trap density, charge-carrier mobility, and charge-transfer kinetics. The excellent film quality and optoelectronic properties yield significant enhancement in PCE from 12.3% to 13.7%. Furthermore, the Cs+ doping enhances material stability as confirmed by GTF calculation, long-term stability, humidity and heating tolerance. The 5% Cs+ doped devices retain 89% of their initial cell efficiency after 1400 hours of exposure under ambient conditions with 30% RH, and exhibit greatly improved tolerance to high humidity (under 65% and 85% RH test conditions) and sustained thermal stability (under 80 °C). We anticipate that these results will help advance perovskite devices toward commercial applications.

Broader context
Ruddlesden–Popper two-dimensional (2D) perovskites as one of the most important solar cell materials have attracted intensive attention. These 2D perovskites exhibit wide tunability of their optoelectronic properties due to their large degrees of freedom in chemistry and quantum mechanics, as well as high environmental stability. However their poor photovoltaic performance has been the most serious bottleneck toward commercialization of the perovskite solar cells. We found that doping cesium (Cs) cations into 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite can help increase the grain size of the 2D planes, improve the surface quality, reduce the trap-state density, enhance the charge-carrier mobility and charge-transfer kinetics, leading to high performance solar cells with a power conversion efficiency of 13.7% and negligible hysteresis. Furthermore, the doped devices demonstrate amazing tolerance to the external environment and great improvement in thermal stability. Our results provide an important step toward material engineering to address some of the key challenges facing 2D perovskite solar cells.
