    , Accepted 5th February 2014First published on 11th February 2014AbstractCu3SbSe3 nanocrystals have been synthesized using a hot-injection method. The Cu3SbSe3 nanocrystals possess a band gap of 1.31 eV and the corresponding nanocrystal-electrode shows an incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) of 10–35% in the visible region. Our work demonstrates that Cu3SbSe3 nanocrystals have potential in photo-electric conversion device applications.
Semiconductor nanocrystals are promising candidates in the fields of photovoltaics, thermoelectrics, Li-ion batteries and light emitting diodes. Among them, Cu–V–VI (V = Sb, Bi; VI = S, Se) nano-materials, composed of environmentally benign elements, are considered to be potential candidates for next-generation solar energy conversion materials. Thus this class of ternary chalcogenides, including CuSbS2,1–4 Cu12Sb4S13,4,5 Cu3SbS4,6 Cu3SbS3,4,7 CuSbSe2,8–10 and Cu3BiS3,11 has received much attention due to their novel properties, earth abundant nature and low cost potential.
Ternary Cu3SbSe3 (CASe) is an emerging semiconductor.12 Like other copper-based ternary and quaternary selenides, CASe has shown excellent thermoelectric properties and possesses anomalously low thermal conductivity, induced by the presence of two additional nonbonding electrons of the Sb3+ ions.13–15 Recently, theoretical calculations16,17 have demonstrated that CASe owns good photovoltaic properties. A CASe thin film, which displays p-type conductivity behaviour and a direct optical band gap of 1.68 eV, has been synthesized using the electrodeposition method by Fernández and Turner.18 Maiello et al. used a Cu3Sb(SexS1−x)3 (CASSe) film to fabricate solar cell devices by a two step synthesis route, obtaining an open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current density (Isc) of 3.5 mV and 1.6 mA cm−2, respectively.19 Due to its strengths of low cost and non-toxicity, CASe holds the promise for realizing the low cost fabrication of thin film solar cells and thermoelectric devices. There are few works on the synthesis of CASe. CASe films or bulk materials were reported to be prepared via Cu–Sb or Cu–Sb–Se precursor annealing methods.18,19 However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous report on the synthesis of CASe nano-materials until now. In order to expand CASe's application and realize a high output roll-to-roll process, it is of great importance to explore new synthetic methods enabling low cost, large scale and high quality CASe production. The nanocrystal-ink painting approach is such a technological method, possessing up-scaling potential for thin film fabrication, which has been extensively used, especially in the photovoltaic field.20–25 In this approach, the semiconductor nanocrystals are dispersed in solvents to form a stable nano-ink solution. The nano-ink can then be coated onto a substrate using a roll-to-roll method and sintered to form film materials.
In this communication, we firstly report the synthesis of high quality CASe nanocrystals by a hot-injection method using oleylamine (OLA). A novel highly reactive selenium (Se) precursor was used in all experiments to enable phosphine-free synthesis of CASe nanocrystals. It is well known that Se powder is difficult to dissolve in OLA to form a reactive precursor on its own. But it has recently been reported that Se powder can be dissolved in the presence of OLA via a phase transfer protocol.26,27 In that protocol, Se is first reduced by sodium borohydride (NaBH4) or dodecanethiol (DT) into low valence Se, which further associates with OLA to form OLAmSen, thus making the element Se soluble. However, NaBH4 is easily oxidized in open air, and the reduction of Se by NaBH4 must be assisted by ultrasonication. Besides, DT is unstable at a high synthesis temperature, which would introduce elemental sulphur due to DT decomposition during the synthesis process. In contrast, dimethylamine borane (DMAB) is a more stable reducing reagent. Herein, DMAB was employed to facilitate the dissolution of Se powder in OLA. Se was first reduced by DMAB to generate an alkylammonium selenide at 110 °C, which was then dissolved in OLA to form a bright-yellow solution. This Se precursor is highly reactive and suitable for the synthesis of CASe nanocrystals. The necessary conditions to synthesize phase pure nanocrystals with a narrow size distribution are discussed and the corresponding growth process was preliminarily investigated. The synthesized nanocrystals had diameters in the range of about 13 nm to 18 nm and an optical band gap of 1.31 eV. These nanocrystals can be easily dispersed in a comparably low-toxicity solvent to form a stable ink, and then the CASe film can be readily fabricated using the developed ink by a drop casting method. The obtained films demonstrated a clear photoresponse, showing that CASe thin films synthesized from the nanocrystals have potential application in photo-electric conversion devices.
The syntheses of CASe nanocrystals were carried out utilizing a hot-injection method via a standard air-inert Schlenk line. In a typical synthesis, Se powder was completely dissolved in OLA with the assistance of DMAB as a co-solvent at 110 °C, obtaining a Se–DMAB–OLA solution with a bright-yellow color. Then the Se–DMAB–OLA solution was quickly injected into the hot solution of OLA containing a stoichiometric amount of copper(II) acetylacetonate and antimony(III) acetate [atomic ratio Cu:Sb = 3:1] at 190 °C for 30 min under an Ar atmosphere. Full experimental details can be found in the ESI.†Fig. 1 demonstrates the basic structural characterization of the synthesized nanocrystals. They are round shaped nanocrystals with an average diameter of 15.7 ± 2.7 nm, as indicated in the low-magnification TEM image (Fig. 1a). The corresponding size distribution chart is given as an inset in Fig. 1a (additional TEM images can be found in the ESI, Fig. S1†). The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1b) shows a clear crystalline surface with interplanar spacings of 1.95, 2.00 and 2.32 Å corresponding to the (322), (400) and (222) planes of CASe, respectively, demonstrating that the synthesized nanocrystals possess the structure of CASe. The lattice data calculated from a selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a randomly chosen region of the CASe nanocrystals agree with the lattice parameters of CASe (Fig. 1c).

Fig. 2 illustrates the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the prepared nanocrystals. All the diffraction peaks can be readily indexed to the orthorhombic phase (Pnma) of CASe (JCPDS no. 86-1751). No evidence of other impurities, such as Cu2Se (JCPDS no. 65-2982), CuSbSe2 (JCPDS no. 75-0992), etc., can be found in the XRD pattern. The elemental composition of the synthesized CASe nanocrystals, estimated by Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), is Cu2.98SbSe3.09 (see ESI Fig. S2†), which is close to the stoichiometric composition of CASe.

The composition and valence states of the CASe nanocrystals were further investigated by XPS. As shown in Fig. 3, the binding energies of Cu 2p, Sb 3d, and Se 3d of the nanocrystals in the XPS spectra are consistent with those reported in the literature.7,28,29 The valence states of Cu, Sb, and Se ions are +1, +3, and −2, respectively. The composition determined by XPS is also close to the stoichiometric composition of CASe, agreeing with the EDS result.

We also investigated the effect of precursor ratios and found that they play a key role in the synthesis process (the XRD patterns for the synthesized product at different ratios of precursors are given in the ESI, Fig. S3†). Considering the elemental ratio Cu:Sb of 3:1 in CASe, a stoichiometric 3-fold excess of copper over antimony (Cu:Sb = 3:1) was applied in all experiments. The formation of pure CASe was found to be highly dependent on the content of the Se precursor. During a series of trial reactions, the amount of the injected Se was varied. For mole ratios of metal (Cu + Sb) to Se within the range of 4:3 to 4:4, the CASe phase was produced while both CuSbSe2 (JCPDS no. 75-0992) and Cu2Se (JCPDS no. 65-2982) were detected simultaneously. Interestingly, with an increase in Se content, peaks assigned to CuSbSe2 and Cu2Se gradually disappeared. Pure CASe can be obtained when the (Cu + Sb):Se ratio was 4:4. In addition, the use of excess Se was found to be necessary to balance the relative amount of cationic precursors to avoid side reactions and the formation of impurities. A similar synthetic strategy has also been previously reported and used for the synthesis of I–III–VI semiconductor nanocrystals via the hot-injection method.28,30,31
To explore the possible pathway for the formation of CASe nanocrystals, the phase data of the reaction products at different reaction times were studied by XRD (see ESI Fig. S4†). After the initial stage (1 min), the CASe phase has already been formed, indicating that the Se precursor has a high reactivity, and thereby facilitates the reaction between Cu, Sb and Se simultaneously. No other impurity phases, such as CuSe, Cu2Se, and CuSbSe2, were detected in the XRD patterns, which suggests that the synthesis of CASe nanocrystals should be a one-step process. With the reaction time proceeding to 4 min, 8 min, 16 min and 32 min, according to the XRD pattern, the main phase of CASe remained unchanged. However, when the reaction time reached 64 min, peaks assigned to Cu3SbSe4 (JCPDS no. 25-0263) were detected, which might result from the further reaction between CASe nanocrystals and excess Se.
In addition, experiments at different reaction (injection) temperatures have been trialled. As shown in ESI Fig. S5 and 6,† at relatively low temperatures, such as 160 °C, 190 °C and 220 °C, the products were pure CASe. The optimal reaction temperature was found to be around 190 °C. When the temperature was increased to 220 °C, NCs showed a slight aggregation. While at 160 °C, the rate of the reaction decreased and non-uniform nanocrystals were obtained. When the synthesis temperature was raised above 250 °C, CuSbSe2 was detected in addition to the desired phase CASe nanocrystals.
The absorption spectrum of the as-synthesized CASe nanocrystals was measured using UV-vis-NIR absorbance spectroscopy (see Fig. 4). The band gap of the CASe nanocrystals is estimated to be 1.31 eV, by extrapolating the linear region of the plot of the absorbance squared versus the energy, as shown in the inset of Fig. 4. The value is close to the optimal value for solar cell applications.32 In addition, a broad band that extends from around 700 nm to the NIR region was observed. The origin of this band needs to be further explored in a future study.

To test the photoresponse of CASe nanocrystals, the thin film of the nanocrystals was drop-cast onto an ITO substrate. This film was mounted on a custom-built three-electrode photoelectrochemical cell with a graphite counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) containing 0.5 M H2SO4. In general, a photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) is an excellent tool to assess the photovoltaic performance of new light-absorber materials. This method is popular because it reduces the recombination probability of minority carriers with photogenerated holes and provides a nearly ideal contact to the half cell, avoiding problems such as interface contact and lattice matching with the full device architecture.11,33

Fig. 5a displays the current density versus potential (vs. SCE) plots for the prepared CASe films utilizing a chopping method (40 s light on, 40 s light off). The photocurrent density increases with the negative shift of the cathodic potential, which is a typical characteristic of a p-type semiconductor for a CASe nanocrystal film.27 In this case, electrons are transferred from the conduction band to the oxidant in solution, and then from the back contact (here ITO) into the semiconductor, leading to the observed reductive current. The photocurrent density reaches a saturated value of about 0.22 mA cm−2 at −0.65 V vs. SCE. A transient photocurrent is obtained at this voltage (see ESI Fig. S7†), and excellent photoresponse characteristics and a good photostability of the nano-ink CASe film casting are shown over many cycles (12 cycles are demonstrated here). The magnitude of the gained photoresponse is high enough to acquire an IPCE spectrum, as shown in Fig. 5b. Approximately 10–35% of the incident photons can be readily converted to electron and hole pairs in the wavelength region of 400–980 nm, which covers most of the visible spectrum. The IPCE of CASe is higher than that of the other Cu–V–VI semiconductor materials1,10 in the entire absorption region. The IPCE value reaches zero when the photon energy goes below 1.24 eV, which corresponds to the band gap of synthesized CASe and agrees with the value estimated from the UV-vis-NIR data.

Conclusions
In summary, a colloidal synthesis of CASe nanocrystals using a hot-injection method is presented by utilizing a high reactivity phosphine-free Se precursor. The structure of the synthesized CASe nanocrystals was confirmed simultaneously by high-resolution TEM, SAED and XRD. The results of EDS and XPS confirmed the composition of the CASe nanocrystals. Both the ratios of precursors and temperatures play a crucial role in determining the phase and shape of the synthesised nanocrystals. CASe nanocrystals were formed in a short period of time due to the high reactivity of the Se precursor. A band gap of 1.31 eV for CASe nanocrystals was estimated using UV-vis-NIR data. The CASe nanocrystal film yielded an excellent photoresponse in PEC tests and an IPCE of 10–35% in the visible region. Our work demonstrates that the synthesized CASe nanocrystals have potential application in the field of photo-electric conversion devices. Our future work will focus on the utilization of CASe nanocrystals for the development of full photovoltaic devices.
