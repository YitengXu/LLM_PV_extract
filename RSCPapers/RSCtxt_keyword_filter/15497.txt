    , Accepted 18th May 2017First published on 19th May 2017AbstractIt is always essential for the design and optimization of devices to discover the interaction mechanism of light with hybrid perovskite materials in air. However, the mechanism is currently still under debate, although there is already a consensus that oxygen gas molecules along with light irradiation contribute predominantly to photoluminescence (PL) enhancements in perovskite crystals. In this work, we measured the light intensity, excitation energy, oxygen environment and depth dependence of the photoluminescence (PL) enhancements in perovskite single crystals by using confocal fluorescence microscopy. The dependence of the PL enhancement on the excitation energy and environment explicitly indicates the indispensable roles of photon-generated carriers and oxygen gas molecules. Moreover, the PL enhancement depth of over 100 μm in an oxygen environment demonstrates that the penetration of oxygen species must be the dominant mechanism, rather than their diffusion. Furthermore, the passivation of the oxygen species occurs in a stable and long-term manner, even in the absence of light, in contrast to that of carriers and neutral species. On the basis of these solid data, we propose that the O2− superoxides yielded from the reaction of O2 with free-moving electrons are responsible for the related PL enhancement effect involved in our work and other literature reports. This paper will definitely deepen our understanding of the interaction mechanism in this field.
Introduction
For the past few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have experienced unprecedented development with a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.1%.1–5 Despite their excellent optoelectronic properties for photovoltaics, the intrinsic “soft” structure of PSCs from their solution processing threatens the stability of these devices for scaled-up manufacture and utilization.6,7 Some key characteristics, such as local breaking of the MAPbI3 matrix,8 the release and movement of ions,9 the migration of various vacancy defects10etc., will typically lead to a slow electrical response under light irradiation,11,12 the famous J–V hysteresis of PSCs13–17 and a giant switchable photovoltaic effect.18,19 Thus, understanding and controlling the interaction mechanism between the incoming photons and the interface defect states in air is essential for designing and optimizing devices.
Based on the demand, the interaction behavior and mechanism between light and hybrid perovskite materials with different environmental factors have been gradually studied.20–27 Fang et al. demonstrated the modulation of the photoluminescence intensity of methylammonium lead tribromide (MAPbBr3) single crystals by over two orders magnitude by tuning the surface trap state density via physisorption of oxygen and water molecules, and attributed the result to the filling of surface trap states.24 Grancini et al. claimed that oxygen and hydromolecules may lead to lattice strain and PL shift in perovskite films.20 J. Fu et al. distinguished each contribution of oxygen and nitrogen in air for the enhancement of a MAPbI3 film, excluding the contribution of hydromolecules.25 In Tian's paper, the PL enhancement of MAPbI3 films and grains considering the influence of oxygen and nitrogen in contrast to a vacuum environment was explored, and the photo-generated carriers curing the defects in the grains depending on the light penetration length and diffusion length was proposed as a potential mechanism.23 Although there is already a consensus that oxygen molecules mainly contribute to PL enhancements in perovskite materials, the plausible mechanisms proposed only partially fit the corresponding phenomena, and are not convincing enough. Moreover, microstructure quality, grain boundaries and size limits restrict the objective investigation of the real underlying mechanism. Thus, for the typical and important MAPbI3 perovskite materials, it is crucial to discover the interaction mechanism on the platform of MAPbI3 single crystals.
In this work, we systematically investigated PL enhancements under various light intensities, excitation energies, gas environments and penetration depths, which directly reflects two electron–hole recombination processes, the separate roles of photon-generated carriers and oxygen gas molecules, and the stability of the penetration depth of functional species in MAPbI3 single crystals, respectively. All the evidence coherently and logically supports the hypothesis that more stable and charged oxygen species play the key role in our proposed interaction mechanism.
Results and discussion
MAPbI3 single crystals were prepared in solution via the so-called temperature-lowering (TL) method.28Fig. 1a shows the three growth stages of MAPbI3 single crystals. After 10 days, millimeter-scale single crystals with dimensions of ca. 7 × 7 × 5 mm3 were obtained, as shown in the inset of Fig. 1a. A powder diffraction pattern was collected at room temperature (Fig. 1b) with peaks at 14.04°, 19.88°, 23.42°, 24.24°, 28.38°, 31.80°, 34.88°, 40.40°, and 42.98°, which correspond to the (110), (112), (211), (202), (220), (310), (312), (224), and (314) planes in the I4cm space group, respectively.29

The inset shows a single crystal with a size of ca. 7 × 7 × 5 mm after 10 days of growth under ambient conditions. (b) Powder XRD patterns of ground MAPbI3 single crystals. 
A typical PL spectrum among those of the MAPbI3 single crystals, shown in the bottom-right inset of Fig. 2a, has a central wavelength of around 776 nm at room temperature, which is consistent with the literature.30Fig. 2a shows the integrated PL intensity under vacuum as a function of the excitation power of a 532 nm laser. Initially, the PL intensity was enhanced in a quadratic way with an increase in the excitation power, as shown in the upper-left inset of Fig. 2a. When the excitation power reached over 200 μW, a kink point appears. The further increase of the PL intensity exhibits a linear response with an increased power of incident light. Moreover, the energy peak of the PL spectrum always remains at around 776 nm for all of the PL measurements (shown in Fig. S1a†), which indicates that no defects are generated and no degradation occurs in the excitation power range up to 1 mW. This phenomenon is completely different from the PL trend observed for an intrinsic inorganic semiconductor, which gradually approaches saturation under higher excitation powers.31Fig. 2b shows transient PL spectra with excitation fluences ranging from 8.7 μJ cm−2 to 217 μJ cm−2. PL was excited by 150 fs laser pulses with a repetition rate of 80 MHz and a photon energy of 2.33 eV. The maximum span of the transient PL is around 12.5 ns (ESI†). The transient PL exhibits single exponential decay under an excitation fluence of 8.7 μJ cm−2 with a time constant of around 22 ns.32 As the excitation fluence increases, a fast decay component gradually appears and dominates the PL emission in the first several nanoseconds, which decreases with an increase in the excitation fluence (indicated by the slopes shown as orange dotted lines in Fig. 2b).33 The relevant fitting results are listed in Table S1.† At a low excitation intensity, the density of photo-excited electron–hole pairs is very low. Almost all of the photoelectrons are trapped at the defect centers, and subsequently return to the ground state by non-radiative recombination. Therefore, the single exponential relaxation in the transient PL spectrum (black curve shown in Fig. 2b) is dominated by defect-assisted decay, which demonstrates in theory that the steady-state PL intensity approaches a quadratic relation with excitation power.34 With increasing excitation intensity, besides the non-radiative channel through defect states, the electron–hole recombination channel is open and dominates the PL emission, which corresponds to the fast component in the transient PL spectra (indicated by the orange dotted lines in Fig. 2b). In theory, the steady-state PL intensity exhibits a linear enhancement with excitation power for this process, which is consistent with the results shown in Fig. 2a and S2.† Therefore, for a MAPbI3 single crystal, the decay of the PL intensity mainly occurs via two parallel recombination channels: direct recombination of photo-excited electron–hole pairs (a bi-molecular process) and defect-assisted decay (a mono-molecular process).35 In addition, for excitation fluences approaching tens of μJ cm−2, non-radiative Auger recombination will appear and dominate the non-radiative process, causing saturation or a decrease in the light emission quantum yield.33,36 These results further reveal that the defects exist in the surface region within a depth of around 150 nm and dominate the PL process of MAPbI3 single crystals at a low excitation intensity.24 In the presence of oxygen molecules, the PL lifetime of the samples becomes larger in contrast to that under vacuum (Fig. S3†). This is due to the oxygen curing the surface defects with the assistance of photon-generated carriers.22,32,37 The lifetime values seem to be lower than those previously reported,32 which may originate from residual hydromolecules in the structure of our MAPbI3 single crystals due to our chosen synthesis route.38,39

The bottom-right inset presents the typical PL spectrum of a MAPbI3 single crystal. (b) The PL transients under various excitation fluences ranging from 8.7 μJ cm−2 to 217 μJ cm−2. The dotted lines indicate the fast decay process. 
Based on the threshold power at the kink point just mentioned above, a 532 nm laser with a power of 300 μW was employed continuously to irradiate MAPbI3 single crystals in an oxygen-containing environment. Irradiation by all of the lasers involved in this work with a power of 300 μW didn't change the surface microstructure of the samples at all, while the 532 nm laser with a power of 1 mW caused obvious surface damage of the samples after 1 hour of irradiation (Fig. S4†). PL measurements were performed at regular time intervals, during which the irradiation of the sample by the 532 nm laser was shut down and the integration time per spectrum was shorter than 60 s. The excitation power for PL measurement at each interval was 15 μW to avoid the influence of light irradiation on the PL measurement, which can cause defect-sensitive electron–hole recombination as discussed above. Similar to previous reports,23 the PL intensity of the MAPbI3 single crystals steadily increased with irradiation time, and didn't show any saturation after 46 minutes of light soaking, as shown in Fig. 3a. Importantly, the PL peak position always remained at around 776 nm during long-term soaking, which indicates that no component degradation occurred. The black squares in Fig. 3b show that the integrated PL intensity linearly increased from 2.3 × 105 counts at the start point to 1.8 × 106 counts after 46 minutes of light soaking, an increase of one order of magnitude. This result clearly confirms the effect of oxygen gas molecules in the PL enhancement of our MAPbI3 single crystals.
 Fig. 3  (a) The PL spectra of MAPbI3 single crystals collected at different time intervals under light irradiation by a 532 nm laser with a power of 300 μW in an oxygen-containing environment. The PL curves were measured using a light probe with the same 532 nm laser but with a lower power of 15 μW to avoid the influence of light irradiation on the measurements. (b) Integrated PL intensity as a function of irradiation time with a 532 nm, 808 nm and 980 nm laser, and with no irradiation. (c) Integrated PL intensity with a transition from 532 nm to 778 nm light irradiation, which corresponds to off- and near-resonance conditions, under the same experimental conditions, including excitation power, probe light power, and integration time. 
To separate the functions of light soaking and oxygen gas molecules, we also investigated the dependence of the PL enhancement on different wavelengths of light under an oxygen atmosphere. First, in the absence of irradiation, the integrated PL intensity was generally steady with some ambiguous fluctuation, as shown by the pink pentagons in Fig. 3b. This clearly indicates that oxygen gas molecules themselves cannot enhance the PL emission. To further confirm the function of photon-generated carriers, 808 nm (blue circles) and 980 nm (purple stars) lasers were employed as the light source with an energy lower than the optical band gap of our MAPbI3 single crystals. As shown in Fig. 3b, the enhancement effect on the PL intensity disappeared, as indicated by the blue circles and purple stars. Although 808 nm is at the tail end of the band gap of our MAPbI3 single crystals (Fig. 3a), the yield and kinetic energy of these departed carriers must be small and so they cannot deactivate the defects effectively in the crystals.
Hence, both oxygen gas molecules and sufficient photon-generated carriers are indispensable for the PL enhancement of MAPbI3 single crystals. Moreover, PL spectra were also collected under the same oxygen environment with 532 nm and 778 nm irradiation, which corresponds to the off-resonant and near-resonant condition. During light soaking, the powers for the two excitation energies are kept the same at a value of 300 μW. As shown in Fig. 3c, the integrated PL intensity was further enhanced when the irradiation light was changed to 778 nm from 532 nm, as illustrated by the 3.15 × 104 counts per min recorded for 532 nm light versus the 4.9 × 104 counts per min recorded for 778 nm (indicated by the slope of the green line in Fig. 3c). It is a reasonable conclusion from these facts that resonant excitation will contribute more electron–hole pairs to passivate the defects. Under resonant excitation, the PL intensity approaches saturation after 180 minutes of continuous irradiation.
However, the mechanism is still currently under debate. The differences lie in the understanding of the function of oxygen molecules. Y. Tian et al.23 believe that oxygen atoms, produced from oxygen gas molecules, dissolve and diffuse through the crystal solid in the form of interstitial defects assisted by imperfections in the perovskite lattice, which seems plausible because the polycrystalline micrograins of perovskites are known to contain lots of grain boundaries and defects. The formation and diffusion of oxygen atoms in the crystal lattice means that the re-activation of PL quenching defects is not full but instead is partially reversed. H. Fang et al. didn't agree with this point and attributed this phenomenon to passivation of surface defects by photon-generated carriers, along with the physisorption of oxygen molecules,24 rather than to the diffusion and dissolution of oxygen atoms. In fact, in Fang's work, the PL quenching is fully reversible, which demonstrates that the grain boundaries and grain size limit may determine the difference in the reverse process of PL quenching in contrast to single crystals.
To distinguish the mechanisms mentioned above, through our home-made confocal fluorescence microscopy system, the depth-dependent PL responses of MAPbI3 single crystals were recorded (Fig. S5†). The axial resolution of our confocal system is around 5 μm and the size of the confocal pinhole is 25 μm. A 50× objective lens with a numerical aperture (NA) of 0.42 was employed and the excitation wavelength was 532 nm. As Fig. 4a and b show, PL enhancements with 532 nm laser light irradiation in an oxygen atmosphere and under vacuum can be traced to a depth of over 100 μm. Interestingly, PL enhancement always exists along the depth profile from the surface to a depth of 110 μm in an oxygen environment, but the PL intensity always declined at each depth up to 80 μm in the crystal. Two conclusions can clearly be drawn from the data. Firstly, the results exclude the passivation process, which only exists at a superficial thickness through simple physical absorption. Secondly, the results indicate that high energy oxygen species can penetrate a long way into the MAPbI3 single crystal to a depth of over 100 μm. Here, it is worth noting that the long-term irradiation of the MAPbI3 single crystal definitely yielded a large number of moving ions/defects due to their low activation energy barrier (0.1–0.9 eV).40,41 At the intervals where we measured the PL curves, the laser was shut down and thereafter the existing carriers would recombine again, while the migrated ions/defects cannot go back in such a short time without an energy supply.42 The increased defect density definitely requires more photon-generated carriers for passivation when the sample PL is measured with a 532 nm laser of 40 μW power. Thus, the PL intensity obtained under vacuum dropped with light irradiation, in contrast to that without irradiation (Fig. 4b and S1a†). On the other hand, at deeper depths, the number of species that have penetrated in turn reduces and the number of ions/defects also decreases in the crystal. This leads to the PL intensities both with and without light irradiation declining and ultimately reaching the same level (Fig. 4a and b).
 Fig. 4  The integrated PL intensity vs. depth profile of a MAPbI3 single crystal tested in an oxygen atmosphere (a) and under vacuum (b) at a focal point using our home-built confocal microscope (Fig. S2†). The red points are obtained with light irradiation by a 532 nm laser with a power of 300 μW, while the black points present those without light irradiation in both (a) and (b). The PL intensities were measured using a light probe with the same 532 nm laser with a lower power of 40 μW. The whole duration is 30 min. (c) and (d) are schematic illustrations of the mechanisms proposed for a vacuum and with oxygen, respectively. 
Combining all of the above results, different from the above mechanism where oxygen atoms are responsible for the effect, we believe that it is O2− species that are really responsible, in addition to the passivation of photon-generated carriers themselves. In Tian's model, the dissolution of oxygen gas molecules into the crystal lattice is a prerequisite.23 However, the bond dissociation energy for O2 to O is 5.15 eV or 498 kJ mol−1 without a catalyst (cited in textbooks), which is a high energy barrier for the reaction, even with the assistance of 514 nm laser excitation. In reality, the absorbed O2 molecules are more inclined to react with free electrons in the crystal lattice,43 because the energy barrier (ΔE) for the following equation is only 0.45 eV (ref. 44) and can be triggered easily by the lasers involved in the experiment. O2 + e− + ΔE = O2−(1)
In eqn (1), an electron is necessary to form an O2− species, which demands that the laser should be above the bandgap of MAPbI3 (ca. 776 ± 30 nm). This requirement is in line with the responses to laser excitation at different wavelengths (Fig. 3b). This conclusion has been confirmed by the PL enhancing behaviors with 808 nm and 980 nm irradiation, and without irradiation.
For MAPbI3, a general consensus is already recognized that the popular ions/defects that migrate are I−, MA+, VI+, and VMA− with lower activation energies (0.1–0.9 eV).40 Based on the above understanding, two kinds of mechanisms involved in the PL enhancement of MAPbI3 single crystals are proposed, as shown in Fig. 4c and d, although the real situation may be more complicated than what we propose. Under vacuum (Fig. 4c), photon-generated excitons lead to a large amount of MA+ and VI+ ions/defects, which quench the free carriers. In contrast, in an oxygen atmosphere (Fig. 4d), photon-generated electrons enable the reaction in eqn (1) and yield a lot of high energy O2− excited species. According to some simulation reports,45,46 these species can obviously penetrate deep within the crystal through consensus channels formed by photon-generated iodine vacancies, and can also be converted into single oxygen atoms in the lattice if enough iodine vacancies exist. Also, O2− can be easily absorbed by lead ions with a bypass effect to fill the MA vacancies. It is worth noting that the deeper photon-generated iodine vacancies are probably filled by upper adjacent iodine atoms engaged by the passing laser energy, which migrate upwards until they are finally filled by the species yielded from O2− superoxides. In fact, I− ions themselves can easily combine into I2 dimers in addition to the passivation effect of free electrons and holes on the free moving MA+ and I− ions. Fig. S1c† unambiguously exhibits the transition in PL enhancement behavior of the same single crystal from a vacuum to an oxygen atmosphere. It is worth noting that the decline in the PL intensity of single crystals under vacuum may also be attributed to the degassing of oxygen already absorbed at the surface of the single crystals.
Moreover, a comparison of the PL enhancement between oxygen and nitrogen environments was also performed on the same MAPbI3 single crystal (Fig. S1d†). It is clear that the enhancement effect of oxygen is much higher than that of nitrogen, while it is undeniable that nitrogen can also boost the PL intensity to some degree, which was attributed to residual oxygen in the environment.23 Based on our proposed mechanism, although the radius of an N2 molecule is 71 ± 1 pm, the energy barrier for N2 (ΔE = 9.8–11.5 eV) to accomplish the reaction in eqn (1) is much higher than that for O2 and the lifetime of N2− is very short.47 Thus, it is difficult for nitrogen gas molecules to react with electrons and hence the PL enhancement is not as large as that in an oxygen atmosphere. However, the PL enhancement that occurred in a nitrogen environment may be due to physical absorption and the passivation of some corresponding defects in the MAPbI3 single crystals, in addition to the functions of photon-generated carriers.
Conclusion
In summary, the dependence of the PL enhancement of MAPbI3 single crystals on the irradiation light intensity, excitation energy, environment and penetration depth was systematically studied in this work. The irradiation intensity dependence of the PL enhancement indicates two typical stages of electron–hole recombination process, including direct recombination of photo-excited electron–hole pairs (a bi-molecular process) and defect-assisted decay (a mono-molecular process). Using a 532 nm laser with a power of 15–40 μW (in the mono-molecular recombination stage) as an excitation source for the PL measurements, the excitation energy and environment dependence of the PL enhancement explicitly indicates the indispensable roles of photon-generated carriers and oxygen gas molecules, which in fact excludes either physical absorption of oxygen gas molecules or the passivation effect of carriers. The PL enhancement at a depth of over 100 μm in the single crystals clearly exhibits the stability of oxygen species for passivation in the long-term and even in the absence of light irradiation. On the basis of our solid data, owing to the low reaction energy barrier (0.45 eV), we proposed that it is O2− ions, produced from O2 and free moving electrons, that penetrate with the assistance of iodine vacancies and lead ions and cause the related PL enhancements observed in our work and other literature studies. This paper, which provides logical and coherent evidence with novel data different from that in previously published reports, reveals the considerable interaction mechanism between photon-generated carriers and oxygen gas molecules in MAPbI3 crystals, which definitely deepens our understanding of this point.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) The growth process of MAPbI3 single crystals. Three photos were taken to present the evolution of single crystals in solution at 0 days, 3 days and 5 days, respectively. The inset shows a single crystal with a size of ca. 7 × 7 × 5 mm after 10 days of growth under ambient conditions. (b) Powder XRD patterns of ground MAPbI3 single crystals.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) The integrated PL intensity as a function of the excitation power of a 532 nm laser under vacuum conditions. The upper-left inset shows the zoomed-in curve for excitation powers less than 200 μW, indicated by the dashed rectangular box. The bottom-right inset presents the typical PL spectrum of a MAPbI3 single crystal. (b) The PL transients under various excitation fluences ranging from 8.7 μJ cm−2 to 217 μJ cm−2. The dotted lines indicate the fast decay process.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) The PL spectra of MAPbI3 single crystals collected at different time intervals under light irradiation by a 532 nm laser with a power of 300 μW in an oxygen-containing environment. The PL curves were measured using a light probe with the same 532 nm laser but with a lower power of 15 μW to avoid the influence of light irradiation on the measurements. (b) Integrated PL intensity as a function of irradiation time with a 532 nm, 808 nm and 980 nm laser, and with no irradiation. (c) Integrated PL intensity with a transition from 532 nm to 778 nm light irradiation, which corresponds to off- and near-resonance conditions, under the same experimental conditions, including excitation power, probe light power, and integration time.	 

 	Fig. 4  The integrated PL intensity vs. depth profile of a MAPbI3 single crystal tested in an oxygen atmosphere (a) and under vacuum (b) at a focal point using our home-built confocal microscope (Fig. S2†). The red points are obtained with light irradiation by a 532 nm laser with a power of 300 μW, while the black points present those without light irradiation in both (a) and (b). The PL intensities were measured using a light probe with the same 532 nm laser with a lower power of 40 μW. The whole duration is 30 min. (c) and (d) are schematic illustrations of the mechanisms proposed for a vacuum and with oxygen, respectively.
