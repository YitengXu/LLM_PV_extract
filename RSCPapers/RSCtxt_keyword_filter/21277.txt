    , Accepted 5th March 2019First published on 6th March 2019AbstractFully printable hole transport layer-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells have proven excellent long-term stability and are therefore promising candidates for scale-up to larger modules required for the commercialization of the perovskite photovoltaic technology. In this work the imbalanced charge extraction resulting from relatively thick device architectures is addressed by adding CuSCN to the perovskite absorber layer which was shown to significantly reduce the hysteresis and improve solar cell efficiency.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are regarded as a promising future technology in the renewable energy sector.1–3 Since their discovery by Miyasaka4 in 2009, power conversion efficiencies quickly increased to certified values of above 23% within only a few years of research, which is unprecedented for any solar cell technology.5–7 PSCs can potentially be produced from readily available resources using simple solution processing techniques, resulting in low production cost and thus low energy payback estimates.8,9 Although laboratory cells and small modules with relatively high efficiencies have been demonstrated, the main hurdle for large scale commercialization to overcome, is the long-term stability of the perovskite material. Degradation of hybrid perovskites is reported to occur due to oxygen,10 moisture,11 temperature12,13 or exposure to UV-light.14 In addition, the electrical field present under operation conditions may raise additional issues such as ion migration or interfacial reactions with the charge transporting layers that can hamper the device efficiency.15,16 While moisture and oxygen sensitivity can be addressed by proper sealing of the solar cells, the challenge of finding the ideal device architecture remains. Mesoscopic hole transport material-free solar cells using conductive carbon as a top contact have recently shown excellent stability under full sun illumination.17 This device architecture is fully printable and therefore suitable for upscaling to larger area modules.18,19 In contrast to the standard device configuration, mesoscopic HTM-free solar cells rely neither on expensive resources such as organic charge extracting layers nor on noble metal electrode materials. This not only reduces the production cost significantly but also eliminates components within the PSC which are shown to be the origin of poor device stability due to ion migration or degradation.20 The monolithic HTM-free solar cells usually consist of mesoporous titania (m-TiO2) as an electron transport layer followed by mesoporous zirconia (mZrO2) serving as a buffer layer and finally conductive carbon as the counter electrode.
One important problem of the HTM-free device configuration having a zirconia buffer layer is the relatively long distance that holes need to travel to reach the conductive carbon cathode electrode. Incident light in the visible range reaching the solar cell is typically absorbed within the first few hundred nanometers of the MAPbI3 perovskite layer, which means that most electron–hole pairs are generated close to the photoanode. Consequently, free electrons can be extracted quickly by simple injection into the mesoporous titania scaffold, while generated holes need to travel all the way through the mesoporous zirconia to reach the carbon contact. This may lead to imbalanced charge extraction, which is often reflected as a large hysteresis behavior as well as the appearance of a “bump” in the reverse J–V scan. The restricted hole extraction not only hampers the overall device efficiency but also complicates the way such devices can be reliably measured to address their real efficiency.21 Use of standard solar cell characterization techniques which are reverse J–V scans can easily lead to an overestimation of the actual device efficiency. Previous reports on mesoscopic HTM-free carbon cells have accounted for this problem by either reporting the average values between forward and reverse scans or even more accurately the devices were measured at their maximum power point to obtain the stabilized power output.22,23 In this work we address the problem of imbalanced charge extraction in mesoscopic HTM-free solar cells by adding CuSCN, a well-known inorganic hole transporting material (HTM), to the perovskite precursor solution allowing to form a bulk heterojunction. We show that the addition of 4 mol% of CuSCN significantly reduces the hysteresis found in carbon based solar cells due to the faster extraction of holes generated in the perovskite towards the carbon counter electrode, which also lead to an increase of power conversion efficiencies.
A schematic illustration of the device configuration together with the corresponding energy level alignment of different solar cell components is shown in Fig. 1. The electrodes were fabricated by screen printing different layers onto fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass under ambient conditions and consist of a stack of FTO/compact TiO2/mesoporous TiO2/mesoporous ZrO2/conductive carbon. The insulating mesoporous ZrO2 is introduced as a buffer layer to avoid direct contact of the TiO2 with the conductive carbon. The light absorbing perovskite layer is formed by infiltration of a perovskite precursor solution into the mesoporous stack followed by a slow annealing procedure. The perovskite precursor solution used for the experiments consists of methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) mixed with 5 mol% aminovaleric acid (AVA) dissolved in gamma butyl lactone (GBL) as reported previously.17 Detailed solar cell processing details are enclosed in the SI. From the cross-sectional image (Fig. 1c) the thickness of the titania layer was found to be around 500 nm, the zirconia buffer layer to be 1.5 μm and the carbon layer is over 20 μm thick. The composition of the different layers could be further confirmed by EDX measurements (see Fig. S1†). The perovskite crystallizes within the mesoporous structure as well as in the conductive carbon electrode. In this study, a small amount of CuSCN is added to the perovskite precursor solution allowing the formation of a bulk heterojunction to improve the extraction of photogenerated holes in mesoscopic HTM-free solar cells having a conductive carbon layer as the counter electrode. Different quantities of CuSCN were added to the precursor solution to investigate the influence on the photovoltaic performance as shown in Fig. 2, and Table 1.

Although CuSCN was found to be poorly soluble in GBL alone, solubility greatly increased within the matrix of the perovskite solution. Preliminary experiments showed that the amount of CuSCN added to the precursor solution had a drastic impact on the crystallization of the perovskite layer. With amounts above 10 mol% it was not possible anymore to achieve a uniform perovskite film. Therefore, relatively small concentrations of 4 mol% and 8 mol% were investigated and compared with the standard precursor solution. Devices fabricated with different amounts of CuSCN were tested under 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) using reverse–forward IV scans as well as maximum power point tracking. The results for the champion devices are shown in Fig. 2. The values displayed within the current–voltage (I–V) plots represent an average between the IV curves recorded in forward and reverse bias directions. Table 1 summarizes the corresponding photovoltaic parameters. Average values obtained from 9 cells are shown in brackets. A scanning speed of 5 mV s−1 has been used for all the measurements. The IV curves of the reference cell displayed in Fig. 2a show a distinct “bump” in the reverse scan leading to an overestimation of the fill factor (FF) together with a strong hysteresis. Efficiencies calculated from IV curves (reverse/forward: 15.4%/13.5%) are therefore not reliable and significantly higher than efficiencies extracted from maximum power tracking experiments (12.8%). These values are consistent with other reports on mesoporous HTM-free carbon cells.23 Adding 4 mol% of CuSCN to the precursor solution greatly improves the shape of the corresponding IV curve as shown in Fig. 2b. Compared to the reference cell, no “bump” is seen and the hysteresis is found to be small. Furthermore, the current collected at short circuit is increased, leading to a superior device efficiency compared to the reference cells. Reverse IV scans show efficiencies of around 15% with Voc = 888 mV, Jsc = 21.9 mA cm−2 and FF = 77.1%. The higher efficiency is also confirmed by peak power tracking measurements where a stabilized PCE of around 14% could be achieved. Increasing the amount of CuSCN further did not show any improvement in device performance. Devices fabricated with 8 mol% CuSCN show average efficiencies of 13.2% which is mainly due to less crystallization of the perovskite layer with an increased amount of CuSCN as mentioned earlier. Stability of the solar cells was measured under 1 sun continuous illumination (Fig. S2†). The addition of CuSCN to the perovskite layer did not have any negative influence on the device stability and both reference and sample with 4 mol% CuSCN showed less than 15% loss in efficiency over 1000 h.
To compare the structural, morphological and optical properties of the perovskite layer with and without CuSCN, drop-cast films on mesoporous titania/zirconia without the carbon electrode were analyzed. Top view SEM images shown in Fig. S3,† reveal an increase in the grain size when adding CuSCN to the precursor solution. This leads to a denser coverage of the mesoporous structure lying underneath compared with the reference sample. From XRD analysis (Fig. S4†) no significant difference could be observed in the diffraction patterns in between films with and without CuSCN. This indicates that the CuSCN did not alter the perovskite structure but rather precipitates as an amorphous phase in between the perovskite grains. The ionic radius of Cu+ is too small to enter the perovskite structure and Cu therefore is not expected to replace the organic MA cations. Fig. 3a and b compare the photoluminescence (PL) map of the perovskite films, in terms of the peak position, upon excitation at 405 nm for the pristine sample and the one with CuSCN. The images reveal an average red-shifted emission for the sample containing CuSCN. This observation is consistent with the larger grain size measured for the CuSCN doped sample.24Fig. 3c shows normalized PL spectra of the two samples, on a large spot and Fig. 3d shows the normalized PL decay upon excitation at 375 nm. The doped films show significant quenching in the first tens of ns, prevailing in the amplitude with respect to the decay of the reference. This can suggest that injection of photogenerated holes occurs from the perovskite into the CuSCN HTM. Reduced trapping can also be the reason behind which needs further exploration.

Faster response times in mesoscopic perovskite solar cells with CuSCN were further confirmed by transient current measurements. We investigated the build-up current of mesoscopic solar cells under illumination with different light intensities ranging from 0.1 to 1 sun. The current response for the reference devices was found to be extremely slow, reaching saturation only after several seconds of illumination (Fig. S5†). The response time greatly improved for samples with 4 and 8 mol% CuSCN. The reference cells displayed a strong capacitive behavior after switching on the light. We assign this initial built up current to the accumulation of photogenerated holes that cannot be extracted efficiently, resulting in unbalanced charge extraction, in agreement with previously published results.25 On the addition of CuSCN to the perovskite layer, this capacitive feature almost completely disappears, resulting in much faster current saturation. A schematic illustration of the charge extraction is illustrated in Fig. 4. In mesoscopic HTM-free PSCs incident light is usually absorbed within the first few hundred nanometers in the device. Consequently, photogenerated electrons can be easily extracted by injection into the titania. Holes, however, need to travel through the perovskite all the way through the thick zirconia buffer layer to reach the top carbon electrode. The addition of CuSCN to the perovskite layer allows the formation of a bulk heterojunction and allows generated holes to be extracted much faster. This not only greatly enhances the response time of this type of solar cells but also allows for better efficiencies.

Electrons (e−) can be easily extracted by injecting into the titania, while holes (h+) need to be transported through the perovskite to the top carbon electrode (left). Presence of CuSCN as an inorganic HTM allows holes to be extracted more efficiently (right). 
To gain information on the elemental (Cu and Pb) and molecular distribution of the additives (CuSCN and aminovaleric acid) at the multi scale, secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) experiments were performed. High-resolution helium ion microscopy (HIM) coupled with mass spectrometry26,27 was used to map the morphology and nanoscale composition of the perovskite film (Fig. 5) while the TOF-SIMS instrument provided information about the elemental and molecular distribution of the perovskite film in 3D at the microscale (Fig. S6†).
 Fig. 5  Secondary electron images obtained using a helium ion microscopy instrument showing the morphology of the film. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging of copper (65Cu), zirconium (91Zr) and lead (208Pb). The active layer, identified by the Cu and Pb signals, is homogeneous. The detected Zr probably corresponds to a few pinholes. The scale bar corresponds to 5 μm. 

Fig. 5 shows a HIM-SIMS analysis, which reveals the granular morphology of the perovskite film (SE image) and homogeneous distribution of the lead matrix in the sample. The copper signal is homogeneous and correlates with the lead distribution. The zirconium signal reveals the presence of a few pinholes, which is confirmed by an analysis at a larger scale across the bulk of the film by macroscale SIMS analysis (Fig. S6†). The 3D TOF-SIMS map confirms the relative homogeneity of the copper across the bulk of the film except for the presence of copper rich accumulates on the surface. Nanoscale HIM-SIMS analysis of these copper islands reveals the presence of small CuSCN inclusions within larger surface structures (Fig. S7†). Fig. S6† depicts a rather non-homogeneous distribution of aminovaleric acid across the bulk and the surface and the presence of a few visible pinholes.
The SIMS results qualitatively suggest that the additives are distributed across the whole film, with aminovaleric acid-rich hotspots, possibly at the grain boundaries and CuSCN inclusions accumulating inside larger surface structures.
Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrate improved hysteresis and power conversion efficiency for fully printable mesoscopic PSCs by incorporating CuSCN into the perovskite layer. For devices containing 4 mol% CuSCN in the photoactive material, efficiencies up to 15% measured under reverse bias could be obtained. This value is among the highest for MAPI based HTM-free solar cells. Furthermore, the devices showed excellent stability under full sun illumination for over 1000 h with an efficiency loss of less than 10%. The improved device performance with CuSCN in mesoscopic HTM-free solar cells is attributed to the enhanced extraction of photogenerated holes within the relatively thick device architecture. XRD, PL and current transient measurements suggest the formation of a bulk heterojunction of CuSCN with the perovskite. A homogeneous distribution of the CuSCN additive in the perovskite bulk could be further confirmed by HIM-SIMS and TOF-SIMS analysis. This work paves the way for the fabrication of efficient, ultra-stable, cheap and scalable perovskite solar cells.

 	Fig. 3  Photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite films with and without the addition of CuSCN. (a and b) PL maps comparing peak positions. (c and d) Steady state and time resolved PL measurements.	 

 	Fig. 4  Schematic illustration of the extraction of photogenerated charges in mesoscopic HTM-free perovskite solar cells. Electrons (e−) can be easily extracted by injecting into the titania, while holes (h+) need to be transported through the perovskite to the top carbon electrode (left). Presence of CuSCN as an inorganic HTM allows holes to be extracted more efficiently (right).	 

 	Fig. 5  Secondary electron images obtained using a helium ion microscopy instrument showing the morphology of the film. Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) imaging of copper (65Cu), zirconium (91Zr) and lead (208Pb). The active layer, identified by the Cu and Pb signals, is homogeneous. The detected Zr probably corresponds to a few pinholes. The scale bar corresponds to 5 μm.
