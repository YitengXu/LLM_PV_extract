    , Accepted 26th May 2016First published on 26th May 2016AbstractA low-temperature solution-processed inorganic p-type contact material of vanadium oxide (VOx) was developed to fabricate planar-heterojunction perovskite solar cells. Using a solvent-assisted process, high-quality uniform and compact perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3) films were deposited on VOx coated substrates. Due to the high transmittance and quenching efficiency of VOx layers, a power conversion efficiency of over 14% was achieved.
Organometal trihalide perovskite (OTP) materials such as CH3NH3PbX3 (X = I, Br, Cl) have attracted significant attention as light absorbers in photovoltaic devices due to their distinct properties such as a high extinction coefficient, long charge-carrier diffusion length, and a broad adsorption range along with a tunable bandgap.1 OTP of CH3NH3PbI3 was first employed to fabricate perovskite-sensitized solar cells with an iodine containing liquid electrolyte by T. Miyasaka.2 Then, N.-G. Park replaced the liquid electrolyte with a solid-state hole-transporting-material (HTM) of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxy-phenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) to assemble an all-solid-state perovskite solar cell (PSC), and obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 9%.3 Up to now, the certified PCEs of PSCs have reached over 20%, making it the fastest advancing photovoltaic technology to date.4
PSCs usually employ an n–i–p or a p–i–n heterojunction, in which an OTP absorber is sandwiched between an electron transporting layer (ETL) and a hole transporting layer (HTL).5,6 Evolved from dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs),7,8 TiO2, ZnO, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) etc. have been widely used for the ETL,9,10 and NiOx, PEDOT:PSS, and spiro-OMeTAD for the HTL.11,12 Among these materials, the inorganic metal oxides usually require a high temperature (400–500 °C) deposition process, which significantly limits the choice of possible substrates and inhibits their large-scale production.10,13 For the organic materials, although they can be processed at a much lower temperature (<120 °C), it is quite challenging to use them to achieve long-term stable devices.14–16
Here we demonstrate low-temperature solution-processed inorganic p-type vanadium oxide (VOx) as the HTL in planar-heterojunction PSCs. The device was constructed with a p–i–n structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/VOx/perovskite/PCBM/Al. To obtain high-quality uniform and compact OTP thin films on VOx coated substrates, a solvent-assisted deposition method was employed. The integration of the VOx layer showing high transmittance and quenching efficiency with a fine-tuned OTP layer led to a device efficiency of 14.23% with a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.29 mA cm−2.
The device configuration is shown in Fig. 1a, and the details for the device fabrication are provided in the ESI.† On ITO substrates, a VOx sol was spun and annealed, obtaining a transparent VOx thin film. The value of x in VOx was estimated to be 2.428 by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Fig. S1, ESI†), indicating the presence of oxygen vacancies in the lattice, which can enhance the charge transfer conductivity.17 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of VOx was determined to be −5.36 eV.18 The energy band diagram and work function of the relative materials in our study are presented in Fig. 1b.

The atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the ITO layer and the VOx layer are shown in Fig. 1c and d. After VOx layer coating, tiny particles formed on the surface of the ITO particles, obtaining a thin compact layer (room-mean-square roughness, Rq = 3.81 nm) that can effectively block the electrons and avoid current leakage.10,18–20 Interestingly, the VOx layer coating was able to enhance the wettability of the substrate surface. As shown in the insets of Fig. 1c and d, the contact angle for the VOx coated substrate is only 32.3°, while the contact angle for the bare ITO substrate is 77.8°. This modified surface/interface will benefit the further solution processing procedures on such VOx layers.
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the VOx layers are presented in Fig. 2a. The typical (00l) reflection peaks agree with the layered structure of V2O5·nH2O.21,22 Even at a temperature of 150 °C, the XRD patterns show no obvious change, indicating satisfactory thermal stability of the solution-processed hydrated VOx layer. Fig. 2b shows the transmittance spectra of the VOx layer. It seems that the annealing temperature does not significantly affect the transmittance of the samples. In the range of 500 to 900 nm, the VOx layers present an extremely high transmittance of 95–98%, while in the wavelength range of 300–500 nm the transmittance slightly decreased to ca. 75%.

For the work function (WF) of the VOx layer on ITO substrates, the increase in annealing temperature leads to a slight decrease in the WF from ∼5.25 eV to ∼5.18 eV (Fig. 2c). In previous reports, VOx has been used as the hole extraction layer in organic solar cells.18,19 In order to investigate whether the as-prepared VOx layer is compatible to act as the hole acceptor within OTP absorber based devices, photoluminescence (PL) quenching of perovskite emission was estimated. Fig. 2d shows steady-state PL spectra of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite thin films on glass, PEDOT:PSS and VOx. On glass, CH3NH3PbI3 displays a high PL intensity at 772 nm, while on PEDOT:PSS and VOx the peak intensities are significantly much lower, indicating that both PEDOT:PSS and VOx can effectively extract holes from OTP absorbers. PEDOT:PSS has been widely used as the hole extraction layer in OPVs and inverted PSCs.12 However, PEDOT:PSS is burdened with structural and electrical inhomogeneity and has been demonstrated to be a cause for limited device lifetime.16 Here, the inorganic VOx presents higher quenching efficiency compared with PEDOT:PSS, making it a promising alternative to fabricate long-term stable photovoltaics.
The conductivity of the VOx layer was investigated by I–V measurements (Fig. 2e). VOx layers were firstly spun on glass substrates at different rates. Then, a pair of silver electrodes was deposited by thermal evaporation. For the VOx layer spun at 1000 rpm, a current of 3.41 × 10−2 mA was measured between the electrodes with a bias of 1 V, corresponding to a resistance of 2.93 × 104 Ω. As the spin rate increased to 8000 rpm, the current continuously decreased to 3.43 × 10−3 mA indicating an increased resistance of 2.92 × 105 Ω. Here, it is difficult to calculate the conductivity of the VOx layers since the accurate thickness can hardly be measured. But these results can correlate the VOx layer thickness with the device performance.
VOx layers spun at different rates were employed to fabricate planar-heterojunction PSCs. For the device using a thick VOx layer (1000 rpm), an S-shaped J–V curve was obtained with a fill factor (FF) of 0.47. This implied a large internal resistance of the device. When the spin rate increased to 2000 rpm and then to 4000 rpm, the FF of the device significantly increased to 0.57 and then to 0.68, demonstrating a reduced internal resistance due to more efficient charge transportation in the VOx layer. However, for the VOx layer spun at 8000 rpm, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the device decreased slightly. We propose that this was caused by an incomplete coverage of the VOx layer on the ITO substrate, and the current leakage resulted in the decrease in Voc.
It has been reported that it is a challenge for OTP absorbers to attain high-percentage surface coverage on VOx layers.10 Here we developed a solvent-assisted process for the deposition of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films on VOx coated substrates. Detailed procedures are presented in Fig. 3a. The perovskite precursor solution was prepared with a mixed solvent of dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).23 During the spin-coating process, an orthogonal solvent of toluene was applied to quench the wet film (step-3), leading to the formation of an intermediate phase of (CH3NH3)2Pb3I8(DMSO)2 (step-4). After thermal annealing (TA), the intermediate phase transformed to the perovskite phase completely (step-5-1). Attributing to the hydrophilic surface of the VOx layer, a perovskite thin film with high percentage coverage formed. To further improve the quality of the perovskite thin films, a solvent annealing (SA) process was employed (step-5-2). After spin-coating, the intermediate phase film was place in a Petri dish. Then, 10 μl of DMF was dripped in the Petri dish and covered tightly. In DMF vapor, the intermediate phase was annealed at 100 °C for 20 min. Since both PbI2 and CH3NH3I have high solubility in DMF, the DMF vapor provided a wet environment so that the ions and molecules could diffuse more effectively, promoting crystal growth and forming highly crystallized perovskite thin films.

(f) XRD patterns of PbI2, intermediate phase of (CH3NH3)2Pb3I8(DMSO)2, and TA and SA processed CH3NH3PbI3 layers. (g) Steady-state PL spectra of TA and SA processed CH3NH3PbI3 layers on glass. 
The morphology of the OTP thin films was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and AFM measurements. On VOx coated substrates, the orthogonal solvent quenching process effectively yielded perovskite layers with full coverage for both TA and SA, as shown in Fig. 3b and c. However, there are many pinholes between or on the domains for TA films, leading to quite a rough surface with Rq of ca. 74.0 nm (Fig. 3d). In contrast, the SA film was quite compact along with significantly less pinholes, showing a reduced Rq of ca. 24.3 nm (Fig. 3e). This compact and smooth surface would enhance the light harvesting ability of the OTP film and facilitate the charge transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/ETL interface. In the ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) absorption spectra of TA and SA perovskite films, no significant difference can be found in the wavelength range of 300–600 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). For the reduced absorption at over 800 nm, it was caused by inhibited light scattering due to the more compact morphology of the SA sample.
XRD measurements were performed to investigate the crystallization process, as shown in Fig. 3f. Due to the strong coordination between DMSO and PbI2, a stable intermediate phase of (CH3NH3)2Pb3I8(DMSO)2, which exhibits three peaks between 5° and 10°, can form in the solvent-assisted deposition process. After TA or SA, strong peaks at 14.4° and 28.7° emerged, which are indexed to the (110) and (220) planes of the tetragonal crystal structure. Compared with TA films, SA films show much sharper peaks along with higher intensities, indicating increased crystallinity with fewer low-dimensional defects.
The steady-state PL spectra of TA and SA perovskite films on glass substrates were also compared, as shown in Fig. 3g. Both TA and SA perovskite films exhibit a PL peak at 772 nm, which is in agreement with data reported elsewhere,11 while the peak intensity for the SA perovskite film is much higher than that of the TA sample. The enhanced PL intensity indicates that the SA perovskite film has fewer defects, which would benefit the fabrication of high-performance photovoltaics.
Upon optimization, a champion device showing a PCE of over 14% was fabricated. Fig. 4a plots the J–V curves of the champion device measured with reverse (1.2 V to −0.2 V) and forward (−0.2 V to 1.2 V) scans. The corresponding photovoltaic performance parameters of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE are summarized in the embedded table. Almost no hysteresis phenomenon can be observed in this VOx based device, showing a PCE of 14.23% for reverse scan and 14.14% for forward scan. This is mainly due to the high charge extraction efficiency of the VOx layer and high quality of the SA perovskite layer. Besides, the device showed high external quantum efficiency (EQE), peaking close to 90% (Fig. 4b). The integrated current density based on the EQE spectrum is 21.07 mA cm−2, which is consistent with the results obtained in J–V measurements.

(c) Stabilized output at the maximum power point (bias of 0.74 V) of device. (d) Dependence of Voc on light intensity of the device. 
To further confirm the accurate PCE, the photocurrent was measured as a function of time at the maximum power point at 0.74 V (Fig. 4c). The photocurrent density increased to 19.00 mA cm−2 within seconds, and then stabilized at 19.10 mA cm−2 for hundred seconds. The calculated efficiency of 14.13% confirmed that the efficiencies measured in J–V tests were close to the accurate values. The charge recombination in the device was investigated by plotting the dependence of Jsc and Voc on light intensity (I) (Fig. 4d). The results show that Jsc is linear with light intensity, indicating no significant charge recombination under short-circuit conditions. The slope of Vocvs. ln(I) is 0.041, which corresponds to 1.6kBT/q, suggesting that the recombination is a combination of monomolecular and bimolecular processes.24 The suppressed recombination for SA based devices may be attributed to the improved morphology and defect-less property of the SA perovskite layer.23
We have developed a facile low-temperature solution-processed VOx layer with high transparency and high quenching efficiency as the hole extraction material for PSCs. Using a solvent-assisted deposition process, high-quality uniform and compact OTP thin films could be deposited on such VOx coated substrates to fabricate a planar-heterojunction PSC that shows a PCE of over 14%. Our results provide a new option for selecting an inorganic p-type contact material for photovoltaics and other semiconductor devices. Further investigations of VOx based durable devices for accelerated aging tests are currently underway.
