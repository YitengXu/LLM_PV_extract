In this work, the direct growth of ZnO seed layers on graphene via H2O-based atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been investigated. It is found that uniform ZnO thin films can be deposited on graphene via ALD using a combination of single-layer graphene/Cu stacks as substrates and a facile pre-H2O treatment process. After growing ZnO nanorods on graphene, its photovoltaic application in a Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell is demonstrated. The performance of graphene-based cells approaches that of ITO-based cells with similar architectures, highlighting that graphene is a potential replacement for ITO in optoelectronic devices. The method reported herein for fabricating ZnO nanorods on graphene using ALD–ZnO as seed layers preserves its properties, and is thus applicable to a wide variety of graphene-based nanoelectronic devices.
Introduction
The good electrical properties, high optical transparency, as well as excellent chemical and mechanical robustness of graphene make it a potential replacement for indium tin oxide (ITO) as transparent and conductive electrodes in optoelectronic devices.1,2 In the mean time, semiconducting nanorods (NRs) in a three-dimensional (3D) architecture has promising applications in optoelectronic devices because it can provide efficient charge generation, collection and transfer due to the large junction area and short distance to the interface.3 Growth of 3D semiconducting NRs on graphene therefore opens new opportunities in developing efficient optoelectronic devices, such as ultraviolet photodetectors and solar cells.4–6
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is arguably the most developed material for NR growth on graphene.7,8 Kim et al. reported the first example for the growth of ZnO NRs on graphene using metal–organic vapor phase epitaxy (MOVPE).9 However, as reported by Wang et al., metal oxides only nucleate at the edge/defect sites of pristine graphene.10 So in the MOVPE process oxygen plasma treatments are necessitated to create surface dangling bonds on graphene, which destroys its beneficial properties. Growing ZnO on graphene using a hydrothermal method is attractive for the advantages of low-temperature processability over a large area, easy adoption, and low cost.11–13 A critical step for the hydrothermal growth of ZnO NRs is the deposition of a uniform ZnO seed layer, which is usually obtained by annealing a layer of ZnO precursor solution spin-coated on the growth substrate. However, the low surface energy and hydrophobic nature of pristine graphene result in poor wetting by the ZnO precursor solution, leading to non-uniform ZnO seed layers.14 Park et al. employed an organic interfacial layer (OIL) to wet the graphene surface in order to obtain a uniform ZnO seed layer.6 However, the introduction of OIL will, on the one hand, increase the overall device resistance even if charges can be transferred through the OIL; on the other hand, it will make the fabrication process complicated. It is still a challenge to directly grow ZnO seed layers on graphene without impairing its beneficial properties.
In this work, H2O-based atomic layer deposition (ALD) is employed to address the challenge. ALD guarantees excellent film uniformity due to the surface-saturated and self-limiting reaction mechanism,15 and thus ALD is a powerful method to prepare seed layers for NR growth. For instance, Li et al. used atomic-layer-deposited ZnO (ALD–ZnO) as seed layers to grow ZnO NRs on carbon nanotubes.16 When considering graphene, graphene's stable and inert sp2 structures result in poor wetting by H2O and hence hinder the uniform deposition of ZnO. Though the direct deposition of ALD–Al2O3 on graphene has been reported,17,18 there is no report on the direct deposition of ALD–ZnO on graphene. This may be due to the fact that Al2O3 is easier to deposit than ZnO because trimethyl aluminum (TMA) has a higher activity than diethylzinc (DEZ) (TMA and DEZ are the metal–organic precursors of Al2O3 and ZnO, respectively). Herein the deposition of ALD–ZnO seed layers on graphene is systematically investigated.
Cu2ZnSn(SxSe1−x)4 (CZTSSe) has been extensively studied as an absorber material because all of its elements are naturally abundant and non-toxic. In addition, it has excellent photovoltaic properties, including a high optical absorbance coefficient (>104 cm−1) and a direct band gap of 1.4–1.5 eV.19,20 To date, the highest PCE of the CZTSSe solar cell is only ∼13%,21 much lower than the theoretical limits. The conversion efficiencies of thin film solar cells may be further improved taking the advantages of nanostructures.22 Therefore, many effects have been devoted to the incorporation of nanostructures into CZTSSe solar cells (i.e., superstrate CZTSSe solar cells).23–25 So, in this work, after growing ZnO NRs on graphene by a simple hydrothermal method, it is integrated into superstrate CZTSSe solar cells as an example of its applications in optoelectronic devices. Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 1.01% is obtained for graphene-based ZnO(NRs)/CZTSSe superstrate solar cells, approaching the best PCE of ITO-based devices with similar architectures (1.2%).26 The results imply that graphene/ZnO (NRs) has promising applications in optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
CVD synthesis of graphene
Graphenes with three different thicknesses, namely 1, 3 and 7 layers are employed in this work. The graphenes are synthesized via low pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) as reported elsewhere.27 Briefly, the substrate (copper foil) is first cleaned at 1000 °C for 30 min under H2 atmosphere, CH4 is introduced thereafter for 25 min. The graphene thickness is controlled by varying the chamber pressure.
Graphene transfer
First PMMA (5% in anisole) is spun coated on graphene at 3000 rpm for 60 s, and cured at 120 °C for 2 min. The copper substrates are etched away using FeCl3 solution (∼0.8 M). The floating graphene films are then washed several times using deionized water before picked up using target substrates. The PMMA film is removed as follows: first a drop of PMMA–anisole solution is used to soften the PMMA film,28 then it is immersed in acetone for 24 h.
ZnO deposited via ALD
The ZnO is deposited using a Picosun ALD R200 Advanced, with water and DEZ as precursors. A full cycle consists of 0.1 s pulse of water, followed by a 6 s nitrogen purge; 0.1 s pulse of DEZ, followed by a 5 s nitrogen purge. The flow rate of nitrogen for water and DEZ are respectively 200 and 150 sccm. Thickness of ∼10 nm is obtained with 100 cycles, corresponding to ∼0.1 nm per cycle.
Pre-H2O treatments
The pre-H2O treatments are conducted as follows: before the deposition of ZnO, liquid water is introduced into ALD chamber, and the water dosage is determined by the pre-H2O treatment cycle numbers. A full pre-H2O treatment cycle consists of 0.1 s pulse of water, followed by a 4 s nitrogen purge. In this work, 1–3 cycles of pre-H2O treatment are used.
Hydrothermal growth of ZnO NRs
The growth solution consists of 0.05 M zinc acetate dihydrate (40 mL) and 0.05 M hexamethylenetetramine (40 mL). The reaction is conducted at 93.5 °C for 2 h in an autoclave. After being taken out, the ZnO NRs are rinsed with deionized water, and air-dried.
Deposition of CdS
Before the deposition of CdS, graphene/ZnO NRs are annealed in air at 300 °C for 10 min to remove residual water and organics. The CdS buffer layer is deposited using the nanocrystal layer deposition (NCLD) method.29 The ZnO NRs are immersed in a solution containing 0.01 M CdCl2 and 0.01 M thioacetamide for 50 min at room temperature.
Deposition of CZTSSe
CZTSSe is deposited according to a previous report.30 Briefly, a transparent yellow precursor solution is obtained by mixing CuCl2, SnCl2, ZnCl2 and thioacetamide together. It is then spin-coated onto substrates at 2000 rpm for 1 min, followed by baking at 150 °C for 10 min. This process is repeated two times. Finally it is selenized in a graphite box at 500 °C for 20 min using a rapid thermal process (RTP) oven.
Device fabrication
Au is deposited on the CZTSSe film as the front electrode, and Ag paste is used as the rare electrode. The active area of the device is 0.09 cm2.
Characterizations
Raman spectra are acquired using Renishaw inVia-Reflex with 532 nm wavelength incident laser light. Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) is carried out using a JEOL-2100F, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is performed using a JEOL-2010. Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) is performed using Oxford INCA X-MAX. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns are measured on a Panalytical X'Pert PRO system using Cu-Kα radiation in the diffraction angle (2θ) range of 20–70°. Transmittance spectra are obtained on a Shimadzu UV-3600 in the range of 300–800 nm. The solar cells are tested under Air Mass 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, the light density is calibrated using a standard cell, SRC-1000-TC-QZ, VLSI Standards S/N: 10510-0305). The device is illuminated from the graphene side (i.e., from the bottom). The J–V data are recorded using a Keithley 2400 SourceMeter and IPCE is obtained using a solar cell QE/IPCE measurement system (Zolix solar cell scan100) in the range 300–1000 nm.
Results and discussion
In a H2O-based ALD process, water molecules are physically absorbed on graphene and act as nucleate sites. Therefore, the uniformity of ZnO seed layers is mainly determined by the wetting of graphene by H2O. However, graphene's stable and inert sp2 structures result in poor wetting by H2O and therefore lead to non-uniform ZnO seed layers. Here we show that uniform ZnO seed layers can be grown on graphene by taking advantage of a combination of the interactions of graphene with substrate and a facile pre-H2O treatment process.17,18 The chamber temperature is first set to 100 °C because H2O molecules tend to escape from graphene surface at a higher temperature while at lower temperature globules are easy to form due to the large inter-molecule attraction of H2O.17 Graphene is synthesized by low-pressure chemical vapour deposition.27 As shown in Fig. 1a (Raman spectra) and 1b (transmittance spectra), 1-(black curve), 3-(red curve) and 7-layer (blue curve) graphene can be obtained by controlling chamber pressure. First 1-layer graphene (single-layer graphene, SLG) is used because the wetting by H2O decreases with increasing graphene thickness.31 SLG is then transferred onto SiO2/Si substrates and we try to directly grow ZnO seed layers on SLG utilizing the polar sites generated by the interactions of SiO2 with graphene.17 However, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), only dewetted ZnO islands are observed, which means poor wetting of graphene by H2O in this case.14 Besides, the EDX spectrum shows that the content of Zn is only ∼2.4%. This may be due to the fact that the interactions of SiO2 with graphene cannot produce enough polar sites for H2O molecules to anchor. So the SiO2 substrate (insulating) is then replaced by copper substrate (metallic) because it has been demonstrated that the wetting by H2O is greatly enhanced when graphene is in contact with metallic substrates.18,32 As expected, much higher coverage of ZnO is achieved (Fig. 2a). Moreover, the EDX spectrum (Fig. S2, ESI†) shows that the Zn content increases to ∼14%, which is also indicative of a much higher coverage of ZnO. However, careful examination reveals that bare graphene (not covered by ZnO) still exists. This is in contrast to the results obtained by Dlubak et al., who show that nearly full coverage of Al2O3 is achieved using the SLG/Cu substrate.18 We ascribe the divergence to the different activities of TMA and DEZ, i.e., Al2O3 is easier to deposit than ZnO.

(b) With two cycles of pre-H2O treatments, uniform ZnO is obtained. (c) AFM images of ZnO seed layer, the Rq is 7.05 nm. (d) TEM image of a cross-section ZnO/graphene/Cu stack, the thickness of ZnO is ∼10 nm after 100 cycles. 
In the next step, a simple pre-H2O treatment process is utilized to obtain full coverage of ZnO on graphene (i.e., before the deposition of ZnO, liquid water is introduced into the ALD chamber and the water dosage is controlled by the pre-H2O cycle numbers, see the Experimental section).17 As seen in Fig. 2b, ZnO is deposited uniformly on graphene when 2 cycles of pre-H2O treatment are applied. The uniformity of ZnO seed layers is then characterized using atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 2c, the surface roughness (Rq) of ZnO seed layer is 7.05 nm, better than that obtained by spin-coating (the Rq of ZnO prepared by spin-coating is in the range of 20–40 nm, see ref. 6). The cross-section transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) image (Fig. 2d) clearly shows the ZnO/Graphene/Cu structure; the thickness of ZnO is ∼10 nm after 100 ALD cycles, corresponding to ∼0.1 nm per cycle. It is found that the number of pre-H2O treatment cycles has considerable effects on the uniformity of ZnO seed layers. As shown in Fig. 3a, when 1 cycle of pre-H2O treatment is applied, the ZnO film is not continuous and pinholes are observed. When the ALD cycles increase to 2 (Fig. 2b), uniform ZnO is formed and no noticeable defects (e.g., pinholes and cracks) are observed. Further increasing the cycles to 3 (Fig. 3b), pinholes reappear, which is due to the excessive absorption of H2O molecules on graphene.17 In addition to pre-H2O treatment, graphene thickness and chamber temperature can also affect the uniformity of ZnO seed layers. The effects of the thickness of graphene are first studied. Here 3- and 7-layer graphenes (Fig. 1) are utilized for comparison. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), though ZnO can also be deposited on graphene (3,7)/Cu (graphene (X) denotes X-layer graphene), the ZnO film is no longer uniform. Careful examination discloses that pinholes/nanoparticles are formed. This can be explained by two reasons. First, as graphene becomes thicker, the wetting by H2O decreases. Second, the interactions between graphene and Cu substrates are reduced as graphene becomes thicker, which leads to reduced polar sites on the graphene surface. The chamber temperature also has some influence on the uniformity of ZnO seed layers. It is found that uniform ZnO seed layers can be deposited on graphene in the range of 97–103 °C. As seen in Fig. S4 (ESI†), at 96 °C (b) or 104 °C (c), the ZnO seed layers are still uniform, but voids/pinholes are observed. Further decrease (90 °C, a) or increase (110 °C, d) in chamber temperature lead to non-uniform ZnO seed layers. From the above discussions, it is clear that uniform ZnO seed layers can be deposited on graphene using SLG/Cu substrate together with 2 cycles of pre-H2O treatment in the range of 97–103 °C.

One main goal of this work is to preserve the beneficial properties of graphene during the fabrication process. Fig. 4 presents the Raman spectra of graphene before and after deposition of ZnO. Clearly there are few changes in the intensity of D-band, indicating that the H2O-based ALD process does not introduce defects or disorders in graphene. Moreover, ZnO has a p-doping effect on graphene (the 2D peak has a blueshift of 4.3 cm−1, the inset of Fig. 4), which is consistent with ZnO prepared via sol–gel and MeV electron beam.33,34 This is due to the fact that ZnO has a larger work function than graphene (the work function of ZnO and graphene is 5.1 and 4.6–4.9 eV, respectively), whereby p doping occurs because the electron charges transfer from graphene to ZnO.

Moreover, the G and 2D bands show blueshift of 4.3 cm−1 (the inset), indicating the p doping effect of ZnO. 
ZnO NRs–graphene hybrid structure is then fabricated using a simple hydrothermal method,35 we fabricate graphene-based ZnO(NRs)/CZTSSe superstrate solar cells. Before the deposition of CZTSSe, CdS is coated on ZnO NRs as a buffer layer using the nanocrystal layer deposition (NCLD) method.29 CZTSSe is prepared using an ethanol-based approach.30 The crystal structures of the nanostructures are characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and the results are listed in Fig. 5. Bare ZnO NRs exhibit a sharp peak at 34.4° (ZnO(002)), indicating that the ZnO NRs grow along the c axis. After NCLD deposition, CdS(100), (002) and (101) peaks appear. After CZTS deposition and selenization, three dominant diffraction peaks, which are assigned as CZTSSe(112), (204) and (312), are observed. Enlarged XRD patterns (Fig. S5, ESI†) show that the (112) peak move towards higher 2θ (∼0.3 degree) compared to that of pure CZTSe due to the remaining sulfur atoms. The EDX spectrum (Fig. 6a) shows that the ratio of Cu:Zn:Sn:S:Se is 2:0.74:0.82:0.58:3.64, indicating that 86.3% of S atoms are replaced by Se atoms after selenization. In addition, the Raman spectrum (Fig. 6b) shows two peaks at 217 and 326 cm−1, which is the typical bi-modal observed on the CZTSSe alloy.36

The morphology changes are observed using scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and the results are displayed in Fig. 7. The diameter and length of ZnO NRs are estimated to be ∼40 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†) and ∼500 nm (Fig. 7c), respectively. After CdS coating, the diameter of CdS-coated ZnO NRs is increased to ∼90 nm (Fig. 7a), and thus the thickness of the CdS buffer layer is calculated to be ∼25 nm. Fig. 7b and d present the SEM images after CZTSSe coating. As seen, the thickness increases to 1.2 μm, meaning that all ZnO NRs are buried underneath the CZTSSe film. Besides, no obvious voids/cracks are observed. The photovoltaic response of the graphene-based device is tested under AM 1.5G conditions and the results are given in Fig. 8. The PCE of graphene-based devices is 1.01%, with Jsc = 6.3 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.5 V and FF = 0.32. The Jsc calculated from the IPCE curve (the inset of Fig. 8) is 6.2 mA cm−2, close to the experimental value. The IPCE curve shows a weak response at λ > 540 nm (IPCE < 25%), indicating low collection efficiency due to the high recombination losses in the CZTSSe film and depletion region.37 In addition, the IPCE drops continuously at λ > 500 nm, also indicative of high recombination losses in CZTSSe films and depletion region.38 Therefore, the high recombination losses in CZTSSe films and depletion region are mainly responsible for the low PCE. A possible reason that leads to high recombination losses is the inter-diffusion of CdS at the CZTSSe/CdS interface during selenization.39 Therefore, developing low-temperature processed but high-quality CZTSSe films are essential for high-performance superstrate CZTSSe solar cells. The low FF can be explained by taking shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) into account. The calculated Rsh (the slope at V = 0) is ∼70 Ω and Rs (the slope at I = 0) is ∼170 Ω. The Rs is very high compared with the well-behaved CIGS solar cell (PCE = 15.5% and FF = 0.768, Rs = 2 Ω).40 The low Rsh and high Rs together contribute to the low FF. It is worth noting that the PCE of our graphene-based device approaches the highest PCE of ITO-based superstrate ZnO(NRs)/CZTSSe solar cells with similar architectures (PCE = 1.2%, see ref. 26, see Table S1, ESI† for details), highlighting the great potential of graphene/ZnO(NRs) in optoelectronic devices.

Conclusions
To sum up, the deposition of ZnO seed layers on graphene by ALD is systematically studied. Direct and nondestructive deposition of uniform ALD–ZnO seed layers on graphene is achieved using SLG/Cu stack as substrates together with a facile pre-H2O treatment process at 100 °C. After hydrothermally growing ZnO NRs on graphene, superstrate CZTSSe solar cell employing graphene/ZnO NRs is fabricated as an example of its application in optoelectronic devices. The performance of graphene-based ZnO(NRs)/CZTSSe device is comparable to that of ITO-based devices. Our work demonstrates that graphene has great potential as transparent and conductive electrodes in optoelectronic devices. The method enables the growth of ZnO nanorods on graphene using ALD–ZnO as seed layers without impairing its beneficial properties, and therefore it can find applications in graphene-based nanoelectronic devices.
