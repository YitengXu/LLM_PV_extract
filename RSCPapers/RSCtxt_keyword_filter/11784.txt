    , Accepted 23rd February 2016First published on 3rd March 2016AbstractA completely flexible fiber-shaped dye sensitized solar cell has been truly realized for the first time, due to a novel photoanode with a TiO2 micron-cone-nanowire array structure prepared by a simple two-step process. The TiO2 micron-cone array, made using an electrochemical method, is used as a frame for a novel photoanode, with its roots sinking deep down into a Ti wire substrate. The TiO2 nanowire array is coated onto the TiO2 micron-cone surface by a hydrothermal reaction to form a dye-adsorption layer to the enhance power conversion efficiency of the novel device. With a high dye-adsorption capacity and strong combination between the TiO2 micron-cone and Ti substrate, the minimum bending radius of the photoanode could reach 0.45 mm, and 96.6% retention of the initial conversion efficiency was obtained after bending 100 times.
1. Introduction
As a renewable wearable power resource, the fiber-shaped dye-sensitized solar cell (FDSSC), which possesses stitchability and interface/marginal effects on mesoscopic and microscopic levels respectively, can meet civil needs and some special applications for soldiers in the field. So the fiber-shaped photovoltaic device has great value for research, and is considered to be a promising commercial energy conversion device with many advantages.1–6 The TiO2 layer structure of photoanodes is a key factor that affects flexibility, stability and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of FDSSCs. TiO2 micro-structure types include nanocrystalline,7,8 nanowire,9–11 nanotube,12,13 nanosheet,14 nanorod,15 and so on. Preparation methods of TiO2 layers generally include an electrochemical anodic oxidation process, and solvothermal methods.
To enhance the flexibility of FDSSCs, a TiO2 layer with a one-dimensional nanostructure has been introduced as a photoanode active layer, which is a crucial approach.16 TiO2 nanotubes were applied as an active layer to enhance FDSSC performance greatly.17–19 Among these, only Lv et al. investigated the variation of device performance under bending states of FDSSCs, and the results showed that when the curvature radius of the device decreased to 1 cm, the PCE droped by 10% because of damage to the TiO2 layer.18 It is clear that both TiO2 nanocrystalline and nanotube layers embody rigidity and fragility along fiber longitudinal axes during the bending of the device. To solve the cracking problem of the TiO2 layer, Li et al. prepared a mixture layer containing nanocrystalline TiO2 and PVDF nanowires using a spray-assisted electrospinning method, and used it as semiconductor layer, which led to the micro-structure of the photoanode being more stable and the device performance without degradation at the bending state.20 However, this method has not been suitable for FDSSCs.
Using an alkali hydrothermal method, Wang et al. and Chen et al. prepared TiO2 nanowire arrays (TW) on Ti wire as photoanodes, and obtained devices with PCEs of 0.86% and 5.38%, respectively.21,22 Guo et al. and Cai et al. prepared TW on carbon fibers and obtained FDSSCs with high flexibility and PCEs of 1.28% and 2.48%, respectively.23,24 When external pressure was applied to the device with a bending radius of 1.5 cm, the PCE dropped to 80% of the initial value, resulting from damage of the hierarchical TW film on carbon fiber substrate.24 As a whole, photovoltaic devices with TiO2 one-dimensional nanostructures possess a high flexibility, but complete flexibility has not been realized for FDSSCs, and their structure has been brittle too. In all sorts of preparation methods for fiber-shaped photoanodes, the combination between TiO2 layer and substrate was insecure, resulting in interspace between them under the bending state of the device.
Herein, a completely flexible photoanode with a TiO2 micron-cone-nanowire array (TCW) for novel FDSSCs was introduced for the first time. The TiO2 micron-cone arrays (TC) avoided extrusion and cracking under the bending condition, and improved the flexibility of FDSSCs. Additionally, the TW increased the dye-absorption, which improved the PCE of the novel device.
2. Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the photoanode with TCW
A schematic illustration of TCW growth on Ti wire is shown in Fig. 1. Ti wires with a diameter of 250 μm (99.7%, purchased from Alfa Aesar) were cleaned by supersonic treatment in acetone and ethanol for 30 min in advance, and subjected to a mixture solution of hydrofluoric (10 wt%) and hydrochloric (10 wt%) acids for 1 min to carry out the activation treatment. As shown in Fig. S1,† the pre-treated Ti wires, a platinum sheet and sulfuric acid solution of 1 mol L−1 were used as anode, cathode and electrolyte, respectively. The Ti wire was anodized under a certain constant voltage of 20–100 V for several hours at a certain temperature of 10–80 °C to form the Ti/TC electrode.

TW was coated onto the surface of the TC by a hydrothermal reaction using titanium potassium oxalate as the titanium source. A mixed solution composed of 0.6 g titanium potassium oxalate dihydrate, 30 mL diethylene glycol and 12 mL deionized water was magnetically stirred to be uniform. The anodized Ti wire and the final mixed solution were transferred into a 50 mL Teflon lined stainless steel autoclave. The sealed autoclave was heated at 180 °C in an electric oven for 6 hours and then cooled down at room temperature. The resulting Ti wire was taken out and rinsed with deionized water, followed by sintering for 2 h at 500 °C in a muffle furnace, subsequently immersed in 0.2 mol L−1 TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min, and then sintered for 30 min at 450 °C in air to form the Ti/TCW electrode. The final electrodes were placed into N719 (purchased from Dalian Heptachroma, China) ethanol solution (0.5 mol L−1) for 24 h. Finally, after being rinsed with anhydrous alcohol, the dye-sensitized electrodes were obtained and used as photoanodes.
2.2 Fabrication of FDSSCs
According to previous reports,25–28 the fiber photoanode was twisted with Pt wire (diameter 40 μm) as shown in Fig. S2,† and then inserted into a flexible, transparent plastic capillary tube filled with typical iodine electrolyte of 0.5 mol L−1 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.05 mol L−1 I2, 0.05 mol L−1 LiClO4, 0.5 mol L−1 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 0.05 mol L−1 guanidine thiocyanate in acetonitrile. The tube was sealed by molten wax.
2.3 Measurements and characterization
A Keithley Model 2000 under a simulated solar lamp (YSS-50A, Yamashita DESO, Japan) was used to simulate AM 1.5G illumination, with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and to acquire current–voltage curves and short-circuit photocurrent responses. A standard silicon solar cell was used for calibration. Traditionally, the effective area of a FDSSC is calculated by multiplying the length and diameter of the photoanode.29–33 A Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to observe the morphologies of the fiber photoanodes. XRD patterns were obtained using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker, D8 Advance) operated at 100 mA and 40 kV with CuKα radiation. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was recorded on a Newport 1918-c power meter under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon light source (Oriel) with an Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator in DC mode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using PGSTAT302N (Autolab Corp., Switzerland), scanned in dark conditions at a bias of −0.70 V with an amplitude of 10 mV in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Controllable growth of TC
To explore the effects of reaction conditions including temperature, anodization voltage and time on the morphology of TC, the growth conditions were optimized systematically. Under the same reaction time (10 h) and anodization voltage (50 V), Fig. 2a and c shows that the TC height increased from 14.2 μm to 19 μm along with the rise of temperature from 10 °C to 80 °C. As shown in Fig. 2c–f, for the 80 °C and 10 h conditions, the cone height increased from 1.51 μm to 27.5 μm with the change of anodization voltage from 20 V to 100 V. From Fig. 2c, g–i, the cone grew tall from 0 to 23.8 μm with the increase of reaction time at 50 V and 80 °C. Therefore, a conclusion was drawn that the cone height increased with the elevation of reaction temperature and voltage. Combining the results from Fig. 2 and S3,† we also found that the cone density increased with the rise of temperature, and reduced with voltage increasing.

Fig. 3 shows the microstructure of a single TiO2 micron-cone and the favorable flexibility of the Ti/TC electrode. The TiO2 cone composed of TiO2 nanosheets with a thickness of about 110 nm was an alternating solid body. Fig. 3a shows that a third of the cone body went deep inside the Ti fiber, resulting in an enhanced binding force between the TiO2 layer and Ti substrate, improving the flexible degree of the Ti/TC electrode shown in Fig. 3d.

3.2 Morphology and flexibility of the Ti/TCW photoanode

Fig. 4 shows that a TW layer with a diameter of almost 300 nm and thickness of about 7 μm (shown in Fig. S4†) was uniformly coated onto the surfaces of the Ti fiber substrate and Ti/TC electrode by the hydrothermal reaction. XRD patterns of Ti, Ti/TC and Ti/TCW show strong diffraction peaks at 2θ = 25.2 and 48.1, corresponding to the mirror faces of anatase (101) and (200), as shown in Fig. 4e. These diffraction peaks confirmed that both TW and TC exist as pure anatase crystals, which is favorable for obtaining fiber solar cells with high PCEs.8

To compare the bending effect, SEM images of the Ti/TCW and Ti/TW electrodes with different bending states were obtained. In Fig. 5, the flexibility property of the Ti/TCW electrode was compared with the Ti/TW electrode under different bending degrees. The Ti/TCW electrode showed better flexibility performance. As shown in Fig. 5a and b, the TCW layer was nearly unchanged with a bending radius of 2.7 mm of the electrode. When the bending radius decreased to 0.45 mm, slight cracks appeared in the TiO2 layer, but the TCW didn't fall off of the substrate due to the strong combination between TC and the Ti substrate. However, the TiO2 layers of the Ti/TW electrode and Ti/TiO2 nanocrystalline layer electrode fell off of the fiber substrate when bending radius reached about 0.9 mm, as shown in Fig. 5e and f and S5.† So the TCW possessed the best flexibility.

3.3 Device performance
The effect of different photoanodes, including Ti/TC (T-1), Ti/TW (T-2), and Ti/TCW with various cone heights (T-3–T-5), on the photovoltaic conversion performance and IPCE of FDSSCs is presented in Fig. 6 and Table 1. Among these, all of the TW layers were prepared under the same conditions. From Table 1, it can be seen that both the short current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) of T-1, with the minimum amount of dye-adsorption capacity, were the lowest. Meanwhile, along with the increase of TC height from 0 (T-2) to 23.8 μm (T-5), the dye-adsorption capacity was enhanced from 5.17 nmol cm−1 to 10.78 nmol cm−1, which is good for improving the PCE and Jsc. As shown in Fig. 6a, the change trend of PCE is similar with Jsc, first increased from 3.61% (T-2) to 4.75% (T-4) due to the increase of dye-adsorption, and then decreased to 4.10% (T-5). Fig. 6b shows that the IPCE curves of the FDSSCs increased with the growth of TC height, and then decreased with a further increase in the TC height, which agrees with the evolution of the energy conversion efficiency (Fig. 6a). However, the Voc gradually decreased from 0.702 V (T-2) to 0.644 V (T-5). To further understand these variations in the electrochemistry parameters, EIS analyses were performed in dark conditions under a forward bias of −0.7 V.

EIS curves and simulated results are shown in Fig. 7 and Table 1. In the simplified equivalent circuit for the FDSSCs, Rs and RPt are on behalf of the internal resistance and the charge-transfer resistance at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, respectively, and Rct is the charge-transfer resistance related to the recombination of electrons at the TiO2/electrolyte interface. Along with the growth of TC height, the electron-recombination resistance (Rct) of the FDSSCs gradually decreased from 340.0 ohm cm (T-3) to 169.4 ohm cm (T-5), which indicated that the increasing TC length led to a more serious electron recombination phenomenon because of the long transfer distance, resulting in decreasing Voc and limiting the enhancement of Jsc.22 Both the dye-absorption and electron-recombination resistance affect the Jsc and Voc of the FDSSCs, where both parameters correlate to the TC height. Therefore, the PCE of T-5 was lower than that of T-4 with the highest PCE.

The excellent flexibility was the most striking feature of the novel fiber device based on Ti/TCW photoanodes. Fig. 8 presents the effect of different bending radiuses and bending times on the photovoltaic performance of the novel device, which is calculated from Fig. S6.† During the bending test process, fluctuations of Voc and fill factor were both in a relatively tight range, and the PCE of the device varied with Jsc. As shown in Fig. 8a and S6a,† when the bending radius decreased to 1 cm, the PCE reduced from 4.75% to 4.59%, and the retention rate of the device performance reached up to 96.6% of the initial value. Additionally, it can be observed from Fig. 8b and S6b† that the PCE attenuation rate of the device was less than 2.4% after bending 100 times with a bending radius of 2 cm. By contrast, the flexibility of this novel FDSSC was much better than that of devices reported in the literature.18,24–27

4. Conclusions
A simple two-step method was used to prepare a completely flexible Ti/TCW photoanode for FDSSCs for the first time in this paper. The novel photoanode possessed strong combination between the TiO2 micron-cone and Ti fiber substrate, and a high dye adsorption capacity due to the large surface area of TW, resulting in good flexibility and a high PCE. The minimum bending radius of the novel photoanode could reach 0.45 mm, which means that the Ti/TCW electrode, to the best of our knowledge, is the most flexible Ti-based photoanode. By optimizing TC height, a novel FDSSC with a PCE of 4.75% was obtained. After the bending test, more than 96.6% retention of the initial PCE was retained, which confirmed that the novel FDSSC showed terrific flexibility.
