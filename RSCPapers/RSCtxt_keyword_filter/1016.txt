    , Accepted 16th January 2023First published on 17th January 2023AbstractThe quality of perovskite films is influenced by the crystal growth process and determines the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. The incongruous atomic dispersion of nucleation during the crystallization process is one of the main causes of the degradation of the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. In this study, we employed nucleus-induced epitaxial growth to improve the quality of perovskite films. In doing so, δ-FAPbI3 was introduced into a PbI2 precursor solution to induce the epitaxial growth of perovskite using the δ-phase lattice. Perovskite films prepared by this method displayed uniform and densely packed grains, which exhibited a lower trap density and suppressed nonradiative charge recombination. A power conversion efficiency as high as 23.16% was achieved under optimized conditions. More importantly, the unencapsulated devices maintained more than 90% of the initial power conversion efficiency after being stored in a glovebox filled with N2 for 3200 h, showing very good stability.
Introduction
In the past decade, perovskite solar cells (Pero-SCs) have been developing rapidly, and the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) has reached over 25%.1,2 The excellent photovoltaic performance of Pero-SCs is derived from the advantages of perovskites, such as high carrier mobility, long charge-carrier diffusion lengths, small exciton binding capacity, adjustable bandgaps, and high absorption coefficient.3–7 The performance of Pero-SCs is greatly dependent on the quality (particularly crystallinity) of the perovskite films.8
Theoretically, a quick nucleation and slow crystal growth are prerequisites for high-quality perovskite films in terms of the crystallization orientation and surface morphology.9–11 The heating-boosted nucleation and crystallization of perovskites undergo a complicated and uncontrollable process since the solute and solvent are heterogeneous components.12,13 The incongruous atoms diffuse into nucleation to form an undesirable lattice structure, which results in crystal segregation and defects. These are the main causes of nonradiative charge recombination and are responsible for the deficient charge transportation of carriers in Pero-SCs.14–16 Nucleation, in terms of the rate and density, plays a key role in the quality control of perovskite films but remains a challenge because it is affected by multiple factors, such as the free energy change, volatilization rate of solvents, surface tension, surface roughness, and heat flow.17–19
Numerous efforts have been made to regulate the nucleation of perovskite crystallization, such as additive-assisted deposition,20,21 solvent engineering,22 solvent vapor annealing,23 and interface modification.24 These methods, although effective, are still challenged by their reproducibility and large-scale production.25 Alternatively, introducing external nuclei into precursor solutions to induce crystallization is a feasible approach.26–29 Daoud et al. demonstrated that cryogenic seed-assisted growth can reduce the crystallization temperature for high-quality CsPbI2Br perovskite films.30 Zhu et al. developed a self-seeding method to modulate crystallization by repeatedly rotating perovskite solutions.31 Zhao et al. introduced highly oriented 2D perovskites as seeds to optimize the growth kinetics of 3D perovskites, resulting in a stabilized PCE of 23.95%.32 We summarize some device performances reported in the literature in Table S1 in the ESI† to specify the perovskite composition, nucleus name, and PCE of devices with or without nuclei. Although the PCE of the device can be improved by the induced crystallization of external perovskite nuclei, the perovskite lattice and bandgap may be affected by the introduction of additional components. The idea of introducing an additional cognate nucleus should work on formamidine-based perovskites but to date has not been addressed in the literature. δ-FAPbI3 is a yellow nonactive perovskite phase that is associated with the formation of α-FAPbI3. It has always been considered an undesired product. However, it was found recently that the concomitant existence of δ-FAPbI3 can stabilize the α-phase structure and has no side effect on its absorption edge.33,34
In the current study, a nucleus epitaxial growth (NEG) method was developed by introducing δ-FAPbI3 nucleus clusters into a PbI2 solution, where the delta intermediate phase templatized the epitaxial growth of perovskite in reaction with ammonium halogenate during sequential deposition. The addition of external nuclei substituted for the nucleation process and thus improved the quality of the perovskite films in terms of the crystallinity and compact crystals. The perovskite films prepared with NEG showed a markedly reduced defect density compared to those without NEG, and the champion PCE of the corresponding Pero-SCs was increased from 21.53% to 23.16%. More importantly, the unencapsulated devices based on perovskite films prepared with NEG maintained over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in a nitrogen atmosphere for 3200 h. This study presents a simple and general method for improving the quality of perovskites for high-performance Pero-SCs.
Results and discussion
The preparation of perovskite films by the NEG method is illustrated in Fig. 1a. The perovskite films were prepared by a sequential deposition method, where PbI2 solution containing δ-FAPbI3 nucleus clusters was spin-coated on SnO2, followed by a mixed solution of FAI, MAI, and MACl. The perovskite prepared by PbI2 solution without δ-FAPbI3 clusters was employed as the control. The details of the preparation are described in the experimental section. As shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI,† the XRD peak of the nucleus was located at 11.8°, which proved that the added nucleus was δ-FAPbI3.

Unannealed perovskite films can provide intermediate information for investigating the crystallization kinetics of perovskites, such as nucleation and crystal growth.35,36Fig. 1b shows the evolution of the unannealed perovskite films at 25 °C with 30% relative humidity (RH) for 1 h without annealing. The unannealed perovskite films prepared with or without NEG initially showed a light-yellow color, while those with NEG were more readily tuned into a dark color (implying the formation of the cubic phase) under ambient conditions. These results were further confirmed by the XRD patterns. As shown in Fig. 1c, without any treatment, the as-prepared perovskite film with NEG showed a diffraction peak at 14.04°, the characteristic peak of α-FAPbI3 perovskite,36,37 while this peak was not found in the diffraction pattern of the as-prepared perovskite film without NEG. These results imply that the addition of δ-FAPbI3 facilitated the phase transition of the perovskite. After aging for 60 min, the diffraction peak of the α-FAPbI3 perovskite became very strong for the perovskite film prepared with NEG, while the same diffraction peak was relatively weak for the perovskite film without NEG. These results further confirmed the induced phase transition of perovskite films in the presence of δ-FAPbI3.38
The effect of δ-FAPbI3 on the nucleation and growth of perovskites was investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2a, the addition of δ-FAPbI3 to the PbI2 solution resulted in a redshift of the absorption. It has been well documented that the redshift should be a result of the size expansion of the PbI2 particles,9,39 which was confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. 2b–d, the PbI2 film showed densely packed grains with an average size of 120 nm. Upon the addition of δ-FAPbI3, the average grain size increased to 302 nm, and the grains were loosely packed, which should facilitate the conversion of subsequent organic ammonium salts into perovskite phases.26,40,41

(d) Corresponding size distribution analyzed from the AFM images. (e) XRD patterns and (f) CLSM images of PbI2 films in the presence/absence of δ-FAPbI3. 
Furthermore, the crystallinity of the film in the presence/absence of δ-FAPbI3 nuclei was characterized by XRD (Fig. 2e). In addition to the already existing diffraction peak of δ-FAPbI3 at 11.8°, a new peak at 7.6° appeared in the diffraction pattern, which should be attributed to the chemical interaction of PbI2 with δ-FAPbI3.42 Next, we performed confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) on the films prepared from the precursor solution to analyze the spatial distribution of δ-FAPbI3 in the PbI2 films. From the PL intensity maps (Fig. 2f), we can see that δ-FAPbI3 (yellow emissive spot) was distributed uniformly on the PbI2 films (non-luminescent background in red). As shown in Fig. S2 in the ESI,† the absence of the PL signals for the PbI2 films confirmed that the emission peak in “PbI2 + δ-FAPbI3” originated from the δ-FAPbI3 clusters, which further confirmed the stable presence of δ-FAPbI3 in the PbI2 film.
The kinetics of the crystal growth process can be explained by the Gibbs free energy. The Gibbs free energy can be divided into two parts: the surface free energy (Gs) and volume free energy (Gv).27,43 The maximum Gibbs free energy is called the critical Gibbs free energy G*, corresponding to a particle radius of critical radius r*. Generally, once a new nucleus is formed in the solution, it will spontaneously grow in subsequent reactions only if its particle size is greater than the critical radius r*; otherwise, it will spontaneously decompose (Fig. 3a).32 For the control samples, the crystallization of perovskites did not begin until the critical free energy G* of nucleation was overcome, as shown in region I in Fig. 3b. Taking the perovskite film prepared with NEG as an example, the additional nucleus crystals were larger than the critical radius, so the crystallization of perovskite induced epitaxial growth (Fig. 3c, II region) spontaneously.27 A schematic diagram of the crystallization for the control and the films prepared with NEG is shown in Fig. 3d. Compared to the control group, the distribution of the grains for the perovskite films prepared with NEG was more uniform due to the high density of uniform nucleation and crystal growth. In addition, according to the LaMer model, nucleus-induced crystallization rapidly depletes the solute and reduces the concentration of the solution, thereby inhibiting random nucleation in a solution where epitaxial growth dominates.44 Moreover, Qin et al. revealed the crystallization of mixed perovskites using in situ grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering technology. Their work shows that perovskite crystallization occurs in roughly three stages: (i) precursor solution, (ii) formation of a hexagonal delta phase (2H), and (iii) complexes (4H, 6H intermediate phase, and alpha phase).45 Based on the study above, we could conclude that δ-FAPbI3 provides δ-phase lattices during crystallization, and the presence of δ-phase lattices partially eliminates the first phase of perovskite crystallization (PbI2 → δ-phase), thus promoting the formation of the δ-phase perovskite.

In this case, the crystallization of perovskite could only be triggered after overcoming G* and obtaining a nucleus exceeding r*. (c) Gtot as a function of r for the NEG. In this case, nucleus crystals with a size larger than r* were preformed in the PbI2 film. Thus, the growth of perovskite could commence immediately and preferentially from the nucleus crystals. (d) Schematic diagram of the crystallization for the control and the films prepared with NEG. 
The quality improvement of the perovskite films with NEG was investigated by scanning electron microsope (SEM) and XRD. Fig. S3 in the ESI† shows SEM images of perovskite films fabricated with different concentrations of δ-FAPbI3. The quality of the films improved when the δ-FAPbI3 concentration increased; however, as the concentration further increased to over 6%, the surface of the film was even rougher than that of the control film. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, the perovskite film prepared with NEG had uniform grain sizes and smooth surfaces, while the control showed a wider distributed grain size, and there were wrinkles on the surface. The cross-sectional SEM images also indicated that the quality of the perovskite film was greatly improved by the addition of δ-FAPbI3 to the precursor. As shown in Fig. 4c and d, the perovskite film prepared with NEG showed distinct, continuous cylindrical grains from top to bottom, while there were noncross-film grains in the control sample. The orientation of perovskite crystals plays an important role in the optical properties. Previous reports have shown that α-FAPbI3 films have two main orientations, of which the (111) facet tends to have a higher defect density and the (100) facet has the lowest defects and the highest internal stability.46,47 From the XRD pattern (Fig. S4 in ESI†), it is suggested that the films prepared with NEG had (001) crystal surface selective peaks, while in the control films, in addition to the (001) diffraction peaks, the undesired (111) peak appeared. With increasing the crystal nucleus concentration, the peak strength of (001) and (002) of the film increased gradually, and the peak strength of PbI2 and the undesired (111) crystal lattice was inhibited, demonstrating that the introduction of δ-FAPbI3 promoted the conversion of the perovskite photoactive phase and improved the film crystallinity.

The Pero-SCs were fabricated with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/MoO3/Ag, as shown in Fig. 5a. The photovoltaic properties of Pero-SCs were assessed under AM 1.5 G solar illumination with a power of 100 mW cm−2. δ-FAPbI3 was optimized to a mole ratio of 6%. The J–V curves and corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S5 and Table S2 in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 5b, the performance of the devices based on the perovskite films prepared with NEG was greatly improved. The champion PCE increased from 21.53% (VOC = 1.11 V, JSC = 24.39 mA cm−2, FF = 79.6%) to 23.16% (VOC = 1.15 V, JSC = 24.94 mA cm−2, FF = 80.7%), and VOC increased by 40 mV. The detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. As presented in Fig. 5c, the addition of the nucleus also led to an increase in the average PCE, and the PCE distribution became much narrower. All the photovoltaic parameters extracted from the J–V curves are summarized in Fig. S6 in the ESI.† The EQE curves (Fig. 5d) showed that the integrated current densities (Jints) of the Pero-SCs fabricated with and without NEG were 24.53 and 24.12 mA cm−2, respectively, which were consistent with the JSCs obtained from the J–V curves. The stable power output (SPO) showed that the stable efficiencies were 20.83% and 22.46% for the control and Pero-SCs prepared with NEG, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5e. The hysteresis of the Pero-SCs was evaluated by forward scanning (FS) and reverse scanning (RS) J–V curves, as shown in Fig. 5f and Table S3.† The NEG method decreased the hysteresis factor (h) from 13.85% to 5.41%. The decreased hysteresis should be attributed to the reduced trap density, which will be discussed later.

The performance improvement was investigated from the perovskite films in the following aspects: (1) the bandgaps of perovskite films were evaluated by Tauc plots (Fig. S7 in ESI†). The results show that the introduction of δ-FAPbI3 had little effect on the bandgap of the resulting perovskite films; (2) the Urbach energy (Eu), which is often used for a measure of the electron disorder, was determined by the absorption coefficient versus the photoenergy, as shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI.† The Eu values of the control and perovskite film prepared with NEG were 59.4 and 45.6 meV, respectively. The decreased Eu indicated that the NEG method could effectively reduce the electron disorder of the perovskite film. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) analyses were performed to investigate the effects of NEG on the carrier dynamics in the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. 6a, the PL intensity of the perovskite film prepared with NEG was much higher than that of the control, suggesting that the nonradiative charge recombination should be effectively suppressed due to the improved quality of perovskite films. The spectral improvement was confirmed by the PL mapping characterized by CLSM (Fig. S9 in ESI†), where the perovskite film prepared with NEG showed a much higher average fluorescence intensity. The TRPL spectra supported the results obtained from the steady-state PL. Fig. 6b shows the fluorescence decay of the perovskite films on glass. The decay curves were fitted by a two-exponential model, and the fitted parameters are summarized in Table S4 in the ESI.† The rapid (τ1) and slow decay (τ2) should be assigned to defect-caused nonradiative recombination and carrier radiation recombination, respectively.48 The introduction of NEG resulted in an increase in τ1 from 21.08 to 35.87 ns and τ2 from 483.32 to 578.54 ns, which provides further evidence for the improvement of the quality of perovskite films.

(f) The TPV curves for control and Pero-SCs prepared with NEG. 
Next, the performance improvement of the Pero-SCs was investigated based on charge extraction and transportation. First, the light intensity-dependent VOC was measured under short-circuit conditions, as shown in Fig. 6c. The ideal factor (n) can be determined by eqn (1):49 (1)where q is a meta-charge, n is the ideal factor to represent the carrier recombination rate, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and P is light intensity. An ideal diode has an n = 1, and practically, an n close to 1 means that the mono-molecular recombination is negligible.50 Herein, the n calculated based on the fitting curves of the voltage response of the control device was 1.67, and for the Pero-SC prepared by NEG, n was reduced to 1.42. It is clear that the trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall recombination process was effectively suppressed for the Pero-SC fabricated by NEG.
Alternating current impedance spectroscopy (ACIS) measurements were performed to further explain the carrier transport and recombination kinetics of Pero-SCs.51 The Nyquist plots of the devices are shown in Fig. 6d, the parameters of which are shown in Table S5 in the ESI,† where Rs represents the resistance of the electrodes, and the high- and low-frequency arcs correspond to the charge-transport resistance (Rtr) and recombination resistance (Rrec), respectively. For the Pero-SCs prepared with NEG, Rtr decreased from 67.0 Ω to 59.4 Ω, and Rrec increased from 1.6 Ω to 7.6 Ω. These results indicated that the charge transfer of the Pero-SCs prepared with NEG was greatly improved and the carrier recombination was effectively suppressed. The trap density in the perovskite films was quantitatively assessed by the space limited-charge current (SCLC) of electron-only devices (ITO/SnO2/perovskite/C60/BCP/Ag) and hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/MoO3/Ag) (Fig. 6e and S10 in the ESI†). The linear relation indicated an ohmic response of the device in the region of low bias voltage, while the current increased quickly as the voltage increased and exceeded the kink point, where the trap states were fully filled. The inflection point at which the voltage is known is the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL), from which the defect density (nt) can be calculated by eqn (2):52 (2)where ε is the relative dielectric constant of perovskite, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, e is the monolithic charge, and L is the thickness of the perovskite film. For the electron-only devices of the control and Pero-SCs prepared with NEG, the trap densities were 1.55 × 1016 cm−3 (VTFL = 0.22 V) and 1.27 × 1016 cm−3 (VTFL = 0.18 V), respectively. The nt of the hole-only devices was 2.54 × 1016 cm−3 (VTFL = 0.36 V) and 1.77 × 1016 cm−3 (VTFL = 0.25 V) for the control and the Pero-SCs prepared with NEG, respectively. These data clearly indicate that the nt was markedly reduced by the NEG method.53 The dark J–V curve (Fig. S11 in ESI†) showed a lower dark current density and reduced leakage in Pero-SC with the NEG method, which transversely confirmed that defects in the perovskite films were decreased.54 The charge-carrier recombination dynamics were further assessed by the transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC). The data were fitted using a single exponential decay model to extract the charge-recombination lifetime (τRS) and charge-transport lifetime (τT). The photovoltage decay of the Pero-SCs prepared with NEG increased from 1.89 to 6.75 μs, as shown in Fig. 6f, which indicated less charge recombination and better carrier transport in Pero-SCs with NEG.55 The photocurrent decay results (Fig. S12 in ESI†) also supported the above conclusion. The charge-transfer lifetimes (τT) of the control and devices prepared with NEG were 1.88 and 0.76 μs, respectively. In contrast, the quicker photocurrent decay of Pero-SCs prepared with NEG indicated the improved charge transfer due to the high crystallinity and low defect density.
Finally, the stability of the Pero-SCs was investigated by recording the PCE decay with time. As shown in Fig. 7a, the unencapsulated devices were stored in a glovebox filled with N2 for 3200 h, and the Pero-SC prepared with NEG maintained over 90% of the initial PCE, while the control retained only 76% of the initial PCE under the same conditions. The stability of the devices under ambient conditions (25 °C with RH = 20%) was also tested (Fig. S13 in ESI†). The PCE of the Pero-SCs prepared with NEG decayed much slower than that of the control, further confirming the improved stability of the devices with NEG. To clarify the reason for the improved stability of the Pero-SCs, the perovskite films were kept in air with an RH of approximately 40% for 24 h, and the XRD pattern was recorded. As shown in Fig. 7b, the diffraction peak intensity of the perovskite film fabricated by NEG showed little change, and the color of the films remained black, indicating that perovskite decomposition was negligible. In contrast, the diffraction peak of PbI2 in the control increased after 24 h, the diffraction peak of α-FAPbI3 was weaker, and the film turned from dark brown to yellowish, indicating a serious degradation of the perovskite film. The thermal stability of the perovskite films was then measured at 85 °C in a glovebox filled with N2. The absorption intensity variation over time and the time-dependence curves of the absorbance were monitored at 778 nm for the control and perovskite film prepared with NEG, as shown in Fig. S14 in the ESI.† The absorption intensity dramatically decreased, while the perovskite film prepared with NEG displayed a slightly decreased absorption intensity over time, which proved that the film prepared with NEG showed better thermal stability. These results indicate that the performance improvement of the Pero-SCs should be mainly attributed to the quality improvement of the perovskite films induced by NEG.

Conclusions
In summary, δ-FAPbI3 was introduced into the perovskite precursor, by which the formalization of the α-phase perovskite was promoted due to nucleus epitaxial growth. The as-prepared perovskite films had uniform and densely packed crystal grains. When applied in Pero-SCs, the trap density was significantly reduced, and nonradiative recombination was suppressed. Consequently, the champion PCE of the devices was increased from 21.53% to 23.16%. The stability of the devices was greatly improved, and the Pero-SCs prepared with NEG maintained over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in a glovebox filled with N2 for 3200 h. As demonstrated by this study, using external crystal seeds to improve the quality of perovskite films may be developed into a new method for the quality control of perovskite films.

The ITO glass was ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and IPA for 30 min in sequence and then cleaned with ultraviolet ozone for 20 min before use. The SnO2 nanoparticles were mixed with water in a volume ratio of 1:6 and then sonicated for 30 min. Next, the solution was spin-coated onto an ITO substrate at a speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s in ambient air and then annealed in air for 30 min on a hot plate at 150 °C to obtain a SnO2 film with a thickness of approximately 15 nm. The deposition of the perovskite active layers was carried out in a two-step sequence. First, 1.5 mol per L PbI2 was dissolved in DMF/DMSO (9:1, v/v) and stirred on a 70 °C heat plate for 10 h. Under a N2 atmosphere, the warm PbI2 solution or the mixture of PbI2 and δ-FAPbI3 was spin-coated onto the SnO2 films at a speed of 2000 rpm for 20 s and then annealed at 65 °C for 1 min. After the substrate had cooled to room temperature, a mixture of FAI:MAI:MACl (90 mg:6.39 mg:9 mg) dissolved in 1 mL IPA was then dripped onto the rotating substrate for 30 s in a glovebox filled with N2. The as-prepared film was then annealed at 150 °C for 15 min under ambient air conditions for perovskite growth. Subsequently, the perovskite film was transferred to a N2 glovebox, and then the hole-transport material Spiro-OMeTAD was deposited on the upper perovskite layer at 3500 rpm for 30 s. Note that Spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 1 mL chlorobenzene (72.3 mg) mixed with 17.5 μL Li-TFSI (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 28.8 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP). Finally, MoO3 (8 nm) and Ag (100 nm) were sequentially evaporated onto the surface of the hole-transport layer under vacuum at a pressure of 1 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of the device was approximately 0.1 cm2. For the electron-only devices, C60 (20 nm) and BCP (8 nm) were sequentially evaporated onto perovskite films. For the hole-only devices, the PEDOT:PSS solution was spin-coated on the ITO surface at 5000 rpm for 40 s, followed by annealing at 150 °C for 10 min.
Characterization
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected on a D2 PHASER diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (Bruker, Germany). UV-vis spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 spectrometer produced by Agilent Technologies. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a MultiMode 8 microscope (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA). For photoluminescence (PL) mapping, a JMAT-S confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) (SouthPort Co., Ltd, Taiwan) was used, the excitation wavelength was 445 nm, and the confocal pinhole was set to a 50 μm size with a ×10 objective. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired on a Hitachi SU8010 SEM, and the distribution of the perovskite grain size was analyzed using Nano Measurer 1.2 software. The thicknesses of the perovskite films were determined with a spectroscopic ellipsometer (M-2000 V, J.A. Woollam Co., Lincoln, NE, USA). The J–V curves of the Pero-SCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 source meter (Keithley Instruments, USA) in a glovebox filled with N2. The measurements were conducted under AM 1.5 G solar illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2 at a scan speed of 10 mV s−1. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves were measured using a solar cell spectral response measurement system QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd, Taiwan) in air. The measurements of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra were conducted on an FLS 980 (Edinburgh Instrument, UK). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were acquired on a Lifespec II (Edinburgh Instrument, UK), and the transient PL spectra were collected by monitoring the signal at 780 nm excited with a 477 nm laser (2 MHz). The alternating current impedance spectroscopy measurement (ACIS) characterization measurements were measured on an IM6 electrochemical workstation (Zahner Zennium, Germany) in the dark with a bias under the respective VOC of the individual cells. The transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) spectra were obtained using a TPVC-1G system (SouthPort Co., Ltd, Taiwan).
