    , Accepted 17th December 2017First published on 21st December 2017AbstractTwo new donor–acceptor−donor molecules, featuring either 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) or 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole (BO) and capped by benzofuranyl-thienyl groups, are presented. The structures of these novel compounds differ only in the identity of one heteroatom in the acceptor unit. Replacement of the sulfur atom in BT with oxygen results in a marked improvement in the performance of PC61BM blends in bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (BHJ OPV) devices: a 10-fold increase in PCE is observed when switching to the BO analogue. This is partly due to a preferable morphology in the donor-fullerene blends formed upon spin-coating from chlorinated solvents.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaics (OPV) offer many advantages compared to their inorganic counterparts, such as being lightweight and flexible, as well as having the potential to be processed using low-cost roll-to-roll processes (instead of high temperature, energy intensive processes required for the fabrication of inorganic solar cells). In particular, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs, where a blend of an electron-rich donor and an electron-deficient acceptor is deposited, have attracted an enormous amount of interest due to their ease of processing and the large donor–acceptor interface area that results. Polymers and small molecules are used as donor materials for BHJ-OPVs and, whilst the use of polymers has some advantages, batch-to-batch variation is a common problem associated with polymers that can be solved by employing small molecules with well-defined, monodisperse structures. Furthermore, consideration must be paid to the scalability of the synthesis, as the costs and environmental effects of preparing donor materials are often neglected in the pursuit of high power conversion efficiencies. In this sense, Roncali and co-workers highlighted that simple, small donor molecules can be used effectively as donor materials and indeed should be considered as an effective route towards low-cost, clean production of solar energy materials.1
A common strategy in the design of OPV donor materials is to combine electron-deficient acceptors and electron-rich donors in one system to reduce the HOMO–LUMO gap. This has resulted in extensive research into the incorporation of a large number of different donor and acceptor moieties into materials used as donors in BHJ-OPVs.2 Amongst the most commonly employed acceptor units is 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT), which has been used in many different donor–acceptor polymers and small molecules for the fabrication of OPV devices.3–7 Many analogues of 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) have been synthesised in order to improve OPV performance, with several examples of effective alternatives including the addition of fluorine atoms (5-fluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or 5,6-difluoro-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole),8–10 or cyano groups (5-cyano-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or 5,6-cyano-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)11 and the incorporation of a nitrogen atom in [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-c]pyridine (PT).12,13 Such small differences in the acceptor unit structure have been shown to have a large impact on OPV performance and such differences in structure are often associated with substituent effects14,15 or conformational effects through non-covalent contacts.16 For instance, Heeger et al.12 reported the use of the small molecule DTS(PTTh2)2 (Fig. 1) as a donor material in bulk heterojunction OPVs, resulting in a PCE of 6.7%; a record at the time for bulk heterojunction OPVs containing small donor molecules. OPV devices containing the analogous compound where BT is used instead of the PT unit showed a PCE of just 0.2%, highlighting the huge influence of the nitrogen atoms in the PT unit.13 DFT calculations also showed that there was less variation in the net dipole moment of DTS(PTTh2)2 conformers with respect to its BT-containing analogues, explaining the improved aggregation of the pyridine containing compound.13

Whilst there has been successful improvement of donor materials by making small modifications to the benzene ring of BT, there has also been interest in studying analogues such as 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole,17,18 2,1,3-benzoselenadiazole19,20 and 2,1,3-benzotellurodiazole20 where the sulfur atom of BT is substituted for oxygen, selenium and tellurium, respectively. Indeed, Seferos et al.20 showed that there was a reduction of 0.13 eV in the optical band gap of analogous benzochalcogenodiazole-containing polymers when sulfur is replaced with selenium. The inclusion of tellurium, however, results in a significantly larger decrease in the polymer band gap of 0.40 eV with respect to the selenium-containing analogue. The unexpected observation that heavier atoms with reduced electronegativities can affect the polymer band gap was explained by the increased bond length of the heavier atoms contributing to decreased aromaticity, which in turn contributes to a destabilised HOMO and stabilised LUMO.20 Similarly, Cho et al.21 recently reported a series of polymers based on weakly electron-deficient dithienobenzochalcogenodiazole units where the sulfur analogue was used in the most efficient OPV devices (PCE = 6.0%) compared to oxygen (PCE = 1.4%) and selenium (PCE = 4.6%) analogues. This was attributed to the sulfur-containing unit inducing increased interchain packing, contributing to a better phase-separated morphology. However the use of these acceptor units in small donor molecules is limited compared with polymers.
In this paper we disclose the synthesis and characterisation of two novel D−A−D compounds that are synthesised using three synthetic steps, highlighting the potential scalability of the materials. The materials only differ by one atom – sulfur and oxygen in the BT and BO cores, respectively. Finally, we discuss the effect of substituting sulfur for oxygen in the coordination of solvent molecules and how this influences the nanomorphology of the corresponding films and the overall OPV performance.
Synthesis
The synthetic routes for the two novel donor–acceptor compounds are shown in Scheme 1. The first step of both pathways involves a Stille cross-coupling reaction of 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole or 4,7-dibromo-2,1,3-benzoxadiazole with 2-trimethylstannyl-4-dodecylthiophene. Compound 1 was synthesised according to a previous procedure,22 whilst compound 4 was formed in 58% yield. The resulting compounds were then brominated using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) to afford the di-brominated products in high yields, which were then in turn used in Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reactions with 2-benzofuranylboronic acid MIDA ester to form the analogous final products 3 and 6.

Electronic absorption spectroscopy and electrochemistry
The electronic absorption and electrochemical properties of the novel compounds were studied in order to determine the effect of changing the heteroatom in the acceptor unit. Fig. 2 shows the UV/Vis absorption spectra for BT-(TBF)2 and BO-(TBF)2 and the corresponding data are summarised in Table 1. The absorption profiles are very similar with the longest wavelength maximum of BO-(TBF)2 showing a small red shift of 6 nm in the low energy peak with respect to BT-(TBF)2. In the solid-state, a red shift relative to the solution-state measurements is observed for λmax; shifts of 17 nm and 21 nm for BT-(TBF)2 and BO-(TBF)2, respectively, were recorded. Crucially, both materials show broad absorption which is an important consideration for ensuring a high short-circuit current.

In contrast to the small variations in the electronic absorption features of the two new compounds, there is a more pronounced difference in their electrochemical properties (Table 1). The oxidation and reduction of both compounds, shown in Fig. S5, ESI,† are similar with both compounds exhibiting two reversible oxidation peaks and one quasi-reversible reduction. However, whilst the HOMO levels are similar, the LUMO of BO-(TBF)2 is 0.14 eV lower than BT-(TBF)2. This highlights a significant stabilisation effect when the more electronegative oxygen atom is substituted in place of the sulfur atom in benzothiadiazole. This shows a similar trend to previous benzoxadiazole and benzothiadiazole analogues reported by Li et al.,23 where the LUMO of a benzoxadiazole-containing donor–acceptor–donor compound was shown to have a LUMO that was 0.04 eV lower than the corresponding BT-containing analogue.
X-ray crystallography
The molecular structures and packing behaviour of BT-(TBF)2 and BO-(TBF)2 were investigated by X-ray crystallography. In both cases, red plate-shaped crystals were obtained by recrystallisation from chloroform and methanol. The crystal structures of the two materials are very similar with chloroform incorporated as a solvent of crystallisation. The latter influences the packing within the crystal, but the chloroform molecules occupy the aliphatic regions of the cell (see Fig. S6 and S7, ESI†). The occlusion of the solvent molecules does not affect diversely the intermolecular interactions between the conjugated units. Fig. 3(a) shows the asymmetric unit of BT-(TBF)2 and reveals that there is disorder in the position of the BT unit with 76:24% occupancy in each of the superimposed positions shown in the figure (for comparison the asymmetric unit of BO-(TBF)2 has 69:31% disorder in the position of the BO unit).

The side-on view of the molecule shows that there is a small twist between the BT unit and the adjacent thiophene rings (C6–C1–C7–C8 torsion angle = 159.452(2)°), whereas the benzofuran and thiophene units are far more coplanar (S1–C10–C11–C12 torsion angle = 175.5909(4)°). Fig. 3(b) shows how the conjugated units stack through π–π interactions. The molecules aggregate into dimers which are superimposed. These dimers then in turn overlap with neighbouring dimers in a staggered fashion, such that benzene rings of the BT heterocycles and benzofurans are superimposed. This is shown in Fig. 3(b), in which the planes of the corresponding benzene rings of BTs and benzofurans are colour-shaded. The interplanar distances between these benzene rings for BT-(TBF)2 and BO-(TBF)2 are in the range 3.3–3.55 Å. The π–π interactions extend infinitely in the a* direction of the unit cell and the general motif is represented as a cartoon in Fig. 3(c).
Organic field effect transistors and organic solar cells
The novel compounds were further studied to determine how effective they were in organic semiconductor devices. p-Type bottom-gate, bottom-contact organic field-effect transistor (OFET) and organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices using the novel compounds as donor materials were fabricated and the experimental details are described in the supplementary information section. For OFETs, the output and transfer graphs are shown in Fig. S8 and S9, ESI† for BT-(TBF)2 and BO-(TBF)2, respectively. The average hole mobility of BT-(TBF)2 was calculated to be 1.70 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (standard deviation = 8.5 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), with the mobility determined from devices containing BO-(TBF)2 being 1.91 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 (standard deviation = 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The crystal structures of both compounds show a similar arrangement of the dodecyl chains. It is therefore anticipated that the interaction of the dodecyl chains with the octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS)-modified surface will dictate the arrangement of molecules along the channel, which explains the similar field-effect mobility of the two compounds.
In contrast to the data from OFETs, there is a greater difference in material performance when the two compounds are applied as donor materials in BHJ OPV devices with PC61BM as the acceptor. The results are summarised in Table 2 with J–V graphs shown in Fig. S10, ESI.† Devices containing BT-(TBF)2 show low performance, despite a high open-circuit voltage, due to a poor short-circuit current which is only slightly improved upon annealing. The addition of DIO was detrimental to device performance when BT-(TBF)2 was used as the donor. The more electron-deficient nature of benzoxadiazole with respect to benzothiadiazole contributes to further improvement of the open-circuit voltage up to 1.00 V, since the HOMO of the oxygen analogue is 0.04 eV deeper than that of the benzothiadiazole derivative and the VOC is related to the difference between the HOMO of the donor molecule and the LUMO of the acceptor in BHJ OPV devices. The short-circuit current is also improved significantly for BO-(TBF)2-based devices with the addition of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), resulting in an average JSC of 5.46 mA cm−2 and an overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.6%.

As stated above, the more stabilised HOMO of BO-(TBF)2 with respect to BT-(TBF)2 contributes to the improved open-circuit voltage but the origin of the large improvement of the short-circuit current is not as obvious, since both the p-type field-effect mobility and absorption spectra are similar across both molecules. Therefore, the morphology of the OPV devices was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Surface images are shown in Fig. 4.

Images of the surfaces of OPVs containing BT-(TBF)2 show large, long domains suggesting limitations on the surface area between donor and acceptor. In order to maximise the surface area between donor and acceptor and subsequently improve the short-circuit current, long, narrow domains are desirable. 1,8-Diiodooctane has been shown to promote this type of morphology,24,25 but the additive has little effect on the BT-(TBF)2-containing active layer. The surface of the active layer containing BO-(TBF)2 shows smaller domains that increase upon annealing, which is detrimental to the short-circuit current. However the addition of DIO contributes to the formation of narrow, long, fibre-like structures in the active layer, suggesting improved surface area between donor and acceptor, leading to the highest recorded short-circuit current of 5.46 mA cm−2.
Conclusions
Two novel donor–acceptor compounds have been synthesised containing the analogous acceptors, 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole and 2,1,3-benzoxadiazole. The increased electron-deficient nature of benzoxadiazole results in a narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap and reduction in both the HOMO and LUMO energies. This in turn leads to improved performance when BO-(TBF)2 is applied as a donor material in OPV devices with respect to BT-(TBF)2; however, the improved morphology of the BO-(TBF)2/PC61BM blend has the most significant contribution to enhancing the PCE. The reason for the difference in morphologies between the two blends of donor–fullerene is intriguing, given the minor difference in molecular composition of the donors and their closely related crystal structures. A possible explanation concerns the occluded chloroform molecules observed in the crystal structures of BO-(TBF)2 and BT-(TBF)2. Due to the disorder in both structures it is difficult to accurately determine which are truly close contacts. In both structures there are close interactions between the chalcogens of the N-heterocycle and the chlorine atoms of the solvent. However, for both compounds the closest contacts occur between atoms each with less than 50% occupancy and so the chance of these contacts truly existing is slim (the shortest O⋯Cl distance in BO-(TBF)2 is 3.0145(1) Å (the sum of the van der Waals’ radii for oxygen and chlorine is 3.27 Å), whereas in BT-(TBF)2 the shortest S⋯Cl distance is 2.9428(2) Å (the sum of the van der Waals’ radii for sulfur and chlorine is 3.55 Å)). Only BT-(TBF)2 has another close interaction with the solvent molecule, in which the S⋯Cl distance is 3.2231(3) Å. There is therefore much stronger binding between the donor molecule and chloroform in the case of the sulfur analogue and one can assume that for BT-(TBF)2 it will be much more difficult to remove the solvent molecule upon drying and annealing of spin-cast films of the blends. This retention of the solvent could well be the reason for the significant difference in the morphologies of the donor–acceptor blends and points towards the preferred use of benzoxadiazole derivatives when processed from chlorinated solvents.
