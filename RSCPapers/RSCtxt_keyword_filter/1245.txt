    , Accepted 26th March 2018First published on 28th March 2018AbstractHere we report a strong addition effect of n-type conjugated polymer, which has a middle energy level between electron-donating polymers and electron-accepting fullerenes, on the enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted-type organic solar cells with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layers of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). As a mid-energy level additive, poly(3-hexylthiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) end-capped with hexylthiophene (THBT-ht) was employed by varying its content up to 3 wt%. Results showed that the PCE of inverted-type PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cells was enhanced from 8.77% to 9.81% (max: 10.02%) by adding only 0.5 wt% (1.47 mol%) THBT-ht. The pronounced improvement at 0.5 wt% has been assigned to the balanced charge transport and the drastic change of nanoscale morphology toward finer phase segregation and less hydrophobic smoother surface. The present finding is expected to contribute to further efficiency improvement of BHJ-based organic solar cells with various types of material systems.
Introduction
Organic solar cells with bulk heterojunction (BHJ) films of conjugated polymers and fullerenes have been extensively studied because they are more attractive for low cost and flexible clean energy applications.1–12 Polymer:fullerene solar cells can deliver high power conversion efficiency (PCE) because the excitons generated in the polymer domains can be efficiently separated into holes and electrons by the fullerene molecules. The efficient charge separation in the polymer: fullerene BHJ films is basically attributed to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of fullerenes, which is typically higher than that of light-absorbing polymers with electron-donating functions.13–16 Although polymer:fullerene solar cells exhibited an encouraging PCE exceeding 10%, their stability (lifetime) is still poor owing to various issues including UV-induced deterioration of polymers and morphological instability in the BHJ layers.17–23
In order to further improve the performance and stability of polymer:fullerene solar cells, the polymer:fullerene BHJ films have been modified by adding a third component such as small molecules, polymers, fullerene derivatives, inorganic nano-particles including quantum dots, etc.24–31 The third components can be divided into two types, additive type (<10 wt%) and light-absorbing type (>10 wt%), according to their compositions in the resulting films. The additive type third components have been typically used for the control of phase-segregated morphology, while the light-absorbing type third components have been employed to further harvest photocurrent by enhancing the optical absorption characteristics.26,27,31
Of various additive type third components, most of the polymer additives possessed electron-donating characteristics, such as poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7) and polystyrene-block-poly(3-hexylthiophene) (PS-b-P3HT), with similar LUMO energy levels close to the main electron-donating polymers in the polymer:fullerene BHJ films.32–35 In contrast, a relatively limited number of electron-accepting polymers including poly[(N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl)-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)] (P(NDI2OD-T2)) was tried as an additive type third component for polymer:fullerene solar cells. In particular, less attention has been paid to the conjugated polymer additives with a middle position of energy levels, between main electron-donating polymers and electron-accepting fullerenes, which can deliver effective cascade charge transfer processes leading to the improved charge collection efficiency.36–38 Furthermore, only very few studies have been reported for the inverted-type polymer:fullerene solar cells with the mid-energy level conjugated polymer additives (see Table S1†).34,37
In this work, we have attempted to apply poly(3-hexylthiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) end-capped with hexylthiophene (THBT-ht) as a mid-energy level additive for polymer:fullerene solar cells, which contain the BHJ layers of poly[4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-co-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate] (PTB7-Th) and [6,6]-phenylC71butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), because the LUMO energy level of THBT-ht (3.9 eV) exists almost in the middle position between the LUMO levels of PTB7-Th (3.6 eV) and PC71BM (4.2 eV).39–41 Results showed that the PCE of inverted-type PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cells was improved from 8.77% to 9.81% (max: 10.02%) when a small amount of THBT-ht (only 0.5 wt%, 1.47 mol% refer to PTB7-Th) was introduced as a mid-energy level additive. The improved performance at 0.5 wt% could be explained by the balanced charge transport as well as the pronounced change in the BHJ morphology, as evidenced by the measurement results with atomic force microscopy (AFM), ultra-high voltage transmission electron microscopy (UHV-TEM), and synchrotron radiation grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).
Experimental
Materials and solutions
The THBT-ht polymer (weight-average molecular weight = 10 kDa, polydispersity index = 1.8) was synthesized according to our previous report.42 The PTB7-Th polymer (weight-average molecular weight = 126 kDa, polydispersity index = 2.5) and PC71BM (purity > 99%) were purchased from 1-Material (Canada) and Nano-C (United States), respectively. Zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O) was used as received from Sigma-Aldrich (United States). All other reagents, including solvents, were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (United States) and TCI (Japan) and used without further purification. First, the pristine solution of THBT-ht was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) at a solid concentration of 1.25 mg ml−1. Binary solutions of PTB7-Th and PC71M (PTB7-Th:PC71M = 1:1.5 by weight) were prepared using a mixture of CB and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (CB:DIO = 97:3 by volume) at a solid concentration of 22.5 mg ml−1. Next, the pristine solution of THBT-ht was added to the binary solutions by varying the weight fraction of THBT-ht (0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 3.0 wt% based on the total weight of the PTB7-Th polymer). These solutions were vigorously stirred at room temperature for 12 h prior to spin coating. The ZnO precursor solutions (0.5 M) were prepared by dissolving both zinc acetate dihydrate and ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) in 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH). These precursor solutions were subject to stirring on a hot plate at 60 °C for 4 h and at room temperature for 12 h.
Film and device fabrication
Photolithography and etching processes were applied to pattern indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates, which are used for the electron-collecting electrodes in the inverted-type solar cells. The patterned ITO-glass substrates were cleaned using acetone and isopropyl alcohol by employing sequential sonication steps for 15 min, followed by drying with a nitrogen gas flow and treating with a UV-ozone (Ahtech LTS, 50 mW cm−2) for 20 min. Successively, the ZnO precursor layers were deposited on the UV-ozone-treated ITO-glass substrates by spin-coating at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed by thermal annealing at 200 °C for 1 h in air ambient/dark condition. After transferring these samples to an argon-filled glovebox, the BHJ (PTB7-Th:THBT-ht:PC71BM) layers were spin-coated on the ZnO layers at 1200 rpm for 45 s and dried at room temperature. The thickness of the BHJ layers was 80 nm. These BHJ layer-coated samples were moved to a vacuum chamber equipped inside an argon-filled another glovebox. When the vacuum level of chamber reached ∼1.0 × 10−6 Torr, molybdenum oxide (MoO3, 10 nm) and silver (Ag, 80 nm) were sequentially evaporated to the BHJ layer-coated samples through a shadow mask. The size of active area in the devices was 5.5 mm2. To fabricate hole-only devices (HODs), the 50 nm-thick poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layers were spin-coated on the ITO-glass substrates and thermally annealed at 230 °C for 15 min, followed by spin-coating of the BHJ layers and sequential thermal deposition of MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (80 nm). Electron-only devices (EODs) were fabricated by depositing the lithium fluoride (LiF, ∼1 nm) and aluminum (Al, 95 nm) layers on the BHJ layers that were coated on the ZnO/ITO/glass samples. The final structure of HODs and EODs was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/BHJ/LiF/Al, respectively. Samples for the surface morphology and nanostructure measurements were prepared in the same manner as for the device fabrication, whereas the film samples for optical measurement were prepared using quartz substrates. The devices and film samples were stored inside the same argon-filled glovebox in the dark before measurement.
Measurements
Optical absorption spectra of solutions and films were measured using a UV-visible-NIR spectrophotometer (Lambda 750, Perkin Elmer), while their photoluminescence spectra were measured using a PL spectrometer (FS-2, Scinco). The film thickness was measured using a surface profilometer (Alpha Step 200, KLA-Tencor). The crystal nanostructure of films was measured using a synchrotron radiation grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) system built in Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (3C beamline). The wavelength and incidence angle of the synchrotron X-rays were 1.278 Å and 0.12°, respectively. An atomic force microscope (AFM, Nanoscope IVa, Digital Instruments) was employed to measure the surface nanomorphology of films. An ultra-high voltage transmission electron microscope (UHV-TEM, JEM-ARAM 1300S, JEOL), which is operated at 1250 kV, was employed to measure the crystalline morphology of film samples. The specimens for TEM measurements were prepared by placing the sample films on a TEM grid (Formvar, 300 mesh). The performance of solar cells was measured using a solar simulator (92250A-1000, Newport-Oriel). The incident light intensity of simulated solar light (air mass 1.5 Global – AM 1.5G) was adjusted to be 1 sun (100 mW cm−2) by employing a Si-based calibrated reference cell (BS-520, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd.). The current-density (J–V) curves of devices were measured using an electrometer (Model 2400, Keithley). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of devices were measured using a specialized EQE measurement system equipped with a monochromator (CM110, Spectral Products) and a Tungsten-Halogen lamp (ASBN-W, Spectral Products). The charge carrier (hole and electron) mobilities were determined by fitting the dark J–V curves of HODs and EODs using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model.43,44
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, the BHJ (PTB7-Th:THBT-ht:PC71BM) layers were sandwiched between the electron-collecting (ZnO) and hole-collecting (MoO3) buffer layers in the present inverted-type solar cells. Considering the best case for charge transport without any charge blocking resistance, the flat energy band diagram could be built as appeared in Fig. 1b. Here, as proposed in Fig. 1c, the THBT-ht component is expected to act as a mid-energy level additive in the cascade charge transport process because the LUMO energy level of THBT-ht is almost exactly located in the middle position of those between PTB7-Th and PC71BM.39–41 The charge separation capability of the THBT-ht component can be supported from the pronounced PL quenching in the PTB7-Th:THBT-ht blend films because the PL intensity was significantly reduced even by the presence of very small amount of THBT-ht (see Fig. S1†). Taking into account the optical absorption and PL spectra in Fig. 1d (see corresponding optical density spectra in Fig. S2†), the THBT-ht component seems to compensate the low optical density of the main light-absorbing component (PTB7-Th) or to increase the optical absorption by the Förster energy transfer to the PTB7-Th component.45,46 However, as shown in Fig. 1e, the resulting optical absorption spectra of the blend films were not significantly changed owing to the low THBT-ht contents (≤3 wt%).

The light J–V curves of solar cells are compared according to the content of THBT-ht in Fig. 2a. When very small amount of THBT-ht (0.25 wt%) was added, the light J–V curve was noticeably shifted leading to the increased short circuit current density (JSC). Further increasing the THBT-ht content up to 0.5 wt% resulted in more improvement in the shape of J–V curve. However, the J–V curve began to turn back by increasing the THBT-ht content (≥1.0 wt%) and became slightly poorer than that without the THBT-ht component (0 wt%). The trend of JSC in the J–V curves can be supported by the EQE spectra in Fig. 2b, delivering the slightly different EQE spectral shape between the devices with and without the THBT-ht component. Here it is noted that the current density values calculated from the EQE spectra matched well with the JSC values from the J–V curves (see the inset table in Fig. 2b).

(b) EQE spectra for the inverted-type PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cells with the THBT-ht additive: inset table compares the JSC values measured from (a) with those calculated from the EQE spectra. 
The detailed trend of solar cell parameters for more than 20 devices was analyzed and compared in Fig. 3a and Table 1. JSC gradually increased as the THBT-ht content increased up to 0.5 wt%, but its trend turned down clearly by further increasing the THBT-ht content. The open circuit voltage (VOC) was slightly increased by adding small amount of THBT-ht (0.25 and 0.5 wt%) but exhibited relatively a huge drop at the higher THBT-ht content (≥1.0 wt%). Interestingly, irrespective of the THBT-ht content, the fill factor (FF) was higher for the devices with the THBT-ht component than those without the THBT-ht component. Consequently, the highest PCE (10.02%) was achieved at the THBT-ht content of 0.5 wt%. As displayed in Fig. 3b, the efficacy (RE) of the improved PCE (average) per the THBT-ht content clearly supports the strong effect of THBT-ht as an additive on the PCE enhancement. In addition, as shown in Fig. 3c (see also Fig. S3†), the highest charge mobility ratio, which is approaching 1.0, was measured at 0.5 wt% (THBT-ht). This result reflects that the charges (holes and electrons) in the present devices can be well balanced at 0.5 wt%, which could improve the extraction of photo-generated charges through minimizing the charge recombination loss, leading to eventually enhanced power conversion efficiency by the addition of 0.5 wt% THBT-ht (see Table 2).47

In order to understand the strong influence of the THBT-ht addition, the surface morphology of the BHJ (PTB7-Th:THBT-ht:PC71BM) layers was investigated using AFM. As shown in the phase-mode AFM images (see Fig. 4), the surface phase in the BHJ layers was gradually changed to a soft state (sky blue color) as the THBT-ht content increased up to 0.5 wt%. However, the soft state became less pronounced by further increasing the THBT-ht content. This trend can be supported by the surface roughness that showed the lowest value at the THBT-ht content of 0.5 wt% even though just a random morphology without particular patterns was measured from the height-mode AFM images (see Fig. 4 and S4†). The contact angle measurement disclosed that the surface of the BHJ layers changed to relatively less hydrophobic at the THBT-ht content of 0.5 wt%, which might help better contact with the hole-collecting buffer layer (MoO3) leading to the improved PCE.
 Fig. 4  2D phase-mode AFM images (top right: 3D height-mode images) for the BHJ (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) layers with the THBT-ht additive. Note that the BHJ layers were coated on the ZnO/ITO-glass substrates. The root-mean-square roughness (Rg) is given on the top part of the height-mode images. The phase degree (Z) is shown on the bottom left part of the phase-mode images. The bottom images show the contact angle formed by a water drop on the BHJ layers. 
As shown in Fig. 5, the TEM imaging revealed the bulk morphology of BHJ films (layers) was greatly changed according to the THBT-ht content. The binary BHJ layers (0 wt%) showed a phase segregation on a scale of several hundred nanometers, in which the bright and dark parts can be confirmed as the PTB7-Th-rich and PC71BM-rich regions, respectively, when it comes to the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns on the left part of Figure 5.48,49 Interestingly, the BHJ morphology became very fine by adding only 0.5 wt% THBT-ht. The SAED pattern for the PC71BM-rich region was also noticeably changed by the small presence of THBT-ht (0.5 wt%) and clearer concentric (symmetric) diffraction spots were measured (see ‘D’ image in Fig. 5b). This result implies that the molecular alignment in the PC71BM domains was improved by the small addition of THBT-ht. However, as shown in Fig. 5c, adding more THBT-ht (3.0 wt%) led to another type of phase-segregated morphology (see Fig. S5† for the TEM images focusing on the different part of the BHJ films). The SAED patterns for both PTB7-Th-rich and PC71BM-rich regions were also further changed, but the concentric diffraction spots for the PC71BM-rich region was quite well kept leading to the maintenance of good crystallinity even though the domain size became bigger. This result reflects that the small amount of THBT-ht (0.5–3.0 wt%) can give a huge influence on the morphology of the BHJ films, which supports the pronounced change in the performance of solar cells discussed in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 5  TEM images for the BHJ (PTB7-Th:PC71BM) films with the THBT-ht additive. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns (right) were measured by focusing on the bright (B) and dark (D) parts in the BHJ films. 
To further investigate the evolution of morphology by the presence of small amount of THBT-ht, GIWAXS measurements were carried out for the BHJ layers coated on the ZnO buffer layers. The 2D GIWAXS images revealed that the (100) diffraction by the PTB7-Th component was still maintained with relatively narrower shape in the BHJ layers (see Fig. 6a). This is also supported by the 1D profiles because no particular change in the diffraction peaks could be observed for the BHJ layers with respect to the THBT-ht content (see Fig. 6b). However, the size of lamellae (L) in the PTB7-Th phase was gradually decreased as the THBT-ht content increased up to 0.5 wt% and then levelled off leading to saturation at higher contents (see Fig. 6c top panel), which is in good agreement with the TEM result that exhibited relatively finer morphology (smaller crystal domains) by the addition of THBT-ht. However, the d-spacing of the PTB7-Th domains showed a slightly increasing trend with the THBT-ht content (see Fig. 6c bottom panel). Taking into account the trend of both lamellar size and d-spacing, it is evident that the small amount of THBT-ht had a significant influence on the crystalline morphology in the BHJ layers. In particular, the GIWAXS result disclosed that the small lamellar size is advantageous for high efficiency when it comes to the best PCE at 0.5 wt%, as closely correlated with the fine morphology confirmed by the TEM measurement.

Finally, the best devices with the THBT-ht additive (0.5 wt%) were used to turn on inorganic light-emitting diodes (LEDs) by making semi-solar modules via serial connection of four individual solar cells. As shown in Fig. 7a, the blue LED was turned on and operated by the present semi-solar modules under 1 sun condition (see Fig. S6† for other LED cases and continuous operation for 10 h). However, the J–V curve was subjected to degradation with time even though sufficient current and voltage could be still generated after 10 h (Fig. 7b). As summarized in Fig. 7c, the JSC decrease was relatively significant but both VOC and FF were well kept during continuous power supply for LEDs for 10 h. This brief test proves that the present inverted-type organic solar cells with the THBT-ht additive can be practically used for the operation of LEDs though a long-term stability remains to overcome.

Conclusions
The THBT-ht polymer was used as a mid-energy level additive for inverted-type PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cells. The PCE of devices was improved from 8.77% to 9.81% (max: 10.02%) by adding very small amount of THBT-ht (only 0.5 wt%, 1.47 mol%). However, further increasing the THBT-ht content turned the PCE back to almost original value without the THBT-ht additive. The improved PCE at 0.5 wt% THBT-ht could be explained by the balanced charge transport between holes and electrons in the devices. The surface morphology investigation disclosed that the surface of the BHJ layers changed to less hydrophobic with a reduced roughness by adding 0.5 wt% THBT-ht, while the scale of phase segregation became very small at this composition. The GIWAXS measurement revealed that the lamellar size of the PTB7-Th domains was decreased at 0.5 wt%, even though the d-spacing was marginally increased. Both balanced charge transport and dramatic morphology change results support that the PCE improvement could be achieved by the formation of optimum nanoscale morphology in which the small amount of THBT-ht added might play a cascade energy transfer role at the donor–acceptor interfaces and/or boundaries in the BHJ layers. The semi-solar modules made by serial connection of four individual devices with 0.5 wt% THBT-ht could stably operate LEDs for 10 h. Hence the present results prove the remarkable influence of adding very small amount of THBT-ht on the improved device efficiency, which is expected to be effectively applied for other types of material systems in organic solar cells.
