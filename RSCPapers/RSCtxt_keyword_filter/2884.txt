    , Accepted 8th August 2016First published on 9th August 2016AbstractRecently, conjugated terpolymers comprising three components have attracted tremendous attention. However, quite a few examples of high-performance terpolymers have been reported. We present here two novel terpolymers named PtDDA and PtDAA, in which bithiophene (BT) and benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (T1) were chosen as the donor and acceptor units, respectively. Thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz) were used as the third component. It is interesting to find that the PtDDA terpolymer shows a typical D1–D2–D1–A1 structure while PtDAA shows a D1–A1–D1–A2 structure. Without using additives or post-annealing processes, PtDAA-based solar cells show a high PCE of 8.1%, with an unprecedented fill factor (FF) of 0.74, which is much higher than those of PtDDA-based devices (PCE = 3.4%, FF = 0.55). The high efficiency of 8.1% is one of the highest values reported so far for organic solar cells based on conjugated terpolymers. The high performance is mainly ascribed to the efficient carrier transport in the PtDAA:PC71BM active layer, high crystallinity of PtDAA, and high domain purity. The results suggest that constructing conjugated terpolymers with one donor and two acceptor units is an effective strategy for designing high-performance solar cell materials.
1 Introduction
Solution-processed polymer solar cells (PSCs) have been developed rapidly over the last two decades due to their advantages of light weight, low cost, flexibility and processability for mass production.1–6 Nowadays, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 11% have been reported for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, revealing a bright future for their commercialization.7,8 The dramatic increase in PCE is mainly ascribed to the development of high-performance conjugated polymers.9–12 The copolymerization of electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) units has been widely used to construct new donor polymers.13–21 The properties of copolymers, such as light absorption ability, energy levels and charge carrier mobility, can be effectively tuned by using different D and A monomers.22–27
Recently, terpolymers comprising three different units in the polymeric backbones have intrigued much attention since they can show synergetic effects through incorporating a third component (D or A) into D–A copolymers to form D–A–A or D–D–A type terpolymers,28–31 rendering broad absorption, deep energy levels, high mobility, good solubility and miscibility.32–37 Wang and co-workers have recently reported a series of alternating terpolymers featuring a D–A–A type molecular structure with quinoxaline and isoindigo as electron-withdrawing units.38–40 These terpolymers showed a broader absorption range compared to their corresponding D–A1 and D–A2 parent copolymers. The extended light absorption resulted in more excitons generated which mainly contribute to high photocurrent, leading to a PCE of 7.0%.40 In another case, Janssen and co-workers have reported a PDPP3TaltTPT terpolymer (D–D–A type) composed of terthiophene (D1 = 3T) and thiophene–phenylene–thiophene (D2 = TPT) donor units and a diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor unit, which exhibits refined energy levels and optical bandgaps compared with its parent copolymers and subsequently a higher PCE of 8.0% was achieved.41 Moreover, the crystallinity of copolymers can be fine-tuned through optimizing the monomers' ratios in random terpolymers with enhanced performance in PSCs.42 Therefore, the terpolymer structure provides promising opportunities for finely tailoring polymers with popular optical-electronic properties through selection of the appropriate third component. However, very limited examples of high-performance terpolymers have been reported.
In this paper, we present two novel terpolymers named PtDDA and PtDAA, in which bithiophene (BT) and 5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H,8H-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (T1) were chosen as the donor and acceptor units, respectively. To ensure the coplanarity of terpolymers, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) and thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole (TTz) as a third component were introduced into the polymer backbone. The molecular structures of PtDDA and PtDAA are shown in Scheme 1. When incorporating the electron-rich TT unit, the PtDDA terpolymer shows a typical D1–D2–D1–A1 structure with two electron-rich building blocks and one electron-deficient building block. However, PtDAA shows a D1–A1–D1–A2 structure where the TTz fused unit acts as an electron-deficient building block because of the electron-withdrawing properties of unsaturated nitrogen atoms. The opto-electronic properties of two terpolymers were systematically investigated. Compared to PtDDA, PTDAA exhibits predominant advantages, such as a broader absorption range, deeper HOMO level, higher hole transport mobility and favorable face-on orientation in BHJ films, which are beneficial to obtain excellent photovoltaic performance. As a result, a promising PCE of 8.1% has been achieved for PtDAA-based PSCs without using any additives or post-solvent/thermal annealing processes, which is much higher than that of their analog PtDDA-based devices (PCE = 3.4%). Our results indicate that the PtDAA terpolymer is a promising material for high-performance organic solar cells. Moreover, it is found that the subtle changes in the polymeric backbone (e.g. the replacement of the carbon atom with a nitrogen atom) can dramatically influence the photovoltaic performance of the terpolymers.

2 Experimental
The patterned ITO/glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned successively in soapy water, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. The cleaned ITO glasses were dried overnight in a vacuum oven at 110 °C and treated with UV-ozone for 20 min before use. PEDOT:PSS was spin-cast onto the ITO glass at 4000 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 145 °C for 10 min in air. Then, PEDOT:PSS coated ITO/glass substrates were transferred into a glove box with a nitrogen atmosphere. The mixture of PtDDA (or PtDAA):fullerene with different DIO contents (v/v) and D:A weight ratios was dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) with a total concentration of 30 mg mL−1 and stirred at 90 °C overnight. The blends were spin-cast onto PEDOT:PSS at 1600 rpm for 40 s to form the BHJ layers. Finally, Al (100 nm)/Ca (10 nm) layers were sequentially evaporated through a shadow mask. Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit. Photovoltaic performance was measured using an Air Mass 1.5 Global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (Class AAA solar simulator, Model 94063A, Oriel) with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2, which was measured by a calibrated silicon solar cell and a readout meter (Model 91150V, Newport). IPCE spectra were measured by using a QEX10 Solar Cell IPCE measurement system (PV measurements, Inc.).
OFETs were fabricated in a bottom-gate/bottom-contact configuration in which a heavily n+-doped Si layer acted as the gate electrode and silicon oxide (SiO2) was used as the dielectric layer. Gold source/drain electrodes with titanium as the adhesion layer were evaporated onto the SiO2 layer. PtDDA and PtDAA were spin-coated onto OTS-treated SiO2/Si substrates from chloroform solutions (2.5 mg mL−1) at a spin-coating rate of 2500 rpm. The films were annealed at 160 °C for 5 min to get high mobility. The OFET performance was measured by using a Keithley 4200 semiconductor characterization system. The channel length (L) and width (W) are 20 μm and 1400 μm, respectively.
UV-vis absorption measurements were carried out on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3600). Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a NanoMan VS microscope in a tapping mode.
Hole-only devices were fabricated with a diode configuration of ITO/MoOx/(PtDDA or PtDAA)/MoOx/Al. The applied voltage is in the range of 0–6 V and the mobility was calculated by fitting the curves according to the equation: J = 9ε0εrμhV2/8L3, where J is the current density, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the transport medium, μh is the hole mobility, V is the applied voltage, and L is the film thickness.
The GIWAXS measurements were acquired at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source.43 Samples were prepared on a Si substrate, and a 10 keV X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of 0.11–0.15°, which maximized the scattering intensity from the samples. The data were analyzed by using the Nika software package. The RSoXS transmission measurements were acquired at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source.44 Samples for RSoXS measurements were prepared on a PSS modified Si substrate under the same conditions as those used for device fabrication, and then transferred by floating in water to a 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm, 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane supported by a 5 mm × 5 mm, 200 μm thick Si frame. The beam size at the sample is approximately 100 μm by 200 μm. Integrated scattering intensity profiles represent total scattered intensity at a given q. This was accomplished by averaging the data along the azimuth captured with a CCD and subsequently scaling the profiles by q2. Scattering from the sample was captured with the CCD as far from the sample as possible (∼150 mm) and with the CCD as close as possible (∼50 mm). The profiles acquired from the two datasets were stitched together for an extended q-range.
3 Results and discussion
The synthetic routes to PtDDA and PtDAA are illustrated in Scheme 2. PtDDA and PtDAA were synthesized through the typical Stille-coupling polymerization in toluene, with Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst. To better understand the electronic distribution and backbone conformation of these two terpolymers, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory were performed. As shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is delocalized along the entire polymer chain for both PtDDA and PtDAA. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) surface is more localized on the T1 and TTz. The computational results confirm the electron-withdrawing properties of T1 and TTz. Meanwhile, the optimized molecular geometry of PtDAA trimers at the lowest energy exhibits a better planar structure than that of PtDDA (Fig. S3†). In addition, the electrostatic potential (ESP) maps of PtDDA and PtDAA are partly different (Fig. S4†), which is caused by the different electronegativities of carbon and nitrogen atoms between fused-rings TT and TTz, respectively.
 Scheme 2  Synthetic routes to PtDDA and PtDAA. 
The UV-vis absorption spectra of PtDDA and PtDAA are shown in Fig. 1. The main absorption peak of PtDDA is located at 510 nm in a diluted chloroform solution and a pronounced red-shifted absorption by 77 nm to 587 nm appears in the solid state (Fig. 1a). Meanwhile, the shoulder peak in the PtDAA thin film located at ca. 650 nm implies a weak aggregation in the PtDAA thin film. By contrast, the absorption spectra of PtDAA in solution and thin films have similar profiles and the maximum absorption peaks are almost overlapped (∼590 nm). Enhanced shoulder peak intensity was seen for the PtDAA thin film compared to its solution, which originates from the further strengthened intermolecular π–π aggregations. The results indicate that PtDAA has stronger aggregated configurations than PtDDA even in a diluted solution. Thus it is primarily concluded that, as the third component is inserted into the D–A copolymer to form the terpolymer, the electronic-deficient TTz unit can induce stronger aggregation than the TT unit. The maximum absorption coefficient of PtDAA (ε = 5.8 × 104 cm−1) is larger than that of PtDDA (4.9 × 104 cm−1), indicating its better light-harvesting capability. The optical band gap values are calculated to be similar which are 1.79 and 1.78 eV for PtDDA and PtDAA, respectively, from the onset of absorption spectra in the solid state.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed to characterize the energy levels of the two terpolymers (Fig. 1c). The HOMO and LUMO levels were calculated from the onset of oxidation and reduction potentials using equations HOMO = −(Eox + 4.8) eV and LUMO = −(Ered + 4.8) eV. As shown in Fig. 1d, PtDDA exhibits a HOMO level of −5.19 eV, which is slightly higher than that of PtDAA (−5.31 eV). Considering that the open circuit voltage (Voc) of PSCs is closely related to the offset between the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor, a deeper HOMO level of PtDAA will lead to a higher Voc. The LUMO level of PtDDA is higher than that of PtDAA as well, with an offset value of 0.13 eV. The downshifted HOMO/LUMO levels of PtDAA may be caused by the high electronegativity of unsaturated nitrogen atoms in the TTz unit.
To further investigate the photovoltaic properties of PtDDA and PtDAA, organic solar cells were fabricated with a conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/terpolymers:PC71BM/Ca/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The blend films with different additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO) concentrations and donor/acceptor weight ratios were processed to optimize the device performance. It was found that the use of DIO could improve the efficiency of PtDDA-based solar cells. In contrast, there is no effect for PtDAA-based devices. Without using DIO, the solar cells showed better PCEs (Fig. S5 and S6†). The optimized weight ratio was found to be 1:1 for PtDDA- and PtDAA-based devices (Fig. S5 and S6†). Fig. 2a shows the J–V curves of the champion cells and the device parameters are summarized in Table 1. For PtDDA PSCs processed without DIO, the Voc, Jsc and FF are 0.72 V, 7.18 mA cm−2 and 0.40, respectively, resulting in a low PCE of 2.1%. When processed with 1% DIO, the PCE increased up to 3.4%, mainly due to the increased Jsc (8.69 mA cm−2) and FF (0.55). For the as-cast BHJ films without using any additive, PtDAA:PC71BM solar cells achieve a high Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 12.87 mA cm−2 and a high FF of 0.74, with an overall PCE of 8.1%. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 8.1% represents one of the highest values reported so far for the PSCs based on terpolymers (see Table 2). Additionally, an average PCE of 8.0% within a small standard deviation of 0.1% was obtained, revealing the good reproducibility of high performance for PtDAA-based solar cells. Meanwhile, the addition of DIO could not further increase the cell efficiency. When processed with 1% DIO, the PtDAA:PC71BM device exhibits a decreased PCE of 7.7%, with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 12.25 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.74. The relatively higher Voc achieved in PtDAA-based solar cells is consistent with the deeper HOMO level of PtDAA than PtDDA.

To verify the Jsc difference between PtDAA- and PtDDA-based devices, the incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured to make the direct comparison (Fig. 2b). For PtDDA-based solar cells, the addition of DIO slightly increased the IPCE values. However, the maximum IPCE value is about 40%. In contrast, higher IPCE values over 60% were observed in the wavelength range of 370–650 nm for PtDAA-based devices. In particular, the maximum value of 72.5% was found at around 490 nm for the as-cast PtDAA solar cells, indicating efficient photon generation and charge collection within the devices. The integrated Jsc of PTDAA solar cells obtained from the IPCE curve is 12.72 mA cm−2, which agrees well with the value of 12.87 mA cm−2 measured under the simulated light with a mismatch less than 2%.
The charge carrier transport properties of PtDDA and PtDAA films were studied using organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). Typical output and transfer curves are presented in Fig. 3. As can be seen from the transfer curves, the devices show typical p-type transport properties. PtDAA shows a high mobility of 0.28 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is approximately one order of magnitude higher than that of PtDDA (0.035 cm2 V−1 s−1). The significant difference in carrier mobility is strongly related to the molecular crystallinity and orientation, which will be discussed in the following analysis. The mobility was also measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S7†) and the values are 0.77 × 10−3 and 3.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PtDDA and PtDAA, respectively, agreeing well with the OFET results.

It is well known that photovoltaic properties are affected by the active layer morphology. In order to gain insight into the morphology of these terpolymer:PC71BM blends, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out. As shown in Fig. S8,†PtDDA:PC71BM blend films show a smoother surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.45 nm. However, the surface of the PtDAA:PC71BM blend film exhibits a lager domain size and apparent rough surface morphology, with a RMS value of 1.21 nm. The addition of DIO increased the surface roughness of both terpolymer:PC71BM blend films.
The molecular orientation and packing in neat and blended films were investigated by grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements. The two-dimensional (2D) GIWAXS patterns for neat and blend films of PtDDA and PtDAA with the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane scattering profiles are shown in Fig. 4. The reflection peaks located at q ≈ 0.30 Å−1 for PtDAA and PtDDA neat films in the in-plane direction come from the (100) lamellar packing of the terpolymers. The lamellar (100) peak and π–π stacking (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction for the neat PtDDA film are located at q ≈ 0.35 and 1.72 Å−1, with a d-spacing of approximately 1.79 nm and 0.37 nm, respectively. In the in-plane direction, the (010) diffraction peak of PtDDA is nonexistent, indicating a preference for the face-on molecular orientation in the neat PtDDA film. For the PtDAA neat film, a stronger edge-on and a weak face-on orientation of (010) π–π stacking peaks are observed, and located at q ≈ 1.78 Å−1, with a corresponding packing space of 0.35 nm. Thus, the edge-on and the face-on polymer backbone orientation coexist in the PtDAA film. However, compared to PtDDA, PtDAA showed a shorter π–π stacking distance, indicating better crystallinity, which agrees well with the SCLC results.

(g) Line curves in out-of-plane and in-plane directions from 2D GIWAXS patterns. 
When blended with PC71BM, the two blend films show obvious and broad diffraction halos at q ≈ 1.32 Å−1, which are attributed to the aggregation of PC71BM. As for the PtDDA blend film, either the in-plane or the out-of-plane profile shows no obvious reflection peak. The absence of π–π stacking reflection in the PtDDA:PC71BM blend film indicates that the face-on molecular orientation of the PtDDA neat film is disrupted by the PC71BM. For the PtDAA:PC71BM film, compared to its neat film, the (010) reflection peak located at 1.77 Å−1 is enhanced in the out-of-plane direction and decreased in the in-plane direction, indicating a more face-on orientation of the PtDAA polymer in the blend. The face-on crystallites were considered to be beneficial for charge carrier transport. When processed with additive DIO, the (100) peak of PtDDA in the out-of-plane direction is stronger, indicating that the lamellar packing of PtDDA is significantly increased, which explains why the device performance is greatly enhanced after being processed with the additive. In contrast, the PtDAA blends show similar diffraction profiles with slightly enhanced π–π stacking in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, which is in agreement with the trend of the device performance.
Furthermore, resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was used to study the feature of phase separation in their respective blend films (Fig. 5). A resonant energy of 284.2 eV was selected to provide the optimized scattering contrast.44 The as-cast PtDAA:PC71BM blend shows an interference at q ∼ 0.16 nm−1, corresponding to a mode domain spacing (centre-to-centre) of ∼39 nm, which is larger than ∼17 nm of the PtDDA:PC71BM blend film. When DIO additive was used, the domain spacing of PtDAA:PC71BM and PtDDA:PC71BM films increased up to 45 nm and 70 nm, respectively. This is consistent with the results observed from the AFM morphology. In addition, it is noted that average composition variations of BHJ blends can be estimated through integrating R-SoXS scattering profiles.45,46 As shown in Fig. 5, the total scattering intensity (TSI) for the as-cast PtDAA:PC71BM film is slightly lower than that of the blend processed with 1% DIO. This is consistent with the slight fluctuation of the FF. Furthermore, the scattering profiles of the PtDDA based blend change dramatically after the addition of 1% DIO. The total scattering intensity of PtDDA:PC71BM with 1% DIO is much higher than that of the one without additive, revealing that the addition of DIO leads to higher average domain purity and results in significant increases in the FF. Generally, high average domain purity is beneficial to restrain charge carrier recombination and finally enhance the device performance. Thus, the DIO improved performance of PtDDA based solar cells is mainly attributed to the increase of the relative purity. However, PtDAA:PC71BM is less influenced by DIO. Higher average domain purity results in an enhanced FF but not the overall device performance.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, two novel terpolymers named PtDDA and PtDAA were synthesized and characterized. The incorporation of TT and TTz units afforded two different backbone alternating structures of D1–D2–D1–A1 (D–D–A type) for PtDDA and D1–A1–D1–A2 (D–A–A type) for PtDAA. Due to the higher electronegativity of nitrogen atoms in TTz fused rings, PtDAA exhibits a better ordered molecular structure, stronger aggregation tendency and deeper HOMO level compared to PtDDA. Solar cells based on PtDAA showed a high PCE of 8.1%, with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 12.87 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.74. The high efficiency of 8.1% is one of the highest values reported so far for the PSCs based on conjugated terpolymers, which mainly originates from the efficient carrier transport in the active layer, high crystallinity of the terpolymer, and high domain purity. This work shows that the D–A–A type terpolymer is a promising candidate for the fabrication of high performance solar cells.
