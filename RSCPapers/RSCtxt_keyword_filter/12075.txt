Six small bandgap polymers with optical bandgap ranging from 1.0–1.9 eV are presented in this paper. All polymers utilize an electron donor–acceptor–donor (DAD) segment in the polymer backbone, creating a partial charge-transfer, to decrease the bandgap. The design, synthesis and the optical characteristics as well as the solar cell characteristics of the polymers are discussed. The positions of the energy levels of the conjugated polymer relative to the electron acceptor are of significant importance and determine not only the driving force for exciton dissociation but also the maximum open-circuit voltage. This work also focuses on investigating the redox behavior of the described conjugated polymers and electron acceptors using square wave voltammetry. Comparing the electrochemical data gives important information of the structure-property relationships of the polymers.IntroductionDuring the last few decades, extensive research has been focused on conjugated polymers as electron donors in polymer solar cells.1 The main advantage of a polymer solar cell is the possibility of large area printing in a continuous reel to reel process. The active layer of the most efficient polymer solar cell consists of the conjugated polymer and an electron acceptor, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, [60]PCBM.2 Power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of around 6% have recently been reported, and there is a need for improvement.3A polymer solar cell typically consists of a conjugated polymer as electron donor and a methanofullerene derivative as electron acceptor sandwiched between two electrodes. The research field of polymer solar cells escalated when the bulk heterojunction solar cell was discovered in the early 1990s.4,5 The bulk heterojunction concept creates a bicontinuous phase of the electron donor and acceptor with a large interfacial area. Incident photons will pass through the transparent anode and be absorbed by the active layer. The principle of a bulk herterojunction solar cell is shown in Fig. 1. If a photon has an energy larger than the bandgap of the polymer, an electron will be excited from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), leaving a positive charge on the HOMO. If the LUMO of the electron acceptor is at lower energy compared to the LUMO of the conjugated polymer the electron will be transferred resulting in charge separation of the electron-hole pair. The exciton will only dissociate if the energy gain is greater than the exciton binding energy of polymers. LUMO positions of the polymer and acceptor separated by roughly 0.3 eV are expected to yield satisfactory charge separation and prevent charge recombination.6,7 Fig. 1  Energy diagram of a polymer solar cell. The charge separation step requires a PCBM molecule at close distance to the polymer and will only occur near the polymer/PCBM interface. The generation of charge carriers will be followed by transport of the electrons to the cathode and the holes to the anode. The active layer has to provide continuous pathways for the separated charges to reach their respective electrodes. It is a difficult task to create large interfacial area and continuous pathways simultaneously. This explains why the morphology of the active layer is so important and needs to be optimized in order to reach a high PCE for the solar cell.8The electron acceptor, e.g. [60]PCBM, will also absorb light and participate in photocurrent generation. The absorbed photon will cause excitation of an electron from the HOMO to the LUMO of [60]PCBM. Charge separation occurs by transfer of an electron from the HOMO of the conjugated polymer to the HOMO of [60]PCBM. This gives the same energy configuration as after charge separation of an exciton created by photon absorption in the conjugated polymer.Solar cells are evaluated from the current–voltage characteristics obtained using a solar simulator. The PCE is dependent on the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc) and the fill factor (FF). The Voc mainly depends on the energy difference between the polymer HOMO and the electron acceptor LUMO.9 The Jsc is mainly dependent on the number of absorbed photons but also on properties of the active layer e.g. charge carrier mobility, morphology, and film thickness. Lately, our work has been focused on extending the absorption spectra of the conjugated polymers into the near-infrared region in order to cover important parts of the solar irradiance spectrum to increase the number of absorbed photons in the final devices. Incorporation of a donor–acceptor-donor (DAD) segment into the polymer backbone induces a partial charge transfer which decreases the bandgap and red-shifts the absorption.10–12 The donor is typically a thiophene unit (Fig. 2) while the acceptor is of a more complex nature depending on the desired characteristics of the polymer. Fig. 2  Polymer structures. Decreasing the bandgap has to be done with careful consideration, to prevent diminished performance of the final device. Moving the HOMO of the polymer closer to the vacuum level will lower the maximum Voci.e. the distance between the HOMO of the polymer and the LUMO of the electron acceptor (Fig. 1).9 If the LUMO of the polymer is moved away from vacuum, an appropriate electron acceptor has to be chosen to guarantee satisfactory driving force for photoinduced charge separation.13In this paper we describe the design and synthesis of six different polymers reported by our group (see Fig. 2) and present how the chemical structures of the polymers affect their optical absorption. This is followed by a discussion of the solar cell characteristics for the polymers combined with fullerenes. Finally, we discuss the use of electrochemistry to determine the band positions of the polymers and present new experimental data obtained using square wave voltammetry (SWV).14Design and synthesisOne major advantage with conjugated polymers in solar cells over inorganic analogues is the possibility to tailor-make the polymer properties by making small changes to the chemical structure. Changing the side chains, position of the side chains and the nature of the DAD-segment will influence numerous properties such as bandgap, energy levels, color, solubility, molecular weight, mobility, and morphology. These properties change solar cell characteristics and will have a large impact on the PCE of the final device.Scheme 1 and Scheme 2 show the synthetic route to all polymers except for APFO-3, which is prepared following a procedure reported elsewhere.15 The final step of the synthesis involves step-growth polymerization of two comonomers. In all but one of the polymers (LBPP1) a dioctyl fluorene comonomer is polymerized with a DAD-comonomer forming an alternating polyfluorene (APFO). The APFO-Green series are alternating polyfluorenes having a green color in their neutral states. The bandgap of the polymer can be further reduced by replacing the fluorene with a dioctyloxy para-phenylene. The resulting conjugated polymer is then labeled a low bandgap para-phenylene (LBPP) polymer.16 Synthesizing polymers with a step-growth process requires a close to stoichiometric proportion of the comonomers to obtain high molecular weights. Table 1 shows the molecular weights of the reviewed polymers. APFO-Green517 and LBPP-116 have solubilizing side chains on the DAD-segment. Logically, APFO-Green5 and LBPP-1 show the highest molecular weights of the polymers. If the polymer has a poor solubility, long polymerization times will result in precipitation of polymer chains which limits the molecular weight. Although the precipitated chains might be solvated by adding more solvent, it is necessary to control the molecular weight during polymerization. This can be done by adding one of the comonomers in slight excess, increasing the yield of soluble polymer. All polymers in Fig. 1 have been end-capped by the addition of bromobenzene and phenylboronic acid after a certain reaction time, leaving phenyl end groups on the polymer chains.

Scheme 2  Synthetic route to APFO-Green2 and APFO-Green5. Synthesizing conjugated polymers is often a difficult task that involves several steps going from starting materials to comonomers, and then the final polymer. When considering the synthetic route in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2, one notices that some reaction steps frequently recur. Synthesis of APFO-Green1, APFO-Green2, APFO-Green5 and LBPP-1 all involve the reduction of a dinitro compound with iron to form the corresponding diamine.10 One interesting feature is that the reduction process involving iron is not powerful enough to open the thiadiazole ring to form the tetraamine. This makes the reduction of the dinitro compound with iron an excellent reaction in the synthetic route towards APFO-Green1 and LBPP-1, where ring-opening of the thiadiazole unit is undesirable. However, in order to synthesize the DAD-segment present in APFO-Green9, the tetraamine pointed out in Scheme 1 has to be prepared. This time the thiadiazole unit needs to be reduced to amines. Therefore the more powerful reduction path with zinc is chosen. During the synthesis of the tetraamine it was noticed that addition of a small amount of water resulted in a remarkable enhancement of the yield.18The polymers have all been synthesized by Suzuki coupling with a tetrakis[triphenylphosphine]palladium(0) catalyst. The Suzuki coupling is an efficient method for making aryl-aryl bonds, which is important for making high Mw conjugated polymers. Besides the Pd catalyst, and a small amount of base, the Suzuki method requires a boron compound and a halogen compound in order to work. As depicted in Scheme 1 and Scheme 2, the fluorene monomer is functionalized with 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaboralane. Hence, the DAD monomer needs to have halogen functional groups. Two different synthetic paths are possible. The first alternative is to add the bromines from N-bromosuccinimide as the final step of the comonomer synthesis. Performing the bromination after the condensation reaction with the diketone involves potential problems with overbromination. Obviously this will result in a cross-linked and insoluble polymer. To prevent overbromination it is possible to perform the bromination prior to the condensation reaction. Although this solves the problem with overbromination, it might cause loss of bromines during the reduction of the nitro groups with Fe or Zn. However, late results prove that the loss of bromines during the reduction step is negligible under mild conditions.19Optical absorptionOptical absorption measurements are of significant importance, not only to compare the absorption spectrum of the conjugated polymer relative to the solar irradiance spectrum, but also to obtain a value of the optical bandgap. Absorption spectra of the polymers are presented in Fig. 3. The small bandgap conjugated polymers have two absorption peaks. The low energy peak originates from a charge-transfer band associated with the DAD-segment.20 Absorption at long wavelengths makes exciton generation by a low energy photon possible. The value of the optical bandgap is often determined by the onset of absorption. The most widely accepted procedure to obtain an onset value is to draw a baseline in the spectrum and retrieve the point of intersection with the line of the maximum slope of the absorption peak. Fig. 3  Optical absorption of polymer films. According to Table 2, APFO-321 has an onset of absorption at 640 nm which indicates that the polymer has a significantly larger bandgap compared to the other polymers. The benzothiadiazole unit in the DAD-segment is not electron deficient enough to extend photon capture to longer wavelengths. However, the relatively large optical bandgap of 1.9 eV for APFO-3 implies a HOMO position further away from vacuum compared to the other polymers, giving a high Voc.

The onset of absorption is between 800–980 nm for the APFO-Green polymers, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 1.3–1.5 eV. APFO-Green1 has the smallest bandgap of the APFO-Green polymers due to the highly electron deficient [1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline unit, creating a strong internal charge-transfer that red-shifts the absorption. APFO-Green5 shows the largest optical bandgap (1.5 eV) of the APFO-Green polymers.LBPP-1 shows a remarkable absorption peak with an onset of 1240 nm. The extremely small optical bandgap (1.0 eV) is due to the introduction of a new comonomer. Replacing the fluorene with an electron rich dioctyloxy phenylene unit will strengthen the electron donating moiety of the DAD-segment. The induced partial charge-transfer will implement photon harvesting well into the near-infrared region.Device characteristicsThe devices were fabricated by spin coating the active layer onto the anode. A typical cross section of the final cell is: ITO-covered glass substrate/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PCBM/LiF/Al. Device characteristics are summarized in Table 3. For more experimental details on device characteristics, see primary references 13, 15–18.

Fig. 4  EQE of the polymers. All curves originate from blends of polymer and [60]PCBM except for APFO-Green1 which is blended with [60]BTPF. The EQE curve of APFO-Green1 in Fig. 4 is obtained from measurement on a blend with [60]BTPF. Both APFO-Green1 and [60]BTPF have a weak absorption between 500–700 nm. Replacing [60]BTPF with the C70 analogue enhances photon capture and EQE in the visible region.13 Solar cells based on APFO-Green1:[70]BTPF performs moderately reaching a PCE of 0.7%.Design and preparation of APFO-Green9 was made with the suspicion of poor charge separation properties together with PCBM. However, APFO-Green9 works as electron donor in polymer solar cells, showing an impressive Voc (0.81 V) and PCE (2.3%) while maintaining a decent photocurrent.18 These values are based on [70]PCBM where the EQE are enhanced at 450–650 nm compared to devices made from [60]PCBM.The chemical structure of APFO-Green2 and APFO-Green5 only diverge by the added side chains of APFO-Green5. Despite the resemblance, APFO-Green 5 shows a far superior PCE of 2.2%. The reason is that the hole mobility is increased by two orders of magnitude for APFO-Green5 relative to APFO-Green2, raising the Jsc to 8.20 mA cm−2. The high photocurrent gives a satisfactory enhancement of the EQE as seen in Fig. 4.LBPP1 yields solar cells with somewhat poor Voc and PCE. However, the focus of this polymer should merely be on the EQE-curve, proving that photon capture is possible well into the near infrared region.Electrochemical measurementsCyclic Voltammetry (CV) is a widely used method for investigating the oxidation and reduction processes of conjugated polymers.23,24 CV is usually performed in a three electrode electrochemical cell containing a working electrode, a counter electrode, and a reference electrode. The working electrode is coated with a thin film of the polymer. When the potential of the working electrode is increased the conjugated polymer will eventually be oxidized, meaning electrons are extracted from the material as indicated by a current flow between the working electrode and counter electrode. The ionization potential is related to the HOMO of the polymer. Lowering the potential of the working electrode will at some point result in reduction of the conjugated polymer. This reduction peak is associated with the LUMO position of the conjugated polymer.The graphical and mathematical procedures estimating the positions of HOMO and LUMO levels from electrochemical data are inexhaustible sources of discussion. The onset values of the electrochemical peaks are often used to get a good correlation with the optical bandgap. This method is doubtful and ill-defined from a voltammetric perspective. Optical absorption and electrochemical measurements differ in the sense of energy processes contributing to bandgap estimation. Hence, the optical and electrochemical bandgap should not converge. Another disadvantage with CV is undesired peaks from background currents. One example is the background peak originating from hydrogen gas formation. The peak is located on the cathodic side of the Ag/Ag+ reference electrode and interferes with the electron affinity peak of many conjugated polymers, making their LUMO positions hard to estimate.Besides the current-potential relationship, all voltammetric techniques are also dependent on the current-time response. In CV, the potential increase during a sweep is too fast for allowing decay of the capacitive charging. The resulting redox waves are not originating from pure faradic current. Estimated energy levels from onset values will therefore be influenced by the sweep rate.23 In an attempt to minimize the time dependence, several pulse voltammetric techniques have been proposed.14,25 The pulse voltammetric techniques are all based on chronoamperometry, where the current is measured as a function of time after applying a potential pulse. The basis of all pulse techniques is that the rate of the decay of the charging current is considerably faster than the decay of the faradic current.SWV14 is a pulse voltammetric technique where a square wave potential is superimposed over a staircase potential. The current is sampled at the end of each square wave half cycle, so that the contribution to the current signal from the capacitive charging current is minimized. In this way, the time dependence is effectively hidden and fast scans probing the redox behavior of the materials are possible. During each step, the current is measured for the forward and the reverse scan. By plotting the difference spectrum, only the reversible processes contribute to the oxidation and reduction peaks, yielding well resolved spectra which are easy to interpret. A peak value in a square wave voltammogram corresponds to the half potential of an ideal CV wave.Measurements of the oxidative peak potential of an internal standard, e.g. ferrocene, after each scan eliminates the difficulties of the potential of the reference electrode. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the reviewed polymers and electron acceptors were estimated from the peak values by setting the oxidative peak potential of Fc/Fc+vs. the normal-hydrogen electrode (NHE) to 0.630 V,26 and the NHE vs. the vacuum level to 4.5 V.25Electrochemical resultsWhen evaluating the suitability for a conjugated polymer to work as an electron donor in a solar cell one needs to know the interplay with the electron acceptor on an energy level basis. Therefore it is crucial that the determination of the energy levels is made for both the donor and acceptor material under identical experimental conditions. Fig. 5 displays the redox behavior of the polymers and [60]PCBM obtained by SWV. The plot can be used to draw conclusions on how the polymeric structure alters the molecular orbital positions or to estimate the maximum Voc and driving force for charge separation. Estimation of HOMO and LUMO positions together with the electrochemical bandgap are summarized in Table 4. SWV measurements on films of [60]PCBM and [70]PCBM show a separation of the reductive peak potentials by 90 mV. Similar measurements performed in solution show a separation of only 10 mV.

Optical absorption measurements imply that APFO-3 has a relatively large bandgap, compared to the other investigated polymers, and that the driving force for charge separation and the maximum Voc are of attractive values. This is confirmed by SWV measurements. The LUMO of APFO-3 is separated from the LUMO of [60]PCBM by 0.7 eV which makes APFO-3 a polymer with excellent charge separation properties. Looking at the results from electrochemistry, APFO-3 has its oxidation peak furthest away from vacuum indicating that APFO-3 has the biggest Voc of the conjugated polymers reviewed in this paper. From the photovoltaic data listed in Table 3 we can see that solar cells with APFO-3 show an impressive Voc of over 1 V. The value is considerably lower than the electrochemical measured distance between the polymer HOMO and [60]PCBM LUMO. Recent studies indicate that properties of a charge transfer state at the polymer/PCBM interface rule the photovoltage.27APFO-Green1 absorbs light up to about 1 μm and has a smaller bandgap compared to APFO-3. As shown in Fig. 5, the reduction peak of APFO-Green1 is only separated from the reduction peak of [60]PCBM by 10 mV. This implies that only a very small number of the absorbed photons will dissociate into charge carriers. Attempts of fabricating lab-scale solar cells using APFO-Green1 as electron donating material and [60]PCBM as electron acceptor have resulted in very poor devices.28 However, APFO-Green1 is still an interesting polymer for solar cell application, and functions together with the electron acceptor [70]BTPF that has a reduction peak further away from vacuum compared to [60]PCBM. Solar cells based on APFO-Green1 and [70]BTPF allow generation of free charge carriers, proven by efficient photoluminescence (PL) quenching of blend films at 850−1100 nm compared to neat polymer, and CV measurements showing a separation of the reduction peaks by about 0.3 V.13The chemical structure of APFO-Green9 resembles that of APFO-Green1. However, APFO-Green9 has the less electron accepting pyrazino[2,3-g]quinoxaline unit in the polymer backbone. The electrochemical bandgap is broadened by 0.3 eV and the reduction peak of APFO-Green9 is moved 40 meV closer to vacuum compared to APFO-Green1, slightly improving the charge separation process.An estimated value of the driving force for photoinduced charge separation can be obtained by measuring the LUMO-peaks from two individual scans of the two materials. If the same setup and measurement procedures are used, peak values from the two scans should be comparable. However, performing SWV on a mixture of polymer and electron acceptor yield reduction peaks of both materials within the very same spectrum. This gives a value of the driving force for charge separation with high significance. Varying the ratio between polymer and electron acceptor will help targeting the reduction processes. Fig. 6 shows a scan of a mixture of APFO-Green9 and [70]PCBM. The driving force for charge separation is estimated to 160 meV. Fig. 6  SWV measurement on a film of APFO-Green9 and [70]PCBM. APFO-Green2 and APFO-Green5 have reduction peaks well separated from the electron acceptors commonly used. APFO-Green2 has no side chains attached to the phenyl groups of the acceptor in the DAD-segment. APFO-Green5 was synthesized with the incorporation of alkoxy side chains on the para-positions of the phenyl rings. Due to the resonance structure of the phenyl group, an alkoxy side chain in para-position is allowed to donate electrons into the polymeric structure. This makes the acceptor of the DAD-segment less electron deficient, resulting in a weaker charge-transfer and a larger bandgap. Unfortunately, a larger bandgap blue-shifts the absorption which disagrees with the main goal of a small bandgap conjugated polymer i.e. photon harvesting at long wavelengths. However, SWV measurements show that the bandgap of APFO-Green5 is broadened only by moving the LUMO position. The driving force for charge separation between APFO-Green5/[60]PCBM is increased by 140 meV while maintaining the same maximum Voc as for APFO-Green2, although this is not seen in the Voc of the devices.As discussed above, the introduction of a phenylene substituted comonomer in LBPP-1 decreases the bandgap by strong partial charge transfer along the polymer backbone. According to Table 4, the driving force for charge separation to [60]PCBM is 160 meV. Although LBPP-1 is a unique polymer with measurable EQE up to 1200 nm, the extremely small bandgap reduces the Voc in fabricated devices.Previous electrochemical measurements and energy level estimations in our groups have been done using different evaluation methods.23 Small deviations in HOMO and LUMO values occur.ConclusionsSynthesizing conjugated polymers with the aim of reaching high PCE requires knowledge on how the structure and position of the side chains influence the position of the energy levels and size of the bandgap. The position of the HOMO and the LUMO of a conjugated polymer needs to be carefully matched to the energy levels of the electron acceptor and the work function of the electrodes in order to yield a high Voc and a sufficient driving force for charge separation. Using SWV, the HOMO and LUMO positions can be estimated relative to vacuum. If the redox behavior of the polymers is measured in exactly the same way, the energy levels can be compared and conclusions about structure-property relationships of the conjugated polymers can be drawn. The design of new materials for more efficient polymer solar cells is therefore facilitated.ExperimentalElectrochemical measurementsSquare wave voltammetry14 measurements were carried out on a CH-Instruments 650A Electrochemical Workstation. A three-electrode setup consisting of platinum wires both as working electrode and counter electrode, and a Ag/Ag+ quasi reference electrode was used. A 0.1 M solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) in anhydrous acetonitrile was used as supporting electrolyte. The polymers and fullerene derivatives were deposited onto the working electrode from chloroform solutions, containing a small amount of Bu4NPF6. The electrolyte was bubbled with nitrogen gas prior to each experiment. During the scans, nitrogen gas was flushed over the electrolyte surface. After each experiment, the system was calibrated by measuring the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox peak. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers and electron acceptors were calculated from the peak values of the third scan by setting the oxidative peak potential of Fc/Fc+vs. the normal-hydrogen electrode (NHE) to 0.630 V,26 and the NHE vs. the vacuum level to 4.5 V.25
