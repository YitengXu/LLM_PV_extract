    , Accepted 16th September 2019First published on 17th September 2019AbstractIn this work, a new non-fullerene small molecule acceptor (NF-SMA) named BP-4F, based on benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]di(cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene) with 4-(2-ethylhexyl)phenyl conjugated side chains (BDTP) as an electron-donating core, flanked with a strong electron-withdrawing 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile (2FIC) unit, is designed and synthesized for polymer solar cell applications. BP-4F exhibits strong absorption in the 550 to 830 nm region with a narrow optical band gap of 1.49 eV, suitable energy levels with a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of −3.90 eV and an effective electron mobility of 2.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. When blended with the wide bandgap polymer PM6 as the active layer, the polymer solar cells (PSCs) achieve an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.9% with an energy loss (Eloss) as low as 0.59 eV, which is of benefit to overcome the trade-off between Jsc and Voc. Furthermore, the BP-4F-based PSCs achieve an excellent PCE of 12.3% with a device area of 1.10 cm2. Notably, the devices show an excellent storage stability and photo-stability by retaining nearly 90% of the initial PCE in air under dark conditions and 93.5% in a glovebox under continuous illumination for 720 hours, respectively. These results indicate that BP-4F is an effective electron acceptor for high efficiency and stable polymer solar cells.
Introduction
As a promising clean and renewable energy conversion technology, polymer solar cells (PSCs) have attracted considerable attention due to their unique advantages of light weight, low cost, and the ability to fabricate flexible and semi-transparent devices.1–6 In typical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs, the active layer is composed of a p-type organic donor material and an n-type organic acceptor material.7–9 In recent decades, fullerenes and their derivatives have dominated the field of acceptor materials due to their fundamental properties, such as high electron affinity, high electron mobility, and three-dimensional electron transport properties.10–13 However, some intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene derivatives, such as weak absorption in the visible region, low structural flexibility, difficulties of tuning the electronic/optical energy levels, low miscibility with most donors and easy formation of dimers, impose constraints on the further development of BHJ PSCs.14,15 In particular, the low miscibility and the formation of dimers results in the bottleneck for improving the stability of fullerene-based devices, which may feature a significant burn-in loss. To overcome these problems, non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with wide and efficient absorption bands, facile synthesis, and good energy level tunability have been developed rapidly in recent years.16–18 Moreover, compared with fullerene-based PSCs, NFA-based PSCs possess promising long-term shelf-life and photo-oxidation stability with reduced burn-in loss.19–21
To date, a range of new NFAs with different building blocks and geometric dimensions have been designed.22–27 Among them, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type fused-ring electron acceptors (FREAs), which consist of an electron-donating planar fused-ring coupled with electron-withdrawing end groups, have shown great progress with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching ∼13–15% for single-junction PSCs.28–32 For FREAs, the central fused-ring donor unit affords a planar conjugated center to facilitate molecular packing and intermolecular interaction and hence to effectively tune their energy levels, absorption, and electron-transport properties.33,34 To date, indacenodithieno[3,2-b]dithiophene (IDT) and indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) have been predominately used as the central cores in FREAs.35,36 Meanwhile, a series of new FREAs with different sized cores from five fused rings to eleven fused rings have been reported.37–40 It has been well established that extending the conjugation of fused rings is beneficial to enhance the absorption, resulting in a higher photocurrent and forming an effective interchain π–π overlap, which causes higher intermolecular charge transport. However, extending the core size of fused rings is usually accompanied by certain difficulties, such as multi-step synthesis with low yield, poor solubility for purification and processing, the easy formation of large sized aggregations, and others.41,42 In this predicament, the side-chain conjugation strategy provides another choice to extend the conjugated area for FREAs using benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b0]dithiophene (BDT)-based fused rings. Research from Zhan's and Yang's groups has demonstrated a series of side-chain conjugated FREAs based on alkylthienyl substituted benzodithiophene (BDTT).43–45 It is thus verified that alkylthienyl conjugated side chains facilitate intramolecular conjugation and intermolecular interactions, which are beneficial for the absorption and charge transport of materials.
It is well known that 2D conjugated polymer donors have been dominating the donor materials and a series of 2D conjugated polymer donors with various conjugated side groups, such as alkylthienyl and alkylphenyl, are widely used in PSCs, which exhibit superior photovoltaic performances.46,47 Notably, compared with BDTT, alkylphenyl substituted BDT (BDTP) possesses a larger π-conjugated area and better planarity, which is beneficial to broaden the absorption and enhance the interchain π–π overlap, resulting in a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Besides, the weak electron-donating ability of benzene leads to attenuated δ-inductive effects, resulting in promotion of LUMO, which is beneficial to obtain a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc).48–50 Therefore, BDTP-based FREAs have the potential to produce PSCs with excellent photovoltaic performance.
Hence, this work presents the design and synthesis of a side-chain conjugated A–D–A type NFA, namely BP-4F (as shown in Scheme 1a), with a BDTP unit as the core and two cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene (CPDT) units to form seven fused rings as the donor unit and strong electron-withdrawing 2FIC units as the end groups. BP-4F exhibits strong absorption in the wavelength range from 550–830 nm with a narrow optical band gap of 1.49 eV and a high electron mobility of 2.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. To harvest more light and realize a more efficient photo-electron conversion, the wide bandgap polymer PM6, which was widely used and rather successful,51–53 with complementary absorption and well-matched energy levels was selected as the polymer donor material. As a result, the PSCs based on PM6:BP-4F exhibited an outstanding average PCE of 13.9%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.90 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.6 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.72. The energy loss (Eloss) of the PM6:BP-4F based devices is estimated to be as low as 0.59 eV, which is nearly the lowest value reported for PSCs with PCEs around 14%. An encouraging PCE of 12.3% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 22.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.62 was also achieved with a device area of 1.10 cm2. Notably, the PM6:BP-4F-based PSCs show an excellent storage stability and photo-stability. The devices retained the initial PCE value when stored for 720 h in a glove box and nearly 90% of the initial PCE value when stored in air. And the light-soaked devices lose only ∼6.5% of PCE in the course of 720 h.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and theoretical calculation
The synthetic routes of BP-4F are shown in Scheme 1b. A Pd(PPh3)4 catalysed Stille-coupling reaction between (4,8-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)phenyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (compound 1) and ethyl 2-bromothiophene-3-carboxylate afforded the intermediate compound 2. A Grignard reaction between compound 2 and 4-hexylphenyl-1-magnesium bromide followed by intramolecular cyclization resulted in compound 3. The crude product further reacted with phosphorus oxychloride to generate compound 4. Finally, Knoevenagel condensation between compound 4 and 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) gave the target molecule BP-4F. The chemical structure of each new compound was fully characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI-TOF MS. BP-4F is highly soluble in general organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM) and chloroform, at room temperature. The thermal properties (Fig. S1, ESI†) were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) which indicates that BP-4F possesses good thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 333 °C. The molecular geometries of BP-4F were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G** level, and the alkyl chains were replaced by methyl to simplify the calculations (Fig. S2, ESI†). BP-4F possesses a good planar backbone due to the excellent planarity of the fused core, which is beneficial to intermolecular π–π interactions. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the molecule is mainly distributed on the electron-donating core, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) is delocalized over the entire molecular backbone.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized optical absorption spectra of BP-4F in chloroform solution and thin film were investigated as shown in Fig. 1a. The absorption spectrum in solution shows a strong absorption in the wavelength region of 550–780 nm with a maximum absorption peak located at 730 nm, while the film shows a broader absorption with a distinctly redshifted absorption edge of 830 nm and the maximum absorption peak located at 775 nm, indicating that strong intermolecular π–π stacking interaction exists in the film. Hence, the wide band gap polymer donor PM6 with an absorption edge of ∼690 nm can form a perfectly complementary absorption with BP-4F, which is desirable to enhance the light harvesting for a higher Jsc of the solar cells. The absorption spectrum of the PM6:BP-4F-based blend film is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). After TA treatment, the spectrum shows a slightly redshifted and enhanced absorption at about 620 nm, which suggests that TA treatment would help to improve the stacking of blend films. The electrochemical properties of BP-4F were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of BP-4F, estimated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, are −5.63 and −3.90 eV, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1b, the ΔLUMO and ΔHOMO of PM6 and BP-4F are 0.27 and 0.15 eV, respectively, which provide sufficient driving force for charge separation.

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of PSCs with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/poly[(9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN-Br)/PM6:BP-4F/MoO3/Ag was evaluated. The detailed optimization processes of the devices based on PM6:BP-4F at different donor/acceptor (D/A) weight ratios and different thermal annealing (TA) treatment temperatures are shown in Fig. S5, Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†). Fig. 2a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on the PM6:BP-4F (1:1, w/w) blend as-cast and with the TA treatment at 160 °C for 10 min. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2a the device based on a blend at an optimal D/A weight ratio of 1:1 shows an average PCE of 10.9% with a Voc of 0.91 V, a Jsc of 19.9 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.60. When the blend was treated with TA (Fig. S5, ESI†), all the devices showed higher Jsc and FF values relative to those based on the as-cast blend. This indicates that the TA treatment can effectively optimize the blend morphology, which is beneficial to exciton dissociation, and charge transport and collection. Notably, when the blend film was treated with TA at 160 °C for 10 min, the best PCE dramatically increased to 14.2%, and an average PCE of 13.9% was achieved with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 21.6 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.72. The result was certified by the National Institute of Metrology, China (NIM) with a cell area of 2.65 mm2 (Fig. S6, ESI†), and a certified PCE of 13.3% was achieved. It is understandable that the slightly lower PCE certified by the NIM is mainly derived from the slightly decreased Jsc, which is due to the non-negligible mask thickness compared with the aperture size during the certification with the mask.54 The J–V curve for the PSCs with a device area of 1.10 cm2 is shown in Fig. 2a and the devices showed an encouraging PCE of 12.3% with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 22.1 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.62. In addition, the photovoltaic performance of PM6:BP-4F-based PSCs coated with room temperature solution was also evaluated. As shown in Table 1, the best PCE of 13.7% with an average value of 13.5% was achieved, which shows the potential for commercial applications.

The EQE spectra of devices as-cast and with the TA treatment are presented in Fig. 2b to confirm the high Jsc and probe the photon harvesting and charge collection processes of PSCs. Together with the absorption spectra shown in Fig. 1a and S3 (ESI†), the high and broad EQEs over the entire range from 300 to 830 nm suggest that the donor and acceptor materials make a considerable and complementary contribution to the overall Jsc values. The photo-response from 300 to 650 nm is mainly related to the contribution from PM6, while that from 650 to 830 nm is mainly attributed to the acceptor BP-4F. The EQE values for devices with the TA treatment are much higher than those for the as-cast device, achieving a maximum value of 81% at 590 nm and over 70% across the range of 520–810 nm. The EQE values for the as-cast device are relatively lower over the entire wavelength range of 300–850 nm with a maximum value of 76% at 590 nm. This is indicative of a more efficient photoelectron conversion process in the device with the TA treatment. In addition, the integrated Jsc values from the EQE curves are consistent with the measured values from the J–V tests with a deviation within 5%.
Hole and electron mobility
The hole and electron mobilities of the blend films were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S7, ESI†). The structure of the hole-only devices and electron-only devices is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/MoO3/Al and ITO/ZnO/active layer/PFN/Al, respectively. The electron and hole mobilities for the as-cast film were calculated to be 1.24 × 10−4 and 2.72 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. After the TA treatment, the electron and hole mobilities improved to 2.81 × 10−4 and 5.93 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which led to a higher Jsc and FF.55
Exciton dissociation and charge recombination
The exciton generation and dissociation process of PSCs was investigated by constructing the plots of photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective applied voltage (Veff) for the devices as-cast and with the TA treatment. As shown in Fig. 3a, at high Veff (≥2 V), it is generally assumed that all the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers and collected by electrodes, and the Jph reaches the saturation current density (Jsat). The charge dissociation probability (P(E, T)) in the devices can be estimated from the value of Jph/Jsat.56 Under maximal power output and short-circuit conditions, the P(E, T) is 75.0/94.9% for the as-cast device and 83.6/95.7% for the device with the TA treatment, respectively. The increased P(E, T) values indicate that the TA-treated device exhibits a higher excitons dissociation and more efficient charge collection as compared to the as-cast device.
 Fig. 3  (a) The Jphversus Vff, (b) the Jsc and (c) the Vocversus light intensity plots of the PM6:BP-4F-based PSCs. 
The light-intensity (Plight) dependence of Jsc was measured to further probe the charge recombination behavior in the studied devices. The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be represented by the power-law equation Jsc ∝ PlightS (where S is an exponential constant).57 Weak bimolecular recombination in the device would result in a linear dependence of Jsc on light intensity with an S value close to 1. As demonstrated in Fig. 3b, the S values for the as-cast device and TA-treated devices are 0.97 and 0.96, respectively, indicating that a weak bimolecular recombination occurred in both devices. The trap-assisted recombination losses were further studied by plotting Voc as a function of Plight. The relationship between Voc and Plight is as follows: Voc ∝ log(Plight). A slope of 1kBT/q implies that bimolecular recombination is the dominant mechanism. The signature of trap-assisted recombination depicts a stronger dependence of Voc on Plight with a slope of 2kBT/q.58As shown in Fig. 3c, the Voc displayed a lighter intensity dependence on Plight for the TA-treated devices with a slope of 1.15kBT/q, which is smaller than that (1.54kBT/q) for the as-cast devices. This indicates that trap-assisted recombination is suppressed via the TA treatment, leading to an improved Jsc and FF.
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the PM6 and BP-4F pure films and their blends with different processing conditions were measured (Fig. S8, ESI†). The PM6:BP-4F blends with TA treatment showed 94.4% and 96.6% PL quenching compared to the PL spectra of the pure BP-4F and PM6, respectively, which is higher than those of the as-cast blends. A higher PL quenching efficiency means that the PM6:BP-4F blends with the TA treatment have more effective photo-induced exciton dissociation than the as-cast blends, which is in agreement with the higher EQE and PCE values of the related devices.
Morphology studies
The morphologies of the PM6:BP-4F blend films as-cast and with the TA treatment were investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S9, ESI†). The AFM test profiles had root-mean-square (RMS) height values of 2.05 and 2.23 nm for the blends as-cast and with TA treatment, respectively. The slightly larger RMS values of the blend with TA treatment could be attributed to an increased crystallinity. From the TEM images, compared to the as-cast film, a more defined phase separation of the donors and acceptors with a bi-continuous interpenetrating network was observed in the film with TA treatment. This benefits exciton dissociation and charge transport, resulting in a higher Jsc and FF.
The microstructure of the BP-4F film and PM6:BP-4F blend films was characterized using grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) tests.59 The 2D GIWAXS diffraction images of the pure small molecular acceptor and related blend films are shown in Fig. 4a, and the corresponding 1D profiles of the in plane (IP) and out of plane (OOP) line-cuts are presented in Fig. 4b. The (100) peak for BP-4F is located at 0.34 Å−1, corresponding to an interchain distance of 18.7 Å in the IP direction, with a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 34.0 Å. The PM6:BP-4F blend films showed a high crystallinity with the high-order lamellar stacking peaks at (200) in the IP direction and (300) in the OOP direction being clearly visible. Furthermore, the (010) diffraction peaks along the OOP direction indicate that the blend film has a preferential face-on orientation. All the diffraction peaks in the PM6:BP-4F blend film became sharper after the TA treatment, indicating that annealing helps to form a higher degree of molecular ordering in the blend film. The π–π stacking CCL of PM6:BP-4F in the (010) direction with and without TA treatment was calculated via the Scherrer equation to be 25.9 Å and 21.3 Å, respectively. In the (100) direction, the interchain distance of the blend film with the TA treatment was reduced to 21.2 Å with a longer CCL of 94.9 Å, compared to the as-cast blend film at 21.6 Å with a CCL of 75.4 Å. A longer π–π stacking CCL and more densely packed molecules are beneficial to the intermolecular charge transport, which can explain why the PM6:BP-4F blends processed with TA achieved a higher carrier mobility.

The phase separation of the PM6:BP-4F-based films was probed using resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS).60 As shown in Fig. 4c, the domain size calculated from the RSoXS profiles was estimated to be 11.2 nm and 16.2 nm for the blend as-cast and with TA treatment, respectively. It is noted that such small domain sizes match well with the typical exciton diffusion length, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation. Additionally, RSoXS can probe variations in the average composition (relative domain purity) by integrating the total scattering intensity (TSI). The relative domain purities of the blends as-cast and with TA treatment were calculated to be 0.62 and 1, respectively. The small domain size with a relatively high domain purity causes an increased exciton dissociation, which minimizes the possibility of bimolecular recombination and promotes charge transport, resulting in a higher Jsc and FF.
Energy loss

Fig. 5a shows plots of PCE against Eloss for high-performance PSCs reported in this work and in the literature with a PCE > 12%. The detailed data of the corresponding devices are summarized in Table S4 (ESI†). The Eloss is defined as Eloss = Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the optical bandgap of the organic semiconductor with a smaller bandgap.61 Minimizing the Eloss provides an effective way to overcome the trade-off between Jsc and Voc for efficient PCE. Here, the Eg of the PSCs was deduced from the definitions of Epvg, which is relatively easy to implement as well as physically motivated.62,63 As shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the Eg was evaluated to be 1.49 eV, and thus the pair of PM6:PB-4F displays a low Eloss of 0.59 eV. Despite the low Eloss value, the PM6:BP-4F system can still achieve an average PCE as high as 13.9% with the best value of 14.2%, which is among the highest values reported to date for PSCs with an Eloss ≤ 0.6 eV. Importantly, as shown in Fig. 5b, the Jsc of the PSCs is among the highest values for PSCs with a Voc of around 0.90 V. This indicates that efficient exciton dissociation can take place at low Eloss.

Stability studies
The stability of PSCs is a critical issue for practical applications. To investigate the stability of PM6:BP-4F-based devices, measurements were carried out alongside unencapsulated devices under dark conditions in a nitrogen glovebox and encapsulated devices under dark conditions in air based on the International Summit on Organic solar cell Stability (ISOS). Fig. 5c depicts the stability of the devices and the evolution of parameters is shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†). Devices stored in the glovebox show essentially no efficiency loss over this timescale. In addition, the PM6:BP-4F-based PSCs retain nearly 90% of their PCE in air and under dark conditions after 720 h. This demonstrates the potential of the new acceptor BP-4F for practical applications. The photo-stability of devices was also tested with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/PM6:BP-4F/MoO3/Ag. The devices were placed in a nitrogen-filled glove box and continuously light-soaked using an array of white light emitting diodes (LEDs) with the spectrum shown in Fig. S12 in the ESI†. The light intensity was tuned to obtain current densities comparable to those produced under one-sun illumination. As shown in Fig. 5c and S11 (ESI†), the Voc and FF remain unaffected, while the Jsc undergoes a significant loss of 7.5% in the course of 720 h of light exposure. Notably, the PSCs show a promising long-term photo-stability with 6.5% losses without showing the typical exponential performance loss. To investigate the origin of the degradation, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) measurements of PM6 and BP-4F films were performed to determine the structural stability of fresh and aged films (continuous illumination for 720 h). As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), there is no significant difference in the absorption between the fresh and aged films, which proved that the decomposition of materials is absent.64 AFM was performed to explore the morphological changes of the blend film under continuous illumination for 720 h (Fig. S14, ESI†). The RMS height values of 2.09 and 2.01 nm for the fresh and aged films, respectively, indicate the relatively stable morphology of the active layer under continuous illumination. These results indicated that the degradation of devices cannot be attributed to the changes of the active layer. In order to further prove this point, the absorption spectra of the fresh and aged films based on PM6, BP-4F, and PM6:BP-4F were investigated as shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†) and they showed no significant changes after continuous illumination for 720 h, in support of the morphological stability under illumination aging.65 Electron-only devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/ZnO/PM6:BP-4F/Ca/Ag to further investigate the photo-stability. As shown in Fig. S16 (ESI†), the devices under continuous illumination are stable manifesting no changes at higher voltage and a slight decrease of current density at lower voltage. Excellent storage stability in air and photo-stability indicate that BP-4F-based PSCs have certain potential for commercial applications.
Conclusion
In conclusion, a new A–D–A acceptor BP-4F with BDTP as the fused central unit was designed and synthesized. BP-4F exhibits a strong absorption in the 550 to 830 nm region with a narrow optical band gap of 1.49 eV, suitable energy levels with a LUMO of −3.90 eV and an effective electron mobility of 2.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. In combination with the polymer donor PM6, the device exhibits a superior average PCE of 13.9%, with a Voc of 0.90 V, a Jsc of 21.6 mA cm−2, an FF of 0.72, and a low Eloss of 0.59 eV. This is attributed to the excellent complementary absorption, well-matched energy levels, balanced charge transport, good donor/acceptor miscibility, and a proper phase separation of the blend films. Notably, the PSCs achieved a promising PCE of 12.3% with a device area of 1.10 cm2 and showed an encouraging photo-stability by retaining 93.5% of the initial PCE under continuous illumination for 720 hours. These results indicate that BP-4F is an effective electron acceptor for high efficiency and stable polymer solar cells.
