    , Accepted 29th March 2022First published on 30th March 2022AbstractA ternary photovoltaic blend containing the PTB7 donor component, the PC71BM acceptor component, and colloidal quantum dots of lead sulfide (PbS QDs) was investigated using broadband dielectric spectroscopy. In the dielectric loss spectrum of PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QDs, γ- and β-relaxation processes in PTB7 were recognized and analyzed in terms of Arrhenius-type equations. To elucidate the effect of PbS QDs on molecular dynamics of PTB7, the activation energies of both processes were evaluated and compared with those obtained for the binary PTB7:PC71BM blend. Using the CELIV method, the charge carrier mobility was estimated. The PbS QD incorporation into the binary blend was shown to decrease both electron and hole mobility in the ternary PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QD blend. For evaluating the charge carrier lifetime in the ternary blend, the Cole–Cole diagrams derived from the dc conductivity data were plotted. The charge carrier lifetime was found to be much less than the hole extraction time, thus providing effective accumulation of charge carries at the electrodes in the ternary blend under investigation.
1 Introduction
Over recent decades, organic solar cells (OSCs) based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) have attracted much attention because of their prominent properties, such as low cost, light weight, mechanical flexibility, and easy processing.1–3 Nowadays, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the best representatives of single-junction OSCs has been reported to achieve and even exceed 18%.4,5 However, the PCE of conventional OSCs is still in the range of 7–8%. For improving the OSC performance, the strategy of incorporating a third optically active component, inorganic quantum dots (QDs), into the binary BHJ blend has been experimentally proved.6,7
In the literature,8–21 we found reports on the successful incorporation of semiconducting QDs into photovoltaic blends or QD layer deposition, and both allowed improving the photovoltaic device performance. As donor components, conventional polymers, such as poly[N-9′′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), poly{[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]} (PTB7), and poly {[2,6′ -4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b;3,3-b]-dithiophene] [3-fluoro-2 [(2-ethylhexyl) carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl]} (PTB7-Th), have been used. As acceptor, fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), has been utilized.
Liu16et al. reported on increasing the PCE from 5.22 to 6.94% in the PCDTBT:PC71BM photovoltaic blend by improving charge transport property and tuning the energy levels when they incorporated 2% CdS QDs. Sharma15et al. introduced 4% CdS QDs into the inverted PTB7:PC71BM OSC blend which allowed an increase of PCE from 6.3 to 7.01%. Li9et al. demonstrated that the PCE improved from 7.03% (control device) to 7.87% by doping the PTB7:PC71BM BHJ active layers with 5% PbS QDs. An enhanced performance (8.30% versus 7.56%) of PTB7:PC71BM was observed when a 13 nm thick PbS QD layer was deposited.17 Yang18et al. adopted low-dosage CdSe QDs (5%) as a third component of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based OSC. As a result, PCE was shown to be improved from 8.58% to 9.57% as compared with that of the control device. Guijarro19et al. embedded CsPbI3 perovskite QDs into a PTB7-Th:PC71BM blend. By optimizing the loading amount to be 3 wt%, they achieved a PCE of 10.8%, which is a 35% increase over that of the control device. Due to the synergistic effects of core/shell InP/ZnS QDs and the ethanedithiol-modified ZnO layer, Han20et al. reported a PCE of 10.2% in the ternary PTB7-Th:PC71BM:InP/ZnS OSC. Incorporating a third component in the active layer of OSCs was reported to extend lifetimes with improved morphological stability and better resistance to performance decay under real operational conditions compared to conventional binary OSCs.21
For better understanding of the phenomena occurring in BHJ, particularly exciton dissociation and charge carrier mobility, investigation of relaxation processes and conductivity of the polymer, which is a BHJ donor component, is critically advisable.22 In this respect, quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) and broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) could be treated as appropriate methods for the experimental study of polymer chain dynamics. In the literature, we found a few reports on molecular mobility of donor polymers in BHJ investigated using QENS23–26 and BDS.27–29 Comparing the capabilities of both methods, we should emphasize that the QENS technique could particularly be suitable for the analysis of small-scale molecular motions in the polymer because of a low and narrow timescale range (from 1 to 50 ps), whereas the BDS technique allows analyzing the mobility of polymer chains (from 10−6 to 10 s). Besides, the BDS method can be used to study electrical conductivity, which is a valuable characteristic of a photovoltaic blends.
In this paper, we report on the effect of PbS QDs on molecular dynamics, conductivity, and charge carrier mobility of BHJ based on the photovoltaic blend of PTB7 and PC71BM.
2 Experimental section
2.1 Sample preparation
A donor polymer component, PTB7, Mw = 80000–120000 g mol−1, purity >99.9%, was purchased from 1-Material, Inc. An acceptor component, PC71BM, purity 99%, was purchased from SES Research, Inc. Their chemical structures are presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Both materials were used as received. Colloidal quantum dots of lead sulfide (PbS QDs) with oleic acid ligands were synthesized by a colloid chemistry method.30 Their mean size (4.1 ± 0.4 nm) has been previously detected using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) technique.31
The mixture of PTB7:PC71BM at a weight ratio of 1:1.5 and a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 was dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB, Merck, purity 99.8%) doped with 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, Sigma, purity 99.9%) (CB:DIO = 97:3 vol%:vol%) and intensively stirred at 60 °C for 24 h. PbS QDs were dissolved in CB at a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 and stirred at 60 °C for 12 h. Then the PTB7:PC71BM and PbS QD solutions were blended to obtain PbS QD concentration in the blend equal to 3, 10, and 30 wt%. Afterwards, these blends were used for the formation of solid PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QD samples for further investigation.
For performing the BDS experiments, the solution containing 3 wt% of PbS QDs was drop-cast onto a round brass plate, which is the bottom electrode for the BDS study, and dried in air at room temperature for 12 h. After drying, the thickness of the layer 9.1 μm was measured using a Dektak 150 Surface Profiler (Veeco Instruments, Inc.). Then, the sample was tightly covered with the upper round brass electrode assuring a good electrical contact with the composite layer. Finally, the sample was annealed at 150 °C for 10 min to develop PTB7 morphology in the blend.32,33
For executing charge mobility measurements, special devices were prepared. They had the following configuration: ITO (100 nm)/SiO2 (70 nm)/PTB7:PC71BM: PbS QDs (80 ± 10 nm)/electrode (80 nm) where the electrode was Au and Al for the hole-only and electron-only devices, respectively. A SiO2 insulator layer on the ITO/glass substrate was prepared by conventional magnetron sputtering. Further procedures were performed in an argon-filled glove box (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O). The above mentioned polymer composite was spin-coated onto the ITO/SiO2 glass substrate at 700 rpm, dried at room temperature for 12 h, and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. The top metal electrode was deposited by the resistive thermal evaporation method in a vacuum thermal MB Evap evaporator at a vacuum of 2 × 10−6 mbar.
2.2 AFM experiments
The surface morphology was analyzed using a NTEGRA scanning microscope (NTMDT, Russia) with high-resolution GOLDEN Silicon AFM NSG10 probes (cantilever parameters: length 95 ± 5 μm, width 30 ± 3 μm, thickness 2 ± 0.5 μm, and tip curvature radius 10 nm).
2.3 BDS experiments
The components of the complex dielectric permittivity ε* = ε′ + iε′′, namely, the dielectric constant ε′ and dielectric loss ε′′ of the PTB7:PC71BM:PbS samples were analyzed using an Alpha Novocontrol dielectric spectrometer (Novocontrol Technologies GmbH & Co. KG) in wide ranges of frequency f (from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz) and temperature T (from −150 to 150 °C). The samples were measured in a dry nitrogen atmosphere upon 1 V alternating voltage in an isothermal regime.
The experimental relaxation spectra were treated with the WinFit Novocontrol software and fitted with the Havriliak–Negami (HN) model function34 (1)where εr and εu are the permittivity values at low (ω = 0) and high (ω → ∞) frequency limits, respectively, ω = 2πf is the angular frequency, τHN is the HN relaxation time of the process associated with its peak maximum, and a and b are fitting parameters representing the broadening and skewing characteristics of the relaxation peak, respectively. To account for the conductivity contribution, a term i(σ0/ε0ω)N where σ0 and ε0 = 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1 are the conductivity and permittivity of the free space, respectively, and N is the exponential factor was appended to eqn (1). The relaxation time, τmax, associated with the relaxation peak maximum was obtained as34 (2)The electrical conductivity spectra of the samples were straightforwardly derived from their dielectric loss spectra35 σ(f, T) = 2πε0fε′′(f, T)(3)
2.4 Charge carrier mobility measurements
The charge extraction by linearly increasing voltage (CELIV) technique36 was used for the measurements of the mobility of charge carriers. The CELIV setup included a USB oscilloscope (DL-Analog Discovery, Digilent Co.), which generated master pulse and recorded transient current. RC constants were at least a factor of 20 smaller than the time ranges of interest. In the ITO/SiO2/composite/Au and ITO/SiO2/composite/Al devices, the SiO2 layer served as a layer blocking the transfer of charge carriers between the ITO electrode and the polymer composite layer. In the course of the hole/electron mobility measurements, firstly a positive/negative bias was applied to the Au/Al electrode resulting in the hole/electron accumulation at the SiO2 interface. Then a triangle pulse of opposite voltage was applied to the metal electrode and the accumulated charge carriers were extracted from the polymer composite layer. The CELIV measurements were carried out within an argon-filled MBraun glove box. The confidence interval calculated from 10 replicates was 90%. Other experimental details have been described earlier.37,38
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Surface morphology
Before executing the BDS experiments, we performed and analyzed the surface morphology of the polymer blend films using the AFM and SEM techniques. The AFM image of the blend film doped with 3% PbS QDs depicted in Fig. S2 (ESI†) demonstrates a smooth surface morphology with a root mean square value of 0.775 nm. This value is typical for PTB7:PC71BM:QD composite surfaces9,15,18,19 and lower than that for the binary PTB7:PC71BM blend (5.45 nm29). The discovered smooth surface indicates good compatibility in a three-component system, ensuring good contact between layers and low interface resistance to encourage charge extraction and transport.9 Meanwhile, an increase in the PbS QD loading tends to increase the phase separation scale as shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), thus decreasing the quality of the interfaces which is harmful for efficient charge transport.15 Taking these remarks into consideration, further investigations were carried out exclusively for the sample with best characteristics, i.e. the ternary PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QD blend with a 3 wt% load of PbS QDs.
3.2 Molecular dynamics
In Fig. 1, the generalized behavior of dielectric constant ε′ and dielectric loss ε′′ of the ternary PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QD blend depending on frequency f and temperature T is depicted. For comparison, a similar behavior of the binary PTB7:PC71BM blend is presented.
 Fig. 1  Comparative representation of (a) dielectric constant and (b) dielectric loss of ternary PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QDs and binary PTB7:PC71BM blends as a function of frequency and temperature. 
As follows from Fig. 1(a), the dielectric constant of the ternary blend is independent of frequency and temperature in their wide ranges except the range of high temperatures and low frequency, in which ε′ intensively increases. In the dielectric loss spectrum, Fig. 1(b), the relaxation processes appearing due to dipole re-orientation upon alternating electrical field could clearly be recognized. They are manifested more distinctly as compared with those of the binary blend. The extensive signals observed at low frequencies and high temperatures for both ε′ and ε′′ components are due to enhanced mobility of free charges because of thermal energy accumulated by the material. As temperature increases, charge carriers accumulate sufficient thermal energy to overcome the energy gap and to get free.
The frequency dependent ε′(f) and ε′′(f) spectra of the ternary blend are presented in Fig. 2. In Fig. 2(a), the electrode polarization phenomena could distinctly be identified at low frequency (between 0.1 and 1 Hz) and high temperatures (above 100 °C). This phenomenon relates to charge carrier accumulation at the electrodes (in the vicinity of the electrodes).39–41 Beyond the electrode polarization region, ε′ achieves a constant value (ε′ = ε∞ = 9.9), which is independent of frequency. This value is more than twice higher than that of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend (ε∞ = 4.2, Fig. 1(a)) and much exceeds that of conventional organic semiconductors (typically ε∞ = 2–442). This disclosing is advantageous for effective OSCs since a high dielectric constant is associated with high device performance, specifically, increasing free charge carrier lifetime and decreasing probability of bimolecular charge recombination.42 Following Guijarro19et al., the latter could be declined upon QD incorporation in two ways. First, the holes located in QD domains are efficaciously screened from the electrons disposed in the PC71BM domains. Second, the distance between the PTB7 and PC71BM domains increases, thus weakening the Coulomb interaction between electrons and holes in excitons.

In Fig. 2(b), two dipolar relaxation processes, low-temperature γ-relaxation and high-temperature β-relaxation, could clearly be identified. However, because of their overlapping with conductivity and electrode polarization, before their detailed analysis they should be separated using the HN formalism described using eqn (1) and (2).
We separated the low-temperature γ-relaxation in the temperature window from −145 to −110 °C and found a maximum frequency fmax. An example of the spectrum separation at −120 °C is graphically presented in Fig. 3(a). The fitting parameters of the HN functions for γ-relaxation and conductivity are collated in Table S1 (ESI†). Then we associated the maximum frequency with the maximum relaxation time τmax = (2πfmax)−1 and plotted it against reciprocal temperature as shown in Fig. 3(b). A linear Arrhenius plot allows estimating the activation energy Ea = 0.26 eV of the γ-process. This value is similar to that (Ea = 0.29 eV) for γ-relaxation of the binary PTB7:PC71BM blend.29 Therefore, we can conclude that PbS QDs, in fact, do not affect dipolar γ-relaxation. Previously, we have attributed this process to the mobility of branched ethylhexyloxy side chains of the PTB7 component.29
 Fig. 3  (a) Representative fitting with the HN function and (b) Arrhenius diagram of the dipolar γ-relaxation process in the ternary blend at −120 °C. In (a), the HN fit function reveals a relatively wide (α = 0.33) and asymmetric (β = 0.55) dielectric peak. 
We undertook a similar deconvolution procedure to high-temperature β-relaxation, which is overlapped with conductivity and electrode polarization processes in the temperature range from −70 to −15 °C. The fitting parameters of the HN functions for β-relaxation and conductivity are registered in Table S2 (ESI†). The result of separation at −30 °C is exemplarily depicted in Fig. 4(a), whereas the Arrhenius plot of this relaxation is presented in Fig. 4(b). The activation energy of β-relaxation is found to be equal to 0.34 eV. We have analyzed β-relaxation in the binary PTB7:PC71BM blend and concluded that it was manifested as two distinct processes: β1-relaxation related to molecular mobility of the fluorinated thienothiophene unit of PTB7 with a single-branched ethylhexyloxy side chain (Ea = 0.51 eV) and β2-relaxation related to molecular motion of the same unit with two-branched ethylhexyloxy side chains (Ea = 0.78 eV).29 Taking this finding into account, we can deduce that PbS QDs facilitate β-relaxation and permit molecular mobility of the fluorinated thienothiophene unit as a whole. We believe that in this region of temperature and frequency, the mobility (fluctuation or orientation) of QD-related dipoles increases and these dipoles involve the fluorinated thienothiophene groups in their motion. As a consequence, a decrease in the activation energy of the β-relaxation process of the ternary blend as compared with that of the binary blend was detected.

3.3 Charge carrier mobility
From CELIV transient curves, Fig. 5, we found a characteristic time tmax related to the maximum current density and estimated charge carrier mobility μ as43 (4)where d is the thickness of the PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QDs layer, and A is the applied voltage ramp rate.
 Fig. 5  Transient currents in the electron-only and hole-only devices (blue and green lines, respectively) at A = 1.2 × 10 5 V s−1. The arrows indicate the maximum current density at t = tmax. 
Using eqn (4), we evaluated both hole mobility μh and electron mobility μe. Their values are presented in Table 1. Comparing these data with those of the binary blend29 (also presented in Table 1), we can conclude that PbS QD incorporation into the binary blend decreases the charge carrier mobility. The transport of holes and electrons occurs along the HOMO level of PTB7 and the LUMO level of PC71BM, respectively. Therefore, according to the energy diagram of the ternary blend components, Fig. 6, PbS QDs act as shallow traps for charge carriers because the valence band (−5.0 eV) and the conductive band (−4.0 eV) of the 4.1 nm PbS QDs44 are above and below than the HOMO level of PTB7 (−5.15 eV)45 and the LUMO level of PC71BM (−3.91 eV),46 respectively. However, the electron and hole mobility vary in different ways. A greater decrease in the mobility of holes compared to the mobility of electrons, we believe, could be associated with the observed increase in the mobility of PTB7 macromolecules. This causes an increase in the spatial disorder of the medium and, as a consequence, an enhanced decrease in the mobility of holes in the hopping transport.47

3.4 Electrical conductivity
In Fig. 7(a), the electrical conductivity σ of both ternary PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QDs and binary PTB7:PC71BM blends against frequency and temperature is depicted. Clearly, conductivity of both materials increases with increasing frequency and temperature in a similar way. However, we should emphasize that the σ values of the ternary blend are higher than those of the binary blend. That is, incorporation of PbS QDs into the binary blend promotes decreasing imbalance of electron and hole mobility, Table 1, which is manifested as an increase of conductivity.
 Fig. 7  (a) Comparative representation of conductivity of the ternary PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QDs and binary PTB7:PC71BM blends as a function of frequency and temperature, and (b) isothermal plots of conductivity of the ternary blend as a function of frequency at different temperatures. 
Detailed analysis of the frequency dependent conductivity of PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QDs, Fig. 7(b), allows concluding on existing two components of conductivity: ac and dc conductivities. As follows from Fig. 7(b), frequency independent ac conductivity appears at low frequency and high temperatures, whereas linearly dependent dc conductivity is typical for high frequency and low temperatures. The capacitive behavior of ac conductivity (e.g. a linear increase of measured conductivity with increasing frequency) is associated with the dipolar relaxations of the blend while the resistive behavior of dc conductivity (e.g. a plateau region observed at low frequencies and high temperatures) is attributed to the transport of charge carriers through the material.48 These particular signals correlate well with the dielectric dispersion observed for dielectric constant and dielectric loss characteristics, Fig. 1 and 2. Generally, these tendencies are true for the ternary blend under investigation, though the above detected relaxation processes frustrate the conductivity behavior.
3.5 Cole–Cole diagrams
We used the dc conductivity data presented in Fig. 7(b) for evaluating the charge carrier lifetime, which is a critically important characteristic of charge accumulation at electrodes.48–52

Fig. 8 demonstrates the Cole–Cole plots of the impedance spectra of the PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QD blend at temperatures 100, 110, and 120 °C. The reason for choosing these temperatures has been explained earlier.29 The shapes of impedance spectra are well-developed semicircles that are favorable for ascertaining the series resistance Rs (see the equivalent electrical circuit in the inset, in which the recombination resistance Rp and the capacitor Cμ are also presented). The fitting parameters of the equivalent circuit for the PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QD blend along with those for the PTB7:PC71BM blend29 are collated in Table 2. The validity of the Cole–Cole diagrams fitting was confirmed by computation of the dc conductivity values from the Cole–Cole plots and their consequent comparison with those derived from the experimental data presented in Fig. 7(b). A comparison is depicted in Fig. S5 (ESI†).

As follows from Table 2, the Rp parameter decreases with increasing temperature, thus ensuring transport of free charges through the polymer chain. A comparison of the Rp parameter values of the ternary and binary photovoltaic blends allows concluding that the addition of PbS QDs facilitates free charge transport. The fitting curves calculated with the fitting parameters are presented in Fig. 8 as solid lines.
To further elucidate the effect of PbS QDs on the OSC performance, we calculated the effective lifetime of the charge carrier τ as a product of Rp and Cμ52 τ = RpCμ(5)
Since the OSC performance strongly depends on the competition between charge carrier accumulation and recombination,48,53 their effective lifetime should be compared with the extraction time τext of the slowest charge carriers, the holes (see Table 1). The latter characteristics could be calculated as a half of the average hole path p divided by the hole mobility μh and the electrical field strength E49,52 (6)Using eqn (6), we computed the effective hole extraction time as τext = 1.4 × 10−3 s, which is proved to be much less than the effective hole lifetime (τ = 1.28 × 10−1 s). Thereupon, an inequality τ > τext providing effective accumulation of charge carriers at the electrodes and negligibility of the electron–hole recombination49,52 is valid for the ternary blend under analysis.
4 Conclusions
In summary, PbS colloidal QDs were incorporated into the PTB7:PC71BM photovoltaic blend and the resulting ternary PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QD blend was investigated using the BDS technique to elucidate the effect of PbS QDs on molecular dynamics of PTB7 and electrical conductivity of the blend.
From the dielectric constant spectra, the high-frequency dielectric constant of the ternary blend, ε∞ = 9.9, was estimated. This value was found to be more than twice higher than that of the PTB7:PC71BM binary blend and much exceeds that of conventional organic semiconductors providing effective OSC performance.
In the dielectric loss spectra of the PTB7:PC71BM:PbS QD blend, γ- and β-relaxation processes were recognized, deconvoluted, and analyzed in terms of the Arrhenius-type equations. The activation energies of both dipolar processes were evaluated and compared with those obtained for the binary PTB7:PC71BM blend. A comparison concluded that PbS QDs do not affect the dipolar γ-relaxation attributed to the mobility of the branched ethylhexyloxy side chains of the PTB7 polymer. Meanwhile, PbS QDs facilitate β-relaxation and enhance the molecular mobility of the fluorinated thienothiophene units.
Using the CELIV method, the charge carrier mobility was evaluated. By comparing the obtained data with those of the binary blend, we concluded that PbS QD incorporation into the binary blend decreases both electron and hole mobility. The increased mobility of the polymer chains is believed to be responsible for the decreased charge carrier mobility and suppression of the intermolecular hopping transport.
In the conductivity BDS spectra of the ternary blend, both dc and ac components of conductivity were detected. Using the dc conductivity data, the Cole–Cole impedance diagrams at selected temperatures were plotted and adequately fitted with an electrical equivalent circuit. To further elucidate the effect of PbS QDs on the OSC performance, the effective charge carrier lifetime τ was calculated and consequently compared with the hole extraction time τext derived from the hole mobility measurements. The discovered inequality τ > τext provides effective collection of holes and electrons at the anode and cathode, respectively, and negligibility of the electron–hole recombination in the ternary blend under investigation.
