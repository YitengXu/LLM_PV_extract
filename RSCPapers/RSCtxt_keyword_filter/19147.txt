    , Accepted 16th February 2021First published on 17th February 2021AbstractThree asymmetric spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX)-based hole transporting materials (HTMs) with N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-N′-(9,9′-dimethylfluoren-2-yl)amino (FPA) substituents, which are termed SFX-F, SFX-FM, and SFX-FP, have been synthesized by a facile process. When modifying the number and position of FPA substituents in the HTMs, it was found that there is no significant variation in the HOMO energy by increasing the number of FPA groups, while the thermal stability is governed by the substitution position. SFX-FM, which contains two meta-substituted FPA groups on the xanthene unit, exhibits a suitable HOMO energy level (−5.24 eV) and a strikingly high Tg (154 °C). In addition, SFX-FM also shows better film-forming properties and excellent hydrophobicity, which is conducive to fabricating high-performance devices. Noticeably, the PSCs based on SFX-FM achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17.29% under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2, unprecedentedly outperforming PSCs based on spiro-OMeTAD (15.14%).
Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are one of the most promising solar cell technologies because of their high absorption coefficient, ambipolar charge transport, long exciton diffusion length, and adjustable band gap.1–3 At present, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells based on perovskite materials has exceeded 25%.4–8 PSCs have a multi-layer structure, and the properties and quality of each layer will affect the PCE and stability of the cell. As a key layer in PSCs, the hole transport material (HTM) has the advantages of transporting holes, protecting the perovskite layer, blocking electron recirculation, and promoting perovskite crystallization.9,10 Since the sp3 hybrid atom exists at the junction of the π-conjugate of two molecules, the spiro-type molecule usually has an orthogonal structure, which offers several advantages, including rigid structure, high glass transition temperature (Tg), good amorphous stability, and excellent solubility.11 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) is composed of a spirobifluorene core and diphenylamine end groups, and its application to PSCs has been developed rapidly.12,13 However, its shortcomings of high price, low thermal stability, poor chemical stability and low conductivity are not conducive to the commercial promotion of PSCs. Therefore, many small molecules,14–17 and polymeric18–20 and inorganic hole transport materials (HTMs)21–23 have been developed to replace spiro-OMeTAD due to both efficiency and production cost.24
The spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) core is obtained by introducing an O atom into the “spiro” core.25 In 2016, Sun's group synthesized an SFX-based HTM termed X60 with a simple two-step reaction and the measured hole mobility is 1.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 2.34 times higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD, and the X60-based devices showed a high PCE of up to 19.84%.26 Subsequently, the research group further simplified the structure to obtain a new SFX-based compound X59 with only two substituents. The doped X59 device achieved an optimal efficiency of 19.8%,27 while showing less hysteresis and better device reproducibility. Xu et al. reported four pyridine-linked SFX HTMs with covalently linked units and applied them as 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) free HTMs in PSCs. XPP, in which two para-position substituted pyridine groups are incorporated into the SFX core, exhibited a high PCE of 17.2% in planar CH3NH3PbI3-based PSCs and 19.5% in mixed-ion planar PSCs without using tBP.28 Chiykowski et al. studied a series of TPA-substituted SFX HTMs and showed that the redox properties are determined by TPA groups on the conjugated fluorene moiety, while TPAs on the xanthene units affect the Tg value.29 One of the tailored HTMs, HTM-FX′ yielded a device PCE of 20.8% in a PSC. Recently, Lee et al.30 designed a novel carbazole-based SFX derivative SFXDAnCBZ and applied it to PSCs to obtain 20.87% efficiency.
Fluorene compounds have always been favored by researchers because of their broad application prospects in many fields such as photovoltaic materials, solar cells and biomedicine. The structural characteristics of fluorene compounds are as follows: (1) the fluorene ring is a special biphenyl structure with high thermal stability and photochemical stability; (2) structural modifications can be easily carried out at the 2-, 7- and 9-carbon to introduce a variety of functional groups; and (3) low price and easy availability of raw materials. The Tg of most SFX-HTMs reported so far is lower or slightly higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD, so the introduction of fluorene groups is one of the methods to increase the Tg of materials.
Herein, we have designed and synthesized three novel SFX-based HTMs with the N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-N′-(9,9′-dimethylfluoren-2-yl)amino (FPA) substituent,31–33 which are termed SFX-F, SFX-FM, and SFX-FP, and are readily prepared via a two-step reaction with a high overall yield. One of the tailored HTMs, four-branched compound SFX-FM, with two meta-substituted FPA groups on the xanthene unit, showed a high PCE of 17.29% in planar Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3-based PSCs, which is higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs (15.14%). Under the same fabrication conditions, the PSCs adopting SFX-FP and SFX-F as the HTM obtained a PCE of 15.45% and 14.54%, respectively. In addition, the laboratory synthesis cost of SFX-F, SFX-FM, and SFX-FP is approximately $20.91, $23.97, and $23.52g−1, respectively (Tables S1–S3, ESI†). The cost of our newly developed SFX-based HTMs is only one twentieth of spiro-OMeTAD (∼$500 g−1, high purity).
Experimental section
Synthesis
All the chemical reagents were used as received from Aladdin. Fig. 1 shows the structure of SFX-F, SFX-FM, and SFX-FP, and the synthetic route is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). The synthesis of compounds 2Br-F, 4Br-FM, 4Br-FP, and FPA was carried out by referring to the methods given in previous reports.29,31 Then one-step palladium-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig reaction between the SFX core and FPA substituents was utilized to obtain SFX-F, SFX-FM or SFX-FP under a N2 atmosphere with a yield of over 50%. The NMR and HR-MS characterization data of the materials are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1–S12).

Device fabrication and characterization
FTO-coated glass sheet (area 2 × 1.5 cm2) layers were etched with zinc powder and hydrochloric acid (2 M) to obtain the required electrode pattern. The etched glass was sonicated with detergent water, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in turn for 20 min, then blow-dried and cleaned by UV-ozone treatment for 20 min. Next, hydrochloric acid (2 M, 28 μL) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (0.23 M, 300 μL) were added to 4 mL of isopropanol, and stirred for 5 min to obtain a precursor of compact TiO2. The compact TiO2 layer was prepared by spin coating the precursor solution at 2000 rpm for 60 s, then heated in air at 500 °C for 60 min. Then the TiO2/FTO/glass substrates were transferred into a glove box. Except for the evaporation of the electrode, the following steps are completed in the glove box. The Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 thin film was fabricated according to the previous literature,34 by dissolving FAI (1 M), MABr (0.2 M), PbBr2 (0.2 M), PbI2 (1.1 M) and CsI stock solution (1.5 M in DMSO) in a mixed solution of DMF and DMSO (1:4 v/v). The precursor solution was spin-coated on compact TiO2 substrates at 2000 rpm for 10 s, followed by 6000 rpm for 30 s, respectively, 150 μL of CB was dripped on the substrate 10 s after the start of the second step. The substrates were then heated at 100 °C for 60 min. For the HTM layer, 40 mg SFX-F (SFX-FM or SFX-FP), 9.6 μL lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide (LiTFSI) and 15.9 μL tBP were added to 1 mL chlorobenzene, and the HTM layer was spin-coated on the perovskite layers at 4000 rpm for 30 s. Similarly, the spiro-OMeTAD solution (72.3 mg L−1) with LiTFSI and tBP as additives is also spin-coated by the same method. Finally, the gold electrode is deposited on the hole transport layer by thermal evaporation under vacuum.
Results and discussion
Optical, electrochemical, thermal and hole mobility properties
The UV-vis absorption test and photoluminescence spectra of SFX-F, SFX-FM and SFX-FP in CH2Cl2 are shown in Fig. 2(a) and results are listed in Table 1. All of the SFX-based HTMs show two absorption bands from 250 to 450 nm.35 The first characteristic absorption peaks observed at 351, 355 and 355 nm, respectively, are attributed to the n–π* transition of multi-FPA arms; the second peak observed at 412 nm for both HTMs was attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated system.36 As shown in the PL spectra curves, SFX-F, SFX-FM and SFX-FP exhibit the same emission maximum band at 436 nm, this can be explained by their similar structures and π-conjugated system.28 Notably, there is no significant change in the absorption and emission spectra upon increasing the number and altering the position of FPA groups. Furthermore, as the absorption and fluorescence spectra of SFX-F, SFX-FM and SFX-FP intersect at wavelengths of 423, 421 and 422 nm, respectively, the corresponding optical band gaps (Eopt) are 2.93, 2.96 and 2.94 eV, respectively.37

In order to calculate the molecular orbital levels of SFX-F, SFX-FM, and SFX-FP, the CV curve for each HTM is recorded in 0.1 M TBAPF6 DCM solution (Fig. 2(b)) and the results are presented in Table 1. The redox peaks of three HTMs are both reversible, indicating that these HTMs have good electrochemical stability.38 The HOMO levels of SFX-F, SFX-FM and SFX-FP are −5.22, −5.24 and −5.25 eV, respectively, which matched with the valence band level of Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (−5.6 eV), ensuring sufficient hole extraction capacity. Although the HOMO level of SFX-FM is almost the same as that of SFX-FP, the higher mobility is attributed to the meta-substitution that affects the chemical structure or electron delocalization.29 The low hole mobility of SFX-F may be due to its inability to effectively dope with LiTFSI. In addition, the calculated LUMO energy levels are −2.29, −2.28 and −2.31 eV, respectively.
The thermal properties of organic HTMs are mainly judged by Tg and thermal decomposition temperature (Td, 5% weight loss temperature). The Tg of three HTMs measured by DSC are shown in Fig. 2(c) and tabulated in Table 1. As the number of FPA groups increases and the substitution positions change, the increase of Tg is more pronounced:39,40 108 °C for two branched SFX-F, and 154 and 140 °C for four branched SFX-FM and SFX-FP, respectively. The Tg is related to the rigidity (or flexibility) of the organic molecule and may vary with steric hindrance.41 The relatively low Tg of SFX-F may be due to the rotational freedom of the two-substituted SFX core, which is higher than that of the other two four-substituted cores. SFX-FM has the highest Tg likely because the FPAs substituted at the meta position of the xanthene unit make it have a more dense and rigid structure. Moreover, the high Tg values can inhibit the formation of grain boundaries, which is beneficial for the formation of uniform films and thus for obtaining high-efficiency devices.42 Similar results were obtained in TGA analysis (Fig. S13, ESI†), where the Td of SFX-F is only 287 °C, while those of both SFX-FM and SFX-FP exceed 400 °C with a weight loss of 5% (445 °C for SFX-FM and 438 °C for SFX-FP). The high Td values also indicate that the HTMs with four FPA groups have good thermal stability. Trends in Tg and Td are consistent with the previous research report by Chiykowski et al., that is, Tg and Td are affected by the FPAs on the xanthene unit.
The hole mobility of these doped HTMs are analyzed by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method under dark conditions with a hole-only device based on the FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au structure, and J–V curves are presented in Fig. 2(d). The hole mobilities of SFX-F, SFX-FM and SFX-FP were calculated as 4.59 × 10−5, 1.26 × 10−4 and 7.45 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, increasing the number of FPA arms on the SFX core can improve the hole-transport properties,43 and the highest hole mobility of the SFX-FM should be attributed to its tighter molecular packing, which is favorable for the formation of a dense film. Conversely, the low hole mobility of SFX-F may be related to the poor solubility and rough film, resulting in a decrease in the transport channels.33
Surface topography
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of SFX-F, SFX-FM, and SFX-FP in PSC devices, we prepared and tested a series of PSC devices that consisted of FTO/compact TiO2/Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3/HTMs/Au (Fig. 3(a)), and Fig. 3(b) is the schematic energy level diagram of the PSC. Furthermore, the film-forming properties of SFX-based HTMs were characterized by AFM and SEM measurements. AFM test illustrates that the RMSs of SFX-F, SFX-FM, SFX-FP and spiro-OMeTAD are 5.49, 4.83, 5.36 and 7.00 nm, respectively (Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S14, ESI†). The smoother surface morphology of SFX-based HTMs should be attributed to their perpendicular spiro structure, which can effectively inhibit the intermolecular π–π stacking effect and improve their solubility in aromatic solvents,44 thus forming an excellent amorphous layer.25 The SEM top views (Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S15, ESI†) also display that the SFX-FM films have nearly no pinholes, while the SFX-F and SFX-FP films are covered with pinholes of varying sizes, which means that the SFX-FM exhibits the best solubility in chlorobenzene solvents.45

Solar cell performance

Fig. 5(a) shows the J–V curves obtained from the best-performing devices using these SFX-based HTMs and spiro-OMeTAD. The detailed photovoltaic results are summarized in Table 2. The champion PSC based on SFX-FM demonstrated a PCE of 17.29% with a high Jsc of 22.89 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.11 V, and a FF of 68%. From the device test results, we observed that under the same fabrication conditions, the PSCs adopting SFX-FP and SFX-F as the HTM achieved a PCE of 15.45% and 14.54%, respectively. As a comparison, the reference device based on spiro-OMeTAD achieved a PCE of 15.14% under the same conditions. The relatively better morphology of the SFX-FM film and its higher hole mobility offer the corresponding device a better Jsc and a higher FF value. Moreover, the lower resistance (Rs) and higher shunt resistance (Rsh) are beneficial for achieving higher FF. As shown in Table 2, compared to SFX-F and SFX-FP, the device based on SFX-FM shows the lowest Rs of 48.18 Ω cm2 and the highest Rsh of 27.25 kΩ cm2. From the IPCE spectra (Fig. 5(b)), the integrated current densities of battery devices based on SFX-F, SFX-FM and SFX-FP are 21.62, 21.90 and 22.44 mA cm−2, respectively, which follows the same trend as the Jsc obtained from the J–V test (error values less than 5%). Fig. 5(c) shows the statistical PCE distribution of 15 different PSCs based on SFX-F, SFX-FM, SFX-FP and spiro-OMeTAD, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. The average PCE values are 13.89%, 16.69%, 14.73% and 14.67% for SFX-F, SFX-FM, SFX-FP and spiro-OMeTAD-based devices, respectively. Fig. 5(d) presents the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite and perovskite/HTM films.33 When the perovskite layer is covered with the SFX based HTM, the intensity of the fluorescence emission peak at 760 nm is significantly reduced. The PL intensity reduction ratio after depositing different HTMs showed the following trend: spiro-OMeTAD ≈ SFX-FM > SFX-FP > SFX-F, suggesting that these HTMs can effectively extract photo-generated holes in the perovskite layer,46 and SFX-FM is one of the most efficient hole transporting materials. The water contact angles on the surface of SFX-F, SFX-FM, SFX-FP and spiro-OMeTAD are 97°, 98°, 101° and 90°, respectively (Fig. 6), revealing that SFX-based HTMs have preferable surface hydrophobicity and can effectively prevent moisture from penetrating into the perovskite layer.47,48

Finally, we tested the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells under environmental conditions (humidity ∼ 30%, temperature ∼ 25 °C). Fig. S16 (ESI†) shows that the SFX-based devices have better stability than the device using spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM. After 648 h, the SFX-FM-based PSC retained about 70% of the initial PCE, while the spiro-OMeTAD-based device retained only 36% of the initial PCE.
Conclusions
In summary, we designed and synthesized three SFX-based HTMs with FPA substituents, namely SFX-F, SFX-FM and SFX-FP. Compared with two branched SFX-F, four branched HTMs SFX-FM and SFX-FP have a slightly deeper HOMO energy level, higher Tg, and smoother film surface morphology. Besides, we determined that Tg of HTM is governed by the FPAs on the xanthene unit, Tg of HTM with substitution at the meta-position of the compound (SFX-FM) is 14 °C higher than the para-substitution one (SFX-FP), and 46 °C higher than the unsubstituted one (SFX-F). Due to the suitable HOMO energy level and higher hole mobility, the PSC fabricated with SFX-FM achieved a PCE value of 17.29%, which is higher than those of the analogous devices prepared with SFX-F (14.54%) and SFX-FP (15.45%) and the reference one with spiro-OMeTAD (15.14%) as HTMs. This result will provide a new strategy for designing low-cost, thermally stable hole transporting materials for highly efficient perovskite solar cells.
