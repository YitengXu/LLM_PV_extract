Since finding new CE materials for replacing the state-of-the-art Pt is still challenging, the discovery of low-cost CE materials with superior catalytic activity is of paramount importance. Here, innovative and effective ZnWSe2 alloy CE materials in the amorphous structure are designed with different Zn ratios by the magnetron sputtering route and employed in DSSC applications to overcome the above-mentioned challenges of Pt CE. The formation of an amorphous phase with various Zn contents is further verified using theoretical calculations. Various electrochemical measurements such as cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel demonstrate that the optimum ZnWSe2 (denoted as ZnWSe2-3) alloy-based CE material possesses superior electrocatalytic activity, electrochemical stability, and fast reaction kinetics for an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox pair. Thanks to its low charge transfer resistance, high electrical conductivity, and large surface area, the cell employing ZnWSe2-3 CE reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.27% with enhanced short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) parameters, which are higher than those of DSSCs based on Pt (7.56%), WSe2 (6.35%), and other ZnWSe2-based CEs (6.20 to 7.41%). In addition to its improved photovoltaic (PV) performance, the cell employing ZnWSe2-3 CE exhibits prolonged photostability under operational conditions. This facile and efficient approach provides a promising direction to fabricate high-efficiency and electrochemically stable DSSCs. We thus believe that our work could provide an effective alternative for the design of high-performance and low-cost CE materials for PV applications.
Introduction
Recently, the photovoltaic (PV) industry has focused on high-efficiency and long-term stable PV technologies allowing low-cost fabrication. Hitherto, to meet these criteria, different types of solar cells have evolved. Among the different types, silicon-based solar cells available for real applications, owing to their high efficiency and long operating life, have become a dominant force in the overall PV market.1,2 However, silicon-based solar technologies have a compelling purification process, complex production steps, and require expensive infrastructure.3–5 These challenges have limited this technology from further advancements in efficiency and sustainability goals. Unlike silicon, new-generation technologies, so-called third-generation solar cells, including dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), perovskite solar cells (PSCs), organic solar cells (OPVs), and quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs) have been presented as a promising alternative.6–9
Among these PV technologies, DSSCs are a promising alternative to silicon solar cells in terms of low-cost raw materials, a facile fabrication process, and an extensive repertoire of materials.10,11 Since the first report by O'Regan & Gratzel in 1991, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of DSSCs has increased significantly above 15%. The DSSC industry has embraced a continuous effort in efficiency improvement and increasing attention in research through the engineering of materials, layers, and architectures. A standard DSSC has a sandwich configuration formed by a photoanode, a sensitizing dye, an electrolyte, and a counter electrode (CE).11 The commercialized DSSC architecture utilizes TiO2, ruthenium (Ru) metal complex based N719, iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−), and platin (Pt) as the photoanode, a dye sensitizer, an electrolyte, and a CE, respectively. Thanks to the striking advancements in nanostructured photoanode materials, high-efficiency sensitizers, and robust electrolytes, the performance of DSSCs is becoming more and more competitive in PV technologies.
In a DSSC architecture, the main tasks of a CE are to collect the charges incoming from the external circuit and to diffuse the charge carriers into the liquid electrolyte.12,13 Despite the superior electrocatalytic activity in the I3− reduction reaction and good electrical conductivity, Pt-based CEs have drawbacks such as rarity, high cost, and dissolution issues.14,15 Therefore, the search for new CE materials/designs continues to be an up-to-date research area in DSSC technology. Arguably, one of the emeging routes to reduce the material cost of DSSCs with no sacrifice of catalytic activity of CEs is to alloy Pt with other metals/nonmetals or to replace Pt with Pt-free materials. To this end, many different types of Pt-free CE materials including carbon-based materials, transition metal oxides, chalcogenides, alloys, conducting polymers, and composite materials have been reported so far.16–18
Among these alternative materials, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have emerged as promising materials for state-of-the-art PV devices owing to their unique optoelectronic properties such as superior charge carrier mobility and tunable electronic structures. TMD materials are in the MX2 structure with M representing a transition metal and a chalcogen atom (S, Se, and Te) at the X-site. The X–M–X unit layer is a triatomic layer with a metal atom covalently bonded between two chalcogen atoms. These layers are held together by weak van der Waals interactions.19 They have a high surface-to-volume ratio as well as being cheap and environmentally friendly. They offer plenty of unsaturated surface area and more effective active sites on the surface. Therefore, it can interact more with the surface in contact with.20
From the viewpoint of conventional semiconductor device physics, these unique optoelectronic properties make TMD materials great options for optoelectronic device applications, especially for solar cells, supercapacitors, and sensors.21–23 Amongst the family of TMDs, tungsten diselenide (WSe2) is one of the best-emerging materials used in DSSC applications as CE materials due to its great potential resulting from high earth abundance, d-electron-rich properties, high polarizability, good electrochemical stability, and efficient electro-catalytic activity for I3− reduction.17,24,25 Despite its fascinating properties, inspiring studies have rarely been reported to further improve the properties of the WSe2 material and increase its function in the device structure. In one of these pioneering studies, Jung et al. designed a WSe2/W hybrid structure as a CE, showing a lower charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 1.38 Ω compared to that of the Pt CE (8.66 Ω). Such a facile hybridization design of WSe2/W results in superior electrocatalytic activity associated with smaller cathodic peak potential and fast reaction kinetics for the I−/I3− redox reaction. As a result, the device based on the WSe2/W hybrid CE showed a commensurable PCE of 8.22%, whereas 8.20% PCE is reported for the reference cell based on the Pt CE. In a similar report, the WSe2/MoS2 CE is designed on the FTO substrate using a heterostructure strategy.26 The cell based on the WSe2/MoS2 CE reached a PCE of 8.44% with an outstanding fill factor (FF) of 72.4%, while the Pt-based device presented a PCE of 8.73%. In this study, the improved device performance was attributed to the sharing of plentiful active edge sites and rapid charge transfer associated with the WSe2/MoS2 heterostructure.
As shown in rarely reported WSe2 CE-based studies, WSe2-based TMD materials still need advanced research to meet the requirements of DSSC technology and acquire higher photovoltaic performance with sustainable stability. The alloying approach is another way to further improve the performance of such devices. For optoelectronic devices such as solar cells, it is very important to obtain materials with tunable physical properties. Alloyed semiconductor materials can offer more unique properties than the corresponding fundamental or binary compounds.27
On the one hand, the CE serves as an interface where charge transfer occurs between the electrochemical reactions taking place in the device and the transparent conductive oxide (TCO) electrode. The interface should facilitate rapid electron transfer to and from the TCO electrode, minimizing the resistive losses and promoting efficient charge transport across the electrode–electrolyte interface. Moreover, a strong and reliable interface between the CE and the TCO electrode is necessary to maintain good mechanical stability and adhesion. The high charge transfer resistance at the TCO/CE interface can be significantly reduced by inserting a conductive layer as an interlayer or using a suitable deposition technique allowing good film-forming uniformity and good adherence. In the latter way, the film can be formed on TCO with good compactness and repeatability to serve as an effective transfer bridge in the device architecture. In other words, CE films are well combined with the TCO substrate and thus, lead to an improvement in the PV parameters, especially the short circuit current density (Jsc) and FF. In this study, we designed a WSe2 CE material by alloying it with zinc (Zn) atoms and demonstrated its function as a CE in DSSC applications. The different ratios of Zn atoms have been alloyed in the WSe2 CE material by a versatile and highly controllable magnetron sputtering technique. As is well-known, magnetron sputtering technology allows the formation of films with high purity, good compactness, and good film-forming uniformity. Moreover, the films obtained by sputtering are well combined with the substrate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the ZnWSe2 structure as a CE for PV applications. It is worth noting that the specific motivations for choosing ZnWSe2 can vary depending on the research objectives, desired material properties, and targeted applications. In this study, the main motivation for incorporating Zn in ZnWSe2 lies in its ability to modify the structural and electronic properties of the WSe2 material. By introducing Zn into the WSe2, several important effects can be achieved. For example; (i) ZnWSe2 exhibits alloy-like properties due to the combination of Zn and WSe2. This alloy formation can influence the crystal structure, lattice parameters, and electrical properties. ZnWSe2 alloy can exhibit tunable electrical conductivity depending on the concentration of Zn. This tunability makes ZnWSe2 alloy suitable for applications in electronic devices. (ii) The presence of Zn may also disrupt the crystalline order of the material, resulting in an amorphous phase associated with differences in the atomic size, crystallographic compatibility, or other factors that impede the formation of a regular arrangement of atoms. The disordered atomic structure of amorphous CEs can be engineered to have a high surface area and the increased surface area provides more active sites for electrochemical reactions in catalytic applications, leading to improved charge transfer kinetics at the CE/electrolyte interface and higher photovoltaic performance. The porosity of the amorphous CEs also facilitates the diffusion of electrolyte ions, improving the ion transport and reducing the device resistance, which is beneficial for DSSCs. (iii) ZnWSe2 alloy can possess improved chemical stability compared to pure WSe2, making it more resistant to environmental degradation. Similarly, amorphous materials tend to be more mechanically flexible compared to their crystalline counterparts. This enhanced stability can be beneficial for long-term device performance and reliability. (iv) Furthermore, compared to crystalline CEs, the production of an amorphous ZnWSe2 CE can be more cost-effective, making it attractive for large-scale commercial applications. Overall, the inclusion of Zn in ZnWSe2 alloys offers the potential for tailoring the material's properties to meet the requirements of CE materials in DSSC applications. Such superior optoelectronic properties of the ZnWSe2 alloy may open up a new avenue for the development of CEs for DSSCs in the near future.
Experimental section
Fabrication of ZnWSe2 alloy-based CEs
ZnWSe2 CE films were fabricated using a Vaksis Midas 3M1T magnetron sputtering system. The 3′′ diameter WSe2 target (Plasmaterials) with 99.99% purity and metallic Zn target (Goodwill) with 99.99% purity are placed on magnetrons with 13.56 MHz RF power supplies. Before growth, soda lime glass and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrates are cleaned with soapy water and kept in an ultrasonic cleaner in acetone and 2-propanol (IPA) for 10 min, respectively. After drying with high purity nitrogen (N2), the substrates are placed in the sample holder of the magnetron sputtering system. The system base pressure is decreased to 5 × 10−7 torr, and the holder is gradually heated and set to 350 °C. After waiting for 1 h to ensure the thermal equilibrium of the substrates at this temperature, argon (Ar) gas of 99.999% purity is introduced into the system and the system pressure is increased to 7 × 10−3 torr and plasma is activated. After waiting for 10 min without coating, the shutter is opened, and the growth process is carried out. The growth time of the thin films is 30 min, and the sample holder is rotated at 10 rpm for homogeneous coating during the growth. The growth parameters are shown in Table S1 (ESI†).
Fabrication of the Pt CE
The Pt CE is prepared according to our recent previous work. Briefly, 5 mM chloroplatinic acid hexahydrate as a Pt source is prepared in 2-propanol solution, and then the final mixture is spread uniformly on pre-cleaned FTO substrates by the spin coating technique at 3000 rpm for 20 s following an annealing procedure at 400 °C for 45 min.
Device assembly
Titanium dioxide (TiO2) paste is prepared according to the most common method as reported in our previous studies.10 Paste solution is deposited on pre-cleaned FTO substrates using the doctor blade technique. Deposited TiO2 paste films are gradually annealed at 125 °C for 5 min, 250 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 30 min, respectively. Subsequently, the annealed samples are immersed in 0.5 mM of N719 dye solution at room temperature for 18 h, followed by rinsing with methanol and then drying at room temperature. On the other hand, the I−/I3− redox electrolyte is synthesized by mixing 0.01 M iodine, 0.6 M 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M 4-tert-butylpridine, and 0.1 M lithium iodide hydrate in the 3-methoxypropionitrile solvent. Then, the devices were assembled using clamps and the I−/I3− redox electrolyte was injected into the device assembly with the exposed area of the DSSC being 0.16 cm2.
Measurements and characterization
Thickness measurements of the CE films are carried out using a Filmetrics Profilm3D using optical interference patterns from a 2 mm × 2 mm area. The XRD patterns of the corresponding samples are collected using a GNR ADP Pro 2000 model XRD system with thin-film apparatus using a grazing angle of 1° and Cu K-alpha X-rays at 30 mA and 40 kV potential. Raman analyses are taken with a Renishaw inVia confocal Raman spectroscopy system using a 15 mW laser with a wavelength of 532 nm in the wavenumber range of 115–600 cm−1. Reflectance spectra of the samples are collected using a Shimadzu UV-3600 Plus UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–900 nm. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs of the CEs are taken at 50 kx and 300 kx magnifications using a ZEISS GeminiSEM 500. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements of the CE films are carried out at an 2 × 2 μm−2 area using a Park System (XE-100E). For Current–Voltage (I–V) measurements in the dark, a shadow mask with two cavities of 2.5 mm × 5 mm with a distance of 7 mm between them is placed on each sample and silver is evaporated under high vacuum. I–V measurements are taken using a Keithley 2450 source-meter under light in the range of −3 to 3 V. The electrical conductivity of all CEs is recorded by a four-probe method. electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and Tafel polarization were recorded with an Ivium-compact Stat model potentiostat/galvanostat framework between 0.1 Hz and 1 MHz frequency ranges under dark conditions. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis of all CEs is conducted with an Ivium-compact Stat model potentiostat/galvanostat with a three-electrode setup of 20 mV from −1.0 to 1.0 V potential range (reference electrode is silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl), the CE is Pt wire, and the working electrode is the FTO substrate). The CV stock solution is prepared by mixing 0.1 M lithium perchlorate, 10 mM lithium iodide, and 1 mM iodine in acetonitrile. For photovoltaic measurements, an AAA class Fytronix solar simulator is used as the light source with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A non-reflective metal aperture of 0.16 cm2 is used to define the irradiation area.
Theoretical calculations
Plane-wave based Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the VASP code.28,29 A GGA type Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional is used to describe the exchange–correlation.30 We included dispersion correction to the energy using Grimme's DFT-D3 scheme.31 The projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotential was used for valence–core interactions.32 A kinetic energy cutoff of 300 eV was chosen for the plane wave basis set. A 10−4 eV break was chosen for self-consistent field calculations. A hexagonal lattice of WSe2 with the space-group P63/mmc was considered as the initial host crystal. A 3 × 3 × 2 periodic supercell was considered. Atomic positions and cells were allowed to relax using a conjugate gradient algorithm until all Hellman–Feynman forces are smaller than 0.02 eV Å−1. 4 × 4 × 4 Γ-centered k-point mesh was selected for Brillouin-zone sampling. DFPT was used for phonon calculations.
Formation energies of WSe2 in the presence of Zn were calculated as follows. We usedΔHf = Hi − H0 + nZnμZn + nWμW + nSeμSewhere μZn, μW and μSe are the chemical potentials. nZn, nW and nSe are the numbers of atoms added (or removed) from the reservoir to generate the impurity. For instance, in the case of ZnW formation energy, nZn = −1, nW = +1, and nSe = 0. Under the thermal equilibrium growth conditions, the stable formation of the host material satisfiesμW + 2μSe = ΔHf(WSe2)To avoid the formation of an undesired phase, theμZn + μSe < ΔHf(ZnSe)condition should also be met. Here ΔHf(WSe2) = H(WSe2) − [H(W) + 2H(Se)] and ΔHf(ZnSe) = H(ZnSe) − [H(Zn) + H(Se)]. The bcc phase for W, a monoclinic cell with P3121 for Se and a wurtzite phase for ZnSe is used. With the formation energies at hand, we found energy ranges allowed for the μZn chemical potential to find the μZn dependence of ΔHf.
Results and discussion
Toward the goal of enhancing the efficiency of Pt-free DSSCs, we systematically investigated the effects of CE engineering on the crystal structure, surface morphology, charge recombination, and optoelectronic properties by alloying WSe2 with Zn atoms as a novel CE material. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the WSe2 CE film in Fig. 1a indicates that the WSe2 film is formed in a hexagonal structure with the P63/mmc space group (JCPDF No. 38-1388).33 The strong noise and weak peaks observed in the background of the XRD pattern reveal that the WSe2 film is packed in disorder and low stacking. With the entry of Zn atoms into the structure, the crystal structure deteriorated and evolved into an amorphous structure. The transition from the crystalline structure to an amorphous structure can be explained based on the difference in the atomic radii of the corresponding elements.34 As is well known, amorphous materials are emerging as promising materials for high-performance electronic devices due to their high reflective property, high chemical stability, large density of active edge sites, excellent cycling stability, and fast charging rate, resulting in better electro-catalytic activity and accelerating the charge transfer mechanisms.35–38 Based on the merit, the amorphous materials have been widely studied in supercapacitors, sensors, and batteries; however, works based on CE materials for PV applications are rarely reported.
 Fig. 1  Structural & optical analysis of the CEs: (a) XRD patterns, (b) Raman spectra, and (c) reflectance spectra of WSe2 and ZnWSe2 alloy-based CEs. 
The assessment of patternability attained for WSe2 and ZnWSe2 structures was performed using Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra of WSe2 and ZnWSe2 structures excited using a green laser with a wavelength of 532 nm are demonstrated in Fig. 1b. The characteristic peaks of the WSe2 structure are observed at ∼251 and ∼257 cm−1, which often overlap and behave as a single peak. The peak at ∼251 cm−1 corresponds to the E12g mode (in-plane vibration mode) and the peak at ∼257 cm−1 corresponds to the A1g mode (out-of-plane vibration mode) of the 2H WSe2 structure.39 The fact that the peak observed in the range of 250–260 cm−1 in the spectra has deviated to the right indicates that the A1g mode is more dominant, that is, there is a significant vibration along the vertical layers. The peak observed at approximately 178 cm−1 belongs to the 1T′ structure of WSe2. Based on this information, it can be said that WSe2 hosts two phases at the same time. It is noteworthy that Zn does not interact with Se and is incorporated into the WSe2 matrix to form an alloy of ZnWSe2.
In terms of optical properties, the optical reflection parameter has a key role in CE applications. For this purpose, the optical characterization of the corresponding CE materials was evaluated by reflectance spectroscopy in the range of 200–900 nm. Fig. 1c shows the curves of reflectance spectroscopy measurements. The reflectance of WSe2 and ZnWSe2-1 samples is lower, indicating higher absorption/transmission. With the increase of Zn in the structure, the reflection also increased in the whole spectrum and reached the highest for the ZnWSe2-3 sample. Such an increase in the reflection of ZnWSe2 alloy-based CEs is evaluated as beneficial for light-harvesting within the solar cells. For example, higher reflectance in DSSCs is an important phenomenon, especially for the increase of the Jsc parameter of devices.40
Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations revealed that Zn ions can be located in the WSe2 material in 3 different ways (see also, Fig. 2a and b). Zn ions can settle in the interstitial position (interstitial Zni), in the Se site (anti-site ZnSe) and in the W site (anti-site ZnW). By analyzing the formation energies (see Fig. 2c) of each case, we found that in the case of rich Zn growth, the Zni interstitial becomes the dominant location, and in the case of poor Zn growth, the ZnW anti-site location is dominant. The ZnSe anti-site location is only stable for some moderate Zn growth. As shown in Fig. 2d, we systematically inserted Zn ions into WSe2 and directly calculated the formation energies. We found that WSe2 becomes progressively unstable with an increase in the Zn content, which is consistent with the formation of a ZnWSe2 amorphous phase observed in our experiments. Fig. 2e shows the DFT calculated band-resolved phonon spectra of WSe2, in which acoustic modes at low and optical modes at high frequencies are clearly visible. We observed no negative frequencies, indicating that WSe2 is vibrationally stable. Dense phonon lines near ∼250–300 cm−1 and 100–150 cm−1 are consistent with the positions of the Raman peaks shown in Fig. 1b. Fig. 2f presents the total phonon density of states (pDOS) of Zn free WSe2 and Zni and ZnW occupied WSe2. Fig. 2g shows the phonon modes at some selected frequencies. The strong frequency of Zn free WSe2 at 275 cm−1 is due to out-of-plane longitudinal optical vibrations. Interstitial Zni causes a vague down-shift in pDOS at ∼250–300 cm−1 (namely, a shift from ∼275 cm−1 to ∼250cm−1), most likely due to the suppression of the longitudinal optical (LO) modes. A relatively strong peak at around ∼250 cm−1 for ZnW, as shown in Fig. 2f, is due to the in-plane longitudinal optical modes. In addition, the ZnW anti-site case led to broad negative frequencies indicating that ZnW causes vibrational instability.

The rapid change in the crystal structure also leads to a rapid change in the thickness and surface morphology of the CE films. The change in the film thickness is presented by optical profilometer results (Fig. S1, ESI†). The optical profilometer images of WSe2 CE showed a thickness of 0.62 μm whereas a similar thickness in the range of 0.35–0.43 μm is obtained for ZnWSe2 alloy-based CEs. The difference in the thickness of WSe2 and ZnWSe2 films can be attributed to a change in the morphology. The field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) micrographs of WSe2 and ZnWSe2-based thin films at different magnifications are shown in Fig. 3. In correlation with XRD patterns, vertically grown nanosheets can be seen in the pristine WSe2 sample (Fig. 3a). For the ZnWSe2-1 sample, nanosheet structures began to deteriorate with the introduction of a low amount of Zn atoms into the structure (Fig. 3b). With the increase of Zn (ZnWSe2-2, ZnWSe2-3, and ZnWSe2-4), the nanosheet structures on the surface completely disappeared and turned to a grain structure having a larger specific surface area, allowing the electrolyte to find more active sites for redox reactions.41 The radical change in the surface morphology is further shown by atomic force microscopy (AFM) images with lower roughness with the inclusion of Zn (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). Moreover, a slight decrease was observed for the amounts of W and Se in the EDX spectra (Fig. S4, ESI†), while a rapid increase was observed in the amount of Zn with the introduction of Zn into the structure. To evaluate the distribution of Zn in the WSe2 structure, EDX-mapping analysis is also carried out and displayed in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The EDX-mapping results display that Zn atoms are homogeneously spread in the WSe2 matrix. This homogeneous distribution of the Zn atoms is of great importance in terms of CE performance, revealing an efficient charge transfer and high electro-catalytic activity.

To assess the electrochemical properties of the ZnWSe2 CEs, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance (EIS), and Tafel polarization analyses were performed. The CV technique is a reliable analysis to examine the electro-catalytic activity towards the redox process and charge transfer mechanism of the CEs. The key electrochemical parameters of the CE materials such as anodic peak current density (Jox), cathodic peak current density (Jred), and peak-to-peak separation potential (ΔEpp) are obtained from CV measurements to assess the electrochemical behavior of the CE materials. The smaller ΔEpp value and higher peak current density values point out better electro-catalytic activity and faster reduction toward the triiodide. The CV results are shown in Fig. 4a and b and the obtained parameters are summarized in Table 1. Among the ZnWSe2-based CEs, the ZnWSe2-3 CE displayed a highest Jox value of 2.55 mA cm−2 and a highest Jred value of 1.53 mA cm−2 compared to Pt, WSe2, and other ZnWSe2-based CEs, displaying the best electro-catalytic activity in this study. The best electro-catalytic activity of the ZnWSe2-3 CE can be attributed to the fast reaction kinetic phenomenon from an external circuit to an iodide-based electrolyte associated with enhanced electrical conductivity with an optimum Zn ratio. Similarly, the ZnWSe2-3 CE demonstrated the lowest ΔEpp value indicating a higher electrochemical rate constant and lower over-potential loss.42,43 Such superior electrocatalytic behavior of the ZnWSe2-3 CE can be ascribed to the high number of active edges through its more efficient interface.26,44 On the other hand, the Pt-based CE shows a higher ΔEpp value as compared to the ZnWSe2-based CE which can be attributed to the higher overpotential losses caused by the thickness and/or adhesion ability of the CE materials.45,46 The electrochemical stability and reversibility of the CE are also important aspects of long-term operational stability. Hence, we performed successive multiple CV tests at a sweep rate of 40mVs−1 to compare the Pt reference CE with the ZnWSe2-3 CE. Fig. 4c displays 50 successive multi-cycle CV scans of the Pt CE with the potential ranging from −1.0 to 1.0 V, while Fig. 4d shows the successive multiple CV curves of the ZnWSe2-3 CE under the same conditions. Fig. 4c shows that the current of the Pt-based CE decreased with each cycle, indicating low electrochemical stability against iodide-based electrolytes due to the dissolution of Pt films and formation of PtI4.47–49 On the other hand, the multi-cycle CV curves of the ZnWSe2-3 CE were not noticeably changed (Fig. 4d), indicating outstanding electrochemical stability, reversible redox activity, and strong adhesion to the FTO substrate.50–52

In terms of the charge transfer mechanism, internal resistance and charge kinetics can be estimated from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements. Fig. 5a shows semicircles for Pt and WSe2-based devices and the obtained critical parameters are summarized in Table 1. The calculated series resistance (RS) value (which can be generally estimated from the intercept on the real axis in the high-frequency region of the Nyquist plot) of Pt/FTO is 16.6 Ω, while the RS values of WSe2/FTO vary from 9.1 to 75.8 Ω. As can be seen in Table 1, the RS value of ZnWSe2-3 is lower than those of other CEs, indicating that ZnWSe2-3 can provide better electrocatalytic activity and an efficient charge transfer pathway.53 Furthermore, the RS value directly affects device parameters such as the Jsc and FF due to better adhesion and enhanced contact behaviour between the FTO and coated CEs with low ohmic resistance, thus enhancing the device performance. On the other hand, charge transfer resistance (Rct) values obtained from the left-hand semicircle at a high frequency were determined to be 138.3, 146.5, 121.3, 64.6, 74.1, and 51.8 Ω for the WSe2, ZnWSe2-1, ZnWSe2-2, ZnWSe2-3, ZnWSe2-4, and Pt CEs, respectively. Whereas, the incorporation of the Zn ratio to the structure of the WSe2 semiconductor provides more electrocatalytic sites for the triiodide reduction reaction and the resultant effective electrocatalytic activity with a better charge transfer mechanism.54,55 Fig. 5b presents the Tafel polarization curves of all devices. Tafel curves provide limiting current density (Jlim) and exchange current density (J0) parameters, which give us clues in the determination of the electrocatalytic activity of CEs.56,57 From Fig. 5b, both Jlim and J0 values followed the order of ZnWSe2-3 > Pt > ZnWSe2-2 > ZnWSe2-1 > ZnWSe2-4 > WSe2. Tafel curves confirm that the ZnWSe2-3 alloy CE material is more suitable for I−/I3− redox couples. The Tafel polarization curves are consistent with the EIS and CV results.

After evaluating the effects of Zn incorporation in the CE properties, the performance of ZnWSe2 CEs in DSSC applications is investigated by PV measurements. Fig. 5c exhibits the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices based on WSe2, ZnWSe2-1, ZnWSe2-2, ZnWSe2-3, ZnWSe2-4 CEs, and Pt CEs. The J–V characteristics of the devices were conducted via a source-meter and all the measurements were implemented under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a solar simulator with an aperture area of 0.16 cm2. Photovoltaic parameters such as Jsc, Voc and FF derived from J–V curves are summarized in Table 2. All photovoltaic parameters improved as the Zn ratio increased up to 1:3 W, and it declined to the 1:4 W Zn ratio. As presented in Fig. 5c and Table 2, the best WSe2 CE-based control device shows a PCE of 6.35% with a Jsc of 14.55 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.652 V and FF of 0.67. When the Zn concentration increased from 0 to 1:4 (in terms of the power ratio), the Jsc and FF significantly improved, resulting in the highest PCE of 8.27% with a Jsc of 16.88 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.671 V and FF of 0.73. The PCE declined when the Zn concentration is further increased (ZnWSe2-4 CE), which is probably due to the low conductivity and poor electro-catalytic activity of the CE layer. In addition, the photovoltaic parameters of the Pt CE-based control device are also measured. In line with the studies in similar architecture, the best Pt CE-based control device delivers a PCE of 7.56%. The inclusion of Zn in the WSe2 structure mainly improved the Jsc value due to the enhanced electrocatalytic activity with abundant electrocatalytic sites as observed from CV measurements (Fig. 4b) and the effective charge transfer mechanism with an increase in electrical conductivity as observed from four-probe measurements (Fig. S6, ESI†).58,59 Similarly, the increase in the FF parameter can be ascribed to the reduced Rct value in corresponding CEs as shown by EIS measurements (Fig. 5a). Lowering the Rct value reflects the low recombination and thus improves the PCE of the corresponding devices.60,61 At a Zn ratio greater than 1:3 W, the device parameters remarkably decreased. In the case of excessive Zn atoms, the loss of its electro-catalytic behavior associated with the damage of the WSe2 structure and the decrease in electrical conductivity limit its function as a CE. The repeatability of the DSSC is also investigated via individual cells employing the ZnWSe2-3 CE (10 cells) and the Pt CE (8 cells). As shown in Fig. 5d, the average PCE of 8.13 ± 0.10% for the ZnWSe2-3 CE-based device is higher than that of 7.53 ± 0.11% for the Pt CE-based control device. Note that, from the histograms of individual devices, good reproducibility was obtained from the parameter distribution with a fairly narrow distribution (Fig. S7, ESI†).

We further investigated the time dependent PCE of the Pt and ZnWSe2-3 CE-based cells by monitoring their power output under continuous AM 1.5 G irradiation (Fig. 5e and f). For the Pt-based cell, the rate of rapid decline in the stable power output (SPO) value indicated a severe deterioration in the power output of the Pt CE-based devices. In contrast, a highly stable SPO was achieved for the ZnWSe2-3 CE-based cell by retaining over ∼96% of its initial PCE after 600 s, pointing to remarkable photostability. This can be ascribed to superior electrochemical stability. Similar to the SPO curves, the device with the ZnWSe2-3 CE exhibited no apparent change in the Jsc and Voc parameters as shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†).
In addition to the CV stability test and SPO curves, the chemical interaction of ZnWSe2 CEs with the electrolyte solution is further evaluated by top-view FESEM micrographs. Bare and ZnWSe2-3-based CEs were immersed in an electrolyte solution and FESEM images were taken after 120 h. Before taking FESEM images, the immersed films were cleaned with a solvent and dried using dry air. As given in Fig. S9 (ESI†), there is no significant change in the surface morphology of the CEs after electrolyte immersion, showing the chemical robustness of ZnWSe2 CEs.
Conclusions
In the present work, we successfully prepared amorphous ZnWSe2 alloys by the magnetron sputtering route with different ratios of Zn atoms and applied them as CEs for DSSCs. While theoretical calculations demonstrated the formation of an amorphous phase with various Zn contents, different electrochemical measurements were carried out to state the catalytic activity of the novel CE materials. These electrochemical results showed clearly that ZnWSe2 alloys are efficient catalyst materials for the redox pair of I−/I3−. The DSSC employing the ZnWSe2-3 CE shows a PCE of 8.27%, which is higher than the device employing Pt (7.56%) and WSe2 (6.35%) as well as other ZnWSe2-based CEs (6.90 to 7.41%). More importantly, the ZnWSe2-3-based CE material exhibits high electrochemical stability and photostability behavior in the iodide-based electrolyte solution under different test conditions compared to the state-of-the-art Pt CE. These results showed that ZnWSe2-based alloy CEs could be an effective alternative for solving the stability problem of Pt CE-based DSSCs for high-performance photovoltaics.
