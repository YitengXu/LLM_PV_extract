    , Accepted 19th April 2018First published on 19th April 2018AbstractDi-branched dyes based on a triphenylamino (TPA) donor core have been functionalized with different aromatic and heteroaromatic peripheral groups bonded to TPA as auxiliary donors and investigated as sensitizers in DSSC. The different aromatic and heteroaromatic substitution significantly perturbed the optical properties of the dyes compared to the unsubstituted TPA reference dye, in turn leading to enhanced photovoltaic performances in terms of photocurrent, photovoltage, and power conversion efficiency (PCE). The enhancement originated from improved strategic interface interactions between the dye-sensitized titania and the liquid electrolyte, as ascertained by current–voltage, quantum efficiency (IPCE), light harvesting properties (LHE), and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies.
Introduction
Since the pioneering report in 1991 by Grätzel and co-workers, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been receiving increasing interest due to their relatively high efficiency and low-cost fabrication.1,2 The dye-photosensitizer plays a strategic role in providing electron injection into the conduction band (CB) of TiO2, upon light irradiation from the sun. The overall photoelectric power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of DSSCs, sensitised by metal complexes, have exceeded 12% at 1 sun irradiation intensity.3 However, the limitations concerning these complexes, such as rare sources, heavy-metal toxicity and environmental issues, necessarily limit their broad application. In recent years, metal-free organic chromophores have been extensively investigated as alternative sensitizers to transition metal-complexes due to their high molar extinction coefficients, ease of structure tailoring, as well as low-cost synthesis processes, and compliance with environmental issues.4 To date, hundreds of organic dyes have been explored to act as sensitizers for DSSCs and remarkable efficiencies, of over 14%, have been obtained.1,5–10 Organic dyes possessing a rod-like configuration with the electron-donating and electron-accepting groups, bridged by a π-spacer molecular system, are the most used. The most common donor moiety is a triphenylamine (TPA) derivative.11,12 This donor scaffold has been widely used in the synthesis of sensitizers, commonly bearing a long terminal alkoxy chain on the peripheral phenyl rings13 to reduce detrimental charge recombination or to enhance electron donation capabilities. Other strategies to reduce the detrimental effect of recombination have been exploited, and the use of bulky donor groups has recently been reviewed.14 Zhou and co-workers have recently reported a molecular design aimed at enhancing charge separation and improving the electron lifetime and the injection efficiency.15 A few years ago, we have proposed an innovative new molecular architecture for metal-free organic dyes based on a multi-branched geometry.9 In that first report, we demonstrated that the new molecular architecture provides enhanced photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer, device photocurrent, and stability under light and thermal stress. Furthermore, the photophysical properties of the multi-branched dyes can be widely tuned upon varying the donor, spacer, and acceptor moieties; therefore, following our first report, a significant number of studies has been reported on DSSC multi-branched dyes as sensitizers, showing the multiple advantages of this architecture. One of the most attractive reported feature is the ability to show similar PCEs in both liquid and solid-state devices, unlike what occurs in the conventional linear geometry.16 The most representative multi-branched structures, reported in the literature, and their studies in DSSC have been recently reviewed.17
Based on our previous work we decided to modify the specific structural characteristics of di-branched dyes, mainly aimed at improving the critical interface between dye-decorated TiO2 and the liquid electrolyte, for designing a sensitizer class able to provide high performances also in large area DSSCs. Indeed, the electron recombination from TiO2 to the oxidised form of the electrolyte represents one of the major drawbacks of the present device architecture and is responsible for the lower photovoltage, fill factor and, eventually, PCE.18–22 Electron recombination is conveniently investigated via Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), which is able to determine the recombination resistance between TiO2 and the electrolyte, in addition to the other parameters related to the electron lifetime in the semiconductor.23–25 One of the most effective strategies to limit charge recombination is to make the approach of the liquid electrolyte to the semiconductor surface more difficult by chemical modification of the dye.
Here we present a new family of DSSC di-branched sensitizers where the terminal donor TPA core has been functionalized with a (hetero)aromatic substituent (Ar) to affect the electrolyte–TiO2 interaction. We have selected thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) as a spacer previously used in efficient DSSC sensitizers,13 and the conventional cyanoacrylic acid as double anchoring points.

Fig. 1 depicts the general design of the series Ar-TPA-[TT-anchoring]2 investigated in this work. As our study focuses on the fundamental understanding of dye working principles, with no aspiration of obtaining high photovoltaic (PV) efficiencies, DSSCs are realized with the aim of simplifying the architecture and, therefore, the study of the interface phenomena: PCE up to 6.3% have been reached in conventional liquid iodine-based cells, based on a transparent TiO2 monolayer and drop-casted Pt counter electrode.

Results and discussion
Design and synthesis
Following the introduced general design strategy of Fig. 1, we have investigated the new dyes TT-b-01–TT-b-03. With the aim of investigating peripheral substitution, pristine derivative TT-b-00 has been also prepared and characterized as a reference dye (Fig. 2). The TPA moiety of TT-b-00 has been functionalized with thiophene-based substituents in TT-b-01 and TT-b-02 and with a benzene derivative in TT-b-03. The thiophene rings in TT-b-01 and TT-b-02 were further modified, according to the literature, with the introduction of a n-hexyl chain in the terminal free α-positions, in order to minimize charge recombination.26–28 We selected 2,4-bis-hexyloxybenzene as a benzene derivative in TT-b-03. This group has been demonstrated to be an efficient surface protector via steric hindrance, regardless of the presence of co-adsorbents during dye adsorption on the semiconductor surface.16 Both the alkylthiophene and the bis-alkoxybenzene moieties allow further extension of the molecular π-framework and provide an auxiliary electron-rich donor contribution, so as to enforce the electron-donating ability of the terminal moiety. These features can be exploited to enhance optical and electronic properties of the dyes, by improving the light-harvesting abilities and better promoting the photo-induced intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) step preceding electron injection to TiO2. The choice of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene as a π-spacer was justified by an optimal trade-off between PV efficiency, as suggested by the literature,13 and ease of synthesis.

TT-b dyes investigated in this work. 
The reference dye TT-b-00 has been synthesized according to Scheme 1. 4,4′-Dibromotriphenylamine (1)29 has been submitted to a Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane30 in the presence of a Pd(II) catalyst and a base to give the bis-thieno[3,2-b]thiophene branched intermediate 2. Formylation under Vilsmeier–Haack conditions led to the key intermediate bis-aldehyde 3, as a pure product, in moderate yields after precipitation from the crude reaction mixture. This compound is sparingly soluble in common organic solvent. Final condensation with cyanoacetic acid afforded the reference compound TT-b-00 in good yields and, in contrast to its precursor, the final product is endowed with good solubility properties.

The synthetic access to the dyes TT-b-01–TT-b-03 implies the use of the common TPA intermediate 3, followed by the peripheral functionalization of TPA with the aromatic substituent, via a bromo-derivative 4, and the final insertion of the electron-withdrawing-anchoring group (Scheme 2). The Suzuki–Miyaura coupling has been again selected as a convenient, sustainable and up-scalable method to introduce the different aromatic and heteroaromatic end-groups. In the case of the thiophene-based derivatives, the boronic esters were commercially available. The appropriate boronic ester for the insertion of the 2,4-dihexyloxyphenyl substituent has been prepared according to the literature.31 Once the derivatized bis-aldehydes 5a–c has been obtained, the final condensation, similarly to the reference dye, afforded the desired products.

Optical and electrochemical characterization
The optical characterizations of the dyes TT-b-00–TT-b-03 were performed in 10−5 M EtOH solutions (Fig. 3) and as sensitized 2.5 μm TiO2 films (Fig. S1, ESI†). All of the relevant values are collected in Table 1. The dyes showed a typical pattern of donor–acceptor chromophores, with an intense ICT absorption band in the Vis region.

The introduction of the auxiliary aromatic electron-rich fragments on the donor TPA moiety led to a substantial qualitative and quantitative enhancement of the optical properties compared to the reference TT-b-00. A bathochromic effect has been observed moving from the unsubstituted derivative to TT-b-01 and TT-b-02. A stronger effect was recorded upon insertion of the 2,4-dialkoxyphenyl group, with a red shift of more than 20 nm. A similar behaviour upon derivatization of TT-b-00 has been observed in the trend of the molar absorptivity. The hyperchromic effect induced by the aromatic substitution of the TPA core increased the ε value from 44000 to over 60000 M−1 cm−1 in the 2,4-dihexyloxyphenyl derivative TT-b-03, corresponding to an enhancement of nearly 50%. Notably neither a bathochromic nor a hyperchromic effect has been observed upon increasing the number of thienyl rings of the aromatic terminal substituent, with the only marginal difference residing in the pattern at higher energies, likely due to local transitions.
A similar discussion can be extended to the analysis of the normalized absorption spectra of the sensitized TiO2 films. In particular the spectra of the three new dyes are similar and significantly red-shifted compared to the unsubstituted dye TT-b-00. Accordingly, the absorption onsets extend up to the near IR region (∼850 nm), that is at much lower wavelengths compared to the reference dye (onset at ∼700 nm). Therefore, we can conclude that both the solution and film optical properties suggest a higher light harvesting efficiency and, eventually, device photocurrent of the devices sensitized by the new dyes.
The emission spectra have been qualitatively determined and illustrated in comparison with the absorption properties in Fig. S2 (see ESI†). The zeroth–zeroth transition energies (E0–0) have been estimated from the intercept of the normalised absorption and emission spectra in the same solvent and the values collected in Table 1.
Saturated solutions of TT-b dyes in DMF (<10−4 M) were used for the electrochemical characterization by dissolving each compound in the supporting electrolyte (0.1 M TBABF4). The main electrochemical and energetic parameters have been collected in Table 1. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) study (Fig. S3, ESI†) showed an irreversible behavior at oxidative potentials (potential > 0 V) for all the dyes due to precipitation of the oxidized compounds. The HOMO/LUMO energies referred to vacuum,32 are pictorially depicted in Fig. 4 as well as the energy level of the CB of TiO2.33
 Fig. 4  Scheme of the energy levels of the investigated dyes compared to the CB of TiO2. 
The oxidative processes showed a first oxidation wave spanning from 200 to 310 mV vs. Fc/Fc+. In general, the presence of the different thienyl or phenyl ring substituents on the triarylamino donor core did not significantly affect the oxidation potential of the dyes. Accordingly, the HOMO energy levels were almost similar in the TT-b series. The LUMO energies were calculated from the electrochemical HOMO energies by using the optical bandgaps, as measured as onset energies by means of the Tauc plot.34
Photovoltaic investigation
To better compare the PV properties of the new dyes, we have employed TT-b-00–TT-b-03 as sensitizers in single layer DSSCs. By using a single transparent semiconductor layer only one titania interface is present, simplifying the interface phenomena. Furthermore, without the opaque scattering layer, the complete optical and electrochemical characterization could be performed on the same devices used for PV investigation. However, it should be noted that the absence of a scattering layer does not allow reaching optimal photocurrent values and thus the obtained PCEs should be considered as minimal values with respect to full optimization, which was not the main scope of this work.2,35
DSSCs were fabricated using a screen-printed transparent 9 μm monolayer film consisting of 20 nm TiO2 particles (Dyesol 18NR-T). The active area of the device was 0.20 cm.2 The PV response of the devices has been investigated by varying the amount of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as a de-aggregating co-adsorbent agent in the sensitizer solution,36 finding that the most favourable results are obtained by using an equimolar amount of dye and CDCA (Table S1, see ESI†). The best average PCE were measured using the electrolyte Z960 (1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.50 M 4-t-butylpyridine in acetonitrile/valeronitrile 85:15).37 The main PV parameters of the new dyes are listed in Table 2 together with those of the reference benchmark dye N719, used as a sensitizer in the control device. PV measurements of DSSCs were carried out with a black metal mask with an aperture area of 0.28 cm2 to avoid current overestimation due to multiple irradiation.38 The overall conversion efficiencies PCE were derived from the equation: PCE = Jsc × Voc × FF, where Jsc is the short circuit current density, Voc the open circuit voltage, and FF the fill factor.

Fig. 5 shows the photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs. The control N719-sensitized device guaranteed the reliability of the production process, with its PCE agreeing with best routine literature values based on monolayer cells.

The effect of the substitution on the donor TPA moiety is evident. The measured photocurrent values are larger for TT-b-01–TT-b-03 compared to TT-b-00, in agreement with the superior optical properties of the former dyes. The highest values have been measured for the bithienyl derivatives, TT-b-02 showing a current even larger than that of the device based on N719. The photovoltages are similar for all the devices and lower than that of the N719-based cell. The good current value for TT-b-02 led to a PCE larger than 6%, which is mid-high ranked in the literature for a DSSC based on a single TiO2 layer35 and very close to the control N719 device, compared to which the PCE is only ∼15% less intense. The stability of the PV properties of the devices were evaluated by measuring PV characteristics for up to 7 days of ageing in the dark (Table S2, ESI†). The data revealed a good short-term stability for all of the devices, in particular for those sensitized by TT-b-01 and TT-b-02, for which the PCE was unvaried compared to the values recorded after 3 and 24 h from preparation. Only in the case of the TT-b-03 device has a minimal drop of ∼5% been recorded after one week. The lower PCE originates from the lower photocurrent, with photovoltage and fill factor values remaining unvaried compared to the corresponding initial values. This might be ascribed to the partial, yet limited, desorption or degradation of the dye, possibly due to non-optimal device sealing from moisture or air.
The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE, 0–100%) of the investigated DSSCs are shown in Fig. 6. The IPCE data agree with the current/voltage measurements. The TT-b-02 device showed the most intense external quantum efficiency, with a maximum value of ∼90% in the 500–550 nm region.
 Fig. 6  IPCE of DSSCs sensitised by TT-b-00–TT-b-03. 
For a more detailed understanding of the different PV performances registered for the phenyl- and thienyl-modified derivatives, we have separately examined the two constituting factors of IPCE, per the equation IPCE(λ) = LHE(λ) × APCE(λ) (Fig. 7). LHE (0–100%) is the light-harvesting efficiency and is associated with the ability of the cell to harvest light. APCE (0–100%) is the absorbed monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency and gives the internal quantum efficiency of the cell in generating electric current, being related to the electron injection efficiency from the dye to the semiconductor oxide, the dye regeneration efficiency, and the charge collection efficiency.39,40 IPCE and LHE (LHE = 1–10−Abs) are experimentally determined. APCE is thus derived by dividing the IPCE number by LHE. LHE, and indirectly APCE, can be measured only for transparent dye-coated films, as similarly performed for previous representative studies,3,41–44 since scattering layers do not allow the use of quantitative absorption spectroscopy.
 Fig. 7  LHE and APCE (inset) of the photoanodes sensitised by TT-b-01–TT-b-03. 
In this respect, we justify our choice to use here single layer devices that, while not being associated with optimum PCE, allow us to study in detail the devices in all their most important components and effectively complete the comparative design study for the different sensitizers. Fig. 7 shows the LHE spectra of the sensitized photoanodes in the TT-b-01–TT-b-03 based DSSCs. The comparison between the three dyes clearly shows how the thienyl based devices have a higher light harvesting ability than that of the phenyl derivative, despite the latter dye presenting in solution the best optical properties. Therefore, the absorption investigation in the device, LHE, fully justifies the higher value of the photocurrent observed for the compound TT-b-02. It is evident that APCE (inset of Fig. 7) is excellent for almost the entire range of visible light. TT-b-02 extends the range of the maximum performance compared to TT-b-01. The best combined performance of electron injection, dye regeneration, and charge collection efficiency has been recorded for TT-b-03, as confirmed by the best cell FF (Table 2). Finally, the high APCE of TT-b-03 around 600–650 nm is the direct consequence of a similar external quantum efficiency (IPCE) compared to the other dyes but a weaker LHE in the specific region. Therefore, we conclude that the TT-b-03 sensitized device is still efficient around 600–650 nm due to the higher internal quantum efficiency, despite its weaker light harvesting. Therefore, the phenyl derivative is the most efficient dye in terms of the conversion efficiency of the absorbed photons. Unfortunately, the lower light harvesting efficiency negatively counterbalances this performance decreasing the cell current and, eventually, device PCE.
For a more detailed comparative investigation, we decided to use EIS and focus attention on the charge recombination phenomena.23–25 In this experiment, a small sinusoidal voltage stimulus of a fixed frequency is applied to an electrochemical cell and its current response measured. The behaviour of an electrochemical system can be investigated by sweeping the frequency over several orders of magnitude (generally from a few mHz to several MHz). The analysis of the impedance spectra was performed in terms of Nyquist plots (Fig. 8), where the imaginary part of the impedance is plotted as a function of the real part of the range of frequencies. Under soft illumination (0.25 sun), at open circuit voltage conditions, the properties of the sensitized TiO2/electrolyte interface can be derived from the Nyquist plot in terms of the recombination resistance (Rrec) and chemical capacitance (Cμ), which have been obtained by fitting the data with the equivalent circuit reported in the inset of the figure. The apparent electron lifetime τn can be calculated from τn = Rrec × Cμ.23,45 The results of the EIS investigation are summarised in Table 3. These data reveal that corresponding capacitances, which probe the charge carrier accumulation in the TiO2 film and the density of states in the band gap, resulted in being identical for all the dyes.

As previously reported,46 minor changes of the chemical structure, which can affect the performance of the device despite the unvaried optical properties, suggest that the effect on the recombination resistance is more important than that on the capacitance.
Indeed, TT-b-01 and TT-b-02 have been found to be optically almost equivalent, both in solution and when adsorbed on titania, meanwhile TT-b-03 shows a poor light harvesting capability when it is anchored on the titania substrate, even if it shows the longest electron lifetime. TT-b-01 and TT-b-03 based devices afforded similar photovoltages, since this depends on the saturation current density, associated with the charge recombination, and on the photogenerated current.47 Dye TT-b-01 shows a higher current and a lower Rrec, whereas TT-b-03 shows a lower generated current and a higher Rrec. The good recombination resistance and the high light harvesting efficiency of the TT-b-02 device justify the higher PV response.
This trend supports an effective suppression of the back reaction of the injected electrons with the electrolyte for TT-b-02 and an excellent energy harvesting, which leads to a larger photocurrent and photovoltage23,24 and, accordingly, to the best PCE of the series.
Conclusions
In summary, we synthesised a new series of di-branched dyes based on a TPA donor core functionalized with different peripheral auxiliary donor groups. The new dyes were investigated as sensitizers in DSSCs. We focused on the effect of the peripheral groups bonded to TPA: we found a more effective suppression of the back reaction involving the injected electrons and the electrolyte for the two thienyl derivatives, thus suggesting an enhanced photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer.
The superior performance showed by the TT-b-02 dye, supported by current–voltage, IPCE, LHE, and EIS data, arises from an improved interface interaction between the dye-sensitized TiO2 and the liquid electrolyte. We thus believe that the new dyes might provide an important design strategy to improve general performances in large area DSSCs of industrial relevance, a sector where the critical interface between the optically active layer and the electrolyte is still a challenging issue.
Experimental section
Materials and methods
NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker AMX-500 spectrometer operating at 500.13 MHz (1H) and 125.77 MHz (13C). Coupling constants are given in Hz. Absorption spectra were recorded with a V-570 Jasco spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were recorded with a FP-6200 Jasco spectrofluorometer. Flash chromatography was performed with Merck grade 9385 silica gel 230–400 mesh (60 Å). The reactions performed under an inert atmosphere were done in oven-dried glassware and a nitrogen atmosphere was generated with the Schlenk technique. Conversion was monitored by thin-layer chromatography by using UV light (254 and 365 nm) as a visualizing agent. All reagents were obtained from commercial suppliers at the highest purity grade and used without further purification. Anhydrous solvents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Extracts were dried with Na2SO4 and filtered before removal of the solvent by evaporation. 4,4′-Dibromotriphenylamine and 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane have been synthesized according to literature.29,30
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out at scan rate of 100 mV s−1, using a PARSTA2273 potentiostat in a three-electrode electrochemical cell under Ar. The working, counter, and the pseudo-reference electrodes were a glassy carbon pin, a Pt wire and an Ag/AgCl wire, respectively. The working electrodes discs were well polished with an alumina 0.1 μm suspension. The Pt wire was sonicated for 15 min in deionized water, washed with 2-propanol, and cycled for 50 times in 0.5 M H2SO4 before use. The Ag/AgCl pseudo-reference electrode was calibrated, by adding ferrocene (10−3 M) to the test solution after each measurement.
The following materials were purchased from commercial suppliers: FTO-coated glass plates (2.2 mm thick; sheet resistance ∼7 ohm per square; Solaronix); Dyesol 18NR-T transparent TiO2 blend of active 20 nm anatase particles; N719 (Sigma-Aldrich). UV–O3 treatment was performed using the Novascan PSD Pro Series – Digital UV Ozone System. The thickness of the layers was measured by means of a VEECO Dektak 8 Stylus Profiler. PV measurements of DSSCs were carried out with an antireflective layer and with a black metal mask on top of the photoanode of 0.28 cm2 surface area under a 500 W Xenon light source (ABET Technologies Sun 2000 class ABA Solar Simulator). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to AM 1.5 (100 mW cm−2) using a reference Si cell photodiode equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG-5, Schott) to reduce the mismatch in the region of 350–750 nm between the simulated light and the AM 1.5 spectrum. Values were recorded after 3 and 24 h, and 7 days of ageing in the dark. I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley digital source meter. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) were recorded as a function of excitation wavelength by using a monochromator (Omni 300 LOT ORIEL) with single grating in Czerny–Turner optical design, in AC mode with a chopping frequency of 1 Hz and a bias of blue light (0.3 sun). Absorption spectra were recorded on a V-570 Jasco spectrophotomer. EIS spectra were obtained using an Eg&G PARSTAT 2263 galvanostat potentiostat. The measurements have been performed in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz under AC stimulus with 10 mV of amplitude and no applied voltage bias. The obtained Nyquist plots have been fitted via a non-linear least square procedure using the equivalent circuit model depicted in the inset of the plot itself.
Synthesis

Phenyl-bis-(4-thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl-phenyl)-amine, 2. 
Bis-(4-bromo-phenyl)-phenyl-amine (2.0 g, 4.96 mmol), was dissolved in methanol/toluene (1/1 v/v, 50 mL), then 4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-2-thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl-[1,3,2]dioxaborolane (3.3 g, 12.4 mmol), K2CO3 (3.43 g, 24.8 mmol) and Pd(dppf)Cl2 (405 mg, 0.50 mmol) were added. The reaction mixture was heated at 70 °C for 2 h under μw irradiation (100 W). The mixture was diluted with NH4Cl (sat. sol., 100 mL), the two layers were separated, and the aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers were washed with H2O (50 mL), dried over Na2SO4 and then the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The crude was purified by flash chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 9/1) yielding phenyl-bis-(4-thieno[3,2-b]thiophen-2-yl-phenyl)-amine (2) (1.22 g, 47%) as a yellow solid. 1H-NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δH 7.52 (d, J = 8.7 Hz, 4H), 7.41 (s, 1H), 7.34 (d, J = 5.2 Hz, 1H), 7.31 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 1H), 7.25 (d, J = 5.1 Hz, 1H), 7.18 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.13 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H), 7.10 (t, J = 6.9 Hz, 1H).

Preparation of DSSCs
DSSCs have been prepared by adapting a procedure reported in the literature.23 In order to exclude metal contamination all of the containers were in glass or Teflon and were treated with EtOH and 10% HCl prior to use. Plastic spatulas and tweezers have been used throughout the procedure. FTO glass plates were cleaned in a detergent solution for 15 min using an ultrasonic bath, rinsed with pure water and EtOH. After treatment in a UV-O3 system for 18 min, the FTO plates were treated with a freshly prepared 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C and then rinsed with water and EtOH. A transparent layer of 0.20 cm2 was screen-printed using the Dyesol 18NR-T TiO2 paste described above. The coated films were thermally treated at 125 °C for 6 min, 325 °C for 10 min, 450 °C for 15 min, and 500 °C for 15 min. The heating ramp rate was 5–10 °C min−1. The sintered layer was treated again with 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 (70 °C for 30 min), rinsed with EtOH and heated at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to 80 °C the TiO2 coated plate was immersed into a solution of the dye for 5 h at room temperature in the dark. Counter electrodes were prepared according to the following procedure: a 1 mm hole was made in a FTO plate, using diamond drill bits. The electrodes were then cleaned with a detergent solution for 15 min using an ultrasonic bath, 10% HCl, and finally acetone for 15 min using an ultrasonic bath. After thermal treatment at 500 °C for 30 min, a drop of 5 × 10−3 M solution of H2PtCl6 in EtOH was added on the cold FTO and the thermal treatment at 500 °C for 30 min repeated. The dye adsorbed TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sealed sandwich-type cell by heating with a hot-melt ionomer-class resin (Surlyn 30 μm thickness) as a spacer between the electrodes. A drop of the electrolyte solution was added to the hole and introduced inside the cell by vacuum backfilling. Finally, the hole was sealed with a sheet of Surlyn and a cover glass. A reflective foil at the back side of the counter electrode was taped to reflect the unabsorbed light back to the photoanode.
