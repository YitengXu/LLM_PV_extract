    , Accepted 29th March 2018First published on 29th March 2018AbstractA series of small molecules containing alternative multiple donor and acceptor units have been designed and synthesized. These small molecules introduce diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) and difluorobenzotriazole (DFBZ) as acceptor units and different donor cores with the intention to modulate intermolecular and intramolecular interactions and ultimately improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE). The structure–property relationship has been systematically investigated through exploring the effect of the electron-donating ability of the central donor unit on optoelectronic properties, crystallinity and morphology. As a result, IDTTFD has the strongest absorption in the visible region and appropriate energy levels. The organic solar cells based on IDTTFD/PC61BM achieve the highest PCE of 7.06% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 14.08 mA cm−2, and a FF of 58%.
Introduction
Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have surpassed 12% through continuous efforts of chemists over the past two decades.1–11 Generally, the active layers of OSCs are composed of p-type donor and n-type acceptor materials. The p-type and n-type materials include conjugated polymers and organic small molecules. So far, conjugated polymers have garnered widespread attention because of their strong light-harvesting ability, tunable energy levels and high mobility.12–14 Unlike polymers, small molecules have additional advantages of good solubility, easy purification and well-defined chemical structures, which reduce the issues associated with batch-to-batch variation.15–19 Currently, many small molecule non-fullerene acceptors have been designed and achieved a prominent breakthrough in photovoltaic performance, such as the well-known 2,2′-[[6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydro-dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,8-diyl]bis[methylidyne(3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]]-bis[propanedinitrile] (ITIC)20 and perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives.21–26 However, due to the lack of in-depth exploration of the relationship between structure, property and performance, small molecule donors still need further investigation in material design and device engineering.
Constructing oligomers or intermediate-sized small molecules with enlarged conjugation length can combine the desirable qualities of polymers and small molecules.27–29 The enlarged conjugation length will also enhance the donor–acceptor interaction and lead to improved absorption ability and lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level.30 The Bazan group designed and synthesized a series of donor–acceptor alternating narrow band gap conjugated chromophores. The optical and electrochemical properties, thermal stability, charge carrier mobility and photovoltaic performances were adjusted by the variation of the central accepting unit.31 BHJ OSCs obtained a PCE of 6.4% when blended with PC61BM. Wang et al. reported a family of D2–A2–D1–A1–D1–A2–D2 type small molecule donors based on diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as cores for solution-processed OSCs.32 An outstanding PCE of 7% with a high fill factor (FF) and open circuit voltage (Voc) was achieved after solvent vapor annealing with tetrahydrofuran (THF). However, we have noticed that the synthesis routes to these small molecules were long and tedious. Therefore, new synthesis methods need to be developed to solve the problem. Recently, Zhang and coworkers developed an efficient synthesis route to a fluorinated benzothiadiazole-thiophene structural motif via C–H functionalization.33 This method can be employed to synthesize unsymmetrical and symmetrical units in OSCs.
Benzotriazole was widely applied to construct conjugated polymers due to the advantages of attaching solubilizing alkyl chains to the nitrogen atom, which is important for the formation of high quality films and leading to preferable charge transport in OSCs.34–36 On the other hand, the alkyl chain away from the conjugated backbone leads to a planar conformation. Generally, the alkyl chain in benzotriazole could be beneficial for the tuning of crystallinity in small molecules. A linear benzotriazole-containing non-fullerene small molecule acceptor BTA1 was designed and synthesized by the Zhou group.37 Polymer solar cells based on P3HT:BTA1 obtained the highest PCE of 5.24%, which is a high value among the P3HT:non-fullerene systems. Introducing fluorine atoms onto the benzotriazole as electron-withdrawing groups will simultaneously decrease the HOMO and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of polymers and increase the Voc in the corresponding OSCs.38–43 However, fluorobenzotriazole has been rarely used in small molecule OSCs. Recently, a novel small molecule based on benzodithiophene as the central donor unit and difluorobenzotriazole (DFBZ) as the acceptor unit was synthesized and achieved a PCE of 9.73% with a non-fullerene small molecule acceptor.44 This research demonstrates that DFBZ based small molecules have great potential in OSC applications.
In this article, a series of small molecule donors containing multiple donor and acceptor units were designed and synthesized. The structures of these small molecules, namely BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD are shown in Scheme 1. These small molecules used DFBZ and DPP as acceptors. The DFBZ and DPP units were coupled via C–H functionalization, which simplified the synthesis routes to these small molecule donors. The alkyl chains attached on the nitrogen atoms of DFBZ and DPP units would tune the solubility and crystallinity of these small molecules. In order to explore the effect of electron-donating ability of donor units on optoelectronic properties, 4-(2-octyldodecyl)-dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyridin-5(4H)-one, thiophene, indacenodithiophene and dithienoindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene were introduced as the donor cores for BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD, respectively. The structure–property relationship was systematically evaluated and analyzed in this system. By varying the donor core, the π conjugation length and intramolecular and intermolecular interactions were changed, which will influence the π–π stacking and charge transport in active layers. As a result, the four small molecules showed improved absorption ability, decreased HOMO energy levels and enhanced hole mobility with an increased electron-donating ability of the core from BFD to TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD. The OSCs based on IDTTFD:PC61BM achieved the highest PCE of 7.06% with a Voc of 0.86 V and a Jsc of 14.08 mA cm−2.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthesis routes to the four compounds, BFD, TFD, IDTFD, IDTTFD, are outlined in Scheme 2. Compounds 1, 2 and 4 were synthesized according to the reported literature.33,45,46 The unsymmetrical difluorinated benzotriazole-DPP structural motif 3 was synthesized via dual C–H functionalization under mild reaction conditions. Traditional techniques in the synthesis of 3 may need four steps, including the preparation of mono-bromide DFBZ, borated DPP, Suzuki coupling and finally bromination. This method offers us a simple and effective way to synthesize unsymmetrical units without the use of dangerous reagents, such as toxic tin reagents and n-butyllithium. The target molecules were synthesized via a Stille cross coupling reaction using Pd2(dba)3 as catalyst between compound 3 and the corresponding stannyl compounds, respectively. The structures of the four compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, elemental analysis and MALDI-TOF. The synthetic details are displayed in the ESI.† The alkyl chains attached on the nitrogen atoms of DPP and DFBZ units guarantee good solubility of the materials in common organic solvents such as chloroform, chlorobenzene, toluene, etc. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. S1†) demonstrates that the four compounds are thermally stable with 5% decomposition at the temperature of 405, 379, 379 and 405 °C for BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD, respectively.

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the four compounds in chloroform solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 1, and the related data are listed in Table 1. In solution, the four compounds show relatively similar absorption profiles. The maximum absorption coefficients of BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD are 1.51 × 105, 1.64 × 105, 1.76 × 105 and 2.18 × 105 M−1 cm−1, respectively. The absorption from 500 nm to 700 nm can be attributed to the photo-induced intramolecular charge transfer between the donor and acceptor units. When introducing stronger electron-donating donor units as the core, the maximum absorption peaks of IDTFD and IDTTFD shift to a longer wavelength than those of BFD and TFD. Compared with the absorption in solution, all of the compounds exhibit broader absorption bands in the visible to near-infrared region in thin films. The absorption spectra of BFD, TFD, IDTFD, and IDTTFD in films all exhibit a strong shoulder peak, which implies the existence of strong aggregation configurations in the solid state. The onset wavelength in the film is 756, 738, 780 and 780 nm for BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD, respectively. The more red-shifted absorption edge of IDTFD and IDTTFD indicates stronger stacking, which can be assigned to the stronger electron-donating abilities of the donor units. Calculated from the equation Eoptg = 1240/λedge, the optical band-gap is 1.64, 1.68, 1.59 and 1.59 eV for BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD, respectively. From the optical properties of the compounds, it can be concluded that increasing the electron-donating abilities of the cores will enhance the intramolecular interactions and lead to red-shifted and broad absorption. This will be beneficial to enhance the light-harvesting ability and obtain higher photocurrent in OSCs.

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the effect of the electron-donating ability on the electrochemical properties, the redox potentials of the four compounds were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The CV curves of all the compounds are displayed in the ESI (Fig. S2†) and the related data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the corresponding HOMO/LUMO energy levels of BFD and TFD are −4.99/−3.26 and −4.98/−3.30 eV, respectively. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels are the same −5.10/−3.40 eV for IDTFD and IDTTFD. The introduction of stronger donor units into IDTFD and IDTTFD leads to deeper HOMO energy levels, which can be attributed to the enhanced intramolecular interaction. It is well known that the open circuit voltage (Voc) depends on the energy offset between the HOMO energy levels of the donor and the LUMO energy levels of the acceptor.47 The deep HOMO energy levels of IDTFD and IDTTFD are expected to increase the Voc. Meanwhile, the decreased LUMO of IDTFD and IDTTFD will reduce the energy loss when the small molecules are blended with acceptors. The band-gap (Ecvg) of the four molecules is 1.73, 1.68, 1.70 and 1.70 eV for BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD, respectively. These values are a little higher than those obtained from the absorption spectra because of the energy barriers of charge transfer in the CV experiments.

Density functional theory
Theoretical calculations were carried out to analyze the effect of the electron-donating ability of donor units on the frontier orbital energies of the small molecules by using density functional theory at the level of B3LYP/6-31G(d). In order to simplify the calculation, the alkyl chains in the four small molecules were substituted with methyl groups. The optimized molecular structures and the electron density distributions are displayed in Fig. 3. The detailed dihedral angle values between donor units and acceptor units are listed in Table S1.† It can be seen that the dihedral angles in the four molecules are all no more than 10°. The results demonstrate that all four molecules have good planarity along the whole conjugated backbones, which implies that the four molecules may have high charge carrier mobility. The good planarity may result from the hydrogen bond between fluorine and hydrogen atoms, as well as the interaction between sulfur and oxygen atoms.48 The HOMO and LUMO surfaces of BFD are partially delocalized on the backbone due to the asymmetry of the molecule. However, the HOMO and LUMO surfaces of TFD and IDTFD are well delocalized over the entire backbones. For IDTTFD, although the LUMO energy levels are distributed mainly on the DFBZ and DPP units, the HOMO energy levels are well distributed on the whole molecule. These observations clearly indicate that the electron-donating ability of donor units could slightly disturb the distribution of LUMO energy levels while it has negligible influence on the HOMO energy levels. In addition, the delocalized HOMO wave function of TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD may promote a larger intermolecular hole–electron separation, which will improve the Jsc.

Photovoltaic performance
The OSC devices based on small molecule donors blending with PC61BM or PC71BM were fabricated to evaluate the photovoltaic performances with an inverted structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/active layer/MoOx/Ag. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 4a and the extracted device parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and S2–S6.† The photovoltaic performances were optimized by thermal annealing (TA), solvent vapor annealing (SVA), and different D:A weight ratios and additives.

The PCE of the devices based on the as-cast blend films of the four materials was poor and less than 1% (Table S2†). Then TA and SVA were used to improve device performance (Tables S2–S3†). However, the PCE was not significantly enhanced. Noticeably, the PCE was substantially increased to 1.29% for BFD:PC71BM, 3.14% for TFD:PC71BM, 3.75% for IDTFD:PC71BM and 5.33% for IDTTFD:PC71BM after using 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO) as additive (Table S3†). Meanwhile, when IDTTFD and PC61BM were employed as active layers, a maximum PCE of 5.49% was obtained with a Voc of 0.85 V, a Jsc of 11.71 mA cm−2 and a FF of 55%. Obviously, additives had a positive effect on the morphology of active layers and the photovoltaic performances of the devices. So, different kinds of additives such as DIO, diphenyl ether (DPE) and 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) were used to slightly adjust the morphology and achieve enhanced PCEs (Tables S4–S6†). Finally, the champions of photovoltaic performances were achieved with an optimized D:A ratio of 1:1.5, a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1 in chloroform, 5% DPE as additive and PC61BM as acceptor.
As shown in Table 2, the devices exhibit a PCE of 2.25% for BFD/PC61BM, 3.81% for TFD/PC61BM, and 5.58% for IDTFD/PC61BM, respectively. The highest PCE of 7.06% is obtained for the device based on IDTTFD with a Jsc of 14.08 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.86 V and a FF of 58%. The PCEs of the devices based on IDTTFD using 5% DPE as additive are higher than those of using DIO and CN. Benefiting from the low-lying HOMO energy levels, the devices based on IDTFD and IDTTFD obtain relatively higher Voc of 0.82 V and 0.86 V than those of BFD (0.72 V) and TFD (0.76 V). The Voc mainly depends on the difference between the HOMO levels of the donor and LUMO levels of the acceptor. However, it also has a relationship with the radiative and non-radiative recombination loss. So the lower Voc of IDTFD:PC61BM compared with that of IDTTFD:PC61BM may be the result of larger energy loss. The Jsc of the devices based on the small molecules and PC61BM is gradually improved from BFD (7.37 mA cm−2) to TFD (10.96 mA cm−2), IDTFD (13.13 mA cm−2) and IDTTFD (14.08 mA cm−2). The significant improvement of Jsc can be attributed to the strong absorption ability resulting from the enhanced stacking and morphology. The same trend for FF (42% for BFD, 46% for TFD, 52% for IDTFD and 58% for IDTTFD) is observed as a function of the electron-donating ability of the donor core, which may be due to the decreased charge recombination as discussed below. The sub-optimal FF can probably be improved through forming thinner blends with a small molecule acceptor that shows complementary absorption and better interfacial contact with the application of buffer layers. Therefore, we can reasonably infer that the electron-donating ability of the donor units plays a dominant role in the photovoltaic performances of small molecule donor based OSCs.
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra (Fig. 4b) of the devices as a function of the wavelength were measured to understand the origin of the improved Jsc. All the devices exhibit a wide response from 300–800 nm. The slightly enhanced EQE from 500–600 nm compared with their absorption is probably due to that the holes generated in the acceptor were efficiently transferred to the donor. The maximum EQE values of 38% (600 nm), 56% (610 nm), 65% (660 nm) and 64% (635 nm) are determined for BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD based devices, respectively. Although in the region of 600–700 nm, the photoresponse value of the IDTTFD based device is a bit lower than that of the IDTFD based device, the photoresponse of IDTTFD is stronger in the region of 300–500 nm. We can conclude that the introduction of strong electron-donating donor units into the small molecule skeletons enhances the photoresponse, which is a key factor for achieving high performance OSCs. The integrated Jsc values of BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD based devices are 7.83, 11.34, 13.39 and 13.67 mA cm−2, respectively, which matched well with the Jsc obtained from J–V measurements.
Charge transport and recombination
To get a deep insight into the origin of the improved Jsc and FF based on IDTFD and IDTTFD, the dependence of Jsc on light intensity (Plight) for devices based on the four molecules was studied to investigate the charge separation and bimolecular recombination dynamics. Fig. 4c depicts the double-logarithmic plots of Jscversus light intensity for all the devices. The correlation between Jsc and light intensity was fitted according to the equation of Jsc ∝ Pαlight.49 The logarithmic slopes between Jsc and light intensity for the devices based on BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD are 0.94, 0.94, 0.97 and 0.96, respectively, which demonstrates that the bimolecular recombinations are efficiently suppressed in the IDTFD and IDTTFD based devices. These results correlate well with the relatively high Jsc and FF observed for IDTFD and IDTTFD.
The curves of photogenerated current density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) were obtained to investigate the charge generation, charge transfer state dissociation and charge extraction properties.50–52 The Jph and Veff were calculated from the following equation: Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under light and in the dark, and Veff = V0 − Va, where V0 and Va are the voltages at Jph = 0 and the applied voltage. Under these conditions, the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat) is only limited by the total amount of the absorbed photons. So the Jsat of BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD based devices is 10.12, 13.61, 14.20 and 15.44 mA cm−2, respectively. Then the maximum photoinduced carrier generation rate Gmax can be determined according to Gmax = Jsat/(qL), where q is the elementary charge and L is the film thickness.53,54 Hence, the Gmax is 5.36 × 1027, 7.15 × 1027, 7.39 × 1027, and 7.91 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for the blend films of BFD, TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD with PC61BM, respectively. The higher Gmax indicates the better exciton dissociation and charge generation ability. In addition, the value of Jsc/Jsat indicates the charge transfer state dissociation efficiency.55,56 As shown in Fig. 4d, the value of Jsc/Jsat for BFD:PC61BM, TFD:PC61BM, IDTFD:PC61BM and IDTTFD:PC61BM blends is 73%, 80%, 92%, and 91%, respectively. The higher charge transfer state efficiencies of IDTFD/PC61BM and IDTTFD/PC61BM should be responsible for the increased Jsc and FF.
The hole mobility of the blend films (Fig. 5) was measured by the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/small molecule:PC61BM/MoOx/Ag.57 The hole mobility of small molecules/PC61BM was calculated using the following formula: J = 9ε0εrμV2/8d3. In this formula, J is the current density, ε0 is the free space permittivity, εr is the average relative dielectric constant of the blend film and taken as 3 in this system, μ is the corresponding mobility, d is the film thickness and V is the voltage. The hole mobility of the blend film is found to be 1.56 × 10−5, 6.76 × 10−5, 2.34 × 10−4, and 6.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BFD:PC61BM, TFD:PC61BM, IDTFD:PC61BM and IDTTFD:PC61BM, respectively. As can be seen, there is a remarkable increase in hole mobilities with improved π–π stacking capacity. The high hole mobilities of IDTFD and IDTTFD based devices will help the charge carriers quickly escape and result in efficient charge collection, thus accounting for the higher FF.

Morphology
In order to gain a deep understanding of the device performance improvement and phase separation characteristics of the active layers, measurements of atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for BFD:PC61BM, TFD:PC61BM, IDTFD:PC61BM and IDTTFD:PC61BM blend films were carried out. As shown in the AFM height images of Fig. S3,† the dark and light-colored areas correspond to PC61BM and small molecule domains, respectively. All the films reflect phase separation and contain nanosized intertwined fibrillar aggregates. Compared with BFD, TFD and IDTFD, the IDTTFD films exhibit more densely packed nanostructures, which would be good for charge transport in devices. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values are 4.53 nm, 3.52 nm, 5.11 nm and 4.97 nm for the blend films of BFD:PC61BM, TFD:PC61BM, IDTFD:PC61BM and IDTTFD:PC61BM, respectively. The higher RMS of IDTFD and IDTTFD with PC61BM blend films may increase the contact area between the active layer and the interfacial electrode, leading to enhanced charge collection. The TEM images (Fig. 6) reveal a distinct difference between the blend films. The BFD:PC61BM and TFD:PC61BM films display good miscibility between the donor and the acceptor, thus the aggregation and crystallinity of small molecule donors are hampered. So the corresponding morphologies are uniform. However, the TEM images of the BHJ film formed by IDTFD and IDTTFD with PC61BM contain a continuous nanofiber-like network. The favorable morphologies and the nanoscale network structure formed in the IDTFD:PC61BM and IDTTFD:PC61BM films should be responsible for efficient charge separation and transport with decreased charge recombination, which contributes to the improved Jsc and FF of the corresponding devices.

Structural orders of all the materials in pure and blend films were investigated by using grazing incident wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIXD) plots. Fig. S4 and S5† exhibit the images and plots of the GIXD results and Table 3 summarizes the parameters of the pure small molecules and blend films. Strong diffraction peaks can be seen for the pure films, revealing that the small molecules have good crystallinity. With the variation of the donor unit, the lamellar stacking distances as shown by (100) peaks gradually decreased from 15.92 Å for BFD to 14.68 Å for TFD and 14.09 Å for IDTFD and then increased to 15.68 Å for IDTTFD. Obviously, the lamellar stacking is influenced by the conjugated backbones. However, an opposite trend was obtained for the π–π stacking distances as shown by the (010) peaks of 3.41 Å for BFD, 3.45 Å for TFD, 3.79 Å for IDTFD, and 3.59 Å for IDTTFD. The results suggest that the aggregation state of the small molecules can be affected by the variation of the core. For the optimal blend films, the (100) peaks in the out-of-plane direction are all located at smaller q values than that of their pure films, corresponding to the larger alkyl–alkyl distance. The (010) peaks of the blend films are all located at about 1.4 Å−1, corresponding to the π–π stacking distance of about 4.4 Å. The results indicate that the variation of the donor units can indeed adjust the packing of the small molecules in the solid state.

Conclusions
In summary, we have investigated a series of small molecule donors with multiple alternative electron-donor and acceptor units. Due to the increased electron-donating ability of the donor core from BFD to TFD, IDTFD and IDTTFD, the intramolecular interactions are enhanced. Hence, the light-harvesting ability becomes stronger in the visible region and the HOMO energy levels are deeper. The device based on IDTTFD/PC61BM as the active layer shows high hole mobility, low charge recombination, high charge transfer efficiency and favorable morphology. As a consequence, the IDTTFD based devices achieve the highest PCE of 7.06% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 14.08 mA cm−2 and a FF of 58%.
