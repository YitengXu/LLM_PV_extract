    , Accepted 2nd July 2020First published on 3rd July 2020AbstractFive-membered aromatic heterocycles are widely used for constructing conjugated polymers in the application of organic photovoltaic cells (OSCs). In this work, three polymers containing furan, thiophene, and selenophene as the π-bridge in their backbones, namely PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se, were designed, synthesized and characterized. By blending with BTP-4Cl, an emerging non-fullerene acceptor, the OSC devices based on the three polymer donors show distinct photovoltaic properties with the variation of the five-membered chalcogen-π-heterocycles. It is demonstrated that PBDB-TF-O tends to undergo severe aggregation while blending with the NFA molecule due to its strong polarity by the introduction of oxygen atoms, and the heavy atom effect of Se exists in PBDB-TF-Se, resulting in its poor luminescence property and larger non-radiative energy loss. The PCE is 0.55% and 11.92% for PBDB-TF-O and PBDB-TF-Se based OSCs, respectively. PBDB-TF-S, the polymer containing thiophene as the heterocycle-π-bridge, presents appropriate aggregation characteristics, decreased non-radiative energy loss, and high and balanced mobilities, and thus presents a desirable PCE of 16.22%. This work indicates that thiophene should be the most appropriate unit among the three chalcogen-heterocycles to construct the backbones of conjugated polymers with high photovoltaic performance.
Introduction
Polymers with a conjugated structure have a delocalized electron system along with the backbones, which is helpful to obtain high absorption coefficients, create photo-generated charge carriers and achieve efficient charge transport in thin films.1–5 By modifying the molecular structure of conjugated polymers, the energy band gap, the conformation and crystallization property, and the morphology of organic semiconductors can be easily designed and engineered.6–11 Therefore, their distinctive advantages make the conjugated polymer family a formidable candidate for a low-cost, clean, and renewable energy source. In the past decades, conjugated polymers have been rapidly developed and widely used in electronics and optical applications, such as organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs),12–14 organic field-effect transistors (OFETs),15–17 and organic solar cells (OSCs).18–20 In the field of OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), derived from the development of conjugated polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors, power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 17% have been recorded recently.21–25 Among various conjugated building blocks, five-membered aromatic heterocycles containing the oxygen family elements, namely furan, thiophene, and selenophene, have attracted tremendous attention and contributed to PCE milestones.26–45 Hence, studies on the role of five-membered heterocycles are of great importance to polymer design along with the further improvement of PCEs for OSCs.
Generally, the heteroatoms in the five-membered aromatic heterocycles, oxygen (O), sulphur (S), and selenium (Se), belong to the chalcogen family, and they provide two electrons to the system in the ring and exhibit similar aromaticities. However, when the five-membered heterocycles were employed in conjugated backbones or side groups, the corresponding polymers exhibited distinct photovoltaic properties in OSCs.26–30 For instance, due to the weak steric hindrance caused by the small size of oxygen, furan was often introduced into the backbone of the conjugated polymers to improve their solubility.28 In particular, the ether oxygen on furan can boost the polarity of the compounds as well as the potential for hydrogen bonding, and these characteristics may improve the solubility of the compounds in polar solvents such as tetrahydrofuran and acetone and thus realize the “green solvent processable” OSCs in some way. Due to the higher electron density than that of furan, thiophene exhibits outstanding optical properties and electron transfer capability, and has been demonstrated to be one of the most important heterocyclic units for designing and constructing novel organic semiconductors.31–34 Other than the well-known polythiophenes and their derivatives, some fused polycyclic compounds containing thiophene exhibit the potential to construct conjugated polymers with high carrier mobilities as well, such as bithiophene and benzodithiophene.35–40 For selenophene-based conjugated polymers, favorable PCEs of OSCs were observed due to the intrinsically low-lying lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels along with the effective absorption broadening by insetting selenophene rings in the polymer backbones.40–45 The replacement of S atoms with Se atoms in the backbones of conjugated polymers can often result in the enhancement of the charge transport properties in OFETs,46,47 but usually leads to lower values of the open-circuit voltage (VOC) due to the higher highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels in OSCs.40–45 Furthermore, the furan, thiophene and selenophene units have been applied to the side chains of conjugated polymers as 2D-functional groups to investigate the photovoltaic properties in quite a few reported works.28,48 However, the studies of these heterocycles in the OSC field were mainly focused on polymer:fullerene composite solar cells, and systematic and intensive research of the heterocycles, furan, thiophene and selenophene, as the vital conjugated building blocks of NF-OSCs has been seldom reported.
Currently, a large number of molecular design strategies have been explored, constantly, to improve the photovoltaic parameters including VOC, short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF), among which reducing the energy loss from the optical bandgap (Eg) to the VOC of the device has been regarded as an effective way to enhance the VOC.49–54 The non-radiative recombination loss, constituting a significant part of the total energy losses in bulk heterojunction OSCs, can be identified by the electroluminescence yields (EQEEL), and the calculated value is typically between 0.30 and 0.48 V. Therefore, the understanding of non-radiative recombination in OSCs has emerged as an interesting topic. In this work, PBDB-TF-S (also well known as PBDB-TF or PM6, containing thiophene as the π-bridges in the backbone) was employed as the control polymer, and another two new conjugated polymers, PBDB-TF-O and PBDB-TF-Se, containing furan and selenophene as the π-bridge between the benzodithiophene (BDT) and 1,3-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione (BDD) units were designed and synthesized, respectively (the chemical structures are shown in Scheme 1). We systematically investigated the fundamental characteristics of these three conjugated polymers containing different heterocycles, using theoretical calculation, steady-state UV-Vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL)/electroluminescence (EL) spectra along with the Stokes shift and photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE). Then we fabricated the OSCs by introducing the emerging acceptor BTP-4Cl, and an impressive PCE of 16.22% was obtained for the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl-based devices. However, the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl-based OSCs present a rather low PCE of 0.55%, and the PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl-based devices present a PCE of 11.92%. We carefully analyzed the reasons for the difference in photovoltaic performance of the OSCs based on the three kinds of polymers, mainly through investigating their morphological properties, PL quenching study, charge carrier mobilities, and the EQEEL. It was found that the variation of the heterocycles in the backbone has a great impact on a series of properties, including optical-electrical, morphological, and photovoltaic characteristics.

Results and discussion
The three conjugated polymers possess very similar chemical structures. As shown in Scheme 1, the BDT unit and the BDD unit with furan, thiophene and selenophene as the π-bridge were copolymerized respectively, and the detailed synthetic routes of PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S, and PBDB-TF-Se are provided in the Experimental section in the ESI.† The three polymers can be easily dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB), dichlorobenzene, and chloroform. The estimated number-average molecular weights (Mn) are 17 K, 35 K, and 14 K, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.02, 2.45, and 2.58, respectively, measured by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene as the standard and o-dichlorobenzene as the eluent at 145 °C. It should be noted that the polymerization methods for the three polymers are the same, whereas the Mn of the thiophene-containing polymer shows a significantly higher value than those of the furan- and selenophene-based polymers. We tried different catalysts, polymerization solvents and times, but the Mn of PBDB-TF-O and PBDB-TF-Se was still at the low level as before. However, the following results and analysis show that the molecular weight should not be the essential influencing factor of the corresponding photovoltaic properties. Furthermore, PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se show better thermal stability than PBDB-TF-O in the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurement, and the decomposition onset points are 413 °C, 452 °C and 449 °C for PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S, and PBDB-TF-Se, respectively (as shown in Fig. S1†).
Theoretical calculations of the three polymers
The density functional theory (DFT) calculation at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level was carried out to gain insight into the three polymers. The optimized geometries for the BDT unit connected with the BDD unit with furan, thiophene and selenophene are shown in Fig. S2.† The dihedral angles between the conjugated backbone and furan, thiophene, and selenophene as the π-bridges are 36.45°, 13.50°, and 0.16° respectively, indicating that the three polymers show gradually enhanced planarity and delocalized states along the backbones. Taking the BDT unit connected to the BDD unit with selenophene for instance, the small dihedral angle between the conjugated backbone and selenophene is favorable for π-conjugation within the polymer chains, implying that PBDB-TF-Se should show a reduced band gap compared to the other two polymers. The calculated HOMO levels present similar values for the three polymers, while the LUMO levels are gradually reduced for the polymers with the different heterocycles of furan, thiophene and selenophene.
Fundamental characteristics of pure polymers
Firstly, we studied the steady state performance of the monomers (BDD-O, BDD-S, and BDD-Se), which is of great consequence to the corresponding polymers. The maximum absorption wavelength for the monomers in dilute CB is 427 nm for BDD-O, 422 nm for BDD-S, and 447 nm for BDD-Se as presented in Fig. 1a. The monomers show similar absorption coefficients, which are 3.57 × 104, 3.60 × 104, and 3.64 × 104 L mol−1 cm−1 for BDD-O, BDD-S, and BDD-Se respectively. The Stokes shift is 0.49 eV for BDD-O, 0.46 eV for BDD-S, and 0.35 eV for BDD-Se, calculated from the maximum absorption and PL wavelengths (as shown in Fig. 1a). Compared to BDD-O and BDD-S, the relatively smaller Stokes shift of BDD-Se should be attributed to the increased energy level crossing associated with its planar substitution pattern obtained from the DFT calculation.55–57 After polymerization, the maximum absorption/PL peaks are 501/592 nm, 612/666 nm, and 640/693 nm for the solution of PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S, and PBDB-TF-Se, respectively (Fig. 1b). The optical absorption of BDD-O shows no significant difference compared to BDD-S. However, after polymerization, the PBDB-TF-O solution showed an obvious blue-shifted absorption peak compared to the other two polymers, which should be due to its twisted backbone conformation.58,59 According to the above values obtained from the absorption and PL spectra in Fig. 1b, the Stokes shift is 0.38 eV for PBDB-TF-O, 0.16 eV for PBDB-TF-S, and 0.15 eV for PBDB-TF-Se. The Stokes shifts for the polymers are significantly smaller than those of the corresponding monomers, indicating that the three polymers show various degrees of reduced adverse energy relaxation of the excited state compared to the monomers.60,61

(b) Steady-state UV-visible absorption and PL spectra, (c) temperature-dependent absorption spectra, and (d) cyclic voltammetry curves for the three pure polymers, PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S, and PBDB-TF-Se, in CB. 
The temperature-dependent absorption (TD-Abs) measurement was carried out to study the aggregation behavior of the three conjugated polymers. As shown in Fig. 1c, a rare shoulder peak at 501 nm can be distinguished in the PBDB-TF-O solution, indicating its weak aggregation characteristic. PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se in dilute CB show distinct aggregation effects, as the temperature was varied from −10 °C to 120 °C, that is, the shoulder peak at 640 nm in the profile of the PBDB-TF-Se solution remains stronger than that of the PBDB-TF-S solution at high temperature. The results should be mainly due to the more planar feature of the backbone of PBDB-TF-Se; in other words, it could partly imply that the lower molecular weight of PBDB-TF-Se should not be an important influencing factor in this study. The maximum absorption peaks for the polymers are red-shifted in the film compared with those in the CB solution, which should be attributed to better planarity and stronger electronic interaction in the film states. As presented in Table 1, the offsets are 606 nm, 673 nm and 715 nm in the films, corresponding to the gradually decreased optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 2.05 eV, 1.84 eV, and 1.73 eV for PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se, respectively. Additionally, the absorption coefficient in thin films is 5.48 × 104 cm−1 for PBDB-TF-O, 7.73 × 104 cm−1 for PBDB-TF-S, and 10.06 × 104 cm−1 for PBDB-TF-Se. Similarly, the Stokes shift for the three polymers in the film states is 0.42 eV for PBDB-TF-O, 0.17 eV for PBDB-TF-S, and 0.17 eV for PBDB-TF-Se, calculated from the values obtained from the absorption and PL spectra in Fig. S3.† The reduced Stokes shift for PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se films suggests that these two polymer films show more efficient intermolecular energy transfer than the PBDB-TF-O film.60,61 In consequence, taking the aggregation effects and Stokes shift into account, PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se show more favorable donor characteristics for achieving highly efficient OSCs. In addition, the EL emission is usually used as an effective tool to monitor the non-radiative recombination.49–54 Herein, we measured the EQEEL for pure polymer devices as shown in Fig. S4.† The PBDB-TF-S-based device shows the highest EQEEL value of 7.14 × 10−5 compared to 3.61 × 10−5 for the PBDB-TF-O-based device and 5.21 × 10−5 for the PBDB-TF-Se device.

We further performed PLQE measurements to evaluate the luminescence properties of the BDD monomers and the three pristine polymers. The linear plots for two standards along with the three monomers and the corresponding polymers are presented in Fig. S5a–c,† and the detailed measurement methods are provided in the ESI.† The maximum PLQE values are 3.35%, 16.78% and 0.91% for BDD-O, BDD-S and BDD-Se, respectively. It is important to note that the PLQE values are 4.77% for PBDB-TF-O, 45.9% for PBDB-TF-S and 4.62% for PBDB-TF-Se, presenting the same trend as that of the corresponding monomers. The PLQE values is enhanced for all polymers as compared to the monomers, due to the various degrees of enhanced intramolecular charge transfer after the copolymerization with BDT units.60,61 There are respective reasons for the much lower PLQE values in furan- and selenophene-containing monomers and polymers. First, materials with a more planar and rigid chemical structure often show a higher PLQE value, whereas the dihedral angle between the conjugated backbone and furan is the largest among the three polymers, and this should be the reason for the low PLQE value observed in PBDB-TF-O solution. Second, in some reported works, heavy atoms, including Br, I, and Se, have quenching effects in the charge-transfer process; that is, in the presence of heavy atoms, Se could enhance intersystem crossing and further quench the fluorescence emission,55–57 and this may be the reason for the low PLQE value of PBDB-TF-Se. On the other hand, the highest PLQE values can be observed both in the monomer (BDD-S) and PBDB-TF-S, indicating that PBDB-TF-S should have excellent intramolecular charge transfer and the lowest non-radiative excitation among the three polymers, which possibly benefits from its moderate conjugation degree and restricting structural torsion.
We also investigated the energy levels of the three polymers by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement (Fig. 1d). The HOMO/LUMO levels are −5.72/−3.51 eV, −5.64/−3.67 eV, and −5.45/−3.71 eV for PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S, and PBDB-TF-Se, respectively. The gradually narrowed electrochemical bandgaps are coincident with the redshift of the maximum absorption peaks in the thin films for PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S, and PBDB-TF-Se. Moreover, the upshifted HOMO levels from PBDB-TF-O to PBDB-TF-S and then to PBDB-TF-Se predict that the OSCs based on the furan-containing polymer should achieve the highest VOC value among the three donors.
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate and compare the photovoltaic properties of the three polymers, we employed the same acceptor, BTP-4Cl (also named BO-4Cl, and the chemical structure is provided in Fig. S6†),23 to fabricate the OSCs in parallel with the architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PFN-Br/Al. The detailed device fabrication methods are provided in the Experimental section in the ESI.† The absorption spectra of the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl, PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl, and PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl blend films (D/A ratios: 1:1, w/w, for each) are presented in Fig. S6,† and all of the blends show complementary absorption spectra in the visible-near infrared range. The optimized and same fabrication conditions from our previous work were applied to compare the photovoltaic properties of the three polymers, that is, the polymer:BTP-4Cl weight ratios were fixed at 1:1, and the blends were dissolved in mixed solvents of CB:DIO (100:0.5, v/v).23,25 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the OSCs based on the three polymers are presented in Fig. 2a, with the corresponding photovoltaic parameters presented in Table 2. The devices based on PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl yield the highest PCE of 16.22%, with a VOC of 0.849 V, a JSC of 25.48 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.75, similar to the reported result in the literature.23 For PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl-based OSCs, the photovoltaic performance is dramatically lower than that of the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl-based devices, mainly due to the low JSC of 1.58 mA cm−2. The PCE of PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl-based devices is 11.92%, with a VOC of 0.798 V, a JSC of 23.72 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.63, lower than those of the PBDB-TF-S-based devices. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices were also determined and are shown in Fig. 2b. The integral current densities of the corresponding OSCs presented in Table 2 are coincident with the results from the J–V measurements. Similar wide response ranges and profiles for PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl and PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl based devices are observed. However, the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl based devices present a rather weak response in the whole range of the absorption spectra.

Then, we carried out the analysis of generated photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 2c).62 The calculated exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) for the devices based on the three polymers are presented in Table 2. The PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl-based devices present the highest Pdiss of 94%. The Pdiss values are 13% and 85% for PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl and PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl-based devices, respectively. The result indicates that PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl devices show the optimum exciton dissociation efficiency compared to the other two OSCs. Moreover, we studied the bimolecular recombination from the dependence of JSC on the light intensity, using the law JSC ∝ Pαin.63,64 As shown in Fig. 2d and Table 2, the value of the slope α decreases drastically from 0.98 for both PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl and PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl-based devices to 0.89 for PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl-based devices, implying that serious bimolecular recombination exists in the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl blend. Additionally, the PL quenching measurements for the three blend films are presented in Fig. S7.† The PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl blend film shows a rather low PL quenching efficiency, which corresponds to the low Pdiss of 13% for PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl-based devices, while the photoluminescence for the other two blends can be efficiently quenched, indicating that high exciton dissociation efficiencies can be realized in the corresponding devices. The above results clearly demonstrate that the low JSC and FF of the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl-based devices should be attributed to their low exciton dissociation and severe bimolecular recombination.
Morphology study
To further explore the cause of the extremely low JSC and FF observed in the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl-based devices, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were carried out to study the morphological properties of the three blend films as shown in Fig. 3a–i. For the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl blend film, large ball-like micrometer-sized aggregation with a mean Rq of 8.99 nm is present in both TEM and AFM images (Fig. 3a–c). In contrast, for the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl (Fig. 3d–f) and PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl (Fig. 3g–i) blend films, similar morphological properties with nanoscale fibrous aggregation characteristics can be observed in the TEM and AFM images with a mean Rq of 1.89 nm and 3.10 nm respectively, which are beneficial for efficient charge transport and thus realizing high photovoltaic performance.

It was reported in several literature studies that the strong polar functional groups, i.e. the introduction of oxygen atoms, tend to undergo large micrometer-sized aggregation during the morphological studies.26–29 Thus, the contact angles were further employed to investigate the surface energy of the three polymers since it is sensitive to the polar component. We calculated the surface tensions through the contact angle data. The images of the contact angle of water and glycerol on the three polymer films are shown in Fig. S8†, and the corresponding data are presented in Table S1.† The surface tension was calculated using the Wu model.65 The water/glycerol contact angles are 99.9°/93.5°, 104.4°/99.8°, and 105.4°/100.3° for PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S, and PBDB-TF-Se, respectively. The surface tension for the three polymers gradually decreases in the order of PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se, varying from 19.6, 16.8, to 16.6 mN m−1. Consequently, the interfacial tension for the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl blend film is the largest among the three blend films, which is the major cause for the large ball-like micrometer-sized aggregation of the PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl film. It is reasonable to visualize that the polymers with furan in the backbone will have serious morphological issues when blending with acceptors, as observed in the AFM and TEM images. Thus, PBDB-TF-O will not be discussed in the following studies due to the severe morphological issues.
Non-radiative VOC loss
As presented in the morphological studies, the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl and PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl blends show similar nanoscale fibrous aggregation, and the PL for both blend films could be efficiently quenched. However, the VOC of OSCs based on the PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl blend decreased by 49 mV compared with the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl-based device. Here, EQEEL measurement was conducted to evaluate the non-radiative recombination and energy loss in the PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se-based devices by using the equation qVnon-radOC = −kT ln (EQEEL).49–54 As shown in Fig. 4a, the EQEEL of PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl OSCs shows a higher value of 3.44 × 10−4 compared with 0.87 × 10−4 for PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl devices. The corresponding calculated non-radiative energy loss was 0.206 eV for PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl devices and 0.242 eV for PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl devices. In combination with the results of PLQE and EQEEL measurements, we can infer that the conjugated polymer donors containing heterocycles with heavy atoms, such as Se, will facilitate a non-radiative process and be detrimental to achieving a high VOC in OSCs.

To further investigate the differences in the JSC and FF for the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl- and PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl-based devices, the charge carrier mobilities were studied by space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. As presented in Fig. S9,† the profiles for the hole mobilities were obtained from the hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au), and the electron mobilities were obtained from the electron-only devices (ITO/ZnO/active layer/Al). As presented in Table S2,† lower and unbalanced hole/electron mobilities were observed for the PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl blend film (the hole mobility is 1.12 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the electron mobility is 8.36 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which should be part of the reason for the lower JSC and FF in the OSCs. The PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl blend film possesses higher and much more balanced mobilities (with a hole mobility of 2.30 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an electron mobility of 2.25 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), which is helpful for an efficient charge transport process and thus high JSC and FF values. In addition, the photoinduced charge-carrier extraction in linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) measurements were carried out to further confirm the results obtained from SCLC measurements. As shown in Fig. S10,† the photo-CELIV charge carrier mobilities for PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl and PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl OSCs are 1.79 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively.
Based on the above summarized results of the optical-electrical, morphological, and photovoltaic characteristics of the five-membered aromatic heterocycle-substituted polymers, PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se, we can confirm the following results: (1) PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se show a relatively planar backbone and strong self-aggregation in the CB solution, which is a critical factor in facilitating nanoscale network morphology while blending with NFAs. However, the PBDB-TF-O solution shows an extremely weaker aggregation effect than the other two polymers. (2) The OSCs based on the polymers:BTP-4Cl show distinct photovoltaic properties, that is, the PCEs are 0.55%, 16.22% and 11.92% for PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se based OSCs, respectively. The morphological study and the recombination mechanism analysis clearly revealed that the PBDB-TF-O tends to undergo severe aggregation together with the NFA molecule due to its strong polarity by the introduction of oxygen atoms, and thus resulted in low exciton dissociation efficiency and critical bimolecular recombination. (3) A comparison of the PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se based devices reveals that the heavy atom effect of Se in PBDB-TF-Se has adverse impacts on the luminescence property and thus presents quenching effects in the charge-transfer process. Furthermore, the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl blend shows higher and more balanced carrier mobilities than the PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl blend, which should be the reason for the higher performance obtained in the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl-based devices.
Conclusions
In brief, by employing the three commonly used five-membered aromatic heterocycles, furan, thiophene, and selenophene, to construct the π-bridges of conjugated polymers in the backbones, three polymer donors, namely PBDB-TF-O, PBDB-TF-S, and PBDB-TF-Se, were designed, synthesized and characterized to investigate their photovoltaic properties. PBDB-TF-S and PBDB-TF-Se show more planar conjugated backbones and possess significant interchain interaction than PBDB-TF-O. Ascribed to the strong polarity induced by the oxygen atom, the polymer PBDB-TF-O tends to undergo large aggregation while blending with BTP-4Cl, with a NFA molecule utilized to fabricate an active layer of the OSCs in this study. Thus, the photovoltaic characteristics of the OSCs based on PBDB-TF-O:BTP-4Cl show extremely low JSC and FF, resulting in a low PCE of 0.55%. An unsatisfactory PCE of 11.92% was obtained in PBDB-TF-Se:BTP-4Cl-based devices, which could arise from the lower and unbalanced hole/electron mobilities, along with the inherent disadvantages of PBDB-TF-Se, such as heavy atom effect and higher non-radiative energy loss. Among the three polymer:BTP-4Cl blends, the PBDB-TF-S:BTP-4Cl blend shows appropriate aggregation characteristics, decreased non-radiative energy loss, and high and balanced mobilities, and thus presents a desirable PCE of 16.22%. Overall, this study demonstrates that five-membered aromatic heterocycles have a great impact on the photovoltaic properties of the conjugated polymers. By using thiophene to construct the backbone of the conjugated polymers, PBDB-TF-S achieved the most suitable and desirable properties for application in highly efficient OSCs.
