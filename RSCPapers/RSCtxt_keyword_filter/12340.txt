    , Accepted 3rd December 2020First published on 8th December 2020AbstractResearching planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells has become increasingly popular in view of pursuing both a better photovoltaic performance and enhanced environmental stability. Recently, the use of integrated hole transport layers (HTLs) has attracted much attention because of the improvements in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, previous research studies usually focused on the HTLs in regular-type devices, which do not affect the formation of perovskite crystals. Here, we developed the HTL for inverted solar cells, which integrated organic poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b]-dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl] (PTB7) with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). PTB7 is used to tune the energy alignment and hydrophobicity of PEDOT:PSS to improve the hole transportation and perovskite formation. The integrated HTL (PEDOT:PSS/PTB7) demonstrated an enhanced hole extraction performance in perovskite solar cells due to better matched energy alignment. Furthermore, the hydrophobic nature of PTB7 provides a non-wetting surface that is beneficial to the crystal formation of perovskite, resulting in higher quality perovskite crystals. Using this simple process, the developed group exhibited a PCE of 18.43%, which was 16.5% higher than that of the reference devices (15.82%). In addition, due to the moisture-blocking characteristics of PTB7, the long-term stability of the devices was also obviously enhanced under ambient air conditions (25 °C) without encapsulation.
1. Introduction
In recent years, there has been ever-increasing interest in organic–inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to their significant advantages, which include low production cost and simple solution-processability, as well as their light weight and high power-conversion efficiency (PCE).1–5 Within just a few years of development, the PCE of perovskite-based devices has exceeded a certified 25.2%, reaching a level similar to that of silicon-based solar cells.6–12 In addition, their long-term stability and mass production efficiency have been obviously improved, which has increased the possibility of future commercialization.13–15
Generally, planar-configured PSCs are divided into regular and inverted structures based on the stacking sequence of each functional layer.16,17 The inverted-type devices exhibit slightly lower PCEs than the regular ones despite lower hysteresis in current–voltage characteristics.18,19 Thus, it is important to improve the PCEs of inverted devices to the levels similar to or higher than those of the regular devices.
The most widely used hole transport layer (HTL) in the inverted device is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), which is one of the important causes for the lower PCEs than those of regular devices; its use results in a comparatively low open circuit voltage, which may be due to the undesirable energy position of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO).20 Moreover, PEDOT:PSS is liable to absorb moisture at ambient temperatures due to its hydrophilicity, which facilitates the degradation of perovskite-based devices.21 Many efforts have been made to replace PEDOT:PSS with other materials; Bi et al. compared different types of HTL materials such as polyvinyl alcohol, PEDOT:PSS, poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA), N4,N4′-bis(4-(6-((3-ethyloxetan-3-yl)methoxy)hexyl)phenyl)-N4,N4′-diphenylbiphenyl-4,4′-diamine, and N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′′3′-benzothiadiazole) and obtained the highest PCE of 18.3% using the PTAA as the HTL.22 However, organic semiconductors such as PTAA are usually expensive and require additional impurity doping when used as a high conductivity HTL.22 In addition, fabrication processes sometimes need to be optimized again when a new HTL is introduced in the device fabrication.
On the other hand, integrating a small amount of new material into a conventional HTL can effectively improve the HTL in a cost-effective manner, without changing conventional fabrication processes. There have been many studies on integrated HTLs in regular PSCs; Kegelmann and coworkers mixed 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and PEDOT:PSS to fabricate a double HTL, obtaining the champion PCE of 18.7% with the environmental stability enhanced.16 Xu and coworkers obtained an improvement in PCE from 16.8 to 22.0% using an inexpensive inorganic–organic double HTL; they inserted ultrathin dithiophene–benzene between CuSCN and Au and argued that this method could also obviously enhance the environmental stability.23 In contrast, integrated HTLs in inverted devices have been seldom studied. Because the HTLs in inverted devices may affect the formation of perovskite crystals, which is closely related to PCE, unlike regular devices, the study of the HTLs for inverted devices is significantly different from that for regular devices.
In this work, we introduce an organic p-type polymer of poly[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl] (PTB7) as an intermediary to modify the PEDOT:PSS layer in inverted PSCs with the aim of simultaneously improving the hole extraction property of the HTL and the crystal quality of perovskite. Inserting PTB7 between the PEDOT:PSS and perovskite layers can improve energy alignment, which is beneficial for the hole-extraction in PSCs. The concentration of the PTB7 precursor was carefully controlled to form a partially covered PTB7 intermediary, which can not only ensure the suitable hole extraction characteristics but also create a surface with suitable hydrophobicity on which a perovskite film is deposited. As a result, the developed samples exhibited a quality-improved perovskite crystal, as compared with the control groups. Only a small amount of PTB7 is required to improve the device performance, which is more cost-effective than a full replacement of PEDOT:PSS with an organic semiconductor. After using PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 as the integrated HTL, the PCE of the PSCs was improved from 15.82 to 18.43%. This is mainly attributed to the significantly improved fill factor (FF) (from 0.69 to 0.76) and open circuit voltage (Voc) (from 1.04 to 1.09 V). Furthermore, the environmental stability was improved after adding PTB7 due to its hydrophobic property. Overall, a 19% PCE degradation was obtained for the PSCs with the integrated HTL, which is lower than that of the PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs (48%).
2. Results and discussion
The device structure of the PSCs is exhibited in Fig. 1a. Experimental details are summarized in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 1b, PTB7 is a widely used organic semiconductor24 with long carbon chains, which can be used to modify the interfacial properties of pristine-PEDOT:PSS. We fabricated the PSCs with an inverted p–i–n configuration of indium tine oxide (ITO)/HTL/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/2,9-dimethyl-4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline (BCP)/Ag, in which the HTL possessed an integrated structure of PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 (see the Experimental section in the ESI†). The ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†) indicated that PTB7 possessed a HOMO of −5.15 eV. As shown in Fig. 1c, PTB7 had a deeper HOMO than PEDOT:PSS, with a gradient band alignment formed after inserting PTB7 between the PEDOT:PSS HTL and the perovskite film. At the same time, adding the PTB7 intermediary can effectively suppress the charge recombination since the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PTB7 is higher than that of PEDOT:PSS, which means that it can effectively block the transportation of electrons from the perovskite layer.25

Due to the strong hydrophobic character of PTB7, it is advantageous in terms of moisture blocking, but undesirable for the deposition of the perovskite layer, which is perhaps the main factor hindering its application in inverted PSCs. It has been found that the water contact angle varies sensitively when changing the concentration of the PTB7 solution. Here, the water contact angles at different PTB7 concentrations were measured, and, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the low concentration of 1 mg mL−1 did not exhibit an obvious difference in water contact angle compared with the original PEDOT:PSS layer. It was subsequently deduced that this would not significantly affect the film quality of the perovskite. In contrast, 6 mg mL−1 PTB7 deposited on the PEDOT:PSS film presented a high hydrophobic character with a contact angle of 103.4°. This value is similar to that of the PTB7 film (around 20 mg mL−1) in organic photovoltaics,26 and suggests that a fully covered PTB7 film is undesirable for the film deposition of the perovskite due to the strong hydrophobic property. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†) concentrations of PTB7 within a range of 1 mg mL−1 to 6 mg mL−1 were tested to evaluate the influence on the film formation of perovskite. It is clear that relatively high concentrations, such as 4 or 6 mg mL−1, can lead to a discontinuous perovskite film due to the excessive hydrophobic character. The appropriate hydrophobic property was ultimately obtained at a concentration of 3 mg mL−1, which, as shown in Fig. 2a and b, demonstrated that incorporating this concentration of PTB7 on the surface of PEDOT:PSS led to an improved water contact angle from 19.1° to 61.7°. Therefore, the PTB7 intermediary may partly cover the PEDOT:PSS film and lead to an altered interfacial character. As shown in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images presented in Fig. 2c and d, the film morphology was changed after the incorporation of PTB7 presented a more homogeneous condition. Specifically, the PTB7-modified PEDOT:PSS presented a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.25 nm, which was lower than that of the bare PEDOT:PSS film (1.78 nm). Here, a lower RMS was considered to be beneficial for the interfacial contact.27 As shown in Fig. S4a (ESI†), PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 presented a similar transmittance to the bare PEDOT:PSS film, which means that coating the PTB7 film on the surface of PEDOT:PSS will not lead to a clear loss of incident light. The slight decrease in transmittance of the PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 film between 600 and 700 nm corresponds to the transmittance dip of PTB7, as shown in Fig. S4b (ESI†), confirming the existence of PTB7 intermediary in the film. As shown in the cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†), an integrated HTL of PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 (with a thickness of around 50 nm) was obtained by controlling for an appropriate concentration of PTB7 solution (3 mg mL−1), which ensured a suitable wettability as well as good electronic property. In short, a well-controlled hydrophobic property of the HTL is favorable for the growth of a perovskite crystal.22,28 As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the perovskite film grown on the PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 substrate exhibited a more compact and larger grain size (an average of around 500 nm) compared with that based on PEDOT:PSS (an average of around 300 nm). Fig. S6 (ESI†) indicates that the grain sizes in the perovskite films increased with increasing concentration of PTB7 in the solution to 3 mg mL−1, whereas the PTB7 concentration above 3 mg mL−1, such as 4 and 6 mg mL−1, caused discontinuities in the perovskite films, as discussed above. Thus, the largest grains were obtained for the use of 3 mg mL−1 PTB7. This can be explained by the fact that the hydrophobicity-enhanced PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 film could suppress the nucleus formation in small cavities, leading to a decreased density of nuclei and, thus, a larger grain size. At the same time, the higher hydrophobic character of PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 could lead to a decrease in the anchoring effect, which will be beneficial to the migration of the grain boundary during the crystal growth process.22

The UV-vis absorption spectra presented in Fig. 3c demonstrated that the perovskite film growth on PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 presented a slightly higher absorption rate than the perovskite layer deposited on PEDOT:PSS, suggesting an enhanced crystal quality.29 The crystal quality was further examined via X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. As presented in Fig. 4d, there were three clear characteristic peaks at around 14.2°, 28.4°, and 31.8°, which corresponded with the (110), (220), and (330) crystal planes, respectively.30 It is found that the sample based on PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 exhibited enhanced peak intensities of 17.1%, 9.6%, and 7.5% higher than those of the reference group at 14.2°, 28.4° and 31.8°, respectively. These XRD results suggest that incorporating PTB7 on top of PEDOT:PSS can improve the crystal quality of the perovskite. The details of the XRD measurements are summarized in Fig. S7 (ESI†), showing that the crystal quality improves with increasing PTB7 concentration to 3 mg mL−1. Therefore, the hydrophobicity-enhanced PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 is deemed beneficial to the crystal formation of perovskite.22

To gain further insight into the photovoltaic properties, the J–V characteristics were measured under the illumination of AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 with a working area of 0.1 cm2. Fig. S8 (ESI†) shows the photovoltaic performance variations of the PSCs with different concentrations of PTB7. Given that concentrations of higher than 3 mg mL−1 led to a discontinued perovskite film, the optimized concentration of 3 mg mL−1 exhibited the best PCE. Therefore, this concentration was used in the subsequent experiments unless otherwise specified. As shown in Fig. 4a, the perovskite-based devices presented an enhanced photoelectric performance, with a PCE, Voc, short circuit current (Jsc), and FF of 18.43%, 1.09 V, 22.1 mA cm−2, and 0.76, respectively, after applying the PTB7 intermediary on top of PEDOT:PSS. In comparison, the bare PEDOT:PSS-based PSCs exhibited a PCE of 15.82%, with a Voc of 1.04 V, a Jsc of 21.7 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.69. The detailed photoelectronic parameters are listed in Table 1. It is clear that the improved PCE of the experimental group was largely due to two factors: the increased FF and the increased Voc. First, the improved perovskite crystallinity could restrain the concentration of intrinsic defects to facilitate the improvement in FF,31 while, second, the deeper HOMO of PTB7 was likely the reason for the improved Voc.21 Meanwhile, the enlarged grain size of the PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-based perovskite reduced the charge recombination centers due to the decreased grain boundary concentrations, which was beneficial to suppressing the leakage current and boosting the Voc.22

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs based on various types of HTLs were measured, with integrated Jsc values of 21.31 and 20.87 mA cm−2 for the PSCs with and without PTB7, respectively, (Fig. 4b), which presented a small difference (<4%) with the Jsc results shown in Fig. 4a. Furthermore, the stabilized photocurrent and PCE output curves were measured to probe the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite-based devices with and without PTB7 from another perspective. As shown in Fig. 4c, the steady-state PCEs and Jsc values were close to those obtained from the J–V curves presented in Fig. 4a, suggesting a low hysteresis behavior.32 The PSCs with a PTB7 intermediary exhibited a state PCE of 17.9% and a Jsc of 21.6 mA cm−2, which were higher than those of the reference group (PCE = 15.3%, Jsc = 21.2 mA cm−2). Fig. 4d presents the histograms for the PCE distribution of the perovskite devices based on different types of HTLs. As the figure shows, more than 54% of all the samples based on PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 demonstrated higher PCEs than the mean PCE (18.43%). However, only around 48% of the reference samples without the PTB7 intermediary exhibited higher PCEs than average PCE (15.82%). The standard deviation (0.55) of the PEDOT:PSS/PTB7-based PSCs was 60% lower than that (0.91) of the control group, suggesting a better reproducibility for the experimental group.33
To further understand the substantial effects of incorporating the PTB7 intermediary, the photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured. As shown in Fig. 5a, the perovskite devices based on PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 presented a peak at around 765 nm, exhibiting a blue shift compared with that of the samples based on bare PEDOT:PSS (770 nm). This blue shift in the peak position may be due to the improved perovskite crystal property of the experimental group.34–36 It is clear that the perovskite deposited on PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 exhibited a peak that was slightly higher than that of the PEDOT:PSS-based perovskite. While PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 was capable of enhancing the hole transport capacity, which will be discussed hereinafter, the improved-quality perovskite film grown on PEDOT:PSS/PTB7 exhibited an increased carrier lifetime due to the suppressed nonradiative recombination centers, which dominated the final results.29 As indicated by the TRPL spectra (Fig. 5b), the PEDOT:PSS/PTB7/CH3NH3PbI3 sample displayed a longer fluorescence lifetime of 85.3 ns than the PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3 sample (48.4 ns), which was consistent with the PL data. To further study the trap density inhibition effect caused by inserting the PTB7 intermediary, the SCLC for the hole-only devices was examined at various bias voltages with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/MoO3/Ag. As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the J–V characteristic curves can be divided into three regions: the ohmic region, the trap-filled limit (TFL) region, and Child's law region. The ohmic region with a low voltage exhibited a linear relationship between the current and the voltage.37 The conterminal period of the voltages denoted the TFL region.38 The TFL voltage VTFL could be obtained from the connection point of the ohmic contact and the trap-filled regime, which reflects the trap states of the perovskite film. Hence, the trap density (ntrap) could be calculated according to eqn (1):39 (1)where L, e, ε, and ε0 represent the thickness of the perovskite film, the elementary charge, the relative dielectric constant, and the vacuum permittivity, respectively, and their values are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 5c and d, the VTFL was ascertained to be 0.33 V for the sample with PTB7 and 0.61 V for that without PTB7. As a result, a decreased hole-trap-state density could be calculated with a value of 5.28 × 1015 cm−3 after incorporating the PTB7 intermediary. In comparison, the sample without PTB7 exhibited a hole-trap-state density of 9.76 × 1015 cm−3. Therefore, incorporating PTB7 can help suppress the intrinsic defects in the perovskite film and will lead to an improved crystal quality, which was previously confirmed by the XRD results (Fig. 3d).

We also carried out EIS measurement under dark conditions to gain further insight into the charge extraction and transportation process of perovskite-based devices. As shown in Fig. 5e, the semicircles could be fitted into an equivalent circuit including series resistance (Rs), charge-transfer resistance (Rct), and capacitor C. Here, Rs stands for the internal series resistance, which is a sum of all the serial resistances in the PSCs, and Rct indicates the charge-transfer resistance, which presents the resistance against the process of charge transportation.40 As demonstrated by the Nyquist plots, the sample with the PTB7 intermediary returned a Rs of 29.3 Ω, which was 61.7% of that of the sample without PTB7 (47.5 Ω), suggesting a decreased series resistance after incorporating PTB7. Meanwhile, the Rct was decreased from 398.5 to 218.8 Ω after incorporating PTB7, suggesting a decreased charge-transfer resistance. This indicates a better carrier transport performance of the PTB7-based PSCs, which will ultimately contribute to an enhanced photovoltaic performance of the devices. The long-term stabilities of the PSCs were also investigated in ambient air (humidity of ca. 30% and temperature of ca. 25 °C) under 1 sun illumination without encapsulation. As shown in Fig. 5f, the degradation rate of the experimental group was retarded after incorporating the PTB7 organic semiconductor, retaining around 81% of the initial PCE after 300 h of storage. However, the control group without PTB7 only retained 52% of the initial PCE during the same period. More detailed degradation data, including Voc, Jsc, and FF, are summarized in Fig. S9 (ESI†). In view of this, the difference in the degradation rate of perovskite devices can be summarized in terms of several factors. First, the hydrophobic nature of organic PTB7 may favor the blocking of the moisture in the atmosphere, which is considered to be the critical factor in the degradation of perovskite. Second, inserting PTB7 between the PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite film helps to prevent the erosion due to the underlying acidity of PEDOT:PSS, providing a moderate substrate for light adsorption. Finally, the perovskite film in the PTB7-based device has better crystal quality and lower defect concentration than that without PBT7, as indicated by the XRD and trap density data, which result in slower perovskite degradation.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we applied an organic semiconductor (PTB7) on top of PEDOT:PSS to form an integrated HTL, which improved both the photovoltaic performance and the environmental stability. The inserted PTB7 intermediary can tune the energy alignment and is beneficial to the crystal quality of the perovskite film. As a result, the PSCs with the PTB7 intermediary demonstrated an improved photovoltaic performance, returning a PCE of 18.43%, a Jsc of 22.1 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.09 V, and a FF of 0.76, compared with the lower photovoltaic performance (PCE = 15.82%, Jsc = 21.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.04 V, and FF = 0.69) of the perovskite devices without PTB7. Furthermore, the long-term stability under air ambient conditions was clearly enhanced after incorporating PTB7 to form an integrated HTL. As a result, the experimental group retained 81% of the pristine PCE after 300 h of storage, which was higher than that of the control group (52%). Overall, our research provides a simple and efficient way to improve the performance and environmental stability of inverted PSCs.
