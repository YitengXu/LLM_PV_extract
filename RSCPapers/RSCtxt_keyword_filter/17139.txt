    , Accepted 12th October 2020First published on 16th October 2020AbstractDonor–acceptor two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks, PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni, are constructed and applied for selective CO2 reduction with CO conversion rates of 20.9 μmol g−1 h−1 and 40.0 μmol g−1 h−1, respectively, in the absence of any additional photosensitizers and noble metal co-catalysts within an operation time of 25 h. The multilayer nanosheet structure, efficient charge separation and transport, and internal reductive quenching cycle of the NiTAPP fragments of PD-COF-23-Ni result in its higher photocatalytic efficiency than that of PD-COF-23.
1. Introduction
Increasing human activities accelerate the consumption of fossil fuels and the increase in carbon dioxide emission, which results in a continuous rise of the global average temperature.1 The conversion of natural CO2 to stored energy is one of the most promising approaches for solving these problems.2 Solar power is abundant and renewable in nature, and therefore it is of interest to photosynthetically convert solar power to storable chemical energy in the form of carbohydrate fuels and oxygen. Various nanomaterials and molecular complexes have now been widely investigated as artificial photocatalysts for CO2 reduction under visible light.3–8 The challenge is to find catalysts that can reduce carbon dioxide with high activity, selectivity and durability under visible light.9
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a class of crystalline porous polymers held together by strong and rigid covalent linkages between light elements (H, B, C, N, and O) via the thermodynamically controlled reversible bond formation, have spurred broad interest in gas absorption and separation,10,11 drug delivery,12 electronic devices,13,14 and heterogeneous catalysis,15–18 owing to their diverse organic building units and regulable pore sizes. Over the past decade, chemists have found many ways to prepare porous materials but it remained difficult to access organic polymer networks with discrete pores until the concept of reticular chemistry came into being, which was proposed to construct these porous materials.19,20 Since the pioneering work by Omar Yaghi in 2005,21 the first two two-dimensional COF materials with specific structures and properties were synthesized via the dehydration of 1,4-benzenediboronic acid or the reaction with hexahydroxytriphenylene. Since then, a variety of 2D and 3D COFs have been prepared through a series of reversible synthetic reactions, such as boronate ester formation,22 nitrile trimerization,23 imidization,24 reaction with a Schiff base,25–28 and CC bond formation reaction.29
Recently, COFs have been widely reported for applications in CO2 reduction.30–32 For example, Zou et al. reported COFs bearing single Ni sites (Ni-TpBpy) for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO with 4057 μmol g−1 of CO in 5 h when using Ru(bpy)32+ as the photosensitizer. Recently, porphyrin-tetrathiafulvalene COFs were reported for efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction with 12.33 μmol CO evolution in 60 h without additional photosensitizers, sacrificial agents, and noble metal co-catalysts.33 Porphyrins have been widely studied as redox-active photosensitizers in photocatalysis as they can absorb blue and red light corresponding to the Soret and Q-bands.34–36 Nevertheless, only a few porphyrin-based covalent-organic frameworks (PCOFs) have been applied in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction in contrast to the more widely tested metal–organic framework (MOF) analogues.37,38 It is believed that 2D porphyrin-based COFs can be ideal candidates for photocatalytic studies because of their extended π-systems, high stability, volatile coordination chemistry and tunable pore channels.39 Herein, we designed and synthesized 2D COFs, denoted as PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni, from a conjugated electron donating porphyrin, MTAPP, and electron deficient moiety, DPP-CHO, via an acid-catalyzed Schiff-base reaction under reduced pressure (Scheme 1).40

2. Experimental
2.1 Synthesis of PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni
In a Pyrex tube, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPP) (6.7 mg, 0.01 mmol) and DPP-CHO (9.1 mg, 0.02 mmol) were dissolved in a mixture of 3 mL of n-butanol and 1 mL of mesitylene. Then, 0.1 ml of aqueous acetic (6 M) was added. The reaction mixture was sonicated for five minutes to obtain a homogeneous solution. The reaction vessel was degassed by using three freeze–pump–thaw cycles and fitted with a screw cap and heated at 120 °C for five days. The obtained dark precipitate was collected by filtration and washed with THF and acetone three times. The powder obtained was exchanged by acetone with a Soxhlet extraction apparatus and subsequently dried under vacuum for 12 h to obtain PD-COF-23 as a dark powder (9.4 mg, 52%).
The synthesis of PD-COF-23-Ni was processed similarly to that of PD-COF-23 but by using NiTAPP instead of TAPP, affording PD-COF-23-Ni as a red powder (6.2 mg, 34%).
2.2 Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical analysis was carried out in a conventional three electrode cell system, using Pt plates as counter electrodes and an Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl (aq.) electrode as the reference electrode. The working electrode was prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (ITO, 2 cm × 2 cm) glass, cleaned by sonication in acetone and ethanol for 30 min, and then dried. The ITO slide was dip-coated with 0.55 mL of slurry, which was obtained from a mixture of photocatalyst (1 mg), ethanol (0.5 mL) and Nafion solution (0.05 mL, 5% w/w in water and 1-propanol) under sonication for 30 min. The photocurrent measurements were conducted with a CHI660C workstation. The light source was an LED monochromatic point lamp (3 W, 420 nm). The light spot effective area on the working electrode was set as 2 cm2 and 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution was used as the electrolyte. The open circuit voltages were set as the initial bias voltages in the transient photocurrent response tests.
2.3 Photocatalytic experiments
The experiments were performed in a sealed quartz bottle containing 2.5 mg of catalyst dispersed in 3 mL of acetonitrile and 2 mL of water with 0.5 mL of TEOA as a sacrificial reagent. Then, the mixture was purged with CO2 for 10 min and then sealed at 1 atm CO2. A 300 W Xe lamp (Zhong Jiao Jin Yuan, Model CEL-HXF300) was used as the light source. After irradiation, the released gas (400 μL) was collected by syringe from the headspace of the reactor and analyzed by using a gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, GC-2014, Japan, with ultrapure Ar as a carrier gas) equipped with a TDX-01(5 Å molecular sieve column) and a flame ionization detector (FID).
The apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for CO evolution was measured using monochromatic visible light (420 nm) and calculated by using the following equation:  N = yield of CO (mol), NA = 6.02 × 10−23 mol−1, I = the intensity of irradiation light (5.54 × 10−3 W cm−2), A = irradiation area (3.14 cm2), t = photoreaction time (3600 s), and λ = the wavelength of monochromatic light (420 × 10−9 m).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) of PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni was performed to determine the crystalline structure. The simulation of the crystalline structure of PD-COF-23 was done using the software Materials Studio 7.0. Its unit cell parameters were calculated as a = 47.31 Å, b = 48.24 Å, c = 3.73 Å; α = γ = 90°, and β = 88.46°. It was found that the experimental data are consistent with the simulated PXRD pattern using the AA stacking mode (Rwp = 4.30% and Rp = 3.33%) but not the AB stacking mode (Rwp = 42.9% and Rp = 33.4%). The strong and sharp peak at 2.65° is assigned to the diffraction of the 110 plane, indicating the high crystallinity of PD-COF-23 (Fig. 1a). The other diffraction peaks at 2.73°, 5.30° and 7.98° correspond to the 200, 220 and 330 planes, respectively. Similarly for PD-COF-23-Ni (Fig. 1b), the diffraction peaks at 2.64°, 2.75°, 5.28° and 7.92° are assigned to the 110, 200, 220 and 330 planes, respectively. Both the as-prepared COFs showed high crystallinity as indicated by their PXRD patterns.
 Fig. 1  Experimental and simulated XRD spectra of PD-COF-23 (a) and PD-COF-23-Ni (b). 
The structural integrity of the as-prepared COFs was confirmed by FT-IR and 13C CP-MAS solid-state NMR spectroscopy. Both PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni show one band around 1612 cm−1 corresponding to the CN stretching mode in their Fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR) (Fig. S1†). In the13C CP-MAS solid-state NMR spectrum (Fig. S2a and b†), the absence of any aldehyde signal, that is expected to appear at 180–200 ppm, indicates the total consumption of DPP, and the signal at around 164 ppm for the two COFs is attributed to the formation of a CN bond from the Schiff-base reaction. Their XPS spectra also clearly indicate the peaks of N 1s, O 1s, and C 1s for PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni (Fig. S2†). The three species of nitrogen in the high resolution N 1s spectrum at 400.02 eV, 401 eV and 401.7 eV are ascribed to pyrrolic N, pyrrolic NH and imine CN in PD-COF-23, respectively (Fig. S2b†). In the N 1s spectrum of PD-COF-23-Ni (Fig. S2c†), the new peak at 401.9 eV is attributed to N–Ni. Specifically, the binding energies of 856.7 eV and 874.7 eV are assigned to Ni 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 (Fig. S2d†) in PD-COF-23-Ni.33,41
As shown in Fig. S3(a–d),† the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface areas were measured as 181 m2 g−1 for PD-COF-23 and 196 m2 g−1 for PD-COF-23-Ni, corresponding to two types of pore sizes at around 1.8 nm and from 4.1 nm to 4.2 nm, which arise from the channel of A–A stacking in the frameworks. The relatively low BET surface areas indicate a low N2 uptake for the two as-prepared COFs, which is attributed to the tight staking and side chains protruding into the pores. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals the high thermal stability of PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni with less than 5% weight loss in a N2 atmosphere up to 320 °C and 380 °C, respectively (Fig. S4†). Obviously, Ni(II) coordination in PD-COF-23-Ni effectively strengthens its skeleton with a higher thermal stability than that of PD-COF-23.40,42 In addition, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis shows that PD-COF-23 crystallizes in a block-like structure with sizes of 5–20 μm (Fig. 2), while PD-COF-23-Ni exists as multilayer nanosheets. The self-assembly synthetic control, which was beneficial for increasing the layer planarity, rendered the frameworks with large domain sizes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the two COFs were recorded with further magnification at the nano-meter scale to explore the internal morphology of the COFs (Fig. S6†). Due to the strong π–π stacking interactions between adjacent layers, an aggregated sheet-like structure with uniform porosity was observed for both COFs.

Owing to the formation of overall conjugated frameworks by the Schiff-base reaction, absorption edges at around 743 and 727 nm in the visible region were observed for PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni respectively (Fig. S7†). Subsequently, their optical band gaps were determined by using the Kubelka–Munk equation with values of 1.67 eV and 1.70 eV, respectively. Moreover, the photocurrent response of PD-COF-23-Ni was obviously higher than that of PD-COF-23, which is indicative of efficient photogenerated hole–electron pair separation and the greater availability of electrons on the surface of the former (Fig. 3a).43 This result proves that PD-COF-23-Ni is a better photocatalyst than PD-COF-23.

3.2 Photocatalytic reaction
The visible light driven photocatalytic CO2 reduction was investigated using either PD-COF-23 or PD-COF-23-Ni as a photocatalyst and triethanolamine (TEOA) as a sacrificial electron donor. As shown in Fig. 3c, the photocatalytic CO evolution rate was 20.9 μmol g−1 h−1 for PD-COF-23 and 40.0 μmol g−1 h−1 for PD-COF-23-Ni in 25 h. Ni(II) in PD-COF-23-Ni acts as a catalytic center to fix the absorbed CO2 molecules, leading to an enhanced performance of CO2 reduction. Cyclic photocatalytic experiments for PD-COF-23-Ni were carried out using the catalyst recycled from the former reaction by centrifugation and a drying process under vacuum. As shown in Fig. 3d, the photocatalytic CO evolution rate reached up to 38.8 μmol g−1 h−1 in the second cycle and 35.3 μmol g−1 h−1 in the third cycle within 3 hours. The result indicates a considerable stability of PD-COF-23-Ni under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the selectivity of CO2 reduction into CO is as high as 99% with only a trace amount of CH4 detected for the systems of both COFs. In addition, no other by-products (H2, CH3OH, and HCOOH) were detected from the reactions. The control reaction was also carried out under only an Ar atmosphere, and no CO was generated due to the absence of CO2. This means that CO generated in the photocatalytic systems comes from CO2. At the same time, no CO evolution was detected when using water or trimethylamine as a sacrificial electron donor. In addition, the apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) for the CO evolution was found to be 0.036% for PD-COF-23 and 0.079% for PD-COF-23-Ni. It is known that efficient charge separation and transfer play an important role in the aqueous photocatalytic CO2 reduction. The conduction band (CB) edge of photocatalysts should be more negative than the CO2 reduction potential (CO/CO2, theoretically −0.53 V vs. NHE, pH = 7 and −4.37 eV vs. Ev, vacuum level), and the valence band (VB) edge should be more positive than the redox potential of H2O (O2/H2O, theoretically 0.82 V vs. NHE, pH = 7 and −5.67 eV vs. Ev). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S8†) was used to determine the absolute positions of the conduction and valence band edges of PD-COF-23 (corresponding to their LUMO and HOMO energy levels, respectively). The VB of PD-COF-23 was calculated to be −5.28 eV, therefore the CB was calculated to be −3.61 eV based on the result of UV-DRS. Similarly, the VB and CB of PD-COF-23-Ni were calculated to be −5.85 eV and −4.14 eV, respectively. The energy-band alignments, as presented in Fig. 3b, indicate that both PD-COF-23 and PD-COF-23-Ni fulfil the energy band requirements for the artificial photosynthesis of CO2.
3.3 Mechanism
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were applied to understand the photoexcitation process and catalytic reaction mechanisms. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) mainly distributes along the electron donating TAPP fragment, while the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) locates on the DPP segments. The sufficient electron density separation of the HOMO and LUMO energy levels enables the electron transfer from the TAPP to DPP fragments upon visible light irradiation (Fig. 4a). One possible reaction route was proposed for the photocatalytic reaction based on PD-COF-23-Ni. As shown in Fig. 4b, the TAPP-DPP repeating unit undergoes charge separation and electron transfer from TAPP to DPP, and subsequently, CO2 is reduced to CO by the two electrons accumulated near DPP. Meanwhile, TEOA regenerates TAPP-DPP. In another potential reaction route, the Ni(II)-porphyrin unit acts as both photosensitizer and catalytic center.44,45 Due to insufficient conjugation between TAPP and DPP, porphyrin fragments might act as an internal reductive quenching cycle, first absorb visible light to form the excited NiTAPP*, then associate with TEOA to form MTAPP˙−, and lastly, reduce CO2 to CO at the Ni(II) centers. In this case, TEOA plays an important role as the sacrificial electron donor to prevent the charge recombination on the porphyrin fragments and achieve a complete photocatalytic cycle. As a result, the Ni(II) incorporated PD-COF-23-Ni shows a higher activity than PD-COF-23 in the photocatalytic CO2 reduction.

4. Conclusions
In summary, donor–acceptor 2D COFs of PD-COF-23 and PDCOF-23-Ni were successfully developed for visible light photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO with high selectivity. Typically, PD-COF-23-Ni showed a higher CO production efficiency of 40.0 μmol g−1 h−1 than PD-COF-23 (20.9 μmol g−1 h−1) within an operation time of 25 h. Due to the donor–acceptor structure configuration of the two COFs, the electron–hole pairs upon visible light irradiation were separated and transported from electron-donating TAPP or NiTAPP to electron deficient DPP for CO2 reduction. On the other hand, NiTAPP could also reduce CO2 to CO at the Ni(II) centers through an internal reductive quenching cycle, in which NiTAPP acted as both the photosensitizer and catalytic center.
