    , Accepted 13th April 2018First published on 17th April 2018AbstractWe designed and synthesized a metal-free organic sensitizer based on phenothiazine as the core moiety for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). The structure of the donor–π–bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) dye 3-(5-(7-((E)-3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)-10-octyl-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (TMPTZT) has tri-methoxy phenyl as a donor segment on a phenothiazine core and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor group. In this study, we investigated the influence of iodide/triiodide and Co(bpy)32+/3+ complexes as redox electrolytes on the DSC device performance. The maximal monochromatic incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) reached a value of 70%. The solar light to electrical energy conversion efficiency of the devices with a volatile solvent based iodide/triiodide electrolyte reached up to 5.1% at AM 1.5G illumination, whereas the devices with Co(bpy)32+/3+ and ionic liquid electrolytes showed efficiencies of 4.9% and 4.5%, respectively. The DSC devices were characterized using charge extraction and Voc decay techniques to understand the difference in the photovoltaic performance of this metal free organic dye with these three types of redox electrolytes.
1. Introduction
The increasing world demand for energy and the large consumption of hydrocarbon based products that negatively impact the environment have alerted many scientists to the necessity of seeking energy sources alternative to fossil fuels. Solar light used as a renewable energy source is a viable solution when the light can be harnessed efficiently for the production of electricity. Since the emergence of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) in 19901 as a reasonable low-cost solar technology, many efforts have been made towards enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) to obtain a value of up to 14%.2 Solar cell devices using volatile triiodide/iodide (I3−/I−) redox couple liquid electrolytes, which lower the stability of the devices and thus their performances, are unsatisfactory due to the leakage of the volatile solvent. Investigation of the PCE of DSCs using alternative electrolytes to achieve better device stability has consequently been of practical interest. Ionic liquid electrolytes are liquids at room temperature, which are nonvolatile, with high electrical conductivity, etc., and can thus be used in DSCs3,4 to achieve greater stability. Recent studies investigating the replacement of the I3−/I− redox system by a Co(bpy)32+/3+ complex have indicated the viability of the data obtained as such a system offers low visible light absorption, high device stability and a high open circuit potential.5
The interest in metal-free organic sensitizers to replace “traditional” metal containing dyes used in DSCs stems from ecological and economic reasons. Wide interest in utilizing the phenothiazine heterocyclic to replace these metal-based compounds has been demonstrated owing to its suitable electronic (as a good electron donor) and geometrical features. Studies have indicated that the non-planar butterfly conformation of phenothiazine is beneficial for DSCs as such a geometry can inhibit excimer formation.6–8 The N-alkyl group would also further enhance the charge separation at the oxide–electrolyte interface. Such favourable features prompted researchers to attempt to exploit this moiety in the design of new DSCs.9–15 The majority of DSCs based on metal free organic dyes are of donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) type. In order to avoid dye aggregation and excimer formation, it is necessary to design a molecule with a non-planar geometry as much as possible. One attractive idea is to employ the D–D–π–A skeleton, which would benefit the device performance by lowering the charge recombination process and formation of aggregates.12,16–18 Therefore, it was envisioned that developing a dye molecule based on phenothiazine with a tri-methoxy phenyl auxiliary donor and thiophene acrylonitrile as an acceptor group would furnish a new dye with enhanced PCE. The present study reports on the synthesis of this new phenothiazine dye and the investigation into the influence of iodide/triiodide and Co(bpy)32+/3+ complexes as redox electrolytes on the DSC device performance in the presence of this D–D–π–A dye.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis of dye
The synthesis of 3-(5-(7-((E)-3,4,5-trimethoxystyryl)-10-octyl-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl)thiophen-2-yl)-2-cyanoacrylic acid (TMPTZT) is shown in Scheme 1. Compound 119 was brominated to give compound 2, which was reduced with NaBH4 to afford the corresponding alcohol 3. Compound 3 was converted to Wittig reagent 4 that was condensed with tri-methoxybenzaldehyde to give the corresponding styryl compound 5. The Suzuki coupling reaction of compound 5 with (5-formylthiophen-2-yl)boronic acid gave the corresponding compound 6. The Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 6 with cyanoacetic acid gave compound 7, TMPTZT.

2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
A UV-Vis absorption spectrum of TMPTZT (2 × 10−5 M) in CHCl3 is presented in Fig. 1 and its molar extinction coefficient is reported in Table 1. TMPTZT exhibited two overlapping bands centered at 345 nm and one visible band at 459 nm. The first ones are due to π–π* transition, whereas the visible one is due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the phenothiazinyl donor moiety and the cyanoacrylic acid and acceptor. It is noteworthy to observe that the overlapping bands have molar absorptivity higher than that of the ICT band owing to the impact of the styryl moiety that acts as an additional chromophore. To estimate the optical band gap Eg, the onset absorption at 560 nm was obtained from Fig. 1, and the Eg value was calculated to be 2.21 eV.

The redox potential of TMPTZT was measured by applying cyclic voltammetry (CV) in CHCl3 solution in the presence of 0.10 M n-Bu4NPF4 as supporting electrolyte, using a three-electrode cell. The CV was repeated thrice without changes, indicating that TMPTZT was electrochemically stable under these conditions. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of TMPTZT was determined from CV analysis. From the CV, the onset oxidation potential (Eox, onset) value of TMPTZT was estimated to be 0.96 V and its HOMO energy level was calculated to be −5. 36 eV using the equation EHOMO = −(Eox, onset vs. Ag/AgCl + 4.4) eV.20 Having both the HOMO and Eg values, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy could be estimated using the equation ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg.20Table 1 summarizes the optical and electrochemical data of TMPTZT. As the LUMO energy value of TMPTZT is higher than that of the TiO2 (−3.90 eV) conduction band by more than 0.2 eV, good photoelectron injection is ensured.21,22 On the other hand, the HOMO energy level of TMPTZT is less negative than those of I−/I3− (−4.85 eV)23 and Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox electrolytes (−5.06 eV), indicating that there is enough driving force for dye regeneration.
2.3 Photovoltaic performance
Double layered TiO2 films were applied for DSC devices, consisting of an 8 μm transparent mesoporous TiO2 (20 nm particle size) film covered with a 5 μm light-scattering layer (400 nm particle size). The double layer TiO2 film was stained by immersing into a 0.1 mM solution of TMPTZT dye in a tert-butanol/acetonitrile mixture (1:1 v/v) and kept for 14 h at room temperature. Platinized FTO glass was used as the counter electrode. We investigated three electrolytes containing two different redox electrolytes: E1 is a volatile solvent based I−/I3− redox electrolyte, E2 is an I−/I3− based ionic liquid electrolyte, and E3 is a Co(bpy)32+/3+ based redox electrolyte in acetonitrile solvent. The photovoltaic data of DSC devices A, B and C corresponding to electrolytes E1, E2 and E3, respectively, are presented in Table 2. The J–V curves and IPCE spectra of devices A, B and C are shown in Fig. 2. The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.1% was achieved with device A, measured at an AM 1.5G irradiance of 100 mW cm−2. The devices, A and B, containing I−/I3− based redox electrolytes yielded almost similar PCEs due to comparable Jsc and Voc values, whereas the Jsc of device C is lower and Voc is higher compared to devices A and B. Even though the redox energy of electrolyte E3 is 200 mV more positive than E1 and E2, the Voc of device C is only 29 and 30 mV higher than those of devices A and B, respectively. The Voc of a device mainly depends on the energy difference of redox electrolyte and the Fermi level of the photoanode and the rate of the back reaction of conduction band photoinjected electrons with the oxidized form of the redox mediator. This scenario is further investigated using the following charge extraction measurements.

E2 is an ionic liquid electrolyte that contains DMII/EMII/EMITCB/I2/NBB/GNCS (molar ratio 12:12:16:1.67:3.33:0.67) and sulfolane (1:1 v/v).

 Fig. 2  (a) The current density–voltage (J–V) curves under standard AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, and (b) the incident photon-to-collected electron efficiency (IPCE) curves of devices A, B, and C. 
Integration of the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves for E1 and E2 over the AM1.5G solar emission gave Jsc values around 10.2 mA cm−2, and 7.8 mA cm−2 for E3, in good agreement with the measured values. The reason for the higher Jsc for E1 and E2 becomes clear when taking a closer look at the IPCE spectra of the two electrolytes (Fig. 2(b)). In both cases the TMPTZT dye accomplishes IPCE values reaching 55% near the maximum absorption peak at 520 nm. However, for the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox mediator, E3 electrolyte, the IPCE spectrum is lower compared to the I/I3-based electrolytes. The IPCE spectra of DSCs can be expressed as the product of the light harvesting efficiency, electron injection efficiency, dye regeneration efficiency and charge collection efficiency. As we applied the same TMPTZT dye and the same thickness of the electrodes there will be no difference in the light harvesting efficiency and the photoinduced electron injection into the TiO2 film conduction band. The differences in the IPCEs likely originate from the differences in the dye regeneration and recombination rates with the different electrolytes.
2.4 Charge extraction measurements
To understand the differences in the photovoltaic data with the different electrolytes, we performed charge extraction experiments at the open-circuit potential. Because the redox potentials of cobalt complexes and iodide/triiodide are different, the quasi-Fermi level (EF) of the TiO2 film, which is calculated from the Voc by subtracting the redox potential of the redox couple expressed with respect to the vacuum level, is plotted against the extracted charge, as shown in Fig. 3. At the same value of extracted charge, the EF of device C is smaller than those of devices A and B, which indicates that device C has more surface states in the TiO2 film. Note that the electrolyte compositions of the solar cells are different. The cobalt electrolyte E3 in device C contains Li+ ions, which are known to cause trap states on the surface of TiO2, while the electrolytes in devices A and B are lithium ion free and have a similar composition that gives a comparable profile of extracted charge dependent EF.

V
oc decay measurements indicate the electrons in TiO2 recombining with redox species in the electrolyte under open-circuit conditions of the device. Because the concentration of electrons in TiO2 is closely associated with the EF of TiO2, we plot the time-dependent EF to indicate the decaying traces of electron concentration in TiO2, as shown in Fig. 4. All the traces show a sharp decay followed by a slow decay. Device C shows a faster decay than the other two devices, indicating a faster interfacial charge recombination between electrons in TiO2 and the electrolyte. The lower EF and faster charge recombination in device C explain why the Voc of device C is only 29 mV higher than those of devices A and B (even though the E3 redox energy is 0.2 V more positive than those of E1 and E2). Device A shows a slightly slower decay than device B. The comparable surface state distribution and interfacial charge recombination in devices A and B explain their similar Voc under full sunlight. It is known that some organic dyes with bulky donors have much higher Voc and exhibit better device performance with the cobalt redox electrolytes than with iodide/triiodide redox electrolytes.24–26 In contrast, the TMPTZT dye with E3 shows only a slight increase in Voc as mentioned above due to the smaller size of the donor moiety, which leads to an increased recombination rate.

Fig. 5 shows the dependence of extracted charge on the short-circuit current as obtained from short-circuit charge extraction measurements. Device C has a notably lower extracted charge at a photocurrent equal to that of either device A or B. This result indicates that device C has a lower charge collection yield because of a speedy interfacial charge recombination, which thus leads to lower Jsc and IPCE values. Device B has a slightly higher extracted charge than that of device A, which is attributed to the slower charge recombination in device B. This result explains the slightly higher Jsc of device B than that of device A under the full sunlight condition.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we synthesized a new D–D–π–A dye (TMPTZT) and applied it as a sensitizer in DSC devices using three different redox electrolytes. We rationalize the unexpected finding that the TMPTZT dye in conjunction with the cobalt complex based redox electrolyte gives a lower PCE than with I−/I3− electrolytes, because of an increase in the surface states of TiO2, an increased recombination rate and a lower charge collection yield in device C. In future dye design, the device performance can be enhanced by designing new bulky donors on the phenothiazine dyes.
4. Experimental
4.1 Materials and instruments
All solvents and reagents were of the highest purity available, purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company and used as received. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3- or DMSO-d6 solution on a Bruker Avance 400 or 600 or 850 MHz spectrometer. Infrared spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer. Mass spectroscopy was performed using Agilent GC 7000 mass spectrometers. UV absorption spectra were determined on a Shimadzu UV-Vis Spectrophotometer. Electrochemical potentials were measured by Cyclic Voltammetry (CV), using three electrode cells on an Autolab model PGSTAT302N (Eco Chemie B. V., The Netherlands) coupled with a 663 VA Stand for Metrohm Autolab Potentiostats/Galvanostats and IME663 is used to control. The controller electrochemical system is GPES software. Measurements were made under nitrogen in one compartment at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The Ag/AgCl in KCl (3 M) solution and an auxiliary platinum wire were utilized as reference and counter electrodes, while a dye solution in chloroform containing tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (NBu4PF6, 0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte was used as the working electrode.
4.2 Dye sensitized solar cell fabrication
State-of-the-art double layer mesoporous TiO2 layer (8 μm thickness of 20 nm particles (DSL 18NR-T, DYESOL) plus 5 μm thickness of 400 nm light scattering particles (HPW-400NRD, CCIC)) were deposited on FTO conducting glass (Solar-4 mm, Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Ltd). The double layer TiO2 film was sensitized by immersing it into a solution of the TMPTZT dye (0.1 mM) and chenodeoxycholic acid (1.25 mM) in a tert-butanol/acetonitrile mixture (1:1 v/v) for 14 h at room temperature. The compositions of the electrolytes: E1 is a volatile solvent based I−/I3− redox electrolyte containing 1.0 M 1,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMII), 0.03 M iodine, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine in a valeronitrile/acetonitrile mixture (15:85 v/v). E2 is an ionic liquid electrolyte that contains DMII/EMII/EMITCB/I2/NBB/GNCS (molar ratio 12:12:16:1.67:3.33:0.67) and sulfolane (1:1 v/v). The composition of the third electrolyte E3 is 0.22 M [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)2, 0.05 M [Co(bpy)3](B(CN)4)3, 0.1 M LiClO4, and 0.2 M tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. A thermally platinized FTO conducting glass (LOF TECH 7, Pilkington) was used as a counter electrode. An antireflection film (ARCTOP, Mihama Co.) was attached on the photoanode side.
4.3 Photovoltaic performance measurements
For measuring the photovoltaic parameters of the DSCs, a solar simulator equipped with a 450 W xenon light source (Osram XBO 450) with a filter (Schott 113) was used, whose power was regulated to the AM 1.5 solar standard using a reference Si photodiode equipped with a color-matched filter (KG-3, Schott) to reduce the spectral mismatch in the 350–750 nm region between the simulated light and AM 1.5 to <4%. The measurement-settling time between applying a voltage and measuring a current density for the J–V characterization of DSCs was fixed at 80 ms with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The photocurrent action spectra were measured with an Incident Photon-to-Current Conversion Efficiency (IPCE) test system. The modulation frequency used was about 2 Hz and light from a 300W Xenon lamp (ILC Technology, USA) was focused through a computer controlled Gemini-180 double monochromator (John Yvon Ltd, UK). A white light bias was applied to bring the total light intensity on the testing device closer to operating conditions. A black mask was applied on the DSCs, so the illuminated active area of DSCs was fixed at 0.159 cm2.
4.4 Charge extraction measurements
Open-circuit and short-circuit charge extraction measurements and the open-circuit photovoltage decay measurements were performed with the DN-AE01 Dyenamo toolbox. A white light-emitting diode (LED; Luxeon Star 1W) was used as a light source. The transient photo-voltage response of the DSCs was recorded using a 16-bit resolution digital acquisition board (National Instruments) in combination with a current amplifier (Stanford Research Systems RS570) and a custom electromagnetic switching system. For the charge extraction measurements, the DSCs under the open-circuit or short-circuit conditions were illuminated for 5s at a bias light intensity; after that, the LED was turned off. The solar cell was short-circuited and the current density was read and integrated over time. The open-circuit photovoltage decay was recorded after the bias light was turned off.
