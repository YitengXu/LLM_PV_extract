    , Accepted 3rd October 2014First published on 6th October 2014AbstractTwo novel organic sensitizers (FNE55 and FNE56) containing a 6,7-difluoroquinoxaline moiety have been designed and synthesized for quasi-solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). For comparison, an organic dye, FNE54, without fluorine has also been synthesized. The effects of the introduction of fluorine on the absorption, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties have been systematically investigated. Upon the incorporation of fluorine in the quinoxaline unit, the electron-withdrawing ability is strengthened, which results in the enhanced push–pull interactions and thus narrows the energy band gap. The absorption maximum wavelength in toluene solution bathochromically shifts from 504 nm for FNE54 to 511 nm for FNE55, and further to 525 nm for FNE56. However, although the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMOs) are lowered down after the introduction of fluorines, the driving force for the photo-excited electrons from their excited states to the semiconductor conduction band is still sufficient. Consequently, the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on FNE56 exhibits a highest power conversion efficiency of 8.2%, which is 37% higher than that for FNE54 based quasi-solid-state DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),1 regarded as one of the most promising photovoltaic devices, have been extensively investigated due to their high theoretical efficiency, facile fabrication processes, and potential low cost. Over the past two decades, continuous research efforts have contributed to the significant advances in the DSSC performance.2 To date, DSSC devices employing a zinc-porphyrin co-sensitized system have shown an efficiency record of 13% under a standard global air mass of 1.5.3 However, most highly efficient DSSCs have been realized with volatile organic liquid electrolytes, which may limit their outdoor applications. In view of promising commercial applications, alternatively, quasi-solid-state DSSCs4 with a non-flowing and non-volatile electrolyte have shown considerably improved long-term stability as there is less or no possibility of electrolyte leakage.
To achieve high DSSC performance, in addition to the innovation and optimization in the device structure and processing, one of the most critical contributions is the material development. Therefore, substantial efforts have focused on the optimization of metal-free organic sensitizers with reduced energy gaps and enhanced molar absorption coefficients. Decreasing the band gap can be achieved by either lowering the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) or raising the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the organic sensitizer, or both. However, a smaller band gap benefits light-harvesting, but may result in insufficient electron injection from the excited state to the titania conduction band due to the unsuitable LUMO levels of the organic sensitizers. Therefore, it is generally considered that a minimum offset of around 0.3 eV between the LUMO of the organic sensitizer and the conduction band edge of the titania semiconductor, which determines the driving force for the excited electron injection, is needed to ensure fast and efficient electron injection.5 As a consequence, tuning the LUMO energy levels of the organic sensitizers with respect to the acceptor is of significant importance to optimize the DSSC performance.
Fluorine is the most electronegative element and the smallest electron-withdrawing group, with a significant influence on inter- and intramolecular interactions through C–F⋯H, F⋯S, and C–F⋯πF interactions.6 Consequently, introduction of fluorine atoms (van der Waals radius, r = 1.35 Å, only slightly larger than hydrogen, r = 1.2 Å) into the conjugation system has small effect on the molecular geometry structure. However, the substitution of fluorine for hydrogen can significantly affect the optoelectronic properties of the π-conjugated molecules due to the lower LUMO levels as compared with the non-fluorinated analogs. As a result, fluorinated conjugated materials have been widely utilized in various applications, such as light-emitting diodes (LED),7 field-effect transistors (FET)8 and bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells (PSC).9 However, there are only a few examples of applying fluorinated compounds in DSSCs.10
Recently, D–A′–π–A featured organic sensitizers,11 where an auxiliary acceptor (A′), such as benzothiadiazole,3,12 diketopyrrolopyrrole,13 pyridopyrazine,14 and quinoxaline,15 is integrated into the traditional D–π–A framework, have been extensively investigated. A bathochromically shifted absorption band of the organic sensitizer can be achieved due to the enhanced donor–acceptor interactions, which results in an increased light harvesting efficiency. Most importantly, tunable HOMO levels along with enhanced photostability of the organic sensitizers can be achieved upon the incorporation of the auxiliary acceptor. Among the various implemented electron-withdrawing groups,3,12–15 the quinoxaline unit has been embedded into the organic sensitizers as an auxiliary electron acceptor for efficient DSSCs by several groups including our group.15 All the previous results indicates that the LUMO levels of the quinoxaline based organic sensitizers can be further lowered down to harvest more solar photons, while the photo-generated electrons can be still effectively injected into the titania conduction band with the presence of enough electron injection driving force. Herein, we report two fluorinated organic sensitizers (FNE55 and FNE56, Fig. 1) containing a 6,7-difluoroquinoxaline moiety as electron acceptor and their applications in quasi-solid-state DSSCs. For comparison, sensitizer FNE54 without fluorine has also been synthesized. The effects of the introduction of fluorine on the absorption, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties have been systematically investigated. It is found that the incorporation of two fluorines on quinoxaline unit have successfully lowered down the LUMO level of the organic sensitizers, which results in the narrowed band gap. On the other hand, the driving force for the photo-excited electrons from their excited states to the semiconductor conduction band is still sufficient. Therefore, FNE56 based quasi-solid-state DSSC displays a highest η of 8.2%, which is 37% higher than that for the quasi-solid-state DSSC based on sensitizer FNE54.

Characterizations

1H NMR (400 MHz), 19F NMR (376 MHz), and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were measured on a Varian Mercury Plus-400 spectrometer. The splitting patterns are designated as follows: s (singlet); d (doublet); t (triplet); q (quartet); m (multiplet). UV-vis absorption spectra of dye solutions and dye-loaded films were recorded with a Shimadzu UV-2550PC spectrophotometer. The film thickness was measured by a surface profiler (Veeco Dektak 150). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed with a CHI660E electrochemical workstation using a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in water-free acetonitrile with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 at room temperature under argon. Dye adsorbed TiO2 film (0.25 cm2) on FTO glass was used as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated by ferrocene, and all potentials mentioned in this work are against normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).
DSSC fabrication and photovoltaic measurements
The quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulting sensitizers (0.3 mM) with coadsorption of deoxycholic acid (10 mM) were constructed according to our previously reported method.15m The gel electrolyte contains 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0 or 0.1 M tert-butylpyridine, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in 3-methoxypropionitrile. The active area is 0.25 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured by recording J–V curves using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of AM1.5G simulated solar light coming from a solar simulator (Oriel-91193 equipped with a 1000 W Xe lamp and an AM1.5G filter). The incident light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell (Newport 91150). The electron lifetimes were measured with intensity modulated photovoltage spectroscopy (IMVS), whereas charge densities at open-circuit were measured using the charge extraction technique. IMVS analysis and charge extraction were carried out on an electrochemical workstation (Zahner XPOT, Germany), which includes a white light emitting diode and corresponding control system. The intensity modulated spectra were measured at room temperature with light intensity ranging from 20 to 120 W m−2, in modulation frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 10 kHz, and with modulation amplitude less than 5% of the light intensity. The electron lifetime was calculated by equation τ = 1/2πfmin, where fmin is the frequency at the top of the semicircle (fmin) in IMVS. Action spectra of the incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for the solar cells were obtained with an Oriel-74125 system (Oriel Instruments). The intensity of monochromatic light was measured with a Si detector (Oriel-71640).
Results and discussion
Synthesis of sensitizers
The synthetic route to sensitizers FNE55, and FNE56 is depicted in Scheme 1, which starts from 5,6-difluoro-4,7-diiodobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (1).16 Through a Stille coupling18 with tributyl(4-hexylthien-2-yl)stannane, the intermediate compound 5,6-difluoro-4,7-bis(4-hexylthien-2-yl)benzo[c]-[1,2,5]thiadiazole (2) was provided. Then, the thiadiazole ring was reduced to two amino groups and further converted to a pyrazine ring by ring-closure condensation with oxalaldehyde and benzyl to produce the key spacer 4b and 4c, respectively. After refluxing with a Vilsmeier reagent,19 the corresponding monoaldehyde-substituted derivatives 6b and 6c were synthesized and then converted to bromides 7b and 7c, respectively, by bromination with NBS. Electron donor, triarylamine, was attached via Suzuki coupling20 with N,N-bis(4-octyloxyphenyl)-(4-(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)phenyl)aniline, which produced the precursors 8b and 8c. In the last step, the obtained precursors were converted to the corresponding sensitizers FNE55 and FNE56, respectively, by Knoevenagel condensation21 with cyanoacetic acid through refluxing acetonitrile in the presence of piperidine. Correspondingly, reference sensitizer FNE54 was synthesized similarly from the non-fluoro substituted starting material 5,8-dibromoquinoxaline (5). All the target sensitizers were characterized by 1H, 19F, 13C NMR spectroscopy, and HRMS spectroscopy and were found to be consistent with the proposed structures.

Photophysical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2) of the target sensitizers were recorded in toluene solutions (∼10−5 M) and on TiO2 films (∼3 μm). The corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. It can be found that all the sensitizers exhibit two distinct absorption bands. The absorption band in the ultraviolet region corresponds to the π–π* electron transitions of the conjugated backbone, while the other one in the visible region is assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the electron-donating moiety to the electron-withdrawing moiety. As shown in Fig. 2a, sensitizer FNE54 displays the maximum absorption wavelength at 504 nm in the toluene solution. Upon the incorporation of two fluorine atoms in the quinoxaline unit, sensitizer FNE55 displays a slightly bathochromically shifted absorption maximum at 511 nm. However, it should be noted that the ICT band of sensitizer FNE55 is much broader, and the absorption on-set is bathochromically shifted by more than 20 nm as compared to that for sensitizer FNE54. This is noticeably due to the introduced two fluorines on the quinoxaline unit, which strengthen the ICT interactions in sensitizer FNE55 and result in the reduced band gap. Moreover, when two phenyl rings are incorporated at the 2,3-postion of quinoxaline unit, the absorption maximum further bathochromically shifts to 525 nm, which is owned to the extended π-conjugation in the spacer part upon the introduction of two phenyl rings.

The UV-vis absorption spectra for the dye-loaded TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 2b. The absorption maximum wavelength bathochromically shifts from 480 nm for FNE54 to 492 nm for FNE55, and further to 501 nm for FNE56, which display the same trend for the absorption maxima as those for their absorption spectra in toluene solutions. Furthermore, in comparison to the maximum absorption band of the sensitizers in toluene solutions, all the sensitizers display a hypsochromically shifted absorption maximum around 20 nm on TiO2 films. This phenomenon has been observed for most of organic sensitizers and is due to the deprotonation of cyanoacrylic acid group.12b,14,15h,m However, unlike most reported D–π–A systems, where the hypsochromic shift for absorption maximum from the solution to the dye loaded TiO2 film is much larger, the slight hypsochromic shift in this case is obviously due to the weakened deprotonation effect caused by the additional quinoxaline acceptor. After anchoring sensitizers onto TiO2 surface, although the anchor group was deprotonated, the ICT from the electron donor to the inserted quinoxaline moiety was not weakened significantly, and therefore only a slight hypsochromic shift could be observed. This phenomenon is similar to the previously reported D–A′–π–A featured organic dyes.11
Electrochemical properties
To determine the oxidation potential of the organic sensitizers and thermodynamically evaluate the possibility of sensitizer regeneration, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a typical three-electrode electrochemical cell with TiO2 films stained with sensitizer as the working electrode in a solution of tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M) in water-free acetonitrile with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. As shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1, the HOMO level, corresponding to the first half-wave oxidation potential, is determined to be 0.96, 1.00, and 1.01 V (vs. normal hedrogen electrode, NHE) for sensitizers FNE54, FNE55, and FNE56, respectively. The close HOMO values for the three dyes are not difficult to be understood, since they originate from the oxidation of the same triarylamine moiety. These values are much more positive than the redox potential for I−/I3− redox couples (∼0.4 V vs. NHE), indicating that the reduction of the oxidized dyes with I− ions is thermodynamically feasible. Then, the LUMO energy level was estimated from eqn (1). LUMO = HOMO – ΔE(1)where, ΔE is the energy gap between the HOMO and LUMO levels and is derived from the wavelength at 10% maximum absorption intensity for the dye-loaded TiO2 film.22 Correspondingly, the LUMO levels for sensitizers FNE54, FNE55, and FNE56, are calculated to be −1.07, −0.98, and −0.91 V (vs. NHE), respectively. This suggests that the driving force of the electron injection from their excited states for all the sensitizers is still sufficient after the incorporation of fluorines into the molecular backbone of the organic sensitizers.
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of the dye-loaded TiO2 films. 
Theoretical approach
To investigate the geometrical structures and electronic properties of the organic dye isomers, density functional calculations were conducted with the Gaussian 03 program using B3LYP method and 6-31G* basis set.23 As shown in Fig. 4, for all the resulting dyes, the HOMO extensively distributes over the π-system of the donor part, while the LUMO delocalizes over the A–π–A moiety with a large composition on the anchoring group, where the electron is close to the TiO2 semiconductor. Moreover, the distributions of HOMO and LUMO are overlapped within the quinoxaline unit and the neighboured thiophene ring, indicating that the photo-excited electrons could be successively transferred from the donor moiety to the quinoxaline unit, then transferred to the cyanoacetic acid subunit, and finally into TiO2.

Solar cell performance
The quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulting sensitizers (0.3 mM) with coadsorption of deoxycholic acid (10 mM) were constructed using a gel electrolyte containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.1 M I2, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, and 5 wt% poly(vinylidenefluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) in 3-methoxypropionitrile. To evaluate the influence of the introduced fluorines on the DSSC performance, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs were fabricated with or without 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, 0.1 M) as additive in the gel electrolyte. The solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of DSSCs were measured by recording the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics at simulated AM1.5G solar light (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Table 2, all the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the electrolyte with TBP display higher Jsc and Voc values as compared with those for the DSSCs based on the electrolyte without TBP. The increased Jsc values are probably due to the reduced charge recombination rate and decreased current loss caused by the coating of TBP on TiO2 nanoparticles. The higher Voc values are due to the negative shift of the conduction band of TiO2 caused by the adsorption of TBP on TiO2 surface, which enlarges the energy level difference between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential under light irradiation.24 These results suggests that upon the incorporation of fluorines in the organic dye molecules, the offset between the LUMO level of the organic sensitizer and the conduction band edge of titania semiconductor is still sufficient to ensure a fast and efficient electron injection. Consequently, the highest performance was achieved for FNE56 based quasi-solid-state DSSCs, which provided a Jsc of 17.76 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.676 V, and a FF of 0.68, respectively, corresponding to a η of 8.2% (Fig. 5), which is one of the highest values for organic dye based quasi-solid-state DSSCs, reported so far.

Action spectra of the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCE) as a function of incident wavelength for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs were recorded and are shown in Fig. 6. All the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulting sensitizers display the highest IPCE values of over 80%. However, the IPCE spectrum for the DSSCs based on FNE55 and FNE56, respectively, is much broader than that for FNE54, which is in good agreement with their absorption spectra (Fig. 2) and is beneficial to light-harvesting and photocurrent generation. With an extended IPCE response, the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on sensitizers FNE55 and FNE56 containing fluorine provide higher photogenerated currents as compared with FNE54 based DSSCs.
 Fig. 6  IPCE spectra for the quasi-solid-state DSSCs with TBP in the electrolyte. 
To explain the Voc difference among the quasi-solid-state DSSCs, the electron lifetime against charge density for the DSSCs was investigated, since Voc is related to the conduction band position of TiO2 and the charge recombination rate in DSSCs.25 The electron lifetime was calculated by eqn (2):26 τ = (2πfmin)−1(2)where, fmin is the frequency at the top of the semicircle (fmin) measured by IMVS. Fig. 7 shows the electron lifetime as a function of charge density at open circuit. It can be found that at the same charge density, FNE56 based quasi-solid-state DSSC displays the longest electron lifetime. This is probably due to the two phenyl rings substituted at 2,3-positions of quinoxaline unit, which have weakened the intermolecular interactions and therefore have suppressed the charge recombination between electrons in TiO2 film and electron acceptors, as reported by Zhu et al.15e The reduced charge recombination rate constant reduces electron loss at open circuit. Since the conduction band positions are generally identical for the DSSCs based on sensitizers with similar chemical structures, when more electrons are accumulated in TiO2, the Fermi level moves upward and therefore Voc gets larger.

Long-term stability is considered as an important requirement for evaluating the practical application of the DSSC in the future. Therefore, the stability of the quasi-solid-state DSSCs based on the resulting sensitizers was recorded over a period of 1000 h under one sun soaking. Fig. 8 displays the photovoltaic performance parameters of sensitizer FNE56 based quasi-solid-state DSSCs under sunlight soaking. It can be found that the Jsc, Voc, and FF parameters slightly change during the DSSC operation. This is probably due to the further infiltration of the quasi-solid-state electrolyte in the mesoporous TiO2 films. The adsorption of TBP on TiO2 surface will negatively shift the conduction band of TiO2,24 which lowers down the driving force for the electron injection but enlarges the energy gap between the Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the electrolyte. As a result, the Jsc drops but Voc increases with sunlight soaking time. Most importantly, the power conversion efficiency remained at 98% of the initial value after 1000 h of one sun soaking, which indicates that the sensitizer FNE56 is sufficiently stable for DSSC applications.

Conclusions
In summary, two organic sensitizers possessing a fluorinated quinoxaline moiety have been designed and successfully synthesized. The incorporation of fluorine in the organic dye molecules successfully lowers down the sensitizer band gap, while maintaining enough driving force for efficient electron injection. Consequently, FNE56 based quasi-solid-state DSSC displays a highest η of 8.2%, which exhibits good long-term stability after continuous sunlight soaking for 1000 h.
