    , Accepted 15th February 2023First published on 16th February 2023AbstractBF4−-doped poly(3-methylthiophene) (P3MT) was formed using electropolymerisation as a hole transport material for inverted perovskite solar cells. The controlled nanopillar morphology of P3MT enables void-less uniform perovskite formation and exhibits conversion efficiency of 11.11%. The P3MT-based cells exhibited superior stability in ambient air to poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid)-based cells.
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), characterised by their high performance, flexibility, light weight, and low cost, have been intensively investigated in the past decade.1,2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has increased from 3.8% in 2009 to 25.7% in 2021,3 approaching that of commercially available monocrystalline silicon solar cells, indicating great potential for commercialisation. Inverted organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (i-PSCs) with low-temperature manufacturing processes and weak hysteresis behaviour in photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves have lower fabrication costs and better reliability in solar cell performance than regular structured PSCs.4–6 However, their relatively lower PCE and lower reproducibility compared to regular-structured PSCs limit their further development. These issues are mainly due to the quality of the hole transport layer (HTL) and the perovskite film deposited on top of the HTL,7,8 which are the most important factors in the development of i-PSCs. The latter is strongly influenced by the surface properties of the underlying HTL.
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) is one of the most widely studied hole transport layers in i-PSCs because of its low process temperature, high light transmission, and moderate electrical conductivity.9–11 However, the hygroscopic and acidic properties of PEDOT:PSS and its energy mismatch with the perovskite layer reduce the device efficiency and stability.11,12 Therefore, novel p-type hole transport materials have been sought so far.
In this study, we focused on the electropolymerisation of hole-transport materials. Conventionally, thiophene-based polymers are obtained via the chemical polymerisation of monomer molecules using oxidants such as ammonium peroxydisulfate.13–16 However, these synthesised polymers always form branched structures and require additional doping processes to improve their conductivity. On the contrary, electropolymerisation yields conductive polymers that strongly adhere to the substrate surface with controllable surface morphology, which can be favourable for perovskite crystal growth.17–19 In addition, anion doping can be performed concurrently with film deposition by including dopants in the solvent.20,21 Therefore, electropolymerisation is considerably more cost-effective and more favourable than conventional chemical polymerisation. In addition, thiophene-based polymers can be electropolymerised in a non-aqueous solvent system22 to avoid water absorption into the film, which would degrade perovskite layers.
Here, we performed electropolymerisation of poly (3-methylthiophene) (P3MT) as the HTL of i-PSCs. The morphology of the P3MT film was controlled by the current density during electropolymerisation, and it was found that the nanopillar morphology is favourable for perovskite crystal growth for a high PCE. i-PSCs with nanopillar P3MT films showed better stability than chemically polymerised PEDOT:PSS-based i-PSCs (PCE was improved by 13% after 6-day storage in ambient air). These findings provide a new approach for low-cost and simple i-PSC production with high stability and comparable performance to conventional devices by controlling the film morphology.
To obtain P3MT doped with BF4−, acetonitrile containing 3-methylthiophene (3MT, 0.1 M) and LiBF4 (0.05 M) was used as the electrolyte. An indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate anode (Geomatec, sheet resistance 5 Ω cm−2, film thickness 300 nm) and Ti mesh cathode were dipped in 15 mL of the solution, and P3MT was deposited at a current density of 1.74, 0.87, and 0.17 mA cm−2 for 8 s.
Formamidine hydroiodide (FAI, 1 M), PbI2 (1.1 M), methylammonium bromide (MABr, 0.2 M), and PbBr2 (0.2 M) were dissolved in a solution of N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1 volume ratio). Then, 4 vol% CsI solution (1.5 M in DMSO solvent) was added.
The surfaces of P3MT films were cleaned using UV-O3 treatment for 1 min. Then, the perovskite precursor (80 μL) was spin-coated at two-step program of 1000 rpm, 10 s → 4000 rpm, 30 s in a nitrogen atmosphere. Chlorobenzene (CB, 500 μL) was dropped 20 s before the end of spin-coating to induce crystallisation of the perovskite. The substrates were annealed at 105 °C for 1 h to form Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite.23 Electron transport layers were formed via spin-coating [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester solution (PCBM, 50 μL, 30 mg mL−1 in CB) at 3000 rpm for 30 s and ZnO nanoparticle ink (Avantama N-10, diluted to 50 vol% with 2-propanol) at 4000 rpm for 30 s in nitrogen. Copper anodes (3 × 3 mm) were deposited using a vacuum evaporation system. For comparison, PEDOT:PSS-based devices were also fabricated. PEDOT:PSS films were formed by spin-coating 200 μL of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios AI 4083) at 6000 rpm for 60 s in ambient air, followed by annealing at 180 °C for 15 min.

J–V curves of the devices were measured with a source meter (R6243, Advantest) under 1 sun irradiation using an optical mask (0.09 cm2) and a solar simulator (WXS-80C-3, WACOM, AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2) (scan speed = 0.1 V s−1, dwell time = 0.1 s) in ambient air at room temperature. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Regulus 8230, HITACHI), atomic force microscopy (E-sweep, Hitachi High-Tech Science), and spectrophotometry (V-770, JASCO) were used for characterisation. Perovskite crystal size was analysed using ImageJ software (version 1.53k, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). We compared the stability of i-PSCs with P3MT and PEDOT:PSS hole-transport materials at 21–26% humidity by repeating the J–V measurements.
We investigated the surface structure of the P3MTs formed using electropolymerisation at different current densities. The surface images of P3MTs formed at 1.74, 0.87, and 0.17 mA cm−2 obtained via SEM are shown in Fig. 1a, c and e, respectively. The P3MT films formed by low current densities (0.17 mA cm−2) showed nanopillar-like morphology (Fig. 1e). As the current density increased, a porous morphology was observed (Fig. 1a and c). This can be explained by the balance between the diffusion of 3MT and film growth. When the film grew slowly at a low current density (0.17 mA cm−2) compared to 3MT diffusion in the electrolyte, a dense nanopillar structure was formed. On the contrary, when we formed the film at high current density, the film grew faster than 3MT diffusion, resulting in porous nanowire (0.87 mA cm−2) and nanoleaf (1.74 mA cm−2) structures.

The roughness of the films was estimated using AFM (Fig. 1b, d and f). The P3MT:nanoleaf films exhibited a root mean square surface roughness (RMS) of 25.72 nm. The surface area of the 2 × 2 μm projected area (S) was 4.866 μm2. P3MT:nanowire exhibited RMS at 17.32 nm and S at 4.496 μm2. P3MT:nanopillars exhibited RMS at 7.470 nm and S at 4.084 μm2. As the current density increased, RMS and S increased owing to the formation of a porous structure.

Fig. 2 shows the absorption spectra of the P3MT films. The light absorption increased as the current density increased owing to film thickness increase.

The surfaces of the perovskite layers deposited on each P3MT film were observed using SEM (Fig. 3a, d and g). Some voids were observed on the surface of the perovskite layers coated on P3MT nanoleaves and nanowires. However, uniform perovskite layers without voids were formed on the P3MT nanopillar film. Furthermore, the crystal size of the perovskite formed on the nanopillars was larger than that of the perovskite formed on the nanoleaves and nanowires (Fig. 3b, c, e, f, h and i). We analysed size distribution of perovskite crystals from the SEM images. The average crystal size was 179 nm (Max:404, Min:37), 217 nm (Max:461, Min:75), and 268 nm (Max:570, Min:88) for P3MT:nanoleaf, for P3MT:nanowire, and for P3MT:nanopillar, respectively. The values show that the P3MT:nanopillar yielded crystals 20–50% larger than other P3MT structures. Especially crystals of large size (>240 nm) increased on P3MT:nanopillar. It is known that the morphology of the under layers significantly affects perovskite crystal growth.24,25 The flat and uniform morphology of nanopillar P3MT enables uniform nucleic generation at the surface of P3MT and is favourable for large crystal generation, resulting in a uniform coating of the perovskite.

I-PSCs were fabricated using P3MT:nanoleaf, P3MT:nanowire, and P3MT:nanopillar HTLs. The J–V curves of the devices measured under 1 sun illumination are shown in Fig. 4a, and their solar cell parameters estimated from the forward voltage scan (−0.2 V → 1.3 V) values are listed in Table 1. J–V curves and solar cell parameters measured under a backward voltage scan (1.3 V → −0.2 V) are shown in Fig. S1 and Table S1.† Among the three HTLs, P3MT:nanopillar gave the highest PCE with an average value of 11.02%. The highest conversion efficiency (11.11%) was achieved.

The series resistance of the P3MT-based perovskite solar cells was calculated from the slope of the J–V curves. The series resistance of the P3MT layer was 13.74 ± 3.05 Ω for P3MT:nanoleaf, 10.47 ± 2.20 Ω for P3MT:nanowire, and 8.83 ± 0.65 Ω for P3MT:nanopillar. Although P3MT:nanoleaves and nanowires exhibited a larger surface area, which provides better contact with perovskite than nanopillars, the nanopillar-based i-PSCs gave less series resistance than the other P3MT structures. It can be assumed that the increase in resistance can be attributed to the presence of voids and crystal defects of perovskites.

Fig. 4b shows the J–V curves of each i-PSCs under dark conditions. The onset potential of P3MT:nanopillar-based PSCs is higher than that of other P3MT-based PSCs, suggesting suppressed recombination owing to fewer voids in the perovskite crystal layers.
The difference in the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) between the P3MT-based i-PSCs can be explained using the photoabsorption of the P3MT layers (Fig. 2). Since P3MT nanoleaves and nanowires have larger absorption in the visible range than nanopillars, JSC value decreased owing to the light screening effect. We can conclude that perovskite crystal growth could be controlled by tuning the surface morphology of P3MT using electropolymerisation and improving the photovoltaic performance of solar cells. Voc and FF were improved by the void-less perovskite film owing to its smooth nanopillar structure.
The standard deviation for the PCE of P3MT:nanopillar-based i-PSCs was 0.19. This value was much smaller than those of the nanoleaves (0.98) and nanowires (0.97). This suggests that uniform perovskite layers can be formed on the nanopillars with high reproducibility.
We compared the photovoltaic performance of the nanopillar P3MT HTL with that of the conventional chemically polymerised PEDOT:PSS (Fig. 5a). P3MT:nanopillar and PEDOT:PSS-based solar cells exhibited a PCE of ∼11%.
 Fig. 5  (a) J–V curves for each i-PSCs device, (b) aging of each typical i-PSCs device stored in air for 6 days (blue line, P3MT:nanopillar; black line, PEDOT:PSS). 
We compared the stability of P3MT:nanopillar-based and PEDOT:PSS-based solar cells under ambient air (RH 21%–26%) (Fig. 5b). The initial PCE value was 10.62% for the P3MT:nanopillar and 11.06% for PEDOT:PSS. After 6 days, 46.1% and 33.0% of the initial PCE were maintained for P3MT:nanopillar and PEDOT:PSS-based cells, respectively. The fast degradation (13% difference) of the PEDOT:PSS-based cells was attributed to the acidity and hygroscopicity of PSS derived from chemical polymerisation. Therefore, devices with P3MT:nanopillar films, which were formed via electropolymerisation and doped using the electrochemical method, have better stability.
In summary, we demonstrated the electropolymerisation of P3MT for its application in HTL of i-PSCs. The surface morphology of P3MT was controlled by the current density during electropolymerisation, and P3MT nanopillar structure was formed at 0.17 mA cm−2. The nanopillar P3MT was favourable for the crystal growth of uniform and void-less perovskite layers and exhibited PCE of 11.11%, which is comparable to that of chemically polymerised PEDOT:PSS, as HTL. The P3MT-based devices showed a 13% slower degradation rate than the PEDOT:PSS-based devices under ambient air (21%–26% RH). These results suggest a new approach to obtain low-cost, high-performance, and high-stability i-PSCs.
