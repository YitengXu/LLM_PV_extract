    , Accepted 21st June 2016First published on 24th June 2016AbstractThe role of the charge transfer (CT) state in interfacial electron transfer in dye-sensitized semiconductor nanocrystals is still poorly understood. To address this problem, femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is used as a probe to investigate the electron injection across a newly synthesized coumarin dye (8-hydroxy-2-oxo-4-phenyl-2 benzo[h]chromene-3-carbonitrile, coded BC5) and ZnO quantum dots (QDs). Steady state and time-resolved spectroscopic measurements reveal that BC5 dye interacts strongly with ZnO QDs in the ground state forming a CT complex. The BC5–ZnO QD complex absorbs more towards red compared to only the dye and QDs, and emits fluorescence due to radiative recombination of photogenerated charges. The formation of charges following the excitation of the CT complex has been demonstrated by observing the signature of dye radical cations and electrons in the conduction band (CB) of the QDs in the TA spectra. The TA signals of these charges grow sharply as a result of ultrafast direct electron injection into the QD. We have monitored the complete dynamics of photogenerated charges by measuring the TA signals of the charges up to a couple of nanoseconds. The injected electrons that are free or shallowly trapped recombine with a time constant of 625 fs, whereas deeply trapped electrons disappear slowly (526 ps) via radiative recombination. Furthermore, theoretical studies based on ab initio calculations have been carried out to complement the experimental findings.
1. Introduction
The outstanding optoelectronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) have attracted widespread attention and offer the promise of providing an excellent platform for designing new generation bioelectronics including biosensors and photovoltaic devices.1–6 QDs are tiny man-made semiconductor nanocrystals having dimensions comparable to the Bohr exciton radius.7 Three-dimensional spatial confinement of charge carriers in QDs causes the splitting of the valence and conduction bands into discrete molecule-like states,8 which reduces the rate of electron relaxation through electron–phonon interactions due to a phonon bottleneck.9 The quantum confinement in QDs leads to a new phenomenon called multiple exciton generation (MEG) by increasing the rate of the inverse Auger process and relaxing the translational momentum conservation.10–12 MEG in QDs could be exploited to enhance the efficiency of quantum dot based solar cells.5,13–15 Nonetheless, the large surface to volume ratio of QDs has initiated various energy related applications.16
Dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable interest in the last two decades because of their various advantages such as selective light absorption over a wide wavelength range, excellent photovoltaic performance, easy application in flexible modules and low production costs.17 The fundamental process in DSSCs is the electron injection from the photoexcited adsorbed dye into the conduction band of semiconductor nanoparticles.18–23 The main conditions for achieving high photon to current conversion efficiency are fast electron injection and slow back recombination. The study of the interfacial charge transfer dynamics has been proven to be an important tool for optimising the performance of DSSCs24–26 and quantum dot sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs).5,13–15
Efficient DSSCs commonly use TiO2 nanocrystallites sensitized by various metal complex dyes e.g., N719 (power conversion efficiency (PCE) 11.1%),27 black dye (PCE 10%)28 and C101 (PCE 11.4%).29 The maximum PCE achieved to date is 13% using a Zn–porphyrin sensitizer (coded SM315) and this is a new benchmark for the DSSCs.30 It has been reported that the PCE of DSSCs of up to 20.25% can be achieved by appropriately reducing the energy loss and extending the adsorption onset of the sensitizer up to 940 nm.31 In DSSCs, energy is lost due to slow electron injection, undesirable interfacial recombination, the wide band gap of the sensitizer and excess overpotential of dye regeneration.32 Organic dyes satisfy most of these conditions except energy loss due to their high band gap. These dyes harness less light due to poor matching of their absorption spectra with solar radiation. However, sometimes they form a charge transfer (CT) complex in the ground state with semiconductor nanoparticles and therefore absorb more towards red.22,33–35 Recently, Ghosh et al.22 reported the formation of a ground state CT complex having an absorption onset of ∼570 nm between CdS QDs and 4,5-dibromofluorescein (DBF) dye. Previous studies have shown that photoexcitation of these complexes leads to direct injection of electrons from the dye molecules into the conduction band of NPs/QDs on the ultrafast time scale.22,36,37 However, in most of the cases complexes were excited with a much higher energy than the band gap. The study of charge carrier dynamics using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy after categorically exciting the lowest excited CT state is still lagging.
Recently, we reported the structural, electronic and optical properties of BC5 dye, ZnO nanoclusters of varying sizes, and their complexes.38 Our ab initio calculations under vacuum suggested that BC5 can strongly be attached to ZnO nanoclusters and the complex exhibits a new band of CT character in the absorption spectra other than the dye and nanocluster bands. We predicted direct electron transfer to the conduction band of the nanoclusters following the excitation of this new band from frontier molecular orbital calculations. Herein, we have focused on the investigation of the dynamics of photogenerated charge carriers in the BC5 dye adsorbed ZnO QD system using both steady state and time-resolved spectroscopic techniques. Steady state measurements suggest that the BC5 dye forms a strong CT complex with the ZnO QD in the ground sate. The CT complex exhibits low energy absorption and emission bands. With the help of femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy, we have demonstrated the ultrafast injection (<115 fs) of electrons directly into the CB of ZnO QDs as a result of the excitation of the CT absorption band. The study of TA kinetics reveals that photogenerated charges live for hundreds of picoseconds before recombination via back electron transfer. Furthermore, theoretical calculations under density functional theory (DFT) formalism on a BC5–ZnO QD model system in the solvent predict the formation of a CT complex in the ground state with red-shifted absorption compared to the BC5 dye. Our time dependent (TD)-DFT simulations support the experimental observation of direct electron injection into the conduction band of ZnO QDs following CT excitation.
2. Experimental details
2.1. Chemicals
All chemicals were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. Zinc acetate dihydrate, (CH3COO)2Zn·2H2O (extra pure) from Merck, Germany, absolute ethanol (99.9% AR) from S D Fine-Chem Limited and 25% solution of tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH; 25 weight %) in methanol from Loba Chemie Private Limited were used for the synthesis of ZnO QDs. The dye BC5 was synthesized in the laboratory following the method described elsewhere.39 All spectroscopic measurements were carried out in acetonitrile (spectroscopic grade) as received from Sigma-Aldrich. The synthesis of ZnO QDs and their characterization are discussed below.
2.2. Synthesis of ZnO QDs
ZnO QDs were synthesized by following an already established chemical method.40 First a clear solution was obtained by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (0.955 g) in absolute ethanol (100 ml) under vigorous continuous stirring conditions. Then, 25% w/w tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide in methanol (2.8 ml) was injected with a constant injection rate for the nucleation of uniform small size particles. To avoid aggregation of the particles, the solution of synthesized ZnO QDs was kept at 4 °C in a freezer until use. The final concentration of the QD solution was estimated with the assumptions that the yield of the reaction is hundred percent and the particle size distribution is uniform.
2.3. Sample characterization
A high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM, JEOL Model 2100 X) was used to characterize and determine the size of the QDs. Steady state UV-visible absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer and a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies), respectively.
2.4. Time-resolved emission spectroscopy
Fluorescence decay kinetics were recorded on a time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) setup from ISS, USA (Chronos BH Fluorescence lifetime spectrometer). A 407 nm laser diode (pulse width <55 ps) and a 454 nm LED (pulse width <1.1 ns) from Horiba were used as excitation sources.
2.5. Femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy
A femtosecond tunable broad band TA spectrometer is based on a regeneratively amplified femtosecond Ti:Sapphire laser (wavelength ∼800 nm, pulse width <35 fs). The output light of energy 4 mJ per pulse from the regenerative amplifier (Spitfire Ace, Spectra Physics) was divided into two channels for generating pump and probe pulses. The pump pulses at wavelengths 400 nm and 500 nm were obtained from the nonlinear optical parametric amplifier (TOPAS-Prime from Light Conversion). A white light continuum (WLC) probe was generated by focusing a small fraction of 800 nm beam on either a sapphire or calcium fluoride (CaF2) crystal. In order to obtain a stable WLC probe, the intensity of 800 nm light was adjusted using an iris and a neutral density filter. The pump and probe pulses were overlapped spatially at the sample position. All the TA measurements were performed in a quartz cuvette of 2 mm path length. A typical excitation pulse energy of 300 nJ was used with a spot diameter of 497 μm at the sample position. The probe was split into sample and reference beams and detected separately to eliminate low frequency laser noises. The detection of probe pulses was performed under pump blocked and unblocked conditions using a 500 Hz mechanical chopper. TA spectra were recorded by CCD arrays after dispersion using a grating spectrograph (Acton Spectra Pro SP 2358). The group velocity dispersion (GVD) of WLC spectra was compensated using a chirp correction program (Pascher Instrument). TA kinetic traces were recorded using two well-aligned photodiodes of variable gain by controlling the relative delay between the pump and probe pulses with the help of a stepper motor driven optical delay line. The output from another TOPAS-Prime was used as a probe during TA kinetics measurements. The fitting and analysis of data were carried out using Matlab as well as using a software package provided by Pascher Instrument.
3. Computational details
All complementary theoretical calculations were carried out using density functional theory (DFT) with the help of Gaussian 09 software package.41 We modelled a ‘magic-size’ zinc oxide cluster, (ZnO)3442 of wurtzite bulk structure having a diameter of 1.3 nm. The equilibrium structures of BC5 and its cation radical (BC5˙+) were optimized using the Becke–Lee–Yang–Parr three-parameter (B3LYP) exchange–correlation functional43 with the 6-31G(d)44 basis set, while for (ZnO)34 and BC5 functionalized ZnO clusters (BC5–(ZnO)34), the LANL2DZ45 basis function was used, because of the presence of heavy metal atoms. All the computational studies were performed in acetonitrile (CH3CN) solvent similar to experimental measurements. Both the polarisable continuum model (PCM)44,46 and the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM)47 were employed for BC5 and BC5˙+, but for the BC5–(ZnO)34 complex, guided by Hedrick et al.,48 only the CPCM solvation model was applied. Vertical transition energies were calculated by using TD-DFT.49 GaussSum 2.2 software50 was exploited to simulate UV-vis absorption spectra. Frontier molecular orbitals were visualized via the Chamcraft program.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Adsorption of dye on QDs and formation of a charge transfer complex
The average diameter of synthesized ZnO QDs was found to be 3.5 nm (see ESI,† Fig. S1). These QDs possess an excitonic absorption band at 314 nm and defect emission at 505 nm as reported in our earlier studies.40,51Fig. 1 depicts the optical absorption spectra of the isolated dye and dye with increasing concentration (from 5.81 nM to 58.10 nM) of ZnO QDs in acetonitrile. The isolated dye exhibits a broad absorption band of around 395 nm. Upon the addition of QDs, a new strong absorption band appears in the visible region with maximum at ∼525 nm. The different absorption behaviour was also reflected from the colour change (light green to red) of the dye solution in the presence of ZnO QDs (Fig. S2, ESI†). With the increase in the concentration of the ZnO QDs, the dye absorption band decreases, while the intensity of the new band increases concomitantly. This new band could be attributed to the ground state CT complex, which is formed due to the strong electronic coupling between the dye and QDs. The formation of a CT complex in the ground state between organic dyes and ZnS, TiO2, and ZrO2 semiconductor nanoparticles has previously been reported by other groups.52–57 Furthermore, the existence of an isosbestic point (∼430 nm) rules out the possibility of dye aggregation and supports the formation of a new species at the expense of the dye molecule. The origin of the complex formation can be expressed as ZnO + Dye → [ZnO−δ⋯Dye+δ]comlex(1)And a modified Benesi–Hildebrand equation58 has been proposed for the determination of the equilibrium constant (Keq) of the CT complex of 1:1 stoichiometry, (2)where [Dye] is the concentration of free dye, [ZnO] is the concentration of ZnO QDs and [ZnO–Dye] is the concentration of the complex. The Benesi–Hildebrand plot (inset of Fig. 1) that was obtained from UV-vis absorption data at 525 nm (Fig. 1) came out to be a straight line suggesting 1:1 stoichiometry of the dye–ZnO complex. The values of the equilibrium constant (Keq ∼ 3.87 × 107 M−1) and molar extinction coefficient (ε ∼ 41667 cm−1 M−1) are estimated from the plot. The large value of Keq indicates a strong coupling between the dye and ZnO QDs in the ground state.

Fig. 2a displays the emission spectra of BC5 and BC5–ZnO QD mixtures following 395 nm excitation. The isolated dye shows an intense emission band with a maximum around 480 nm. In the presence of ZnO QDs, the emission intensity of the dye decreases, but at the same time, a new emission band arises at 650 nm (inset of Fig. 2a). The quenching of dye emission with the addition of QDs is not due to the inner filter effect as QDs have negligible absorption at the excitation wavelength. Dye emission is quenched may be because of both the reduction of free dye concentration due to complex formation with ZnO QDs (as apparent from absorption studies) and the electron transfer from dye to QDs. The weak emission band around 650 nm could originate from the BC5–ZnO QD complex. In order to verify this, we excited specifically the CT absorption band (∼525 nm) and observed a nice structured emission band having maximum at 625 nm (Fig. 2b). The intensity of this band was found to increase regularly with the increase of QD concentration because of the formation of more and more complexes. Ghosh and co-workers34,55–57,59 have reported similar CT emission from dye-semiconductor nanoparticle complexes. Furthermore, Walters et al.60 observed CT emission from the coumarin 343–TiO2 complex with the help of Stark spectroscopy. The origin of CT emission is the radiative recombination of electrons that were injected into the ZnO QD from the dye via excitation of the CT complex. It is also apparent from Fig. 2 that the emission yield of the CT complex is relatively low compared to the dye. This is because, during back electron transfer to the dye, a nonradiative decay channel plays a predominant role resulting in low emission yield.61

4.2. Time-resolved emission studies
In order to acquire more insights about the photoinduced interaction between BC5 and ZnO QDs, time-resolved fluorescence measurements were carried out. The fluorescence decay of BC5 dye was measured upon excitation at 407 nm (monitored at 480 nm), whereas for the BC5–QD complex both 407 nm and 454 nm excitations (monitored at 625 nm) were used (Fig. 3). The decay kinetics of BC5 was fitted well by a single exponential function with a time constant of 3.19 ns (100%). In contrast, fluorescence decays of the complex are bi-exponential having a shorter (τ1 ∼ 650 ps) and a longer (τ2 ∼ 3 ns) lifetime components. It is quite clear from the close inspection of the fitting results (Table 1) that the contribution of τ1 is increased (and τ2 is decreased) when we specifically excited the CT complex (at 454 nm). These observations suggest that in the mixture, longer lifetime could be attributed to BC5 and the shorter one to the lifetime of the CT emission. As the CT emission arises due to recombination of electrons and dye radical cations, the lifetime of the CT emission is equal to the back electron transfer time.34,55,57,59,61

4.3. Femtosecond transient absorption studies
The results of steady state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements have indirectly established the injection of electrons from the dye to the ZnO QD following CT excitation. In order to confirm charge generation, femtosecond TA measurements were carried out in the ultraviolet (UV), visible (vis) and near IR (NIR) regions. We have measured the TA spectra of the BC5–ZnO QD complex in the UV-vis (350–700 nm) range, upon excitation at 500 nm (direct excitation of CT band) using the WLC probe (Fig. 4a). On the other hand, TA spectra in the NIR (950–1150 nm) region were constructed from single wavelength kinetics data measured at a gap of 10 nm (Fig. 4b). It should be noted that the interference of the free dye molecules with the TA signals of BC5–ZnO QD complexes is very low because BC5 has a negligible absorption at 500 nm.
 Fig. 4  TA spectra of the BC5–ZnO QD complex in acetonitrile at various pump–probe delays in the (a) UV-visible, and (b) NIR regions (excitation wavelength ∼500 nm). 

Fig. 4a shows positive absorption in the 350–420 nm wavelength range having band maxima at 390 nm and a negative band in the 425–700 nm region with a peak at 625 nm. In order to verify whether these bands originate from the dye, we measured the TA spectra of BC5 (Fig. S3, ESI†). Although BC5 shows a small positive absorption band at 370 nm, kinetics in this wavelength region is completely different from the dye–QD system (Fig. S4, ESI†). Both 370 nm and 440 nm bands for BC5 could be attributed to the excited state absorption. In fact, these bands could be the result of superposition of a broad positive signal due to excited state absorption and a negative signal due to ground sate bleaching (GSB) of BC5. On the other hand, negative absorption bands around 410 nm and 500 nm (Fig. S3, ESI†) of the dye are associated with ground state bleach and stimulated emission, respectively. Our simulated absorption spectra of the BC5 cation radical (Dye˙+) using TD-DFT calculations (vide infra) show a band between 344 and 434 nm. Based on the previous literature28 and our theoretical calculations, the 390 nm band of the BC5–QD CT complex is assigned to the absorption of the dye cation radical. The negative absorption band in the 425–700 nm region of the TA spectra arises due to both the ground state bleaching and stimulated emission of the BC5–ZnO CT complex. The band maximum appears at 620 nm and shifts further (from 620 nm to 650 nm) at a longer time of 500 ps (Fig. S5, ESI†). In addition, we have compared TA kinetics measured at some particular wavelengths of the negative band, e.g., 580, 600, 630, and 680 nm (Fig. S6, ESI†). Interestingly, the decay becomes slower and slower as we move from 580 nm to 680 nm suggesting the contributions of some other signals by GSB. It should be noted that the BC5–ZnO QD complex exhibits emission in the 550–775 nm range with a peak at 600 nm. This means that the stimulated emission (SE) signal contributes to the TA signal in the 550–700 nm region. As the strength of the GSB signal decreases and the SE signal increases in the red part of the spectra, the SE is expected to be dominated above 600 nm. A transient red-shift in the SE spectra may appear due to the solvation dynamics.62 Therefore, solvation dynamics could be another reason for the observed red-shift of the 620 nm band.
In addition, a broad positive absorption band is apparent in the 950–1150 nm region with a peak at 1000 nm (Fig. 4b). This broad positive absorption band is attributed to the injected electrons in the CB (ECB) of ZnO QDs (negatively charged QD). The assignment is made based on previous reports,63–66 which suggested that electrons in the conduction band of QDs absorb either in the visible or near IR region. It should be noted that Bauer et al.67 established through a spectroelectrochemical experiment that electrons in nanostructured ZnO films absorb in the visible to near IR region (650–1000 nm).
While TA spectral measurements provided direct evidence for the formation of charges in the BC5–QD complex following CT excitation, the complete life cycle of photogenerated charges can be observed by monitoring the kinetics of the dye cation radical and the electron in the conduction band. Therefore, TA kinetics at 390 nm and 1000 nm were recorded for 500 nm excitation (Fig. 5a). The kinetics at 390 nm can be fitted with a rise of time constant <115 fs and multiexponential decay having time constants τ3 ∼ 625 fs (15%) and τ4 ∼ 526 ps (85%) as shown in Table 2. Multiexponential fitting of the kinetics at 1000 nm yielded a growth time of <115 fs and decay time constants of τ3 ∼ 402 fs (30%), τ4 ∼ 1.9 ps (40%) and τ5 ∼ 435 ps (30%) (Table 2). Signals at both 390 nm and 1000 nm grow sharply, indicating ultrafast injection of the electron in the BC5–QD complex. We must mention that Lian and co-workers36,68 observed similar pulse-width limited electron injection in CT complexes of TiO2 nanoparticles, which they attributed to the direct injection of electrons from the donor orbitals to the acceptor orbitals. Duncan et al.69 have shown, based on time-domain ab initio calculations, the direct injection of electrons from the dye ground state into a semiconductor state near the CB edge because of strong chromophore-semiconductor coupling. Later Ghosh and co-workers22,33,70 also assigned the instrument response limited (<120 fs) electron transfer in dye-nanoparticles as well as in dye–QD complexes to the direct electron injection from the ground state of the dye. Herein, our theoretical calculations (see Section 4.4) demonstrate that electron density shifts towards the QD when the BC5–ZnO QD CT complex is promoted from the HOMO to the LUMO (vide infra). Therefore, it is clear from these discussions that the excitation of the dye–QD CT state leads to the formation of the excited CT state where electrons are localized on the QD. The excited CT state is formed due to the injection (within 115 fs) of the electron directly from the HOMO (not via LUMO) of BC5 to the CB of the QD (Scheme 1).

 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram of the photoinduced processes, i.e. direct electron injection, recombination, electron trapping and CT emission occurring in the BC5–ZnO complex. k and τ represent rate and lifetime, respectively of various processes. 
The fitting results (Table 2) of the kinetics at 390 nm show that Dye˙+ recombines with fast (625 fs) and slow time components (526 ps). It is interesting to see that the signal at 1000 nm for the electrons in the conduction band shows similar fast and slow decay components (Table 2). The fast decay component, τ3 ∼ 625 fs may be assigned to the direct recombination of CB band edge electrons (free or in shallow trap) with the parent dye cations (Scheme 1). The slow decay component, τ4 ∼ 526 ps, is associated with the recombination of the electrons, which pass through a trapping process in the surface states of the ZnO QD (Scheme 1). Moreover, the slow decay component (τ4 ∼ 526 ps) is closer to the lifetime (τCT) of the CT emission. This observation indicates that the origin of the CT emission is the recombination of trapped, but not the band edge electrons with dye cations. In addition to a fast and a slow decay component, the kinetics at 1000 nm possesses another time constant of 1.9 ps. The additional lifetime component could be attributed to the trapping dynamics of the electron in the surface trap states of the ZnO QD (Scheme 1).
We have also monitored the bleach recovery kinetics at 525 nm, which can be fitted with a biexponential function with decay times τ3 ∼ 625 fs (33%) and τ4 ∼ 526 ps (66%), respectively. Interestingly, both the time constants of 525 nm kinetics perfectly match with the decay at 390 nm suggesting that the decay of the Dye˙+ and recovery of the ground state bleach take place following the same route. Furthermore, there is an isosbestic point in the TA spectra of the complex around 427 nm (Fig. 4a). This observation indicates that recombination of the dye radical cation leads to the recovery of the ground state complex.
In order to learn more about the complex nature of the TA signal around 600 nm, we have recorded TA kinetics at 640 nm (Fig. S7, ESI†). The kinetics shows exponential growth in 210 fs and biexponential decay with time constants τ3 ∼ 35 ps and τ4 ∼ 526 ps, respectively (Table 2). The rise time of the signal at 640 nm is longer than that of 390 nm because of the presence of a stimulated emission signal in this spectral region. As the origin of the CT emission is the recombination of trapped electrons, the emission gets delayed making the rise of the stimulated emission signal slower than GSB. Different decay characteristics of the 640 nm signal than 525 nm further support our conclusion that the TA signal in the higher wavelength region of the visible spectra is dominated by stimulated emission. Time constant τ4 (526 ps) is equal to the slowest recombination time of the Dye˙+ as well as the trapped electrons and therefore represents the lifetime of CT emission. The faster decay time τ3 (35 ps) is associated with the transient red-shift of the 600 nm band and can be attributed to vibrational cooling and perhaps solvation and structural relaxation of the complex.
4.4. Computational studies

Ab initio theoretical calculations were performed to enrich our understanding of the interaction between the BC5 dye and the ZnO QD in the ground state as well as in the excited state in acetonitrile. We simulated UV-vis absorption spectra of the BC5 dye with the help of TD-DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d) in acetonitrile using both the polarizable continuum model (PCM) with integral equation formalism (IEF) and the conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM). Both the models predicted identical spectra suggesting that the absorption spectra of BC5 are independent of the solvation model (Fig. S8a, ESI†). Moreover, the simulated spectra of BC5 are in close agreement with the experimental one (Fig. S8b, ESI†). The pictures of frontier molecular orbitals clearly infer that the HOMO and the LUMO possess π and π* character, respectively (Fig. S9, ESI†). Therefore, the low energy absorption band of BC5 could be attributed to the π → π* (HOMO → LUMO) transition.
We have calculated vertical transitions for the BC5 cation radical in acetonitrile with the help of TD-DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory and IEFPCM and CPCM solvation models. Both the models calculated vertical transitions with significant oscillator strength at 434, 403, 381, 374, and 344 nm (ESI,†Tables 1 and 2) predicting a broad absorption of BC5˙+ in the 344–434 nm region (Fig. S10, ESI†). This result is used in the previous section for assigning the positive TA band at 390 nm (Fig. 4a) to the BC5 cation radical.
Recently,38 we have shown that BC5 is strongly adsorbed to the ZnO nanocluster surface via the cyano group. Therefore, in order to simulate the interaction in the BC5–(ZnO)34 complex in acetonitrile, the geometry of the cyano anchored complex was optimized (Fig. S11, ESI†). The absorption spectrum of the complex in acetonitrile was simulated by calculating vertical transitions with the help of TD-DFT/B3LYP/ LanL2DZ using the CPCM solvation model.
Major electronic transitions are presented in Table S3 (ESI†). Simulated absorption spectra having two main absorption bands at 1 and 2.5 eV are presented in Fig. 6. It shows a low energy band like the experimental absorption spectra of the complex. In order to confirm that this longer wavelength band is not due to the aggregation of dye molecules, we calculated the absorption spectra of two dye molecules attached in parallel and perpendicular orientations (Fig. S12, ESI†). A very small red-shift of the dimer absorption compared to the monomer suggests that the longer wavelength absorption band of the complex cannot be formed due to dye aggregation on the QD surface. The band around 1 eV arises from two major electronic transitions (HOMO → LUMO (99%), HOMO → LUMO+1 (43%) and HOMO → LUMO+2 (48%)), while the 2.5 eV band becomes visible due to mainly three major transitions (HOMO−2 → LUMO (78%), HOMO−2 → LUMO+1 (78%) and HOMO → LUMO+14 (33%)). Frontier molecular orbitals of the complex were calculated and the isodensity surface of relevant orbitals is presented in Fig. 6. Nonetheless, the electron density distribution on the dye and the ZnO QD corresponding to various orbitals were estimated (Fig. 6). Partial distribution of electron density over both dye and ZnO in the HOMO reveals that the complex is formed in the ground state due to sharing of charges and thereby CT character. Fig. 6 shows that the HOMO is mainly localized onto the dye (95%), whereas the LUMO is fully restricted on the ZnO surface (99%). The electron distribution in the LUMO is mostly shifted to the ZnO cluster from BC5 suggesting the possibility of electron transfer from BC5 following the excitation of the low energy (CT) absorption band. It is also apparent from the table in Fig. 6 that electron distribution is increased in ZnO for HOMO−2 → LUMO, HOMO−2 → LUMO+1, and HOMO → LUMO+14 transitions. These observations suggest that there is a possibility of electron transfer from dye to ZnO for higher energy excitations too.

The relevant molecular orbitals were calculated for contribution of electron density distribution on the dye and the ZnO cluster. 
5. Conclusion
In conclusion, the new coumarin dye (BC5) and the ZnO QD form a strong ground state CT complex, which facilitates direct electron injection into the CB of the QD on the ultrafast time scale. The red-shifted absorption spectra of the BC5–ZnO QD complex can match well with the solar spectrum as compared to the isolated dye and the QD. Dye–QD complexes are emissive in nature and possess a fluorescence lifetime of about 650 ps. Excitation of the CT absorption band results in the formation of charges via electron transfer from the dye to the QD. This is clearly evident from the signature absorption in the femtosecond TA spectra of dye radical cations and electrons in the CB of QDs in UV-vis (350–420 nm) and NIR (950–1150 nm) regimes, respectively. The analysis of TA kinetics reveals that injected electrons survive for a few hundred picoseconds before recombination with dye cations via at least two different paths. Electrons near the CB edge recombine rapidly through a nonradiative channel, while trapped electrons are slowly captured by dye cations radiatively, releasing CT emission. Additionally, DFT based quantum chemical calculations show that in the ground state, the BC5–ZnO complex has CT character. Frontier molecular orbital pictures of the BC5–ZnO nanocluster system are in good agreement with the experimental finding of direct electron injection from the HOMO of the dye to the CB of the ZnO QD following CT excitation. We believe that the fast direct electron injection and slow electron recombination along with enhanced absorption of solar radiation would make the BC5–ZnO QD system suitable for efficient DSSCs.
