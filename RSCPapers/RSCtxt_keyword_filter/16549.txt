    , Accepted 22nd September 2017First published on 22nd September 2017AbstractThe molecular geometry and spatial state determine the photoelectric properties, which are the main factors affecting the performance of devices in organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Designing and comparing the effects of molecular conformations, steric configurations, and repeating unit numbers on photovoltaic properties for a unitary unit at the molecular level is systematic and meaningful research. The density functional theory (DFT) and time dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) methods are used to calculate the electronic structure, the open circuit voltage (VOC) and key parameters closely relevant to the short-circuit current density (JSC), including the absorption spectrum, electron–hole correlation, driving force and interface charge separation (kinter-CS) and recombination rate (kinter-CR), as well as the LUMO orbital compositions of each fragment to explain the geometric-nature relationship and characterize the molecular photovoltaic performance. The results showed that the p conformational linear structure of the 4-unit molecule shows large VOC, easy exciton dissociation, matching energy levels and absorption spectra with the donor, and large kinter-CS and small kinter-CR at the donor/acceptor interface. Our conclusions indicate that systematic screening of molecular geometry and spatial state is an effective strategy for designing high-performance non-fullerene small molecule acceptors. Finally, we hope that our investigations in this study could provide theoretical assistance for further optimization of the acceptor materials for OPVs.
Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaic (OPV) solar cells,1,2 emerging as an environmentally benign technology with the function of converting solar energy into electricity, have shown attractive prospects owing to their low-cost, low weight, easy handling and manufacture and flexible fabrication.3–5 Normally, a typical BHJ device is composed of electron donor and acceptor materials, which cooperate in the conversion of light to electricity at the heterojunction interface.5–7 Among them, the most widely used acceptor materials are fullerenes and their derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71/C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM or PC61BM).8–10 At present, fullerene-based OPVs have exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 12%.11,12 Compared to fullerene derivatives, a number of research studies have been devoted to promising non-fullerene small molecule (SM) acceptor materials owing to their advantages of simple synthesis and purification, less batch-to-batch variation, and easily modulated spectra and energy levels.13–17 Currently, a number of non-fullerene SM acceptors have been applied in OPVs with the highest PCEs surpassing 11%.18–20 Despite these superiorities, there are more potential candidates for non-fullerene SM acceptors in commercial applications, particularly, 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (99′BF).
Due to the repulsive steric interactions between the H1–H1′ and H8–H8′ protons, 99′BF could be twisted by typically 32°–39° from planarity around the C9C9′ double bond in the ground state, i.e., crosses (c).21 Furthermore, 99′BF easily accepts one electron from a donor polymer to satisfy the 14-π-electron aromaticity and the Hückel's requirements. As a result, 99′BF and its derivatives have attracted a lot of scientific attention22 since Wudl et al. reported 99′BF as an electron acceptor.21 Do-Hoon et al. reported that 99′BF was used as an electron acceptor and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as an electron donor in OPVs, and proved that the aromatic acceptor material can significantly improve the performance of the device.23 Marder et al. made 99′BF as an intermediate bridge connected to the PDI units to construct a facile electron hopping channel and 3D structure, and the PCE can reached 3.64%.24 However, currently, on account of the low PCE of the 99′BF derivatives as an acceptor material, optimized molecular engineering is extremely urgent for building high-performance OPV acceptors. Therefore, for this reason, we systematically explored the various factors (conformations, steric configurations and repeating unit numbers) of the 99′BF derivative molecular geometry, and characterized its photovoltaic performance at the molecular scale.
To realize higher PCE in BHJ OPVs, the photovoltaic properties of the donor/acceptor in the active layer is one of the key parameters.25,26 It is well known that molecular geometries determine performance.2 Hence the molecular conformation,27 steric configuration28–30 and repeating unit number (conjugate length)31–33 are three important considerations in the design of high-performance photovoltaic materials. Among them, the effect of conformation on molecular properties is mainly through the control of the molecular three-dimensional state to change the molecular properties, and the research on this has been scant in the OPV field.34 There are many studies on the steric configuration, such as star type,24 linear type29 and so on,35,36 which mainly use a different steric configuration to change the interaction between the internal units to affect the performance. And repeating unit number mainly affects the conjugation by changing the length of the molecule chains. Many studies have shown that the repeating unit number does have an effect on the performance of the molecule but always reaches a steady value. For example, two repeating units are usually selected to represent the properties of the entire polymer molecule in OPV.32 Therefore, we study the conformation, steric configuration and repeating unit number at the molecular level for the unified unit in the SM acceptor to make a systematic comparison, which helps us to understand their effect on molecular properties and provide theoretical guidance for the design of new non-fullerene acceptors.
Since it is time-consuming, effort-consuming and challenging to probe experimentally at the molecular scale the effect of different conformations, steric configurations and repeating unit numbers on the OPV device properties, the insight brought by computational studies is extremely useful in this context. Hence, based on the reported experimental conformation c, another conformation is found by theoretical calculations, i.e., parallel (p) for 99′BF. Taking 99′BF as the research object, based on the two conformations (c and p), the two steric configurations (star and linear) and different repeating units (2–5) a series of 99′BF-based acceptor SMs were designed (see Fig. 1). The density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) methods were used to investigate the relative performance parameters of the acceptor molecules in the order of conformation → steric configuration → repeating unit number. The donor/acceptor interface model was used to characterize the device performance by a Marcus semi-classical model. Finally, based on the results of the calculations, the geometric-nature relationship is explained and used to devise an effective strategy for designing excellent acceptor SMs.

Computational methods
Quantum chemical calculations
The DFT calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level to understand the geometry and electronic structure of the c and p conformations and their derivatives. B3LYP has been proven to be feasible for predicting the geometries and the electronic structures of 99′BF derivatives.23,24 Our comparison of the optimized geometry with the experimental one for 99′BF (c conformation) is collected in Table S1 (ESI†), confirming that it is good agreement with the experimental structure.21,37 The absorption spectra and excited-state energies were calculated using TD-DFT based on the optimized ground-state geometries under vacuum. B3LYP with the 6-31G(d) basis set was used to simulate the absorption spectra of the 99′BF derivatives.38 The results showed that the maximum absorption wavelength of B3LYP was 471 nm, which could provide similar estimates of the transition wavelength and excitation energy to the experimental one (the difference is 0.08 eV).21 Therefore, the ground state and anion state energies of all molecules were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level for retaining consistency. The electron–hole correlation of charge transfer is studied by using the transition density matrix (TDM) that is depicted in Multiwfn 3.3.2.39
For the donor/acceptor interface model, we studied electronic structures and related parameters using a Marcus semi-classical model.40,41 The distance of donor/acceptor is set as 3.5 Å, which is also widely used in interface model studies.16,42,43 Meanwhile the parallel conformation has been proved to be a preferred donor/acceptor arrangement.44 The P3HT (n = 6) derivatives were selected as the donor materials, and the correlation calculation data are shown in Table S2 (ESI†). Comparing the energy level data in Table S2 (ESI†), the suitable P3HT (–OCH3) molecule was chosen as a donor (D) in this study. The D/acceptor interface model was optimized using the CAM-B3LYP-D3/6-31G(d) method for the ground-state geometries and evaluated using the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method for the excited-state energies. The long-range-corrected CAM-B3LYP can correctly describe the intermolecular charge transfer (inter-CT) excitations between D and the acceptor.45,46 The absorption spectra, TDM and the charge density difference (CDD) maps of the research system were simulated by Multiwfn 3.3.2. All the above-mentioned model calculations were performed in the Gaussian 09 software package.47
Marcus rate expression
The rate of intermolecular charge separation (kinter-CS) and charge recombination (kinter-CR) at the interface constructed by the D/acceptor dimer system can be expressed by the Marcus semi-classical model.48 The formalism is used to calculate non-adiabatic electron transfer in OPVs, which could be written as follows:49 (1)where VDA represents the electronic coupling between D and the acceptor, λ represents the reorganization energy, ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change in the reaction, kB is the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constant, and T is the temperature (300 K). The corresponding calculation details of λ, VDA and ΔG for Marcus semi-classical formalism are given in the ESI.†
Results and discussion
Theoretical studies on the isomerization mechanism of crossed and parallel
First, we used the same method to optimize another conformation p that was found in theoretical calculations of 99′BF, and the optimized geometry information is shown in Table S3 (ESI†). To verify whether the p conformation is stable, we searched the transition state (ts) between the two conformations and depicted the potential energy diagram (see Fig. 2). The ts was correct by validation of the IRC. As shown in Fig. 2, we can see that the reaction barrier height of reaction c → ts → p is 43.49 kJ mol−1, indicating that the reaction can be carried out at room temperature and the c conformation is stable in nature. While the energy barrier of the reverse reaction p → ts → c is small, only 4.60 kJ mol−1, so the reaction occurs easily and the p configuration is unstable in the natural environment, which may be the reason why the p conformation was not found in the experiment. However, some literature shows that there are methods to upshift or downshift the energy barrier of the configuration, and even lead to reversal of the main configuration.50,51 Therefore, theoretical research of possible conformations in the molecule provides more possibilities for designing 99′BF derivatives with superior performance.

In order to investigate the effect of molecular conformation on the photovoltaic properties, we used the same method to characterize the c and p conformations. The frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) (Fig. 3(a)) of the two conformations spread over the whole core, which exhibit from π to π* orbital features. Compared to c, p possesses a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and larger energy gap. As seen from Fig. 3(b) and Table 1, there are distinct differences in the absorption characteristics of the two conformations. The absorption peak of p at 392 nm arose from S0 → S3 transition corresponding to the transition from HOMO → LUMO. For c, the absorption peak at 471 nm is traced to the transition of S0 → S3, majorly attributed to HOMO → LUMO transition. This provides more possibilities for matching with the D spectrum. Notably, the oscillator strength of the S1 states is 0 for two conformations, showing forbidden transition and increasing the molecular excitation resistance. In summary, before molecular performance studies, it is necessary to carefully understand the nature of the molecule itself, such as the possible conformations, which are needed for purposefully synthesizing the dominant conformation in experiments and more in-depth and detailed follow-up theoretical research. The following steric configuration and repeating unit number studies are based on the above-mentioned two conformations. Due to heavy research work, the future studies will use the c conformation as the main research object and the p conformation as parallel calculations to verify the conclusions. Finally, the photovoltaic properties of the two conformational derivatives are summarized, and the dominant conformation is obtained.

The comparative study on star and linear steric configuration of crossed and parallel

Frontier molecular orbital and open circuit voltage. 
The FMO energy level can influence a number of factors such as absorption, charge separation ability and VOC.52,53 Therefore, we first analyze the distribution of the FMO and the energy level to preliminarily predict the molecular properties. Through the above discussion we know that the optimized geometry at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level is consistent with the experimental data,21 and so are the FMO levels for all the compounds. The electron clouds of the HOMO and LUMO for all molecules are depicted in Fig. 4. In general, the more delocalized LUMO can be used to determine the functional position of the electronic excitation and electron transport by hopping.54,55 The FMOs of c2 and p2 are delocalized on the whole molecules. For c3–c55 (n ≥ 3), the FMOs of the linear structures are mainly localized on the three core 99′BF units, and partially on the two 99′BF units at the end, while the FMOs of the star molecules are mainly localized on the core 99′BF unit, and partially on the peripheral 99′BF units. In addition, the C–C single bond on the connected 99′BF unit has an electronic cloud distribution for the linear molecules. Therefore, the linear molecules show better delocalization, which is conducive to the realization of intramolecular charge transfer. From these points of view, the linear molecules are dominant.

All the FMO energy levels of the investigated SMs are displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and Table 2. It is seen from Table 2 that different steric configurations can change the energy level and energy gap of the molecule, thus affecting the molecular properties. So, choosing the dominant steric configuration is conducive to constructing a high-performance device. Whereas the energy levels of different steric configurations with the same repeating units are tiny differences. Therefore, we need to deeply analyze other parameters related to OPV performance, such as VOC.

As a key parameter determining PCE, VOC has been studied extensively.56 It is influenced by the nature of the material as well as the environmental parameters such as semiconductor energy levels, light-source temperature, charge-carrier recombination, and the morphology of the active layer.57 Several theoretical and experimental studies58,59 have supported that VOC is contributed by the differences of LUMO (acceptor) and HOMO (D). Consequently, the VOC can be estimated by using the following equation:60 VOC = 1/e(|EH(D) − EL(A)|) − Eb(2)where EH(D) and EL(A) are HOMO of the D and LUMO of the acceptor, respectively, and e is the elementary charge. Eb is the exciton binding energy, which is generally estimated in the range of 0.1 to 1 eV; here, we assumed a median value of 0.5 V for non-fullerene SMs.16,60 We estimated the values of VOC listed in Table 2. The order of VOC values is c3 > c33, c4 < c44, c5 < c55, p3 = p33, p4 < p44 and p5 < p55. Only when the number of units is 3, the VOC of the linear molecules is slightly smaller than or equal to that of the star molecules. While for 3 < n ≤ 5, the linear molecule is more likely to obtain a high VOC value with the same repeating unit number. Therefore, the linear molecules may be more reasonable steric configurations than the star molecules for 99′BF derivatives.


Absorption spectra. 
The absorption spectra of the acceptor should match the absorption spectra of D to increase the JSC.61,62 Generally, the D absorbs photons to produce excitons, with subsequent electron transfer from the D to acceptor. However, many recent studies have shown that the stronger absorbing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) open up options for additional photocurrent generation through acceptor excitation followed by hole transfer from the NFA to the D.63 The above two mechanisms occur simultaneously and match not only the LUMO energy levels for efficient electron transfer but also the HOMO energy levels for hole transfer. The photoexcitation properties of the investigated molecules were evaluated using the TD-B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. The simulated absorption spectra are plotted in Fig. 5 and Fig. S2 (ESI†). And the strongest absorption peaks, the corresponding oscillator strengths and the major configurations are listed in Table 3 and Table S4 (ESI†). The absorption of the c derivatives is between 300 and 800 nm. The maximum absorption spectra are in the order of c3 < c33, c4 < c44 and c5 < c55, and the linear molecules exhibit obvious red shifts compared to the star molecules. As seen from Fig. 5 and Table 3, the linear molecules have two distinct absorption peaks; the maximum absorption of D (570 nm) can make up for the weak absorption of the acceptor. This may simultaneously result in D excitation and acceptor excitation, which is helpful for increasing the photocurrent of the device. Therefore, linear molecules could have a higher JSC.

Intramolecular charge transfer. 
Intramolecular charge transfer is the ability to characterize exciton dissociation into free charge.53 A number of studies have suggested that TDM can investigate the electron–hole coherence of the charge transfer in the excited states, which can effectively characterize the ability of the exciton to escape the coulomb attraction into free charge.43,64 Therefore, we calculated the electron–hole coherence of the lowest excited states (S1) for all the study systems, and drew the relevant TDM plots shown in Fig. 6 and Fig. S3 (ESI†). As can be seen from Fig. 6, the electron–hole coherence of c2 is concentrated on the whole molecule, indicating the delocalized electron transfer. The electron–hole correlation is mainly concentrated in the central unit for star molecules; and linear molecules mainly concentrated on the diagonal (An–An, n = 1–5), which indicates the charge transfer characteristics in the molecular skeleton. For the correlation coefficient, with the increase in the number of units, that of the star molecules can reach a stable value (about 0.0080) and that of the linear molecules gradually reduced (min = 0.0039). Consequently, compared with the star molecules, linear molecules show a smaller correlation coefficient and better charge transfer characteristics. This indicates that the excitons in the linear molecules can more easily escape the coulomb attraction and the excitons can be better transferred in the molecule, thereby improving the JSC due to the increase in photogenerated charge carriers.

Energetic driving force. 
The charge separation at the interface is significant for the charge collected by the electrodes. Whereas overcoming the binding energy of electron/hole and driving electron transfer requires energy loss.65 In principle, the driving force ΔEL–L is estimated between the LUMOs of D and the acceptor, and the driving force ΔEH–H is estimated between the HOMOs of D and the acceptor. Many researchers support that a driving force ΔE > Eb is necessary to ensure effective charge separation at the D/acceptor interface.66Eb is the binding energy and is estimated at 0.5 eV in non-fullerene SMs, which arises from experimental evidence.43,60 According to the ΔE values listed in Table 2, we knew that the ΔEL–L ranges of c derivatives and p derivatives are 0.91–1.09 eV and 0.92–1.06 eV, respectively, which are all larger than 0.5 eV, demonstrating effective electron transfer energy from D to the acceptor material. At the same time, the ΔEH–H ranges of the c derivatives and p derivatives are 0.59–0.79 eV and 1.18–1.29 eV, respectively. All ΔEH–H values are greater than 0.5 eV, so there is enough energy to transfer holes from the acceptor to the D.


Intermolecular charge transfer and recombination. 
For photocurrent generation in OPVs, the excitons at the interface are separated into electrons and holes, and then electrons are transferred to the acceptors to be collected by the cathode. But this is also accompanied by a loss mechanism: the separated electrons and holes recombine and then die.67,68 The recombination and separation of electrons/holes are competitive relationships. Therefore, a large separation process (kCS) and a small recombination process (kCR) are favourable for obtaining high PCE devices. Before performing calculations, we must first determine the CT excited state by CDD mapping. CT excited state features were identified in two cases. One is the charge transfer state from D to acceptor, corresponding to holes localized on the D, and electrons and holes localized on the acceptor.43,64 The other is the pure CT state (the fully charged separation state): the electron localized on the acceptor, and the hole localized on the D.16 Here, the dynamic process of the excited state from one type to another is not considered. We have calculated 20 excited states for each interface model and plotted the CDD plot of the CT excited state in Fig. 7 and Fig. S4 (ESI†).
 Fig. 7  Charge density difference maps of inter-CT excited states for D/c2–c55 heterojunctions at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level, where the violet and turquoise colors stand for an increase and decrease in electron density, respectively. 
Based on the optimized D/acceptor model and the identified CT state, we used the semi-classical Marcus theory to calculate the kCS and kCR values. In order to obtain the k values, we calculated the electronic couplings (VDA), Gibbs free energies (ΔG) and reorganization energies listed in Table 4 and Table S4 (ESI†). The total reorganization energy (λ) can be divided into internal reorganization energy (λint) and external reorganization energy (λext). λint is mainly affected by the geometrical changes in the D and acceptor, and λext is mainly affected by the electron and nuclear polarization of the surrounding medium when the charge is transferred. Computed λ, ΔG, VDA and k of D/acceptors are listed in Table S5 (ESI†) and Table 4. From Table 4, the order of kCS/kCR values is c3 ≈ c33, c4 < c44, c5 < c55, p3 < p33, p4 < p44 and p5 < p55. The linear molecules, which were the dominant structures, showed larger kCS/kCR and were expected to have higher JSC. In addition, by comparing the kCS/kCR values of the c and p derivatives, the values for the p derivatives are 10 orders of magnitude greater than those for the c derivatives. Without considering the stability of the molecule, the p conformation is a dominant conformation. Therefore, the ideal situation is that the p conformation and linear molecules are the effective design strategy for obtaining high-performance 99′BF derivatives as acceptor SMs.

The comparative study on repeating unit numbers
Based on the study of the molecular structure in Section 3.2, then, we analyzed the effect of the number of repeating units on the acceptor properties and select the optimal number of units for 99′BF derivatives. In the FMO diagram and analysis of Section 3.2.2, as the number of units grows (2–5), the distribution of star molecules is always concentrated on the central unit, with part of the distribution on the external units; the FMOs of linear molecules are delocalized on several central units near the center. An increase in repeating unit number may have little effect on the properties of the whole molecule for star molecules. To further clearly explore the effect of the unit number on the acceptor performance for 99′BF derivative SM acceptors, we used the Hirshfeld method to calculate the contribution of each unit of c derivatives to the LUMO orbitals (%) as shown in Fig. 8. The Hirshfeld method is considered to be the most robust and convenient way to analyze the molecular orbital composition.69 It can be seen from Fig. 8 that the contribution of the two units in the c2 to the LUMO energy level is average, indicating that the two units have the same effect on performance. The contribution of the central unit of the star molecule is larger and the peripheral unit is similar and smaller. However, when the unit number increases, the contribution value of the central unit is not changed, and the contribution value of the peripheral units decreases and averages. This suggests that increasing the peripheral unit has little effect on the main performance of the star molecule, but only distracts the contribution of the molecular peripheral unit. Meanwhile, increased unit numbers will increase the difficulty of experimental molecule synthesis and result in unnecessary performance loss. For the linear molecules, the contribution of the unit is gradually reduced from the center to the end. Although the main contribution value of the LUMO is always the central unit, the contribution of the central unit decreases and is dispersed to the end units when the unit number increases. This indicates that increasing the unit number in the linear molecules can have utility and affect the main performance of the molecule. It is worth noting that, when we design high-performance molecules, some performance parameters for the molecule are competing with each other. Therefore, finding a balance between the various properties in this work is necessary to get the maximum PCE value for OPVs.
 Fig. 8  The LUMO orbital compositions of each unit in c 99′BF derivatives were analyzed by the Hirshfeld method. 
The repeating unit numbers of molecules also have an impact on the energy level, VOC and kCS/kCR. From Table 2, we can see that the LUMO increases and the HOMO decreases with increasing repeating unit numbers, resulting in a decreasing energy gap. When the acceptor is composed of the same units, rather than the acceptor binding donor units (strong push–pull effect in the molecule), the change in the energy level of the acceptor is not obvious. In addition, increasing repeat units will reduce the VOC. From Fig. 5 and Table 3, it can be seen that with the increase of the repeating unit numbers, the molecular absorption spectrum exhibits an obvious redshift and there are two strong absorption peaks. When the repeating unit number is 4, the absorption spectrum of the D (570 nm) can make up for the weak absorption between the two strong absorptions of c4, which effectively enhances the JSC. The k value and the related parameters are listed in Table 4. From Table 4, the order of the kCS/kCR values is c2 > c3 > c4 > c5. Therefore, increasing repeating unit numbers lead to a decreasing kCS/kCR value, unfavourable exciton separation and larger recombination of electrons and holes. Based on the above parameters, we conclude that the molecular properties of the 3 units are not stable and do not reach the optimal value, and it is difficult for c3 to generate excitons. The 5 unit molecules may have small VOC and k values, whereas the 4 unit molecules possess matching spectra with the D and stable molecular properties, as well as better VOC and k values. Therefore, the molecules exhibit better performance when the repeating unit number is 4.
Conclusions
In this paper, we have carried out a comparative theoretical study on the photovoltaic performance of different conformations, steric configurations and repeating unit numbers for 99′BF derivatives based on the DFT and TD-DFT methods. The main results we obtained are as follows:
(i) Two conformations (c and p) for 99′BF were found by experiments and theoretical practices, and their photovoltaic performances were very different. Although the potential energy curve showed that the p conformation is unstable at room temperature, the p derivatives exhibited a better interfacial separation and recombination rate, which is the dominant conformation. This conformational study in the molecule provides more options for designing new acceptor SMs.
(ii) The effects of a linear and star steric configuration on molecular properties of 99′BF derivatives showed that linear molecules possessed good delocalization, high VOC, easy exciton dissociation, matching energy levels and absorption spectra with D, and large kCS/kCR compared to the star molecules. Therefore, the linear-type is the excellent steric configuration for 99′BF derivatives.
(iii) Different repeating unit numbers on the molecular properties showed that when the repeating unit number is small (2 or 3), molecular performance does not reach the optimal state and is not conducive to the exciton dissociation. When the repeating unit number is too large (5), the molecular performance has reached a stable value, but too many units are not conducive to the VOC, separation/recombination rate and experimental synthesis. Thus, the 4-unit molecule can balance the above mentioned defects and preferably express the molecular properties.
In summary, study of the different conformations, steric configurations and repeating unit numbers is an effective strategy for designing high-performance acceptor molecules. In this study, the p conformational, linear and 4-unit molecules could be a high-performance acceptor molecule. We hope that this work will provide theoretical and experimental assistance for designing high performance OPV non-fullerene SM acceptor materials.
