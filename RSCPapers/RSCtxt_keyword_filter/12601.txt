    , Accepted 2nd November 2021First published on 2nd November 2021AbstractSolvent additive (SA) treatment is the most effective strategy to obtain highly efficient non-fullerene organic solar cells (NF-OSCs). However, NF-OSCs from SA treatment usually exhibit different or even opposite effects on photovoltaic performance compared with fullerene-based OSCs. Despite the rapid progress in NF-OSCs from SA treatment, the working mechanism of SAs in the morphological optimization of NF-OSCs and their role in affecting the photovoltaic performance are still controversial, and systematic investigations are needed. In this work, two kinds of SA, non-aromatic solvent additives (NSA: DIO, DBrO) and aromatic solvent additives (ASA: DPE, CN), were applied to the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-based polymer PBDF-BDD and non-fullerene acceptor IT-4F to systemically investigate their effects on photovoltaic performance and their roles in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). The SAs have a positive impact on the power conversion efficiencies of NF-OSCs, but completely opposite trends of Voc and FF were observed for NF-OSCs processed with NSAs and ASAs. The devices with NSA obtained higher FF than devices with ASA. However, the NSA-added devices exhibited a Voc drop of about 0.1 V with a large energy loss (Eloss); in contrast, devices with ASAs showed minor change on Voc and thereby on Eloss. Further investigations indicated that NSA and ASA have different effects on inducing the crystallization of either PBDF-BDD or IT-4F, resulting in different donor/acceptor interactions and interfaces, thus producing the changes in Eg, ECT and energetic disorder, which were further investigated through GIWAXS and energy loss mechanism.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been paid more research attention recently because of their advantages such as light weight, low cost, flexibility and large-area processing through ink-jet printing and doctor-blading, etc.1–3 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been increased rapidly to over 18% in the past few years as a result of the emergence of ring-fused non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs) and the growth of polymer donors from the aspect of material evolution.4 Further improved photovoltaic performance will make OSCs a very promising renewable energy source compared to their inorganic counterparts.
In OSCs, an ideal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology of the active layer that has favorable interpenetrating networks and balanced exciton dissociation and charge transport is a prerequisite for obtaining high device performance.5–8 Thus, control of the thermodynamic and kinetic processes during film deposition of the donor and acceptor blend is crucial to BHJ morphology.9–12 To this end, various processing methods have been adopted to tune the morphology.13–16 Among them, adding solvent additive (SA) into the processing solvent of the active layer is the most successful and simplest strategy for achieving highly efficient OSCs.5,17–21 The small amount of SA during film drying could fine-tune the crystalline and mixed-phase region in the final nanostructure of the BHJ layer.22 The general recognized effect of SA in OSCs with fullerene acceptor is that SA enhances aggregation of the polymer donor due to its limited solubility with the polymer, prolonging the fullerene crystallization time to form a reduced fullerene domain, as SA is a good solvent for fullerene derivatives.23,24 Under such circumstance, the bicontinuous polymer and fullerene phase domains in the BHJ layer exhibit improved mobilities through the creation of hole and electron transport pathways, respectively, and also increased charge carrier collection efficiency, thus resulting in higher photovoltaic performance than the device produced without SA treatment.21,25 In the case of non-fullerene OSCs (NF-OSCs), though SA has been applied in device optimizations widely and successfully, it is difficult to directly implement the established rules in fullerene-based OSCs to modulate the BHJ morphology of NF-OSCs since the polymer and NFA have different mixing enthalpies.26–28 For example, Baran et al. reported that the SA 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) gave a completely opposite effect on the photovoltaic performance of PTB7-Th:ITIC- and PTB7-Th:PC71BM-based devices.28 In addition, the application of SA in NF-OSCs is also unpredictable, i.e., DIO is the more preferred SA in some NF-OSCs, whereas some NF devices are more compatible with 1-chloronaphthalene (CN).29,30 This thus raises a remaining challenge in understanding the underlying mechanism of different SA types in BHJ morphology optimization, regarding the variety of successful SAs in state-of-the-art NF-OSCs, and deep insight into these mechanisms will also be very helpful in expanding the design and selection rules of polymer, acceptor, and SA.
The nano/microstructure of BHJ morphology comprises the donor phase, acceptor phase, and mixed-phase regions. Different treatments (i.e., addition of SA) during the film drying generate different phase purities and packing orientations of the polymer donor and acceptor, as well as different interfaces between the donor and acceptor phases.5,31 These variations are therefore expected to affect the short-circuit current density (Jsc), fill-factor (FF), and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs, resulting in the increase or decrease of PCE.32,33 For Jsc, although its value is mainly determined by the sunlight-absorbing capability of the donor and acceptor, BHJ morphology still can have an obvious effect.34 FF is a morphology-related parameter, and it is apparently involved with charge separation (exciton dissociation), extraction and recombination, which all are correlated with the nano/microstructure morphology of the BHJ layer.35 Improving the Voc through morphological optimization is complicated and less understood. Recent studies indicated that the charge transfer (CT) state and density of state (DOS) in the active layer could modulate the energy loss (Eloss), which is also referred to as voltage loss (Vloss = Eloss/q), and thereby the Voc is adjustable, as the CT and DOS can be controlled through optimization of the interfacial interactions between donor and acceptor.36,37 Generally, SAs can be classified into non-aromatic solvent additives (NSA) and aromatic solvent additives (ASA). These two kinds of SA have different boiling temperatures, vapor pressures and affinities to the donor and acceptor.38 When applied to the BHJ layer, these SAs will induce different crystallinities, molecular packing orientations and interfacial interactions in donor and acceptor phases, leading to the varied BHJ morphologies. As introduced above, these different nano/microstructure morphologies under NSA and ASA treatment will therefore provide the best scenario to understand the working mechanism of SAs in high-efficiency OSCs.
In this work, we selected a benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran and BDD-based polymer (PBDF-BDD) as the polymer donor and a representative ring-fused NFA, IT-4F, as the electron acceptor in NF-OSCs, and applied two NSAs [DIO, 1,8-dibromooctane (DBrO)] and two ASAs [CN, diphenyl ether (DPE)] as the representative SAs to systemically investigate their effects on the PCE, Voc, and FF. We find that the devices give completely opposite trends on Voc when processed with NSAs versus ASAs. The addition of NSAs caused a decreased Voc from 0.937 V to 0.856 V with a large Eloss of 0.714 V despite the device obtaining the highest PCE of 0.5% DIO, whose enhancement is mainly attributed to the increase of FF from 65.0% to 70.4% and the Jsc. Meanwhile, the addition of ASAs also improved the PCEs with a small Eloss, but the increase is mainly due to the slightly enhanced FF, where the Voc changes are negligible. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) results showed that NSAs and ASAs induced different crystallinities and aggregations of the PBDF-BDD donor and IT-4F acceptor, resulting in different morphologies and donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces in the blend films, which then have different impacts on these photovoltaic parameters. Their detailed effects on FF and Voc were systematically investigated, and the partial relationships of FF and Voc with crystal coherence length (CCL), D/A interface and energetic disorder are also proposed.
2. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structure of the donor polymer PBDF-BDD, electron acceptor IT-4F, and the four representatives SAs DIO, DBrO, DPE and CN. The synthetic procedures for PBDF-BDD are described in the ESI,† and the absorption spectra of PBDF-BDD and IT-4F, as well as their energy alignments, are shown in Fig. 1b and c, respectively. PBDF-BDD exhibits absorption in the region of 500–700 nm, which is well matched with IT-4F's absorption in the region of 600–800 nm. Generally, the complementary absorption is beneficial for obtaining a higher Jsc. As shown in Fig. 1c, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of PBDF-BDD are determined to be −5.36 eV and −3.78 eV, respectively, which provide enough driving force and lead to high performance. For these SAs, DIO and DBrO belong to NSA and have the low vapor pressure (Vp) of 0.037 and 0.53 Pa, respectively. In contrast, the ASAs CN and DPE have a high Vp of over 2 Pa (Table S1†). It is known that different Vp will have different mechanisms to improve the morphology, which may cause different performance changes of the devices.38

The photovoltaic performance of PBDF-BDD:IT-4F devices under different SAs was studied in the device structure ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoOx/Ag. We first focused on the Voc change with different amounts of SAs. As shown in Fig. 1d, the Voc in the PBDF-BDD:IT-4F device is gradually decreased after adding DIO and DBrO as SAs, and the Voc change is more than 0.1 V with 5% DIO or DBrO. In contrast, the Voc in the PBDF-DBB:IT-4F device has negligible differences with different ratios of DPE and CN SAs. Since the same type of SA displayed similar trends, in this case, DIO and DPE as the NSA and ASA, respectively, were selected to further investigate their effects on the device performance.
The J–V curves and corresponding parameters of devices with different volume ratios of DIO and DPE are shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1. It was found that both DIO and DPE could efficiently enhance the device performance of PF-BDD:IT-4F, but they have apparently different effects on these photovoltaic parameters. As shown in Table 1, the best PCE was achieved after adding 0.5% DIO, with a lower Voc of 0.856 V, a higher FF of 70.4% and a higher Jsc of 17.67 mA cm−2, compared to the device without SA. Further increasing the amounts of DIO reduces the device performance, with decreasing Voc, Jsc and FF. However, the addition of DPE induced a very slight change on Voc, with an increase in Jsc and a decrease in FF while increasing the DPE amount. The best device was achieved at 1% DPE due to a higher Voc of 0.944 V and a higher FF of 67.1% compared to the device without SA. Obviously, the addition of DIO and DPE can increase Jsc and FF to different extents, but their effects on Voc are completely opposite. It has been reported that changes in aggregation behavior caused by SAs will affect the driving force to dissociate excitons and the molecular arrangement of the D/A interface. In this case, the Voc change trend of the devices with DPE and DIO can be inferred.39

Fig. 2c shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of these devices. With the addition of DIO, it can be seen that at low amounts (0.5–1%) of DIO, the devices exhibited a higher photoresponse at ∼450–650 nm than the device without DIO, which is believed to be caused by the increased crystallinity of PBDF-BDD as induced by DIO. Further increases in the amount of DIO may lead to excessive crystalline phase and make little contribution to the photoresponse. More interestingly, the EQE curves of the devices with DIO were obviously red-shifted by ∼20 nm compared to those without DIO. This red-shift at the longer wavelength region is thought to be the result of the formation of J-aggregation in the IT-4F phase, in which the DIO, as a good solvent, induces the re-arrangement of the IT-4F molecular backbone during film deposition.40 The stronger and red-shifted photoresponses from PBDF-BDD and IT-4F therefore contributed to the higher Jsc measured after adding a small amount of DIO. Meanwhile, in PBDF-BDD:IT-4F devices with DPE, the EQE edges are the same as the device without SA. This also shows that the photoresponse contributed by PBDF-BDD is stronger, while the photoresponse from IT-4F is even lower than the device without DPE. To better understand these different changes with DIO and DPE in EQE, the absorption spectra of PBDF-BDD and IT-4F blend films with different amounts of DIO and DPE were measured. As shown in Fig. 2d, the absorption spectra of IT-4F in the blend film is slight blue-shifted compared to the pristine IT-4F film (Fig. 1b), indicating that the IT-4F molecular chains are conducive to forming H-aggregation in the blend with PBDF-BDD. With the addition of a small amount of DPE, the absorption spectra of blend films exhibited negligible changes compared with the pristine blend film. However, the blend films casted with the presence of DIO showed a significant red-shift, which is attributed to the J-aggregation of IT-4F molecular chains.39,40 These results indicate that DIO and DPE have different effects on PBDF-BDD and IT-4F molecular chains and their aggregation behaviors, thus resulting in variations of the photovoltaic parameters as discussed above.
The effects of DIO and DPE on morphology were measured by tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S1 and S2,† the root mean square roughness (RMS) of PBDF-BDD:IT-4F films gradually increased from 2.53 to 6.21 nm with the addition of DIO, which is believed to be caused by the DIO-induced crystallization of IT-4F molecules. In contrast, the blend films with DPE displayed a slightly increased RMS value of up to 3.85 nm, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced crystallinity of PBDF-BDD.
The molecular packing behaviors of PBDF-BDD:IT-4F blend films were investigated by GIWAXS. Fig. 3a shows the intensity profiles in the in-plane (IP) directions for PBDF-BDD:IT-4F films. The blend films without SAs (Fig. 3a) show a diffraction peak at 0.275 Å−1, which is attributed to the (100) lamellar peak of PBDF-BDD, while the diffraction peak of IT-4F was not observed. After adding DPE and DIO, the blend films exhibited similar (100) diffraction features of PBDF-BDD but with stronger peak intensities, indicating that both DPE and DIO could induce higher crystallinity of PBDF-BDD in the blend. In addition, the pronounced (100) Bragg peak of IT-4F at qr = 0.33 Å−1 started to appear in the IP direction after DIO was applied, which is believed to be caused by the low Vp value of DIO, allowing DIO to stay in the film for a longer time and, therefore, giving IT-4F more time to form larger crystals.19,38 In comparison, the IT-4F diffraction pattern under DPE treatment is still not observed, which means that DPE has minor effect on the formation of IT-4F crystals during film deposition.

As shown in Fig. 3b, all blend films exhibit the face-on orientation, with the (010) peaks appearing in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction when PBDF-BDD and IT-4F are mixed. It can be seen from Fig. 3c that the CCL increased significantly from 11.31 Å to 20.06 Å with the addition of DIO, indicating the addition leads to a higher molecular order and larger crystalline grains. In comparison, the CCL only has small changes after adding DPE (Fig. 3c and Table 1). FF is described as the ability of exciton dissociation and charge transport processes in OSCs, and a high charge carrier mobility often benefits from an optimal vertical morphology of the film, as the long-range ordered structure is essential for efficient charge transport. In this case, the crystallization of IT-4F played a key role in the whole power conversion process. The over-crystallization of IT-4F will negatively affect the charge carrier mobility, limiting the carrier transportation and increasing the charge recombination, thus decreasing FF. Consistent with expectations, FF first showed an improvement with the increasing amount of SAs and reached the best value at 0.5–1% SA, followed by a rapid decay (Fig. 3c). To further understand the relationship between the CCL and FF, their correlations are plotted in Fig. 3d. As expected, the devices with DIO and DPE exhibit a similar change trend. The FF showed gradual enhancement with the increase of CCL and then started to decrease, with a small increase at the end, indicating that pure PBDF-BDD and IT-4F domains, which increased in accordance with the growth of crystals, might become too large for efficient exciton dissociation. The charge-carrier mobilities measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method for these devices also confirmed these results and are consistent with the trend of FF change (Table S3 and Fig. S4c, d in ESI†).
As discussed above, the devices processed with DIO had reduced Voc, leading to a higher Eloss, and DEP has minor effect on Voc with a negligible change on Eloss. To better understand this, the Eloss mechanism in DIO- and DPE-treated devices were investigated. Generally, Eloss is defined as Eloss = EPVg − qVoc, where EPVg is the photovoltaic bandgap determined from the derivatives of the EQE spectra.41,42 The Eloss values of these devices are summarized in Table 2. The Eloss of the PBDF-BDD:IT-4F device without SA was 0.653 eV; after applying DIO as SA, the Eloss of the corresponding devices were obviously increased to 0.710–0.738 eV due to the decrease of Voc in these devices. As the Voc values in the devices with DPE had slight changes, Eloss therefore exhibited small variations, with the values of 0.642–0.661 eV. Based on the Eloss mechanism in the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory, Eloss is categorized into three parts.43  ΔE1 depends on adsorption above the bandgap and is unavoidable for any kind of OSC. Here, qVSQOC is the maximum voltage based on the SQ limit, which is proportional to the EPVg. As we demonstrate above, the addition of DIO causes the red-shift of absorption, which leads to the decrease of EPVg. In this case, after the addition of DIO, the value of qVSQOC drops from 1.324 eV to 1.288 eV. For the devices with varying ratios of DPE, the qVSQOC has no changes. However, the variation in ΔE1 for devices with DIO is negligible due to the variation in EPVg.

The second part, radiative-recombination loss ΔE2, is mainly attributed to the radiative recombination below Eg and is generally considered to be related to ECT and energetic disorder at the D/A interface. It is known that the absorption of CT state originates from the free-carrier bimolecular recombination at the D/A interface; moreover, the molecular orientation has a profound effect on the electron coupling between CT state and ground state (GS).44,45 Thus, the morphology of D/A interface plays a significant role in the Eloss of the OSC.46 To probe the CT state, the photovoltaic EQE (EQEPV) and electroluminescence (EL) of these PBDF-BDD:IT-4F devices processed with and without SAs were measured. As shown in Fig. 4 and S6,† the photocurrent response at low energies corresponds to the CT state transitions, which follows Urbach's rule and correlates with the energy disorder between the bulk and the CT interface. The Urbach energy (EU) follows the equation , where α(E) is the absorbance, and α0 is the fitting constant. EU values of these devices with different amounts of DIO and DPE are summarized in Table 2. For the devices with DIO (0–5%), the EUs were increased from 27.0 to 31.0 meV, which means the addition of DIO during film deposition increased the energetic disorder of the film. In the case of DPE, the EU values at different ratios of DPE had negligible changes compared to that in the device without SA (Table 2), indicating no disturbance of the energetic disorder. The large EU corresponds to a broad width of the tail of the density of state (DOS), and the broad width will lead to a significant decrease in ΔE2.36,47
Furthermore, from the onset of the EQE spectrum, a Gaussian fit was derived based on the Marcus theory to determine ECT.48  

Table 1 summarizes the ECT values of the devices with different ratios of DIO and DPE. It can be found that the ECT decreases from 1.471 eV to 1.386 eV after adding 0.5% DIO. However, the addition of 0.5% DPE resulted in the opposite change in ECT value, obtaining an increase to 1.487 eV, which also corresponds to a decrease in ΔE2. It is well known that EPVg − ECT is defined as driving force. The devices, after adding DIO, show a larger driving force; there is a greater probability for the recombination to occur through the CT states.
The third part, ΔE3, is attributed to non-radiative recombination. We use EQEEL to estimate ΔE3 based on the equation ΔE3 = −kBT × ln(EQEEL). As shown in Table S4,† the device without SA had an EQEEL value of 2.18 × 10−5, while EQEEL in devices with DIO treatment was decreased to 2.42–10.40 × 10−6. In comparison, after adding DPE, the devices showed little change on EQEEL (1.65–2.73 × 10−5). In addition, EQEEL values under various electric fields were also measured, as shown in Fig. 4. It is well known that EQEEL is independent of bias voltage under a low trap density. However, the EQEEL of the devices showed apparently bias-dependent characteristics when DIO was added, while the devices with or without DPE showed bias-independent characteristics, and these results indicate that the addition of DIO in the film deposition actually increased the trap density of the resulting device, which in turn increased the ΔE3. As expected, the ΔE3 increased to 0.320 eV with 0.5% DIO from 0.268 eV without DIO, and the devices with or without DPE treatment provided negligible changes on ΔE3. These results further indicate that the addition of DIO or DPE generates different interaction behaviors at the D/A interfaces, which then affect the energy loss and also the molecular packing behavior of PBDF-BDD and IT-4F.

Moreover, transient photovoltage (TPV) measurements were carried out to evaluate the charge extraction and recombination dynamics (Fig. S7†). Devices with and without DPE showed a slower TPV decay and a longer charge carrier lifetime than those of DIO-treated devices. The charge carrier lifetimes of DPE-treated devices are 5.84–6.48 μs, and the DIO-treated devices decreased to 3.83–4.73 μs. The result indicates that the charge carrier recombines less easily in the DPE-treated devices. In addition, it has been reported that the “alloy” formed by mixing the donor and acceptor produces a new electronic state that exhibits slower TPV decay as a function of the “acceptor.” As the “acceptor alloy” forms, it will impact the LUMO energy level, producing a more significant energy shift and greater Voc.49,50 Based on the above analysis, the higher Voc in the DPE-treated devices is therefore attributed to the low charge carrier recombination, low energy disorder and the higher EPVg than that of DIO-treated devices. This can partially explain the changes in the Voc of devices.
3. Conclusion
In summary, we have systematically investigated the effect of SAs on morphology regulation and Eloss. In experiments, the addition of NSAs and ASAs caused differences in the crystallization of the donor and acceptor, resulting in different morphologies. The addition of NSAs (DIO) significantly enhances the J-aggregation of IT-4F, which is conducive to charge separation and transfer, resulting in more balanced charge mobility and higher FF, but decreased Voc. In contrast, the addition of DPE shows slight changes in Voc with minor influence on IT-4F. We investigated the associated Eloss and quantified the three parts of the Eloss in comparison. Results show that the decreased Voc and higher Eloss of DIO-added devices are mainly due to the increase of energetic disorder and the decrease of ECT, which lead to higher ΔE2 and ΔE3. Actually, the increased aggregation also resulted in decreased EPVg with the added DIO, leading to lower Voc. Our results offer a deep insight into the effects of the addition of different types of SAs on morphology regulation and Eloss, which can guide us to optimize the device performance in a targeted manner.
