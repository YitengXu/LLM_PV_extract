    , Accepted 24th July 2015First published on 27th July 2015AbstractA novel asymmetrical squaraine derivative bearing a cyano-substituted indoline end-capping group, namely ASQ-5-CN, was designed and synthesized. In comparison with the noncyano-substituted ASQ-5, ASQ-5-CN showed an analogous absorption band-gap in the thin solid film state, but a 0.11 eV lowered HOMO energy level, which led to a higher Voc. Density functional theory calculation results revealed that the dipole moment of ASQ-5-CN was over double that of ASQ-5. Hence the stronger dipole–dipole interactions of ASQ-5-CN might trigger more intense intermolecular packing in ASQ-5-CN, which should account for the higher hole mobility of ASQ-5-CN than that of ASQ-5 (4.00 × 10−5vs. 1.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Accordingly, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction small molecular organic solar cells using ASQ-5-CN as the electron donor exhibited a much higher PCE (5.24%) than that of the reference compound ASQ-5-based device (4.22%) due to its simultaneously enhanced Voc (0.92 vs. 0.82 V), Jsc (11.38 vs. 10.94 mA cm−2) and FF (0.50 vs. 0.47). Additionally, the PCE of the ASQ-5-CN-based device could be improved to be as high as 6.11% when measured at 80 °C, which is the record PCE among the hitherto reported squaraine-based solution-processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells.
1. Introduction
Owing to the well-defined molecular structure and molecular weight, high purity and good batch to batch reproducibility of small molecular compounds, solution-processed bulk-heterojunction small molecular organic solar cells (BHJ-SMOSCs) have been demonstrated to be a competitive alternative to their polymeric counterparts recently.1–7 Among the numerous kinds of small molecular OSC materials, squaraine dyes have drawn much attention because they not only possess high molar extinction coefficients, but also show intense and broad absorption in the Vis-NIR spectral regions.8–20 Nevertheless, although many efforts have been devoted to the exploitation of novel squaraines for OSC applications, the performance of photovoltaic squaraines is still unsatisfactory. For example, the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solution-processed squaraine-based BHJ-OSCs is only 5.50%, note that the squaraine compound used just possesses a symmetrical molecular structure with a D–A–D skeleton.21
In comparison with symmetrical squaraines (SSQs), asymmetrical squaraines (ASQs) bearing a D–A–D′ rather than a D–A–D molecular skeleton should be more promising due to their better structural tunability.22,23 Consequently, recently, we have been devoted to the development of novel ASQ materials for BHJ-OSC applications, in which 1,1,2-trimethyl-1H-benzo[e] indole acts as the D subunit, a squaric acid core acts as the A subunit, and a 2,6-dihydroxyphenyl group acts as the D′ subunit.24–27 Through delicate modulation on the end-capping group of the D′ segment, such as diisobutylamino, 9-carbazyl, diarylamino, tetrahydroquinoline and indoline, a series of ASQ materials was achieved, and one of them, bearing an indoline end-capping subunit (named ASQ-5, molecular structure shown in Fig. 1), displayed the highest photovoltaic performance (PCE = 4.29%). These encouraging results indicate that ASQ derivatives could act as prospective OSC materials, and the indoline unit could serve as a quite promising end-capping unit to construct high performance photovoltaic ASQ materials. However, the performance of the ASQ-5-based BHJ-SMOSC was still inferior to that of the device using a SSQ compound as the photovoltaic material,21 which should be ascribed to its relatively low open-circuit voltage (Voc, 0.81 V) stemming from the relatively high HOMO energy level of ASQ-5 (−5.09 eV).25 Therefore, we aimed to exploit ASQ-5 derivatives with a lower HOMO energy level, so that an enhanced Voc could be expected.

Owing to the strong electron-withdrawing nature and linear geometry of the cyano groups, cyano-substitution is a well-adopted strategy with regard to the lowering of the HOMO energy levels of OSC electron donor materials.28,29 Moreover, according to Cha's report, the cyano-modified conjugated polymer shows higher crystallinity than its unmodified counterpart, resulting in an OSC with a higher fill factor (FF) and PCE.30 However, most of the current studies have been focused on cyano-substitution on the vinylic linkage of the molecular skeleton of photovoltaic materials and the dicyanovinyl-substituted compounds,31–36 yet never has concern been paid to the effect of cyano-substitution on the end-capping groups in OSCs. Consequently, a new asymmetrical squaraine (named ASQ-5-CN, molecular structure shown in Fig. 1) bearing a cyano-substitution on the indoline end-capping unit of ASQ-5 was designed and synthesized, and the substitution effect of the cyano group on the end-capping segment of ASQ compounds has been investigated.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Instruments and characterization

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured using a Bruker Avance AV ΙΙ-400 MHz spectrometer, and the chemical shifts were recorded in units of ppm with TMS as the internal standard. A high resolution mass spectrum was obtained from a Shimadzu LCMS-IT-TOF. Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) was performed on a Perkin-Elmer TGA Q500 instrument in an atmosphere of N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. The purity of ASQ-5-CN was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (EZChrom Elite, Hitachi, equipped with DAD and RI detectors). Electronic absorption spectra of both the solution and thin film samples of the two ASQs were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer Lamdba 950 UV-Vis scanning spectrophotometer. The ground-state geometries and electronic structures of the two ASQs were calculated with Gaussian 09 software, using density functional theory (DFT) based on the B3LYP/6-31G(d) and B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) levels. The solution samples were prepared in chloroform solution at a concentration of 3.0 × 10−6 mol L−1, while the film samples were obtained by spin-coating from chloroform solution (4 mg mL−1, 1500 rpm/45 s) on quartz substrates. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out in 2.5 × 10−4 mol L−1 anhydrous dichloromethane (DCM) with tetrabutyl ammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 using a LK 2005A electrochemical workstation. The CV system was constructed using a Pt disk, a Pt wire, and a Ag/AgNO3 (0.1 mol L−1 in acetonitrile) electrode as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively, and the potential of the Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode was internally calibrated with the ferrocene/ferrocenium redox couple (Fc/Fc+), which has a known reduction potential of −4.80 eV relative to the vacuum level. The morphologies of the active layers were analyzed through atomic force microscopy (AFM) in tapping mode in air at room temperature using a Bruker instrument, and the active layers were fabricated on ITO/MoO3 (8 nm) substrates.
2.2 Device preparation and characterization
Small molecular bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells were fabricated using indium-tin-oxide (ITO) coated glass as the substrate. The sheet resistance of ITO is 15 Ω sq−1. Patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic bath for 20 min each. The cleaned substrates were dried in an oven at 65 °C for 12 h before use. The substrates were treated by UV-ozone for 20 min, then immediately transferred into a high vacuum chamber for deposition of 8 nm MoO3 at a pressure of less than 1 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 0.2 Å s−1. Subsequently, photoactive layers (thickness 60 nm, 3000 rpm/45 s) were fabricated by spin-coating a blend of the asymmetrical squaraines and PC71BM in chloroform with a total concentration of 18 mg mL−1 in a N2-filling glovebox at 25 °C. Finally, the substrates were transferred back to the high vacuum chamber, where BCP (6 nm) and Al (100 nm) were deposited as the top electrode at pressures of less than 8 × 10−5 Pa with a rate of 0.20 Å s−1 and 2 × 10−4 Pa with a rate of 1.5–4.0 Å s−1, respectively, resulting in a final OSC with the structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/ASQ:PC71BM/BCP (6 nm)/Al (100 nm). The active area of the OSC cell is 9 mm2. Current density–voltage (J–V) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) characterizations of the organic solar cells were performed on a CEP-2000 integrated system manufactured by Bunkoukeiki Co. The integration of the EQE data over an AM 1.5G solar spectrum yielded calculated Jsc values with an experimental variation of less than 5% relative to the Jsc measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G light illumination. Hole-only and electron-only devices were fabricated with the structures of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/ASQ (40 nm) or ASQ:PC71BM (60 nm)/MoO3 (8 nm)/Al (100 nm) and ITO/ZnO (20 nm)/ASQ:PC71BM (60 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Al (100 nm), respectively.
2.3 Synthesis
Intermediate 4 and reference compound ASQ-5 were prepared according to the procedures described in the literature.25n-Butanol and toluene were distilled from sodium freshly prior to use. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources and used as received without further purification.

5-Cyanoindoline (1)37. 
To an acetic acid suspension (20 mL) of 5-cyanoindole (1.0 g, 6.94 mmol) was added NaBH3CN (2.62 g, 41.6 mmol) at 25 °C. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for one day. After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was poured into icy 4 M aqueous NaOH solution until a strongly basic pH was obtained. The crude product was extracted with dichloromethane, evaporated under vacuum, and purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate = 6:1) to afford compound 1 as a white solid (0.70 g, 69%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 7.31–7.29 (m, 2H, Ar H), 6.55 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, Ar H), 3.69 (t, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz, CH2), 3.08 (t, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz, CH2).


1-(3,5-Dimethoxyphenyl)indoline-5-carbonitrile (2). 
A mixture of 1 (0.70 g, 4.79 mmol), 1-bromo-3,5-dimethoxybenzene (1.09 g, 5.03 mmol), NaOBu-t (sodium tert-butoxide) (0.69 g, 7.19 mmol), Pd(OAc)2 (palladium(II) acetate) (22 mg, 1.5%), and P(t-Bu)3HBF4 (tri(tert-butyl)phosphine tetrafluoroborate) (56 mg, 4%) were dissolved in 50 mL of toluene and refluxed under Ar for 12 h. The reaction mixture was cooled down and filtered to remove insoluble material, then the solvents were removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate = 5:1) to afford compound 2 as a white solid (1.10 g, 89%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 7.36 (d, 2H, J = 8.0 Hz, Ar H), 7.07 (d, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, Ar H), 6.39 (d, 2H, J = 2.0 Hz, Ar H), 6.22 (t, 1H, J = 2.0 Hz, Ar H), 4.05 (t, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz, NCH2), 3.81 (s, 6H, OCH3), 3.17 (t, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz, CH2); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 161.6, 150.8, 144.1, 133.1, 132.0, 128.1, 120.4, 108.1, 100.5, 98.0, 95.0, 55.4, 52.6, 27.4; MS: m/z [M + H]+ 281.2.


1-(3,5-Dihydroxyphenyl)indoline-5-carbonitrile (3). 
Compound 2 (1.0 g, 3.53 mmol) was added to 60 mL of anhydrous CH2Cl2, then boron tribromide (28 mL of 1 M solution in CH2Cl2, 28.2 mmol) was added dropwise slowly in an ice bath. The solution was stirred under room temperature for 24 h, then was decanted to 100 mL of ice water to remove any excess BBr3. The organic phase was separated, and the aqueous phase was extracted with CH2Cl2 (20 mL × 3) three times. The combined organic phases were washed with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution and water in sequence, then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removing the solvent under vacuum, a yellow solid compound 3 (0.80 g, 89%) was obtained. Compound 3 was used in the next step of reaction without further purification.


4-((3-Butyl-1,1-dimethyl-1H-benzo[e]indol-3-ium-2-yl)methylene)-2-(4-(5-cyanoindolin-1-yl)-2,6-dihydroxyphenyl)-3-oxocyclobut-1-enolate (ASQ-5-CN). 
A mixture of compound 4 (790 mg, 2.20 mmol) and 3 (700 mg, 3.75 mmol) in n-butanol (50 mL) and toluene (50 mL) were added into a round bottom flask. The mixture was refluxed with a Dean–Stark apparatus for 36 h. After the reactant was cooled down, the solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resulting crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography using dichloromethane/methanol (50:1, v/v) as the eluent to afford a green solid. The solid was recrystallized from a dichloromethane and methanol mixture (10:1, v/v) to afford green crystals of ASQ-5-CN (830 mg, 63%). M.p. 276–277 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 12.29 (s, 2H, OH), 8.24 (d, 1H, J = 8.8 Hz, Ar H), 7.99 (d, 2H, J = 8.8 Hz, Ar H), 7.69 (t, 1H, J = 8.0 Hz, Ar H), 7.57 (t, 1H, J = 7.6 Hz, Ar H), 7.45–7.35 (m, 4H, Ar H), 6.28 (d, 2H, J = 3.2 Hz, Ar H), 6.09 (s, 1H, CH), 4.31 (t, 2H, J = 7.2 Hz, NCH2), 4.11 (t, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz, NCH2), 3.19 (t, 2H, J = 8.4 Hz, CH2), 2.05 (s, 6H, CH3), 1.95–1.87 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.57–1.48 (m, 2H, CH2), 1.05 (t, 3H, J = 7.2 Hz, CH3); 13C NMR (100 MHz, CDCl3, ppm) δ: 184.0, 180.8, 177.1, 172.2, 168.1, 162.7, 162.2, 150.4, 148.5, 138.3, 136.8, 133.4, 132.9, 132.4, 130.6, 129.9, 128.3, 128.2, 128.1, 126.0, 122.8, 119.9, 111.6, 110.6, 105.1, 102.8, 97.6, 97.5, 88.7, 52.7, 52.2, 45.0, 30.0, 27.3, 26.2, 20.3, 13.8; purity: 100% (HPLC, eluent: THF/CH3OH = 1:9); HR-MS (ESI): m/z [M + H]+ calcd for C38H34N3O4, 596.2549; found, 596.2548; anal. calcd for C38H34N3O4: C 76.62, H 5.58, N 7.05; found, C 76.72, H 5.55, N 6.98.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic route to ASQ-5-CN is illustrated in Scheme 1. Intermediate 1-(3,5-dimethoxy-phenyl)indoline-5-carbonitrile (2) was prepared by the Buchwald–Hartwig reaction using 1-bromo-3,5-dimethoxybenzene and 5-cyanoindoline as reactants. Then the methoxy groups of compound 2 were deprotected in the presence of BBr3 to afford intermediate 1-(3,5-dihydroxyphenyl)indoline-5-carbonitrile (3), which was further condensed with compound 4 to afford the objective compound ASQ-5-CN with a satisfactory yield of 63%. The solubility of ASQ-5-CN was found to be much inferior to that of the reference compound ASQ-5 in common organic solvents (e.g., 6 vs. 40 mg mL−1 in chloroform), indicating that the cyano-substituted ASQ-5-CN possessed much stronger intermolecular interactions than ASQ-5. As shown in Fig. 2, ASQ-5-CN displayed a higher decomposition temperature (Table 1) than that of ASQ-5, which is indicative of the enhanced thermal stability of ASQ compounds upon cyano-modification.

3.2 Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of the two ASQs in dilute chloroform solution and in thin film states are shown in Fig. 3, and the data are summarized in Table 1. Similar to ASQ-5, the cyano-substituted compound ASQ-5-CN also showed intense absorption at 550–700 nm in dilute solution, with a considerably high molar extinction coefficient of >105 M−1 cm−1. In dilute solution, the maximum absorption wavelength of ASQ-5-CN was blue-shifted by 14 nm from that of ASQ-5, which might arise from the reduced electron-donating capability of the end-capping group due to the presence of an electron-deficient cyano group in this compound. In comparison with their dilute solution samples, both ASQ-5-CN and ASQ-5 showed much bathochromic-shifted and broadened absorption spectra in the thin solid film state, but ASQ-5-CN exhibited a more bathochromic-shifted (55 vs. 41 nm) and broadened (full width at half maxima, FWHM: 3791 vs. 3336 cm−1) absorption spectrum than that of ASQ-5, which should be propitious to the harvesting of solar irradiation.10 In fact, although in solution state, the λabsmax of ASQ-5-CN was blue-shifted by 14 nm to that of ASQ-5 and the FWHM of the two compounds were identical (∼900 cm−1), the solid film samples of both ASQ-5-CN and ASQ-5 displayed an analogous absorption maximum of 718 nm. Consequently, there may exist more intense intermolecular π–π stacking interactions in ASQ-5-CN than in ASQ-5.38 Determined from the onset position of the absorption spectra of the two ASQs in the thin films, the optical band-gaps of ASQ-5-CN and ASQ-5 were both 1.43 eV.

3.3 Electrochemical properties
To estimate the energy level of ASQ-5-CN, its electrochemical property was investigated by cyclic voltammetry. As shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2, during the anodic scan, a quasi reversible oxidation process could be observed in ASQ-5-CN, and its Eonsetox was determined to be 0.40 V relative to Fc/Fc+. Hence, by comparison with the Fc/Fc+ redox couple whose energy level is −4.80 eV in a vacuum, the HOMO energy level of ASQ-5-CN was calculated to be −5.20 eV, which is 0.11 eV lower than that of ASQ-5 (−5.09 eV). Consequently, the introduction of a cyano-substitution on the indoline end-capping segment could endow ASQ-5 derivatives with a lower HOMO energy level, which could be beneficial to the enhancement of Voc in their corresponding OSC device.39 Moreover, deduced from the HOMO level and the corresponding optical band-gap, the LUMO energy level of ASQ-5-CN was calculated to be −3.77 eV, which was also 0.11 eV lower than that of ASQ-5, hence a lower energy loss could be expected during the electron transfer processes from the ASQ donors to the PC71BM acceptor.39

3.4 DFT calculation
To gain further insights into the effects of cyano-substitution on the electronic properties of ASQ-5-CN, DFT calculations were performed on ASQ-5-CN and ASQ-5, the computational results are shown in Table 2, and the electron density distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of the two ASQ compounds are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). According to the calculation results, the HOMO energy levels of ASQ-5 and ASQ-5-CN were −5.17 eV and −5.33 eV, respectively, while the LUMO energy levels of ASQ-5 and ASQ-5-CN were −2.94 eV and −3.06 eV, respectively. These data well reproduce their corresponding electrochemical characterization results, indicative of the reliability of the calculation results. More importantly, as shown in Fig. 5, both of the two ASQ derivatives showed a similar direction of the dipole moment, however, ASQ-5-CN exhibited a dipole moment more than double that of ASQ-5 (11.26 vs. 3.73 D), indicating that significantly stronger dipole–dipole interactions should exist in ASQ-5-CN, which may endow the compound with a more enhanced higher hole mobility.40–42 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to reveal that cyano-substitution would result in an increased dipole moment of the OSC materials. This finding should be of great importance for the recognition of the role that cyano-substitution might play in the rational molecular design of photovoltaic materials.

3.5 Hole and electron mobilities
The mobility of the two pristine ASQs as well as the ASQ/PC71BM (1:3, wt%) blend film samples were evaluated by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method,43 and the results are shown in Table 3. The hole mobility of the neat ASQ-5-CN film was calculated to be 4.00 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is 1.4 times higher than that of the ASQ-5 film (1.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). Besides, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the ASQ-5-CN/PC71BM blend film were calculated to be 3.46 × 10−5 and 7.74 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, which are also higher than those of the ASQ-5/PC71BM blend films (1.30 × 10−5 and 4.56 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively). Thus, the ASQ-5-CN/PC71BM blend film (μe/μh = 2.2) showed better balanced hole and electron mobilities than the ASQ-5/PC71BM blend film (μe/μh = 3.5). Upon thermal annealing at 80 °C for 10 min, all of the mobilities were slightly increased (vide.Table 3). In addition, when the carrier mobility measurement was tested at 80 °C, the hole and electron mobilities of the ASQ-5-CN/PC71BM blend film drastically increased to 11.0 × 10−5 and 13.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the μe/μh ratio decreased from 2.2 to 1.2, which is useful for an enhanced Jsc and FF.20 For both neat films and blend films, the ASQ-5-CN-based samples showed a much higher hole mobility than that of the corresponding ASQ-5 samples. Additionally, AFM characterization revealed that the ASQ-5/PC71BM and ASQ-5-CN/PC71BM blend films showed similar morphologies with quite smooth surfaces (Fig. 6), and both of their RMS values were slightly increased under thermal annealing. Therefore, the much increased hole mobility of the ASQ-5-CN-based samples can most likely be ascribed to its significantly higher dipole moment.

3.6 Organic solar cells
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of ASQ-5-CN, devices with the structure of ITO/MoO3 (8 nm)/ASQ:PC71BM (60 nm)/BCP (6 nm)/Al (100 nm) have been fabricated. For comparison, reference devices with ASQ-5 as electron donor material have also been fabricated under the same conditions. The representative data of these devices are summarized in Table 4, and the current density–voltage (J–V) curves as well as the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are shown in Fig. 7. Firstly, the effect of different blend ratios of ASQ-5-CN/PC71BM on the photovoltaic properties of the devices were investigated. When the composition of PC71BM increased from 1:2 to 1:3, the Jsc of the device increased slightly from 10.49 to 10.77 mA cm−2, but no distinct changes in both the Voc and FF could be observed, and the PCE of the devices was improved from 4.78% to 5.00%. With a further increased blending ratio of PC71BM from 1:3 to 1:6, both the Jsc and FF of the corresponding device decreased gradually from 10.77 to 10.03 mA cm−2 and from 0.50 to 0.43, respectively, hence the PCE dropped to 4.05%. Therefore, the highest PCE value was obtained when the ASQ-5-CN/PC71BM blend ratio was 1:3. It should be mentioned that when the D/A blend ratios decreased from 1:2 to 1:6, the PCE of these devices all were 4–5%, thus the photovoltaic performance of the OSC was not very sensitive to the D/A blend ratios.

(a) Devices tested at room temperature after being thermally annealed at 80 °C for 10 min; (b) device tested at 80 °C; (c) devices tested after being recooled down to room temperature. 
Consequently, a reference ASQ-5 device with a similar D/A blend ratio of 1:3 was fabricated, and the PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF of this device were 3.95%, 0.83 V, 10.35 mA cm−2, and 0.46 respectively, and each was inferior to that of the ASQ-5-CN device (5.00%, 0.93 V, 10.77 mA cm−2, and 0.50, respectively). The 0.10 V higher Voc of the ASQ-5-CN device relative to the reference device was consistent with the 0.11 eV decreased HOMO energy level of ASQ-5-CN than that of ASQ-5. Moreover, the ASQ-5-CN-based device also displayed a higher Jsc than that of the reference device, as the Jsc should correlate highly with the light-harvesting capability, carrier mobility, and morphology of the active layer.44–46 To elucidate the origin of the enhanced Jsc in the ASQ-5-CN device, the EQE curves of the two devices were recorded. As shown in Fig. 7d, in comparison with the reference device, the ASQ-5-CN device showed a narrower spectral response, but its EQE values at 300–700 nm were much higher. And the EQE data were in line with the absorption of the corresponding active layer (shown in Fig. S2, ESI†). Additionally, AFM characterization results revealed that both the two blend films showed similar morphologies and smooth surfaces (Fig. 6). Thus, the increased Jsc of the ASQ-5-CN device should chiefly originate from the higher hole mobility of its active layer. Additionally, the FF of the ASQ-5-CN-based device was also higher than that of ASQ-5 (0.50 vs. 0.46), which is attributed to its higher hole mobility and better balanced hole and electron mobilities.20 It should be pointed out that the high FF of 0.50 is, to the best of our knowledge, one of the highest FF values of solution-processed BHJ-OSC with squaraine derivatives as electron donor materials.
Upon thermal annealing, the performances of both the two devices were enhanced, with the best PCE of 4.22% for the reference device, and 5.24% for the ASQ-5-CN device. The enhanced PCE should be mainly attributed to the improved Jsc upon thermal annealing. Because the outdoor working temperature of solar cells is generally higher than the ambient conditions, these devices were also measured at 80 °C.47 Excitingly, for the ASQ-5-CN device, although its Voc (0.92 vs. 0.85 V) was found to drop slightly, both its Jsc (12.40 vs. 11.38 mA cm−2) and FF (0.58 vs. 0.50) were observed to be significantly enhanced (Table 4), hence the PCE is as high as 6.11%, which is about 17% enhanced over that of the as-prepared device (5.24%), which should be attributed to the significantly enhanced hole mobility and decreased μe/μh ratio.48 After being recooled down to room temperature, the device showed a similar performance (PCE: 5.23% vs. 5.24%) to that of the annealed one (Table 4), which shows that they are quite promising candidates for practical applications.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, with cyano-substitution on the electron-donating indoline end-capper of ASQ-5, the resulting asymmetrical squaraine ASQ-5-CN possessed comparable absorption characteristics to ASQ-5 in thin film states, but a lower HOMO energy level relative to ASQ-5. In addition to its 0.11 eV lowered HOMO energy level, ASQ-5-CN also showed a much enhanced dipole–dipole interaction than that of ASQ-5, hence a higher hole mobility could be acquired in ASQ-5-CN. Consequently, in comparison with that of the ASQ-5-based reference device, the solution-processed ASQ-5-CN-based BHJ-OSC showed a simultaneously enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF, and a high PCE of 6.11% could be achieved, which is the best PCE of solution-processed BHJ-OSC based on squaraine materials reported so far. Our results show the importance of molecular tailoring for achieving high performance photovoltaic materials, and the cyano-substitution on the end-capper of conjugated small molecules may be an important strategy for achieving high performance photovoltaic devices with a greatly improved Voc, Jsc and FF.
