    , Accepted 2nd November 2021First published on 2nd November 2021AbstractHole-transporting materials (HTMs) have a vital influence on the improvement of performance for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Starting from arylamine-based HTM (e.g., Spiro-OMeTAD), we design three molecules (CQ4–CQ6) with different conjugated π-bridge cores with a fused aromatic ring instead of the single carbon atom. To achieve a goal that provides an effective strategy for HTMs design, the frontier molecular orbitals, optical absorptions, and hole transport for these HTMs in this work were investigated using DFT and TD-DFT combined with Marcus theory. The simulated results indicated that CQ4 with better performance, such as good charge separation, smaller recombination energy, and the highest hole mobility, may be an alternative HTM for PSC applications. Therefore, the promising HTM of CQ4 was synthesized and further applied to PSC devices. The results show that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC device is 17.12%, while the CQ4-based PSC shows a better PCE of 17.48%, due to its high hole mobility and uniform smooth film morphology, which ultimately promoted a higher fill factor. In addition, the experimental data can reproduce the theoretical results very well, indicating that the provided model of molecular design is a feasible way to obtain the alternative HTMs.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted wide attention due to their low cost, ease of manufacture, and especially their excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has been increased from 3.8%1 to 25.5%.2 In general, the structures of PSC devices consist of FTO/ITO conductive glass, electron transport layer, perovskites, hole-transporting layer, and silver electrode (Ag).3 Hereinto, hole-transport materials (HTMs) as hole-transporting layers play a significant role to extract holes from perovskite to metal electrodes (e.g., Ag) in order to reduce non-radiative recombination at the interface, thus achieving a high efficiency of devices.4,5 So far, HTMs are mainly divided into inorganic materials (such as CuSCN and CuI)6,7 and organic materials (including organic small molecules and polymers).8–10 Organic small molecules have the advantages of accurate molecular weight, high purity, easy adjustment of molecular structure, and controllable energy level, which are considered ideal HTMs for PSC applications.11–13 In addition to PSC applications, organic π conjugated molecules have become potential materials for many applications due to their unique optical and electronic properties, such as organic light-emitting diodes, and organic solid state lasers.14–16
2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis (N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) as the most typical HTM is applied in PSC devices for achieving high PCE.17,18 The core configuration of spiro in Spiro-OMeTAD can improve the quality of film-forming by reducing the aggregation behavior of molecules and has high thermal stability.19–21 In recent years, a great deal of research indicated that the spiro core is also one of the ideal units for the construction of new HTMs.22–24 For instance, Xu et al.25 designed a spiro-based HTM (X60), which was applied to the device with a compact structure of TiO2/nc-TiO2/perovskite/HTM(X60)/Au for finally achieving a PCE of 19.84%. Gao and co-workers26 reported two novel di-spiro ring HTMs (G1 and G2), and the results showed that di-spiro HTMs with a large π-conjugated system can promote rigidity and crystallinity, which is good for improving the hole-transporting ability. The PCE of the G2-based device reaches 20.2%. In addition, large π-conjugate cores in arylamine-based HTMs can also promote π–π stacking, thus improving hole mobility26,27 Deng et al.28 reported two spiro-based HTMs (SC and ST), of which SC has extended π conjugation, high solubility, and low crystallinity, and PCE is up to 21.76%, which is attributed to its smooth and pinhole-free film morphology.
Although the spiro configuration in arylamine-based HTMs can yield a highly rigid structure through a high degree of distortion, its highly twisted structure will also weaken the interaction between molecules, which is not conducive to charge transfer to a certain extent.29,30 Moreover, the conditions for the synthesis of spiro cores are harsh. For example, the synthesis of Spiro-OMeTAD needs to be carried out at a low temperature (−78 °C), which limits its large-scale commercial development and application.31 Therefore, many efforts are remaining to be done to develop novel small-molecule HTMs as alternatives to Spiro-OMeTAD.32,33
In fact, a great deal of research has proved that it is a feasible strategy to simulate the geometric structure, optical absorption, and charge mobility of organic materials by combining Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time-dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) with Marcus theory.34–37 The providing theoretical models can screen the promising HTMs for further using these HTMs into PSC device applications. The strategy not only can provide an insight into the influence of molecular structure on material properties theoretically, but also can shorten the development cycle and reduce the development cost for promising HTMs. For example, in our previous work,38 we designed three HTMs (CQ1–CQ3) with different cores (dibenzofuran, dibenzothiophene, and dibenzoselenophene, respectively). According to theoretical calculations, CQ2 has better charge separation ability and higher hole mobility compared to CQ1 and CQ3. A potential HTM of CQ2 was synthesized and further applied in PSC devices to explore its device performance.
In this work, we attempted to construct twisted molecular structures by replacing single carbon atoms with fused aromatic rings. Fused aromatic rings extend the conjugation of the molecule compared to a single carbon atom. We designed three molecules (CQ4–CQ6), and the molecular structures are shown in Fig. 1. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, the designed CQ4–CQ6 is a twisted structure with extended π conjugate cores and four triphenylamine derivatives as terminal groups. Calculations using DFT, TD-DFT, and Marcus theory were used to study their frontier molecular orbitals, optical absorptions, and hole transport. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD and other designed molecules of CQ5 and CQ6, the theoretical results show that the designed CQ4 has the highest hole mobility, smaller recombination energy, and the best charge separation. To further investigate the influence of molecular structure on the device performance and verify the reliability of the calculated model in this work, the alternative HTM of CQ4 was synthesized and further applied to PSC devices. In fact, the synthetic routes of CQ4 are simpler than that of Spiro-OMeTAD, using the simple Suzuki coupling reaction with a yield of up to 88%. Due to the extended core of CQ4, it can be effectively stacked through intermolecular π–π interactions, leading to a better hole transport ability and intermolecular charge transfer (ICT). Moreover, CQ4 as HTM in PSC applications exhibits a matching energy level with that of perovskites and a better uniform film morphology on perovskite materials. The results showed that the PCE of the CQ4-based PSC device reached 17.48%, which is higher than the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device (17.12%) under the same conditions. Our work proves that the strategy of replacing the C atom of the spiro core with a fused aromatic ring is feasible. Moreover, the experimental data can reproduce the theoretical results very well, indicating that the provided model of molecular design is an effective approach to achieve the goal of molecular design for potential HTMs.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Theoretical simulations
Firstly, the electronic properties and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 were calculated using DFT to evaluate the matching degree of energy levels between the designed HTMs and perovskite (e.g., CsFAMA). The molecular structures of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 were optimized using B3P86/6-311G(d,p). Fig. S1 (ESI†) presents the optimized structures of the designed HTMs. The HOMO and LUMO values of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 were calculated by the following formula:39 HOMO(exp.) = 0.66HOMO(th.) − 1.75 R = 0.79(1) LUMO(exp.) = 0.69LUMO(th.) − 1.07 R = 0.88(2)
Combining the B3P86/6-311G(d,p) functional and basis set with eqn (1) and eqn (2), the calculated results of HOMO/LUMO for Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 were calculated as shown in Fig. 2(a). The calculated data are presented in Table S2 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2(a) and Table S2 (ESI†), one can see that the HOMO/LUMO (−5.06 eV/−2.09 eV) of Spiro-OMeTAD are basically consistent with the experimental HOMO/LUMO (−5.13 eV/−2.08 eV40). According to eqn (1), the HOMO values of CQ4–CQ6 are −5.22, −5.25, and −5.26 eV, respectively. According to eqn (2), the LUMO values of CQ4–CQ6 are −2.49, −2.50, and −2.82 eV, respectively. Importantly, the LUMO/HOMO energy levels of CQ4–CQ6 match with the conduction band (CB) (−3.90 eV41) and valence band (VB) (−5.60 eV41) of CsFAMA very well (see Fig. 2(a)). The HOMO levels of CQ4–CQ6 are higher than the VB of CsFAMA, which ensures the hole injection from CsFAMA to HTMs. The LUMOs of CQ4–CQ6 are higher than the CB of CsFAMA, which prevents charge transfer from CsFAMA to the metal electrodes. In addition, the FMOs distribution with π orbital characteristics usually plays a critical role in charge transport.42 As shown in Fig. 2(a), the HOMO orbitals of CQ4–CQ6 are delocalized on the whole molecular skeleton, which can increase electron coupling by reducing recombination energy and finally promoting carrier transport.43 The LUMO orbitals of CQ4–CQ6 are all distributed on the conjugated π-bridge, which indicates that CQ4–CQ6 all have good hole transfer capability.

The optical properties of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 in DCM solution were calculated by TD-PBE0/6-31G(d). The simulated absorption spectra of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are presented in Fig. 2(b). The optical parameters of absorption and emission are listed in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2(b) and Table 1, the maximum absorption wavelengths (λmax, abs) and oscillator intensities (f) of CQ4–CQ6 are 426 nm (0.03), 419 nm (1.22), and 482 nm (0.40), respectively. The λmax, abs of CQ4–CQ6 in the S0–S1 states mainly comes from the HOMO → LUMO transition. In addition, the absorption wavelength at the core of CQ4–CQ6 was also calculated, and the λmax, abs show the same trend: CQ4 (348 nm), CQ5 (340 nm), and CQ6 (404 nm), respectively. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, the λabs of CQ4–CQ6 are all red-shifted, which may be attributed to the introduction of strong conjugation, resulting in the enhancement of ICT.44 In addition, it has been reported that a smaller energy gap between the HOMO and the LUMO usually signifies a greater degree of redshift in the absorption spectrum.45 Table S2 (ESI†) indicated that the energy gaps of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are 2.97, 2.73, 2.75, and 2.44 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the redshift of their λabs. The emission wavelengths (λem) of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are 451, 472, 459, and 536 nm, respectively. The calculated Stokes shifts of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are 63 × 107, 46 × 107, 40 × 107, and 54 × 107 cm−1, respectively.

In order to further evaluate the charge transport of the charge transition from S0 to the S1 state, the electron density difference (EDD) plots of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are shown in Fig. 2(c). The blue and purple colors represent the increased and decreased electron density, respectively, indicating that the charge transfer of both Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 is mainly from the aromatic amine group to the π-bridge cores. The values of the transferred charge amount (Δq) of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are 1.206, 1.774, 1.613, and 1.675 |e|, respectively. In general, a large Δq value means a weaker Coulomb attraction and easier charge separation.46 In addition, a large electron transfer distance (ΔD) and a small overlap between the degree of density depletion and increment (w) can provide a better charge separation. The ΔD values of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are 0.514, 3.628, 4.298, and 4.284 Å, respectively. The w values of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are 0.83, 0.48, 0.58, and 0.50, respectively. The results show that compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, CQ4–CQ6 as HTM can ensure effective charge separation. In addition, it is worth noting that compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, CQ5, and CQ6, CQ4 has the largest Δq and the lowest w, showing the best charge separation ability.
Stability is also an important parameter for obtaining an excellent HTM. Generally, a parameter of absolute hardness (η) can be used to evaluate the stability of organic HTMs to some extent.47 As illustrated in Table 2, the η values of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are obtained by the formula: η = (IPa − EAa)/2, which are 2.73, 2.57, 2.38, and 2.17 eV, respectively. As shown in Table 2, the calculated results pointed that the designed HTMs of CQ4–CQ6 with good stability is close to that of Spiro-OMeTAD. However, CQ4 exhibits better stability than that of CQ5 and CQ6.

In addition, hole mobility is one of the important targets to study the hole transport ability of HTMs in PSCs. Usually, the Marcus electron transfer theory is used to calculate the charge-transfer rate (k).48 It is known that the recombination energy (λ) and the hole transfer integral (v) are the key parameters to determine k.49,50 In terms of the Marcus theory in eqn (S1) (ESI†), a large v, and a small λ always result in a higher charge-transfer rate. The λ values of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are calculated to be 0.169, 0.074, 0.092, and 0.070 eV, respectively. Compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, the designed molecules CQ4–CQ6 have a smaller λ value, indicating that CQ4–CQ6 have better hole transport ability in HTM films. This may be attributed to the extended π-conjugated core, which can have better hole-transport properties by intramolecular π–π stacking.51 The charge-transfer rate is also affected by another parameter, v. For v, it strongly depends on the electron coupling strength of adjacent molecules.50 In order to obtain the main hole transfer pathways, the crystal structure of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are predicted from the Material Studio software.52 The details of these calculations are given in the ESI.† For Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6, the crystal structures with the lowest total energy are presented in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The predicted crystal data are listed in Table S3 (ESI†). Table S3 (ESI†) indicated that the predicted results of the crystal structures for Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ5 belong to the P1 space group, and CQ6 belong to the P21 space group.
According to the predicted crystal structure, the main hole-hopping pathways of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are obtained and presented in Fig. 3. The corresponding parameters such as λh, vh, hole transfer rate(kij), center-of-mass distance ri (Å), angle of the hopping pathway relative to the crystal layer transport planar γi (°), angle of the path, crystal axis θi (°), and hole mobility uh of molecules Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are presented in Table 3. The calculated details are shown in the ESI.† The hole mobility (uh) of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 can be calculated based on Einstein relation combined with the Marcus equation.48 As shown in Table 3, the simulated uh of Spiro-OMeTAD is 2.60 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is larger than that of the experimental value (8.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) by two orders of magnitude approximately.40 Currently, it is acceptable to use the calculated values of the existing computational model to estimate the hole-transport ability of the designed organic materials (e.g., HTMs). Table 3 shows that the calculated results of uh for the HTMs of CQ4–CQ6 are 3.87 × 10−3, 6.76 × 10−6, and 1.61 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Compared with CQ4 and CQ6, CQ5 has the lowest uh value due to its larger λ and smaller v, resulting in a lower k and ultimately providing an inferior value of uh. It can also be seen in Table 3 that the value of uh for CQ4 is higher than that of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ5–CQ6, which is attributed to a small λ and a large v. This greatly improves the performance of CQ4 as HTM in PSC applications.

Then, we further analyzed the specific reasons for the hole mobility of these molecules. Usually, the face-to-face stacking in the molecular stacking model is in favor of orbital overlap, so there is considerable interaction in these pathways of the molecules, and the face to face stacking model of molecules gives a good v.53 In general, the v between adjacent molecules decreases exponentially with the increase in ri. The face-to-face stacking paths of both Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are T2, with ri values of 14.642, 11.672, 17.315, and 9.665 Å, respectively. Both the T2 pathways of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4–CQ6 are the shortest paths of hole transfer, so there are considerable interactions in these pathways of each molecule. Due to the large transmission distance between the dimers of CQ5, the molecular interactions in those paths are small, which ultimately provides a smaller v value. This prediction can be verified according to the v values in Table 3. The results show that the distance between the dimer and the stacking mode in the molecules has a significant effect on v, and the electron coupling plays an important role in determining the hole mobility. The λ of CQ4 is not the lowest, but its molecular stacking is more compact and provides a large v. Notably, although CQ6 has the smallest hole recombination energy, it shows lower mobility among all molecules. In other words, the stacking of molecules plays a central role in charge transfer mechanisms. In general, enhanced π–π conjugation of cores in HTMs can reduce the recombination energy, which is conducive to the improvement of hole mobility to further enhance the PCE of the PSC device to a certain extent.54,55 But a stronger core does not necessarily improve hole mobility and the device performance. For example, Nazeeruddin et al.56 reported two HTMs (TTPA–DBQT and TTPA–DBST), TTPA–DBST with stronger π–π conjugation than that of TTPA–DBQT. However, the conductivity and PCE value of TTPA–DBQT is higher than that of TTPA–DBST.
Based on the above theoretical results, it is found that CQ4–CQ6 have appropriate energy levels and good optical absorption, as well as good stability, which are crucial for potential HTMs for application in PSC devices. It is noteworthy that CQ4 not only has lower λ and larger v, but also has better charge separation ability compared with CQ5 and CQ6, which can effectively avoid adverse charge recombination effect and theoretically have the best hole transport ability (3.87 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1). In addition, the synthesis cost of CQ4 is lower than that of CQ5 and CQ6. To achieve a goal that verifies the computational method for the material design of alternative HTMs, the potential CQ4 as the target was further synthesized and used as an HTM to explore its performance in PSC devices.
2.2. Synthesis and material characterization
As illustrated in Fig. 4(a), the CQ4 was synthesized through a simple one-step Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction, which is much simpler and more effective than the complex and expensive synthesis of Spiro-OMeTAD, with a yield of up to 88%. The detailed synthesis of CQ4 is given in the ESI.† CQ4 was characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS), as shown in Fig. S3–S5 (ESI†). CQ4 can be dissolved in common solvents, such as chlorobenzene, tetrahydrofuran, ethyl acetate, dichloromethane, etc.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 in dichloromethane solution were investigated. Normalized absorption spectra and the corresponding parameters of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are presented in Fig. 4(b) and Table 4, respectively. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and Table 4, both Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 have two major absorption bands between 290 and 475 nm, which are consistent with the calculated results (see Fig. 2(b)). The absorption peaks in the short-wavelength region for Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are 304 nm and 292 nm, respectively, which may be caused by the n–π* transition of the triphenylamine groups.57 The absorption peak maxima of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are 386 nm and 430 nm, respectively, which is attributed to the π–π* transition from the HOMO to the LUMO.58 In addition, the wider absorption of CQ4 may be due to strong conjugation, thus enhancing intramolecular charge transfer. The absorption onsets (λonset) of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are 412 and 463 nm, respectively. The corresponding optical energy gap (Eg) of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 from λonset calculations are 3.01 and 2.68 eV, respectively. It can be found that the λonset of CQ4 exhibits a large extent of redshift than that of Spiro-OMeTAD, which indicates that CQ4 has stronger intermolecular interaction.59,60 It can be seen in Table 1 and Table 4 that the experimental value of absorption peak maxima for CQ4 (430 nm) and Spiro-OMeTAD (386 nm) is in accord with these simulated results (426 nm and 388 nm, respectively), indicating the reliability of the selected calculation method.

The energy levels of HOMO for Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 were measured from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) in dichloromethane solution. The cyclic voltammetry curve and electrochemical parameters are presented in Fig. 4(c) and Table 4. As shown in Table 4, the HOMO values of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are −5.12 eV and −5.35 eV, respectively. The HOMO level of CQ4 is significantly deeper compared with Spiro-OMeTAD, which may be attributed to the stronger π–π conjugation of CQ4.28 In addition, according to the formula: ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg, the LUMO values of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are −2.07 eV and −2.67 eV, respectively. As described in Fig. 5(a), the HOMO levels of both CQ4 and Spiro-OMeTAD are well matched with the VB of CsFAMA (−5.60 eV41), indicating that the holes can be effectively extracted from the perovskite layer to the hole transport layer. Both the LUMO energy levels for Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are higher than the CB of CsFAMA (−3.90 eV41), which prevents charge transfer from the CsFAMA to the Ag electrodes. In addition, it can be seen in Table 4 and Fig. 2(a) that the experimental values of HOMO/LUMO for Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.12 eV/−2.07 eV) and CQ4 (−5.35 eV/−2.67 eV) in this work are in accord with the calculated results (−5.06 eV/−2.09 eV and −5.22 eV/−2.49 eV), indicating the reliability of the selected calculation method.

Hole mobility is a very crucial parameter for HTMs applied in PSCs. Here, the hole-mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 were studied by a space-charge-limited currents (SCLCs) method. The J–V characteristics and relevant parameters of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are presented in Fig. 4(d) and Table 4. It can be seen in Table 4 that the hole-mobility of CQ4 is 9.82 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 higher than that (3.81 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of Spiro-OMeTAD. The higher hole mobility of CQ4 should be due to the introduction of the dibenzo[g,p]chrysene unit, which is expected to enhance the skeleton π-conjugation, contributing to more efficient intermolecular π–π stacking in CQ4-based HTM films.54 It is noteworthy that the experimental values of hole-mobility of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are consistent with the trend of our calculation results above (see Table 3), which further demonstrates that the strategy of obtaining potential HTMs through calculation is feasible. The higher hole-mobility of CQ4 may provide a higher FF, and its deeper HOMO level may increase the Voc.61 Therefore, CQ4 with higher hole mobility than that of Spiro-OMeTAD may be a potential candidate HTM for PSC device.
2.3. Photovoltaic performance
On the basis of Spiro-OMeTAD or CQ4 as HTMs, the photovoltaic properties of PSC devices were investigated. As shown in Fig. 5(b), the traditional PSC devices of FTO/TiO2/CsFAMA/HTM/Ag were fabricated. CsFAMA is an ion-mixed perovskite active layer (FAPbI3)0.875(MAPbBr3)0.075(CsPbI3)0.05(PbI2)0.03, which was reported by Wang and co-workers.41 The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the best devices for Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 as HTMs under 100 mW cm−2 AM 1.5G solar illumination are presented in Fig. 5(c). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 5. As shown in Table 5, the CQ4-based PSC device provided a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 20.94 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.066 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 78.28%, while achieving a PCE of 17.48%. Under the same conditions, the Spiro-OMeTAD-based PSC device yielded a slightly lower PCE of 17.12% with a Jsc of 21.94 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.064 V, and an FF of 73.30%. The higher hole mobility in CQ4-based PSC devices is mainly attributed to its higher FF. Fig. 5(d) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PSCs based on Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4. The devices based on Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 show strong EQE responses in the range of 350–750 nm. The integrated Jsc values of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are 20.14 mA cm−2 and 19.46 mA cm−2, respectively, which are in good agreement with Jsc values from the J–V curves (Table 5).

In order to examine the reproducibility of PCE for Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 based devices, the statistical data of photovoltaic parameters in box charts from 12 identical devices are plotted in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the corresponding parameters are illustrated in Table 5. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) and Table 5, it can be seen that both Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 in PSC devices yield good reproducibility. The unencapsulated device stability test of the PSC devices was based on Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 as HTMs in an N2 glove box in a dark room with a temperature of ∼298 K and 10–35% of humidity. The tested results are provided in Fig. S7 (ESI†). After 1000 h in the N2 atmosphere, the stability of the CQ4-based device is comparable to that of the Spiro-OMeTAD-based device.
The J–V curves and corresponding parameters of the PSC devices under the forward and reverse scans using the Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 as HTMs are depicted in Fig. S8 and in Table S4 (ESI†), respectively. The hysteresis index (HI) of devices based on Spiro-OMeTAD or CQ4 is calculated from the formula: HI = [(PCEforward – PCEreverse)/PCEforward] × 100%, to be 6.66% and 4.81%, respectively. Both the devices show a small hysteresis, and the J–V hysteresis can be ascribed to ion migration, trap states, or interface problems such as imbalance of charge transport.62–64 In addition, a slight hysteresis effect in the CQ4-based device may arise from the better hole-transport ability of CQ4 in comparison with that of Sprio-OMeTAD, making it more efficient to balance the transport of holes and electrons in the device.
2.4. Hole extraction and charge recombination at interfaces
The film morphologies of the HTMs with dopants were investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and the topographic AFM images of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 capping on the perovskite layers are shown in Fig. 6(a–c). The root mean square (RMS) roughness of the perovskite layer is 20.5 nm, and the RMS value is significantly reduced after spin-coating Spiro-OMeTAD or CQ4. The RMS roughness of the spin-coating Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 is 7.79 nm and 7.08 nm, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 6(a–c), the surface of the Spiro-OMeTAD film has obvious pinholes, and the surface of the CQ4 film is complete and smooth, indicating that the contact between CQ4 and perovskite interface is more effective. Therefore, the CQ4 film in the PSC device can provide good charge transfer from the perovskite to HTM and reduce the recombination loss, which leads to an ultimately increased FF.

Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is an efficient way to investigate the hole extraction on the perovskite/HTMs interface. As shown in Fig. 6(d), the perovskite film has a strong PL peak between 700 nm and 825 nm. When Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 are coated on the perovskite film, PL intensity is quenched. The results show that the holes at the interface between perovskite and HTMs have been extracted effectively. Especially, CQ4 yielded a slightly higher PL quenching efficiency compared to Spiro-OMeTAD, which confirms that CQ4 has a strong hole-extraction capability in PSCs and can transfer holes from perovskite to CQ4 more effectively. The hole extraction efficiencies at perovskite/HTMs interfaces have been explored by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurement. As presented in Fig. 6(e), the original perovskite film exhibits a long PL decay, which is strongly inhibited when the perovskite layer is in contact with HTM. The PL decay lifetimes for the Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4 films on the perovskite film are significantly shorter than the perovskite film. The results illustrate that CQ4 exhibits a comparable hole-extracting ability to Spiro-OMeTAD.
Compared to Spiro-OMeTAD, the CQ4-based devices have a similar twisted structure, but their photovoltaic efficiency is improved. The increase of PCE of CQ4 devices is mainly due to the increase of FF. In terms of molecular structure, the extended π-conjugation results in the different electronic properties of Spiro-OMeTAD and CQ4. The lower recombination energy of CQ4 results in the higher hole mobility of its film. In addition, CQ4 film has a more uniform surface morphology and slightly higher hole extraction ability than Spiro-OMeTAD film. Together, these factors indicated that the hole extraction and hole transport in the CQ4 film are promoted, which leads to increased interaction between the perovskite and HTMs, thereby reducing charge recombination at the perovskite/HTMs interface.65 Therefore, CQ4-based devices have stronger photovoltaic performance than Spiro-OMeTAD-based devices.
3. Conclusion
In this work, starting from the arylamine-based HTM (e.g., Spiro-OMeTAD), we design three molecules (CQ4–CQ6) with different conjugated π-bridge cores with a fused aromatic ring instead of the single carbon atom. To achieve a goal that provides an effective strategy for HTMs design, the frontier molecular orbital energy levels, optical properties, and hole mobility for these HTMs in this work were investigated using DFT and TD-DFT combined with Marcus theory. The simulated results indicated that CQ4 with better performance, such as good charge separation, smaller recombination energy, and the highest hole mobility, may be an alternative HTM for PSC applications. Therefore, CQ4 as a promising HTM was synthesized and applied in PSC devices. The results show that CQ4 is easy to synthesize and has a high yield (88%). The PCE of the PSC based on CQ4 is up to 17.48%, which is higher than that of the Spiro-OMeTAD (17.12%) under the same conditions. The better PSC performance of CQ4 than that of Spiro-OMeTAD is attributed to the improved hole mobility; uniform and smooth film morphology, which ultimately promoted a higher FF. This work proves that the strategy of replacing the C atom of the spiro core with a fused aromatic ring is feasible. Moreover, the experimental data can reproduce the theoretical results very well, indicating that the provided model of molecular design is a feasible way to obtain alternative HTMs.
