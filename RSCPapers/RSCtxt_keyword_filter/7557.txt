    , Accepted 31st July 2014First published on 4th August 2014AbstractCopolymers based on benzodithiophene and quinoxaline, represented by 4,8-bis(5-(3,4,5-tris(octyloxy)phenyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (TOBDT) and 2,3-diphenyl-5,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline (TQ1) or 10,13-bis(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (TQ2), were synthesized via a Stille coupling reaction. By increasing the conjugation in the TQ2 unit, the polymer based on TQ2 showed a narrower band gap (Eg), a lower highest occupied molecular orbital energy level and enhanced interchain π–π interactions. Polymer solar cells based on TQ2 showed a simultaneous enhancement of the open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) compared with polymer solar cells based on the TQ1 polymer. A good power conversion efficiency of 4.24% was achieved by solar cells based on the TQ2 polymer and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester composite. These preliminary results indicate that increasing the acceptor unit (quinoxaline) conjugation is an effective way of improving the performance of polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Much progress has recently been made in the development of polymer solar cells (PSCs), which are considered to be promising sustainable solar energy converters as a result of their unique advantages of low cost, light weight and potential application in flexible devices with large surface areas.1–6 It is widely recognized that the bulk heterojunction structure, which is formed by blending an electron-rich conjugated polymer as the donor and an electron-deficient fullerene as the acceptor, is the most efficient configuration for PSCs.7 The best fullerene derivative currently available for use in PSCs is [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) or PC71BM.1,2,4,8 Most efforts have focused on engineering the molecular structure to tune the band gaps (Eg) and energy levels of the polymer donors. High-performance PSCs require narrow band gaps and suitable energy levels to maximize the short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and high carrier mobility to facilitate hole transport. Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is one of the most promising donor materials as a result of its easy synthesis, high hole mobility and good solubility. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs based on P3HT can reach 7%, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of about 70%.5,9–12 However, the large Eg value for P3HT and relatively high energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) (about −5.0 eV) lead to narrow absorption spectra and a low value for Voc.
Alternating donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated copolymers can be used to overcome these issues because the absorption and energy levels of the copolymers can be easily tuned by engineering the molecular structures. Using this method, many different D–A copolymers have been synthesized and these materials show excellent photovoltaic properties with PCEs as high as 8–9%.13,14 Of these, the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) unit has been widely used as the donor unit in D–A copolymers and shows promising photovoltaic effects.15–20 Further research has been directed towards designing polymers based on BDT and high PCE values have been achieved21–25 by copolymerizing BDT with 4,7-bis(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole,26 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione,27 diketopyrrolopyrrole28 and thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene.29
In addition to these acceptors, electron-deficient quinoxaline-based units have also been studied and widely used as narrow Eg polymers for PSC applications30–34 because quinoxaline can be easily modified at the 2 and 3 positions. The quinoxaline derivative 2,3-diphenyl-5,8-di(thiophen-2-yl)quinoxaline (TQ1), which has two separated phenyl rings, has the advantages of easy synthesis and versatility. However, most of the polymers based on TQ1 have a large Eg and low charge carrier mobility33,35 as a result of the less planar structure caused by the two separated phenyl rings.36
We report here a more planar dibenzo[a,c]phenazine that facilitates intermolecular packing and charge transport of the acceptor unit. In addition, the extended π-conjugation of the fused quinoxaline functions as a stronger electron acceptor.36 3-(2-Ethylhexyl)thiophene was attached to both sides of dibenzo[a,c]phenazine to build a D–A–D structure with the purpose of obtaining a narrow Eg. Using this method, 10,13-bis[4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl]dibenzo[a,c]phenazine (TQ2) was synthesized. TQ2 can be easily purified by column chromatography because of the improved solubility when two 2-ethylhexyl chains are introduced. Interestingly, when a side chain is introduced to the 4-position of thiophene, there is almost no influence on Eg and sometimes Voc is improved. 4,8-Bis(2-(3,4,5-tris(octyloxy)phenyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (TOBDT) with six alkoxylated substituents has recently been designed by our group and this has improved the processing of the polymers due to its excellent solubility.37 Therefore the two polymers PTOBDTTQ1 and PTOBDTTQ2 were synthesized by copolymerizing TOBDT with TQ1 or TQ2, respectively.
Results and discussion

 Scheme 2  Synthetic routes used to obtain the monomers and copolymers. 
Considering the difficulty of purifying the target monomer TQ2, which consists of a more planar structure, 3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene was attached to both sides of monomer 2 via a Stille coupling reaction to increase the solubility of the TQ2 monomer. This may be beneficial for the molecular weight, which could affect the PCE of the device. The target monomers DBrTQ1 and DBrTQ2 were obtained after the bromination of the monomers TQ1 and TQ2, respectively, with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) in chloroform/acetic acid solution. The Stille coupling polymerization between the monomer TOBDTSn and DBrTQ1 or DBrTQ2 with a tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium [Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3] catalyst in toluene gave the polymers PTOBDTTQ1 and PTOBDTTQ2. The final polymers were purified using Soxhlet extraction and silica gel column chromatography and showed good solubility in organic solvents such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene at room temperature. The molecular weight of the polymers and their polydispersity index (PDI) were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using monodispersed polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent (Table 1). The number average molecular weight (Mn) and PDI of both polymers are 20 kDa, 1.08 and 20 kDa, 1.09, respectively. This may prove that the introduction of 2-ethylhexyl as a side chain to the 4-position of thiophene is helpful when the monomer has solubility problems. The decomposition temperatures (Td) of the polymers are 356 and 379 °C, respectively, indicating sufficient thermal stability for application in PSCs.

Optical properties

Fig. 1 shows the UV-visible absorption spectra of the polymers in chloroform solution and in thin films. Both of the polymers showed two absorption peaks in chloroform solution, which is a common feature of D–A polymers and is caused by the strong intramolecular charge transfer (CT) state. The absorption peak red-shifted for both the polymers in their thin film forms. The absorption around the CT band became stronger and wider, which is ascribed to intermolecular CT between the molecular backbones. PTOBDTTQ2 has a lower energy absorption than PTOBDTTQ1 in both solution and as a thin film. The maximum CT absorption (λmax) of PTOBDTTQ2 as a thin film was about 696 nm, i.e. bathochromically shifted about 59 nm from that of PTOBDTTQ1, indicating the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of TQ2 compared with TQ1. In addition, PTOBDTTQ2 showed more structural absorption than PTOBDTTQ1 in the thin film form. This is because the higher planarity of TQ2 compared with TQ1 led to strong aggregation after spin-coating. The strong absorption around 350–500 nm of both polymers are attributed to the π–π* transition of the conjugated backbone, which may help to absorb more sunlight as a result of the extended π–π conjugation of TOBDT. The absorption onsets of PTOBDTTQ1 and PTOBDTTQ2 in the film form are 739 and 778 nm, corresponding, respectively, to optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.68 and 1.59 eV. The Eoptg of PTOBDTTQ2 is lower than reported previously.33,35,36,38 These phenomena indicate that the more planar TQ2 unit not only effectively broadens the absorption spectra, but also exhibits good π–π stacking in the solid state, consistent with the design of the polymer.

Electrochemical properties
The oxidation potentials of the polymers were determined electrochemically by cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the polymer coated on glassy carbon electrodes (Fig. 2); the electrochemical data are summarized in Table 2. The HOMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated using the equation: HOMO = −[Eox − E(ferrocene)1/2 + 4.8] eV, where Eox is the onset oxidation potential. Thus the HOMO energy levels of PTOBDTTQ1 and PTOBDTTQ2 were calculated to be −5.33 and −5.42 eV, respectively. It is widely acknowledged that the Voc of PSCs is directly proportional to the difference between the HOMO energy level of the polymer donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the PCBM electron acceptor. Therefore it is not difficult to infer that PTOBDTTQ2 will have a higher Voc because of its deeper lying HOMO. In addition, the rotational angles caused by the 2-ethylhexyl side chain in TQ2 do not seem to affect the Voc and may even facilitate the performance of the device based on the HOMO energy level. The LUMO energy levels of the two polymers were calculated from the HOMO energy levels and Eoptg by the equation:LUMO = HOMO + Eoptg

The high LUMO energy levels of the two polymers ensure a sufficient driving force for CT from the polymer to the PCBM. Moreover, the LUMO energy level of PTOBDTTQ2, which has a more planar quinoxaline unit, is lower than that of PTOBDTTQ1. This is consistent with a previous report36 which suggested that the LUMO delocalization of the TQ1-based polymer is mainly limited to the quinoxaline unit while it is extended onto the fused ring system as a result of the enhanced planarity of the TQ2-based polymer.
Photovoltaic properties
Solar cells were fabricated by blending PTOBDTTQ1 or PTOBDTTQ2 with PC71BM. The photoactive layer was sandwiched between transparent ITO/PEDOT:PSS and reflective Ca/Al back electrodes with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTOBDTTQ1 or PTOBDTTQ2:PC71BM(1:2 w/w)/Ca/Al. The active layers of the devices were spin-coated from o-dichlorobenzene solutions of the polymer and PC71BM at a concentration of 30 mg mL−1. PC71BM was selected as the electron acceptor because it has similar electronic properties to PC61BM, but a considerably higher absorption coefficient in the visible region. As the ratio of polymer:PC71BM is an important parameter, the weight ratio between the polymer and PC71BM was optimized to 1:2. Table 3 lists the photovoltaic properties of the devices.

The devices were measured under the simulated AM 1.5G illumination condition (100 mW cm−2) after annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage (J–V curves) of the PSCs. The PTOBDTTQ1 device has a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 7.49 mA cm−2 and an FF of 47%, resulting in a PCE of 2.66%. The PTOBDTTQ2 device shows an increased PCE of 4.24% with a Voc of 0.83 V, a Jsc of 9.40 mA cm−2 and an FF of 54%. The results are in close agreement with previous assumptions about the PSCs. The slightly increased Voc of PTOBDTTQ2 is consistent with its deeper HOMO level compared with that of PTOBDTTQ1. This is further proof that the 2-ethylhexyl side chain in TQ2 facilitates the performance of the device. The increased Jsc value may contribute to the significantly improved PCE of PTOBDTTQ2. With respect to the Jsc value, the difference can be inferred to be due to two reasons: first, PTOBDTTQ2 has a broader absorption spectrum than PTOBDTTQ1, as previously shown in Fig. 1; and, second, PTOBDTTQ2 may have a higher charge mobility than PTOBDTTQ1 due to the enhanced π–π stacking in the more planar structure of TQ2.

To confirm this speculation, the hole mobility was measured by the space charge limited current (SCLC) J–V curves as obtained in the dark using hole-only devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/Au). The SCLC behavior in the trap-free region can be characterized using the Mott–Gurney square law.37 The hole mobility of PTOBDTTQ2 was calculated to be 5.42 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, higher than the 2.44 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 of PTOBDTTQ1 (Fig. 4). The higher hole mobility of PTOBDTTQ2 is expected to contribute in part to the higher Jsc and FF values observed in the solar cell devices.39

To confirm the PCE, the EQE of the devices was measured under illumination with monochromatic light. As shown in Fig. 3b, the PTOBDTTQ1 device shows a photo response between 300 and 750 nm, although the photo response of the PTOBDTTQ2 device extends to around 800 nm. The device based on PTOBDTTQ2 shows higher EQE values, along with broader absorption spectra. This result again indicates that the more planar TQ2 is helpful in improving the Jsc performance of the device. Both the current density (Jsc) values, calculated by the integration of the EQE of the devices, are close to the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the morphology of the polymer and PC71BM blend films. Fig. 5 shows AFM images of PTOBDTTQ1:PC71BM (1:2 w/w) and PTOBDTTQ2:PC71BM (1:2 w/w) films after annealing at 110 °C for 10 min. Both films show a close surface roughness of 1.65 and 1.93 nm, respectively, and a similar degree of phase separation, which relates to the charge separation. A 1 × 1 μm AFM (Fig. S1†) image was also obtained that shows a similar height image and RMS value to the 5 × 5 μm AFM images.

Experimental section
Reagents and measurements
Common solvents were purchased as analytical-reagent grade and used as received. Deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. THF and toluene were dried over sodium-benzophenone under nitrogen and were freshly distilled before use. Bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II)chloride [Pd(PPh3)2Cl2], tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium [Pd2(dba)3], tri(o-tolyl)phosphine [P(o-tol)3] and tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophospate (Bu4NPF6) were from Aladdin or Sigma-Aldrich. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were measured in CDCl3 on a Bruker AVANCE 600 MHz Fourier transform NMR spectrometer; the chemical shifts were quoted relative to the internal standard tetramethylsilane. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured using a Hitachi U-4100 UV-visible-NIR scanning spectrophotometer. CV measurements were made on a CHI660D electrochemical work station. The CV was carried out in a 0.1 M anhydrous acetonitrile solution of Bu4NPF6 with a platinum wire counter electrode and saturated calomel reference electrode; the working electrode was a glassy carbon electrode coated with the two polymer films. The molecular weights of the polymers were measured by GPC using an ELEOS system with polystyrene as the standard (room temperature) and THF as the eluent. Thermogravimetric analysis measurements were made using an SDT Q600 V20.9 Build 20 instrument at a heating rate of 10°C min−1. AFM images were acquired with an Agilent-5400 scanning probe microscope with a Nano drive controller in the tapping mode with MikroMasch NSC-15 AFM tips with resonant frequencies of about 300 kHz.
Both of the PSCs were fabricated with the same conventional device structure (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTOBDTTQ1 or PTOBDTTQ2:PC71BM(1:2 w/w)/Ca/Al). ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned ultrasonically in detergent, water, acetone and isopropanol, followed by treatment in an oxygen plasma (Plasma Preen II-862 Cleaner). A thin layer (∼40 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios TM P AI 4083) was spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates and annealed in an oven at 150 °C for 20 min. The substrates were then transferred into an argon-filled glove-box. PTOBDTTQ1 or PTOBDTTQ2 and PC71BM (American Dye Source) were dissolved in o-DCB without DIO solvent. The solution was then stirred overnight at room temperature. The solution of polymer:PC71BM was then spin-coated to form the active layer (∼100 nm) on the PEDOT:PSS modified ITO-coated glass. The devices were completed after the deposition of Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) as the cathode through a shadow mask under a high vacuum (∼10−4 Pa). The thickness of the active layer was controlled by changing the spin speed during the spin-coating process and was estimated using a Veeco Dektak150 surface profiler in our laboratory. The effective area of the device was measured to be 0.1 cm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2, Newport solar simulator). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard silicon solar cell. The EQE of the solar cells was analyzed using a certified Newport incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurement system.

After removing the solvent under reduced pressure, the residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (eluent petroleum ether–CH2Cl2, 5:1 v/v) then washed in hot methanol to yield a deep purple solid (yield 80%, 0.66 g). 1H-NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 9.21 (dd, J = 7.7, 0.8 Hz, 2H), 8.37 (d, J = 7.8 Hz, 2H), 7.86 (s, 2H), 7.67 (ddd, J = 20.6, 14.0, 6.8 Hz, 4H), 7.38 (s, 2H), 2.58 (dd, J = 7.2, 2.5 Hz, 4H), 1.78–1.70 (m, 2H), 1.48–1.31 (m, 17H), 0.97 (dt, J = 14.0, 7.3 Hz, 12H). 13C-NMR (150 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 141.60, 140.32, 137.70, 137.41, 132.19, 130.32, 130.29, 130.02, 127.94, 127.75, 126.78, 125.29, 122.65, 114.62, 40.18, 33.85, 32.62, 28.92, 25.76, 23.18, 14.23, 10.96.


Synthesis of polymer PTOBDTTQ1. 
TOBDTSn (320.3 mg, 0.2 mmol), DBrTQ1 (121.3 mg, 0.2 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (1.8 mg, 0.002 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (3.6 mg, 0.012 mmol) were dissolved into 6 mL of toluene in a flask protected by argon. The mixture was then heated at 110 °C for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol. The precipitated solid was collected and purified by Soxhlet extraction and silica gel column chromatography with chloroform as the eluent. After drying overnight under vacuum, the target polymer was obtained as a dark solid, yield 80%, 276 mg. Mn = 20 kDa, PDI = 1.08. 1H-NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.65–5.84 (br, 26H), 4.51–3.25 (m, 12H), 2.00–0.18 (m, 90H).


Synthesis of polymer PTOBDTTQ2. 

PTOBDTTQ2 was synthesized by the same procedure as PTOBDTTQ1. TOBDTSn (320.3 mg, 0.2 mmol), DBrTQ2 (168.6 mg, 0.2 mmol), Pd2(dba)3 (1.8 mg, 0.002 mmol) and P(o-tol)3 (3.6 mg, 0.012 mmol) were used. Yield 75%, 292 mg. Mn = 20 kDa, PDI = 1.09. 1H-NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 9.07–5.42 (br, 22H), 4.61–3.41 (m, 16H), 2.28–0.21 (m, 120H).

Conclusions
The new polymer PTOBDTTQ2, based on TQ2 and the 2D-BDT unit, was designed, synthesized and characterized. Compared with TQ1, which has two separated phenyl rings, TQ2 has a more planar structure because the two phenyl rings are connected by a single bond; this facilitates π–π stacking and charge transport. With the help of the highly soluble TOBDT with six alkoxylated substituents, the polymer could be processed in solution. The PSCs fabricated from the blend of the polymer and PC71BM have PCEs of 2.66 and 4.24%, respectively. These results show that the quinoxaline derivative TQ2 is a promising acceptor unit and further research and improvement of this derivative are indicated.
