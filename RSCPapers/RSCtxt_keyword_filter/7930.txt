    , Accepted 8th April 2022First published on 8th April 2022AbstractGreen solvent-treated organic solar cells (OSCs) have demonstrated remarkable advantages in recent years for printing large-area photovoltaic devices. However, the high boiling point and poor solubility of green solvents lead to difficulties in morphological exploration and regulation, which are ultimately prejudiced against the upgrading of large-area OSCs. In this work, the shear impulse strategy is used to prepare high-performance scalable OSCs with green solvents. In PM6:Y6 films treated with o-XY, the shear impulse during film formation is improved by increasing the meniscus-guided coating (MGC) speed, which leads to achieving suitable phase separation. Therefore, the PCE of the device prepared by MGC is up to 15.1%, and the PCE of large-area devices (1 cm2) reaches 13.66%. Moreover, the critical conditions for the fabrication of homogeneous films are explored. To validate the universality of the shear impulse strategy, PM6:BTP-eC9 films are fabricated by the MGC method. A PCE of 17.15% is obtained for small-area (0.04 cm2) devices. Noticeably, the PCEs of large-area (1 cm2) rigid devices reached 15.50%, and a large-area module (25 cm2) exhibited an excellent PCE of 11.29%. Overall, the shear impulse strategy can effectively guide the lab-to-manufacturing translation of printing organic photovoltaic devices.

Broder context
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been widely investigated for their light weight, flexibility, and printing capability. However, harmful halogenated organic solvents are used in most OSCs, which are detrimental to human health, environmental safety and industrial-scale manufacturing. Therefore, the transition from lab-scale devices to industrial-scale modules treated with green solvents is a key hindrance for practical applications. In this work, a shear impulse strategy is employed to fine-tune the morphology of non-halogenated solvent treated active layer films, and the critical conditions for homogenizing printing OSCs are explored with universal applicability. The quantitative calculation of the shear impulse is utilized to verify the universal and scientific validity of the strategy. And the magnitude of the shear impulse is calculated to account for the evolution of the active layer film morphology. Therefore, the relationship between the magnitude of the shear impulse, morphology and photoelectric properties is established. Furthermore, the critical conditions for the preparation of large-area film homogenization are determined by the qualitative analysis of the shear impulse. Based on this strategy, the PCE of large-area (1 cm2) rigid devices reached 15.50%, and a large-area module (25 cm2) exhibited an excellent PCE of 11.29%.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread academic and commercial interest in the past decades as one of the promising means of renewable solar energy utilization owing to their light weight, flexibility, low cost, and printing capacity.1–8 With continuous in-depth research on material synthesis, interface engineering, and active layer morphology control, the efficiency of single OSCs based on non-fullerene acceptors has reached 19.05%.9 In addition, they also show great application prospects in translucent and wearable applications.9–16 However, the scalability of active layer films in OSCs prepared by the spin-coating method is poor, resulting in a huge variation in the power conversion efficiency (PCE) between large-area modules and small-area devices.17–19 In addition, harmful halogenated organic solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) and chloroform (CF) are adopted in most OSCs, which pose a threat to human health and the environment. And it also is one of the biggest obstacles to industrial scale manufacturing.20–22 Therefore, the transition from lab-scale devices to industrial-scale modules treated with green solvents is a key hindrance for practical applications.
The discrepancy in the PCE between small-area devices and large-area modules is mainly attributed to two factors. First, the existing process for the preparation of OSCs is deficient. In the preparation of small-area devices, the outward centrifugal force and the inward viscous force are the dominant forces that affect the quality of active layer films in the spin-coating process. With an opposite combination of these two forces, a uniform film can be formed by the simple spin-coating method.23–25 Unfortunately, the majority of active layer solution is thrown out during the spin-coating process, resulting in wastage of materials. Furthermore, as the area of the active layer increases, the forces at the center and edges of the substrate are markedly different, making the spin-coating process not suitable for the preparation of large-area modules.26,27 Thus, the MGC process is considered to be a better suitable method for the fabrication of large-area devices. Compared with the spin-coating process, the printing process has the advantages of a high material utilization rate and high reproducibility. The MGC process applies a single directional shear force to the solution through the gap between the substrate and blade, where a capillary force is the dominant driving force for film formation. In this way, evaporation drives the capillary flow and transports the solute to the three-phase contact line, which is named the evaporation zone. The stick–slip effect often occurs in the evaporation zone, leading to regular streaks in films, which is not favored in the preparation of large-area modules.28 The solution Couette flow resembles the coffee ring effect (CRE) when the MGC speed is relatively low. And the coffee ring effect will significantly affect the homogeneity of films. When the MGC speed increases, the solution quickly emerges from the gap between the blade and substrate on account of the viscous forces. The Couette flow of solution is comparable to a laminar flow with different shear strain distributions in a vertical direction, called the Landau–Levich state. In addition, the phase separation and the polymer aggregation behavior are intimately related to the solvent flow behavior, which is associated with the parameters in the printing process.
Moreover, the solubility of the active layer materials in green solvents is relatively limited. In previous research studies, the divergent solubility of the active layer materials in CF and o-xylene (o-XY) was investigated and addressed by molecular modifications, addition of additives and increasing the temperature during film formation.29–31 Nevertheless, there are some challenges that are not conducive to industrial production, such as the complexity of the process and the poor uniformity of large-area active layer films. In our previous work, we found that the magnitude of the shear impulse has a noticeable impact on the PCE of OSCs, making the preparation of large-area OSCs possible.32 In addition, the active layer film with good uniformity can be formed using the shear impulse strategy.33,34 Consequently, the shear impulse strategy is proved to be an effective strategy to simultaneously optimize the morphology of non-halogen solvent treated large-area active layer films and diminish the strong PCE variation of OSCs with different areas.
In this work, the translation from lab-to-manufacturing with eco-friendly solvents by increasing the shear impulse is realized. By increasing the spin-coating time and the MGC speed, the shear impulse of fluids in the printing process can be maximally increased. We systematically investigated the influence of the fluid shear impulse on the device performance and film morphology under processes of spin-coating and MGC. For the PM6:Y6 film, the highest PCE of 15.1% is achieved when the MGC speed is 55 mm s−1 due to the fine-tuned morphology of the active layer film. The aggregation of donor and acceptor molecules in non-halogenated green solvents is efficiently inhibited by the increasing shear impulse (Fig. 1a), which is beneficial for the charge transfer and exciton separation. In addition, the consequences of the shear impulse calculation show that the MGC process is obviously superior to spin-coating for the OSCs treated with high boiling point non-halogen solvents, and the critical conditions for the uniform film formation are discussed. To verify the universality of the shear impulse strategy, the OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9 are prepared. And the PCE of 17.15% is achieved when the area of the device is 0.04 cm2, while the large-area (1 cm2) rigid and flexible devices afforded PCEs of 15.50 and 13.26%, respectively. Afterwards, the large-area module (25 cm2) exhibited an excellent PCE of 11.29%.

Results and discussion
Recently, the most popular system used for exploration has been PM6:Y6. The chemical structures of poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PM6)35 and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6)36 are illustrated in Fig. 1b, respectively. And, the o-XY is used as the green solvent. The corresponding energy level diagram is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). In order to study the effect of processing solvents on the optical properties of PM6 and Y6 films, the normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of PM6 and Y6 films prepared with different solvents are recorded. As shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), the o-XY solution processed PM6 film has an absorption peak at 618 nm, which is red-shifted about 6 nm compared to that of the CF processed film (612 nm). However, the o-XY treated Y6 film has a redder absorption peak at 855 nm than that of the CF treated film (828 nm), implying that the Y6 film treated with o-XY tends to be more aggregated.
In order to explore the influence of the shear impulse on photovoltaic performance, a conventional configuration of indium-tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/perylene diimide functionalized with amino N-oxide (PDINO)/Al is employed. In the spin-coating process, the shear impulse is controlled by changing the spin-coating time. However, in the MGC process, the shear impulse is controlled by commanding the MGC speed. The thickness of the active layer is well controlled at ∼135 nm by the above two methods (details are shown in Note S1, ESI†). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra under different spin-coating and MGC conditions are shown in Fig. S3–S6 (ESI†), respectively. In addition, the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. S1, S2 (ESI†). For the spin-coating process, when the spin-coating time is 1 s, the device exhibits a PCE of 6.0% with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 14.15 mA cm−2, and an FF of 54.91%. Along with the enhancement of the shear impulse, photovoltaic parameters initially increase and later remain constant. The device fabricated by the spin-coating method achieved a PCE of 11.6%, with a Voc of 0.78 V, a Jsc of 22.81 mA cm−2, and an FF of 65.59% when the spin-coating time reached 40 s. For the MGC process, the PCE of the device is 13.0%, with a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 23.93 mA cm−2, and an FF of 70.70% at a lower MGC speed (15 mm s−1). As the shear impulse increases, the PCE of OSCs fabricated by the MGC process gradually increases and decreases subsequently. The device prepared at a MGC speed of 55 mm s−1 reached a PCE of 15.1% (a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 25.02 mA cm−2, and a FF of 74.76%). When the MGC speed is 75 mm s−1, the PCE of the device reduces to 13% (a Voc of 0.77 V, a Jsc of 23.36 mA cm−2, and a FF of 72.20%). The corresponding current densities integrated from the EQE curves are shown in Tables S1 and S2 (ESI†), which are in accordance with the Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. The PCE and FF of the devices fabricated by the MGC process are better than those of the devices fabricated by spin-coating, although the same materials are used. To investigate the advantages of the shear impulse strategy, exciton dissociation, charge transport and charge recombination behavior are tested (details are given in Note S2, ESI†). The UV-vis absorption spectrum reveals that the shear impulse strategy can effectively inhibit the aggregation of Y6. In addition, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) indicate that the charge transfer of the active layer films prepared by the MGC method is most effective, which conforms to their corresponding photovoltaic properties. Moreover, the relationship between Jsc, Voc and light intensity shows that the devices based on the MGC speed of 55 mm s−1 exhibit the slightest bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination. The results reveal that appropriate shear pulses are essential for boosting the device performance.

Furthermore, the shear impulses are calculated to evaluate the discrepancy between the spin-coating and MGC processes. For the fabrication of OSCs by spin-coating, eqn (1) of the impulse calculation is as follows 32, 37: (1)where FRCF is the size of the centrifugal force, t represents the acting time of the force and  represents the shear impulse, and the calculation of the impulse shoud take into account the variation of the centrifugal force at different positions in the substrate. Moreover, the conversion formula of the centrifugal force and the spin-coating speed can be measured by eqn (2):37 (2)where rpm is the rotational speed, R represents the radius of substrates and FRCF is the centrifugal force. According to formulae (1) and (2), the shear impulse with different spin-coating times can be calculated.
For the MGC method, the impulse applied to the active films can be calculated according to the alteration of momentum and the corresponding formula (3) is shown below:32 IMGC = ΔP = mv2–mv1(3)where ΔP is the change of momentum, ν2 represents the MGC speed, ν1 is regarded as zero and IMGC represents the impulse. To associate the impulse generated by spin-coating and the impulse derived from MGC, a transformation factor (T) is utilized and a specific transformation formula (4) is given by (4)where IMGC is the shear impulse actually calculated in the MGC process and  is the shear impulse that can be directly compared with . Excitingly, the T value was measured to be about 1.10197 × 104 in our previous work.32 And, the shear impulse mentioned below is the shear impulse (i.e.) after conversion (details are shown in Note S3, ESI†).
The shear impulse after conversion ( and ) is summarized in Table S3 (ESI†). During the spin-coating process, the films are completely dry at 40 s. And the continuously increasing shear impulse has no more effect on the active layer, which is revealed by the UV-vis spectrum (Fig. S7, ESI†). Therefore, the most effective shear impulse is achieved when the spin-coating time is 40 s (3.354 N S) in the spin-coating process. However, the maximum shear impulse of the spin-coating process can be achieved when the MGC speed is 35 mm s−1. Furthermore, the shear impulse in the MGC process can be further enhanced accompanied with the increasing MGC speed. To describe the relationship between the shear impulse and the PCE of the device more clearly, the devices fabricated by different preparation methods are described (Fig. 1c). The devices prepared by the MGC method show a better PCE than the devices fabricated by the spin-coating method, which is attributed to the more optimized morphology. Thus, the MGC process can achieve a stronger shear impulse than the spin-coating method, which can minimize the aggregation of donors and acceptors in the non-halogenated solvent-treated films.
To verify that the MGC process can suppress the aggregation of Y6 in o-XY-processed films, the phase separation and surface morphologies are characterized. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are shown in Fig. 2a–d and e–h, respectively. The CF solvent is the most commonly used treatment solvent for small-area OSCs in a laboratory, and the OSCs treated with CF usually exhibit high efficiency. The PM6:Y6 film processed with CF shows a smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.42 nm (Fig. S8, ESI†). And its bi-continuous interpenetrating networks exhibit appropriate domain sizes (Fig. S9, ESI†), which are consistent with reported studies.38 However, when the processing solvent is changed to o-XY, the morphology of PM6:Y6 films prepared by the spin-coating process alters significantly. As shown in Fig. S10–S12, (ESI†) the RMS roughness of PM6:Y6 films treated with o-XY increases to 4.67 nm, and large-size domain phase separation appears in the films. Furthermore, the RMS roughness of PM6:Y6 films prepared by MGC tends to increase gradually as the increasing shear impulse (from 1.03 nm to 1.96 nm) (Fig. S13 and S14, ESI†). More importantly, the RMS value of the blend films processed by MGC is generally smaller than that of PM6:Y6 films prepared by the spin-coating method. The gradual increase of the RMS roughness declares that the improvement of the shear impulse can promote the crystallization of PM6 domains. However, the TEM images shown in Fig. S15 (ESI†) also demonstrate that the films prepared by the MGC method have more suitable phase separation and smaller domains.
 Fig. 2  The (a–d) AFM, (e–h) TEM and (i–l) 2D GIWAXS images of the active layer films obtained during spin-coating and MGC processes. 
In addition, the orientation and molecular packing of the binary films are investigated using a grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) technique. The corresponding 2D patterns and sector-averaged profiles are shown in Fig. 2i–l and Fig. S16 and S17 (ESI†). And the structure parameters of (010) scattering peaks in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction are shown in Table S4 (ESI†). All the PM6:Y6 films exhibited distinctly stronger (010) π–π stacking peaks at q ≈ 1.74 Å−1 in the OOP direction, revealing a prominent face-on orientation in blend films. And the coherence length (CL) is fitted to evaluate the molecular order of organic photovoltaic materials by using the Scherrer equation.39,40 The CL of the (010) π–π stacking peak of the films fabricated with o-XY by the MGC process reaches a highest value when the post-conversion shear impulse is 5.434 N S, indicating the strongest crystallization performance. Therefore, the increase of the shear impulse can promote the crystallization of donors and acceptors. In summary, the shear impulse strategy can effectively improve the molecular order of PM6.
To further verify the influence of different solvents on the morphology in different printing methods, the Hansen solubility parameters of PM6 and Y6 are calculated by the group contribution method. The Hansen solubility parameters (δ) of PM6, Y6, CF and o-XY are 19.20, 19.80, 18.95 and 18.10, respectively.41 Then, the Flory-Huggins interaction parameters (χS–M) between the solvent and the molecule are further calculated. The χ values of CF-PM6, o-XY-PM6, CF-Y6 and o-XY-Y6 pairs are 0.34, 0.40, 0.36 and 0.48, respectively.41 These results show that the solubility of Y6 in o-XY is relatively inferior, demonstrating the Y6 preference for more aggregation when processed by the o-XY solution. Due to the great effect of both dynamic and thermodynamic processes on the microstructure, the different morphology characteristics of these films are formed. In the spin-coating method, the wet film dries quickly ascribed to the low boiling point of the solvent when CF is used as the processing solvent (BP ≈ 61 °C). And then a reasonable phase separation can be formed in the PM6:Y6 film without large aggregation. Unfortunately, when the processing solvent is changed to o-XY (BP ≈ 144 °C), the drying time of wet films is prolonged, leading to the excessive aggregation of donors and acceptors.7 The interaction parameters (χij) are calculated by the contact angle measurement (Fig. S18 and 19, ESI†). The value of χij is calculated by the following eqn (5):42–44 χij = (Vm/RT)·(δi–δj)2 + χS(5)where Vm is the molar volume, R is the molar gas constant, T represents the room temperature, δi and δj are the surface energies of films and o-XY, and χS is the correction factor, which is 0.34 from the literature. With the increase of shear impulse, the χij values decrease in both the spin-coating and MGC processes (Tables S5 and S6, ESI†), indicating that the shear impulse can inhibit the aggregation of donors and acceptors in the o-XY solvent. Moreover, the active layer films prepared by the MGC method have smaller χij values, which mean that the MGC method can preferably suppress the aggregation than the spin-coating method.
Based on the analysis of active layer films, the conformational changes of the polymer donor PM6 and the small non-fullerene acceptor Y6 are illustrated in Fig. 3a. Proverbially, the large shear impulse can facilitate the extension and alignment of polymer chains during film formation.33,34 In particular, the enhancement of the substrate temperature in the high boiling point solvent-treated film can simultaneously promote crystallization and shorten the aggregation time of acceptors. Thereby, these factors can availably reduce the entropy barrier to the formation of the ordered structure and thus promoting the crystallization of the polymer to form a suitable phase separation.45 Shortly, the synergistically effects of higher crystallinity, closer molecular accumulation, more appropriate domain sizes and smaller aggregation can be obtained in the PM6:Y6 blend film treated with the o-XY solvent through shear impulse printing. In addition, the effects of the shear impulse on the PM6 and Y6 pure films were also investigated (ESI† note S4). The results demonstrated that the shear impulse was favorable to inhibit PM6 aggregation and promote Y6 crystallization.

(b) Digital photographs of the films (25 cm2) formed by different methods. (c) The UV-vis absorption intensity distribution of large-area (25 cm2) films fabricated by spin-coating and MGC methods. (d) Homogenization condition of the active layer film prepared by MGC. 
Besides, homogeneity is an essential parameter for evaluating the quality of large-area films. As shown in Fig. 3b, the same volume of solution (25 μL) is used to prepare 25 cm2 photoelectric conversion layer films under optimal conditions by spin-coating and MGC methods, respectively. It can be observed that the film fabricated by the MGC method exhibits a good homogeneity, while a complete film cannot be formed by the spin-coating method. As shown in Fig. 3c, the active layer films with an area of 25 cm2 are prepared by the MGC and spin-coating methods, respectively. And the intensity of absorption peak at ∼855 nm (ascribed to Y6) is measured to illustrate the homogeneity. The uniformity of the film fabricated by the MGC process is clearly discovered to be superior to that of the film prepared by the spin-coating method. Hence, the MGC method is proved to be more suitable for the preparation of large-area active layer films treated with high-boiling green solvents. Afterwards, to reduce the adverse effects of CRE (Fig. S20, ESI†), the uniformity of the films is investigated. Fig. 3d shows the critical conditions for the fabrication of homogeneous films under different MGC speeds (shear impulse) and substrate temperatures. In addition, this investigation can utilize to preliminarily determine the appropriate shear impulse at different substrate temperatures to fabricate homogeneous films, which is beneficial for the transition from small-area to large-area devices.
The large-area devices are prepared to further verify that the shear impulse printing strategy is an effective way to realize the lab-to-manufacturing translation. The large-area (1 cm2) device treated with non-halogen solvents with a PCE of 13.66%, a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 24.52 mA cm−2, and a FF of 69.80% is fabricated (Fig. 4a), which is one of the highest value covered so far (Table S7, ESI†). And the PCE of OSCs prepared by the MGC method is also relatively concentrated (Fig. 4b). Moreover, the PCE loss rate versus the area of the devices conducted by the spin-coating and MGC processes is shown in Fig. 3c, Fig. S21 and Table S8 (ESI†). Conspicuously, the average PCE value of devices processed by the MGC method can maintain 90.47% when the effective area increases to 1 cm2, which is superior to that of devices processed by the spin-coating method (69.57%). Moreover, PM6:BTP-eC9 is used to validate the universality of the shear impulse strategy. As shown in Fig. 4d, the PCE of the environmentally friendly OSCs prepared by the MGC method reached 17.15% (with a Voc of 0.84 V, a Jsc of 22.77 mA cm−2, and a FF of 76.33%), which is higher than that of the spin-coated OSCs (12.95%). And the PCEs of OSCs prepared by the MGC method are also relatively concentrated (Fig. 4e). The rigid and flexible devices with an area of 1 cm2 have also been fabricated by the MGC method, with considerable PCEs of up to 15.50% and 13.26%, respectively (Fig. 4f). Furthermore, large-area flexible modules (25 cm2) are printed (Fig. 4g and h and Fig. S22, ESI†) to further evaluate the potential of the shear impulse strategy. The PCE of the flexible module is 11.29% (Fig. 4i), which is one of the highest values currently. Therefore, compared with the spin-coating method, the MGC method has better area tolerance and is more suitable for the preparation of large area OSCs. The shear impulse printing strategy can effectively guide the industrial scale manufacturing of efficient OSCs.

Conclusions
In summary, we propose a shear impulse strategy to optimize the film morphology to fabricate large-area active layer films of nonfullerene OSCs with good homogeneity. The MGC process can provide a larger shear impulse than the spin-coating process, which involves manufacturing more compactly packed PM6 polymer chains, more sufficient Y6 crystallization, and a more suitable phase separation scale. For the PM6:Y6 system, the most superior crystallinity and appropriate phase separation are achieved when the MGC speed is 55 mm s−1, which is conducive to the charge transport and efficient separation of excitons. Thus, the photovoltaic performance of devices can be improved, and a PCE of 15.1% is obtained. In addition, the active layer films with an area of 25 cm2 are fabricated using the shear impulse printing strategy to explore the preparation conditions of homogeneous films. Meanwhile, to validate the universality of the shear impulse strategy, OSCs based on PM6:BTP-eC9 are fabricated. The PCE of small-area (0.04 cm2) devices prepared by the MGC method is 17.15%, while the large-area (1 cm2) rigid and flexible devices achieved PCEs of 15.50% and 13.26%, respectively. More importantly, the PCE of the flexible module with an area of 25 cm2 prepared by the R2R method is 11.29%. In short, the shear impulse printing strategy is helpful in optimizing the nano-structure of non-halogen solvent-treated films, which can effectively open up a new strategy for the lab-to-manufacturing translation of organic optoelectronic devices.

Organic solar cells (OSCs) have been widely investigated for their light weight, flexibility, and printing capability. However, harmful halogenated organic solvents are used in most OSCs, which are detrimental to human health, environmental safety and industrial-scale manufacturing. Therefore, the transition from lab-scale devices to industrial-scale modules treated with green solvents is a key hindrance for practical applications. In this work, a shear impulse strategy is employed to fine-tune the morphology of non-halogenated solvent treated active layer films, and the critical conditions for homogenizing printing OSCs are explored with universal applicability. The quantitative calculation of the shear impulse is utilized to verify the universal and scientific validity of the strategy. And the magnitude of the shear impulse is calculated to account for the evolution of the active layer film morphology. Therefore, the relationship between the magnitude of the shear impulse, morphology and photoelectric properties is established. Furthermore, the critical conditions for the preparation of large-area film homogenization are determined by the qualitative analysis of the shear impulse. Based on this strategy, the PCE of large-area (1 cm2) rigid devices reached 15.50%, and a large-area module (25 cm2) exhibited an excellent PCE of 11.29%.
