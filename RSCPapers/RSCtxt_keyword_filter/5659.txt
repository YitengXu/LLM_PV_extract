    , Accepted 6th March 2013First published on 6th March 2013AbstractA new, low band-gap donor–acceptor-type conjugated polymer, PDPP-PER, comprising 3,9-perylene (PER) and diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) was synthesized. The crystallinity of the synthesized polymer film significantly improved with thermal annealing to 150 °C. The PCE of the PDPP-PER device reached 6.35% with a high open-circuit voltage of 0.79 V.
Organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) have been extensively investigated recently owing to their low mass, flexibility, and potentially inexpensive manufacturing.1 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of more than 7% have been attained based on bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs formed from a blend of electron-donating polymers and electron-accepting fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM).2 Low band-gap conjugated polymers consisting of strong electron-donating and -withdrawing building blocks have special advantages for high-performance OPVs because their absorption ranges can be extended to longer wavelengths and their electronic properties can be easily tuned by varying the donor and acceptor units.3–5
The open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), and fill factor (FF) are the primary parameters that determine the PCE of OPVs. The Voc is proportional to the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor polymer and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the fullerene derivative acceptor. The Jsc depends mainly on the photo-absorption properties and charge carrier mobility of the active layer of the OPV.6,7
Recently, diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) has emerged as a promising electron-accepting building block for low band-gap conjugated polymers, especially for organic thin-film transistor (OTFTs) and OPV applications.8–10 OPV devices fabricated using the many DPP-based low band-gap polymers have been reported and achieved substantial PCEs of ∼4–7%.11–13 For example, Dodabalapur and coworkers reported a low band-gap conjugated polymer, i.e., poly[{3,6-dithiene-2-yl-2,5-di(2-octyldecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-5′,5′′-diyl}-alt-{naphthalene}] (PDPP-TNT), that exhibited a broad absorption between 300 and 800 nm and had a narrow band-gap (∼1.50 eV). The OPV device fabricated using PDPP-TNT had a PCE of 4.7%.10 Janssen and coworkers also reported DPP-based low band-gap conjugated polymers, i.e., poly[{3,6-dithiene-2-yl-2,5-di(2-hexyldecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione[5-c]pyrrol}-alt-{(2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene)-5,5′′-diyl}] (PDPP3T) and poly[{3,6-dithiene-2-yl-2,5-di(2-hexyldecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-5′,5′′-diyl}-alt-{[2,2′-(1,4-phenylene)bisthiophene]-5,5′-diyl}] (PDPPTPT); the corresponding OPV devices showed PCEs of 4.7 and 5.5%, respectively.9,14
In addition, we recently reported a method for improving hole mobility and lowering the HOMO energy levels of conjugated polymers by incorporating flat aromatic units, such as perylene or pyrene.15,16 Herein, we report the synthesis and photovoltaic properties of a new p-type semiconducting polymer comprising 3,9-perylene (PER) and DPP with 2-octyldecyl side groups as the electron-donating and -accepting parts, respectively. We expected that the resulting polymers would have a low band-gap with a deep HOMO energy level, and that the perylene unit would improve the hole mobility and crystallinity by enhancing interchain interactions of the polymers. The synthetic route to poly[{perylene}-alt-{3,6-dithiene-2-yl-2,5-di(2-octyldecyl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione-5′,5′′-diyl]} (DPP-PER) is shown in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Synthetic route to PDPP-PER and its chemical structure. 
PDPP-PER was synthesized via Suzuki coupling of DPP and PER monomer units in anhydrous toluene with a catalytic amount of Pd2(dba)3 and P(o-tolyl)3. The synthetic details and characterization of the monomers and polymers are provided in the ESI.† The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PDPP-PER was 20000 g mol−1 with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 2.4. The degradation temperature with 5% weight loss (Td) of PDPP-PER was determined to be 411 °C via thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 1(a)). Interestingly, PDPP-PER showed a small but clear crystallization peak (Tcr) at 176.8 °C during the cooling process (Fig. 1(a) (inset)).

Absorption spectra of PDPP-PER in the solid state and in chloroform solution are shown in Fig. 1(b). In dilute chloroform, PDPP-PER exhibits a broad and strong absorption across the entire UV-visible region, with two major absorption bands at 460 and 611 nm. In the film, the absorption band broadens and is slightly red-shifted, with peak positions at 466 and 634 nm. The absorption edge of the PDPP-PER film reached 850 nm. The optical band gap (Eoptg) measured from the absorption onset of the polymer film was 1.45 eV.
The HOMO energy level of PDPP-PER was determined by measuring the oxidation onset using cyclic voltammetry (CV) (ESI†), and the LUMO energy level was determined from the measured HOMO energy level and the optical band-gap energy obtained from the absorption edge. Accordingly, the measured HOMO and LUMO levels of PDPP-PER were −5.44 and −3.99 eV, respectively. The measured HOMO energy level of PDPP-PER is relatively deep compared with those of other DPP-based polymers; this suggests that it could have a high Voc and good oxidative stability.
Two-dimensional grazing incidence X-ray scattering (2D-GIXS) was performed to investigate the crystallinity of the polymer film (Fig. 2). To investigate the effect of annealing temperature on polymer crystallization, PDPP-PER thin films were annealed at 100 and 150 °C for 1 h. Fig. 2(a) shows 2D-GIXS images of the drop-cast PDPP-PER thin films. The GIXS pattern of the pristine PDPP-PER film shows an intense diffraction peak at qz = 0.28 Å−1, which corresponds to the (100) reflection of the polymer crystal with an interlayer domain spacing (d1) of 2.24 nm, as shown in Fig. 2(b) and the ESI.† After annealing the PDPP-PER thin film at 100 °C, the intensity of the (100) reflection increased significantly and a new (200) reflection peak became distinct owing to the enhanced edge-on orientation. Furthermore, when the annealing temperature was increased to 150 °C, a (300) reflection peak also became discernible. Interestingly, the PDPP-PER film showed a broad peak at qxy = 1.37 Å−1, which corresponds to a (010) reflection with a d(010) of 0.46 nm owing to π–π stacking between polymer chains (Fig. 2(c)). The observation of the (010) peak in the in-plane direction of 2D-GIXS scattering indicates edge-on orientation of the polymer crystal to the substrate (ESI†). Since 2D-GIXS reveals that the edge-on packing of PDPP-PER along the (100) axis normal to the film surface is predominant, this molecular orientation facilitates charge carrier transport parallel to the dielectric layer in the OTFT.

The field-effect carrier mobility of the polymer was measured by fabricating thin-film transistors (TFTs) with a bottom-contacted geometry using an Au electrode; the fabrication process is described in detail in the ESI.† The OTFTs fabricated using PDPP-PER as the active layer showed a hole mobility of 2.0 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 with Ion/Ioff ∼ 103. The hole mobility of PDPP-PER is within the desired range for OPV materials (i.e., comparable to or exceeding 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and thereby enables efficient charge extraction and a good FF.
BHJ OPVs were fabricated using PDPP-PER as the electron donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C70-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) as the electron acceptor with a general device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (Clevios™ P VP AI4083)/PDPP-PER:PC71BM/Ca/Al and an active cell area of 9 mm2. The OPV performance is affected by the processing parameters, such as the blend ratio of PDPP-PER to PC71BM and the use of additives. The OPV performances under a variety of conditions are described in the ESI.† The best device performance was obtained using 10 mg mL−1 of polymer in chlorobenzene containing 3 vol% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) for spin-coating with a polymer to PC71BM ratio of 1:1 (w/w). The J–V curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 3(a), and the output characteristics of the fabricated OPV devices are summarized in Table 1. One of the best devices exhibited a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 12.64 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.64, resulting in a PCE of 6.35%. Notably, the Voc values of the fabricated devices are quite high compared with those of other reported DPP-based polymers.9,10,14 The high Voc of the device fabricated using PDPP-PER is in good agreement with its low HOMO energy level (−5.44 eV), while the high Jsc is consistent with the broad absorption spectrum and high hole mobility of PDPP-PER. Fig. 3(b) shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of OPVs fabricated using the optimized conditions. The Jsc values were calculated by integrating the EQE data with the AM 1.5 G reference spectrum to evaluate the accuracy of the measurements: the Jsc values obtained via integration and the J–V measurements are quite similar. The spectral responses of the OPV devices showed that photons within the range of 350–800 nm contributed significantly to the EQE, with a maximum EQE of 67% (at 400 nm) for PDPP-PER.

The film morphologies of polymer/PC71BM active layers made using blend films with and without the DIO additive were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as shown in Fig. 4 and the ESI.† The dark regions in the TEM images shown in Fig. 4(a) confirm the large PC71BM domain sizes, which are far larger than typical exciton diffusion lengths (∼10 nm). Consequently, poor exciton dissociation and low current density are expected. In contrast, the PDPP-PER/PC71BM films processed with DIO feature significantly more homogeneous morphologies. Here, nanoscale phase separation and bicontinuous interpenetrating networks (Fig. 4) cause more efficient charge separation and transport, which results in a more than doubled Jsc. It is evident that the DIO additive promotes the demixing of the polymer and PCBM and induces the formation of fibril structures, leading to the final morphology shown in Fig. 4(b).17

In conclusion, we synthesized PDPP-PER from two easily accessible monomers. PDPP-PER showed high hole mobility and a wide absorption spectrum that overlaps well with the solar spectrum. These characteristics lead to photovoltaic cells with a high PCE of 6.35% when PC71BM is used as the electron acceptor. PDPP-PER is a versatile donor–acceptor-based semiconducting polymer that exhibits excellent performance in both OTFT and OPV devices. This polymer is a potential candidate for further exploration in various organic electronic devices.
