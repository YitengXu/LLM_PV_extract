    , Accepted 14th May 2019First published on 15th May 2019AbstractNucleation and crystal growth are key stages for high-quality perovskite films that dominate the performance of perovskite solar cells. However, the position of nuclei in the films and the orientation of the crystal growth have not yet been intendedly controlled during their fabrication. In this study, we developed a method of spin-coating perovskite films on frozen substrates to control the position of the nuclei and the direction of the crystal growth at the same time. In this way, the position of the crystal nuclei and the growth orientation of the perovskite crystals in the perovskite films can be simultaneously controlled. A high-quality perovskite film with grains spanning vertically the entire film thickness has been obtained using this new method. And an efficient inverted planar solar cell (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag) with the highest power conversion efficiency of 17.14% and open-circuit voltage of 1.14 V has been achieved by using this technique.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials are ideal candidates for solar cells because of their promising features such as direct and tunable band gap, strong optical absorption and long carrier diffusion length.1–3 High-quality perovskite films with high surface coverage, low surface roughness and high-quality crystalline grains are required for efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs).4 The rapid nucleation5,6 and crystal growth7,8 processes are essential for obtaining full coverage and pin-hole free perovskite films. Various strategies, such as anti-solvent quenching,5,6 vacuum-assisted,9,10 hot-casting technique11 and solvent annealing, have been developed to optimize the nucleation process and control the crystal growth process in order to enhance the quality of perovskite films.8
For these techniques, the processing temperature and the evaporation rate of solvents play an important role during the nucleation and growth processes.12 In the hot-casting technique, the substrate is maintained above the crystallization temperature and the excess solvent yields large crystalline grains during the prolonged growth of the perovskite crystals.11 Ren et al. increased the number of nuclei to create highly dense perovskite thin layers with cold anti-solvent.13 By enhancing the perovskite grain growth with a slow evaporation process of solvent, Liu et al. obtained a single-crystal-like perovskite film.14 Zhu et al. obtained high-quality perovskite films with high PCE for PSCs15 by improving the growth processes of CH3NH3PbI3 grains using a facile face-down annealing strategy. Among these studies, high-quality perovskite films have been obtained by increasing the number of nuclei or controlling the crystal growth process using various techniques. However, the position of nuclei in the films and the orientation of the crystal growth have not yet been intendedly controlled.16
In this study, we introduced the nuclei position-control and growth-guidance (NPCG) method to produce high-quality perovskite films with controlled nuclei position and crystal growth orientation. The perovskite film was spin-coated on a cold substrate to form a plurality of crystal nuclei on the surface of the substrate. During the thermal annealing process, the formed nuclei will preferentially direct the subsequent grain growth from the substrate side. At the same time, the residual solvent in the films due to the frozen substrate can help in the recrystallization of perovskite grains and promote the crystal growth to obtain high-quality perovskite films. Using the NPCG method, the highest performance of planar p–i–n PSCs (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag) with a PCE of 17.14% and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.14 V has been achieved under 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) simulated light.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
The materials for the perovskite precursor and transportation layer, including CH3NH3I, PbCl2 (>99.99%), PbI2 (>99.99%), PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus-Clevios PVP Al 4083), PC61BM (>99%) and BCP (>99%), were purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. (China). A solution of 0.14 M PbCl2, 1.26 M PbI2 and 1.4 M CH3NH3I in a co-solvent (vol. ratio = 15:85) of DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) and DMF (Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in a glove box and stirred overnight at room temperature.17,18 A solution of 20 mg mL−1 PC61BM in chlorobenzene and 0.5 mg mL−1 BCP in ethyl alcohol was stirred overnight at room temperature. PEDOT:PSS was mixed with deionized water (vol. ratio = 1:4) and stirred for about 2 hours at room temperature.
2.2. Device fabrication
PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto clean ITO at 6000 rpm for 40 s and then heated in air on a hotplate at 120 °C for 30 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the substrate was transferred to the glove box and placed on a home-made cooling plate (10, 0, −10 °C), as shown in Fig. S1†. After being placed on the cooling plate for about 10 minutes, the substrate was transferred to a spin coater within two seconds and then the perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated on the cold substrate at 400 rpm for 3 seconds and finally spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s. When the perovskite precursor was unrolled for 16 s, anti-solvent of CB (200 μL) was added dropwise onto the film. The film was first heated at 50 °C for 2 min and then heated at 85 °C for 30 min. PC61BM was spin-coated on the perovskite film at 5000 rpm for 30 s and then exposed to ambient air (temperature ≈ 25 °C, humidity ≈ 25%) to oxidizing PC61BM for 30 min.19 Then BCP was spin-coated on the PC61BM film at 2000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 100 nm Ag was deposited under high vacuum (∼5 × 10−5 Pa) through a shadow mask, resulting in an active area of 0.06 cm2. For control devices, the only difference was that the substrate temperature was maintained at room temperature (∼25 °C).
2.3. Characterization
The crystal structure of perovskite films was investigated by an X-ray diffraction system (Shimadzu XRD-7000). The morphology of the films was studied using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JSM-6700F) and atomic force microscopy (AFM CSPM 5500). The absorbance of perovskite films was measured using a Shimadzu UV-2550 spectrometer. The J–V characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under AM 1.5G illumination (Newport simulator model 94043A). During the measurement, the scan direction is reverse (from 1.2 to −0.2 V) or forward (from −0.2 to 1.2 V) with a voltage step of 10 mV and 0 ms delay time. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of devices is measured using a lock-in amplifier (SR-830). The J–V and EQE characteristics were measured in the nitrogen-filled glove box with less than 10 ppm of H2O and O2.
3. Results and discussion
The schematic diagram of the NPCG method is illustrated in Fig. 1a. PEDOT:PSS-covered substrates were placed onto a cold plate (Fig. S1†) at different temperatures (10, 0, −10 °C, labelled as NPCG@10, NPCG@0, NPCG@−10, respectively) and left for about 10 minutes. Due to the very close distance between the spin coater and the home-made cooling system in the same glove box, the substrate transfer can be completed in two seconds. Then, the perovskite precursor was spin-coated on the cold substrate quickly using the anti-solvent method. After heating at 50 °C for 2 min and then at 85 °C for 30 min, high-quality perovskite films were obtained. The controlled film was fabricated in the same manner but on the substrate at room temperature (RT).

Fig. 1b–i compares the SEM images of perovskite films fabricated from NPCG and RT methods. The top-view SEM images in Fig. 1b–e show that high-quality perovskite films without pin-holes are obtained at different fabrication temperatures. As shown in Fig. 1f–i, the cross-sectional SEM images show the remarkable difference in grain orientation among these films. In detail, for the RT films (Fig. 1f), the grain orientation is completely random and two or more stacked grains can be identified across the film thickness. However, for the perovskite films obtained by using the NPCG method (Fig. 1g–i), most of the crystals are grown perpendicular to the substrate and there is almost no interruption for these crystals across the entire film thickness. These results indicate that the growth progress of perovskite crystals on frozen and RT substrates is different.
To study the crystal growth process using NPCG and RT methods, we observed the perovskite films in situ after spin-coating. The ESI video† and Fig. 2a show the transformation of perovskite films heated at 50 °C after spin-coating. The t in the figure indicates the time when the spin-coating is completed. From Fig. 2a and the ESI video†, we can see that the colour of the NPCG films are light brown after spin-coating but the RT films are colourless. This indicates that more perovskite nuclei have already been formed in the NPCG films during spin-coating.20 After thermal annealing at 50 °C for 100 seconds, both the NPCG and RT films turn brown, indicating that the perovskite nuclei and crystals grow during the heating process. Notably, the NPCG films take a shorter time for their colour change compared with the RT films. And the NPCG films change the colour of the entire film at the same time, while the RT films start to turn brown from the front surface. As shown in Fig. 2b, this phenomenon illustrates that the position and density of nuclei are different in NPCG and RT films. Due to the more uniformly distributed nuclei in NPCG films compared with RT films, perovskite films with uniform grains could be obtained finally (Fig. S2†). The nucleation and crystal growth processes of perovskite films using RT and NPCG methods are discussed in detail below.

Fig. 2c schematically shows the cross-section of the nucleation and grain growth processes. For the RT films, during the spin-coating process, few nuclei are produced after the dropwise addition of the precursor. After spin-coating and then adding anti-solvent, some nuclei are produced on top of the films due to the reduced solubility of the perovskite by anti-solvent and the fast solvent evaporation on the surface. Then the nuclei at the top air side grow and new nuclei form in the films at the substrate side during thermal annealing. The perovskite crystals will grow randomly on these two parts of nuclei, leading to lots of grain boundaries across the films, as shown in Fig. 2c. Finally, perovskite films composed of inhomogeneous grains with random orientations would be formed. However, when the precursor is added dropwise on the cold substrate for NPCG films, some nuclei will be formed at the substrate side uniformly due to the decreased solubility of the perovskite in the precursor at low temperature. At the same time, the solvent evaporation rate is slower than that in the room temperature process due to the low temperature, so more DMSO solvent remains in the film on the substrate. Upon the addition of anti-solvent, some nuclei could be obtained on the top surface of the film and the number of nuclei on the substrate surface will increase at the same time, as shown in Fig. 2c, step 2. During thermal annealing, the crystal growth will preferentially start at these nuclei on the substrate side because they are larger and their number is higher compared with those on the top surface of the film. Significantly, these uniformly distributed nuclei at the substrate side will guide the crystal growth with the help of the residual solvent in the film. By dissolving the grain boundaries during thermal annealing, large crystals are finally formed, connecting the bottom substrate to the top surface of the film.21 In the end, a high-quality perovskite film with uniformly distributed crystals and less defects is formed. And most of the grains completely span vertically the entire film thickness and orient perpendicular to the substrate. These oriented crystals with less cracked grain boundaries would facilitate carrier transport and improve the efficiency of PSCs.7,20
The direct evidence for the distribution of nuclei in the films after spin-coating was obtained by AFM before conducting thermal annealing, as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The morphology of RT films, as shown in Fig. 3a, is disordered and it is difficult to determine the characteristics of nuclei or grains. However, lots of grains distribute uniformly in the NPCG films (Fig. 3b). Fig. 3c and d show more detailed information of nuclei in the films after keeping under vacuum at room temperature for 2 hours. There are many large grains surrounded by small ones in the NPCG films after vacuum treatment (Fig. 3d). Although the RT films (Fig. 3c) after vacuum treatment are covered with nuclei, few large grains could be found compared with the NPCG films. As is known, the perovskite nuclei would be formed rapidly with vacuum assistance.9,10 For the NPCG films, some nuclei have been formed during spin-coating. Thus, these nuclei will grow with newly formed nuclei during vacuum treatment. Finally, films with large grains surrounded by small ones are obtained. However, most of nuclei are formed during vacuum treatment for RT films. Then films with only small nuclei are obtained. To study the position of nuclei in the films, as shown in Fig. 2c, step 2, we measured the cross-section of the films after spin-coating and vacuum storage for 2 hours (Fig. 3e and f). As shown in Fig. 2c, some nuclei are produced on top of the films after spin-coating for RT films. And these nuclei will grow with some newly formed nuclei during vacuum treatment, leading to the formation of large crystals on the top air side and small grains on the substrate side, as shown in Fig. 3e. However, there are two-ply crystals in NPCG films (Fig. 3f), according to the nuclei formation process, as shown in Fig. 2c (the nuclei would produce on the substrate side and top air side at the same time during spin-coating). In brief, the NPCG method can change the process of nuclei formation and growth.

The XRD patterns of the perovskite films fabricated at different substrate temperatures are shown in Fig. 4a. All of the films display the main diffraction peaks for CH3NH3PbI3 at 14.14°, 28.48° and 31.92° which correspond to (110), (220) and (310) planes, respectively. From the normalized peak intensity, we found that the ratio of (110) to (310) plane for NPCG films is much higher than that of RT films (6.62 of NPCG@−10, 6.99 of NPCG@0, 7.46 of NPCG@10 and 5.15 of RT). This indicates that the formation of the crystallographic (110) texture is more preferential for CH3NH3PbI3 films using the NPCG method,12,15 which is beneficial for improving the efficiency of PSCs.22
 Fig. 4  The XRD measurements of perovskite films (a), J–V curves of PSCs at different substrate temperatures (b), absorbance of perovskite films (c) and EQE of devices (d) for RT and NPCG methods. 

Fig. 4b shows the J–V curves of PSCs fabricated at different substrate temperatures and their performances are listed in Table S1.† The Voc of the PSCs at RT is 1.07 V. The Voc increases as the substrate temperature decreases and the champion Voc is 1.13 V for NPCG@0 and NPCG@−10. However, the short-circuit current (Jsc) increases first and then decreases when the substrate temperature is reduced. The PCE variation follows the change of Jsc. As the substrate temperature drops from 25 °C to −10 °C, the PCE increases first and then decreases and the optimum PCE is reached at 0 °C. When the substrate temperature is lower than −10 °C (NPCG@−10), the temperature of the substrate is inhomogeneous during the spin-coating process, resulting in inhomogeneity of the prepared perovskite films, which can be observed by the naked eye (Fig. S3†). Therefore, both FF and PCE decrease when the device is fabricated at −10 °C. Another reason for the decreased PCE at −10 °C is that the absorbance of the films decreases with the substrate temperature, as shown in Fig. 4c. The decrease in the absorbance of perovskite films is due to the reduction in thickness (∼480 nm for RT films and 460–470 nm for NPCG films). Interestingly, even though the absorbance of NPCG films is lower than that of RT films, the NPCG cells exhibit higher EQE (Fig. 4d) in the ultraviolet range (between 300 and 450 nm) and infrared region (between 650 and 750 nm) compared with the RT devices, further verifying their excellent photoelectric conversion capability. This can be attributed to the improved charge transportation which is discussed in detail below.
The schematics of the charge transportation in perovskite films for RT and NPCG devices is shown in Fig. 5a, which attempts to explain the relationship between the film quality and the charge transportation process inside the perovskite. Due to the cracked grain boundaries in RT perovskite films, the vertical charge transportation across the whole film will be obstructed, leading to increasing charge recombination. However, the charge can transport directly throughout the entire perovskite film without crossing the grain boundaries in NPCG devices.20 The charge transport characterization of RT and NPCG devices was measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) at an applied voltage of 0.85 V under AM 1.5G illumination. Fig. 5b presents the characteristic Nyquist patterns and the corresponding fitted data for RT and NPCG devices, according to the equivalent electrical circuit. As shown in Fig. 5b, the Nyquist plots exhibit typical two semicircles for p–i–n PSCs.23R is the contact resistance which is attributed to the perovskite film and collection electrodes. Rs is the transportation resistance and Rrec indicates the recombination resistance in PSCs, corresponding to the semicircles of high and low frequencies in Fig. 5b, respectively.24–26 All fitted data are listed in Table 1. The NPCG and RT devices exhibit a similar R around 25 Ω, which indicates the good contact between the perovskite and hole or electron layers. On decreasing the substrate temperature during spin-coating perovskite films, Rs is reduced accordingly, indicating a better charge transportation in NPCG devices. And the increased Rrec in NPCG devices fabricated above 0 °C indicates less recombination in them. However, Rrec decreases rapidly when the temperature decreases below −10 °C (NPCG@−10), even less than that of RT devices. This decreased Rrec could be used to explain the FF (Table S1†) reduction in the NPCG@−10 device. And the higher Jsc and EQE of NPCG devices compared with RT devices thus are explained as a result of less recombination and more efficient charge transportation in better quality perovskite films. Fig. 5c shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) of NPCG and RT films on ITO/PEDOT:PSS. As the temperature decreases, the PL intensity of the NPCG films is rather lower than that of the RT films, indicating that the PL quenching efficiency of the NPCG perovskite on ITO/PEDOT:PSS is more effective.27 This indicates that the hole transport and extraction to the ITO electrode are more effective for NPCG films, as shown in Fig. 5a.28

The photovoltaic performance with the best efficiencies of RT and NPCG@0 PSCs are shown in Fig. 6a and listed in Table 2. Due to the enhanced charge transportation and reduced recombination, the photovoltaic performance of the perovskite solar cells from NPCG@0 was dramatically increased to 17.14% with a high Voc of 1.14 V. As shown in Fig. 6b, the NPCG@0 cell exhibits higher EQE compared with the RT device. In addition, the hysteresis effect of the J–V curves is negligible (Fig. 6a and Table 2). As shown in Fig. 6c, the statistic PCE of 40 solar cells illustrates the outstanding reproducibility of the NPCG method. The dark J–V curves were measured to understand the mechanism of Voc improvement (Fig. 6d).29,30 As shown in Fig. 6d, the leakage current density of the NPCG@0 device is about two orders of magnitude lower than that of the RT device. The Voc of PSCs can be described by using the following equation:31  where k represents the Boltzmann constant, T represents the temperature, q is the elemental charge, JSC is the short-circuit current density and J0 is the dark leakage current density. It is obvious that the reduced leakage current density is because of the reduced recombination, which can be attributed to less trap states and less grain boundaries. And it is the reason for the higher open-circuit voltage of our NPCG devices.

4. Conclusion
In summary, we have developed the nuclei position-control and crystal growth-guidance (NPCG) method for preparing high-quality perovskite films by spin-coating the perovskite precursor on the frozen substrates. This newly developed technique can successfully control both the position of nuclei and the orientation of the crystal growth. Furthermore, high-quality perovskite films (large condensed crystals with less traps) fabricated using this NPCG method have crystals spanning the entire film thickness. By using this method, high Voc of 1.14 V can be obtained for planar perovskite devices (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/BCP/Ag) using CH3NH3PbI3 as the active material. Using the NPCG@0 method, the optimal inverted planar PSCs exhibited a PCE of 17.14% at AM 1.5G solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2. This new NPCG method can also be used to develop other high-performance PSCs.
