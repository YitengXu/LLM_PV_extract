    , Accepted 27th March 2017First published on 28th March 2017AbstractA multi-block copolymer based on main-chain fullerene repeating units is used in organic photovoltaic devices for the first time. A poly(fullerene) (PFDP) is linked at the chain-ends to poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) to give poly[poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly{([1,4]-fullerene)-alt-[1,4-dimethylene-2,5-bis(cyclohexylmethyl ether)phenylene]}] (P3HT-b-PFDP). While normal devices give poor results, inverted architectures result in near 50-fold improvements in performances to a block copolymer efficiency of 2.8% for this novel system. PFDP-b-P3HT is also employed as an additive to P3HT:PCBM bulk heterojunction devices and demonstrates increases from 3.6% to 4.2%, and remarkably gives a stable flat-line efficiency over the time studied.
Introduction
The development of polymers for organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) is undergoing explosive growth against a background of unprecedented environmental, economic, and technological factors.1,2 New materials and routes to augmenting OPV stabilities and efficiencies are being sought. The greatest understanding of bulk-heterojunction OPV operation has come through the use of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) blended with [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) in the photo-active layer.3 This and other composite-based systems have demonstrated the importance of phase behavior,4 nano-scale morphologies,5,6 molar mass distributions,7–9 opto-electronic properties,10,11 impurities,12 interfacial effects,13 and processing14 to name but some parameters. It is evident that the control over the morphology of the active-layer is a pivotal parameter in determining OPV stability and efficiency.
Block copolymers undergo facile self-organization into nano-domains of scales that are serendipitously optimal for the transformation of light-induced excitonic states into separate charges; their dimensions are of the same order, that is around 10 nm.15–18 They also display morphologies that are ideal for the transfer of charges that can be controlled by varying macromolecular designs, solution treatments and substrate surface energies.19–21 The increased photovoltaic activity delivered by block copolymers over blends of donor and acceptor polymers has been demonstrated to be due to this organized, nano-scale domain formation.22 There are challenges though. Block copolymers combining donor and acceptor segments are generally complex to prepare. They also suffer from their own flexibility: the high number of synthetic variables that are available increases the number of structural parameters that need to be controlled. The (opto-)electronic qualities of each block and the linking unit23 are dependent on molar mass,24 copolymer phase-separation behavior,25,26 and processing conditions.27,28 There is also great variety to be found in the type of block copolymer used, be it rigid as is typical for conjugated blocks, or coiled, as is often the case for commodity polymers carrying pendent moieties. The morphology is dependent on competing, thermodynamic driving forces, and as such, segregation strengths and the volume fractions of each block play important roles in determining the organization of domains, which can range from lamellae, through gyroid structures and hexagonally packed cylinders to isolated spheres.29 Due to the strong tendency of conjugated rods to crystallize, rod-coil block copolymers tend to favor lamellae morphologies.15d However, constraints between covalently bound domains often lead to unfavorable packing.30 This is further complicated when using blocks carrying pendent fullerene moieties, as is commonly the case, as the latter drives aggregation.31,32 It is widely supposed that the self-assembly of domains is facilitated when using polymers with low dispersities (Đ),33 however, to the authors' knowledge, it is apparent that Đ is not such a critical factor when using conjugated polymers, where crystallization is a strong driver of self-assembly.34,35 Of relevance here is excellent prior work that combined rigid electron donor (p-type) P3HT blocks with polystyrene or polyacrylate carrying acceptor groups,24,31,36,37 where it was found possible to attain C60 loadings of around 50% wt or so in the acceptor block. However, a concern of ours was that many of these materials required multiple synthetic steps, which might limit their industrial use.
It should be said that efficiencies for purely block copolymer-based systems have for the most part remained relative low, considerably less than those found for bulk-heterojunctions. This is most likely due to the high number of aforementioned parameters to control. While many have reached from between 0.4 to 1.7%,15,37 work has shown that higher efficiencies are feasible, notably 2.5% in 2012,38 averaging 2.7% in 2013 for a P3HT-based block copolymer,39 very recently 4.03% when used as additives in P3HT:PCBM systems,40 and a 2% increase to 5.1% when used as additives with low band gap poly[(thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene)-co-benzodithiophene] (PTB7) and PCBM.41 These results encouraged us to look for new systems for OPV devices.
This work reports the photovoltaic characterisation of a facilely prepared and novel block copolymer that incorporates C60 into the main-chain, rather than as a pendent moiety, thereby simplifying syntheses and ensuring high C60 loadings (ca. 62% wt). While polymers made from fullerene are well known, here we employed a relatively recently discovered polycondensation reaction, the atom transfer radical additional polymerization (ATRAP) of fullerene to prepare the C60-carrying segment.42–45 The coupling of this block with chain-end modified P3HT was smoothly accomplished in high yields; the syntheses were discussed in detail in prior work44 and so only the most salient points are raised here. We chose to use multi-block rod-coil copolymers [(AB)n], rather than the more common AB and ABA copolymers, for reasons of synthesis and properties: they are facile to obtain through polycondensation reactions; and give rise to materials with the greatest interfacial networking leading to the highest recovery and mechanical properties.46 While multi-block copolymers might be expected to be the least susceptible to processing conditions due to their highly repeated thermodynamic demand for inter-domain regularity,44 there are only a handful of known examples that contain conjugated segments.21,44,47,48 This is all the more surprising when their di- and tri-block copolymer cousins exhibit high susceptibilities to processing conditions and film thicknesses.28,49,50
Results and discussion
Block copolymer preparation
The multi-block copolymer poly[poly(3-hexylthiophene)-block-poly{([1,4]-fullerene)-alt-[1,4-dimethylene-2,5-bis(cyclohexylmethyl ether)phenylene]}] (P3HT-b-PFDP) was prepared in the same general manner as detailed elsewhere i.e., using a Williamson condensation of pre-prepared α,ω-dibromomethylene-poly{([1,4]-fullerene)-alt-[1,4-dimethylene-2,5-bis(cyclohexylmethylether)phenylene]} (α,ω-dibromomethyl-PFDP) and α,ω-dihydroxyphenyl-P3HT, as shown in Scheme 1.44 P3HT-b-PFDP was assumed to be a rod-coil structure where P3HT is the rod, and accordingly, the width of the rod-domain was considered directly proportional to the P3HT molar mass. The width of the coiled PFDP domain is discussed vide infra. The widths sought for each domain were near-equivalent to ensure lamellae formation. The molar mass of the P3HT segment was relatively high (DPn = 36) to facilitate regular domain formation44 and avoid electron confinement caused by short-chains.51 α,ω-Dihydroxyphenyl-P3HT was prepared with a near-predetermined molar mass distribution by chain polymerization techniques52 and end-capped via a simple termination reaction with commercial Grignard reagents, as detailed in prior work.44 Given that the P3HT molar masses were indicated by GPC against polystyrene standards (see Fig. 1), which over-estimate the real mass by a coefficient of around 2, literature data was used to estimate DPn (see Table 1).53 The corresponding expected P3HT domain width was 14 nm.

Conversely, the GPC severally underestimates the molecular weight of PFDP; for example, C60 is known to elute after styrene molecules from the column.54 In effect polystyrene standards cannot be reliably used to indicate molecular weights. Therefore, in accordance with the work by Gügel et al.55 we used an unwashed sample of PFDP, assumed that each incremental peak was due to an increase in molecular weight by one repeating unit, and then used this curve to determine that the washed α,ω-dibromomethyl-PFDP had a molar mass distribution centered around 9 repeating units. Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the ‘calibration curve’ used. The technique is further detailed in ref. 42. It should be noted that while tetra-additions around the C60 sphere cannot be completely avoided, they are reduced in the polymerization by using a carefully controlled ratio of reagents, i.e., maintaining a low concentration of radicals with respect to C60,55 and by using sterically cumbersome comonomers, in this case 1,4-bis(methylcyclohexyl ether) dimethylene benzene groups.42,44 For further details the reader is pointed to ref. 42 and 44 for in-depth 13C and UV-visible characterisations of PFDP. Suffice here that the UV-visible spectra (Fig. S2, ESI†) by way of the broad band absorption at 445 nm diagnostically indicating exclusively 1,4-additions to the fullerene sphere,56 and the 1H NMR spectra (see Fig. S3, ESI†) by way of peaks at 3.7 and 4.0 ppm confirming the presence of diastereotopic methylene groups in 1,4-additions provide confirmation that the sought for structure has been attained. The PFDP coil-block is thus assumed to give rise to a domain-width that is equal to l0.63 where l is the length of the polymer and 0.63 is an empirical value.57 However, the resulting expected domain width was quite low but considered acceptable for a first-attempt; assuming 1 nm per repeating unit,58 it was equal to 90.63 = 4 nm. The domain-repeating structure was thus expected to show 14 + 4 = 18 nm repeating width.
In addition to simplifying synthetic techniques, high yields of P3HT-b-PFDP were sought. Surprisingly, this was done by using relatively short reaction times (i.e., 3 h). While this meant that not all chain-ends had reacted, as indicated by GPC (see Fig. 1), it did limit the formation of insoluble aggregates most likely caused by alkoxy anionic nucleophilic attacks at the C60.44 It should be noted that the PFDP exhibits a highly multi-modal curve due to its low molar mass and formation by a polycondensation reaction.42 The P3HT-b-PFDP also exhibited a multi-modal curve, most likely due to the formation of dimers and trimers, but also quaternary and higher copolymer structures as indicated by the presence of slight shoulders (at ca. 1030 and 1050 s) to the high molecular weight curve. While inexact due to variations arising from changes in concentration and environments, given the molar extinction coefficient (ε) of P3HT-b-PFDP (ca. 220000 L mol−1 cm−1)44 and that of PFDP (εPFDP = 376000 L mol−1 cm−1 – see Fig. S2†), deconvolution of the P3HT-b-PFDP GPC chromatogram indicated that unreacted PFDP made up around 30% of the final product. The 1H NMR spectrum of P3HT-b-PFDP (see Fig. S3†) was found in conformity with in-depth prior studies using this technique.44 It should be noted that long relaxation times were required i.e., long delays between pulses (D1) in order to form peaks from PFDP segments; this is due to the known poor relaxation of protons on PFDP resulting from its aggregation in solution. This, combined with the overlap of peaks due to chain-ends meant that molecular weights were not determined using this method as they would have been unreliable.
Fractionation was not performed, again with the aim of simplifying the procedure, although it should also be noted that unreacted C60 probably remained in the mixture.37d
Concerns remained, however, that traces of metals might remain in the products. CuBr was used during the preparation of α,ω-dibromomethyl-PFDP, Ni(dppe)Cl2 in the GRIM polymerization, and K2CO3 during the Williamson condensation, and prior studies have shown that the presence of metals salts or metal residues, even in minute quantities, can accelerate photo–oxidation reactions and diminish photovoltaic effects.12 Therefore the products were subject to extensive Soxhlet washing, a method shown to be effective in removing most metals.59
OPV characterizations
A strategy based on varying device architectures was employed to maximize efficiencies. Initially, we placed the P3HT-b-PFDP in the ‘standard’ “direct” structure indicated in Fig. 2a, namely ITO/PEDOT-PSS(40 nm)/P3HT-b-PFDP(100 nm)/Al (100 nm). As Table 2 details, the photovoltaic characteristics were poor with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of only 0.06%. This was mainly due to the low short circuit current density (Jsc = 0.5 mA cm−2), indicating poor charge absorption or transport and/or a high degree of charge carrier recombination. The very high series resistance (Rseries) of this device is directly related to intrinsic resistances, including those at the contacts, and can indicate the presence of hole/electron collection barriers and interfacial dipoles which diminish the electron/hole injection efficiency (ϕinj) in the Al conduction band and ITO valence band. Possible reasons for this poor result include the presence of PFDP at the electron-barrier layer (PEDOT-PSS), which could be expected given the presence of a polar ether group in the PFDP, and the movement of P3HT to the cathode, a possibility given the known behavior of P3HT on annealing60 (in our case, 140 °C for 10 min). Other possibilities included a partial degradation of PFDP through rupture of methylene-C60 bonds (this can be mitigated through dynamic thermal redistributions throughout the molecular structure)45 and low interfacial densities between PFDP and P3HT domains.

In an attempt to increase donor–acceptor interface densities, and improve contact resistances with the electrodes, P3HT-b-PFDP was solution blended with a commercially available P3HT (Mm = 50000 g mol−1) in a respective 1:2 ratio by weight. At this high block copolymer content, domain formation can be retained, although there is a risk of P3HT exclusion at interfaces.61 We were thus relieved to see that the device architecture schematized in Fig. 2b gave an improvement in Voc (0.52 V) suggesting a greater crystallization of P3HT segments, and better definition of domain interfaces. However, the efficiency only increased to 0.12%, again due to a high Rseries, a problem possibly arising with the exclusion of P3HT at the interface with the electrode. To confirm this interpretation, examination of the morphology of the (P3HT-b-PFDP)-blend-P3HT was performed. AFM images prior to and after annealing (respectively, Fig. 3a and b) demonstrate the change in morphology in going from an homogenous film with an amorphous surface roughened by small aggregates of block copolymer, to a system showing P3HT-nanofibrils covering the surface and concealing the block copolymer chains below, a process comparable to those observed elsewhere.61 Comparable bright-field (BF) TEM measurements (Fig. 4a) show the (P3HT-b-PFDP)-blend-P3HT film structure following annealing. There are long chains (>1 μm) of P3HT-b-PFDP with widths of around 20–30 nm wide, slightly larger than the repeating domain width initially envisioned but of the same order. The AFM and TEM characterisations show that with high-temperature annealing, self-assembly into standing lamellar and nanofibrillar morphologies occurs. The covalent bond between the donor and acceptor blocks has a significant effect on film morphology in the lateral direction, restricting phase separation and introducing structure of the order of 25 nm.

Note that the specific density difference between P3HT and PFDP enables the perception of various nanostructures. 
While it had been found that the P3HT domains in P3HT-b-PFDP could be “bulked-up” with P3HT, and the structuration inferred to be improved at a domain-local scale, the problem of P3HT exclusion from the bulk, reducing the efficiency of the devices, remained. To enhance the efficiency of the “direct” or so-called normal BHJ polymer solar cells, a critical element is that of preventing charge recombination while enhancing charge transfer and collection. The interfaces between the photoactive organic layer and the electrodes play a key role in determining these characteristics. In order to rectify the inversion formed at the cathode, we therefore employed, for the first time to our knowledge with block copolymers, a thin (10 nm) C60 layer at the cathode interface to give the device structure shown in Fig. 2c. C60 was chosen due to its ease of processing. It should be noted that PFDP has a LUMO around −4.05 eV, placed just below that of C60 (−3.75 eV).44 The J–V curve of this device is displayed in Fig. 5 and Table 2 shows the improvement in device performance with this additional C60 layer with P3HT-b-PFDP-blend-P3HT from 0.12% to 1.6% mostly due to an increase in Jsc from 0.73 to 6.18 mA cm−2, and in the FF from 30% to 48%; the Voc, however, remains virtually unchanged. Initially it would be expected, given the respective positions of PFDP and C60 LUMOs, that there might be a formation of an S-curve due to the inversion of electronic levels between the PFDP and the C60 at the cathodic side of the active layer, however, this was not observed. A possible explanation is that the C60 exhibits better electron transport than the P3HT-b-PFDP, thus reducing space-charges and permitting effective electron collection at the electrode. Encouraged by this result we sought to improve efficiencies further by studying inverted devices.

Inverted devices using cathodes based on ITO coated with ZnO have shown high efficiencies and stabilities.62 We used this set-up but with PEDOT-PSS as a hole-selective layer and initially just P3HT-b-PFDP in the photoactive layer (Fig. 2d). As Table 2 lists, there is a remarkable improvement in the P3HT-b-PFDP performance: Jsc increases from 0.5 to 9.80 mA cm−2; the Voc from 0.32 to 0.52 V; the FF from 32 to 55%; and the efficiency near 50-fold to 2.8%. This improvement could be associated with the huge reduction in Rseries, and points to a decrease in interfacial barriers at the electrodes. This is probably due to a better organization of the P3HT-b-PFDP and/or a concomitant reduction of dipoles which result in an increased charge transport.62 The possibility of this system being highly susceptible to substrate effects on casting therefore cannot be avoided, just as the hindrance of one block's crystallization by the presence of the other cannot be ignored, a quality observed for diblocks.63 Given this, we thought to blend P3HT-b-PFDP with P3HT to see if the P3HT would ease a greater crystallization of P3HT domains; the resulting device structure is displayed in Fig. 2e. Fig. 5 shows a considerable improvement in J–V curves when adding P3HT, and again as listed in Table 2, we find that this inverted P3HT-b-PFDP-blend-P3HT based device exhibits an increased efficiency of 3.3%, with an increase in Jsc to 10.53 mA cm−2, in the FF to 57% and the Voc to 0.55 V.
Having obtained a good efficiency on inverted devices based on P3HT-b-PFDP, this motivated us to incorporate the copolymer as a compatibilizer in a P3HT:PCBM blend. Han et al.64 and Renaud et al.65 have demonstrated the positive effect of donor–acceptor rod-coil block copolymers when used as nano-structuring agents in P3HT:PCBM blends, resulting in improved efficiency and morphologies. Significant interactions between the two blocks of P3HT-b-PFDP copolymer with P3HT and PCBM are expected. In this case, we used P3HT-b-PFDP as an additive with P3HT:PCBM (1:1) at various ratios (0.2%, 0.4%, 0.8% and 1% w/w) in the structure given in Fig. 2f. Table 3 lists the results that are summarized in Fig. 6. The performance of the devices was found to depend significantly on the amount of P3HT-b-PFDP copolymer: without adding any copolymer, the efficiency was 3.6%; with 0.2 wt% of P3HT-b-PFDP, it increased to 3.8%. The best performance was achieved when 0.4 wt% P3HT-b-PFDP was added where Voc = 0.56 V, Jsc = 11.70 mA cm−2, FF = 0.63, and PCE = 4.2%; the benefits arising from the improved fill factor and the changes in resistances. Further increasing the amount of compatibilizers, however, simply worsened the device.

 Fig. 6  Photovoltaic parameters: FF, Voc, Jsc and power conversion efficiency (PCE) for P3HT:PCBM based devices containing varying weight fractions of P3HT-b-PFDP. The devices were annealed at 140 °C for 10 min. Error bars were calculated by averaging over 6 devices. 
We investigated the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM blend with addition of the P3HT-b-PFDP compatibilizer again with BF-TEM (Fig. 4b). The particularity of the 0.4 wt% of P3HT-b-PFDP system is the apparent uniformity of interpenetrating P3HT:PCBM domains. A further increase in the concentration of P3HT-b-PFDP copolymer beyond 0.4 wt% caused the appearance of large sphere-like aggregates on the surface reducing the interfacial quality and the FF due to increased charge recombinations.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) of photo-generated charge carriers is given by the ratio between the number of electrons produced in the outer circuit to that of incident photons, taking into account reflection and transmission. Fig. 7 compares the IPCE spectra of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM + x wt% P3HT-b-PFDP/PEDOT-PSS/Ag, where x is the ratio of P3HT-b-PFDP added in to the BHJ active layer. In confirmation of the above results, the highest efficiency was obtained when using 0.4 wt% of P3HT-b-PFDP with a maximum of 68%. The enhancements in IPCE can be explained by an increase in the interfacial area between the donor and the acceptor due to the additive which in turn lead to increases in exciton dissociation and enhanced interfacial resistances.

Stability studies
The lifetime of organic solar cells remains highly challenging for further commercial development. Today, many reports have shown good progress, for example by employing modified fullerenes,66 block copolymer stabilizers,67 nucleating agents,68 polymer–polymer and polymer–oligomer systems,39,69 and by using inverted device structures permitting the use of more stable metal electrodes.70,71 Given the structuration effects of P3HT-b-PFDP and its covalently tied structure, a reasonably stable device was expected. Accordingly, Fig. 8 shows the variation in efficiency of four devices with time under simulated solar irradiation (100 mW cm−2), and indicates apparently quite exceptional stabilization effects arising from P3HT-b-PFDP, either when used by itself or as an additive. In fact, most extraordinary are the results from that of the device with only 0.4% wt P3HT-b-PFDP, where no change is observed over the considerable time of the test (>100 days). It should be noted that while these devices were stored under dry nitrogen and tested under air, these results suggest that P3HT-b-PFDP warrants further investigation as a stabilizing agent.

Conclusion
We have shown that it is facile to prepare and target a fullerene main-chain, multi-block copolymer for OPVs using the minimum of straight forward synthetic steps. P3HT-b-PFDP, obtained as a first attempt following back-of-envelop calculations for dimensions, was found by itself to give a good inverted device efficiency (2.8%), close to that of P3HT:PCBM. Moreover, P3HT-b-PFDP, when used as an additive in P3HT:PCBM gives a high efficiency (4.2% using 0.4 wt% P3HT-b-PFDP in P3HT:PCBM). However, the ease of synthesis would suggest that more development of the structure, for instance variation of inter-C60 groups so as to reduce the annealing temperature, modification of chain-lengths, and better purification, may allow higher efficiencies. The work with inverted geometry devices demonstrated the importance of attaining an architecture specific to the active layer, and suggested a susceptibility of the block copolymer to substrate surface energies. Future work will focus on using this block copolymer as an additive in bulk heterojunction small molecule devices. Finally, P3HT-b-PFDP demonstrated a surprising ability to give exceptional stability to P3HT:PCBM cells over long periods of time and merits more investigation for this point as well.
Experimental
Apparatus

1H (400 MHz) and 13C (100 MHz) NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker® Avance 400 spectrometer. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) was performed using THF as eluant at 40 °C and flow rate of 1 mL min−1 through 4 columns (TSK G5000HXL (9 μm), G4000HXL (6 μm), G3000HXL (6 μm), and G2000HXL (5 μm)) and connected to Varian refractometer and UV-visible spectrophotometer calibrated against linear polystyrene (PS) standards for use with P3HT and P3HT-containing copolymers. AFM was performed under air at 25 °C using a Nanoscope IIIa microscope operating in tapping-mode. The probes were commercially available silicon tips with a spring constant of 42 N m−1, a resonance frequency of 285 kHz, and a typical radius of curvature in the 8–10 nm range. Both topography and phase signal images were recorded at a resolution of 512 × 512 data points. TEM was performed using a Philips EM400 microscope at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV. BF-TEM measurements were prepared by floating the photoactive layer on water, transferring the film to a TEM copper grid and recording under slightly defocused conditions. Current density and voltage (J–V) characterisations of devices were conducted by a computer-controlled Keithley 4200 SCS and under AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) illumination (KHS Solarcell) calibrated against an IL1400BL radiometer.
Materials
C60 (99.9%) was obtained from MER Corporation (USA). PCBM (99%) was obtained from Solenne BV. Other materials were obtained from Aldrich (France), unless otherwise stated. Solvents were distilled from over their respective drying agents under dry nitrogen. K2CO3 was dried at 135 °C under reduced pressure for 24 h. Where possible, air and light were excluded from the handling of polymers, and reactions were performed in flame dried, dry nitrogen flushed glassware. α,ω-Dibromomethyl-PFDP was prepared via the route detailed elsewhere.43 α,ω-Benzylhydroxy-P3HT and 1,4-bis(cyclohexylmethyl ether)-2,5-dibromomethyl benzene were also prepared according to ref. 43. Improvements in the synthesis of P3HT-b-PFDP were made and therefore full details are given here.
Synthesis of P3HT-b-PFDP
α,ω-Dibromomethyl-PFDP [0.40 g, ca. 4 × 10−5 mol, with a molar mass distribution dominated by a peak (Mp) equivalent to around 9 repeat units equivalent to Mp ≈ 9930 g mol−1, polystyrene equivalent GPC indicated Mp = 490 g mol−1, Mn = 640 g mol−1, Đ = Mm/Mn = 1.4], α,ω-benzylhydroxy-P3HT (0.27 g, ca. 4.5 × 10−5 mol, Đ = 1.11, Mn = 11000 g mol−1, thus probable real Mn closer to52 around 6000 g mol−1, i.e., 36 thiophene units long), and excess 18-crown-6 (1.1 g, 4.2 × 10−3 mol) were dissolved in toluene (180 mL) at room temperature. Potassium carbonate (ca. 20 g, i.e. non-optimized excess) was added and the mixture stirred for 3 h at 80 °C. Salts were removed over a glass frit, and the solvates were collected from precipitation in methanol (700 mL). Following repeated washing in toluene (100 mL) and 18-crown-6 (3 g) and precipitation in methanol, the polymers were washed with methanol/water (1/1). Finally, excess PFDP and water was removed by washing with acetone. Drying under reduced pressure yielded 0.48 g (72%) product. GPC (UV, 254 nm, THF): peaks for block copolymer showed Mp = 14350 mol−1, Mn = 17260 g mol−1, Đ = 1.4. Within this, there were two major peaks: peak 1, Mp = 27520 mol−1, Mn = 35300 g mol−1, Đ = 1.1; peak 2, Mp = 14350 mol−1, Mn = 13100 g mol−1, Đ = 1.1. Peaks resulting from PFDP (ca. 30% wt) were also found. 1H NMR (400 MHz, C6D6, D1 = 6 s): 7.2 (s, thiophene-H), 3.95, 3.75 (PFDP–C60–CH2–), 3.6 (PFDP–CH2O–), 2.85 (P3HT, alkyl, α-H), 1.9 (PFDP–CH2–), 1.7 (P3HT–alkyl, α-H), 0.9 (P3HT–alkyl–H), 0.4 (P3HT–alkyl–H).
OSC preparation and characterisation
Commercially available regioregular P3HT (Plextronics Inc., Mn = 50000 g mol−1) and anhydrous chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1,2-DCB) (Aldrich, France) were used without further purification. Indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass electrodes (12 Ω □−1 Merck) were partially etched and ultra-sonically cleaned in successive washes of deionized water, acetone, ethanol and isopropanol. Substrates were subjected to UV–ozone treatment. Water-based dispersions of poly(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine)-compl-poly(vinylbenzenesulfonic acid) (PEDOT-PSS, Heraeus Precious Metals GmbH & Co KG) were spin-coated onto the freshly cleaned ITO and dried under reduced pressure (10 mbar) at 110 °C for 30 min to give 40 nm thick layers. All further manipulations were carried out under dry nitrogen. Active layer solutions were prepared in anhydrous chlorobenzene and spin-coated, unfiltered, onto PEDOT-PSS layers at 1000 rpm for 25 s to give in each case 6 comparable devices with 0.18 cm2 active layer areas. UV-visible characterisations, over the range 300–800 nm were carried out using a SAFAS UVMC2 spectrometer on samples that had been similarly spin-coated onto fused quartz substrates. To prepare the devices, the active layer was dried at 27 °C under 2 × 10−6 mbar for 1 h, before adding the thermally evaporated Al cathode (100 nm). Sequential insertion of the C60 interlayer (10 nm) resulted, in a the following typical device structure: glass/ITO/PEDOT-PSS/(P3HT-b-PFDP)-blend-P3HT(140 nm)/C60(10 nm)/Al (100 nm).
P3HT-b-PFDP “inverted” solar cells were fabricated using the following structure: ITO/ZnO/active layer/PEDOT-PSS/Ag. Cleaned glass/ITO substrates were coated with an organic precursor of Zinc Oxide nanoparticles dispersion (Genes-Ink ZnO5F2). The ZnO layer was spin-coated at 2400 rpm for 40 s and annealed at 140 °C for10 min. The ZnO layer was 30 nm-thick, measured using an Alpha-step IQ surface Profilometer. All procedures after ZnO deposition were performed in an inert-atmosphere glove box under nitrogen (O2 and H2O < 0.5 ppm). Subsequently, the photoactive layer was spin-coated on the top of the ZnO layer from 1,2-DCB solutions at 50 °C. The (P3HT-b-PFDP) or (P3HT-b-PFDP)-blend-P3HT solutions were spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 60 s on top of ZnO. The thickness of the photoactive layer was typically in the range of 120–140 nm. The 20 nm-thick PEDOT-PSS layers (Heraeus RD Clevios F010) were spin coated on the photoactive layer at 5500 rpm for 50 s (5000 rpm s−1). Subsequently, the 80 nm-thick silver (Ag) anode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of 10−6 mbar onto the PEDOT-PSS layers through a shadow mask (0.18 cm2). Finally, after removing the surplus polymer from around the evaporated Ag (to avoid an over estimated surface area), the cells were thermally annealed at 140 °C for 10 min under N2.
P3HT-b-PFDP, (P3HT-b-PFDP)-blend-P3HT (2:1 w/w) and P3HT:PCBM (1:1 w/w) solutions were prepared at 40 mg mL−1 concentrations in 1,2-DCB. To obtain the different ratio 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.8% and 1% w/w of P3HT-b-PFDP in P3HT:PCBM, P3HT-b-PFDP was first dissolved in 1,2-DCB at 5 mg mL−1 and then added at the appropriate ratio. To prepare the devices, the active layer was dried at 27 °C under 10−6 mbar for 1 h, before depositing the thermally evaporated Ag electrode (80 nm).
To facilitate comparisons with other works, a device was prepared using similar conditions with only P3HT (20 mg mL−1) and PCBM (20 mg mL−1) to give a 100 nm thick active layer. All cells were prepared as four sets of six cells (i.e., 24 cells per sample).
