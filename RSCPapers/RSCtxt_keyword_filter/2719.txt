    , Accepted 9th September 2013First published on 16th September 2013AbstractIn recent studies of inorganic materials for energy applications, surface modification processes have been shown to be among the most effective methods to enhance the performance of devices. Here, we demonstrate a facile nano-decoration method which is generally applicable to anatase TiO2 nanostructures, as well as a nano-decorated hierarchical TiO2 nanostructure which improves the energy conversion efficiency of a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC). Using a facile sol–gel method, 0-D, 1-D, and 2-D type anatase TiO2 nanostructures were decorated with 200 nm long anatase TiO2 nanorods to create various hierarchical nanostructures. A structural analysis reveals that the branched nanorod has a highly crystalline anatase phase with anisotropic growth in the [001] longitudinal direction. When one of the hierarchical structures, a chestnut bur-like nanostructure, was employed in a dye-sensitized solar cell as a scattering layer, offering increased dye-loading properties, preserving a sufficient level of light-scattering ability and preserving superior charge transport and recombination properties as well, the energy conversion efficiency of the cell improved by 19% (from 7.16% to 9.09%) compared to a cell with a 0-D TiO2 sphere as a scattering layer. This generally applicable anatase nanorod-decorating method offers potential applications in various energy-conversion applications, especially in DSSCs, quantum-dot solar cells, photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices, photocatalysis, and lithium ion batteries.
Introduction
Over the past several decades, the synthesis and application of nanostructured inorganic materials have increasingly become an important aspect of energy conversion research.1–6 Recently, surface modification of nanostructured inorganic materials by means of nano-decoration, i.e., the formation of nano-scale branches,3,4 nanopores,6 and nanoshells,7,8 has become one of the most widely used approaches to obtain a highly efficient energy conversion system. Nano-decoration can dramatically improve the performance of a device because it can provide novel functionalities like extremely high roughness/surface area,3–5,7 electronic band structure tuning,8 alleviation of huge volume changes,6 and surface passivation.7,9
Nanostructured TiO2 is one of the most interesting inorganic materials for energy applications due to its superior physical and chemical properties. In most cases, a large surface area of the TiO2 nanostructure is closely related to the high energy conversion efficiency of the device. Therefore, the nano-decoration of TiO2 nanostructures has been intensively studied for various energy conversion systems like dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),10,11 quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs),8 photoelectrochemical water-splitting devices,4 photocatalysis,12 and lithium ion batteries.3 In order to improve the surface area of one-dimensional (1-D) TiO2 nanostructures, which provide enhanced charge transport and light absorption properties but also are associated with a low surface area compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs), they are typically decorated with TiO2 nanobranches.4,10–12 For instance, a branched TiO2 1-D photoelectrode for a photoelectrochemical water splitting system showed quantum efficiency five times larger than that of a non-branched TiO2 1-D photoelectrode,4 and a DSSC with a nanorod branched hierarchical TiO2 nanowire electrode showed 45% enhanced photocurrent conversion efficiency compared to that of a DSSC with a bare TiO2 nanowire.11
Thus far, nano-decorations on TiO2 nanostructures have been formed via chemical bath deposition methods using titanium chloride (TiCl3 (ref. 5) or TiCl4 (ref. 10)), or conventional solvothermal methods using titanium isopropoxide13 or titanium butoxide.16 By using these methods, the host TiO2 nanostructure can be decorated with uniform TiO2 nanorods4,10 or nanosheets.14 However, such methods are limited in the rutile phase due to the low pH environment during the synthesis process. For many nanostructured TiO2 applications, anatase is the most suitable phase among TiO2 polymorphs, i.e., anatase (space group I41/amd), rutile (P42/mnm), and brookite (Pcab), because of its large surface area,15 more active hydroxylated surface,16 electrochemically appropriate conduction band edge position,17 superb electron transport property,15 and low charge carrier recombination rate.16 Therefore, it is highly desirable to conceive a facile method for anatase TiO2 branching. To the best of our knowledge, there have been few reports on anatase nanorod branching on the TiO2 host structure, and in those that do exist, there are only a few reports on nanodots14 or non-uniformly covered short nanorods.11
Herein, we present anatase TiO2 nanorod-decorated hierarchical nanostructures that are synthesized via a modified sol–gel method, which is generally applicable to various anatase host structures. We successfully synthesized various hierarchical nanostructures (3-D) decorated with 200 nm long well-crystallized anatase nanorod branches onto anatase sphere (0S),18 anatase wire (1W),19 and anatase thin film (2F) host structures. This anatase nanorod branching enlarged the specific surface area of the nanostructures by 8 times. Moreover, we demonstrate the feasibility of this nanorod-branched hierarchical nanostructure for energy conversion devices through the adoption of a hierarchical nanostructure, nanorod-branched anatase spheres (BS), and surface-area-enhanced multifunctional light-scattering particles.
Experimental section
Preparation of various types of anatase TiO2 hosts

0-Dimensional sphere type TiO2 host (0S) preparation. 
0-Dimensional spherical TiO2 (0S) was prepared based on the synthesis process reported by Sugimoto et al.18 A mixed solvent of butanol and acetonitrile at a volume ratio of 1:1 was prepared, and titanium(IV) tetra-n-butoxide (TBO) (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in the mixed solvent to make a 0.05 M TBO solution (solution A, 40 mL). Another mixed solution containing 0.03 M ammonia and 0.5 M distilled water was also prepared (solution B, 40 mL). These two solutions were preheated to 30 °C on a heating plate while stirring. The reaction was started by pouring solution B into solution A at a 1 s interval while stirring, which was followed by aging for 2 h at 30 °C. After 2 h, the remaining precipitate was washed two times each with ethanol, acetone, and distilled water by centrifugation and then freeze-dried. The dried precipitate was calcined at 450 °C for 2 h in air.


1-Dimensional wire type TiO2 host (1W) preparation. 
1-Dimensional anatase TiO2 wire arrays (1W) were synthesized on 0.127 mm thick titanium foil (Sigma-Aldrich) by a three-step synthesis method originally reported by Aydil et al.19 First, a piece of titanium foil (1.5 × 2 cm2) was ultrasonically cleaned in a mixed solution of distilled water, acetone and 2-propanol (volume ratio 1:1:1) for 10 min and was placed against the wall of a 130 ml Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave filled with 100 ml of a 1 M NaOH aqueous solution. The autoclave was then put in an electric oven at 220 °C for 4 h. After the first alkali hydrothermal growth process, the titanium foil covered with the Na2Ti2O5·H2O nanowire array was immersed in 0.6 M HCl solution for 1 h to exchange Na+ with H+. The titanium foil was rinsed with pure ethanol and dried under ambient conditions. In the third step, the dried titanium foil covered with nanowires was calcined in a furnace at 450 °C for 1 h.


2-Dimensional thin film type TiO2 host (2F) preparation. 
A piece of flexible titanium foil (0.127 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) used as a substrate (1.5 × 1.5 cm2) was ultrasonically cleaned for 10 min each in acetone, ethanol and distilled water. The TiO2 thin film was formed by plasma-enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD). Titanium isopropoxide (TTIP, Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4, Up Chem.) was used as a precursor. The working pressure was 2.0 Torr and the plasma power was 150 W. The anatase TiO2 film was grown on Ti foil at 200 °C by sequentially dosing TTIP precursors for 2 s, purging the extra precursors for 3 s, and applying O2 plasma for 3 s. 450 cycles in total were performed to achieve a 2-D anatase thin film TiO2 (2F) that was 20 nm thick.

Synthesis method of branched single-crystalline anatase TiO2 nanorods
A stock solution of Ti4+ (0.5 M) was prepared by mixing TTIP (97%, Sigma-Aldrich) and triethanolamine (TEOA, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) with a molar ratio of 1:2, followed by the addition of distilled water. The prepared stock solution (pH ∼ 9.3) was then mixed with ethylenediamine (0.4 M, denoted as ED in this work) to adjust the pH of the solution to 11.5. The prepared anatase TiO2 host structures were then added to the mixed solution. This solution was placed in an electric oven and aged at 90 °C for 24 h (first aging). After the end of the first aging process, the gel was transferred to an autoclave and aged at 140 °C for 24 h (second aging). After the completion of the aging process, the branched TiO2 nanostructures were formed. The 0-D TiO2 nanoparticles were washed and centrifuged with NaOH, HNO3, and distilled water to remove residual organic compounds from the surface, as reported in our previous report.20 1-D and 2-D TiO2 were ultrasonically cleaned for 5 min each in NaOH, HNO3, and distilled water and dried under a N2 flow.
Fabrication of DSSCs
The dense-TiO2 layer (d-TiO2) to block the back-electron transfer was formed on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates (TEC8, 8 Ω per square, Pilkington) by spin-coating a TiO2 polymeric sol. The TiO2 polymeric sol was prepared via a sol–gel process as reported elsewhere.21 For the preparation of a porous TiO2 active layer and a scattering layer, the commercial TiO2 NP paste (DSL 18NR-T, Dyesol) and the prepared scattering particles were screen-printed (area: 0.2 × 0.8 cm2) on the d-TiO2-coated FTO. As a reference scattering layer, a commercial scattering layer paste (CCIC, Japan) was used. Each screen-printed TiO2 layer was aged at room temperature for 6 min and then dried at 50 °C for 5 min, and followed by annealing at 450 °C for 1 h in air. The TiO2 photoelectrodes were immersed in a 0.5 mM N719 dye solution [ruthenium (2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxilate)2(NCS)2, Solaronix, Switzerland, dissolved in acetonitrile and tert-butanol (volume ratio 1:1)] for 12 h at room temperature. Afterward, these photoelectrodes were rinsed with ethanol in order to remove the physisorbed N719 dye molecules. The N719-loaded electrode was then assembled with the prepared Pt counter electrode using a sealing plastic (60 μm, SX1170-60, Solaronix) to form a sandwich-type DSSC. A drop of electrolyte solution (Iodolyte, Merck) was infiltrated between the two electrodes of the cell.
Characterization
The crystal structures of various TiO2 hosts and branched TiO2 structures were characterized using an X-ray diffractometer (New D8-Advance, Bruker Miller Co.). To analyze the morphology and crystal structure of the single anatase branches, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM, JEM-3000F, JEOL) was used. The morphologies and microstructures of the prepared TiO2 were investigated using a field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6330F, JEOL). Cross-sectional TEM images of the BS-TiO2 were obtained with the aid of a focused ion beam system (FIB system, SMI3050SE, SII Nanotechnology). The specific surface areas of the TiO2 nanoparticles and sorption isotherms of the TiO2 films were measured using a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) analyzer (Model BELSORP-mini II, BEL). The reflectance of various TiO2 films and the amount of dye adsorbed on the 0S and BS monolayer films were measured by means of ultraviolet-visible light (UV-vis) spectroscopy (Lambda 35, Perkin-Elmer). The photovoltaic properties of the fabricated DSSCs under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2) with a shadow mask were measured with the aid of a solar simulator (Peccell Technologies) and a potentiostat (CHI 608C, CH instruments). The light intensity of the solar simulator was calibrated using a reference cell (PV Measurements). The incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded from 400 to 800 nm with the Mc-science spectral system (Polaronix K3100). An electrochemical workstation (Zennium, Zahner) with an attached frequency response analyzer and a light emitting diode (667 nm) was utilized for the intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS).
Results and discussion
Properties and growth mechanism of anatase nanorod branching
The TiO2 nanorod branches were successfully grown on various anatase TiO2 nanostructures via a modified sol–gel method known as the gel–sol method or a two-step sol–gel method (henceforth, the TSSG method), which has been described in previous reports by Sugimoto et al.22,23 as well as in our previous work.20 TiO2 nanoparticles with a uniform size distribution and various shapes can be obtained by the TSSG method, because a particulate sol that is the final product of the TSSG process is transformed from a highly condensed metal hydroxide gel which protects the growing particles from coagulation.20 Moreover, a well-crystallized anatase nanorod with a high aspect ratio (about 10–20) can be synthesized under high pH (>10) with the aid of an amino acid.
In this study, we applied the TSSG method to grow uniform anatase nanorods on the surface of various anatase TiO2 host structures. The 0-D, 1-D, and 2-D type anatase TiO2 hosts (for synthesis and crystal structure of the host structures, see Fig. S1, ESI†) were placed into a hydrothermal reactor with a solution containing Ti4+ and ethylenediamine (ED). The solution was then aged at 90 °C for 24 h. After the Ti(OH)4 gel formation during this first aging step, the gel was aged again at 140 °C for 24 h as the second aging step to nucleate and grow nanorods in the gel network.22 Field-emission scanning electron microscopic (FESEM) images and the illustrations shown in Fig. 1 represent the host nanostructures and the final hierarchical nanostructures. Through the TSSG process, uniform TiO2 nanorods were decorated on the surface of TiO2 hosts, which transformed sphere type (0S), nanowire type (1W) and thin film type (2F) nanostructures into 3-D hierarchical nanostructures in the form of a branched sphere (BS), branched nanowire (BW), and branched thin film (BF), respectively.

The nanorod branches and nanorod/host interfaces were observed using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Fig. 2a shows chest-nut bur-like BSs, uniformly covered by 200 nm long nanorods. These branched nanorods were uniformly and densely grown on the surface of the host TiO2 (shown in Fig. S2a, ESI†). Fig. 2b shows a HRTEM image of a branched nanorod, showing a single-crystalline nanorod which has a 20 nm thick width and highly rough surface. As shown in Fig. 2b, the lattice spacings of 0.35 nm, 0.19 nm and 0.24 nm correspond to the (101), (200) and (004) planes of the anatase TiO2 crystal; therefore, the longitudinal direction is the [001] direction of the tetragonal structure. This anisotropic growth of a branched nanorod is due to the specific adsorption of amino acid groups from ED onto the anatase crystal planes parallel to the c-axis.20 In addition, branched nanorods were composed of {101} and {100} exposed facets. According to the results reported by Cheng et al., the reactivity order of exposed facets of anatase TiO2 was {001} < {101} < {100} because of differences in atomic coordination and electronic band structures.24,25

FFT images of the decorated nanorod part and the host part of (d) are shown in Fig. S2, ESI.† Focused ion beam milling was used to take the cross-sectional TEM images shown in (c) and (d). 

Fig. 2c and d show cross-sectional images of the BS interface. The continuous lattice crossing the nanorod/host interface clearly reveals the epitaxial growth of the nanorod from the surface of the host material. Fast Fourier-transform (FFT) images of the host and the nanorod parts in Fig. 2d (see Fig. S2c and d, ESI†) yielded a set of sharp spots with the same angles, indexed to the (11), (101), and (004) planes of the anatase phase, indicating the epitaxial growth of the nanorod to the [001] direction of the host material. Considering that the core host 0S is composed of polycrystalline nanograins (shown in Fig. S3, ESI†), it can be deduced that the (004) planes exposed to the surface can act as seeds for the epitaxial growth of the nanorods while the other parts are blocked by ED.

Fig. 3 is an illustration showing the nanorod branching process. Prepared TiO2 hosts were put into a stock solution (pH 11.5) containing Ti4+ (0.5 M) and ED, as shown in Fig. 3a. During the first step of the reaction (Fig. 3b), a highly condensed Ti(OH)4 gel is formed,22 and this Ti(OH)4 gel network covers the surface of the host TiO2. During the subsequent second aging process (Fig. 3c), TiO2 nucleation occurs in the gel network. The nucleus gradually grows to TiO2, and the amino acid groups of ED are selectively adsorbed onto the planes parallel to the c-axis of TiO2, thereby leading to anisotropic crystal growth along the [001] direction of anatase TiO2.22 Therefore, at the interface of the host TiO2 and the gel, the exposed (004) crystal planes of the host TiO2 can serve as a nucleus for the nanorod growth by aiding in the selective adsorption of the amino acid groups to other planes, which results in the epitaxial growth of TiO2 nanorods on the host TiO2. As clearly shown in Fig. 3d, when TiO2 nucleates itself in the gel network, i.e., nucleates not at the host surface, it grows into a free-standing nanorod with similar morphology to the nanorods grown on the host surface. This decoration method can be applied to diverse materials because this process enables anatase nanorod decoration on a prepared host structure, differentiated from simultaneous growth of nanobranches and host structure.

A typical DSSC is composed of a photoelectrode which consists of a nanoporous TiO2 active layer, dye molecules, transparent conducting oxide (TCO), an iodide electrolyte, and a Pt counter electrode.26 Additionally, the light scattering TiO2 layer is usually deposited on the active layer for highly efficient DSSCs, in order to increase the photon penetration path to fully absorb the long wavelength light (about 600 to 800 nm).27,28 For efficient light scattering in that wavelength range, a few hundred nanometer-sized spherical TiO2 particles have been used to confine the incident photon via the Mie scattering.29,30 Recently, there have been some reports on the bifunctional hierarchical structures as a scattering layer, which improved the surface area even while preserving the light scattering property. These hierarchical structures are submicron-sized secondary particle-like structures comprised of nanometer-sized particles or pores, such as mesoporous TiO2 spheres,30,31 nano-embossed hollow spherical TiO2,32 hierarchical TiO2 microsphere,33 and inverse opal TiO2 structures34 that have been shown to possess good dye adsorption and light scattering properties.
To attest to the effects of the anatase nanorod branch on the properties of an energy conversion device, we demonstrate the feasibility of this nanorod-branched hierarchical nanostructure for energy conversion devices. Among the various branched hierarchical structures, the BS TiO2 particles are expected to be good multifunctional particles for the scattering layer of DSSCs due to their submicron-size diameter, potentially high surface area, and single-crystallinity. Fig. 4 confirms that the BS is in a well-crystallized anatase TiO2 phase with a large surface area and sufficient light-scattering properties. The XRD results, as shown in Fig. 4a, verify that all the synthesized products are well-crystallized anatase TiO2 without any other secondary phases. Fig. 4b shows the pore-size distribution of the 0S and BS. As expected, nano-decoration increases the pore volume significantly. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the BS (29.36 m2 g−1) is nearly 8 times larger than that of the 0S (3.82 m2 g−1). The diffuse reflectance (Fig. 4c) of the BS is about 70% in the wavelength range of 550–800 nm, which is very similar to that of the 0S. Moreover, the BS film exhibits higher reflectance than that of the 0S film in the 550 nm wavelength regions mainly due to nanorods branching as confirmed by the reflectance of the free-standing nanorod film (Fig. S4, ESI†). The free-standing nanorods exhibit higher reflectance in the smaller wavelength.

Effects of anatase nanorod branching on photoconversion devices
The feasibility of the nanorod-branched hierarchical nanostructure for a DSSC was investigated by employing the BS as a surface-area-enhanced light-scattering particle (i.e. bifunctional particle). Fig. 5a shows the photoconversion efficiency (called “efficiency” in shortly) of the BS particle-based DSSC as a function of the scattering layer thickness. For comparison, efficiency of DSSCs employs a commercial TiO2 scattering particle (CCIC, Japan) and the 0S particle to plot. Every cell type exhibits a maximum efficiency at a certain scattering layer thickness (tmax). The saturation trend in efficiencies above the tmax is due to competition between increasing electron generation and decreasing electron collection efficiency.32,33 It is notable that the BS-based DSSC outperformed the other cell types; by increasing the BS thickness, efficiency increases from 6.85% to 9.09% (tmax = 13.5 μm), while an additional active layer increases it to 7.16% (4.3 μm), 0S increases it further to 7.67% (17.1 μm), and CCIC increases it to 8.26% (9.7 μm). Fig. 5b shows the photocurrent density-voltage (J–V) of each DSSC that employs each tmax of scattering layer. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1.† As shown in Fig. 5b and Table S1,† the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF) of the DSSCs do not display a significant difference. On the other hand, the short circuit current density (Jsc) is significantly different so the efficiency is influenced almost entirely by Jsc. The BS-based DSSCs exhibits the highest Jsc (17.2 mA cm−2), which is higher than that of the 0S-based DSSCs by 19%. Moreover, this Jsc value is higher than that of the additional active layer and CCIC-based DSSCs by 30% and 10%, respectively. The superior Jsc and efficiency of the BS-based DSSC are attributed to the increased specific surface area of the BS while preserving the high reflectance. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra (Fig. 5c) show that the BS-based DSSC exhibits better IPCE than that of the other DSSCs over the entire wavelength region, which is consistent with the Jsc results. In general, Jsc can be approximated by the expression. Jsc = qηlhηinjηccI0(1)where q is the elementary charge, ηlh is the light-harvesting efficiency, ηinj is the charge-injection efficiency, ηcc is the charge collection efficiency, and I0 is the incident photon flux (light intensity).35 Among these parameters, ηlh is directly related to the amount of adsorbed dye and the light-scattering properties of the photoelectrode.36 In as much as all of DSSCs have the same thickness of the active layer in this work, the ηlh is primarily influenced by the property of the scattering layer. The amount of adsorbed dye molecules per surface volume on the BS (Fig. S6, ESI†) is approximately 5 times higher than that on the 0S, and this results in the higher IPCE spectra in the short wavelength region from 400 nm to 550 nm compared to 0S. In addition, the normalized IPCE spectra over the 530 nm region (inset of Fig. 5c) show that the scattering property of the BS is vastly superior to that of the other scattering layer. This is ascribed to the synergy effect of excellent light-scattering and dye-adsorption, because 0S and BS films had similar reflectivity in this long wavelength region. Furthermore, the BS-based DSSC exhibits a higher IPCE than that of the commercial CCIC-based DSSC, which can also be understood for the same reasons. These outstanding properties of the BS were also checked via testing the BS in DSSCs as a single active layer. A much higher Jsc in the BS single-layer-based DSSC resulted compared to the 0S and CCIC single-layer-based DSSC (Fig. S7 and Table S2, ESI†).
 Fig. 5  (a) Photo conversion efficiency of the DSSCs employing different scattering layers as a function of the scattering layer (SL) thickness. Each electrode was fabricated with a default ∼7.3 μm thick active layer, because scattering layers were ineffective above that thickness of the active layer. The efficiency of the DSSC with the default active layer only is 5.39%, which is denoted as the dotted black line at 0 μm of SL thickness. The inset presents the structure of the multilayered DSSC electrode; scattering layer/active layer/dense-TiO2 blocking layer (d-TiO2)/FTO. (b) J–V curves of the DSSCs employing each scattering layer with the corresponding tmax (additional active layer – 4.3 μm, 0S – 17.1 μm, BS – 13.5 μm, CCIC – 9.7 μm). (c) IPCE spectra of the DSSCs employ each type of SL with the corresponding tmax. The inset of Fig. 5c shows the normalized IPCE spectra from 530 nm to 800 nm. (d) and (e) Electron transport (IMPS) time constant and electron recombination (IMVS) time constant as a function of the photoelectron density and open-circuit voltage for the DSSCs employing each type of scattering layer with the corresponding tmax, respectively. 

η
cc is generally affected by the competition between recombination and charge transport.37 We carried out the intensity modulated photocurrent and photovoltage spectroscopy (IMPS/IMVS) of DSSCs employing each type of scattering layer with tmax under short circuit and open circuit conditions, respectively, to confirm the effect of the anatase nanorods branch on the dynamics of charge transport and recombination. Fig. 5d and e present the results in the form of transport time constants and recombination time constants as the function of a photoelectron density and open-circuit voltage (Voc), respectively. All samples show a typical power-law dependence of the transport time and recombination time constants on the photoelectron density and Voc value, which are in compliance with the well-known trapping–detrapping model generally used to explain electron transport/recombination in DSSCs.38Fig. 5d shows that the DSSC with BS has transport time constants comparable to those of the 0S-based DSSC as well as smaller transport time constants than the CCIC-based DSSC, despite the fact that the surface area of BS is much larger than that of the 0S (by 8 times) and the BS layer (at tmax) is much thicker than the CCIC layer (by 1.4 times). Commonly, the transport-limiting traps are located mainly on the surfaces of the TiO2 nanoparticles. Therefore, the electron transport gets slower when the surface area of the TiO2 film increases.39 The overall surface area changes with the film thickness and the specific surface area when the film area (i.e. active area, 0.16 cm2) is fixed. Considering the thicker film thickness and larger specific surface area of BS-based photoelectrodes as compared to CCIC-based photoelectrodes (the BET surface area of the BS is 29.36 m2 g−1 and that of the CCIC is 14.67 m2 g−1), the BS has superior electron transport properties compared to the CCIC. The branched nanorods, which are composed of single crystals which are 200 nm long, have fewer surface trap sites on their overall surface area due to their high crystallinity, which is in good agreement with results reported by Yanagida et al.40 They also have fewer grain boundaries compared to nanoparticles. Thus, the charge transport properties of the BS layer were comparable to those of the 0S layer, even with the much larger surface area of the BS layer (5 times larger than the 0S layer, as shown in Fig. S6, ESI†).39 Recombination time constants of the DSSCs are plotted in Fig. 5e. Although the BS layer increases the film thickness and surface area, the charge recombination in the BS-based DSSC slows significantly compared to other DSSCs, which is ascribed to the 200 nm length single-crystal anatase nanorods on the BS particles. A plot of the electron transport time constants and recombination time constants versus scattering layer thickness (Fig. S8, ESI†) at a photocurrent density (Jsc = 0.5 mA cm−2) shows that the transport and recombination properties of BS are well maintained with increasing layer thickness. The charge-collection process is determined by the competition between the charge-transport and charge-recombination factors. Thus, the BS-based DSSC has superior charge-collection properties due to its outstanding charge-transport characteristics and repressed recombination properties, despite the fact that the BS layer has a larger surface area than that of the 0S or the CCIC layer. Branched anatase nanorods on the 0S-TiO2 host provide three advantages on the aspects of Jsc of DSSCs: first, improved dye loading ability originating from the increasing surface area. Second, preservation of the scattering property of host TiO2 occurred. Third, maintenance of excellent charge collection properties even in a tremendously thick scattering layer.
Conclusions
In summary, we report a facile and generally applicable method to decorate the anatase TiO2 nanorod on the surface of various anatase TiO2 nanostructures. 0-D anatase sphere, 1-D anatase wire, and 2-D anatase thin film structures were successfully decorated with 200 nm long single crystal anatase nanorod branches. These branched nanorods enlarged the specific surface area significantly; in the case of the 0-D anatase sphere, the specific surface area was increased by 8 times (from 3.82 m2 g−1 to 29.36 m2 g−1). We also demonstrate the feasibility of the nanorod-branched hierarchical nanostructure for a DSSC by employing the nanorod-branched spheres (BS) as surface-area-enhanced light-scattering particles. As a result, the BS-based photoanode exhibited much higher photo-energy conversion efficiency (9.09%) compared to the efficiency of a commercial CCIC-based photoanode (8.26%) and a 0S-based photoanode (7.67%) due to the superior dye adsorption, sufficient light scattering ability and preservation of superior charge transport, and recombination properties.
