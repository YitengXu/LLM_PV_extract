    , Accepted 17th April 2019First published on 18th April 2019AbstractA flexible, saddle-like, π-conjugated skeleton composed of four fused thiophene rings forming a cyclooctatetrathiophene (CoTh) with four triphenylamines (CoTh-TTPA) is presented as a hole-transporting material (HTM) for perovskite solar cells. The new HTM shows a bright red color stemming from a direct conjugation between the TPA groups and the central CoTh scaffold. This results in a charge transfer band due to the combination of the weak acceptor moiety, the CoTh unit, and the electron-donating p-methoxytriphenylamine groups. CoTh-TTPA exhibits a suitable highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level in relation to the valence band edge of the perovskite, which ensures efficient hole extraction at the perovskite/HTM interface. It has been applied as the HTM in combination with a mixed perovskite ([FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15) and a state-of-the-art triple cation perovskite ([(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08) reaching noticeable light-to-energy conversion efficiencies of 16.3 and 15.9%, respectively. These values are slightly lower than those measured for the benchmark spiro-OMeTAD HTM. The HTM properties have been analyzed by means of photoluminescence and conductivity experiments, which demonstrated a better hole extraction and conductivity for spiro-OMeTAD.
Introduction
The increasing global energy demand and the progressive depletion of fossil fuels, along with its worrisome effects on our environment, have driven the society to seek alternatives for the production of energy. The “practically limitless” energy from the Sun represents the most realistic attainable alternative through the optimization of photovoltaic technologies for the transformation of solar energy into electricity. In this regard, perovskites have stepped into the spotlight for light-harvesting applications due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties, low exciton binding energy, absorption over the whole visible region, tunable band-gap and large exciton diffusion lengths.1–3 In the first pioneering report, organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites were employed by Miyasaka as a light sensitizer for liquid-based, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) lower than 3.8%.4 Since then, a large variety of mixed perovskites with the general ABX3 formula has been studied. Typically, small organic cations such as methylammonium (MA), formamidinium (FA) or guanidinium (Gua) with a metal dication (Pb2+, Sn2+) and halides as the anions (generally Br− or I−) are used.5,6 Mixing the different components, cations and/or anions, in the perovskite structure leads to the formation of compositionally engineered mixed-perovskites (e.g., [FAPbI3]1−x[MAPbBr3]x) that display enhanced properties compared with the standard perovskite MAPbI3. By increasing the MAPbBr3 content, a blue-shifted absorption of the perovskite material and improved stability were observed.7
Owing to the ambipolar charge transport ability of perovskites, alternative device architectures have been explored, either in conventional or in inverted configurations, by just varying the charge selective contact. The conventional architecture (n–i–p) can be divided into mesoscopic, using a dense mesoporous layer of TiO2 (mp-TiO2), in which the perovskite material is infiltrated into the scaffold, and planar heterojunction, in which the perovskite is sandwiched between an electron-transporting layer (ETL) and a hole-transporting material (HTM).
To date, the best-performing PSC devices reported incorporate a fluorene-terminated spirobifluorene as the HTM in the mesoporous structure, reaching PCE values of up to 23.2%.8,9 It is important to note that the HTM-free PSC devices only reached limited PCEs (up to 13%),10 highlighting the crucial role that the HTMs play in the photovoltaic device. They not only extract the photogenerated holes formed within the perovskite film, but also transport them to the electrodes. Although HTM-based devices currently exhibit promising stability that surpasses one year, further improving their stability is an important task to meet the market requirements.
A wide number of HTMs,11 from polymers12–14 to inorganic materials,15–17 have been reported in the literature. Small organic molecules11 have also received significant attention and, in particular, the well-known and widely used spiro-OMeTAD (2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene).18,19 The preparation of spiro-OMeTAD requires a low temperature and harsh acidic/basic conditions along with a sublimation-grade purity to obtain highly efficient devices. These drawbacks have motivated the scientific community to prepare new organic HTMs to develop easily attainable and low-cost materials for large-scale photovoltaic applications. However, a clear relationship between the organic structure of the HTM and the photovoltaic performance has not yet been established. Thus, a vast variety of alternative building blocks have been explored as central scaffolds with the aim of outperforming the efficiencies attained by spiro-OMeTAD. For instance, spiro-based central scaffolds inspired by spiro-OMeTAD have been extensively studied, providing PCEs over 20%.20–22 In addition to the spiro-like HTMs, a wide variety of planar conjugated central cores have been investigated to enhance the hole-carrier mobility of the HTM.23,24 π-Extended, sulfur-rich compounds have been used as central scaffolds for constructing new HTMs to favour strong intermolecular π–π interactions.25–31 Furthermore, donor–acceptor systems following a similar design to that employed for dyes in the DSSCs have also been included as potential HTM candidates.32–34 Additionally, extraordinarily simple molecules such as carbazole-based enamine have been reported as HTMs.35,36 They achieved excellent photovoltaic performances proving that high structural complexity is not necessary to reach high efficiencies.
Herein, we report a new hole-transporting material (CoTh-TTPA) that incorporates an exotic, non-planar, 8π, thiophene-rich core, endowed with four p-methoxytriphenylamine (TPA) units (Fig. 1). The cyclooctatetrathiophene (CoTh) core is formed by four thiophene rings connected at positions 2 and 3, resulting in a special flexible π-conjugated skeleton with an 8π-electron annulene core. The non-planar structure of this scaffold could in principle be transformed into a planar geometry by an aromaticity conversion for the reduced 10π dianion or the oxidized 6π dication according to the Hückel's (4n + 2) rule. The novel CoTh-TTPA HTM has been implemented in mesoporous PSCs in combination with the compositionally engineered perovskite [FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15 and also with the triple cation perovskite [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08 and the photovoltaic performance of the resulting solar cells has been evaluated. The new HTM exhibits notable efficiencies compared to those reported for the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD. Likewise, a detailed study of the optical, electrochemical and thermal properties of CoTh-TTPA assisted by density functional theory (DFT) calculations has also been undertaken.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of CoTh-TTPA
The synthetic outline for the preparation of the CoTh-TTPA HTM is described in Scheme 1. 3,3′-Dibromo-5,5′-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′-bithiophene (1) was treated in the presence of n-BuLi and copper chloride to form the central CoTh motif (2) according to a modified synthetic approach previously reported by Wang.37–39 Then, selective bromination using N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) followed by a four-fold Suzuki cross-coupling reaction, with the electron-donating p-methoxytriphenylamine, successfully afforded the new HTM in a three-step protocol with a good overall yield (44%). A complete structural characterization of CoTh-TTPA was achieved using standard techniques such as 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FTIR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) that confirmed the presence of the aforementioned compound (see the ESI,† for further details). As representative spectroscopic features, the 1H NMR spectrum reveals the symmetry of the structure, which exhibits only one singlet (δ = 7.38 ppm) corresponding to the four β protons of the thiophene rings. The chemical structure of the CoTh-TTPA was ascertained by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS).

Structural and electronic properties
The structural and electronic properties of the CoTh-TTPA HTM were initially studied by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** level in the presence of a solvent (CH2Cl2). The CoTh core, the pendant triphenylamine TPA moiety, and the reference spiro-OMeTAD compound were also computed for comparative purposes (see the ESI,† for full computational details).
Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the minimum-energy B3LYP/6-31G**-optimized structures calculated for the CoTh core and the CoTh-TTPA HTM, and Fig. S2 (ESI†) displays the most representative bond lengths computed for both systems. The molecular structure is entirely determined by the central cyclooctatetrathiophene unit, which shows a C2-symmetry saddle-like structure with two opposite thiophene rings pointing up and the other two pointing down (Fig. 1c and Fig. S1, ESI†). The distortion from planarity of the central CoTh moiety is characterized by the folding angle α that defines the tilting of the thiophene rings with respect to the central molecular plane (Fig. S1, ESI†). The determined α values are similar for both the CoTh core (40°) and the CoTh-TTPA HTM (39°). The saddle-like structure obtained for CoTh-TTPA is similar to that found for other neutral cyclooctatetraene derivatives.40 The thiophene rings condensed to the cyclooctatetraene moiety preserve their characteristic structural pattern with a clear single–double carbon–carbon (CC) alternating backbone, which is similar to that found for other related thiophene derivatives.41,42 Nevertheless, the inter-thiophene CC bonds are computed to exhibit longer values (1.459 and 1.476 Å) than those obtained, for instance, for linear oligothiophenes (ca., 1.420 Å). This lengthening is due to the non-bonding interactions between vicinal thiophene rings and indicates a less effective π-conjugated pathway between these rings. For CoTh-TTPA, the insertion of the four TPA units results in hardly any substantial change to the structural shape and in the bond distances of the conjugated core. For the latter, a slight lengthening of the single CC and carbon–sulfur bonds and a shortening of the double CC bonds of the thiophene rings is predicted (Fig. S2, ESI†).

Fig. 2 displays the frontier molecular orbitals calculated for TPA, the CoTh core, the CoTh-TTPA HTM and the spiro-OMeTAD reference compound. The highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the CoTh core, computed at −5.64 eV, is noticeably lower in energy than the HOMO of TPA (−4.77 eV), indicating a weaker electron-donor character. Therefore, for the four-armed CoTh-TTPA HTM, the incorporation of the TPA moieties results in a destabilization of the HOMO level (−4.62 eV), improving its electron-donor character and approaching the HOMO level calculated for spiro-OMeTAD (−4.44 eV). Note that the HOMO of CoTh-TTPA spreads not only over the central CoTh core but also over the peripheral TPA moieties connected to the thiophene rings. It is important to remark that an important charge transfer occurs from the terminal TPA groups to the sulfur-rich central core, which holds a total net charge of −0.51e for CoTh-TTPA. The electronic structure of the CoTh-TTPA HTM is therefore predicted to be significantly polarized.

Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra of CoTh-TTPA in dichloromethane solution are shown in Fig. 3a, and the recorded maximum absorption and emission wavelengths are gathered in Table 1. The optical band gap (E0–0) was estimated from the intersection of the absorption and emission bands. In the UV-Vis absorption spectrum, two broad absorption bands covering the 250–500 nm range are observed. The first band at the shorter wavelength, peaking at ca. 290 nm, is tentatively assigned to the characteristic optical features of the peripheral TPA units, whereas the broad absorption band spreading over the 350–500 nm range is attributed to the π-extension of the central scaffold by introducing the electron-donating TPA units. For CoTh-TTPA, it is reasonable to expect the appearance of charge-transfer bands stemming from the direct conjugation between the TPA groups, acting as donor units, and the central CoTh scaffold, acting as the acceptor moiety. This interaction could explain the broad shoulder observed in the absorption band located at around 400 nm. On the other hand, the emission spectrum of CoTh-TTPA shows a broad fluorescence band peaking at 550 nm with a large Stokes’ shift. An optical band gap (E0–0) of 2.70 eV was estimated for CoTh-TTPA from the intersection of the absorption and emission bands, which is significantly lower than that recorded for spiro-OMeTAD (3.05 eV) and is in agreement with the narrower HOMO–LUMO gap calculated for CoTh-TTPA (Fig. 2).

A theoretical simulation of the absorption spectrum for CoTh-TTPA (Fig. S3, ESI†) was performed from the B3LYP/6-31G** time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculation of the lowest-energy 80 singlet excited electronic states (Sn) in the presence of CH2Cl2. The theoretical spectrum correctly reproduces the shape of the experimental spectrum with two intense bands approximately centred at 302 and 430 nm. The lowest-energy band at 430 nm results from the S0 → Sn (n = 1–3 and 5–7) electronic transitions calculated to be between 521 and 389 nm (Table S1 and Fig. S3, ESI†), and this gives rise to the experimentally observed broad band centred around 400 nm. These electronic transitions mainly involve one-electron promotions from the HOMO−2, HOMO−1 and HOMO to the LUMO and LUMO+1. They are π → π* in nature and imply both the excitation of the CoTh core and charge transfer from the peripheral TPA units to the central CoTh moiety (Table S1 and Fig. S4, ESI†). The highest-energy band predicted at 302 nm is associated with the narrower experimentally obtained band at 290 nm and shows a complex multiconfigurational nature with the predominance of the S0 → S36 and S38 electronic transitions (Fig. S3, ESI†).
Electrochemical properties and reorganization energies
The electrochemical properties of CoTh-TTPA were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in a TBAPF6/CH2Cl2 solution at room temperature, at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1, as illustrated in Fig. 3b. The corresponding redox potentials of CoTh-TTPA are listed in Table 1. In good accord with the theoretical MO energies discussed above (Fig. 2), CoTh-TTPA shows a weaker donor ability, in comparison to spiro-OMeTAD, with a reversible oxidation wave at a half-wave potential (E1/2) of 0.91 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode (NHE). Hence, the HOMO energy level of the CoTh-TTPA can be estimated at around −5.35 eV, while the HOMO energy of the spiro-OMeTAD is upshifted to −5.16 eV. The energy difference of 0.19 eV is in perfect agreement with that predicted theoretically (0.18 eV, Fig. 2). Therefore, the CoTh-TTPA HTM possesses a suitable band alignment with the valence band edge of the perovskite (ca. −5.65 eV), which may lead to efficient injection of the photogenerated holes from the perovskite to the HTM.
To gain a better understanding of the oxidation processes, the oxidized species (up to the tetracation) of CoTh-TTPA were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level in CH2Cl2. Table S2 (ESI†) shows the charges accumulated by the constituent fragments (central core and TPA units) as oxidation takes place. In line with the topology of the HOMO (Fig. 2), the charge for the radical cation species is drawn from the core (ca. 0.28e) and the TPA units (0.18e from each unit). Upon further oxidation (dication, trication and tetracations), the charge is steadily extracted from the four TPA units. They hold a similar charge of ca. +1.0e for the tetracation and the core loses the excess of electron density found in the neutral state (Table S2, ESI†). It should be stressed that for CoTh-TTPA, the ionization energies (IEs) required to go from the neutral molecule to the cation (IE1), from the cation to the dication (IE2), from the dication to the trication (IE3) and from the trication to the tetracation (IE4) are computed to have comparatively close values (4.51, 4.76, 5.01 and 5.05 eV, respectively); the largest difference was found between IE1 and IE2 (0.25 eV). The closeness of the IEs explains the electrochemical behavior found for CoTh-TTPA exhibiting a broad four-electron oxidation wave (Fig. 3b).
To evaluate the capability of the CoTh-TTPA system as a HTM material, hole reorganization energies (λ) were estimated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level in the gas phase (see the ESI,† for full computational details). The λ value calculated for CoTh-TTPA is 0.188 eV, which is notably smaller than the values obtained for its constituent fragments (0.468 and 0.274 eV for CoTh and TPA, respectively). The decrease in λ results from the fact that charge extraction involves both the core and the terminal TPA moieties. Although CoTh-TTPA exhibits a low reorganization energy, the predicted value is larger than that computed for spiro-OMeTAD (0.139 eV).28 This may be one of the reasons why CoTh-TTPA shows lower PCE values when used as the HTM in PSCs, compared to the archetype spiro-OMeTAD (vide infra), despite it presenting an appropriate energy level alignment with the valence band edge of the perovskite.
Thermal properties
To ascertain the thermal properties of CoTh-TTPA, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were performed (Fig. 3c and d). CoTh-TTPA exhibits good thermal stability and decomposes above 400 °C. The morphological stability of the amorphous HTM film upon heating is determined by the glass transition temperature (Tg). The DSC provides further evidence of the thermal behaviour of CoTh-TTPA. After consecutive heating/cooling cycles, only a Tg value of 186 °C was observed, which confirms the amorphous nature and reduced crystallization tendency of CoTh-TTPA. In contrast, spiro-OMeTAD can exist in both the crystalline and amorphous states, with a Tg of 125 °C.
Photovoltaic characterization
The new small-molecule CoTh-TTPA was tested as the HTM in mesoscopic solution-processed PSC devices. The energy-level diagram of CoTh-TTPA is depicted in Fig. 4a, showing the reasonable matching between the HOMO energy and the valence band edge of the mixed cation-mixed anion perovskite and also with the triple cation perovskite. This provides sufficient driving force for an efficient hole injection from the perovskite to the HTM. The different layers constituting the PSC device can be seen from the schematic illustration and the cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image displayed in Fig. 4b and c. Devices were fabricated from a stack of thin films onto the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass with the following device configuration FTO/c-TiO2 (30 nm)/mp-TiO2 (200 nm)/[FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15 (600 nm) or [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08/HTM/Au (80 nm) as described in detail in the ESI.†

(e) Conductivity of CoTh-TTPA and spiro-OMeTAD measured on substrates having interdigitated gold electrodes with a channel length of 2.5 mm. 
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics obtained from the best-performing device are illustrated in Fig. 4d under 1 sun AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) simulated sunlight, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2. [FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15-based devices employing doped CoTh-TTPA afford a maximum PCE of 16.3% with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 20.6 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 78.3% and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.01 V with little hysteresis (Fig. S6, ESI†). As a reference, doped spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs reach a PCE of 18.8% with a Jsc of 22.35 mA cm−2, a FF of 77.3% and a Voc of 1.09 V with little hysteresis (Fig. S7, ESI†). The performance of the spiro-OMeTAD can be significantly increased by changing the perovskite to [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08. The champion-device displays a PCE of 19.94% with a Jsc of 23.3 mA cm−2, a FF of 76.5% and a Voc of 1.12 V with little hysteresis (Fig. S8, ESI†). Conversely, CoTh-TTPA-based devices with [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08 exhibit lower efficiency than those using the mixed cation-mixed anion perovskite. The devices afford a maximum PCE of 15.88% with a Jsc of 22.3 mA cm−2, a FF of 68.5% and a Voc of 1.01 V, with noticeable hysteresis (Fig. S9, ESI†). The small difference in the performances is probably due to the homogeneity of the HTM film deposited on top of the perovskite layer, and the hysteresis can be due to the accumulation of charges at the perovskite/HTM interface. The SEM images of the surfaces show that the HTM thin film was indeed more uniform and smoother with the double cation perovskite than when deposited on the triple cation perovskite (Fig. S10, ESI†). This results in a significant difference in the FF, which is higher in the case of the double cation-based perovskite and leads to a better PCE using this perovskite. The integrated current densities from the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) are in good agreement, within 5%, with those obtained from the J–V measurements (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†).

To gain more insight into the charge extraction processes at the perovskite/HTM interface, the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) was recorded (Fig. S14, ESI†). The pristine perovskite film shows a strong PL signal, which stems from the radiative recombination of the photogenerated charge carriers. After deposition of the HTM on top of the perovskite, the intensity of the PL signal is significantly reduced. This quenching is caused by the efficient extraction of the photogenerated charge carriers and is remarkably enhanced for the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD. Compared to spiro-OMeTAD, the CoTh-TTPA exhibits a smaller quenching, which suggests a less efficient hole extraction from the perovskite that is significantly improved in the case of the triple cation perovskite (Fig. S14, ESI†). The lower hole extraction ability of the CoTh-TTPA is ascribed to its poorer electron-donating character, compared to spiro-OMeTAD. This can be related to the saddle-like structure of CoTh-TTPA that breaks the π-conjugation across the polycyclic core.
To further investigate the lower efficiency observed for CoTh-TTPA, we measured the conductivity of the HTM on organic field-effect transistor (OFET) substrates (Fig. 4e). The same concentration used for the device preparation was applied by adding 6% of FK-209 as dopant for both CoTh-TTPA and spiro-OMeTAD. The conductivity of spiro-OMeTAD (4.03 × 10−4 S cm−1) is one order of magnitude higher than the conductivity of COTh-TTPA (2.0.1 × 10−5 S cm−1), which further confirms the lower efficiency of the latter.
Conclusions
In summary, we designed, synthesized and characterized a new saddle-like hole-transporting material based on a cyclooctatetrathiophene central core, which is further endowed with p-methoxytriphenylamines (CoTh-TTPA). The CoTh-TTPA exhibits a much deeper HOMO energy level along with a higher glass transition temperature than the state-of-the-art spiro-OMeTAD. The quenching of the photogenerated charge carriers occurred more efficiently at the interface between the spiro-OMeTAD and the perovskite when compared to the CoTh-TTPA/perovskite interface. Furthermore, thin-film transistors based on spiro-OMeTAD demonstrated an order of magnitude higher conductivity than devices based on CoTh-TTPA. The novel compound was employed as the HTM in PSCs using two different perovskites, [FAPbI3]0.85[MAPbBr3]0.15 and the state-of-the-art triple cation [(FAPbI3)0.87(MAPbBr3)0.13]0.92[CsPbI3]0.08 perovskite. Power conversion efficiencies of up to 16.3% were obtained for CoTh-TTPA, which were lower than those of the spiro-OMeTAD based devices. The lower performance of CoTh-TTPA could be ascribed to its higher reorganization energy and lower conductivity along with its poorer hole extraction ability.
