Using first-principles calculations, we explored the atomic and electronic structures of 2D pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides and found the internal vertical electric field at Janus group-IV monochalcogenides. Then, we constructed vdW heterostructures with pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides monolayers as building blocks and explored their atomic structures and band alignments. Our results demonstrate that these vdW heterostructures can be synthesized experimentally, and the surface termination of the Janus monolayer at the interface can significantly help the heterostructure realize the transition from type I to type II due to the intrinsic electric field. Moreover, we found eight vdW heterostructures with a mismatch of less than 5% exhibiting type II band alignment with charge densities of VBM and CBM mainly localized at different domains of heterostructures, and excellent power conversion efficiency (∼19%) in photovoltaics are also predicted for these heterostructures with type II band alignment. Our results not only give an idea to use the Janus monolayer as building blocks to construct vdW heterostructures and modulate their band alignment but also provide a guide to the experimental researcher to design more efficient photovoltaic devices with Janus group-IV monochalcogenides.
1. Introduction
Solar photovoltaics (PVs) is a practical and sustainable method to resolve energy demand, and the type II band alignment heterostructures are expected in highly efficient PVs, which can help the excited electron–hole pair separate and transfer into the opposite directions of the heterostructure.1,2 The dangling-bond-free surface of 2D materials enables them to integrate through weak van der Waals (vdW) interactions and construct vdW heterostructures. The weak interactions and unique atomic configurations of vdW heterostructures provide various strategies to modulate their properties by selecting the 2D materials,3,4 tailing their stacking angles5–7 or layer distance,8,9etc. The vdW heterostructures not only freshen the conception of the heterojunction but also promise 2D materials more chances in the next-generation high-performance devices.10–14
Much attention has been paid to vdW heterostructures based on 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Theoretical calculations predicted the type II band alignment in these heterostructures through first-principles calculations15–19 and several experimental groups also confirmed the band alignment. Li et al. determined the type II alignment between MoS2 and WSe2 by microbeam X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy.20 Heinz et al. reported that the type II band alignment of heterostructures is composed of MoS2 and WS2 monolayers through the analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy and scanning tunneling spectroscopy.21 Moreover, ultrafast carrier interface transfer at TMD vdW heterostructures is revealed. Wang et al. observed that holes can overcome the large exciton binding energy and transfer from the MoS2 to WS2 layer in 50 fs by employing both femtosecond pump–probe and photoluminescence mapping spectroscopy. Several groups also simulated the dynamics of holes at the MoS2/WS2 vdW heterostructure using time-dependent density functional theory molecular dynamics calculation and demonstrated the contribution of interface dipoles on the ultrafast carrier transfer at vdW heterostructures.22–24 The Type II band alignment and such ultrafast charge transfer in vdW heterostructures can promise their possible applications in PVs. Tsai et al. explored the PV properties of sequentially grown alloy-free 2D monolayer WSe2/MoS2 p-n heterojunctions, which can realize omnidirectional light harvesting capability with an efficiency of 95%.25 Wong et al. reported their experimental measurements on WSe2/MoS2 heterojunctions, which showed external quantum efficiencies exceeding 50% and experimental absorbance exceeding 90%.26 Gong et al. grew TMD heterostructures of size larger than 169 μm through a two-step chemical vapor deposition, and the strong photocurrent response and photovoltaic effect with a high quantum efficiency of the heterostructures have been detected.27 In addition to vdW heterostructures based on 2D TMD, various 2D heterostructures have been reported with type II band alignment, such as heterostructure based on group-III monochalcogenides,2,28,29 group-IV monochalcogenides,30,31 and phosphorene.32–34 Excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been reported in InS/InSe2, Mo2SeTe/W2STe,35 and phosphorene/MoS234 heterostructures.
The 2D vdW heterostructures promise potential applications of 2D materials in optoelectronics. Moreover, it is acceptable to integrate 2D materials with very different lattice constants due to the weak vdW interaction at the interface. Recently, 2D Janus materials with vertical asymmetry have attracted much attention and excellent properties have been demonstrated at these 2D Janus structures, such as tunable band gap,36,37 giant Rashba-type splitting,38–42 large piezoelectric coefficients,19,39,43–47 high carrier mobility44 and sizable magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy.48 These materials also find their potential applications in photovoltaics,35,46,49,50 and photocatalytic water splitting.51,52 To date, the Janus MoSSe can be synthesized successfully through the synthesis of monolayer MoS2 or MoSe2 followed by replacing the top S or Se atoms in experiments.53,54 The monolayer group-IV monochalcogenides with phosphorene-like structures are a family of 2D materials and show excellent photo-response and short photo-response time with the band gap of 1.44–2.32 eV matching the ideal energy for the maximum absorption of incident solar radiations.55–60 Besides, these materials show superior oxidation resistance as compared to phosphorene.61 Here, we used pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides as building blocks to construct heterostructures and explored their electronic structures and possible application in photovoltaics. Firstly, we investigated the atomic structure, electronic structure, and optical absorption spectra of pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides monolayers, and revealed the existence of an intrinsic internal electric field at the Janus monolayer. Secondly, we investigated the mismatch and band alignment of 32 possible heterostructures using vacuum energy levels as references. Furthermore, we discussed how the intrinsic electric field at the Janus monolayer affects the band alignment by constructing vdW heterostructures and exploring their electronic structures, and confirmed the band alignment transition from type I into type II by tuning the surface termination of the Janus monolayer at the interface. Finally, we constructed the vdW heterostructure with type II band alignment and mismatch of less than 5% and investigated their electronic structures and excellent PCE in PV applications. Our results give an idea to use Janus monolayer as building blocks to construct vdW heterostructures and modulate their band alignment, and provide a guide to design more highly efficient PVs.
2. Computational method
All first-principles calculations were conducted using the Vienna Ab initio simulation package (VASP) based on DFT with a plane-wave basis set.62 To treat the exchange–correlation interaction of electrons, we chose the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) functional63 within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). The electron–ion interactions were described by the projector augmented wave (PAW) potentials.64 The energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis was chosen as 550 eV, and the Brillouin zones (BZ) were sampled by k grids with a uniform spacing of 2π × 0.02 Å−1. A convergence criterion of 10−6 eV for total energy and 0.01 eV Å−1 for force was adopted for self-consistent calculations and geometry optimization, respectively. Grimme's semi-empirical DFT-D3 method was adopted to describe the long-range vdW interactions.65 To avoid the interaction between adjacent layers, a vacuum spacing of 15 Å was added along the direction perpendicular to the 2D surface. Based on the equilibrium structures from PBE calculations, a Heyd–Scuseri–Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional66 was used to obtain more accurate band structure, densities of states (DOS), and optical absorption spectra for pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides. More accurate band structures of vdW heterostructures were also calculated with the HSE06 hybrid functional. Phonon dispersion analysis was performed to confirm the dynamical stability of the Janus monolayers with a 5 × 5 × 1 supercell and k-point sampling 2 × 2 × 1, using the Phonopy code based-on density functional perturbation theory as implemented in VASP.67 Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD) simulations with the PBE functional were conducted to assess the thermal stability of Janus monolayers with a 5 × 5 × 1 supercell and the single Γ k-point. Each BOMD simulation in NVT ensemble lasted for 10 ps with a time step of 1 fs, and the temperature was controlled using the Nosé–Hoover method.68
3. Results and discussion
We first investigated the atomic structures of pristine group-IV monochalcogenides, including GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe. The atomic structures of pristine group-IV monochalcogenides are shown in Fig. 1(a). All pristine monolayers have phosphorene-like structures, and there are two group-IV elements and two group-VI elements in a unit cell as identified by the red dashed rectangle in Fig. 1(a). The lattice constants of the pristine monolayer are listed in Table 1. In order to obtain the Janus structures, we replaced one group-IV element or group-VI element in a unit cell, as shown in Fig. 1(b and c). Totally, we obtained four Janus structures, Ge2SSe, Sn2SSe, GeSnS2, and GeSnSe2. After full optimization of lattice and atom, all the Janus monolayers still maintained their phosphorene-like structures. To demonstrate the energy stability of these four Janus monolayers, we calculated the formation energy ΔH, which is defined as: (1)where Etot is the total energy of the group-IV monochalcogenide unit cell, Ni is the atomic number of the ith element in group-IV monochalcogenide, and Ei is the energy of per atom in a solid consisting of the ith element. As listed in Table 1, the calculated ΔH are −0.32, −0.28, −0.43, and −0.40 eV per atom for pristine GeS, GeSe, SnS, and SnSe, respectively, and the calculated ΔH is −0.36, −0.33, −0.29, and −0.41 eV per atom for Janus GeSnS2, GeSnSe2, Ge2SSe, and Sn2SSe, respectively, which are similar with those of the synthesized materials, such as layer InSe (−0.52 eV per atom). The lattice dynamical stability of four Janus monolayers is ascertained by calculating the phonon dispersion, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Except for the minimum imaginary frequency (less than 0.015 THz) near the Γ point, no obvious imaginary frequency was observed. These small imaginary frequencies near the Γ point for 2D materials are sensitive to simulation parameters, such as supercell size and k-point sampling, and some stable 2D materials have been revealed with these small imaginary frequencies near the Γ point.69 To further confirm the mechanical stability of four Janus monolayers, we calculated their elastic constants (as listed in Table S1, ESI†), and all these values comply with Born-Huang criteria (C11, C22, C44 > 0 and C11C12 − C222 > 0),70–72 demonstrating that four Janus group-IV monochalcogenides are mechanically stable. The thermal stability of all Janus group-IV monochalcogenides was confirmed through the Born–Oppenheimer MD simulation. It can be seen from the results that the total energy oscillates around a fixed value in Fig. 1(d) and the temperature oscillates around 300K in Fig. S2 (ESI†), demonstrating that the atoms only vibrate around their equilibrium positions during the 10 ps, and all four Janus structures are thermally stable at room temperature.

The mirror asymmetric structure of Janus group-IV monochalcogenides results in charge inhomogeneous distribution, which produces an internal electric field and leads to a potential energy shift at two vacuums of the Janus monolayer, as shown in Fig. 1(d and e). In detail, both the charge quantity at each element and the length of bonds connecting the group-IV element and group-VI element, which are identified by red arrows in Fig. 1(a–c), work for the charge inhomogeneous distribution. Taking Ge2SSe as an example, the length of the Ge–S bond and Ge–Se bond are 2.41 Å and 2.56 Å, respectively, and the number of electrons at S and Se are −0.17 and −0.13, respectively, as listed in Table 1, which totally result in a vertical dipole moment of about 3.12me Å. The vertical dipole moment, potential energy shift, and vacuum with the higher potential energy of all the Janus structures are listed in Table 1. GeSnS2 shows the largest dipole moment and potential energy shift, and Ge2SSe shows the smallest dipole moment and potential energy shift. The –Se terminated surface of Ge2SSe and Sn2SSe show higher vacuum potential energy and the –Ge terminated surface of GeSnS2 and GeSnSe2 show higher vacuum potential energy.
The band structures and PDOS of the four pristine group-IV monochalcogenides are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), and corresponding electronic structure information is summarized in Table 1. The band gaps are in the range of 0.92–1.75 eV at PBE functional calculations, and the band gaps move into the range of 1.40–2.43 eV at the HSE06 functional calculations. The GeS, SnS, and SnSe belong to the indirect semiconductors, and GeSe is a direct semiconductor. The valence band maximum (VBM) of all the pristine monolayers is located between Y and Γ, and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the indirect cases is located between X and Γ. From PDOS, the conduction band (CB) of the pristine monolayer is mainly contributed by the p orbital of Ge or Sn and partially contributed by the p orbitals of S or Se. It is noticed that the pz orbital of Ge or Sn plays a significant role in the CBM of pristine structures. The valence band (VB) of the pristine monolayer is mainly contributed by the p orbital of S or Se and partially contributed by s, px, and py orbitals of Ge or Sn. The band structures and PDOS of the four Janus group-IV monochalcogenides are shown in Fig. 2, and corresponding electronic structure information is summarized in Table 1. The band gaps of four Janus structures are in the range of 1.01–1.44 eV at PBE functional calculations, and the band gap moves into the range of 1.49–1.93 eV at HSE06 functional calculations. All four Janus monolayers are indirect semiconductors with VBM located between Y and Γ, and CBM located between X and Γ. From PDOS shown in Fig. 2, the CB of the Janus monolayer is mainly contributed by the p orbital of Ge or Sn and partially contributed by the p orbitals of the S or Se, and the VB is mainly contributed by the p orbital of S or Se, and partially contributed by s, px, and py orbitals of Ge or Sn, which are similar with that of the pristine structures. The pz orbital of Ge or Sn still plays a significant role in the CBM in Ge2SSe and Sn2SSe, respectively. However, the CBM of GeSnS2 and GeSnSe2 is mainly contributed by pz orbital from Sn, and the contribution from pz from Ge is greatly weakened, which is because the energy level at the Ge side is greatly pulled up due to the intrinsic internal electric field. We also noticed that in the cases of Ge2SSe and Sn2SSe the CBM is mainly contributed by the px and py orbitals of Se, and the contribution from px and py of S is also weakened. There are two possible reasons: one is that Se has more valence electrons than S and the occupied energy level of Se is higher than S, and the other one is that the energy level at the S side is pulled down by the intrinsic electric field at the Janus structures.

Optical absorption is a significant parameter for PVs, and the interlayer excitons are relatively difficult for most vdW heterostructures compared with intralayer excitons. Thus, we further explored the optical absorption spectra of absolute pristine and the Janus group-IV monochalcogenides monolayer by calculating the complex dielectric functions based on the HSE06 hybrid functional, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Obvious optical absorption happens at the band gap, and there is no obvious excitonic peak. The careful analysis demonstrates that the first peak in the optical absorbance arises mainly from the direct transition from the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band at the K points between Γ and Y for most pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides, except that in the GeS case, the first peak is from the transition between the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band at the Γ points. With suitable band gaps, both pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides exhibit obvious optical absorption in their visible spectra, with an absorption coefficient of up to the order of 105 cm−1, which is comparable with that of the bulk MoS2.73
Then, we used pristine group IV monochalcogenides as one domain and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides as the other domain to construct vdW heterostructures. Due to two different surface terminations of the Janus monolayer, we totally obtained 16 couples and 32 heterostructures. For the convenience of discussion, we name the heterostructures in the form of A/B-M, where A is the pristine semiconductor, B is the Janus semiconductor, and M is the terminated atoms of the Janus monolayer at the interface or the contacting region. The mismatch of 32 heterostructures is listed in Table S2 (ESI†), and the mismatch is defined as: (2)where apri and aJan are the lattice constant along the zig–zag or arm-chair directions of the pristine and Janus monolayers, respectively. As listed in Table S2 (ESI†), there are 18 heterostructures showing a mismatch of less than 5% along both the zig-zag and aim-chair directions.
Band alignment is an important parameter at the heterojunction, which determines how the excited carriers transfer at the interface. Usually, the type I band alignment will help both electrons and holes transfer into the semiconductor with a narrow band gap, and the type II band alignment will drive electrons and holes into different semiconductors. With the vacuum potential energy level as a reference, we calculated the band edge position of the pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides using the HSE06 hybrid functional, as shown in Fig. 3(a). Owing to the intrinsic internal electric field of the Janus monolayer, the two surfaces of the Janus monolayer show different band edges. By aligning the vacuum potential energy, we compared the band edge of the pristine and Janus structures and got the band alignment at the Ander limit, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The band alignment of some combinations is strongly dependent on the surface termination. For example, when GeSnSe2 contact SnS with the –Ge terminated surface, the type II band alignment is found. However, when GeSnSe2 contact SnS with the –Sn terminated surface, the type I band alignment will be found.

(b) Band alignment between pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides. The red circle and blue rectangle indict type II and type I band alignment, respectively. The circle and rectangle filled with colors are heterostructures with a mismatch of less than 5% along both zig-zag and arm-chair directions. The light green background parts denote Janus monolayer contacting pristine monolayer with the surface of higher vacuum potential energy, and the light gray background denotes Janus monolayer contacting pristine monolayer with the surface of lower vacuum potential energy. 
Among 16 couples of heterostructures, there are 6 couples showing different band alignments at the Anderson limit due to the surface termination of the Janus monolayer at the interface. We chose one couple with the smallest mismatch, as an example, to explore the electronic structures of vdW heterostructures, that is, SnS/GeSnSe2–Ge and SnS/GeSnSe2–Sn. For these two vdW heterostructures, 8 staking configurations were considered, as shown in Fig. 4. The binding energy for different staking configurations was calculated with the DFT+D3 method, and the binding energy is defined as: (3)where Etotal, Epri, and EJan are the total energy of vdW heterostructure, pristine and Janus monolayer, respectively, and A is the cross area of vdW heterostructures. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), the AB-I stacking and AA-II stacking show very similar binding energy, and careful atomic position comparison demonstrate that the AA-II stacking switches into AB-I staking after full atomic optimization. Actually, the pristine bulk group-IV monochalcogenides prefer to stack with the AB-I configuration at the low-temperature phase with the Pnma space group.74,75 The binding energy (about −0.13 eV Å−2) between two domains, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), describes the vdW interaction at these two heterostructures, and the negative value also demonstrates that these heterostructures can be synthesized experimentally. Based on the AB-I stacking configuration, we explored the projected electronic band structures for SnS/GeSnSe2–Ge and SnS/GeSnSe2–Sn, which are shown in Fig. 5(a) and (c), respectively. It can be seen that the VBM and CBM of SnS/GeSnSe2–Ge are mainly dominated by SnS and GeSnSe2, respectively, confirming the type II band alignment at SnS/GeSnSe2–Ge. While at SnS/GeSnSe2–Sn, both VBM and CBM are mainly dominated by GeSnSe2, which further demonstrates the type I band alignment at SnS/GeSnSe2–Sn. The conduction band offset (CBO) and the valence band offset (VBO) can be calculated by directly comparing the lowest conduction bands or the highest valence band occupied by pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides with the largest weight at the projected band structures. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (c), the SnS/GeSnSe2–Ge shows positive CBO and VBO, and the SnS/GeSnSe2–Sn exhibits positive CBO and negative VBO. The band alignment was also confirmed by the partial charge density of VBM and CBM, as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (d). From the electronic structures of SnS/GeSnSe2–Ge and SnS/GeSnSe2–Sn vdW heterostructure, we can conclude that the intrinsic internal electric field of the Janus monolayer can significantly realize the band alignment transition from type I into type II by tuning the termination of the Janus monolayer.

For a systematic study about vdW dispersion correction, we also optimized all vdW heterostructures with different eight stacking configurations with DFT-D276 and DFT-TS77 vdW dispersion correction and compared their binding energy with those calculated with DFT-D3 vdW dispersion correction, as seen in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It can be seen that the AB-I stacking configuration shows the largest binding energy for each vdW heterostructure, which is independent of the vdW dispersion correction. Based on the most stable AB-I stacking configuration, we summarized their average vertical distance (Dz) between pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides, and calculated their binding energy (Eb) and band gap (Eg) for all vdW heterostructures with different vdW dispersion correction, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Careful analysis demonstrates that the difference of binding energy and average vertical distance between different vdW dispersion corrections at all vdW heterostructures are less than 1 meV Å−2 and 0.2 Å, respectively. The band gap difference caused by different vdW dispersion correction at all vdW heterostructures is less than 0.09 eV, which are comparable with the smallest conduction band offset and the valence band offset. Overall, we can see that the vdW dispersion correction does not change the atomic structures and main results.
The type II band alignment can naturally drive the excited electrons and holes to transfer along the opposite directions at heterostructures, help electron-hole pairs to separate, and prolong the lifetime of carriers, which are expected in PVs. Among these heterostructures with a smaller mismatch, as listed in Table S2 (ESI†), there are also 7 heterostructures belonging to type II band alignment except for SnS/GeSnSe2–Ge, including GeSe/GeSnS2–Ge, GeSe/GeSnSe2–Ge, GeSe/GeSnSe2–Sn, GeSe/Sn2SSe–S, GeSe/Sn2SSe–Se, SnS/GeSnS2–Ge, and SnSe/GeSnSe2–Ge. In order to investigate the electronic structures and band alignment after stacking, we also constructed these 7 vdW heterostructures. These 7 vdW heterostructures also prefer the AB-I stacking configuration, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The projected electronic band structures and partial charge densities of VBM and CBM of these heterostructures are shown in Fig. 6(a, b) and Fig. S7 (ESI†). It can be seen that the type II band alignment maintains after stacking at these heterostructures. The partial charge densities of VBM and CBM are mainly localized at different domains. For those heterostructures with type II band alignment, we further estimated their PCE following Scharber's method,78 in which the upper limit of PCE in the limit of 100% external quantum efficiency can be expressed as follows. (4)here, the band-fill factor deduced from the Shockley–Queasier limit is assumed to be 0.65. P(ℏϖ) is the AM 1.5 solar energy flux (in the unit of W m2 eV−1) at the photon energy of ℏϖ. The maximum open circuit voltage VOC is estimated by the effective interface gap minus 0.3 eV to account for the energy conversion kinetics. Both the optical band gap of the donor (Eg) and CBO at the Anderson Limit (ΔEc) come from our HSE06 calculations. Fig. 6(c) and Table S2 (ESI†) show the PCE for all type II heterostructures. The PCE of three heterostructures exceed 19%, that is, the PCE of GeSe/GeSnSe2–Sn, GeSe/Sn2SSe–S, and GeSe/Sn2SSe–Se are 20.86%, 19.19%, and 19.81%, respectively, which are higher than those of the dye-sensitive (∼12%) and organic (∼14%) solar cells,79 and comparable with the PCE of the thin-film solar cell with a single-junction79 and the theoretical values for bilayer phosphorene/MoS234 and heterostructures based-on Janus TMD.35 Also, note that the PCE is also sensitive to absorption spectra and collection efficiency, which is not considered in our present simulation. Thus, the predicted high PCE in these heterostructures still needs to be confirmed by future experiments.
 Fig. 6  (a) Projected electronic band structures of GeSe/Sn2SSe-S calculated with HSE06 functional. The blue and orange plots indict the contribution from GeSe and Sn2SSe, respectively, and the width is proportional to the weight. The upper number is the CBO, and the lower number is the VBO. (b) The partial charge density of VBM (lower) and CBM (upper) of GeSe/Sn2SSe-S. The isosurface value is 0.004 e/Born3. (c) Contour plot of power conversion efficiency (%) as a function of donor domain band gap and CBO. Constant efficiency level curves up to 20% are shown on the right side. The black points denote the PCE of 8 heterostructures with type II band alignment. 
4. Conclusions
In summary, we explored the atomic and electronic structures of 2D pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides using the first-principles calculations and revealed the existence of a vertical intrinsic internal electric field at the Janus group-IV monochalcogenides. With 2D pristine and Janus group-IV monochalcogenides as building blocks, we constructed the vdW heterostructure and investigated their atomic structures and band alignment. All the vdW heterostructures prefer to stack with the AB-I stacking configuration, and the negative binding energy demonstrates these vdW heterostructures can be synthesized in the experiment. Moreover, the surface termination of the Janus monolayer at the interface can significantly modulate the band alignment of the heterostructure due to the intrinsic vertical electric field and can help the heterostructure realize the transition from type I into type II. We found eight vdW heterostructures with a mismatch of less than 5% exhibiting type II band alignment with the partial charge density of VBM and CBM mainly localized at different domains of heterostructures, and excellent PCE (∼19%) in photovoltaics at these type II band alignments are revealed. Our results provide an idea to use the Janus monolayer as a building block to construct the vdW heterostructure and modulate their band alignments.
