    , Accepted 11th October 2019First published on 15th October 2019AbstractGrowing efforts have been devoted to developing polymer acceptors as alternatives to fullerene derivatives to realize durable and high-performance all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs). In retrospect, the non-ideal morphology is thought to be one of the key constraints, which significantly limits the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of all-PSCs (<15 mA cm−2). Motivated by the recent copolymerization and fluorination concepts, we herein synthesize three new acceptor polymers by incorporating a fraction of fluorinated thiophenes onto the naphthalene diimide (NDI)-bithiophene backbones. On the basis of enough energy offsets and optimal blend morphology, the fluorinated acceptor polymers can also increase the dielectric constants, all of which synergistically improve the exciton dissociation in the active layers. As a result, the all-PSCs attain high and stable PCEs of 8.0%. The outstanding Jsc of 15.08 mA cm−2 is one of the highest values achieved by the all-PSCs, specifically for those based on fluorinated acceptor polymers. The performance of the all-PSCs also exhibits good tolerance in a wide range of active areas and active layer thickness. In addition to the high-performance all-PSCs based on a rigid substrate, flexible all-PSCs are realized with encouraging PCEs approaching 6.0%, which exhibits one of the best performances among the state-of-the-art flexible all-PSCs. This work paves an avenue for developing high-performance acceptor polymers via copolymerization and fluorination concepts and discloses the potential of the all-PSCs for robust and mass production.
1. Introduction
As a crucial research field of the emerging fullerene-free organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs), employing a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photoactive layer composed of an electron-donor polymer (D) and an electron-acceptor polymer (A) or even a third polymeric component, have drawn tremendous attention in the last five years.1–7 The use of acceptor polymers has been demonstrated to overcome some intrinsic drawbacks of fullerene acceptors.8 The modulations on the chemical structures of both the donor and acceptor polymers enable the realization of complementary absorption spectra to improve the photocurrent, appropriate energy levels to maximize the photovoltage as well as the robust mechanical and thermodynamic stability of all-PSCs. Tremendous efforts have boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all-PSCs from 3% to 11% within the past five years.9–19 In retrospect, naphthalene diimide (NDI) is a notable building block for acceptor polymers due to the suitable electron affinity, high electron mobility and cost-effective synthetic routes.20–22 Nevertheless, the acceptor polymers containing the planar and rigid NDI arenes usually suffer from a strong tendency to aggregate and a large twisting angle between two adjacent units, leading to excessively large domains and inefficient exciton dissociation in the blend films. So far, only a few NDI-based all-PSCs have reached PCEs as high as 8%.11–13,15,18,23,24 Compared with the polymer:fullerene solar cells or the fullerene-free solar cells based on small-molecular acceptors, a low fill factor (FF) (<0.70) and short-circuit current (Jsc) (<15 mA cm−2) are thought to be the two limiting factors for the performance of all-PSCs.8
To overcome the constraints, a copolymerization strategy was first performed on alternating poly[[N,N′bis(2-hexyldecyl)naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)] with the commercial name N2200. By introducing a fraction of thiophene units or oligoethylene oxide side chains on the backbones, the random acceptor polymers offered reduced crystallinity, better solubility, improved nanophase separation as well as vertical phase gradation.23,25 The improved FF of over 0.7 broke through one of the key factors that limited PCEs for a long time. As a result, high PCEs of 7.6–8.1% were recorded in these all-PSCs. To improve another critical parameter, Jsc, a fluorination strategy was also conducted to develop new acceptor polymers.26 Previously, intensive studies have been devoted to exploring the fluorination effects on donor polymers. Several intriguing properties have been demonstrated such as lowering the energy levels of the frontier molecular orbitals and enlarging the planarity of the polymer backbones.27 Except for fluorination on donor polymers, a recent report has evidenced that the fluorinated acceptor polymers can increase the relative dielectric constants (εr) of the active layers.28 Higher εr tended to reduce the binding energy (ECTB) of the excitons.29 As a result, the improved exciton dissociation and suppressed geminate recombination synergistically boosted the Jsc to 14.7 mA cm−2 and PCE to 7.3% of the all-PSCs.
Motivated by the aforementioned design, three new acceptor polymers were synthesized to combine the copolymerization and fluorination strategies in this work (Fig. 1a). Small amounts of fluorinated thiophene units were introduced into the NDI-bithiophene backbones to afford the random polymers PNDI-TF5, PNDI-TF10 and PNDI-TF15, where the loading percentages were 5%, 10% and 15% relative to the total donor units, respectively. A systematic characterization was conducted to elaborate the absorption, energy levels, power generation, film morphology, exciton dissociation, charge transport and recombination properties of the polymer:polymer systems. Among the three all-PSCs, the PNDI-TF5-based all-PSC attained the highest PCE of 8.0% and an outstanding Jsc of 15.08 mA cm−2, which is among the best-performing all-PSCs based on the fluorinated acceptor polymers. By varying the active areas (0.07–0.97 cm2) and active layer thicknesses (90–340 nm), the PNDI-TF5-based all-PSC disclosed an encouraging performance with good tolerance on large-areas or thick active layers. In addition to the all-PSCs based on a glass substrate, flexible all-PSCs based on PNDI-TF5 were realized with good PCEs approaching 6%.

2. Results and discussion
2.1. Material structures, absorption and energy levels

Fig. 1b depicts the chemical structures of the donor and acceptor polymers. The donor poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PBDB-T) is a medium-bandgap polymer, which shows good performance in fullerene- and fullerene-free solar cells.30,31 The random acceptor polymers PNDI-TF5, PNDI-TF10 and PNDI-TF15 were prepared by polymerizing three monomers 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)-3,4-difluorothiophene (TF), 5,5′-bis(trimethylstannyl)-2,2'-bithiophene (2T) and 2,6-dibromonaphthalene-1,4,5,8-tetracarboxylic-N,N′-bis(2-octyldodecyl)diimide (NDIBr2) via Stille coupling reactions. The number on the polymer names corresponds to the percentage of the TF units (5%, 10% and 15%) relative to the total donor units. Molecular weights were measured via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with warm 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene (150 °C) as the eluent. N2200 gave a number-average molecular weight (Mn) of 60.4 kDa. More loading of the TF units gradually increased the Mn and polydispersity indexes (PDI) of the acceptor polymers (Table S1, ESI†). The higher Mn possibly originated from the more disordered backbones and better solubility. Similar variations of Mn and PDI were verified with the previous reports.25,28 As indicated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), the three polymers exhibited good thermal stability with onset of the decomposition temperature over 400 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†).
Absorption spectra of the neat polymers and the blend films were measured via UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectroscopy. All the polymers showed red-shifted absorption spectra in the neat films as compared with the corresponding solutions due to the enhanced π–π stacking and intermolecular interactions (Fig. 2a and Fig. S3a, ESI†). The acceptor polymers featured two distinct absorption bands at 350–450 nm and 450–900 nm, which corresponded to the excitations with the π–π* manifolds and the transitions with local (NDI) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) characteristics, respectively.25 Introducing more TF units into the random polymers slightly blue-shifted the absorption and lowered the absorption coefficients. For instance, the neat N2200 film showed a maximal absorption coefficient of 4.6 × 104 cm−1 at 705 nm. The absorption coefficient slightly decreased to 4.4 × 104 cm−1 at 697 nm for PNDI-TF5, and further lowered to 4.0 × 104 cm−1 at 696 nm for PNDI-TF10. The lowest absorption coefficient of 3.5 × 104 cm−1 was found at 680 nm for PNDI-TF15. Both in solutions and films, the donor polymer PBDB-T exhibited complementary absorption spectra with the acceptor polymers, leading to the desired coverage of the solar irradiation. The higher absorption coefficient of PBDB-T suggested that the donor polymer may contribute more to the sunlight absorption in comparison with the acceptor polymers. The blended films presented the maximal absorption coefficients of 4.3 × 104–5.0 × 104 cm−1 at ∼620 nm (Fig. S3b, ESI†).

In order to characterize the energy levels of the polymers, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were measured by using a square wave voltammetry (SWV) method. In this scenario, we used the peak voltages to determine the oxidation and reduction potentials (Fig. S4, ESI†).32 As depicted in the energy level diagram (Fig. 2b), fluorination tended to gradually lower the LUMO levels of the acceptor polymers, which can be explained by the high electronegativity of fluorine. A similar trend of LUMO levels was observed in the previous literature.28 Since the open-circuit voltage (Voc) is roughly linear to the energy offset between the HOMO level of a donor and the LUMO level of an acceptor, we here deduced that the all-PSCs based on the fluorinated acceptor polymers would offer lower Voc as compared to the PBDB-T:N2200 all-PSCs.
2.2. Photovoltaic performance
To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of the acceptor polymers, conventional all-PSCs (device configuration: ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Ag) and inverted all-PSCs (device configuration: ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag) were fabricated in this study. A systematic characterization disclosed that the conventional all-PSCs afforded better device performance as compared with the inverted counterparts (Fig. S5 and Table S2, ESI†). This can be partially explained by the varied vertical phase separation of the acceptor polymers induced by the different content levels of fluorination.28,33,34 Therefore, we employed the conventional configuration to further study the device performance. By varying the D:A mass ratios from 1.5:1 to 1:1.5, the all-PSCs gave the best device performance under a D:A mass ratio of 1:1. (Fig. S6 and Table S3, ESI†). Fig. 3a depicts the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal all-PSCs under an illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The device parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF and PCEs) are summarized in Table 1. Fluorination tended to gradually lower the Voc from 0.89 V to 0.84 V, which is in good agreement with the down-shifted LUMO levels of the acceptor polymers (Fig. 2b). Superior performance was found in the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSCs, where a high Jsc of 14.89 mA cm−2, moderate Voc of 0.87 V and FF of 0.58 afford a high PCE of 7.6%. On the other hand, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF10 and PBDB-T:PNDI-TF15 all-PSCs were subject to the lower Voc and Jsc. In addition, thermal annealing (TA) was conducted to improve the device performance (Fig. S7 and Table S4, ESI†). Upon TA at 110 °C for 10 min, a higher PCE of 8.0% was achieved in the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSCs due to the clear improvement in Jsc and FF. Notably, the Jsc of 15.08 mA cm−2 is one of the highest values achieved by the all-PSCs based on the fluorinated acceptor polymers, which evidently surpasses the majority of the all-PSCs based on N2200.26,28,35 It is also among the highest photocurrent recorded for the all-PSCs to date.4,5,22 In addition, there was evidence that a few processing additives can optimize the nanostructures of the active layers and further improve the Jsc and FF of all-PSCs.36 A group of processing additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), diphenyl ether (DPE), 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) were explored in this study.37 However, the presence of processing additives dramatically reduced the Jsc and FF (Fig. S8 and Table S5, ESI†). The additive-free all-PSCs are beneficial for simplifying the processes in mass production.

In order to examine the accuracy of the Jsc measured in the J–V measurements, we measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the all-PSCs. As plotted in Fig. 3b, the all-PSCs showed a broad EQE response in the wavelength region of 350–900 nm, which agreed well with the absorption spectra of the corresponding blend films (Fig. S3b, ESI†). As compared with other all-PSCs, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSCs presented a higher EQE profile with maximum values over 70%, implying more efficient photon-to-charge conversion. The current density calculated by integrating the EQE spectra with an AM 1.5G solar spectrum coincided well with the corresponding Jsc with mismatches less than 5%, which verified the accuracy of the J–V measurements (Table 1).
In order to further disclose the potentials of the all-PSCs for practical manufacturing, we enlarged the active-areas of the all-PSCs from 0.07 cm2 to 0.97 cm2 (Fig. 3c). The J–V curves are plotted in Fig. S9, ESI.† The device parameters are summarized in Table S6, ESI.† For each all-PSC, the maximal PCE was achieved with an active area of 0.07 cm2. The PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC with an active area of 0.10 cm2 still gave a high PCE of 7.3%. After enlarging the active area tenfold to ∼1 cm2, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 and PBDB-T:PNDI-TF10 all-PSCs can retain good PCEs over 5.5%. Although good homogeneity, high and balanced hole and electron mobilities of the polymer:polymer blends have positive effects on the Jsc and FF, there was evidence indicating that the higher series resistance contributed from the large-area ITO is a key limiting factor on the Jsc, FF and PCEs of large-area PSCs (active areas > ∼1 cm2).38 To minimize series resistance, integration of large-area ITO with metallic grid and frame has been demonstrated as a proper method to realize high-performance and large-area all-PSCs.39 Based on the best-performing PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC, we also evaluated PCEs with active layers of varied thicknesses ranging from 90 nm to 340 nm (Fig. 3d). The J–V curves are plotted in Fig. S10, ESI.† The device parameters are summarized in Table S7, ESI.† The PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSCs presented good PCEs over 6% in a wide thickness range of 90–260 nm. The good photovoltaic performance under large active areas and thick active layers reveals the potential of the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSCs for high-throughput manufacturing via a roll-to-roll technology.40,41
2.3. Blend morphology
The morphology of the active layers was studied via atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). The blend films were prepared under the optimized device conditions. AFM images were taken to depict the surface nanostructures of the blend films (Fig. S11, ESI†). The PBDB-T:PNDI-TFx and PBDB-T:N2200 blend films exhibited fine microstructures without large phase separation and polymer domains. The small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 1.24–1.55 nm is an indication of low surface roughness. GIWAXS measurements were performed to characterize the molecular orientation and crystalline texture. Fig. 4 shows the GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding line cuts of the blend films. As summarized in Tables S8 and S9 in the ESI,† each of the blend films showed a broad (100) scattering vector peak at qxy = 0.26–0.27 Å−1 along the in-plane direction and a broad (010) scattering vector peak at qz = 1.60–1.65 Å−1 along the out-of-plane direction. This suggests that the donor and acceptor polymers in each blend have predominant face-on orientation with respect to the substrate. The coherence length (CL) was calculated by using the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak via the Scherrer equation, which reflects a lower bound of the crystal size.42 At the out-of-plane (010) direction, the PBDB-T:N2200 blend showed the maximal π–π CL of 1.78 nm. Gradually, lower π–π CLs of 1.77 nm, 1.75 nm and 1.46 nm were found in the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5, PBDB-T:PNDI-TF10 and PBDB-T:PNDI-TF15 blends, respectively. A similar trend was observed from the lamellar CL at the in-plane (100) direction, which was gradually reduced from 9.81 nm for the PBDB-T:N2200 blend, to 6.85 nm for the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF15 blend. The GIWAXS results evidence that introducing more TF units in the acceptor backbone tends to impede the degrees of polymer orderings in the blend films. The blend morphology was associated with characterization of the exciton dissociation and charge mobilities as discussed in the sections below.

2.4. Exciton dissociation, mobility and recombination
In order to further understand the origin of the superior Jsc of the all-PSCs, a set of experiments were conducted to study the charge generation, charge transport and recombination loses. First, relative dielectric constants (εr) were measured to estimate the binding energy (ECTB) of the charge transfer (CT) state.29,43,44 Owing to the relatively low εr of organic semiconductors, the bound hole-electron pairs in a blend film need to overcome a ECTB (>100 meV) before dissociation within the lifetime. In this work, the εr of the neat acceptor polymers and the blends were recorded via spectral impedance measurements. Using an equivalent circuit model, the average εr was determined by fitting over the frequency range of 1 kHz–1 GHz. The frequency-dependent εr of the neat acceptor polymers and the blend films are shown in Fig. S12, ESI† and Fig. 5a, respectively. The three fluorinated acceptor polymers afforded a higher εr of ∼3.63–3.77 as compared with the non-fluorinated N2200 (εr = ∼3.61). A similar trend was observed in the blend films. As compared with the non-fluorinated PBDB-T:N2200 blend, a gradual increase in εr was recorded in the PBDB-T:PNDI-TFx blends as more TF units were included in the acceptor polymers, which is attributed to the increased polarity of the polymer backbones (Table 2).29,44ECTB is determined by using eqn (1),29,45 (1)where q is the elemental electron charge, ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the blend film and r is the radius of average diameter for electron–hole separation. Here, r = 1.5 nm was used, since it is a common value in organic solar cells.46 As compared to the PBDB-T:N2200 blend with a ECTB of 0.32 eV, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TFx blends presented a lower ECTB of 0.27–0.29 eV. This is thought to be one of the factors which improves exciton dissociation and thereby boosts the Jsc in this study. In order to verify the calculations in this section, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and effective voltage (Veff) dependent photocurrent density (Jph) measurements were performed in the next section.

The ultrafast exciton dissociation of the polymer:polymer blends was studied in a time scale of picoseconds via TRPL spectroscopy.11,25,47 Since the donor PBDB-T and the acceptor PNDI-TFx presented individual photoluminescence (PL), the TRPL signals were readily probed at two wavelength regions: 660–680 nm for PBDB-T and 860–880 nm for PNDI-TFx. The normalized TRPL kinetics of the neat polymers and the blends were shown in Fig. S13, ESI,†Fig. 5b and c, respectively. The exciton lifetime (τ) was defined as the time when the emission decays to 1/e of the initial intensity. As compared with N2200 with a τ of ∼59 ps,25 PNDI-TFx featured longer τ over ∼100 ps, which can favor the exciton diffusion in the acceptor phases. Due to the ultrafast exciton dissociation at the D/A interfaces, the τ of the blend films were evidently shorter than those of the neat polymers, (Table S10, ESI†). We noted that the TRPL kinetics of the donor PBDB-T in the blend films was non-exponential (biexponential), which combined fast and slow decay components. This non-exponential PL decay can be attributed to an inhomogeneous size distribution of the donor phase in the blend, which has been observed in several high-performance organic solar cells.11,47,48 On the other hand, the acceptor polymers in each blend behaved with mono-exponential PL decay, suggesting the relative homogeneous size distribution of the acceptor phase in each blend. In this study, an average exciton lifetime () was calculated to estimate the exciton quenching efficiencies of the donor (ηD) and acceptor (ηA) in each blend by using eqn (2): (2)
As summarized in Table 2, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 blend attained superior η from both the donor and acceptor components as compared with other fluorinated blends, suggesting that the generated excitons can dissociate in a more efficient way.
In addition to TRPL measurements, the exciton dissociation of the real all-PSCs was also evaluated by the Jph–Veff characteristics (Fig. 5d).49 In this scenario, Jph is plotted on a double logarithmic scale against the Veff. Veff is defined as Veff = V0 − Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at which Jph is zero and Vbias is the applied voltage. Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and darkness, respectively. In the low field regime, the Jph linearly increased with Veff and slowly entered a saturated state (Jsat) due to the suppressed bimolecular recombination. In the high field regime, the Jph became field- and temperature-independent, indicating that most generated bound hole-electron pairs were dissociated into free charges. Under the short-circuit condition, the value of Jph/Jsat is suggested to estimate the exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss), which reflects the probability that a hole-electron pair dissociates into free charges at a given electric field and temperature.49 In this study, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC gave the highest Pdiss of 97.6% as compared with the other three all-PSCs. This is in good agreement with the TRPL measurements, both of which confirmed that the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSCs afforded more efficient exciton dissociation. Although the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF10 and PBDB-T:PNDI-TF15 systems afforded slightly lower ECTB, the less efficient exciton dissociation of them should stem from the inferior blend morphology as compared with the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 system, which reveals that blend morphology still plays a predominant role for determining the Jsc of the all-PSCs.
The hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the blend films were measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method.50 The J–V curves of the hole-only and electron-only devices are shown in Fig. S14, ESI.† The calculated hole mobility (μh) and electron mobility (μe) are summarized in Table S11, ESI.† The three all-PSCs exhibited moderate and well balanced μh and μe with low μh/μe within 4, implying that the mobility was not a limiting factor for the performance of the all-PSCs in this study. Associated with the GIWAXS measurements, we noted that the π–π CL at the out-of-plane (010) direction followed well with the charge carrier mobilities of the blends.
Exciton dissociation and recombination are two detrimental yet competitive processes for charge generation. At last, recombination loss was characterized by studying the dependence of Jsc and Voc upon the incident light intensities (I) ranging from 1 to 100 mW cm−2.51 The Jsc and I are plotted on a double logarithmic scale and fitted to a power law given by Jsc ∝ Iα. The exponent α were calculated to be 0.998, 0.997, and 0.995 for PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5, PBDB-T:PNDI-TF10 and PBDB-T:PNDI-TF15 all-PSCs, respectively (Fig. S15a, ESI†). This suggests that the bimolecular recombination in these all-PSCs was negligible and most charge carriers were swept out prior to recombination under short-circuit conditions. In addition, Fig. S15b, ESI† plots Voc against a logarithmic scale of I. The I dependence of Voc offers supplementary information on the details of the recombination. The slope (nkT/q) can be extracted to distinguish the recombination mechanism, where k, T, and q refer to Boltzmann constant, Kelvin temperature, and unit charge, respectively.51 The slopes for PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5, PBDB-T:PNDI-TF10 and PBDB-T:PNDI-TF15 all-PSCs were 1.24 kT/q, 1.26 kT/q and 1.39 kT/q, respectively. This indicates that the recombination of each all-PSC was dominated by a bimolecular mechanism under open-circuit conditions and more fluorination on the acceptor polymers tended to agitate the monomolecular recombination. On the basis of the similar absorption coefficients of the blends, the enhanced Jsc of the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC can be explained by the synergistic effects of the reduced ECTB and the higher degrees of the π–π stacking at the out-of-plane (010) direction, where the former can enhance the exciton dissociation and the latter factor gave rise to better charge transport in the active layers.
2.5. Stability of all-PSCs
Furthermore, we performed a stability test on the best-performing PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC. A shelf life study was carried out by storing the unencapsulated all-PSC in a glovebox and periodically measuring the J–V curves. As depicted in Fig. 6a, the PCEs of the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC suffered from a burn-in period in the first ∼192 h, where the PCEs quickly decayed to ∼95%. After that, the PCEs went into a relatively steady state. Encouragingly, the all-PSCs retained ∼90% of the initial PCE after 1000 h. Since it was evidenced that the surface of the solar cells can reach up to ∼80 °C under real sunlight, the thermal stability was evaluated by periodically measuring the unencapsulated all-PSC under continuous thermal annealing at 90 °C. The PCEs versus heating time is plotted in Fig. 6b. The device parameters are summarized in Table S12, ESI.† After 24 h, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC gave a slight PCE degradation within 10% of the initial PCE. The results highlight the good resistance of the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC against aging and thermal stress, which is comparable with previous reports for other stable and high-performance all-PSCs.23,47,52

2.6. Flexible all-PSCs
Based on the best-performing PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 system, we further fabricated flexible all-PSCs by using a device configuration of PET/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Ag. For comparison, the PBDB-T:N2200 flexible all-PSC was fabricated under the same conditions. Fig. 7a plots the J–V curves of the flexible all-PSC under an illumination of AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. Impressively, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC attained a good PCE of 5.9% under an active area of 0.07 cm2, ∼25% higher than that of the PBDB-T:N2200 all-PSC. As with the rigid all-PSCs discussed above, the superior PCE can be attributed to the higher Jsc and FF induced by the fluorinated acceptor polymer. As compared with the rigid all-PSCs, the performance of the flexible all-PSC suffered from a high sheet resistance (36–39 Ω sq−1) as well as low transparency of the PET/ITO electrode (Fig. S16, ESI†). The current density calculated from the EQE spectra coincided with the Jsc for each all-PSC (Fig. 7b).

(b) EQE profiles and (c) PCE decay versus bending cycles of the flexible all-PSCs (inset image shows a schematic diagram of the bending tests.). (d) AFM and SEM images of the active layers before and after the bending cycles. 
Furthermore, a bending test was performed to study the durability of the all-PSCs against mechanical deformation. The J–V curves were measured under different bending cycles at a bending radius of 6.0 mm (Fig. S17, ESI†). The device parameters are summarized in Tables S13 and S14, ESI.† As shown in Fig. 7c, a slight PCE decay was observed in PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC for the first five cycles of bending. After that, Jsc was dramatically degraded. Encouragingly, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 flexible all-PSC can retain ∼80% of the initial PCE after 100 cycles of continuous bending, which always gave higher PCEs in comparison with the PBDB-T:N2200 flexible all-PSC. Without any processing additives aiming to improve mechanical durability, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 flexible all-PSC exhibited one of the highest performance among the state-of-the-art flexible all-PSCs.40,41,53
AFM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken to study the morphological variations of the active layer before and after 100 cycles of bending.54,55 AFM images depicted an evident increase in the roughness after bending, where the RMS was raised from 7.40 nm to 9.72 nm. In general, the bending strain tends to generate cracks on the brittle ITO, the upper active layers as well as the metal electrode, which significantly increase the sheet resistance of the solar cells.56 Interestingly, no big crack was observed on the active layer in this study. The SEM images showed that the continuous bending gave rise to a number of pits on the surface of the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 layer, which agreed well with the increased roughness indicated by the AFM measurements. The unstable morphology of the active layer is suggested to be one of the key factors for the PCE decay. Further studies are devoted to developing durable electrodes and processing additives to improve the morphological stability and device reproducibility without compromising the performance of the all-PSCs.40,53
3. Conclusion
In summary, three new fluorinated acceptor polymers were synthesized, combining the copolymerization and fluorination strategies with the intention to synergistically modulate the crystallinity and εr of the polymer:polymer blends. Increasing the content of TF units gradually improved the Mn and solubility yet reduced the crystallinity of the random polymers. Fluorination on the acceptor polymers gave rise to higher εr, which improved the exciton dissociation in the polymer:polymer blends. By loading 5% of the TF units, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC showed optimal blend morphology, more effective exciton dissociation and negligible recombination losses as compared to the other all-PSCs based on PNDI-T10, PNDI-T15 as well as N2200. As a result, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSC attained the maximal PCE of 8.0% with good shelf lifetime and thermal stability. The outstanding Jsc of 15.08 mA cm−2 is one of the highest values achieved by all-PSCs based on the fluorinated acceptor polymers, which evidently surpasses the majority of the all-PSCs based on the non-fluorinated acceptor N2200. It is also among the highest Jsc recorded from the all-PSCs to date. With respect to mass production for real-world applications, the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 all-PSCs exhibited good performance under a wide range of active areas (0.07–0.97 cm2) and active layer thickness (90–340 nm). In addition to the rigid electrode, the flexible all-PSC based on PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 achieved an encouraging PCE approaching 6.0%. Without any processing additives aiming to improve mechanical durability, it attains one of the highest performances among the state-of-the-art flexible all-PSCs. This work opens an avenue for developing high-performance acceptor polymers via the copolymerization and fluorination concepts. It highlights the appealing acceptor polymer PNDI-TF5 for high-performance and stable all-PSCs and also discloses its potentials for mass and robust manufacture.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Fabrication of rigid All-PSCs
All devices were fabricated and tested in a glove box with temperature: ∼20 °C, oxygen: ∼0.1 ppm and water: ∼0.1 ppm. The conventional all-PSCs were fabricated by using a device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/PDINO (5 nm)/Ag (80 nm). Pre-structured ITO-coated glass substrates were spin-coated with 40 nm PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS™ P VP AI 4083), followed by annealing at 150 °C for 20 min. The inverted all-PSCs were fabricated by using a device configuration of ITO/zinc oxide (ZnO) (40 nm)/active layer/molybdenum(VI) oxide (MoO3) (10 nm)/Ag (80 nm). The sol–gel ZnO was prepared by mixing zinc acetate dihydrate (0.5 M), ethanolamine (0.5 M) in 2-methoxy ethanol in an ambient atmosphere. The sol–gel ZnO (40 nm) was spin-coated onto the ITO-coated glass substrate at a spinning rate of 4000 rpm for 40 s. The PBDB-T and PNDI-TF5 with a 1:1 w/w ratio were dissolved in chlorobenzene (CB) with a total concentration of 9.5 mg mL−1. The PBDB-T:PNDI-TF10, PBDB-T:PNDI-TF15 and PBDB-T:N2200 solutions were also prepared with a 1:1 w/w ratio of donor to acceptor. The total concentrations in CB were 9 mg mL−1, 9 mg mL−1 and 10 mg mL−1, respectively. The solutions were stirred continuously at room temperature overnight before the spin-coating (1800 rpm and 60 s for the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF5 blends, 1500 rpm and 60 s for the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF10 blends, 1500 rpm and 60 s for the PBDB-T:PNDI-TF15 blends and 2800 rpm and 90 s for the PBDB-T:N2200). After spin-coating, the active layers were thermal annealed at 110 °C for 10 min. For the conventional all-PSCs, an ethanol solution of PDINO (1 mg mL−1) was spin-coated on the active layers at 3000 rpm for 25 s. Finally, Ag (80 nm) was deposited on top of PDINO via a mask under 3 × 10−4 Pa vacuum. For inverted all-PSCs, the films were directly transferred to a vapor deposition system inside a glove box. MoO3 (10 nm) and Ag (80 nm) were deposited via a mask under 3 × 10−4 Pa vacuum onto the active layers. The active area of the all-PSC was defined by the overlap of the ITO and Ag electrode and was measured using a microscope.
4.2. Fabrication of flexible all-PSCs
The flexible all-PSCs were fabricated by using a conventional configuration of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/PDINO (5 nm)/Ag (80 nm). Pre-structured ITO-coated PET films were used as the flexible substrates. The fabrication of each layer followed similar procedures with the rigid all-PSCs. The active area of the flexible all-PSC was measured to be 0.07 cm2.
4.3. 
          J–V and EQE characterization
The J–V curves were recorded in backward scan direction by using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter under a solar simulator (Oriel Sol3A, 69920, Newport) with simulated AM1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The intensity of light was calibrated by using a Si-based power meter (PT-SI-SRC, Pharos). The current was measured by using a Keithley 485 picoammeter under monochromatic light (MS257) illumination across the all-PSCs. The current was recorded as the voltage over a 50 Ω resistance and converted to an EQE profile by comparing the data with a calibrated Si reference cell.
4.4. Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements
Grazing incidence X-ray scattering characterization of the thin films was performed on beam 7.3.3. at the Advanced Light Source.57 Samples were prepared on Si substrates by using the same procedure as that used for all-PSCs. A 10 keV X-ray beam was incident at a grazing angle of 0.12°–0.16°, selected to maximize the scattering intensity from the samples. The scattered X-rays were detected using a Dectris Pilatus 2M photon counting detector.
