    , Accepted 9th October 2017First published on 9th October 2017AbstractEfficient charge carrier extraction from a colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solid is crucial for high performance of CQD solar cells (CQDSCs). Herein, highly ordered wrinkled MgZnO (MZO) thin films are demonstrated to improve the charge carrier extraction of PbS CQDSCs. The highly ordered wrinkled MZO thin films are prepared using a low-temperature combustion method. The photovoltaic performances of CQDSCs with a combustion-processed MZO (CP-MZO) thin film as an electron transport material (ETM) are compared to those of CQDSCs with a conventional sol–gel processed MZO (SGP-MZO) thin film as an ETM. We performed photoluminescence quenching measurements of the colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solid and charge carrier dynamic analysis of full solar cell devices. The results show that the highly ordered wrinkled CP-MZO thin film significantly increases the charge carrier extraction from the CQD solid and therefore diminishes the charge interfacial recombination at the CQD/ETM junction, leading to a 15.5% increase in power conversion efficiency. The improved efficiency in the CP-MZO based CQDSC is also attributed to the compact and pin-hole free CP-MZO thin film.
1. Introduction
Colloidal quantum dot solar cells (CQDSCs) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their broad light absorption spectra, compatibility with flexible substrates, solution-processability and high stability.1–6 Significant progress in the enhancement of the CQDSC performance has been made in the past few years by controlling the device physics and colloidal quantum dot (CQD) surface chemistry, and PbS CQDSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 11% was reported recently.7 For a typically efficient CQDSC, the device is constructed with a heterojunction architecture, where a CQD solid film is sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL) and a metallic counter electrode.8–12 The surface ligands on the CQDs enable control over the electronic properties of the CQD solid, and an n-type CQD solid is obtained with tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) and a p-type CQD solid is obtained with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT).9,13–15 In solar cells an n-type CQD solid layer is combined with a p-type CQD solid layer and this junction is sandwiched between an ETL and a metal contact. An ideal electron transport material for CQDSCs is expected to have suitable energy levels, require cost-effective and low-temperature fabrication methods, and be highly transparent in the visible and near infrared (NIR) wavelength regions.13,16–19 Most of the ETL materials that have been used in CQDSCs so far are wide bandgap semiconductor metal oxides, such as ZnO or TiO2.
However, the charge carrier interfacial recombination at the ETL/CQD interface usually occurs with faster kinetics than the charge recombination within the CQD solid and the interfacial recombination therefore limits the electron extraction and solar cell efficiency.19–21 To overcome such interfacial recombination, modification of the interface between the ETL and the CQD solid is required by inserting a buffer layer, such as a fullerene thin film,19 polyelectrolyte,20 an inorganic layer,22 or a molecular monolayer (such as 4-aminobenzoic acid).16 However, the energy levels of the ETL, buffer layer and CQD solid need to be finely controlled to achieve favourable band alignment within the solar cell, maximizing the charge carrier extraction.
MgZnO (MZO) exhibits a tunable bandgap energy by controlling the concentration of magnesium in the MZO, and an increase in the concentration of magnesium in MZO will result in a higher energy of the conduction band minimum (CBM) and a lower energy of the valence band maximum (VBM).23–27 Tang et al. reported that by using MZO as an ETL in CQDSCs, the charge carrier interfacial recombination at the ETL/CQD interface can be reduced due to the higher CBM for MZO than for ZnO.28 Previously, we found that a MZO thin film is also an efficient buffer layer to enhance the charge carrier extraction in CQDSCs.29 However, MZO films are generally prepared using sol–gel methods that require high annealing temperature (300–400 °C) to convert the precursors into MZO.23,24,27,28 Such high temperature is incompatible with many flexible polymeric substrates (<200 °C), which reduces the possibility of using roll-to-roll spraying or printing fabrication methods. Meanwhile, such high temperature may greatly decrease the conductivity of the indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode and may cause cracks or imperfect interfaces due to the thermal expansion coefficient mismatch.30–33 Therefore, low-temperature-processed MZO thin films are highly desirable to fully exploit the excellent properties of MZO materials for their application in photovoltaic and optoelectronic devices.
In this work, a solution-processed, combustion method is developed for the preparation of a MZO thin film at a low temperature of 170 °C. The obtained combustion-processed MZO (CP-MZO) thin film is more compact and uniform than a conventional sol–gel processed MZO (SGP-MZO) thin film. Interestingly, the CP-MZO thin film has a highly ordered wrinkled surface with wrinkles over a large area. PbS CQDSCs with a wrinkled CP-MZO thin film as an ETL were fabricated, and the solar cells exhibited a high PCE of 9.7%, compared to that (8.4%) of a CQDSC with a conventional SGP-MZO thin film as an ETL. Different techniques were used to investigate the different devices, and the results suggest that the improved performance is due to the increased charge extraction by the high quality MZO thin film and the ordered wrinkled surface. Moreover, CP-MZO based solar cells exhibit remarkable stability both under continuous illumination and when stored under ambient conditions. This work confirms that the MZO thin film can be prepared with a low temperature approach, and the highly ordered wrinkles formed on the film surface enable improved charge extraction from the CQD layer and reduce charge recombination.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Thin film preparation
Sol–gel processed metal oxide films generally require significant external energy input for the formation of crystalline materials.4,30,34,35 In contrast, the combustion method for the fabrication of metal oxides is a feasible approach to prepare highly crystalline materials at much lower temperature than those applied for conventional sol–gel methods.36–38 The synthetic approaches of MZO using conventional sol–gel and low-temperature combustion methods are displayed in Fig. 1a. For SGP-MZO preparation, zinc acetate and magnesium acetate are generally used as precursors and the formation processes need annealing at a temperature of 300–400 °C.23,24,27,28 In contrast, a redox-based combustion synthetic route is designed to prepare MZO, and acetylacetone and metal (zinc and magnesium) nitrates are applied as fuel and oxidizers, respectively. A MZO thin film with a magnesium concentration of 10 mol% was reported as an ideal electron transport material for CQDSCs.28,29 Therefore, the molar ratio of magnesium in the MZO in this work is fixed at 10% of the total zinc and magnesium content for both SGP-MZO and CP-MZO.

To monitor the MZO formation via sol–gel and combustion approaches, the formation process was investigated by using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) techniques. As expected, during the MZO formation via the sol–gel method there is an exothermic peak at ∼350 °C and the mass is significantly decreased around that temperature (Fig. 1b), which indicates that MZO is formed from the precursors. However, during the MZO formation via the combustion method, an exothermic peak is located at ∼170 °C, which is in good agreement with the temperature of abrupt mass loss (Fig. 1c). This implies that the thermal energy provided by the combustion processing can satisfy the energy needed for the conversion of precursors to metal oxides. However, the mechanism for the MZO formation via the combustion approach at a low temperature is not clear at this point and needs further investigation.
2.2 Thin film characterization
For a solar cell, the transparency of the substrate together with the deposited charge transport material is very important for the device photovoltaic performance, since for high transparency more photons can reach the light absorber layer, maximizing the device photocurrent. The optical transmittance of a CP-MZO thin film prepared at 170 °C was measured and compared to the transmittance of an SGP-MZO thin film prepared at 350 °C (Fig. 2a). Both films were prepared on ITO glass substrates, which were also applied for the CQDSC. It can be seen that the complete sample of glass/ITO/CP-MZO exhibits excellent transparency in the visible and NIR wavelength regions with an average transmittance of around 90%, which is higher than that of the complete sample of glass/ITO/SGP-MZO. Due to the fact that PbS CQDs exhibit strong light absorption in the visible and NIR wavelength regions, higher transmittance may enable more photons to reach the CQD solid in the solar cell, which is advantageous for photocurrent generation.

(g) Cross-sectional SEM image of the SGP-MZO thin film prepared on the ITO glass substrate. (h) HRTEM image of CP-MZO. 
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed to examine the crystallinity of the MZO thin film (Fig. 2b), which shows that the low-temperature CP-MZO thin film is well crystallized and comparable to that of the conventional SGP-MZO thin film prepared at 350 °C. The peaks at 2θ = 31.7°, 34.5°, 36.2° and 56.7° represent the typical diffraction peaks of the (100), (002), (101) and (110) planes, respectively, of hexagonal structured ZnO (JCPDS No. 01-079-2205). The other diffraction peaks in the XRD patterns result from the microscopy slide substrate used for the measurement. It is notable that no additional diffraction peaks from impurities, such as MgO, were detected in the XRD patterns, which suggests that the magnesium is fully included in the MZO alloy.28 A lower temperature of 150 °C was also applied to prepare a MZO thin film using the combustion method to find the possibility for further decreasing the temperature for MZO thin film preparation. However, the film in this case failed to crystallize (Fig. S1, ESI†). Moreover, we also tried to prepare MZO via the combustion approach in the absence of acetylacetone, and the required temperature for the MZO formation was then ∼350 °C (Fig. S2, ESI†), similar to that of the sol–gel approach. Therefore, from the above results we could conclude here that the required temperature of 170 °C for CP-MZO with acetylacetone as a fuel is sufficient to convert the precursors to MZO.
The surface morphologies of the MZO thin films prepared via the sol–gel and the combustion methods were measured using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SGP-MZO thin film shows a rough surface and lots of pin holes distributed over the film (Fig. 2c). The CP-MZO film clearly exhibits a rather compact, pin-hole free and uniform surface morphology (Fig. 2d). Surprisingly, highly ordered wrinkles with a length of several micrometers are formed on the film surface. Fig. 2e and f display lower magnification SEM images of the CP-MZO thin film, which reveal that the CP-MZO thin film has a rather homogeneous wrinkled surface over a larger area. The distances between the neighbouring wrinkles are highly uniform with values of 1.5–2.5 μm, and the heights of the wrinkles are 80–110 nm (Fig. 2g). The reason for the formation of the highly ordered wrinkled surface remains unknown at this point, but we believe that the low growing rate at a relatively low-temperature may be important in the formation of these structures.39–41 The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy analysis confirms that the MZO film is composed of Zn, Mg and O elements (Fig. S3, ESI†). The crystals in the CP-MZO film were further analyzed using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM), as shown in Fig. 2h. The marked interplanar distance is ∼0.28 nm, which is in agreement with the (110) crystal plane of ZnO,42 consistent with the XRD results.
2.3 Charge extraction dynamics
Photoluminescence (PL) quenching measurements are generally applied to evaluate the charge extraction efficiency from the light absorber to a charge transport material.37,43,44 Therefore, steady-state PL quenching measurements were performed to study the efficiency of electron extraction from the CQD solid film by the MZO thin film. CQD solid films were deposited on the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films, respectively, and a CQD solid film prepared on glass was used as a reference for the measurement. Fig. 3 shows the steady-state PL spectra of the CQD solid film prepared on the MZO thin films and the reference CQD solid film on glass. It can be seen that the CQD solid film shows a much lower PL intensity when deposited on the MZO (both SGP-MZO and CP-MZO) thin films compared to the PL intensity of the CQD solid film on glass, which shows that the MZO films induce PL quenching of the CQD solid, suggesting that the electrons can be efficiently extracted from the CQD solid film by these MZO films.
 Fig. 3  (a) PL spectra and (b) PL decay curves of CQD solid films prepared on the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films, respectively. A CQD solid film on glass was applied as a reference for the measurement. 
The PL quenching is more efficient on the CP-MZO thin film than on the SGP-MZO thin film, which indicates that increased charge extraction may be achieved by using the CP-MZO thin film as an electron transport material. To confirm such hypotheses and gain more details about the charge transport dynamics, the fluorescence lifetime was further analysed using time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC). Fig. 3b shows the PL decay curves of the CQD solid film and the films prepared on the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films, respectively. The fluorescence lifetimes were analysed by fitting the curves, which were calculated to be 5, 1.23 and 0.99 ns for the CQD solid film and the films prepared on the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films, respectively. From the fluorescence lifetime the electron injection time and efficiency from the CQD solid to the MZO film were further analysed, which show that the electron injection times from the CQD solid to the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films are 1.63 and 1.23 ns, respectively. The electron injection efficiencies are calculated to be 75.4% and 82.2% for the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films, respectively. The faster electron injection and increased charge extraction caused by the CP-MZO thin film may be a result of the high quality MZO thin film prepared using the combustion method and also due to the highly ordered wrinkled surface, which will be further discussed in the following section.
2.4 Solar cell fabrication and photovoltaic performance
To investigate the application of a low-temperature CP-MZO thin film with an ordered wrinkled surface as an ETL in solar cells, CQDSCs were fabricated with an ITO/MZO/PbS CQDs/Au device architecture, as shown in Fig. 4a. The light absorbance and PL spectra of the PbS CQDs are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The CQD solid was prepared using a layer-by-layer spin-casting method. The first eight CQD layers were treated with tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) and the subsequent two CQD layers were treated with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT) for ligand exchange.9,13,45Fig. 4b shows the cross-sectional SEM image of a full CQDSC with the CP-MZO thin film as an ETL. It can be seen that the CQD solid film fully covers the wrinkled nanostructure. CQDSCs with the conventional SGP-MZO thin film as an ETL were also fabricated for comparison, and the cross-sectional SEM image is presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The energy levels of each material for the CQD solar cell are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†).

(b) Cross-sectional SEM image of the CQDSC with a low-temperature CP-MZO thin film as an ETL. J–V curves of the CQDSCs with the (c) SGP-MZO and (d) CP-MZO thin films as ETLs, respectively. (e) IPCE spectra of the CQDSCs with the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films as ETLs, respectively. Statistical photovoltaic parameters of (f) PCE, (g) Jsc, (h) FF, and (i) Voc of the CQDSCs with different ETLs. 
The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the CQDSCs with different ETLs were measured under AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, and under dark conditions. Fig. 4c and d show the J–V curves of the solar cells with the CP-MZO and SCP-MZO thin films as ETLs, respectively, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in the figures. The SGP-MZO based device exhibits a PCE of 8.4% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.60 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 22.9 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.61, which is comparable to or even better than the reported efficiency (8.3%) of the CQDSC with the same architecture.28 In contrast, the PCE of the device with the wrinkled CP-MZO thin film as an ETL is largely improved to 9.7%, with a Voc of 0.62 V, a Jsc of 23.8 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.66. The improved Voc and FF may be related to the lower interfacial recombination at the MZO/CQD interface, which will be further discussed below. The improved Jsc of the CP-MZO based solar cell may also be attributed to the lower recombination at the interface as a result of efficient electron injection into the CP-MZO layer (as suggested by the PL measurements above) or higher optical transparency of the glass/ITO/CP-MZO thin film (Fig. 2a), leading to more photons reaching the CQD solid.
To obtain more details about the effects of the different MZO thin films on the interfacial connection within the solar cells, the series resistances (Rs) of the solar cells with the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films as ETLs were analyzed, which were shown to be 6.4 and 4.9 Ω cm−2, respectively. Meanwhile, the shunt resistances (Rsh) of these solar cells were also analyzed, which were shown to be ∼371 and 456 Ω cm−2, respectively. The lower Rs and higher Rsh in the CP-MZO based solar cell may suggest that an improved interfacial junction of the MZO thin film with the CQD solid is achieved in the solar cell, facilitating charge extraction and reducing recombination. One-dimensional electron transport materials, such as nanowires and hierarchical structures, were previously reported as an effective route to enhance the charge collection in the CQDSCs and thus improve the device performance.46–48 Therefore, the highly ordered wrinkles formed on the MZO thin film may also result in enhanced charge extraction from the CQD solid, in a similar way to the nanowires or hierarchical structures.

Fig. 4e presents the corresponding incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the above-mentioned solar cells. The CP-MZO based solar cell exhibits higher IPCE values in the 400–650 nm and 800–1050 nm wavelength regions. The integrated photocurrents from the IPCE spectra are in line with the Jsc obtained from J–V measurements (Fig. S7, ESI†). Fig. 4f–i displays the statistical photovoltaic parameters, such as PCE, Jsc, FF, and Voc, of the CQDSCs with the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films as the ETLs, respectively. 16 individual devices were measured for the statistics of each condition and the results indicate that the devices with both the SGP-MZO and the CP-MZO thin films as ETLs exhibit well repeatable results, and the CP-MZO based devices have a higher average efficiency compared to those of the SGP-MZO based devices. The Voc of a solar cell is generally determined from the difference in the Fermi levels of the electron transport material and hole transport material. Therefore, the work function of the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films were determined using a Kelvin probe (Fig. S8, ESI†), which shows that the CP-MZO thin film has ∼0.5 eV higher than the SGP-MZO thin film that may contribute to the improved Voc in CP-MZO based devices.
2.5 Charge carrier dynamics within solar cells
To gain more insight into the effects of the ETL on the interfacial ETL/CQD contact and the charge carrier dynamics within the solar cells, the transient Voc decay, photovoltage and photocurrent as a function of light intensity were further analyzed. The transient Voc decay may provide a way to directly probe the charge carrier recombination within a solar cell. When a solar cell is illuminated under open-circuit conditions, a voltage is produced across the full device. On the other hand, when the illumination is switched off, the charge carriers recombine and result in Voc decay.49,50 The Voc decay is related to the charge carrier recombination rate and the charge carrier lifetime in the solar cell, and slower Voc decay suggests an increased charge carrier lifetime.51–53

Fig. 5a shows the Voc decay curves of the solar cells with the SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films as ETLs, respectively. Two decay components (τ1 and τ2) were used to fit the transient Voc decays and the fitting equation and parameters are summarized in Fig. 5a. We found that the CP-MZO based solar cell showed a slower Voc decay compared to that of the SGP-MZO based solar cell. The electron lifetimes τ1 and τ2 are more than 2 and 5 times slower, respectively, compared to those of the SGP-MZO based solar cell. Since the same batch of PbS CQDs and the same device architecture were applied for the solar cells, the dramatic change in the decay kinetics is thus not attributed to the recombination within the CQD solid film. Therefore, the observed difference in Voc decays suggests that the slower Voc decay directly follows from a reduction in the charge carrier interfacial recombination. These results therefore imply that the solar cell with the CP-MZO thin film as an ETL has slower charge recombination at the CP-MZO/CQD interface.
 Fig. 5  (a) Photovoltage decay curves of the CQDSCs with the conventional SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films as ETLs, respectively. Two decay components (τ1 and τ2) were assigned to fit the transient photovoltage decay and the inset shows the fitting equation and parameters. (b) Voc and (c) Jsc as a function of the light intensity of the solar cells with the conventional SGP-MZO and CP-MZO thin films as ETLs, respectively. 
To further verify the reduced interfacial recombination demonstrated above, the light intensity dependent Voc and Jsc were further investigated (Fig. 5b and c). We observe that the SGP-MZO based solar cell exhibits a stronger dependence of Voc on the light intensity with a slope of 1.52kT/q, whereas in the CP-MZO based solar cell the slope is 1.48kT/q (Fig. 5b), where k, T and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin and elementary charge, respectively. The Jsc is largely affected by the light intensity in a solar cell and can be expressed as Jsc ∝ Iα,54 where I and α are the light intensity and exponential factor, respectively. An α = 0.93 was observed for the CP-MZO based solar cell, whereas the α value is 0.90 for the solar cell with the conventional SGP-MZO as the ETL (Fig. 5c). The higher α value of the CP-MZO based solar cell indicates that the charge extraction is improved, especially for high light intensities. The difference in the light intensity dependences of the Voc and Jsc therefore suggests that there is a lower recombination of charge carriers and higher charge carrier collection efficiency in the CP-MZO based solar cell. Moreover, the results of the light intensity dependence of Voc and Jsc are in good agreement with the results obtained from the transient Voc and steady-state PL studies, which confirms that the CP-MZO thin film with a highly ordered wrinkled surface could significantly diminish the interfacial charge recombination and thus increase the charge carrier collection at the CQDs/MZO interface, leading to improved device performance.
2.6 Solar cell stability
Due to the fact that the solar cell stability is critical for future applications, the stability of the CQDSC with the CP-MZO thin film as an ETL was examined both under continuous illumination and when stored under ambient conditions. The device performance was monitored by placing the solar cell under a solar simulator with continuous AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination. Fig. 6a shows the evolution of the photocurrent density and efficiency of the CP-MZO based solar cell with continuous illumination for ∼2500 s at the maximum power point (MPP). It is encouraging that both the photocurrent density at the MPP (JMPP) and PCE were maintained at a high level. Almost no degradation in the JMPP value was observed with a continuous illumination time of ∼2500 s. Only a small decrease was observed in the device efficiency and ∼92% of the original efficiency was maintained after continuous illumination for ∼2500 s.

The dotted line is added as a guide for the eye to clarify the efficiency decrease. (b) Stability test of unencapsulated CQDSCs with the CP-MZO thin film as the ETL. The devices were stored under an ambient atmosphere under dark conditions. 
Unencapsulated solar cells were stored under an ambient atmosphere in the dark and a high level performance without large degradation was observed after 35 days (Fig. 6b). The device performance was measured again after 95 days storage and the results show that the solar cells also maintain high level performance after a rather long time. These results suggest that the demonstrated CQDSCs with the low-temperature CP-MZO thin film as the ETL exhibit very promising stability.
The device efficiency of the demonstrated CP-MZO based CQDSCs was also compared to the reported CQDSCs with an SGP-MZO thin film as an ETL,28,29 and the CQDSCs exhibit better performance in the work presented here. The improved performance in the CP-MZO based solar cells results from the high quality of the MZO thin film and the highly ordered wrinkled surface, leading to enhanced charge extraction. This can be compared to charge transport layers with nanostructures, such as nanowires or hierarchical structures, which have been reported as effective routes to increase the photovoltaic performances of organic solar cells or CQD solar cells.45,48,55,56 However, such wrinkled surfaces are generally prepared on or limited to a flexible polymer surface when the substrate is subjected to mechanical stress.55–58 Therefore, this work may also provide a way to fabricate a highly ordered wrinkled surface on a hard substrate using a simple and low-temperature solution processed approach, for the applications in thin film energy conversion, generation and storage devices.
3. Conclusion
In summary, a highly ordered wrinkled MZO thin film is reported to enhance the charge carrier extraction of CQDSCs. The MZO thin film was prepared using a low-temperature, solution-processed combustion method and the thin film shows a comparable or even better optical transparency, crystallinity and surface morphology than those of a conventional SGP-MZO thin film. A CQDSC with a CP-MZO thin film as the ETL exhibits a higher PCE of 9.7%, compared to that (8.4%) of a CQDSC with an SGP-MZO thin film as the ETL, leading to a 15.5% increase in power conversion efficiency. Detailed investigations show that the electron transport is more efficient from the CQD layer to the CP-MZO layer compared to the SGP-MZO layer, and also that the charge recombination is slower in solar cell devices with the CP-MZO layer. These results together explain the high efficiency of the devices with the CP-MZO layer. Moreover, CP-MZO based CQDSCs exhibit good stability under both continuous illumination and when stored under ambient conditions. These results suggest that the combustion synthesis of MZO thin films is highly promising as a low-temperature, solution-processed approach for the preparation of efficient ETLs for high performance and stable solar cells.
4. Experimental
4.1 MZO thin film preparation
For the combustion precursor, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.8 mmol, 98%), Mg(NO3)2·6H2O (0.2 mmol, 99%), ethylenediamine (334 μL, 99%) and acetylacetone (450 μL, 99.5%) were dissolved in 1-methoxy-2-propanol (20 mL, 99%). For the sol–gel precursor, Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O (0.9 mmol, 99.5%), Mg(CH3COO)2·4H2O (0.1 mmol, 98%) and ethylenediamine (668 μL, 99%) were dissolved in 1-methoxy-2-propanol (20 mL, 99%). Both precursor solutions were stirred overnight at room temperature before use. Before spin-coating the precursor solutions on the top of substrates, the solutions were filtered with a filter with a pore size of 0.45 μm. A CP-MZO thin film was prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution on the top of a substrate, and then annealed under ambient conditions at 170 °C for 1 h. An SGP-MZO thin film was prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution on the top of a substrate and then annealed under ambient conditions at 350 °C for 30 min.
4.2 Device fabrication
CQDSCs were fabricated on ITO covered glass substrates (15 Ω □−1). The substrates were cleaned sequentially with water, acetone and ethanol with sonication for 20 min, and dried with air flow. Before deposition of a MZO thin film on the top of an ITO substrate, the substrate was UV-ozone treated for 20 min. PbS CQDs were synthesized according to the literature,59 and finally dispersed in octane with a concentration of ∼50 mg mL−1. Before deposition of the CQD solid film on the top of the MZO thin film, the MZO thin film was subjected to UV-ozone treatment again for another 20 min. The CQD solid film was deposited on the MZO thin film using a layer-by-layer spin-casting method under a nitrogen atmosphere. The CQD solution was filtered with a filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm and then spin-coated on the surface of the MZO thin film at 2500 rpm for 15 s. The CQD solid film was treated with tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI, 10 mg mL−1 in methanol) for 30 s and then spun again at 2500 rpm. The treated film was rinsed with methanol twice. These processes were repeated 8 times for CQD-TBAI layer deposition. Another two CQD layers were deposited on the top of the CQD-TBAI layer and treated with 1,2-ethanedithiol (EDT, 0.01% in acetonitrile) for 30 s, and then rinsed thrice with acetonitrile. Finally, an Au film with a thickness of 80 nm was thermally evaporated on the top of the CQD solid film.
4.3 Device characterization
The device photovoltaic performance was tested using a Newport solar simulator (Model 91160) with AM 1.5G illumination with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (one Sun). Before the measurement, a certified reference Si solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) was applied for the light intensity calibration. The J–V curves were recorded using a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter under a nitrogen atmosphere. The working area of the solar cell device was defined by a black mask with an aperture area of 6.8 mm2. IPCE spectra were recorded according to a previous method that uses a computer-controlled setup consisting of a xenon lamp (Spectral Products ASBXE 175), a monochromator (Spectral Products CM110), a LabJack U6, and a potentiostat (PINE, AFRDE 5).60 The setup was calibrated using a certified reference solar cell (Fraunhofer ISE) prior to the measurement. Voc decay, Jsc and Voc as a function of light intensity were measured according to previous methods,42 and a white LED lamp (Luxeon Star 1 W) was used as the light source during the measurement.
4.4 Material characterization
TGA and DSC measurements were carried out under a flow of air in an inert alumina cup. The samples were heated from room temperature to 500 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 using a Mettler Toledo TGA 3 instrument. Transmittance spectra were measured using an Ocean Optics HR2000 spectrometer with a Mikropack DH-2000-BAL light source. XRD measurements were carried out using a diffractometer D5000 (SIEMENS) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154059 nm) for diffraction angle 2θ in the 10–70° range. MZO thin films were prepared on microscopy slides for the XRD measurements. SEM and EDX measurements were performed using scanning electron microscopy (Zeiss 1550 with AZtec EDS) at an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. The TEM and HRTEM images were obtained by using a transmission electron microscope (JSM, 2100) at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The steady-state photoluminescence spectra were recorded using a Fluorolog Spectrophotometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with 550 nm excitation. TCSPC measurements were carried out using a picosecond diode laser of 470.4 nm (EPL 470) as an excitation light source. A cut-off filter (OG 570 nm) was used to block the scattered excitation light during the measurement. The TAC (Ortec 566, 50 ns) output was read by a DAQ-1 MCA computer card using 4096 channels and collected with Horiba Jobin Yvon DataStation 2.3.
