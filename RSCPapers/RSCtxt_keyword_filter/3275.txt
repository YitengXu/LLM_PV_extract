    , Accepted 27th April 2011First published on 26th May 2011AbstractThree copolymers of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) and diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) with a varying number of interconnecting thiophene units (nT) were synthesized by Suzuki polymerization. The PDPPnT-TT polymers display optical band gaps in the range of 1.33 to 1.52 eV and show ambipolar charge transport when applied in a field-effect transistor (FET) with hole and electron mobilities up to 3 × 10−2 and 2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1s−1, respectively. Organic solar cells based on the PDPPnT-TT polymers as donors and the fullerene derivative [60]PCBM as acceptor achieve power conversion efficiencies up to 3.4% when the layer is deposited with the use of a co-solvent. The co-solvent strongly affects the morphology of the active layer and improves the performance. For these polymers the LUMO–LUMO offset with [60]PCBM correlates with the photocurrent and the maximum external quantum efficiency.
Introduction
Solar cells are rapidly developing as a prime application of organic semiconductors.1 Published power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are as high as 8.3% at present.2–4 Apart from having a large overlap of the absorption spectrum with the solar emission and suitable HOMO and LUMO levels, many additional prerequisites have to be met for a polymer to act as a successful donor in organic photovoltaic cells such as molecular weight, solubility and ability to form a nanoscale phase separated blend with acceptor materials. In addition, a high charge carrier mobility is required to optimize transport of photogenerated charges to the electrodes.
By alternating electron rich and electron poor moieties in the main chain of the polymer it is possible to accurately tune the optical band gap and redox potentials that control the coverage of optical absorption with the solar spectrum and the open circuit voltage of the cell. The design of materials with high charge carrier mobility, however, is more difficult to control. The charge carrier mobility is important for separating and collecting charges efficiently. Increasing the tendency of semiconducting polymers to aggregate and crystallize, as well as increasing the size of π-conjugated segments, generally leads to more π-stacking and to improved interchain charge transfer, which is beneficial for charge transport. Consequently, fusing of aromatic rings and optimizing thin film processing has resulted in field-effect transistors (FETs) in which conjugated polymers display charge carrier mobilities in the order of 0.1 cm2 V−1s−1 for electrons5 and >1 cm2 V−1s−1 for holes.6Polymers based on the fused ring system thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) have displayed charge carrier mobility in FET devices up to 0.6 cm2 V−1s−1.7,8 These characteristics make the TT unit an interesting building block to be further explored for incorporating in conjugated polymers for solar cell applications. Moreover, we recently showed how a high open circuit voltage of 1.15 V could be obtained with a TT-based polymer.9
To control the band gap in conjugated polymers the electron rich TT unit can be combined with an electron deficient unit along the chain. The 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) unit has emerged as a promising unit in semiconducting polymers for photovoltaic10,11–18 and transistor applications.19–21Polymers based on 3,6-di-2-thienyl-1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (T-DPP-T) alternating with intermediate 2,5-thienylene (PDPP3T) and 1,4-phenylene units (PDPPTPT) (Fig. 1) can provide power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) under simulated AM1.5G light up to 5.5% and exhibit ambipolar charge transport in FETs.17,18 A performance of PCE = 4% was also obtained when T-DDP-T was alternating with 3,3′-didodecyl-2,2′-bithiophene-5,5′-diyl as in PBBTDPP2 (Fig. 1).10 On the other hand, for the T-DPP-T homopolymer (PDPP2T) photoinduced electron transfer to PCBM was inhibited by a small LUMO–LUMO offset.16 From these examples it is clear that by controlling the aromatic segment alternating with the T-DPP-T segment, polymers with high efficiencies can be obtained.

This justifies further exploring these structures to increase performance and to combine the 1,4-diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole (DPP) units with thieno[3,2-b]thiophenes (TT). In this paper we present three such copolymers with a varying number of interconnecting thiophene units (PDPPnT-TT, Fig. 1) to control the optical band gap, the HOMO and LUMO levels and the charge transport characteristics. A close derivative of PDPP2T-TTb presented here, but with 2-octyldodecyl side chains instead of 2-hexyldecyl, was shown to have a hole mobility of 0.94 cm2 V−1s−1 in an FET21 and recently DPP polymers combined with TT were found to exhibit a maximum hole mobility of 1.95 cm2 V−1s−1 and a PCE of 5.4% in solar cell when combined with [70]PCBM.22 We show that the PDPPnT-TT polymers (Fig. 1) described in this study exhibit ambipolar charge transport and that they provide a PCE up to 3.4% with [60]PCBM as acceptor in solar cells and discuss the structure property relations that rationalize these results.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthesis of the TT and T-TT-T monomers 2, 4 and 7 is shown in Scheme 1. The synthesis of 2,5-dibromo-3,6-di(4′-ethyloctyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (1) has been described previously.92,5-Dibromothieno[3,2-b]thiophene (3) was obtained from TCI. The corresponding boronic esters 2 and 4 were obtained viadebromination with n-butyllithium and subsequent borylation of the formed anions. The conversion occurred with reasonable yield for 2, but the yield for 4 was poor due to a difficult purification and the high purity required for the polymerization reaction. The first step in the synthesis of monomer 7 was a Stille coupling of 1 with 2-(tributylstannyl)thiophene to yield 5. Bromination with NBS led to 6, which was borylated in the same way as 1 and 3 to give monomer 7 in high yield. The T-DDP-T monomers, 3,6-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-di(2-alkyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrolo-1,4-dione 8 and 9 (Scheme 2) were synthesized according to literature procedures.19,23

The PDPPnT-TT polymers were synthesized as described in Scheme 2 using a Suzuki reaction with Pd2(dba)3 as the catalyst. The polymers were obtained with number average molecular weights (Mn) in the range of 9000–15000 g mol−1 and polydispersity indices varying from 2 to 4 (Table 1). The number average degree of polymerization (DPn) of 10–14 is similar for the three polymers and implies that they have up to ∼70 aromatic units along the chain.

Optical, electrochemical and electrical properties
The optical absorption spectra of the polymers are shown in Fig. 2 for solutions in chloroform and for thin films on glass. Going from solution to the solid state there is a small red shift of the absorption, signifying aggregation of chains. The optical band gaps in the solid state, determined from the onsets of absorption of PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP2T-TTb (1.31–1.33 eV) are very similar to that of PDPP3T (1.36 eV) (Table 1),17 showing that the effect of the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-2,5-diyl unit (TT) on the optical gap is similar to that of thiophene-2,5-diyl (T). The similar band gap is somewhat unexpected because the higher aromatic stabilization energy of thieno[3,2-b]thiophene compared to a single thiophene, would result in an increased gap between the aromatic and quinoid states. The optical band gap of PDPP4T-TT is much larger (1.52 eV), also compared to PBBTDPP2 (1.40 eV),10 and resembles that of PDPPTPT (1.53 eV).18 This shows that extending the number of thiophene units between the DPP units can be used to widen the optical band gap.

The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymers were determined by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in o-DCB solution (Table 1) using −5.23 eV as the offset of Fc/Fc+vs. vacuum.24PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP2T-TTb have very similar HOMO levels, but their LUMO levels differ by 80 mV. This difference is also reflected in the optical band gap in solution, which is a little larger for PDPP2T-TTa. The reason for the higher band gap could be that the alkyl chains on the thieno[3,2-b]thiophene in PDPP2T-TTa induce twisting between adjacent units, decreasing the orbital overlap and conjugation. For PDPP4T-TT the low solubility in pure o-DCB required a CV measurement in a mixture of o-DCB and chloroform. Due to reduction of chloroform at negative potentials, only the HOMO level of PDPP4T-TT could be obtained from the CV experiments. The LUMO of PDPP4T-TT was estimated at −3.69 ± 0.03 V from the optical band gap and the HOMO level, correcting for the average difference between Eg,sol and eEg,CV for the other two polymers (ΔEg = 0.06 ± 0.03 eV) (Table 1), to give eELUMO ≈ eEHOMO − Eg,sol − ΔEg. Table 1 also shows the LUMO–LUMO offset α of the polymers and PCBM, with ELUMO(PCBM) = −4.16 eV.25
The pristine polymers were applied in an FET structure to measure their charge carrier mobility. All polymers show ambipolar behaviour (Fig. 3). The transfer curves of PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP2T-TTb are similar and the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe, Table 2) determined from the slope of the square root of source–drain current (|IDS|½) vs. the gate voltage (VG) in the saturation regime are within one order of magnitude. Apparently, the presence of the alkyl side chains does not significantly affect the charge transport properties. The transfer curves of PDPP4T-TT are notably different from the other two and especially μe is lower. At present we do not have an explanation for this fact. The low μe results in a larger on/off ratio at negative gate voltages. For PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP2T-TTbμh and μe are fairly balanced, but the hole mobility of PDPP2T-TTb is less than the value reported for a closely related derivative recently.21 Differences in molecular weight, annealing temperature, morphology and device layout may account for these differences.

Photovoltaic devices
Solar cells were built by spin coating the active layer from a solution of [60]PCBM and the polymer on a sheet of glass, covered with ITO and a layer of PEDOT:PSS. LiF and Al were evaporated in vacuum and served as the reflecting second electrode. Considering the small offset of the work function of PEDOT:PSS (−5.1 eV26) with the HOMO energy levels (∼−5.3 eV) of the new polymers an ohmic contact can be expected at the hole collecting contact, while LiF/Al is known to form a good contact with [60]PCBM for collecting the electrons.27 The composition of the active layer was optimized by varying the polymer:[60]PCBM ratio and the highest efficiencies were obtained using an excess of [60]PCBM (by weight) (Table 3).

Similar to previous reports,28,29 we found that the use of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) as a co-solvent is beneficial in creating a morphology of the active layer that leads to improved performance of the cells. Tapping mode AFM showed that layers processed without DIO contain large (100–200 nm) globular domains of semicrystalline [60]PCBM (Fig. 4a–c), but when a small amount of DIO was added to the mixture of polymer and [60]PCBM in chloroform before the spin coating, the large [60]PCBM clusters disappeared and the length scale of phase separation decreased (Fig. 4d–f). Simultaneously, the power conversion efficiency of the cells increased significantly (Fig. 5). For cells made with PDPP2T-TTb and PDPP4T-TT an optimal performance was found when 25 mg ml−1DIO was added to the chloroform, while cells with PDPP2T-TTa needed only 10 mg ml−1. The marked change in performance when using DIO is a consequence of the change in morphology, which results in an increase in short circuit current density (Fig. 5b) while open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) remain fairly constant. The variation in Voc was less than 5% and FFs were within 20% of the best value. Addition of extra DIO to the spin coating mixture resulted in a reduced performance of the cells as a result of a lower photocurrent.

Height scales are 10 nm (a, c, d, and f), 15 nm (e) and 20 nm (b). 
 Fig. 5  Estimated efficiency (a) and current density (b) as a function of the amount of DIO used in the spin coating mixture. 
The J–V curves and the monochromatic external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the photovoltaic cells are shown in Fig. 6. The relevant parameters are listed in Table 3. For all cells, the FFs are in the same range, despite the fact that the hole mobility of PDPP4T-TT is less than for PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP2T-TTb in an FET. The onsets of the EQEs correspond to the optical band gaps of the polymers, extending up to 900 nm for the cells made with PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP2T-TTb. Fig. 6b shows, however, that for PDPP2T-TTb the EQE reaches only 5% in the region where the polymer absorbs, while for PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP4T-TT the EQE is reaching much higher values of 20% and 35%, respectively. The increase in EQE going from PDPP2T-TTb, viaPDPP2T-TTa, to PDPP4T-TT correlates with the LUMO–LUMO offset energy α (Table 1). The very low EQE for PDPP2T-TTb is consistent with the notion that its LUMO–LUMO offset α = 0.24 eV with [60]PCBM is less than the minimal value of 0.3–0.4 eV that is generally considered to be required for efficient exciton dissociation.30,31 This conclusion is supported for three other high efficiency DPP derivatives, for which relevant parameters are collected in Tables 2 and 3. We note that for the PDPPnT-TT polymers listed in Table 3 the molecular weight (Mn) is less than for the three previously reported DPP polymers (Table 1). Especially for PDPP3T, the influence of Mn on the PCE has been found to be significant and this possibly hampers a straightforward correlation between EQE and α.

Conclusions
Three new polymers based on thieno[3,2-b]thiophene and diketopyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole with a varying number of connecting thiophene units have been synthesized and characterized. The polymers exhibit suitable absorption spectra and energy levels for use as a donor in OPCs. All polymers show ambipolar charge transport with hole mobilities in the 10−2 cm2 V−1s−1 range. The morphology of the active layers and the photovoltaic performance of the resulting OPCs with [60]PCBM as acceptor strongly depend on the use of a co-solvent. The best solar cells exhibited a PCE of 3.4%.
In terms of structure property relations it is interesting to consider that a high PCE in a solar cell can be reached when it effectively converts photons into electrons and does not lose too much energy in this process, i.e. keeping the open-circuit voltage close to the optical band gap. The EQE is a measure for the photon to electron conversion efficiency, while eVoc − Eg measures the energy loss. Previously we have experimentally established that eVoc = Eg − 0.6 eV defines the maximum attainable Voc in organic donor–acceptor solar cells at room temperature under 1 sun illumination because at that point the driving force for electron transfer from the optical band gap to the charge transfer state is becoming very small (∼0.1 eV).24 When Eg − eVoc becomes less than 0.6 eV photoinduced electron transfer is impeded and energy transfer between the donor and acceptor will be favoured but no charges are formed. For PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP2T-TTb in combination with [60]PCBM we find that Eg − eVoc = 0.65–0.68 eV, i.e. very close to the threshold value. Energetically this is favourable for solar energy conversion, but we conjecture that approaching the limit might be a reason for the reduced photon to electron conversion that can be inferred from the lower EQE (Table 3). For PDPP4T-TT:[60]PCBM, Eg − eVoc amounts to 0.87 eV and—reasoning along the same line—this is consistent with its much higher EQE (Table 3). For the three other polymers listed in Table 3, similar arguments explain some of the differences. We note, however, that for these materials the molecular weight is much higher (Table 1), which is known to be favourable for achieving high EQEs, most likely via affecting the blend morphology, size of the domains and charge carrier mobility.17
In conclusion, the new PDPPnT-TT polymers offer promising efficiencies in combination with [60]PCBM. For all polymers the obtained molecular weights are not very high and this is most likely one of the parameters that confines reaching higher PCEs. In addition, for PDPP2T-TTa and PDPP2T-TTb, the photoinduced electron transfer is limited by a low offset between the optical band gap and the energy of the charge transfer state. The design of new materials should therefore concentrate on achieving high molecular weights and creating an energy offset Eg − eVoc that is at least 0.6 eV, but preferably somewhat larger to ensure a high photon to electron quantum yield.
Experimental section
General procedures
All synthetic procedures were performed under an argon atmosphere. Commercial chemicals were used as received. Dry solvents were distilled over 4 Å molecular sieves. 2,5-Dibromo-3,6-di(4′-ethyloctyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (1) and 3,6-bis(5-bromothien-2-yl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-di(2-alkyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrolo-1,4-diones (8 and 9) were synthesized according to literature procedures.9,19,23

1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz and 100 MHz respectively on a VARIAN mercury spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and tetramethylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. The peaks are given in ppm, relative to TMS (0 ppm). Molecular weights were determined with GPC at 80 °C on a PL-GPC 120 system using a PL-GEL 5 μ MIXED-C column and o-DCB as the eluent.

Optical absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer Lambda 900 UV/vis/near-IR spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded with a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1 under an inert atmosphere with 1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in o-DCB as the electrolyte. The working electrode was a platinum disk and the counter electrode was silver rod. The concentration of the samples in the electrolyte was approximately 2 mM, based on monomers. Fc/Fc+ was used as internal standard.
Field-effect transistors were fabricated using heavily doped silicon wafers as the common gate electrode with a 200 nm thermally oxidized SiO2 layer as the gate dielectric. Using conventional photolithography, gold source and drain electrodes were defined in a bottom contact device configuration with channel width and length of 10 μm and 2500 μm, respectively. A 10 nm layer of titanium was used acting as an adhesion layer for the gold on SiO2. The SiO2 layer was exposed to the vapour of the primer hexamethyldisilazane for 60 min. prior to semiconductor deposition in order to passivate the surface of the dielectric. Polymer films were spun from a chloroform solution at 1500 rpm for 30 s. Freshly prepared devices were annealed in a dynamic vacuum of 10−5 mbar at 100 °C for 72 h to remove traces of solvent. All electrical measurements were performed in a vacuum using an HP 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer.
Photovoltaic devices were processed on cleaned patterned ITO glass substrates. A mixed solution of polymer and [60]PCBM (Solenne BV) in a weight ratio as indicated in Table 3 was spin coated from chloroform with the appropriate amount of DIO on 50 nm of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083, H.C. Starck). The devices were transported into a glovebox with nitrogen atmosphere. LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were thermally evaporated on top of the active layer at a pressure of 10−7 mbar. The devices had an active area of 0.091 cm2 which is determined by the overlap of the ITO and the evaporated aluminium. Current–voltage curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter under nitrogen in the dark and under simulated solar illumination of 100 mW cm−2 created by white light from a tungsten-halogen lamp, filtered by a Schott GG385 UV filter and a Hoya LB120 daylight filter. The EQE was measured with a Stanford Research Systems Model SR830 DSP lock-in-amplifier by using modulated monochromatic light from a tungsten halogen lamp in combination with a monochromator (Oriel, Cornerstone 130). During the measurement the device was operating at 1 equivalent sun intensity by use of a bias laser (532 nm). A calibrated Si cell was used as a reference. The device was kept behind a quartz window in a nitrogen filled container. The thickness of the active layers in the photovoltaic devices was measured on a Veeco Dektak150 profilometer. Tapping mode AFM was measured on a MFP-3D (Asylum research) using PPP-NCHR probes (Nanosensors).

          PDPP2T-TTa
        
To a degassed solution of 2,5-di(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaboralan-2-yl)-3,6-di(4′-ethyloctyl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (2) (27 mg, 40 μmol), 3,6-bis(5-bromo-2-thienyl)-2,5-dihydro-2,5-di(2′-hexyldecyl)-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrolo-1,4-dione (8) (28 mg, 40 μmol), 50% aliquat solution (v/v) in toluene (0.3 ml), K3PO4 (18 mg, 84 μmol), of triphenlyphosphine (2.0 mg, 2.1 μmol) and water (0.1 ml) in toluene (2 ml), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) (2 mg, 1.7 μmol) was added. This mixture was stirred at 105 °C for 3 days, after which it was precipitated in methanol. The solids were filtered off, redissolved in CHCl3 (75 ml) and refluxed with 28% NH3 solution in water (75 ml) for 3 h. The layers were separated and the organic layer was stirred with EDTA (250 mg) overnight, after which water (100 ml) was added and the liquids were stirred for 1 h. The layers were separated and the organic layer was reduced in volume by evaporating most of the chloroform. The polymer was precipitated in methanol and filtered through a Soxhlet thimble. The polymer was extracted with methanol, after which the thimble was allowed to dry in ambient conditions. Then the polymer was extracted with hexane and chloroform. The solvent from the chloroform fraction was evaporated and the solid was precipitated in methanol. The polymer was collected by filtering over a 0.45 μm PTFE membrane filter and dried in a vacuum oven to yield PDPP2T-TTa (21 mg, 56%) as a dark green powder. 1H NMR: 9.15 (b, 2H), 7.26 (b, 2h), 4.08 (b, 4H), 2.95 (b, 4H), 2.70 (b, 2H), 1.97 (b, 4H), 1.75 (b, 4H), 1.5–1.1 (b, 34H), 0.95–0.8 (b, 24H). GPC: Mn = 13000 g mol−1, PDI = 2.5. Soxhlet extraction using o-dichlorobenzene to selectively extract higher molecular weight polymer fractions resulted in degradation of the polymer at the increased temperature (180 °C).
