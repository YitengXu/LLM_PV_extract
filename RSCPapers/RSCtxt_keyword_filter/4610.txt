    , Accepted 21st May 2020First published on 23rd May 2020AbstractThe tin (Sn)-based halide perovskites have attracted tremendous attention as a lead-free alternative in halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Inorganic cesium tin triiodide (CsSnI3) provides a promising solution to solve the poor thermal stability of Sn-based halide perovskite. However, CsSnI3-based PSCs suffer from intrinsic defects such as the easy Sn2+/Sn4+ oxidation and the unbalanced rates between crystal nucleation and growth during film fabrication, leading to an inferior performance. Herein, a vacuum flash-assisted solution processing (VASP) method is utilized to fabricate a high-quality CsSnI3 film for the first time. Compared with the CsSnI3 film fabricated by the spin-coating route, the VASP CsSnI3 film shows an increased surface coverage, enhanced charge carrier mobility, improved film stability, and reduced background charge carrier density. These changes in turn facilitate the charge carrier transport and reduce the trap-assisted recombination in the VASP PSCs. As a consequence, the VASP PSCs show greatly improved efficiency. Moreover, the VASP PSCs show a continuously increasing efficiency as a function of storage time. After they are stored for 180 days, a PCE of 3.8% is achieved, which is also one of the state-of-the-art performances for inorganic CsSnI3-based PSCs.
Introduction
With the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) boosted from 3.8% to 25.2% over the past ten years, halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising candidates for the next generation of photovoltaic technologies.1 Today, the effective halide perovskites all contain the toxic Pb.2,3 For large-scale commercialization of PSCs, during their whole product life-cycle, even with a rigorous industrial hygiene program and strict encapsulation of the solar cell module, Pb2+ could still leak out into the environment.4 Therefore, replacement of Pb2+ by low toxic elements such as Sn2+, Sb3+, Bi3+, or Ge2+ is quite imperative.5,6 Among these Pb-free perovskite candidates, Sn-based perovskite has attracted great attention, due to its excellent opto-electrical properties, such as a narrow bandgap (1.2 to 1.4 eV),7 high charge carrier mobility (585 cm−2 V−1 s−1),8 long charge diffusion length (1 μm),9etc. So far, the highly efficient Sn-based PSCs have been based on formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) and methylammonium tin triiodide (MASnI3). However, the organic components (MA+ and FA+) cause intrinsic volatility and poor thermal stability. With the substitution of the organic component by inorganic cesium cation, cesium tin triiodide (CsSnI3) perovskite showed a significantly improved stability, which has already been proven in the solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells.10 Based on an ideal perovskite crystal, a theoretical PCE of 23% has been predicted for CsSnI3-based PSCs, which highlights their application potential.11 Unfortunately, there are two obstacles hindering the fabrication of highly efficient CsSnI3-based PSCs:12 (i) the self-doping effect caused by the facile oxidation of Sn2+ to Sn4+, which leads to a high background charge carrier density; several additives such as SnF2, SnI2, and SnCl2 have to be added into perovskite films for suppressing Sn2+/Sn4+ oxidation as well as acting as a Sn2+ compensator.13 (ii) The unbalanced crystal nucleation rate and crystal growth rate in the film fabrication with the conventional spin-coating method make it difficult to fabricate a compact film. One important lesson learned from Pb-based PSCs is that optimization of perovskite fabrication techniques can effectively increase the film performance. Therefore, more fabrication methods need to be developed to obtain high-quality CsSnI3 film. The vacuum flash-assisted solution processing (VASP) method, through controlled solvent removal under vacuum, thereby boosting a rapid crystallization of the perovskite precursor, has been successfully utilized in Pb-based PSCs.14 In this work, we utilized the VASP method to fabricate high-quality CsSnI3 perovskite film for the first time via kinetically balanced rates between crystal nucleation and growth. Compared with the perovskite film that was fabricated by the conventional one-step spin-coating method, the VASP film showed dramatically reduced pin-hole numbers and size, decreased background charge density, and enhanced film stability against moisture. As a result, the VASP PSCs showed a greatly improved performance. Moreover, the VASP PSCs showed a continuously increasing efficiency as a function of storage time. After they were stored for 180 days, a PCE of 3.8% was achieved in the Pb-free PSCs.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows the basic steps of the CsSnI3 film fabrication using the VASP method. First, the Sn-based perovskite precursor was spin-coated on cleaned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass, and then the substrate was immediately transferred into a sample chamber, which was connected to a vacuum tank. Opening the valve between them, the chamber was pumped to 60 Pa immediately. After 5 s, the colour of the CsSnI3 sample changed from yellow to black. After 40 s, the substrate was moved out from the chamber and annealed at 60 °C for 10 min. To understand the mechanism of CsSnI3 film growth via the VASP method and spin-coating method, here, we used the Lamer model to explain the crystal nucleation and growth processes.15,16 After the sample was transferred to the low-pressure chamber, the solvent was continuously evaporated, so the precursor concentration was increased to the saturation concentration (Cs, stage 0 → Cs). At this stage, there were no nuclei generated since the energy barrier for nucleus formation needed to be overcome. Once the minimum concentration (Cmin) for nucleation was reached, the crystal nuclei started to form and grow. With the solvent continuously evaporating, the precursor concentration kept on increasing, and thus the nucleation rate continuously increased. On the other hand, the crystal nucleus generation/growth reduced the amount of precursor; thereby, the precursor concentration was reduced, so the nucleation speed tended to decrease when it reached the maximal concentration (Cmax), and then it kept on reducing to Cmin (stage Cmin → Cmax → Cmin). At this stage, the crystal nucleation and growth occurred at the same time; moreover, the crystal nucleation process mainly occurred before the concentration reached Cmax. The interplay of continuous solvent evaporation and perovskite formation finally resulted in a steady-state concentration that lay between Cmin and Cs (stage Cmin → Cs). In this last stage, there were no further nuclei generated; the existing crystals continued to grow and merged with neighbouring crystals. Under the VASP method, the precursor concentration was abruptly increased to Cmax because of the fast removal of solvent, thus a high crystal nucleation density can be obtained in stage Cmin → Cmax → Cmin.

The morphology and crystal phase of the CsSnI3 films were studied by scanning electron micrography (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization, as shown in Fig. 2. For the VASP film, the pin-hole size and numbers were dramatically reduced. It showed a compact texture with a similar grain size in the range of hundreds of nanometers. We would like to note that the grain size was not a decisive parameter to determine device performance, since decent device performance had been reported based on either large or small perovskite grains.17,18 The pin-hole density determined the film surface area that was exposed to the environment; thus, an improved stability was expected from the VASP film method. Fig. 2b shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films fabricated by different methods; both films displayed an orthorhombic (pnam) structure of the CsSnI3 B-γ phase.19,20 For the control film, the dominant diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 14.4°, 20.2°, 23.0°, 25.1°, 29.1°, and 32.6°, were assigned to the planes (020)/(101), (200)(121), (201)/(102), (220)/(022), (202), and (103)/(141), respectively; and for the VASP film, it showed a preferred crystalline facet orientation. There were only four dominant diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 14.4°, 20.2°, 23.0°, and 29.1°; in addition, the intensity of the diffraction peak at a 2θ value of 14.4° was much stronger than that of the control film. The crystal orientation was associated with the ordered atom arrangement, thus facilitated charge transport was expected within the VASP film.21

It is well known that the black phase B-γ-CsSnI3 will be oxidized in terms of tin atoms and degraded into Cs2SnI6 in ambient air. The absorption coefficient of Cs2SnI6 in the visible region was much lower than that of B-γ-CsSnI3.22 Consequently, the evolution of ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy as a function of time can be used as an effective method to characterize the film stability. The VASP film showed greatly improved film stability compared to that of the control film (Fig. 3), which could be explained by the compact VASP film preventing the diffusion of moisture from the film surface to the inside. For the absorbance at 450 nm, the VASP film retained 95.0% of its initial efficiency after 100 min, while the control film retained only 85.5% under ambient air.

To reveal the effect of the preferred facet orientation on the electronic properties of the perovskite films, we fabricated a hole-only device with the configuration: ITO/2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. Spiro-OMeTAD was used as the buffer layer to form a quasi-ohmic contact between the perovskite layer and the electrodes. The current–voltage (I–V) curves (Fig. S1, ESI†) can be divided into three distinguished regions: (i) the ohmic region at low voltage, which can be confirmed by the linear I–V relation (I ∝ Vn, n = 1); (ii) the trap-filled limit region as the applied voltage increased, which can be identified by the rapid non-linear rise of the current (I ∝ Vn, n > 3); and (iii) the space charge limited current (SCLC) region (I ∝ Vn, n = 2) as the applied voltage increased to around 1 V. The hole trap density can be calculated using eqn (1)23,24 (1)where nt is the trap density, ε is the relative permittivity (48.2 is adopted for CsSnI325), ε0 is the permittivity of free space (8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), VTFL is the trap-filled limit (TFL) voltage (0.36 V for the VASP device and 0.26 V for the control device, extracted from the I–V curves, Fig. S1, ESI†), e is the elementary charge (1.6 × 10−19 J), and d is the thickness of the perovskite layer. The trap density of the control film was estimated at 8.3 × 1016 cm−3, which was consistent with the literature value (∼1017 cm−3) obtained with Hall measurement.8 The VASP CsSnI3 film showed a reduced background trap density, which was estimated at 6.2 × 1016 cm−3.
This reduced background charge carrier density in the VASP film could be induced by the suppressed Sn2+/Sn4+ oxidation process, which was confirmed by the XPS measurement: the proportion of Sn2+ species on the surface of the VASP film was higher than that in the control film (Fig. S2, ESI†). The hole mobility can be evaluated in the SCLC regime according to the Mott–Gurney eqn (2)26 (2)where JSCLC is the current density, V is the applied voltage, L is the thickness of the active layer, and μ is the charge carrier mobility. The hole mobility of the control film was estimated at 0.8 cm−2 V−1 s−1, which agreed well with the literature report (∼1 cm−2 V−1 s−1).27 The VASP CsSnI3 film showed a higher hole mobility, which was estimated at 1.3 cm−2 V−1 s−1, due to the preferred crystal orientation in the VASP film.
To reveal how the morphological and crystallographic changes influence the photovoltaic behaviour, hole transport material (HTM)-free devices with the configuration ITO/CsSnI3/C60/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag were fabricated. The VASP PSCs showed improved photovoltaic behaviour with respect to the control PSCs; the champion VASP PSC showed a PCE of 2.0%, with a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 12.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.41 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 38.6%; while the control device gave only a champion PCE of 1.1%, with a Jsc of 7.9 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.37 V, and a FF of 38.0% (Fig. 4a and Table S1, ESI†). And the Jsc values were confirmed by external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurement, as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The improved morphology and the preferred crystal orientation of the VASP film could facilitate the charge carrier transport, thus, the Jsc was increased in the VASP PSCs. We further studied the dependence of Voc on varied incident light intensities (20–100 mW cm−2) to gain more insight about the working mechanisms, as shown in Fig. 4b. The semilogarithmic light intensity (I) versus Voc curves usually have a linear relationship following eqn (3)28 Voc ∝ (kBT/e)ln(I)(3)where kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. If the trap-assisted recombination dominates in the PSCs, the slope of Vocversus ln(I) is equal to 2kT/q, and if bimolecular recombination dominates in the devices, the slope of Vocversus ln(I) is close to kT/q. In our study, the VASP PSCs exhibited a lower slope of Vocversus ln(I), implying that trap-assisted recombination losses were reduced compared to those of the control PSCs, and this reduction led to the improved Voc in the VASP PSCs.

All the cells were stored inside a glove box (O2 < 1 ppm and H2O < 1 ppm) to test their device durability as a function of time. After one month, the control cells almost lost their photovoltaic characteristics, while the VASP PSCs showed improved performance compared with the fresh devices (Fig. 5). When the cells were continuously stored in a nitrogen glovebox, there was further PCE improvement for the VASP cells; it increased from the initial 2.0% up to 3.8% after storage for 180 days (while the control cells completely lost their photovoltaic characteristics); in more details, Jsc and FF continuously increased (Fig. 6), due to the gradual adjustment of the crystal structure to its optimal phase.29 A similar PCE increasing trend was also reported in other studies on Sn-based PSCs, i.e., Nishimura et al. reported that the two-dimensional (2D) cation-doped (FA0.75MA0.25)SnI3 PSCs achieved the highest PCE after storage for 5 days.30 Jokar et al. reported that the 2D cation-doped FASnI3 PSCs achieved the highest PCE after storage for 2000 h (83 days).31 However, the improved stability reported here is much greater than that of any other Sn-based PSCs reported in the literature.

Conclusions
In summary, the VASP method was firstly introduced to fabricate high-quality inorganic CsSnI3 perovskite films. It was found that the VASP CsSnI3 films showed improved film morphology via a kinetic balance between the crystal nucleation and growth, enhanced charge carrier mobility due to the preferred facet orientation of the perovskite film, and reduced background charge carrier density. These improvements in turn facilitated the charge carrier transport and reduced the trap-assisted recombination in PSCs, thus the VASP PSCs showed greatly improved efficiency. Moreover, the VASP PSCs showed a continuously increasing efficiency in a timescale of six months, due to the slow passivation of film defects and the gradual adjusting of crystal structure. Up to now, Sn-based PSCs were usually assumed to be fairly unstable because of the easy oxidation of Sn2+/Sn4+; however, our work found that with a moderate fabrication method, the long-term stability of Sn-based PSCs can be developed.

Preparation of perovskite film
CsSnI3:10% SnCl2 (molar ratio) was used as reducing agent to reduce the background hole density in all CsSnI3 perovskite films. The CsSnI3 perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by dissolving 52 mg of CsI, 74.4 mg of SnI2, and 3.8 mg of SnCl2 (1:1:0.1 molar ratio) in 850 μL of DMF and 150 μL of DMSO. To deposit CsSnI3 perovskite film with the conventional one-step spin-coating method (control film), 80 μL of precursor solution was first spin-coated onto the ITO substrate (2.5 × 2.5 cm2) at 2000 rpm for 60 s. Then, the samples were annealed at 60 °C for 10 min.
Preparation of PSCs
ITO glass samples were ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water each for 15 min, and UV-treated for 15 min before use. C60 was deposited by thermal evaporation at 380 °C at a rate of 0.2 to 0.3 Å s−1 with a thickness of 23 nm. BCP was thermally evaporated at 140 °C at a rate of 0.1 Å s−1 with a thickness of 8 nm. Ag was thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.3 to 1 Å s−1 with a thickness of 100 nm. The effective area of the device was 0.1 cm2.

0.05 g of spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 498 mL of chlorobenzene. Then, 18 μL of tBP, 10 μL of LiTFSI stock solution (520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile), and 8 μL of FK 209 Co(III) TFSI stock solution (300 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) were added into the solution. The Spiro-OMeTAD layer was deposited via spin-coating at the speed of 1800 rpm for 30 s. The Au electrode was thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.5 to 1 Å s−1 with a thickness of 100 nm. The effective area of the device was 0.1 cm2.

XRD patterns of the fresh perovskite films were recorded using X-ray diffractometry (Bruker D8-advance) with Cu Kα radiation and the following parameters: 2θ range 10 to 40°, and 0.02° step scan. UV-Vis absorption spectra of perovskite films were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 spectrometer. SEM images were recorded by using a high-resolution field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The I–V characteristics of the PSCs were characterized by using a solar simulator (PEC-L11 AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2) equipped with a Keithley 2400. All the I–V tests were performed in a nitrogen glovebox.
