1. Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are scientifically interesting and industrially important compounds. Chalcogenides, that is S, Se, and Te (VI A group), create very stable binary compounds with transition elements forming layered crystalline structures especially with transition metals of groups IV–VII B. Their layered structure resembles that of graphite with weak van der Waals interactions between the individual layers. The crystal structure varies from the hexagonal P63/mmc for molybdenite (MoS2) and tungstenite (WS2) to the orthorhombic structure Pmn21, as for MoTe2 and WTe2, giving rise to dramatic anisotropy and different material properties (see Fig. 1). Such properties are of industrial importance. For example, due to their layered structure, MoS2 and WS2 can be employed as dry lubricants able to withstand higher temperatures than graphite.1 Layered transition metal dichalcogenides are compounds of the general formula MX2 where M is a transition element of groups IV B (Ti, Zr, Hf), V B (V, Nb, Ta), VI B (Mo, W), and VII B (Tc, Re) and X is a chalcogen atom of the VI A group (S, Se, Te). VIII B group elements create dichalcogenides, which in some cases are partially layered in structure (Co, Ni, Rh, Pd, Ir, Pt). Unlike pristine graphene, which is a semimetal with a zero band gap, TMDs exhibit a variable band gap between 0 (semimetal) and 2 eV (semiconducting) depending on the elemental combination, the number of layers, and the presence or lack of a doping atom. TMDs exhibit well-defined structures, unlike doped graphene, which loses its crystalline structure when covalently doped to tune its bandgap, effectively creating a poorly defined amorphous graphenoid material.2 Tuning of the band gap is important for electronic, electrochemical, and optical applications of these layered binary materials. Layered TMDs also possess catalytic properties, which can easily be tuned with selective doping. For example, MoS2 doped with Co or Ni is used in the petrochemical industry for hydrodesulfurization processes.3,4
 Fig. 1  Crystal structure of layered transition metal chalcogenides. Upper structures correspond to layered hexagonal structure (P63/mmc symmetry group; red atoms – Mo and W; blue atoms – S and Se). Bottom structures correspond to layered orthorombic structure (Pmn21 symmetry group; green atoms – Mo and W; red atoms – Te). 
MoS2 is found as the mineral molybdenite (mined i.e., in Norway, Australia, and North America). Some other TMDs are known from nature: WS2 (tungstenite), MoSe2 (drysdallite), and ReS2 (rheniite). However, only molybdenite, which is the main source of molybdenum, is found in nature in large amounts. Molybdenite can form large crystals in some types of geological formations (for example, granite pegmatite veins, cracks in granite and granodiorite, quartz–MoS2–Bi veins, Sn–W greisen veins, Sn–Cu greisen veins, and disseminated porphyry with Cu–Mo and Mo mineralization). Naturally occurring crystals of MoS2 are of sufficient quality for basic research applications. The natural crystals of molybdenite and tungstenite are shown in Fig. 2. The layered structure of TMDs offers the possibility of preparing well-defined ultra-thin structures and, ultimately, single layers, which possess remarkably different electronic properties than those of their counterpart bulk materials. Such tunable properties make them ideal materials for electronic or electrochemical devices. With increasing interest in layered TMDs from the research community, we wish to provide a focused minireview on the representative past efforts made in the use of layered TMDs in electrochemical applications. We will describe the electrochemical applications of layered TMDs from bulk materials to single-layer sheets, hoping to provide not only a brief introduction of the topic to chemists and material scientists who are new to the field but also a useful description of the key papers for the experts. Excellent and more specialized review articles are also available for readers interested in the structure and interfacial properties of bulk TMDs,5 the use of TMDs for lithium ion batteries,6 general material properties of nanosized TMDs,7 and their use in energy storage and conversion devices.8,9

2. Preparation methods
Prior to discussing the electrochemistry of layered TMDs, we wish to briefly mention the methods used for their preparation (Fig. 3). The layered structure of TMDs suggests that methods similar to those used in the preparation of graphene can be used for preparing TMD thin layers. The methods are based on “top-down” and “bottom-up” procedures. The “top-down” procedures include mechanical exfoliation of bulk TMDs. This has similar limitations as those encountered in graphene fabrication: while it is not scalable, large sheets of high-quality, single-layer material can be obtained. Large quantities of few-layer TMDs can be prepared by lithium intercalation methods with consequent exfoliation of bulk TMDs. Lithium intercalation is performed using organometallic compounds of lithium (like butyllithium) in MoS2 and WS2.10 WS2 was prepared by unzipping WS2 nanotubes using n-butyllithium in hexane.11 Another strategy for lithium intercalation is to use TMD as a cathode for electrochemical reduction and subsequent intercalation of metallic lithium.12 Mechanical exfoliation using ultrasonic exfoliation in various solvents are also suitable methods for large-scale production of single-layer and few-layer TMDs.13,14 This method was successfully applied for MoS2, WS2, WSe2, MoSe2 and many others.12,14,15 Methods based on “bottom-up” procedures can be employed for the synthesis of single- and few-layered films as well as for bulk powders. Ultra-high quality monolayer MoS2 has been prepared by solid–vapor deposition.16 A different strategy is the decomposition of tetrathiomolybdate and subsequent reduction of MoS3 to MoS2.17 For the CVD deposition of TMD, sufficiently volatile precursors must be used. Typical examples are halogens and oxo-halogens of Mo and W. As the sulfur source, thiols or dialkyl sulfides and dialkyl selenides18–21 are usually used. The bulk synthesis of TMD nanostructures is based on the reaction of sulfur precursors (such as Na2S, CH3CSNH2, NH2CSNH2, KSCN) with molybdate ions.22 Another strategy for the “bottom-up” synthesis of TMDs is based on the thermal decomposition and subsequent reduction of thiomolybdates or thiotungstenates under hydrothermal conditions.15

3. Electrochemical properties
3.1. Photoelectrochemistry
Interesting photoelectrochemical properties were found in thin films of MoS2 and MoSe2. Ultrathin MoS2 sheets (thickness of 39 nm) were found to exhibit poor heterogeneous electron transfer (HET) rates (low k0) and low faradic currents in dark environments for non-aqueous electrochemistry in acetonitrile. Upon white light irradiation, the HET rates increased dramatically for all tested compounds such as decamethylferrocene and tetrachlorobenzoquinone, tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ), and tetramethylphenylenediamine (TMPD).23 Similar photoelectrochemical behavior was observed for MoSe2 bulk materials (see Fig. 4).24 Photoelectrochemical oxidation of Cl− and Br− on bulk MoS2 and WS2 in the production of Cl2 and Br2 was investigated. Platinized TMD showed enhanced performance than did bare layered MoS2 and WS2.25 It was shown theoretically and experimentally that there are qualitative differences in the photoelectrochemistry of bulk and nanostructured MoS2.26

3.2. Hydrogen evolution reaction
Layered TMDs are immensely popular as catalysts in electrochemical hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs).27 It was contended that the edge planes of MoS2 are the active sites for HER.28 It was found that the current density during HER scales directly with exposed edge sites of MoS2 (ref. 29) and that changing the dimensions of MoS2 from bulk sizes to single-layer structures leads to special surface properties that can greatly improve material HER performance.26,30
It was shown that a metallic single layer 1T-MoS2 polymorph exhibits highly favorable HER properties.31 Doping bulk MoS2 with other transition metals was found to tune the reduction potential towards H+.32 MoS2 was found to be beneficial as an electrode material for HER in microbial electrolysis cells to replace Pt.33 Few-layer MoS2 sheets were synthesized on carbon nanospheres and used for HER.34 In order to combine the catalytic properties of MoS2 nanostructured materials with the favorable electrical properties of carbon materials, systems with enhanced performance have recently been obtained by synthesizing MoS2 nanostructures over carbon nanotubes35 and graphene.36 Specifically, the solvothermal synthesis of MoS2 in the presence of reduced graphene generated a composite with a high concentration of edge-plane structures of MoS2, which generated an overpotential as small as ∼0.1 V.36
MoS2 nanoparticles (of 1.47 nm) were deposited on an Au electrode and exhibited favorable HER properties.37 In another work, MoS2 deposited on 3D Ni foam was reported to be highly efficient in HER.38 Core–shell MoO3–MoS2 nanotube arrays exhibited highly efficient hydrogen evolution due to the high surface area.39 Research on hydrogen evolution is theoretically well supported. It was shown that MoS2 exhibits much more favorable reaction coordinates for H2 evolution than do many other catalysts and is similar to those of the hydrogenase and nitrogenase enzymes (Fig. 5).40 MoS3 particles (non-layered structure) were shown to demosntrate lower reduction potentials (that is, more favourable) than MoS2 microcrystals.41 In depth review on the HER on MoS2 can be found in ref. 42. Strained single-sheet WS2 were prepared by chemical exfoliation and exhibited very high catalytic activty towards HER.43 MoS2 can act as an enhancer of photocatalyst efficiency. CdSe nanoribbons are photocatalytic materials capable of induction of H2 evolution from aqueous solution. When MoS2 was linked to CdSe nanoribbons, the efficiency of the composite material increased about 4 times due to the participation of MoS2 in hydrogen reduction. Interestingly, CdSe–Pt hybrids showed lower performance than CdSe–MoS2 hybrids.44

The free energy of H+ + e− is by definition the same as that of 1/2H2 under standard conditions. The free energy of H atoms bound to different catalysts is then found by calculating the free energy with respect to molecular hydrogen including zero-point energies and entropy terms.

3.3. Capacitive behaviour
Since MoS2 has a layered structure similar to graphite, it exhibits two key crystal features: a basal plane and an edge plane. The edge plane of MoS2 has been found to be more electroactive. To create a surface with high-energy storage capacity, edge-oriented nanowall films were fabricated by chemical vapor deposition (Fig. 6). It was found that MoS2 nanowall films exhibited excellent supercapacitor properties, similar to those of carbon nanotubes.45 Spray painting of MoS2 with consequent laser patterning was developed for the construction of micro-supercapacitors which exhibited the high area capacitance of 8 mF cm−2.46 Recently, porous tubular C/MoS2 composites have been fabricated using an anodic aluminum oxide film as a template. The capacitor assembled using this nanocomposite material exhibited good gravimetric capacitance of 210 mF g−1 and excellent cycling stability.47

3.4. Batteries
Layered TMDs, especially MoS2, is used in lithium batteries as anodes. It was shown that hollow MoS2 particles have better stability than do solid MoS2 nanoparticles.48 MoS2 composites layered with graphene exhibited highly stable cycling performance and a high specific capacity of ∼1100 mA h g−1 at a current of 100 mA g−1 (ref. 49) and 350 mA h g−1 at a current of 2000 mA g−1.50 Three-dimensional MoS2 flower-like nanoarchitectures anchored on graphene layers were prepared via the hydrothermal route. Such MoS2 nanoflowers resulted in the highly spaced MoS2 nanosheets (spacing 13.8 A, compared to bulk MoS2 with a spacing of 6.2 A), which was useful for the intercalation of Li+ ions. This material has a capacity of 813.5 mA h g−1 at a current density of 1000 mA g−1. It was found that it was possible to achieve a specific capacity of 600 mA h g−1 even at a high current density of 4000 mA g−1.51 An interesting approach was employed to provide sulfur in lithium–sulfur batteries. To avoid the instability of Li2S, a mixture of elemental Li and MoS2 was electrochemically converted to Li2S and elemental Mo. The authors claim that the resulting cell has very high stability.52 In a manner similar to ref. 50, where MoS2 and graphene were utilized, composites of MoS2 with single-walled carbon nanotubes and MoS2 nanorods coated by amorphous carbon exhibited very high capacity in Li batteries: 992 mA h g−1 (ref. 53) and 621 mA h g−1.54 Mesoporous WS2 was also used as an electrode in Li batteries.55 MoS2/carbon composites are used in rechargeable Mg batteries.56 The layered structure of bulk MoS2 was found to be an attractive material for novel Na+ batteries.57
3.5. Solar cells
TMDs can play several roles in solar cell energy conversion. The TiO2 used in solar cells can be sensitized by WS2 nanosheets, resulting in much better performance than non-sensitized TiO2.58 The authors found that the S–W–S layers of WS2 are not perfectly aligned in the direction of the c-axis, emphasizing the role of lateral electron transfer. Another way to sensitize TiO2 is the use of organic dyes.59 WS2 has been found to be very useful for replacement of Pt in dye-sensitized solar cells.60 A MoS2/graphene nanocomposite was used as a counter electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells with high power conversion efficiency of >6%.61
In such cases, TMDs are used as replacements of the limiting factor of such cells, the counter electrode, which typically uses a Pt catalyst on a conductive support. MoS2 films on a carbon support were suggested as Pt-free counter electrodes in dye-sensitized solar cells.62 Similarly, MoS2 nanosheets were deposited on multiwall carbon nanotubes and used as a replacement for Pt in solar cells.63
3.6. Other electrochemical energy applications
Electrochemical hydrogen storage in MoS2 nanotubes was reported, up to 0.97 wt% of H2.64 Such adsorption was reported from the electrochemical reduction of water according to eqn (1) (1)
Later, the same authors improved the hydrogen storage capacity by up to 1.2 wt% by treating MoS2 nanotubes with KOH. It should be noted that as a control material, polycrystalline MoS2 was used and exhibited a hydrogen storage capacity of <0.3 wt%.65
4. Conclusions
Layered transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit tunable band gap properties, interesting photoelectrochemistry, and versatile applications for hydrogen reduction, supercapacitors, batteries, and solar cells. Layered TMDs exhibit a crystalline structure and their electrochemical properties can be tuned by exchanging transition metal or chalcogenide atoms. It can be expected that there will be a dramatic increase in the number of applications of these two-dimensional materials in electrochemistry.

Authors' collection.	 

 	Fig. 3  Synthetic routes for fabrication of single layer TMD. (A) Exfoliation by intercalation of lithium; (B) opening of WS2 nanotube and (C) vapor deposition. Reprinted from ref. 11, 12 and 16 with permission.	 

 	Fig. 4  Photoelectrochemistry on MoS2 and MoSe2. (I) Cyclic voltammogram of 1.0 mM ferrocene/0.10 M TBAP in acetonitrile at 20 mV s−1. Working electrodes: (A) Pt; (B) TiO2/Ti in the dark, (C) TiO2/Ti under white illumination; (D) MoS2 thin film in the dark; and (E) MoS2 thin film under white illumination. (II) Comparison of cyclic voltammetry for TMPD at Pt and MoSe2 (dark and illuminated and illumination discontinued at the anodic limit). Illumination was with 632.8 nm light at 50 mW cm−2. Reprinted from ref. 23 and 24 with permission.	 

 	Fig. 5  Calculated free energy diagram for hydrogen evolution at a potential U = 0 relative to the standard hydrogen electrode at pH = 0. The free energy of H+ + e− is by definition the same as that of 1/2H2 under standard conditions. The free energy of H atoms bound to different catalysts is then found by calculating the free energy with respect to molecular hydrogen including zero-point energies and entropy terms. Reprinted with permission from ref. 40.	 

 	Fig. 6  SEM images of edge-oriented MoS2 nanowall films, deposited by single source precursor CVD at (a) 550 °C and (b) 650 °C. (c) TEM image showing triangular nanosheets; and (d) SEM image of carbon nanotube array electrode used for comparison. Reprinted from ref. 45 with permission.
