    , Accepted 24th July 2013First published on 24th July 2013AbstractThe commonly used donor material poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) confines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) in P3HT-based polymer solar cells due to its relatively large bandgap of ∼1.9 eV and the resultant limited absorption wavelength region of less than 650 nm. In this communication, the highly efficient up-conversion (UC) material NaYF4:2% Er3+, 18% Yb3+, converting near-infrared radiation into green and red emissions, is introduced into a P3HT/P3HT:[6,6] phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) bulk heterojunction solar cell, referred to as a “bilayer cell”, to compensate for the non-absorbable wavelength region of P3HT. With an optimal UC doping concentration of 11.7% (weight ratio of UC to P3HT) in the P3HT matrix, the short-circuit current density and PCE for UC-doped bilayer cell are as high as 10.89 mA cm−2 and 3.62%, about 16.6% and 10.7% higher than the P3HT/P3HT:PC61BM bilayer cell and 22.4% and 16.4% higher than the standard P3HT:PC61BM bulk heterojunction one, respectively, although the fill factor in the UC-doped bilayer cell shows a slight decrease. The research result demonstrates that both the emission and the scattering of UC nanoparticles are beneficial to the enhancement of the solar cell's electrical performances.
Introduction
Recently, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have been quickly developed with power conversion efficiencies even exceeding 10%.1,2 One key problem that confines the efficiency enhancement is the wide band gap of donors, ∼1.8–2 eV, resulting in an absorption region mainly in the visible range. To effectively harvest and better exploit the near-infrared (NIR) radiation of the solar energy, various strategies like tandem structure,3–5 where polymers with absorption in the visible and NIR parts of the solar spectrum are adopted and the addition of NIR dyes into active layers have been taken in some OPVs.6–9 Up-conversion (UC) material is another good choice due to its harvest ability of the NIR part of solar light. UC is a nonlinear luminescence process whereby two or more low energy photons (>900 nm) are converted to one high energy photon (<750 nm), which has attracted significant attention for potential application in solar cells and biological imaging.10–18 The most efficient UC materials are lanthanide ions, which have been extensively investigated since the first report by Auzel in the 1960s.16 Er3+,Yb3+-codoped sodium yttrium fluoride (NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+), converting NIR radiation of about 980 nm to green (525 and 550 nm) and red (650 nm) emissions, is one of the most promising NIR-to-visible UC material. In practical application, the hexagonal (β) phase of NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ is strongly preferred to the cubic (α) one, being 10 and 4.4 times higher than the α phase in green and red emissions, respectively.19 Therefore, β-NaYF4:Er3+,Yb3+ is an excellent UC material and its emission wavelength, especially highly efficient green emission, is located in the main absorption region of some donor polymers, e.g. poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and poly[N-9′-hepta-decanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4′,7′-di-2-thienyl-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole) (PCDTBT).20
The concept of utilizing an up-converter to harvest the NIR part of solar radiation and then convert it into the visible light that can be absorbed by some semiconductors is widely reported in inorganic solar cells but rarely reported in OPVs. However, the performance enhancement in these inorganic solar cells is tiny. For example, Gibart et al. in 1996 first reported an ultrathin substrate-free GaAs solar cell on top of a 100 μm thick vitroceramic codoped with Yb3+ and Er3+.21,22 Under excitation of 25.64 W cm−2 with a 1.39 eV Ti-sapphire IR laser, an efficiency of 2.5% was observed. Güdel et al. reported up-conversion of ∼1500 nm photons in the UC material NaYF4:Er3+ on the rear of a bifacial crystalline Si (c-Si) solar cells with an external quantum efficiency of 2.5% under 5.1 mW collimated laser excitation at 1523 nm.12 The limited enhancement from UC in inorganic solar cells arises from the narrow band-gap of Si (∼1.1 eV) or GaAs (1.43 eV) with the absorption region already extending to the NIR region, thus re-absorption from UC materials around the NIR region in inorganic solar cells is not as obvious as in OPVs.23 The recent first report on UC application in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSC) is from Demopoulos and coworkers.10 They inserted Yb/Er UC particles into the amorphous TiO2 scattering layer and realized a ∼2.4% photocurrent density increase. While the newest application of an up-converter in a polymer solar cell was reported by Brabec's group, in their work, Yb/Er-codoped MoO3, replacing the ordinary poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) with poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), was used as both a charge-selective interface layer and a hole-extraction layer.15 Although the device performances show some improvement, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) is very low.
In our present paper, instead of a standard P3HT:[6,6] phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) bulk heterojunction (BHJ) one, we use a P3HT/P3HT:PC61BM cell (actually the bottom P3HT film was partially dissolved accompanied with spin-coating the P3HT:PC61BM active layer due to the utilization of a same solvent in this structure, but here we still name the device a “bilayer cell” in order to show its difference from the standard BHJ structure) and dope NaYF4:Yb3+ (2%), Er3+ (18%) UC nanoparticles (NPs) into the pure P3HT matrix without obviously disturbing its hole transport ability. The principal working mechanism is the UC NPs doped P3HT layer effectively absorbing the NIR light and then converting it into green and red emissions that can be reabsorbed by the P3HT layer. We have to point out that the scattering of UC NPs to the solar light, generating an increase of the effective transport length inside the active layer, is another important factor that influences the cell's electrical characteristics. With an optimal UC doping concentration of 11.7% into the P3HT matrix, the short-circuit current density (JSC) and the PCE for the UC-doped bilayer cell are as high as 10.89 mA cm−2 and 3.62%, about 16.6% and 10.7% higher than the P3HT/P3HT:PC61BM bilayer cell and 22.4% and 16.4% higher than the standard BHJ one, respectively.
Experimental
The UC phosphors of NaYF4:Yb3+ (2%), Er3+ (18%) were synthesized according to the literature reported by Wang et al. in 2005.24 Diffraction patterns of UC NPs were measured with X-ray diffraction (XRD) (ARL, XTRA). The UC luminescence was tested by fluorescence spectrum (Horiba JobinYvon FluoroMax-4 system) under an excitation of a laser diode at 980 nm. Elemental components of the UC-doped P3HT layer were measured with an Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX, Oxford 6587).
Our OPVs were fabricated onto an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrate. Pre-patterned ITO-coated glass substrates (6–7 Ω per square) were first cleaned with acetone and ethanol, respectively, and then ultra-sonicated in acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 10 min in sequence. After blowing with N2, the cleaned substrates were dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C. Afterwards the samples were treated in an O3 plasma for 1 min. PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) was spin-cast from aqueous solution to form a thin film of ∼22 nm. The film was dried at 100 °C for 15 min in air, and then transferred into a glove box to spin-cast the active layer. The PEDOT:PSS-coated substrates were either coated with the UC-doped P3HT thin layer or directly with the regio-regular (RR)-P3HT:PC60BM active layer as a reference device. The thin P3HT (from solution with a polymer concentration of 20 mg ml−1) layer with or without NaYF4:Yb3+ (2%), Er3+ (18%) was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer with a spin-coating rate of 1500 rpm and a time of 60 s. After natural drying, a blend layer of RR-P3HT:PC60BM (1:1, w/w) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (ODCB) solvent was spin-coated onto the P3HT layer (1300 rpm for 60 s) and then the wet films were dried in a covered glass Petri dish for 60 min. Finally, the LiF/Al electrode (0.8 nm/100 nm) was thermally deposited on top of the active layer at 5 × 10−4 Pa. The blend solution of the photoactive layer was prepared as follows: RR-P3HT (Rieke Metals, 95–98% regio-regular, Mn = 50000 g mol−1) and PC61BM (Nano C) were dissolved in ODCB with the polymer concentration of 13 mg ml−1 and then stirred at 50 °C overnight. As for the UC-doped P3HT solution: NaYF4:Yb3+ (2%), Er3+ (18%) NPs were fully dispersed in the P3HT solution (with ODCB as the solvent, 20 mg ml−1) at different weight ratios, and then the solution was stirred for several days at 50 °C. All the solutions were filtered with a 0.45 μm PTFE filter before being spin-cast. Note that the UC phosphor concentration was varied from 0 to 20 wt% in the P3HT solution. RR-P3HT:PCBM control devices without a UC NP-doped P3HT layer were also prepared for comparison.
Photovoltaic characteristics were measured with a solar simulator (Oriel 94023A, USA) with an AM 1.5G filter (Oriel, USA). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by using an Oriel Solar standard Si solar cell. Current density versus voltage (J–V) curves were measured with a Keithley 2400 source meter and recorded with the computer. More than 20 samples have been fabricated to ensure the reproducibility of the J–V characteristics.
Results and discussion
The XRD patterns (Fig. 1a) of synthesized nano-particles clearly confirm that the NaYF4:Yb3+ (2%), Er3+ (18%) crystal matches with JCPDS card 28-1192, which is a kind of crystal form slightly different from the perfect hexagon. The elemental analysis of the UC-modified P3HT film was carried out with an EDX with a result of an atomic ratio of 9:1 for Yb and Er elements, as shown in Fig. 2, indicating the existence of NaYF4:Yb3+,Er3+ in the P3HT film. The diameter of the synthetic UC NPs, analyzed from the TEM images as shown in Fig. 1b is ∼30 nm. Actually, compared to the size in the TEM image, UC NPs (white particles in Fig. 1c) in the P3HT solid film in the SEM image aggregate with the diameter being increased to 50–200 nm. As expected, the synthetic NPs dispersed in the solvent, e.g., ODCB, show strong up-conversion emission upon excitation at 980 nm (short-dash line in Fig. 3). By comparing the absorption spectra of the pure P3HT film (dash line in Fig. 3) or P3HT:PCBM blend film (dash-dot line in Fig. 3) with the UC emission, we found that there is a perfect overlap between the absorption of the P3HT donor and the UC emission.

The short-dash line and dash-dot line are the emission of NaYF4:2% Er3+, 18% Yb3+ dispersed respectively in ODCB solvent and P3HT solution (solvent was ODCB), with excitation from a 980 nm laser. 
XRD patterns and SEM images of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ film and the P3HT/P3HT:PCBM bilayer film were measured to observe the influence of the insertion of an additive P3HT film on the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM photoactive film, as shown in Fig. 4. Both the two films in Fig. 4a show an intense diffraction peak around 5.4°, corresponding to the (100) plane, which represents an ordered and self-organized lamellar structure. The maximum diffraction peak in the bilayer film exceeds that in the BHJ one, indicating the bilayer film has closer P3HT chains, which results in a smaller series resistance and a higher JSC.25 Simultaneously, compared with the BHJ one, the half width of the (100) diffraction spectrum is narrowed with the introduction of an additive P3HT film, which gives information about the better degree of crystallization.26 Similarly, from the SEM images, in the P3HT:PCBM BHJ, a homogeneous distribution of the two components on the nanoscale with the large-scale PCBM crystallization is achieved (Fig. 4b), while the PCBM nanocrystals in the P3HT/P3HT:PCBM bilayer seem to be much smaller, as can be seen in Fig. 4c, indicating that an extra P3HT thin film below the photoactive layer inhibits to some extent the extremely large crystallization of the PCBM molecules. Absorption spectra of the films were also studied and are displayed in Fig. 3. All the films exhibit an absorption peak wavelength at 513 nm and two prominent shoulder peaks at 550 and 600 nm, indicating the characteristic absorption of the crystalline π-stacking structure of P3HT.27 An additive thin P3HT film below the P3HT:PCBM blend film increased the absorption coefficient of the film with a more pronounced shoulder at ∼600 nm, which is assigned to a highly interchain-delocalized excitation.28 Simultaneously, the vibrational bands of P3HT are also clearly observed even in the presence of UC NPs, although there is a distinct decrease of the intensity (dash-dot-dot line in Fig. 3), suggesting that the crystallization of P3HT is somewhat affected by the addition of UC NPs, but it is still better than that of the BHJ film.

The typical P3HT:PCBM (1:1, w/w) BHJ solar cell possessing with a PCE of 3.1% and a high fill factor (FF) of 61.2% was first fabricated. Spin-coating a thin P3HT layer with a solution of 20 mg ml−1 in ODCB before the bulk photoactive layer results in a significant increase on both JSC and FF, which is a proof of the photo-induced charge carriers were increased and further effectively transferred to the electrodes. The PCE of the P3HT/P3HT:PCBM bilayer cell is enhanced by ∼5.1% over the standard P3HT:PCBM BHJ one, while the open circuit voltage (VOC) slightly decreases from 0.57 to 0.56 V. The drop of the VOC may be due to the rise in the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level that induced by the increased order within the P3HT domains and the increased inter-chain orbital delocalization,29 or the inaccuracy brought by the experimental process. To clarify the functionality of the P3HT thickness, a thinner P3HT film with a concentration of 10 mg ml−1 was inserted into the PEDOT:PSS and the P3HT:PCBM layer. In this bilayer cell, FF suffers an obvious drop from 62.9% to 56.2%, while JSC increases to 9.91 mA cm−2, resulting in a lower efficiency. The performances of the P3HT:PCBM BHJ and the P3HT/P3HT:PCBM bilayer solar cells with different polymer layer thicknesses are listed in Table 1. The cell structure and the corresponding J–V characteristics of the reference P3HT:PCBM and the bilayer cell with different polymer layer thicknesses are presented in Fig. 5. Overall, compared to the reference BHJ cell, the bilayer cell with a high P3HT concentration demonstrates higher JSC and FF and an enhanced PCE.

 Fig. 5  Layer sequence of the investigated solar cells in a typical architecture (a), and the J–V curves (b) of solar cells based on the P3HT/P3HT:PCBM bilayer with different polymer concentrations and standard P3HT:PCBM BHJ layer. 
In the following part, we will observe the effect of the UC material NaYF4:2% Er3+, 18% Yb3+ on the OPV performances. The UC NPs are doped into the matrix of the pure P3HT layer and its utilization brings dual functionality in the P3HT:PCBM-based polymer solar cell. Firstly, NaYF4:2% Er3+, 18% Yb3+ NPs absorb NIR photons in the solar spectra and convert them into the visible emission. And then the P3HT matrix absorbs the visible photons from both the solar light and the UC emission, where excitons are generated and then diffuse to the BHJ interface and finally are dissociated. In addition, the UC NPs scatter the input solar light and enhance the effective transport length of light inside the cell. To further clarify whether the UC NPs have effectively converted the NIR light into visible light, we dispersed UC NPs in ODCB solvent and made an UC film by dripping the solution on the substrate and then volatilizing the solvent. And then we took the photos of the UC solid film with a two-photon confocal microscopy (Olympus IX81) under the excitation of 980 nm laser, which are shown in Fig. 6a and b. Here, green and red emissions from the UC film are obtained and observed in the ranges of 495–540 nm and 575–630 nm, respectively. From the pictures one can clearly observe the obvious green light and weak red light emitted from UC NPs. In contrast, the green emission almost disappears in UC NPs-doped P3HT film under the excitation of 980 nm laser, as shown in Fig. 6c, while the red light still survives and even becomes brighter (Fig. 6d), which indicates that the green emission is successfully reabsorbed by the P3HT molecules due to perfect overlap the green emission of UC NPs and the absorption of P3HT as shown in Fig. 3. The red light cannot be totally reabsorbed due to the cut-off of the absorption spectrum of P3HT around 650 nm and the absorption of the green emission from UC NPs may lead to the photoluminescence (PL) of P3HT, so the red light in Fig. 6d and 3 seems to be even much brighter. In cell structures, we cannot observe the PL phenomenon in the UC-doped P3HT film due to a serious emission quenching induced by a large concentration of P3HT. Besides the beneficial use of the NIR light, we believe the scattering of UC NPs to the solar light generating an increase of the effective transport length inside the active layer is another important factor that influences the cell's electrical characteristics. In our following work, we will design a series of device structures with different shapes of UC NPs to observe the scattering influence on cell performances through both experimental results and theoretical calculations, and the relevant result will be published elsewhere.
 Fig. 6  Photos of the solid films spun from the UC-dispersed ODCB solutions without (a and b) or with (c and d) P3HT. The photos of (a)–(d) were taken in the dark under the excitation of a 980 nm laser by two-photon confocal microscopy. The green (a and c) and red (b and d) emission was obtained in the range of 495–540 nm and 575–630 nm, respectively. 
Here, we doped different concentrations of UC NPs into the 20 mg ml−1 P3HT solution to optimize the cell performance. The structure of the UC-doped polymer solar cells and its corresponding working mechanism of UC NPs-based polymer layer are described in Fig. 7a and b. With the introduction of an increasing UC NPs concentration, JSC and PCE drop first and then increase until the concentration reaches 10%. As the UC NPs concentration increases up to 11.7 wt%, the OPV obtains an optimal result with a PCE of 3.62%, an enhancement factor of about 16.4% and 10.7% over the control BHJ and the bilayer non-doped cells, respectively. Then with further UC NPs, efficiency drops dramatically to only 0.5%. The detailed performances of the UC-doped solar cells with different UC ratios of 0% to 20% are summarized in Table 1. To illustrate the effect of various UC sensitizers on the polymer matrix, the corresponding J–V curves are also depicted in Fig. 7c. And the relative changes of the device parameters with an increasing UC NPs content are also analyzed in Fig. 7d. Here, the performance of the bilayer P3HT/P3HT:PCBM device without UC is chosen as the reference and set to 1. All other device data are normalized. The JSC shows a continuous enhancement until the UC NPs content is up to 11.7 wt%, and then suffers a striking decrease. The reference device starts with a JSC of 9.34 mA cm−2 which then increases to 10.89 mA cm−2 at 11.7 wt% UC content for the bilayer solar cell, while VOC shows no obvious change, mainly remaining at 0.58 V. Simultaneously, the variety of FF is more complex, because it is related to the carrier recombination under complicated morphology. On the whole, the FF in the UC-doped cell is lower than the reference one (FF = 0.61), which is easily understood due to the disturbance of UC NPs to the fine hole conductivity of the pure P3HT layer. Table 1 summarizes the effects of devices on the series resistance (RS), which are calculated with a reverse slope of the J–V curve at the JSC of near 0. The RS values are ca. 9.70 and 10.27 Ω cm2 in the standard BHJ and the bilayer cell, respectively. The RS of the bilayer devices slightly increases with the increase of the UC NPs concentration and then quickly increases to 87 Ω cm2 when the UC concentration is up to 20 wt%. Fig. 7e displays the IPCE spectra of the following three devices: the standard P3HT:PCBM BHJ cell, the P3HT/P3HT:PCBM bilayer cells without and with 10 wt% UC concentration. Consistent with the trend in JSC, the bilayer cell with the 10 wt% UC doping concentration shows the highest IPCE, while the BHJ cell has the lowest one. Compared to the P3HT/P3HT:PCBM cell, the main enhancement of IPCE for the UC-doped cell occurs at a wide wavelength range of 450–550 nm, which indicates that not only the green emission of the UC NPs but also the scattering is beneficial to the improvement of efficiency. From this figure, we also deduce that the absorption of the P3HT film to the wavelength region of around 650 nm is negligible.

(e) IPCE spectra for the standard BHJ solar cells, the bilayer cell, and the UC-doped bilayer cell. The inset is the IPCE curves of cells around 980 nm. 

Fig. 8 depicts the dark J–V characteristics of standard BHJ device and the bilayer ones with a UC weight ratio of 11.7% and without UC NPs. The dark current of the bilayer device is lower than that of the BHJ one, mainly due to the introduction of an additive P3HT thin layer resulting in the increased RS although the carrier mobility of P3HT is as high as ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. While for the optimal UC concentration of 11.7 wt%, the dark current shows no obvious alteration, indicating the electrical characteristics of the bilayer device is not much influenced by the proper doping concentration of UC NPs.

To make sure the up-conversion emission in this paper is helpful to improve OPV performances, we synthesized two types of UC NPs with similar shapes (∼30 nm), which will bring a similar scattering impact on the cells under a same doping condition. The difference of these two types of UC materials is that one radiates green emission (denoted as “G-UC”) while the other emits yellow light (named with “Y-UC”). The corresponding PL spectra are depicted in the inset of Fig. 9. Because the yellow light from Y-UC contains less green emission and red components, its luminous efficiency is far lower than that of green-light UC NPs. So the comparison of the performances with yellow- and green-light UC-doped cells can help us to observe the positive influence of the UC emission. The UC doping concentration in the two bilayer solar cells is 10 wt%. The corresponding J–V performances are depicted in Fig. 9, from which one observes that compared with the one with Y-UC NPs the bilayer solar cell with G-UC NPs shows higher JSC, FF, and PCE. Thus we can draw a conclusion that UC NPs with a higher PL efficiency can effectively convert the NIR radiation of solar light into the visible light that can be reabsorbed by some donors, e.g., P3HT, and further enhance the JSC and PCE in OPVs. Another point that we can make sure of is that the scattering is also beneficial to improving the cell's electrical performances, but the research work on mechanism exploration is needed to be carried out.
 Fig. 9  The J–V curves of yellow- (denoted as “Y-UC”) and green-light (denoted as “G-UC”) UC-doped P3HT/P3HT:PCBM bilayer OPVs under the AM 1.5G illumination. The inset is the corresponding PL spectra of the G-UC (solid line) and Y-UC (dash line), both G-UC and Y-UC were dissolved in the solvent of ODCB with a concentration of 2 mg ml−1 and excited by a 980 nm laser with a power of 3 W. 
Conclusions
In summary, highly efficient NaYF4:2% Er3+, 18% Yb3+ up-conversion sensitizers were introduced into the bilayer P3HT/P3HT:PCBM polymer solar cells to compensate for the non-absorbable wavelength zone around the NIR region of the P3HT donor. With an optimal UC doping concentration of 11.7% (weight ratio of UC to P3HT) into the P3HT layer, the short-circuit current density of the bilayer solar cell increased from 9.34 mA cm−2 without UC NPs to 10.89 mA cm−2, an enhancement factor of about 16.4%, while the power conversion efficiency improves by a factor of 10.4%, reaching as high as 3.61%. In addition, the FF and VOC of the UC-doped bilayer cell could be comparable with those of non-doped bilayer and single bulk heterojunction ones, indicating effective absorption of the NIR solar irradiation by UC NPs and conversion of it into visible light that can be reabsorbed by the donor P3HT. It also demonstrated that a proper doping concentration would not lead to performance deterioration in bilayer polymer solar cells. In addition, research demonstrates that both the emission and the scattering of UC NPs are helpful to enhance the solar cell's electrical performance.
