    , Accepted 24th June 2011First published on 26th July 2011AbstractA systematic study of the effect of the zinc oxide (ZnO) electrodeposition parameters (concentration, temperature, potential and pH) on film morphology, thickness, transparency, roughness and crystallographic orientation is presented with the view of producing optimized thin, planar, and continuous ZnO films for photovoltaic applications. Electrochemical measurements of the deposition charge as a function of time are used to understand the mechanism of nucleation and textured growth. Continuous thin films of crystalline ZnO are obtained at temperatures below 100 °C without the need for subsequent annealing. The formation of continuous films is favoured by high concentrations of Zn2+ precursor (> 100 mM), high temperature (> 70 °C) and low potentials (< −1.1 V/AgAgCl). A low bulk solution pH is shown to be a key factor in obtaining thin continuous films and the crystallographic orientation of these films can also be controlled by the deposition parameters. The importance of orientation and thickness control on device performance is shown by using the electrodeposited films as electron extracting interlayers in a model organic photovoltaic system.
Introduction
Zinc oxide (ZnO) is one of the most promising materials for the development of nanotechnologies due to its range of potential applications such as sensors,1 photovoltaic cells,2 light-emitting diodes3 and nanogenerators.4 A large amount of work has focused on the study of nanostructured ZnO including rods,5–8 wires,9 needles,10 nanocombs,11 plates12 and belts.8,13 Two dimensional (2D) transparent films are also of interest for applications such as n-type window layers,14 diffusion barrier layers,15 buffer layers to minimize leakages in devices,16,17 transparent conductive oxides18 and electron extracting layers in solar cells.19
Compact ZnO layers are usually deposited by methods such as magnetron sputtering,20,21 spray pyrolysis17,22,23 or molecular beam epitaxy.24 These growth methods require high temperatures or vacuum and are generally costly, which significantly limits their potential implementation. Electrodeposition is a low cost alternative for ZnO thin film fabrication that offers the possibility of a high degree of control over the film characteristics through optimisation of the deposition parameters.
The electrodeposition of ZnO was first reported independently by Peulon et al.25 and by Izaki et al.26 Their methods were based on the same simple principle: the reduction of a hydroxide precursor at the electrode leading to a supersaturation at the vicinity of the electrode and chemical precipitation of ZnO. Using this technique growth along the <002> metastable direction is usually favoured and one dimensional (1D) open nanostructures with an (002) preferential orientation are formed.25–27 On transparent conductive oxides such as indium doped tin oxide (ITO) or fluorine doped tin oxide, these nanostructures are typically misaligned.25 Continuous films with a (002) preferential orientation or no preferred orientation have been achieved for relatively thick films (300 nm to several micrometres) are electrodeposited leading to coalescence of the nanostructures. Continuous thin films (< 200nm) have been obtained using electrodeposition by epitaxial growth on substrates with a low lattice mismatch with ZnO (e.g. single crystal GaN28 or Au29) or by using a detrimental etching pretreatment which damages the substrate 30
A review of the literature shows two major problems which have been encountered when using electrodeposition methods to fabricate ZnO films for photovoltaic devices:
Firstly, the thickness of ZnO films is a key parameter in photovoltaic devices with thicknesses < 300 nm usually required to optimize device performance. For example, Plank et al.31 have studied the role of a ZnO backing layer deposited by spray pyrolysis on the open-circuit voltage of ZnO/polymer composite solar cells. Decreasing the ZnO layer thickness from 650 to 120 nm increased the open-circuit voltage by 31% to 0.41 V. Moreover, the external quantum efficiency was shown to increase from 2% at 650 nm ZnO film thickness to 7.2% for the 120 nm thick films.
Secondly, cell performance will be affected by the orientation of the crystallites in the ZnO layer. ZnO crystallizes with the Wurtzite structure: this structure is a hexagonal crystal system and consists of tetrahedrally coordinated Zn and O atoms with alternating layers of oxygen and zinc ions along the major c-axis. The surfaces perpendicular to the major axis (the <002> directions) are composed uniquely of either Zn2+ or O2− ions and are therefore polar. The faces parallel to the c-axis are composed of Zn–O dimers with overall neutral charge and are non-polar (see Fig. 1). It has been shown that surface orientation and termination have a huge effect on the work function and thus the overall devices properties.32–34 Moreover organic materials are soft; hence the electrostatic field generated by the polar faces of ZnO could have a significant effect on the crystallinity of the organic materials at the ZnO interface within in a photovoltaic device.35 We have recently demonstrated that changing the preferential orientation of ZnO hole extracting interlayers in polymer-based solar cells from (002) to (100) leads to a dramatic improvement in device performance.19
 Fig. 1  Schematic diagram illustrating how the ZnO nanocrystals affect the organic films at the interface. (a) ZnO crystals are composed of polar faces (in blue), perpendicular to the <002> direction, and non polar faces (in grey), parallel to the <002> direction. (b), (c) and (d) Changing the ZnO crystallite orientation and thus the polarity at the interface may dramatically change the soft material structure. 
In this work we aim to produce thin ZnO films with a controllable orientation for the first time by systematically studying the effect of all the deposition parameters. It is known that small variations in the electrodeposition parameters may lead to dramatic changes in the morphology and crystallography of the ZnO films.20 Therefore to understand the effect of the deposition parameters a systematic study is needed. To date three precursors have been used for the formation of hydroxide: O2,25 H2O236 and NO3− ions.26 The low solubility of O2 limits control over the reaction and high deposition rates cannot be achieved. H2O2 decomposes spontaneously, particularly at the deposition temperatures required to form crystalline films. In comparison, NO3− ions are highly soluble in water and very high deposition rates can be obtained (up to 0.3 μm min−1)37 and consequently has been chosen as a precursor in this work. The mechanism of deposition of ZnO can be described as follows: NO3− ions are reduced at the cathode to produce OH− ions (eqn (1)); these react with Zn2+ ions resulting in the precipitation of the solid product onto the electrode surface (eqn (2)) NO3− + H2O + 2e− → NO2− + 2OH−(1) Zn2+ + 2OH− → ZnO↓ + H2O(2)
The overall equation is then Zn2+ + NO3− + 2e− → ZnO↓ + NO2−(3)
The mechanism of ZnO formation has been extensively studied in recent years.26,30,37–46 Three parameters have been reported as having an influence on the film morphology, potential (E),26,39 temperature (T)47 and Zn(NO3)2 concentration (C(Zn(NO3)2).48 These previous studies have investigated the influence of a single parameter while the others were fixed. The fixed values vary from one paper to another as do the characterization techniques, making the results from the different studies difficult to compare. Moreover films thicker than 1 μm have generally been deposited and the focus of these previous reports has been on the formation of nanostructures rather than the deposition of thin continuous films.
Surprisingly little work has been dedicated to studying the effect of bulk pH on electrodeposited (ED) films49–51 where the OH− and Zn2+ concentration gradient at the vicinity of the electrode may have a strong influence on the film morphology.41
In this paper we firstly, study the effect of the deposition parameters on the film morphology, thickness, optical transmission and roughness in order to produce thin, continuous and transparent films; secondly, we consider the influence of the deposition parameters in order to produce films with tuneable crystallographic orientation and thus surface polarity; thirdly we show how the control of the film thickness and orientation can dramatically improve device performances by using a model photovoltaic system.
Experimental
Zinc oxide electrodeposition
ITO covered glass (PsiOTec Ltd., 15 Ω/sq.), platinum wire and saturated silver/silver chloride were used as the working, counter and reference (against which all potentials are quoted) electrodes respectively. A Princeton Applied Research potentiostat (Versastat 3) was used to control the potential and record the current. The deposition was halted after a charge (Q) of 0.15 C cm−2 had passed unless stated otherwise. Prior to electrodeposition the substrates were successively cleaned in an ultrasonic bath with acetone, methanol, 0.1 M NaOH solution and deionised water. The Zn(NO3)2 concentration, deposition bath temperature and applied potential were varied in the range [50 mM to 150 mM], [40 °C to 90 °C] and [−0.7 V to −2 V] respectively. The bulk pH was varied between 4 and 2.5 by small additions of concentrated HCl. Nitrogen gas was bubbled through the cell for 20 min prior to deposition in order to ensure removal of atmospheric oxygen.
Materials characterization
A Leo Gemini 1525 field-emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) was used for surface topography analysis. The root mean square (rms) roughness was measured with an Ambios Technology Q-Scope 250 Nomad Atomic Force Microscope (AFM). The optical transmittance spectra were recorded between 300 nm and 900 nm with a Bentham spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed to identify the phases present using a Philips PANalytical X'Pert PRO MPD diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation and a Ni filter. A FEI Focussed Ion Beam microscope FIB200 was used to prepare electron transparent cross sections of the optimized photovoltaic devices. The interfaces were characterized with a Jeol 2010 transmission electron microscope (TEM).
Device fabrication and assessment
Once the different ZnO layers were deposited, the same procedure was employed to fabricate all the corresponding devices. A solution of Poly(3-Hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Rieke, >98%, regioregular) and Phenyl C61 Butyric Acid Methyl Ester (PCBM) (Aldrich, 99%, anhydrous) dissolved in 1,2-dichlorobenzene was prepared. The concentration for both components was 20 mg mL−1 and the solution was left stirring for a minimum of 36 h at 40 °C. The blended solution was treated with 0.2 μm filters and then spin-coated on to either bare ITO or ITO/ZnO substrates at 1000 rpm,. The deposited film obtained was left to dry at room temperature and subsequently annealed at 120 °C. The operations described to this point were performed under N2 atmosphere with both O2 and H2O contents below 1 ppm. The resultant organic layer film thickness was 140 nm unless otherwise stated.
WOx and aluminium (both Aldrich, >99.9%) were deposited via thermal evaporation at a base pressure of 10−7 mbar using a Kurt J. Lesker deposition system equipped with quartz microbalances, which allowed for the monitoring of film thickness and deposition rate. 10 nm of WOx was deposited on top of the P3HT:PCBM film, and finally a top electrode of circa 100 nm aluminium was deposited. The final active area of such devices, as defined by the overlapping shapes of the top (aluminium) and bottom (ITO) electrodes, was 0.06 cm2.
Current density-voltage curves (J-V) were acquired in nitrogen atmosphere with a Newport Oriel solar simulator calibrated at 1 sun (100 mW cm−2, Air Mass 1.5) with a PVM 42 photodiode; the voltage scan was provided by a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source-meter.
Results and discussion
1. Systematic study of the effect of the ZnO deposition parameters

1.1 Selection of the standard conditions. 
In this work the effect of the experimental parameters was studied by varying one parameter at a time and keeping the others constant under a set of standard conditions. These conditions were chosen following an extensive review of the relevant literature. Izaki et al. have studied the effects of the electrolyte concentration on the properties of ZnO films deposited on ITO.48 They report that the films deposited from solutions with a Zn(NO3)2 concentration between 30 and 100 mM present a well-defined (002) orientation and the orientation is weakened if the concentration is increased further. These authors also found that the optical transparency is maximum for 100 mM Zn(NO3)2 at 72% for a wavelength of 600 nm. The standard Zn(NO3)2 concentration for this study was chosen as 100 mM. In another publication,26 the same group studied the effect of potential on the formation of ZnO films from −0.7 to −1.4 V. They found that decreasing the potential toward more negative values weakens the (002) preferential orientation. They also report that the maximum transparency is obtained for films deposited at −1.0 V. The standard deposition potential used for our was therefore chosen as −1.0 V. Otani and co-workers have studied the effect of bath temperature on the properties of the films between 40 and 70 °C deposited from 0.1 M Zn(NO3)2 solution.47 They report the formation of a ZnO precursor at low temperature and a strong (002) preferential orientation at 70 °C. The morphologies of the film change dramatically from open structures at 40 °C to a hexagonal morphology at 70 °C. Goux et al.43 report a similar effect of temperature in chloride containing baths. According to these previous studies, high temperature favours crystalline materials and dense structures, so the standard temperature chosen for our study was 90 °C. In summary, a Zn(NO3)2 concentration of 100 mM, an applied potential of −1.0 V, a temperature of 90 °C and were chosen as the standard conditions for our work. There is no systematic study of the effect of the bulk pH. A pH of 3.5 was chosen as standard condition (the initial pH of the 100 mM Zn(NO3)2 solution is 4).


1.2 Effect of concentration. 

Fig. 2 shows the SEM images of ZnO layers deposited with increasing Zn(NO3)2 concentrations. All the layers are composed of particles with a rod-like shape, shown in the cross section images (Fig.. 2a and 2b). Below 60 mM the substrate is not completely covered and the morphology is not homogenous with some thin sheets still visible (Fig.. 2c and 2d). The rods deposited at 50 mM (Fig. 2c) have a random orientation. Between 60 and 90 mM (Fig. 2d–g) the rods are orientated perpendicularly to the substrate. From 70 mM (Fig. 2e) the coverage of the substrate is enhanced. No change in morphology is observed between 70 and 80 mM (Fig. 2e and 2f). At 90 mM (Fig. 2), a decrease in rod-diameter is observed and there is a loss in orientation perpendicular to the substrate, with some nanorods being parallel to the substrate. The morphology of the rods deposited from 90 to 150 mM remains similar (Fig. 2g–k)).

No change of morphology was observed from the SEM pictures between 130 and 150 mM. 

Fig. 3a shows the variation of thickness measured from SEM cross-section images as a function of Zn(NO3)2 concentration. Two regions are clearly visible in Fig. 3a. For films deposited between 50 and 80 mM, more open and less dense structures are produced; beyond 90 mM a significant increase in continuity is observed. Fig. 3b shows the change in transmission (measured at 600 nm) as a function of Zn(NO3)2 concentration. The signal from the ITO substrate has been subtracted. The films deposited with a concentration of 50 mM have a low transparency (40%). However, from 60 to 150 mM, the transmission increases with Zn(NO3)2 concentration, reaching 95% at 600 nm for films deposited with a 150 mM concentration.

The rms roughness evaluated from AFM measurements (images not shown) is shown in Fig. 3c. ZnO transparency is known to be closely related to the surface roughness and the existence of voids,44 with the roughness being inversely correlated with transmission.
XRD data as a function of Zn(NO3)2 concentration are presented in supporting information. All the peaks have been identified as being due to the ITO substrate or ZnO films with a Wurtzite structure (JCPDS 75-1526). To estimate the change in orientation with the deposition parameters, the texture coefficient has been calculated according to the following relation:45 (4)where TC(hkl) is the texture coefficient for the considered hkl orientation, I(hkl) is the measured relative intensity, I0(hkl) is relative intensity of the corresponding plane given in the JCPDS data and n is the number of reflections.
According to eqn (4), if the films present no preferential orientation in the considered direction, TC(hkl) is close to unity, and if there is a preferential orientation of the grains, TC is greater than unity. The nine main peaks in the XRD diffraction pattern ({100}, {002}, {101}, {102}, {110}, {103}, {200}, {112} and {201}) have been fitted with a Gaussian curve to calculate TC(hkl). Fig. 4a presents the variation of TC(hkl) for the three main reflections.
 Fig. 4  Effect of Zn(NO3)2 concentration (a), temperature (b) and potential (c) on TC(hkl) for the three main reflections of ZnO. 
Films deposited between 60 and 90 mM have a strong (002) preferential orientation. By contrast, for concentrations between 100 and 150 mM the (002) preferential orientation is weakened and the in-plane orientation increases showing that concentration has a strong influence on the film texture.
The variation of the integrated current with time measured during the potentiostatic deposition is shown in Fig. 5a. Below 100 mM the charge increases with Zn(NO3)2 concentration. Above 100 mM a saturation of the charge with concentration is observed, i.e. the charge vs. time curve is unchanged by increasing the Zn(NO3)2 concentration. The deposition process takes place in conditions near equilibrium at the interface for low rates of deposition.25 Hence growth along the thermodynamically favoured surfaces dominates and the formation of crystals with an (002) orientation is observed.25 Above 100 mM the mechanism is most likely limited by slow electron transfer kinetics.39 Growth is not under thermodynamic control and the (002) orientation is weakened.

1.3 Effect of temperature. 

Fig. 6 shows SEM images from films deposited between 40 and 90 °C. At 40 °C the film is composed of small aggregated particles. A change of morphology is observed between 40 and 50 °C with the films deposited at 50 °C composed of plate-like particles. Another transition occurs at 60 °C between plate-like and rod-like particles with an ill-defined cross-section. The films deposited between 70 and 80 °C are very similar. A further change in morphology is observed at 90 °C with the rod-like particles becoming more hexagonal in cross section.
 Fig. 6  SEM images of ZnO films deposited at different temperatures. (a) 40, (b) 50, (c) 60, (d) 70, (e) 80, and (f) 90 °C. 
Between 40 and 60 °C the film thickness increases with temperature signifying that the films are less continuous (see Fig. 3d). A decrease in film thickness is observed between 60 and 70 °C with no significant change observed above 70 °C. No dramatic changes are observed in either the optical transmission signal or rms roughness measurements with temperature (see Fig. 3e and 3f).
The XRD results from films deposited between 40 and 90 °C only show peaks associated with ZnO and ITO (see supporting information and Fig. 3b). The (002) preferential orientation slightly decreases between 40 and 60 °C, it reaches a maximum at 70 °C and then decreases as the temperature is increased further. The change in growth mechanism was studied by Otani et al.47 with electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance measurements using similar deposition conditions in the temperature range 40–70 °C. The observed variations in preferential orientation were attributed to the formation of a precursor below 60 °C and direct deposition at temperatures above 70 °C. Fig. 5b presents the variation of charge measured during deposition as a function of temperature. The change of mechanism between 60 and 70 °C is clearly visible, with the deposition curves becoming linear above 60 °C. The decrease in TC(002) with temperature above 70 °C can be explained by a change in deposition rate. Lower rates of deposition favour growth along the <002> metastable polar directions. Raising the temperature increases the rate of deposition and weakens the (002) preferential orientation.


1.4 Effect of potential. 

Fig. 7 shows the effect of deposition potential on ZnO film morphology. No growth is observed for a potential of −0.7 V. Between −0.8 and −0.9 V individual rods with a hexagonal shape are formed. At −1.0 V, the morphology is changed, the films are more compact and the hexagonal shape is lost. Particles with a smaller diameter are formed from −1.1 V. No change in morphology is observed between −1.1 V and −2.0 V.
 Fig. 7  SEM images of ZnO films deposited at different potentials: (a) −0.8, (b) −0.9, (c) −1.0, (d) −1.1, (e) −1.2, and (f) −2 V (no changes are observed between −1.2 and −2.0 V). 

Fig. 3g shows the variation of film thickness as a function of applied potential. The film thickness decreases between −0.8 and −1.1 V before slightly increasing when the applied potential is shifted more negative. The films deposited at potentials more negative than −1.0 V are continuous. The transmission and roughness follow the same trend (Fig. 3e and 3f). The rms roughness decreases from −0.8 V to −1.2V before reaching a plateau; the transmission is inversely correlated to the roughness as explained above. XRD data recorded as a function of the deposition potential are presented in the supporting information (Figure S1). Surprisingly all the peaks can be assigned to ZnO and ITO substrates even though the formation of metallic zinc would have been thermodynamically expected for applied potentials more negative the −1.4 V. The limit between the stability domain of Zn(II+) and Zn(0) is strongly dependent on the pH but is always less negative than −1.4 V.47 However, due to the small thickness of the films and high solution temperature, any deposited zinc metal is rapidly oxidized to ZnO. For potentials more negative than −1.4 V, the XRD data for the ITO substrate are also modified because of the electrochemical reduction of Sn atoms.52

Fig. 5c shows the variation of charge measured during deposition as a function of potential. A dramatic change in growth rate is observed between −1.0 and −1.2V. For less negative potentials, the nucleation of ZnO is poor as can be seen in Fig. 7a and 7b. The nucleation is limited to a few centres and the substrate is poorly covered. The rods are not perpendicular to the substrate and thus the TC(002) value is low. As the potential becomes more negative, more nucleation centres are activated and the rods are more vertical. The films are more continuous and a sharp increase in TC(002) is observed. For potentials more negative than −1.4 V, a strong preferential orientation in the (002) direction is still observed but it is less pronounced. We believe that the orientation is affected due to the formation of metallic zinc as an intermediary in this potential window.

2. Effect of pH and control of the film orientation
The formation of continuous films is favoured by high concentration (>100 mM), high temperature (>70 °C) and very negative potentials (<−1.1 V). Film orientation may have a strong influence on the subsequent applications and thus it is important to control the orientation of the films during deposition. The best films in terms of roughness and transparency have a pronounced polar (002) preferential orientation, formed using the following deposition conditions: a potential of −1.3 V, a Zn(NO3)2 concentration of 100 mM and a temperature of 90 °C. According to Fig. 4d it is possible to weaken the (002) orientation by using a temperature lower than 60 °C, however less compact films are obtained (seeFig. 3b). Varying the concentration appears to be a better method of preparing continuous and transparent films with controllable orientation: the (002) preferential orientation is weakened in the interval 110 mM to 130 mM whereas the film compactness, transparency and flatness are all increased. Fig. 8a presents the film deposited using 130 mM of Zn(NO3)2 at 90 °C and an applied potential of −1.3 V. The deposited layer is composed of superstructures, formed by the agglomeration of small particles, which cover the substrate very poorly. Under these conditions, high concentration levels of NO3− ions and a very negative potential are used resulting in high current densities. The mechanism for the deposition of ZnO using a high current density has been modelled by Pauporté et al. using H2O2 as an oxygen precursor.36 They demonstrated that for very high currents, the current value can be greater than the limiting diffusion current of Zn2+ ions and OH− ions produced in excess at the electrode can diffuse toward the solution, react with the Zn2+ ions diffusing towards the surface, thus dramatically increasing the size of the supersaturated layer.
 Fig. 8  Effect of pH on ZnO film morphology. SEM images of the films formed with a pH of (a) 2.6, (b) 2.9, (c) 3.2, (d) 3.5, (e) 3.8 and (f) 4.1. 
Based on this idea of variation in supersaturated layer an ingenious way to solve this problem and obtain continuous films is to lower the bulk pH (Fig. 9). To our knowledge the effect of the bulk pH has never been studied and values below 4 have never been explored, presumably because of the very high solubility of ZnO under these conditions. However, by doing so thickness of the diffusion layer will be reduced and the gradient of Zn2+ and OH− ions in the diffusion layer correspondingly increased.
 Fig. 9  Schematic diagram showing the change in thickness of the ZnO supersaturation layer with decreasing pH. Plain lines represent high bulk pH, dashed lines represent low bulk pH. When the bulk pH is decreased, the gradient of concentration in the diffusion layer is increased. The length of the supersaturated layer where the precipitation of ZnO can occur is therefore reduced. 
The influence of bulk solution pH has been studied to verify this hypothesis. Fig. 8a to 8f present the ZnO films electrodeposited from solutions with pH ranging between 4.1 to pH of 2.6. The influence of pH on film coverage is striking. At pH 4.1 the film consists of ZnO islands. The film coverage then progressively increases with decreasing pH. At pH 2.6, the ITO substrate is entirely covered.

Fig. 10a highlights the variation in film thickness as a function of pH. The films thickness decreases dramatically with pH because of an increase in the compact nature of the films. Fig. 10b and 10c show the rms roughness and optical transmission respectively. Significantly we find that decreasing the pH results in both smoother and more transparent films. XRD patterns of the films as a function of pH are presented in supporting information (Figure S1). As described previously, all the peaks have been identified as coming from the ITO substrate reflection perpendicular to the plane. The main variations are observed for the in-plane {100} reflection and the plane {002} reflection. The films deposited at pH 4.1 present both a strong (002) and (100) orientation. At pH 3.8 a decrease of the (100) reflection is initially observed, and then the TC(hkl) for this reflection increases again slowly as the pH is decreased further. In comparison, the (002) reflection decreases between pH 4.1 and pH 3.5, and remains constant between pH 3.6 and pH 2.8 before reaching unity at pH 2.6.

The variations of morphology and texture coefficient are in good agreement with our predicted effect of pH. The height of the structures decreases progressively with decreasing pH due to the reduction in the length of the supersaturation layer. The ZnO film thus becomes thinner, smoother and the (002) peak is less intense. Indeed, at low bulk pH, the saturated layer is very thin, so the growth perpendicular to the substrate is blocked and instead occurs primarily in the plane of the substrate. However, further decreases in pH do not increase the film continuity. Moreover, the ZnO film becomes increasingly unstable and is now rapidly dissolved when the applied current is halted. Samples must be removed from the solution immediately.

Fig. 11a and 11b show TEM cross-sections of A-ED and B-ED films, respectively. A-ED and B-ED films have (002) and (100) preferential orientation respectively. The ED films are dense and the ITO substrate is well-covered. The current voltage characteristics of the OPV devices prepared are shown in Fig. 12 and the open circuit voltages (Voc), short-circuit currents (Jsc), fill factors (FF) and power conversion efficiencies (PCE)) are presented in Table 2. As previously reported,19 the crystallographic orientation of the ZnO films has a dramatic influence on device performances. Surprisingly, An A-ED ZnO layer gives a Voc of 0.53 V, which is similar to the one obtained with a B-ED interlayer. The overall work function of the 2 devices is quite similar. The short-circuit current increases from 9.26 mA cm−2 for an A-ED layer to 10.68 mA cm−2 for a B-ED layer. A remarkable increase of the FF (from 0.52 for an A-ED layer to 0.66 for a B-ED layer) and the PCE (from 2.55% to 4.00%) is also observed.

3. Study of the effect of film thickness and orientation on model photovoltaic systems
In order to show the importance of film thickness and orientation in device performance, organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices were prepared using thin ZnO films as bottom, electron-extracting layers, in conjunction with a the photoactive blend of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) according to Ref. 19. Four types of electrodeposited (ED) ZnO layers, with different orientations and thicknesses were used to prepare OPV devices (see Table 1).

ZnO interlayer thickness also has a dramatic effect on the overall device performances. Fig. 12 and Table 2 present the change in J-V curves and a summary of the key device characteristics as a function of ZnO interlayer thickness (B-ED, C-ED and D-ED). Within the uncertainty, the VOC remains constant when the ZnO film thickness is increased from 140 nm to 460 nm whereas a 20% decrease of Jsc is observed and the FF and PCE simultaneously decrease by 10 and 40% respectively. This may be due to an increase of the defects inside the films with increasing thickness leading to a greater resistance, a lower Jsc and a decrease of the overall performances.

Conclusions
The electrodeposition of thin, dense and transparent ZnO films has been optimized through a systematic study of the structure, morphology and transparency of the films as a function of the deposition conditions. The formation of thin continuous films is favoured by high concentrations (> 100 mM), high temperatures (> 70°) and low potentials (< −1.1 V). The crystallographic orientation of the film can be controlled by varying of the deposition parameters. Films with (002) preferential orientation can be grown using the following parameters: a Zn(NO3)2 concentration of 100 mM, a bath temperature of 90 °C and a potential of −1.3V. Films with (100) preferential orientation can be grown with 130 mM, 90 °C, −1.3 V and a pH of 2.6. Surprisingly, bulk pH is found to be a key parameter to obtain both good film coverage and compact thin films. We show that the film thickness and crystallographic orientation can be controlled though the preparation conditions and have a strong influence on the performance characteristics of organic photovoltaic devices.
