For this purpose, the PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ hybrid anti-solvent method is used for the first time to deposit a PCBM:TIPD blended film on a CH3NH3PbI3 layer for PEDOT:PSSPH1000-based PSCs. The PCBM and TIPD fill up the voids and pinholes on the perovskite surfaces and thus produces more compact and pinhole-free perovskite films. Compared to just using Clevios PVP AI 4083 and PCBM, the simultaneous use of PEDOT:PSSPH1000 and PCBM:TIPD is more conducive to the extraction and separation of photo-generated charges from the perovskite. First-principles calculations show that the TIPD aligns the organic molecules of methylammonium in the same direction, and thus produces electric dipole moments and electric fields at the TIPD/perovskite interface, which promotes the electron transfer from the perovskite to the PCBM and TIPD more efficiently. Moreover, the TIPD can effectively reduce the defect states caused by under-coordinated Pb ions. As a result, the performance and stability of the PSCs treated with the PCBM and TIPD are also significantly improved. The highest efficiency of 15.2% is achieved by the cell with PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment, which presents a 45% improvement compared to that of 10.5% for the PSCs with pure CBZ anti-solvent treatment.
Introduction
Over the past few years, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on lead trihalide perovskite materials (MAPbX3, MA = CH3NH3+; X = Cl−, I−, Br−) have received a great deal of attention due to their rapid development of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and their potential to be commercialized. The PCE of the PSCs has increased to more than 23% in the past ten years by optimizing the preparation process of perovskite films and tuning the perovskite compositions,1–4 which can be compared to those of traditional inorganic thin-film solar cells.5,6 To date, the most efficient PSCs have been fabricated with a TiO2-based planar or mesoscopic architecture,7,8 in which a pure perovskite layer is deposited on top of a compact or mesoporous TiO2 layer. However, for both the planar and porous architectures, high temperature sintering of the TiO2 layer at 500 °C is still required to improve the charge transport properties of TiO2 layers by increasing their crystallinity. This high temperature preparation process conflicts with the requirements of low energy consumption and large-scale coating for commercialization of PSCs. Therefore, searching for effective electron and hole transport layers (HTL) which can be prepared by a low temperature solution method has been a hot topic in the field of PSCs.
As a typical material that can be film-forming at a low temperature, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)–poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), such as PEDOT:PSS4083 (Clevios PVP AI 4083) has been successfully used as an effective hole conducting material in PSCs.9–13 PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions consist of conducting PEDOT-rich grains and insulating PSS-rich shells, and the obtained conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film depends on the grade of the PEDOT:PSS aqueous solutions. Due to the high electrical resistivity (500–5000 Ohm cm), PEDOT:PSS4083 is not conducive to the extraction of holes from the perovskite active layer. As another PEDOT:PSS material with much lower electrical resistivity (0.0012 Ohm cm) and better film-forming property than PEDOT:PSS4083, PEDOT:PSSPH1000 (Clevios PH1000) is hardly used in PSCs, which may be due to the PEDOT:PSSPH1000 film having higher surface roughness than PEDOT:PSS4083 resulting from the larger gel particles in Clevios PH1000 solution. Until recently, PH1000 was first applied as a HTL to an inverted ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Ag solar cell.14 Nevertheless, the PCE of this solar cell is still relatively low. The main reason is that there are obvious pores in the CH3NH3PbI3 layer deposited on the PEDOT:PSSPH1000 layer, which leads to serious charge recombination and low charge extraction efficiency. Therefore, fabricating uniform and compact perovskite films with complete surface coverage on PEDOT:PSSPH1000 HTL is the key to achieve high efficiency PSCs with PEDOT:PSSPH1000. Until now, various methods including vacuum evaporation,15,16 solvent engineering,17–19 additive-assisted deposition,20–23 and anti-solvent deposition have been reported to improve the quality of perovskite films.24,25 Among these methods, considering the cost and low temperature requirements of the preparation method, the anti-solvent method with various anti-solvents typically including diethyl ether, toluene, and chlorobenzene (CBZ) is an advantageous method.
On the other hand, although an anti-solvent method can effectively improve the quality of a perovskite film on the HTL, crystal defects still exist on the crystal surface and at the grain boundaries due to under-coordinated Pb ions and halide anions,26,27 which would cause serious charge recombination, slow down charge transport, and thus reduce the device performance. To reduce the density of defect states, one effective strategy is to passivate the perovskite defect state with a passivation material. So far, various types of passivation materials such as fullerene,28 nonfullerene Lewis bases,29,30 graphene,31–33 complex Cd(SCN2H4)Cl2,8 organic materials such as polystyrene,34 halide compounds such as phenethylammonium iodide (C6H5CH2CH2NH3I, PEAI),35 quaternary ammonium halides36 and potassium halide37 have been deposited on the perovskite film to reduce the defects in perovskite crystals.
Herein, we propose a new strategy combining the advantages of both anti-solvent treatment and defect state passivation to achieve the purpose of simultaneously improving the quality of the perovskite film on the HTL and effectively reducing the density of defect states of the perovskite crystals, thereby ultimately improving the performance and stability of the PSCs. Specifically, unlike the pure CBZ solvent, a CBZ solvent containing both 6,6-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TIPD) is used as an anti-solvent to incorporate PCBM and TIPD into the CH3NH3PbI3 layer on the PH1000 film during the spin coating of the perovskite film, wherein the main function of the PCBM is to improve the charge extraction efficiency and the main role of TIPD is to passivate the density of defect states. The structure of the inverted ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Ag cell and the corresponding energy levels are shown in Fig. 1. The morphology, structure and photoelectric properties of the perovskite films treated by PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent were studied. Our experimental results demonstrate that this PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment can effectively improve the compactness and flatness of the perovskite film without changing the crystalline structure of the perovskite. Furthermore, the charge transfer and extraction from the CH3NH3PbI3 becomes more efficient due to the formation of CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3/TIPD interfaces. At the same time, TIPD can effectively passivate the defect states in perovskite crystals. Our theoretical calculation results show that the TIPD on the surface of perovskite crystal particles makes the methylammonium (MA) molecules in the perovskite crystals have the same orientation, resulting in an electric dipole moment at the perovskite/TIPD interface, which greatly facilitates the transfer of photo-generated electrons from the perovskite to the PCBM:TIPD layer, and thus improves charge transfer efficiency. Finally, the performance and stability of the cells with the PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment has been significantly improved for the above reasons compared with the cells treated with only pure CBZ.

Experimental details
Materials and precursor preparation
Aluminium oxide (Al2O3, 20 wt% in isopropanol), titanium (diisopropoxide) bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TIPD, 75 wt% in isopropanol) and silver wire (Ag, 99.999%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Methylammonium iodide (MAI, ≥99.5%) and lead iodide (PbI2, ≥99.9%) were purchased from Xi’an Polymer Light Technology Corp (China). PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM, ≥95%) were purchased from Clevios and Lumtec, respectively. N,N-Dimethyl formamide (DMF, anhydrous) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous) were used as main solvents. Indium tin oxide-coated glass slides (ITO, ≤15 Ω per square) were cleaned before use.
Device fabrication
ITO substrates were first etched by Zn powders and HCl and then rinsed progressively with distilled water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultra-sonication bath. The PH1000 solution was first diluted with isopropanol in accordance with the volume ratio of 1:1 and then filtered through a 22 μm pore size millipore filter before use, after which the obtained solution was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates at 5000 rpm for 30 s and then annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. The isopropanol dispersion of Al2O3 nanopartices was diluted by isopropanol at a volume ratio of 1 to 6, then spin-coated on ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000 film at 3500 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. After the prepared ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3 films were cooled to room temperature, the samples were moved into a nitrogen glove box (O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm). The CH3NH3PbI3 precursor was prepared by dissolving CH3NH3I and PbI2 powders with a mole ratio of 1:1 (40% by weight) in mixed solvents of composition DMF:DMSO = 9:1 (v/v), which was heated under stirring for 30 min at 50 °C. The CBZ solution was first mixed with the TIPD isopropanol solution at a volume ratio of 1600:1 and then the obtained mixture solution was divided into two parts. The first part was spin-coated on clean glass substrates at 1500 rpm for 60 s and dried at 100 °C (or 25 °C) for 10 minutes to obtain TIPD films. The second part was used to disperse PCBM (20 mg mL−1) for subsequent anti-solvent treatment of the perovskite film. The obtained CH3NH3PbI3 precursor was spin-coated on the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3 film at 4000 rpm for 20 s, after the first 10 s of the spin coating process, the CBZ solution containing PCBM and TIPD was quickly dropped at the film, after which the films were annealed at 90 °C for 10 min to form the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film. When the samples were cooled, a CBZ solution containing only PCBM (20 mg mL−1) was then spin-coated on the top of ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film at 1500 rpm for 60 s, after which the film was annealed at 70 °C for 5 min. Finally, the devices were finished with thermally evaporated 100 nm Ag under a vacuum condition. The effective area for all as-prepared PSCs is 4 mm−2. For performance comparison, the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 films treated with the CBZ solution containing only PCBM are also fabricated for the PSCs. The CBZ solution containing PCBM was quickly dropped at the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 films during spinning. The remaining device preparation process is the same as that of the cells with TIPD.
Characterization
Morphology measurements of the prepared films were performed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (JSM-7001F, Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). The XRD pattern was measured using X-ray diffractometry (DX-2700, Dandong Haoyuan Instrument Company, China). The UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded by a Varian Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the films were measured by the HORIBA Jobin Yvon Fluorolog-3 Spectrofluorometer system using the Xe 900 (450 W xenon arc lamp) as the light source. Time-resolved fluorescence analyses were measured by an Edinburgh Instrument FLS 980 photoluminescence spectrometer. Reconvolution fit analysis was used to fit a measured sample decay to a model function with three exponential terms. The quality of the fit was estimated by the parameter χ2 (0.90 ≤ χ2 ≤ 1.10) and the symmetrical distribution of the residuals about the zero axis. The conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) measurements were performed by a Bruker AFM (Multimode 8.0, Bruker Co, USA). The model of the probe is ASYELEC-01 and the radius of the silicon probe coated Ti/Ir (5/20) is about 28 nm. The photovoltaic performances of the prepared devices were measured using a Keithley 2410 source meter under an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The light intensity was calibrated using a NIST-certified silicon reference solar cell (Newport 532 ISO1599). The J–V characteristics of the prepared solar cells are measured in the forward (from 1.0 V to 0 V) and reverse (from 0 V to 1.0 V) modes at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were performed by a solar cell quantum efficiency test system (Qtest Station 500ADX, United States Dawn Technology Co., Ltd USA). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded by a CHI660E (Chenhua Device Company, Shanghai, China) electrochemical measurement system under illumination of 100 mW cm−2. The measured EIS results were simulated using the Z-view software. The J–V, IPCE and EIS measurements of our devices were performed in ambient atmosphere (55% relative humidity) at room temperature.
Results and discussions

Fig. 2a and b show the top-view SEM images of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film treated with pure CBZ solvent and CBZ solvent containing the PCBM and TIPD, respectively. It can be seen from Fig. 2a that the perovskite film completely covers the porous layer of Al2O3, in which the average size of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals is about 300 nm. However, there are some obvious voids and pinholes between the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals. After the treatment with CBZ solvent containing the PCBM and TIPD, the PCBM and TIPD filled up the voids and pinholes in the perovskite film, which leads to the surface of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film being almost completely covered by PCBM and TIPD and becoming more compact as shown in Fig. 2b. To investigate the effect of PCBM and TIPD on the thickness of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film, Fig. 2c and d display the cross-section SEM images of the ITO/PH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 and ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:PCBM:TIPD films, respectively. It can be observed that, for both films, the thicknesses of the PEDOT:PSSPH1000, Al2O3 and perovskite capping layers are 20 nm, 210 nm, and 300 nm, respectively. Moreover, in order to investigate the chemical stability and confirm the existence of TIPD films after the deposition on the CH3NH3PbI3, the XRD patterns of the TIPD films dried at 100 °C and 25 °C (room temperature) in a nitrogen glove box are shown in Fig. S1 (see ESI†). It can been seen that the TIPD films dried at these two temperatures showed almost identical XRD patterns and no diffraction peaks of TiO2 were found, which confirmed the chemical stability of TIPD.

To further investigate the influence of PCBM and TIPD on surface flatness of the films, the 3-dimensional (3D) AFM height images of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3and ITO/PH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:PCBM: TIPD films are shown in Fig. 2e and f, respectively. The corresponding root-mean-square (rms) roughnesses of the films with and without PCBM:TIPD are 8.10 nm and 9.70 nm, respectively. Therefore, these SEM and AFM results confirm that the PCBM/TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment effectively improves the compactness and flatness of the perovskite film and the incorporation of PCBM and TIPD does not significantly change the thickness of the perovskite layer.
To further investigate the influence of PCBM/TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment on charge transportation and recombination during the photovoltaic process, the local high-resolution photocurrent mappings over the prepared films are measured using c-AFM and the results are shown in Fig. 3. The 2D AFM topographic images of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film with CBZ anti-solvent treatment and ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:PCBM:TIPD film are shown in Fig. 3a and c, respectively. The scan size is 5 μm × 5 μm. The corresponding surface photocurrent images are shown in Fig. 3b and d, respectively. Fig. 3c shows that the variation of the current produced by the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:PCBM:TIPD film is 0.6 pA, which is much smaller than that (1.2 pA) of the current produced by the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film. Therefore, the film with PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment has a more uniform local current distribution compared with the film with pure CBZ anti-solvent treatment, which proves the uniformity and compactness of PCBM:TIPD coverage on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer. The summarized current distribution has been shown in Fig. 3e, from which a higher surface average current value (8.1 pA) for the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:PCBM:TIPD film can be found compared with that (5.6 pA) for the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film, indicating that the deposited PCBM and TIPD can more effectively promote the charge electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 to the PCBM:TIPD.

Fig. 4 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film with and without PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment. It can be seen that the film with the PCBM and TIPD shows slightly increased absorption compared with the film without the PCBM and TIPD, which is mainly attributed to the increased compactness of the perovskite film.38

To investigate the effect of PCBM and TIPD on the electron–hole dynamics at the PEDOT:PSSPH1000/CH3NH3PbI3 and CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM:TIPD interfaces, the PL spectra and time-resolved PL decay transients of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 and ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3:PCBM:TIPD films are measured and the results are shown in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. The 515 nm light is incident from the CH3NH3PbI3 side as the photon excitation and the time-resolved PL decay is probed at 775 nm after light excitation. As seen in Fig. 5a, the film with the PCBM and TIPD exhibited a lower PL emission intensity than that of the film treated with pure CBZ. Considering that it is difficult for electrons to return to the perovskite layer from the PCBM:TIPD blend film due to the presence of an energy barrier at the perovskite/PCBM:TIPD interface (Fig. 1), a non-radiative relaxation process should not occur. Therefore, the main reason for the decreased PL intensity is the photo-generated electron transfer from the CH3NH3PbI3 to the PCBM and TIPD.
 Fig. 5  (a) Photoluminescence spectra of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 and the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM:TIPD films. (b) Normalized photoluminescence decay dynamics of the films probed at 775 nm after excitation at 515 nm (the solid lines are fitted results). 
To further quantitatively study the dynamics of charge extraction, we compared the charge recombination lifetime (τ) obtained by fitting the time-resolved PL decay data (Fig. 5b). The perovskite film treated with pure CBZ exhibited a longer τ (75.45 ns) compared to the film treated with the PCBM and TIPD (17.42 ns). Clearly, for the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 film, only photo-generated holes can be extracted from the perovskite layer to the PH1000 film through the PEDOT:PSSPH1000/CH3NH3PbI3 interface, while for the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM:TIPD film, not only photo-generated holes, but also photo-generated electrons can be also extracted from the perovskite layer to PCBM and TIPD through the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3/TIPD interfaces. Therefore, PCBM and TIPD enables the photo-generated charge to be extracted from the perovskite layer more effectively in the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM:TIPD film, which is in agreement with other results.39

Fig. 6a displays the forward and reverse scanning J–V characteristics of as-prepared PSCs with pure CBZ, PCBM-blended and PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatments under simulated AM1.5 100 mW cm−2 irradiation in a 55% humidity atmosphere. Their corresponding performance parameters are listed in Table 1. The cell treated with pure CBZ anti-solvent achieves a PCE of 10.5%. After PCBM-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment, the PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF of the PSCs are enhanced to 12.9%, 0.90 V, 22.2 mA cm−2 and 0.64, respectively. The improved performance parameters mainly result from the more effective charge extraction through the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM interface owing to the introduction of PCBM.28,40 Moreover, compared to the cell treated with PCBM-blended CBZ anti-solvent, the performance parameters of the cell with PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment, such as PCE, Voc, Jsc and FF, are further improved, as shown in Table 1. The highest PCE of the cell with TIPD is 15.2%, which is 1.45 times and 1.18 times that of the cells treated with pure CBZ and PCBM-blended CBZ, respectively. This can be attributed to the faster charge transport/extraction through the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM and CH3NH3PbI3/TIPD interfaces.14 In addition, for all three types of solar cells, the hysteresis between the forward and reverse scan can be negligible. Fig. 6b compares the incident photo-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and the Jsc values calculated by integration of the IPCE spectra of the cells with and without the PCBM and TIPD, which shows that the cell treated with PCBM and TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent has a slightly stronger IPCE response than the cell treated with pure CBZ in the wavelength range 400–600 nm. The integrated Jsc value (22.3 mA cm−2) for the cell with the PCBM and TIPD is much higher than that (18.5 mA cm−2) for the cell without PCBM and TIPD. The increase in Jsc may mainly be associated with better charge extraction and recombination reduction.41

To evaluate the influence of anti-solvent treatment on the long-term stability of PSCs, the time-dependent PCE retentions were investigated by current J–V characteristics for 280 h without any encapsulation process in ambient atmosphere (55% relative humidity), which is shown in Fig. 6c. The cell with pure CBZ lost 80.0% of its original efficiency within 280 h, compared to a 64.0% reduction in PCE of the cell with PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment in the same period and conditions. One obvious reason for the improved stability of PSCs with PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment may be the enhanced compactness of the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM:TIPD composite film (Fig. 2), which slows the penetration of moisture and oxygen into the perovskite active layer.
To evaluate the influence of TIPD on the density of defect states, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements are employed for the cells with and without the TIPD, as shown in Fig. 6d. As the defects are gradually filled by the injected charge, the current is gradually increased. When the applied bias voltage reaches a certain value, that is, defect state filling voltage (VTFL), the current will increase rapidly and nonlinearly after the defect is completely filled. The density of defect states (ntrap) can be calculated by equation ntrap = 2ε0εVTFL/eL2,42 where ε0 (= 8.854 × 10−12 F m−1), ε (= 32), e (= 1.6 × 10−19 C) and L are vacuum permittivity, the dielectric constants of CH3NH3PbI3, the elementary charge and the thickness of the active layer, respectively. After the deposition of TIPD, the VTFL of the cell treated with PCBM:TIPD-blended anti-solvent drops to 0.11 V from that (0.38 V) of the cell treated with PCBM-dispersed anti-solvent. Therefore, the ntrap decreases from 5.38 × 1015 cm−3 to 1.55 × 1015 cm−3, suggesting that the defects in CH3NH3PbI3 have been passivated effectively with the TIPD.
In order to analyze the effect of TIPD on the atomic-scale charge separation and transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/TIPD interface, the interactions between the TIPD and CH3NH3PbI3 are studied by first-principles calculations. We used a periodic slab model with the TIPD adsorbed on the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 (001) surface (for more details see ESI†). Before the contact of CH3NH3PbI3 and TIPD, as is shown in Fig. 7a, an angle of about 90° between the alignment directions of the neighboring MA molecules in the CH3NH3PbI3 was found. After the contact, as shown in Fig. 7b, it can be surprisingly found that the MA molecules have the same orientation for all MA molecules in the top layer, whereas the others having a 90° rotation between two neighboring MA molecules (Fig. 7c). A theoretical discussion about the rotation of the MA molecules has recently been reported.43 In order to investigate the effect of orientation alignment of MA molecules on charge transfer at the CH3NH3PbI3/TIPD interface, the electric dipole moment of MA molecules and the corresponding electrostatic potential (ESP) distribution are calculated and shown in Fig. 7d. It can be clearly seen that the direction of a single MA molecule points from the C atom to the N atom, which presents an angle of about 45° with the [001] direction (i.e., the c-axis direction). Furthermore, the ESP distribution of the MA molecule shows that the positive potential around the N atom is higher than that of the C atom, suggesting that the direction of the electric field generated by the electric dipole moment is opposite to the direction of the electric dipole moment, pointing from the N atom to the C atom. Therefore, the component of the generated electric field along the [001] direction is along the negative c-axis, which will effectively promote the transfer of photo-generated electrons from CH3NH3PbI3 to the PCBM:TIPD layer and thus increases the photocurrent of PSCs with TIPD.

(d) Electric dipole moment and electrostatic potential (ESP) mapped electronic density of the MA molecule. The ESP ranges from −0.1 (red) to 0.7 (blue) a.u., and the density isovalue is 0.05 electrons Bohr−3. 
To reveal the kinetic mechanism of MA molecular alignment and its effect on the stability of as-prepared PSCs with TIPD, the local charge density redistribution at the CH3NH3PbI3/TIPD interface has been calculated and displayed in Fig. 8, which shows that there are a large number of electron accumulation regions near the O atom of the TIPD while a large number of electron depletion regions exist near the Pb atom of the CH3NH3PbI3, indicating that there is a significant electrostatic interaction between the O atom and the Pb atom. Therefore, when the I− ions in the PbI6-octahedron network are vacant, the O2− ions can play the role of I− ions to attract Pb2+ ions, thus passivating the defect states caused by under-coordinated Pb ions and stabilizing the PbI6-octahedron in the CH3NH3PbI3 at the CH3NH3PbI3/TIPD interface, which may be another reason for the more stable performance of the PSCs with TIPD. In addition, it can be also found that, due to the interfacial interaction, a large number of negatively charged electrons accumulate on the I atoms in the CH3NH3PbI3, which can attract the positively charged N atoms of the MA molecule and thus leads to a uniform alignment by a rotation of MA.

To investigate the effect of anti-solvent treatment on the interfacial charge transfer properties of PH1000-based PSCs, the EIS spectra were measured under short-circuit conditions with a frequency range from 100 mHz to 1 MHz. Fig. S2 (ESI†) presented the measured Nyquist plots of the PEDOT:PSSPH1000-based cells treated with pure CBZ and PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ. To study the influence of the PCBM:TIPD blend film on charge transfer and charge recombination at the perovskite/ETL and perovskite/HTL interfaces, the equivalent circuit shown in the inset is used for impedance fits.8,44 The detailed fitting parameters are presented in Table S1 (ESI†). The ohmic series resistance of the cell is represented by Rs, including the sheet resistance of the PEDOT:PSSPH1000 layer, the PCBM:TIPD layer, and the CH3NH3PbI3 resistance. The first semicircle at high frequency refers to the RCT1 for the charge transfer resistance at the HTL/photoactive layer interface. The second semicircle at middle frequency refers to the RCT2 for the charge transfer resistance at the photoactive layer/ETL interface. The lower ohmic series resistance and charge-transfer resistances (i.e., RCT1 and RCT2) could result in a more effective charge-transfer and a rapid transporting ability for the electron and hole, which would lead to a reduced charge recombination in the cells. It can be clearly seen from Table S1 (ESI†) that, compared to the cell with pure CBZ anti-solvent treatment, the Rs, RCT1 and RCT2 values of the cell with PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent treatment decreased significantly, which indicates that the charge recombination at the PEDOT:PSSPH1000/CH3NH3PbI3 and the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM:TIPD interfaces could be effectively reduced due to the introduction of PCBM and TIPD and would further improve the performance of the ITO/PEDOT:PSSPH1000/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/Ag cell, which is consistent with the results of the first principles calculations.
Conclusions
In summary, the PCBM:TIPD-blended CBZ anti-solvent method is applied to improve the performance and stability of PSCs based on a PH1000 hole transport layer, which aids the preparation of high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films during perovskite spin-coating. The incorporated PCBM and TIPD in the CH3NH3PbI3 films effectively improved the electron–hole separation and charge extraction at the CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM:TIPD interface due to the orientation alignment of MA molecules, which mainly helped in increasing the charge recombination resistance in the PSCs and thus contributed to the PCE enhancement. Besides, due to the reduced defect states resulting from the electrostatic interaction between the O atoms of TIPD and the Pb atoms of CH3NH3PbI3, the stability of the PSCs with PCBM and TIPD are also significantly improved. The highest PCE of 15.2% was achieved by the PSCs with PCBM and TIPD-blended chlorobenzene anti-solvent treatment, which shows a 45% improvement compared to that of 10.5% achieved by the PSCs with pure chlorobenzene anti-solvent treatment and an 18% improvement compared to that of 12.9% of PSCs with PCBM-blended anti-solvent treatment.
