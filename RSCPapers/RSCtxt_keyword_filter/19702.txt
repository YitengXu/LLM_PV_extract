    , Accepted 25th April 2012First published on 3rd May 2012AbstractThrough elongating the end or side alkyl chains of dye molecules, we decorate anatase nanocrystals with a thicker organic assembly featuring a smaller tilt angle of the D–π-A backbone with respect to the surface normal, which retards the interfacial charge recombination and confers a higher photovoltage output on mesoscopic cobalt solar cells displaying an over 10% power conversion efficiency at the AM1.5G conditions.
A modulation of the assembly of organic molecules on nanocrystalline titania is of central importance to ascertain the operation mechanism of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs)1 and pave the way for further cell performance improvement. The assembly microstructure could be remarkably influenced by many factors such as dye structure,2 dye-bath solvent,3 titania substrate,4 temperature5 and dipping time.6 In this regard, a large amount of research effort has been devoted to tethering various chromophores with alkyl chains so as to enhance the cell performance.7–9 The introduction of alkyl chains is usually believed to significantly reduce the π–π stacking of conjugated dye molecules on the titania surface and thereby attenuate the adverse intermolecular exciton annihilation.8c Furthermore, the alkyl chain itself may also effectively inhibit the recombination of titania electrons with oxidant species in electrolytes or hole-transporting materials.7a,b,8b
A remarkable progress on the utilization of outer-sphere electron mediators for iodine-free DSCs has been witnessed in the past years, with a new efficiency paradigm of 12.1% achieved by the cock-tail staining of a mesoporous titania film with a zinc–porphyrin dye and a cyclopentadithiophene dye, in conjunction with the tris(2,2′-bipyridine)cobalt(II/III) redox couple.10 In this contribution, we architect favorable molecular assemblies of metal-free organic dye molecules on the titania surface via elongating the end or side alkyl chains and demonstrate over 10% cells employing the tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt (Co–phen) redox shuttle, with an overall analysis on the tilt angle of dye molecules on titania, loading amount and molecule size related inelastic mean free path of electrons. These factors together impact the effective thickness of organic coatings on nanocrystalline titania, which plays a pivotal role in the attenuation of interfacial charge recombination, one key photovoltage determinant.
Four organic dyes presented in Scheme 1 with identical frontier orbital are selected in this study. The monochromatic incident photon-to-collected electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) of dye-coated double-layer titania films were first measured in combination with a Co–phen electrolyte. The details for cell fabrication are described in the Experimental section. As depicted in Fig. 1a, these dyes exhibit similar photocurrent action spectra with an alike onset wavelength at 750 nm and a comparable maximal IPCE value of over 80%.

However, both the end and side alkyl chain extendings evoke an evident influence on photocurrent–voltage (j–V) characteristics (Fig. 1b and c) measured at an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2, simulated AM1.5 sunlight. A typical cell with the C224 dye molecules on titania has a short-circuit photocurrent density (jsc) of 14.86 mA cm−2, an open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.84 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.753, affording a power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.4%. Upon alternation of the ethyl side chains with n-dodecyl, the corresponding C220 dye displays a significantly enhanced Voc of 0.93V, leading to a progressive η of 10.1%. Detailed photovoltaic parameters are collected in Table 1. A similar phenomenon is also perceived when the end alkyl chains are prolonged. As shown in Fig. 1c, the C235 dye featuring two n-dodecyl end chains also generates a cell efficiency of 10.1% with a jsc of 14.55 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.93 V and a FF of 0.743, mainly benefiting from a significant improvement of Voc by 100 mV with respect to the C234 dye bearing two ethyl end chains.

a The validity of our photovoltaic data is confirmed by comparing the calculated jscvia wavelength integration of the product of the standard AM1.5 emission spectrum (ASTM G173-03) and measured IPCE spectra with the experimental jsc, showing a less than 5% error. Also note that all our cells show a linear dependence of photocurrent on the light intensity.

For a defined redox electrolyte in DSCs, it is known that a variance of electron quasi-Fermi-level (EF,n) in titania can evoke a rise or fall of Voc. A displacement of EF,n could be caused by a fluctuation of titania conduction band edge (Ec) and/or a variation of free electron density (n) as described by the following equation (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and Nc is the density of states in the titania conduction band. Herein, we first employed the impedance spectroscopy (IS)11 method to examine the impact of alkyl chain elongations in push–pull cyclopentadithiophne molecules on Ec by analyzing the chemical capacitance (Cμ) of dye-coated mesoporous titania films, which is exponentially dependent on the potential bias (V) and can be described as12 (2)where Nt is the total density of surface states of a nanocrystalline titania film, e is the elementary charge, d is the titania film thickness, p is the titania film porosity and Tc is a characteristic parameter, which depicts the distribution profile width of interband states. An appropriate equivalent circuit based on the transmission line model proposed by Bisquert11 was used to extract Cμ, which is plotted against V as presented in Fig. 2a, showing that cells made from these four cyclopentadithiophene dyes with different alkyl chain patterns should have very similar distributions of interband states and conduction band edges of the semiconducting titania electrode. We further scrutinized the electron density n of an open-circuit DSC in contribution to EF,n. Note that the electron density in titania is kinetically balanced by the flux of charge photogeneration and that of charge recombination, the former of which being comparable in all cells studied here. The charge recombination can be evaluated by measuring the lifetime (τ) of electrons in titania films with IS.11 As illustrated in Fig. 2b and c, at a given density of states (DOS, DOS = 6.24 × 1018 × Cμ/[d(1 – p)]), the electron lifetimes of cells with longer alkyl chains are about one-order longer than those with ethyl chains, evoking a higher electron density in titania and thus a rise of Voc.
 Fig. 2  (a) Chemical capacitance (Cμ) as well as density of states (DOS) and (b, c) apparent electron lifetime (τ). 
Apart from molecule size, the dye loading amount should also contribute to the blocking effect of dye coatings on titania, being 3.3 × 10−8, 2.8 × 10−8, 3.2 × 10−8 and 3.0 × 10−8 mol cm−2 μm−1 as measured for C224, C220, C234 and C235, respectively. The dye loading amount is reduced concomitant with the increase of alkyl chain length. This disadvantageous factor has aroused us to seriously consider on how dyes with longer alkyl chains can form a more effective organic blocking network on titania to attenuate the charge recombination between titania electrons and cobalt(III) in our redox electrolyte.
To understand its possible microscopic picture, we resorted to the transient absorption spectroscopy technique13 to probe the relative tilt angle of dye molecules with respect to the titania surface normal, via measuring the kinetics of charge recombination between photoinjected electrons in titania and oxidized dye molecules. In our experiments, a 765 nm probe light was utilized on account of a strong absorption of these oxidized dye molecules in the near-infrared region14 and an optimal sensitivity of the used photomultiplier tube detector. The excitation wavelengths were carefully selected according to an optical density of ∼0.2 of dye-coated titania films immersed in an inert electrolyte (0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile), ensuring a similar profile of photocarrier generation in the studied samples. By fitting the absorption decay traces (Fig. 3) with a stretched exponential function (ΔA ∝ A × exp[–(t/τ)β]), the average times of these charge recombination processes can be obtained, being 4, 20, 3 and 14 ms for C224, C220, C234 and C235, respectively. In light of the Marcus electron transfer theory, the charge recombination reaction is involved in the change of Gibbs free energy, reorganization energy and electronic coupling factor, the latter of which is closely related to the tunneling distance. The Gibbs free energies of charge recombination reactions are comparable due to the identical redox potential of these four dye molecules, while the reorganization energies are calculated with the TD-DFT method to be 98, 87, 90 and 87 meV for C224, C220, C234 and C235, respectively. Thereby, a reduced charge recombination rate along with the increase of alkyl chain length could be ascribed to a longer tunneling distance between titania electrons and triphenylamine holes,15,16 giving a clue on the tilt angle of dye backbone with respect to titania surface as depicted in Scheme 2.

Laser fluence: 22 μJ cm−2; excitation wavelength: 645 nm (C224), 635 nm (C220), 645 nm (C234) and 634 nm (C235). Smooth lines are stretched exponential fittings over raw data obtained by averaging 300 laser shots.

The mean thickness (d) of dye coatings on titania is further elaborated by comparing the intensity (I) damping of Ti2p3/2 signal originating from the substrate with the aid of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, assuming that the dye covered and uncovered samples contain only small amounts of contaminants.17,18 If the dye layers are homogeneous, the intensity of Ti2p3/2 froms a dye molecule covered titania can be described by using a two-layer model19 (3)where I0 is the intensity of titania substrate without coverage, α is the electron take-off angle of 90°, λ is the inelastic mean free path (IMFP) of electrons in dye molecules, which are calculated as 31 Å for C224 and C234, and 32 Å for C220 and C235.20 As shown in Fig. 4, compared with the uncovered substrate, the intensity of Ti2p3/2 of dye-coated substrate is clearly attenuated because a dye molecule layer on titania surface can block the escape of photoemitted electrons from titania to vacuum. The diminishment is more obvious for dyes with two n-dodecyl side or end chains. On the basis of Ti2p3/2 intensity values listed in Table S1 of ESI†, the mean thicknesses of dye molecule layers are derived to be 14, 22, 12 and 23 Å for C224, C220, C234 and C235, respectively. The tendency of the relative thickness of organic coatings is in general agreement with that of the aforementioned charge recombination evaluated through IS measurements.
 Fig. 4  The Ti2p3/2 photoelectron signal originating from the titania substrate. A decrease of the Ti2p signal suggests an increased mean thickness of the absorbed organic layer on titania surface. 
In summary, we have tailored the assembly of dye molecules on titania surface through side or end alkyl chain elongation to yield a thicker organic blocking layer with a smaller molecule tilt angle with respect to the substrate normal, which overwhelms the adverse effect of a decrease of dye loading amount. Our work will shed light on the future design of higher performance sensitizers and device optimization by considering the microstructure of dye molecule assembly on titania and its correlation with interface energetics and kinetics.
Experimental section
Materials
The syntheses of C22414 and C22021 were reported in our previous papers and the preparation details of C234 and C235 are presented in ESI.†
Cell fabrication and photovoltaic characterization
A 7.0 μm thick transparent layer of 22 nm-sized titania particles screen-printed on FTO and further covered by a 3.6 μm thick layer of scattering titania particles (WER4-O, Dyesol) was used as the negative electrode of cells presented in this work. The titania electrodes (∼0.28 cm2) were stained for 12 h in 150 μM dye solutions with acetonitrile and tert-butanol as solvent (weight ratio 1∶1), rinsed copiously with acetonitrile and dried by air flow before cell fabrication. Details on preparation of titania nanocrystals, paste for screen-printing, nanostructured titania film, cell construction and photovoltaic characterization were described in previous papers.22,23 The employed electrolyte was composed of 0.25 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(II) di[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.05 M tris(1,10-phenanthroline)cobalt(III) tris[bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide], 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine and 0.1 M lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide in acetonitrile.
Impedance spectroscopy measurements
Impedance spectroscopy measurements were carried out on an Autolab-PGSTAT302N electrochemical workstation by setting a frequency range from 50 mHz to 100 kHz and a potential modulation of 10 mV. A high-power white LED was employed to supply various irradiation intensities on the testing cell. A potential bias (V) was applied to equal the open-circuit photovoltage of the testing cell under each irradiation, fulfilling the criterion of an unmodulated current of zero. The measured impedance spectra were fitted with an appropriate equivalent circuit11 using the Z-view software (v2.80, Scribner Associates Inc.).
Transient absorption kinetic measurements
Transient absorption kinetic measurements were performed with a LP920 laser flash spectrometer, with a pump pulse from a nanosecond, wavelength-tunable OPOLett-355II laser. The sample was kept at a 45° angle with respect to the excitation beam. The xenon arc lamp probe light was passed through a bandpass filter with a center wavelength of 765 nm and a testing sample, detected by a fast photomultiplier tube and recorded with a TDS 3012C digital signal analyzer.
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements
The X-ray photoelectron spectra were measured with an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer equipped with a hemispherical electron energy analyzer using the Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) and an energy step of 0.1 eV. The electron take-off angle was 90°. Photoelectron spectra were recorded in constant analyzer energy mode. The spectra are energy calibrated by setting the Ti2p3/2 substrate signal to 458.6 eV.24 Charging and radiation effects during the measurements were monitored and were found negligible for all spectra in these investigations.
