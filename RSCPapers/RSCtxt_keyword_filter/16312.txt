    , Accepted 12th August 2020First published on 13th August 2020AbstractA series of new metal-free organic dyes based on 3,3′-dithioalkyl-2,2′-bithiophene (SBT) organic chromophores was synthesized for use in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Because S(alkyl)⋯S(thiophene) intermolecular interlocking renders the twist angle in the structure as <1°, the SBT core is almost flat, as evidenced by the single crystal, optical, and electrochemical data. Through structural modification of SBT π-linkers with different alkyl chains and conjugated thiophene units, significant chromophore aggregation and interfacial charge recombination can be inhibited. Among all the dyes synthesized, the optimized dye (having a high extinction coefficient of 1.3 × 104 cm−1 M−1 at 497 nm) with the co-adsorbent chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) reached a power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.46% under 1 sun (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2). After 1000 h of testing under 1 sun, a solar cell made with this dye and the co-adsorbent CDCA still maintained 88% of its initial efficiency, compared to 69% for a cell made with N719 dye. Moreover, when tested under a T5 fluorescent lamp of 2400 lux, the η of this dye with CDCA was 12.34%.
1. Introduction
Due to the limited resources of natural fossil fuels, including natural gas, coal, and petrochemicals, as well as their negative impact on global climate, it is necessary to increase our utilization of solar, wind, and water energy, as well as other clean and renewable energy sources. Among them, a particularly promising solution is to convert solar energy into other forms of energy, such as electricity or fuel. Among various types of solar cells, there has been great interest in the dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), which was first reported by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991.1–3 Compared with the traditional silicon-based solar cell, the solar cell fabricated by this design possesses light weight, low cost, easy preparation, and greater flexibility.4–13
Since the first report in 1991, many highly effective photosensitizers have been synthesized.12,14–17 As an important part of DSSCs, the photosensitizer determines the performance of photovoltaic devices to a great extent. In order to increase the power conversion efficiency (η) of DSSCs, the key strategy for designing photosensitizers is to broaden the spectrum and increase the molar extinction coefficient to harvest more photons from solar radiation. To improve DSSC performance, it is a major challenge to increase the effective electron injection at the dye/nanoparticle interface while reducing energy loss, especially the energy loss that occurs during electron injection.18–23 Through the choice of π-segment, not only can the electronic characteristics of the organic dye itself be adjusted, but the energy and kinetic characteristics of the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface can also be affected during the electron injection and regeneration processes, thereby influencing the overall performance of the cell.24–31 In DSSC devices, the injection of electrons from excited dyes to TiO2 is a very complex process in which losses of energy occur during dye excitation, vibrational relaxation of excited dyes, and electron injection.31
Over the past few years, there has been enormous interest in metal-free organic dyes due to their unique advantages such as adjustable molecular engineering, low cost, tunable absorption, and electrochemical properties.32,33 An η value greater than 14% can be attained for organic dyes when using a co-sensitization and co-adsorbent strategy.34 Some metal-free organic dyes with high efficiencies of 12.535 and 12.6%36 have been reported. The majority of these organic dyes have a donor–π-spacer–acceptor (D–π–A) structure,37–40 which consists of triphenylamines as donors,41,42 π-conjugated organic units as spacers,43 and cyanoacrylic acid as acceptors.44–46 For an organic dye to attain commercialization, it must have a simple structure and be easy to synthesize with a minimum number of steps. It should be noted that the judicious modification of spacer units and alkyl chain engineering on the spacer can significantly enhance the η of an organic dye.47–51
Here, we have introduced a newly synthesized dithioalkyl bithiophene (SBT) unit,52 which consists of two sulphur atoms in alkyl side chains and an SBT unit that is completely planar because it possesses intramolecular locks with the two adjacent thiophene atoms. This highly planar conjugated unit is an attractive π-conjugated spacer that can be used to create a simple, new organic dye. Therefore, we have synthesized new organic dyes comprised of the SBT unit as a π-conjugated spacer with different alkyl side chains such as linear (n-butyl; a), branched (iso-butyl; b, and tert-butyl; c), cyclic (cyclohexyl; d), and aromatic (phenyl; e) moieties. Using this highly planar conjugated unit, a new organic dye with an impressive η of 9.46% was found under 1 sun. The dye also exhibited an η of 12.34% under a T5 fluorescent illumination of 2400 lux.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Design of SBT dyes
The synthetic approach to the SBT dyes 1–5 is displayed in Scheme 1. First, nucleophilic substitution of dibromobithiophene 6 with thiolalkylated anion in the presence of CuO/KI affords 7, which was then dibrominated with NBS to give 8. Monobrominated SBT derivative 9 was obtained by the Stille cross coupling reaction of 8 with stannylated triphenylamine (11). Then, compound 9 coupled with (5-(1,3-dioxolan-2-yl)thiophen-2-yl)tributylstannane via Stille reaction in the presence of Pd(PPh3)4 yielded the corresponding aldehyde 10. Finally, the desired dyes 1–5 were prepared by condensation of aldehyde 10 with cyanoacetic acid in the presence of piperidine. All five dyes were characterized by conventional chemical and physical methods. The synthesis details for the compounds studied in this work are presented in the ESI,† and the synthetic route for the dyes studied in this work is shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†).

2.2. Synthesis and material description
The starting materials (from Aldrich, Arco, or TCI Chemical Co.) were reagent grade and were used without further purification unless otherwise indicated. Reaction solvents (toluene, ether, and tetrahydrofuran) were distilled under nitrogen from sodium/benzophenoneketyl, and halogenated solvents were distilled from CaH2. Compounds 6, 7, and 8 were synthesized according to our earlier report.52
2.3. Characterization

1H and 13C NMR was recorded using a Bruker 500 or 300 instrument for all materials, with reference to solvent signals. The 1H NMR spectra for the compounds studied are included in Fig. S1–S15 of the ESI.† UV-Vis absorption was performed in the indicated solvents at room temperature with a JASCO V-530 spectrometer. Differential pulse voltammetry experiments were performed with a conventional three-electrode configuration (a platinum disk working electrode, an auxiliary platinum wire electrode, and a non-aqueous Ag reference electrode, with a supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) in the specified dry solvent) using a CHI621C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments). All electrochemical potentials were referenced to an Fc+/Fc internal standard (at 0.6 V). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were carried out to investigate the influence of side chain moieties and placement on the twisting of the conjugated backbone. All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 Revision suite of programs.
2.4. General procedure for Stille cross-coupling reactions of (9a–e)
Under anhydrous conditions, Pd(PPh3)4 (0.05 equiv.) was added to a solution of dibrominated compounds (8a–e; 1 equiv.) and mono-stannylated TPA-SnBu3 (1.3 equiv.) in dry toluene. The resulting mixture was refluxed overnight under nitrogen. After removal of solvent, the obtained residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with dichloromethane and hexanes as the eluents to obtain compounds 9a–e, which are shown in Fig. 1.

2.5. General procedure for 10a–e
A mixture of the stannyl compound (1.2 equiv.), 9a–e (1.0 equiv.), and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.05 equiv.) was degassed in toluene (30 mL) and heated to reflux for 20 h. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the crude product was dissolved in dichloromethane. Then, a few drops of 1 M HCl were added, the solution was stirred for 30 min at room temperature, the dichloromethane layer was washed with water and evaporated, and the product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel (hexane/dichloromethane 5:1) to obtain the desired carbaldehyde 10a–e, which is shown in Fig. 2.

2.6. General procedure for the final target compounds 1–5
Aldehyde 10a–e (1.0 equiv.), cyanoacetic acid (3.0 equiv.), and a few drops of piperidine were dissolved in chloroform (30 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere and heated to reflux overnight. After the completion of the reaction, water was added, neutralized with dil. HCl, and the product was extracted with dichloromethane, washed with brine, and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The crude product was purified by column chromatography with dichloromethane/hexanes as the eluent. It was then further purified by trituration with methanol to yield the desired compounds 1–5, which are shown in Fig. 3.

2.7. Cell assembly description
The source materials used for this procedure are presented in the ESI.† The TiO2 layer prepared in this study was used as a photoanode. The cell consisted of three sequential layers: a compact layer (thickness of approximately 100 nm), a transparent layer (thickness of approximately 10 μm), and a scattering layer (thickness of approximately 4 μm). First, TiO2 paste (TTIP in 2-methoxyethanol (weight ratio = 1/3)) was spin-coated onto clean fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass as a thin dense layer, where the transparent layer and the scattering layer were coated by the doctor blade method to maintain an active area of 0.196 cm2. Here, a commercially available transparent paste (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP, average diameter of approximately 20 nm) was used to prepare the transparent layer, and a self-assembled scattering paste was further used to prepare the scattering layer. The TiO2 scattering paste was prepared in the laboratory by the following three-step method: (1) To a 0.1 M nitric acid aqueous solution, a 0.5 M TTIP solution was added under constant stirring; the solution was heated to 88 °C and then maintained at that temperature for 8 h. (2) The solution was cooled to room temperature, transferred to an autoclave (PARR 4540, USA), slowly heated to 240 °C, and maintained at this temperature for 12 h; at this stage, the average diameter of TiO2 nanoparticles was approximately 20 nm. (3) The TiO2 scattering layer paste was created by adding 25 wt% polyethylene glycol (PEG, MW approximately 20000) and 100 wt% commercial light-scattering TiO2 particles (ST-41) to the concentrated TiO2 colloid.
Before the next coating, each TiO2 layer was sintered for 30 minutes by slowly raising the temperature from room temperature to 500 °C. After sintering, the TiO2 film was immersed in each organic dye solution (3 × 10−4 M of organic dye in tBA, ACN, and DCM (volume ratio of 1:1:8)) for 24 h at room temperature. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode was coupled with a platinum counter electrode, and Surlyn® film with a thickness of 25 μm was used as the spacer to fix the cell gap. The cell was sealed by heating. The electrolyte was injected into the cell gap between the two electrodes by capillarity. The electrolyte was prepared by mixing 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.6 M DMPII, and 0.5 M tBP in ACN/MPN (volume ratio = 1/1). The pre-drilled inlet hole for injection of electrolyte was finally covered with an epoxy resin glue in order to prevent evaporation of the solvent.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optical and electrochemical characterization
The optical absorption spectra of these dyes in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution are shown in Fig. 4a. All five compounds exhibited an intense linear absorption in the UV-Vis region. The spectra of the molecules in solution represent two absorption bands. The absorption at a shorter wavelength appearing at 350–420 nm is attributed to π–π* transitions, and the longer wavelength at 420–650 nm is the charge transfer (CT) band. The energy gaps derived from the absorption onset are 1.98–2.03 eV, as summarized in Table 1. The molar extinction coefficients or molar absorptivities (ε) are 497 (1.3 × 104 cm−1 M−1), 482 (2.2 × 104 cm−1 M−1), 497 (2.3 × 104 cm−1 M−1), 488 (2.4 × 104 cm−1 M−1), and 488 (1.6 × 104 cm−1 M−1) for compounds 1–5, respectively.

To estimate the electrochemical properties of the organic dyes, differential pulse voltammetry (DPVs) was performed in o-dichlorobenzene with a 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 solution at 25 °C. Fc/Fc+ was used as an internal standard and calibrated at +0.60 V, assuming ferrocene/ferrocenium oxidized at −4.8 V. The oxidation potential curves are shown in Fig. 4b, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. The oxidation potential (Eox) values of the dyes are estimated from the first oxidation peaks, ranging from 0.89 to 1.01 V; this potential decreases in the order of 5 > 3 > 4 > 2 > 1. The corresponding highest occupied molecular orbitals (EHOMO) of 1–5 are −5.09, −5.10, −5.19, −5.12, and −5.21 eV, respectively, as estimated according to the equation: HOMO = −(4.2 + Eox), as shown in Fig. 4c. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (ELUMO) were calculated from the optical energy gap (EHOMO + ΔEg). As expected, the HOMO energy levels are upshifted from phenyl/t-butyl dye (5/4) to n-butyl-substituted dye (1), with the latter possessing the most planar π-conjugated spacer (via infrared).
3.2. Molecular orbital computations and crystal structure
Electronic structure calculations were accomplished at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of density functional theory (DFT) to calculate the charge excitation behaviour of the SBT dyes. Fig. 6a shows a demonstration of computed energy levels and distribution of the Frontier molecular orbitals. Theoretical calculations show that the HOMOs of these compounds are delocalized on mainly donor units and are partially extended to the SBT spacer, while the LUMOs are mainly delocalized on acceptor units and are also partially extended to the spacer. The calculated HOMO and LUMO energy levels for SBT dyes are −4.99 to −5.07 eV and −2.71 to −2.77 eV, respectively. The simulations also indicate that dye 1 has the smallest energy gap, which is in good agreement with the electrochemical and optically derived data. Single crystals of the three SBT spacer units 8a, 7c, and 8e were obtained and show that the alkyl chains play a strong role in planarizing the spacer backbone, as shown in Fig. 5. The top views of two stacking SBT spacers 8a, 7c, and 8e are shown in Fig. 5A–C, and the intramolecular S(alkyl)⋯S(thiophene) distances are 3.04, 3.18, and 3.05 Å, respectively. These distances are below the sum of the van der Waals radii of two S atoms (approximately 1.8 Å), indicating an intramolecular lock between S(Thio)⋯S(R). Fig. 5D–F show the front view and dihedral angles between two thiophenes of the spacer (SBT) units 8a, 7c, and 8e, respectively. The dihedral angles in both 8a and 8e are 0°, which indicates that the two thiophene molecules are completely planar, and the alkyl chains are elongated on the opposite side and perpendicular to the spacer units. In contrast, when introducing the bulkier alkyl chains, such as the tertiary butyl group, the dihedral angle in the spacer is approximately 24°, which elongates on the same side of the spacer unit. Side views of 8a, 7c, and 8e and the bending angles of the alkyl chains with respect to the SBT spacers are 101°, 104°, and 102°, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5G–I.

The deposition numbers are CCDC 1980004 for 8a, 1980005 for 7c, and 1980006 for 8e.† 
3.3. Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic characteristics of the devices with these dyes were measured by applying the irradiation of AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2), and the resultant J–V plot is shown in Fig. 6b. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. The DSSC with dye 1 displays the most optimal result with obtained short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), and η of 16.67 mA cm−2, 734.7 mV, 0.67, and 8.24% respectively. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra for the devices with five dyes are given in Fig. 7, and the corresponding JSC-IPCE values are summarized in Table 2. The higher η for the SBT-series dyes was understood from the IPCE spectra with a larger photocurrent.53 It is worth mentioning that according to the results of Fig. 4a and 7, the IPCE data involve the conversion efficiency between the incident photons and the released electrons of a DSSC under different wavelength conditions, and JSC-IPCE values are related to the JSC values of a DSSC. However, the UV-Vis absorption spectrum only offers the absorption intensity of the dye at different wavelengths; it does not provide information regarding electron transfer in a DSSC. Namely, it can only preliminarily judge the absorption capacity of the dye at various wavelengths.54–56 In addition, EIS analysis was performed to quantify the electrical changes in different cells, especially interfacial charge transfer reactions, where fixed frequency range (10 mHz to 65 kHz) and potential (0.78 V) were applied. The corresponding Nyquist plot is shown in Fig. 8.

Table 3 summarizes the electrochemical and recombination parameters of the DSSCs with various dyes, and shows that the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) values increased in the order of 2 < 5 < 3 < 4 < 1, which reveals that the charge recombination of the I3− ion in the electrolyte is reduced by the incorporation of the linear short chain in 1. A larger Rrec value was noted due to the lower recombination reaction at the interface. As the Rrec value increases, the charge carrier recombination becomes more difficult, thereby reducing the spatial electron–hole overlap. These characteristics significantly inhibit the possibility of overall charge carrier recombination in the device. As a result, a higher Rrec value would lead to a larger VOC value. This indicates that there is a high correlation between the influence of the chemical composition on the separation/recombination kinetics of the carrier and the power conversion efficiency (η), which is consistent with data from previous studies.57,58 In fact, the results for the electrochemical and recombination parameters of the DSSCs with various dyes (Table 3) are consistent with the results for the photovoltaic parameters of the pertinent dyes (Table 2). The charge transfer properties of the DSSCs were estimated under 1 sun using the EIS. The EIS curves (Fig. 9a) indicate that the diameter of the middle semicircle increases in the order of 1 < 4 < 3 < 5 < 2, suggesting that the electron recombination resistance increases from 1 to 2. Fig. 9b shows the Bode plots, from which the electron lifetime (τe) is obtained. The value of τe for a recombination reaction was estimated using the value of fmax, where τe = (2πfmax)−1,59 as tabulated in Table 3.

The values of τe measured for dyes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are 3.91, 3.43, 3.75, 3.76, and 3.45 ms, respectively. The longer value of τe that was obtained with dye 1 indicates the smaller back recombination reaction of the injected electron with I3−. This is seen in the improvements in photocurrent and photovoltage, as well as the overall device η. The effect of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) concentration on the photovoltaic properties of the DSSCs with dye 1 was examined, and the resultant photovoltaic values are listed in Table 4. The J–V characteristics are presented in Fig. 10. Although the aggregation of dyes is suppressed by the introduction of CDCA, it does reduce the amount of dye absorption on TiO2. Noticeably, the η of the cells with 1 decreased as the amount of CDCA added increased to more than 20 mM.

More evidence is provided by EIS data, and all the electrochemical parameters obtained from EIS are shown in Table 5. Fig. 11 presents the EIS results for the cells using 1 with different CDCA concentrations, tested under dark conditions. The diameter of this EIS curve follows the order of 0 M < 20 mM, which reveals that dyes with various concentrations of CDCA have different charge-recombination resistances. The EIS data (Fig. 12a) show that the charge transfer resistance at the interface of the photoanode/electrolyte (Rct2) follows the order of 0 M > 20 mM. Furthermore, the τe can be obtained from the angular frequency (ωmin) at the mid-frequency peak in the Bode phase plot (Fig. 12b). The obtained τe values become longer for all the devices with CDCA.

3.4. Photovoltaic performance at different illumination powers
The dye was investigated under illumination of T5 light sources with different intensities ranging from 900 to 4800 lux, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 6. From this result, dye 1 at 2400 lux light intensity gave an excellent η of 12.34%, with JSC = 256.5 μA cm−2, VOC = 558.58 mV, and FF = 0.66. The obtained photovoltaic results are comparatively higher than those of cells irradiated at other light intensities. Fig. 13 shows the corresponding J–V curves for both N719 dye and dye 1 (with 20 mM CDCA) illuminated with a T5 light source at 2400 lux.

3.5. Long-term stability of different dyes

Fig. 14 shows the long-term stability of DSSCs for dye 1 (containing 20 mM CDCA) and N719 under 1 sun. The η value for the cell was calculated every 24 h over a period of 1000 h. It is concluded that after 1000 h of testing under 1 sun, the synthesized dye 1 with co-adsorbent CDCA still maintained 88% of its initial efficiency, as compared to 69% for the cell with N719. This result implies that the new organic dye is relatively stable under 1 sun.

4. Conclusions
In this work, we designed and synthesized five new D–π–A-structured organic dyes containing thioalkyl bithiophene (SBT) moieties for application in DSSCs. All these dyes consist of identical spacer units with different alkyl chains. A simple linear chain with optimized dithioalkyl bithiophene units (dye 1) added to 20 mM CDCA yields a satisfactory η of 9.46%, VOC of 751.8 mV, JSC of 17.17 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.73. Under illumination from a T5 light source at 2400 lux, the same dye 1 added to 20 mM CDCA achieves an impressive η of 12.34%, VOC of 558.58 mV, JSC of 256.5 μA cm−2, and FF of 0.66. This implies that oligothiophene-based dyes are very promising for DSSC applications. Moreover, the long-term stability data for the solar cell made with dye 1 containing 20 mM CDCA are more optimal than those for the cell made with N719 dye. After 1000 h of testing under 1 sun, the results show that the cell made with dye 1 and CDCA still maintained 88% of its initial efficiency, compared to 69% for the cell made with N719. The long-term stability data indicate that the new organic dye is relatively stable under 1 sun. Overall, this work highlights the high performance of an organic dye synthesized using a simple design.
