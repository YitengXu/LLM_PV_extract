    , Accepted 31st March 2023First published on 17th April 2023AbstractHerein we report the solution-combustion-method-synthesized Tb3+- and Tb3+/Yb3+-doped Gd3Ga5O12 nanophosphors, which possess luminescent and magnetic properties. The phase formation/crystal structure, and morphology of the prepared nanophosphors are studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD)/Raman spectroscopy and a field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM), respectively. Tb3+/Yb3+-doped phosphor samples exhibit green emission with an intense band around 544 nm through downshifting (DS) and upconversion (UC) processes because of the 5D4 → 7F5 transition of Tb3+. In addition to this visible emission, these samples also show a NIR emission band around 1024 nm via the quantum cutting (QC) process due to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+. Emission decay measurements of the 5D4 → 7F5 transition of Tb3+ are performed to obtain the rate of energy transfer from Tb3+ to nearby Yb3+. Furthermore, using this energy transfer, the quantum cutting efficiencies were estimated. For their practical application, a selected sample was used to fabricate a LED device by combining the sample with a UV-C LED (274 nm). The obtained results, such as the activation energy (∼0.20 eV) and the high CRI value (78), suggest that the prepared sample can be utilized as a green-light-emitting agent in phosphor-coated (pc) WLEDs.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, lanthanide doped nanocrystals that possess both optical and magnetic properties have fascinated researchers because of their diverse applications, for example, in the field of lighting devices, optical nanothermometry, luminescence based bio-imaging, as drug carriers in the human body, in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), etc.1–6 Lanthanide doped nanocrystals that have gadolinium gallium garnet (Gd3Ga5O12; GGG) as host material are a suitable candidate due to their high thermal stability, low phonon frequency (∼613 cm−1), high refractive index (n ≈ 2) and magnetic nature.7,8 In general, garnet has the chemical formula A3B2C3O12, where A = Y or Gd and occupies dodecahedral sites, B = Al or Ga and occupies octahedral sites, and C = Ga or Al and occupies tetrahedral sites, which are systematically arranged in the cubic space group Iad.9 Upon doping with the lanthanide ions (e.g., Dy3+, Er3+, Tm3+, Eu3+, Ce3+, or Tb3+), it is assumed that these ions replace Gd3+/Y3+ ions because of the similarities in their ionic radii, chemical properties, and valence states, hence making garnet an efficient luminescent material.10–13 Moreover, garnet-based materials doped with a pair of lanthanide ions such as Yb3+/Tm3+, Yb3+/Tb3+, Yb3+/Er3+, and Yb3+/Eu3+ show dual-mode emissions.14–16 This means that the phosphor emits radiation via two channels, viz. the frequency downconversion (DC) process and the frequency upconversion process (UC) through suitable excitation radiation. In the DC process, a high energy photon is either converted into a single photon of lower energy, also known as downshifting (DS), or converted to two (or more) photons of lower energy, known as the quantum cutting (QC) process. By contrast, in the UC process, low-energy photons are converted into high energy photons. These dual-mode emission capabilities of lanthanide doped nanocrystals have led to applications in many novel areas, such as enhancing the efficiency of c-Si solar cells, fluorescence labeling, far-infrared imaging, etc.17–19
For this dual-mode emission capability, the most widely studied lanthanide pairs have been Yb3+/Er3+, Yb3+/Tm3+, and Yb3+/Ho3+ in which the Yb3+ ions act as a sensitizer and the co-dopant works as an activator. For example, Tadge et al.,20 Shandilya et al.,21 and Monika et al.22 have recently examined the green-light emission from the CaSc2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+, SrMoO4:Yb3+/Er3+, and ZnGa2O4:Yb3+/Ho3+/Bi3+ phosphors, respectively, and they found fruitful results for applications in lighting and contactless optical thermometry. Along with these studies, Tadge and his group have explored the possibility of Y2O3:Yb3+/Ho3+ and Y2O3:Yb3+/Ho3+/Tm3+ phosphors to enhance the photovoltaic performance of these phosphors, and they observed an almost 10.33% enhancement in the power conversion efficiency.23 However, very few studies have been explored using the Yb3+/Tb3+ and Yb3+/Eu3+ lanthanide pairs.16,24 There are many ways in which Yb3+ doped with Er3+, Ho3+, or Tm3+ can be excited, e.g., such as via energy transfer upconversion (ETU), ground state absorption (GSA), excited state absorption (ESA), and co-operative energy transfer (CET), but energy transfer from Yb3+ to Tb3+/Eu3+ is possible only via co-operative energy transfer (CET).25 However, Tb3+ and Eu3+ are excellent green- and red-light-emitting lanthanide ions. There have been some reports in which dual-mode emission in Eu3+ is examined.16,26,27 The lanthanide pair Yb3+/Tb3+ has generally been studied in glass samples,28,29 although very few studies have been carried out using polycrystalline-based materials30,31 that show an efficient green colored emission. To achieve an efficient green-emitting powder phosphor with the simultaneous existence of magnetic properties, the exploration of such materials is needed. Thus researchers have studied the NaGdF4:Yb3+/Tb3+, LuPO4:Tb3+, and Y3Ga5O12:Yb3+/Tb3+ phosphors.24,32–34 There is, however, a constraint in using fluoride based materials due to their toxicity; in addition, lutetium oxide is very costly and is not industry friendly, and yttrium gallium garnet (YGG) is non-magnetic in nature (showing negligible magnetic properties at room temperature). In view of these problems, this study explores to development of dual-mode green-light-emitting Gd3Ga5O12:Yb3+/Tb3+ nanophosphors for multifunctional applications. Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) is recognized as a suitable host for dual-mode emission. Singh et al. and Naccache et al. have used GGG as a host for the dual-mode emission in Eu3+ and Pr3+, respectively.16,35 Vetrone et al. have achieved green emission from Er3+ ions, and Sun et al. have succeeded in achieving color-tunable blue-green emission from Tm3+–Ho3+ in the GGG matrix.36,37 In addition to these studies, optical thermometry in a high temperature range (300–973 K) has also been carried out using the luminescence intensity ratio (LIR) technique.1
The studies on Tb3+- and Yb3+/Tb3+-doped materials have shown that Tb3+ doped materials can be used in green tunable lasers and green LEDs using the 5D4 → 5F6 transition of Tb3+ ions.38,39 Drabik and Marciniak have used LIR of Tb3+ ions for contactless optical thermometry.40 Recently, researchers have tried to increase the green emission of Tb3+ through the UC process using several sensitizers and hosts. The use for sensitizers is mandatory because Tb3+ does not have a sufficient absorption of NIR light for the UC process. Among the various sensitizers, Yb3+ has a simple scheme to transfer energy to Tb3+ ions.41–43 Conversely, energy transfer from Tb3+ to Yb3+ is also possible via the quantum cutting (QC) process in which energy from the Tb3+ ion is transferred to a pair of Yb3+ ions simultaneously. Huang et al. have discussed the QC phenomenon in different hosts and found that it is host-dependent.44 The QC phenomenon in Tb3+–Yb3+ has been discussed in various hosts,28,45,46 but, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the QC phenomenon in Tb3+–Yb3+-doped Gd3Ga5O12. The advantage of using this host is that it is magnetic in nature because of the presence of Gd3+ ions, which are paramagnetic, so it can be used as a contrast agent for MRI.47 Hence, it can be considered a bi-functional material that has luminescent as well as magnetic properties simultaneously.
In this work, we used the low-temperature solution-combustion method to prepare Tb3+/Yb3+-doped gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) nanophosphors. Initially, the concentration of Tb3+ in GGG was varied; then, the amount of Tb3+ was fixed and the amount of Yb3+ was varied. The multimodal DS, QC, and UC emission characteristics of the samples were inspected by measuring the photoluminescence and upconversion emission. A binding energy analysis of the elements that exist in the samples was carried out to determine the chemical states. We also carried out magnetic measurements on undoped and doped samples. The thermal stability of the prepared nanophosphors was tested using temperature-dependent UC emission spectra. A selected sample was then used for LED fabrication.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials used
For the synthesis of nanophosphors based on gadolinium gallium garnet, gadolinium nitrate (Gd(NO3)3·6H2O; 99.0% CDH, India), gallium nitrate (Ga(NO3)3·xH2O; 99.9%, Sigma Aldrich, USA), terbium oxide (Tb4O7; 99.9%, Alfa Asear, USA), ytterbium oxide (Yb2O3; 99.9%, Sigma Aldrich, USA), nitric acid (75.0%, Finar, India), and urea (98.0%, Alfa Asear, USA) were used. In addition to these chemicals, deionized (DI) water was used throughout the synthesis. The proportion of the precursors was taken on the basis of the compositional formula Gd(3−x−y)Ga5O12:xTb3+yYb3+ (x = 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5%, and y = 0.0, 5.0, 8.0, 11.0 and 14.0%).
2.2. Synthesis technique
The low-temperature solution-combustion synthesis technique was used for preparation of the samples.48 This is an exothermic reaction in which metal nitrate behaves as an oxidizing agent, and urea (organic fuel) behaves as a reducing agent. The stock solutions of ytterbium and terbium nitrate were prepared by dissolving their oxide forms in nitric acid and DI water. Then, all the nitrates were collected in a 100 mL beaker and the required amount of urea was added. After that, this mixture was maintained, with magnetic stirring, at a temperature of 90 °C for approximately 2 h to form a transparent gel. Furthermore, this gel was placed inside a preheated muffle furnace at a temperature of 400–450 °C for the combustion process. During the combustion process, brown odorous fumes were produced, and after a few minutes a voluminous and foamy powder was produced. Then, the obtained powder was ground using a pestle and mortar to a fine powder, which was transferred to an alumina crucible for post-heat treatment. The alumina crucible was placed inside the furnace for annealing at a temperature of 900 °C for 4 h.
2.3. Instrumentation
Validation of the phase and purity of the prepared nanophosphor compositions was checked using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The XRD patterns were measured in the 10° ≤ 2θ ≤ 70° range using CuKα radiation (λ = 1.54 Å) from an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Smartlab). The surface morphology and elemental compositions of the samples were investigated using field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) using an FE-SEM microscope (Zeiss, Supra 55). The vibrational bands were inspected using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The FTIR data were recorded in the range of 4000–400 cm−1 using an FTIR spectrophotometer (Agilent, Carry 660). To study the Raman-active vibrational bands, a Raman spectrophotometer (Horiba, LabRam HE evolution) with a green laser (λ = 532 nm) was used. The surface chemical states and compositions were inspected using the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique with a synchrotron radiation source of 4.064 keV energy at the Indus-2 facility of RRCAT Indore, India. The magnetic nature of the samples was inspected using a magnetization vs. magnetic field (M–H) plot recorded at room temperature using a superconducting quantum interface device (SQUID) magnetometer (Quantum Design, MPMS XL-7).
Optical studies of the samples were carried out by recording the photoluminescence, decay kinetics, and upconversion emission spectra. The decay time and photoluminescence spectra in the visible region were recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Agilent, Carry Eclipse). NIR region luminescence spectra were recorded using a Fluorolog-3 spectrophotometer (Horiba, USA) equipped with liquid-nitrogen-cooled InGaAs detector. A charge-coupled device (CCD)-based spectrometer (Avantes, USA, ULS2048X64 spectrometer) was used to record the UC emission spectra and the emission of the fabricated green LED.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Structural analysis
The XRD patterns of the prepared undoped and doped nanophosphors are shown in Fig. 1. The observed XRD patterns do not change significantly upon doping with the lanthanide ions, which confirms that the doped lanthanides successfully replace the Gd3+ ions. The XRD peaks are well matched with the cubic Gd3Ga5O12 (GGG) phase. However, there is a very small peak at around 30.30°, which can be assigned to the Gd3GaO6 phase. This may be due to Ga3+ ion deficiencies or the low synthesis temperature. Moreover, we successfully prepared a sample of the pure undoped GGG through the solid-state reaction method using a synthesis temperature of 1300 °C for 6 h. However, to obtain phosphors of nano-sized order, all of the samples were prepared using the solution-combustion method. The XRD patterns of the as-synthesized sample (without post-heat treatment of the undoped sample) are given in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The XRD pattern of the as-synthesized sample shows an amorphous nature with low-intensity XRD peaks in the 30–35° range. The XRD patterns of all the post-heated samples (annealing at 900 °C for 4 h) match well with the cubic phase of Gd3Ga5O12 (of the space group Ia3d) with lattice parameters a = b = c = 12.7 Å and α = β = γ = 90°, and a unit cell volume of 1895.57 Å3, corresponding to the ICSD Data No. 00-013-049. The recorded patterns are shown in Fig. 1.

Furthermore, Rietveld refinement of the XRD pattern of undoped GGG sample prepared through the solution-combustion and solid-state reaction methods was performed using the Fullprof software to elucidate the phase formation. The goodness of structural refinement was measured using two main parameters, the R-weighted pattern (Rwp) and chi-squared (χ2) parameter. It has been reported that for good XRD pattern refinement, Rwp and χ2 should be less than 10 and 5, respectively.11,49Fig. 1(c and d) depict the XRD refinement patterns of the sample prepared using these methods, from which it is clear that both the refinement reliability factors (Rwp and χ2) show good agreement with the good structural refinement.
3.2. Morphological and elemental analysis
The FE-SEM and EDS images of the Gd3Ga5O12, Gd3Ga5O12:1.0%Tb3+, and Gd3Ga5O12:5.0%Yb3+1.0%Tb3+ samples were recorded and the images are shown in Fig. 2. From these images it is clear that the synthesized samples have a non-uniform and irregular morphology. It seems that a few particles joint with each other to make an oval shape. The morphology of the nanophosphors does not change significantly upon doping with Tb3+ and Yb3+/Tb3+. The EDS images were recorded to determine the elemental compositions and their distribution in the samples. The EDS measurements confirm the presence of Gd, Ga, O, Tb, and Yb in the samples. The weight percentage of the elemental constituents obtained via EDS is close to the stoichiometric ratio of the elements that were used during the synthesis process. This supports our assumption of the successful preparation of the desired nanophosphors.

3.3. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and Raman spectroscopy analysis
FTIR studies were carried out to probe the vibrational bands of the host and the impurity. For this, the FTIR spectra of the as-synthesized and annealed sample were recorded, which are shown in Fig. 3(a). The FTIR spectra show vibrational bands corresponding to the stretching (νOH) and bending (δOH) vibrations of the hydroxyl group around (–OH) around 3450 cm−1, and 1635 cm−1, respectively. The stretching band of the NO group appears around 1390 cm−1 due to the use of HNO3 during the synthesis process.50,51 These luminescence quenching bands were almost removed after annealing of the samples, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The sharp bands centered around 683 cm−1, 616 cm−1, and 576 cm−1 are the characteristic stretching vibrations of Ga–O and Gd–O, respectively.11

The Raman spectra of the prepared garnet samples, recorded in the range of 50–1600 cm−1 at ambient temperature, were also studied. Fig. 3(b) shows the Raman spectra of the undoped and doped samples. From the Raman spectra, it is clear that there is no considerable shift in the peaks upon doping with Tb3+ or Yb3+/Tb3+ ions. This may be due to the very small doping amount. Group theory studies on the garnet structure-based compounds suggest that they have 160 atoms inside the unit cell and their Raman spectrum contains 25 first-order Raman-active bands (i.e., T2g (14), Eg (8), and A1g (3)) in the frequency range of 50–900 cm−1.52,53 Here, we observed all of the first-order Raman active bands, along with some second-order Raman-active bands (around 1099.0, 1516.8, 1542.5 cm−1), which are found to be very close to the theoretical results.53
3.4. Binding energy and magnetic measurement analysis
To determine the chemical states and surface chemical compositions, binding energy analysis was carried out by collecting the XPS spectra at room temperature. The XPS survey spectrum and high-resolution elemental scans of the Gd3Ga5O12:5.0%Yb3+1.0%Tb3+ sample were recorded. Fig. 4(a) shows the XPS survey scan in the range of 0–1600 eV, which confirms the presence of all the expected Gd3d, Ga2p, O1s, Yb3d, and Tb4d elemental states. The required charge correction for the XPS spectra was carried out using C1s as the reference at 285 eV. The elemental scan XPS spectra of the Gd3d, Ga2p, O1s, Yb3d, C1s, and Tb4d states are displayed in Fig. S2(a–f) (ESI†). Fig. S2(a) (ESI†) shows an elemental scan for the Gd3d states, which depicts two prominent peaks around 1185.5 eV and 1217.8 eV corresponding to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 levels of Gd3d, respectively.54 The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Ga2p state shows two peaks around 1116.4 eV and 1143.1 eV due to the 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 levels of Ga2p,55 as given in Fig. S2(b) (ESI†). The high-resolution XPS spectra of the O1s and Yb3d states show a band around 529.8 eV due to metal oxides, and a band at 1527.0 eV because of the 3d3/2 levels of Yb3+, respectively,56 as shown in Fig. S2(c) and (d) (ESI†). For the Tb3d states, the high-resolution spectra were recorded in the range of 1232–1250 eV, where a weak band around 1238.4 eV was detected due to Tb3+ states.57 In the case of the Tb3d state, a weak signal was observed because of the detection limits of the XPS instruments since the concentration of Tb3+ used was very low (1.0%).

(b) Magnetization vs. applied magnetic field (M–H) plot of the undoped Gd3Ga5O12 sample and the Gd3Ga5O12:5.0%Yb3+1.0%Tb3+ sample. 
The magnetic nature of the samples was also tested as the host compound contains Gd3+ and Tb3+ ions, which have unpaired electrons (responsible for magnetic properties).58 The M–H plot was recorded in the magnetic field range of −60 to 60 kOe, as depicted in Fig. 4(b). The paramagnetic nature was confirmed from the graphs. The magnetization value of the doped sample was found to be slightly higher than that of the undoped sample; this may be due to the existence of Tb3+ in the doped sample, which has higher magnetic moment (approximately 9.7 A m−2) than Gd3+ (approximately 7.9 A m−2).58 Similar results have been observed in Eu3+/Tb3+-doped BaGdF5, and Yb3+/Tm3+-doped GdF3 phosphors.58,59
3.5. Luminescence studies

3.5.1. Upconversion (UC) emission. 
UC emission studies of the Yb3+/Tb3+-doped GGG nanophosphors were carried out using 980 nm radiation from a diode laser. For UC emission, the presence of Yb3+ in the GGG:Tb3+ nanophosphor is essential as there is no energy level in Tb3+ around the 980 nm excitation wavelength. The 5D4 level of the Tb3+ ions lies well above the excitation energy of ∼10246 cm−1. Hence, upon infrared excitation at 980 nm (∼10246 cm−1), the possibility of green-colored emission through the UC process is not favoured. However, the presence of Yb3+ with Tb3+ produces strong green-colored emission through cooperative energy transfer.28 In the first step, the concentration of Tb3+ in Gd3Ga5O12 was optimized for the most intense green emission. Furthermore, the concentration of Yb3+ was varied to maximize the green UC emission. Fig. 5(a) compares the emission spectra at different concentrations of Yb3+ ions. The UC emission spectra show the characteristic emission bands of Tb3+, consisting of UV, blue, green, and red emission bands that correspond to the 5D3 → 7F6 (389 nm), 5D3 → 7F5 (417 nm), 5D3 → 7F4 (436 nm), 5D4 → 7F6 (488 nm), 5D4 → 7F5 (543 nm), 5D4 → 7F4 (588 nm), 5D4 → 7F3 (622 nm), 5D4 → 7F2 (660 nm), and 5D4 → 7F1 (745 nm) transitions of the Tb3+ ions.60 Among these transitions, the green emission band of the 5D4 → 7F5 transition appears to be the most intense, and thus the overall emission appears as green. The CIE points of UC emission spectra in the laser power range of 0.32–1.10 W are shown in Fig. 7(a), and from this plot it is clear that upon increasing the laser power the emission shifts towards a more green-coloured region.
 Fig. 5  (a) Upconversion (UC) emission spectra of Gd3Ga5O12:yYb3+1.0%Tb3+ (where y = 5.0, 8.0, 11.0 and 14.0%) upon excitation with a 980 nm laser source. (b) Plot of ln(I) versus ln(P) for the two most intense emission bands (543 nm and 586 nm) of the UC emission of the Gd3Ga5O12:11.0%Yb3+1.0%Tb3+ sample. 
We then recorded the laser-power-dependant UC emission spectra for the optimized Gd3Ga5O12:11.0%Yb3+1.0%Tb3+ sample, and the graph is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). Upon increasing the laser power (P), the intensity of the UC emission (IUC) increased, following the relation,24 IUC = aPn(1)where a is the proportionality constant, and n is the number of photons needed for the specific UC emission band. However, this relation holds only for low laser powers. Fig. 5(b) shows a plot of ln(IUC) vs. ln(P) for the two strongest emission bands. Linear fitting of these plots gives the respective values of the slope ‘n’ (the number of photons). Here, we found slope values of 1.12 and 1.09 for the 543 nm and 586 nm green emissions, respectively. The slope values were found to be slightly lower than the expected value of 2.0, according to the energy level structure of these emissions for the two-photon absorption process.60,61 These low slope values could be due to the involvement of non-radiative transitions and energy transfer processes that populate these emitting levels.
The mechanism involved in obtaining different upconversion emission bands from Gd3Ga5O12:Yb3+/Tb3+ can be understood through various energy transfer processes, such as the (a) co-operative energy transfer (CET), (b) cross-relaxation (CR), and (c) photon-assisted energy transfer (PAET) processes.
(a) Co-operative energy transfer (CET): this type of energy transfer process takes place when there is a large energy gap between the ground state of the dopant and the first excited state of the acceptor ion, similar to that most usually studied in the case of the Yb3+/Eu3+- and Yb3+/Tb3+-pair doped systems.62 In our system, the pair of Yb3+ ions absorb energy from the excitation source and then simultaneously transfer their energy to a single Tb3+ ion to bring about the transition to its higher energy levels as depicted in Fig. 6(a).
 Fig. 6  Simplified partial energy level diagrams for illustration of various types of energy transfer process between Yb3+ → Tb3+, Tb3+ → Tb3+, and Tb3+ → Yb3+, via (a) co-operative energy transfer, (b) cross-relaxation, and (c) phonon-assisted energy transfer. 
(b) Cross-relaxation (CR): through the CET process it is not possible to excite the 5D3 level to obtain UV and blue UC emission bands. The population of this level can be achieved when Tb3+ ions are excited to the 5D4 level. The 5D4 level absorbs energy from the excitation source through the excited state absorption (ESA) and the Tb3+ ion is excited to the 5D2 level. The population in the 5D2 level then relaxes non-radiatively to the 5D3 level, and 5D3 → 7FJ transitions give the UV/blue emission. Some ions present in the 5D3 level could populate the 5D4 level through the CR process. In our case, the green emission band is the strongest because of the CR process between neighboring Tb3+ ions. Kore et al. observed this CR process by varying the concentration of Tb3+, and they observed the dominant emission to be due to the transition from 5D3 to 7FJ at low Tb3+ concentrations and from 5D4 to 7FJ in the presence of higher Tb3+ ion concentrations.60 During these interactions, the Tb3+ ions exchange their energy through the process of Tb3+(5D3) + Tb3+(7F6) → Tb3+(5D4) + Tb3+(7F0), as shown in Fig. 6(b). This exchange of energy is possible due to the energy match between levels of 5D3 and 5D4 with those of 7F0 and 7F6, which facilitates the CR process.
(c) Phonon-assisted energy transfer (PAET): this type of energy transfer process is responsible for quenching of the green emission of Tb3+ upon increasing the amount of Yb3+ to a certain level. The PAET process occurs when the energy mismatch between Tb3+ and the neighboring Yb3+ ions is compensated through the absorption or emission of phonons generated during multiphonon relaxation, as shown in Fig. 6(c). In this process, when the transition of Tb3+ from the 5D4 level occurs to some intermediate level, the observed energy is then utilized to excite Yb3+ from 2F7/2 to the 2F5/2 level, where the energy mismatch is emitted in terms of phonons.28,63 However, the transfer of energy from Tb3+ to Yb3+ is also possible via CET to exhibit QC emission in the NIR range. These different routes of energy transfer from Tb3+ to Yb3+ depend on the phonon energy of the host matrix. It has been proposed that the probability of PAET is higher than that of CET in the host which has a higher phonon energy (e.g., GdPO4), and the probability is in the reverse order for a host which has a lower phonon energy (e.g., LaF3).62 The excitation and emission processes occurring in present sample are shown in Fig. 7(b).

3.5.2. Downshifting emission. 
The photoluminescence excitation (PLE) and photoluminescence emission (PL) spectra of the Gd(3−x)Ga5O12:xTb3+ (x = 0.5, 1.0, 1.5%) samples were recorded for the downshifting emission studies. The excitation and emission spectra were recorded by monitoring the wavelength of 544 nm and 264 nm, respectively, as shown in Fig. 8. The excitation spectra of the samples show an intense broad band around 264 nm due to the spin-allowed transition of Tb3+ from 4f75d ← 4f8, and weak bands around 377 nm, 420 nm, and 487 nm due to the 5D3 ← 7F5, 5D3 ← 7F4, and 5D4 ← 7F6 transitions of the Tb3+ ions, respectively.64 Here, we observed that the f–d transition (264 nm) is more intense than the f–f transitions (from 377–487 nm), which is clear because the former band is due to an allowed transition and the latter are spin-forbidden transitions. The emission spectra of the Tb3+-doped samples are almost identical to the UC emission spectra (shown in Fig. 6), except for a change in the emission intensity. On exciting the samples at the most intense excitation band of 264 nm, the samples give emission bands around 490 nm, 544 nm, 588 nm, 622 nm, 667 nm, and 730 nm which correspond to the 5D4 → 7F6, 5D4 → 7F5, 5D4 → 7F3, 5D4 → 7F3, 5D4 → 7F2, and 5D4 → 7F1 transitions of the Tb3+ ions, respectively.60 and Mishra et al. and Kore et al. observed similar patterns in the emission spectrum of the Tb3+-doped sample using the excitation wavelength of 379 nm.24,60 Among these transitions, the transition 5D4 → 7F5 is more intense and thus the resultant emission appears as green under the downshifting process also. The strength of the emission band increases with an increase in the amount of Tb3+ up to 1.0%, and after that intensity of the emission band decreases due to the concentration quenching phenomenon. Thus, 1.0% Tb3+ is the optimum dopant amount in the Gd3Ga5O12 host matrix, and the same is also found in the Y2O3 host.65,66 The phenomenon of concentration quenching takes place because upon increasing the concentration of dopants the distance between the neighboring dopants decreases. After a certain concentration value, known as the critical concentration (C), and the corresponding distance between the dopants, known as the critical distance (RC), the probability of non-radiative transitions among the dopants to starts increase, which causes quenching of the luminescence. Estimation of critical distance (Rc) is done using Blasse formula given below,67 (2)where V is the volume of the unit cell, N is the number of ions per unit cell and C is the critical concentration. Here V = 2048.3 Å3, N = 8, and C = 0.01, and so the value of RC in this case works out to be >5 Å using eqn (2). Thus, multipole–multipole interactions are responsible for the concentration quenching of Tb3+ in the Gd3Ga5O12 host matrix. Multipole–multipole interactions can be of different types, such as dipole–dipole, quadrupole–quadrupole, and dipole–quadruple interactions, and to determine the particular type of interaction that is exists in the system one can use Dexter theory.67

The various emission bands observed in the downshifting emission studies can be explained using an energy level diagram as drawn in Fig. 7(b). Under excitation at 264 nm, the Tb3+ ions absorb this energy and are promoted to the upper excited levels (5D1, 5D2), from which they relax non-radiatively to level 5D3. From this level (5D3) very few ions relax to the ground level 7F5,4 radiatively, which are responsible for the weak UV and blue emission bands, and the remaining ions relax non-radiatively to the lower excited level (5D4), from which they relax to the ground levels 7F6,5,4,3via radiative transitions and contribute to the green and red emission bands.


3.5.3. Quantum cutting (QC) emission. 
Quantum cutting (QC) emission is an optical phenomenon in which a high-energy photon is converted into two or more photons of lower energy. It was first observed in 1970 in YF3:Pr3+, and since then it has been studied extensively in-fluoride based phosphors. The low phonon energy and the large band gap of fluoride-based materials make them suitable for this purpose. However, the high toxicity and low chemical stability of fluoride-based materials create obstacles to their applicability. Because of this, we studied the QC phenomenon in the Gd3Ga5O12 host.
To observe the QC emission process experimentally, we recorded the emission spectra of Gd(2.99−y)Ga5O12:1.0%Tb3+yYb3+ (y = 5.0, 8.0, 11.0 and 14.0%) samples in the visible and NIR regions, as shown in Fig. 9. The emission spectra were recorded using the excitation wavelength 264 nm, and different detectors were used for recording the emission in the visible and NIR regions. Under this excitation, charge transfer occurs between the Tb3+ and Yb3+ ions (Yb3+ + Tb3+ ↔ Yb2+ + Tb4+) with the formation of a charge transfer state which is responsible for the NIR emission bands.68,69 Upon increasing the amount of Yb3+, the strength of the emission bands of the Tb3+ ion decreases whilst maintaining its pattern. The weakening of the emission band may be due to energy transfer from the 5D4 level of Tb3+ to the pair of Yb3+ ions through CET.24,68 Because of this energy transfer process, there is an increment in the NIR emission band around 1024 nm upon increasing the amount of Yb3+ up to 11.0%, a decrease after that. This NIR emission band arises due to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+, which is not related to the emission band of Tb3+. This is because there are no such energy levels of Tb3+ for the transition corresponding to this NIR emission band, and because the separation from the lowest excited level to the uppermost ground level is around 14000 cm−1 (∼714 nm). Thus, upon increasing the amount of Yb3+, the emission intensity of the Tb3+ bands (in the visible region) decreases, and the emission intensity of the Yb3+ band (in the NIR region) increases. This trend supports the energy transfer via the QC process. Bahadur et al. and Grzyb et al. studied the QC phenomenon in Yb3+/Tb3+-doped borate glass and GdBO3 materials, respectively, and confirmed the energy transfer from the Tb3+ ion to the pair of Yb3+ ions.45,68 Here, the 325 nm excitation-power-dependent emission intensity of the 543 nm and 976 nm bands, which correspond to the transitions of Tb3+ and Yb3+, respectively, was monitored. Fig. 9(c) shows the variation of emission intensity as a function of the 325 nm laser excitation power. The change in intensity of these emission bands follows eqn (1), and the observed slope values are 0.84 ± 0.05 ≈ 1.0 for the visible (543 nm) band, and 0.5 ± 0.02 ≈ 0.5 for the NIR (976 nm) band, as displayed in Fig. 9(d). From this investigation, it can be said that the DS emission is a linear process and the QC emission is a nonlinear process. The obtained slope value (∼0.5) for the NIR emission band clearly indicates the conversion of one high-energy photon into two photons of lower energy. Similar results have been observed by Stręk et al., and Yadav et al., for the QC process.70,71

(c) Power-dependent emission spectra of the Gd3Ga5O12:11.0%Yb3+1.0%Tb3+ sample under 325 nm laser excitation, and (d) ln(I) versus ln(P) plot of the 543 nm and 976 nm (inset) emission bands corresponding to the transitions of Tb3+ and Yb3+, respectively. The spectra shown in panels (a–c) are similar but are recorded using two different systems. A shift in the intensity variation of the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition is observed. 
A detailed mechanism for the observed QC emission is as follows: when the sample is exposed to 264 nm excitation, the Tb3+ ions absorb this energy and reach upper excited levels and then relax to the 5D3, 5D4 levels non-radiatively. From there, some of the Tb3+ ions move to the lower ground states 7FJ (J=6,5,4,3,2) and resulting in UV, visible emission bands. At the same time, one Tb3+ ion present in the 5D4 level transfers its energy to two Yb3+ ions {Tb3+(5D4) → 2Yb3+(2F5/2)} and then the Yb3+ ions emit two photons at 1024 nm. Consistent with previous reports45,68 on the Yb3+/Tb3+ system, the emission from Yb3+ ions can only be supported through the quantum cutting process, where the same occurs in this case also.


3.5.4. Decay kinetics and quantum cutting efficiency. 
Decay kinetics measurements were carried out to support the observed energy transfer from Tb3+ to Yb3+. The decay time of the 544 nm emission in the Gd2.99Ga5O12:1.0%Tb3+ and Gd(2.99−y)Ga5O12:1.0%Tb3+yYb3+ (y = 5.0, 8.0, 11.0 and 14.0%) samples were recorded for the 264 nm excitation wavelength. The observed decay spectra are fitted well with the single exponential function,72 as shown in Fig. 10. The decay time for the Tb3+/Yb3+-doped samples is found to be less than that of the Tb3+-doped sample (4.54 ms, decay curve shown in Fig. 10(a)), which decreased gradually upon increasing the amount of Yb3+. This supports the decrease in the emission intensity as observed in Fig. 9(a) as well as the energy transfer from Tb3+ to Yb3+ ions. The obtained decay times of the different samples are compared in Table 1.

This decay time measurement is used to find the energy transfer efficiency (ηETE) from Tb3+ to Yb3+ ions, which can be estimated using the equation:24,45 (3)where τTb3+−Yb3+ and τTb3+ are the decay times for the Tb3+/Yb3+- and Tb3+-doped samples, respectively. Using these energy transfer efficiency values, the value of the internal quantum efficiency (ηQE) for the different amounts of Yb3+ can be determined using the following relation: ηQE = ηTb(1 − ηET) + 2ηET.(4)In the above relation, the first term denotes the visible photons (emitted by Tb3+ ions), and the second term is related to the NIR photons (emitted by the Yb3+ ions), where ηTb denotes the quantum efficiency of Tb3+. For the highest possible QE value, the value of ηTb can be considered to be equal to 1 by ignoring non-radiative transitions. All the calculated values of the above-mentioned parameters are listed in Table 1. In addition, Fig. 10(f) shows the variation in the decay time of Tb3+ and the quantum cutting efficiency (ηQE) with the concentration of Yb3+.
Thus, in the prepared samples the maximum obtained value of the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is 144% in the Gd2.85Tb0.01Yb0.14Ga5O12 sample, which means that upon the absorption of 100 photons of 264 nm radiation, the sample will emit 88 photons of NIR-region wavelengths (900–1100 nm) and 56 photons of visible-region energy (emission of Tb3+). Here, the value of obtained the IQE in Gd2.94Tb0.01Yb0.05Ga5O12 is 130%, which is higher than the 115% obtained by Mishra et al. for Y2.94Tb0.01Yb0.05Ga5O12.24 Hence, the prepared garnet-based nanophosphors can find application as efficiency-increasing materials in c-Si solar cells.

3.6. Thermal stability
It is essential to check the thermal stability of the prepared nanophosphor for its practical applications. For this, the emission spectra of the Gd2.94Ga5O12:5.0%Yb3+1.0%Tb3+ nanophosphor as a function of temperature in the range of 28–280 °C were recorded. Upon increasing the temperature the emission intensity decreases gradually without losing emission spectrum pattern, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Fig. 11(a) depicts the change in the relative integrated intensity of the 544 nm emission band with the temperature, and from this plot it is clear that at 150 °C the emission retains 80.36% of the maximum value at room temperature (28 °C). Thus, the prepared nanophosphors show good thermal stability. Furthermore, the thermal stability parameter activation energy (Ea) was calculated using the Arrhenius equation as given below,73 (5)where Io and IT are the values of the emission intensity at room and any temperature (T), respectively, lnA is a constant, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature and Ea is the activation energy that needs to be found. The activation energy was found equal to 0.20 eV (Fig. 11(b)). The obtained activation energy suggests that the sample is suitable for practical applications. Furthermore, to understand the thermal quenching effect, the configuration coordinate diagram of the ground state and the excited state can be used, as shown in Fig. 11(c). Initially, under excitation of the sample, the electron from the ground state (7F6, point a) absorbs energy and is promoted to the excited state (5D4, point b) and then relaxes to a lower level (point c) of the vibrational state via a non-radiative channel. After that, the electron returns to the ground state (point a) by emitting photons of visible light. However, there is a possibility that electrons of the ground state may gain energy from thermal vibrations to reach point d, from which they return to the ground state non-radiatively. If the thermal energy keeps increasing, the probability of electrons reaching the cross-over point increases, and hence the non-radiative transition increases further which results in a decrease in the emission intensity.

4. Applications
4.1. LED fabrication
The developed material was found to be applicable as a green-color-emitting material in phosphor-coated (pc) WLEDs. The feasibility of the material was verified by fabricating an LED device. For fabrication of the LED device, the chosen material (Gd3Ga5O12:1.0%Tb3+) was coated over a UV-C LED (AlGaN) which has a peak wavelength of around 274 nm. The LED emission spectra were recorded at different values of the applied forward-biased current, as shown in Fig. 12(a). With an increase in the current value, the strength of the emission intensity was found to increase linearly, as shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), which validates the stability of the fabricated LED device with the current. Thus, the observed activation energy (∼0.20 eV), stability with the current, and the CRI value (∼78 at 50 mA current value) suggest that these materials could be used as green-color-emitting materials in pc-coated WLEDs.

4.2. In c-Si solar cells
The obtained results show that the Gd3Ga5O12:Yb3+/Tb3+ phosphor is capable of emitting visible and NIR emissions upon exposure to n-UV excitation as well as visible emission under NIR excitation. Fig. 12(b) shows a comparison of the excitation and emission spectra of the prepared nanophosphor with that of a general solar spectrum. From this figure it is clear that the excitation spectrum of the nanophosphor lies in n-UV and visible region where the absorption for a c-Si solar cell is poor, while the NIR emitting range of the nanophosphor is well matched with the maximum absorption of c-Si solar cells. Thus, the combination of such a nanophosphor with the c-Si solar cell will enhance the photovoltaic performance of the c-Si solar cell.74 By contrast, the capability of the synthesized nanophosphor to utilize NIR radiation and convert it to visible radiation will help to enhance the photovoltaic performance of perovskite-based solar cells, mainly where MAPbX3 or FAPbX3 (where X = I, Br, Cl) types of material are used.17 This is because, in most solar cell applications, the NIR radiation of the solar spectrum is unused. Similarly, Kore et al. and Dong et al. have suggested the possible applications of the BaMgF4:Yb3+/Tb3+ and Ba2LaGa11O20:Cr3+/Yb3+/Nd3+ phosphors, respectively, in c-Si solar cells.60,75
5. Conclusions
In summary, Tb3+- and Yb3+/Tb3+-doped Gd3Ga5O12 samples that are capable of downshifting as well as upconversion emission have been successfully prepared via low-temperature combustion. Both X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy studies confirmed the formation of the garnet structure for these samples. The Gd3Ga5O12:Yb3+/Tb3+ sample shows an intense dual-mode green emission from the 5D4 → 7F5 transition of the Tb3+ ions. Along with this visible emission, the NIR emission band around 1024 nm was found due to the 2F5/2 → 2F7/2 transition of Yb3+ through the quantum cutting (Tb3+ → Yb3+) mechanism. With excellent luminescent properties, the prepared sample is also showed to be paramagnetic in nature. The applicability of the prepared sample as a green-color-emitting material for pc-WLEDs was confirmed by fabricating a LED device through combining the chosen phosphor (Gd3Ga5O12:1.0%Tb3+) and a UV-C LED (peak wavelength 274 nm). Moreover, utilizing the unused n-UV and NIR regions of the solar spectrum, the prepared sample was found to be suitable for enhancing the photovoltaic performance of the solar cells. These studies suggest that the prepared sample is useful in the field of display devices, c-Si solar cells, and also as a contrast agent for MRI.
