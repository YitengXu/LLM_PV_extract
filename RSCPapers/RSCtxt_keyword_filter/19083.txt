    , Accepted 18th April 2013First published on 19th April 2013AbstractHighly efficient ITO-free polymeric electronic devices were successfully demonstrated by replacement of the ITO electrode with a solution-processed PEDOT:PSS electrode containing Ag nanoparticles (NPs). Polymer solar cells (PSCs) and light emitting diodes (PLEDs) were fabricated based on poly(5,6-bis(octyloxy)-4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (PTBT):PC61BM and Super Yellow as a photoactive layer, respectively. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect and improved electrical conductivity by the Ag NPs clearly contributed to increments in light absorption/emission in the active layer as well as the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS electrode in PSCs and PLEDs. The ITO-free bulk heterojunction PSCs showed a 1% absolute enhancement in the power conversion efficiency (3.27 to 4.31%), and the power efficiency of the PLEDs was improved by 124% (3.75 to 8.4 lm W−1) compared to the reference devices without Ag NPs. The solution-processable conducting polymer, PEDOT:PSS with Ag NPs, can be a promising electrode for large area and flexible optoelectronic devices with a low-cost fabrication process.

Broader context
As a result of efforts to find new renewable energy sources by replacing environmentally harmful fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, solar cell technologies have been intensively studied for last few decades. In particular, a polymer solar cell (PSC) is one of the promising energy sources because of its advantages such as low cost, mechanical flexibility and solution processability for large area devices. However, indium-tin-oxide (ITO) used as an electrode is against cost-effective and flexible device fabrication due to its increasing cost and brittleness. Hence, many efforts to replace ITO with solution-processable flexible electrodes have been tried recently. A highly conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been highlighted with its high conductivity and flexibility. Here, we report that silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) increase conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS electrode and contribute to increments in light absorption/emission in an active layer via surface plasmon resonance in PSCs and polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). Therefore, the conducting polymer electrode with the Ag NPs is a promising approach to overcome the limitations of ITO for PSC and PLEDs.

Introduction
Organic semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices, such as polymer solar cells (PSCs) and polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), have attracted considerable attention due to their advantages such as solution-based low-cost and large-area fabrication using printing techniques.1–4 On the other hand, the performance of these polymer based optoelectronic devices has not reached the level needed for commercialization. Although power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of ∼8% have been demonstrated for PSCs,5–7 there are still many limitations for practical applications. Indium tin oxide (ITO) is used widely as a transparent electrode for optoelectronic devices because of its good electrical conductivity and appropriate transparency.8 However, ITO has many disadvantages, such as intrinsic brittleness, poor transparency in the near IR regions, chemical instability under acidic or basic conditions, increasing cost of indium due to the limited reserves on the earth, and costly preparative methods, such as sputtering, evaporation and pulsed laser deposition, etc.9,10 Therefore, devices with an ITO electrode with the conventional structure of PSCs and PLEDs are unsuitable for cost-effective and flexible device applications. To overcome these problems, many efforts have been made to replace the conducting oxide electrode with a transparent conducting polymer electrode.10–17 A conducting polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), has been widely exploited in PSCs and PLEDs by modulating and improving its intrinsic conformation as well as electrical and optical properties.18–21 For example, Na and Yim et al. reported the feasibility of replacing the ITO electrode with a PEDOT:PSS electrode doped with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).10,17
To improve the performance of PSCs, it is important to maximize the light absorption of the photoactive layer. Simply increasing the thickness of an active layer can allow more sunlight absorption but also increases the series resistance, often resulting in a poor fill factor (FF).22 The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) effect may offer a solution to improve the short circuit current density (JSC) in PSCs by the incorporation of metal nanoparticles (NPs) in organic electronic devices without increasing the active layer thickness.23–29 The SPR effect arises from a localized electromagnetic surface wave at the metal and dielectric interface, which enables the active layer to absorb more photons from irradiated light via field enhancement near metal NPs.23,30–32 Similarly, the SPR effect supports the improved device performance in PLEDs by enhancing light emission by accelerating the radiative decay process.26–29,33
Silver (Ag) and gold (Au) NPs are used widely to induce the SPR effect due to strong light absorption and excellent air stability, etc.34–39 In particular, Ag-based nanostructures, such as Ag nanospheres, nanoholes, gratings, and grids, have been studied extensively as electrodes for optoelectronic devices.12,14,40–42 Despite the desirable SPR effect of these Ag nanomaterials, complicated processes, such as photolithography and nano-imprinting, are required to prepare nano-patterned Ag electrodes, resulting in high-cost fabrication. To overcome this problem, methods for the simple and low-cost synthesis of metal NPs have been introduced to all solution-based fabrication of PSCs and PLEDs.23–25,27
In this paper, we successfully demonstrated the highly efficient ITO-free PSCs and PLEDs by replacement of the ITO electrode with a PEDOT:PSS/Ag NPs composite film. The Ag NPs in PEDOT:PSS contribute simultaneously in enhancing the device performance via the SPR effect and increasing the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS electrode. These enhanced optical and electrical properties resulted in PCE increase by 32% for PSCs and 124% increment of the light-emitting efficiency for PLEDs, compared to the devices without Ag NPs.
Experimental
1 Materials and instruments
Silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.9999%) and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, 99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. and used without further purification. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4-styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, PH500) was acquired from H. C. Starck (Germany). Poly(5,6-bis(octyloxy)-4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (PTBT) (Mn = 30000 g mol−1) was synthesized in our laboratory.43 Regio-regular P3HT (Mn = 55000 g mol−1) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) were purchased from Electronic Materials (EM) Index Co., Ltd. Poly(phenylene vinylene)-based light-emitting copolymer, Super Yellow (SY, Mn = 1950000 g mol−1) was supplied by Merck Co. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-2100 TEM operated at 200 kV. The samples for TEM analysis were prepared by placing a few drops of the Ag NPs in NMP on a carbon-coated copper grid, and dried in a vacuum oven at room temperature for 1 h. The optical properties of Ag NPs were analyzed using a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Varian Carry 5000) in a range of 300–800 nm. The PL quantum efficiency was measured on a Jasco (FP-6500) spectrofluorometer with a Xenon lamp excitation source and an integration sphere. The fluorescence image was obtained by confocal laser scanning microscopy using a white light source (Olympus Mercury 100 W). The laser beam was focused on a sample through a microscope objective (100× [oil]) mounted in an inverted microscope (Olympus IX 81). The conductivity was evaluated from the resistivity measured using a four-point-probe technique (CMT-SR1000N).
2 Preparation of Ag NPs
As shown in Fig. 1, Ag NPs were synthesized by reducing silver nitrate (AgNO3) using NMP as a reducing agent, where NMP has been also found to increase the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS.44,45 Briefly 3 mg of AgNO3 was added into 3 mL of NMP (stock solution, Ag@NMP). The vial was shaken for 1 min and then exposed to UV irradiation for 1 h. The Ag NPs in NMP (50 μL) were added to 1 mL of PEDOT:PSS (PH500) solution and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature over 2 h. For preparation of a reference electrode (NMP:PH500), pure NMP (50 μL) without Ag NPs was mixed with 1 mL PH500. A transparent anode with low series resistance is required for sufficient light absorption/emission and better charge extraction/injection in PSCs and PLEDs, respectively. As a replacement for ITO, pristine PH500, NMP:PH500 (1:20 v/v%), and Ag@NMP:PH500 (1:20 v/v%) were prepared on glass substrates by spin casting the above solutions at 2000 rpm for 60 s.

3 PSCs and PLEDs fabrication and characterization
The device structures of solar cells are glass/NMP:PH500/PTBT:PC61BM/Al for the reference and glass/Ag@NMP:PH500/PTBT:PC61BM/Al for the testing device. The devices were fabricated using the following procedures. First, the glass substrates were cleaned with a detergent, ultra-sonicated sequentially in acetone and isopropyl alcohol, and then dried in an oven overnight at 100 °C. NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 layers, which were used as anodes, were spin-coated (after passing through a 0.45 μm filter) onto glass substrates at 2000 rpm for 60 s, baked at 120 °C for 15 min in air and moved to a glove box. The top of the NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 layers was spin-coated with mixed solution of PTBT:PC61BM (1:2, 0.68 wt%) in o-dichlorobenzene at 1000 rpm for 60 s. The devices were pumped down in a vacuum (<10−6 torr), and a 100 nm thick Al electrode was deposited on top of the active layer. The deposited Al electrode area defined the active area of the devices as 13.5 mm2. The measurements of photovoltaic characteristics were taken with the solar cells inside a glove box using a high quality optical fiber to guide the light from the solar simulator equipped with a Keithley 2635A source measurement unit. The J–V curves for the devices were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 with a mask. The IPCE measurements were carried out in ambient air using an IPCE system (Model QEX7) by PV measurements Inc. (Boulder, Colorado). For the PLEDs, the device structures were glass/NMP:PH500/SY/LiF/Al and glass/Ag@NMP:PH500/SY/LiF/Al for the reference and testing device, respectively. A SY solution dissolved in chlorobenzene (0.8 wt%) was spin-cast at 2000 rpm for 45 s on top of the electrodes. Finally, a 1 nm-thick LiF layer and a 100 nm-thick Al layer were thermally evaporated on top of the SY layer. The current density and luminance versus the applied voltage characteristics were measured using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit and a Konica Minolta spectroradiometer (CS-2000).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image and UV-vis absorption spectra of the Ag NPs in solution (NMP) and in the film on a glass substrate. As shown in Fig. 1a, the Ag NPs were dispersed randomly with a diameter of 3 to 9 nm. The surface plasmon absorption band of Ag NPs was observed around 420 nm (Fig. 1b), which clearly indicates the formation of Ag NPs.46Fig. 1c shows the optical transmittance of the ITO, NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 films measured in air. The transparency of the NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 films is comparable to that of ITO. As shown in the inset in Fig. 1c, the Ag@NMP:PH500 film exhibited greater absorbance than NMP:PH500 in the vicinity of the Ag plasmonic peak around ∼420 nm. We also simulated the extinction and electromagnetic field enhancement near Ag NPs using a three dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D FDTD) method (Fig. S1†). By comparing the near-field enhancement by Ag NPs with a diameter of 3 to 9 nm, the 9 nm-sized Ag NP was calculated to show the strongest electromagnetic field enhancement. In addition, Ag NPs at the bottom and center positions in the PEDOT:PSS film showed almost identical electromagnetic field distribution around particles. The pristine PH500, NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 films showed conductivities (by a four-point-probe method)47 of 0.48 S cm−1, 322 S cm−1, and 450 S cm−1, respectively. As reported previously, the conductivity could be improved significantly over that of the pristine PH500 film by adding a small amount of NMP (5 vol%) to the PEDOT:PSS solution.45,48 Furthermore, the conductivity of the Ag@NMP:PH500 film was increased by ∼40% compared to that of NMP:PH500. This enhancement was attributed to the well-dispersed electrically conductive Ag NPs.36
An ITO-free bulk heterojunction solar cell was prepared by blending a low band gap polymer, PTBT as a donor and PC61BM as an acceptor for the active layer (Fig. 2a). The synthesis of PTBT and its photovoltaic properties were reported recently.43 The donor–acceptor (D–A) type alternating copolymer, PTBT exhibited broad absorption covering the whole visible region, with the absorption maxima at 605 nm and 652 nm in the film. The optical band gap (Eg) of the polymer was estimated to be 1.72 eV based on the onset point of the absorption spectrum in the film. However, PTBT shows a weak absorption in a wavelength range of 400–500 nm (Fig. S2†). Hence, the incident-photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) is relatively poor at this wavelength range. Therefore, light absorption of the PTBT:PC61BM-based photovoltaic device is expected to be enhanced by incorporating Ag NPs via the plasmonic effect around 420 nm. To optimize the device fabrication condition, more than 100 PSC and PLED devices with the NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 electrodes (as anodes) were tested. We first fabricated PTBT:PC61BM-based PSCs by changing the concentration of Ag@NMP from 1 to 10 vol% to get the optimum concentration of Ag NPs in PEDOT:PSS. Fig. S3 and Table S1† show that 5 vol% of Ag NPs is the optimized concentration for device fabrication. Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the ITO-free PSCs with NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 as anodes. The reference device with the NMP:PH500 electrode exhibited a JSC, open-circuit voltage (VOC), FF, and best PCE of 8.52 mA cm−2, 0.79 V, 0.48, and 3.27%, respectively. In contrast, the JSC, VOC, FF and best PCE values of the device with Ag@NMP:PH500 were improved remarkably to 9.11 mA cm−2, 0.84 V, 0.56, and 4.31%, respectively, as summarized in Table 1. The PSC device with Ag@NMP:PH500 leads to a ∼32% increase in PCE compared to the device without Ag NPs. To elucidate the effect of the Ag NPs on improving the JSC, the IPCE was measured for the devices with NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 electrodes (Fig. 3b). The IPCE values of the device with Ag@NMP:PH500 were higher than those of the NMP:PH500-based reference device in a range of 380 nm–520 nm. In Fig. 3c, the ΔIPCE (which represents the difference between IPCE of the devices with NMP-PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500) spectrum almost overlapped with the Ag plasmonic band, suggesting enhanced light absorption via the SPR effect of Ag NPs. This clearly supports the increased JSC resulting from amplified light absorption by the localized electromagnetic field enhancement. The FF of the device with Ag@NMP:PH500 (0.56) was also increased compared to that of the reference device (0.48), as shown in Table 1. The FF is related to the active layer thickness and series resistance (RS), which is the sum of the bulk resistance and contact resistance at the interfaces.22 Therefore, the sheet resistance of the electrode (Rsheet = 1/σ × d, where σ is the conductivity and d is the layer thickness) is closely related to the FF and RS. Note that all the processes for fabricating the active layer and electrodes were performed under identical conditions; a similar thickness for both devices is expected. Since the enhanced conductivity by the Ag NPs results in reduced Rsheet (638 Ω sq.−1 for NMP-PH500 → 444 Ω sq.−1 for Ag@NMP:PH500), the increased FF of the device can be attributed to the reduced RS. Therefore, the Ag NPs enhance optical and electrical properties, resulting in the increases in JSC and FF.42 Devices based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):PC61BM were also fabricated with the NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 electrodes. The results also exhibited a similar trend (JSC and FF were improved from 8.89 mA cm−2 and 0.43 to 9.34 mA cm−2 and 0.53, respectively), as shown in Fig. S4 and Table S2.† These indicate that our electrode system with Ag NPs and PEDOT:PSS can be extended to other polymeric photovoltaic devices.

For practical application of Ag@NMP:PH500 as the electrode, we evaluated long-term stability under ambient condition and fabricated flexible PSCs on a poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET) substrate. As shown in Fig. S5,† the devices with PH500 electrodes showed a similar temporal stability compared with the conventional ITO-based one. The PCE value was decreased by ∼66% for all devices within 200 h in air. Compared to the NMP:PH500 electrode, a flexible PSC with Ag@NMP:PH500 exhibited a substantially enhanced device efficiency (PCE: 1.55 → 2.06%) (Fig. 3d and Table S3†). Although we obtained the lower device properties using Ag@NMP:PH500 as an anode (relative to the device with ITO), our approach offers possibility of Ag@NMP:PH500 as a flexible plastic anode.
To assess the applicability to PLEDs, ITO-free PLEDs were also fabricated using the PEDOT:PSS electrodes with and without Ag NPs. The poly(phenylene vinylene)-based copolymer, Super Yellow (SY), was used as an emitting material and the device configuration was NMP:PH500 (or Ag@NMP:PH500)/SY/LiF/Al, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 4 shows the light-emitting characteristics of the PLEDs with NMP:PH500 and Ag@NMP:PH500 electrodes. As shown in Fig. 4a, charge injection in the device with Ag@NMP:PH500 was improved compared to the reference device with NMP:PH500. The reference device with NMP:PH500 exhibited a maximum luminance, electroluminescence (EL) efficiency, and power efficiency of 15582 cd m−2 (at 21.0 V), 14.43 cd A−1 (at 14.2 V), and 3.75 lm W−1 (at 8.2 V), respectively. In contrast, the device with Ag@NMP:PH500 showed substantially improved light-emitting characteristics with a maximum luminance, EL efficiency, and power efficiency of 22402 cd m−2 (at 20.2 V), 16.77 cd A−1 (at 9.4 V), and 8.4 lm W−1 (at 5.0 V), respectively. Fluorescence emission enhancement of the SY film with Ag NPs supports the improved device performance, which was confirmed by solid-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The SY film with Ag@NMP:PH500 exhibited enhanced photoluminescence (PL) quantum efficiency (7.1 → 18.6%) via the incorporation of Ag NPs (Fig. S6a†). Similarly, a confocal laser scanning microscopy image showed the stronger SY fluorescence intensity around Ag NPs. (Fig. S6b†). The power efficiency of the device with Ag@NMP:PH500 was increased remarkably by 124% (Table 1). This must be related closely to SPR-assisted acceleration of the radiative recombination because the spontaneous emission rate increases through strong resonance coupling between the exciton in the emitting material and the SPR mode of Ag NPs.

Conclusions
In summary, this study successfully demonstrated ITO-free PSCs and PLEDs with the SPR effect and the possibility of solution-processed PEDOT:PSS containing Ag NPs as a flexible plastic electrode. The Ag NPs-incorporated Ag@NMP:PH500 electrode exhibited a high conductivity of 450 S cm−1 with similar transparency to ITO. The PSC device based on PTBT:PC61BM with the Ag@NMP:PH500 electrode showed a 1% absolute enhancement in the power conversion efficiency (3.27 to 4.31%), whereas the power efficiency of the PLEDs was improved by 124% (3.75 to 8.4 lm W−1) compared to the reference devices without Ag NPs. The SPR effect and improved electrical conductivity by the Ag NPs clearly contributed to increments in light absorption/emission in the active layer as well as the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS electrode in PSCs and PLEDs. The solution-processable conducting polymer-based electrode, Ag@NMP:PH500 with Ag NPs, is a promising candidate as a flexible electrode for large area and flexible optoelectronic devices with a low-cost fabrication process.

Broader context
As a result of efforts to find new renewable energy sources by replacing environmentally harmful fossil fuels and nuclear power plants, solar cell technologies have been intensively studied for last few decades. In particular, a polymer solar cell (PSC) is one of the promising energy sources because of its advantages such as low cost, mechanical flexibility and solution processability for large area devices. However, indium-tin-oxide (ITO) used as an electrode is against cost-effective and flexible device fabrication due to its increasing cost and brittleness. Hence, many efforts to replace ITO with solution-processable flexible electrodes have been tried recently. A highly conductive polymer, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been highlighted with its high conductivity and flexibility. Here, we report that silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) increase conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS electrode and contribute to increments in light absorption/emission in an active layer via surface plasmon resonance in PSCs and polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs). Therefore, the conducting polymer electrode with the Ag NPs is a promising approach to overcome the limitations of ITO for PSC and PLEDs.
