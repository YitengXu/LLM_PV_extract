    , Accepted 2nd September 2022First published on 5th September 2022AbstractA great hurdle restricting the optoelectronic applications of cesium lead halide perovskite (CsPbX3) nanocrystals (NCs) is due to the uncoordinated lead atoms (Pb0) on the surface, where most attempts to address the challenges in the literature depend on complicated post-treatment processes. Here we report a simple in situ surface engineering strategy to obtain highly fluorescent and stable perovskite NCs, wherein the introduction of the multifunctional additive 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4) can significantly eliminate the Pb0 traps. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the as-synthesized NCs was improved from 63.82% to 94.63% due to the good passivation of the surface defects. We also confirm the universality of this in situ passivation pathway to remove Pb0 deep traps by using fluoride acid-based ionic liquids (ILs). Due to the high hydrophobicity of the cations of ILs, the as-prepared CsPbBr3 NCs exhibit robust water resistance stability, maintaining 67.5% of the initial photoluminescence (PL) intensity after immersion in water for 21 days. A white light emitting diode (LED), assembled by mixing the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs and red K2SiF6:Mn4+ phosphors onto a blue chip, exhibits high luminous efficiency (100.07 lm W−1) and wide color gamut (140.64% of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard). This work provides a promising and facile technique to eliminate the Pb0 traps and improve the optical performance and stability of halide perovskite NCs, facilitating their applications in optoelectronic fields.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years, inorganic cesium lead halide perovskites with the formula CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) have emerged as a promising substitute for traditional nanocrystals (NCs) for optoelectronic applications due to their excellent electrical and optical properties.1–5 However, their intrinsic instability and easy degradability in air and humid environments have become the main bottleneck for their industrialization and commercialization.6–8 It is a prerequisite to explore effective approaches to improve the long-term stability of CsPbX3 NCs while maintaining superior optoelectronic properties.
The deterioration of perovskite NCs mainly originates from lattice defects, including vacancies (VCs, VPb, VX), interstitials (Csi, Pbi, Xi), and antisites (CsPb, PbCs, CsX, PbX, XCs, XPb).9 Though most of these point defects introduce shallow traps, they provide a diffusion pathway for ions and non-radiative centers for carriers, thus compromising the photophysical properties and long-term stability of NCs.10 To date, ligand substitution and halide compensation strategies have been proved to be effective strategies for the elimination of shallow defects (such as A-site/X-site vacancies).11–15 Apart from the above point defects, the under-coordinated Pb2+ on the NC surface is prone to be reduced to metallic Pb0 during the preparation process or exposing under light and thermal stress, which serves as a deep defect state and seriously deteriorates the emission performance of NCs.16 Unfortunately, the research progress on the passivation of the deep defect state lags behind that of shallow defects, and the attempts to eliminate Pb defects are still rare. To date, researchers have mainly focused on the passivation of Pb defects on the NC surface via the post-treatment of thiocyanate salts,17,18 polyatomic pseudohalogen tetrafluoroborate,19,20 and metallic nitrate,21 which gives rise to the improvement of the emission performance and stability. Nevertheless, the problems of a tedious operation procedure, long preparation cycle, and high processing cost are inevitable for the above post-treatment methods. There are ongoing efforts to explore facile in situ strategies for passivating the deep defects of perovskite NCs.
Recently, ionic liquids (ILs) have been used in perovskite solar cells for modulating the crystal growth and morphology of perovskite films owing to their unique and versatile properties, resulting in the improvement of power conversion efficiency of photovoltaic devices.22,23 There are a large variety of ILs that have been explored, and their physicochemical properties can be tuned by elaborately designing the anion and cation compositions.24 Considering the engaging properties of ILs, such as negligible vapor pressure, excellent thermal stability, high ionic conductivity, and strong bonding features, they may be used to improve the performances of perovskite NCs. ILs will play important roles in modulating the growth kinetics and surface properties of perovskite NCs. Different from the perovskite films, the NCs prepared in colloidal solutions are highly sensitive to the polarity of solvents.25 Therefore, the regulation of luminescence kinetics of perovskite NCs based on ILs needs to be investigated.
In this work, we report 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4) to improve the emission performance and stability of CsPbBr3 NCs. Benefiting from the strong bonding features of both the pseudo-halide BF4− anion and the conjugated aromatic [Bmim]+ cation in the IL, the elimination of Pb0 deep traps as well as the passivation of the NC surface can be realized simultaneously, resulting in the dramatic decrease of non-radiative recombination centers. As a result, a significant increase of the PLQY from 63.82% to 94.63% was achieved and the storage, light, and water-resistant stabilities of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs were greatly improved. We also found that the emission performance of NCs could be effectively improved with the assistance of the F-containing IL, demonstrating the universality of this IL in situ passivation pathway. Moreover, a white light-emitting diode (LED) device with superior optoelectronic performances was fabricated by packaging CsPbBr3 NCs and K2SiF6:Mn4+ (KSF:Mn4+) red phosphors onto a commercial blue chip.
2. Results and discussion
The in situ passivation of lead defects on the surface of CsPbBr3 NCs was conducted by using a modified room-temperature supersaturated recrystallization method. Fig. 1a depicts the in situ passivation process of CsPbBr3 NCs with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4. For the CsPbX3 NCs synthesized using the conventional ligand pairs of OA and OAm, the reduction of under-coordinated Pb2+ on the NC surface during the preparation process or exposing under light and thermal stress leads to the formation of metallic Pb0, which critically acts as non-radiative recombination centers and degradation sources of NCs, resulting in the poor emission property and stability of NCs.16 After introducing the IL [Bmim]BF4 into the precursor, the formation of surface metallic Pb0 can be effectively inhibited owing to the strong interaction between BF4− and Pb2+. The hydrophobic cation of the IL can also passivate the surface defects of NCs, creating a protective shell around the NC surface. Consequently, the emission performance and stability of NCs can be effectively improved through this in situ passivation process by exploiting the multifunctional IL.

Fig. 1b illustrates the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with different molar ratios of n[Bmim]BF4/nPb. The diffraction peaks at 15.2° and 30.7° are well indexed to the (100) and (200) planes of the monoclinic phase of CsPbBr3 (JCPDS no. 18-0364).26,27 The diffraction intensity increases and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the diffraction peak decreases with the increase in the values of molar ratios of n[Bmim]BF4/nPb, which indicates improved crystallinity and increased particle size.28,29 The average size of NCs was calculated based on the Scherrer formula, and the results are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The calculated average size of CsPbBr3 NCs with n[Bmim]BF4/nPb = 0, 0.06, 0.12, 0.18, and 0.24 was determined to be 10.11 nm, 10.34 nm, 11.21 nm, 11.72 nm, and 14.05 nm, respectively. The optical properties of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs with different n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratios are shown in Fig. 1c–e. The absorption spectra in Fig. 1c show an excitonic peak in the range of 500–510 nm, which is consistent with previous results.30 The absorption and emission peaks of NCs exhibit a red-shift tendency with the increase of the n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratio, which can be attributed to the increase of the particle size. The emission intensity of CsPbBr3 NCs gradually increases with the increase of the n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratio from 0 to 0.12 (Fig. 1d and Fig. S1a, ESI†), and the PLQY of NCs increases from 63.82% to 94.63% (Fig. 1e), indicating the decline of non-radiative recombination with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4. This may be ascribed to the removal of defects by the anion and cation of the IL, which will be discussed later. For samples with increased n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratios, the emission intensity of NCs decreases due to the corrosion of the NC surface and the formation of surface defects as a result of the large polarity of the IL [Bmim]BF4.25
In association with the enhanced emission performance, the red-shift of the emission peak is also observed after the incorporation of [Bmim]BF4, which may be a result of increased particle sizes. Fig. 2 presents the TEM images and size distribution histograms of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with different n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratios. As shown in Fig. 2a, the NCs prepared without [Bmim]BF4 consist of nanocubes and cuboids, and the statistical average size of NCs is 9.82 ± 4.01 nm. Many “black dots” on the surface of NCs are observed (red circular dotted line in Fig. 2a), which can be attributed to the formation of Pb0 during the reaction.11,31,32 This lead-rich surface is detrimental to the emission property of CsPbX3 NCs,10 resulting in the low PLQY of the sample (63.82%). When the n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratio increases to 0.06, the particles are mainly composed of nanocubes, demonstrating that the morphology of NCs tends to be uniform with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4. The number of “black dots” on the NC surface significantly decreases. The “black dots” are almost fully eliminated upon further increasing the n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratio to 0.12, indicating that the surface Pb0 can be effectively removed by adding [Bmim]BF4, which is the most possible reason for the improvement of emission performance. For NCs prepared with n[Bmim]BF4/nPb = 0.06, 0.12, and 0.18, the average size of NCs was found to be 10.05 ± 2.63 nm, 10.95 ± 1.01 nm, and 11.89 ± 1.33 nm, in accordance with the calculated results using the Scherrer formula (Table S1, ESI†). The high-resolution TEM images present well-defined lattice spacings with interplanar distances in the range of 0.412–0.413 nm, which correspond to the (110) plane of monoclinic CsPbBr3 crystals.26,27 The morphology changes illustrate that the introduction of [Bmim]BF4 into the formation of CsPbBr3 effectively modulates the crystallization kinetics and passivates the surface defects of NCs. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the HAADF-STEM image and elemental maps of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with n[Bmim]BF4/nPb = 0.12. Cs, Pb, Br, B, and F elements are found to homogeneously disperse throughout the NCs, further confirming the existence of BF4− on the NC surface.

To further explore the role of ILs in the emission dynamics of CsPbBr3 NCs, fluorescence decay measurement was conducted. Fig. 3a shows the time-resolved PL spectra of samples prepared with different n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratios. The curves could be well fitted with the biexponential decay equation, I(t) = I0 + B1exp(−t/τ1) + B2exp(−t/τ2). The short lifetime (τ1) is attributed to the exciton radiative recombination, while the long lifetime (τ2) originates from the radiative recombination of surface defects.19 As listed in Table S2 (ESI†), the proportion of τ1 increases from 80.12% to 95.32% with the increase of the n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratio from 0 to 0.12, and the corresponding weight of τ2 decreases from 19.88% to 4.68%, indicating that the surface defects are suppressed.33 Accordingly, the average lifetime decreases from 88.43 ns to 23.55 ns. Furthermore, the radiative (kr) and non-radiative (knr) recombination rates were calculated based on the PLQY and the PL decay lifetime to further explore the effects of n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratios on the charge carrier dynamics of NCs. As shown in Table S2 (ESI†) and Fig. 3b, the kr of NCs increases from 7.22 × 106 s−1 to 4.01 × 107 s−1 with the increase of the n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratio from 0 to 0.12, while the knr decreases from 4.09 × 106 s−1 to 2.32 × 105 s−1. The ratio of kr to knr (kr/knr) dramatically increases from 1.77 to 172.84, suggesting that the surface defects of NCs are effectively passivated.34 In a semiconductor, the absorption edge below the bandgap was defined as the Urbach tail, which could reflect the degree of electronic disorder in the crystal.35 The Urbach energy (EU) could be calculated by fitting the exponential part of the Urbach tail according to formula (1): (1)EU is defined as EU = kBT/σ(T), where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and σ(T) is the steepness factor. Fig. 3c shows the exponential relationship of absorbance (α) versus photon energy for CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with different n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratios. The EU value of the samples decreases remarkably from 41.59 meV to 24.77 meV with the increase of the n[Bmim]BF4/nPb ratio from 0 to 0.12 (Fig. S1b, ESI†), revealing a lower level of electronic disorder or defect density in the NCs.36,37 The EU values gradually increase with further increase of the addition amount of [Bmim]BF4. The result is consistent with the consequences mentioned above.

Temperature-dependent PL spectra, intensity map of height-normalized emission spectra, and the corresponding integrated PL intensity as a function of temperature of the as-synthesized CsPbBr3 (d–f) without and (g–i) with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4. 

Fig. 3d and g show the temperature-dependent PL spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared without and with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4 in the range of 80–300 K. The emission intensity of NCs decreases with the increase of temperature because of the thermally activated non-radiative recombination.38 The temperature quenching behaviour was studied using the following formula (2): (2)where I0 is the integrated emission intensity at 0 K, A is a constant, Eb is the exciton binding energy, and kB is the Boltzmann constant. Fig. 3f and i show the Arrhenius plots for the PL integrated intensities of the samples. It is seen that the Eb value of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4 reaches up to 77.05 meV, which is much higher than that of the untreated sample (47.35 meV), indicating the relatively better excitonic stability and higher recombination probability of the modified NCs.38–40 It is remarkable that the Eb of CsPbBr3 NCs is much higher than the results reported in the literature (35.0–62.7 meV).41,42 The emission peak of NCs exhibits a blue-shift tendency with the increase of temperature from 80 K to 300 K, which is quite different from the well-known Varshni model.43 This could be attributed to the crystal lattice thermal expansion and electron–phonon renormalization. Similar behaviors have also been reported in some literature studies.38,44 The evolution of the FWHM of the emission peak at different temperatures is shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The FWMH broadening phenomenon can be observed with increasing temperature. In order to further study the influence of surface modification on the exciton–phonon interaction of CsPbBr3 NCs, the Boson model (formula (3)) was employed to explain the above process.45,46 (3)where the three terms are the inhomogeneous broadening, exciton–acoustic phonon, and exciton–optical phonon interactions, respectively. ħωOP represents the longitudinal optical phonon energy. According to formula (3), Γ0 dominates the FWHM of NCs at low temperatures, resulting in the almost constant broadening of the line width. However, acoustic and optical phonons play dominant roles for the line width at higher temperatures, and the nonlinear increase of the FWHM is expected. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the ħωOP values of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared without and with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4 are calculated to be 44.76 and 68.38 meV. The larger ħωOP value for the modified sample indicates the stronger exciton–phonon interaction, leading to the enhanced thermal stability.47
To elucidate the surface chemical characteristics of the prepared CsPbBr3 NCs, the FT-IR and XPS spectra were further characterized. As shown in Fig. 4a, the stretching vibrations of C–H bonds originating from OA and OAm could be detected at 2924 cm−1, 2854 cm−1, and 1465 cm−1 in controlled and modified CsPbBr3 NCs.48,49 For the FT-IR spectrum of the modified CsPbBr3 NCs, an extra band at 1572 cm−1 was detected. It could be assigned to the existence of the imidazolium ring; this further confirms that [Bmim]+ is adsorbed on the NC surface.50,51 It is found that the stretching vibration peak of the C–N bond of [Bmim]+ shifts from 1169 cm−1 to 1156 cm−1, indicating that [Bmim]+ coordinates with the NC surface,52 which is beneficial for passivating the surface defects of NCs. As for the weak peak at 1060 cm−1, it is attributed to the B–F bonding of BF4− bound to lead.53 The FT-IR results verify the successful inclusion of [Bmim]BF4 and the good passivation of the NC surface. XPS was further performed to investigate the surface chemical states of the as-synthesized samples. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), the electronic signals corresponding to Cs, Pb, and Br elements emerge in all the XPS spectra. Fig. 4b presents the Pb 4f spectra of CsPbBr3 NCs, which show the main peaks at 138.2 eV (Pb 4f7/2) and 143.1 eV (Pb 4f5/2) with a spin–orbit splitting of 4.9 eV, indicating the existence of Pb2+.54 Extra peaks at the binding energy site (137.8 eV and 142.7 eV) close to the main peaks are detected. This originates from the surface Pb ions.8,55 With the introduction of [Bmim]BF4, the peak intensity of surface Pb is significantly weakened, demonstrating the successful removal of Pb atoms on the NC surface. The quantitative analysis of CsPbBr3 NCs indicated a Pb:Cs molar ratio of 1.13 for the control sample, showing a Pb-rich condition compared with the stoichiometry. The same ratio decreases to 0.99 for the other samples, which further verifies that many Pb atoms adsorbed on the surface of NCs were removed. The intensified N 1s electronic signal (Fig. 4c) and the existence of F 1s peak (Fig. 4d) in the modified NCs further demonstrate that both [Bmim]+ and BF4− of IL were adsorbed on the surface of CsPbBr3 NCs.

To further understand the role of chain length of ILs in the formation of CsPbBr3 NCs and explore the generality of this strategy, a series of commonly used ILs with longer and shorter alkyl chain lengths than [Bmim]+ were also investigated in this work. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with the assistance of [Mim]BF4, [Emim]BF4, [Hmim]BF4, and [Omim]BF4, respectively. The peak positions of all samples are well matched with monoclinic CsPbBr3 (JCPDS no. 18-0364),26,27 indicating that CsPbBr3 can be obtained with the assistance of all these ILs. The intensity of the diffraction peaks increases and the width of those peaks becomes narrower with increasing the amount of ILs. This could also be ascribed to the improvement of crystallinity and the increase of particle size.28,29
The optical performances of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with various ILs are summarized in Fig. S6 (ESI†). All the emission and absorption peaks show a regular red-shift tendency with the increase of the values of nIL/nPb, which is attributed to the increase of particle size. For a more intuitive comparison, Fig. 5a presents the emission intensity comparison of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared by adding various ILs at the optimal additive amount. It is seen that the emission intensity of NCs can be improved with the assistance of these ILs in comparison with the control sample. Meanwhile, the addition amount of ILs responsible for achieving the optimal emission intensity of CsPbBr3 NCs reduces from 0.24 to 0.06 with extending the chain length of ILs. This could be attributed to the fact that the polarity of these ILs was gradually increased with the increase of their chain length.56–58 The NC surface would be etched by the ILs with a large polarity due to the ionic and soft nature of the perovskite lattice,59 resulting in the formation of surface defects and the attenuation of emission property. The sample, which has the optimal emission performance with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4, is found to be with the nIL/nPb ratio of 0.12. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the TEM images and size distribution histograms of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared by adding different ILs, while the nIL/nPb ratio is 0.12. It is observed that the NCs consist of nanocubes with good dispersity, and the average size of NCs is in the range of 10.03–11.36 nm. The time-resolved PL curves of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with different ILs are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), and the fitting results using the biexponential function are given in Table S3 (ESI†). The variation trend of the average decay time is consistent with that of the PL spectra, where the NCs prepared with the assistance of these ILs exhibit shorter lifetimes (23.55–50.47 ns) compared with that of control sample (88.43 ns). The significant decrease of the PL lifetime indicates that the introduction of ILs effective suppresses the non-radiative recombination of NCs.60 Furthermore, the fraction of fast decay component (B1) increases from 89.15% to 95.32% (the data are shown in Table S2, ESI†) with extending the chain length of ILs from [Mim]+ to [Bmim]+, which could be attributed to the good passivation of surface defects.19
 Fig. 5  Emission intensity comparison of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared using (a) IL with different chain lengths and (b) different fluorine sources. 
In addition to BF4− containing imidazole ILs, other fluorine sources were also employed to study the effect of ILs on the PL property of CsPbBr3 NCs. A PF6− containing imidazolyl IL [Bmim]PF6 and an inorganic BF4− containing salt NaBF4 were utilized to synthesize CsPbBr3 NCs, respectively. Fig. S9 and S10 (ESI†) present the XRD patterns of samples prepared by using these two fluorine sources with different additive amounts. The diffraction patterns show peaks at 2θ = 15.2° and 30.7°, which indicates that the different fluorine sources do not affect the formation of CsPbBr3.26,27 The diffraction intensity gradually increases with increasing the additive amount of [Bmim]PF6 (Fig. S9, ESI†), which demonstrates the enlarged particle size of NCs. In contrast, the diffraction intensity of samples reduces along with the increase of the nNaBF4/nPb ratios (Fig. S10, ESI†), indicating the decrease of particle size. Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows the optical properties of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with the assistance of [Bmim]PF6 and NaBF4. It is clearly seen that the emission intensity of NCs can be significantly enhanced when the ratio of n[Bmim]PF6/nPb is 0.12 (Fig. S11b and c, ESI†). The peak position of the sample shifts from 516.4 nm to 519.3 nm with the increase of the n[Bmim]PF6/nPb ratios. However, the absorption and emission peaks of samples exhibit a blue-shift tendency with the increase of the nNaBF4/nPb ratios (Fig. S11d–f, ESI†), suggesting the decrease of particle size. The existence of a board absorption shoulder at the high-energy side and the concurrent presence of a shoulder with a tail on the short wavelength side suggest the non-uniform distribution of particle size. The emission intensity of CsPbBr3 NCs gradually declines with increasing the additive amount of NaBF4. This might be attributed to the fact that the partial organic ligands were removed during the interaction between BF4− and surface Pb atoms, causing the insufficient passivation of surface traps.20 On the other hand, the inorganic metal ion Na+ could not sufficiently passivate the surface defects of NCs compared to the organic imidazolyl cations of ILs. Fig. 5b presents the emission intensity comparison of samples prepared by introducing different fluorine sources at the optimal additive amount. It could be inferred that the emission property of NCs was effectively improved with the assistance of fluorine containing ILs. These results confirm the effectiveness and universality of the IL on boosting the emission performance of perovskite NCs.
The TEM images of samples prepared with the assistance of [Bmim]PF6 and NaBF4 are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. S12a and b (ESI†), the NCs prepared by adding [Bmim]PF6 are regular nanocubes in shape with an average size of around 10 nm. A large amount of nanorods can be seen in accordance with some nanocubes when NaBF4 is adopted as the fluorine source (Fig. S12c and d, ESI†). The nanorods have typical lengths in the range of 20–30 nm and width of ∼5 nm. The coexistence of nanorods and nanocubes causes the presence of a wide shoulder in absorption and emission spectra at the high-energy side (Fig. S11d and e, ESI†). The calculated Bohr diameter of CsPbBr3 was 7 nm based on the effective mass theory.61,62 Here the diameter of nanorods is smaller than 7 nm, which induces the quantum confinement of NCs, resulting in the blue shift of absorption and emission peaks.63 The existence of BF4− on the surface of NCs is verified by the presence of a B–F asymmetric stretching vibration band at 1060 cm−1 (Fig. S13, ESI†) as well as the F 1s electron signal at 686.8 eV (Fig. S14, ESI†). Based on this result, there was no doubt that the introduction of NaBF4 was responsible for the formation of nanorods, which might be attributed to the removal of the organic ligands on the NC surface during the interaction between BF4− and NCs.20 In the BF4− group with a tetrahedral shape, the B atom is surrounded by four symmetric F atoms. It was reported that F could generate a strong dipole moment induced the crystal field due to the high electro-negativity as well as the strong electron withdrawing ability. This will further promote the orientation attachment of CsPbBr3 nanocubes, leading to the formation of nanorods.20,64
In addition to the improvement of the emission performance of CsPbBr3 NCs, stability is another important issue that needs to be resolved for its commercial application. In fact, the high dynamics between the commonly used organic ligands (e.g., OA and OAm) and the NC surface seriously affects the stability.64,65 As shown in Fig. 6a and Fig. S15 (ESI†), the emission intensity of the control sample gradually declines with the increase of the storage time, and only 55.1% of initial intensity maintains after the storage of 1512 h. In addition, the emission peak of samples shifts from 513.5 nm to 517.5 nm, indicating that the NCs aggregated and grew into large particles. However, the emission intensity of CsPbBr3 NCs prepared with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4 retains 85.8% of the original intensity (Fig. 6a), and only a 1.8 nm red-shift of the emission peak is observed (Fig. 6b), demonstrating the improvement of storage stability. The irradiation stability of NCs under UV light was also evaluated (Fig. 6c and d, and Fig. S16, ESI†). The modified NC solution exhibits a 2.2 nm shift of the emission wavelength and retains around 90% of its initial intensity after continuous irradiation under a UV light for 360 min, while the control sample shows a decrease to 78% of the emission intensity and shows a pronounced red-shift of the emission peak (9.4 nm).

To further confirm the enhanced stability of the modified CsPbBr3 NCs, the water resistance stability was investigated by injecting an equal volume of deionized water into the CsPbBr3 hexane solution. As shown in Fig. 7a, the colour of control sample turns from green to colorless along with increasing the treatment time from 1 to 21 days, and the corresponding emission intensity gradually declines. The initial emission intensity decreases to 19.2% after being treated for 21 days. This indicates the fast degradation of NCs. As shown in Fig. 7d, the NC solution exhibits strong green emission under a UV light even after 21 days of water treatment. Additionally, 67.5% of the initial emission intensity remains, which is much higher than that of the control sample. Compared with previous reports, the colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs in this work exhibit significantly improved water resistance stability (Table S4, ESI†).66–69 This can be attributed to the fact that the adsorbed cation [Bmim]+ on the surface of NCs creates a hydrophobic and protective barrier against water, which is responsible for the robust water resistance stability of the modified NCs. To date, the passivation of Pb defects via the post-treatment of tetrafluoroborate has been reported.19,20 Nevertheless, tedious operation procedure, long preparation cycle, and high processing cost are inevitable during the post-treatment process. Unlike these works, we propose a simple and efficient in situ deep defect passivation strategy for CsPbBr3 NCs by using fluoride acid-based ILs. More importantly, the introduced IL plays multiple roles in improving the optical properties and stability of CsPbBr3 NCs. As a result, the modified CsPbBr3 NCs not only possess excellent optical properties, but also present high stability against UV light irradiation and water treatment, demonstrating their wide application prospects in optoelectronic devices.

Considering the greatly improved performance and stability, a white LED device was fabricated by combining CsPbBr3 NCs and commercial KSF:Mn4+ red phosphors onto a blue chip. Fig. 8a shows the luminescence spectrum of the prepared white LED. As can be seen in the inset of Fig. 8a, the device emits bright white light under a forward bias of 20 mA. The Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of device is (0.318, 0.338) with a high luminous efficacy (LE) of 100.07 lm W−1, which is much higher than those of the most reported perovskite-based white LEDs (Table 1).40,70–77 The device exhibits a wide color gamut, in which the selected CIE coordinates for blue, green, and red monochromatic light encompass 140.64% of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) standard (Fig. 8b), demonstrating the excellent backlight performance. The luminescence spectra of the white LED as a function of the forward bias are shown in Fig. 8c. The emission intensities for both CsPbBr3 NCs and KSF:Mn4+ phosphors gradually increase because of the increase of the driving current from 20 to 120 mA, indicating that there is no saturation for these luminescent materials toward blue light. In addition, the LE of the device decreases from 100.07 to 56.86 lm W−1, and CCT displays a tunable range of 5977–6327 K. Table 1 summarizes the performances of CsPbBr3-based white LEDs and gives a comparison with previous publications. Our device shows relatively better optoelectronic performances compared with the previous reports, which suggests potential application in the backlight display field.78

3. Conclusions
We demonstrate a novel and efficient in situ deep defect passivation strategy for boosting the emission performance of CsPbBr3 NCs by using fluoride acid-based ILs. The incorporation of [Bmim]BF4 contributes to the removal of the deep defect Pb0 on the NC surface and the passivation of surface defects as a result of the synergistic effect of BF4− and [Bmim]+, which effectively improves the PLQYs from 63.82% to 94.63%. Notably, the universality of this in situ passivation method for perovskite NCs by exploiting fluoride acid-based ILs as additives is demonstrated. Moreover, [Bmim]+ creates a hydrophobic and protective barrier on the surface of NCs, which is responsible for the robust water resistance and outstanding UV light irradiation/storage stability of CsPbBr3 NCs. Finally, a white LED is assembled by packaging the modified CsPbBr3 NCs and red KSF:Mn4+ phosphors onto a blue chip, which shows high LE (100.07 lm W−1) and a wide color gamut (140.64% of NTSC), demonstrating its great application potential in the backlight display field.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
Cesium acetate (CsOAc, 99.0%), lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.0%), hexane (C6H14, 97.0%), oleic acid (OA, AR), oleylamine (OAm, 80–90%), ethyl acetate (EA, 99.0%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.5%), and sodium fluoroborate (NaBF4, 99.0%) were purchased from Aladdin. The ILs (1-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Mim]BF4), 1-ethyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Emim]BF4), 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Bmim]BF4), 1-hexyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Hmim]BF4), 1-octyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([Omim]BF4), and 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([Bmim]PF6)) with analytical purity were obtained from Linzhou Keneng Material Technology Co., Ltd, China. Toluene (C7H8, 99.5%) was supplied by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. All chemicals were used as received.
4.2 Synthesis of CsPbBr3 NCs
PbBr2 (1.0 mmol, 0.3670 g) and CsOAc (0.5 mmol, 0.0960 g) were dissolved in 10 mL of DMF containing 1.2 mL of OA and 0.3 mL OAm. Then, a certain amount of [Bmim]BF4 with n[Bmim]BF4/nPb = 0, 0.06, 0.12, 0.18, and 0.24 was added into the solution. The mixture solution was stirred at room temperature until a transparent solution was obtained. Subsequently, 0.4 mL of the precursor was quickly injected into 10 mL of toluene. The colour of the solution changed to yellow-green immediately. After stirring for 20 s, the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Subsequently, the precipitate was discarded and EA was added into the supernatant. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the precipitate was re-dispersed in 5 mL of hexane to obtain the desired dispersed CsPbBr3 NCs.
4.3 Fabrication of the white LED device
To fabricate the white LED, 0.3 g of CsPbBr3 NCs and 0.6 g of K2SiF6:Mn4+ (KSF:Mn4+) phosphors were blended with silicone. Subsequently, the obtained slurry was dropped on the top of a blue LED chip (λpeak = 450 nm) followed by being cured. The optoelectronic performance of the device was collected using an HAAS-2000 high accuracy array spectroradiometer (Hangzhou Everfine, China).
4.4 Characterization
A D8 Advance (Bruker) diffractometer equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source was employed to collect the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-synthesized NCs. The absorption and emission spectra were measured using a Lambda850 spectrometer (PerkinElmer) and an F-7000 fluorescence spectrometer (Hitachi), respectively. The PLQYs of samples were calculated by using the ethanol solution of rhodamine 6G as the reference (PLQY = 95%), and the absorbances of all samples were diluted below 0.1. The morphology was measured using a Titan G260-300 transmission electron microscope (TEM) which operates at 200 keV. XPS was performed using a PHI Quantera SXM spectrometer with an achromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The FT-IR data were obtained using a Nicolet 5700 spectrometer. The fluorescence decay processes were recorded using a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with excitation at 374 nm at room temperature.
4.5 Stability measurements
For the storage stability measurement, the control sample and CsPbBr3 NC solution prepared with the assistance of [Bmim]BF4 were sealed in glass bottles. The bottles were stored under dark conditions in a refrigerator (∼4 °C), and the PL intensity of samples was measured at different time intervals. The photostability of CsPbBr3 NCs was investigated by comparing the PL intensity over different periods of time under illumination with a 365 nm UV lamp (20 W). In order to evaluate the water resistance stability, 2.0 mL of the CsPbBr3 NC solution was mixed with 2.0 mL of deionized water.
