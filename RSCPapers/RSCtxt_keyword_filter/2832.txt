1. Introduction
The world is faced with significant global environmental issues including, but not limited to, overpopulation, climate change, waste disposal, natural resource depletion, and air, water and soil pollution.1 Our environment has been subjected to years of urbanization2 and industrialization3 presenting long term, and in some cases irreversible, effects that need to be addressed.4 Towards the abatement of some of these critical issues, a relatively new field of chemistry, green chemistry, has gained tremendous momentum as it embraces and implements the invention and design of chemical products and processes that mitigate and/or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances.5
Among the various materials that have been studied in the field of green chemistry are metal–organic frameworks (MOFs). MOFs are hybrid materials, containing both organic and inorganic components (Scheme 1).6 These crystalline and porous materials offer a high degree of structural tunability through variation of the metal node and organic linker building blocks used in their synthesis. In addition to tailoring the chemical identity and functionality of the metal nodes and organic linkers, other properties which can be fine-tuned include pore size,7 pore shape,8 and node connectivity9 (i.e., the presence or absence of “open metal sites”). The remarkable designability of MOFs has enabled their study in areas such as gas capture and storage,10 catalysis,11 wastewater remediation,12 chemical separations,13 and solar fuels generation,14 amongst others.

The synthesis of MOFs is largely performed under solvothermal conditions in high boiling point, polar solvents such as dimethylformamide and diethylformamide.15 Although recycling and the reuse of these solvents is possible in some cases,16 there is still a push to reduce or eliminate the use of these hazardous organic compounds in both research and industrial laboratories.17 This push towards the reduction or elimination of dimethylformamide in particular can be seen by its inclusion on hazardous/priority substances lists created by the United States Clean Air Act,18 the European Chemicals Agency,19 and the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.20 The need to reduce or eliminate the use of these hazardous solvents is also reflected in the twelve principles of green chemistry.5 As such, there are significant research efforts dedicated to finding suitable replacement solvents for the synthesis of MOFs.21 In addition to replacing hazardous solvents, green synthesis methods including thermochemical,22 mechanochemical,23 and aging24 processes have been developed to eliminate or significantly reduce the amount of solvent required for MOF synthesis, whereas other methods such as electrochemical,25 sonochemical26 and microwave-assisted heating27 seek to lower the energy input required for MOF synthesis.
While the development of greener synthetic methods and processes is important to the field of MOF chemistry (as well as many other fields of chemistry),17b,28 so too is the implementation of MOFs in green applications. The unique and tunable properties of MOFs make them potential candidates for a wide range of environmentally conscious or “green” applications, and the ultimate goal should be to bridge green MOF synthesis with green applications to achieve the greatest positive environmental impact of these materials. Herein, some examples of green applications of MOFs will be discussed including traditional green chemistry applications in catalysis,29 and solar energy conversion,30 as well as other green applications such as hydrogen storage,31 carbon capture,32 air pollution remediation,33 and water pollution remediation.34
2. Catalysis
The ninth principle of green chemistry states that catalytic processes are superior to stoichiometric ones.5 In fact, catalysis is one of the most important tools for accomplishing many of the goals set forth by the twelve principles of green chemistry.35 This is, in part, because catalytic processes aim to decrease the amount of material utilized while also minimizing the energy input required. The use of heterogeneous catalysts has additional positive implications with respect to green chemistry due to the ease of catalyst separation from the final reaction mixture, and in many cases the ability to regenerate and reuse the catalyst throughout many reaction cycles.36 MOFs have been studied extensively and show significant promise for wide-ranging catalytic applications and there are a number of comprehensive reviews on the subject.11c,37 A few representative examples of green catalytic applications employing MOFs are highlighted below.
In addition to capturing CO2 (see section 5), the catalytic conversion of captured CO2 to value-added chemicals gives an outlet for recycling the greenhouse gas.29c,38 One of the most efficient routes for converting CO2 to useful products is by the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides, generating cyclic organic carbonates that are widely used as synthetic building blocks for pharmaceuticals, and biobased polymers.39 MOFs comprised of strongly Lewis acidic metal nodes or containing Brønsted acidic sites have shown promise for this conversion, consistent with the first step of the proposed mechanism which involves acid activation of the epoxide.40 For example, the Lewis acidic Y9-based MOF, gea-MOF-1, was shown to convert various monosubstituted epoxides to cyclic carbonates using tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) as a co-catalyst under solvent-free conditions.41 Under approximately 20 atm of CO2, at 120 °C, the conversion to cyclic carbonates ranges from 85–94% after 6 hours of reaction.
The Hf6-based MOF, Hf-NU-1000, was shown to catalyze the quantitative cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide to give styrene carbonate under 1 atm of CO2 with TBAB as a co-catalyst at room temperature after 56 hours (Fig. 1).42 The high efficiency of Hf-NU-1000, compared to Zr-NU-1000, was attributed to the higher oxophilicity of Hf giving rise to more strongly Brønsted acidic –OH groups on the Hf6 compared to the Zr6 node.
 Fig. 1  The cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide to give styrene carbonate, using Hf-NU-1000 as a catalyst. Hf = teal, C = black, O = red. 
Combining Lewis and Brønsted acidity, MOF-892, a Zr6-based MOF with lower node connectivity than NU-1000 (6-connected vs. 8-connected, respectively) was found to perform the cycloaddition of CO2 to styrene oxide with 96% conversion after 16 hours at 80 °C under 1 atm of CO2 and using TBAB as a co-catalyst.43 In this example, the synergistic effects arising from the Lewis acidic Zr(IV) sites and the Brønsted acidic free –COOH groups on the MOF linkers were probed by post-synthetic methylation of the free –COOH groups on the framework linkers. In addition to the free –COOH groups arising from the 4-connected, hexatopic linker, there are also Brønsted acidic groups on the node of MOF-892 which were not post-synthetically methylated. By methylating the free –COOH groups, the conversion decreased from 96 to 83% demonstrating the importance of these linker-based Brønsted acid sites in the overall catalytic activity observed.
Another greenhouse gas that can be captured and converted catalytically to value-added chemicals is CH4. Currently, CH4 is converted to CH3OH (and light hydrocarbons such as ethylene and propylene) in multiple steps requiring high temperatures and the production of synthesis gas, a mixture of CO and H2. The development of a catalyst capable of activating CH4 for direct conversion to CH3OH and light hydrocarbons at low temperature would be advantageous from both a cost and environmental perspective. Towards this goal, copper oxide clusters were synthesized on the Zr6-nodes of NU-1000 by atomic layer deposition (ALD) in a MOF (AIM).44 The few atom clusters comprised of 15% Cu+ and 85% Cu2+ were found to directly convert CH4 to CH3OH with selectivities ranging from 45–60% after a 3 hour pretreatment with O2 at 200 °C, followed by CH4 loading for 3 hours at 150 °C, and finally steam-assisted product desorption for 2 hours at 135 °C. A mixed Fe(III)–Al(III) derivative of MIL-53, synthesized by post-synthetic cation exchange or by in situ Fe incorporation during electrochemical synthesis of MIL-53(Al), was found to convert CH4 to CH3OH (as well as methyl peroxide, formic acid and CO2) with oxygenate selectivities as high as 85% at 60 °C using hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant.45 In a different approach, a mixed-linker derivative of UiO-67 comprised of biphenyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid (bpdc) and 1,10-phenanthroline-3,8-dicarboxylic acid (phendc) was post-synthetically metalated with [Ir(COD)μ-Cl]2 to give an Ir(I) complex which spontaneously oxidizes in air to yield an Ir(III) precatalyst capable of methane activation.46 In this example methane was activated by borylation, where the 8 Å aperture size of UiO-67 leads to size selective monoborylation of methane with a yield of 16.8% for the monoborylated product and a selectivity for mono- vs. diborylated methane of 15:1. Selective conversion to monoborylated methane is important but also challenging since monofunctionalized methane is more reactive than methane itself.
A rapidly growing research theme in the field of catalysis involves the conversion of biomass, a sustainable feedstock, to value added chemicals.29b In particular, there is a focus on the development of catalysts to transform sugars into 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and levulinic acid, as well as the subsequent conversion of these platform chemicals to commodity chemicals, solvents, and fuels.29a MOFs have been studied as catalysts and catalyst supports for these biomass conversion reactions.47 A series of terephthalate-based MOFs, MIL-53(Al), MIL-101(Cr), and UiO-66(Zr), were post-synthetically modified to contain Brønsted acidic sulfonic acid groups on the MOF linkers (Fig. 2).48 The sulfonic acid functionalized MOFs were then applied as catalysts to convert fructose to HMF in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 120 °C. After 1 hour of reaction, all three post-synthetically modified MOFs demonstrated >99% conversion of fructose, with HMF yields of 90, 85 and 79% for MIL-101(Cr)-SO3H, UiO-66(Zr)-SO3H, and MIL-53(Al)-SO3H, respectively. The HMF yield was shown to correlate with the density of Brønsted acid sites in each MOF.

In another example, UiO-66(Zr)-SO3H was used as a catalyst to convert levulinic acid (and its esters) to γ-valerolactone (GVL), a compound that can be used as a green solvent, fuel additive and as a precursor to polymeric monomers and fuels.49 By increasing the amount of sulfonic acid in the MOF to give an overall acid content of 0.569 mmol g−1 (from 0.167 mmol g−1 in UiO-66), the GVL yield from methyl levulinate was optimized to 80% at 140 °C after 9 hours, a yield higher than that observed for UiO-66 (36%) and ZrO2 (6.1%) under the same conditions. The tandem catalytic mechanism proposed involves transfer hydrogenation of a levulinic ester by the Zr6 MOF node (in 2-butanol) followed by intramolecular dealcoholization by the sulfonic acid group on the MOF linker to give GVL.
Catalytic conversion of HMF to 2,5-diformylfuran, a precursor to many pharmaceuticals, fungicides, polymers and crosslinking agents, was performed using MIL-100(Fe) post-synthetically treated with ammonium fluoride.50 Using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxide (TEMPO) as a co-catalyst with NaNO2 additive to activate TEMPO, HMF was converted to DFF with 100% yield after 6 hours in an oxygen atmosphere at 75 °C in acetonitrile. The enhanced catalytic activity of MIL-100(Fe)-NH4F compared to MIL-100(Fe) was attributed to the higher surface area and pore volume of the former allowing access to the active Fe sites in the MOF catalyst. The increase in surface area and pore volume resulting from NH4F treatment is due to the removal of unreacted iron complexes and organic linkers from the as-synthesized MOF pores prior to activation.
Other MOF research areas that span green chemistry and catalysis include biocatalysis,51 solvent-free catalysis,52 designing catalysts for reactions to be performed in H2O and green solvents,53 and improving catalyst recyclability.54
3. Solar energy conversion
With the continued rise in population and concomitant industrial development and economic growth worldwide, our global energy needs are on the rise and expected to increase by 30% by 2040.55 Currently, the majority of our energy is produced from fossil fuels in the form of coal, oil, and gas.56 Not only are these energy sources non-renewable but their production and use have a significant impact on our environment.57 There is thus an unequivocal need for the production of energy from alternative, clean, safe, and sustainable sources such as solar and wind.58 Towards this goal, MOFs have been studied for potential applications in solar energy harvesting,59 conversion to electricity and fuels,14a as well as for various energy storage applications.30a,60 These processes are in line with the seventh principle of green chemistry – the use of renewable feedstocks.
Important criteria for any solar energy conversion and subsequent storage technology is the ability to absorb photons over a wide spectral range, and then transfer that energy to generate electricity, or to a catalyst for fuel generation. Broad spectrum light harvesting across the entire visible spectrum has been accomplished using MOFs by incorporating complementary chromophores in the framework, for example boron dipyrromethene (bodipy) linkers that absorb green light coupled with porphyrin linkers that absorb blue as well as some red light result in a black MOF that absorbs all visible wavelengths of light.61 In another approach, quantum dots (QDs) were tethered to the surface of a porphyrin containing MOF to enhance light harvesting between 500–650 nm, an absorption range complementary to the strong absorption of the porphyrin MOF linkers between 390–475 nm.62 In a recent example, both an annihilator and porphyrin-based sensitizer were used as structural linkers to give a Zr-based MOF capable of harvesting low energy photons and converting them to higher energy photons by triplet–triplet annihilation based upconversion,63 another common strategy employed to achieve broad-spectrum light harvesting.64 MOFs have also been studied for long-range and directional energy transfer, in part because they provide an ideal scaffold for aligning energy donor and acceptor moieties in a controlled and ordered fashion.65 Energy transfer has been studied in Zn-MOFs comprised of Ru(II) and Os(II) polypyridyl complexes,66 porphyrin-based Zn-MOFs grown using layer-by-layer deposition,67 and by using a MOF as a rigid scaffold to mimic a protein environment responsible for activating natural chromophores,68 amongst others.61,65a
MOFs have also been studied as components of various solar cell architectures. A handful of MOFs have been employed as photosensitizers in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),69 including the prototypical porphyrin-based pillared paddlewheel MOF, Zn-TCPP.70 In this example, crystals of Zn-TCPP were dropcast onto a planar TiO2 surface on indium tin oxide (ITO)/glass to give a working photoelectrode for the cell.70 Although the device shows a low efficiency of 0.0023% (compared to 0.0011% for the TiO2 control), the device preparation method employed ensures that the MOF is unequivocally acting as the ‘dye’ component. MOFs have also been incorporated in perovskite solar cells; by acting simply as a template for the synthesis of uniform perovskite quantum dots,71 as a component of the hole-transport layer to enhance light absorption and layer uniformity,72 or as a component of the electron transport layer in a device.73 In the latter example, 6 nm crystallites of the Ti-based MOF, MIL-125 (Fig. 3), were deposited on an ITO/polyethylene substrate by spin coating. The electron transport layer was completed by the deposition of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) to ensure that cracks in the MOF thin film were covered and that the lead triiodide perovskite and ITO layer did not come in direct contact. The flexible device showed a power conversion efficiency of 17.43% which is among the highest reported for a flexible, TiO2-based perovskite solar cell.73

Ti = grey, C = black, O = red. 
In addition to the development of solar cells, the conversion of solar energy to fuel is important to compensate for the intermittency of the sun. With this objective in mind, MOFs have been studied as catalysts, or catalyst supports, for water oxidation and reduction to generate hydrogen, as well as for the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water to hydrocarbons or alcohols. In an early example, the bpdc linkers of the robust Zr6-based MOF, UiO-67, were partially replaced by 2,2′-bypridine (bpy) and 2-phenylpyridine (ppy) linkers, components of a Re(I) CO2 reduction catalyst and three Ir(III) water oxidation catalysts (Fig. 4).74 The Re(I) catalyst immobilized in UiO-67 demonstrated a total turnover number (TON) for conversion of CO2 to CO of 10.9 after 20 hours of reaction, a value higher than that for the Re(I) complex (TON = 7.0 after 20 hours) suggesting that isolation and stabilization of the complex in the MOF gives an increase in overall performance. The Ir(III) water oxidation catalysts on the other hand, showed increased stability but lower efficiencies when isolated in UiO-67 with turnover frequencies ranging from 0.4 to 4.8 h−1 compared to 6.2 to 37.0 h−1 for the complexes alone. The decreased efficiency was attributed to the size selective exclusion of the sacrificial cerium ammonium nitrate oxidant from the MOF pores. Lastly, in addition to de novo synthesis of MOF-immobilized catalysts, catalysts can be incorporated into MOF linkers post-synthetically. This was demonstrated by the installation of a hydrogenase-inspired catalyst [FeFe](dcbdt)(CO)6 (dcbdt = 1,4-dicarboxybenzene-2,3-dithiolate) in UiO-66 which gave a TON of 5 after 60 min for proton reduction to hydrogen, a TON greater than that of the hydrogenase-inspired catalyst alone.75

As a consequence of the recent promising examples of MOFs utilized in solar cells and solar fuels applications, informative and in-depth review articles on various MOF-based energy applications have recently been published.14a,30a,60
4. Hydrogen storage
In addition to producing hydrogen from renewable and sustainable energy sources, hydrogen storage is key to enabling the use of hydrogen and fuel cell technologies in transportation, industrial equipment, and portable power applications (i.e. powering the so-called “hydrogen economy”).76 As a consequence, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has released targets for onboard hydrogen storage systems of 4.5 wt% or 30 g L−1 by 2020, and 5.5 wt% or 40 g L−1 by 2025 with the ultimate target of 6.5 wt% and 50 g L−1.77 These storage capacities are not only for the hydrogen storage material (i.e., the MOF or other adsorbent material component) but for the entire system including the tank, regulators, and any other necessary components. MOFs have shown significant promise as adsorbent materials for hydrogen storage,31a,78 both in terms of gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen capacity. MOF properties that have been shown to enhance gravimetric hydrogen capacity include high surface area and pore volume, interpenetration, proper activation, and the presence of open metal sites, or functional groups known to interact with hydrogen.78a,79 In terms of volumetric capacity, it has been shown that there is a topology-dependent trade-off where high surface area MOFs with high gravimetric capacity exhibit only modest volumetric hydrogen capacity,31c,80 consistent with the topology-dependent compromise between gravimetric and volumetric surface area. In the search for champion MOFs for hydrogen storage, computational screening using the Topologically Based Crystal Constructor (ToBaCCo) and grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations can be used to identify specific MOF structures with promising features for either gravimetric or volumetric hydrogen uptake (this can be applied to adsorption of other gases as well). The most favourable MOFs identified in silico can then be experimentally targeted.80,81
In the initial report demonstrating hydrogen uptake in a MOF, the archetype MOF, MOF-5, was shown to have a maximum gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 4.5 wt% at 78 K and 20 bar.82 The hydrogen uptake capacity in MOF-5 can also vary significantly depending on the method of preparation and activation used.83 The importance of proper activation was also highlighted by the record holding MOF, NU-100, which has an excess gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 9.9 wt% at 77 K and 56 bar.84 NU-100 must be activated using supercritical carbon dioxide drying (a mild form of activation) to access the maximum possible experimental surface area (6145 m2 g−1) and in turn the maximum possible gravimetric hydrogen uptake. The same is true for MOF-210, which also requires activation by supercritical carbon dioxide drying and demonstrates an excess gravimetric hydrogen capacity of 8.6 wt% at 77 K and 80 bar.85
More recently, there has been a shift in focus to studying and optimizing the volumetric hydrogen capacity of MOFs given that both gravimetric and volumetric capacities are crucial when considering the weight and size of an on-board hydrogen tank.31c,80a,86 In addition, the use of cryo-adsorption storage has been proposed by the DOE Hydrogen Storage Engineering Center of Excellence (HSECoE) where hydrogen is adsorbed at 77 K and 100 bar and then delivered via a pressure and temperature swing to 160 K and 5 bar.87 In this case, the deliverable volumetric and gravimetric hydrogen capacity under these temperature and pressure swing conditions is important, and may vary from the absolute hydrogen capacity. In a handful of MOFs studied under these hydrogen storage and delivery conditions, the highest deliverable capacity was found for NU-125 (Fig. 5) at 49 g L−1 or 8.5 wt%,86a which is higher than that of a typical compressed hydrogen gas tank (deliverable capacity, 37 g L−1).31c

5. Carbon dioxide capture
Carbon dioxide is the number one contributor to greenhouse gas emissions worldwide and over 85% of the CO2 released into our atmosphere arises from the burning of fossil fuels or industrial processes.88 The high levels of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted on a daily basis are causing a rise in surface air temperature, as well as ocean acidification, and unsettling weather patterns.89 In Canada alone, 13.5 metric tons of CO2 was emitted per capita in 2013.90 Reduction or elimination of industrial processes that emit CO2,91 in addition to the widespread implementation of alternative fuels, is thus an urgent priority.92 Although the principles of green chemistry focus on pollution prevention as opposed to remediation, our population is still heavily reliant on fossil fuels for energy production. As a consequence, the development of materials for CO2 capture and storage is an important problem that should be tackled in parallel to the reduction of CO2 emitting processes.93 Several MOFs have been studied for application in CO2 capture, storage, and release,32b,94 and a number of important developments in the field of MOF chemistry have allowed MOFs to become promising candidates for this application.32a
MOFs have been studied for various CO2 capture applications performed at different CO2 partial pressures including post-combustion, pre-combustion, oxy-fuel combustion,32b and direct air capture.94d,95 Some important structural features that can be varied to tailor a MOF for CO2 capture include the occurrence of open metal sites, control of pore sizes (including catenation), and pore functionalization (i.e., with amine functional groups known to interact with CO2).94f MOF-74 (CPO-27) (Fig. 6) has been studied extensively, both experimentally and in silico, for CO2 capture94p,96 and Mg-MOF-74 continues to be a benchmark MOF for CO2 adsorption capacity under standard conditions.97 The presence of open metal sites in MOF-74, which are Lewis acidic, allows end-on binding of CO2 throughout the internal and external surfaces of the MOF. Other prototypical MOFs with open metal sites that have been studied for CO2 capture include HKUST-1,98 MIL-100, and MIL-101.99

In addition to the use of open metal sites, the control of pore size and functionality by crystal engineering in MOFs with saturated metal sites, such as SIFSIX-1-M, SIFSIX-2-M, and SIFSIX-3-M, enables an ideal balance of kinetics and thermodynamics to achieve high CO2 uptake at low partial pressures.95b,100 SIFSIX-1-M, SIFSIX-2-M and SIFSIX-3-M are comprised of square channels lined with fluorine functional groups that interact with CO2, and the pore sizes of these structures are in the range of 3.5–13.0 Å.101 It has been shown that SIFSIX materials with smaller pore sizes give rise to stronger framework-CO2 interactions, with SIFSIX-3-Zn (pore size 3.8 Å) demonstrating the highest volumetric CO2 uptake in a MOF ever reported (55 cm3 [STP] per cm3) at CO2 concentrations less than 5%.100a,102
Functionalization of MOF pores with polar groups such as –NH2,95a,103 –OH,104 –COOH,105 and –SO3H,105a amongst others,106 has also been shown to be a viable approach to improving CO2 uptake in MOFs. The addition of these polar functional groups can be performed de novo or post-synthetically by linker exchange (i.e., solvent assisted linker exchange, SALE107 or post-synthetic ligand exchange, PSE108), linker functionalization,109 or node functionalization (i.e., solvent assisted ligand incorporation, SALI110). An –NH2 (among other nitrogen bases) containing Zn-MOF, Zn2(Atz)2(ox) comprised of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and oxalic acid linkers shows appreciable CO2 uptake at low pressures (97.5 cm3 [STP] per g at 1.2 bar).111 Due to the crystalline and ordered nature of the MOF, the NH2⋯CO2 (80% occupied) as well as oxalate⋯CO2 (50% occupied) interaction was observed by single crystal X-ray diffraction, and confirmed by periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations and GCMC simulations, demonstrating that the –NH2 functionality indeed plays an important role in CO2 adsorption.103b In an example utilizing post-synthetic functionalization to introduce polar groups into a MOF structure, the benchmark CO2 adsorbing MOF with open metal sites, Mg-MOF-74 (CPO-27) was functionalized by grafting ethylenediamine112 and N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine113 to the open metal sites in the framework. Both functionalized derivatives demonstrate improved CO2 uptake at low pressures compared to the parent framework which can be attributed to the addition of –NH2 and –NH– groups, respectively.
6. Air pollution remediation
The emission of other hazardous anthropogenic pollutants (apart from CO2) into the atmosphere is a significant threat to our environment that is causing increasing global concern.114 Toxic pollutants have accumulated in our atmosphere as a consequence of various chemical processes, most notably from the burning of fossil fuels (i.e., power plants, vehicle emissions),33c and the generation and subsequent release of toxic industrial gases.114 Some common hazardous air pollutants include NOx, SOx, H2S, NH3, CO, as well as volatile organic compounds (VOCs),33a and organic nitrogen or sulfur containing compounds.33c Several MOFs have been studied experimentally and computationally115 for the removal and/or degradation of hazardous air pollutants owing to their permanent porosity, and structural tunability that can aid with selectivity. The mechanism of pollutant capture or adsorption in MOFs can vary and includes hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonding, acid–base interactions, electrostatic interactions, and π–π stacking.33c
Although typically studied in the context of removal from natural gas or crude petroleum mixtures, H2S capture has been explored using a variety of different MOFs and similar structural design rules may be applicable to H2S capture from air at lower pressures.116 Features common to many of the adsorbents reported include open metal sites and the presence of H-bonding donor–acceptor groups.114 The first MOFs studied experimentally for H2S capture include MIL-47(V), MIL-53(Al, Cr, Fe), MIL-100(Cr), and MIL-101(Cr), which have structures with varying pore sizes and flexibility.117 The large pore MOFs (MIL-100 and MIL-101) adsorb a significant quantity of H2S (16.7 and 38.4 mmol g−1 at 20 bar, respectively), however the adsorption is only partially reversible which is attributed to strong interactions between H2S and the framework, and/or partial framework collapse. The small pore MOFs (MIL-47 and MIL-53(Cr)) also show appreciable H2S uptake (14.7 and 13.1 mmol g−1 at 16 bar), which is reversible. Interestingly, the rigid structure of MIL-47 remains unchanged during the adsorption process while the flexible structure of MIL-53(Cr) demonstrates breathing behavior with a narrow pore (NP) version of the framework existing at low pressure and a larger pore (LP) form existing at higher pressures.118 This breathing behavior is manifested in the H2S adsorption isotherm where two distinct steps are observed. The adsorption mechanism of H2S in MIL-47 and MIL-53(Cr) is attributed to hydrogen bonding where H2S acts as a hydrogen donor to interact with μ2-O or as a hydrogen acceptor to interact with μ2-OH on the MOF nodes.118 In a more recent example, several soc-MOF analogues (In3+, Fe3+ and Ga3+) were studied for H2S adsorption, and Ga-soc-MOF showed a high capacity for H2S (5.5 mmol g−1 at 4 bar) as well as high stability and tolerance towards the acidic gas.101b Similar to other MOFs studied for this application,119 the high affinity (and selectivity over CH4 and CO2) is attributed to the accessible open metal sites in the nodes of the structure.
A benchmark study was performed to determine the uptake and selective capture of SO2, CO, Cl2, NH3, CH2Cl2, ethylene oxide, and benzene in a series of isoreticular Cu(II) and Zn(II)-based MOFs.96a The uptake in each of the MOFs studied, MOF-5(Zn), IRMOF-3(Zn), MOF-177(Zn), IRMOF-62(Zn), MOF-199(Cu) (HKUST-1), and MOF-74(Zn) (CPO-27), was compared to that of activated carbon, and correlated to MOF properties such as BET area, pore diameter, and chemical functionality. The most apparent structure–property relationship is observed for the MOFs containing open metal sites such as MOF-199(Cu) (HKUST-1) (Fig. 7) and MOF-74(Zn) (CPO-27) (Fig. 6 shows Mg derivative), which are found to outperform activated carbon for NH3 adsorption by 59 and 62 times, and for SO2 adsorption by 59 and 6 times, respectively. In a later study the Cu(II)-analogue of MOF-74(CPO-27) was demonstrated to have a high volumetric capacity for NH3 at atmospheric pressure owing to interactions between open Cu(II) sites and NH3, in combination with the high density of Cu(II) sites in the framework (compared, for example, to MOF-199(Cu) (HKUST-1)).120 It is important to note that the structures of MOF-199(Cu) (HKUST-1)121 and MOF-74 (CPO-27)120 have been found to degrade following NH3 capture (especially under humid conditions), but that adsorbents which structurally degrade can still be of significant interest for one-time-use filters.

A series of functionalized Zr-UiO-66 derivatives were also studied for ammonia capture applications, including UiO-66, UiO-66-NO2, UiO-66-NH2, UiO-66-OH, UiO-66-(OH)2, UiO-66-SO3H, and UiO-66-(COOH)2 (Fig. 8).33b Although the MOFs with –SO3H and –COOH functionalities may be expected to adsorb more NH3, it was determined that these bulky functional groups block the apertures of UiO-66 and also lead to difficulties with activation (i.e., the maximum attainable surface area for the MOF cannot be achieved). Instead, UiO-66-OH (5.7 mmol g−1 dry, 2.8 mmol g−1 wet) and UiO-66-NH2 (3.6 mmol g−1 dry and 3.0 mmol g−1 wet) were found to have the highest NH3 adsorption capacity attributed to hydrogen bonding between the –OH, –NH2 functional groups and NH3.33b,122

7. Water pollution remediation
Contaminated water has negative effects on both human and wildlife populations all around the world. In developing countries, 70% of industrial waste and more than 90% of sewage is discharged into surface water.123 In developed countries, the majority of water pollution arises from agricultural activities, industry, poorly treated municipal waste, vehicle emissions, and acid rain.124 In addition to minimizing the activities that give rise to these water pollutants (a principle of green chemistry), we must develop methods for mending our already contaminated water sources. In general, pollutants can be categorized as organic or inorganic, and MOFs have been studied for the removal of pollutants with wide-ranging chemical structures spanning both categories.12c,34c Whether capturing heavy metals,12b oxyanions/cations,12a pharmaceuticals and personal care products,125 or dyes126 from water, some common design features emerge for successful MOF adsorbents. Of these, the most important feature is undoubtedly the stability of the MOF itself in water, while other key features include, the presence of open metal sites, functional groups capable of hydrogen bonding, and charged components for ion-exchange.
Zr6-Based MOFs are excellent candidates for deployment in wastewater remediation owing to their impressive water stability over a wide pH range.127 The first example of UO22+ removal from water using a MOF adsorbent was accomplished with a diethoxyphosphorylurea-functionalized Zr-UiO-68 derivative.128 The UO22+ adsorption (217 mg g−1) was attributed to interactions between the cation and the carbonyl and/or phosphoryl oxygen on the diethoxyphosphorylurea groups appended to the structural organic linker of the framework. The Zr6-based MOF, NU-1000, which contains 8-connected Zr6 cluster nodes (as opposed to the 12-connected nodes in UiO-66, UiO-67, and UiO-68), has been demonstrated to capture oxyanions including selenate (85 mg g−1), selenite (95 mg g−1),129 perrhenate (210 mg g−1), pertechnetate,130 sulfate (56 mg g−1),131 and antimonate (260 mg g−1)132 from water through substitution of terminal –OH groups on the nodes (Fig. 9). In addition to ligand and node based adsorption mechanisms in Zr6-based MOFs, perrhenate (a surrogate for pertechnetate, a component of nuclear waste) was captured (159 mg g−1) in UiO-66-NH2 by an ion exchange approach where the MOF linkers were protonated using HCl to give UiO-66-NH3+Cl− and perrhenate anions subsequently exchange with Cl−.133 Some node-based capture cannot be ruled out in this example since the sample of UiO-66-NH2 likely contains some missing linker and node defects.134

The water stable, large cage MOFs MIL-100 and MIL-101 have been studied for the adsorptive removal of various contaminants from water.135 In one example, the linkers of Cr-MIL-101 were functionalized with –OH, –NO2 and –NH2 to test the effects of these groups on the uptake of naproxen, a common pharmaceutical (a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug sold under trade names such as Aleve®), from water. The maximum adsorption capacity for naproxen in MIL-101-NH2 (147 mg g−1) and MIL-101-OH (185 mg g−1) was higher than that of parent MIL-101 (114 mg g−1) and MIL-101-NO2 (66 mg g−1), which was attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions between the –OH and –NH2 functional groups and the carbonyl and ether oxygen atoms in naproxen.
In a recent example, the water stable MOF, Fe-MIL-100 was functionalized with polydopamine (PDA), a polymer containing both amine and catechol groups which are capable of interacting with metal ions.34a The composite demonstrated record-breaking adsorption of Pb2+ and Hg2+ cations with maximum adsorption capacities of 394 and 1634 mg g−1, respectively. Although most of the adsorption was attributed to the cations interacting with PDA, by using the MOF as a support, the hydrophilic polymer could be easily separated from the mixture after water treatment.
8. Conclusions and outlook
Our environment is consistently changing, and now, more than ever, we are aware of the damage we have done to our planet and the importance of mitigating that damage before it's too late. In addition to minimizing our carbon footprint and being conscious about waste generation in our daily lives, as scientists, we can work towards implementing the twelve principles of green chemistry in both research and industrial laboratories.
MOFs have shown great promise as green materials, from synthesis to application, however there are still many challenges that lie ahead. Several MOFs studied and highlighted in this article are synthesized in high boiling point, hazardous solvents, and it can be challenging, especially when performing exploratory syntheses, to find green synthetic conditions that work as well as traditional methods. In terms of green applications, there are always challenges associated with materials commercialization such as scaling up syntheses, large scale activation/processing, formulation, and cost. However, the first commercial MOF products were revealed last year,136,137 demonstrating that many of these challenges can be overcome.
The field of MOF chemistry is rapidly growing and evolving through conquering tough challenges, and the future of MOF synthesis and application is green and bright.
