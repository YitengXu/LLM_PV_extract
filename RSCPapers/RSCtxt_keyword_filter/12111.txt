    , Accepted 31st July 2021First published on 2nd August 2021AbstractA polymer-based hole-transporting layer (HTL) with a tunable work function and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) position was demonstrated to effectively optimize the anode junctions of optoelectronic devices. Herein, the perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) was utilized to realize the synthesis of a well-dispersed poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT) colloid solution, which could be subsequently cast into an efficient HTL. According to the time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, a uniform, interpenetrating PEDOT network with a deep-lying HOMO position could be obtained in the PEDOT:PFI layer. For solar cells, since a deep-lying HOMO position of the HTL was favorable for minimizing the hole injection barrier, a superior organic photovoltaic efficiency of 15.1% and a perovskite solar cell efficiency of 17.8% were achieved. As for organic photodetectors, a deep-lying HOMO position of the HTL was able to reduce the dark current density (JD) by blocking the leakage current under a reverse bias. Utilizing the PEDOT:PFI with an optimized PFI content, an extremely low JD of 6.2 nA cm−2 with an external quantum efficiency of 67% at 1000 nm wavelength was achieved, which sets a benchmark for the emerging near infrared sensing technologies.
Introduction
Printed electronic technologies have attracted broad research attention because the solution-based printing process has many advantages over the conventional vacuum deposition, including low energy consumption, low capital expenditure, and the ease of high-throughput manufacturing.1,2 In the past, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was widely utilized as a hole-transporting or anode buffering layer in organic optoelectronic devices due to its unique electrical properties and high optical transparency.3–7 PEDOT:PSS can be synthesized with various ratios of PEDOT and PSS components, which results in different electronic characteristics of the resultant films. Careful adjustment of the colloid conformation of PEDOT:PSS may further change its conductivity and energy level for different functions,8–10 such as hole transporting layers (HTL) or transparent electrodes. Among the material innovations in various optoelectronic technologies, the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) of the wide-bandgap conjugated polymer and small-bandgap nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) has enabled high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of organic photovoltaics (OPVs).11–13 A wide-bandgap polymer requires a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level to maximize the open circuit voltage (Voc) of OPV devices.14–20 The deep HOMO level of the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) layer hence can induce a huge energy barrier for hole injection from the PEDOT:PSS HTL to the BHJ layer,21 resulting in poor carrier transport in OPVs. Similar issues have been observed in other optoelectronic devices, e.g. organic photodetectors (OPD)22 and perovskite solar cells (PSCs).23,24 Nowadays, only a few studies have demonstrated high-efficiency optoelectronic devices using solution-processed HTLs with fine-tuned energy levels.25,26 To address this issue, it is crucial to develop an effective methodology that enables the energy level engineering of HTL materials.
A few approaches have been reported to adjust the energy level of PEDOT:PSS, including addition of additives and solvent treatments.27–32 Additionally, transition metal oxide doping is also an effective method to adjust the energy level of the HTL.21,33,34 Compared with the pristine PEDOT:PSS, tungsten oxide or vanadium oxide doped PEDOT:PSS not only shows a good ink dispersity but also the modified energy level aligns well with the HOMO of the BHJ layer in a high-performance OPV device. Another approach was demonstrated by Lin et al., using transition metal disulfides as HTLs in NF-based OPVs.35 The HTLs comprising transition metal disulfides are found to exhibit a deep HOMO that consistently yields OPVs with a superior PCE and lower series resistance than those obtained from the device using the pristine PEDOT:PSS HTL. In addition, mixing PEDOT:PSS and the perfluorinated ionomer (PFI) is also recognized as an effective approach to achieve a deep HTL HOMO.36–38 The PFI is a perfluorinated polymer containing the fluorocarbon backbone and perfluorovinyl ether branch with sulfonic acid end groups. In push–pull molecular designs, fluorine is typically used due to its high electro-negativity, which results in excellent proton conductivity and exceptional chemical stability.36 Unfortunately, since the PFI is a stronger acid than PSS, it can donate protons to the PSS segment and reduce the coulombic interaction between PSS and PEDOT, which will result in PSS segregation. Besides, the highly hydrophobic fluorocarbon backbone of the PFI polymer will significantly limit the dispersity of the PEDOT:PSS:PFI mixture in aqueous solvents. According to our experience, if the PEDOT:PSS:PFI ink was left standing for a while, the viscosity of the ink would be significantly increased due to aggregation of the PEDOT segment and it would cause the uniformity issue during the coating process.36–39 Herein, we modified a simple method to optimize the energy level of the PEDOT-based HTL without complicated formulations. By replacing the PSS segment with a PFI-based polymer, a well-dispersed PEDOT:PFI colloid solution could be obtained. Similar to the PEDOT:PSS colloid, the oppositely-charged PEDOT and PFI segments provide electrostatic attraction that stabilizes the PEDOT:PFI colloid. More importantly, we demonstrated that the energy level of the PEDOT:PFI film could be readily engineered by adjusting the PFI content. A systematic ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis showed that given PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PFI both possessed a high work function that facilitated hole extraction, only PEDOT:PFI possessed a deep-lying HOMO level that eliminated the hole injection barrier at the anode interface. As a result, the PEDOT:PFI HTL significantly outperformed the PEDOT:PSS HTL in OPV devices. In addition, a benchmark-setting EQE response of the OPD device was also enabled by the PEDOT:PFI HTL. The device performances demonstrated herein confirmed the general applicability of PEDOT:PFI in optoelectronic devices.
Results and discussion
The synthesis procedure of the PEDOT:PFI colloid is shown in Fig. 1a. Both the used EDOT and PFI were commercially available. After the polymerization of EDOT, the PEDOT:PFI colloid was synthesized. The FTIR spectrum (Fig. S1, ESI†) acquired from the PEDOT:PFI colloid shows the characteristic absorption peaks of CC and C–F bonding at 1636 cm−1, 1529 cm−1 and 1218 cm−1, confirming the presence of PEDOT and PFI functional groups in the colloid. The reaction product was subsequently filtered to remove the large colloidal particles so a clear colloid solution could be obtained. As shown in Fig. 1b, the reaction time, which was highly correlated with the degree of polymerization of the PEDOT segment, strongly affected the UV-vis absorbance and the ink viscosity. For the short reaction times of 15 min and 30 minutes, the polymerization yielded a PEDOT:PFI solution with an absorbance of 0.07 and 0.124 at 850 nm wavelength and an ink viscosity of 1.44 and 2.63 cps, respectively. After a centrifugation step, the ink solution remained clear and there were no observable aggregates in solutions. The PEDOT:PFI thin films cast using these solutions were compact and uniform as shown in Fig. 1c. On the other hand, an extended reaction time would significantly increase the UV-vis absorbance and the ink viscosity. For PEDOT:PFI colloids synthesized using 60 min and 120 min reaction time, the absorbance at 850 nm wavelength was 0.229 and 0.276; and the ink viscosities were 7.13 and 7.52 cps, respectively. In addition, a significant amount of PEDOT:PFI aggregates could be observed in both solutions after the centrifugation step. The aggregated colloid particles would result in a rough film as shown in Fig. 1c. In short, with a well-controlled reaction time, we demonstrated a simple synthetic approach that enabled solution-based fabrication of the PEDOT:PFI film, which is compatible with thin-film electronic manufacturing.

The bottom images are captured with an optical microscope to show the film-forming quality of the deposited PEDOT:PFI films. 
Since the optical transmittance of a HTL has a great impact on the performance of an optoelectronic device, a comparison was made to evaluate the PEDOT:PFI film as a HTL. As shown in Fig. S2, (ESI†) the PEDOT:PFI film possessed a higher transmittance than that obtained from the commercially available PEDOT:PSS film in the entire spectrum range. Herein, because the synthesized PEDOT:PFI colloid had a 1:15 weight ratio of PEDOT and PFI, the higher transmittance of the PEDOT:PFI film was attributed to the perfluorinated polymer segment since it has been demonstrated to enhance the transparency of polymer films.40 The high perfluorinated polymer content in the PEDOT:PFI film is verified by the XPS analysis. As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), the dominant F and the prevailed sulfate signal deduced from the XPS spectra suggest that the PEDOT:PFI film is enriched with the PFI segment, which will benefit its transparency. However, it was worth mentioning that the high surface energy resulting from the perfluorinated polymer also made it challenging to deposit a uniform PEDOT:PFI thin film on the substrate. Herein, the synthesized PEDOT:PFI colloid ink was subsequently diluted with 2-propanol to increase its affinity with the substrate. The diluted PEDOT:PFI colloid solution could be easily wetted onto both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces, such as indium tin oxide (ITO) and photoactive BHJ layers. To unveil the compositional morphology of the PEDOT:PFI film deposited on the ITO and BHJ layers, the three dimensional (3D) component distribution of the film was identified using time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (ToF-SIMS). By comparing the top-view (Fig. 2a and b) and bottom-view (Fig. 2c and d) 3D images, a higher PEDOT concentration could be observed near the bottom interface regardless of the substrate material whereas the PFI component was uniformly distributed throughout the entire film, as verified by the ToF-SIMS depth profiles as well (Fig. S4, ESI†). The mild vertical phase separation was driven by the surface energy reduction while forming a PFI-rich surface. The PFI-rich surface could subsequently contribute to the deep-lying HOMO of the PEDOT:PFI film,37,38 which will be discussed in detail in the following content. As for the BHJ morphology of the PEDOT:PFI film, given that the PFI content was much higher than the PEDOT content, a uniform, interpenetrating network that facilitates carrier transportation could still be formulated without serious phase segregation, as verified by the solely presented PEDOT and PFI 3D images (Fig. S5, ESI†). Combined with the high transmittance, the interpenetrating PEDOT:PFI morphology identified on the ITO and BHJ surface suggested that the PEDOT:PFI film could be utilized in both the conventional and inverted devices.9,21

C6H5O2S− and CF− signals were validated and chosen as the characteristic peaks to draw the PEDOT and PFI distribution, respectively. Each ToF-SIMS image was acquired from a 50 μm × 50 μm area. 
The thermally evaporated MoO3 HTL was commonly utilized in state-of-the-art OPV and OPD devices41–47 because the energy level of MoO3 facilitates efficient hole transport at the anode interface. For the solution-processed PEDOT:PSS HTL, its energy level does not match the deep-lying HOMO levels of novel polymer donors, so a hole transportation energy barrier would form at the anode interface.21 Herein, performances of OPV devices utilizing MoO3, PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PFI HTLs were compared. To test the universal applicability of the HTL, devices utilizing different polymer donor materials, i.e., PV2001, PV-D4610 and PV2300, were fabricated. The J–V characteristics of the OPV devices are presented in Fig. 3a–c and all the performance metrics are summarized in Table 1. It is clear that the OPV devices utilizing the MoO3 HTL showed high performances regardless of the donor material. PCE values of 8.11%, 7.59, and 15.8% were achieved when the photoactive layer was composed of PV2001:PCBM, PV-D4610:PCBM, and PV2300:PV-A3:PCBM (abbreviated as PV-X Plus in the following discussion48), respectively. For OPV devices utilizing the PEDOT:PSS HTL, PCE values of 7.85% and 7.39% were obtained from the PV2001:PCBM and PV-D4610:PCBM devices. These values were comparable to those obtained from the MoO3 devices. However, a significantly decreased PCE value was observed for the PV-X Plus device. With deteriorated performance metrics, i.e. a Voc of 0.76 V, a Jsc of 20.8 mA cm−2, and a FF of 61.6%, a low PCE value of 9.74% was obtained from the PV-X Plus device utilizing the PEDOT:PSS HTL. This result was consistent with a previous study, where the poor device performance was attributed to the energy level misalignment between the PEDOT:PSS and the donor material.21 As for the PEDOT:PFI HTL, it slightly outperformed the MoO3 HTL in the PV2001:PCBM and PV-D4610:PCBM devices, resulting in PCE values of 8.13% and 7.61%, respectively. More importantly, the PV-X plus device utilizing the PEDOT:PFI HTL reached a high PCE of 15.1%, and its device stability has also been proved in our previous report.48 The comparable performances of the PV-X Plus devices suggested a great potential of replacing the MoO3 HTL and realizing an all solution-processed state-of-the-art OPV device.

The interest in OPD technology has also grown tremendously in the past few years due to its tunable optical and electrical properties that enable an improved dynamic range in low-light environments.49,50 Additionally, OPD can be fabricated on readout chips via solution processes, which greatly enhance the cost effectiveness because the costly ultrahigh-vacuum and thermal deposition steps can be removed. To demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing a solution-processed HTL in a OPD device, devices utilizing MoO3, PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PFI as HTLs were compared. Fig. 4a and b present the J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the OPD devices, which had a device structure of glass/ITO/aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO)/PD2001:ND1000 BHJ layer/HTL/Ag. As shown in Fig. 4a, a clear rectifying characteristic of the OPD device could be obtained regardless of the HTL material. However, the dark current density (JD) was found to be higher for the OPD device utilizing the PEDOT:PSS HTL. For the OPD devices utilizing the MoO3 and PEDOT:PFI HTL, significantly suppressed JD values of 2.8 nA cm−2 and 3.6 nA cm−2 could be achieved under a reverse bias of −2 V, respectively. As a result, high detection efficiencies were enabled by the MoO3 and PEDOT:PFI HTL only, as verified by the high EQE values ranging from 400–700 nm (Fig. 4b). For the OPD device utilizing the PEDOT:PSS HTL, the EQE spectrum was not shown because the high JD value resulting from the significant leakage current has disqualified for sensor application.

Near infrared (NIR) sensors are an essential technology for many applications, e.g., vein scanners50,51 and plus oximetry.52 A high-efficiency NIR detection usually depends on the utilization of epitaxial semiconductors, such as Ge53 and InGaAsP54 that require a high processing temperature for the crystal growth and a complicated transferring and bonding process. As a result, the costly manufacturing prohibits its widespread applications. Recently, a highly efficient NIR absorption with tunable absorption characteristics was demonstrated by modifying the molecular structure of the solution-processed organic semiconductor.55,56 Herein, we investigated the promising scenario of cost effective, high-efficiency NIR OPD devices fabricated via solution-based processes. Fig. 4c and d show the J–V characteristics and EQE spectra of the NIR OPD devices. The devices utilized the PD2001:PD-A2 BHJ layer as the NIR absorber and MoO3, PEDOT:PSS, and PEDOT:PFI as the HTL materials. For the control device utilizing the thermally evaporated MoO3 HTL, a low JD of 3.7 nA cm−2 could be obtained under a −2 V bias and a high EQE of 65.7% at 940 nm wavelength could be achieved. However, if the MoO3 HTL was replaced by the PEDOT:PSS HTL, a significantly deteriorated JD of 510 nA cm−2 was observed. Although a better JD of 31 nA cm−2 could be achieved by applying the PEDOT:PFI HTL, it was still higher than that resulted from the MoO3 HTL. Therefore, modifications that help suppress the JD value under a reverse bias were required. We found out when the PEDOT:PFI content was adjusted from 1:15 to 1:30, a greatly reduced JD of 6.2 nA cm−2 could be obtained (Fig. 4c). According to Fig. 4d, the PEDOT:PFI (1:30) HTL led to a EQE value higher than that resulted from the MoO3 HTL in the NIR region (i.e. 900–1000 nm wavelength). To the best of our knowledge, the 67% EQE value at 1000 nm wavelength was one of the highest values ever reported for the emerging NIR OPDs. Herein, the promising NIR EQE response has set a figure of merit benchmark for the NIR sensing technology.
To identify the mechanism that governs the OPV and OPD performance, a systematic ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) analysis was conducted to verify the energy levels of the HTL (PEDOT:PSS, PEDOT:PFI), donor (PV2001, PV-D4610, PV2300, and PD2001), acceptor (ND1000 and PD-A2) and electron transporting layer (ETL) materials. Fig. 5a and b show the acquired UPS spectra and the corresponding energy level diagrams are illustrated in Fig. 5c. All the UPS metrics essential for determining the energy levels are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The term “HOMO off-set”, which was defined as the distance between the HOMO position and the Fermi level, was labeled in the energy level diagrams to describe the energy barrier for hole transport. According to the UPS analysis, a high work function value of 5.56 and 5.21 eV could be obtained from the PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL, respectively. While the HOMO position of PEDOT:PSS (−5.64 eV) was very close to the Fermi level, a deep HOMO position (i.e., a large HOMO off-set) of PEDOT:PFI (1:15) was identified at −5.95 eV in the diagram. Fig. 5d illustrates the energy level diagrams of the HTL/donor junctions of the OPV devices operated under the short-circuit condition, i.e. the applied external bias (Vapp) was zero. Under the short-circuit condition, the spontaneous alignment of Fermi levels would create band bending at the semiconductor interface. Since PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PFI (1:15) both possessed a work function higher than those of the donor materials, the band bending near the anode junction interface would result in an electric field pointing from the donor to the HTL. An electrical force was therefore imposed upon the free hole carriers near the junction, driving them to drift towards the anode electrode.57,58 As a result, efficient hole collection could be achieved by all the HTL/donor junctions under the short-circuit condition, as verified by the high Jsc values of all the OPV devices.

Ag and Au films deposited on Si wafer were used as the reference samples to calibrate the Fermi level position.

Although efficient hole extraction was enabled by the high work function values of the HTLs, the difference between the HOMO positions might still create a hole injection barrier that impaired carrier transportation. Fig. 5e illustrates the energy level diagrams of the HTL/donor junctions of the OPVs operated under the flat-band condition (i.e. the Vapp was approximately equal to Voc), where the build-in electric field was totally compensated by the external bias. To achieve an ideal diode J–V characteristic, namely a high fill factor (FF) of the OPV device, the hole injection barrier must be avoided at the anode interface. By definition, a hole injection barrier will occur if the HOMO off-set of the HTL is smaller than that of the donor. In other words, a high HOMO off-set of the HTL is crucial for eliminating hole injection barriers near the anode interface.59,60 For the PEDOT:PSS HTL, the extremely small HOMO off-set of 0.08 eV inevitably led to a large hole injection barrier of 0.38, 0.17, and 0.66 eV for the PV2001:PCBM, PV-D4610:PCBM, and PV-X Plus device, respectively. On the other hand, the 0.74 eV HOMO off-set of the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL was large enough to avoid the formation of a hole injection barrier at the HTL/donor interfaces. As a result, all the Voc and FF values obtained from the OPV devices utilizing the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL were higher than those utilizing the PEDOT:PSS HTL, especially for the PV-X Plus device. According to the UPS analysis and energy level diagrams, we verified that the superior OPV performances originated from the deep-lying HOMO position. The remarkable HOMO off-set (0.74 eV) of the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL suggested that it can effectively eliminate the hole injection barrier in the state-of-the-art OPV device that utilizes a novel donor material with a deep-lying HOMO level.
The engineered HOMO position of the PEDOT:PFI HTL could also contribute to the significantly reduced JD, which is crucial for realizing a high detection sensitivity of the OPD and NIR OPD devices.45 Since the carrier concentration of the BHJ layer was extremely low in a dark environment, the leakage current injected from the electrode was the main cause of a high JD value.61 When the PEDOT:PSS HTL was used in the NIR OPD device, the extremely small HOMO off-set of the PEDOT:PSS HTL was not able to block the leakage hole carrier from the BHJ layer. A transportation path for the leakage carrier was therefore formed in the device, as illustrated in Fig. 5f. A significant carrier-blocking energy barrier would be created at the HTL/BHJ interface if the PEDOT:PSS HTL was replaced by the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL, which led to a remarkably reduced JD of the NIR OPD device as shown in Fig. 4c. Unfortunately, the 0.74 eV HOMO off-set of the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL was not deep enough to effectively block the leakage hole carrier coming from the PD-A2 acceptor, as verified by the higher JD compared to the control device that utilized the MoO3 HTL. To effectively block the leakage carrier, we must apply the PEDOT:PFI (1:30) HTL, which possessed a large HOMO off-set of 1.08 eV. It is worth mentioning that, according to Fig. 4a, the PD2001:ND1000 OPD device did not require the PEDOT:PFI (1:30) HTL to block the leakage current. We ascribed the difference to the large HOMO off-set of the ND1000 acceptor, which was capable of blocking the leakage carrier coming from the AZO ETL, as illustrated in Fig. 5g. Accordingly, the HTL only needed to terminate the leakage carrier coming from the PD2001 donor, and that could be achieved simply by applying the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL. According to the UPS analysis and energy level diagrams, the significantly suppressed JD of the NIR OPD device was enabled by the deep-lying HOMO position of the PEDOT:PFI (1:30) HTL via effective blocking of the leakage carrier. In brief, when comparing with the PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS:PFI formulations,36–39 the PEDOT:PFI HTL shows the most promising potential as summarized in Table 2. Additionally, the simple oxidative polymerization demonstrated herein sheds light on the development of easy-to-scale organic materials for optoelectronic devices.

In the past decades, a huge progress has been made in the PSC technology in terms of the device efficiency.62,63 To fully realize its potential, PSCs must be fabricated via solution-based processing. As one of the most commonly used HTL materials in the OPV technology, PEDOT:PSS is also widely utilized in p–i–n PSC devices. Herein, PSCs with the glass/ITO/HTL/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM/C60/BCP (bathocuproine)/Ag p–i–n device structure were fabricated to investigate the possibility of utilizing the PEDOT:PFI HTL in a PSC. Firstly, the PEDOT:PFI HTL is found to be easily coated onto the hydrophilic ITO surface from its water:2-propanol mixed solution. Contact angle measurements show that the as-cast PEDOT:PFI film is much more hydrophobic than the PEDOT:PSS film due to the perfluorinated chains, which leads to a significant increase in the contact angle from 10.2° to 107° (Fig. S6, ESI†). Surface topographies of the bare ITO and HTL-coated ITO substrates were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S7a,† the rugged topography suggested a nano-structured ITO surface with a root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) of 3.38 nm. When the ITO surface was covered by the HTLs, the RRMS value was found to be reduced to 1.69 nm (Fig. S7b†) and 1.98 nm (Fig. S7c†) for the PEDOT:PSS HTL and the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL, respectively. The planarized anode interface was favorable for reducing the surface defect and suppressing the leakage current of an optoelectronic device.
According to the J–V curves shown in Fig. S8,† an 18.3% efficiency could be achieved from the control PSC utilizing the PEDOT:PSS HTL. The Voc, Jsc, and FF of the control device were 1.00 V, 23.9 mA cm−2, and 76.5%, respectively. As for the PSC utilizing the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL, a comparable PCE value of 17.8% could be obtained, and the Voc, Jsc, and FF values were 1.02 V, 24.1 mA cm−2, and 72.2%, respectively. In principle, the deep-lying HOMO level of PEDOT:PFI should benefit the energy level alignment at the anode interface. Unfortunately, the PFI segment is found to be slightly dissolved in the perovskite precursor solution due to the strong electron-withdrawing fluoride group that leads to a strong interaction between the PFI segment and the solvents (N,N-dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide). Apparently, adopting other solvent systems or utilizing vacuum-deposition techniques to fabricate perovskite layers is necessary to address the dissolution issue. Nevertheless, the comparable PSC performances demonstrated here suggest that the PEDOT:PFI colloid is also a promising HTL material for the rapidly developing PSC technology.
Conclusions
In summary, a solution-processed PEDOT:PFI HTL obtained by a synthetic approach was demonstrated to outperform the generally used PEDOT:PSS HTL in optoelectronic devices. After a careful optimization of the synthetic parameter, a uniform PEDOT:PFI HTL with a high transmittance could be deposited on the ITO and organic BHJ layer, indicating that the PEDOT:PFI HTL could be introduced into both the conventional and inverted devices. More importantly, the work function and the HOMO position of the PEDOT:PFI HTL could be readily engineered by adjusting the PFI content, which enabled optimization of the energy level alignment at the anode interface. For OPVs, the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL led to superior device performances because of its large HOMO off-set that effectively eliminated the hole injection barrier. As a result, an improved Voc and FF value could be obtained from the OPV device utilizing the PEDOT:PFI (1:15) HTL. For photo sensing technologies, we demonstrated clear rectifying characteristics and high EQE values of OPD devices utilizing the PEDOT:PFI HTLs. According to the UPS analysis and energy level diagrams, the HOMO off-set of the PEDOT:PFI HTL could be effectively engineered by adjusting the PFI content, resulting in effective blocking of the leakage carrier. Utilizing the PEDOT:PFI (1:30) HTL, we demonstrated a promising NIR OPD EQE value of 67% at 1000 nm wavelength. Finally, the applicability of the PEDOT:PFI HTL in a high-efficiency PSC was verified. The easily engineered energy level of the PEDOT:PFI colloid was verified to effectively optimize the energy level alignment in the optoelectronic device. Combined with its ease of fabrication, we believe that the versatile PEDOT:PFI colloid will play a crucial role in realizing practical uses of high-performance optoelectronic devices.
Experimental section
The materials, PV2001, PV-D4610, PV2300, PD2001, PV-A3, and PD-A2, were produced by Raynergy Tek Incorporation. The fullerene derivative was purchased from Solenne BV. ITO coated glass substrates (11 Ω sq−1) were provided by AimCore Technology and patterned by Global Tech International. The AZO nanoparticle dispersion (N-21X) was purchased from Avantama AG. The other chemicals used in this paper were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.
3,4-Ethylene dioxythiophene (EDOT) was first purified by distillation, yielding a clear colorless liquid. Then, EDOT (50 mg, 0.352 mmol) and PFI (3.0 g, 25 wt% in water) were transferred into 10 mL deionized water with stirring at room temperature for 10 min. Subsequently, Na2S2O8 (110 mg, 0.462 mmol) with 3 mL deionized water were added in one portion into the reaction flask with stirring at room temperature for 10 min, and 0.05 mL of the catalyst solution, Fe2(SO4)3 hydrate was added and afterwards the reaction flask was closed with a glass stopper. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 15–120 min at 25 °C. The solution was transferred into ion exchange resin and stirred for 3 hours for removing the catalysts. Finally, the solution was filtered through the filtration apparatus and a dark blue liquid (PEDOT:PFI) was obtained.
Lead iodide beads (PbI2, 99.999%), MACl, MABr, PCBM and C60 for PSC device fabrication were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized based on a previous report.64 and DMF (99.8%), DMSO (99.9%), and 2-propanol (99.5%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The FT-IR spectra were acquired using a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 FT-IR Spectrometer. UV-Vis absorption spectra were measured using a Hitachi U-3900 spectrometer. The XPS spectra were acquired using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe (ULVAC-PHI, Japan) system. A micro-focused monochromatic Al Kα X-ray was utilized as the X-ray source to generate the characteristic photoelectrons. During the XPS measurements, low-energy electron and Ar+ flooding were applied to the sample surface to compensate the surface charge. The surface topography unveiled by the AFM image was acquired using a Bruker Dimension Icon. All the AFM images were captured in tapping mode.
All the ToF-SIMS depth profiles and 3D images were acquired using a PHI TRIFT V nanoTOF (ULVAC-PHI, Japan) system utilizing a dual beam slice-and-view scheme. During the data acquisition, a pulsed C60+ ion beam (∼8200 Hz pulse frequency and ∼15 ns pulse length) was used as the primary ion beam. The acceleration voltage of the C60+ primary ion was 20 kV and the beam current was 0.15 nA-DC. All the ToF-SIMS results were acquired by rastering the C60+ primary ion beam over a 50 μm × 50 μm area with an incident angle of 42°. The secondary ions were accelerated by a pulsed 3 kV sample bias. 10 V electron flooding and 10 V Ar+ flooding were applied to compensate the surface charge. During the sputtering phase, Wein-filtered Ar-GCIB (model 06-2100, ULVAC-PHI, Japan) was used to generate Ar2500+ cluster ions as the etching source. The acceleration voltage of the Ar2500+ ion was 10 kV and the beam current was 5 nA-DC. The sputtering ion beam was rastered over a 2000 μm × 2000 μm area with an incident angle of 50°.
For UPS measurements, the He I photon with a photon energy of 21.2 eV was generated by a discharge lamp and used as the ultraviolet radiation source. All the UPS spectra were acquired under a sample bias of −10 V and thermally evaporated Ag and Au films deposited on Si wafer were used as the reference samples to calibrate the Fermi level position. The work function of the investigated material was determined by subtracting the photon energy (21.2 eV) with the UPS cut-off energy. The HOMO position of the investigated material was determined by subtracting the width of the acquired UPS spectrum (cut-off energy minus on-set energy) with the photon energy (21.2 eV).
The OPV devices were fabricated by spin-coating the ZnO solution on top of the pre-cleaned ITO glass, and then heated at 120 °C for 10 min. The photoactive blend was deposited on top of the ZnO to form a BHJ layer. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 120 °C in a glove box for 5 min. Finally, the HTLs were deposited by thermal evaporation (8 nm thick MoO3) or solution coating (∼60 nm thick solution-based HTL deposited by blade coating) and the Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of approximately 10−7 torr. The active area of the cell was 0.04 cm2, as defined by the shadow mask.
The OPD devices were fabricated by a procedure similar to that of the OPV devices. A spin coated AZO layer was deposited on top of the pre-cleaned ITO glass and subsequently heated at 120 °C for 10 min. The photoactive blend was deposited on top of the AZO to form a BHJ layer. Then the samples were annealed at 120 °C in a glove box for 5 min. Finally, the HTLs were deposited by thermal evaporation (8 nm thick MoO3) or solution coating (∼40 nm thick solution-based HTL deposited by blade coating, and note that each cell was isolated carefully by scraping) and the Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of approximately 10−7 torr. The active area of the cell was 0.054 cm2, as defined by the shadow mask.
The PSC was fabricated by the following procedure: indium tin oxide having the sheet resistance <10 Ω sq−1 was washed through sonication, one time with detergent water and ethyl alcohol for 20 min and three times with deionized water for 30 min, and finally dried with N2 gas. The ITO substrates were treated with UV–ozone for 25 min to remove the organic contaminants and also to make the hydrophilic surface. The PEDOT-based HTL was spin coated on ITO with 7000 rpm and annealed at 150 °C for 10 min. The substrates were transferred to a glove box to fabricate the perovskite layer. Here we have followed the inter-diffusion method to get the better crystallization perovskite layer.65 A hot solution of 1.3 M PbI2 (DMF:DMSO = 9.2:0.8) was spin coated on PEDOT:PSS with 2500 rpm and annealed at 100 °C for 5 minutes. A hot solution of MAI:MABr:MACl (72 mg:4 mg:4 mg in IPA in 1 mL + 7 μL DMF) was coated on PbI2 with 2500 rpm and annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. For deposition of the fullerene ETL, the PCBM (20 mg/1 mL CB) precursor was spin coated and annealed at 100 °C for 40 min. Finally, 20 nm C60, 8 nm BCP and 100 nm of Ag layers were deposited sequentially through thermal evaporation. The effective area of the cells is 0.1 cm2. Note: all the deposition processes were conducted in a glove box.

J–V characteristics of the devices were acquired using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit. The solar cell performances were collected under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum created by a 150 W solar simulator (SAN-EI XES-40S1). A 100 mW cm−2 light intensity was calibrated using a pre-calibrated Si-based reference cell covered by a KG5 filter. The EQE spectrum was measured using an Enlitech QE-R spectrometer. The film thickness of each layer was determined with a KLA Tencor P-6 profilometer.
