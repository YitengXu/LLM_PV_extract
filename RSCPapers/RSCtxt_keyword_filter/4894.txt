        Pt-like electrocatalytic activity of MoN, WN, and Fe2N for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is demonstrated in this work. Among the transition metal nitrides, MoN has superior electrocatalytic activity and a higher photovoltaic performance. This work presents a new approach for developing low-cost and highly-efficient counter electrodes for DSSCs.

Broader context
Solar cells can convert solar energy directly into electric power, which is obviously beneficial to both the development of energy resources and protection of the environment. Compared with commercially available silicon-based solar cells and thin-film solar cells, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are a potential cost-effective alternative due to their low fabrication cost, environmental compatibility, and simple fabrication process. It is expected that DSSCs will successfully enter a commercial phase in the near future. However, if DSSCs are applied on a large scale, the conventional counter electrode material in the devices, platinum, will bring serious supply and cost problems because of its rarity and uneven distribution across the world. Therefore, it is vitally important to develop a low-cost and highly-efficient platinum alternative. Herein, we demonstrate the electrochemical performance of transition metal nitrides as counter electrode materials for replacing platinum in DSSCs. It is believed that molybdenum nitride and tungsten nitride have great potential to achieve comparable performance with platinum. Moreover, transition metal nitrides can easily be prepared and have at least a 95 percent cost reduction.


Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as energy conversion devices are being actively developed in recent years. High efficiency and low cost are ongoing concerns for the future application of DSSCs.1,2 To reduce the cost of the devices, it is necessary to seek low-cost and highly-efficient materials to replace the conventional and expensive Pt counter electrode.3,4 It is well known that an ideal counter electrode material must possess superior electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide ions in electrolyte, which is the rate determining step for electron transfer from the counter electrode to the electrolyte.4,5 Some carbonaceous materials and cobalt sulfide displayed Pt-like function as counter electrode, though it was still difficult to reach the performance of the Pt electrode.6–12 In our previous work, TiN nanotube arrays and TiN nanoparticles supported on carbon nanotubes demonstrated high electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide ions in DSSCs.13,14 In addition, surface-nitrided nickel also showed a dramatic improvement on electrocatalytic activity as compared with metal nickel.15 According to a knowledge of a similarity of the electronic structure of transition metal nitrides to that of the noble metals,16 it can be expected that many early transition metal nitrides are able to provide Pt-like electrocatalytic properties. Therefore, an investigation of the electrocatalytic activity of transition metal nitrides is highly significant not only for inspiring scientific curiosity, but also for finding low-cost alternatives for Pt in DSSCs.
In this communication, some typical transition metal nitrides, prepared by the nitridation of the metal oxide precursors in an ammonia atmosphere (see ESI†), are evaluated as counter electrode materials in DSSCs. In particular, their intrinsic electrocatalytic performances are analyzed. This work should provide valuable support for developing a new class of counter electrode materials for low-cost DSSCs.
The XRD patterns show that the as-prepared transition metal nitrides are indexed to hexagonal MoN and Fe2N, and cubic WN, respectively, since the diffraction peaks are well-matched with the corresponding JCPDS data (Fig. 1). No peaks of other metal nitride or oxide species can be observed in the XRD patterns, indicating a high purity of the final products. The diffraction peaks of Fe2N are relatively sharp compared with those of MoN and WN, suggesting the formation of large grain sizes. TEM images of the as-prepared transition metal nitrides are given in Fig. 2. Fe2N presents oval-shaped grains with a size of about 100 nm, identical to the XRD analysis. MoN exists as sphere-like aggregates with a diameter of about 200 nm, which are composed of nanosized grains. WN shows irregular grains with an average size of 20–30 nm.

Fig. 3 presents current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of the DSSCs using transition metal nitrides and Pt as counter electrodes. The detailed photovoltaic parameters from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 1. In the test, the DSSC with the MoN counter electrode has a noticeable photovoltaic performance in fill factor (FF, 0.66), which is higher than that of the Pt electrode. Moreover, the short circuit current density (Jsc) of 11.55 mA cm−2 is a relatively high value, and the open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.735 V is very close to 0.740 V from the Pt electrode. In the case of WN, Voc and Jsc are relatively low, indicating a low η of 3.67%. In the DSSC with the Fe2N electrode, Voc (0.535 V) and FF (0.41) are much lower, resulting in a poor η (2.65%). Therefore, the DSSC using MoN shows the highest conversion efficiency (η, 5.57%) among those metal nitrides as counter electrode materials.

In general, the bulk transition metal nitrides as counter electrode materials for DSSCs show similar functions to Pt. However, the actual photovoltaic performance is consequentially dependent upon the intrinsic electrochemical features of the metal nitrides. To get insight into the electrochemical activity of the transition metal nitrides, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the symmetric configurations made by the metal nitrides are measured and illustrated in Fig. 4. In the Nyquist plots, the high-frequency semicircle is related to the charge-transfer process at the electrolyte/electrode interface.17 In the symmetric cell, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct), evaluated from the high-frequency semicircle, reflects the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode materials for the reduction of triiodide ions. Here, the simulated charge-transfer resistances of MoN and WN electrodes are 0.8 Ω and 1.1 Ω, respectively, much lower than that of the Pt electrode (6.9 Ω), highlighting the superior electrocatalytic activity of MoN and WN electrodes for the reduction of triiodide ions. The superior electrocatalytic activity provides a crucial precondition for replacing the Pt electrode with the metal nitride electrodes in DSSCs. In regard to the Fe2N electrode, the electrocatalytic activity is lower according to its large charge-transfer resistance (Rct). Apart from the charge-transfer resistance, the impedance derived from the mass-transfer process must be taken into account to evaluate the electrode reaction. In the Nyquist plots, the low-frequency semicircle for the Pt electrode is assigned to the Nernst diffusion process of the triiodide ions,8,14,18 and the diffusion impedance is 7.2 Ω. In the case of the metal nitride electrodes, the loop in the mid- and low-frequency can not be fitted with a single semicircle. It is noted that the typical reaction process of the triiodide/iodide redox couple at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface follows three stages: the diffusion, adsorption and charge-transfer on the counter electrode surface.19–21 Moreover, both iodine and triiodide are adsorbed but only the adsorbed iodine is electroactive, which is highly dependent on the surface sites available.20 Therefore, it is more reasonable that two reaction processes are involved in the loop in the mid- and low-frequency regions. The mid-frequency semicircle for metal nitride electrodes is associated with the adsorption of iodine and triiodide on the electrode surface with large active areas, while the low-frequency semicircle is attributed to the Nernst diffusion process of triiodide in a thin layer. The equivalent circuit used is given in the ESI,† and the simulated data from the EIS spectra are summarized in Table 2. Clearly, the adsorption impedance of MoN is lower than that of the other metal nitrides, probably due to it having more surface sites for the adsorption of electroactive iodine. In particular, the Nernst diffusion impedance (Zw2) is dominant in the total impedance for the metal nitride electrodes. The diffusion impedance for the MoN electrode is lower, while diffusion impedance for the Fe2N electrode is larger by about 6 fold than that for MoN (after taking account of actual active areas). Undeniably, the Pt electrode does show a competitive dominance over the metal nitride electrodes, based only on the diffusion impedance, which is a main reason for the best photovoltaic performance of DSSCs with a Pt counter electrode.

Different from the Pt electrode, the metal nitride electrodes exist as a porous film on FTO glass with a thickness of about 13 μm (see ESI†), and their electrode active areas are relatively large compared with that of the Pt electrode. Table 2 summarizes the electrode active areas measured by the method reported.22 The MoN electrode has the largest active area of 1.15 cm2 based on the same apparent area of 0.25 cm2. The active area of the WN electrode is 0.85 cm2, while that of the Fe2N electrode is only 0.45 cm2. The large active area of the MoN and WN electrodes is mainly attributed to their small grains as shown in the TEM images. Taking account of their actual electrode active areas, the integrated interface charge-transfer resistance (Ω cm2) can further illuminate the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity of the nitride materials. The obtained integrated interface charge-transfer resistances (Ω cm2) of these active materials display the following order: MoN ∼ WN < Pt < Fe2N. Obviously, the electrocatalytic activities of MoN and WN are higher in the practical system. These results raise the prospect that MoN and WN as counter electrode materials can provide a comparable photovoltaic performance in DSSCs, even exceeding Pt, if the diffusion impedance is decreased by a suitable preparation strategy, such as metal nitrides supported on carbon nanotubes.14 Meanwhile, the series resistances are almost identical for all counter electrodes, which are mainly related to the conductivity of the electrolyte and FTO substrate, and the film thickness of the counter electrodes. The series resistances can be further decreased by reducing the film thickness of the porous metal nitride electrode, which is important for improving the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs.23
In analyzing the intrinsic electrochemical features of the metal nitrides as shown above, it is evident how to further develop metal nitrides as counter electrode materials for DSSCs. Here, MoN provides superior electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide ions and a large active area, leading to a comparable photovoltaic performance with a high fill factor and open voltage in the J–V measurement. To further improve the electrochemical performance, one should focus on increasing ion conduction of the MoN by fabricating an orderly microstructure and by surface modification to decrease the diffusion impedance and improve the short circuit current density in DSSCs.13 The intrinsic electrochemical features of WN are similar to those of MoN, except for the larger diffusion impedance, which results in the relatively low fill factor and open voltage. Thus, the optimization of WN preparation is necessary for its use as a counter electrode material. Large Fe2N particles, just like TiN particles,14 show a huge mass-transfer impedance and a serious electrochemical polarization. Therefore, the improvement of ion and electron conductivity, by fabricating an ion and electron transfer network as in the case of TiN,14 is a preferred approach to available Fe2N counter electrode material.
In summary, this communication reports that transition metal nitrides, MoN, WN and Fe2N, prepared by the nitridation of metal oxide precursors in an ammonia atmosphere, have inspiring Pt-like electrocatalytic activity as counter electrode materials for DSSCs. In particular, MoN and WN as counter electrodes show lower interface charge-transfer resistances, and relatively large active areas. By preparation optimization of the metal nitrides to reduce diffusion impedance, it is expected to develop available transition metal nitrides as counter electrode materials to replace expensive Pt in DSSCs.
