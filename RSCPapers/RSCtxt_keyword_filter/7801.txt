    , Accepted 6th March 2023First published on 7th March 2023AbstractVanadium-based materials are a potential class of cathode materials for aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs). However, the low intrinsic conductivity, sluggish kinetics, and poor cycling stability are the key factors hindering their further application. Herein, we report a high-capacity and stable ZIB system based on an amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode and Zn@ZnMoO4 anode. The amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode was achieved by chemical oxidation of V2CTx in a CO2 atmosphere and subsequent in situ electrochemical oxidation at high potential (∼1.5–1.8 V vs. Zn/Zn2+) in a living cell. First-principles calculations indicate that the low Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier in amorphous V2O5 is the key factor for acquiring high Zn-storage performance. And the continuous formation of Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O (ZVO) with a high Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier on the cathode surface during the charging and discharging process is the culprit for the capacity decay. To ensure stable Zn-storage performance, the formation mechanism of the ZVO was investigated through various ex situ analyses. It was verified that the corrosion reaction of the bare Zn anode promoted the formation of ZVO. By optimizing the bare Zn anode to a reported hydrogen-suppressed Zn@ZnMoO4 anode, the assembled amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn@ZnMoO4 battery can simultaneously achieve high capacity (643.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1), excellent rate performance (302.4 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1) and outstanding cycle stability. In addition, there is also solid evidence confirming the conventional co-intercalation/de-intercalation charge storage mechanism of H+ and Zn2+ in the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode. This work not only reports a high-performance ZIB cathode material but also provides an explanation for the capacity decay of vanadium-based materials during cycling.
Introduction
The use of large-scale energy storage systems to further store renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind energy, is a key factor in achieving carbon neutrality.1–3 Aqueous Zn-ion batteries (ZIBs) have attracted extensive attention in recent years due to their high safety, low cost, and environmental friendliness and are considered as an ideal alternative to lithium-ion batteries.4–8 With metal Zn with a high theoretical capacity (820 mA h g−1) as the anode, the critical factor is the lack of a satisfactory cathode to efficiently accommodate zinc ions.9,10 Based on the intercalation or conversion mechanism, the reported cathode materials are mainly manganese oxides,11,12 vanadium oxides,13 and Prussian blue analogs.14 Among them, vanadium-based materials with multiple oxidation states, low price, and high theoretical specific capacity have been widely studied as cathode materials for ZIBs. Despite these advantages, one of the main problems hindering the practical use of vanadium oxide cathodes is their poor cycling stability. An accepted and effective strategy is the pre-insertion of guest cations (e.g., H+, Ca2+, Al3+, etc.) or H2O molecules as “pillars” into the parent structure to improve their structural stability.15 Nevertheless, the introduced guest cation not only reduces the oxidation state of the parent cation but also increases the molecular mass of the cathode, thus reducing the theoretical capacity and the theoretical energy density of the cathode material.
In addition, most reported vanadium-based cathodes are synthesized by hydrothermal or annealing methods, and the products usually have high crystallinity.16–20 The intercalation/deintercalation of Zn2+ in the crystal framework can only proceed along specific routes and is stored in certain active sites, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics and insufficient specific capacity. And the specific capacity decays rapidly due to the collapse of the rigid crystal framework caused by “volume expansion” during repeated Zn2+ intercalation. In contrast, the amorphous framework not only provides isotropic ion diffusion pathways and abundant zinc-storage sites, but the open framework effectively mitigates the “volume expansion” and provides low internal energy and excellent structural stability.21,22 Besides, due to the low intrinsic conductivity of vanadium oxide, the design of high-performance cathodes requires consideration of a suitable conductive substrate to accelerate electron transport. The availability of a new two-dimensional material, V2CTx MXene, provides an opportunity to develop such high-performance ZIB cathodes.23–26 Specifically, at the molecular level, the unique V–C–V structure endows V2CTx MXene with ultra-high conductivity (∼104 S cm−1), which is beneficial to fast electron transfer during charging and discharging. The vanadium oxides derived from V2CTx MXene with an two-dimensional layered structure that provides an abundance of active sites to accommodate more zinc ions. In addition, the oxidizable nature of V2CTx MXene facilitates the preparation of its derivatives.27,28 As can be expected, in situ synthesis of amorphous vanadium oxide on the surface of V2CTx while intentionally preserving its internal conductive V–C–V two-dimensional structure is a rational way to acquire cathodes with high Zn-storage performance.
In this work, for integrating the advantages of V2CTx and amorphous V2O5, we propose a stepwise oxidation strategy to achieve the preparation of an amorphous V2O5@V2CTx composite cathode. The cathode was obtained by chemical oxidation of V2CTx in a CO2 atmosphere and subsequent in situ electrochemical oxidation in a living cell. The ingenious combination between amorphous V2O5 and V2CTx MXene not only provides abundant Zn-storage sites but also ensures a high Zn-ion migration rate for the cathode material. As a result, the prepared amorphous V2O5@V2CTx composites exhibit ultra-high specific capacity. Notably, electrochemical measurements and material characterization provide direct evidence for the electrochemical oxidation of M-phase VO2 to amorphous hydrated V2O5 at high voltages (∼1.5–1.8 V vs. Zn/Zn2+). First-principles calculations show that the formation of the zinc pyrophosphate (ZVO) phase is the culprit for capacity decay. The mechanism of ZVO formation was explored, and it was confirmed that the formation of ZVO is closely related to the corrosion reaction of bare Zn anodes. By optimizing the bare Zn anode to a reported hydrogen-suppressed Zn@ZnMoO4 anode, the assembled ZIBs exhibit high specific capacity, high-rate performance, and high stability.
Results and discussion
The synthesis process of the VO2(M)@V2CTx cathodes is shown in Scheme 1. This facile synthesis strategy involves chemical etching of the AlV2C MAX and a subsequent surface oxidation process at the desired temperature (400, 600, and 800 °C). First, the Al layer was chemically etched with HF solution to obtain the multi-layered V2CTx MXene with an accordion-like structure. Subsequently, a surface oxidation strategy was applied to V2CTx MXene in a CO2 atmosphere. During annealing, CO2 acts as a mild oxidant to react with the surface V atoms of V2CTx MXene to produce VO2(M)@V2CTx nanohybrids. The inner layers of V2CTx MXene are intentionally preserved and used as conductive frameworks to enhance the conductivity of the nanohybrid materials. For comparison, V2CTx was completely oxidized by increasing the annealing temperature to 800 °C to provide pure VO2(M).
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram for the synthesis of VO2(M)@V2CTX cathodes. 
The morphologies and micro-nanostructures of the as-prepared materials were first confirmed by SEM and TEM analysis. The SEM image (Fig. S1a†) shows the typical accordion-like structure of the V2CTx MXene, where a smooth surface can be observed in the layered structure.29 After oxidation, the layered structure with open architectures is well retained in VO2(M)@V2CTx-400, VO2(M)@V2CTx-600, and VO2(M)@V2CTx-800, indicating that the structure of the V2CTx precursor is not destroyed during the oxidation process (Fig. 1a–c). The observed dense nanoparticles confirmed the formation of new phases on the surface of the V2CTx precursor. Note that the diameter of these particles increases gradually with increasing temperature, which is additionally verified by the TEM analysis (Fig. 1d–f). The smaller particle size of VO2(M)@V2CTx-400 indicates that the V2CTx precursor is slightly oxidized, while the larger particle size of VO2(M)@V2CTx-800 suggests that the V2CTx precursor is almost completely oxidized, which prominently reduces the electrical conductivity resulting in unsatisfied ion transport rate. In contrast, VO2(M)@V2CTx-600 with optimized components not only possesses good electrical conductivity, but the stable contact between V2CTx MXene and VO2(M) ensures the mechanical stability of the electrode in the electrochemical reaction. HR-TEM images of these particles (Fig. 1g–i) show the lattice fringes spacings of 0.230, and 0.320 nm, corresponding to the (111) and (011) planes of VO2(M). Moreover, SEM elemental mapping images (Fig. S2†) show that V and O elements are homogeneously distributed on the accordion-like structure of the VO2(M)@V2CTx-600.

The crystal structure, composition, and element valence state of the as-prepared V2CTx MXene and VO2(M)@V2CTx materials are analyzed by XRD and XPS measurements. As shown in Fig. S1b,† weak diffraction peaks located at around 11.2° appeared after chemical etching, which is assigned to the (002) plane of V2CTX MXene. The peaks at 13.5° and 41.5° show a significant decrease in intensity, indicating the presence of the unetched V2AlC MAX phase, which appears in almost all V2CTx MXenes synthesized by HF etching.30,31 After oxidation (Fig. 2a), some new peaks appeared that are in good agreement with the M phase of VO2 (JCPDS No. 44-0252). At the same time, the (002) peak corresponding to V2CTx MXene becomes indiscernible, which is consistent with the reported Mxene-based composites.32–34 XPS analysis was used to explore the valence transitions of the prepared materials before and after oxidation. Focus on the V 2p spectra of V2CTx MXene (Fig. S3†), the peaks located at 513.6 and 521.5 eV, and 514.9 and 522.4 eV, and 516.1 and 523.8 eV correspond to the V 2p3/2 and V2p1/2 orbitals of V2+, V3+, V4+.24 After oxidation (Fig. 2b), the V2+ and V3+ peak intensities of VO2(M)@V2CTx-400 and VO2(M)@V2CTx-600 were significantly reduced, while they disappeared completely in VO2(M)@V2CTx-800. The valence transitions as well as the XRD and TEM results indicate that VO2(M)@V2CTx nanohybrids are successfully obtained through the oxidation of V2CTx MXene. The in situ electrochemical oxidation process, as a critical step, was investigated by electrochemical measurements and material characterization in detail. The electrochemical oxidation of VO2(M)@V2CTx cathodes was evaluated by GCD tests with the potential window of 0.2–1.8 V (vs. Zn/Zn2+) in a living battery. This process includes a pre-discharge state from open-circuit voltage to 0.2 V, followed by charging to 1.8 V at the current density of 0.1 A g−1. Due to the low oxidative activity of the vanadium element and insufficient active sites in VO2(M), the as-synthesized VO2(M)@V2CTx cathodes show low discharge capacity of 285.4, 351.2, and 186.1 mA h g−1 for VO2(M)@V2CTx-400, VO2(M)@V2CTx-600, and VO2(M)@V2CTx-800, respectively (Fig. S4a, b† and 3a). The low charge capacity in the first charge at around 1.5 V further demonstrates the poor Zn-storage performance of VO2(M)@V2CTx cathodes. Subsequently, there is a long charging plateau of 1.5–1.8 V, which cannot be caused by the deintercalation of zinc ions in the VO2(M)@V2CTx cathode. After the 1st cycle, the discharge capacity of these cathodes increased significantly, which is obviously closely related to the long charge plateau. Besides, the first CV cycle (Fig. 3b) is quite different from the following cycles, and the high-intensity oxidation peak located at around 1.6 V further indicates that an irreversible phase transformation occurred during the first CV cycle.35,36 In order to uncover the secret behind the long charging platform, the representative product VO2(M)@V2CTx-600 with the largest discharge capacity was selected for a detailed study. The transformation of the VO2(M)@V2CTx-600 cathode was first confirmed by XRD measurements at the desired voltage. As shown in Fig. 3c, the VO2(M)@V2CTx-600 cathode maintained its initial pattern after pre-discharging to 0.2 V and charging to 1.4 V, suggesting the phase reversibility of the electrode within 0.2 to 1.4 V. Interestingly, after experiencing the long charging plateau, a crystalline to amorphous phase transition was detected, which was further demonstrated by TEM analysis (Fig. S5†). The morphology evolution of the electrode from crystalline to amorphous was observed by SEM. As shown in Fig. 3d–g, the accordion-like structure is still maintained during the electrochemical oxidation process, but the VO2(M) nanoparticles gradually disappear as the voltage increases. Clear lattice fringes were detected in the TEM analysis of the 1st discharge to 0.2 V, while the undetected lattice fringes and broad diffusion rings after charging to 1.8 V confirmed the amorphous structure of the electrochemical oxidation products (Fig. S5a–d†). XPS analysis was used to obtain the chemical composition and element state change of the electrode during the electrochemically induced phase transition process. As observed in the V 2p spectra (Fig. 3h–k), there are three pairs of peaks appearing in the range of 510–527 eV after discharging to 0.2 V and charging to 1.4 V, which correspond to V2+ (513.6 and 521.5 eV), V3+ (514.9 and 522.4 eV), and V4+ (516.7 and 523.8 eV).25,37 The peak intensity of V4+ dominates in the cathodes at the 1st discharge to 0.2 V and charge to 1.4 V states, indicating a reversible V4+/V3+ redox reaction in the potential window of 0.2–1.4 V. When charged to 1.6 and 1.8 V, the V5+ peak appears and dominates, while the V2+ and V3+ peaks disappear and the intensity of the V4+ peak decreases significantly, demonstrating the transition of VO2(M) to higher valence vanadium oxide. The possible chemical reaction formula during the long charging platform is summarized as:38,39 H2O ↔ H+ + OH−(1) 2VO2 + xH2O + 2OH− ↔ V2O5·(x + 1)H2O + 2e−(2)Here, eqn (1) represents the dissociation of water, and the equilibrium constant of this reaction is known as the water dissociation constant (Kw), Kw = [H+] [OH−] = 10−14 (at 25 °C). Eqn (2) shows that the oxidation process comes at the expense of water and releases H+. This result was confirmed by the pH changes of the electrolyte (from 4.5 to 3.6). To further verify the important role of water dissociation in the phase transition, the electrolyte was replaced with 2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 in acetonitrile and cycled at 0.2–1.8 V (Fig. S6a†). The long charging platform was not observed in the first ten cycles, and the XRD diffraction peaks of VO2(M) remained well after 100 cycles (Fig. S5b†), indicating that no phase transition occurred. Combining the above results, VO2(M) is eventually converted to amorphous V2O5 during the initial charging process at high voltage. Cathode materials with amorphous structures would provide more Zn-ion diffusion pathways and abundant active sites, which would facilitate faster Zn-ion migration and better electrochemical performance.40,41 The GCD test was used to explore the Zn-storage performance of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn battery. Fig. 4a shows the GCD curves during the first 50 cycles at a current density of 0.1 A g−1. It can deliver a high discharge capacity of 652.8 mA h g−1 during the first discharge, which gradually decays to 469.1 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles, corresponding to 71.9% of the initial capacity. To gain insight into the reason for the gradual capacity decay, XRD patterns were acquired at different cycling points. As shown in Fig. 4b, the amorphous structure of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode is well preserved after the first cycle; however, some new peaks at around 12.3°, 16.9°, 20.9°, 29.5°, 32.0°, and 36.5° were detected after 10 cycles, and the peak intensity of these peaks increased significantly after 50 cycles. These observed new peaks are well consistent with the zinc pyrovanadate (Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O, ZVO).42,43 The identity of the ZVO was also confirmed by the morphology evolution of the electrodes. As shown in Fig. 4c, d, f, and g, the ZVO phase is observed in both charge and discharge states after the 20th and 50th cycles. Compared with the 20th cycle, more ZVO phases can be detected at the 50th cycle, proving that the ZVO is continuously accumulated during the cycling. Furthermore, the high-intensity Zn signal in the charged state also confirms the existence of ZVO rather than Zn ions intercalated into the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathodes (Fig. 4e and h). Although the [ZnO6] layer is connected by pyrovanadate groups and forms an open framework in ZVO, it is not conducive to the diffusion of Zn2+, which will be discussed in the subsequent part. Therefore, inhibiting the formation of ZVO on the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode during cycling is a necessary factor to obtain long cycle life. According to the reported literature, the formation of ZVO involves the dissolution of vanadium pentoxide and the subsequent precipitation process, which can be summarized as:39 V2O5 + 3H2O → 2VO2(OH)−2 + 2H+(3) 2VO2(OH)−2 + 3Zn2+ + 3H2O → Zn3(OH)2V2O7·2H2O + 4H+(4)

Based on the phase diagram of V5+ at different concentrations and pH in an aqueous solution (Fig. S7†) and eqn (3) and (4), V2O5 is sensitive to pH, V5+ easily dissolves in mild acid and base aqueous solution and exists in the form of VO2(OH)2− (the blue part). Since the progress of reactions in eqn (3) and (4) is accompanied by the release of H+, that is, if only the cathode part is considered, the pH of the electrolyte gradually decreases as the reaction proceeds. When the pH value of the electrolyte is lower than a certain value (left side of the dashed line), VO2(OH)2− will not exist in the electrolyte, thus preventing the formation of ZVO. However, considering the entire battery system, the effect of the corrosion reaction of the zinc metal on the anode side on the pH value of the electrolyte cannot be ignored. Zn + 2H+ → Zn2+ + H2↑(5)
The H+ in the electrolyte is consumed by the corrosion reaction of zinc metal, which raises the pH to the region where VO2(OH)2− can be present, and promotes the formation of ZVO. In order to determine the corrosion of Zn anodes, a simple experiment was performed in which bare Zn and Zn@ZnMoO4 (a hydrogen-suppressed Zn anode reported by Zhang's group) were immersed in 2 M of Zn(CF3SO3)2, respectively (Fig. S8†).44 When immersed in 2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 solution for 30 min, a large number of H2 bubbles were observed on the bare Zn surface, in contrast to the situation with Zn@ZnMoO4 (Fig. S9†). Nevertheless, the Zn anode corrosion experiments using excess electrolyte are far from the actual battery conditions. To imitate the real conditions in the battery, a controlled experiment was used to verify the relationship between anode corrosion and ZVO formation. Here, the anode section was used as the only variable to assemble the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//without Zn anode, amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//with Zn anode, and the amorphous V2O5@//with Zn@ZnMoO4 anode batteries (Fig. S10†). After 2 weeks of standing, SEM images show that the accordion-like structure of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode did not change significantly in amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//without the Zn anode and amorphous V2O5@//with Zn@ZnMoO4 batteries (Fig. S10b and f†), and XRD patterns show that the amorphous structure was still maintained (Fig. S10a and e†). In contrast, some nanoflakes can be observed on the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode of amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//with Zn anode battery (Fig. S9d†), and the new diffraction peaks detected in the XRD patterns confirm the formation of ZVO (Fig. S10c†). The corrosion of the Zn anode breaks the balance of eqn (3) and (4), causing the reaction to move in a direction more favorable to the formation of ZVO.45 This reasonably explains the continuous capacity decay of the assembled amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn battery.
To ensure the stable Zn-storage performance of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode, the hydrogen-suppressed Zn@ZnMoO4 was chosen as the anode to prevent the accumulation of ZVO. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn@ZnMoO4 battery. Two pairs of distinct redox peaks correspond to the valence changes from V5+ to V4+ and V4+ to V3+, respectively.46,47 The high overlapping CV curves and the undecayed discharge specific capacity at different cycles confirm the reversible redox behaviours of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode (Fig. 5b). Moreover, a high-capacity retention of 97.3% is maintained after 100 cycles at a current density of 0.3 A g−1, verifying the highly reversible and durable cycling performance of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn@ZnMoO4 battery (Fig. 5c). When the current density was increased from 0.1 to 15 A g−1, the average discharge capacities were 643.8, 595.2, 533.5, 505.9, 485.8, 464.5, 435.7, 413.7, 393.9, 365.7, 350.6, and 328.4 mA h g−1, respectively. Even at a high current density of 20 A g−1, a high average discharge capacity of 302.4 mA h g−1 can still be achieved, indicating a satisfactory rate performance of the assembled battery. The gap between the discharge specific capacities of amorphous V2O5@C and amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathodes at the same current density verifies the superior performance of the V2CTx-derived cathodes (Fig. 5d). The corresponding GCD curves at different current densities more intuitively demonstrate the excellent rate capability of the assembled battery, and the voltage plateau is still visible at high current densities, showing high Zn-ion migration kinetics (Fig. 5e). In addition to the high-rate performance, it can also deliver a high discharge specific capacity of 437.1 mA h g−1 at a current density of 2 A g−1 and a stable charge/discharge for 2000 cycles, demonstrating the high-capacity and stable characteristics of the assembled battery. Such high-rate and stability performance is attributed to the synergistic effect between amorphous V2O5 and V2CTx MXene. On the one hand, the ultra-high conductivity of the V2CTx MXene substrate allows a fast distribution of current to the amorphous V2O5, which accelerates electron transport and ion diffusion, resulting in high-rate performance. On the other hand, the strong chemical connection between V2CTx MXene and amorphous V2O5 greatly enhances the structural stability of the cathode and contributes to high cycling stability. To verify the stability of the assembled amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn@ZnMoO4 battery, XRD and SEM tests were performed to detect changes in the composition and morphology of the V2O5@V2CTx cathode. As shown in Fig. S11a,† the amorphous structure of the V2O5@V2CTx cathode was well maintained after the 2000th cycle, and the diffraction peaks of ZVO were not detected. SEM images (Fig. S11b–d†) show that the layered structure of the V2O5@V2CTx cathode collapses slightly after the 2000th cycle, but the typical ZVO flakes cannot be observed. These results again verify that the formation of ZVO is the main cause of capacity decay. The satisfactory Zn-storage performance of the prepared amorphous V2O5@V2CTx exceeds that of most recently reported Zn-ion battery cathodes,21,24–26,41,48–53 and a comparison of the Zn-storage performance of the present work with the recently reported Zn-ion battery cathodes is shown in Table S1.†

CV curves were acquired at different scan rates to study the electrochemical behavior of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode. As shown in Fig. 6a, the geometric area of the CV curve gradually increases with increasing scan rate but shows a similar shape. According to the power-law equation relating peak current and scan rate: i = avb, the b values of peak1, peak2, peak3, and peak4 obtained by linear fitting of log(peak current) and log(scan rate) are 0.914, 0.828, 0.833 and 0.897, respectively. The b values of all peaks are greater than 0.5, indicating that the capacity for Zn-ion storage is dominated by a capacitance-controlled process.54,55 The calculated capacitance contributions ratios of amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode were 72.5%, 78.7%, 82.9%, 85.2%, and 87.6% at different scan rates, respectively, which were much higher than that of VO2(M)@V2CTx (Fig. S12†). The high capacitance contribution ratio of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode contributes to its high-rate performance. Galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurement was performed to evaluate the Zn2+ diffusion coefficient (DZn2+) in the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode. The calculated DZn2+ for amorphous V2O5@V2CTx is about 10−10 to 10−8 cm2 s−1, higher than that of VO2(M)@V2CTx. The high Zn2+ diffusion coefficient is attributed to the amorphous structure of V2O5 and the highly conductive V2CTx MXene substrate. On the one hand, the amorphous V2O5 possesses more Zn-storage sites and diffusion pathways, which facilitates the diffusion of Zn2+, and on the other hand, the high electrical conductivity of the MXene substrate ensures the rapid charge transfer and ionic diffusion ability. First-principles calculations show that the diffusion energy barrier of Zn2+ in the dense VO2(M) crystal framework is 0.16 eV, much higher than the 0.1 eV in amorphous V2O5 (Fig. 6f and S13a†). In ZVO (Fig. S13b†), although the [ZnO6] layer is connected by pyrovanadate groups and forms an open framework, Zn2+ is difficult to be adsorbed by the upper and lower oxygen atoms, thus exhibiting the highest Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier. This result again proves that the formation of ZVO is the culprit for the continuous capacity decay. The lower diffusion barrier indicates a faster Zn2+ diffusion rate, verifying the high Zn2+ diffusion efficiency and high capacitance contribution ratio of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode.

The satisfactory electrochemical performance of the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn@ZnMoO4 battery stimulated our interest in exploring its charge storage mechanism during the charging/discharging process. Ex situ XPS analysis was carried out to detect the valence changes of V elements at selected voltages (as marked in Fig. 7a). As shown in Fig. 7b, the V 2p shifts to a lower binding energy during the discharge process and gradually returns to its initial state in the following charging process, indicating a reversible V3+/V4+ to V4+/V5+ transition during the charging and discharging processes.56,57 Correspondingly, the intensity of the Zn 2p peak gradually increased during the discharge, verifying the continuous intercalation of Zn-ion in the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx cathode (Fig. 7c), which was further confirmed by the strong Zn signal in the SEM-mapping images (Fig. 7d). The intensity of Zn 2p decreases gradually along with charging and almost disappears in the fully charged state, indicating that almost all Zn ions are deintercalated from the cathode in the fully charged state.58,59 Furthermore, by changing the electrolyte to H2SO4 (without Zn ions) with a pH of about 4.5, the capacities of 368.3 and 188.6 mA h g−1 were still retained at current densities of 0.1 and 3 A g−1, indicating that H+ also plays an important role in charge storage (Fig. 7e and S14†). The above evidence suggests that the amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn@ZnMoO4 battery shows a conventional H+ and Zn2+ co-intercalation/deintercalation mechanism.

Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were directly used without any purification.
Synthesis of V2CTx MXene
2 g of V2AlC powder was added in portions to 50 mL of HF (40%) aqueous solution under stirring. The mixture was then kept at 55 °C for 120 h with continuous stirring. After cooling down to room temperature, the resultant slurry was centrifuged multiple times with distilled water at 5000 rpm until the pH reached 6–7. Finally, multilayered V2CTx was collected and freeze-dried for 48 h.
Synthesis of VO2(M)@V2CTx composites
VO2(M)@V2CTx composites were obtained by annealing the as-prepared V2CTx under a CO2 atmosphere at 400, 600, and 800 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 1 °C min−1. For convenience, the resulting products are denoted as VO2(M)V2CTx-400, VO2(M)V2CTx-600, and VO2(M)@V2CTx-800, respectively.
Synthesis of the VO2(M)@C composite
2 mmol of commercial V2O5, 2 mmol of glucose, and 6 mmol of C2H2O4 were dissolved in 36 mL of deionized water at 80 °C with stirring. Afterwards, 3 mL of H2O2 (30%) and 36 mL of ethylene glycol were added dropwise to the prepared homogeneous solution and stirred for another 30 min. The resulting mixed solution was then transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 20 h. After cooling to room temperature, the obtained precipitate was washed several times by centrifugation with deionized water and dried at 60 °C. Finally, the VO2(M)@C composite was produced by annealing at 350 °C in an Ar atmosphere for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1.
Synthesis of the Zn@ZnMoO4 anode
0.4 g of Na2MoO4 and 1.6 g of citric acid were dissolved in 40 mL of deionized water to form a homogeneous solution. Afterwards, 10 mL of deionized water containing 0.2 g of HNO3 (65 wt%) was added to the above solution. Zn foil was immersed in the mixed solution at 40 for 20 s. Finally, the reacted Zn foil is rinsed with distilled water and cut to a diameter of 12 mm for further use.
Electrochemical measurements
For the fabrication of the working electrode, the as-prepared VO2(M)@V2CTx or VO2(M)@C, super P, and carboxymethyl cellulose were first mixed in deionized water with a weight ratio of 8:1:1. After stirring for 30 min, the homogeneous slurry was then coated on a stainless-steel mesh with a diameter of 12 mm and vacuum dried at 60 °C overnight. The mass loading of each electrode was approximately 2 mg cm−2. The ZIBs were assembled by using the as-prepared electrode, 2 M Zn(CF3SO3)2, and glass microfiber filters as the cathode, electrolyte, and separator, respectively. The amorphous V2O5@V2CTx and amorphous V2O5@C cathodes were obtained by an in situ electrochemical oxidation strategy, where VO2(M)@V2CTx and VO2(M)@C electrodes were charged up to 1.8 V, respectively. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were recorded on a DH7003 electrochemical workstation. Galvanostatic charge–discharge curve, rate performance, cycle stability, and galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) measurements of the assembled ZIBs were acquired on a LAND battery testing system (CT2001A).
Conclusions
In summary, we reported a high-capacity and stable amorphous V2O5@V2CTx//Zn@ZnMoO4 aqueous Zn-ion battery. By optimizing the valence state of vanadium on the V2CTx surface through a stepwise oxidation method, excellent high-capacity, high-rate Zn-storage performance was successfully achieved. In such an ingenious composite, amorphous V2O5 provides an abundance of active sites and a low Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier, resulting in a high specific capacity. At the same time, the V2CTx MXene substrate provides a continuous electron transport pathway and ion diffusion channel, which ensures a fast Zn2+ transport. In addition, the use of the hydrogen-suppressed Zn anode limits the corrosion reaction and thus prevents the formation of ZVO. As a result, it can deliver a high specific capacity of 643.6 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1, a long cycle life of 2000 cycles at 2 A g−1, and a satisfactory rate performance maintained at 302.4 mA h g−1 at 20 A g−1. This work not only reported a high-capacity ZIB cathode material but also provided new insights for enhancing the cycling performance of vanadium-based cathodes.
