    , Accepted 1st April 2021First published on 2nd April 2021AbstractLuminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are large-area sunlight collectors, consisting of a waveguide embedded with fluorophores. LSCs could reduce the use of expensive silicon solar cells, thus decreasing the cost of electricity. Although great efforts have been made for fabricating high efficiency large-area LSCs, there is still a lack of knowledge of the temperature effect on the performance of the LSCs based on colloidal quantum dots (QDs) because the LSCs need to be operated in outdoor conditions. In this work, we investigated the thermal effect on the performance of the LSCs based on colloidal QDs upon sunlight irradiation under different temperatures (10–40 °C). The optical properties (e.g. quantum yield and optical efficiency) of the LSCs are strongly dependent on the operating temperature. With increasing operating temperature, the quantum yield and optical efficiency decrease significantly. Among three types of configuration, the LSC based on thin-film QDs coated on glass has the lowest temperature increase under operation, due to the higher thermal conductivity of the glass compared to the polymer matrix. Considering the real operating conditions of the LSCs, the glass-based LSCs have promising potential for future high-efficiency LSC-PV systems.
1. Introduction
With the increase of the world population, the demand for clean energy is increasing quickly.1–5 Among various types of new energy resources, solar energy has attracted lots of attention due to the concerns of environmental sustainability and global warming.6–10 Different types of solar cells have been fabricated using different semiconductors (e.g. silicon, dyes/polymers, perovskite), but the cost of electricity generated by photovoltaics (PVs) is still high or the long-term stability of the solar cell is not good.11 Luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) are large-area sunlight collectors, consisting of a waveguide embedded with fluorophores.12 The fluorophores absorb sunlight radiation and re-emit photons, which are guided by total internal reflection (TIR).13 The emissions are absorbed by the PV cells positioned at the edge of the LSCs and converted to electricity.14 Once the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the LSC-PVs is higher than 6%, the cost of the electricity generated by the LSC-PVs can be lower than that of standard PVs from silicon solar panels.15,16 Usually, the LSCs can serve as semi-transparent windows for buildings integrated with PVs, which have great potential for use in cities.6–8 In addition, the LSCs can also be used for thermal energy generation and as solar noise barriers.17,18
Recently, colloidal quantum dots (QDs) have been used as efficient sunlight converters for the application of LSCs due to their excellent opto-electronic properties, such as size/shape/dimensional tunable optical properties, wide absorption range, large Stokes shift, high quantum yield (QY) and easy wet chemical synthesis approaches.19 To date, QDs have been widely used for high-efficiency LSCs.20–22 For example, Meinardi et al. incorporated a ternary QD system into a polymer, and obtained a PCE of 3.2%.20 Typically, colloidal QDs have strong temperature dependent optical properties, including absorption/PL spectrum and QY. For instance, the QY of some QDs decreases with the increase of temperature because of thermal-induced quenching.21,23–25 Meseguer et al. found that the performance of dyes/polymer concentrators has a low efficiency recovery after the heating cycle because heating may lead to aggregation of dyes.26 As the LSCs may be used as building integrated PVs, the out-door optical efficiency and stability of the LSCs are very important, especially the optical efficiency as the LSCs are exposed to sunlight irradiations in different environmental temperatures and the properties of QDs vary at different temperatures. However, organic materials have poor thermal-conductivity [usually less than 0.4 W (m K)−1].27 The maximum absorption coefficient of fluorescent dyes is temperature-dependent and with the increase of temperature, the absorption coefficient decreases.28 When the device is in a high photo-thermal environment, the real-time heat dissipation becomes an urgent issue.29
Many groups have studied various types of approaches to improve the optical efficiency of the LSCs based on QDs, such as the configuration of the LSCs, types of QDs, selection of the waveguide (different polymers or glass) etc. For instance, in silicon-based PVs, the thermal radiation loss caused by the grid structure is only 3–5% of the incident sunlight, leading to the increase of the operation temperature of the PVs, which induces a significant decrease of the PCEs.30 Compared to a single-layer LSC, tandem structured LSCs can absorb different parts of sunlight with high absorption efficiency.31–33 A wide variety of different QDs have been used for tandem LSCs.31,32,34 Laminated LSCs can give lower energy reabsorption because of their lower geometrical factor (G, defined as the ratio of the area of the top of the LSC and the area of the edges of the LSC) compared to a single layer LSC and improved stability as the fluorophore layer is protected by the out-side layers (Fig. 1h).35 As the polymer matrix has defects inside, which can induce emission quenching, thus decreasing the optical efficiency of the LSCs, the thin-film glass based LSCs have already shown excellent properties because of the almost defect-free nature of the glass (Fig. 1i).

In addition, in the configuration of the LSCs, various types of fluorophores have been used for high-efficiency LSCs by using fluorophores with high QY and large Stokes shifts.36–40 Although many studies focused on the temperature effect on the photovoltaic systems,41–43 to the best of our knowledge, there is still a lack of detailed investigation of the thermal effect on the functional properties of the LSCs based on colloidal QDs with different LSC configurations.
In this work, we investigated the thermal effect on the performance of the LSCs. For large Stokes shift and high QYs, in this work, we selected CdSe/CdS QDs as a light converter. In detail, three kinds of configurations (QDs/polymer matrix, laminated and thin-film/glass) were selected to evaluate the temperature effect of the LSCs upon sunlight under different temperatures (10–40 °C). It is found that the optical efficiency of the LSCs is strongly dependent on the operating temperature. With the increase of temperature, all LSCs exhibit a decrease in optical efficiency, which is mainly because of the decrease of the QY. Interestingly, the LSC based on thin-film QDs coated on glass has the lowest temperature increase under operation, because of the higher thermal conductivity of the glass compared to polymers. This guarantees that the thermal heat can be dissipated to the environment in a timely manner, contributing to the elongation of the device's lifetime. Our work indicates that the glass-based LSCs represent promising potential for future LSC-PV systems.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of CdSe/CdS QDs
The CdSe/CdS QDs were synthesized by the following process.44–47 Typically, the CdSe QDs were synthesized using a hot injection approach, then a single ionic layer adsorption reaction was used to coat the CdS layer on the seed. In detail, oleylamine (5 mL), octadecene (ODE, 5 mL) and CdSe QDs (∼2 × 10−7 mol) were mixed together and pumped at 110 °C for 5 min. The temperature was increased up to and stabilized at 240 °C for the further growth of the CdS shell.
The Cd(OA)2 (0.2 M in ODE) and the S/ODE (0.2 M) were added dropwise into the mixture in sequence. The shell was further annealed for 60 min for the Cd layer and 10 min for the S layer. Thirteen cycles of CdS were coated on the core. The Cd(OA)2/S volumes for cycles 1–13 are 0.25, 0.36, 0.49, 0.63, 0.8, 0.98, 1.19, 1.41, 1.66, 1.92, 2.2, 2.5, and 2.8 mL. The mixture was cooled to 25 °C by injecting 20 mL of toluene (−20 °C). Then 50 mL of ethanol was added to the mixture and the suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed and the paste on the bottom of the tube was redispersed in toluene.
2.2 Fabrication of the LSCs based on CdSe/CdS QDs
LSCs with different structures were prepared by following our previous reports. (i) Single layer polymer/QD structure. Typically, QDs were dispersed in lauryl methacrylate (9 mL) and ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (1 mL). The mixture was pumped for 10 minutes to eliminate the oxygen. Then the clear solution was mixed with a UV initiator (diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide) (30 mg) and sonicated until a clear solution (A) was formed. The mixture was injected into a mold consisting of two glass slides separated by a rubber spacer and illuminated with a UV lamp for 2 hours. The QDs embedded in poly(lauryl methacrylate) polymer were defined as QDs/PLMA; (ii) laminated LSC, prepared by injecting solution A to the mode made by PMMA plates. The laminated LSC contains PMMA and inner QDs/PLMA matrix. The concentration of QDs in the PLMA polymer is around 1.5 wt%; (iii) thin-film LSC, which was prepared by drop-casting a QDs/PMMA toluene solution on the glass. The concentration of QDs in the polymer is around 5 wt%. The dimensions of the QDs/PLMA, QDs/PLMA–PMMA and QDs/PMMA–glass are 6.5 × 7 × 0.3 cm3, 10 × 10 × 0.7 cm3, and 10 × 10 × 0.5 cm3, respectively. The detailed information on the geometry of the LSCs is listed in Table S1 (ESI†).
2.3 Characterizations
The morphologies of the CdSe/CdS QDs were recorded using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEOL JEM 2100Plus TEM. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was used to measure the structure of the QDs. Absorption spectra were acquired using a UV-2600 ultraviolet (UV) and visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu). Photoluminescence (PL) spectra at different temperatures were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS980 instrument equipped with a temperature controller. The QYs of the QDs dispersed in toluene were measured by using Rhodamine 6G as a reference.
The density of different samples was calculated by m/V, where m is the mass of the samples measured directly by the balance and V is the volume of the samples. Thermal conductivities (λ) of glass, PLMA, PMMA, QDs/PLMA and QDs/PMMA-glass were measured using the laser-flash technique (LFA 467 HT HyperFlash, NanoFlash, Netzsch). The specific heat capacity (C) and thermal diffusivity (α) were measured using LFA 467 (the standard of ASTM–E 1461). The surface temperature of the samples was monitored using infrared thermography (FOTRIC-226-2, China). The refractive index of the glass, PLMA and PMMA was measured using a WAY-2S Albert refractometer (INEA).
2.4 Optical measurement of LSCs
The sample was placed in a temperature-controlled chamber (0–100 °C). The PL spectra of the QDs were recorded in methanol solution. The external optical efficiency (ηexternal) of different types of LSCs was measured by using a solar simulator (Newport) at AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2). The optical power meter (Newport Model 843-R) with a sensor (1 cm2, 918D-UV-OD3R) was directly coupled on one side of the LSC edges with black tape. The unattached area of the sensor was blocked by black tape. We used the attached area to calculate the output power intensity per cm2 of the LSC. For the QDs/PLMA, the power meter was attached on the edge with 7 cm. The ηexternal of the LSCs is calculated as the ratio of the output power (Pout) coming out of the edges and the input power (Pin) coming in through the top surface of the LSC. The temperature was controlled by the temperature-controlled chamber from 10 to 40 °C. For the thermal imaging measurement, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the LSCs were illuminated upon simulated sunlight (100 mW cm−2), and a high-resolution thermal camera (FOTRIC-226-2, China) was used to monitor the temperature variation under different measurement conditions (10–40 °C).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Fabrication of LSCs based on CdSe/CdS QDs
As the CdSe/CdS QDs have a very large Stokes shift and high QYs, in this work, we selected CdSe/CdS QDs as a light converter to fabricate various types of LSCs. The details for the synthesis of core/shell structured CdSe/CdS QDs were included in the Experimental section. As shown in Fig. 1a, the CdSe/CdS QDs were dispersed well in the TEM copper grid with an average size of 11.7 nm (Fig. S2, ESI†). The inset in Fig. 1b is the SAED of the QDs, indicating a Wurtzite structure of the QDs. The absorption and emission spectra of the CdSe/CdS QDs are shown in Fig. 1c. The QDs have an absorption spectrum in the range from 300 nm to 530 nm, matching well with the Sun's spectrum in the UV and visible range. The PL peak is located at 610 nm, giving a Stokes shift as high as 0.58 eV, which is larger than that of other inorganic QDs such as PbS/CdS QDs (0.15 eV), CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs (0.25 eV), and organic dyes, such as Lumogen Red 305 (0.14 eV) or Rhodamine B (0.065 eV).46,48,49 Three configurations were fabricated for comparing the optical efficiency at different operating temperatures. The detailed fabrication process is included in the Experimental section and the typical structures of the LSCs are shown in Fig. 1g–i. The as-fabricated LSCs are semi-transparent. Upon simulated sunlight, all LSCs exhibit a clear red-color on the edges of the LSCs, confirming the concentration effect of the LSCs (Fig. 1d–f). As shown in Fig. 1g, the QDs are embedded in the polymer matrix. The LSC may contain a single fluorophore or multiple fluorophores.50–52 In this work, in order to fairly compare three configurations of the LSC, we used only CdSe/CdS QDs as a single fluorophore. In order to compare the efficiency among three types of LSCs, we calculated the G factor of the investigated LSCs. In this work, the G factors are 8.3, 3.5, and 5 for the LSCs based on QDs/PLMA (thickness H, 0.3 cm), QDs/PLMA–PMMA (H, 0.7 cm) and QDs/PMMA–glass (H, 0.5 cm), respectively. Typically, a larger G factor will lead to stronger energy loss due to reabsorption. We also measured the refractive index (n) of the Glass, PLMA and PMMA, which were used as a waveguide for the LSC. Based on the measured n, we calculated the total internal reflection efficiency and reflectance (details shown in the ESI†). As shown in Table S2 (ESI†), we did not find a significant difference among the three types of waveguides.
3.2 Thermal effect on the optical efficiency of the LSCs
The ηexternal was measured by using a power meter attached to the edge of the LSCs. All LSCs were illuminated using a calibrated sunlight simulator (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) at different temperatures. Fig. 2b illustrates the ηexternal of three types of LSCs. The top-surface temperature of the LSCs was measured by the thermal infrared imager. In general, increasing the operating temperature reduces the optical efficiency. In detail, the laminated LSC based on QDs/PLMA–PMMA maintains 97.8% of its original optical efficiency (measured at 10 °C) at 20 °C, 84.8% at 30 °C and 80.4% at 40 °C. The single-layer LSC based on QDs/PLMA maintains 90% of its original optical efficiency (measured at 10 °C) at 20 °C, 82.5% at 30 °C and 72.5% at 40 °C. Thin-film LSC based on QDs/PMMA–glass maintains 88.9% of its original optical efficiency (measured at 10 °C) at 20 °C, 72.2% at 30 °C and 61.1% at 40 °C.

(c) PL spectrum of CdSe/CdS QDs dispersed in methanol solution at different temperatures. (d) Integrated PL area at different temperatures. (e) PL peak positions as a function of the measured temperature. 
As shown in Fig. 2a, we directly measured the absorption of the LSCs and also the polymer matrix or glass. For the waveguides (polymer or glass), it can only absorb around 1.8% of sunlight irradiation. With the addition of the QDs, the QDs/PLMA, QDs/PLMA–PMMA and QDs/PMMA–glass can absorb 14.6%, 13% and 12.5% of the sunlight irradiation, respectively (Fig. 2a). With the increase of temperature, the QYs of the QDs dispersed in methanol solution decrease significantly and the PL spectrum exhibits a slight red-shift (Fig. 2c–e). PL spectra recorded from the LSC are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). There is no significant change before and after embedding the QDs in the polymer film. With the increase of temperature, the ηexternal of the LSCs decreases. This indicates that the temperature-dependent QY variation is the key parameter, which could induce a strong decrease in ηexternal of the LSCs.
3.3 Thermal phenomenon and mechanism of the LSCs
We used an IR thermal camera to monitor the dynamics of temperature upon sunlight irradiation at different temperatures. The setting-up scheme for the thermal imaging measurement is included in Fig. S1 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3a–d, the temperature of the LSC (selected point as labeled in Fig. S4, ESI†) increased with the increase of illumination time first and then saturated at a certain temperature. The details for the saturation time and stable temperature of the LSCs are listed in Tables S3 and S4 (ESI†). The initial increase of temperature is due to the absorption of sunlight by the LSCs and the heat absorption rate is higher than that of heat dissipation. The temperature in the center of the LSC was heated up faster and higher than the surrounding parts of the LSC, which is consistent with the reported literature.53 The further saturation of temperature is likely because of the balance between the absorption and heat dissipation, which we will discuss later on. For all samples at either certain temperature (10–40 °C), the saturation temperature is the lowest for the LSC based on the QDs/PMMA–glass. For example, at 40 °C, upon sunlight illumination, the temperature of the LSC based on QDs/PMMA–glass was stable at 41 °C, with only a one-degree increment. In a big contrast, the temperature of the LSC based on QDs/PLMA was stable at 48 °C. Meanwhile, the temperature increase rates are different among the three types of structures of the LSCs. For instance, at an ambient temperature of 10 °C, the temperature of QDs/PLMA LSC increases by 2.46 °C min−1, while the temperature of QDs/PMMA–glass increases by only 0.98 °C per minute. At an ambient temperature of 20 °C, the temperature difference of QDs/PLMA is 10.59 °C while that of QDs/PMMA–glass is 5.15 °C when the temperature is 20 °C. This trend is clearly seen in Fig. 3e–h and more details are included in Tables S3–S6 (ESI†).

(e and f) Thermal images of LSCs based on QDs/PLMA (A), QDs/PLMA–PMMA (B), and QDs/PMMA–glass (C) at initial controlled temperatures of 10 °C (e), 20 °C (f), 30 °C (g), and 40 °C (h), at different illumination times (0 min, 5 min, 10 min, 25 min). The light intensity is 100 mW cm−2. 
In order to understand the aforementioned phenomenon relating to heat generation and heat dissipation, we measured the density (ρ) specific heat capacity (C), and thermal diffusivity (α) of the QDs/PMMA–glass, QDs/PLMA, glass, PLMA and PMMA, as listed in Table 1. Based on these data, we calculated the coefficient of thermal conductivity (λ): λ = ρ × C × α(1)The thermal conductivity of the LSC based on QDs/PMMA–glass is five-times higher than those of LSCs based on QDs/PLMA and QDs/PLMA–PMMA. The energy absorbed by the LSCs is converted into heat and light, as well as other forms of energy, such as chemical potential through a chemical reaction. In view of its complexity, we only simulated the conversion of energy between light and heat. It is assumed that all heat absorbed by the LSCs supplies the increased temperature of the LSC, without any energy exchange with the environment. Based on the following equation, we calculated the temperature difference of three types of LSCs as a function of time. Qin = Qa(2) P × S × (ηabs − ηexernal) = C × m × T(3)where Qin is the absorbed heat by the LSC and Qa is the accumulated heat that increases the temperature of the LSCs. P is input power intensity (100 mW cm−2) and S is the area of the LSC. m is the mass of the LSC, and ΔT is the temperature difference between the LSC and the ambient temperature. As shown in Fig. 4, among three LSCs, the LSC based on QDs/PLMA has the fastest heating rate and the LSC based on the QDs/PMMA–PLMA has the slowest (Table S5, ESI† and Fig. 3). The final balanced temperature of the LSCs is because of the heat dissipation, which is strongly dependent on the thermal conductivity of the samples.

As shown in Table 1, compared to polymers (PLMA or PMMA), glass has λ of 0.94, which is 4.5 times higher than that of the PLMA or PMMA. The larger λ in LSC based on glass leads to faster heat dissipation. The avoiding of heat accumulation indicates that the glass configuration represents a promising way to minimize the side-effect of temperature on the performance of the LSCs. And it is helpful for the elongation of the device's lifetime.
In order to study the effect of the temperature on the functional properties of the LSCs, we in situ measured the current density of the LSC by the attached solar cells with or without illumination. As shown in Fig. 5a–c, the temperature of the LSCs increases with continuous illumination. Once without the illumination, the temperature of the LSC started to decrease. This phenomenon is consistent with the above finding, that is the illumination supports the temperature enhancement of the LSC. Meanwhile, we found that the current density of the LSCs slightly varies as a function of the temperature. The LSC with a higher temperature exhibits a lower current density. It is worth pointing out that the current density is still reversible during the cycling of illumination and non-illumination (Fig. 5d). The experimental data is in Table S7 (ESI†).

4. Conclusion and perspectives
In summary, we demonstrate the temperature effect on the optical efficiency of the LSCs based on colloidal CdSe/CdS QDs with three configurations (single-layer, tandem structure and laminated structures) at a temperature range of 10–40 °C. The optical efficiency of the LSCs is strongly dependent on the operating temperature. With the increase of temperature, all LSCs exhibit a decrease of optical efficiency, which is mainly because of the decrease of the QYs due to thermal quenching. The LSC based on thin-film QDs/glass has the lowest temperature increase under operation, because of the high coefficient of the thermal conductivity of the glass compared to polymers. Our work indicates that the glass-based LSCs represent promising potential for future LSC-PV systems. The further research direction for the LSCs based on QDs might focus on the combination of QDs with glass with different configurations (thin-film, laminated and tandem structure). Detailed investigation should be focused on the study of the effect of glass with different thermal conductivities on the optical efficiency of the LSCs.
