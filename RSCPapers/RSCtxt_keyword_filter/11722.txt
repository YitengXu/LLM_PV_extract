    , Accepted 8th January 2018First published on 8th January 2018AbstractIn this study, we have tried to demonstrate the implications of employing nonsimilar mesoporous TiO2 templated films as interfacial blocking layers for improving the input light transmittance and photovoltaic performance of dye sensitized and perovskite solar cells. In fact, the interfacial layers were synthesized using four types of copolymers including PSA, Brij58, P123 and F127 and their impact on the performance of dye sensitized and perovskite solar cells was examined and compared with that of traditional dense blocking layers. For the first time, we used block copolymers as structure-directing agents in interfacial templated blocking films aiming at increasing the input light transmittance and efficiency of dye sensitized and perovskite solar cells. Moreover, two types of FTO substrates, 15 Ω sq−1 with high light transmission and low conductivity, and 7 Ω sq−1 with low transmittance and high conductivity, were used in order to replace FTO glasses with higher conductivity instead of 15 Ω sq−1 glasses commonly used. Our results showed that, through replacing the blocking layer templated using the P123 copolymer with dense film, the short circuit density significantly improved from 15.89 to 21.23 mA cm−2 for the dye sensitized solar cell and from 18.72 to 24.09 mA cm−2 for the perovskite solar cell due to the striking increase in light transmittance. Also, introduction of the P123 templated interfacial layer presents conversion efficiency enhancement by 33% and 16% in the dye sensitized solar cell and perovskite solar cell, respectively.
1. Introduction
Today, solar cells can be considered as a potential alternative and modern technology for utilizing solar energy with regard to the growing demand for sustainable and renewable energy sources.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are the third generation photovoltaic solar cells that were produced for the first time by Gratzel and O'Regan in 1991.2,3 A typical DSSC consists of three major components: working photoelectrode, electrolyte and counter electrode. The working photoelectrode of a DSSC is generally composed of a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate covered with a dye adsorbed nanoporous TiO2 film. This photoelectrode is separated from the counter electrode by an electrolyte solution.
The working photoelectrode has achieved a salient position in numerous research studies on dye sensitized solar cells as the greatest amount of energy loss occurs in this part of the cell.4–8 One of the main problems with these cells is the energy loss and charge recombination processes. In dye-sensitized solar cells, charge recombination processes at the interfaces between FTO and the electrolyte play an important role in limiting the photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. Thus, suppressing the backward electrons at these interfaces is one of the most important ways to improve the power-conversion efficiency of DSSCs. In this context, a number of attempts have been made to prevent the recombination processes.9–12 Using a blocking layer is one of the interesting and effective methods to address the problem of contact between the FTO surface and electrolyte. This method has been studied by many research groups, some of which include dense metal oxide thin films, such as ZnO, SnO2, TiO2 and Nb2O5 on the FTO or prevent physical contact between FTO and the electrolyte by using TiCl4.13–22 The results of these studies have shown that the presence of interfacial blocking layers can prevent the charge recombination of the populated electrons on the FTO with the electrolyte and it leads to improvement of the cell performance, especially through increasing the open circuit voltage.15
Another cause of energy loss in solar cells is low light transmittance into the photoelectrode of the cell. So, one of the strategies that enhance the performance of a cell is to increase the input light. Hence, increasing the input light into the cell can be a feasible way to enhance cell efficiency. As more photons are captured by the sensitizer, the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) is increased, which plays an important role in improving the conversion efficiency of dye sensitized solar cells.23–25 Usually for the same reason, FTO 15 ohm per square is used for the photoelectrode substrates of DSSCs because it displays higher light transmission than those which have lower sheet resistivity such as FTO 7 Ω sq−1. In fact, FTO 7 Ω sq−1 is almost opaque and that is why researchers are not usually interested in using it.
One of the novel structures that are expected to have a significant impact on the transparency is a templated mesoporous structure.24,25 The templated synthesis method is the most common way of synthesizing mesoporous compounds. Through this method, commercially available two or three block copolymers are widely used as templates and after growth of the material are removed from the inorganic framework hybrid film for creating pores.26,27 The obvious advantage of using these block copolymers is precise control of the shape and size of the pores. The type of the selected copolymer may lead to a change in pore size, mesoporous structure and as a result, different light transmittance into the photoelectrode. Results of previous studies in the literature have shown that the refractive index of TiO2 can be tuned; it can be lowered by introducing mesoscale pores into the inorganic matrix.28–30 In other words, the refractive index of the final product decreases by adding ionic surfactants or block copolymers to the sol–gel solution.28–30
Schwenzer et al. optimized the refractive indices of TiO2 by introducing Pluronic triblock copolymers (Pluronic F127 and P123) as surfactants in the sol–gel precursor. They reported that F127 and P123 as copolymers decrease the refractive indices and subsequently increase the transmission of TiO2 films.28 They also reported that the changes in the refractive index of a given TiO2 film result from a combination of variation in the size and density of the mesopores within a condensed TiO2 matrix.
Some studies on interfacial layers in DSSCs made using some copolymers such as F127 and PVC-g-POEM have been conducted.24,25 For example, Kim et al. prepared organized mesoporous TiO2 blocking films using F127 as a structure-directing agent. As a result, the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC in the presence of this interfacial layer was significantly improved from 5.77% to 7.48% at 100 mW cm−2.24 Generally, interfacial TiO2 templated thin films result in an improvement in conversion efficiency due to the increased light transmittance of visible light and better adhesion between the FTO conductive glass and the main nanocrystalline TiO2 thick film.24,25 However, few studies have been done on TiO2 templated film as an interfacial layer in DSSCs.
In 2009, the development of dye-sensitized solar cells took an unexpected turn as a result of the breakthrough efficiencies in solid-state DSSCs using perovskite-sensitization.31 The so-called perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted enormous interest in recent years due to the significant progress in conversion efficiencies.32–37 As it is known, in the perovskite solar cells, dense TiO2, ZnO and recently CdS have often been used as blocking layers.38–46 However, no study has been carried out to compare the effects of different meso-layers made by using various copolymers compared with dense blocking layers in these two types of solar cells.
In this study, we intend to synthesize new interfacial layers using four types of copolymers including PSA, Brij58, P123 and F127 and examine their impact compared with dense blocking layers on the input light transmittance and performance of dye sensitized and perovskite solar cells. In fact, two classes of copolymers were used for preparing interfacial TiO2 blocking layers: triblock copolymers including P123 and F127, and diblock copolymers such as Brij58 and PSA. We also decided to check the impact of the interfacial templated blocking layers on the efficiency of perovskite solar cells for the first time. It is worth mentioning that the P123, PSA and Brij58 copolymers have not been used in the synthesis of the interfacial templated blocking films so far and thus, the effect of these copolymers was also investigated on the photovoltaic properties of these blocking layers. Moreover, two types of FTO substrates (7 and 15 Ω sq−1) were used in this work in order to replace the FTO glasses with higher conductivity instead of the 15 Ω sq−1 glass that is commonly used in DSSCs and PSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Characterization of interfacial templated TiO2 films
A series of mesoporous samples were prepared by using P123, F127, Brij58 and PSA block copolymers via a sol–gel process. Actually, two kinds of triblock copolymers including P123 and F127, and diblock copolymers such as Brij58 and PSA were used in the preparation of templated TiO2 films and their effect on light transmittance and photovoltaic performance in dye sensitized and perovskite solar cells was investigated. The obtained interfacial blocking layers are denoted as P123-ib, F127-ib, Brij58-ib, PSA-ib and dense-ib film for the layers prepared using P123, F127, Brij58, PSA and dense solutions, respectively.

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis spectra of templated titania thin films deposited on FTO glass.

As can be seen, these layers increase the visible light transmission as compared with the FTO glass substrate and TiO2 dense layer, which are commonly used in DSSCs and perovskite solar cells. The light transmittance of four types of TiO2 templated films, deposited on FTO glasses (7 Ω sq−1) as interfacial layers, was compared with that of the TiO2 dense layer and blank FTO samples (7 and 15 Ω sq−1). Interestingly, the optical transmission of the FTO glass remarkably increased by the coating of all TiO2 templated films. It is also clear that P123-ib film shows the highest transmittance in the visible region as compared with other layers coated on FTO. On the other hand, the TiO2 dense layer does not increase the visible optical transmittance compared with the FTO blank. Moreover, P123-ib film displays the highest transmittance compared with the visible light transparency of templated blocking films so far reported.24,25 FE-SEM images were used in order to observe the morphology of templated films prepared using different copolymers and find the relationship between transmittance and pore size. Fig. 2a–c show that the templated films prepared using P123, Brij58 and F127 in the relative humidity of 25–30% have disordered wormlike mesoporous morphology but the mesoporous film prepared using the PSA copolymer under the same humidity conditions presents cubic morphology with high regular pore architecture (Fig. 2d). It is noteworthy that in this relative humidity, a disordered structure is usually achieved for mesoporous templated films but here for PSA film such a beautiful ordered structure was obtained.

It should also be noted that all samples do not have any cracking on their surfaces. Using FE-SEM images the average pore size of the P123-ib, F127-ib, Brij58-ib and PSA-ib layers was estimated to be 8.33 ± 1.06, 6.43 ± 1.11, 9.13 ± 1.73 and 15.14 ± 2.38 nm, respectively (Fig. 2e–h). As shown, P123-ib and F127-ib films with smaller pore sizes displayed higher transmittance than PSA-ib and Brij58-ib films with larger pore diameters. However, among the templated titania films, prepared using triblock copolymers, the F127-ib film with a smaller average pore size showed less transmittance than the P123-ib film with a larger average pore size. Moreover, among the meso films made from diblock copolymers, the Brij58-ib film with a smaller average pore size showed less transmittance than the PSA-ib film. This incompatibility can be due to the fact that the root-mean-square (rms) roughness of the surface and refractive index play an important role in light transmission.28,44 To find the effect of rms on transmittance, AFM analysis was carried out. The AFM images (Fig. 3a–f) show that the rms of the surface for the P123-ib, F127-ib, Brij58-ib, PSA-ib and dense-ib titania films were 1.6, 6.9, 25, 16.7 and 29.8 nm respectively, as compared to 38.2 nm for the blank FTO (7 Ω sq−1) glass.

It is clear that all templated TiO2 films have less roughness than TiO2 dense film and blank FTO glass. On the other hand, P123-ib film surface is very smooth and has the lowest roughness among all the mesoporous samples and the dense-ib surface is very rough in comparison with them. It is worth mentioning that the presence of the dense layer reduces FTO roughness; however the templated films are much less rough. This shows that templated structures can significantly reduce the roughness. This issue can be very impressive in the transparency of FTO. As specified in the AFM analysis in both diblock and triblock categories, triblock copolymers exhibit low rms on the film surfaces than the diblock copolymers. Thus, triblock copolymers give rise to smaller pores, low rms and therefore more optical transmittance according to UV-vis analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, the films with larger pore sizes in each of the categories exhibit higher transmittance. In other words, with increment in pore sizes in the films made from both diblock and triblock copolymers, the light transmittance in P123-ib and PSA-ib films has increased. This is related to the low rms in these films. Another effective factor which plays an important role in transmittance is refractive index. Schwenzer et al. optimized the refractive indices of TiO2 by introducing F127 and P123 Pluronic triblock copolymers.28 Their results showed that while the pore size in the templated films is the dominant parameter affecting the refractive indices, porosity in a given material might be another factor influencing the refractive indices and optical properties of the mesoporous TiO2 films. In fact, these parameters should be tuned to decrease the refractive indices. We utilised ellipsometry analysis to investigate the porosity and refractive indices of TiO2 films used in our study (see Table 1).

As clearly shown, P123-ib film with the highest porosity has the lowest refractive index. In other words, refractive index decreases with increase in porosity. These are in agreement with the previously reported results in the literature.28 On the other hand, the samples with lower refractive indices show higher light transmittance and vice versa (see the transmittance spectra in Fig. 1), which confirms the literature results.47 Generally, P123-ib film with the lowest refractive index and rms exhibits the highest transmittance.

Fig. 4 shows the SEM cross-section of the two samples of TiO2 templated thin films made using diblock (PSA) and triblock (P123) copolymers, which are deposited on the FTO glasses. It is obvious that both samples have almost identical thickness (about 250 nm). On the other hand, the titania P123-ib film has a very smooth surface which is confirmed by AFM analysis. Although the titania PSA-ib film has a regular pore structure, its surface is not perfectly smooth. This can influence the light transmittance and decrease it, which is confirmed by UV-vis spectra. It must be mentioned that the cylindrical channels perpendicular to the substrate can cause electrolyte diffusion into the FTO substrate and, therefore, affect the VOC value (see Section 2.2.).

As shown in Fig. 5, the transparency of the P123-ib film on FTO (7 Ω sq−1) is compared with that of the blank FTO (7 Ω sq−1). It is clearly seen that the transparency of the FTO glass increases significantly in the presence of the P123 mesoporous layer.

2.2. Photovoltaic performances of interfacial templated blocking layers
In the present work, dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) were fabricated using the templated titania films as interfacial blocking layers between the FTO and the main nanocrystalline TiO2 layer. In addition, a P123-ib film was used as an interfacial blocking layer in the perovskite solar cell for the first time. It should be noted that a dense-ib layer was also evaluated for comparison of both DSSCs and PSCs.
The cross-sectional FE-SEM image of the DSSC photoelectrode with a configuration of FTO/P123-ib film/mesoporous TiO2/scattering layer has been shown in Fig. 6a. Also for the perovskite device, a configuration of FTO/P123-ib film/mesoporous TiO2 + CH3NH3PbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au has been demonstrated in Fig. 6b. Fig. 7 illustrates the photocurrent density to voltage (J–V) characteristics of DSSCs bearing templated TiO2 blocking layers. The extracted photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. As observed in Fig. 7 and Table 2, an improvement in photocurrent density has been achieved by the introduction of blocking layers. This can be due to the increase in FTO light transmission by the use of templated films as the interfacial layers and hence the increase of light harvesting efficiency. Meanwhile, the P123-ib sample shows the highest photocurrent and efficiency among all the DSSC devises. As confirmed in Fig. 1, the high optical transmittance of P123-ib film can be a reason for this remarkable performance. On the other hand, the FTO substrate (7 Ω sq−1) coated with the P123 film presents better photocurrent density and performance because of its higher light transmission and conductivity as compared with the cell containing FTO (15 Ω sq−1) without any blocking layer. Fig. 7 and Table 2 also show that all DSSCs with blocking layers have higher VOC than blank FTO glasses without any interfacial blocking film. Decreasing the electron recombination by minimizing the direct contact between the conductive FTO surface and the redox electrolyte may be the reason for this. The open circuit photovoltage (VOC) of the dense-ib sample is slightly higher than that of others which is probably because the dense-ib layer does not allow full contact between FTO and the electrolyte. On the other hand, PSA-ib film has the smallest VOC among all the blocking meso-layers.

It might be because of the easier penetration of the electrolyte in this type of templated interfacial films with the largest mean pore diameter. As mentioned, the role of the interfacial layers is considered to be blocking the back-transport reaction at the FTO/TiO2 interface. Open circuit photovoltage (VOC) is known to be strongly dependent on the recombination or back reactions on the TiO2 and electrolyte interface, where, by suppressing these reactions a larger VOC value can be achieved.13,15 As shown in Fig. 7, utilising the blocking layer in DSSCs increases VOC. This clearly demonstrates that the back transport of electrons from the FTO electrode to the I3− ions in the electrolyte is suppressed by the use of interfacial blocking layers. As shown, VOC values in DSSC-based templated blocking layers are lower than that of the cell with the dense-ib layer. However, photocurrent density enhancement in DSSC-based templated blocking layers, in particular P123-ib film, compared to the dense-ib layer, is so high that it compensates the decreasing effect in the VOC value. Finally, this leads to an increase in conversion efficiency for DSSCs based on the interfacial blocking templated film as compared with the dense-ib layer. Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the DSSCs with and without interfacial blocking layers is shown in Fig. 7B. As observed, the samples present higher IPCE over the whole spectral range of 400–800 nm after introducing the blocking layers. It is notable that IPCE of the DSSC has increased from 70% to 95% at 540 nm using the P123-ib layer. As mentioned, the FTO glass coated with this meso-layer also shows the highest light transmittance and photocurrent density. As shown, the minimum IPCE was related to the DSSC based blank FTO (7 Ω sq−1) with the lowest transmittance among all the devices (63%). Hence, the enhanced light absorption in the device is helpful to enhance IPCE values. Thus, by increasing transmitted light through FTO glass light absorption by the sensitizer, the LHE and JSC would consequently increase. Moreover, JSC data were calculated by integrating the IPCE curves. The predicted current densities for FTO (7 Ω sq−1), dense-ib, Brij58-ib, PSA-ib, F127-ib, P123-ib and FTO (15 Ω sq−1) were equal to 13.34, 14.23, 15.48, 16.16, 16.87, 19.9 and 17.64 mA cm−2, respectively. These data are regularly lower than the JSC values measured from J–V curves. This might be due to the presence of some mismatches between the simulated sunlight and AM 1.5G standard.

Fig. 8 displays the impedance spectra (Nyquist plots) for DSSC devices. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of DSSCs were measured with an Autolab-302 at open-circuit potential under AM 1.5G one sun irradiation. The frequency range for the analysis was from 10−1 Hz to 106 Hz and the amplitude of the alternating signal was 10 mV. The obtained impedance spectra were fitted with Z-view software. The lifetime of electrons (τe) was estimated according to the relationship τe = (ωmax)−1, where ωmax is the maximum angular frequency of the larger impedance semicircle in the Nyquist plots. The electron lifetimes for FTO (7 Ω sq−1) without the blocking layer, FTO (15 Ω sq−1) with the blocking layer, PSA-ib, P123-ib, Brij58-ib, F127-ib and dense-ib were calculated to be 0.112 s, 0.119 s, 0.122 s, 0.138 s, 0.147 s, 0.151 s and 0.166 s, respectively. The increased τeff value suggests the retardation of the recombination or back reactions on the TiO2 layer and electrolyte interface. Indeed, VOC is known to be strongly dependent on the recombination or back reactions taking place at the TiO2 and electrolyte interface, and a larger VOC value can be obtained by suppressing those reactions via blocking layers.

Fig. 9A and Table 3 show the photovoltaic performances of perovskite solar cells including dense-ib and P123-ib layers on FTO 7 Ω sq−1. As far as we know, applying this templated blocking film and its effect on PSC performance has not been studied and reported to date. As observed, by the use of the P123-ib layer the short circuit density of PSCs was improved significantly by 29% from 18.72 to 24.08 mA cm−2, mainly due to the increase in transmitted light through the FTO glass 7 Ω sq−1. This indicates the importance of the templated structure in the blocking layer. Also, the P123-ib layer presents conversion efficiency of 16.7% while the dense-ib layer provides 15.08% in PSC (about 11% enhancement). This improvement in conversion efficiency mainly resulted from the increase of JSC. Fig. 9B shows a comparison of the IPCE spectra of PSCs with P123-ib and dense-ib films. By replacing P123-ib film with the dense-ib layer, a remarkable increase over the whole wavelength light absorption range (370–800 nm) is observed. Obviously, the IPCE curves follow the light transmittance. In other words, applying the templated P123-ib layer on the FTO glass increases light transmittance and therefore increases the IPCE.

Indeed, high light transmittance through the FTO glass facilitates maximum absorption by the perovskite layer. This results in the increase of light harvesting and thus enhancement in JSC and conversion efficiency.
Impedance measurements for PSC devices were carried out from 1 MHz to 0.01 Hz using an AC signal with amplitude 50 mV at a bias voltage 0 V under dark conditions. Two arcs exist in EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 10). The arcs at high frequency (smaller arcs) are attributed to the charge transport in the TiO2 layer, HTM, and/or at the HTM/Au interface. The second arcs in the low frequency (larger arcs) are assigned to the charge recombination.48,49 The higher resistance of the dense-ib cell in the recombination arc shows lower recombination, which is in agreement with the higher VOC of this cell.48–50

Results in the literature have shown that the photovoltaic performance of PSCs is extremely dependent on the thickness of blocking layers.49–51 One approach to improve the electron transport to FTO is reducing the thickness of the blocking layer which shortens the electron pathway within the TiO2 layer.49–51 A thicker interfacial blocking layer increases the distance and resistance of photoelectrons,51 so the interfacial blocking layer should be designed as thin as possible so that it preserves the hole-blocking effect. Hence, we prepared 146.15 nm P123-ib film with a withdrawal rate of 7 mm min−1 as the thinnest possible film that we could prepare. This P123-ib film presented better performance compared to 250 nm P123-ib film with an open circuit voltage of 1.07 V, short circuit photocurrent density of 24.09 mA cm−2, fill factor of 0.68 and solar conversion efficiency of 17.42%.
3. Conclusion
Based on the findings, P123 coated blocking film exhibits the best light transmittance and the lowest RF among different investigated templated films. Introducing this interfacial film instead of the usual dense blocking layer in DSSCs and PSCs has a striking effect on transmittance enhancement, incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE), photocurrent density and hence conversion efficiency of the cells.
Moreover, the FTO substrate (7 Ω sq−1) coated with the P123 film presents better photocurrent density and photovoltaic performance because of its higher light transmission and conductivity as compared with the cell containing FTO (15 Ω sq−1) without the blocking layer. Evidently, the photocurrent density (JSC) increased to a large extent from 15.89 to 21.23 mA cm−2 for the dye sensitized solar cell and from 18.72 to 24.09 mA cm−2 for the perovskite solar cell by the use of the P123 templated interfacial blocking layer.
In addition, the energy conversion efficiency of the DSSC and PSC employing this templated blocking layer improved by 33% and 16%, respectively. Thus, highly conductive FTO (7 Ω sq−1) coated with a P123 blocking layer is a good candidate as the substrate for the future development of photovoltaic or even other optoelectronic devices.
4. Experimental section
4.1. Preparation of initial solutions for coating
A series of samples were prepared by varying the type of block copolymer. In fact, two kinds of diblock (Brij58 and PSA) and triblock (P123 and F127) copolymers were used as structure directing agents. In this regard, four types of precursor solutions from P123, F127, Brij58 and PSA block copolymers were prepared.
P123 solution was prepared according to the procedure reported in our previous studies.6,45,46 In a typical procedure, concentrated HCl (Merck, 36 wt%, 9.7 g) was added to tetraethyl orthotitanate (Sigma-Aldrich, 12.7 g) under vigorous stirring. Separately, block copolymer Pluronic P123 (Sigma-Aldrich, 4.0 g) was dissolved in 1-butanol (Aldrich, 36.3 g) and then was added to the HCl/Ti(OEt)4 solution.
For preparing F127 solution, 0.67 g F127 Pluronic surfactant (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 23.3 mL ethanol (Merck). In another beaker, 3.2 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid (36 wt%) was added to 2.84 g Ti(OEt)4. Finally, the yellowish Ti-precursor solution was slowly added to the F127 ethanolic solution.24,52,53
By mixing 22.4 mL 1-butanol, 2 g Brij58 (Merck), 7.9 g Ti(OEt)4 and 4.1 mL concentrated hydrochloric acid (36 wt%), Brij58 solution was obtained.53
To produce PSA solution, 0.244 g PS(16400)–PEO(36400) diblock copolymer (Polymer Source) was dissolved in a mixture of tetrahydrofuran (Acros Organics, 2.6 g) and ethanol (3.3 g). Then, a mixture of Ti(OEt)4 (1.024 g) and concentrated hydrochloric acid (36 wt%, 1.458 g) was added to the primary solution dropwise.
All these solutions were aged by stirring at ambient temperature for at least 3 h before coating.
For comparison, a blank solution without using any copolymer was also synthesized to prepare a dense blocking layer.54,55 In a typical synthesis, 0.357 g titanium tetraisopropoxide (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 1.999 g ethanol. In another flask, 0.042 g HCl was mixed with 1.999 g ethanol and subsequently was added to the titanium solution dropwise under constant stirring.
4.2. Interfacial blocking TiO2 film preparation
The mesoporous films were deposited onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (Solaronix, ∼7 Ω sq−1) using a dip coating system (Advanced Equipment Engineering Company, Iran) with withdrawal rates of 30, 58, 48 and 48 mm min−1 for P123, F127, Brij58 and PSA solutions, respectively. The relative humidity was set at 25% to 30% at 25 °C in the electronic dip coating chamber. Deposition conditions such as the withdrawal rate and the sol concentration were adjusted to ensure the same thickness of every layer on the FTO glass substrate.
The prepared films were directly transferred on a hot plate and were stabilized for 15 min at 300 °C. In order to remove the block copolymers that were used as structure-directing agents, the films were calcined under air at 450 °C for 1 h (heating rate: 1 °C min−1).6,45,46,52 The usual dense TiO2 film was prepared by spin-casting the precursor solution at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by calcination at 500 °C for 1 h in air (heating rate: 1 °C min−1).55
4.3. Fabrication of DSSCs
A standard non-organized nanocrystalline TiO2 (NC-TiO2) paste was coated onto the prepared titania blocking layers by the doctor-blade method and then calcined at 400 °C according to our previous method.45,46 These prepared photoelectrodes were cooled to 150 °C and then sensitized. In this regard, the samples were slowly immersed into a 0.3 mM solution of N719 ruthenium dye (Solaronix) in ethanol and were sensitized for 48 h at room temperature. In the next step, the electrodes were rinsed thoroughly with anhydrous ethanol and dried in air. The excess amount of sensitized TiO2 is scraped off the FTO substrate to make an active area of 0.25 cm2 (0.5 cm × 0.5 cm). For preparing the Pt counter electrode, a drop of 0.5 mM H2PtCl6 solution in anhydrous isopropanol was poured on FTO glass followed by heating at 385 °C for 15 min in air before cell assembly. The redox couple/electrolyte solution was composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M lithium iodide (LiI, Aldrich Chemical), 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (98%, Ionic Liquids Technology), 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Aldrich Chemical Company) and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate dissolved in acetonitrile (Aldrich Chemical Company). A thermoplastic Surlyn sealant was applied to seal the space between the anode and platinum counter electrode. The liquid electrolyte was injected between the electrodes via an injection hole that was made in the counter electrode beforehand.
4.4. Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
The perovskite photovoltaic cells were fabricated by the following process.55 First, FTO-coated glass substrates were patterned by etching with Zn powder and HCl solution (2 M). After cleaning the substrates, the P123-ib film was deposited on the FTO substrates. For comparison, a sample was also prepared using the dense-ib layer. Next, the substrates were treated in 40 mM TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 °C and washed with deionized water. The mesostructure TiO2 layer was deposited on the interfacial blocking titania layers by spin-coating (Advanced Equipment Engineering Company, Iran) at 5000 rpm for 30 s with a solution including 500 mg of a commercial TiO2 paste (Sharif Solar) dispersed in 1.5 g of dried ethanol. These samples were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min under ambient conditions. Deposition of the perovskite layer was carried out at room temperature and air atmosphere with relative humidity of 20%. To prepare a pigment with a perovskite structure, a solution of PbI2:CH3NH3I in DMF (1:1) was stirred at room temperature overnight and then introduced into the TiO2 mesopores using a spin-coating method at 3000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 100 °C for 10 minutes. In the next stage, the spiro-OMeTAD-based hole transporting layer was deposited by spin-coating at 2000 rpm for 30 s. The spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 26.6 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μL of a stock solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene.56 Finally, gold (Au) metal contacts were evaporated onto the sample as top electrodes to create a 0.09 cm2 active area.
4.5. Characterization
To study the film texture and thickness of the deposited films, field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, S4160 Hitachi Japan) and atomic force microscopy (AFM, Veeco PCResearch USA) were used. For porosity measurements, the refractive indices of the mesoporous films were measured using an ellipsometer (SENTECH, SENpro). The optical characteristics of deposited films were analyzed by UV-vis spectroscopy using the wavelength range of 190–900 nm. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells were measured under one sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) illumination with a solar simulator (Sharif Solar). The EIS experiments were performed using a potentiostat/galvanostat AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N/FRA2 (Metrohm Autolab, Utrecht, The Netherlands).
The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was carried out with spectral response measuring equipment (CEP-1500).
