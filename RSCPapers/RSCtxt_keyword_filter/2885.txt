It has been shown that positioning of the alkyl substituents affects strongly frontier energy levels of the polymers and results in variation of their optical band gaps between 1.65 and 2.0 eV. The highest (2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the lowest (2.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) charge carrier mobilities determined for the polymers P1 and P5, respectively, using a SCLC technique differ by more than one order of magnitude. GIWAXS measurements also revealed very different degrees of molecular ordering in the films of polymers P1–P5 which correlate well with the SCLC mobility data and solid state photoluminescence spectra of these materials. The bulk heterojunction solar cells based on the composites of polymers P1–P5 with [60]PCBM demonstrated power conversion efficiencies ranging from 0.6% (P5) to 5.1% (P1) thus evidencing a strong influence of the alkyl side chains on the photovoltaic performance of the designed polymer-based materials.
Introduction
The efficiency of organic fullerene/polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells has been increased dramatically during the last few years mainly due to design and implementation of novel electron donor materials with advanced optoelectronic properties.1 Various combinations of electron deficient units (quinoxaline, benzothiadiazole, benzooxadiazole, benzotriazole, 1,4-diketopyrrolopyrrole, thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione, and isoindigo) with strong thiophene-based electron donors (substituted thiophenes, cyclopentadithiophene, dithienobenzene, dithienopyrrole, dithienosilole, dithienogermole) and often also with additional building blocks bearing solubilizing alkyl side chains (carbazole, fluorene, silafluorene) resulted in hundreds of novel polymer structures.2 Several research groups have reported power conversion efficiencies of 8–9% for single junction fullerene/polymer solar cells.3
Remarkable progress in the chemistry and physics of conjugated polymers led to development of theoretical approaches allowing one to predict properties of target materials considering electronic structures of individual building blocks.4 However, the accuracy of these predictions remains relatively low.5 One of the reasons is a very little attention paid by researchers to the impact of solubilizing alkyl side chains on the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers. The situation has changed recently when a number of reports confirmed that alkyl chains might influence strongly all properties of conjugated polymers.6 In particular, the effects of size, position and relative orientation of alkyl chains in a rather popular building block TBT (T – thiophene, B – benzothiadiazole) were studied in detail.7 We have reported recently a novel conjugated polymer P1 incorporating a TTBTBTT unit (Fig. 1) which demonstrated advanced optoelectronic properties and superior photostability and a promising photovoltaic performance, η > 6% was reached for solar cells based on P2/[70]PCBM blends.8 In the present work we report design and systematic investigation of optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of conjugated polymers P2–P5 with different arrangements of solubilizing side chains compared to P1 (Fig. 1). In particular, the impact of positioning of 2-ethylhexyl substituents in the TTBTBTT unit is addressed for the first time.

Results and discussion
The synthesis of polymers P1–P5 required preparation of key TTBTBTT monomers M1–M5, respectively. The non-functionalized TBTBT core unit 2 has been synthesized starting from 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole which was introduced in Stille cross-coupling reaction with tributyl(thiophene-2-yl)stannane which afforded 1 in reasonable yields.
The 4-bromo-7-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole 1 was treated with 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene under the Stille reaction conditions which provided the target compound 2 (Scheme 1). Compound 2 demonstrated low solubility in organic solvents. Therefore, bromination of 2 with NBS was performed in warm 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). The obtained dibromide 3 was introduced to Stille cross-coupling reaction with tributyl(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane which resulted in a mixture of 4 and 5 as a major product.
 Scheme 1  Reagents and conditions: (i) Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, reflux, 24 h; (ii) 2 eq. NBS, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, 55 °C, 60 h; (iii) Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, reflux, 110 °C, ∼12 h; (iv) 2 eq. NBS, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, RT, ∼8 h. 
The formation of isomeric product 5 in this reaction seems to be driven by steric repulsion induced by the bulky 2-ethylhexyl substituent adjacent to the –SnBu3 group. Indeed, lowering the reaction temperature (from 110 °C down to 70–80 °C, at lower temperatures reaction does not proceed with a reasonable rate) improves the yield of expected product 4 and decreases the yield of isomerization product 5.
Compounds 4 and 5 were separated and purified using preparative HPLC and columns with gel or silica stationary phases. Bromination of 4 and 5 in 1,2-DCB at room temperature yielded target monomers M1 and M2, respectively.
The monomer M3 was readily prepared from 3 using cross-coupling reaction with less sterically hindered tributyl(4-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane yielding one major product 6 (no isomerization byproducts observed), which was subsequently dibrominated with NBS (Scheme 1).
The syntheses of monomers M4 and M5 started from the Stille cross-coupling reactions of 4,7-dibromobenzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole with stannanes derived from corresponding alkylthiophenes. When the content of the desired monosubstitution product in the reaction mixture exceeded 50%, 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene was added thus producing solubilized TBTBT precursors 7a and 7b with acceptable yields (Scheme 2).
 Scheme 2  Reagents and conditions: (i) Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, reflux, 6–8 h; (ii) bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene, Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, reflux, 24 h; (iii) 2 eq. NBS, 1,2-dichlorobenzene, RT, ∼8 h; (iv) Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, 2 M aqueous K2CO3, aliquat 336, reflux, 10–12 h. 
Following bromination of 7a and 7b with NBS afforded compounds 8a and 8b, which were converted to 9a and 9b by treatment with 2-thiopheneboronic acid under typical Suzuki cross-coupling conditions. Finally, dibromination of 9a and 9b with NBS resulted in target monomers M4 and M5 (Scheme 2).
The conjugated polymers P1–P5 were synthesized using Suzuki–Miyaura polycondensation of the carbazole-based diboronic component 11 and monomers M1–M5 (Scheme 3).
 Scheme 3  Reagents and conditions: (i) Pd(PPh3)4, toluene, 2 M aqueous K2CO3, aliquat 336, reflux, 3–8 h. 
Some characteristics of the obtained polymers are summarized in Table 1. It is notable that all polymers exhibited reasonably good solubility in organic solvents (e.g. chlorobenzene or DCB) in spite of reaching their high molecular weights (60–191 kDa) in the case of P1–P4.

The absorption spectra of P1–P5 measured in solution (Fig. 2) and in solid films (Fig. S1, ESI†) revealed a strong influence of the positioning of solubilizing alkyl chains on the optical properties of these polymers.
 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of P1–P5 measured in 1,2-dichlorobenzene. 
The widest optical band gap was revealed for conjugated polymer P5. Most probably, a notable blue shift of the absorption band of P5 compared to P1–P4 originates from a strong twist of the backbone of this polymer. Such twist was previously observed for TBT-based polymers bearing alkyl chains in 3 and 3′ positions of the thiophene rings adjacent to the central benzothiadiazole moiety (so called “in–in” configuration).7 Most probably, strong steric hindrance induced by bulky 2-ethylhexyl substituents makes thiophene rings non-coplanar with the benzothiadiazole and carbazole units. The non-planar structure of the P5 backbone diminishes significantly the conjugation length which explains unfavorable optical properties (in particularly, wide band gap) of this material.
It is notable that polymer P1 demonstrating the most advanced optical properties also comprises two 2-ethylhexyl chains in “in–in” configuration which are located at 3 and 3′ positions of the outlying thiophene rings in the TTBTBTT unit. Considering the molecular structures of polymers P1 and P5 one can easily see that a simple shift of two solubilizing alkyl chains from one thiophene ring to another leads to a dramatic change in the optical properties of the materials. At the same time, the observed decrease in the band gap by 0.35 eV going from P5 to P1 should have a crucial influence on photovoltaic performance of these polymers.
The polymer P2 is distinguished from P1 only by the position of a single 2-ethylhexyl chain in the TTBTBTT framework (“in–out” configuration). Nevertheless, such modification was sufficient to shift the absorption band maximum from 607 nm (P1) to 590 nm (P2). A considerable difference in the band gaps of these two materials is clearly seen in Fig. 2 and documented in Table 1. Conjugated polymer P3 bearing two alkyl chains attached at 4 and 4′ positions of the outlying thiophene rings (“out–out” configuration) showed very similar optical properties compared to P2. It can be assumed that bulky 2-ethylhexyl chains looking towards the carbazole unit also induce some steric hindrance (C19 alkyl chain attached to carbazole might contribute to this effect) leading to some minor (compared to P5) twisting of the polymer backbone. Such structural features would explain inferior optical characteristics of P2 and P3 as compared to P1. However, this assumption does not explain why P4 demonstrated a very similar absorption profile to P2 and P3. Steric hindrance effects are expected to be minimal in the case of P4 and therefore they should not affect significantly the optical properties of this material. The fact that P4 showed a wider optical band compared to P1 was intriguing and can be hardly explained considering only the peculiarities of the molecular structures of these two polymers.
Electrochemical properties of polymers P1–P5 were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV). The obtained voltammograms are shown in Fig. S2, ESI.† All polymers demonstrated facile oxidation, while their reduction was poorly reproducible. Such behavior is very characteristic for p-type organic semiconductor materials. Following the standard procedure,9 HOMO energies of P1–P5 were estimated from the onsets of the oxidation waves using a value of −5.1 eV for the Fermi energy of the Fc/Fc+ couple. LUMO energies were calculated as HOMO + Eg, where Eg corresponds to the optical band gaps of these materials. The data presented in Table 1 show that alkyl side chains affect significantly frontier energy levels of polymers P1–P5. Indeed, HOMO and LUMO energies change from −5.44 (P1) to −5.62 (P5) and from −3.62 (P5) to −3.86 (P3), respectively. It should be emphasized that alkyl side chains affect the electronic properties of conjugated polymers much stronger than, for instance, replacement of the benzothiadiazole unit in PCDTBT with benzooxadiazole, benzoselenodiazole or difluorobenzothiadiazole.10 Therefore, positions of the alkyl side chains in the polymer backbone have to be optimized in order to reach optimal optoelectronic characteristics and the best electrical performance.
Self-organization of conjugated polymers P1–P5 in thin films was investigated using grazing incident wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS). Even though all polymers were found to be amorphous, the formation of a layer-like periodic structure was revealed in some cases. It is seen from Fig. 3 that the most intense scattering peak was observed in the case of polymer P1 with two 2-ethylhexyl substituents attached at positions 3 and 3′ to the outlying thiophene rings in the TTBTBTT unit (“in–in” configuration). This observation suggests that polymer P1 has appropriate molecular architecture (at least compared to P2–P5) promoting its self-organization in thin films. Change of the position of one alkyl chain in P2 (“in–out” configuration) damages the ordering of the polymer as it can be concluded from the decreased intensity of the scattering peak corresponding to the inter-layer periodicity. This effect becomes even more pronounced when the second alkyl chain is moved from 3′ to 4′ position in the case of polymer P3 (“out–out” configuration). These findings confirmed that alkyl chains introduced at positions 4 and 4′ of the outlying thiophene rings in the TTBTBTT block induce some steric hindrance presumably due to interactions with the neighboring carbazole moiety also bearing a bulky alkyl substituent. It is notable that moving these alkyl chains away from carbazole and closer to benzothiadiazole units (positions 4 and 4′ of the thiophene rings adjacent to benzothiadiazole) in the case of P4 results in improved ordering as compared to P2 and P3. Finally, it was not surprising that polymer P5 with the most sterically hindered structure forms highly disordered thin films with almost no periodical structure.

It is also notable that positioning of the alkyl side chains in the TTBTBTT framework affects values of interplanar distances revealed from GIWAXS patterns also. The longest d-spacing (21 Å) was detected for polymer P2 with the side chains grafted in asymmetric positions. Polymers P3 and P4 showed shorter interplanar distances equal to 20 Å. The shortest interlayer distance of 19 Å was revealed for polymer P1. The d-spacing value of the peaks at GIWAXS profiles and their intensities reflect the quality of chain packing in thin films of conjugated polymers. One can conclude that the best self-organization occurs in the films of polymer P1 also demonstrating advanced optical characteristics in the solid state and in solution.
Photoluminescence (PL) of solid polymer films provided additional information about self-assembling of polymer chains in thin films. It is known that fluorescence of conjugated polymers is quenched efficiently in π-stacks, therefore, highly crystalline polymers demonstrate very weak solid state fluorescence.11 Indeed, the lowest PL intensity was observed for the films of polymers P1 and P2 forming the most organized films according to the GIWAXS data. Some increase in the PL intensity was observed for polymers P3 and P4 which correlates with the disorder induced by the side chains attached at 4 and 4′ positions of the thiophene rings in the TTBTBTT unit. At the same time, disordered films of P5 demonstrate the most intense fluorescence (Fig. 4). It is notable that increase in the photoluminescence intensity is accompanied by a blue shift of the band maximum going from P1 (756 nm) and P2 (762 nm) to P3 (737 nm) and P4 (734 nm) and then to P5 (695 nm).

Charge transport properties of thin films of P1–P5 were investigated using the SCLC technique applied to the hole-only devices of the following architecture: glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50–60 nm)/polymer (100–300 nm)/MoO3 (20 nm)/Ag (100 nm) (J1/2–V plots are shown in Fig. S3†). The estimated charge carrier mobilities are given in Table 1. It is seen from these data that hole mobility is also strongly influenced by the positions of alkyl side chains in studied polymers P1–P5. The highest mobility value (2.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) obtained for the most ordered films of P1 is more than one order of magnitude higher compared to the hole mobility in disordered films of P5 (2.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). It is notable that charge carrier mobilities estimated for P1–P4 correlate with the interlayer distances revealed from GIWAXS measurements. Indeed, the highest mobility shown by P1 corresponds to the shortest interlayer distance (19 Å) and vice versa, the lowest mobility determined for P2 corresponds to the longest interlayer spacing (21 Å). The origin of the observed correlation (which might be just coincidental) can be clarified in future by investigation of a wider range of conjugated polymers possessing similar molecular structures.
Summarizing the results obtained from absorption and photoluminescence spectra, cyclic voltammetry measurements, SCLC and GIWAXS measurements performed for P1–P5 it can be concluded that P1 is the most promising material for electronic applications. The advanced properties of P1 originate from peculiarities of its molecular structure particularly defined by specific positions of the solubilizing 2-ethylhexyl side chains.
Polymers P1–P5 were investigated as electron donor materials in organic bulk heterojunction solar cells using [60]PCBM as an electron acceptor counterpart. The standard device architecture included ITO glass covered with a 50–60 nm thick layer of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios HTL) as a hole-collecting electrode, a photoactive layer based on the fullerene/polymer blend (60–150 nm) and Ca (20 nm)/Ag (100 nm) as an electron-collecting electrode. The polymer/[60]PCBM blends were processed from pure 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) and from binary solvents based on DCB–1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) mixtures. The volume concentration of DIO was varied from 0.12 to 6.0%. At the same time, we varied polymer/[60]PCBM ratios (from 1:1 to 1:4), film thickness (from 60 to 150 nm) and annealing regimes. Such optimization revealed optimal blend processing conditions indicated in Table 2.

The light-on I–V characteristics and EQE spectra of the fabricated solar cells are shown in Fig. 5. It was revealed that positions of alkyl side chains in polymers P1–P5 affect strongly their photovoltaic performance. The solar cell power conversion efficiencies decrease in the order P1 > P2 > P3 ∼ P4 ≫ P5 mainly due to lowering of the short circuit current densities and fill factors (Table 2).

J–V curves for solar cells based on polymers P1–P5 and [60]PCBM measured under simulated AM1.5 (100 mW cm−2) irradiation (a). EQE spectra of the devices based on conjugated polymers P1–P5 (b). 
The AFM images obtained for the polymer–[60]PCBM blends did not reveal serious morphology problems (Fig. S4†). All composite films exhibited a very similar fine morphology with multiple small (10–20 nm) clusters appearing on the surface. Thus, surface morphology of the fullerene/polymer blends did not explain different photovoltaic performance of P1–P5.
It is notable that photovoltaic performance of conjugated polymers P1–P5 correlates well with the degree of ordering in their thin films revealed using GIWAXS measurements and PL. Indeed, polymer P1 showing the strongest tendency to form π-stacks revealed the highest reproducible device efficiencies of 4.9–5.1% in combination with [60]PCBM. At the same time, the most disordered polymer P5 forming virtually no π-stacks in the films provided a very low solar cell efficiency of 0.6%. These results proved that self-organization of conjugated polymers in thin films is a crucially important parameter governing their photovoltaic performance.
Attachment of alkyl side chains to the TTBTBTT framework at different positions influences the ability of polymers to form π-stacks required for efficient photovoltaic operation. In particular, introduction of substituents at 4 and 4′ positions of thiophene rings like in the case of P2 (“in–out” configuration), P3 and P4 (“out–out” configuration) induces disorder inhibiting efficient solar cell operation. Thus, it was revealed that “in–in” configuration of the side chains attached to the outlying thiophene rings in the TTBTBTT unit realized in P1 can be considered as optimal and leads to advanced optoelectronic and photovoltaic properties of this material.
Conclusion
Five conjugated polymers comprising TTBTBTT units bearing two solubilizing 2-ethylhexyl substituents at different positions were synthesized and systematically investigated. It has been shown that positions of the alkyl chains affect significantly all properties of the designed materials: frontier energy levels, band gap, charge carrier mobility, self-assembling behavior and photoluminescence of solid films. It should be emphasized that minor alterations of the side chain positions induce even stronger changes in optoelectronic properties of the polymers than replacement of one building block in the polymer backbone (e.g. benzothiadiazole) with another (e.g. benzooxadiazole, benzoselenodiazole, quinoxaline and etc.). Therefore, it was not surprising that five polymers distinguished only by arrangement of the side chains demonstrated drastically different photovoltaic performances ranging from 0.6% to 5.1% (in combination with [60]PCBM). The best characteristics were provided by a polymer bearing alkyl chains at 3 and 3′ positions of the outlying thiophene rings in the TTBTBTT unit (so called “in–in” configuration). The results of this work support a general conclusion that positioning of the alkyl side chains in the polymer backbone is a crucially important issue which has to be particularly considered in the design of novel materials for organic electronics.
Experimental
Materials and instrumentation
All solvents and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Acros Organics and used as received or purified according to standard procedures. AFM images were obtained using an NTEGRA PRIMA instrument (NT-MDT, Russia). Absorption spectra (for solutions of polymers in DCB and thin films) and PL spectra were obtained using an Avantes AvaSpec-2048 optical fiber spectrometer.
GIWAXS measurements of thin films deposited on PEDOT:PSS were performed using a XeuSS SAXS/WAXS (Xenocs, France) machine coupled to a GeniX3D generator (λ = 1.54 Ǻ). The 2D data were collected with the incidence angle of 0.2° using Pilatus 300k and Rayonix LX170-HS detectors with sample to detector distances of 130 and 9 cm, respectively. The modulus of the scattering vector s (s = 2sinθ/λ, where θ is the Bragg angle) was calibrated using seven diffraction orders of silver behenate powder.
Molecular weight characteristics of conjugated polymers were obtained using a Shimadzu LC20 instrument equipped with a Phenomenex Luna Phenogel 5u column (0.78 × 30 cm, 5–500 kDa). The measurements were performed using freshly distilled THF or toluene as an eluent (flow rate 0.5 mL min−1). The column was calibrated using a series of commercial polystyrene standards obtained from Fluka (THF as eluent) or using custom-made F8BT standards with PDI < 1.5 (toluene used as eluent). Molecular weights of the F8BT standards were cross-checked additionally using a “Waters Alliance GPCV 2000” instrument equipped with a multi-angle scattering detector HELEOS II (Wyatt). Each polymer sample was analyzed in several (3–5) concentrations to discriminate effects of aggregation on the molecular weight characteristics of the material. All polymers showed very weak (or no) aggregation when they were analyzed in toluene at low concentrations.

Compound 1 (2.97 g, 10 mmol) and 2,5-bis(tributylstannyl)thiophene (3.31 g, 5 mmoles) were dissolved in anhydrous toluene (50 mL) in a three necked round-bottom flask. The mixture was deaerated and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.023 g, 0.02 mmol) was added under argon. The mixture was heated at reflux for 24 h and then cooled to the room temperature and added to hexanes (800 mL). The precipitate collected by filtration was washed in a Soxhlet apparatus with acetone for 3–4 h and then dried in air. The yield of the dark purple crystalline powder of TBTBT 2 was 45–50%. The purity of the prepared TBTBT samples estimated from HPLC and NMR data was between 95 and 97%. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 600 MHz): δ (ppm) 8.23 (s, 2H), 8.13 (d, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H), 7.99 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.90 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.46 (d, J = 5.0 Hz, 2H), 7.22 (t, J = 3.6 Hz, 2H). The 13C NMR spectrum was not obtained due to very low solubility of 2 in common organic solvents.
Synthesis of 3
The synthesis of 3 was carried out by dissolving 1.0 mmol of TBTBT in 40–80 mL of warm 1,2-dichlorobenzene, adding 2.0 mmol of NBS (N-bromosuccinimide) and stirring the reaction mixture at 55 °C for 60 h. Following concentration of the reaction mixture to dryness and washing the residue with methanol and acetone produced pure 3 in 90–96% yield. 1H NMR (CDCl3, 600 MHz): δ (ppm) 8.25 (s, 2H), 7.95 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.85 (d, J = 3.9 Hz, 2H), 7.82 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H), 7.13 (d, J = 3.9 Hz, 2H). The 13C NMR spectrum was not obtained due to very low solubility of 3 in common organic solvents.
Synthesis of 4 and 5
Compound 3 (1.0 g, 1.5 mmol) and tributyl(3-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)stannane (2.1 g, 4.5 mmol) were placed under argon in a two necked flask equipped with a reversed condenser. Afterwards, tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0) (10 mg, 0.008 mmol) and 50 mL of deaerated toluene were added. The obtained reaction mixture was stirred vigorously at 110 °C. The course of the reaction was monitored with HPLC. The synthesis was terminated when starting compound 3 disappeared and the amount of monofunctionalization products was below 10%. The mixture was poured into water and extracted with chloroform. The organic layer was then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. Finally, the solvent was removed at the rotary evaporator producing a viscous oily residue. The crude product was dissolved in 40 mL of toluene and filtered through a syringe filter (PTFE, 0.45 μm). The solution was processed further using a preparative Shodex GPC column (20 mm × 300 mm) and toluene as the eluent which resulted in isolation of pure 4 (40–47%) and 5 (30–36%). Separation of 4 and 5 can be also achieved using preparative HPLC Phenomenex Luna Silica (2) column (21 mm × 250 mm) and toluene–heptane mixtures as eluents.

Synthesis of P1–P5
Monomers 11 (657.6 mg, 1.0 mmol) and M1–M5 (1063 mg, 1.0 mmol) were introduced into a 50 mL round-bottom three necked flask equipped with a thermometer and a reversed condenser. Toluene (25 mL), 2 M aqueous solution of K2CO3 (2 mL), aliquat 336 (1 drop, ca. 80 mg) and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) (10 mg) were added in the sequence listed here. The reaction mixture was deaerated, immersed into an oil bath and heated at reflux for 3–6 hours. The molecular weight characteristics of the formed product were controlled every 30 min. The reaction was stopped when the weight average molecular weight Mw reached ca. 150000 g mol−1 or did not show further increase within 3–4 h. Then the reaction mixture was cooled down to a room temperature, the polymer was extracted with 500 mL of toluene, the resulting solution was washed 3 times with deionized water (250 mL), dried and concentrated in a vacuum (rotary evaporator) to 40 mL. Addition of 150 mL of methanol precipitated the crude polymer. Subsequent purification was achieved using several additional dissolving/precipitation cycles. Finally, the precipitated polymer flakes were filtered through the cellulose thimble and processed using Soxhlet extraction with hexanes (12 h), acetone (12 h), dichloromethane (12 h), chloroform (8 h) and chlorobenzene (12 h). The chlorobenzene extract was concentrated in a vacuum and precipitated in methanol. The obtained solid was collected by filtration and dried in a vacuum. The total yield of the purified polymers P1–P5 varied between 50 and 90% depending on the initial molecular weight and number of the applied dissolving/precipitation cycles.
Cyclic voltammetry measurements
The cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed for thin films (150–250 nm thick) of polymers P1–P5 deposited on a glassy carbon disc electrode (working electrode, d = 5 mm, BAS Inc.) by drop casting from 1,2-dichlorobenzene, chlorobenzene, chloroform or their mixtures. The measurements were performed in a three-electrode electrochemical cell using 0.1 M solution of Bu4NPF6 in acetonitrile as a supporting electrolyte, platinum wire as a counter electrode and a silver wire immersed in 0.01 M solution of AgNO3 in 0.1 M TBAP (CH3CN) as a reference Ag/Ag+ electrode (BAS Inc.). Ferrocene was used as an internal reference. The electrolyte solution was purged with argon before the measurements. The voltammograms were recorded using an ELINS P-30SM instrument at room temperature with a potential sweep rate of 50 mV s−1.
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
The conjugated polymers P1–P5 (7 mg) and [60]PCBM (7–28 mg) were dissolved together in 1 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene while stirring at room temperature for 48 h. Afterwards, 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was added to the blend solution to achieve 0.12 to 6.0% volume concentration. The prepared solution was filtered through a PTFE 0.45 μm syringe filter and subjected to spin-coating at 700–2100 rpm for 150 s on the top of the annealed PEDOT:PSS (Clevios HTL) films deposited on the patterned ITO electrodes (see ref. 12 for general description of the substrate preparation procedure). The obtained films were transferred immediately inside the glove box and thermally annealed in an argon atmosphere at 95 °C for 10 min. The top electrode comprising Ca (20 nm) and Ag (100 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation at the pressure below 4 × 10−6 mbar in a vacuum chamber integrated inside the MBraum glove box. The size of the active area in photovoltaic cells was ∼0.5 cm2 as it was defined by a shadow mask.
Characterization of photovoltaic devices
The current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the devices were obtained in the dark and under the simulated 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5 solar irradiation provided by a KHS Steuernagel solar simulator integrated in the MBraun glove box. The intensity of the illumination was checked every time before the measurements using a calibrated silicon diode with known spectral response. The I–V curves were recorded in an inert atmosphere using a Keithley 2400 source-measurement unit. The active areas of all devices were measured with a good accuracy just after the J–V measurements to estimate the short circuit current densities. The obtained JSC values were reconfirmed by integrating the EQE spectra against the standard AM1.5 spectrum. The EQE spectra were measured in a normal air atmosphere without applying any special encapsulation or protection to the photovoltaic devices using a specially designed setup, LOMO instruments, Russia.
