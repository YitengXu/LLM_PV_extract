However, 1T metallic MoS2 has not been explored for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In this communication, we report that a flower-structured 1T metallic phase MoS2 film was directly grown onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass as a DSSC counter electrode (CE). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the DSSC with the 1T metallic MoS2 CE exhibited an excellent power conversion efficiency of 7.08%, which is 3 times larger than that (1.72%) of the DSSC with 2H phase MoS2.
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), which are a particular class of two-dimensional (2D) layered crystals,1,2 have attracted intensive research interest over the last decade as rivals and successors of graphene.3 Layer-structured molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) is a representative TMD. Each layer of MoS2 is three atoms thick with a sandwich structure, in which a Mo atom at the middle is strongly bonded to the above and below S atoms.4,5 MoS2 has two main types of phases: 2H and 3R. Two layers per unit cell stack in hexagonal symmetry with trigonal prismatic coordination in the 2H phase, while three layers per unit cell stack in rhombohedral symmetry with trigonal prismatic coordination in the 3R phase.6 The 2H phase is more dominant in nature since it is more stable than the 3R phase. An unusual third phase, which possesses one layer per unit cell in tetragonal symmetry with octahedral coordination, is called the metastable 1T metallic phase.7 2H MoS2 is an n-type semiconductor with an indirect bandgap of 1.29 eV with a charge carrier mobility of 100 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature.8 The physical properties of 3R MoS2 are almost identical to those of 2H MoS2.9 In contrast, 1T-MoS2 is metastable and metallic because the 1T phase possesses a distorted structure that can cause a strong interaction of Mo dz,2 dxy, and pz orbitals with S pz and px orbitals to create the hybridization of orbitals, leading to the overlapping of the VB and CB without a gap.10–12 Furthermore, very recently, 1T phase MoS2 has been demonstrated as an excellent material for supercapacitors and memristors.10–12
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) is a promising third generation photovoltaic device. It can be easily and economically fabricated using a TiO2 photoanode adsorbed dye, an iodide/triiodide electrolyte (mostly redox mediator of iodide/triiodide), and a counter electrode. The counter electrode (CE) reduces the oxidized electrolyte, which is critical for high performance DSSCs.13,14 The standard CE material is platinum due to its excellent electrical conductivity and high catalytic activity. However, the application of platinum would be limited by its scarcity and high cost.15 This has stimulated intensive effort to find alternatives with low cost, rich resources, and high electrocatalytic activity, such as conducting polymers,16 carbonaceous materials,17–19 and inorganic compounds.20,21
MoS2 is an attractive material for DSSCs.22–24 Various methods were exploited to prepare MoS2 CEs, such as radio-frequency sputtering, pulsed electrochemical deposition, and hydrothermal processes.25 Furthermore, carbon materials (such as 2D graphene sheets and 1D carbon nanotubes) and polymers have been combined with MoS2 as a composite CE for DSSCs.26 However, the importance of the 1T phase in MoS2 CEs has not been explored. An ideal DSSC CE must have two functions: collecting electrons from an external circuit and catalyzing the reduction of the oxidized electrolyte (namely, the reduction of I3− to I−). Furthermore, the electro-catalytic reduction of I3− consists of two steps: (1) I3− is adsorbed on the counter electrode and (2) the adsorbed I3− obtains electrons to convert into I−. As an ionic compound, MoS2 is good for the adsorption of I3− ions. MoS2 must have excellent electrical conductivity. However, the 2H and 3R phases of MoS2 are semiconductors with poor conductivity. In contrast, the 1T phase of MoS2 is a metallic phase with excellent conductivity, which is 107 times larger than its 2H phase. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to propose that 1T metallic MoS2 would be an excellent counter electrode candidate for DSSCs. In this communication, we directly prepare a 1T metallic MoS2 film onto a FTO conductive substrate as a DSSC CE. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the DSSC with 1T metallic MoS2 CE exhibited an excellent power conversion efficiency, which is 3 times larger than that of the DSSC with 2H phase MoS2.
MoS2 films on FTO glass were synthesized via a typical hydrothermal method: 1 mmol of Na2MoO4·2H2O and 5 mmol of thiourea were dissolved in 60 ml of distilled water and stirred vigorously. Then, the obtained mixture was transferred into a 100 ml Teflon-lined autoclave. A FTO glass was placed against the wall of the autoclave. The whole system was kept for reactions at 180 (or 200 °C) for 24 h and the obtained MoS2 is denoted as MoS2-180 (or MoS2-200). Finally, the FTO glass covered with the MoS2 film was rinsed with distilled water and ethanol, and then dried in an oven at 80 °C. The structure of the synthesized MoS2 was examined by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). The MoS2-200 consists of large lumps (Fig. 1a), while the MoS2-180 shows a flower-like structure (Fig. 1b). The flower-like structure may be more favorable for the transport of electrolyte ions. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was employed to verify the phase structure of the synthesized MoS2 films. As shown in Fig. 1c and d, MoS2-200 possesses a honeycomb lattice, which is in agreement with the 2H phase, whereas the lattice of MoS2-180 is hexagonal, indicating a 1T phase structure.27 This was further confirmed by XRD measurements. The MoS2-200 shows identical reflection peaks which can be assigned to the family of lattice planes of hexagonal MoS2 (JCPDS card no. 77-1716). In contrast, the peak intensity of 1T-MoS2 significantly decreases, confirming the formation of few-layer MoS2 in the sample.28,29 The structure of the MoS2 nanosheets was also evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 2b, one can see an E1g peak at 280 cm−1 for MoS2-180, which is associated with the octahedral coordination of Mo atoms in the 1T phase MoS2.30 This indicates the presence of a 1T phase in the MoS2-180, which is further supported by the observation of other active modes (J1, J2, and J3 peaks at 145.2, 234.1, and 336.1 cm−1, respectively) being attributed to a zone-folding mechanism due to the formation of a super lattice. The Raman absorption peaks associated with the 1T phase were not clearly observed for MoS2-200. Finally, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to evaluate the composition of 1T and 2H phases of the MoS2 materials. As shown in Fig. 3, the binding energies of Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 are 228.30 and 231.44 eV for the 1T phase and 229.10 and 232.25 eV for the 2H phase, respectively (Fig. 3a and c). Similarly, the S 2p spectra can also be deconvoluted into four peaks, which are assigned to 1T-type MoS2 (S 2p3/2 at 161.0 eV and S 2p1/2 at 162.2 eV) and 2H-type MoS2 (S 2p3/2 at 161.8 eV and S 2p1/2 at 163.0 eV). Furthermore, the composition of MoS2 samples obtained from these XPS peaks is 7.59% 2H-type and 92.41% 1T-type for MoS2-180 and 3% 1T-type and 97% 2H-type for MoS2-200. This indicates that MoS2-180 and MoS2-200 are mainly 1T phase MoS2 and 2H phase MoS2, respectively. This happened probably because the 1T phase possesses a distorted structure that prefers a low temperature, whereas a higher temperature is better for the formation of the ordered 2H phase.

The 1T phase MoS2 and 2H phase MoS2 films on FTO glasses were exploited to fabricate DSSCs as counter electrodes, a N719 dye-sensitized TiO2 film on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plate as the photoelectrode, and an I−/I3− redox couple as the electrolyte. The characteristic J–V curves of the DSSCs using MoS2 counter electrodes are shown in Fig. 4a and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. The DSSC with the 1T MoS2 counter electrode exhibited a short-circuit current density (Isc) of 18.76 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 V, a fill factor (ff) of 0.52, and a power conversion efficiency (η) of 7.08% under AM 1.5 simulated sunlight illumination with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. This efficiency is 3 times higher than that (1.72%) of the DSSC with a 2H MoS2 counter electrode. Such a large difference of efficiencies between 1T and 2H phases is due to their different conductivities (namely, the conductivity of 1T MoS2 is 107 times larger than that of 2H MoS2), leading to a higher electrocatalytic activity for the 1T phase than that for the 2H one. To obtain direct information on the electrocatalytic activities for I3− reduction, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was conducted using a three-electrode electrochemical system, in which the MoS2 materials were used as the working electrodes, Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode, and Pt wire as the counter electrode in a solution consisting of 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4. Fig. 4b shows the typical redox peaks corresponding to the reduction of I3− and the oxidation of I− in the CV measurements. It is found that the cathodic peak of 2H MoS2 appears at a relatively negative potential, and its cathodic current density is lower than that of 1T MoS2, suggesting that the 2H MoS2 has a poor electrocatalytic activity. In contrast, the smaller peak to peak separation and higher peak current density of 1T MoS2 reveal its better performance. The enhanced electrocatalytic activity of the 1T MoS2 can be attributed to its superior electrical conductivity. This is further confirmed by the evaluation of electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). Two semicircles were observed in the frequency range of 0.1–100 kHz and the electrochemical parameters are summarized in Table 1. The intercept of the first semicircle represents the ohmic series resistance (Rs) related to the intrinsic resistance of the assembled cells. The first semicircle corresponds to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct1) at the CE/electrolyte interface, which is inversely proportional to the catalytic ability of the CE for the reduction of I3− to I−, whereas the semicircle in the lower frequency region is associated with the charge-transfer resistance (Rct2) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. The 1T MoS2 electrode shows smaller Rct1, indicating its higher catalytic activity. Furthermore, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves show better conversion efficiency of a DSSC with the 1T MoS2 counter electrode (Fig. 4d), which further supports the results of J–V measurements.

Conclusions
1T metallic phase MoS2 was directly grown on a FTO glass as an excellent DSSC counter electrode by a simple temperature-controlled hydrothermal method. The dye-sensitized solar cell with the 1T phase MoS2 counter electrode exhibited a much higher energy conversion efficiency (7.08%) than that (1.72%) with the 2H phase MoS2 CE.
