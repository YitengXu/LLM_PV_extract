    , Accepted 28th June 2021First published on 20th July 2021AbstractDetection of toxic gases such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S) at low temperatures is of high importance as it reduces power consumption, increases long-term stability, and lowers the danger of explosion in the presence of flammable gases. Among different gas sensors, chemiresistive metal oxide semiconductors sensors are the most popular type due to their low cost, high sensitivity, compact size, ease of use, and high thermal and mechanical stability. However, these sensors generally require a high operating temperature (>100 °C), attributed to their insufficient surface area. Hence, their pristine bulk structures cannot meet the requirements of low-temperature gas sensing. To overcome these limitations, the bulk structure of metal oxide sensors can be modified either geometrically or chemically. Herein, we comprehensively reviewed a wide range of metal oxide-based sensors for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. We highlighted the recent advances in the modifications of these sensors for enhanced gas sensing properties, such as high selectivity/sensitivity and fast response/recovery time.
1 Introduction
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas sensing is of particular concern due to its pollutant toxic and corrosive nature. Also known as sewage gas, H2S is a highly contaminating toxic gas with a fast active poison.1 It is a colorless gas with a malodorous rotten-egg smell, even at very low levels of 0.5 parts per billion (ppb) in air. It is produced from both natural- and human-based sources. The natural source of H2S generation includes the bacterial breakdown of organic matter in anaerobic environments. Thus, it can be found in petroleum, natural gas, volcanic gas, hot spring, and human and animal wastes.2 It can also be produced as a by-product of various industrial processes such as petroleum and natural gas extraction and purification, paper and pulp manufacturing, textile production, chemical manufacturing, wastewater treatment, and food processing.3 H2S gas is also heavier than air and can be collected in low-lying and enclosed areas at or below ground level, making these confined spaces hazardous for work. According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), H2S is the second most toxic gas existing in the workplace after carbon monoxide (CO). The poisonous effect of H2S upon exposure is highly dependent on its concentration, and it can be categorized into three groups, including: (1) acute exposure, >300 ppm, (2) post-acute exposure, >100 ppm, and (3) chronic exposure, <1 ppm. Acute exposure causes collapse, unconsciousness, and death, which happen due to cardiopulmonary paralysis. Post-acute exposure occurs upon exposure to lower concentrations over a long period of time, i.e., 30 min, which causes difficulty in breathing, coma, and even death.4 Chronic exposure results from exposure to less than 1 ppm of H2S gas over several days; the side-effects include nausea, headache, and skin and eye irritation.4 OSHA has developed regulations for workplace H2S exposure limits, including an 8 h exposure time limit to 10 ppm and 15 min exposure time limit to 15 ppm.
There are different mechanisms employed for the H2S detection, including surface acoustic wave (SAW),5 optical,6 and electrochemical7 methods. Among the possible available gas-sensitive materials, metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)-based sensors are the most widely used. MOS sensors are low cost, easy to fabricate, stable in the long term, and highly sensitive. They are fabricated in different geometries ranging from bulk materials to nanostructures and are easily tuned physically and chemically to meet each specific application demand, making them the most favorable option for gas detection.8 However, they usually operate at high-temperature ranges.9,10 A low operating temperature in conjunction with high sensitivity and rapid response/recovery kinetics is required for the safe and effective sensing of flammable and explosive gases such as H2S to prevent operational and health hazards during in situ monitoring. A low operating temperature also offers other advantages, such as reduced power consumption and increased long-term stability. In addition, the reduced operating temperature can further expand the gas sensors’ application in self-powered devices.11
The idea of developing self-powered devices using the conversion of other forms of energy to electrical energy to power nanosystems was first proposed by Wang et al.12 using the piezoelectric effect. The piezoelectric effect is the direct conversion of mechanical energy to electrical energy and vice versa. Wang et al.12 reported vertically-aligned ZnO nanowire arrays, which provided an open circuit voltage with 17 to 30% energy conversion efficiency. This interesting study underlined the idea of conversion of other forms of energy into electrical energy for powering nanodevices, referred to as self-powered systems. Since reporting this study, a prodigious number of efforts have been made in the development of self-powered devices using different mechanisms such as piezoelectric,13 thermoelectric,14 and triboelectric.15 These nanogenerators can also be used as power sources to provide the bias voltage of the gas sensing layer. However, if the nanogenerator itself shows gas sensing properties, it can play a dual role as a self-powered gas sensor. In this case, the sensing layer is responsible for interacting with the target gas and also providing the desired bias voltage, which might be obtained as a result of continuous bending or gas flow vibration.16 In essence, the self-powered sensing layer should work independent of any external power sources either as the bias voltage or the microheater. The idea of self-powered gas sensors is feasible only if the sensor works effectively at low temperatures, preferably room temperature. Hence, reducing the operating temperature of the gas sensors would revolutionize the self-powered gas sensing field, especially for applications such as hazardous gas detection, to prevent human exposure to hazardous environments.
MOS gas sensors belong to the chemiresistive gas sensor category. Chemiresistive gas sensors work based on the electrical conductivity change in the presence of the target gas (analyte). The extent of change in the conductivity depends on the gas type and concentration. In these types of sensors, the sensing layer directly interacts with the target gas, resulting in an alternation of the physical and chemical properties of the sensing layer. In essence, oxygen is chemisorbed on the surface of the sensing layer in the form of . As reported in the literature, chemisorbed oxygen at room temperature is in the form of O2− (see eqn (1)).17 This oxygen species acts as a surface acceptor, trapping free electrons from the conduction band, forming an electron-depleted surface layer. As the material is exposed to a reducing gas such as H2S, free electrons are released based on eqn (2). The released electrons change the sensing layer conductivity, which causes an increase or decrease in n-type (a type of semiconductor where the majority of charge carriers are electrons) and p-type (a type of semiconductor where the majority of charge carriers are holes) materials, respectively. The surface to volume ratio, which is also known as specific area (i.e., the total area at the surface that interacts with a target gas), is an important factor determining the reactivity of the material. Also, as gas sensing is a surface interaction phenomenon, the specific volume highly influences the gas sensing properties. This parameter can be improved by miniaturizing the structure dimension to nanostructures such as nanorods and nanofibers. O2(atmosphere) + e(metaloxidesurface)− → O2(ads)−(1) 2H2S(ads) + 3O2(ads)− → 2SO2 + 2H2O + 3e−(2)Gas sensors are characterized based on six criteria: (1) response value, (2) response time, (3) recovery time, (4) stability, (5) reproducibility, and (6) selectivity. The first three criteria can be obtained from one dynamic cycle, defined as a sensor, is exposed to a specific concentration of a target gas for a period of time, during which the monitored parameters reach either a peak or a minimum and then is exposed to ambient air to recover to the baseline value (i.e., the steady-state resistance of the sensor in the air). Based on the measurement setup, the monitored parameters can be resistance, conductivity, current, or voltage. The response and recovery times are defined as the time where the response reaches 90% of the total change upon exposure to a target gas and air (see Fig. 1).18,19 The response value can be defined in two different ways: (i) the ratio of the total change over the pristine value of the measured parameter, which, in this case, is usually reported in percentage , or (ii) the ratio of either the base-line over the peak magnitude and vice versa in n-type  and p-type  materials, respectively. To evaluate the selectivity of a gas sensor, the sensor is either exposed to a mixture of gases (including the target gas) or is exposed individually to different interfering gases at certain concentrations. The selectivity is examined based on the response value to the target gas compared to the response value to interfering gases. The larger the difference, the higher the selectivity of the sensor.

The vital role of metal oxides in the fabrication of H2S gas sensors seems to be indispensable due to their sensitivity, mechanical and thermal stability, and easy fabrication. They can also be used to develop self-powered gas sensors. Notably, ZnO exhibits both gas sensing and piezoelectric properties and it can be a promising option for self-powered gas sensing.11 However, despite the excellent characteristics of metal-oxide-based sensing layers, they usually have high operating temperatures, which can limit their applications in self-powered devices as these devices are independent of any external power sources, including external bias voltage or microheaters. Even if the metal oxide itself lacks nanogenerating properties, the metal oxide as the room-temperature sensing layer, functioning independent of a heater and the bias voltage, can be provided from another layer with nanogenerating properties in the sensing structure.
To date, only a few metal oxides have been applied for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. However, this challenge can be addressed by an emergent body of research centered around the modification of the MOS sensing layers via both physical (e.g., geometry and size) and chemical (e.g., doping) modifications. In the case of physical modification, as the structure sizes decrease from the micro- to the nano-scale, the specific area increases dramatically, thereby increasing the active sites in nanostructures for oxygen adsorption. Although this might increase the baseline resistance, the sensor will demonstrate higher sensitivity to target analytes due to the larger number of electrons being trapped in the depletion layer.20 Chemical modification is the second method to improve the gas sensing properties for decreased operating temperature. The main approaches for chemical modifications are the incorporation of noble metals as modifiers21 or the use of hybrid metal oxide semi-conductors.22 There are also other emergent approaches, such as the use of highly conductive nanoparticles.23
This review provides an overview of different types of MOS (including ZnO, CuO, In2O3, and WO3) reported for low-temperature gas sensing of H2S, and systematically describes their physical and chemical modification for enhanced sensing performance at low operating temperature. The methods for the physical and chemical modifications of each family of MOS are evaluated based on their specific sensing properties for lowering their operating temperature while maintaining the other sensing properties (e.g., high sensitivity). Finally, we discuss the strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities for the future development of self-powered metal oxide-based nanomaterials for H2S monitoring and safety applications.
2 ZnO
2.1 Geometrical modification
ZnO, with a wide bandgap of 3.37 eV, is a multifunctional semiconductor material.24 Promising gas sensing and piezoelectric properties, as well as non-toxicity, ease of fabrication, and high thermal and chemical stability have rendered ZnO a multifunctional material. As a result, ZnO has been used in a wide range of applications, from piezoelectric nanogenerators,25 UV sensors,26 solar cells27 to gas sensors.28 As for the latter, ZnO has been widely used in H2S gas sensing applications in different geometries and structures such as thin films,29 nanosheets,30 nanoparticles, nanorods,20,31 and nanofibers (summarized in Table 1). ZnO interaction with H2S can be described as follows. ZnO + 2H2S(ads) → ZnS + H2O(3)Nimbalkar et al.29 studied the performance of a ZnO-based thin film H2S gas sensor. The thin film was synthesized using a sol–gel spin-coating technique. The precursor solution was made by dissolving zinc acetate in ethanol. After stirring, the solution was spin-coated on a glass substrate, followed by air drying and then, annealing at 600 °C for 60 min to obtain a thin film with a thickness of 34 nm. Further analytical investigation methods such as field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) showed that the thin film was composed of spherical ZnO nanoparticles (referred to as 0D) placed closely by each other, forming a porous crystalline structure with an average size of 37 nm.29 Although the sensor had a high operating temperature of 300 °C with a relative low response of 3.25  at 100 ppm, it showed fast response and recovery times of 10 and 200 s, respectively. The rationale behind the long recovery time compared to the response time was that the gas desorption phenomenon is normally a slow process in nature.29

Changing the geometry of the particles from 0D (spherical) to 1D (nanorod or nanotube) and 2D (nanosheet) improves the gas sensing properties and decreases the operating temperature. This improvement is the result of an increase in the effective surface area. In this regard, various geometries with different specific areas, affecting gas molecule adsorption and desorption, have been reported in the literature.32,33 For instance, ZnO has been used in the form of nanorod,31 porous nanorod,20 and dendritic structure34 for H2S low-temperature gas sensing.
Shinde et al.31 reported a ZnO nanorod sensor synthesized using the spray pyrolysis method operable at low temperatures. As can be seen in Fig. 2a, the hexagonal wurtzite ZnO nanorods were fabricated with sizes ranging from 20 to 80 nm. Although the sensor showed a response of 30  at 35 °C, the highest response was obtained at 50 °C with an excellent magnitude of 61.7 upon exposure to 100 ppm of the target gas (see Fig. 2b) with a decreasing trend in the response value with a further increase in the temperature. In addition, the response magnitude increased as the gas concentration rose, as expected. At the optimum operating temperature (i.e., 50 °C), the sensor showed a significant fast response time of 4 s and a short recovery time of 60 s, as shown in Fig. 2c. The fast response may be associated with 1D nanostructure, featuring an extremely large specific area.31

Porous structures are another effective feature used for improving the gas sensing parameters, including electrical conductivity, catalytic activity, and adsorption–desorption rate.20 More importantly, the increased specific area achieved by porous structures provides a large number of active sites for oxygen adsorption. As an example, Hosseini et al.20 reported a room temperature H2S gas sensor based on porous ZnO nanorods forming a flower-like structure. The sensing layer was fabricated by heating ZnO and graphite powder in a horizontal tube furnace. The fabricated porous nanorods were 300–500 nm in diameter and 7–9.5 μm in length (see Fig. 2d). It was shown that the synthesized aggregated flower-like ZnO nanorods, due to their porous nature, had a large specific area.20 As shown in Fig. 2e, the sensor was sensitive at room temperature with response magnitudes as high as 296 and 581  upon exposure to 1 and 5 ppm H2S, respectively. Interestingly, the study reported that the sensor response decreased with the temperature elevation and is attributed to two factors: (1) the increase in charge carriers due to larger inter-gaps being ionized below the conduction band, and (2) facilitation of phonon-assisted tunneling.20 The latter can cause a decrease in the resistance of ZnO as an n-type semiconductor. As a result, the response dramatically decreased to 2.4 and 3.7 for 1 and 5 ppm H2S at 250 °C, respectively. The obtained response time and recovery time were 320 and 3592 s at room temperature, respectively. However, at elevated temperatures, decomposition, adsorption, and desorption processes sped up. Thus, both response time and recovery time were faster at 250 °C, i.e., 27 and 77 s, respectively. In addition, the sensing layer was highly selective to H2S with almost 300 times higher response upon exposure to interfering gases, including CH4, CO, methanol, H2, acetone, ethanol, and He20 (see Fig. 2f). The sensor was also reliably stable over 5 months of storage in air. The increased stability can be attributed to the highly ordered structure of the nanorods. Taken together, the porous structures have shown to significantly enhance the response value at decreased operating temperatures compared to pristine ZnO nanorods. However, the recovery time of porous nanorods was longer than that of the pristine nanorod, which can be attributed to the entrapment of the target gas within its porous structure.
In addition to the aforementioned structures, there are a few novel geometries reported in recent studies. These engineered nanostructures are aimed at obtaining the desired nanostructure geometry in terms of the large surface area (for high response magnitude) and fast response/recovery process. As an example, Zhang et al.34 reported a dendritic ZnO nanostructure for H2S room temperature gas sensing. The sensor was fabricated using a horizontal tube furnace. The structure included a main trunk with branches grown in the preferred growth orientation. These parallel branches ranged from 60 to 800 nm in diameter and oriented at an angle of 60° (with respect to the trunk). The crystal structure of the sensing layer was half-octahedral with pyramidal faces. The faces were either (0001) or (000−1), which were terminated by Zn and O, respectively. Because the Zn-terminated face is chemically more active, the possible preferred orientation growth of the branches was (0001). As the growth process continued, the branches were thickened conjugated with the formation of the interconnected network as the final structure. The all-direction-grown structure provided a large surface area, making it suitable for gas sensing applications. Thus, at a low operating temperature of 30 °C and upon exposure to 10, 50, 100, and 150 ppm of H2S, the response values of 3.3, 11.5, 17.3, and 26.4  were obtained, respectively. As another positive effect of the increased surface area, the response was fast both in terms of the response time and recovery time, i.e., 15–20 s and 30–50 s, respectively.34 The response of the innovative dendritic structure was slightly higher compared to that obtained for the pristine nanorod sample, i.e., 3.3 and ∼2.8 for dendritic ZnO and ZnO nanorods, respectively. Although the nanorod structure was smaller than the dendritic structure in terms of the dimensions, the ordered structure of dendritic ZnO provided a larger surface area, overshadowing the effect of smaller dimensions.
Wang et al.30 are among the first groups to investigate the performance of 2D ZnO nanosheets for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. Nanosheet fabrication involved the preparation of ZnO powder synthesized by dissolving zinc nitrate salt in NaOH, followed by stirring, washing, and drying. Then, the prepared powder was mixed with terpineol to obtain a paste-like material. The paste was then coated on an alumina substrate using screen printing. The fabricated nanosheets were 30 nm thick on average, with almost even thickness throughout the sensing layer. These nanosheets were prone to aggregation and, as a result, formed spheres in a size range of 1–5 μm.30 The highest response obtained for the synthesized nanosheets was at 70 °C with a magnitude of 23 . The sensor was still sensitive at 60 °C with an acceptable response of 17. Despite these promising properties combined with a linear response and acceptable stability and selectivity, the sensor demonstrated a relatively slow response and recovery times of 252 s and 3697 s at 70 °C, respectively.30 Although the expected surface area of a 2D material (nanosheets) is larger than a 3D material (nanorod), the large dimension of the aggregated nanosheets resulted in reduced surface area and thus poor sensing properties.
Overall, compared to thin films, the larger surface area of the nanorods enhanced the response value by about 3.5 times upon exposure to 100 ppm H2S. Moreover, due to the existence of more active sites, both the response and recovery processes were faster. Therefore, increasing the surface area of ZnO via physical modification can significantly improve its gas sensing properties, namely, response value, response time, recovery time, and selectivity. A further increase in the surface area can be achieved through the incorporation of porous structures (e.g., porous nanorods). However, the porous structure might slow down the kinetics of the recovery reaction due to the entrapment of the target gas in the pores. Moreover, innovative nanostructure can be designed to feature larger surface area as the surface area plays an important role in the extent of the enhancement.
2.2 Chemical modification
ZnO nanostructures have been chemically modified for enhanced H2S gas sensing properties in different approaches. These approaches include modification with noble metals, n-type semiconductors, transition metals, and incorporation of an n-type and p-type modifier (summarized in Table 1). Noble metals are one of the most promising candidates for the chemical surface modification of ZnO gas sensors. These materials form surface nano-Schottcky junctions, creating an additional depleted layer on the ZnO surface. They also act as a spill-over catalyst by facilitating dissociation of the oxygen molecules, thereby creating more active sites for gas adsorption, which further enhances the sensitivity (see Fig. 3).20 Due to this dual role, the chemical modification of ZnO with noble metals such as Ag and Au can be an effective strategy for improving the sensor response to a target gas. Wang et al.35 reported an Ag-modified ZnO nanostructure for H2S sensing. ZnO nanoparticles with the size of 100 nm were rather uniformly covered with 3–5 nm Ag nanoparticles. The optimum sensor operating temperature was reported to be 120 °C. A response as high as 15 toward 1 ppm H2S was obtained, which was about 5 times higher than that obtained using pure ZnO nanoparticles.35 The highest response was 298  toward 100 ppm gas at the optimum operating temperature. The improved response was attributed to the sensitization and spill-over effect of the Ag nanoparticles, resulting in an increased number of trapped electrons from the ZnO conduction band and an increased number of adsorbed oxygens.35
 Fig. 3  Schematic of the H2S gas sensing mechanism and the effect of noble metal coating. 
Au nanoparticles are reported to enhance the response time, linearity, and selectivity of ZnO nanostructured gas sensors36 due to their chemical and physical stability36 and surface plasmon resonance (SPR).37 Hosseini et al.38 reported an Au-modified ZnO flower-like nanorod structure for low-temperature H2S sensing. Rather vertically-aligned ZnO nanorods were fabricated using a vapor-phase transport (VTP) method with an average diameter and length of 250 nm and 10 μm, respectively (see Fig. 4a). The Au layer was sputtered on top of the ZnO nanostructures at different thicknesses ranging from 3 to 15 nm.38 As it can be seen in Fig. 4b, the thickness increased and so did the sensor response magnitude to the target gas due to the presence of more active and catalytic sites. However, a further increase in the thickness (above 15 nm) showed a negative impact on the sensing properties because the growth of Au nanoparticles both in the number and size led to the formation of interconnected conductive channels on the surface. A 6 nm Au layer produced the best response, with a response magnitude of 475  for 3 ppm H2S at room-temperature, which was 5 times greater than that of the pure nanorod sample (see Fig. 4c). However, the increased magnitude of the response resulted in a rather poor performance in terms of the response time and recovery time. The response time was reported to be 11 min and recovery took an even longer time (20 min). With regards to the stability, the sensor was observed to be stable over a period of 30 days with only 2.5% response variation.38

In a similar study, Ramgir et al.21 developed a ZnO nanowire-based sensor modified with spin-coated Au nanoparticles operatable at room temperature. Fabricated nanowires with quasi-hexagonal structures were 50–250 nm and 1–2 μm in diameter and length, respectively (see Fig. 4d). The short length of the nanowires reduced the specific area, resulting in a smaller response magnitude but faster response time. The response was 38 and 79.4  toward 1 and 5 ppm, respectively, with a fast recovery of 170 s toward 5 ppm target gas (see Fig. 4e).21
Doping ZnO with an n-type semi-conductor is another effective approach to enhance its gas sensing properties. One of the best n-type modifiers with great H2S gas sensing properties is indium oxide (In2O3). Although, in the case of ZnO, n-type modifiers do not improve the sensing properties (especially the response value) with the same margin as p-type modifiers, they can be beneficial to the structure in other ways such as speeding up the kinetics of the response and recovery processes. The n-type modified ZnO nanostructures can be fabricated in different geometries such as flower-like nanocomposites. In an interesting example, Sun et al.39 developed a ZnO/In2O3 mesoporous flower-like composite for room temperature gas sensing. The sensor was fabricated by adding different contents (i.e., mass percentages) of indium in a precursor solution of ZnO. The resultant material was filtered, washed, and dried several times, and finally heated to obtain the final product in the powder form. The fabricated powder was then mixed with ethyl alcohol to form a paste. The desired sensor was finally prepared by coating fork-shape electrodes with the paste, followed by drying for several hours. The final structure consisted of rather uniform particles with a size of 2 μm with an average diameter of 2.6 nm (see Fig. 4f).39 The investigation of the response magnitude as a function of the gas concentration in Fig. 4g shows the increasing trend of the response value as the analyte concentration increases. Hence, the maximum response value was 10.2  upon exposure to 100 ppm H2S. However, the sensing layer was still sensitive to 1 ppm H2S, despite the low response magnitude of 1.17. The improved response value of the ZnO/In2O3 mesoporous flower can be attributed to both the increased surface area and surface n–n junctions. These n–n junctions decrease the width of the electron transmission channel, and thereby increase the baseline value, while they increase the sensitivity toward the target gas. The improved response was observed to be stable over four dynamic cycles. Upon exposure to 100 ppm H2S, 146 and 214.5 s were reported as the response time and recovery time, respectively. The fast response/recovery time was attributed to the presence of indium oxide (In2O3). The existence of In2O3 enhanced the kinetics of the response and recovery reaction because the sulphuration reaction of In2O3 upon exposure to H2S is both fast and easily reversible at room temperature.39 As a result of the enhanced sensitivity, the ZnO-based sensing layer had higher selectivity toward H2S. As is shown in Fig. 4h, the response value to H2S was approximately 10 times higher than the exposure to oxynitride, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, and ethyl alcohol, demonstrating a significant improvement in selectivity compared to pristine ZnO.39
The third approach for improving the gas sensing properties of ZnO by chemical modification is the use of transition metals such as Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni. In a recent study, Suresh Kumar et al.40 fabricated Mn-doped ZnO nanoparticles for room temperature gas sensing. The sensor was fabricated by spin coating the Mn-doped ZnO gel on an alumina substrate. Using the sol–gel method, the sensing layer was fabricated to have a high purity hexagonal wurtzite structure with 40–95 nm homogeneously distributed grains. The Mn-doped structure was less prone to aggregation with finer particle size distribution. Although the optimum operating temperature of the sensor was 150 °C, the sensor was still sensitive at 50 °C with an excellent response value of 35  toward 5 ppm H2S.40
The final emergent strategy for further enhancing the gas sensing properties of ZnO is to employ more than one modifier in the structure. An interesting example is the work conducted by Shao et al.,41 where they reported SnO2 quantum nanoparticle/graphene quantum dots as ZnO nanosheet modifiers for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. First, a layer of Zn was sputtered on interdigitated finger arrays of Au electrodes. Then, ZnO layer was fabricated using a hydrothermal method on the Zn seed layer. As the next step, SnCl4 was mixed with ethanol in the presence of graphene quantum dots. Under constant stirring, HCl was added in a dropwise manner to the Sn precursor solution. Finally, the obtained material was spin-coated on a ZnO nanorod substrate, and then dried under 95% humidity at 150 °C for 12, 24, 48, and 72 h, named as GSZ1, GSZ2, GSZ3, and GSZ4, respectively, followed by heating up to 400 °C for 2 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that the as-grown ZnO nanorods were 300–400 nm in diameter. However, after spin-coating of the Sn precursor solution, these nanorods reacted with HCl, forming ZnCl2. During calcination under 95% humidity, the existing humidity reacted with both ZnCl2 and SnCl4, resulting in the formation of ZnO and SnO2, respectively. Therefore, after 12 h of calcination, ZnO nanosheets started to appear (Fig. 5a).41 As is shown in Fig. 5b, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks confirmed the existence of wurtzite ZnO and tetragonal rutile SnO2. Moreover, the grain size calculation using the Debye–Scherrer method showed that the grain size increased with the calcination time, e.g., 6, 8, 12, and 13 nm for GSZ1, GSZ2, GSZ3, and GSZ4, respectively (the pristine ZnO grain size was reported to be 26 nm). A comparison of the grain sizes of GSZ4 with that of the pristine ZnO revealed that the SnO2 nanoparticles confined the ZnO grain growth.41

The investigation of the trade-off between the grain size, surface energy, and conductivity verified that GSZ3 had the best performance for gas sensing with the response of 15.9 , and 14 and 13 s response time and recovery time, respectively, toward 100 ppb H2S (see Fig. 5c). These sensing properties are among the best reported in the literature. The principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to investigate the selectivity of the sensor. As is shown in Fig. 5d, upon exposure to 25 ppb to 5 ppm methanol, isopropanol, ether, acetone, formaldehyde, toluene, and H2S, the response was fully distinguishable toward H2S. Heterojunctions between n-type ZnO, n-type SnO2, and p-type GQD, along with exceptional geometrical features, were attributed to be the main factors behind the outstanding H2S sensing properties of this hybrid structure.41
Overall, the ZnO-based sensing layer has proven to be a promising candidate for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. Both physical and chemical modifications can significantly improve the gas sensing properties. However, there are still some challenges associated with ZnO-based sensors. In physical modification, the available surface area is a key parameter. Therefore, the effective enhancement of the gas sensing properties, including a reduction in the limit of detection, response, and recovery time, will require the modification of the nanostructure geometries to achieve larger specific area, i.e., narrower and lengthier nanorods. The fabrication of porous nanostructures is a promising method for increasing the surface area, and thus, the sensing properties. However, it should be borne in mind that the pore sizes should be optimized to avoid interference with the recovery process.
The chemical treatment of the ZnO nanostructure, on the other hand, could result in a more satisfying enhancement in the sensing properties. p-type semiconductors can be excellent modifiers. The reason is that the p–n heterojunctions benefit the structure by thickening the depletion layer and increasing the sensitivity as exposed to a target gas. This synergy does not happen in an n–n heterojunction. The p-type modification of ZnO is a nascent research area, and further studies are required to determine the effectiveness of the modification. Chemical treatment with noble metals, such as Pd and Au, could also significantly improve the sensing properties, including the response value and response/recovery kinetics. However, due to the lack of studies on their effect on the performance of ZnO-based H2S sensors, the efficacy of such materials is yet to be understood.
3 CuO
3.1 Geometrical modification
CuO is a p-type semiconductor material with a narrow band gap of 1.4 eV. It has several advantageous properties, such as high thermal stability, high catalyst activity, and non-toxicity. It can be synthesized with different structural and morphological characteristics to meet the needs of the desired application. Therefore, it has a wide range of applications, including in optical sensors,42 solar cells,43 electrochemical sensors,44 and gas sensors.45 This material has been used to detect a variety of gases, from volatile organic compounds (VOCs)46 to hazardous gases.47 Despite the good gas sensing properties, including high sensitivity, CuO-based sensing layers have a high operating temperature. The high working temperature results in high power consumption and low stability. It was shown that a lower operating temperature can be obtained by manipulating the physical and chemical structure of CuO (summarized in Table 2).48 However, there is a tradeoff between the low operating temperature and sensor performance.

The main drawback of low-temperature CuO-based sensing layers is the long and even irreversible recovery time. As CuO is exposed to H2S, superficial CuS is formed. CuS oxidization happens at temperatures as high as 220 °C. Although CuS is slowly oxidized in air, the response is almost irreversible. One solution to fully recover the sensor is to apply an electric pulse to raise the temperature to the desired value and recover the sensor.49 As an example, Wu et al.49 reported a CuO-based sensor with a microflower and surface micro-spindle structures. The hydrothermally fabricated nanoflowers ranged from 2 to 2.5 μm in diameter with 800 nm long spindles on the surface. The response and the operating temperature (for exposure to 1 ppm H2S) were found to be inversely related to each other, with the optimum operating temperature of 25 °C. As the temperature decreased, the surface desorption rates increased, resulting in a weaker reaction efficiency on the surface. At an optimum temperature, the response was 9.92  with a response time of 130 s. However, the main problem was the slow recovery time. After passing 1650 s, the sensor only recovered to 20% of its base value. To fully recover the sensor, a 10 second pulse for 130 s was applied to raise the temperature to 300 °C. Despite the fact that an electric pulse was needed for recovery, the sensor showed an acceptable short-term stability toward 1 ppm H2S for four dynamic cycles, with each cycle recovering at 300 °C. Although the systems did not exhibit a significant selectivity, the sensor was able to detect the target gas at ppb-level concentrations, e.g., response value of 1.42 toward 50 ppb target gas.49
To further enhance the sensing properties, including the limit of detection, the CuO nanostructure can be tuned to achieve optimized porosity. Interestingly, the porous structure can also change the characteristic of the CuO-based sensing layer from p-type to n-type. In a recent study, Li et al.1 fabricated a porous CuO nanosheet for room temperature H2S gas sensing using a hydrothermal method. The fabricated nanosheets were about 0.5 μm in width and 1.5 μm in length, and the pore sizes ranged from 5 to 17 nm in the diameter (see Fig. 6a). According to the UV-Vis investigations, the structure band gap was 3.08 eV, which was remarkably greater than that of the CuO bulk sample (i.e., about 1.85 eV50), having a direct influence on the surface adsorption, and thus, gas sensing.1 The sensor response as a function of analyte concentration at room temperature shows magnitudes of 1.25 and 5.01 upon 10 and 200 ppb H2S, respectively, presenting ppb-level detection of the sensing layer (see Fig. 6b). The formation of CuS at the surface upon exposure to H2S decreased the resistance by increasing the connectivity between the CuO nanosheet neighbors. Moreover, the porous structure facilitated the adsorption/desorption process, and hence, CuS transformation, resulting in rapid response and recovery times,1 as illustrated in Fig. 6c. The response/recovery times were measured to be 336/543 s upon exposure to 200 ppb gas, which are among the fastest data reported in the literature for such a sensor.1 The fast recovery can also be attributed to the porous structure that facilitated molecular diffusion/desorption. Owing to this property, the sensor also functioned well in terms of the reproducibility. The obtained response was stable through five dynamic cycles toward 200 ppb H2S with long-term stability over a month (with only less than a 5% response drift). As shown in Fig. 6d, the sensor was selective toward H2S with 5 times higher response to H2S compared to other gases.1

As it can be seen in Fig. 6, the sensing mechanism for this porous structure is not among the commonly reported  value for a p-type semi-conductor, i.e., the resistance decreased upon exposure to H2S. In p-type semiconductors, the conductivity decreases upon exposure to reducing gases, while the opposite was measured in this study. As mentioned, p-type CuO is converted to metallic CuS upon exposure to H2S (see eqn (4)). The formed CuS covers the CuO surface and continues to relocate CuO with CuxS in the sublayers. Thus, due to the metallic-like nature of CuS, the conductivity increases and resistance decreases upon exposure to H2S.1 CuO(s) + H2S(g) → CuS(s) + H2O(g)(4)
In another study, Li et al.51 reported a flower-like porous nanosheet for H2S gas sensing using a porous nanostructure. The sensing layer was fabricated using a hydrothermal method on a tubular alumina substrate. Based on the SEM images, 60 nm thick nanosheets were aggregated in flower-like structures with the pores ranging from 20 to 160 nm in diameter (Fig. 7a). The mechanism of the formation of the 2D plate-like structures can be explained as follows: NH3·H2O was added dropwise to the precursor solution containing Cu ions. The resultant chemical reaction can be described as Cu2+ + 4NH3 → [(CuNH3)4]2+(5)The product of the above reaction, which is favorable for the formation of a 2D structure, reacted with hydroxide ion in the precursor solution, forming the layered Cu(OH)2. [(CuNH3)4]2+ transports Cu2+ ions to where the OH− ligands were attached. This assembly released NH3 and as time elapsed, formed long chains. These chains further grew laterally, forming the final nanosheet structure.51,52 The sensor response as a function of the gas concentration ranging from 100 ppb to 20 ppm at room temperature is shown in Fig. 7b. The results show that the sensor was sensitive down to the ppb level with a linear response. The response magnitude upon exposure to 1 ppm was reported 2.01 with 240 and 1341 s as the response and recovery times, respectively (see Fig. 7c), which are among the slowest reported in the literature. The obtained response was stable over 5 dynamic cycles and reproducible over 30 days with less than 3% drift.51

The pore size is one of the most important parameters in the determination of the nanostructured gas sensing properties. While the porous structure can facilitate the adsorption/desorption process, the large pore sizes might trap the H2S gas molecules and interfere with the recovery process. An excellent example is the comparison between porous CuO nanosheets and flower-like porous CuO nanosheets where the pore sizes were reported to be 5–17 and 20–160 nm, respectively. Smaller pore sizes decreased the recovery time from 1341 s down to 543 s.
CuO nanostructures with a large surface area such as spindle-like and nanosheet structures can be efficient candidates for the room-temperature sensing of H2S at the ppb level. However, the long recovery process still remains their major problem. As discussed, CuO-based sensing layers suffer a long recovery process due to the slow oxidation of CuS in air. Hence, the CuO-based sensors normally do not recover at room temperature. The introduction of a porous nanostructure can facilitate the desorption process, therefore improving the sensor recovery at room-temperature, as well as lowering the limit of detection down to the ppb level. However, the optimization of the pore size still remains a key challenge. In conclusion, CuO nanostructures with a large surface area can be efficient candidates for sensing ppb levels of H2S. However, the long recovery process still remains their major problem.
3.2 Chemical modification
The CuO gas sensing properties can be improved by chemical modification with noble metals, metal oxides, and graphene-based materials (summarized in Table 2). Due to the strong catalytic role of noble metals, they can be used to modify CuO, reducing the operating temperature and enhancing the gas sensing properties. For instance, Au-modified CuO layers are widely used for hazardous and volatile gas detection.45,53 Pd is another noble metal that is used to improve the H2S sensing properties. PdO is a p-type semiconductor with a high intrinsic hole concentration. Using Pd as the modifier, the obtained high conductivity from Pd at room temperature can reduce the sensing layer operating temperature. As an example, Kim et al.54 reported a Pd-doped CuO nanowire for H2S gas sensing. CuO nanowires were fabricated by the thermal oxidation method on a patterned interdigital electrode (PIE) on a Si substrate. The tri-layer PIE included 1 μm Cu as the sensing layer source, 50 nm Pt as the electrode pathway, and 200 nm Ti as the adjacent substrate to the Pt electrode. To dope the nanowires with Pd, the sample was immersed in PdCl2 solution, followed by UV radiation and annealing at 500 °C. According to FESEM characterization results, the modified CuO nanowires were fabricated with an average diameter of 35–45 nm, providing a large surface area (see Fig. 8a).54 The sensor response as a function of the operating temperature upon exposure to 100 ppm H2S showed a response magnitude of 1.196 at room temperature (see Fig. 8b), which further increased to 1.962 (as the highest response at 100 °C). As can be concluded from Fig. 8b, CuO modification by Pt decreased the optimum operating temperature from 300 °C to 100 °C in conjunction with an increase in the response magnitude. The enhancement was attributed to the spill-over effect.55 Another positive effect of this modification is an enhancement in the selectivity of the sensor. As is shown in Fig. 8c, the increased response value upon exposure to H2S conjugated with the decreased response value upon exposure to the interfering gases confirms the improvement in the selectivity of the sensor. Regarding the sensing layer stability, the sensor was reported to be stable for over 6 months with a negligible response drift, which is among the longest stability durations reported in the literature.54

(f) Dynamic response of the optimum sensing layer showing a fast response time with an inability of full recovery at 80 °C. Reproduced from ref. 56. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. 
In a similar study, Hu et al.56 reported a Pd-doped CuO microflower as a low-temperature H2S gas sensor. Both pristine and Pd-doped CuO samples were fabricated using a hydrothermal method. According to FESEM investigation, the pristine CuO sample lacked uniformity. However, after the addition of the optimum ratio of Pd, the sample was homogenous. As is shown in Fig. 8d, the sample consisted of evenly distributed CuO nanosheets (with an average of 200 nm), aggregating in a flower-like form with an average size of 400 nm.56 The response as a function of operating temperature upon exposure to 50 ppm H2S shows the highest response at 80 °C (see Fig. 8e). Also, among different loadings of Pd, 1.25 wt% was the optimum concentration, conferring the highest response of 123.4, which is 15.7 times greater than that of the pristine CuO sample. The response decreased with a further increase in the operating temperature, which is attributed to the increased intrinsic carrier concentration of CuO. The transient characteristic of the sensor in Fig. 8f shows that unlike the fast 8 s response time, the response recovered only to 8% of the maximum value after 3500 s. To fully recover the sensor, an electric current pulse was applied to increase the sensing layer temperature to 300 °C. Following this procedure, responses were stable for five dynamic cycles. Obtaining a distinguishable response between H2S and NH3 is a struggling issue with many H2S gas sensors. However, this sensing layer was able to provide 43 times higher response magnitude to H2S compared to NH3 upon exposure to the same gas concentration, confirming the high selectivity toward H2S.56
In addition to modification with noble metals, employing highly conductive nanoparticles can be helpful for tuning the sensing layer conductivity. As an example, Fu57 fabricated a CuS-doped CuO nanoparticle for H2S and NH3 gas sensing applications. CuS is a p-type semiconductor widely used in ethanol, acetone, and ammonia gas sensing.58 With low resistance, it balances the sensing layer conductivity upon mixing with CuO. As reported in ref. 57, CuS was prepared by two different methods: (1) the addition of the Na2S solution, and (2) injection of H2S gas into the copper acetate solution. The preparation was then followed by stirring, washing, and drying to obtain the CuS powder.57 For sensing layer fabrication, the CuO powder was mechanically mixed with prepared CuS in a PVA solution at different ratios. The obtained paste was sprayed onto an alumina oxide tube and dried for 2 h, resulting in a 20 μm-thick sensing layer. The sensor response was measured as a function of H2S concentration at different bias voltages. The responses were obtained in the presence of a single target gas. Overall, the samples containing CuS prepared by H2S showed higher responses than those containing CuS prepared by Na2S. This can be attributed to the smaller size of the particles prepared by H2S, resulting in a larger surface area.57 The best response was obtained at 8 V with a magnitude of 3139 at 1.5% vol. of H2S. In terms of the selectivity, the second-highest response was measured upon exposure to NH3 with a magnitude of 199. Although the sensors prepared with H2S showed higher response magnitudes, the ones prepared with NH3 showed higher selectivity. Moreover, both the sensors were able to distinguish either H2S or NH3 in a gas mixture. However, only the sensor prepared with Na2S was able to distinguish between H2S and NH3 in a gas mixture containing both the gases.57
Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is another material used for gas sensing purposes. MoS2 is a two-dimensional layered transition metal dischalcogenides (TMD) with a narrow direct band gap of 1.8 eV.59 Owing to the excellent properties such as a high surface to volume ratio and high carrier mobility, it has been reported to enhance the gas sensing properties60 and to detect hazardous gases such as NO2,61 H2,62 and NH3.63 It has also been reported to improve the performance of H2S gas sensors.64 As an example, Zhang et al.64 reported a CuO nanorod/MoS2 nanosheet composite for room temperature H2S sensing. Both nanorods and nanosheets were fabricated using a hydrothermal method. The sensing layer was obtained via the layer-by-layer self-assembly method. CuO and MoS2 suspensions were prepared and five by-layers of 1:1 CuO/MoS2 were deposited on the surface as the sensing layer (see Fig. 9a). After the deposition of each layer, the sensor was washed with DI water and dried with N2 for a better interconnection of the layers.64 The response value upon exposure to 30 ppm H2S was 61% with 26 and 18 s response and recovery times, respectively, signifying an improvement in the gas sensing properties (see Fig. 9b). Both the response time and recovery time have significantly decreased in the composite sample compared to the pristine CuO nanorods. The reason behind this improvement is the enlarged surface area provided by MoS2 and p–n junctions formed at the MoS2/CuO interface. The response was reproducible for four dynamic cycles upon exposure to 30, 10, and 0.5 ppm H2S. Moreover, when exposed to interfering gases, the response to H2S was at least 15 times higher, showing its high selectivity toward H2S.64

Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is one of the graphene derivatives. rGO, has received special attention because it has high carrier mobility and electrical conductivity. Thus, it facilitates gas adsorption and desorption, improving the recovery properties of the CuO-based sensing layers. Moreover, the sensing properties can be improved by the synergic effect of the nanostructured MOS and rGO, i.e., the high sensitivity of MOS nanostructures and ultra-high carrier mobility of rGO. Assuming the fact that the components have different Fermi levels, coming together in a composite form, electrons and holes are transferred from CuO to rGO and from rGO to CuO, respectively, to obtain equilibrium in the Fermi levels. This thickens the hole accumulated layer at the interface and enhances the sensitivity as the layer is exposed to a reducing gas.
Yin et al.65 reported a CuO/rGO composite for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. First, GO was synthesized using Hummers’ method. Next, copper acetate was dissolved in the GO aqueous solution in different mass ratios. The resultant suspension was then radiated, washed, and freeze-dried to obtain the final composite in a powder form. Crystal-like clusters of 100 nm, formed by the aggregation of 5–10 nm CuO nanoparticles, were evenly distributed on the rGO nanosheets (see Fig. 9c). The response as a function of the operating temperature for different composite ratios is shown in Fig. 9d, revealing 8-CuO@rGO as the optimum composite ratio upon exposure to 5 ppm H2S at 100 °C.65 With approximately a seven-fold improvement compared to pristine CuO, the highest response was 28. Although the optimum operating temperature was 100 °C, the optimum structure was still sensitive to H2S at 50 °C with an acceptable response magnitude of ∼10. The response and recovery times were reported to be 20 and 920 s, respectively, at 100 °C. These values increased to 78 and 1500 s (as the response time and recovery time, respectively) at 50 °C.65 Hence, elevating the operating temperature improved the response of the CuO/rGO composite both in terms of the response magnitude, response, and recovery times.
To sum up, the CuO-based sensing layers are potentially good candidates for H2S gas sensing; however, the current understanding of the efficacy of both the physical and chemical modification methods for enhancing their sensing properties toward H2S is limited. For instance, the modification of CuO with Au can be a promising enhancement for the H2S sensing application due to its high catalytic activity and high carrier mobility. Another missing piece of this puzzle is modification with an n-type material such as ZnO. Although p–n junctions have been reported to significantly enhance the gas sensing properties, they have not been deeply investigated in CuO-based structures for H2S gas sensing applications. There are other challenges associated with CuO-based sensing layers, including the recovery process, which could potentially be addressed by a combination of physical and chemical modification methods.
4 In2O3
4.1 Geometrical modification
In2O3 is an important n-type III–V semiconductor with a wide bandgap of 3.6 eV. In2O3 shows excellent gas sensing properties resulting from great catalytic performance. In2O3 has been fabricated in different geometries (e.g., porous thin film,66 nanorod,67 nanowire,68 and nanofiber69) to detect H2,70 NO2,71 CO,72 and ethanol73). It has also been widely reported for H2S gas sensing (summarized in Table 3). Unlike other metal oxide-based gas sensors, most of the In2O3-based sensing layers have low operating temperatures. As an example, Bari et al.74 fabricated In2O3 thin film for low-temperature H2S sensing. The films were fabricated using a spray pyrolysis method at various thicknesses (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 nm) by manipulating the deposition time. The final structure consisted of roughly spherical particles with an average size of 36 nm along with large clusters (due to particle aggregation). The sample with 30 nm thickness showed the highest sensitivity of 79% at the optimum operating temperature of 50 °C upon exposure to 500 ppm target gas. The structure was selective to H2S in a mixture of seven interfering gases. Moreover, the response was reported to be stable for only three cycles with a fast response time and recovery time of 4 and 8 s, respectively. These magnitudes are among the fastest ones reported in low-temperature sensing applications. The high and fast response can be attributed to the porous-like structure of the thin film, providing a large surface area.74

To further enhance the gas sensing properties of the thin film structure, including the optimum working temperature and response value, the surface area should be further increased. An ordered nanoparticle structure rather than randomly aggregated nanoparticles can help to improve the specific area. An example is a recent study conducted by Wang et al.,75 in which the reported sensing layer was a micro-nanoporous In2O3 thin film for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. First, the pre-structured colloidal template was fabricated using a self-assembly method on a glass substrate. Then, the template was dip-coated in an indium nitrate precursor solution. The dip-coated template was then placed into a pre-fabricated electrode alumina tube, followed by calcination at 300 °C to form the final ordered thin-film structure.75 According to TEM and FESEM images, In2O3 nanoparticles were fabricated with an average size of 20 nm, aggregated in the template form (see Fig. 10a). In order to study the gas sensing properties of the fabricated sensors, first, the response was measured as a function of the analyte concentration at room temperature. As is shown in Fig. 10b, the sensor was almost saturated after exposure to 1 ppm, and for higher concentrations, the response was independent of the analyte concentration. The sensor dynamic response was also studied upon exposure to 50 ppm H2S. Although the sensor response was rather fast, i.e., 140 s, it did not fully recover at room temperature (Fig. 10c). Even after 4500 s, the sensor still did not get back to the baseline value. It was finally fully recovered after being heated up to 300 °C.75

There are different parameters that determine the final structure of the metal oxide, such as the agents and their proportional ratios in the precursor solution, the calcination time, and temperature. As an example, Xu et al.76 studied the differences in the gas sensing properties of porous nanotubes and porous nanowires arrays. Both the structures were fabricated with almost the same procedure, i.e., dissolving an appropriate amount of indium nitrate in DMF, followed by the addition of a certain amount of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), to make the desired In/PVP ratio. Afterwards, the fabrication process continued by vigorous spinning and then loading the In/PVP suspension in a plastic syringe for electrospinning. The resultant fibers were dried and annealed, forming the final structure. Before the heat treatment, the structure consisted of fibers with diameters of 250, 300, and 350 nm, depending on the In/PVP ratio. However, after the heat treatment and as the In/PVP ratio increased, the continuous fiber structure shrunk to nanotubes and nanowires with diameters of 80 and 120 nm, respectively. The final geometry, i.e., nanotubes or nanowires, depended on the In/PVP ratio.76 For instance, as it can be seen in Fig. 11a, for the ratio of 0.36, nanotubes were obtained with a wall thickness of 15 nm. Another main parameter in determining the final structure was the annealing temperature. As the annealing temperature increased, the reaction rate at the inner sites was higher than the reaction rate at the outer sites. As a result, the inner ones expanded and formed nanotubes, while the outer particles shrunk.

The sensor responses as a function of the operating temperature for different In2O3 nanostructures are shown in Fig. 11b. There is an inverse relationship between the response magnitude and the operating temperature in both the nanotubes and nanowires, making room temperature the optimum operating temperature. Both the nanotubes and nanowires showed high response to 20 ppm H2S, reported as 166.6 and 141.1 , respectively. The sensing layer was found to be selective to H2S in the presence of 20 ppm interfering gases (see Fig. 11c).76 In addition to long-term stability over 140 days, the response and the recovery reactions were rather fast. The response/recovery times of 289 s/636 s and 199 s/317 s were obtained for the nanotubes and nanowires, respectively, and the values increased with temperature. The reason for this increase in the recovery/response time with temperature can be attributed to the fact that the reaction barrier height increases with temperature, requiring more energy to overcome the barriers. As a result, the response and recovery kinetics were slower at higher temperatures.76
In a similar study, Duan et al.77 reported a toruloid In2O3 nanotube for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. The electrospinning method was used to fabricate the nanotubes. A novel method was suggested by the authors regarding the preparation of the precursor solution, i.e., the addition of mineral oil. After dissolving indium nitrate in 2 g DMF and 4 g ethanol, 0.002 and 0.004 g mineral oil was added to the solution, named as TNTs-1 and TNTs-2, respectively. For the sake of a better comparison, nanofibers were also fabricated using the same method but without the mineral oil. The response value was investigated upon exposure to 50 ppm H2S as a function of the operating temperature. The response value and operating temperature were observed to be inversely related parameters. Hence, the highest response for TNTs-2 was obtained at room temperature with a magnitude as high as 320.14. The value was about 1.5 times greater than those obtained for nanofibers without mineral oil in the precursor solution at the same operating temperature. The reason can be attributed to the larger surface area provided by the nanotubes. Also, the response and recovery times for the optimum sample were reported to be 45 and 127 s, respectively.77
In an interesting study, Kaur et al.78 designed an engineered In2O3 nanowhisker structure to further enhance the surface area for low-temperature gas sensing. As shown in Fig. 11d, nanowhiskers were fabricated with a diameter of 100–300 μm and a length of few millimeters using a carbothermal method. The fabricated structure was able to sense H2S down to the ppb levels (Fig. 11e). The response and recovery times were observed to change with the concentration of the target gas. While the response time decreased as the concentration increased, the recovery time became longer, and the response was almost irreversible at room temperature. The sensor response toward 10 ppm gas was about 30, which was significantly improved compared to the pristine thin film samples. This improvement was attributed to the existing defects in the whisker structure, which resulted in a larger surface area.78
Various geometries provide different surface areas, and the surface area plays a key role in the determination of the sensing properties in sensing layers with the same materials. Thus, geometry optimization is considered to be a promising approach to enhance the gas sensing properties. Taken together, the porous thin film structure cannot show the desired gas sensing properties at low temperatures, in terms of the response value, even at thicknesses lower than 50 nm.74 However, the conversion of the porous thin film structure into a porous surface, comprising of micro-nano structures, can increase the surface area for a higher response magnitude.75 The significant impact of the surface area can also be seen in the differences in the sensing properties of the In2O3 nanotubes76 and compared to the In2O3 toruloid nanotubes.77 The toruloid nanotubes were 8 times smaller in diameter than the simple nanotubes; thus, higher response conjugated with faster response and recovery times were obtained. However, more studies are required to investigate the gas sensing performance of In2O3 in other so-called nanostructures such as nanorods and nanosheets. Overall, pristine In2O3-based sensing layers show high sensitivity with an acceptable response/recovery time only if the provided surface area is sufficiently large.
4.2 Chemical modification
Similar to the aforementioned approaches for semiconductors, indium oxide is also modified with metal oxides to enhance the sensing properties. In2O3-based sensing layers are only modified with CuO for low-temperature H2S gas sensing (summarized in Table 3). As indium oxide and copper oxide are n-type and p-type semiconductors, their composite results in the formation of surface p–n junctions. This is highly favorable in terms of enhancing the response value. Liang et al.79 reported a CuO-loaded electrospun In2O3 nanofiber for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. The composite molar ratio was fixed at [Cu]:[In] = 5:1. Water-dissolved nanofibers were deposited on an alumina substrate, followed by heat treatment at 550 °C. CuO-loaded nanofibers featuring a rough surface were larger in diameter compared to the pristine nanofibers, i.e., 40 and 30 nm, respectively (see Fig. 12a). As a result of CuO modification, the resistance increased up to 3–5 times, signaling the formation of the p–n junctions.79 The sensor response as a function of the operating temperature upon exposure to 5 ppm H2S is shown in Fig. 12b. Although the highest response was obtained at 150 °C, the sensor was still sensitive at room temperature; 9.2 × 103 and 1.16 × 105 were measured at 25 and 150 °C, respectively, which are among the highest magnitudes reported in the literature. The large surface area, abundant nanoscale p–n junctions, as a result of p-type CuO and n-type In2O3 coexistence, and the change in the n-type CuO to metallic CuS upon exposure to H2S are the attributed reasons to such a high response.79 Fast response time, ranging from 4 to 30 s, was obtained in the 25–400 °C working temperature window. However, neither the pristine samples nor the CuO-loaded ones were fully recovered after exposure to air. In the modified samples, the sensor almost fully recovered at temperatures above 350 °C. The reason behind the incomplete recovery is slow and difficult CuS oxidation at low temperatures. To fully recover the sensor, the temperature was raised to 500 °C with the pulse heating method (see Fig. 12c). Moreover, the modified sensor was highly selective toward H2S, with the response being significantly greater for H2S compared to other gases.79

In a similar study, Li et al.48 reported a bamboo-like CuO/In2O3 heterostructure for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. A novel method was used to fabricate the composite sensing layer from a metal–organic framework (MOF). First, a hexagonal indium-based microrod MOF precursor was synthesized, named CPP-3(In). The obtained CPP-3(In) yellow powder was then mixed with water and Cu(C2H3O2)2·H2O at different loadings. The mixture was then centrifuged, washed, and calcined to obtain the final structure. As can be seen in Fig. 12d, CuO/In2O3 had a porous shell structure with a hollow interior. The pore sizes were 15.23 nm on an average.48 Samples with different CuO weight ratios were tested toward 5 ppm H2S as a function of the operating temperature. As shown in Fig. 12e, the sensor had a low optimum operating temperature of 70 °C. The respective response value was 229.3, which was 8.5 times greater than that of pristine In2O3. Furthermore, the composite had a ppb-level limit of detection with a response of 2.25 upon exposure to 200 ppb H2S. Despite the fast response time of 10 s, the sensor was unable to fully recover at room temperature. It reached only 8% of its maximum response value after 3600 s (see Fig. 12f). The inability of full recovery of this MOF-based sensor can be attributed to the existence of pores and cracks, as well as the formation of CuS upon exposure to H2S. To address this problem, 400 °C electric pulse was applied. The response was reproducible for 6 dynamic cycles with over a month long-term stability. The performance of the sensor was evaluated toward 50 ppm acetone, benzene, methylbenzene, ethanol, and methanol, 5 ppm H2S and CH4, and 10 ppm CO. The response of the sensor with an optimum ratio of CuO/In2O3 was highly selective to H2S, with the response magnitude up to ∼200 times greater than that of the other gases.48
As mentioned above, In2O3-based sensing layers are only modified with CuO for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. The p–n heterojunctions thicken the electron depletion layer, resulting in an increased sensitivity as exposed to the reducing target gas. Accordingly, the response values for both the bamboo-like In2O3/CuO composite and CuO-loaded In2O3 nanofiber are of high magnitudes.48,79 However, the main problem in the modification with CuO is the irreversibility of the response, which happens due to the formation of CuS. Another effective modifier can be reduced graphene oxide (rGO). This p-type material with super-high conductivity is reported to significantly enhance the n-type-based sensing properties.41 In conclusion, In2O3-based nanostructures have been reported to be promising candidates for low-temperature H2S gas sensing in both modified and un-modified structures. Among the existing structures, nanostructures with larger surface area modified with p-type materials can be the best options.
5 WO3
5.1 Geometrical modification
WO3 is an n-type semiconductor with a wide indirect bandgap of 2.6–3 eV. Unique physical and chemical properties such as chemical stability, superior optical contrast, and mechanical strength have made it a promising candidate for various applications, including photocatalytic,80 electrochromic,81 and photoelectrode.82 Although this material has not been widely studied for gas sensing applications, it is deemed as an excellent candidate for hazardous gas detection, such as NO,83 NO2,84 NH3,85 CO,86 and H2S.87
However, most of the aforementioned cases have high operating temperatures. A couple of examples of pure WO3-based H2S gas sensors operating at high temperatures are shown in Fig. 13. Poongodi et al.88 developed a WO3-based nanostructured thin film for H2S sensing. As shown in Fig. 13a, WO3 nanostructures were fabricated on a WO3 seed layer using an electrodeposition method. The obtained nanoflakes were in the range of 10–20 nm in thickness and 1 μm in height. The highest reported response in the presence of 10 ppm analyte concentration was found to be 85% at 300 °C, which is a small magnitude at the mentioned high operating temperature (Fig. 13b).88

In a recent study, Kaur et al.89 reported a WO3 nanowire-based H2S gas sensor. Nanowires were fabricated through a vapor-liquid–solid (VLS) method on an alumina substrate. To optimize the fabrication process, a thin layer of a noble metal was sputtered on the substrate, which functioned as the catalyst. The nanowires, as shown in Fig. 13c, were fabricated with an average diameter and length of 10–30 nm and 100 nm, respectively. The optimum operating temperature of the sensing layer was reported to be 400 °C, showing a high response with a magnitude of 209 upon exposure to 20 ppm H2S (Fig. 13d).89
Li et al.90 reported a mesoporous WO3 structure for H2S gas sensing. The sensor consisted of a uniformly-ordered cubic mesostructured with an average pore size of 10.5 nm and a wall thickness of 6.6 nm (Fig. 13e). Investigating the response as a function of the working temperature (a wide range from 150 to 350 °C) upon exposure to 50 ppm analyte revealed that the maximum response took place at 250 °C. A high response magnitude of 270 and fast response and recovery times of 2 and 38 s, respectively, were obtained at the optimum operating temperature of 250 °C (Fig. 13f).90
Morphology control, which directly impacts the surface area, is one of the best methods to reduce the operating temperature of the WO3 sensing layers (summarized in Table 4). San et al.91 developed a WO3 nanotubes (NTs) array with a reduced operating temperature for H2S gas sensing. NTs were fabricated using a thermal evaporation method on the Si substrate, following the vapor-solid (VS) growth mechanism. This process included two steps: nucleation and growth. In the nucleation process, WO3 was heated to a certain temperature at which the WO3 vapor was generated. The vapor was then cooled down and condensed on the Si substrate, which functioned as the seed layer for NTs to grow on. The FESEM images showed that NTs were fabricated with a well-shaped hexagonal cross-section with an average crystal size of 85 nm (see Fig. 14a).91 A WO3 NT-based sensor response as a function of the operating temperature upon exposure to 10 ppm H2S is shown in Fig. 14b. Although the sensor exhibited the highest response at 150 °C with a magnitude of 7.3, it still showed an acceptable response at the reduced temperature of 50 °C. Despite the weak gas selectivity, the sensor showed reversible response at the optimum operating temperature with a fast recovery time upon exposure to air (see Fig. 14c).91

Overall, pristine WO3-based sensing layers show high sensitivity toward H2S; however, their high operating temperature has restricted their applications in low-temperature gas sensing. Their sensing properties can be effectively improved by chemical modifications, as elaborated in the next section.
5.2 Chemical modification
Pristine WO3-based sensing layers suffer high operating temperatures, slow response/recovery times, and poor selectivity. Therefore, these sensing layers are modified to address the aforementioned problems. Generally, WO3-based nanostructures have been modified with Cr, CuO, and rGO for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. These modifiers can be categorized into two main groups: (1) highly conductive nanoparticles (e.g., Cr), and (2) p-type nanomaterials (e.g., CuO) (summarized in Table 4).
Modification with high-conductivity nanoparticles facilitates carrier mobility in the structure; thus, it can be helpful for reducing the operating temperature. In an interesting study, Wang et al.92 developed a Cr-doped WO3 microsphere for low-temperature H2S gas sensing. WO3 microspheres were fabricated using two methods, i.e., the hydrothermal method and hydrothermal-based redox reaction method. In the former, the process included the addition of WCl6 to pure ethanol, followed by stirring and heating in a stainless-steel autoclave at 180 °C for 24 h. In the latter method, WCl6 and Cr(acac)2 were stirred in pure ethanol, followed by heating in a stainless-steel autoclave at 180 °C for 24 h. Based on the SEM images of the pristine WO3 sample, the hollow microspheres were uniformly fabricated with an average diameter of 1.5 μm and an average surface pore size of 23.8 nm.
Doping the structure with Cr leads to an increase in the average pore size to 46.9 nm, resulting in an enhanced surface area (see Fig. 15a).92 Cr doping significantly improved the gas sensing performance in terms of reducing the optimum operating temperature to about a quarter, increasing the response magnitude to about 8 times and enhancing the selectivity. As can be seen in Fig. 15b, the composite's highest response was obtained at 80 °C with an appreciable magnitude of 153.2. Along with the improved response magnitude, the sensor showed acceptable response and recovery times of 336 and 300 s, respectively. As the temperature increased to 250 °C, the response and recovery times dramatically reduced to 14 and 8 s, respectively, deste the response reduction to 48.7 (see Fig. 15c). The faster response can be attributed to a faster chemical surface reaction, enhanced gas phase diffusion, and higher carrier mobility at elevated temperatures.92 Moreover, Cr doping significantly improved the sensor selectivity toward H2S upon exposure to a couple of interfering gases (see Fig. 15d). Overall, the mechanism behind this significant improvement in gas sensing properties can be described as follows; first, upon Cr doping, the number of oxygen vacancies increases. These vacant positions can adsorb O2 and H2S, resulting in a higher response. Second, as an effect on the morphology, the surface pore size increased by Cr doping, which resulted in a 15% increase in the surface area.92

WO3 is also functionalized with metal oxides, including ZnO,93 CuO,94 SnO2,95 and NiO,96 for H2S gas sensing applications. Among them, CuO is reported to expand the limit of detection down to sub-ppb levels. As an example, He et al.94 fabricated a WO3/CuO composite gas sensor operatable at room temperature. To compare the gas sensing performance of the WO3/CuO composite with its constitutions, three samples were fabricated: WO3 flower-like microspheres, CuO nanoparticles, and the WO3/CuO composite. WO3 microspheres and CuO nanoparticles were fabricated via the hydrothermal method, and the composite was fabricated by dissolving WO3 microspheres in a mixture of DI water and ethanol, followed by the addition of a specific amount of Cu(CH3COO)2·H2O. This precursor solution was then stirred, heated, and washed to form the final composite. Characterizations using TEM and FESEM imaging verified the synthesis of WO3 nanosheets with a smooth surface with an average thickness of 150 nm, forming flower-like clusters. Doping the structure with CuO nanoparticles led to an increase in the roughness of the surface (see Fig. 16a). The diameter of the synthesized CuO nanoparticles on the surface of WO3 nanosheets were 50–100 nm.94 The highest composite sensing response was obtained at 80 °C with a magnitude of 105.14 toward 5 ppm H2S. The response improved 19 and 9 times compared to WO3 nanospheres and CuO nanoparticles, respectively, at their optimum operating temperatures (i.e., 80 °C and 100 °C, respectively) (see Fig. 16b). As can be seen in Fig. 16c, despite the fast response time of 42 s, the sensor only recovered 33% of its peak value after 3500 s. This poor recovery is believed to be the result of the existence of CuO and the formation of CuS on exposure to H2S. To fully recover the sensor, a 4.6 V electric pulse was applied, raising the temperature to 300 °C for 80 s. The composite showed six-cycle short-term stability with a 30-day long-term stability with less than 5% response drift. With a slight response to volatile gases, the sensor was reasonably selective to H2S. Also, the sensor selectivity was significantly improved compared to the composite constituents.94 Despite the high optimum operating temperature, the sensor showed a good response of 16 at room temperature toward 5 ppm target gas.

Similarly, Yu et al.22 introduced a WO3/CuO nanocube hybrid as the H2S gas sensor. The optimum hybrid compositions showed a response magnitude as high as 270000 toward 4 ppm H2S at 55 °C, which is among the highest reported at such a low temperature. This high response can be attributed to the existence of CuO nanoparticles on the surface of the nanocubes. As CuO nanoparticles grew on the surface of the nanocubes, the resulting surface heterojunctions trapped a large amount of surface electrons. These trapped electrons were released upon exposure to H2S, resulting in extremely high sensitivity. However, at a higher temperature, the increased WO3 intrinsic carrier concentration restricted the carrier mobility, leading to a decrease in the sensitivity.22
Carbon-based materials such as graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets,23 reduced graphene oxide (rGO),85,97 and carbon nanotubes (CNT)98,99 are also used in hybrid structures with WO3. rGO is reported to enhance the H2S gas sensing properties by providing high conductivity and a large surface area in the hybrid structures. It is shown that rGO nanosheets improved the response by up to 4 times while reducing the response and recovery times to about half the initial values.100 Most of the reported rGO-based structures have a high optimum working temperature. However, optimizing the hybrid structure by increasing the surface area can effectively reduce the working temperature. As an example, Peng et al.2 reported a highly sensitive room temperature H2S gas sensor based on the WO3/rGO hybrid structure. For the fabrication of the sensing layer, first, GO was synthesized using a modified Hummers’ method. The hybrid structure was then fabricated using a one-step acid-based hydrothermal method. The process included the addition of the sodium tungstate aqueous solution to the GO aqueous suspension at different ratios, followed by the drop-by-drop addition of sulphuric acid. The obtained mixture was then kept at 180 °C for 12 h, followed by final centrifugation, washing, and drying steps.2 The SEM and TEM images showed that the final structure consisted of cubic or quasi-cubic WO3 nanoparticles with an average length of 80–150 nm randomly loaded in transparent sheet-like rGOs. For response measurement, rather than measuring just the sample resistance, a real-time voltage difference of the series of resistors is monitored. Parameters Vc and RL (i.e., the test voltage (5 V) and series resistor, respectively) are constants, Vout (i.e., the voltage drop across RL) changes as the result of the sensor resistance change, and hence it is monitored as the sensor response. To determine the optimum rGO/WO3 ratio, the response was first determined at different ratios toward 500 ppb of H2S. The response peaked at 5 wt% rGO with a magnitude of 32.7. While the smaller ratios of rGO did not facilitate electron transfer, the higher ratios decreased the specific surface area, resulting in smaller response values, making 5 wt% the optimum rGO ratio. As a result of enhanced electron transfer on the optimum sensing layer, the sensor was fast in terms of the response and recovery with magnitudes of 340 and 180 s, respectively.2
In summary, the WO3-based sensing layers can provide high sensitivity at a reduced operating temperature (but not down to room temperature). Thus, there can be suitable options where a reduced temperature higher than room temperature is acceptable as the operating temperature. Although WO3 is modified with both highly-conductive and p-type nanomaterials to enhance the sensor performance, these modifications weaken the sensing layer in terms of the recovery process. Moreover, neither of the two mentioned categories could reduce the operating temperature down to room temperature. The ppb-level sensitivity at room temperature was only achieved by modification with p-type materials featuring high conductivity, i.e., rGO. The high conductivity of rGO facilitated the adsorption/desorption process, resulting in a fast response and recovery times, while the high ppb level sensitivity was obtained from its p-type nature. However, rGO modification has not been deeply studied yet. Therefore, further studies on WO3 modification are needed to unlock the full potential of the rGO-modified sensor for room temperature gas sensing.
6 Conclusion and future outlook
Emerging interest in the development of highly efficient gas sensors has led to comprehensive studies on metal oxide semiconductor (MOS)-based gas sensing. In order to be applicable in automated and self-powered sensing systems, the MOS sensors require a sensing layer operable at low temperatures, with a high response value at ppb-levels, and a fast response and recovery process reproducible for multiple cycles over time. In this review, we described the recent advances in ZnO, CuO, In2O3, and WO3-based gas sensors and their advantages and shortcomings for H2S sensing applications.
Based on the data provided in this review article, ZnO-based sensing layers are among the best candidates for low-temperatures H2S sensing as they provide acceptable performance in terms of the response value, response time, recovery time, and selectivity. CuO-based sensing layers can provide a rather high response value even down to ppb levels; however, they have slow and sometimes even irreversible recovery processes. In2O3-based sensing layers can also be promising candidates in terms of providing a high response value and fast response and recovery processes; however, the number of studies on their sensing performance is limited, requiring further elaboration and calls for future experiments. WO3-based sensors also feature high response values; however, they are operable at relatively high temperatures, which limits their applications for room-temperature gas sensing. The sensing properties of the mentioned materials are summarized in Fig. 17.
 Fig. 17  (a) 3D representation of MOS-based sensing layers for low-temperature H2S gas sensing as a function of the response value, operating temperature, and analyte concentration. 2D presentation of (b) the response value as a function of the analyte concentration, and (c) the operating temperature as a function of the analyte concentration for MOS-based low-temperature H2S gas sensors. 
The operating temperature of these metal oxide-based sensors can be reduced through physical (e.g., size or geometry) and chemical (e.g., surface treatment or doping) modifications without compromising other sensing properties. Overall, chemical modifications with noble metals, graphene-based materials, and another metal oxides results in a better enhancement compared to physical modifications. Physical modification methods only increase the surface area, creating more active sites for oxygen adsorption, whereas chemical modification can adjust the thickness of the depletion layer for an enhanced response value as well as tune the conductivity of the sensing layer to speed up the reaction kinetics of the response and recovery processes. The p–n junction is reportedly the most promising chemical modification mechanism, leading to a significant enhancement in the response value. Nevertheless, if the p–n junction modification is achieved via the incorporation of highly conductive nanoparticles, e.g., modification with reduced graphene oxides (rGO) nanosheets, both response and recovery times can be improved as well.
Despite significant advancements in low-temperature gas sensing of H2S, there are still unaddressed problems associated with metal oxide-based sensors, such as their short- and long-term stability. In most studies, the sensing layer is reported to be stable for up to four dynamic cycles and for less than a one-month period. These drawbacks make them unsuitable for most industrial applications. Hence, further investigation is required to improve the stability and limit of detection of nanostructured metal oxide H2S gas sensors through the development of new composites with novel enhanced mechanisms for H2S sensing. The authors hope that this review will provoke the readers toward additional discoveries and to be a part of this bright future.
