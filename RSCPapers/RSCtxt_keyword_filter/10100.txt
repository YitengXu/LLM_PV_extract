    , Accepted 19th September 2013First published on 23rd September 2013AbstractVertically self-assembled bilayers with an interfacial bottom layer and a photoactive top layer are demonstrated via a single coating step of a blend composed of an amine-containing nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (NPE) and an organic electron donor–acceptor bulk heterojunction composite. The self-assembled NPE layer reduces the work function of an indium tin oxide (ITO) cathode, which leads to efficient inverted organic solar cells without any additional interface engineering of the ITO.
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs), which consist of an electron-donating organic material (e.g., conjugated polymers and small molecules) and an electron-accepting fullerene derivative, have been developed as flexible, lightweight, colorful, and semitransparent energy conversion devices and are expected to provide innovative technological advancements in ubiquitous portable applications and future integrated photovoltaic devices.1–3 Moreover, these solar cells can be manufactured on large-area plastic substrates via low-cost and high-throughput printing techniques because of the excellent solution processability of the component materials.4–6 To enhance the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the OSCs, numerous researchers have recently synthesized new organic electron donor–acceptor materials and have developed various methods for controlling their morphology (e.g., solvent/thermal annealing and the use of processing additives).7–12 More recently, the highest PCEs to date, which exceed 10%, have been achieved in the inverted structures of OSCs (I-OSCs), which exploit high-work-function metals as the top anode.13,14 Because I-OSCs are environmentally stable, fully printable, and highly efficient, this device architecture is currently considered to be one of the most promising structures for commercial applications of OSCs.
To fabricate high-efficiency I-OSCs, researchers have focused their efforts on the development of interfacial materials that tailor the work functions (WFs) of the electrodes and facilitate efficient charge collection in the electrodes.14–21 An energy-level mismatch (i.e., a Schottky barrier) between the high WFs of transparent bottom cathodes (e.g., indium tin oxide, ITO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of fullerene derivatives is the primary cause of significant decreases in efficiency in I-OSCs; therefore, a cathode interfacial layer must be introduced between the cathode and the photoactive layer to reduce the WFs of the cathodes and to lower the energy barriers.
To date, a variety of cathode interfacial materials, including metal oxides, metal carbonates, self-assembled monolayers, and polyelectrolytes, have been successfully applied to I-OSCs.14–21 However, the use of interfacial materials can create a critical problem in the printing processes of I-OSCs. Because the maximum typical film thickness of the interfacial materials in I-OSCs is only of the order of tens of nanometers, uniform and pinhole-free interfacial layers are difficult to form using printing processes. Consequently, additional sophisticated processing steps that increase the complexity of printing production lines would be required for the preparation of high-quality interfacial layers.
The utilization of spontaneous vertical phase separation in organic blends is an effective approach for solving the previously discussed problem because it enables the formation of uniform multilayered nanostructures through a single coating step of the mixtures and thereby simplifies device fabrication.22–25 Qiu et al. have reported the vertical phase separation of poly(3-hexylthiophene):poly(methylmethacrylate) (P3HT:PMMA) mixtures, which resulted in formation of the bilayer, a P3HT top layer and a PMMA bottom layer for organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) applications.22 In addition, Wei et al. have verified the spontaneous bilayer formation of bottom-enriched P3HT and a top-enriched fullerene derivative with a fluorocarbon chain in the mixture film for the fabrication of normal OSCs with low-WF top cathodes.23 These previous studies attributed the vertical phase separation phenomenon to a relative surface energy difference among organic materials; in a mixture of two organic materials, the organic material with the relatively lower surface energy is segregated at the top surface of the organic film, whereas the other organic material with the relatively higher surface energy prefers to migrate along the surface of the substrate.
Despite these pioneering developments, to the best of our knowledge, vertically self-assembled bilayers that consist of a cathode interfacial bottom layer and a BHJ photoactive top layer have not yet been demonstrated and incorporated into I-OSCs. In this study, by using the spontaneous vertical phase separation of a blend composed of an amine-containing nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (NPE) and a BHJ composite (conjugated polymer:fullerene or small molecule:fullerene), we successfully demonstrated bilayer formation with a cathode interfacial NPE bottom layer and a BHJ photoactive top layer through a single coating process and applied the formed bilayer (NPE/BHJ) for I-OSC fabrication. Because the self-assembled NPE layer can act as a cathode interfacial layer to reduce the WF of ITO and to decrease the energy barrier between ITO and a fullerene, we were able to fabricate efficient I-OSCs without any additional interface engineering of the ITO; the PCEs of the devices are comparable to those of conventional I-OSCs with separate NPE layers.

Fig. 1a shows the chemical structures of the materials used in this study. We introduced various photoactive materials into the blend system. The blends consisted of an electron donor that included P3HT, poly(thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene) (PTB) and 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (DTS-F), an electron acceptor that involved the fullerene derivatives [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) and indene-C60 bisadduct (IC60BA), and polyethyleneimine (PEI) as a cathode interfacial NPE. Previously, we have demonstrated that PEI is an ideal cathode interfacial material that promotes the WF reduction of ITO by forming interfacial dipoles, thereby creating ohmic contacts with fullerene acceptors in I-OSCs (Fig. S1†).15 We hypothesize that the functional amines of PEI play two important roles in the formation of the bilayer (cathode interfacial PEI layer/BHJ photoactive layer) via a single coating step of the blends (referred to as the ‘PEI:BHJ blends’) (Fig. 1b). First, the amine groups provide PEI with a high surface energy because of their hydrophilic properties; they can therefore induce a sufficient driving force to move the PEI on the ITO surface during film formation. Second, because the amine groups can be protonated through chemical reactions with the terminal hydroxyls of the ITO surface, a uniform PEI layer can be ionically self-assembled on ITO by a strong electrostatic force between the positively charged protonated amines of the PEI and the negatively charged oxygen anions of the ITO surface (Fig. S2†).15 To effectively induce the vertical phase separation of the PEI:BHJ blends, we used UV/ozone treatment, which increases the terminal hydroxyl content and hydrophilicity of the ITO surface, thereby leading to more reproducible bilayer (PEI/BHJ) formation.

To obtain homogeneous PEI:BHJ blends without serious aggregation or precipitation, we carefully considered the solubility of the materials. Because PEI is insoluble in organic solvents [e.g., chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB)], which were used in the BHJ solutions, the PEI was separately dissolved in amphiphilic alcohols [e.g., isopropyl alcohol (IPA), 2-methoxyethanol (2-ME) and butanol (BtOH)], which are miscible in organic solvents; then, a small amount of PEI solution was added to the BHJ solutions. The BHJ solutions were based on P3HT:IC60BA, PTB:PC70BM, and DTS-F:PC70BM composites. To investigate the quality of the films deposited from the PEI:BHJ solutions, we compared two types of samples, Glass/ITO/PEI/BHJ and Glass/ITO/PEI:BHJ, by conducting UV-visible spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses. We confirmed that the Glass/ITO/PEI:BHJ samples had vibronic features and root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values similar to those of the corresponding Glass/ITO/PEI/BHJ samples, which demonstrated that the addition of PEI to the BHJ solutions did not deleteriously affect the morphology of the photoactive layers (Fig. S3 and S4†). In addition, we confirmed that the addition of the solvents (mixtures of alcohol and water) to the BHJ solutions did not influence the morphology of the BHJ films and the performance of the I-OSCs (Fig. S4 and S5†).
To investigate the surface energies of the materials used in this study, we measured the contact angles of water on the surfaces of bare ITO, PEI, acceptors, donors, BHJ, and PEI:BHJ.26Fig. 2a and b present photographs of a water droplet standing on each film surface and the corresponding surface energies of the materials, respectively. Bare ITO and PEI surfaces exhibited hydrophilicity with wettable contact angles; these contact angles indicated that the surface energies are high because of the presence of polar functional groups, including the hydroxyl groups on the ITO surface and the amines from the PEI. In contrast, the acceptor, donor, BHJ, and PEI:BHJ films exhibited hydrophobicity with non-wettable contact angles; these results revealed that the surface energies of these films are low because of the non-polar backbones and alkyl side chains of the donors and acceptors. We note that the PEI:BHJ films have surface energies that are comparable to those of the BHJ films. These results imply that the top surfaces of the PEI:BHJ films contain almost no hydrophilic PEI because of the vertical phase separation of the PEI at the bottom and BHJ at the top. Consequently, the large difference between the surface energies of PEI and the BHJ composite may generate a sufficient driving force to spontaneously induce the formation of the vertically self-assembled bilayer (PEI/BHJ) during film formation of the PEI:BHJ mixture.

Direct evidence of the vertical phase separation of the PEI:BHJ blends was obtained from time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), which is a powerful tool for obtaining the depth profiles of the atoms that exist within films.27,28Fig. 3a and b show the TOF-SIMS depth profiles of the ITO/PEI/BHJ and ITO/PEI:BHJ samples, respectively, which were detected starting from the top sides of the samples. The S−, CN−, and InO− ions can be assigned to the donors, PEI, and ITO, respectively; the S− peaks can also be considered to be markers for the BHJ layers. In all ITO/PEI/BHJ samples, the peak intensities of the CN− ions increased near the ITO surface, whereas the peak intensities of the S− ions decreased in the corresponding region, indicating that well-defined PEI/BHJ bilayers exist on the ITO surfaces (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the mass spectra of the ITO/PEI:BHJ samples exhibit increases in the peak intensities of the CN− ions and decreases in the peak intensities of the S− ions near the ITO surfaces (Fig. 3b). These results clearly verify that bilayers composed of a PEI interfacial bottom layer and a BHJ photoactive top layer were effectively formed through the single coating process of the PEI:BHJ blends.

To prove the effectiveness of the vertically self-assembled bilayers with respect to device fabrication, we fabricated I-OSCs with the structure ITO/PEI:BHJ/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiphene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) or molybdenum sub-oxide (MoOx)/Ag (experimental device). For comparison, we also fabricated two types of I-OSCs with the structures ITO/BHJ/PEDOT:PSS or MoOx/Ag (reference) and ITO/PEI/BHJ/PEDOT:PSS or MoOx/Ag (conventional device). The device architectures are shown in Fig. 4a. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the I-OSCs were measured under standard Air Mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) illumination with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. 4b and Table 1). In addition, the incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were analyzed to ensure the accuracy of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) values obtained from the J–V curves (Fig. 4c). In an accurate measurement system, the Jsc values should correspond to the photocurrent values calculated from the IPCE spectra.

The reference devices (without PEI) showed poor device performances, with PCEs of 0.6%, 0.2%, and 0.0% for the P3HT:IC60BA, PTB:PC70BM, and DTS-F:PC70BM devices, respectively, because of the high energy barriers between bare ITO and the acceptors. However, the performances of the conventional I-OSCs with a separate PEI layer were significantly improved to PCEs of 5.3%, 6.0%, and 6.0% for the PEI/P3HT:IC60BA, PEI/PTB:PC70BM, and PEI/DTS-F:PC70BM devices, respectively; the PEI layer substantially reduced the WF of the ITO through the formation of interfacial dipoles and lowered the energy barrier between the ITO and the acceptors. Surprisingly, the experimental I-OSCs that were fabricated using the PEI:BHJ blends yielded excellent device performances with PCEs of 5.3%, 6.0%, and 6.1% for the PEI:P3HT:IC60BA, PEI:PTB:PC70BM, and PEI:DTS-F:PC70BM devices, respectively; these performance characteristics are comparable to those of the conventional I-OSCs that were fabricated with a separate PEI layer. Given that the optimum thickness of the PEI layer in the I-OSCs is approximately 2 nm, these outstanding device performances indicate that ultrathin PEI layers were uniformly formed on the ITO surfaces through the vertical phase separation of the PEI:BHJ blends.15 Moreover, we confirmed that the experimental I-OSCs are stable in air (Fig. S6†).
In addition, we investigated the formation of the vertically self-assembled bilayers using printing techniques. To deposit the PEI:BHJ blend onto ITO, we used a simple doctor-blade coating method, which is compatible with roll-to-roll printing processes. Fig. S7a† shows a schematic diagram of the doctor-blade coating process. By adjusting a variety of experimental factors, including the solution concentration, the speed of the blade, and the gap distance between the blade and the substrate, we delicately controlled the uniformity and thickness of the PEI:BHJ film. The resultant doctor-blade-coated PEI:BHJ device (based on PEI:P3HT:IC60BA) exhibited outstanding device performance with a PCE of 5.0% (Fig. S7b†). This result clearly demonstrates that vertically self-assembled PEI/BHJ bilayers can be readily achieved via printing techniques.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated vertically self-assembled bilayers (NPE/BHJ) obtained from NPE:BHJ blends and their I-OSC applications. Using water-contact-angle and TOF-SIMS analyses, we investigated the correlation between the surface energies of the materials and the vertical phase separation and demonstrated spontaneous bilayer formation via a single coating process of the blends. In addition, the ionic self-assembly of PEI on ITO facilitated more efficient bilayer formation. The presence of the self-assembled PEI layer on the ITO surface reduced the energy barrier between the ITO and the acceptors by creating interfacial dipoles, which led to enhanced device performance of the I-OSCs with no additional interface engineering of the ITO. We believe that this simple and efficient approach may offer a variety of advantages for many organic electronic applications.
