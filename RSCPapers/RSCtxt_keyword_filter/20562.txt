    , Accepted 4th October 2016First published on 6th October 2016AbstractHere we report a solution processed nanostructured NiO as a hole transport layer (HTL) for efficient inverted MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The best performing p-i-n PSC exhibits 15.35% power conversion efficiency with a current density (JSC) of 19.85 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.056 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73. The developed method is simple and cost effective.
The development of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on various organometallic halide perovskite materials, hole transport layers (HTLs) and electron transport layers (ETLs) has been described.1–5 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)polystyrene sulphonate (PEDOT:PSS) is the most promising HTL for inverted type perovskite solar cells. It is known that p-type metal oxides demonstrate much higher carrier mobility and superior stability than organic materials.6,7 NiO has a higher hole mobility (10−5 to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) and shows a higher open circuit voltage than PEDOT:PSS. Recently pulsed laser deposition (PLD)8 and sputtering9 techniques have been used for the synthesis of p-type NiO HTLs for inverted PSCs with 17.3% and 11.6% power conversion efficiencies respectively. However, nanostructured p-type NiO metal oxides can also be processed easily via a solution process at low temperatures. The solution method is simple and cost effective and can be easily used to control the HTL thickness.10
As far as PSCs are concerned, methylammonium mixed halides (MAPbIx) and formamidinium lead iodides (FAPbIx) have achieved 16.2%3 and 21.1%2 power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), respectively. Moreover, negligible hysteresis via the optimization of each layer, an extremely uniform and dense structure via toluene dripping, tuning of the band gap via composition variation, a long diffusion length (>100 nm) and a high absorption coefficient3–7 are key features of perovskite materials. A variety of n-type metal oxides as ETLs such as blocking titanium oxide (Bl-TiO2),11 mesoporous titanium oxide (mp-TiO2),12 Y:TiO2,13 ZnO,14 SnO2,15 Zn2SnO416 and BaSnO3,17 and poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT),18 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-pdimethoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD),19 poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA),20 CuI,21 and CuSCN22 as HTLs have been used for regular mesoporous and planar structured PSCs. While PEDOT:PSS or p-type NiO as HTLs (or electron blocking layer), and C60, its derivatives like [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PC61MB)23 and PC71BM as ETLs have been used for inverted p-i-n type PSCs. However, polymer based HTLs suffered from low energy and relatively low charge mobility compared to p-type metal oxides. On the other hand, optimization of each layer by maintaining their charge mobility and electron balance becomes typically necessary steps in the fabrication of efficient inverted p-i-n perovskite solar cells.5,8,9 Two device configurations were used for metal oxide ETL containing p-i-n type based perovskite solar cells. The p-i-n type inverted perovskite has been divided into two categories. The first type contains a metal oxide as the ETL and C60 or PCBM as the HTL.24–30 While the second type contains a p-type metal oxide as the HTL and an n-type metal oxide as the ETL for inverted type perovskite solar cells.31 A detailed literature survey has been discussed in Table S1.† Wang et al. used p-type mesoscopic NiO and demonstrated 9.51% PCE for first type inverted PSCs.27 Kim et al. developed a solution-processed Cu:NiO as the HTL which demonstrated 15.40% efficiency.28 On the other hand, Chen et al. synthesized heavily p-doped NixMg1−xO and n-doped TiOx by a chemical process and used respectively as the HTL and ETL for PSCs with 16.2% PCE.31 Yang et al. demonstrated the influence of a monolayer surface modification of the NiO nanocrystal layer using ethanolamine and demonstrated 15.90% efficiency.32 Recently You et al. demonstrated solution processed p-type NiO and n-type ZnO for p-i-n inverted PSCs with 16.1% PCE.33 However, these two reports are very different from the current investigation.
To the best of our knowledge, there is no single report based on solution processed nanocrystalline NiO (as the HTL) and PCBM (as the ETL) for inverted p-i-n type perovskite solar cells with >15% PCE based on this configuration. In this communication, we demonstrated a low temperature solution processed p-type NiO metal oxide for inverted p-i-n type perovskite solar cells. A p-type metal oxide facilitates higher charge carrier mobility and excellent stability compared to organic/polymeric materials. The solution processed nanostructured NiO thin film and PCBM were used as a HTL and ETL respectively. The fabricated devices show 15.32% power conversion efficiency (PCE) for an ∼75 nm thick NiO HTL which is comparable to date. The effect of the HTL thickness and its photocurrent stability has been investigated in detail.

Scheme 1 shows the simple methodology for the synthesis of a NiO thin film via a reflux method. The desired amount of ethanolic precursor solution containing nickel diacetate tetrahydrate (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O) and HCl was refluxed at 60 °C for 2 h. The green coloured solution was allowed to cool at room temperature for another 30 min. The resulting clear green colored solution was further filtered by using a syringe filter (Whatman GD/X PVDF pore size 0.45 μm). The clear filtered solution was spin-cast onto a ITO substrate at a spin speed of 3000 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 300 °C for 90 min in ambient air. In the present investigation we have used only (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O) as the NiO precursor and dissolved it in ethanol. However, (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O) cannot be dissolved completely in ethanol. The solution becomes turbid. Most of the previous reports suggest that they have used mixed solvents such as nickel formate dehydrate in an ethylene glycol solution containing ethylenediamine,24 2-methoxyethanol (C3H8O2) and monoethanolamine (C2H7NO, MEA),34 nickel acetate tetrahydrate in ethanol with monoethanolamine,35 and nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) in ethylene glycol/ethylenediamine33 solution as a solvent and stabilizer. However, in our case we have used only a single precursor in order to stabilize the precursor solution with the addition of 0.5 ml conc. HCl. After the addition of HCl, our (Ni(CH3COO)2·4H2O)/ethanol solvent becomes very transparent which is most important for the complete dissolution of the nickel precursor. Furthermore, the clear and transparent solution will be helpful for the deposition of a uniform and highly dense NiO thin film. The possible general chemical reaction takes place as follows (1) (2) (3)Fig. 1(a and b) represent the surface morphology of NiO thin films at different magnifications. The thickness of these films was calculated by using cross sectional images. The top view shows that all films are highly dense and exhibit uniform deposition of the nanoparticulated NiO thin film. The average particle size is around 35–45 nm. It is also observed that multi-step deposition increases the thickness and improves the uniformity. The transmission spectra of the NiO thin film show >80% transmittance in the 300–900 nm range (Fig. 1c). The thickness of the HTL was optimized by multistep spin coating (Fig. S1†). Fig. 1d shows the XRD pattern of the respective sample. The XRD patterns are assigned to the three main NiO peaks at 37.18°, 43.25° and 62.86° which refer to the planes (111), (200), and (220), respectively. The XRD results confirm the existence of the cubic NiO phase (JCPDS 22-1189). Fig. 1(e and f) present the 2D and 3D AFM images of NiO nanoparticles spin coated on the ITO substrate and annealed at 300 °C. The highly uniform and dense NiO nanoparticles are uniformly deposited on the ITO substrate with sizes ranging from 35 to 45 nm. The roughness of the deposited NiO nanoparticles is 12.681 nm, revealing a very smooth surface. This highly dense and pin-hole free NiO layer can act as an effective hole transporting layer and isolates the perovskite layer and ITO coating results in a low recombination rate and a high open circuit voltage. Furthermore, the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed the formation of pure phase NiO. The TG curve indicates that the minor weight loss of the NiO nanoparticles occurred from 60 °C to 105 °C due to the loss of water molecules due to the atmospheric moisture. However, there is no substantial loss after 100 °C suggesting that the synthesised NiO nanoparticles are a pure phase. This suggests that the synthesized and annealed NiO nanoparticles already decomposed completely at 300 °C to form nickel oxide (Fig. S2†). The XRD and TGA results revealed that the synthesized NiO nanoparticles are free from any organic impurity and moisture.

The structural and elemental analyses of NiO nanoparticles were performed by high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (Fig. 2a). The TEM analysis clearly shows that the NiO nanoparticles are regular in shape with 35–45 nm particle size. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows that the synthesized NiOx nanoparticles are highly crystalline in nature. Furthermore the HRTEM analysis revealed that the interplanar spacing of d200 = 2.085 Å between the adjacent lattice fringes obtained from the HRTEM image can be assigned to the NiO (200) plane.36 These results are consistent with XRD analysis. The elemental analysis clearly revealed that both nickel and oxygen elements are present at ∼1:1 ratio confirming the good stoichiometric NiO nanoparticles.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were carried out to elucidate the chemical compositions of the NiO films. The high resolution XPS spectrum of Ni(2p) and O(1s) core levels is shown in Fig. 3. The Ni2p spectra comprise two regions that are representing the Ni2p3/2 (850–865 eV) and Ni2p1/2 (870–885 eV) spin–orbit levels. The deconvoluted peak corresponds to Ni(2p3/2) observed at a binding energy (BE) of 851.61 eV (Fig. 3a) with its shake-up satellite at 858.55 eV indicating the presence of Ni2p cations, and not of Ni3p cations. The peak at 851.61 eV was ascribed to a vacancy induced Ni3+ ion. Fig. 3b shows the XPS spectrum for O 1s in NiO, with a peak centred at 528.89 eV, further confirming the octahedral bonding of Ni–O. The peak at 530.72 eV may be ascribed to the surface defects on NiO, OH groups and the formation of nickel hydroxides.

Fig. 4(a) shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the ITO/NiO/MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 thin film deposited on the spin coated NiO thin film. It can be clearly seen that the surface of the NiO thin film has been fully covered with dense grains having 300–700 nm size. The presented textured morphology is consistent with previous literature and it facilitated low grain boundaries. The surface roughness of the films was further investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (inset Fig. 4a). The FESEM and AFM images are consistent with each other with 16 nm root mean square roughness.

The phase of the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sample was confirmed by XRD analysis (Fig. 4b). The MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 sample corresponds to the (110), (112), (202), (220), (312), (024), (224), and (314) orientations at 14.20°, 20.14°, 24.74°, 28.62°, 32.13°, 35.19°, 40.90° and 43.57°, respectively, of the pseudo-tetragonal unit cell with I4cm symmetry. The device structure of the inverted perovskite solar cell based on the solution processed NiO HTL is shown in Fig. 4c. This consists of glass/ITO/NiOx/MAPb(I1−xBrx)3/LiF/Al (Lif/Al layer is not shown in this figure). In addition, large oriented-crystalline grains and vertically aligned grain boundaries were clearly identified from a typical cross-section FESEM image of the film. Here the nanoparticulated NiO and PCBM act as the HTL and ETL layers respectively. The corresponding band diagram is shown in Fig. 4d. The band gap of the mixed halide perovskite has been calculated using the equation Eg(x) = 1.57 + 0.39x + 0.33x2, where Eg is the band gap of the perovskite in eV and x is the amount of Br relative to the amount of I.37,38 Furthermore, we have also recorded the PL and UV-Vis absorption spectra of the (MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0, x = 0.3)) samples in order to confirm this (ESI S3†). During illumination of light, charge carriers are generated in the MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite layer, and electrons and holes are subsequently collected by their respective contacts, PCBM and NiO. The hole mobility of the NiO thin film was measured by Hall effect measurements and is found to be 156.3 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is well in agreement with previous reports.39
The thickness of the NiO HTL was optimized by multistep spin coating of NiO precursor solution, transmittance and optimized J–V characteristics. It is also observed that ≥100 nm thin films show a major optical loss. Therefore a higher thickness shows a lower PCE. For more details please check Fig. S1, S3, S4 and Table S1.†Fig. 5a shows the typical J–V plot of a champion cell having an ∼75 nm thin NiO layer and a 400 nm MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 perovskite absorbing layer. The highest PCE of 15.35% was achieved using a three step spin-coated NiO HTL (75 nm) yielding a Jsc of 19.85 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.06 V, and a FF of 0.73. The integrated Jsc value obtained from the incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) data is 19.21 mA cm−2, which agrees with the measured value. The hysteresis of the devices was examined by changing the scan direction in the J–V measurements. The p-i-n type PSC having an ∼75 nm HTL exhibits PCE values of 13.86% and 15.32% for the forward and reverse scans, respectively (Fig. 6a). The parameters of the forward scan are VOC = 1.01 V, JSC = 19.33 mA cm−2, FF = 0.71%, and η = 13.76%. The reverse scan exhibits an increase in the PCE to 15.30% (VOC = 1.05 V, JSC = 19.70 mA cm−2, FF = 0.74).

Fig. 6(b) shows the evolution of stable photocurrent measurements and solar cell performance over time under illumination of the champion devices using ∼75 nm NiO thin films. These measurements were carried out as a function of time in a forward bias set at their respective open circuit potential. The photocurrent density at 5 s is 12 mA cm−2 but increased up to 19.70 mA cm−2 after 20 s constant illumination and gives stable >15% over a 300 s measurement window. These values are very close to the PCE obtained from the reverse scan for the J–V measurement. These results clearly revealed good photocurrent stability of inverted p-type p-i-n PSCs based on the nanoparticulated NiO HTL.
It is well known that the stability is a major issue for perovskite solar cells. Therefore, we have also checked the stability of the NiO HTL based devices. For comparison we have also fabricated the traditional PEDOT:PSS HTL based device (for Experimental details, please check ESI Fig. S5†). The stability of the devices was tested in air while devices were stored in a nitrogen filled glove box. As shown in Fig. 7, it is clear that the NiO HTL based device maintained >80% stability up to 40 days, which is much higher than the traditional PEDOT:PSS based device. It has been observed that the fast decrease in the PCE of the PEDOT:PSS based devicemay be due to the acidic and moisture-sensitive nature of the PEDOT:PSS HTL.

In conclusion, we have successfully synthesized p-i-n type inverted perovskite solar cells based on nanostructured highly dense and smooth NiO thin films. Our results revealed that the thickness of the p-type NiO HTL plays a key role in enhancing the performance of inverted perovskite solar cells. The champion cell having a 75 nm thin NiO HTL exhibited 15.35% PCE with JSC = 19.85 mA cm−2, VOC = 1.056 V and FF = 0.73. The NiOx HTL based devices show much higher stability than PEDOT:PSS based PSCs. We believe that the present method is free from sophisticated equipment like PLD or sputtering and the HTL thickness can be controlled easily.
