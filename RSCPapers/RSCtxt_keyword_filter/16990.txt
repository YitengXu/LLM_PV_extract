    , Accepted 31st January 2015First published on 9th February 2015AbstractIn this paper the three new narrow bandgap D–A conjugated copolymers P1, P2 and P3 based on different weak donor fused thiophene-imidazole containing derivatives and the same benzothiadiazole acceptor unit were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization and characterized by 1H NMR, elemental analysis, GPC, TGA, DSC. These copolymers exhibit intensive absorbance in the range 350–900 nm and the optical bandgap lies in the range of 1.50–1.61 eV, which corresponds to the maximum photon flux of the solar spectrum. The electrochemical bandgap derived from cyclic voltammetry varies within the limits 1.47–1.65 eV and is approximately very close to the optical bandgap. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of all copolymers is deep lying (−5.24 eV and −5.37 eV and −5.25 eV for P1, P2 and P2, respectively) which shows that copolymers have good stability in the air and assured a higher open circuit voltage (Voc) for polymer BHJ solar cells. These copolymers were used as donors along with PC71BM and the BHJ polymer solar cells based on P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM and P3:PC71BM processed from chloroform (CF) solvent with 3 v% DIO as an additive showed an overall PCE of 4.55%, 6.76% and 5.16%, respectively.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted remarkable attention in the last two decades because of their advantages of low cost, roll to roll device fabrication, light weight and mechanical flexibility.1 Among the all device architectures, OSCs based on a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active layer consist of a blend of electron donors (conjugated polymer or small molecules) and electron acceptors (fullerene derivatives) and are some of the most promising options.2 At present, state of the art OSCs have reached the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 9% for single junction devices3 and as high as 10.6% for a tandem device.4 Moreover, it is expected to reach 15% in next few years5 by developing new organic semiconductors, optimizing device architectures and understanding the device physics.6 Theoretical studies suggest that the maximum PCE of the single layer polymer solar cells could be reached up to 17% and that tandem PSCs have capability for a maximum PCE of 24%.7
The power conversion efficiency of BHJ polymer solar cells depends on the absorption profile and bandgap of the conjugated electron donor polymer used in the BHJ active layer. To explore novel electron donor conjugated polymeric materials to improve PCE of organic solar cells further, the donor–acceptor (D–A) approach is one of the most successful strategies, because it enables tunable absorption spectra and tailors the electrochemical energy levels (highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels) of resulting polymers.8 Therefore it is essential to develop the D–A copolymers that show better optoelectronic properties to boost the PCE of polymer solar cells further. It is reported in the literature that copolymers incorporating electron deficient 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT),9 thieono[3,4-b]-thiophene (TT),10 thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD),11 and pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (DPP)12 derivatives show excellent absorption, and high carrier mobility, and consequently high PCE in both single and tandem PSCs. Among these the BT analogue is considered a most promising acceptor unit, and copolymers incorporating a BT unit gave a maximum PCE of up to 8.2%.9 Many studies have shown that the photovoltaic properties of the D–A copolymers consisting of a BT acceptor can be tuned via the insertion/incorporation of electron donating or accepting units in the BT moiety.13 Among the various D–A conjugated copolymers, copolymers based on the combination of benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) as the donor unit and 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) as the acceptor unit have been widely used and demonstrated to have excellent photovoltaic performance. The BDT unit has a symmetric and planar conjugated structure, which can easily recognize ordered π–π stacking and assist in charge transport ability. Moreover, the BDT core provides two positions on the central benzene core for attaching the different substitutes to ensure the good solubility and tune the energy levels of the copolymers.8 Wang successfully designed and synthesized a series of new benzothiadiazole based conjugated D–A copolymers and achieved a PCE of 8.3%.9
As discussed above, BDT and BT are the most commonly used electron donor and acceptors moieties, respectively used for the design of D–A copolymers. Therefore, conjugated D–A copolymers, denoted as P(BDT-DTBT) (in DTBT, two thiophene moieties are flanked into the benzene ring of BT as a π-bridge for reducing steric hindrance and tuning the electrochemical energy levels) can be the ideal donor materials for high performance of PSCs. This combination is a kind of a weak donor–strong acceptor copolymer.14 The weak donor BDT helps maintain a low HOMO level and the strong acceptor DTBT would reduce the bandgap of the resulting copolymer. It was reported that extending the fused ring system in the two dimension (2D) direction is expected to broaden the light absorption of the material with enhanced high energy bands. Moreover, the 2D conjugation would allow the delocalization of hole over the side chain, thus lowering the local charge density and coulombic interactions between the hole and the electron in the donor–acceptor interface.15
Polymer solar cells based on conjugated copolymers containing the imidazole unit exhibit a decent PCE of 4.1%. The flat structure of imidazole is covalently bonded with the polymer side chain, which increases the conjugation length and decrease the effective bandgap. Inspired by the distinct research papers, where imidazole derivatives are play the role of acceptor fragments in the side chain of polymers, we synthesized new planar imidazole derivatives as weak donors structures, according to the concept of building of an ideal conjugated copolymer “weak donor–strong acceptor” and inserted them in the main polymer chain, in order to increase the effective length of conjugation and increase intramolecular charge transfer. We developed new thiophene–benzimidazole containing compounds with a rigid planar structure and expected to decrease the bandgap due to the presence of thiophene–benzimidazole structures as weak donor fragments in the polymer main chain. These copolymers exhibit a suitable HOMO energy level (optimal value of HOMO of the order of 5.4 eV), in order to achieve high value of open circuit voltage (Voc) and relatively large values of the LUMO energy level for effective charge transfer to PCBM. Inspired by the work reported in the literature, we have designed three low bandgap D–A copolymers P1, P2 and P3 with different weak donors (fused thiophene-imidazole containing derivatives units) and same strong acceptor benzothiadiazole. These copolymers exhibit a broad absorption profile extending from the visible to near infrared region of the solar spectrum and low lying HOMO energy level, for achieving the high Jsc and Voc. It is interesting that the device PCE was significantly increased from P1:PC71BM (4.55%) to P2:PC71BM (5.16%) and P3:PC71BM (6.76%) after the optimization of the solvent additive. This indicates that the solvent additive plays an important role in enhancing the overall PCE of the polymer solar cells.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Instruments and characterization methods

1H and 13C NMR spectra of the starting compounds and copolymers were recorded on the spectrometer “Bruker Avance-400” with a working frequency of 400.13 and 100.62 MHz, respectively. IR spectra were recorded using a FT-IR spectrometer “Perkin-Elmer 1720-X”, TGA and DSC analysis was performed on “Perkin-Elmer TGA-7” and “Perkin-Elmer DSC 7” devices with a heating rate of 20 deg min−1. The absorption spectra in the range of 190–1100 nm were recorded on the spectrophotometer “Varian Cary 50.” The source of the exciting light was a xenon lamp L8253, which is part of the block radiator with optical fiber output radiation “Hamamatsu LC-4.” Cyclic voltammetry measurements were performed on a potentiostat-galvanostatm AUTOLAB Type III equipped with a standard three-electrode scheme in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 mol L−1 tributylammonium hexafluorophosphate (nBu4NPF6) at a potential scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Films of investigated polymers were deposited on a glass surface coated with ITO and then dried and used as a working electrode. Ag/Ag+ and platinum were used as reference and counter electrodes, respectively.
2.2 Synthesis of monomers M1, M2, M3 and copolymers P1, P2 and P3
Details of the synthesis of the monomers and copolymers are given in the ESI.†
2.3 Device fabrication and characterization
The photovoltaic devices using copolymers as a donor and PC71BM as an acceptor were fabricated on the indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass substrate as follows: the ITO coated glass substrates were cleaned continuously in ultrasonic bath containing acetone, detergent, de-ionized water and isopropanol. Then the cleaned ITO glass substrates were dried by high purity nitrogen gas and then treated by UV-ozone for 10 min. The solution of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP Al 4093) was spin coated onto the cleaned ITO glass substrates at 2500 rpm for 30 s and subsequently dried at 100 °C for 20 minutes in air. The blends of P1 or P2 or P3:PC71BM of different weight ratios were prepared by dissolving the copolymers and fullerene derivatives in chloroform (CF) solution and stirring for about 2 h. For the solvent additive, i.e. DIO/CF, a small amount of DIO (3% by volume) is added to the CF solution. The photoactive layer of P1 or P2 or P3:PC71BM (in different ratios i.e. 1:0.5, 1:1, 1:2 and 1:2.5 and CF with small amount of the solvent additive DIO) was deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin coating and then dried in an ambient atmosphere. The optimized weight ratio is 1:2 and optimized solvent additive is 3 v%. Finally, an aluminum (Al) metal top electrode was deposited under vacuum on the active layer at a pressure of less than 10−5 Torr. The active area of the device was ca. 0.10 mm2. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 source meter unit. A xenon lamp coupled with a AM 1.5 optical filter was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the devices was measured using a monochromator and a xenon lamp as a light source and the resulting photocurrent was measured with a source meter under short circuit conditions.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of copolymers and characterization
In order to obtain new π-conjugated low bandgap thiophene–benzimidazole containing copolymers, we preliminary synthesized 5,8-dibromo-2-{4-[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]phenyl}-1-octyl-H-bisthieno[3,2-e:2′,3′-g]benzimidazole (M1), 5,8-dibromo-2-[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl]-1H-bisthieno[3,2-e:2′,3′-g]benzimidazole (M2) and 5,8-dibromo-2-[1′,1′,2′,2′,3′,3′,4′,4′-octafluorobutyl]-1H-bisthieno[3,2-e:2′,3′-g]benzimidazole (M3) by direct cyclization of aromatic α-diketone (1) with hetaryl-substituted aldehides 2, 3 and 4 with the formation of an imidazole cycle. In order to accomplish this the synthesis of different aryl- and hetaryl substituted aldehydes 2, 3 and 4 containing branched substituents was carried out as reported in the literature.16 Then, by means of condensation of 2,7-dibromobenzo-[2,1-b:4,5-b′]dithiophen-4,5-dione 1 with synthesized 4-(2-ethylhexyloxy)benzaldehyde 2 and 5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-carboxaldehyde 3 and 4 with ammonium acetate in acetic acid upon boiling, new compounds 5,8-dibromo-2-{4-[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]phenyl}-1H-bisthieno[3,2-e:2′,3′-g]benzimidazole (5), 5,8-dibromo-2-[5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl]-1H-bisthieno[3,2-e:2′,3′-g]benzimidazole (M2) and 5,8-dibromo-2-[1′,1′,2′,2′,3′,3,4′,4′-octafluorobutyl]-1H-bisthieno[3,2-e:2′,3′-g]benzimidazole (M3) were obtained with yields of 74, 77 and 67%, respectively, as shown in Scheme 1. N-Alkylation of compound 5 with octytiodide in the presence of K2CO3 gave the compound M1 with the yield of 88%. Alkyl substituents were introduced into donor molecules for increasing their and target co-polymeric materials’ solubility in organic solvents.
 Scheme 1  Synthesis of M1, M2 and M3 monomers. 
The composition and structures of intermediate compounds, and also targeted monomers M1, M2 and M3 were confirmed by elemental analysis data, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy (see the ESI†). In particular, in spectra 1H NMR of monomer M1 in the weak field area in the range 8.07–7.05 ppm two singlets and two doublets are present, which are related to protons of thiophene and phenyl units (Fig. S1, ESI†). In the strong field area at 4.43 and 3.95 ppm two resonances, typical for CH2 group directly bonded to atom of nitrogen and oxygen are present. In the range 1.70–0.70 multiplets related to protons of alkyl units are shown. The ratio of integral intensities of the aromatic part to aliphatic part well corresponds to the targeted structure of M1.
In 1H NMR of M2, the singlet at 7.78 ppm corresponds to the proton of the thiophene cycle, in proximity of the benzene ring and at 6.90 and 7.80 two doublets, corresponding to protons of the thiophene fragment, attached to the imidazole cycle. In the strong field area at 2.90, the signal resonates typical for the CH2 group, directly connected to the thiophene ring. In the range of 1.20–0.70, the signals appear, typical for the rest 15 protons of the aliphatic part of the monomer M2 (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The ratio of integral intensities of the aromatic part to aliphatic corresponds to the structure of M2. In the carbo spectrum of product M2, 18 signals are present, of which seven resonances are present in the range of 148.08–112.69 ppm, corresponding to ternary atoms of carbon of heterocyclic and thiophene substituents. In the stronger field 42.41–11.23 ppm, 8 peaks appear related to 8 atoms of carbon of branched 2-ethylhexyl substituents of the thiophene fragment (Fig. S2b, ESI†).
In proton spectra of M3 in the range of 13.50–6.50, three signals and one triplet are seen, related to the proton of the imidazole cycle, thiophene fragment and octafluorobutyl fragment, respectively (Fig. S3a, ESI†). In 19F NMR spectra of M3, four intensive signals are present, related to four couple equivalent atoms of fluorine (Fig. S3b, ESI†).
Obtained heteroaromatic thiophene–benzimidazole containing monomers M1, M2, and M3 were used for the synthesis of new low bandgap D–A conjugated copolymers P1, P2 and P3 under the conditions of the cross-coupling Stille reaction as shown in Scheme 2. Polycondensation was carried out in the atmosphere of argon in toluene, using tetrakis(triphenylphosphine) palladium as a catalyst. The role of the electron accepting component in the structures of P1, P2 and P3 copolymers is dithienobentheinodizole, weak electron donors fragments are monomers M1, M2 and M3, respectively. The obtained polymers P1, P2 and P3 were purified from the residues of catalysts, tin-organic and low molecular impurities by two-fold re-sedimentation from solution in methanol and following extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform. The yield of polymers P1, P2 and P3 was 75–87%. The composition and structure of polymers P1, P2 and P3 were confirmed by elemental analysis data and 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectroscopy. In particular, 1H NMR spectra of P2 (Fig. S4, ESI†) shows that 6 aromatic protons of the elementary chain are resonating in the range of 8.50–7.50 ppm. The signals of protons of aliphatic fragments are present in the range of 2.50–0.50 ppm. The ratio of integral intensities of aromatic and aliphatic protons for copolymers P1 and P3 well corresponds to the proposed structures and confirms the appearance of the elemental chains on the macromolecules.
 Scheme 2  Synthesis of P1, P2 and P3 D–A copolymers. 
The thermal properties of the P1, P2 and P3 were investigated via DSC and TGA methods and the data were summarized in Table 1. The glass transition temperature of P1, P2 and P3 estimated from DSC measurement are 185°, 200° and 195 °C, respectively. All the copolymers have sufficient high thermal stabilities. These results show that the copolymers show thermal stabilities sufficiently high for their use in polymer solar cells.

3.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The normalized UV-visible absorption spectra of the three copolymers in chloroform solution and in the thin film are shown in Fig. 1a and b, respectively, and corresponding data are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen from the Fig. 1 and Table 2 that both in solution and in the solid state, two main absorption bands are observed, which is typical for D–A copolymers.17 The absorption band in the longer wavelength region comes from intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units, while the shorter wavelength band is attributed to the π–π* transition of the polymer main chain. Since all the polymers have same acceptor skeleton benzothiadiazole and different donor skeletons, both absorption bands in shorter and longer wavelength regions are different due to the different polymer main chain and different ICT abilities. As for the longer wavelength bands, the absorption band of P1 is blue shifted compared to P2 and P2 is blue shifted compared to P3, which can be attributed to the different electron donating strength of electron donating units. In solution absorption peaks in longer wavelength regions are located at 608 nm, 514 nm and 645 nm, for P1, P2 and P3, respectively, which correspondingly redshifted to 638 nm, 524 nm and 670 nm for the spectra in the thin film. These bathochromic shifts in the absorption band in the thin film compared to those in solution suggest a stronger interchain pi–pi stacking and a high degree of ordered arrangement in thin films. It was observed that only a minimal red-shift occurs for the absorption maximum of P1 in going from solution to thin film. This may be attributed to the fact that the polymer chain aggregate somewhat in solution for P1 because of CF2 substituents present in the backbone, imposing less barrier to the chain interaction compared to other copolymers. All the copolymers exhibit strong absorption ability in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 800 nm which is beneficial for harvesting of more sunlight and thus may lead to enhanced Jsc in polymer solar cells. Compared to P3, P2 exhibits significant blue shifts of the absorption maxima (ICT band) with 33 nm and 42 nm for solution and thin film, which may be due to the weaker electron ability of the benzene ring compared to that of the thiophene ring, resulting in decreased electron delocalization along the P2 backbone. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) estimated from the onsets of the thin film absorption spectra were 1.61 eV, 1.50 eV and 1.56 eV for P1, P2 and P3, respectively.

Electrochemical properties of polymers were investigated using cyclic voltammetry. Cyclic voltammetry of polymer films was investigated in acetonitrile with 0.1 M tetrabutylammonim perchlorate (Bu4NCIO4) at a scan speed of 50 mV s−1. A platinum electrode was used as the counter-electrode, Ag/Ag+ in 0.1 M solution of AgNO3 as a reference electrode, and Fc/Fc+ as an external standard. The results of cyclic voltammograms are presented in Fig. 2 and data were summarized in Table 2. Both the copolymers exhibit reversible or partly reversible redox properties. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated from their onset oxidation potential and onset reduction potential, respectively according to the following expressions:EHOMO = −q(Eoxonset + 4.48) eVELUMO = −q(Eredonset + 4.48) eV
 Fig. 2  Cyclic voltammetry curves of copolymers P1, P2 and P3 films on platinum electrode in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NClO4 in CH3CN solution at scan rate of 50 mV S−1. 
The HOMO energy level of P1, P2 and P3 are −5.24 eV, −5.37 eV and −5.25 eV, respectively. The deeper HOMO energy level of all copolymers may be helpful for achieving high open circuit voltage (Voc) and air stability.18 It is well known that the HOMO energy level of the D–A copolymer is mainly governed by the electron donors,19 and therefore different HOMO levels are attributed to the different electron donor skeleton. The deeper HOMO energy level for P2 as compared to other copolymers may be attributed to the thienyl unit present in the donor. Due to the twisting of the thienyl plane with the thiophene-imidazole plane, this conjugated plane act as a weaker electron donor and gives rise to a deeper HOMO energy level than P1 and P3.20 The LUMO levels of P1, P2 and P3 are −3.74 eV, −3.72 and −3.70 eV, respectively. The similar values of LUMO levels for these copolymers may attribute to the same acceptor skeleton. The LUMO offsets between the donor copolymers and PC71BM (−4.1 eV) are larger than 0.3 eV, which is sufficient for effective exciton dissociation and charge transfer.21
3.3 Photovoltaic properties
PSC devices were fabricated to evaluate and compare the photovoltaic properties of these copolymers. We have used a commonly used device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Al. The active layers of the devices were prepared by using DIO as a solvent additive in chloroform as a processing solvent. We have optimized the copolymer/PC71BM ratio and found that the optimized ratio is 1:2 (w/w) for all P1, P2 and P3 blends with PC71BM and small amount of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) (3 v%) was used to optimize their photovoltaic performance. The concentration of DIO was varied from 1%, 2%, 3% and 4% and we found that 3% is the optimal volume amount. We will discuss the results only for the optimum conditions.

Fig. 3a displays the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs based on the P1, P2 and P3 as the donor and PC71BM as the acceptor. The corresponding photovoltaic data obtained from the J–V characteristics are complied in Table 3. It can be seen from the Table 3 that the device based on P2 shows a Voc of 0.92 V which is the highest one in the three types of PSCs, which is attributed to the deeper HOMO level of P2 (−5.37 eV) compared to P1 and P3. The similar values of Voc for P1 and P3 are in good agreement with the similar values of their HOMO energy level. The devices based on P1 and P3 show Jsc values of 9.82 mA cm−2 and 11.12 mA cm−2, respectively, which are lower than that of the device of P2 (11.48 mA cm−2). The over all PCEs of the devices based on P1 and P3 are 4.55% and 5.16%, respectively which are much lower than that of the device based on P2 (PCE = 6.76%). The IPCE spectra of the devices are displayed in Fig. 3b. It can be seen from this figure that the IPCE spectra of these three devices have a different response range and similar to their absorption profiles, which covers the whole visible range up to 720 nm for P2 and P3 and 650 nm for P1. The device based on P2 shows higher IPCE values than that of devices based on P1 and P2, which is consistent with the J–V characteristics. Although the absorption band of P2 is narrower than other two copolymers, but the IPCE spectra is broader than the absorption spectra of P2, which may be attributed to the better nanomorphology of the P2:PC71BM blend compared to other blends and this leads to the improved absorption in the longer wavelength regions and contributes to the photocurrent generation. Moreover, we have also estimated the values of Jsc from the integration of IPCE spectra, which were about 9.68 mA cm−2, 11.40 mA cm−2 and 11.02 mA cm−2 for P1, P2 and P3 based BHJ polymer solar cells, which are very close to the values observed in J–V characteristics.

A important factor to control the Jsc is the crystallinity of the donor copolymer, because a high crystalline copolymer affords efficient charge carrier transport to the electrode after exciton dissociation. We measured the crystallinity of the copolymers blended with PC71BM by an X-ray diffraction method and shown in Fig. 4. The XRD pattern of the three copolymers reveals that P1 and P3 showed a weaker diffraction peak of (100) compared to P2, indicating that the P2 has the highest crystallinity. In other words, the degree of crystallinity is of the order of P2, P3 and P1. The improved crystallinity of P2:PC71BM compared to other blends causes efficient charge transport.

We have measured the hole mobilities of the three copolymers blended with PC71BM by the standard method using a single carrier device to correlate crystallinity to the charge transport. The dark current–voltages characteristics in dark (log–log scale) were measured using a hole only device (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/copolymer:PC71BM/Au) and shown in Fig. 5 and shows straight lines with a slope near two, indicating that the current is space charge limited (SCL). The voltage has been corrected as V = Vapp−Vbi, where Vbi is the built in potential due to the difference in the work function of the anode and cathode. We have achieved the SCLC region at quite lower voltages, which may be attributed to the low value of thickness of the active layer. The experimental data were fitted with SCLC model22 (solid line in Fig. 5) and hole mobility was estimated using the Mott–Gurney law and complied in Table 3. We have also estimated the electron mobilities for all the blends using an electron only device i.e. ITO/Al/copolymer:PC71BM/Al and the estimated values for all blends is about 2.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The increase in hole mobility from P2 to P3 and P3 to P1 reduces the ratio between the electron and hole mobilities from 8.94 to 4.37 (P3 to P1) and 4.37 to 3.05 (P1 to P2), respectively, which indicates a more balanced charge transport in the device based on P2:PC71BM. The balance charge transport within the active layer resulted in high Jsc and FF.

The surface morphology properties of copolymers:PC71BM blend films were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). The topography and phase images of copolymers:PC71BM prepared from DIO/CF solvent are shown in Fig. 6. All the blended thin films showed different morphological properties. The mean square surface roughness of the films is 3.44 nm, 1.72 nm and 2.14 nm for P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM and P3:PC71BM films, respectively. The phase images of these films also exhibit different domain sizes, i.e. 38 nm, 18 nm and 22 nm, for P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM, and P3:PC71BM, respectively. The domain size of P1:PC71BM is too large for efficient exciton dissociation; since the exciton diffusion length in most of the organic semiconductors is only 10–20 nm,22,23 thus the big domain size in the blend will cause strong germinate recombination.

We have estimated the maximum exciton generation rate (Gmax) and exciton dissociation probability [P(E,T)] of the three blends according to the method reported in the literature24 and compared them to analyze the photovoltaic performance of the devices. Fig. 7 shows the variation of the photocurrent density (Jph) with effective voltage (Veff). Here Jph = JL−JD, where JL and JD are the current density under illumination (100 mW cm−2) and under dark conditions, respectively, and Veff = Vo−Vapp, where Vo is the voltage at the point at which Jph = 0, and Vapp is the applied voltage. We assume that all of the photogenerated excitons are dissociated into free charge carriers at high Veff due to a sufficient electric field25 and therefore, the Gmax can be determined from the saturation current density (Jsat), i.e. Jsat = qGmaxL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the thickness of the active layer. The value of Gmax was estimated from Fig. 7 and the above expression, which is 4.67 × 1027 m−3 s−1, 7.8 × 1027 m−3 s−1 and 9.2 × 1027 m−3 s−1, for P1:PC71BM, P3:PC71BM and P2:PC71BM based devices, respectively. This difference is probably due to the value of molar extinction coefficients and the absorption profile of the blends. As the P2 has a broader absorption profile compared to others, the higher value of Gmax for a device based on P2:PC71BM may be due to the broader absorption profile. We have also estimated the P(E,T), which is a function of the electric field and temperature, using the relation Jph = qGmaxP(E,T)L, under short circuit conditions. The P(E,T) values of P1:PC71BM, P2:PC71BM and P3:PC71BM under short circuit conditions are 72%, 85% and 78%, respectively, suggesting that exciton dissociation probability is higher in the P2:PC71BM than in the other two blends, which is attributed to the better nanophase morphology of this blend.

4. Conclusions
In this study, three low bandgap D–A conjugated copolymers P1, P2 and P3 based on different weak donor fused thiophene-imidazole containing derivatives units and a same benzothiadiazole acceptor unit were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling polymerization and were characterized by 1H NMR, elemental analysis and GPC, TGA, DSC. These copolymers exhibit broad absorption in the visible and near infrared region of the solar spectrum and low lying HOMO energy levels. Application of these copolymers as a donor along with PC71BM as an acceptor in BHJ solar cells provides high Voc and optimization of solar cells by solvent additive gave a PCE of 6.76% for the device based on a P2:PC71BM active layer. These results show that the design of D–A copolymers with a weaker donor and stronger acceptor structure is the excellent strategy for improvement in BHJ organic solar cells.
