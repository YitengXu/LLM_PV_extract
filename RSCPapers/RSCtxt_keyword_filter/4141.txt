Both metal-complex N719 and metal-free organic dye CM309 were employed to fabricate devices. For the devices sensitized by N719, when using PEDOT and MWNT CEs, power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 5.2 and 4.9% were obtained, respectively, which were much higher than that of the device using the traditional Pt CE (4.7%) when HQ/BQ electrolyte was employed. However, with the HQ/BQ redox shuttle, the efficiency of the devices sensitized by N719 is much lower than that of the devices when the traditional I−/I3− based electrolyte and Pt CE were employed (7.9%). While for the CM309 sensitized solar cells, when the HQ/BQ redox shuttle was employed, PEDOT and MWNT performed much better than Pt, the DSSC using the PEDOT CE showed an efficiency of 6.2%, which was close to that of the DSSC using the traditional I−/I3− electrolyte and Pt CE (6.3%).
Introduction
With the increasing energy crisis, making full use of solar energy resources is important and necessary. As a powerful photovoltaic device, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have achieved great progress after two decades of research.1–6 Generally, a DSSC possesses three primary components: a photoanode (a dye-sensitized oxide semiconductor), an electrolyte containing a redox couple (usually I−/I3−), and a counter electrode (CE). As a crucial component, the CE is generally conductive F-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass deposited with Pt as a catalyst. However, the high price and dissolution of Pt in corrosive electrolytes restrict the mass production of DSSCs. To resolve this problem, several low-cost catalysts have been proposed to replace Pt, such as carbon materials,7,8 conductive polymers,9,10 and composite materials.11,12 The electrolyte is another key component of DSSCs. Recently, many good results have been reported,13,14 such as metal complexes,15–18 hole conductors,19–21 halogens,22–24 and some electroactive organic compounds.25–29 Hydroquinone (HQ) is very strong reductant, which can lose two electrons to form benzoquinone (BQ). The redox potential, which is more positive than that of I−/I3− but more negative than the HOMO of most sensitizers, is suitable for DSSCs. A much higher Voc can be expected when the redox couple HQ/BQ is employed. We have successfully formulated a new type of hybrid electrolyte involving a HQ/BQ redox couple and applied it to DSSCs.30 However, in the hybrid electrolyte system, there will still be a trace of iodine produced during the work process. This is very harmful. The aim of the present work is to remove the iodine anion in the hybrid system and platinum (Pt). Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) were proposed for use as counter electrode (CE) catalysts in DSSCs, combined with the HQ/BQ electrolyte. Studies on the catalytic activity of these three CEs for the regeneration of the HQ/BQ redox couple and the performances of the devices fabricated with the HQ/BQ electrolyte using these three CEs were conducted.
Results and discussion
Catalytic activity of PEDOT, MWNT and Pt for the HQ/BQ redox couple
Tafel-polarization measurement was used in the experiment to confirm the catalytic activity of these three CE catalysts (Fig. 1). The electrolyte used is the same as in the DSSCs tests (0.1 M HQ, 0.05 M BQ, 0.2 M LiTFSI, 0.4 M TBP). Theoretically, the Tafel curve can be divided into three zones. The curve at low potential (|U| < 120 mV) can be attributed to the polarization zone, the curve at intermediate potential (with a sharp slope) can be attributed to the Tafel zone, and the curve at high potential (horizontal part) can be attributed to the diffusion zone. In the latter two zones, information on the exchange current density (J0) and the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) was indicated, which was closely related to the catalytic activity of the catalysts. In the diffusion zone, the Jlim of the PEDOT, MWNT CEs were observed to be of the same magnitude, which is much higher than that of Pt CE. This finding indicated that much better diffusion properties were available for PEDOT and MWNT CEs in the electrolyte. In the Tafel zone, the curves of PEDOT and MWNT exhibited gentler slopes demonstrating a larger J0 on the surfaces of the electrodes compared with that on the surfaces of the Pt electrode. This result indicated that PEDOT and MWNT were much more effective for catalyzing the reduction of BQ compared with Pt.

To better understand the electron transport, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was also utilized to test thin symmetric cells (SCs) and the resultant Nyquist plots and Bode plots of different samples are presented in Fig. 2. Typically, the intercept on the real axis (high frequency) can be attributed to the series resistance (Rs). The left semicircle (middle frequency) can be assigned to the resistance capacitance networks of the electrode/electrolyte interface, including the charge transfer resistance (Rct) and the corresponding capacitance (Cu). The right semicircle (low frequency) can be assigned to the diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple (HQ/BQ) in the electrolyte. Based on previous research, internal resistance has a negative effect on the performance of DSSCs. In the current research, the Rct values of Pt, PEDOT and MWNT were 18.0, 2.3 and 2.9 Ω, respectively, indicating that the PEDOT and MWNT CEs were much more efficient for catalyzing the reduction of BQ to HQ. The values of the ZN for the PEDOT and MWNT electrodes are much smaller than that of Pt, indicating a faster diffusion velocity of the redox species in the electrolyte. The test results are in accordance with the Tafel-polarization tests.

Photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs using PEDOT, MWNT and Pt CEs
The photovoltaic performance was measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a mask of 0.159 cm2. Both the metal-complex N719 and the metal-free organic dye CM309 were employed as photosensitizes and the CEs mentioned above were used as counter electrodes to fabricate solar cells. The detailed composition of the new electrolyte based on the HQ/BQ redox couple is 0.1 M HQ, 0.05 M BQ, 0.2 M LiTFSI, 0.4 M TBP in CH3CN. The structure of sensitizers N719 and CM309 are shown in Fig. 3. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs are displayed in Fig. 4 and 5, where short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and power conversion efficiency (η) can be determined. The corresponding data are collected in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. For comparison, the devices employing traditional I−/I3− and Pt CE were also prepared and tested.

For the devices sensitized by N719, an overall conversion efficiency of 4.7% was achieved employing the new HQ/BQ based electrolyte and the Pt CE, with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 10.62 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 753 mV and a fill factor (FF) of 59.1%. Under the same conditions, the FF of the device fabricated with MWNT CE was improved; correspondingly, a much higher efficiency of 4.9% (Voc = 753 mV, Jsc = 10.62 mA cm−2 and FF = 59.1%) was achieved. The device employing PEDOT CE demonstrated the highest efficiency with the highest FF. The improvements of FF when MWNT and PEDOT CEs were employed can mainly be attributed to the much higher catalytic activity and much better diffusion properties of these two CEs. However, the efficiencies of the HQ/BQ based electrolyte are much lower when compared with the device fabricated with the traditional I−/I3− based electrolyte and Pt CE (7.9%), particularly the obviously decreased Jsc. While, the Voc is much higher for the device employing the HQ/BQ based electrolyte compared with that of the device fabricated with the I−/I3− based electrolyte. Two reasons can explain this significant difference. One is the new electrolyte with HQ/BQ as redox couple can prevent the charge recombination and lead to a higher voltage.31 This effect can be observed in the electrochemical impedance spectra and the electron-lifetime in TiO2 of the corresponding devices (see Fig. 7a and 8a). The other one is the larger gap between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the potential of redox couple HQ/BQ than that between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the potential of I−/I3−.14,30

Similarly, for the devices fabricated with CM309-sensitized porous TiO2 and the HQ/BQ based electrolyte, much higher Voc and FF were also achieved for PEDOT and MWNT CEs. However, different from the devices sensitized by N719, with the HQ/BQ based electrolyte, the Jsc of the devices sensitized by CM309 are as high as that of the device fabricated with the traditional I−/I3− based electrolyte and Pt CE. An efficiency of 6.2% was achieved with PEDOT CE. Under the same conditions, the device fabricated with the traditional I−/I3− based electrolyte and Pt CE displayed a slightly higher efficiency of 6.3%, which can mainly attributed to the much higher FF considering the much lower Voc and similar Jsc. Much higher efficiency can be achieved with the sensitizer CM309. This is mainly because the introduction of long alkyl chains in the structure of CM309 can suppress the recombination of electrolyte and electron efficiently.
The IPCE spectra of the devices sensitized by N719 vary a lot with different electrolytes employed (see Fig. 6a). The IPCE value for the device fabricated with the HQ/BQ based electrolyte is much lower than that of the device employing the I−/I3− based electrolyte; correspondingly, a much lower Jsc (about 10.6 mA cm−2) was achieved. While for the devices sensitized by CM309, similar IPCE spectra were obtained for both the HQ/BQ based electrolyte and the I−/I3− based electrolyte with the same CEs (see Fig. 6b).
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of DSSCs
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis was employed to study the interfacial charge transfer processes in DSSCs based on these different electrolytes with the Pt CEs and they were scanned from 106 to 10−2 Hz at room temperature in dark conditions. The bias voltage was −0.80 V. The alternating current (AC) amplitude was set at 10 mV. The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 7. Some important parameters can be obtained by fitting the EIS spectra to an electrochemical model. RS, Rrec and RCE represent the series resistances, charge-transfer resistances at the dye/TiO2/electrolyte interface and counter electrode (CE), respectively. For the device sensitized by N719, RCE = 18.7 Ω when the HQ/BQ based electrolyte was employed. In contrast, RCE = 3.6 Ω was detected for the device fabricated with the I−/I3− based electrolyte. The higher RCE value indicates that the oxidized species of the redox couple are regenerated slowly on the surface of the counter electrode and probably causes the lower fill factor recorded for the device employing the HQ/BQ based electrolyte. The Rrec also varies considerably. One can see that the Rrec values are 65.1 and 19.9 Ω for the devices employing the HQ/BQ and I−/I3− electrolytes, respectively. The result indicates that with the HQ/BQ based electrolyte, the electron recombination rate between the TiO2 film and the electrolyte is efficiently restricted. Correspondingly, a much higher Voc value was obtained. Similar test results were obtained for DSSCs sensitized by CM309. The RCE of the device employing HQ/BQ based electrolyte is about five times that of the device with the I−/I3− based electrolyte and the Rrec values are 72.0 and 32.5 Ω for the devices employing the HQ/BQ and I−/I3− electrolytes, respectively.
Experimental
Tafel-polarization measurement was conducted under AM 1.5G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a mask of 0.159 cm2. The photovoltaic performance was measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar light at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 with a mask of 0.159 cm2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured with an impedance/gain-phase analyzer (PARSTAT 2273, USA) under dark conditions, with a forward bias of −0.80 V.
Preparation of counter electrodes
The PEDOT and MWNT counter electrodes were prepared according to previous literature.32–34
Platinized, fluorine-doped, tin oxide (FTO) conducting glass (Pt CEs) electrodes were prepared by sintering 20 μL of 5 mM H2PtCl6 isopropanol solution uniformly distributed on the surface of the FTO substrates. The Pt amount is determined to about 8.6 μg cm−2.
The PEDOT CEs were prepared by electrochemical polymerization on 1.5 × 1.5 cm FTO substrates using a cyclic voltammetric (CV) method. The glass substrates were washed with deionised water, acetone and ethanol and subsequently heated at 400 °C for 30 min. Pt foil (1 cm2) served as the counter electrode and an Ag/Ag+ electrode as the reference electrode. The distance between counter electrode and electrode of polymer deposition was 1.0–1.2 cm. The process was performed in 20 mM 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT), 0.1 M lithium perchlorate (LiClO4) acetonitrile (CH3CN) solution via CV scans of 1 or 2 cycles at a sweep rate of 50 mV s−1 over the potential range between −0.6 and 1.2 V (0 V → 1.2 V → −0.6 V → 0 V) vs. Ag/Ag+. The prepared PEDOT electrodes were then washed with pure CH3CN, dried in air and left for 1 h at room temperature. The SEM of the CE is shown in Fig. 9.

The direct current electrophoretic deposition was used to prepare MWNT electrodes. Approximately 75 mg of MWNTs from desiccators was added into 300 mL anhydrous isopropanol and sonicated for 60 min to disperse the MWNTs. Mg(NO3)·6H2O (65 μM) was added and the sonication continued for another 15 min to get a Mg2+-adsorbed MWNT suspension. About 10 mL of the suspension was added into a quartz cell (30 mm long × 12 mm wide × 40 mm deep), where platinum foil (1 × 1 cm) was used as the anode and an FTO glass sheet (1.5 × 1.5 cm) was used as the cathode. EPD was performed at 160 V and sustained for 3 min. The resulting MWNT film with uniform and compact morphology was found to be about 0.4 mg in weight with a measured surface area. The SEM of the MWNT CE is shown in Fig. 9.
Fabrication of DSSCs
The DSSCs were fabricated according to the previous literature with modification.35 A layer of 2 μm TiO2 (13 nm paste, Heptachroma, China) was coated on the F-doped tin oxide conducting glass (TEC15, 15 Ω □−1, Pilkington, USA) by screen printing and then dried for 5 min at 125 °C. This procedure was repeated 3 times (6 μm) and finally coated by a layer (4 μm) of TiO2 paste (DHS–SLP1, Heptachroma, China) as the scattering layer. The double-layer TiO2 electrodes (area: 6 × 6 mm) were heated under an air flow at 520 °C for 30 min, and then cooled to room temperature. The sintered film was further treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min, then washed with water, and annealed at 520 °C for 30 min. After the film was cooled to room temperature, it was immersed into a 2 × 10−4 M dye bath. The electrode was then rinsed with EtOH and dried. The hermetically sealed cells were fabricated by assembling the dye-loaded film as the working electrode and the counter electrode was separated with a hot-melt Surlyn 1702 film (25 μm, Dupont). The light source for the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurement is an AM 1.5G solar simulator (16S-002, Solar Light Co. Ltd, USA). The incident light intensity was 100 mW cm−2 calibrated with a standard Si solar cell. The tested solar cells were masked to a working area of 0.159 cm2. The photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained by the linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) method using an electrochemical workstation (LK9805, Lanlike Co. Ltd, China). The measurement of the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was performed a Hypermono-light (SM-25, Jasco Co. Ltd., Japan). The Jsc was calibrated by integrating the IPCE value-tuned light density of AM 1.5G versus wavelength.
Conclusions
In summary, tetramethylammonium hydroquinone (HQ)/benzoquinone (BQ) was developed for use as a redox couple, along with PEDOT and MWNT being proposed for use as counter electrode (CE) catalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). Both the metal-complex N719, and metal-free organic dye CM309, were employed to fabricate the devices. For the devices sensitized by N719, the devices using PEDOT and MWNT CE yielded PCE values of 5.2 and 4.9%, which were much higher than that of the device using Pt CE (4.7%) when employing HQ/BQ electrolyte. However, with the HQ/BQ redox shuttle, the efficiency of the devices sensitized by N719 is much lower than that of the devices when the traditional I−/I3− electrolyte and Pt CE were employed (7.9%). On the other hand, when the metal-free organic dye CM309, with many long alkyl chains, was employed as the sensitizer with the HQ/BQ based electrolyte, the devices fabricated with PEDOT and MWNT CEs performed much better than the Pt CE. The device using the PEDOT CE and the HQ/BQ based electrolyte showed an efficiency of 6.2%, which was close to that of the DSSC using the traditional I−/I3− electrolyte and Pt CE (6.3%). The stabilities of DSSCs employing this electrolyte are not very high. Future work will be focused on improving the stability of DSSCs with this electrolyte.
