    , Accepted 3rd March 2022First published on 3rd March 2022AbstractThe structural and electronic transport properties of tetragonal CH3NH3SnBr3 single crystals (T-MASnBr3 SCs) are rarely reported. In this study, we synthesized T-MASnBr3 single crystals by volatilizing DMF solvent at room temperature. The crystal system and space group of the T-MASnBr3 SC are tetragonal and P4/mmm, respectively. In addition, the nitrogen atom in the methylamine group exhibits position disorder. The band gap of the T-MASnBr3 SC was determined to be 2.07 eV using the Tauc plot. Six fluorescence peaks and a lifetime up to 10 microseconds were observed in the steady-state fluorescence spectra and time-resolved fluorescence spectra of the T-MASnBr3 SC, respectively. The carrier mobility (electron) of T-MASnBr3 was 321 cm2 V−1 s−1. The curve of ln(square resistance) against T−1 was a straight line. The value of the activation energy (Ea) was 5421 J mol−1. The stability of the T-MASnBr3 SC was good before 473 K. The results indicate that T-MASnBr3 SCs have promising applications in the field of temperature sensors.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have attracted scientists’ interest because of their superior performance in the field of solar cells.1–3 However, the classical organic–inorganic perovskites contain toxic lead, which will affect the environment.4 Thus, the development of lead-free perovskites is a very important research direction. At present, lead-free perovskites include Sn,5,6 Ge,7 Pd,8 Mn,9 Sb10 and Cu-based perovskites,11 as well as bimetallic perovskite materials, for example, M2AgBiX6 (M = CH3NH3+, Cs; X = I, Br and Cl), etc.12 Among them, Sn-based perovskites as one of the lead-free perovskites exhibit good properties. MASnBr3 perovskite films prepared by sequential deposition had a higher efficiency (1.12%) than those prepared by the co-evaporated method.13 The Mercouri G. Kanatzidis group prepared MASnBr3 compounds by mixing stoichiometric amounts of MABr and SnBr2, and finely homogenizing in a mortar in a nitrogen glove box. Lead-free solar cells based on MASnBr3 realized a power conversion efficiency of 4.27% under simulated full sunlight.5 An efficiency of 8.79% was achieved for MASnBr3−xIx quantum dots and N719 co-sensitized mesoscopic solar cells.14
Although Sn-based perovskite films showed clues in different device structures, the intrinsic photoelectric properties of Sn-based perovskites are not clear. Compared with thin films of MASnBr3, single crystals of MASnBr3 have fewer defects, which allows us to accurately understand the intrinsic photoelectric properties of MASnBr3. In this study, tetragonal MASnBr3 single crystals were synthesized by volatilizing DMF solvent at room temperature. The structural (crystal system, space group and unit-cell parameters), optical (steady-state fluorescence spectra and time-resolved fluorescence spectra) and electronic transport properties (carrier and mobility) of T-MASnBr3 were studied.
The photograph of the T-MASnBr3 single crystals prepared by volatilizing the solution (1 mmol SnBr2 and MABr in 1 mL of dimethylfumarate solvent) at room temperature is shown in Fig. 1a. The color of the T-MASnBr3 SC is red. To study the crystal structure of the T-MASnBr3 SC, we carried out single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. The diffraction wavelength obtained from Mo Kα radiation was 0.71073 Å. Diffraction data were collected using ‘Bruker smart’. The data were reduced using ‘Bruker saint’. The solution and refinement of the T-MASnBr3 crystal structure were performed using ‘shellxs-97’. The detailed crystal structure and refinement of the T-MASnBr3 SC are shown in Table 1. The crystal system and space group of the T-MASnBr3 SC are tetragonal and P4/mmm, respectively. The unit-cell parameters are as follows: a = 5.8693(7) Å, alpha = 90°; b = 5.8693(7) Å, beta = 90°; and c = 11.7229(12) Å, gamma = 90°. In addition, the methylamine group is in a disordered state. The nitrogen atom exhibits position disorder. The bond length and bond angle and other crystallographic data are listed in Tables S1–5.† A schematic diagram of the crystal structure of the T-MASnBr3 SC (viewed along the a-axis) is shown in Fig. 1b. The diffraction pattern calculated using Diamond software using the refinement data is shown in Fig. 1c. The diffraction pattern of a pile of crystals obtained by powder XRD is also shown in Fig. 1c. Their diffraction patterns are consistent. The strong diffraction peaks at 15.083, 15.103, 30.435, 30.477, 43.58 and 43.611 degrees, respectively, correspond to the (010), (002), (020), (004), (220) and (024) crystal planes. The weak diffraction peaks from impure substances may be caused by structural decomposition or oxidation of crystals exposed to air in powder XRD measurement.

The crystal morphology and elemental content were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The SEM images are shown in Fig. 2a. The morphology of the T-MASnBr3 SC shows that the crystal surface is smooth and there are few defects. The results of elemental content analysis show that the ratio of bromine to tin is close to 3:1, which is consistent with the molecular formula obtained by refinement of the single crystal data. There is an error in the content of carbon and nitrogen. This is mainly due to their few electron shells and the interference of nitrogen and carbon elements of air in the SEM chamber.

The absorption and reflection spectra of the T-MASnBr3 SC are shown in Fig. 3a. A strong absorption in the range of 300 to 600 nm was observed. The absorption intensity decreased sharply at 600 nm. The diffuse reflectance spectrum shows that the reflection of the T-MASnBr3 SC increased suddenly at 600 nm. This result is consistent with the result of the absorption spectrum. Fig. 3b shows the Tauc plot [hν − (hνF(R∞))2] of the T-MASnBr3 SC, where h is the Planck constant, ν is the frequency of light, F(R∞) = (1 − R)2/2R and R is the reflectivity. The band gap of the T-MASnBr3 SC was determined to be 2.07 eV using the Tauc plot. Thus, the T-MASnBr3 SC is suitable for a visible light absorption layer for tandem solar cells with a heterojunction silicon solar cell, so as to make full use of the solar spectrum. Fig. 3c and d, respectively, show the steady-state fluorescence and time-resolved fluorescence spectra of the T-MASnBr3 SC. The excitation wavelength was 350 nm. Six fluorescence peaks appeared at 430, 489, 545, 587, 616 and 700 nm. The phenomenon of multiple fluorescence peaks of T-MASnBr3 is rare in perovskite materials in the literature. The results of time-resolved fluorescence spectra show a lifetime up to 10 microseconds for the T-MASnBr3 SC.

The electronic transport behavior of semiconductors determines the performance of materials and devices. The T-MASnBr3 bulk (1 cm2) was prepared by a pressing mechanism, as shown in Fig. 4a. The sample thickness was 1.5 mm. The electronic transport characteristics of the T-MASnBr3 bulk were measured using the Hall effect system (K2500, USA, 4-point probe) under 1 T magnetic field intensity. The detailed electronic transport behavior is shown in Table 2. The results indicate that the carriers of T-MASnBr3 are electrons, that is, they are n-type semiconductors. The carrier mobility of T-MASnBr3 was 321 cm2 V−1 s−1. The variable temperature experiment reveals that the curve of ln(square resistance) against T−1 was a straight line. In other words, the square resistance reduces gradually with the increase of temperature from 298 to 442 K. The value of the activation energy (Ea) was 5421 J mol−1. This result indicates that T-MASnBr3 SCs have promising applications in the field of temperature sensors. Finally, we tested the thermal stability of the T-MASnBr3 SC. The T-MASnBr3 SC began to decompose from 473 K. The decomposition process is divided into two steps. The weight loss in the first step is 30%, which corresponds to the decomposition of the methylamine group in the T-MASnBr3 SC.
