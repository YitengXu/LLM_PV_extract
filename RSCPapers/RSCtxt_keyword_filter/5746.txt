    , Accepted 17th May 2012First published on 17th May 2012AbstractThe performance of polymer–fullerene bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells is strongly dependent on the vertical distribution of the donor and acceptor regions within the BHJ layer. In this work, we investigate in detail the effect of the hole transport layer (HTL) physical properties and the thermal annealing on the BHJ morphology and the solar cell performance. For this purpose, we have prepared solar cells with four distinct formulations of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) buffer layers. The samples were subjected to thermal annealing, applied either before (pre-annealing) or after (post-annealing) the cathode metal deposition. The effect of the HTL and the annealing process on the BHJ ingredient distribution – namely, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) – has been studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry and atomic force microscopy. The results revealed P3HT segregation at the top region of the films, which had a detrimental effect on all pre-annealed devices, whereas PCBM was found to accumulate at the bottom interface. This demixing process depends on the PEDOT:PSS surface energy; the more hydrophilic the surface the more profound is the vertical phase separation within the BHJ. At the same time those samples suffer from high recombination losses as evident from the analysis of the J–V measurements obtained in the dark. Our results underline the significant effect of the HTL–active and active–ETL (electron transport layer) interfacial composition that should be taken into account during the optimization of all polymer–fullerene solar cells.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells have attracted significant interest due to their great technological potential as a renewable energy source, the low weight and mechanical flexibility of organic materials and the easy thin-film casting technology.1–4 Since bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells had been introduced in 1995,5 a substantial progress in organic solar cell performance has been achieved. Efficiencies of 5% have been reported for the most studied system consisting of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and a methanofullerene derivative [6,6]-phenyl C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM),6,7 while efficiencies up to 7.4% have been realized for low-bandgap benzodithiophene polymers.8 Although a lot of research has been focused on the increase of solar cell efficiency, the morphology evolution that affects the device performance and lifetime is still under investigation. This is because of its dependence on the processing parameters including the thermal annealing treatment (prior to or after the top metal cathode deposition),6,9,10 the solvent used,11 the solvent annealing or slow drying process,12,13 the polymer–fullerene ratio,14,15 the use of additives16,17 and the environmental conditions.18 Furthermore, the detailed investigation of BHJ blends is quite challenging, as few techniques are able to characterize such organic thin films with adequate lateral and vertical resolution at the nanoscale.
A vertical compositional gradient within the active layer with a donor-enriched active–anode interface and an acceptor-enriched active–cathode interface can facilitate charge extraction from the BHJ to the electrodes. Indeed, high performance solar cells cannot be obtained with inferior interface contacts, and, therefore, considerable efforts are made to engineer the interfaces at the nanoscale.19,20 Recently, a number of groups have reported that a vertical redistribution of the two phases can take place due to the surface energy differences of the two components (donor and acceptor) according to the surface energy of the substrate.21–34 More specifically, the ingredient with the lower surface energy enriches the top of the blend film, whereas the other component tends to segregate at the substrate interface. This vertical phase separation has driven research into inverted solar cell configuration, which is more viable for roll-to-roll manufacturing since it presents high stability and long device lifetime. Nevertheless, the opposite phenomenon of mixing was observed in P3HT/PCBM bilayers that were thermally annealed.35,36 The comprehensive understanding of the phase separation kinetics in polymer–fullerene blends and the knowledge of how polymer molecules behave at interfaces are critical issues for improving the device performance.
The most commonly used buffer hole transport layer (HTL) for organic solar cells is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS).37,38 However, the influence of PEDOT:PSS surface and electrical properties on the active layer morphology and the device's electrical characteristics are only partially understood and are subjects of further study.39,40
In this work, we study in detail the effect of the HTL properties on the blend morphology of P3HT:PCBM BHJ and its influence on the performance of solar cells. Using a series of four different PEDOT:PSS formulations and following two routes of thermal processing (prior to and after cathode deposition) a direct correlation between the surface free energy of the HTL and the vertical compositional profile in the active layer has been established. It was found that the device characteristics depend on the electrical and surface properties of HTL; the latter can alter the vertical phase segregation within the active layer, promoting the PCBM component at the bottom interface.
2. Experimental
For this work, a highly regioregular P3HT from Rieke Metals (Sepiolid, P200, molecular weight, Mn ≈ 10–30 kDa, polydispersity index, PDI = 1.7–2.2, regioregularity > 95%) and PCBM from Solenne BV were used. A blend solution of P3HT:PCBM (1:0.8 w/w) was prepared with a total concentration of 21.6 mg ml−1 in chloroform. The solution was stirred for at least 24 hours at 55 °C to promote total dissolution and processed without filtering. Prior to the active deposition the HTL spin coating preceded. Four different formulations of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios, Heraeus) were used. PH1000, PVPAI4083 and PVPCH8000 dispersions were used as received while a PH1000 solution was modified by the addition of 6% (% v/v) of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in order to increase its conductivity. These four dispersions were filtered using a 0.45 μm syringe filter (Whatman, PVDF) and spin-coated onto cleaned, pre-patterned ITO/glass substrates (20 ohm sq−1) producing thin films of 55 ± 2 nm of thickness. The PEDOT:PSS/ITO/glass samples were annealed on a hot plate at 140 °C for 10 min to remove any residual H2O left. The P3HT:PCBM blend was spin coated at 700 rpm for 18 s, producing films ∼200 nm thick. The preparation of the PEDOT:PSS and P3HT:PCBM thin films was conducted inside a nitrogen-filled glove box. Consequently, the samples were transferred into an ultra-high vacuum chamber (Pb < 10−8mbar) where a layer of 10 nm of calcium was deposited on top of the active layer, by e-beam evaporation (EBE). The devices were completed by the deposition of an aluminum cathode layer of 100 nm by EBE. An aperture mask of 0.075 cm2 defined the active area. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under nitrogen atmosphere, using a Keithley 2420 source measurement unit. A series of samples was annealed prior to metal cathode deposition (pre-annealed) while a second one was measured without thermal treatment (non-annealed). Devices from the second series were measured again after subjecting those to thermal annealing (post-annealed). The photocurrent was measured under air mass (AM) 1.5G and 100 mW cm−2 of irradiation using a Newport solar simulator (91191). The light intensity was determined using a monocrystalline silicon reference solar cell calibrated with KG5 window (Newport 91150-KG5).
The optical properties and the morphology of the P3HT:PCBM blends were investigated by Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE) from the NIR-Vis-fUV spectral region (0.7–6.5 eV) with a step of 20 meV, at an angle of incidence of 70°. In order to take into account the optical response of the intermediate layers (PEDOT:PSS and ITO), the optical properties and thickness of the ITO/glass and PEDOT:PSS/ITO/glass samples were measured prior to the P3HT:PCBM deposition. In addition, the dielectric function of the pristine P3HT and PCBM materials was determined as described in ref. 32.
The surface energy of the PEDOT:PSS films was acquired by Contact Angle (CA) measurements, which were performed with an optical contact angle and surface tension meter CAM200 from KSV Instruments Ltd by the sessile drop technique. The liquid that has been used was H2O with a drop volume of 5 μl and a surface tension of 72.8 mN m−1 and the contact angles of each sample were recorded within 5 s after placing droplets onto PEDOT:PSS thin films. The average contact angle value was obtained by measuring the contact angles at five different positions on the same sample.
The contact angles were converted into surface energy values employing the relation of E. Chibowski et al.41 Finally, for the investigation of the surface morphology, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed with a SOLVER P47 Scanning Probe Microscope (NT-MDT). Tapping mode was utilized for better image acquisition using rectangular silicon cantilevers with a 10 nm nominal tip curvature. For a better understanding of the HTL's conductivity on the device performance, the standard Van der Pauw DC method has been used. The instrumentation used was a computer-controlled system including two Keithley 2010 7½-digit high-performance digital multimeters and a Keithley 220 current source. The contact points were mechanically bonded by pressure on the conductive film and were confirmed to be ohmic up to 3 mA where no evidence was marked for Joule-effect influence. The constant current applied was lying between 0.5 and 1 mA.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Surface and electrical properties of PEDOT:PSS
The measured surface and electrical characteristics of the various PEDOT:PSS samples are summarized in Table 1. A monotonic increase of the surface free energy from 52.4 mN m−1 (for the DMSO-treated PH1000) to 70.7 mN m−1 (for the PVPCH8000) is observed. This can be attributed to the modification of the surface chemistry that results from the different PEDOT/PSS ratio. Indeed, the PEDOT/PSS ratio changes from 1/2.5 in the PH1000 films to 1/6 in the PVPAI4083, and 1/20 in the PVPCH8000 film. The surface free energy values rise as the hydrophilic PSS content increases. Moreover, concerning the PH1000 solutions, the addition of DMSO solvent modifies the PEDOT/PSS ratio at the surface of the dried film. Seok-In Na et al. reported that the addition of 7% of DMSO decreases the PSS/PEDOT ratio at the surface from 3.746 to 3.345.42 As a result, the addition of DMSO solvent reduces the surface free energy of the film.

Fig. 1a–d shows the surface nano-topography of the four different PEDOT:PSS buffer layers, which were spin coated onto ITO/glass substrates, whereas Fig. 1e shows the ITO surface. Although PEDOT:PSS has completely covered the ITO surface, a cross-section analysis (Fig. 1f) shows that its surface nano-topography is influenced by the ITO roughness profile. Notwithstanding the fact that PEDOT:PSS film smoothens the ITO surface, this planarization is not apparent for the case of the DMSO treated PH1000 film; in fact in that case the surface roughness profile is equivalent to that of the ITO substrate. Further analysis on the AFM images reveals that the organic films present different surface characteristics. The PH1000 films exhibit elongated features forming a continuous stretched network, which is enhanced by the addition of DMSO.43 Moreover, the addition of DMSO causes the surface roughening of the PH1000 film from 2 to 2.4 nm. On the contrary, the PVPAl4083 and PVPCH8000 films exhibit a granular morphology consisting of PEDOT:PSS particles. As a result, these films are characterized by lower surface roughness values. The surface roughness (root mean square, Rq) of the PEDOT:PSS films is progressively decreasing from 2.4 nm to 0.8 nm as the surface free energy increases.

Besides these differences on the surface properties the samples present different electrical properties. In this work, 6% v/v was added to PH1000 dispersion increasing its conductivity from 1.65 to 866 S cm−1. The conductivity enhancement by the addition of a polar solvent is well known.42,44,45 The electrical conductivity values for PVPAI4083 and PVPCH8000 were obtained from ref. 46 and 47 as they were beyond our Van der Pauw sensitivity setup. Overall, the electrical conductivity increases 2 to 3 orders of magnitude between each formulation. This is either due to the reduction of PSS insulating content or due to the addition of the DMSO solvent in PH1000 solution. Concerning the work function parameter, according to the manufacturer, PVPAI4083 and PVPCH8000 have similar values of ∼5.2 eV.47 PH1000 formulation may have lower work function and can slightly decrease by the addition of the DMSO solvent to ∼5 eV.42,48
3.2. Morphology and optical properties of the P3HT:PCBM blends
Spectroscopic Ellipsomerty (SE) in the NIR-Vis-fUV spectral region (0.7–6.5 eV) can provide valuable information on the optical and electronic properties of the BHJ layer, as well as on the contribution of P3HT and PCBM to the dielectric response of the BHJ material. It has to be noted that the P3HT:PCBM system has a complex optical response (especially the P3HT) which is characterized by optical anisotropy. This provides difficulties in the accurate description of their optical properties. However, we have found that the optical response of the studied samples has a small contribution from the P3HT optical anisotropy, originated probably by the small crystallite size of ∼17 nm (obtained by X-ray diffraction measurements). Fig. 2a shows the measured pseudodielectric function 〈ε(ω)〉 = 〈ε1(ω)〉 + i〈ε2(ω)〉 of two representative P3HT:PCBM films that were deposited onto PH1000 + DMSO buffer layers, non-annealed (squares) and annealed for 3 min at 145 °C (circles) before the cathode metal deposition. Although the contribution of the characteristic electronic transitions is clear in the whole measured energy spectrum, there are significant differences between the optical properties of the non-annealed and the annealed samples. The same behavior is observed for all P3HT:PCBM blends that were deposited onto different PEDOT:PSS buffer layers.
 Fig. 2  (a) Measured and (b) calculated dielectric function of the P3HT:PCBM blend of the non-annealed and annealed samples that is grown onto PH1000 + DMSO substrate. 
In order to extract quantitative information from the measured 〈ε(ω)〉 spectra, we have modeled 〈ε(ω)〉 by applying a theoretical model that consists of the layer sequence air/blend film/PEDOT:PSS layer/ITO/glass/air. The dielectric functions and thickness values of ITO and PEDOT:PSS formulations have been calculated prior to the deposition of the blend films. The optical properties of the P3HT:PCBM layer have been modelled by the use of the modified Tauc–Lorentz (TL) oscillator model, described by the following expressions:49–51 (1) (2)In the TL model, the imaginary part is calculated by multiplying the Tauc joint density of states by ε2(ω) obtained from the Lorentz oscillator model.51 Although the expressions of ε1(ω) and ε2(ω) in the TL model are empirical, this model can describe and predict the dielectric response and the optical properties of amorphous films. That is, at large ω values, the ε2(ω) → 0 as 1/ω3 and ε(ω) = 0 below the fundamental optical gap ωg. Finally, ε1(ω) is determined by Kramers–Kronig integration.51,52 The energy ω0 of TL model corresponds to the Penn gap where the strong absorption in a material takes place. The ε∞ parameter included in ε1(ω) expression is a constant term that accounts for the existence of electronic transitions above the measured energy region.52
The calculated bulk dielectric function of the blend films (non-annealed and annealed at 145 °C) which were deposited onto PH1000 + DMSO layer is shown in Fig. 2b. The non-annealed sample exhibits low intensity features in the visible spectral region with an optical absorption maximum at energies 2 eV, 2.2 eV, 2.41 eV, 3.74 eV, 4.59 eV and 5.96 eV. The characteristic transitions of the polymer blend and its origin have been discussed in detail in our previous communication.32
Significant peak-intensity enhancement is observed at the calculated ε(ω) of the blend after the thermal annealing. Also, increased absorption leads to increased amount of carrier generation. Changes in crystallinity of P3HT with the temperature can be examined by monitoring the change in absorbance for the vibronic peak at 2 eV. This peak is assigned to an interchain-delocalized excitation and its intensity has been linked to the degree of P3HT crystallinity.18 From Fig. 2b it is evident that the intensity of this peak is pronounced at the thermally annealed sample leading to the conclusion that P3HT forms a highly ordered structure after the annealing process.
In addition, NIR-Vis-fUV SE has been used to investigate the vertical compositional profile of the P3HT and PCBM phases in the BHJ layer.
For the analysis of the measured spectra we have used a theoretical model that consists of the following layer sequence: voids + P3HT/BHJ layer/PEDOT:PSS/ITO/glass/air. For the determination of the distribution of the P3HT and PCBM phases we have modelled the optical response of the BHJ layer by an exponential gradient layer that consists of 20 slices. Although we have tested several models that include homogeneous, linear and exponential (in single and multilayer configurations), we have found that this model can provide the most accurate description of the vertical composition profile with the lower value of the minimization function (χ2 = 0.035). We have to comment, at this point, that the applicability and reliability of our model are based on the fact that the penetration depth of the light ensures the extraction of information from the BHJ at all thicknesses. Consequently, adequate results from the interfaces of BHJ with the buffer layers were revealed. The used gradient model calculates the volume fraction of the P3HT and PCBM phases of the bottom layer (no. 1) and the top layer (no. 20) employing the Bruggeman Effective Medium Approximation (BEMA).49 Therefore, the %vol(P3HT)i and %vol(PCBM)i (i = top, bottom) can be determined. The dielectric functions of glass substrates, PEDOT:PSS, P3HT and PCBM layers were determined by the measurement and analysis of plain glass substrate and pristine materials, respectively.

Fig. 3 shows the calculated volume fractions of P3HT and PCBM phases as a function of the buffer layer surface energy, before (Fig. 3a) and after the device thermal annealing (Fig. 3b) and prior to the cathode metal deposition. In the case of the non-annealed samples, the P3HT and PCBM phases were homogeneously distributed in the BHJ layers that were deposited on the lower surface energy substrates (PH1000 + DMSO, PH1000). Fig. 3a depicts that the %vol(P3HT) at the top and bottom regions for these samples was ∼55%, whereas the %vol(PCBM) was ∼45%. This indicates a well mixed state, which is promoted by the weight ratio of P3HT/PCBM in blend solution, namely, 1/0.8.
 Fig. 3  Evolution of the calculated volume fraction of P3HT and PCBM in the blend films as a function of the surface energy for the various PEDOT:PSS substrates: (a) the non-annealed samples and (b) the annealed samples. 
On the contrary, the blends that have been deposited onto the buffer layers of the higher surface free energy appear to have non-uniform morphology. Indeed, the P3HT volume fraction increases at the top regions (close to the surface), whereas we observe an increase of the PCBM at the buried interface close to PEDOT:PSS layer, from 46% to 53%.
The thermal annealing process enhances the above behavior. Fig. 3b shows that the thermal annealing leads to the increase of the %vol(P3HT)top and %vol(PCBM)bottom and to the reduction of %vol(P3HT)bottom and %vol(PCBM)top. This demixing process is enhanced when the BHJ layer is deposited onto the higher surface energy buffer layers. As a result, the lowest phase separation occurs in the lower surface energy (most hydrophobic) buffer layers. In these samples we find that %vol(PCBM)bottom = 50.3% and %vol(P3HT)bottom = 49.7%, whereas in the top region we find that %vol(P3HT)top = 60.2% and %vol(PCBM)top = 39.8%.
On the other hand, the largest phase separation takes place at the high surface energy (most hydrophilic) PVPCH8000 substrate, at which %vol(PCBM)bottom = 64.5% and %vol(P3HT)bottom = 35.5%. At the top region we find that %vol(P3HT)top = 74.4% and %vol(PCBM)top = 25.6%. This phenomenon of vertical phase separation, which is well known in polymer blends, has been recently reported in polymer–fullerene thin films by a number of different groups and is still under debate.21–34 In polymer blends, during spin coating deposition, the component with the lower surface tension enriches the surface of the film. Also, the enrichment of the high surface energy component at a high surface energy substrate reduces the free energy of the system.53 The surface energies of the pristine P3HT and PCBM materials are 24 mN m−1 and 38.2 mN m−1, respectively. Consequently, for a typical P3HT:PCBM film on a high surface energy substrate (as PEDOT:PSS) the buried interface is expected to be PCBM-rich while the free surface (exposed to air) is expected to be enriched with the lower surface free energy P3HT. This process is initiated during spin coating and is enhanced during the thermal annealing treatment.
3.3. Surface properties of P3HT:PCBM
The lateral phase separation can be evaluated by the investigation of the surface nano-topography of the samples using the AFM technique. Fig. 4 shows the surface nano-topography images of two representative BHJ samples: the non-annealed BHJ and the sample that has been thermally annealed to 145 °C for 3 min. No significant variations were found on the surface nano-topography among the samples with different HTLs. More specifically, the non-annealed samples revealed a very smooth surface with a surface rms roughness of 0.5 nm and a peak-to-valley distance value of 4.3 nm. The low surface roughness suggests that little or no phase separation exist and that the two phases are in a well-mixed state. Indeed, films cast from a high volatile solvent such as chloroform are quenched in a well mixed state, since the solvent evaporates very quickly and “freezes” the molecular chains in a state far from the thermodynamic equilibrium.
 Fig. 4  AFM topography images of the active layer films. Non-annealed (left) and after annealing at 145 °C for 3 min (right). Scan size is 2.5 μm × 2.5 μm. 
However, the thermal annealing process above the polymer’s glass transition temperature softens the P3HT matrix, and provides the macromolecules the appropriate mobility to crystallize and reach a more thermodynamically favorable state. P3HT forms fibrillar nanocrystals, while PCBM molecules diffuse to form fullerene aggregates or bulky crystals.54,55 In the final state, the P3HT crystals, the PCBM molecules or nanocrystals and the P3HT amorphous phase coexist. As a consequence, the surface rms roughness increases to 2.4 nm with a peak-to-valley profile height of 18.9 nm.
3.4. Photovoltaic properties
Organic solar cells were fabricated and tested using the various PEDOT:PSS buffer layers with different surface properties. After the spin coating deposition of the BHJ blend, a series of samples was annealed for 3 min at 145 °C prior to cathode deposition (“pre-annealed” devices). In a second series, the cathode was deposited onto untreated active layer (“non-annealed” devices). After testing, this series of devices was subjected to thermal annealing and tested again (“post-annealed” devices). In order to ensure the repeatability of results, four sets of samples were tested, while each sample contained two solar cell devices. The analysis was based on characteristic J–V measurements that were obtained both under illumination and in the dark. While illuminated J–V gives an indication of the actual device performance, critical information on the charge separation mechanisms and the performance of each of the layers along with interface properties can be extracted by the J–V obtained in the dark through appropriate analysis. Representative current density–voltage characteristics of all devices under illumination are shown in Fig. 5. The average photovoltaic device parameters for the devices studied are summarized in Table 2.

The effect of the various HTLs on the device performance was elucidated by the appropriate analysis of the current–voltage characteristics measured in the dark. In that sense, the values of series resistance, Rs, and the diode ideality factor (n) were determined from the slope and y-axis intercept of the dV/d(lnJ)–J plot, respectively, by applying the following equation:56 (3)where A is the device area. Fig. 6 shows a graph of dV/(dlnJ) vs. J as obtained from the post-annealed devices with the PH1000 + DMSO and the PVPAI4083 buffer layers along with a linear fit at the linear region of the curves. The shunt resistance (Rsh) was calculated from the inverse slope at Isc using the light J–V characteristics. Our analysis was based on the Rs obtained from the dark J–V, since no alterations on the trend of the values will be affected by the illuminated J–V characteristics. Moreover, we study the effect of the BHJ interfaces with the upper and lower buffer layers on the device performance, whose functionality is not affected during illumination. The values of Rs and Rsh were correlated with the device performance in good operating post-annealed devices where they better illustrate the effect of each PEDOT:PSS formulation.

3.4.1. Non-annealed devices – HTL effect on the phase separation inside BHJ. 
The non-annealed devices exhibit very poor electrical characteristics with low short-circuit current densities (Jsc) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values (see Table 2). The low photo-conversion efficiency of these devices can be attributed to non-efficient charge transport pathways due to incomplete phase separation. Furthermore, geminate recombination may be dominant in such homogeneously mixed blend structures.57
However, the devices made with the low conductive HTLs (PVPAl4083 and PVPCH8000) exhibited better electrical parameters, specifically higher Jsc and open-circuit voltage (Voc) values, in comparison to the devices made with the highly conductive PH1000 buffer layers. According to SE results, phase separation takes place in these samples. The PCBM segregation towards the bottom electrode creates well defined donor–acceptor domains. Indeed, the dark J–V curves obtained from these devices show good diode behavior indicating the formation of a p–n junction in the active layer. On the contrary, the J–V curves that were obtained from the PH1000 buffer layers were below the sensitivity of our SMU unit. Nevertheless, this behavior may originate from potential barrier heights due to the lower work function of the PH1000 buffer layers.


3.4.2. Post-annealed devices – HTL conductivity and surface energy effect on photovoltaic properties. 
On the other hand, all the electrical parameters were significantly improved when the samples were subjected to the post-annealing process. The highest Jsc value of 9.33 mA cm−2 along with the lowest Rs of 60.9 Ω were obtained from the DMSO-treated post-annealed device, resulting in PCE of 3%. The observed improvement on the electrical properties of the post-annealed devices is mainly assigned to increased crystallization of P3HT. This leads to improved charge carrier mobility58 and the phase separation between the P3HT and the PCBM materials, resulting in large interfacial area between the donor–acceptor. This is also supported by the SE results, which show that enhanced optical absorption is also responsible for the improved performance.
Concerning the PEDOT:PSS role, as expected, Rs varies in accordance with the HTL layer conductivity. Rs is affected by the bulk resistances of the active layer, the buffer layers, the electrodes and the contact resistances. The decrease in Rs increases both Jsc and PCE. Similar improvements in Jsc and Rs have been observed by Z. Hu et al.,39 when ethylene glycol solvent was added in PVPAI4083 dispersion which were mainly attributed to the conductivity enhancement of the HTL. However our results reveal that the surface energy of the HTL also plays a significant role by controlling the composition and the recombination losses taking place at the active–HTL interface. The ideality factor shows a monotonic increase from 1.9 to 4.8 as the HTL surface energy decreases. The ideality factor is directly related to the generation–recombination processes justifying the deviation of the ideality factor from unity.59,60 Although there are references associating the ideality factor also with series resistance variation and/or tunneling current these mechanisms are not applicable in our case. As can be easily seen from Table 2, the ideality factor is independent of the series resistance also calculated from the dark J–V characteristics. Furthermore, tunneling current mechanism is totally absent in the devices measured. As a consequence, the only parameter that mainly affects the ideality factor is the generation-recombination current which is enhanced as the shunt resistance decreases. The increase in the ideality factor is attributed to the charge recombination that takes place near the bottom interface and suggests that the higher the surface energy of the substrate, the higher the recombination current. This is evident in the device with PVPCH8000 buffer layer, which presents a characteristic kink in the J–V curve and can be attributed to the interface barriers (holes are blocked from reaching the anode) and the high series resistance of the HTL (∼10−5 S cm−1).19 As a result, the PCE of this device is severely limited to 0.53%.
In all the post-annealed devices, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) remained constant at 0.5778 V, suggesting good ohmic contact between the active layer and the buffer layers. Rsh represents the leakage current, which is further related to the quality of the film. Despite the fact that a higher surface roughness profile is linked to worse Rsh,61 this case does not comply with our samples. In fact, DMSO addition to PH1000 has shown better Rsh values albeit with higher rms in comparison to the PH1000 HTL samples. This is an indication that the surface roughness of PEDOT:PSS is not responsible for the Rsh deterioration, while other parameters such as film quality seem to possess a more important role in the phenomenon associated with leakage current.
Consequently, the above variations in Rs and Rsh influence the Fill Factor (FF), which reflects the transport properties and the extraction barriers as well as the active layer morphology. The FF increases monotonically from 22.10 to 55.95% simultaneously with HTL's decrease in surface free energy and increase in conductivity. At the same time the PCE increases from 0.53 to 3.01% as a result of the FF and Jsc increase. Recently, Kim et al.40 reported that the FF is not influenced by the bulk property (e.g. electric conductivity) of the buffer layer, but by the interfacial properties between the buffer and the active layer. Thus, the higher FF in the device with the DMSO-treated PH1000 buffer layer indicates improved balance of electron and hole transport within the device.


3.4.3. Pre-annealed devices – interfacial segregation phenomena on device response. 
The pre-annealed devices exhibit inferior electrical characteristics with lower Voc and Jsc values and very high Rs and n values. The deterioration of PCE at these solar cells can be primarily attributed to the segregation of P3HT at the BHJ–cathode interface. The P3HT surface enrichment can create an electron injection barrier while at the same time PCBM enrichment at the buried interface can create an injection barrier for holes. This is supported by the high ideality factor values that reveal the high recombination taking place at the interfaces. Furthermore, the difference in the ideality factor between the pre-annealed and the post-annealed devices reveals the recombination losses taking place across the active–cathode interface in the pre-annealed devices. Nevertheless, devices made of PH1000 films exhibit better performance. Specifically, the devices with the DMSO-treated HTL exhibit significant higher Jsc and Voc in comparison with the rest of the HTLs independently of the existence of possible potential energy barriers. It is clear that these devices have superior interface composition with less PCBM at the buried interface, in comparison with the rest of the devices. The reduction in Voc in this series of solar cells implies bad ohmic contact between the active layer and the electrodes. Orimo et al.,29 using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, reported reduced Voc values in pre-annealed devices which were related to P3HT surface enrichment. Also, PCBM was found to segregate at the aluminum interface in the post-annealed devices. PCBM with a relatively high surface energy is likely to segregate to the Al electrode because metal has a surface energy generally much higher than organic materials. Indeed, in the present study, the high Jsc and Voc values and the low n value in the post-annealed devices reveal that the composition of the interfaces is favorable for efficient charge extraction. We expect that the active–Ca interface has adequate amount of PCBM for electron extraction and the PEDOT:PSS–active interface has enough P3HT for hole extraction. However, more detailed studies are required to elucidate the exact interfacial composition and its impact on the device response.
In the scientific literature there are studies that highlight the significant effect of vertical phase separation,26 while others report only minor effects on the device performance.62 The effect of the vertical phase separation on the device response depends on the continuity and the thickness of the blocking layers which are formed at the interfaces.63 These are strongly dependent on the sample's preparation conditions which are greatly determined by the choice of the casting solvent. In this study there is a remarkable difference between the pre- and the post-annealed devices which is not in accordance with the literature where similar studies were conducted with active layers cast from high boiling point solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) or 1,2-dichlorobenzene (odCB).6,10,64 In these studies, the difference in PCE between pre- and post-annealed devices is small and the films show a clear thermal stability with the maximum PCE obtained at long annealing times (30 min).6 On the contrary, in this work, films cast from chloroform (CF) present a different behavior. As shown in Fig. 7, the highest PCE for both pre- and post-annealed devices is obtained in only 1 min of annealing and drops at longer annealing times. The difference between films cast from CF and CB/odCB is due to the different evaporation rate of these solvents. Films cast from CB/odCB have the time to crystallize during spin coating deposition and create a 3D scaffold that is difficult to be deformed, while films cast from CF as explained above are unstable and much more prone to thermal treatment. This is confirmed by the fact that once the CF films are annealed and crystallized, they remain constant under further annealing.

4. Conclusions
We have investigated the effect of the HTL physical properties and thermal annealing on the morphology and the interfacial segregation inside P3HT:PCBM devices. A clear correlation between the surface free energy of the HTL substrate and the vertical composition profile within the active layer was established. The P3HT surface enrichment and PCBM segregation at the bottom interface were promoted when the BHJ was deposited onto more hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS substrates. This phase separation, which may enhance photovoltaic performance initially during casting, introduces however significant recombination losses after annealing. According to the device extracted results, the P3HT surface enrichment can be suppressed if the thermal annealing treatment is applied after the cathode deposition. Furthermore, decreasing the surface free energy of the HTL is an effective way to avoid the PCBM segregation at the active–HTL interface. The latter result, in combination with the reduction of the HTL series resistance, results in significant improvements in Jsc, FF, n and PCE. All the above-mentioned findings highlight the role of the HTL and reveal that the synthesis of new, more hydrophobic and highly conductive PEDOT:PSS-based HTL, in regular architecture devices, can tailor the vertical phase segregation in the active layer and provide an efficient approach to achieve solar cell performance improvements.
