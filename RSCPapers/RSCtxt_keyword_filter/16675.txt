    , Accepted 10th September 2012First published on 11th September 2012AbstractTwo novel D–π–A–π–D structured small molecules composed of benzothiadiazole and triphenylamine were designed and synthesized. BDCTBT with cyano on the π-bridge exhibited a deep HOMO energy level, resulting in an impressive VOC of up to 1.04 V with a PCE of 3.85%, while non-cyano substituted BDETBT yielded a VOC of 0.94 V and a PCE of 1.99%.
Organic solar cells, as a promising alternative to traditional inorganic photovoltaic devices, have attracted extensive investigation in the last two decades, due to their low-cost, light-weight and flexible characteristics.1 Solution processed bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ OSCs) possess potential for commercialization because of their high internal quantum efficiency and large-scale printing technique.2 Although polymers have been widely applied to BHJ OSCs3 and achieved impressive progress of power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 8%,4 the interest in solution-processable small molecular π-conjugated organic donors has been accelerating for BHJ photovoltaic applications in recent years, owing to the advantages of definite structure, facile purification, high purity and good photovoltaic performance reproduction.5 Despite Heeger and Bazan et al. reported a competitive PCE of around 7% for small molecular OSCs,6 in general, the application efficiencies obtained from these small molecules are relatively lower than the PCEs of polymeric counterparts. Thus, in order to introduce small molecular semiconductors into commercial solar cells, their efficiencies need to be improved.
To meet this need, two straightforward strategies have been considered: (1) reducing the band-gap of molecular donors to broaden the absorption range, which results in higher short-circuit current density (JSC) of devices, and (2) lowering the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) of molecular donors so as to increase the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of applications.7 Obviously, developing new D–A organic small molecules is an efficient way to maximize the photovoltaic parameters, because this structure can not only narrow the band-gap by utilizing intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition between electron donating and withdrawing units inside molecules, but also control the energy levels through employing different donor or acceptor moieties into the molecules. So far, with the increased interest in exploring low band-gap small molecules to absorb sunlight at longer wavelengths, small molecular BHJ solar cells have reached considerable JSC of up to 14 mA cm−2.6,8 On the other hand, the BHJ devices with a high VOC of over 1 V have scarcely been realized using a p-type small molecule as a donor,9 on account of the barrier of narrowing the band-gap of small molecules without sacrificing lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) for effective charge separation as well as large VOC values depending on the low-lying HOMO. Therefore, careful modification of energy levels by functional group selection is of utmost importance in improvement of device properties, especially achieving reduced HOMO without enhancing molecular band-gap. Among conjugated polymer donors, fluorine-containing polymers exhibit lower HOMO and LUMO levels as a result of the high electron affinity of fluorine atoms, suggesting that the addition of electron-acceptor groups is effective in further stabilizing energy levels.10 Moreover, cyano is a good electron-withdrawing group which has been extensively used in organic dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells.11 Noticeably, lower energy levels were observed for dyes containing one more cyano group on their π-bridge.12 In addition, some conjugated polymers substituted with cyano-groups at their vinylic linkage have been reported as photovoltaic materials.13 Consequently, we envisioned that incorporating a cyano unit into the D–A conjugated small molecules could decrease the HOMO value to obtain high VOC for photovoltaic application.
In this communication, we reported the syntheses, theoretical calculation, photophysical and electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performances of two novel D–π–A–π–D type low band-gap benzothiadiazole–triphenylamine based small molecular donor materials, BDCTBT and BDETBT, one of which contained cyano groups anchoring on the π-bridge (see Fig. 1(a) for structure). Benzothiadiazole was selected as the central acceptor since it has been well-known as an excellent acceptor utilized in low band-gap polymers for OSCs.2b,10d,14 Motivation for choosing triphenylamines as capped donors was attributed to their good electron-donating characters and good charge transportation properties.15 Significantly, linear or star-shaped small molecules composed of benzothiadiazole and triphenylamine have shown a high VOC of over 0.9 V for BHJ OSCs.16 It is rational to add cyano groups in D–A–D type benzothiadiazole–triphenylamine molecules to get deep-lying HOMO and high VOC. The design of BDETBT was for the purpose of exploring the effect of cyano on photovoltaic properties of molecules. In addition, Fig. 1(b) presents the density functional theory (DFT) calculated geometry and electronic properties of two molecules (calculation method given in ESI†). In both molecules, the electron density of the HOMO delocalized over the whole molecules, while that of the LUMO concentrated on the central benzothiadiazole groups, demonstrating that an electron transfers from the triphenylamine groups to the central acceptors during the process of being excited from HOMO to LUMO. From the calculated energy levels, the HOMO and LUMO values of BDCTBT were found to be lower than those of BDETBT by 0.24 eV and 0.18 eV, respectively. These results explain that, in theoretical calculation, cyano groups can lower the HOMO level without significantly costing narrow band-gap.

A synthetic route for the small molecules is shown in Scheme 1. The benzothiadiazole-based acceptor moiety (compound A) was synthesized in six steps starting from commercially available catechol following the procedures reported in the literature.17 Knoevenagel condensation reaction of 4-(diphenylamino)benzaldehyde and 4-bromobenzyl acetonitrile was carried out using NaOH as a base in EtOH resulting in compound 1 with a yield of 89%. Compound 2 was obtained in a yield of 47% by Pd(OAc)2 catalyzed Heck coupling reaction between N,N-diphenyl-4-iodoaniline and 4-bromostyrene. The donor units (compounds D1 and D2) were both synthesized by Miyaura borylation in high yields. Finally, BDCTBT and BDETBT were prepared by Pd(PPh3)4-assisted Suzuki coupling reaction in high yields of 87% and 88%, respectively. Detailed synthetic procedures and characterization are given in ESI.†

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the synthesized molecules in chloroform and in films are shown in Fig. 2(a) and the corresponding optical data are collected in Table 1. Both molecules exhibited a broad absorption range covering the 300–600 nm wavelength in solution and in film. In solution, the maximum absorption peak (λmaxsol) of BDCTBT was 484 nm, which was blue-shifted compared with that of BDETBT (496 nm), because the cyano groups hindered the ICT transition for their electron-withdrawing effect. In comparison with their absorption spectra in solution, the absorption bands of BDCTBT and BDETBT in films were red-shifted, extending the absorption onset to 604 nm and 619 nm, respectively, and thus showing a strong intermolecular π–π interaction in the solid state.

In order to investigate the electrochemical energy levels (HOMOCV, LUMOCV and EgCV) of the two compounds, the cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to drop-cast films (Fig. S1, ESI†) and related electrochemical data are summarized in Table 1. Encouragingly, BDCTBT and BDETBT presented fairly low-lying HOMOCV levels of −5.32 eV and −5.25 eV, respectively, which guaranteed high VOC of the organic photovoltaic devices blending small molecules with PC61BM. As speculated above, comparing energy levels between two materials, cyanos successfully deepened the HOMO level without greatly reducing the band-gap.
To investigate the charge separation process between small molecules and PC61BM, the fluorescence quenching experiments were performed and the fluorescence emission spectra are shown in Fig. 2(b). When the concentration of PC61BM increased, fluorescence intensity of small molecules gradually decreased, indicating an efficient photoinduced charge separation process of the synthesized donor materials with acceptor PC61BM.18 Furthermore, at low concentration of the quencher, the relationship between the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of PC61BM was related to Stern–Volmer equation: F0/F = 1 + KSV[C], in which F0 and F represent the fluorescence intensity in the absence and the presence of PC61BM, respectively, KSV is the quenching constant, and [C] is the concentration of PC61BM. The KSV of BDCTBT and BDETBT were 3320 M−1 and 3260 M−1, respectively.
Photovoltaic performances of two synthesized molecules were preliminarily investigated by fabricating solution-processable BHJ devices in a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC61BM (1:2, w/w)/Al (Fig. 3). The detailed device fabrication process is described in the ESI† and the corresponding parameters of photovoltaic devices are listed in Table 1. The device with blended BDCTBT and PC61BM as an active layer provided a VOC of 1.04 V, a JSC of 11.2 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.33, resulting in a PCE of 3.85%. In contrast, the device based on BDETBT with the same fabrication process delivered inferior photovoltaic properties with a VOC of 0.94 V, a JSC of 6.33 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.33, yielding a PCE of 1.99%. The higher VOC value of BDCTBT was consistent with its deeper low-lying HOMO level caused by the cyano groups on the π-bridge.

In summary, we have explored that the utilization of cyano groups on the π-bridge can be a promising way to reduce HOMO values for conjugated D–A type small molecular photovoltaic materials. A BDCTBT-based BHJ device shows a preliminary PCE of 3.85% with a high VOC of up to 1.04 V. We envisage that further optimization of morphology on an active layer and modification of an electrode will greatly improve the performance of devices.
