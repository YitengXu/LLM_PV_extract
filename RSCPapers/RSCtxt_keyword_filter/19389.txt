    , Accepted 5th May 2019First published on 7th May 2019AbstractSpiro-OMeTAD as a hole-transport material (HTM) plays a crucial role in the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the inferior conductivity and mediocre hole-mobility of unoxidized spiro-OMeTAD limit its function. In order to improve the functional properties of HTMs, we develop a new kind of dopant, vanadic oxide (V2O5) in place of the traditional oxygen in the presence of a lithium salt. V2O5 with strong redox potential can rapidly oxidize spiro-OMeTAD, which effectively improves the hole-transport properties and adjusts the energy level of the HTM. Consequently, the champion PSC based on the V2O5-doped HTM achieves a power conversion efficiency of 20.5%, while the device without V2O5 doping exhibits an efficiency of 18.1% under the same test conditions. Meanwhile, owing to the reduction of trap state density and the band gap adjustment by V2O5 doping the hysteresis of devices is effectively suppressed and the stability is improved. The facile and inexpensive treatment and obvious performance improvement render the present finding very promising.
1. Introduction
Lead amine halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as a new generation of photovoltaic devices have attracted extensive research and development owing to their excellent characteristics such as minor environmental impact, low cost, easy preparation procedure, and high conversion efficiency.1–9 PSCs have shown an unparalleled rise in power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.8% nine years ago10 to 23.7% at present,11 which results from the outstanding features of perovskite such as excellent carrier transport properties,12,13 high absorption coefficient14 and facile solution processability.15 The hole transport layer (HTM), which is in contact with the perovskite layer to extract charge carriers (holes),16 plays a crucial role in the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs. Various hole transport materials17–21 have been used successfully to enhance device performance. Among these, spiro-OMeTAD is still the most popular HTL material for highly efficient PSCs. Unfortunately, the conductivity of pristine spiro-OMeTAD is poor, which is normally oxidized by the oxygen (O2) in air.22–25 However, the slow process needs to be exposed to air for a long time, which may cause serious degradation within the device.26,27 Therefore, the improvement of the HTL is one of the main challenges in the field of PSC technology.
Actually, several groups have found some dopants to enhance the properties of spiro-OMeTAD. Koh et al. reported a new CoIII p-dopant to promote the spiro-to-spiro+ conversion efficiency. And other cobalt-complexes, such as FK102 and FK209 for the oxidization of spiro-OMeTAD, have been presented.28,29 However, these cobalt-complexes are limited by cost and purification processes and not widely used. On the other hand, a low-cost acid-catalyzed oxidation reaction between spiro-OMeTAD and O2 was first reported by Li and co-workers.30 Despite the enhancement of stability, the improvement in performance of the device is still not obvious. Recently, Gu et al. confirmed the effectiveness of FeCl3 as a p-type dopant for the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD in PSCs, but this process cannot avoid the formation of destructive products.31 Thus, there is an urgent need to develop an efficient and harmless dopant for the oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD.
In this paper, we develop a new dopant vanadic oxide (V2O5) for spiro-OMeTAD, which enhances the photovoltaic performance and depresses the hysteresis of PSCs with the aid of the Li-TFSI dopant. V2O5 can rapidly oxidize spiro-OMeTAD within a few minutes in the absence of O2. Moreover, the V2O5 doping of spiro-OMeTAD reduces the energy level of the HTL, which is beneficial to the energy level match between the HTL and perovskite layer and the extraction of carriers from the perovskite layer. Consequently, PSCs based on the V2O5 dopant achieved a champion PCE of 20.5%, while the device without V2O5 doping exhibited an efficiency of 18.1% under the same test conditions. Meanwhile, owing to the rapid oxidation by V2O5 and the band gap adjustment, the hysteresis of devices is effectively suppressed and the stability is improved.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Materials
Unless stated otherwise, all chemicals and reagents used were purchased from the chemical company. The conductive FTO glass was purchased from Wuhan Geo Science and Education Instrument Co., Ltd. Vanadic oxide (V2O5) was purchased from Shanghai Energy Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Spiro-OMeTAD was bought from Luminescence Technology Crop, Taiwan, China, and others from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Crop, China or Alfa Aesar Crop.
2.2. Preparation of electron transport layers
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates were etched and washed with deionized water, anhydrous ethanol, acetone, isopropanol and absolute ethanol in an ultrasonic cleaning machine for 20 min, respectively. The substrates were cleaned with UV ozone treatment for 20 min, and then treated with a plasma cleaner.
The compact TiO2 layer was spin-coated onto the FTO substrate with a two-step program (700 rpm for 5 s with an acceleration of 1000 rpm s−1, sequentially with 4000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm s−1), followed by sintering in a muffle furnace at 500 °C for 30 min. The preparation procedure of TiO2 by a facile solvothermal reaction was reported in previous literature.32
2.3. Preparation of the perovskite layer
1.0 M FAI (purity ≥ 99.5%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Crop.), 1.1 M PbI2 (99.99%, TCI), 0.2 M MABr (≥99.5%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Crop.) and 0.22 M PbBr2 (≥99.5%, Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Crop.) were mixed in DMF (99.8%, Sigma Aldrich) and DMSO (99.9%, Sigma Aldrich) solvents with a DMF/DMSO volume ratio of 4:1. Then 1.5 M CsI (99.99%, TCI) DMSO solution was added into the above solution with a volume ratio of 5:95. A perovskite precursor solution thus was obtained after stirring at room temperature for 5 h in a dry atmosphere. The perovskite precursor solution was spin-coated onto the TiO2 electron transport layer by a consecutive two-step process (with a speed of 1000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm s−1 and 6500 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 3000 rpm s−1, respectively). During the second step, 130 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the center of the spinning substrate within 15 s. Afterwards, the substrate was immediately placed on a hotplate at 100 °C for 50 min and then cooled down to room temperature naturally.
2.4. Preparation of V2O5 doped hole transport layers
144.6 mg of spiro-OMeTAD was dissolved in 2 mL chlorobenzene followed by adding 57.6 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP) and 35 μL of lithium bis(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg LI-TSFI in 1 mL acetonitrile) into the spiro-OMeTAD solution. V2O5 with 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mol% (vs. spiro-OMeTAD) was added to the spiro-OMeTAD solution, respectively. In addition, for comparison, a Co-complex solution (FK209) was added to the spiro-OMeTAD solution without V2O5 doping. The mixed solution was stirred at room temperature for 3 h and spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 800 rpm for 5 s and then at 4000 rpm for 20 s to form the hole transport layer (HTL). At last, a gold electrode with a thickness of 80 nm was evaporated on the HTL with a vacuum evaporation apparatus. The whole fabrication processes of devices were conducted in a glove box.
2.5. Characterization
Ultraviolet-visible (UV/vis) absorption spectra of the samples were recorded with a PerkinElmer Lambda 950UV/VIS/NIR spectrometer, and BaSO4 powder was used as the standard reference. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed with a Thermo Fisher Scientific instrument. Surface morphologies of the perovskite films were observed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope S48000 FESEM (HITACHI, Japan). A Thermo scientific lumina fluorescence spectrometer instrument (LF-1303003) was used to perform steady-state photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL). Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra was acquired by using an OmniFluo-TRPL510HQ from ZOLIX INSTRUMENTS CO. LTD. The J–V curves of the devices were obtained through a Keithley 2420 source-measure unit in an ambient environment, under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) provided by an Oriel Sol 3A solar simulator.
3. Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. 1a, the color of the pristine spiro-OMeTAD solution is light yellow, which changes to deep-red when V2O5 is added. We observed that the solution doped with V2O5 is kept steady even in air. Fig. 1b shows the cross-view SEM image of the main components of the PSC device, and it can be seen that the device has an architecture of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD (doped with V2O5)/Au.

The UV-vis absorption spectra of the spiro-OMeTAD solution with different dopants were measured and are shown in Fig. 2a. All groups show the largest absorption peaks at around 400 nm, which are associated with the absorption of spiro-OMeTAD. Obviously, the broad absorption band around 500 nm reflects the transition from the HOMO to the LUMO of the oxidized spiro-OMeTAD. The absorption band of the spiro-OMeTAD oxidized by V2O5 is stronger than that by O2, indicating a more efficient oxidation reaction by V2O5 than by O2. Likewise, the color of the solution (Fig. 1a) can also become evidence for spiro-OMeTAD oxidation. The above results indicate that there is an oxidation reaction between V2O5 and spiro-OMeTAD.

Compared to the slow oxidation process between spiro-OMeTAD and O2 for more than 8 h, V2O5 can oxidize spiro-OMeTAD within a few minutes due to a higher oxidation tendency. We speculate that V2O5 may directly react with spiro-OMeTAD, and the reaction scheme is shown as below:Spiro-OMeTAD + VV → spiro-OMeTAD+ + VIV
Without slow intermediate reaction by O2, the time of oxidation via V2O5 is significantly shortened due to strong oxidative properties.
The ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS) of the spiro-OMeTAD film doped with V2O5 are shown in Fig. 2b and c. Based on the figures, the HOMO level of spiro-OMeTAD doped with V2O5 is calculated as −5.19 eV, which is lower than that of pristine spiro-OMeTAD (−5.0 eV).33Fig. 2d shows the schematic energy levels of the main components of the device. The HOMO energy level of spiro-OMeTAD doped with V2O5 is lower (0.19 eV) than that of pure spiro-OMeTAD, which is beneficial to the energy level match between the HTL and perovskite layer and the extraction of carriers from the perovskite layer.

Fig. 3a shows the current–voltage (J–V) curves of the PSCs based on spiro-OMeTAD with different dopants, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1. It is clear that the devices with dopants show better performance, especially increased open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). The device without dopants shows a PCE of less than 11%, while the PCEs of the devices with dopants are above 18%. The cells based on V2O5 displayed the best parameters, with a JSC of 22.82 mA cm−2, VOC of 1.17 V, FF of 0.77, and PCE of 20.56%. Thus, the general performance improvement of devices can be obtained through V2O5 doping.

As is well known, the VOC and FF values depend largely on the series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) values of the devices.32,34,35 Series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rsh) values were estimated using a Keithley 2401 system and the results are listed in Table 1. It can be seen that with the increase of Rsh values and the decrease of Rs values, the VOC and FF values of the devices increase. Among them, the smallest Rs value for the device with V2O5 doping stems from both the smaller contact resistance and the bulk resistance, which is expected to generate a high photocurrent. Rsh is closely related to the charge recombination at interfaces inside the solar cell. The largest Rsh value for the device with V2O5 doping indicates that current leakages are minimized.36 Higher Rsh and lower Rs values enable a larger FF and a high electron mobility.34
We investigate the influence of doping concentrations on the photovoltaic performance of the devices, and the corresponding J–V curves and performance parameters of the devices are compared in Fig. 3b and Table 2. With the doping concentration increasing, VOC and FF firstly increase, and after the concentration of V2O5 reaches 2.0 mol%, the VOC and FF decrease with further increase of doping concentration. At the optimal V2O5 concentration of 2.0 mol%, the device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.56%. We also measured the Rsh and Rs values of the corresponding devices (listed in Table 2). The variation trend of Rsh and Rs is consistent with that of photovoltaic parameters. When the concentration of V2O5 reaches 4.0 mol%, the PCE of the device falls to around 16%, which may be caused by the excessive oxidation of spiro-OMeTAD by V2O5.

The incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) plots of the devices (Fig. 3c) are obtained. We can observe that the devices based on V2O5 show much higher IPCE than pristine devices in the spectrum range from 300 to 800 nm. Moreover, after V2O5 doping, the IPCE spectra are broadened almost from 700 to 740 nm, meaning that spiro-OMeTAD doped with V2O5 improves light absorption in this range. Therefore, V2O5 is beneficial for the light harvesting of the devices. We calculate the JSC from the integral of the IPCE spectra, corresponding to the experimental values (Table 1). Fig. 3d presents stable power density as a function of time at the maximum power point. The device with V2O5 achieves a power output of over 21 mW cm−2, which is higher than that of the device without V2O5.
The PCE histograms of 52 PSCs with and without V2O5 doping are shown in Fig. 4a. The devices without dopants exhibit an average PCE of 16.88%, which is lower than that of the device with V2O5 doping (19.42%).

(c) PCE tracking chart of the PSCs with different dopants under dark without any encapsulation in air. (d) PCE tracking chart of the PSCs with different dopants under continuous one-sun illumination in air. 
The J–V curves of the PSCs with and without V2O5 were tested in different scanning directions. According to Fig. 4b and Table 3, it can be seen that the devices based on V2O5 show insignificant hysteresis compared with the obvious hysteresis for the devices without V2O5 doping. The decrease in hysteresis is mainly due to the fact that V2O5 doping can reduce the trap state density of the perovskite layer.37–39Fig. 4c displays the PCE trends of the unencapsulated devices with different dopants under a humidity about 50% at room temperature in the dark. The PCE values of the pristine device have a significant decline after 30 days. The PCE value of the device with V2O5 still holds around 90%, while the device doped with FK209 keeps 81% after 30 days. Moreover, Fig. 4d shows that the device based on V2O5 has only a 17% efficiency drop after continuous one-sun illumination for 500 h, and the efficiency of the device based on KF209 reduced to 50% compared with the initial value. The PCE for the pristine one is reduced to 0% due to complete degradation after irradiation for 200 h. Thus, V2O5 not only can improve device efficiency, but also remarkably suppress J–V hysteresis and make PSCs much more stable.40

Fig. 5a shows the steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the PSCs based on spiro-OMeTAD with different dopants. All samples show a PL peak at about 762 nm, reflecting radiative recombination between electrons and holes. When connecting spiro-OMeTAD to the perovskite, the PL peak intensity of the perovskite visibly declines since the holes are extracted from the perovskite into the spiro-OMeTAD, and more efficient quenching of the photogenerated charges can lead to fast interface charge separation.41–44 The spiro-MeOTAD doped with V2O5 shows a lower PL peak compared to that doped with Li-TFSI, suggesting that more holes are extracted into the spiro-OMeTAD and smaller PL quenching. We compare the hole extraction capacity by measuring the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra (Fig. 5b). In the biexponential PL decay process, the short-lived lifetime (τ1) and the long-lived lifetime (τ2) are associated with non-radiative recombination and overall properties respectively.45 The PL decay lifetimes for the devices with spiro-OMeTAD are significantly shorter than those of the pristine perovskite film (τ1 = 22.0 ns and τ2 = 219.0 ns). The spiro-OMeTAD + V2O5/perovskite shows short-lived and long-lived lifetimes of τ1 = 8.6 ns and τ2 = 41.0 ns, which are shorter than those of spiro-OMeTAD + O2/perovskite films (τ1 = 19.6 ns and τ2 = 70.5 ns). It can be concluded that the HTL based on the V2O5 dopant exhibits faster and more efficient hole extraction in PSCs.

We measured the hole mobility of spiro-MeOTAD via the space charge limited current (SCLC). Fig. 5c presents the current–voltage (J–V) plot of the hole only device (FTO/PEDOT:PSS/HTL/Au). The hole mobility can be calculated from the equation: , where ε0 and εr are the relative dielectric constant and vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1) respectively, μ stands for the hole mobility, V is the applied voltage and L is the film thickness.46 The spiro-MeOTAD with V2O5 shows a hole mobility of 7.3 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, compared with the pristine spiro-MeOTAD with a hole mobility of 3.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. It is suggested that the hole mobility is improved after adding V2O5, which is further evidence of the improvement of FF and JSC.47
In order to study the interface resistance (Rct) and recombination resistance (Rrec) of the devices, the electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the devices with and without V2O5 doping were recorded in the dark. As shown in Fig. 5d, it is clear that there are two semicircles between the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 mHz, where the one in the high frequency region reveals the interfacial charge transfer and the other in the low frequency region stands for the recombination process.48 The spiro-MeOTAD with V2O5 shows a lower Rct and Rrec, in accordance with the result of improvement of VOC and FF.49 Therefore, the above results may reveal that V2O5 can improve both hole separation and charge transportation.

J–V curves of the devices with the architecture of FTO/PEDOT/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au were recorded under dark conditions to calculate the trap state density (nt) in the perovskite film. As shown in Fig. 5e and f, it can be seen that the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) for the device with V2O5 is 0.542 V, lower than that for the pristine one (0.703 V). The nt can be calculated from the equation: ,50 where ε is the relative dielectric constant, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity (8.85 × 10−14 F cm−1), e is the electric charge (1.602 × 10−19 C), and L stands for the thickness of the perovskite film. The nt of the device with V2O5 is 1.06 × 1016 cm−3, smaller than that without V2O5 (1.37 × 1016 cm−3). The decrease in trap state density may be due to the diffusion of V2O5 in the HTM layer to the perovskite layer to passivate the perovskite. In order to confirm this speculation, we compared the VTFL values of the electron-only geometry (FTO/compact-TiO2/perovskite/PCBM/Au) based on the perovskite layers without and with V2O5 modification. It can be seen that the sample with treatment showed a lower VTFL value than the reference one, which means that V2O5 can also diffuse into the perovskite film and passivate defects. The decrease of trap density is further confirmed by the hysteresis phenomenon, which is indicative of the strong correlation between trap density and hysteresis.51

Fig. 5i shows the J–V curves of devices with and without V2O5 doping swept from 2.0 to −2.0 V in the dark. Obviously, the rectification factor for the device based on V2O5 is higher, suggesting that the leakage current is much lower than that of the pristine one. In order to further explore the charge recombination mechanisms of devices, we investigate the relationships between photovoltage VOC and light intensity (I), and the corresponding curves are displayed in Fig. 5j. We can calculate the slope of VOCversus the illumination intensity based on the relation:52,53, where n is an ideal factor associated with monomolecular recombination, k stands for the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. Compared with the pristine device (1.75 kT q−1), the doped device shows a lower slope of 1.61 kT q−1, which suggests that the trap-assisted recombination under open-circuit conditions is greatly reduced.54 This result is well consistent with the trap state density.
4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we develop a new kind of dopant, V2O5 for replacing traditional O2 in the presence of a lithium salt. Owing to its strong oxidability, V2O5 can rapidly oxidize spiro-OMeTAD, which effectively improves the hole-transport properties and adjusts the energy level of the HTM. The photoelectric properties and energy levels of the samples were characterized and the photovoltaic performances of the devices were measured. After the concentration of V2O5 is optimized as 2.0 mol% (vs. spiro-OMeTAD), the champion perovskite photovoltaic device with V2O5 doping achieves an impressive PCE of 20.5%, while the device without V2O5 doping exhibits an efficiency of 18.1% under the same environmental conditions. Meanwhile, the V2O5-doped device shows mitigated hysteresis and improved stability, retaining 90% of the initial efficiency even after exposure to ambient air with a humidity of about 40% for 30 days. The present finding provides a facile and low-cost method for improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of PSCs.
