    , Accepted 18th October 2014First published on 20th October 2014AbstractA new D–A structured conjugated polymer (PBDO-T-TDP) based on electron-rich benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] difuran (BDO) containing conjugated alkylthiophene side chains with an electron-deficient diketo-pyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivative is designed and synthesized. The polymer shows a narrow band gap with broad UV-Visible absorption spectra, which is in contrast to that of the P3HT:PCBM binary blend. Furthermore, its energy levels can meet the energetic requirement of the cascaded energy levels of P3HT and PCBM. Therefore, PBDO-T-TDP is used as a sensitizer in P3HT:PCBM based BHJ solar cells and its effect on their photovoltaic properties was investigated by blending them together at various weight ratios. It is observed that the resulting ternary blend system exhibited a significant improvement in the device performance (∼3.10%) as compared with their binary ones (∼2.15%). Such an enhancement in the ternary blend system is ascribed to their balanced hole and electron mobility along with uniform distribution of PBDO-T-TDP in the blend system, as revealed by organic field effect transistors and AFM studies.
Introduction
In recent years, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted considerable attention as a potential source of renewable energy over traditional materials due to their light weight, low production cost and compatibility with flexible substrates.1–3 OPV research has progressed remarkably both in terms of the device performance and the overall understanding of the governing physical processes.4 However, the commercialization of OPV cells is limited mainly due to their low power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) than those of the traditional silicon based solar cells.5–7 As a result, tremendous efforts have been made towards improving the PCEs of polymer solar cells.
To date, OPVs based on regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as a donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as an acceptor material have been extensively studied and showed a significant improvement in the PCEs of up to ∼4%.8,9 Moreover, P3HT:PCBM is a well understood blend system having good processibility with an optimized lifetime.10,11 The efficiency of the P3HT based solar cell is low due to its limited absorption in the visible region and transmission of infrared light through the polymer, resulting in absorption loss.12,13 Despite the significant improvement in understanding and optimizing the P3HT:PCBM morphology and performance of these blends, remarkable efforts have been made to search for an alternative donor polymer having extended absorption towards the near infrared region.14 To overcome the absorption limitation of P3HT, a low band gap material that absorbs wide portions of the solar spectrum, in particular photon absorption in the near-IR region, is required. It has been proven that synthesis of conjugated polymers having alternate electron donor and acceptor segments is a powerful strategy in designing low band gap polymers.15–19 Nevertheless, most of the reported narrow band gap polymers do not harvest a wide range of solar photons due to their limited absorption bandwidth.
Another alternative route to harvest a complete solar spectrum is the concept of tandem solar cells, wherein the materials with different band gaps and absorption can be coupled.20 The main drawback of tandem solar cells is their fabrication which involves complicated multi-layer stacking with serious technical challenges in contrast to the attractive simplicity of the single-step solution processing of the active layer in BHJ solar cells.21,22 Therefore, to improve the efficiency of the BHJ solar cells, several strategies are currently in the exploration phase at various levels of maturity.23–25
As discussed earlier, P3HT, with a band gap of ∼1.9 eV, is the commonly used p-type material which only absorbs approximately 25% of the incident light and thus is limited to a current density of ∼12 mA cm−2.26 Thus, seeking various techniques to improve the efficiency of the P3HT:PCBM system is of great importance in BHJ solar cells. Recently, the novel concept of ternary blend solar cells has received much attention and recognized as a potential route to increase the absorption width of the solar cells and consequently short circuit current density (Jsc), which resulted in improved device performance.27–30 In the ternary blend system, two donor materials having different absorption spectra are mixed with the acceptor component (or one donor and two acceptors) in a common solvent. Here, the main advantage of the ternary blend system is their simple sandwich structure and easy fabrication process.31
In this context, to overcome the inherent performance limitations of P3HT, a low band gap polymer was introduced as an additive into the P3HT:PCBM blend system. In the present study, a new narrow band gap polymer PBDO-T-TDP containing 4,8-bis(5-ethylhexyl-2-thienyl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′] difuran (BDO) and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) units is synthesized and used as a sensitizer in the binary blend of P3HT:PCBM at different concentrations and their photovoltaic properties were further evaluated. Here, the two dimensionally conjugated BDO ring with thiophene conjugated side chains is a promising material because of its structural symmetry and rigid fused aromatic system.32 This structural symmetry can enhance the electron delocalization and improve the charge mobility. DPP based low band gap polymers have attracted much interest in the field of OPVs due to their strong π–π interaction and strong electron withdrawing effect, resulting in efficient charge transport. Additionally, due to their ambipolar transport with balanced charge carrier mobilities, electrons and holes get transferred efficiently at the interface in BHJ devices and also avoids the charge trapping in themselves.33,34 The chemical structure of the D–A type conjugated polymer PBDO-T-TDP is shown in Scheme 1. In order to emphasize the effects of PBDO-T-TDP on charge transfer and photovoltaic properties of the P3HT:PCBM blend system, the absorption spectra, emission spectra, energy levels, mobility and film morphology were further investigated.

Synthesis of monomers and the polymer
The synthetic route for preparing monomers and the polymer PBDO-T-TDP is depicted in Scheme 1. The detailed synthetic procedure for the synthesis of monomers and the polymer is as follows.
4,8-Bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b;4,5-b′]-difuran (2)
In a dried three neck 100 ml argon purged round bottom flask, 7.3 ml of n-butyllithium (11.7 mmol, 1.6 M in THF) was added dropwise into a solution of 2-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene (2.08 g, 10.6 mmol) in THF (50 ml) at 0 °C. After the addition, the reaction mixture was warmed up to 50 °C and stirred for 1.5 h. Then, 4,8-dehydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran-4,8-dione 1 (0.5 g, 2.6 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture, which was then stirred for 2 h at 50 °C. After cooling down the reaction mixture to ambient temperature, SnCl2·2H2O (5.9 g, 26 mmol) in 10% HCl (12 ml) was added and then the reaction mixture was stirred for additional 2 h. Finally, it was poured into ice cold water and extracted twice with diethyl ether. Then the combined organic phase was dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and evaporated. The crude product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether as the eluent to obtain pure compound 2 as a pale yellow sticky liquid (0.7 g, yield 48%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 7.77 (d, 2H), 7.68 (d, 2H), 7.37 (d, 2H), 6.89 (d, 2H), 2.85 (d, 4H), 1.85 (m, 2H), 1.46–1.25 (br, 16H), 0.99–0.89 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz), δ (ppm): 148.6, 145.4, 145.2, 134.0, 127.4, 125.8, 123.7, 110.5, 107.4, 41.3, 34.8, 32.2, 29.1, 25.8, 23.2, 14.3, 11.0.
2,6-Bis(tributyltin)-4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophene-2-yl)benzo [1,2-b;4,5-b′]-difuran (3)
To a stirred solution of compound 2 (0.2 g, 0.36 mmol) in 10 ml anhydrous THF, 0.5 ml of n-butyllithium (0.79 mmol, 1.6 M in THF) was added dropwise at −78 °C under an argon atmosphere. Then the reaction mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 1 h. To this stirred solution, 0.25 g of tributyltin chloride (0.79 mmol) was added in one portion. The reaction mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 12 h. Then, it was poured into ice cold water and extracted with diethyl ether. The organic layer was washed with water three times and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4 and concentrated. The crude product was used as such for the next step without any further purification.
3,6-Dithiophen-2-yl-2,5-dihydropyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (6)
Freshly cut sodium pieces were added to tertiary-amyl alcohol (12.5 ml) in a round bottom flask under an argon atmosphere. The reactant was heated under constant stirring at 100 °C for 12 h. Then a solution of 2-thiophenecarbonitrile 4 (1.65 g, 15 mmol) was added dropwise into the reaction mixture followed by the addition of dimethyl succinate 5 (0.73 g, 5 mmol). The reaction mass was stirred at the same temperature for about 1.5 h, then the byproduct methanol was removed by distillation and the reaction was kept at 100 °C for 2 h. Subsequently the reaction mixture was cooled to 65 °C, and diluted with methanol. The diluted mixture was acidified with acetic acid and refluxed for ∼20 min. The hot suspension was filtered through a Buchner funnel. The obtained black filter cake was washed with hot methanol and dried in a vacuum to get the product and it was directly taken to the next step without any further purification.
2,5-Diethylhexyl-3,6-dithiophen-2-ylpyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrrole-1,4-dione (7)
Compound 6 (1.3 g, 4.33 mmol) and anhydrous potassium carbonate (2.4 g, 17.3 mmol) were dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (30 mL) and heated at 120 °C under an argon atmosphere. Furthermore, 2-ethylhexyl bromide (3.86 g, 20 mmol) was added to the reaction mass and it was stirred at the same temperature for about 40 h. After completion of the reaction, the reactant was cooled to room temperature and poured into ice water. The black colored suspension formed was then filtered off. The filtered cake was washed with water followed by methanol several times.

2,5-Diethylhexyl-3,6-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)pyrrolo[3,4-c]-pyrrole-1,4-dione (8)
To a stirred solution of compound 7 (452 mg, 0.86 mmol) in dry chloroform (20 ml), N-bromosuccinimide (314 mg, 1.76 mol) was added portion wise under an argon atmosphere and the reaction mass was protected from light. Then the reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for about 48 h. After completion of the reaction, the reactant was evaporated to remove chloroform and the residue was poured into methanol and filtered off. Furthermore, the crude product was washed thrice with hot methanol. The obtained deep purple colored solid was dried under vacuum (400 mg, yield 69%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 8.64 (d, 2H), 7.18 (d, 2H), 3.91 (m, 4H), 1.82 (m, 2H), 1.36–1.24 (m, 16H), 0.86 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz), δ (ppm): 161.1, 146.5, 133.0, 126.8, 122.2, 115.4, 106.7, 46.5, 40.5, 31.0, 29.0, 24.2, 23.6, 14.8, 11.0.
Synthesis of polymer PBDO-T-TDP
Monomer 3 (300 mg, 0.26 mmol) and monomer 8 (210 mg, 0.26 mmol) were added to 15 ml dry toluene. The stirred solution was purged with argon for 20 min and then Pd(PPh3)4 (15 mg) was added as the catalyst. The reactant was again purged with argon for 20 min and heated to reflux for 24 h under an inert atmosphere. Then the reactant was cooled to ambient temperature, and the polymer was precipitated by addition of 100 mL of methanol and the precipitate was filtered off, which was then subjected to Soxhlet extraction with methanol, hexane and chloroform. The polymer was recovered as a dark purple solid from the chloroform fraction by rotary evaporation and was dried under vacuum at 60 °C (120 mg, 38%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz), δ (ppm): 8.7 (br, 2H, Ar H), 7.6–6.5 (br, 8H, Ar H), 4.5–3.5 (br, 4H), 3.25–2.75 (br, 4H), 2.2–1.2 (br, 30H), 1.2–0.55 (br, 30H).
Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells and organic field effect transistors
Initially, the ITO-coated glass substrate (70–150 Ω sq−1) was consecutively cleaned in isopropyl alcohol, acetone and soap solution under sonication for ∼5 min. The cleaned substrate was then washed with deionized water and subsequently dried over nitrogen gas. The cleaned ITO substrate was UV-ozone treated and PEDOT:PSS was spin coated at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, the spin coated samples were annealed at 110 °C for 15 min under vacuum before being transferred into a glove box with less than 1 ppm of oxygen and moisture. Inside the glove box, polymer solutions of different weight ratios in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB) were prepared. Ternary blends were prepared by keeping the total polymer content to 7.5 mg ml−1. For a solution of the binary blend P3HT:PCBM and PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM with 1:1 wt ratio, 7.5 mg of each material was dissolved in 1 ml of DCB. The obtained blend solution was stirred at ambient temperature for ∼12 h. The blend solution was spin-coated on the ITO substrate at 1000 rpm for 60 s. The active layers of all the devices had a comparable thickness in the range of about 200 nm as determined using a profilometer.
To fabricate OFETs, the blend solution was spin-coated on the SiO2/Si substrate at 500 rpm for 60 s. The fabricated active layer for solar cells and OFETs was annealed at 150 °C for 15 min on a hot plate. This aids in the phase separation of the polymer and PCBM, which in turn helps in establishing a well functioning bulk heterojunction. For the polymer solar cell, cathode, an aluminium layer (100 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum (8 × 10−6 torr). The fabricated solar cell has an active area of 9 mm2. For OFETs, Au was used for source-drain electrodes. Au contacts were deposited on the top of the blend layer through a shadow mask at a base pressure of 10−6 torr. The devices have channel lengths varying from 60 to 100 μm and a channel width of 3 mm. In OFET, the mobility in the linear regime was determined using the equation35  where μ is the field-effect carrier mobility, COX is the capacitance per unit area of the gate dielectric insulator, VGS is the gate voltage, Vth is the threshold voltage, W is the channel width and L is the channel length. Here the mobility is extracted from the linear region by fitting the IDS–VDS curve.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route of polymer PBDO-T-TDP is shown in Scheme 1. In order to maintain good solubility of the polymer, a branched 2-ethylhexyl group was introduced in the polymer chain and synthesized using Stille coupling polymerization in the toluene solvent. The obtained polymer is observed to be completely soluble in common organic solvents such as THF, chloroform, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, etc. The molecular weight and polydispersity (PDI) were determined by gel permeation chromatography against polystyrene standards in the THF eluent. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) is 15800 and its PDI is 2.8. Thermal properties of the polymer were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis and were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. PBDO-T-TDP exhibited good thermal stability with the onset decomposition temperature (Td) being 350 °C (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  TGA plot of PBDO-T-TDP with a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere. 
Here the use of PBDO-T-TDP as a donor material in combination with the P3HT:PCBM matrix is due to the following reasons. PBDO-T-TDP has a narrow band gap (∼1.38 eV) and its absorption spectrum extends up to the near IR region. Thus, its absorption spectrum is complementary to the P3HT spectrum, which has absorption maxima around 2.5 eV, where PBDO-T-TDP has an absorption minimum. The good spectroscopic response coverage of these two polymers (PBDO-T-TDP and P3HT) makes use of PC71BM (PCBM), which is otherwise used with low band gap polymers to harvest more photons in the visible region. The energy levels of P3HT, PBDO-T-TDP and PCBM as calculated by electrochemical analysis are summarized in Fig. 2.
 Fig. 2  Chemical structure of PBDO-T-TDP and energy levels [eV] of electrodes and semiconductors used in ternary blends. 
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PBDO-T-TDP are positioned in an ideal range that lies between those of P3HT and PCBM. As a result, photoinduced charge transfer is energetically allowed between P3HT and PCBM, between PBDO-T-TDP and PCBM, as well as between P3HT and PBDO-T-TDP. In addition, the transfer of any kind of charge located on PBDO-T-TDP to the P3HT:PCBM matrix is energetically favored.14
Optical properties
The absorption profile of a thermally annealed film of P3HT:PCBM both neat and blended with various concentrations of PBDO-T-TDP and of PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM is shown in Fig. 3. The absorption spectra of the P3HT:PCBM film showed three characteristic peaks at ∼505, ∼550 and ∼600 nm, which is generally ascribed to the crystalline nature of P3HT.36PBDO-T-TDP showed strong absorption in the range of 500–895 nm originating from their intramolecular charge interaction (ICT) and a weak absorption within the range of 300–450 nm attributed to the π–π* transition. After gradual addition of the PBDO-T-TDP content into the P3HT:PCBM blend system, the ternary blend exhibits an increase in absorbance in the range of 620–850 nm, due to the PBDO-T-TDP absorption.
 Fig. 3  Optical absorption spectra of P3HT:PCBM (1:1 wt%), PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM (1:1 wt%), P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM (0.8:0.2:1 wt%), P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM (0.7:0.3:1 wt%), P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM (0.6:0.4:1 wt%) films. 
The resulting broad absorption wavelength range in the ternary blend system is expected to generate higher photocurrent output than the binary blend device.34 Furthermore, the vibronic shoulders of the P3HT absorption peaks at 550 and 600 nm that were due to the interchain interaction become less defined in the ternary blend mixture. Moreover, the peak positions do not shift significantly. Overall, it is expected that the increased light harvesting over the wavelength range of 300–850 nm in the ternary blend system facilitates the improvement of Jsc in the device, with increased exciton generation and exciton/hole mobilities in the active layer, ultimately enhancing the PCE of the device.
The energy transfer reaction in the ternary blend system was monitored using photoluminescence (PL) quenching studies. As shown in Fig. 4, the PL of P3HT is quenched completely upon addition of the PBDO-T-TDP content (P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP, 1:1 wt%). PBDO-T-TDP did not show any emission peak in the range of 400–1100 nm. Whereas, highly efficient PL quenching was observed for the ternary blend film (P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM, 0.7:0.3:1 wt%). The observed trend could be due to the ultra fast photoinduced charge transfer from P3HT to PBDO-T-TDP and from P3HT to PCBM viaPBDO-T-TDP.37–39 Therefore this step wise configuration can accelerate the charge carrier transfer, resulting in an increased extraction of the charge carriers. Overall, these results support the proposed charge transfer mechanism at the interface of the photoactive layer (Fig. 2).14

Electrochemical properties
The electrochemical properties of the polymer were studied using the cyclic voltammetry (CV) technique and their HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated. Cyclic voltammograms of the polymer were recorded by spin coating the polymer solution on a glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode with 0.1 M tetrabutyl-hexafluorophosphate in CH3CN as the electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. For calibration, the redox potential of ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) was measured under the same conditions and it was located at 0.11 V to the Ag/AgCl electrode. It was assumed that the redox potential of Fc/Fc+ has an absolute energy level of −4.80 eV under vacuum.40 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer were calculated according to the following equation41EHOMO = −(Eoxon − EFC/FC+ + 4.80) eVELUMO = −(Eredon − EFC/FC+ + 4.80) eVwhere Eoxon is the onset oxidation potential vs. Ag/AgCl and Eredon is the onset reduction potential vs. Ag/AgCl. As shown in Fig. 5, the oxidation and reduction onsets of the polymer are located at 0.41 V and −1.20 V, respectively, leading to HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.1 and −3.49 eV. The electrochemical band gap is found to be 1.61 eV. Optical and electrochemical properties of the polymer are summarized in Table 1.

Theoretical calculations
To investigate the electron distribution of the frontier orbitals of the polymer, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-311G (d) level. The long alkyl side chains in the repeating unit of the PBDO-T-TDP were replaced with the methyl group and their electron density distribution was estimated. The optimized geometry of the PBDO-T-TDP is shown in Fig. 6. The electron density of HOMO of the polymer is distributed more uniformly along the entire π-conjugated system, indicating that the HOMO energy level is affected by both the electron donor (BDO) and acceptor (DPP) units in the polymer. In addition, the electron density of LUMO of the polymer is almost entirely localized on the DPP unit. The HOMO and LUMO levels of the polymer calculated from the DFT calculation are predicted to be −4.64 and −3.4 eV, respectively and the band gap is 1.24 eV. The theoretically predicted values are almost similar to the trends observed from optical and electrochemical studies.

XRD studies
In order to investigate the molecular arrangement of the blend films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the P3HT:PCBM, both neat and blended with various concentrations of PBDO-T-TDP, were recorded and are presented in Fig. 7. The films were prepared on the glass substrate by spin coating the blend solutions followed by annealing at 120 °C for 15 min. P3HT:PCBM blend films showed characteristic peaks at 2θ = 5.4°, 10.66° and 15.97° assigned to (100), (200) and (300) reflections, respectively. It was found that the XRD measurements of PBDO-T-TDP exhibited no apparent peaks due to its amorphous nature. On addition of various weight ratios of PBDO-T-TDP in the P3HT:PCBM blend system, the intensity of the peak at 2θ = 5.4° decreases continuously. The average crystal size (L) of the P3HT in the ternary blend system was estimated using the Scherrer equation and the values are given in Table 2. The crystal size of the P3HT decreases upon addition of an additive in the ternary blend system. This indicates that the degree of crystallinity of P3HT was reduced when PBDO-T-TDP with more amorphous character was blended in the ternary system. Notably, a drastic decrease in the crystal size of P3HT was observed after addition of a higher concentration of additive in the ternary blend system (40 wt%). These results suggest that there is a significant influence on the molecular arrangement of the ternary blend film at this weight ratio.

Charge carrier mobility studies
OFETs with a conventional top-contact and bottom gate configuration were fabricated using both pristine P3HT and P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP as the active layer. The output current–voltage plots for the OFETs fabricated on the Si/SiO2 substrate are shown in Fig. 8. The devices based on PBDO-T-TDP showed a typical hole transporting characteristic with a mobility of 6.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. In the case of P3HT based OFETs, the charge carrier mobility in the linear region is 1.04 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 which is higher than that of the PBDO-T-TDP based transistor mobility. Ambipolar transport characteristic behavior was observed for binary (P3HT:PCBM) and ternary blend (P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM) based OFETs (Fig. 9). At low negative gate bias (∼0 V), the drain current did not saturate and increased linearly with the drain voltage and became smaller at higher gate voltage (Fig. 9b and d). This increase in drain current is due to the electron injection from the drain electrode at lower gate voltage. However, hole accumulation transport was observed at higher gate voltage.

As shown in Fig. 9a and c, the devices showed a typical n-type transporting characteristic on applying the positive biases. The hole and electron mobilities calculated from binary and ternary blend based transistors are summarized in Table 2. The electron mobility of the binary blend device (P3HT:PCBM) was nearly one order higher than its hole mobility, while both the mobilities were in the same order in the ternary blend system (P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM). The highest electron and hole mobility, 5.13 × 10−4 and 4.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively was observed for P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM (0.7:0.3:1 wt%) based OFTs. It is known that in solar cells the balanced charge carrier mobility avoids the accumulation of space charges which is detrimental for the device efficiency.42,43 Therefore, due to their balanced charge transport properties, ternary blend devices P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM (0.7:0.3:1 and 0.8:0.2:1 wt%) are expected to show an enhanced photovoltaic device performance as compared to their binary ones. Furthermore, on addition of 40 wt% of PBDO-T-TDP into the ternary system, the hole mobility decreases rapidly due to the poor crystallinity and non-connectivity of the P3HT matrix. For comparison, devices based on PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM (1:1 wt%) were also fabricated, which show only an electron transport mobility of 2.92 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.
Photovoltaic properties and active layer morphology
The polymer solar cells were fabricated having a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM. Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the P3HT:PCBM blend with various concentrations of PBDO-T-TDP under AM 1.5 G illumination (100 mW cm−2) are shown in Fig. 10 and summarized in Table 2. The binary blend P3HT:PCBM device exhibited a Jsc of 8.30 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.6 V, a fill factor (FF) of 43.2% and yielded a PCE of 2.15%. The device based on the PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM blend film showed a PCE of 0.85%. On addition of different weight ratios of PBDO-T-TDP in the P3HT:PCBM blend system, significant improvement in the device properties were observed relative to that of pristine P3HT:PCBM. Notably, the device fabricated with the lowest additive concentration (0.9:0.1:1 wt% for P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM) exhibits similar device performance to that of the binary blend. The best device performance was observed at a wt% of 0.7:0.3:1 (P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM). Here the improvement in the device efficiency as compared to their binary ones is mainly owing to the increase in Jsc (from 8.30 to 9.5 mA cm−2) and FF (from 43.2 to 56.4%). Their corresponding PCE is 3.10% which is approximately 69% higher relative to that of the neat P3HT:PCBM based device. Moreover, the increase in Jsc value of the ternary blend device is due to their larger absorption breadth leading to a rise in the number of photogenerated carriers. Furthermore, there is no significant improvement in the Voc observed after addition of PBDO-T-TDP to the binary ones. At a higher concentration of PBDO-T-TDP (40 wt%) in the ternary blend system, the device performance was drastically reduced, due to the poor crystallinity of the P3HT film. As a result, lower Jsc, FF value and ultimately poor device performance (1.14%) were observed. The obtained PCE values of the ternary blend system are in accordance with the OFET results. This improvement in the OPV performance of the ternary blend system was further explained by EQE and film morphological studies.

J–V characteristics of P3HT:PCBM blend films with various concentrations of PBDO-T-TDP. 
External quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra reveal the photon–current response of the devices with respect to the wavelength. The EQE spectra of the device P3HT:PCBM (1:1 wt%) and P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM (0.7:0.3:1 wt%) are shown in Fig. 11. The spectra revealed an excellent photocurrent response over the absorption range of 300–620 nm. Addition of PBDO-T-TDP to the P3HT:PCBM results in a significant increase in the photocurrent signal in the region between 300 and 400 nm and also in the near IR region. The shapes of the EQE plots for the devices were similar to the corresponding absorption spectra (Fig. 3), indicating that the full polymer absorption range contributed to photocurrent generation. The solar cell photocurrent density (Jsc) calculated by integrating EQE spectra with the AM 1.5 G spectrum is found to be 7.34 and 7.95 mA cm−2, respectively, for P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM. The Jsc values calculated by the EQE study are comparable to the J–V characteristics.

Fig. 12a–h presents the tapping mode AFM images of binary and ternary blend films. The P3HT:PCBM film showed a smooth surface with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of ∼2.36 nm. By incorporating PBDO-T-TDP into the P3HT:PCBM matrix induces a relatively coarser surface (RMS = ∼7 nm), but stay relatively steady thereof. Here the white spots in the phase contrast images indicate the concentration of the PBDO-T-TDP component. As shown in Fig. 12g, the image indicates the uniform distribution of the PBDO-T-TDP (30 wt%) component in the ternary blend film. At this weight ratio most likely polymers are stacked together to form percolation channels for charge transport.44,45 Therefore, improved energy transfer is likely leading to a higher device performance at a wt% of 0.7:0.3:1 (P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM). This trend is well in agreement with the result obtained from photovoltaic studies. On addition of higher concentrations of PBDO-T-TDP (40 wt%) into the P3HT:PCBM matrix, severe aggregation and larger domains were observed (Fig. 12h). This leads to poor charge separation and severe electron and hole recombination within this device. As a result, the device performance was significantly dropped down in the ternary blend device at 0.6:0.4:1 wt%.

Therefore, we conclude that the improved photovoltaic properties of the ternary blend system at a wt% of 0.7:0.3:1 (P3HT:PBDO-T-TDP:PCBM) arise from balanced charge carrier mobility, increased light harvesting and better morphology of the blend film.
Conclusions
In summary, a new D–A structured conjugated polymer based on the BDO donor unit and DPP acceptor unit, PBDO-T-TDP, was synthesized using Stille coupling reaction and used as an additive in the P3HT:PCBM based BHJ solar cells. Here the introduction of a low band gap material improved the photovoltaic properties of the P3HT:PCBM blend system and the best PCE of 3.10% with a Jsc of 9.5 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.58 V and a FF of 56.4% was achieved. To understand this improvement, the crystallinity, morphology, electron and hole mobility of the binary and ternary blends were further studied. The best ternary blend device showed balanced charge carrier mobility along with uniform distribution of PBDO-T-TDP in the ternary system, as revealed by OFETs and AFM studies. These results indicate that ternary blend based solar cells are promising candidates for the next generation of solution-processable solar cells and have the potential to overcome the predicted ultimate efficiencies for binary blend photovoltaic devices.
