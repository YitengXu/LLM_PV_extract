    , Accepted 2nd November 2017First published on 13th November 2017AbstractWe report here on the preparation and on the electronic properties of a panchromatic Ru(II) sensitizer based on a new ligand which allows for higher molar extinction coefficients in the visible and better performances (32% efficiency improvement) over conventional “black dye” in transparent DSSC.
Introduction of a tris-thiocyanato-ruthenium(II) terpyridyl complex where the terpyridyl ligand was substituted by three carboxylic groups in 4,4′,4′′ position has led to significant advances in the efficient sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 solar cells over the whole visible range, extending into the near-IR region up to 920 nm.1,2 Several studies have been carried out in order to improve the performances of black absorber dyes, addressing theoretically3 or experimentally the effect of changes at the non-chromophoric (ancillary) ligands or at chromophoric polypyridine ligand.4 The panchromatic sensitization was also extended successfully beyond 1000 nm by substituting the ruthenium center with osmium. The ×3 higher spin–orbit coupling constant of Os with respect to Ru5 allowed direct access to spin forbidden Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer, 3MLCT, states which are responsible of intense absorption in the NIR spectral region and of efficient charge injection to the conduction band of titanium dioxide.6–8 Although the recent application of lead iodide perovskites has increased both red sensitivity and efficiency, up to reach the record conversion near 20%,9 the use of transparent dye sensitized solar devices in window systems still represents one of the most interesting and unique applications for DSSCs technology (Scheme 1). For integration in building facades, in fact, both power conversion efficiency and transparency should be considered since transparency, other than aesthetic, clearly affects lightning energy consumption.

Upon illumination (1) electrons are injected from the photoexcited dye into TiO2 (2) and collected at the FTO substrate, while the electrolyte (RED) reduces the oxidized dye (3) and transports the positive charges to the catalytic counter electrode where regeneration occurs (4). The difference between the quasi-Fermi level of the semiconductor and the redox potential of the relay gives the open circuit photovoltage generated by the cell. Recombinative losses are indicated by thin arrows (a, b). 
The major drawback of the typical black dye design is the moderate extinction coefficient which forces to use extremely thick and opaque TiO2 films (15–40 μm) in order to extract high efficiencies.10–13
This type of TiO2 films are clearly unsuitable for transparent applications, thus lacking one of the most attractive features of DSSCs for building integration.
In order to increase the light harvesting efficiency of transparent devices we have now devised a new black absorber where the molar extinction coefficient of the relevant MLCT bands of the tris-thiocyanate ruthenium complex is increased by modifying the chromophoric tris-carboxy terpyridine ligand with the introduction of π conjugating spacers between the terpyridine rings and the anchoring carboxylic groups (NBDFig. 1).
 Fig. 1  4,4′,4′′-([2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine]-4,4′,4′′-triyltris(ethyne-2,1-diyl))tribenzoic acid ruthenium tris thiocyanate complex (NBD). 
Herein we report the comparison of NBD spectroscopic and photo-electrochemical properties with the original black dye (BD, [Ru(II)(HTcTerpy)NCS3](TBA)3),2 showing improved cell performances when transparent DSSCs are assembled with the newly synthesized dye.
The preparation of the new 4,4′,4′′-([2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridine]-4,4′,4′′-triyltris(ethyne-2,1-diyl))tribenzoic acid ligand, 5 is shown in Scheme 2 and detailed in S1 of the ESI.† The desired ligand has been obtained through a Sonogashira reaction on 4-substituted pyridines, followed by a Stille reaction to build up the terpyridine structure. In the chosen synthetic pathway, the first step has been a trans-esterification of the methyl ester with isobutanol, to achieve an improved solubility of each intermediate in organic solvents. Functionalization of the terpyridine ring has been carried out through a selective Sonogashira reaction at low temperature. Kinetic control allowed to obtain a selective reaction on iodine, leaving bromine group available for the subsequent terpyridine assembling by microwave assisted Stille14 coupling reaction.15 Finally isobutyl esters have been cleaved by alkaline treatment providing the desired ligand. NBD was prepared by stoichiometrically reacting Ru(II) dichloro p-cymene dimer with ligand 5 in DMF under microwave (MW) irradiation for 20 minutes (160 °C), followed by addition of excess NH4NCS and MW heating for further 15 minutes. Evaporation of the solvent afforded the crude product which was purified by precipitation and gel permeation chromatography in DMF and methanol. Synthetic details (S2) and structural characterization are given in the ESI.† Due to the insertion of the benzyl acetylene spacer between each pyridine ring and the carboxylic group, the absorption spectrum of NBD shows more intense transitions when compared to BD: the Ligand Centered (LC) π–π* band at 340 nm is increased by a factor of 3 and is followed, in the visible region, by two main bands, a sharper one at 448 nm and a broader one peaking at 636 nm (Table S1 ESI† and Fig. 2), which are both red shifted (by ca. 50 nm and 20 nm respectively) and more intense (by ×2 and ×1.2 respectively) with respect to the conventional BD. TDDFT calculations16 carried out at the B3LYP/LANL2DZ in ethanol (PCM) indicate that these bands are composed by a manifold of electronic excitations (Fig. S1 ESI†) having a mixed MLCT-LLCT (Ligand to Ligand Charge Transfer) character, involving charge transfer from orbitals having a mixed Ru(II)/NCS composition to π* orbitals belonging to the conjugated terpyridine.

 Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of NBDvs. BD in EtOH. 
The relative intensity of the computed vertical transitions allows to reproduce well the shape of the absorption spectrum, once corrected for the systematic red shift (0.5 eV) originated by TDDFT when treating long range CT.17–19 The Electron Density Difference Maps (Fig. S2 ESI†) indicate that conjugation is well extended to the carboxylic anchoring group, thanks to the planarity of ligand 5, establishing a good electronic coupling between the CT states of NBD and TiO2. EDDMS clearly confirm that the increased optical extinction of NBD arises from the elongation of the electric dipole moment of the optical transitions (Fig. S2 ESI†). The energy of the frontier orbitals (Fig. S3 ESI†) are in reasonable agreement with the electrochemical data (Table 1) taken at 100 mV s−1 in DMF for solubility reasons. While the oxidation is quasi-reversible at 0.64 V vs. SCE, the reduction is irreversible with a poly-electronic wave showing a shoulder at −1.26 V vs. SCE ad a well-defined diffusional peak at −1.56 V SCE (Fig. S4 ESI†). The frontier energy levels are thus suitably positioned to establish efficient charge transfer to TiO2 and to the redox electrolyte (I−/I3− at ca. 0.2 V vs. SCE). Consistent with experimental results (1.90 eV) (Fig. S3 ESI†) the computed HOMO–LUMO energy gap of NBD (2.16 eV) is only slightly lower than that of BD (2.18 eV). Indeed both NBD and BD show a similar absorption onset at ca. 800 nm. It should be recalled that the low energy absorption tail of these Ru(II) complexes bear the contribution of excitations to triplet states that are not considered in the computation nor observed in electrochemistry. Indeed NBD is weakly emitting at RT with the onset of the 3MLCT emission in ethanol at 774 nm and maximum at 895 nm extending into the NIR spectral region (Fig. S5 ESI†). From the crossing of the normalized absorption and emission spectra an E00 = 1.6 eV was estimated for NBD. If we neglect differences in outer sphere solvent interaction, a triplet excited state oxidation potential of ca. −1 V vs. SCE can be estimated for NBD, safely suggesting the occurrence of activationless electron injection from the excited triplet state to the conduction band of TiO2 in non-aqueous solvents as well.20 It is known that charge injection by Ru(II) dyes can occur from both singlet and triplet excited states spanning a wide interval of rate constants, ranging from 100 ps to the sub-ps time regime.21–24

Injection into TiO2 occurs efficiently as in the case of BD as demonstrated by the photoaction spectra reported in Fig. 3A, recorded on transparent films in the presence of 0.8 M iodide and 0.1 M Mg2+ (electrolyte b). It can be observed that, consistent with the absorption spectrum (Fig. 3B) NBD displays improved conversion between 400 and 500 nm and below 650 nm. Notably, at 800 nm its IPCE is still ca. 10%.

Photovoltaic performance of transparent and opaque DSSC containing ca. 6 μm thick TiO2 photoanodes sensitized with BD and NBD were tested under full AM 1.5 G and the results are summarized in Table 2. Of the different electrolytes normally used to evaluate the DSSCs performances, the composition giving the highest power conversion efficiency for NBD was (b) consisting of 0.1 M I2 – 0.1 M MgI2 – 0.15 M GuNCS and 0.6 M PMII in CH3CN. In these conditions NBD delivered on ca. 6 μm transparent TiO2 (Dyesol 18NR-T) a Jsc of 11 mA cm−2 (ca. 15% more than BD) with a relative efficiency enhancement of 32% (Fig. 3C). On ca. 6 μm opaque TiO2 (Dyesol 18NR-AO) the photocurrents for both NBD and BD are quite levelled, consistent with the better harvesting of light scattering TiO2 substrates. Nevertheless, NBD maintains an edge over BD in both photocurrent and, more significantly, in photovoltage resulting in 4.25% vs. ca. 3% efficiency.

We have observed however that NBD suffers from low photocurrents (a ca. 8 × drop, Table 2) when 4-tert-butylpyridine or benzimidazole are added to the electrolyte formulation with the aim of improving cell photovoltage. Such an effect is still under investigation. The introduction of a kinetic barrier for charge injection to TiO2 due to upward shift of the semiconductor states23 may partly explain such observation, although BD, with similar energetics, exhibits, under identical conditions, a much smaller drop in photocurrent (ca. 50%) which is compensated by a significant gain in photovoltage and Fill Factor, leading to overall improved efficiency (up to 4.85%, Table 2) when basic additives are present. Other recombination mechanisms possibly mediated through super exchange effects by the highly delocalized chromophoric ligand may become more active in NBD, in the presence of a negative shift of the TiO2 Fermi level. This possibility is currently under investigation.
In conclusion, we have reported here the synthesis of a new ligand which can serve as a flexible building block for the preparation of complexes having improved optical and electronic properties while maintaining good ground and excited state energetics for photoinduced charge separation. The incorporation of this ligand in a new “black” dye design resulted indeed in significant advantages over [Ru(II)(HTcTerpy)NCS3](TBA)3 on transparent TiO2, coupling a pleasant intense dark green coloration to increased conversion efficiency.
