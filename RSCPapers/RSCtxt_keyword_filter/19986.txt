Introduction
In this Perspective article, the recent progress on colloidal thiol-capped CdTe nanocrystals (NCs) is analyzed and perspectives of the related research fields are discussed. Thiol-capped CdTe NCs are no doubt the most successful example of the colloidal quantum dots directly synthesized in aqueous solution. Among the main highlights expressing this success are very simple, yet versatile synthesis; a great variety of surface functionalities offered by easy employment of various thiols as capping agent molecules at the synthetic stage; ease of processability leading to a large variety of composite materials employing thiol-capped CdTe NCs as building blocks; and last by not least high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yields (QY) of as-prepared core-only CdTe nanoparticles reaching 40–80% in aqueous medium. Following our first reports on thiol-capped CdTe NCs in a predecessor journal of PCCP, Ber. Bunsen-Ges. Phys. Chem.,1,2 three major publications appeared in journals3,4 and as a book chapter5 highlighting the respective state-of-the-art of their synthesis and optical properties. During the last decade, thiol-capped CdTe NCs have attracted a wave of research interest worldwide, resulting in at least hundred publications per year which not only addressed different aspects related to this specific kind of material but also introduced a broad palette of related developments in different research fields. This Perspective analyzes and summarizes both the traditional developments related to thiol-capped CdTe NCs (i.e., novel synthesis or assembly approaches) and newly emerging research fields where these nanoparticles are employed, very often as a model system. Our analysis is based on the overview of very recent (basically last 2–3 years) publications, and is presented in four blocks related to the progress in the synthesis and design of novel materials and functionalities, to sophisticated assemblies of thiol-capped NCs, to development and validation of analytical and spectroscopic methods relying on thiol-capped CdTe NCs as a model system, and, finally, to applications in various fields ranging from light harvesting and energy transfer to biotechnology.
1. Progress in synthesis and particle design: novel materials, new functionalities
The use of short-chain, water-soluble thiols as capping agents for nanoparticles synthesized in water is very simple and versatile, and can be employed to a large variety of metal chalcogenides, as demonstrated by earlier work.6–8 The precipitation reaction between the metal and chalcogenide precursors takes place in the aqueous medium in presence of short-chain thiol molecules, and metal–thiolate complexes formed at initial stage are further consumed to build crystalline nanoparticles under heating, microwave treatment, etc. The resulting inorganic core (e.g., CdTe) is surrounded by the shell of organic thiol molecules providing NCs with colloidal stability and chemical functionality, with sulfur from mercapto-group passivating metal atoms at the surface.9 Organic capping molecules of NCs are denoted in the related literature as ligands, stabilizers or capping agents. At present, the most often used ligands for CdTe NCs include two mercaptoacid compounds, thioglycolic acid (TGA) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA), which import negative surface charge to nanoparticles and allow to obtain strongly emitting colloids which are stable for months and even years in terms of both their colloidal stability against coagulation and their constantly high emission quantum yield. The use of other thiols as stabilizing ligands on demand is equally possible, with successful examples including mercaptoethanol and thioglycerol (TG),1L-cysteine,10 cysteamine or 2-mercaptoethylamine (MA),3,11,12 glutathione (GSH),13–15 tiopronin,16 dimethylaminoethanthiol (DMAET),3,17 dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA),18 mercaptosuccinic acid,19 2-mercaptopropionic acid,20 and a plenty of specially designed stabilizers, e.g. amphiphilic polyethylenglycol (PEG)-based thiols21 or chiral D- and L-cysteinemethylester hydrochloride.22Fig. 1 shows chemical structures of typical thiol capping ligands employed in the aqueous synthesis of CdTe and other thiol-stabilized NCs, illustrating the molecular functionalities provided by these capping agents. A proper choice of each particular thiol ligand is key in obtaining the desired chemical functionality, and provides surface –COOH, –NH2, –OH, etc. groups necessary for further processing of the NCs by e.g. electrostatic assembly or covalent linking to the surfaces and (bio)molecules. The use of aminoacids (e.g. GSH or L-cysteine) is promising for better biocompatibility of nanoparticles, while DHLA provides better surface binding due to the presence of two mercapto-groups. The proper choice of the optimal stabilizer also depends on the target NC material in terms of their strong emission. While TGA is one of the optimal stabilizers for CdTe NCs in this respect, strongly emitting TGA-capped ZnSe NCs can be obtained only after post-preparative photochemical treatment.23 The use of GSH, however, allows for the direct synthesis of strongly emitting ZnSe and ZnSe/ZnS core/shell NCs.24 Similarly, TG is probably one of the best stabilizers for the synthesis of strongly near-infrared emitting CdHgTe25,26 and HgTe NCs,27 while CdTe NCs capped with TG, although stable, possess only moderate emission.3 The ability of some particular ligands to provide strongly emissive NCs has been a subject of earlier research,28,29 which related the availability of carboxy-groups being able for additional (besides the thiol-group) coordination with surface Cd atoms to both the improved emission intensity and the long-term colloidal stability of TGA and MPA capped NCs. Amino-thiols such as cysteamine and DMAET provide moderately high PL QY, while binding labile to the NC surface so that the long term colloidal stability of the respective solutions is not optimal.3 Thus, TGA, MPA and the aminoacid GSH are among the most widely used ligands nowadays providing CdTe NCs of the highest quality. The photostability of thiol-capped CdTe NCs under continuous illumination strongly depends on the surface quality of the respective fractions,3 with an additional surface inorganic passivation being favorable over purely organic ligand shells.30

At present, there is an increasing demand on materials soluble in specific solvents required by specific applications, such as thin film (photovoltaic or LED) technology, fabrication of functional and processable NC-polymer composites, etc. From this point of view, the use of colloidal NCs provides the unique opportunity of adapting functional (e.g. strongly light emitting, or strongly light absorbing) semiconductor core to the required conditions (e.g. solubility in the solvent of choice) by a proper design of the stabilizing organic shell. Unfortunately, some attractive solvents, e.g. alcohols and ethers, are known as non-solvents for NCs and are commonly used for their precipitation.31 The progress in this direction may be exemplified by the existence of TG-capped CdTe NCs dispersable in methanol4 or the use of water–ethanol mixtures for synthesis of NC-doped silica beads.32 CdTe NCs synthesized in water in the presence of thiocholine bromide can be transferred into hydrophobic ionic liquids based on bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and hexafluorophosphate anions without using any additional surfactant, with a significant emission enhancement observed.33 Amphiphilic NCs capable of spontaneous and reversible transfer between aqueous and non-polar (toluene, chloroform, etc.) phases have been synthesized in presence of amphiphilic multidentant ligands34 or thiolated methoxypolyetylenglycols.21 These strategies of using multifunctional ligands allow virtually unlimited design of solvents' compatibility and will definitely find applications in the nearest future.
Recent developments in the thiol-capping strategy used in the aqueous synthesis of novel nanocrystalline materials is exemplified by the alloyed CdSexTe1−x,35,36 CdTexS1−x37 or ZnxCd1−xSe38–40 nanoparticles with a variable anion/cation content, NCs with different surface protection shells,41,42 Mn2+ dopped CdS NCs,43 and by the DHLA-capped PbS NCs.44 Recent research into environmentally friendly but strongly emitting NCs resulted in the synthesis of ZnxCd1−xSe NCs with low (∼10%) Cd content,45 CdTe NCs synthesized in presence of gelatin possessing improved biocompatibility and significantly lower rates of cytotoxicity,41 as well as in Cd-free blue emitting ZnSe0.98Te0.02 NCs compatible with easily processable polymer polyurethane (Fig. 2).15,46 Novel approaches to the aqueous synthesis of thiol-capped core/shell NCs (with both core and shell being II–VI semiconductor materials) resulted in strongly emitting CdTe/CdS NCs synthesized in presence of tiopronin and GSH,16 CdTe/ZnTe NCs with cysteine capping shell optimized for targeted bioimaging,47 CdTe/CdS/ZnS core–shell–shell NCs designed to possess relatively low cytotoxicity,48 type II CdTe/CdS NCs stabilized by MPA,49 and CdSe/ZnxCd1−xS NCs synthesized with the assistance of GSH.50

Although successful shape control approaches are not yet established for aqueous synthesis of thiol-capped NCs, the following examples show the progress in this direction. L-cysteine capped CdTe NCs with partly depleted surface can be directly converted (by reaction with ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA)) into Te nanorods, including angled nanorods of various shapes. EDTA can strongly bind to the surface of the depleted CdTe NPs to form Cd(EDTA)2− complex, and the gradually released into solution Te2− anions are oxidized by oxygen in air and finally are converted to anisotropic Te NCs.51,52 The formation of angled rods happens under subsequent oriented attachment of rods and the following Ostwald ripening.53 In a further step these nanorods may play the role of template for the formation of hollow angled gold nanoparticles or nanotubes.54
In addition to the proper choice of the capping agents, pH and the precursor's ratio are two other factors determining successful synthesis of II–VI NCs in the aqueous medium. Increasing efforts on the optimization of existing synthetic approaches are obviously evidenced from the recent literature. Examples are reports on optimized ratios of components in CdTe NCs synthesis leading to even higher PL QY,55–58 optimized synthesis of TGA-capped CdxHg1−xTe NCs with strong emission tunable over 900–1600 nm spectral region,59 extending of HgTe NCs emission to infrared region up to 3.5 μm,60 band-edge emitting thiol-capped CdSe NCs,61 and rapid synthesis of bigger-sized CdTe NCs.62
Theoretical understanding of the mechanisms and modeling of nucleation and growth of thiol-capped NCs, as well as of factors influencing their emission properties has been addressed by several research groups in recent years. Examples are modeling of optimal precursor ratios used in CdTe NC synthesis,62,63 experimental and theoretical study of growth kinetics,64 estimation of CdTe NC charge,65 modeling of the nature of electrical dipole moment of zinc-blende (CdS or CdTe) NCs,66,67 simulation of the role of electrical double layer on the NC growth,68,69 study of ligand dynamics on the surface of NCs and its relevance to emission properties,70 and low temperature study of exciton recombination dynamics suggesting that the relaxation pathway depends on population between two kinds of excited states of the CdTe NC generated by an electron-hole exchange interaction in the tightly confined particle-in-a-box system.71 Although the value of mentioned theoretical studies is difficult to neglect, this field still suffers from fragmentation, and more interdisciplinary studies and information exchange between theory- and experiment-oriented groups as well as between chemists and physicists are bound to follow.
2. Assemblies of thiol-capped NCs: toward sophisticated architectures
As outlined above, thiol capping of the NCs determines their surface functionality and makes this type of NCs the ideal model system for building various assemblies. Starting from relatively straightforward approaches, e.g. formation of thin mono- and multi-layer composite films of NCs on flat or curved surfaces by layer-by-layer (LbL) electrostatic assembly72–75 or covalent linking,76 this field is developing nowadays towards more and more sophisticated architectures with a variety of potential applications. Some of the recent examples include CdTe nanorods surrounded by hierarchically organized CdTe NCs of different sizes,77,78 which is a nice realization of light harvesting and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) concept between differently sized NCs79 in the direction of nanorod. Magnetic-luminescent core–shell nanocomposites have been created from magnetite cores surrounded by aminated silica shells, electrostatically assembled CdTe NCs and finally protective outer silica shells.80,81 Ag2Te nanowires have been produced by Ag+ ions-induced transformation of CdTe nanowires self-assembled from CdTe NCs.82 Covalent linking as a nanoassembly method is further developed in the direction of immobilizing NCs on thin, fluid films consisting of poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) polymer chains tethered by one end to an underlying substrate in a polymer brush configuration.83 The protocol involves covalent bonding between amino groups present on the surface of CdTe NCs (stabilized by MA) and carboxylic groups of PAA polymer chains. Exploitation of a thin polymer brush (ca. 4.5 nm) was found to suppress nanoparticle aggregation and facilitate complete surface coverage.83 Stable highly emissive conjugates of cysteine-capped CdTe NCs and NH2-terminated dendrimers were fabricated using glutaric dialdehyde linker.84
As an example of a functional polymer-NC assembly, electrostatic complexes of a water soluble fluorescent conjugated polymer poly[9,9-bis(3′-((N,N-dimethyl)-N-ethylammonium)-propyl)-2,7-fluorene-alt-1,4-phenylene] dibromide (PDFD) and thiol-capped CdTe NCs have been designed to provide a cascaded FRET for DNA hybridization detection.85 PDFD had two functions in the detection scheme: as a light harvesting antenna it enhanced the emission of QDs by the first level FRET, and inverted the sign of the surface charge of QDs thus providing a positively charged surface to allow negatively charged dye-labeled DNA to interact with the resulting complex (Fig. 3). This interaction caused the second level FRET to infrared-emitting dye labeled on the probe DNA, providing a reliable signal-on sensing platform discriminating between complementary and non-complementary DNA.

Controllable ageing, chemical, and photochemical treatment of colloidal NCs may lead to formation of 3D networks (gelation).86–88 The formation of highly porous (pore surface of ca. 210 m2 g−1 and monolith density of less than 1/500th of corresponding bulk material), strongly emitting CdTe NC aerogels has been demonstrated.87 Their hybrids with polymers are processable by common casting or thermoplating techniques. The aerogels can also be self-assembled from composites of CdTe NCs and Cd–TGA complexes.89 The high porosity of light emitting aerogels can be utilized for optical sensing and photocatalysis.
An interesting example of CdTe NC assembly is the spontaneous formation of free-floating sheets which occurs when DMAET is used as the capping agent,17 or organization of TGA-stabilized nanoparticles into nanowires90 or twisted ribbons.91 Comparative analysis of the self-assembly behaviour of TGA- and DMAET-capped CdTe NCs, showed that NC shape, directional attraction, and electrostatic interactions are key to determining the anisotropy of the NC–NC interaction and the final self-assembled structures. Moreover, these data show the resemblance of NC assemblies to self-ordering biological systems, such as S-layer-forming proteins.67
3. Development and validation of analytical and spectroscopic methods relying on thiol-capped CdTe NCs as a model system
At present, well established synthetic approaches provide monodisperse CdTe NCs ranging in size from 1.5 to 8 nm with precisely tunable optical spectra (e.g. PL maximum from 500 to 800 nm, respectively).4 This fact makes this kind of NCs a useful model system for development and testing of analytical and spectroscopic methods in terms of their application to nanometre-size objects. For example, although classical approaches are generally applicable to determination of PL QY of the NCs with organic dyes as certified standards,92,93 thorough study on size series of CdTe NCs showed that dynamic nature of the stabilizing shell influencing PL QY value should be additionally taken into consideration.93 Electrochemical studies on size series of CdTe94 and ZnSe(S)95 NCs constitute important steps towards developments of methods allowing to establish band energy diagrams for semiconductor NCs.94,96 Methods based on combination of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy with traditional ensemble optical spectroscopy techniques have been shown to be useful in studies of interactions of NCs with metal ions as well as aggregation and photoactivation of CdTe NCs induced by laser irradiation.97 Scanning electrochemical spectroscopy has been applied to study reactions between Ag+ and AuCl4− ions and LbL nanostructures based on CdTe NCs.98 CdTe NCs were further utilized as probing tool for the investigation of PL lifetimes of polyelectrolyte aggregates and their optical interactions with other components of thin films formed by LbL assembly.99 Finally, the derivative of CdTe NCs, their self-assembled strongly emitting nanowires were studied by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) allowing to observe remarkable changes in recombination kinetics for the entire nanowire network, along the single wires and at intercrossing and branching points (Fig. 4).100

4. Applications of thiol-capped semiconductor NCs

Light harvesting, energy transfer, and charge separation and transport. 
Recent years have seen an increasing use of thiol-capped semiconductor NCs as components of nano-architectures of different design where FRET takes place. Resonant energy transfer between optically active species is a well documented process.101 Major classes of hybrid FRET systems with semiconductor NCs as at least one component have recently been reviewed.102 Energy transfer between NCs of different sizes is not only of scientific interest, it may also be applied for light harvesting purposes. Investigations in this direction have mainly focused on engineering a unidirectional energy flow in multilayer architectures of NCs, with the excitation energy absorbed by layers containing smaller particles (donors) been concentrated in a single layer of the largest particles (acceptors).79 The LbL assembly technique which perfectly works for water-soluble thiol-capped NCs allows for easy fabrication of multilayer structures from NCs of different sizes.79,103,104 The use of water soluble CdTe NCs capped by either amino- or carboxyl-terminated short chain thiols allowed their direct assembly without the need for additional polymer linkers in between.105 Because of the resulting close proximity of the layers, energy transfer rates as fast as (50 ps)−1 were achieved. One-dimensional energy transfer along CdTe nanowires and nanowire networks has been demonstrated.77,106,107 An efficient energy transfer has been shown for artificial light harvesting complexes based on three-dimensional clusters of CdTe NCs of two or three distinctly different sizes electrostatically bound together by divalent calcium ions acting as chelating agents for oppositely charged particles.43A hybrid CdTe NC/bulk GaAs p–i–n heterostructure showed potential for efficient light harvesting photovoltaic devices.108 Photogenerated carriers in the highly absorbing NCs were efficiently transferred by means of nonradiative energy transfer to the patterned heterostructure possessing high carrier mobility and converted to electrical current. A three-fold enhancement of both photocurrent and monochromatic power conversion efficiency has been achieved.
Fuelled by the worldwide interest in photovoltaics, an increasing research effort in all-inorganic NC-based solar cells based on type II aligned structures is currently perceived.109 One example of type II band alignment is provided by the material combination CdSe and CdTe. A spectroscopic study of type II aligned CdTe and CdSe NCs held together by positively charged linker ions or polymer molecules has been conducted.110 Quenching and lifetime shortening of the band-edge emission were attributed to charge separation by electron tunneling from the CdTe to the CdSe NCs. Energy transfer and charge separation processes in type II hybrid organic–inorganic nanocomposites of thiol-capped CdTe NCs and blue-emitting conducting polymer have been analyzed in details.111
Yet another most likely configuration for use of semiconductor NCs in photovoltaics is the dye-sensitized solar cell112 with semiconductor NCs as sensitizer instead of or together with commonly used organic dyes.113 A nanocrystalline film of a wide band gap oxide semiconductor (i.e., TiO2) can be sensitized with II–VI NCs to visible light. Electrons generated in the NCs are injected into the oxide semiconductor while holes are removed by a redox couple in an electrolyte solution or by a solid hole transport material. For the design of such devices, it is very important to separately control the different steps of interfacial charge transfer of the photogenerated carriers. The effectiveness of electron injection from thiol-capped CdSe NCs into titanuim dioxide and subsequent back transfer has been evaluated by means of spectral dependent surface photovoltage measurements.114 An excellent correlation has been demonstrated between the optical and electrical determination of light absorption and carrier injection characteristics, respectively. The improvement of carrier extraction efficiency from CdSe NCs to ultrathin TiO2 layers by attaching the commonly used N3 Ruthenium dye molecules on the NCs has been demonstrated.115 N3 molecules effectively assisted the removal of holes from CdSe NC sensitizers, which is an essential step for highly efficient solar cell operation.


Bioimaging and biolabelling. 
The use of semiconductor NCs as fluorescent labels for biomedical applications, including imaging, labelling and sensing has seen an explosive growth in recent years.116–119 As fluorescent labels, NCs have several advantages over conventional organic dyes, including wide absorption profiles allowing excitation of various particles of different sizes simultaneously, large linear absorption cross sections, narrow emission spectra which are tunable by size and/or composition of NCs all through the visible spectral range up to the near-infrared, and better photostability. However, some applications, and in particular in vivo imaging may have limited applicability due to the cytotoxicity of NCs, which also applies to thiol-capped CdTe NCs discussed here. To date, biomedical studies have mainly utilized core/shell CdSe/ZnS NCs synthesized in organic solvents, which are hydrophobic as-prepared and have to be post-preparatively rendered water-soluble by creating additional shells which increases their size to 10–15 and even well above 25 nm.120 A useful alternative is to use particles directly synthesized in water, like brightly luminescent CdTe or CdxHg1−xTe NCs capped by short-chain thiols carrying different functional groups (carboxy-, amino-, etc.), which allow for their water solubility, compatibility with common buffers,121 and bioconjugation.10 This kind of NCs is naturally much smaller (2–8 nm) than particles synthesized in organics and transferred to water by creation of additional shells. Very importantly, both CdTe and CdxHg1−xTe NCs are available with emission in the near-infrared coinciding with the biological window of transmission,122 being thus promising optical probes for biomedical imaging in living tissue. Drug nanocarriers labeled with near-infrared emitting CdTe NCs (termed “quantoplexes” in analogy to widely used polyplexes) have demonstrated their ability of tracing bioactive compounds in living animals.123 Application of thiol-capped CdTe for cell imaging has recently been reviewed with a special emphasis given to mechanisms of photobleaching, PL lifetime shortening, and PL blue shift as consequences of NC interactions with biological media.124 Composites of CdTe NCs with sulfonated aluminium phtalocyanines have been shown to efficiently generate singlet oxygen, a reactive species playing an important role in biomedical applications.125,126 CdTe/CdS NCs capped with MPA and DHLA ortho-nitrobenzyl (ONB) derivatives possessing the ability to be switched on with external UV-light stimuli were suggested for use in bio-imaging experiments.127
A series of papers have addressed endocytosis of thiol-capped CdTe NCs by human cells.125,128 High content cell analysis, live cell fluorescent imaging, FLIM and transmission electron microscopy have been used to conduct a systematic study on the mechanism of interaction of thiol-capped CdTe NCs of different sizes with live human blood monocyte-derived primary macrophages and cell lines of phagocytic, epithelial and endothelial nature.129–131 Live human macrophages were shown to be able to rapidly take up and accumulate NCs in distinct cellular compartments (Fig. 5) specifically to their size and charge. CdTe NCs target histones in cell nuclei and nucleoli by a multistep process involving endocytosis, active cytoplasmic transport, and entering the nucleus via nuclear pore complexes. Size- and charge-selective nuclear delivery of CdTe NCs in human cells offers an outstanding potential for their use for bioimaging and therapeutics. Cytotoxicity probing and preventing issues for these NCs have been recently addressed.132–134

Among the number of drug-delivery systems developed up to date, polymer microcapsules made by LbL deposition of oppositely charged macromolecules on colloidal templates represent a versatile system possessing multiple functionalities in a single entity.135 The use of functionalized polymer capsules as drug carrier systems, microreactors, and sensors is envisaged.136 Labelling of capsules by luminescent CdTe NCs74 provides a possibility to trace their pathways within a tissue, whereas loading them with magnetic nanoparticles137 allows for manipulation by external magnetic field gradient. Magnetic drug targeting offers several attractive possibilities in biomedicine, allowing for the locoregional cancer treatment with reduced side effects. Magnetic targeting of polymer microcapsules simultaneously loaded with magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles and luminescent CdTe NCs has been demonstrated.138 By using a flow channel system for modeling the bloodstream in the circulatory system and by locally creating a magnetic field gradient caused by a permanent magnet, specific trapping of microcapsules, which causes a drastically increased uptake of capsules by cells as monitored by the luminescence of CdTe NCs has been achieved.


Sensing. 
The use of luminescent CdTe NCs as ion probes and pH sensors in aqueous solutions has been proposed.139 PL quenching of CdTe NCs has been used to determine traces of Fe2+ ions (detection limit of 5 nM) in their mixtures with Fe3+ ions.140 An electrochemical sensor for Mg2+ ions based on selective suppression of specific anodic peak in voltamperograms of CdTe NCs has been suggested.141 Electrostatically assembled hybrids of methylene blue and CdTe NCs were optically sensitive to targeted DNA through the reversible switching of photoinduced electron transfer processes.142 A new kind of biosensors consisting of a mixture of green and orange emitting CdTe NC-labeled chromatophores was established for rapid, simultaneous and independent detection of two different kinds of viruses.143 As an example of the practical application of covalently bound assemblies, the thermosensitive poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgel linked to MA-capped CdTe NCs can be mentioned. Due to the temperature dependent transition between collapsed and swollen states of the microgel (ca. 35 °C), the composite shows pronounced and reversible quenching/antiquenching fluorescence behavior.144 Such microsensors can be utilized for the monitoring of temperature changes in biological systems or in microfluidics.


Lighting. 
Direct use of thiol-capped NCs as emitting materials for light emission diodes (LEDs), although successful,145–147 still did not result in devices comparable in efficiency with state of the art III–V semiconductor or organic LEDs. Additional research on proper architectures, hole and electron injecting layers, as well as optimization of ambient stability is still necessary.148 Thiol-capped NCs may find application as active materials in light conversion layers for semiconductor LEDs,149 where white light quality is fulfilled by proper spectral design, e.g. tuning of color rendering index and color temperature. One of the recent examples in this respect is the heterostructure of LbL-assembled CdTe NCs of different sizes.150 Highly sensitive tuning of color chromaticity from (x, y) = (0.575, 0.424) to (0.632, 0.367) by precisely adjusting the energy transfer efficiency from donor NCs to acceptor NCs via controlling their interspacing has been demonstrated.

Conclusions and perspectives
Significant progress has been made during the last several years in the synthesis and surface design of thiol-capped water-soluble NCs. One particularly successful example are thiol-capped CdTe with extremely bright (40–80% room temperature QY) emission tunable to any desired wavelength in the spectral range of 500 to 800 nm, with an exceptionally flexible surface chemistry determined by an easy choice of functional thiol ligands. Thiol-capped CdTe NCs represent one of the most widely studied colloidal systems nowadays, offering them as a suitable model system for theoretical and experimental investigation of size-dependent phenomena, for establishing novel assembly and self-assembly approaches, for validation of analytical methods, and for design of proof-of-concept functional nanostructures and devices.
The basics of the aqueous synthesis which has been so successful for CdTe NCs has been adapted to produce different alloyed water soluble nanoparticles, which opens up additional perspectives in engineering materials with controlled electronic and optical properties, in particular with varying absolute energy values of conduction and valence bands for photovoltaic applications. The infrared-emitting thiol-capped NCs offer themselves for a broad variety of applications, from biological labeling to third generation solar cells. The possibility to control surface properties of thiol-capped NCs simply by choice of stabilizing thiol molecules with appropriate free functional groups used in the synthesis is extremely important, and has triggered a large variety of assembly methods resulting in hybrid functional nanostructures of increasing complexity. Light harvesting and directional energy transfer utilizing NCs is one particularly promising approach for the development of new concepts in hybrid photovoltaics and artificial photosynthetic systems. For biological applications, water soluble, extremely small NCs are often required, and this is the area of research where thiol-capped CdTe NCs emitting not only in the visible spectral range but also across the biological window of tissue transparency will find an important niche. Size- and charge-selective nuclear delivery of even non-functionalized NCs in human cells offers an outstanding potential for their use in bioimaging. In terms of the emission quantum yields and the emission spectral tunability of semiconductor NCs produced by the aqueous synthetic approach reviewed here and by the syntheses in organic solvents,151–154 both methods have been perfected nowadays to the grade where very strongly emitting NCs (up to 80% RT QY) with emission wavelength tunable from UV to near-infrared are available. This will secure plenty of applications for both light-emitting NC families ranging from photonics and optoelectronics to life sciences.
