    , Accepted 28th February 2012First published on 28th February 2012AbstractA hybrid quantum dot sensitized solar cell (QDSC) composed of CdSe quantum dots (QDs) as light harvesters and TiO2 and 3,3′′′-didodecyl-quaterthiophene (QT12) as electron and hole conductors, respectively, has been fully processed in air. The sensitizer has been introduced into the TiO2 nanoporous layer either by the successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction method or by attaching colloidal QDs either directly or through molecular cables (linkers). As previously observed for QDSCs based on liquid electrolytes, the efficiency depends on the way of QD attachment, the direct adsorption of QDs being the procedure yielding the best results. Thermal annealing was applied in order to enhance the device response under illumination. Remarkable open circuit potentials are attained (close to 1 V), leading to an efficiency of 0.34% (AM 1.5G) in initial tests. Although low, it ranks as one of the highest values reported for solid state QDSCs based on titanium dioxide and colloidal quantum dots.
Introduction
The potential advantages of using quantum dots (QDs) as light absorbers in sensitized solar cells have been described in several recent papers.1 Two properties that make them unique in this respect are the possibility of both tuning the band gap and taking advantage of the energy contained in hot electrons, for instance, via multiple exciton generation.2,3 In this respect, very recently Semonin et al. have demonstrated peak external photocurrent quantum efficiency at low enough wavelengths exceeding 100% in PbSe QD solar cells.4 These properties derive from the particular electronic structure brought about by size quantization. In addition, in most cases, the QDs present large extinction coefficients.5 These facts have triggered an intense research activity in QD sensitized photoanodes and solar cells, focused mainly on devices with liquid electrolytes, aqueous polysulfide being the most frequently employed.
On the other hand, the closely related dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are evolving toward all-solid-state designs in which the problematic liquid electrolyte6 is substituted by a solid-state Hole Transporting Material (HTM).7 Organic p-type semiconductors are suitable candidates, both in their polymeric and amorphous molecular forms, and exhibit better properties than their inorganic counterparts.8–10 As one of the main factors limiting the cell performance is the difficulty in the insertion of HTM into the mesoporous electron acceptor,10,11 the use of molecular materials can facilitate this task as shown in reports using the popular SpiroOMeTAD.12 Moreover, Zhang and coworkers have recently remarked other advantages of using conjugated oligomers as electron donors (easier purification, better structural definition and self-assembling abilities, etc).13
There are several studies dealing with solid-state semiconductor-sensitized solar cells. In some of them, the QDs are deposited by successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR).14 Such a procedure is simple and quite effective, but leads to a broad distribution of sizes and, probably, to a significant loss of quantization, which would preclude some of the advantages mentioned above. In other cases, a massive chemical bath deposit (CBD) of a small bandgap semiconductor is applied to the oxide, leading to a configuration close to that of an Extremely Thin Absorber (ETA) cell. In most of these cases, spiroOMeTAD has been used as a molecular Hole Transporting Material, achieving impressive conversion efficiencies.15
There is, however, very little work done with solid-state Quantum Dot Sensitized Solar Cells (QDSCs) prepared from colloids, although they should present both the practical benefits of a solid-state device and the possibility of taking advantage of quantization. The first report dates back from 2003, Zeng and co-workers prepared a cell based on InP quantum dots employing spiro-OMeTAD as hole transporting material, but low short circuit currents (0.035 mA cm−2) and open circuit potentials (0.4 V) were obtained under simulated solar light (58 mW cm−2).16 Günes et al., in addition to describing devices combining the concepts of a solid-state nanocrystal-sensitized solar cell and a nanocrystal–polymer-blend solar cell, presented a QDSC based on HgTe colloids, TiO2 nanoporous electrodes, and poly-(3-hexylthiophene) as a hole conducting polymer. They reported for this cell an open circuit voltage of 350 mV, a short circuit photocurrent of 0.8 mA cm−2 and a fill factor around 0.4.17 In 2009, Kniprath et al. reported results (Voc = 1–1.15 V, jph = 0.05–0.10 mA cm−2; η = 0.020%) on a solid state QDSC based on CdSe QDs and a conjugated polymer poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-N-(4-butylenphenyl)diphenylamine) as hole transporting material.18 Very recently, a cell consisting of CdSe QDs, ZnO nanocolumns as electron conducting phase and P3HT as HTM has delivered a short circuit current of 0.14 mA cm−2 and an open circuit voltage of 0.5 V, but with a quite low fill factor.19 Finally, Snaith et al. have demonstrated significant currents with a cell prepared from colloidal PbS QDs deposited on nanoporous SnO2 and infiltrated with Spiro-OMeTAD. Efficiencies over 0.5% under simulated solar light have been reported with relatively low open circuit voltages (up to 0.5 V).20
Good power conversion efficiencies (η) and long-term stabilities have been usually reported for solid-state hybrid solar cells fabricated under controlled atmospheres,20–23 although some exceptions have been presented.15 As previously observed in luminescent and bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic devices,24,25 the organic semiconductor is extensively doped in the presence of atmospheric oxygen, degrading dramatically the performance of the cells. Nevertheless, if one pursues to benefit from low-cost solution-based procedures for printing thin film HTMs in solid-state designs, it would be highly desirable to avoid the use of expensive sterile facilities that elevate the overall costs of production. Solution-processable and regioregular 3,3′′′-dialkyl-quaterthiophenes (QTs) have shown good performance when casted in air, without further precautions, as thin film transistors (TFTs)26 and in a few precedent bulk heterojunction solar cells.27,28 Their unsubstituted thienylene moieties induce a deviation from coplanarity along the main oligomer chain due to a certain level of rotational freedom. It cuts the π-conjugation providing enough oxidative stability (ionization potential around 0.4 eV higher than for regioregular P3HT)29 but still good functionality. The structural regularity and length of the alkyl side chains facilitate solution processability and molecular self-assembly leading to long-range order in the condensed phase (lamellar π-stacking structures oriented normal to the substrate have been previously observed for polymeric and oligomeric forms of QTs).30 In addition, QTs are relatively cheaper than other molecular HTMs tested with success in QDSCs, such as SpiroOMeTAD.
In this paper, we test the performance of all-solid-state QDSCs fully processed in air incorporating a model 3,3′′′-didodecyl-quaterthiophene (QT12) as HTM. For this purpose TiO2/CdSe/QT films deposited on F-doped tin oxide (FTO) were sandwiched to FTO/pTPA samples31 acting as counterelectrodes. The effects of different modes of QD attachment32 and thermal annealing on the performance of these photovoltaic devices are also explored in this paper.
Experimental
Nanoporous TiO2 electrodes were fabricated using commercial TiO2 P25 nanoparticles, by doctor blading an aqueous suspension on a compact TiO2 blocking layer (BL) previously deposited on FTO, and sintering at 450 °C. The TiO2 films (about 3 μm in thickness) were sensitized with CdSe QDs grown in situ by SILAR or using presynthesized QDs capped with trioctylphosphine (TOP). For the SILAR method, the TiO2 electrodes were dipped in a 0.5 M Cd(CH3COO)2 aqueous solution. Afterwards, they were rinsed in a 1 M sodium acetate solution and subsequently dipped in a selenosulfate solution33 of pH 8. To complete the cycle, the substrates were immersed anew in the sodium acetate solution to remove the excess of reactants in the pores. This set of steps was repeated several times (referred to as number of cycles in the text) to increase the amount of deposited CdSe QDs. On the other hand, the presynthesized TOP-capped CdSe QDs were prepared using a solvothermal route.34 For the adsorption of these QDs through a linker, a molecular wire, either cysteine or 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) was previously adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface by immersion in the corresponding organic solution for one day. After a thorough wash, the mesoporous TiO2 electrodes were immersed in the toluene CdSe colloidal solution. For direct adsorption, the synthesized QDs were dispersed in CH2Cl2, where the TiO2 electrodes were immersed. In the case of presynthesized QDs, the coverage degree was controlled by the adsorption time.
The sensitized TiO2 samples were dipped in an ethanolic 0.1 M tetraethyl orthosilicate solution and annealed in air at 60 °C for 2 h to grow a thin SiO2 layer.35 Such a layer has shown the ability of passivating both the TiO2 and the CdSe surface toward recombination. The FTO/BL/TiO2/CdSe/SiO2 samples were immersed in a toluene solution containing 3,3′′′-didodecyl-quaterthiophene (QT12) and 4-tert-butylpyridine. Afterwards, QT12 was deposited by spin coating a concentrated solution in toluene (20 mg mL−1). The FTO/BL/TiO2/CdSe/SiO2/QT12 samples were subjected to a thermal treatment in air. A solution of 0.2 M bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) and 0.2 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (4-TBP) in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trisfluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ionic liquid (EMimTFSI) was drop-casted on the samples. After 24 h, the ionic liquid was wiped off using a soft laboratory paper. Finally, the QDSCs were assembled just by clamping the photoanode and the HTM with the counter electrode. The latter was a highly doped polytriphenylamine (pTPA) layer deposited on FTO. The TPA thin film was previously deposited on FTO by spin coating and electropolymerized in the solid state in a 0.5 M LiClO4 aqueous solution. Photocurrent–voltage characteristics were measured with a microAutolab III (Eco-Chemie) potentiostat. A solar simulator (Sun 2000-11018 from Abet Technologies) calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G) was used as a light source. The illuminated area of the cells was set to 0.1 cm2 using a mask. Absorption–reflectance spectra were obtained with a Shimadzu UV-2401PC spectrophotometer equipped with an integrating sphere. Emission spectra were measured by means of a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer. For some of these experiments, porous ZrO2 films supported on FTO and modified with directly adsorbed, presynthesized CdSe QDs were used. The ZrO2 films were prepared similarly to the porous TiO2 films, using an aqueous slurry based on commercial nanoparticles (Tecnan) and by sintering at 500 °C in air.
Results and discussion
The solid state cell introduced in this work possesses the following structure:
FTO/BL/TiO2/CdSe QDs/SiO2/QT12/pTPA/FTO
The light absorbers are CdSe QDs attached to a nanoporous TiO2 thin film as electron conducting phase. The hole conducting phase is constituted by a QT12 layer, while the hole collector electrode was FTO conducting glass with a buffer layer of electrosynthesized pTPA. While the combination of CdSe QDs with TiO2 supported on conducting glass is classical for the internal electron pathway, the elements of the internal hole pathway are novel. In the following, we show the rationale for this aspect of the cell architecture.

Fig. 1 shows visible absorption and emission spectra for ZrO2 thin films modified with directly adsorbed colloidal CdSe QDs and QT12. For the sake of comparison, the absorption and emission spectra for the QD colloidal dispersion (capping agent: trioctylphosphine, TOP) are also given. The excitation wavelength (500 nm) for the emission spectra was chosen in order to selectively photoexcite the QDs and not the QT12. As observed, the adsorption of CdSe QDs on the nanoparticulate ZrO2 film does not trigger quenching of its emission due to the fact that the CdSe QDs are not able to inject photogenerated electrons in this oxide and radiative recombination is predominant. However, upon the introduction of QT12 into the film, a drastic quenching of the emission occurs (the fluorescence intensity is reduced by a factor of 5–6), indicating that the holes are efficiently transferred to the organic HTM. It is worth noting that Zaban and co-workers have reported electron injection from CdSe QDs into ZrO2.36 They assume that in the presence of certain potential determining ions, the QD energy levels could shift upward with respect to those of ZrO2, making possible electron injection into the oxide. The proposed mechanism would require an electrochemical environment or, at least, the presence of potential determining ions, which is not the case for the photoluminescence quenching experiments done in air.

(C) Emission spectra (excitation wavelength: 500 nm) for a thin film of ZrO2 supported on conducting glass modified with directly adsorbed CdSe QDs with/without a spin-coated layer of QT12. 
The relatively small size of the QT12 molecule together with its dodecyl chains presumably allows for its effective blend with the TOP capping agent molecules (through their octyl chains). This would allow the QT12 molecules to approach the QD surface with the chain of thiophene rings in a perpendicular orientation, which should be favorable to facilitate hole injection and hinder subsequent recombination. In this context, it is remarkable that Milliron et al. observed a similar quenching in the emission band of the CdSe QDs when using oligothiophene molecules containing phosphonic acid groups in a molar concentration at least 50 times that of the QDs.37 The phosphonic acid group was supposed to facilitate the displacement of the insulator TOPO capping molecules. Similarly, substantial photoluminiscence quenching has been reported in layer-by-layer thin films constituted by sexithiophene molecules containing carboxylate groups and hexadecylamine-capped CdSe nanoparticles.38 In contrast, the fluorescence quenching observed in our case did not require the modification of the quaterthiophene molecule. The displacement of TOP capping molecules by the unmodified QT12 seems to be unlikely in this case, which points to an adequate self-assembly of QT12 and TOP through hydrophobic intermolecular interactions among the alkyl chains of these species.

Fig. 2 shows the voltammetric response of a QT12 film in a 0.5 M NaClO4 aqueous solution. The onset potential for the oxidation of QT12 gives approximately the value of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO) energy level, which, in electron potential energy, scales to −5.53 eV. Fig. 2 also shows the voltammetric response of pTPA in the same solution as for QT12. Importantly, the oxidation onset is located around 0.1 V less positive than in the case of QT12 and, therefore, the valence band for pTPA would be located at −5.43 eV, that is, 0.1 eV less negative than the QT12 HOMO level. The UV-vis spectra given for pTPA in our previous report31 and for QT12 (in the ESI†) allow us to estimate the HOMO–LUMO difference as 3.26 and 2.76 eV, respectively. On the other hand, the conduction band of TiO2 (at the isoelectric point) has been located at −4.2 eV.39 Kamat and co-workers reported an energy difference between the Conduction Band (CB) edges of TiO2 and MPA-capped CdSe QDs of approximately −0.55 eV for CdSe particles with an excitonic peak at around 570 nm.40 Considering the TiO2 CB edge energy (−4.2 eV), this result allows us to locate the CB edge of CdSe QDs at −3.65 eV. Taking into account the band gap energy value reported for these CdSe QDs (2.18 eV), their Valence Band (VB) edge would be placed at −5.83 eV. All these pieces of information have been used to depict the approximate band diagram shown in Scheme 1. Admittedly, there is some ambiguity in the reported values of the different energy levels because the formation of interfaces leads to changes in their position as a consequence of charge and dipole redistribution. We do not claim that the values in Scheme 1 are absolute and highly accurate, but they should serve to rationalize the design in a semiquantitative way.

It is apparent, from the position of the energy levels for the different materials (in a staircase arrangement), that the vectorial transport of electrons and holes in the cell is favored. The difference between the HOMO levels of QT12 and pTPA is only 0.1 eV. Probably, the transfer of holes from QT to pTPA is favored by charge delocalization in the polymer, thus limiting detrimental carrier recombination. Importantly, the maximum open circuit voltage of such a device would be as high as 1.23 V, which evidences its potential of application if significant values of short circuit photocurrent and fill factor can be achieved. The optical bandgap for QT12 has a value of 2.76 eV and can therefore be excited by solar light. This photoexcitation could also contribute to the photocurrent generation with electron injection into the TiO2 nanoporous thin film, either directly or mediated by the CdSe QD layer.
The selectivity of the contacts is crucial in this type of devices. For instance, the employment of buffer layers is routinary in the design of organic solar cells.41 No holes are either produced or transported in the TiO2 nanoporous layer. In addition, the usage of a blocking layer should, in principle, avoid an eventual transfer of holes to the conducting glass. In this way, electrons would be equilibrated between the TiO2 and the FTO layer of the conducting glass (the quasi-Fermi level of electrons in the TiO2 would be equal to the Fermi level of FTO under illumination). The same ideas underlie the usage of a pTPA layer on the FTO hole collecting electrode. As observed in the diagram, the eventual passage of photogenerated electrons to the FTO would be avoided by the low electron affinity of pTPA. In addition, the transport of holes in the pTPA layer would be favored. In fact, in a previous report, we showed that a pTPA layer on conducting glass acts as a p-type material as demostrated by the sign of the open circuit potential (OCP) change caused by illumination with a Xe arc lamp.31 The fast and significant OCP change observed in that work would also indicate an efficient electronic communication between the FTO and the pTPA, as well as the poor characteristic of pTPA as electron transporting material. In this way, equilibration of the quasi-Fermi level for the holes in the pTPA and the Fermi level of the FTO is possible.

Fig. 3 shows the I–V curves recorded under illumination (1 sun, AM1.5G) for solid-state QDSCs in which the attachment of the QDs has been done in different ways. Both in situ synthesized and colloidal QDs have been employed as sensitizers. In the case of colloidal QDs, their attachment to the TiO2 matrix was done either by direct adsorption or by the use of linker molecules such as mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) or cysteine.
 Fig. 3  Current density–voltage curves and conversion efficiency vs. (100-reflectance % at 550 nm) plots for QDSCs sensitized with different QD loadings deposited by SILAR (a and b) and linker-assisted (mercaptopropionic acid, e and f; and cysteine, g and h) or direct adsorption (c and d) of colloidal quantum dots. The amount of QDs was controlled either by the number of SILAR cycles or through the adsorption time in the other cases. The cells were illuminated with simulated solar radiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). The insets in b, d, f and h present UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the corresponding sensitized anodes (FTO/BL/TiO2/CdSe/SiO2). The FTO/BL/TiO2/CdSe/SiO2/QT12 assemblies were annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes, and were casted with an ionic liquid (0.2 M t-BP and 0.2 M LiTFSI in EmIL) for 24 h in the dark. Freshly prepared FTO/poly-TPA counterelectrodes were used in all cases. 
It is remarkable that these results were obtained after a thermal annealing process consisting in heating in air the FTO/BL/TiO2/SiO2/QT12 assembly to temperatures ranging between 60 and 180 °C and times ranging between 10 and 120 min. The effect of the temperature was more important than that of time, the optimum conditions being 10 min and 80 °C. All the parameters characteristic of the cell improved after the thermal annealing, the short circuit photocurrent being particularly sensitive, which increased by 65% (see ESI†). The experiments shown in Fig. 3 were performed after subjecting the cell to the optimized thermal annealing, which was applied with the aim of inducing a better assembly of π-stacks in the QT12 condensed phase. In fact, several groups have reported enhancement in the performance of BHJ solar cells based on P3HT and other polymers upon annealing at moderate temperatures.14,42 For instance, Vanlaeke et al. correlated this improvement to an increase in the ordering and crystallinity of the P3HT solid phase.24 In the present case, one should take into account that QT12 has a melting point slightly lower than 60 °C. Therefore annealing at 80 °C should provoke the melting of the organic material, which would increase in a drastic way its mobility and facilitate its penetration throughout the nanoporous structure. This should induce a better assembly of the QT12 oligomers into an ordered crystalline phase and, thus, a higher photocurrent, as both the extraction of the holes from the QDs and their subsequent transport through the QT12 layer would be favored.
In all the cases presented in Fig. 3, the efficiency is maximum at an optimum loading (values of 100 − R% ranging between 80 and 90% depending on the way of attachment).32 Beyond that value, a significant decrease in efficiency was observed. In any case, better performances are obtained when using colloidal dispersions of CdSe QDs, the direct adsorption methodology being the one yielding the best results. The I–V curves corresponding to the best response for each sensitization method are depicted in Fig. 4 (the corresponding parameters are tabulated in the ESI†). The fact that systematic trends are observed in four series of experiments employing different QD attachment modes indicates that the degree of reproducibility is relatively high. Freshly prepared FTO/pTPA counterelectrodes were employed in all cases. The degradation of the cell operation parameters is mainly related to the dedoping of the pTPA thin film (see ESI†).
 Fig. 4  Effect of the mode of attachment of the CdSe QDs on cell performance. The inset presents the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (transformed according with Kubelka Munk function) obtained for each photoanode. The results correspond to the optimized solar cells shown in Fig. 3. 
It is remarkable that the open circuit voltages (Voc) of the devices giving the best response attain values ranging from 0.95 to 0.99 V. If we consider all the devices whose I–V curves are given in Fig. 3, the Voc varies between 0.9 and 1.0 V. These values are relatively high and demonstrate an adequate choice of materials, allowing for an efficient charge separation without compromising the value of Voc. Taking into account that the maximum theoretical voltage on the basis of the data summarized in Scheme 1 is 1.23 V, these results suggest that there is, in fact, equilibration of the quasi-Fermi levels for electrons and holes in the device with the Fermi level in the collecting FTO electrodes. Fig. 3 also indicates that the limited cell efficiency comes from the low values obtained for both photocurrent and fill factor. The values of a fill factor do not depend strongly on the attachment mode. Dark I–V curves (see ESI†) evidence that the cells show, under reverse bias, large values of non-ohmic leakage currents. These shunt currents likely result from the existence of pinholes in the TiO2 blocking layer deposited on the FTO thin film, allowing for the injection of electrons from the QT12 molecules. In an indirect way, this demonstrates that the penetration of the QT12 molecules through the nanoporous layer is very effective as they end up being in close contact with the FTO layer.
On the other hand, large differences are observed in the short circuit photocurrent. These differences are not directly connected with different degrees of light harvesting in the cell. It is apparent that the cells prepared with the SILAR method have a performance much lower than that of the cells prepared from colloidal QDs in spite of the fact that light harvesting is much more efficient (see the inset in Fig. 4). This behavior seems to be at odds with previous reports of solid-state QDSCs in which SILAR or other chemical bath methods are systematically employed. The reasons for this could be linked to the intrinsic limitations of the relatively thick SILAR deposits, in which the relatively large distance between the sensitizer and the electron transporting phase, together with the existence of multiple surface and interfacial traps, enhances recombination. This would be particularly critical if hole extraction is not efficient as a consequence, for instance, of insufficient QT12 penetration. Otherwise, the better performance of the cells based on colloidal QDs could be linked to the hydrophobicity that the TOP capping agent impart to the colloidal QDs. One should expect a strong interaction between the long alkylic chains in both the capping agent and the QT12 molecule, which would help anchor effectively the quantum dots and the QT12 molecule in spite of the fact that the latter does not contain any head group with high affinity for the CdSe surface. The fact that direct adsorption is more effective than linker-assisted attachment may be simply related to the fact that the optimum corresponds to a higher QD loading. In any case, previous research with liquid-electrolyte QDSCs and TiO2/CdSe thin films in air indicate that direct adsorption implies a smaller distance between an electron donor and acceptor and an increased rate for electron injection as demonstrated by studying the ultrafast dynamics of photogenerated carriers.43 The electron injection rate was demonstrated to correlate with the performance of the photoanode for liquid-electrolyte QDSCs. As observed in Fig. 4, similar results were obtained when using MPA or cysteine as linker. However, cells employing cysteine as a linker show behavior slightly better in terms of photocurrent, although the optimum QD loading is smaller than when MPA is used as a linker. Therefore, the behavior of the photoanode depends not only on the QD coverage but also on the linker nature.43
In a general vein, our studies with QDSCs demonstrate that direct adsorption of colloidal quantum dots still has potential for application in both liquid-electrolyte and solid-state QDSCs, particularly if suitable ways to ensure a high coverage in the oxide matrix are found. From a more fundamental point of view, similar tendencies are observed for photoanodes used in either liquid or solid-state environments as long as recombination is not largely enhanced, as would be the case for the SILAR deposit in the solid-state QDSC.
It is expected that much better results could be found by changing some of the elements of the cell, and particularly the different interfaces. In this way, changing the morphology of the TiO2 matrix by employing one-dimensional nano-objects, changing the particle size and/or introducing a dispersive layer could help both increase light harvesting and fill the pores with QT12. Improving the compactness of the BL at the photoanode should help suppress the shunt currents and increase the fill factor. Conditioning the interface between the QDs and the QT12 by including surface dipoles or functional groups in the QT12 strongly anchored with the QDs, as well as optimizing the quaterthiophene alkyl chain length, may also lead to an improvement in the rate of hole transfer to the HTM.44 Very recently, it has been shown that engineering the interface between the inorganic sensitizer and the HTM as to ensure an intimate contact between them is a key factor in the fabrication of high-efficiency semiconductor sensitized solar cells.45 In the same way, employing other oligothiophenes and/or inducing in situ solid-state polymerization of the QT12 and/or using other ionic liquid could be alternative ways to improve hole mobility in the HTM. It is finally important to find ways to make more stable the hole-collector electrode as the degradation in the cell performance is mainly associated to the de-doping of the pTPA film.
Conclusions
In summary, the great potentialities of using dialkylquaterthiophenes as molecular HTMs in CdSe-based all solid-state QDSCs have been unveiled. A maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.34% has been obtained using QT12 processed in air and employing directly adsorbed TOP-capped CdSe colloids. Colloidal quantum dots give rise to cells with superior output parameters than SILAR deposits. Furthermore, anchoring the QDs by means of molecular linkers gives lower efficiencies than direct QD adsorption, which agrees with the previous work with liquid electrolyte-based QDSCs.32,43 The cells present low photocurrents but remarkable values of open circuit potential, between 0.9 and 1 V, which indicates an appropriate band engineering of the device and gives room to future significant improvement. This could be achieved through the investigation of other linear (or 3D) thiophene oligomers (eventually including functional groups strongly anchored with the QDs),8 TiO2 morphologies (nanotubes, nanowires, etc.), more stable counterelectrodes, chemical treatments to enhance carrier mobilities, etc.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (A) UV-Vis absorption and emission (excitation wavelength: 500 nm) spectra for a dispersion of CdSe QDs (diameter: 3.4 nm) in CH2Cl2. (B) Absorption spectra for a thin film of ZrO2 supported on conducting glass modified or not with directly adsorbed CdSe QDs and with a QT12 layer deposited by spin-coating. (C) Emission spectra (excitation wavelength: 500 nm) for a thin film of ZrO2 supported on conducting glass modified with directly adsorbed CdSe QDs with/without a spin-coated layer of QT12.	 

 	Fig. 2  Voltammetric curves in a N2-purged 0.5 M NaClO4 aqueous solution, corresponding to thin solid films of QT12 (1st cycle) and pTPA supported on conducting glass. Scan rate: 20 mV s−1.	 

 	Scheme 1  Sketch describing the FTO/TiO2/CdSe/QT12/p-TPA/FTO photovoltaic device architecture. A simplified band structure is presented.	 

 	Fig. 3  Current density–voltage curves and conversion efficiency vs. (100-reflectance % at 550 nm) plots for QDSCs sensitized with different QD loadings deposited by SILAR (a and b) and linker-assisted (mercaptopropionic acid, e and f; and cysteine, g and h) or direct adsorption (c and d) of colloidal quantum dots. The amount of QDs was controlled either by the number of SILAR cycles or through the adsorption time in the other cases. The cells were illuminated with simulated solar radiation of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5G). The insets in b, d, f and h present UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra of the corresponding sensitized anodes (FTO/BL/TiO2/CdSe/SiO2). The FTO/BL/TiO2/CdSe/SiO2/QT12 assemblies were annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes, and were casted with an ionic liquid (0.2 M t-BP and 0.2 M LiTFSI in EmIL) for 24 h in the dark. Freshly prepared FTO/poly-TPA counterelectrodes were used in all cases.	 

 	Fig. 4  Effect of the mode of attachment of the CdSe QDs on cell performance. The inset presents the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra (transformed according with Kubelka Munk function) obtained for each photoanode. The results correspond to the optimized solar cells shown in Fig. 3.
