    , Accepted 10th October 2019First published on 10th October 2019AbstractPNTz4T-based polymers have been extensively employed in high-efficiency fullerene-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of approximately 10.0% due to the high crystallinity of these polymers. The introduction of two fluorine atoms into PNTz4T to synthesize the PNTz4T-2F polymer has boosted the PCE to 10.6%, but the introduction of four fluorine atoms to synthesize the PNTz4T-4F polymer negatively affects the efficiency (PCE = 6.5%), implying that the number of fluorine atoms is not yet optimized. We have developed a new synthetic route for a novel monofluoro-bithiophene monomer and successfully synthesized a novel PNTz4T-1F polymer. The fullerene-based PSCs based on our novel PNTz4T-1F polymer processed using a halogen-free solvent system demonstrated an outstanding PCE of 11.77% (11.67% certified), representing the highest PCE reported thus far in the literature. Due to the optimum molecular ordering/packing, improved interaction with PC71BM and interconnectivity between photoactive material domains, PNTz4T-1F-based PSCs exhibit lower charge carrier recombination and enhanced charge carrier mobility levels, leading to a substantially high photocurrent density (20.37 mA cm−2). These results create new means to tune the structural properties of polymers, ultimately leading to the realization of this class of solar cells for practical applications.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction polymer solar cells (BHJ PSCs) consisting of electron donor polymers with [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) fullerene-based electron acceptors emerged a couple of decades ago, and the power conversion efficiency (PCEs) has since been improved by an order of magnitude.1–6 Fullerene-based PSCs are emerging slowly but steadily as an alternative energy source for niche applications beyond existing conventional solar energy markets owing to their distinct advantages, including their low cost, more environmentally friendly raw materials, light weight, good green-solvent processability and easy integration with already established industrial-scale roll-to-roll (R2R) fabrication techniques.6–10
In recent years, several non-fullerene acceptor (NFA)-based PSCs have rapidly evolved, with some being able to outperform fullerene-based devices due to their excellent chemical tunability.11–13 The PCEs of binary and ternary single-junction NFA-PSCs currently exceed 16%, while the best-performing fullerene-based PSCs exhibit up to 11.7%.14–18 Furthermore, NFAs possess the feature of being employed in semi-transparent and even fully transparent solar cells due to their high-transparency characteristics in the visible region by structural modifications of NFAs.19–21 Despite the considerable effort made thus far to optimize the optoelectronic, energetic, and charge carrier transport/recombination properties of high-efficiency NFA-PSCs, fullerene-based acceptors remain as the exclusive electron acceptors for commercially available PSCs. The dominance of the fullerene-based PSC research landscape stems from the major advantage of high electron mobility levels to transport electrons in three dimensions due to the delocalized lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) over the entire surface of the molecule, leading to broad tolerance of the photoactive layer thickness.22,23 Another advantage of fullerene-based PSCs is their environmentally friendly processes due to the use of non-halogenated solvents with sufficiently high boiling points exceeding those of NFA-PSCs owing to the favorable morphological properties.23–28 As noted above, good photoactive layer thickness tolerance and green-solvent processability with high boiling points of photoactive materials are critical factors to realize cost-effective and scalable R2R manufacturing for the commercialization of PSCs with a low environmental impact. Although recent breakthroughs in the PCE have revitalized the field of NFA-PSCs, extensive research on high-efficiency fullerene-based PSCs suitable for high-throughput R2R production should be dedicated to the design of novel polymer donors to make the commercialization of PSCs viable.
For molecular design strategies of fullerene-based PSCs, fluorination of electron donor polymers is an effective means of (1) tuning their molecular energy levels, (2) achieving favorable molecular ordering/packing, (3) optimizing the bulk morphological properties, (4) controlling the aggregation behavior, (5) improving the charge carrier mobility levels, (6) and developing a fibrillar network.29–35 All of these parameters help to improve the PCE of fullerene-based PSCs. Stuart et al. substituted fluorine into the electron-deficient benzodithiazole (BT) unit in the polymer backbone and systematically showed that fluoro-substitution lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level almost linearly.30 By varying the number and topology of fluorine atoms, Ko et al. designed and successfully tuned wide-bandgap polymers which showed strong interchain interactions.35 Kawashima et al. probed the significance of fluorine atoms in naphthobisthiadiazole (NT)-based donor polymers and found that fluorine atoms not only affect the electronic properties but also play a vital role in determining the charge recombination and molecular ordering/packing in PSCs.29 Moreover, Lee et al. found that di-fluoro substitution in NT-based polymers leads to the formation of polymer nanowires inside the photoactive film with a preferential face-on orientation to facilitate charge transport as well as reduce charge carrier recombination.36 Therefore, the control and optimization of fluorine atoms in the donor polymer backbone are of prime importance in PSCs.
Morphological characterization of the photoactive layers of the BHJ PSCs provides numerous types of information, including data related to phase separation between the polymer donor and fullerene-based acceptor and their interconnectivities, the presence of nanowire or fibril-like frameworks, and the charge carrier transfer/transport/recombination properties, among other types.29–32,37–44 Improvement of the interfacial area between the polymer donor and fullerene acceptor and their enhanced interconnectivity with the formation of nano-fibril percolation pathways,45–47 and quantification of the domain distribution throughout bulk photoactive films can be realized with 3D electron tomography based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM).45–51 The sufficient condition for efficient charge transfer and transport to ensure a high photocurrent can be met in different ways: (1) the formation of nano-fibrils on the order of tens of nanometers (nm),39,40,52 (2) an enhancement of the interconnectivity between the polymer and PC71BM domains, and (3) sufficient planarity of the polymer backbone. We speculated that the monofluoro-bithiophene-based polymer PNTz4T-1F {poly[naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole)-5,10-diyl]-alt-[(3,3′′′-bis(2-decyltetradecyl)-3′′-fluoro-2,2′:5′,2′′:5′′,2′′′-quaterthiophene)-5, 5′′′-diyl]} with an optimum number of fluorine atoms could result in an improved fibril structure and better interconnectivity and planarity between the polymer donors and PC71BM acceptors, which may enhance the charge carrier output and thus the PCE. Furthermore, because halogen-free solvent processing is a highly desirable option for practical roll-to-roll (R2R) fabrication due to the environmental friendliness of this process,53,54 we employed a halogen-free solvent system here, in this case o-xylene (xyl) with diphenyl ether (DPE) for the fabrication of highly efficient fullerene-based PSCs.
Results and discussion
Material synthesis and properties
A novel synthesis route is employed to synthesize monomer 8 [3-fluoro-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-2,2′-bithiophene] and therefore the polymer (Scheme 1). 5,5′-Bis(trimethyltin)-2,2′-bithiophene and 5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)3,3′-difluoro-2,2′-bithiophene are synthesized according to a method in the literature.43 Monomer 8 is synthesized in six steps using simple 2,2′-bithiophene as a starting material. First, the bromination of bithiophene is carried out in NBS (N-bromosuccinimide) reagent to obtain compound 2 (3,5,5′-tribromo-2,2′-bithiophene). Selective debromination from the 5,5′-position of monomer 2 is carried out in trimethylsilyl chloride to realize compound 3 [3-bromo-5,5′-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′-bithiophene] with one bromine being still intact at the 3-position. The bromine atom at the 3-position of monomer 3 is substituted with a fluorine atom of NFSI (N-fluorodibenzenesulfonimide) under basic conditions using n-BuLi. Compound 4 [3-fluoro-5,5′-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′-bithiophene] was obtained as a major product (yield ∼95%) and compound 5 [5,5′-bis(trimethylsilyl)-2,2′-bithiophene] was obtained as a minor product (yield ∼5%). Selective desilylation is further carried out in two steps: first, compound 4 was treated under basic conditions with K2CO3 to obtain compound 6 (3-fluoro-5′-trimethylsilyl-2,2′-bithiophene; Fig. S23, see ESI†). The second step involved treating compound 6 in TBAF (tetrabutylammonium fluoride) to obtain compound 7 (3-fluoro-2,2′-bithiophene; Fig. S24, see ESI†). Finally, a stannylated form of compound 7 is obtained by using lithium diisopropyl amide (LDA) and trimethyl-tin-chloride to obtain pure monomer 8 [3-fluoro-5,5′-bis(trimethyltin)-2,2′-bithiophene, Fig. S25 and S26, see ESI†], referred to as monofluoro-bithiophene later in the text. All polymers are synthesized via the Stille coupling of 5,10-bis(5-bromo-4-(2-decyltetradecyl)thiophen-2-yl)naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]thiadiazole) and three corresponding bithiophene monomers using the Pd2dba3/P(o-tolyl)3 catalytic system in a microwave reactor (Scheme 1). The molecular weight and polydispersity index (PDI) of the polymers are characterized by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) in chloroform with polystyrene as a standard. The summarized molecular weight of the polymer series in Table 1 indicates that the number average molecular weights (Mn) and weight average molecular weights (Mw) are enhanced when more F-atoms are attached onto the backbone. The low MW of PNTz4T-2F stems from the fact that the highly aggregated polymers are less soluble in organic solvents and are partly screened during the filtration process.29 All three polymers, PNTz4T, PNTz4T-1F and PNTz4T-2F, showed very good thermal stability when subjected to a thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), exhibiting 5% weight loss at 422 °C, 418 °C and 418 °C, respectively (Fig. S1a†). Furthermore, the melting temperature (Tm) and crystallization temperature (Tc) peaks for PNTz4T appeared at 319 °C and 296 °C, respectively, while the Tm peak shifted towards a higher temperature for PNTz4T-1F, i.e., 345 °C, with a broad Tc peak at 335 °C in a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (Fig. S1b†). However, the PNTz4T-2F polymer did not show any transition peak between 30 °C and 350 °C. It is important to note that both melting and crystallization peaks shift to higher temperatures as the number of fluorine substitutions increases, which is attributed to enhanced polymer backbone rigidity with fluorination.

The UV-vis absorption behavior of a series of polymers in the solution and film states shows one energy absorption band due to the π–π* transition around 400–500 nm and one additional band due to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) around 650–750 nm in the polymer backbone (Fig. 1a and b). The absorption maximum (λmax) position of the PNTz4T polymer in the film state did not change with respect to that of the solution state, while the PNTz4T-1F polymer exhibited a red-shift of 6 nm and the PNTz4T-2F polymer showed a red-shift of 12 nm in the peak position in the film state with respect to that in the solution state (Fig. 1b). This can be ascribed to the higher aggregation behavior of the PNTz4T polymer in the solution due to the strong intermolecular interaction,29 while the λmax peak shifts in the fluorinated polymers suggest that the intermolecular interactions are stronger in the film state as compared to the solution state. Additionally, all of the polymers in the solution and film states showed a 0–1 vibronic shoulder peak (Fig. 1a and b), while the absorption coefficient of the PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM blend films with an optimized thickness (Fig. 1c) demonstrated noticeably higher absorption in the entire absorption range compared to other photoactive layers. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to determine the onset of the oxidation potential of the PNTz4T, PNTz4T-1F and PNTz4T-2F polymer films (Fig. S1c†), which was found to be 0.39 V, 0.49 V and 0.60 V, respectively. The HOMO energy levels downshifted gradually with the number of fluorine atoms: PNTz4T (−5.19 eV) > PNTz4T-1F (−5.29 eV) > PNTz4T-2F (−5.40 eV). From the onset of the absorption wavelength (λmax) of the polymers (PNTz4T = 784 nm, PNTz4T-1F = 779 nm, PNTz4T-2F = 777 nm), the LUMO energy levels were determined to be −3.61 eV, −3.70 eV and −3.81 eV, respectively.55 As the number of fluorine atoms is increased, both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels are downshifted almost linearly, as shown in the energy level diagram of the devices in Fig. 1d and Table 1.

Structural analysis by density functional theory (DFT)
The DFT (B3LYP fine) calculations were employed to determine the frontier energy levels and molecular conformations of the polymer series. The HOMO/LUMO energy levels are calculated from DFT, i.e., −5.083/−3.052 eV, −5.181/−3.113 eV and −5.202/−3.101 eV for the PNTz4T, PNTz4T-1F and PNTz4T-2F polymers, respectively, in agreement with their CV and UV-vis absorption which showed that the introduction of the fluorine atom lowered these energy levels (Fig. 2a–c). According to the torsional angle profiles between bithophene units without/with fluorine atoms in the polymer backbone (Fig. S2a–c, and Table S1, see ESI†), the corresponding angle is reduced from PNTz4T (θ3o = 10.70°) to PNTz4T-1F (θ3o = 3.41°) and to PNTz4T-2F (θ3o = 6.97°) as summarized in Table S1.† It is interesting that the monofluoro-bithiophene prefers to be in the same plane of the conjugated backbones, while the other bithophene units (0F and 2F) tend to stretch out of the plane. From this we infer that the optimal number of fluorine atoms in the polymer backbone is vital not only to achieve a frontier orbital with desired energy levels but also to tune the planarity of the polymer structure.56,57

Moreover, molecular conformations play vital roles in determining the molecular stacking, morphology and charge transport properties in photoactive films. Varying the number of fluorine atoms on the bithiophene units in the polymer backbone may reduce or induce strain in the geometry, and the molecular conformations can be assessed by measuring the energy difference between their anti and syn conformations.58,59 The relaxed potential energy scan profiles are shown in Fig. 2d–f. It is clear there exist three low energy states for the configurations of the 0F-bithophene at 30° (syn), 150° and 210° (anti), indicating that these conformations might preferentially coexist. These results are in good agreement with those in earlier work.56 By replacing one of the H-atoms with a F-atom (1F-bithiophene), the minimum potential energy appeared at the anti-conformation of 180° while the syn conformation showed a minimum at 15° (Fig. 2e), which is a lower angle than that of 0F-bithiophene (30°) and 1F-bithiophene (50°). This implies that monofluoro-bithiophene can have a stable geometry in the syn conformation due to distinct non-covalent Fδ−⋯Hδ+ interactions.58 When two hydrogen atoms are replaced with F-atoms (2F-bithiophene), the syn conformation becomes unstable due to the strong Fδ−⋯Fδ− repulsion, as shown in the torsional energy profile (Fig. 2f). Due to the distinct non-covalent Fδ−⋯Hδ+ interactions, the monofluoro-bithiophene exhibits more stable and planar geometry as shown in Fig. 2e.
Photovoltaic device performance
PSCs with the inverted device architecture ITO/ZnO/PEIE/polymer:PC71BM(1:1.5)/MoO3/Ag were fabricated according to a previously reported procedure using the ITO-substrate.33 First, the devices were fabricated with a halogen-free xyl solvent only under hot processing conditions (solution = 110 °C and substrate = 100 °C). Without the DPE additive, large-scale phase segregation occurred due to the poor solubility of fullerene-based acceptors in xyl solvent, and this extensive phase separation induced poor charge carrier extraction and severe recombination in the devices and limited the overall performance of the PSCs (Table S2 and Fig. S3, see ESI†).54 When DPE as a halogen-free solvent additive was added to xyl and devices were fabricated under hot processing conditions, fullerene aggregation was averted and as a result, the short circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) improved dramatically. The photovoltaic (PV) parameters of the devices with all three polymers are summarized in Table 2.

PSCs based on the newly synthesized novel polymer PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM blend film have outperformed PNTz4T:PC71BM (9.73% PCE) and PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM (10.50% PCE)-based PSCs, showing an outstanding PCE of 11.77%. The PCEs of PNTz4T and PNTz4T-2F-based PSCs fabricated from the halogen-free solvent system are comparable to the PCEs of PSCs fabricated from a halogenated solvent system reported in earlier work.29,60 The best current density–voltage (J–V) curves for all three polymers are shown in Fig. 3a along with their external quantum efficiency (EQEs) in Fig. 3b. The PNTz4T-1F polymer showed the highest EQE of more than 72% in the entire region from 400 nm to 740 nm, reaching 80% of the value at a wavelength of 480 nm. When we measured the absorption coefficient of the photoactive layers (Fig. 1c), it was found that the PNTz4T-1F polymer exhibits the highest absorption coefficient throughout the visible light range in comparison with the other two polymers in the series, thus accounting for the highest JSC value. The higher absorption coefficient is consistent with previous reports which showed that enhanced nanocrystallinity led to increased optical absorption in blend films.61 Statistical data pertaining to device efficiencies obtained from 20 devices based on each polymer are shown in Fig. S4 (see ESI†), and these results are also tabulated in Table S3 (see ESI†). The PNTz4T-based PSCs showed an average PCE of 9.60%, for the PNTz4T-2F-based PSCs this value was 10.33%, and for PNTz4T-1F it exceeded 11.50%, with the best certified PCE of 11.67% (Fig. S5, see ESI†). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest certified efficiency reported thus far for polymer:PC71BM single-junction PSCs processed from a non-halogenated solvent system (Fig. S22, see ESI†).

Charge carrier mobilities
After the dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers, generally BHJ photoactive films with higher and balanced carrier mobility show high JSC and FF values,31,32,62 which usually originate from the well-ordered molecular packing in PSCs.62–64 We employed the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method to measure the hole mobilities (μh) and electron mobilities (μe) of neat and blend films. Previously, it was reported that the μh values are reduced when difluoro-bithiophene and tetrafluoro-bithiophene are inserted into the backbone of a PNTz4T-based co-polymer; the corresponding values are 3.4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 1.5 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the PNTz4T:PC71BM, PNTz4TF2:PC71BM and PNTz4TF4:PC71BM blends, respectively.29,60 This occurs due to the strong aggregation of the polymers, which originates from the stronger backbone coplanarity, leading to poor interconnectivity of the photoactive material domains.29 In our study, all polymer:PC71BM blends showed high μh and μe values of 2.78 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.36 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.80 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.93 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 2.32 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 0.98 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PNTz4T, PNTz4T-1F and PNTz4T-2F, respectively (Table 2 and Fig. S6†). As stated above, the PNTz4T-1F polymer blend has marginally higher μh and μe values than other polymer blends, and the mobility is relatively more balanced (Table 2). The difluoro-bithiophene-containing PNTz4T-2F blend has relatively lower mobilities in the series, but they are still close to ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. The hole mobility of the reference polymer PNTz4T blend is reasonable (2.78 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1); therefore, as per our speculation, monofluoro substitution into bithiophene to make PNTz4T-1F does not greatly affect the hole mobility, but the electron mobility is improved by 42% from 1.36 × 10−3 to 1.93 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 (for the PNTz4T-1F polymer), after which the charge carrier mobilities become more balanced. The incorporation of a F atom into the PNTz4T polymer has a profound effect on the PV parameters of PSCs based on this polymer. This stems from the enhanced interconnectivity between the polymer and the PC71BM (as will be discussed below) and from the formation of optimized morphology consisting of a highly interpenetrating network. The highest FF in the PSCs with PNTz4T-1F resulted from the high and balanced flow of holes/electrons across the device, as there was less of a buildup of charge carriers at the interface between the photoactive layer and the electrodes. Furthermore, these high and balanced charge carrier mobilities are of prime importance in PSCs with high photoactive layer thickness tolerance given that a robust R2R mass production technique will be employed. In the high-throughput R2R industrial production approach, precise control of the thickness of the photoactive layers to an exact value is difficult, while at the same time thicknesses below 100 nm are rather difficult to maintain. For these reasons, BHJ systems with high PCEs along with good photoactive layer thickness tolerances are highly desirable. Hence, we fabricated PSCs with different photoactive layer thicknesses for the polymer series and remarkably, our monofluoro-bithiophene PNTz4T-1F polymer-based PSCs showed an outstanding JSC of ∼18 mA cm−2 and PCEs exceeding 10% in the 150 nm to 400 nm range (Fig. 3c, d, Tables S4–6, see ESI†), whereas the blends of PNTz4T and PNTz4T-2F showed PCEs of 7% to 9% in the same range (the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S7–9, see ESI†). This highlights the importance of the monofluoro-bithiophene PNTz4T-1F polymer for practical applications. The series resistances (RS) of the PSCs under working conditions65 were determined, and our best device based on the PNTz4T-1F polymer showed the lowest RS (4.22 Ωcm2), while the PNTz4T sample demonstrated a value of 4.28 Ωcm2. The PNTz4T sample showed a series resistance of 6.22 Ωcm2 (Table 2 and Fig. S10a–c, see ESI†), which is in good agreement with the highest FF in the PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM-based PSCs.
Molecular orientation/packing and morphological properties
The molecular orientation and packing ordering of the neat polymers and polymer:PC71BM blends were assessed via grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).60,66–69 Fluoro-bithiophene-based neat polymers show an edge-on orientation, as observed from their dominant in-plane (IP) (010) π–π stacking peaks (Fig. S11a–c, see ESI†). The neat PNTz4T did not show the (010) π–π stacking peak along the IP or OOP directions, while the neat PNTz4T-1F and PNTz4T-2F samples showed (010) π–π stacking peaks at nearly 1.72 Å−1 and 1.69 Å−1, corresponding to π–π stacking distances of 3.56 Å and 3.63 Å, respectively (Table S7 and Fig. S11e, see ESI†). Additionally, the dominant long-range (h00) order is observed along the OOP and IP directions in the PNTz4T-1F and PNTz4T-2F polymers (Fig. S11d and e, see ESI†). The shift of the diffraction peak towards a higher qOOP value and the appearance of the (300) diffraction peaks along the OOP direction in the PNTz4T-1F and PNTz4T-2F polymers suggest higher crystallinity in fluoro-bithiophene-based polymers as compared to the PNTz4T polymer (Fig. S11, see ESI†). The neat PNTz4T and PNTz4T-2F polymers exhibited interchain distances (lamellae) of 23.74 Å and 22.18 Å, respectively, while the PNTz4T-1F neat polymer demonstrated the shortest lamellae distance of 19.82 Å (Table S7, see ESI†). These results substantiate our previous DFT calculations, which found that monofluoro-bithiophene has the lowest torsional energy (Fig. 2e) due to non-covalent Fδ−⋯Hδ interactions,31,59 and the PNTz4T-1F polymer has the highest planarity (Fig. S2b, see ESI†) due to the additional non-covalent Fδ−⋯Sδ+ interactions with the neighboring thiophenes.31,70 Due to the highest planarity of the PNTz4T-1F polymer backbone in the series, the interdigitation probability is also the highest, leading to compact interdigitated lamellae.67–69 Due to the overly enhanced planarity of the PNTz4T-2F polymer arising from the enhanced Fδ−⋯Sδ+ interactions, the solubility is relatively more reduced in the PNTz4T-2F polymer than in the PNTz4T-1F polymer. As a result, the PNTz4T-2F polymer did not have enough time to fully inter-digitize its alkyl groups, thereby resulting in a lamellae distance of 22.18 Å.
2D-GIWAXS images and the line-cut profiles of photoactive films fabricated without the DPE additive are shown in Fig. S12a–c and Fig. S12d, e (see ESI†), respectively. The (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak, a characteristic of efficient PSCs, was observed both in the OOP and IP directions in all three photoactive films. However, the (010) π–π stacking diffraction peak in the OOP direction exhibited broad and low intensity compared to that in the IP direction, suggesting that the polymers have relatively high proportions of the edge-on orientation as compared to the face-on orientation (Fig. S12e, f and Table S8, see ESI†). For an efficient vertical flow of charge carriers in PSCs, the face-on orientation is preferred,24,60,71 which is why xyl-processed devices show poor performance capabilities (Table S2†). When these photoactive materials were processed with an addition of DPE, the molecular orientations of the polymers noticeably changed from the edge-on to the preferential face-on orientation, which can be clearly observed from the (010) π–π stacking OOP-diffraction peaks at ∼1.75 Å−1 (Fig. 4a–c). A shorter π–π stacking distance is beneficial for an efficient flow of charges between polymer backbones,66–68 and the π–π stacking distance, i.e., 3.60 Å−1, remains nearly identical in both fluorinated polymers (Table 3) yet reasonably high enough for an efficient vertical flow of the charge carriers. The lamellae distance is shortest in the PNTz4T-1F polymer; additionally, the OOP-crystalline coherence length (010) CCL (which is the extent of polymer ordering or crystallite size)72 in the case of the PNTz4T-1F film is highest among the three polymers. CCL is one of the reasons for the enhanced JSC and FF values in PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM-based PSCs.

Near-edge X-ray absorption fine spectroscopy (NEXAFS) was also utilized to determine the orientation of the polymers in bulk blend films (Fig. 4g and S13, see ESI†).43,73–75 The average tilt angle (α) was obtained from the incident polarization angle (θ) with respect to the film, while the molecular arrangement of the polymers was obtained in the total electron yield (TEY) mode (Fig. S13a–c, see ESI†).43,73–75 The dichroic ratios (R) showed that the PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM blend film exhibits a more ordered structure (R = 0.24 for α = 62.28°) as compared to the PNTz4T:PC71BM (R = 0.14 for α = 59.35°) and PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM (R = 0.22 for α = 61.85°) samples. Furthermore, we measured the contact angles of the photoactive films and of neat PC71BM to determine the effects of fluorination of the polymer backbone on the surface energy levels related to the preferential molecular orientation and arrangement. As low surface energy leads to the formation of the edge-on orientation and high surface energy leads to the face-on orientation,60,76 the surface energy levels of the photoactive films over the ZnO NPs/PEIE layer were measured (Fig. S14 and Table S9, see ESI†). There were no considerable differences in the surface energy outcomes of all three polymer blends. Therefore, we further investigated the morphologies of these photoactive films to discern the cause of the efficiency improvements.
Tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) is employed to study the surface morphologies of the photoactive layers under the optimized processing conditions (Fig. 5). Fig. 5a–c show surface topographic images, while Fig. 5d–f show phase images of the PNTz4T:PC71BM, PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM and PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM blend films. The surface roughness decreased for the fluorinated polymer blend films in comparison to the reference polymer blend film, i.e., 3.13 nm for PNTz4T, 1.73 nm for PNTz4T-1F and 2.44 nm for PNTz4T-2F blend films. Greater connectivity between the grains from the PNTz4T-1F polymer is clearly observable in the corresponding topographic image, featuring an enhanced fibrillar network.77 A fibrillar network is beneficial for efficient exciton dissociation, charge generation and transfer in the photoactive layer and the corresponding charge transport through the blend films; therefore, the newly synthesized PNTz4T-1F polymer showed enhanced fibrillar features among polymer blend films in the series. More uniformity with improved inter-domain connectivity can also be observed in the corresponding phase image (Fig. 5e), while the PNTz4T-2F blend films show coarser film surfaces with thicker fibrils (Fig. 5f).

To study the morphological properties of the interpenetrating network of the photoactive films in more depth, bright-field transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was employed. Bright regions are designated as polymer-rich domains and dark regions are assigned to PC71BM, as PC71BM reflects back the incident electrons owing to its electron rich nature, resulting in dark regions in the TEM images.36 Nano-fibrils with approximate widths of tens of nanometers were formed in all three polymer blend films (Fig. 5g–i). Recently, it was reported that polymer nanowires form in PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM blend films when processed with a chlorobenzene and 1,8-diiodooctane solvent system.36 Here, we used the xyl + DPE solvent system, which has different solvent evaporation kinetics, leading to film formation. The main focus of our TEM study is to determine how and why these nanofibrils (or nanowires) in the newly synthesized polymer (PNTz4T-1F) blend contribute to the impressive enhancement of JSC while also imparting a reasonably high FF. The length and width of the nano-fibrils in the PNTz4T-1F polymer blend are reduced in comparison to those of the reference PNTz4T polymer blend (Fig. 5g–h), which led to an enhanced interfacial area between the polymer and PC71BM. This result is in good agreement with a previously published report showing that the low solubility of polymers in solution leads to the formation of narrower fibrils.42 When the difluoro-bithiophene PNTz4T-2F polymer is employed, the nano-fibril lengths are reduced but their widths are increased. The reason for the reduced nano-fibril lengths in PNTz4T-2F as compared to PNTz4T-1F can be ascribed to the relative difference in the solubility and the stronger non-covalent Fδ−⋯Sδ+ interactions. Moreover, the use of the PNTz4T-2F polymer led to the formation of phase-segregated domains (Fig. 5i), which acted as hosts to charge carrier recombination. Although substitution of these two fluorine atoms brought about the advantage of an increased VOC value and reduced energy loss (Eloss = Eg − eVOC),29 the formation of phase-segregated domains (Fig. 5i) and the relatively small population of face-on oriented crystallites (Fig. 4c) in the PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM blend films limited the simultaneous enhancement of JSC in comparison to that in the PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM blends (Fig. 3 and Table 2). The PCE was limited to 10.5% but was still high enough for fullerene-based PSCs processed from halogen-free solvents, and these PCE results with the reference PNTz4T and PNTz4T-2F polymers are comparable to previous findings.29,36
The formation of unhindered percolation pathways is critical for the efficient flow of charge carriers through BHJ PSCs.42 In this regard, the morphology of the photoactive layers in the bulk films is visualized by employing electron tomography (3D-TEM).46–49Fig. 6a–f show 3D-TEM images of the PNTz4T:PC71BM, PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM and PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM blend films from the top and bottom, where the bright fields represent the polymer distribution/arrangement in the films. The 3D-TEM results correlate fairly well with the bright-field TEM results, in which the polymer nano-fibril length is reduced in the PNTz4T-1F polymer and aggregated regions are formed in the PNTz4T-2F-based photoactive film. Qualitatively, the monofluoro-bithiophene PNTz4T-1F polymer blend has a balanced distribution of polymer nano-fibers at the top as well as at the bottom of the blend films (Fig. 6a–f).

(m) Quantitative distribution of the polymers throughout the bulk photoactive films under optimized conditions. 
For a clear depiction of the discreet polymer regions in the bulk of the photoactive films, false coloration was employed so that the content of the polymer nano-fibers could be better envisioned (Fig. 6g–i). The cross-sectional morphologies of the polymer:PC71BM blend films are then obtained by means of 3D-TEM analysis (Fig. 6j–l). The relative ratio of the polymers to PC71BM per unit area is calculated from binarized images along the vertical axes. Intriguingly, the PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM blend has a more balanced proportion of the polymer throughout the bulk of the photoactive layer (Fig. 6j–l).
The relative ratios of the polymers at the top and bottom of the blend films were found to be 52.50% and 50.60% for PNTz4T, 52.50% and 51.60% for PNTz4T-1F and 61.80% and 62.80% for PNTz4T-2F, respectively (Fig. 6m and Table S10,† see ESI†).
Owing to the strong aggregation of PNTz4T-2F, a non-uniform distribution of the polymer throughout the bulk photoactive film was observed. The distribution of the polymer fibrils at the top and bottom of the blend films is uniform in the PNTz4T-1F polymer-based photoactive films, and these fibrils also have the highest interconnectivity with PC71BM throughout the bulk of the film, both of which are beneficial for the efficient flow of charge carriers. The narrower fibril width, the uniform distribution of the polymer nanowires, along with the highest interconnectivity with the PC71BM acceptor in the PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM blend films accounted for the impressive device performance, with the PSCs based on these films outperforming PNTz4T- and PNTz4T-2F-based PSCs.
To determine the vertical composition profiles of the bulk photoactive films, secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS) was employed, where the elemental distribution is obtained from the corresponding depth profiles. To assess the polymer content, sulfur ions were designated for the polymers and carbon ions were designated for PC71BM. The polymers and PC71BM are uniformly distributed along the entire bulk photoactive film, as uniform profiles of the tracking elemental ions were found in the blend films (Fig. S15 and S16,† see ESI†). These results corroborated our cross-sectional TEM-EDS results, where no visible or prominent vertical distribution appeared in the PNTz4T:PC71BM, PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM or PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM blend films (Fig. S17–S20,† see ESI†).
Charge carrier recombination dynamics and photocurrents in the PSCs
When photo-induced charge carriers are generated upon the absorption of light, their sweep motions to their respective electrodes prior to recombination play a significant role in defining the quality of the BHJ morphology and the overall performance of PSCs.77,79 Ohmic contact and increased/balanced charge carrier mobilities mitigate the possibility of a space charge build-up, which accounts for the higher JSC and FF values in PSCs.78–80 The comparison between bimolecular and monomolecular recombination in the PSCs provides another clue to determine the difference in the PV parameters with different fluorine substitutions in the donor polymer. Fluorination of the polymer backbone helps to enhance charge carrier transport and reduce recombination via its tendency towards the preferential face-on orientation.23 In order to find the extent of bimolecular recombination in these PSCs, VOC and JSC were measured as a function of the incident light intensity (Pin) from 0.1 to 1 sun (Fig. 7a, b, and S21a–c, see ESI†).
 Fig. 7  Light intensity vs. (a) JSC and (b) VOC for the optimized PSCs consisting of polymer:PC71BM-based photoactive layers. (c) Photocurrent (Jph) vs. effective voltage (Veff) for the polymer:PC71BM-based PSCs. (d) Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of neat polymers and polymer:PC71BM blend films. 
The relationship between JSC and Pin can be expressed as a power law: JSC ∝ (Pin)α, where α is the bimolecular recombination parameter, and a higher α value shows that there is lower bimolecular recombination in the PSCs, indicating less of a loss of photo-generated carriers.81 The α values from 5 independent PSCs have been calculated and their statistical results have been shown in Fig. 7a. We observed that the introduction of monofluoro-bithiophene into the polymer backbone increases α to 0.99 ± 0.01, which suggests that the PSCs based on PNTz4T-1F have the lowest bimolecular recombination in the series of PSCs due to balanced charge carrier mobilities. The PSCs based on the PNTz4T (α = 0.97 ± 0.01) polymer and on the PNTz4T-2F (α = 0.97 ± 0.01) polymer show similar α values, while the plot of VOC against Pin provides information about the types of recombination where the slope equal to 1 kT/q shows dominant bimolecular recombination and slope equal to 2kT/q shows dominant trap-assisted recombination, while in some cases, a slope of <1 kT/q is also reported in the literature which indicates surface trap assisted recombination in the PSCs.82,83Fig. 7b shows that the slope of VOCvs. Pin is lowest for the PNTz4T-1F polymer (1.17 ± 0.03 kT/q) in comparison to the reference PNTz4T (1.33 ± 0.06 kT/q) and PNTz4T-2F (1.41 ± 0.09 kT/q) polymers. Apart from the preferential face-on orientation of the polymer backbones in the photoactive films, we anticipate that the reduction in the bimolecular and trap-assisted charge carrier recombination in the PNTz4T-1F blend film occurs due to the higher interconnectivity of the polymer nano-fibrils and PC71BM and the extended interconnectivity throughout the bulk photoactive films. Furthermore, we determined the maximum exciton generation rates (Gmax) and charge collection probabilities P(E,T) under the short-circuit condition in the optimized PSCs according to previously reported methods.84,85 It was observed that the photocurrent (Jph) becomes saturated at around 2 V (Fig. 7c) for all PSCs, and the Gmax values calculated for the PNTz4T:PC71BM, PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM and PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM-based PSCs are 4.45 × 1027 m−3 s−1, 5.18 × 1027 m−3 s−1 and 4.70 × 1027 m−3 s−1, respectively. The highest exciton generation rate in the PNTz4T-1F-based PSC is due to the enhanced exciton generation resulting from the higher absorption coefficient (Fig. 1c). At the same time, the P(E,T) rates are found to be 98.3% for PNTz4T:PC71BM, 97.4% for PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM and 92.4% for PNTz4T-2F:PC71BM blends. To ascertain the cause of the higher P(E,T) in the PNTz4T and PNTz4T-1F polymer blends, we determined the photoluminescence quenching of the photoactive films, as shown in Fig. 7d. It was found that the PNTz4T and PNTz4T-1F blend films have PL quenching rates of 98% and 97%, respectively, while for PNTz4T-2F this rate is 87%. Due to the lowest solubility of PNTz4T-2F in the xyl + DPE solvent system, aggregates were formed, which resulted in poor interconnectivity between the PNTz4T-2F polymer and PC71BM. In contrast, due to the highest interconnectivity in the PNTz4T-1F blend film, weak bimolecular recombination, the highest exciton generation rate and quite high exciton dissociation probability levels along with high PL quenching were observed, and all of these factors contributed to the highest FF and JSC values in the PNTz4T-1F:PC71BM-based PSCs.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have outlined a new synthetic route to synthesize a monofluoro-bithiophene monomer and designed/synthesized a novel PNTz4T-1F polymer. With the PNTz4T-1F polymer, highly efficient single-junction fullerene-based PSCs have been fabricated from a halogen-free solvent system. The high performances are attributed to the enhanced interpenetrating network of the PNTz4T-1F polymer and PC71BM domains with improved interconnectivity and molecular ordering and packing properties, leading to enhanced device performance. These results were further supported by high and balanced carrier mobilities and lower bimolecular recombination in the PNTz4T-1F-based photoactive film. As a result, a fullerene-based PSC with PNTz4T-1F showed an outstanding PCE of 11.77%, surpassing other two polymers in the series. Additionally, the PNTz4T-1F polymer-based PSCs showed better photoactive layer thickness tolerance, providing a PCE of >10% from 150 nm to 400 nm. The findings of this study suggest that the optimum number of fluoro substitutions in the polymer backbone plays a crucial role in maintaining the solubility of the polymer, while also providing enough rigidity to the polymer backbone to obtain sufficient fibril network growth, which is an important factor to boost the PCEs. These results will pave the way for researchers to design efficient PSCs from halogen-free solvent systems by carefully selecting the optimal number of fluorine atoms in the polymer backbone.
