    , Accepted 4th January 2019First published on 5th January 2019AbstractA short exciton diffusion length (LD) is one of the main factors limiting the final power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic photovoltaics (OPV). Aiming at overcoming this barrier, there have been studies on the use of longer-lived triplet excitons, which can be introduced either through triplet sensitization by doping or through the use of donor materials containing heavy atoms that allow for intersystem crossing (ISC).

1. Introduction
The conversion of light into electric energy through photovoltaics is arguably the best strategy towards a future based on clean energy as the Sun is the most abundant and reliable source of energy for our planet.1,2 Organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices have the potential for cheaper, simpler and less energy-intensive production compared to conventional Si-based solar cells, leading to a shorter payback time and giving us better economical foundations towards this clean future.3 The advantages of OPVs and the excitement that they created, has led to rapid development of the field, with devices now reaching power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 14% in single junction devices and 17% in a tandem cell, bringing the performance levels closer to those of Si-based devices.4–7 However, despite the impressive growth of the field, these high-performing devices are still based on materials that have a fundamental limitation: short exciton diffusion length.
Absorption by the active layer in OPV devices at room temperature leads to the formation of excitons (bound electron/hole pairs) instead of yielding free charge carriers almost directly, as is the case of inorganic materials.3,4 This is of crucial importance as excitons have a limited lifetime but must diffuse to the p–n junction (typically a heterojunction) to be dissociated into charge carriers and generate current. Failing to dissociate the excitons before they recombine is a major source of efficiency loss.3
The average exciton diffusion length (LD) can be described by eqn (1), where Z indicates the number of dimensions considered for exciton diffusion, D is the diffusion coefficient and τ is the exciton lifetime. While diffusing towards the junction, the exciton is intrinsically prone to recombination and will tend to lose its energy either radiatively or non-radiatively. (1)
In most organic semiconductors (OSC), such as thiophene-based materials, the exciton formed upon light absorption is of singlet character, with relative ease of recombination and exciton lifetimes on the order of nanoseconds, which result in LD values on the order of only 10 nm.8,9 Due to the low value of LD, most high-performance OPV devices are based on the concept of bulk heterojunctions (BHJ), where there is a nanoscale mixing of the donor and acceptor materials to minimize the distance that the exciton has to travel before reaching the p–n junction for dissociation. Despite their high performance, BHJ depend on delicate optimization of morphology to have domain sizes within LD and can suffer from stability issues when the nature of phase separation changes over time.10–12 These factors exist in conjunction with increased difficulty in device fabrication that could diminish the advantage of easier production that is so appealing for OPVs.
Materials that can form triplet excitons emerge in this scenario with the possibility to overcome exciton diffusion issues, as these excitons have a longer lifetime due to their quantum-mechanically forbidden relaxation to the ground state.13 Although the mobility of triplets is more limited than that of singlets, as triplet excitons mostly diffuse through Dexter energy transfer, requiring orbital overlap, while singlets can move through Forster energy transfer (FRET), impressive LD values as high as several micrometers have been identified for triplet excitons.9,14–16 In fact, it has been demonstrated that, in contrast to singlets, triplet excitons have no theoretical maximum diffusion length.17 If OPVs can be engineered with materials that have access to the triplet state, not only can the efficiency of BHJs be improved, but one could even think of returning to the classic and more robust layered solar cells if the device can balance a thicker active layer for optimal light absorption with the increased exciton diffusion length.
The use of heavy atom-containing molecules, such as organometallic complexes, can introduce spin–orbit coupling to generate triplet excitons. This concept has led to many publications in the field of OPVs and has been reviewed by different authors.18–20 Here, we focus on understanding how the overall exciton diffusion length can be increased by incorporating heavy elements either as dopants or as part of the main donor material in solar cells. Methods that quantify exciton diffusion length will also be discussed as well as the impact of the increased LD on device performance and challenges facing the field. It is important to note that triplet excitons also have other roles in photovoltaics, such as in charge separation and singlet fission, both of which will not be discussed in depth here.21–25
2. Experimental determination of triplet diffusion length
While the effect of LD on the photocurrent of a solar cell can be easily noticeable due to an increased number of excitons reaching the p–n junction, there are different methods used in the scientific literature to determine the LD (Fig. 1). The choice of method can lead to different values depending on factors like morphology perturbation or the presence of triplet–triplet annihilation when the concentration of triplet states generated is high.26–29 The experimental determination of LD and these limitations for long range diffusion encountered during measurements also provide the foundation for theoretical studies aiming at predicting this property.17,29–31

Donor material is represented in blue; acceptor in orange (a) thickness optimization and performance modelling: L is optimized and L ≈ LD is assumed or OPV output (e.g. EQE) is fitted to calculate LD. (b) TDPL and SRPL quenching: luminescence (blue arrow) and lifetime decrease if L ≤ LD. (c) SRPL quenching: difference in distribution of excitons determined through PL with a blocking layer (non-quenching) and with a quenching layer on top allows determination of LD. (d) Indirect luminescence: non-emissive triplets travel through the sample to decay radiatively in the acceptor. Excitons can be created directly in the donor layer or injected from another material (green), with the acceptor PL intensity depending on LD. (e) PIA and TAS: absorption spectroscopy of triplets further excited in the triplet manifold to determine number of triplets and their quenching dynamics.

 Fig. 2  Materials mentioned in this section for triplet exciton diffusion measurements: N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine (NPD), poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV), poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene) (PFO) and 4,4′bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (CBP). 
Nguyen et al. published a review on exciton diffusion in 2015 that explores the dynamics of exciton energy transfer and outlines common methods to determine the diffusion length of both singlet and triplet excitons.9 The simplest way to estimate the diffusion length in OPVs is through the thickness optimization of layered devices or performance modelling (Fig. 1a). While enhanced exciton diffusion does lead to the possibility of a thicker active layer, extracting an accurate LD from these measurements is challenging and reflects a combination of both singlet and triplet diffusion.32–35 Methods to probe triplet LD separately through phosphorescence, such as thickness-dependent photoluminescence (TDPL) quenching (Fig. 1b), are also common and can work well in cases where the material used provides sufficiently intense luminescence.35–39 In these measurements, the device architecture quenches luminescence by charge separation between a donor and acceptor molecule if the thickness of the donor is close to or smaller than LD.
Spectrally-resolved photoluminescence (SRPL) quenching was developed by Forrest et al. as an alternative to simple quenching so that film thickness and crystallinity control would not be as important, being less susceptible to fabrication parameters (Fig. 1c).40 In this method, an exciton quenching or blocking layer is deposited on top of the material of interest and their absorption and PL spectra are compared to extract the exciton density distribution within the donor material. The decrease in density of excitons detected close to the top layer when the blocking layer is replaced by a quenching layer reflects LD. In cases where the photoluminescence (PL) of the donor matches the absorption of the quenching layer, the energy transfer between the two layers is considered. This technique is especially important since both the interfacial morphology and energy transfer processes between donor and acceptor can significantly impact the measured LD.41–43
The diffusion length can also be extracted from Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements (Fig. 1b). The PL decay over time can be fitted to yield the exciton lifetime, which can then be used to obtain LD through eqn (1).9,40,44,45 A reduction of the lifetime can also be associated with excitons being dissociated at the p–n junction, similarly to thickness dependent PL quenching, providing evidence that the excitons can travel far enough to reach it. However, due to the quantum-mechanically forbidden decay of triplet excitons, some materials may not have strong phosphorescence, thus necessitating the use of intense beams to generate enough triplet excitons for detection, which can lead to triplet–triplet annihilation and limit the use of luminescence-based methods.
In order to determine triplet exciton diffusion lengths through indirect luminescence (Fig. 1d), Loi et al. showed that a layer of a luminescent palladium complex deposited on top of poly(9,9-di-n-octylfluorene) (PFO) can collect triplets generated in PFO and lead to enhanced phosphorescence detection with minimal morphology changes.27 The luminescence intensity of the layer of Pd complex depends on the ability of excitons to reach it (in other words, the LD needs to be high enough). This method also has the advantage of operating well at room temperature, while others, such as TRPL, may require liquid nitrogen temperature to increase exciton lifetimes for detection.8 Similarly, Forrest and co-workers developed a pseudo-time-of-flight experiment based on light absorption in the near UV spectral region by layers of variable thicknesses to generate excitons at the surface of the material of interest, in this case 4,4′bis(N-carbazolyl)biphenyl (CBP), which diffuse and are transferred to another layer doped with triplet emitters.46 This method was also shown to be able to determine the triplet–triplet annihilation rate and the influence of wide-bandgap dopants that can scatter the excitons. A related technique was later developed by Loi et al. where the layer of interest is deposited between thin layers of phosphorescent materials (Fig. 3).47 The first phosphorescent layer is used as an electrically excited triplet injection layer, while the second detects, through phosphorescence, the triplet excitons that diffuse through the layer of interest. The detection side of the device is only partially covered by the detecting layer so that the uncovered region can be used as a reference. Triplet–triplet annihilation could be identified as a major factor influencing triplet diffusion, but altering the power at the injection layer diminishes this problem leading to larger values of LD.

As triplet states are usually non-emissive, probing diffusion lengths in spite of luminescence intensity of the material can be inherently valuable (Fig. 1e). Transient and photoinduced absorption spectroscopies (TAS and PIA, respectively) are pump-probe methods commonly used to study non-emissive triplet states. In these methods, a beam is used to generate triplet excitons, while a second beam probes the triplet manifold by further exciting triplet states. The goal of PIA and TAS is similar to TDPL and TRPL, where the amount and lifetime of triplets detected changes with quenching. Through PIA, Guha et al. were able to measure the quenching of triplet states by increasing the ratio of 1-[3-(methoxycarbonyl)propyl]-1-phenyl-[6,6]C61 (PCBM) in blends of a triplet sensitized polymer,15 while Greenham et al. measured the triplet dynamics in platinum-sensitized poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene-vinylene] (MEH-PPV).48 TAS was also utilized by other groups to study triplet excitons in heavy atom-containing and heavy atom-free OPV donors.49–51 Additionally, time-resolved microwave conductivity is a contactless method that can be used to detect charge carriers generated from exciton dissociation and correlate it to LD. The LD of singlet and triplet states can be separately estimated from the amplitude and temporal shape of the photoconductivity transients generated by thin films placed in a microwave cavity waveguide subjected to illumination.52,53 These methods can be used in conjunction with J–V plots for solar cells to help determine the dynamics of the triplet states in devices based on triplet sensitization or when the main donor material promotes the formation of triplet excitons.
3. Triplet sensitizers
One of the most straightforward ways to generate triplet excitons in an OPV device is to dope materials that are already known as good electron donors with well-studied triplet sensitizers that contain heavy atoms and can efficiently promote intersystem crossing (ISC) to the triplet manifold (Fig. 4).54–56 With this strategy, the sensitizer can (1) absorb light directly to generate triplet excitons that can later be transferred to the host material (the donor material in the OPV scope), or (2) convert a fraction of the singlet excitons generated in the host to triplets after energy transfer, if these materials have appropriate matching of energy levels.57,58 An advantage of using sensitizers to study triplet diffusion is that at low degrees of doping, the morphology of the host may not change significantly and the triplet diffusion length can be more easily compared to the exciton diffusion lengths of the undoped materials.48,59 Additionally, energy transfer from sensitizer to a host which cannot promote significant spin–orbit coupling will lead to triplet excitons in the host with very low recombination rates and long lifetimes.60

Sensitizers: tris[2-phenylpyridinato-C2,N]iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3), tris[2-(4-tolyl)pyridinato-N,C2]iridium(III) (Ir(mppy)3), tris(phenylpyrazole)iridium(III) (Ir(ppz)3), bis[2-(4-tertbutylphenyl)benzothiazolato-N,C2](acetylacetonate)iridium(III) ((t-bt)2Ir(acac)), metallophthalocyanines (MPc), platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP), platinum–porphyrin dendrimer (Pt-dendrimer) and the anionic iridium complex (pqIrpicNa). Hosts: poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MEH-PPV), Super Yellow, poly(3-hexyl)thiophene (P3HT), N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine (NPD) and phenyl and methyl-substituted ladder-type poly(para-phenylene) (PhLPPP and MeLPPP). 
3.1 Iridium sensitizers
As iridium organometallic complexes have strong spin–orbit coupling to promote ISC and achieve high phosphorescence quantum yields, they are known as good triplet sensitizers for various applications and therefore have been used as dopants for different materials in OPVs.54 Shy et al. doped both PFO and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) with 10 wt% of tris[2-(4-tolyl)pyridinato-N,C2]iridium(III) (Ir(mppy)3) in organic/inorganic hybrid devices.61 The PFO system was used as a model for triplet population and lifetime determination in photoinduced absorption measurements, since the signal for P3HT excitons overlaps with its polarons. Despite the low overall efficiencies of the devices fabricated, both systems showed improved short circuit current density (JSC) due to enhanced ISC, increasing 200% in PFO (from ca. 5 to 15 μA cm−2) and 100% in P3HT (ca. 32 to 62 μA cm−2).
Tris[2-phenylpyridinato-C2,N]iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)3) was also studied as a dopant for P3HT in PCBM-containing BHJs, possessing energy levels that enable triplet sensitization of P3HT.59,62 Retention of blend morphology without thermal treatment has been shown with loadings of Ir(ppy)3 up to 5 wt%, with improvement of JSC, open circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) caused by doping with the triplet sensitizer (Fig. 5).59 At high loadings of 25 wt%, the dopant affects the fiber formation of P3HT and causes strong phase separation between P3HT and PCBM, leading to reduced efficiencies. However, a later study showed decreased efficiency (from 2.96% to 0.81% PCE) when introducing Ir(ppy)3 at 5 wt% loading into thermally annealed blends.62 The annealing should be beneficial and improve the crystallinity of P3HT, but causes a drop in PCE, JSC and FF due to PCBM aggregation induced by the dopant, which leads to poor charge transport and higher series resistance. When P3HT nanofibers were used without thermal annealing, a slight increase in JSC caused by the dopant (from 6.30 to 6.75 mA cm−2) was again observed, despite not reaching the efficiencies of the undoped, thermally annealed P3HT:PCBM blend.

Using a different BHJ formed by MEH-PPV and PCBM in equal proportion, Howe et al. homogeneously dispersed 5 wt% of Ir(ppy)3 to increase JSC from 0.6 to 1.1 mA cm−2 leading to an overall increase in PCE of 80%.32 Through studies on the effect of an external magnetic field on the photocurrent and on the PL of the blends, the authors argue that this increase in PCE is based on the increase of triplet exciton ratio formed in the MEH-PPV matrix. To analyse the exciton diffusion length, layered MEH-PPV/PCBM solar cells were built and the optimal thickness of the MEH-PPV layer for maximum photocurrent was determined, showing an increased layer thickness when 5 wt% of Ir(ppy)3 is used. This result led to the calculation of an overall exciton diffusion length of 6.0 nm compared to 3.5 nm when no triplet sensitizer is used, although the authors note that the interface between MEH-PPV and PCBM was poorly defined. The same issue had previously been observed in NRS-PPV, an alkoxy substituted PPV copolymer, with penetration of the fullerene that can facilitate the collection of singlet excitons and diminish the effect of triplet exciton injection in the optimized layer thickness.41
The energy levels of N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N′-bis(phenyl)-benzidine (NPD) and Ir(ppy)3 have been shown to allow for singlet states generated upon light absorption by the host to be transferred to the sensitizer for triplet conversion, as well as direct light absorption by the sensitizer to generate the triplet excitons in NPD.60 Luminescence measurements in layered solar cells were able to track the final location of the excitons (Fig. 6) as the fluorescence of the NPD host is quenched when doped, but no phosphorescence arises from Ir(ppy)3. When compared to a system based on CBP, where the dopant acts as an exciton sink and shows phosphorescence, it can be inferred that for NPD, the most stable excitons generated are non-emissive triplets located in the host. Devices with C60 acceptors and 5 wt% of Ir(ppy)3 resulted in an increase of 80% in PCE compared to the undoped case when thick NPD layers of 45 nm were used, as the increased light absorption can be balanced by the longer exciton diffusion length in the doped case. Care was also taken to rule out the direct exciton dissociation at Ir(ppy)3–C60 interfaces, as when a neat NPD layer was added in between doped NPD and C60, no significant change in device performance was observed. By modelling the external quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of wavelength, the authors were able to determine LD = 11.1 ± 0.6 nm for NPD with 5 wt% Ir(ppy)3, in contrast with LD = 6.5 ± 0.3 nm for neat NPD. Under minimum triplet–triplet annihilation, an impressive maximum triplet diffusion length of 87 nm in NPD films was later reported by Loi et al. by depositing NPD in between phosphorescent layers (Fig. 3) and using an incident beam with a power density of 100 mW cm−2.47 This suggests that device optimization could further improve the observed LD.
 Fig. 6  Photoluminescence (PL) intensity measurements for NPD (a) and CBP (b) doped with Ir(ppy)3. The solid lines represent neat materials while the dashed and dotted lines are for doped materials. Emission from Ir(ppy)3 occurs at ca. 510 nm. Singlet states generated in the NPD can be converted to triplets by the dopant and be transferred back to NPD, leading to long-lived states and low PL, but in CBP, the dopant acts as a singlet sink and increasing its concentration leads to phosphorescence from Ir(ppy)3.

Less common Ir sensitizers were studied by the Hsu and Jiang groups.63,64 Hsu used 0.1 wt% of tris(phenylpyrazole)iridium (Ir(ppz)3) for an optimal PCE of 7.08% in a BHJ of P3HT and a fullerene acceptor. The introduction of Ir(ppz)3 maintained VOC but increased significantly JSC from 10.44 to 12.40 mA cm−2. Depth profile analysis showed that in this case the sensitizer was concentrated close to the hole buffer layer but did not interfere with charge mobility. Instead, the increase in JSC is related to the increase in LD as determined by time-resolved photoluminescence measurements.63 Jiang reported the effects of changing the composition of a donor with bis[2-(4-tertbutylphenyl)benzothiazolato-N,C2](acetylacetonate)iridium(III) (t-bt)2Ir(acac) and copper phthalocyanine (CuPc).64 At high loadings, the efficiency dropped due to poor charge mobility, but with loadings of 25% (t-bt)2Ir(acac), an increase of LD from 10 nm in pure CuPc to 17.4 nm was achieved to increase the efficiency.65
A more unorthodox use of iridium was reported by Kim et al., making a BHJ formed by P3HT and PCBM where an anionic iridium complex with sodium counterions (pqIrpicNa, in Fig. 4) and polyethylene oxide (PEO) were used as additives.66 pqIrpicNa was shown to promote highly efficient triplet energy transfer to P3HT (99%) and its ionic character promoted better phase separation with PCBM. The iridium complex shows highest efficiency at a ratio of 1:1 of pqIrpicNa to PEO, giving a PCE of 3.4% with FF of 0.56.
3.2 Platinum sensitizers
Platinum is also a good heavy element for promoting ISC and therefore molecules based on Pt have also been used as triplet sensitizers. Platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) has been shown to quench the fluorescence of a phenyl-substituted PPV polymer, Super Yellow (SY), as it converts the singlet states of the system into triplets and leads to improved JSC and an exciton diffusion length increase from 4 to 9 nm in layered OPV devices (Fig. 7).67,68 Interestingly, the use of octaethylporphyrin without platinum caused the device JSC and FF to drop significantly, as the porphyrin acted as an exciton sink that could remove excitons from the polymer but not transfer them back.
 Fig. 7  Current–voltage curve for devices in the dark (dotted lines) or under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5D solar illumination (solid lines) where the polymeric active layer (SY) is neat (black triangles) or doped with PtOEP (blue squares) or OEP (red circles).

It is also worth noting that, while using PtOEP as a sensitizer for SY led to an increase of about 10% in JSC within BHJ architectures, the same sensitizer–polymer combination resulted in a 40% increase in the JSC of layered devices. Direct exciton dissociation from PtOEP to PCBM in a MEH-PPV system was identified as the cause for the relative performance loss in BHJs.48 The rate of exciton dissociation between PtOEP and PCBM was determined to be faster than the energy transfer between PtOEP and MEH-PPV using photoinduced absorption spectroscopy, although the triplet transfer to MEH-PPV is possible and resulted in improved efficiency in a bilayer architecture. The increased energy transfer rate between sensitizer and acceptor compared to sensitizer and donor, led the authors to propose that attaching the sensitizer to the chain of a conjugated donor polymer could be a more efficient way to populate the triplet states of the host (see Section 4).69 This idea is plausible based on the requirement for orbital overlap for the Dexter energy transfer mechanism of triplet states.9
The sensitization of MEH-PPV/PCBM with PtOEP was also studied by Angel and Tang, aiming at uncovering the effect of the sensitizer in layered devices.70 The EQE was enhanced by doping a 11 nm thick MEH-PPV film with 5% PtOEP, with an increase of JSC of 40%, while using 10% PtOEP leads to intermediate values (Fig. 8). In this system, the authors show that PtOEP has its effect originating mostly from triplet sensitization by converting the singlet excitons in MEH-PPV to triplet excitons instead of generating current by direct light absorption, much like one of the possibilities in the Ir(ppy)3:NPD system previously discussed, as the EQE profile does not change with doping.60 This can only occur by correctly matching singlet and triplet energy states in the dopant (PtOEP) and host (MEH-PPV), and resulted in doubled exciton diffusion lengths (up to 5 nm in the doped case versus 2 nm undoped), consistent with the studies of the SY polymer.68

Layered solar cells based on P3HT/C60 have also been shown to have increased efficiency with a platinum–porphyrin complex sensitizer having a dendrimeric structure (Fig. 4).71 This particular sensitizer was chosen due to improved solution processability and film-forming properties and its use resulted in JSC = 4.2 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.4 V, FF = 0.41 and PCE = 0.70% compared to the lower values of neat P3HT: JSC = 2.5 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.2 V, FF = 0.32 and PCE = 0.17%. Interestingly, devices made with neat Pt-dendrimer had worse performance than neat P3HT, showing the value of doping in this case.
3.3 Other sensitizers
The addition of iron (II, III) oxide nanoparticles to P3HT/PCBM blends has been shown to increase PCE and FF by up to 11 and 12%, respectively, with the effect attributed to ISC.70 The maximum PCE (3.37%) and FF were reached with the addition of 0.6 wt% of the nanoparticles. While at low doping levels the nanoparticles cause diffusion current to dominate, further increasing the weight percentage of the conductive nanoparticles created alternate pathways, causing a large current leakage to arise. This is supported by an increase in the effective exciton lifetime as measured by photoluminescence measurements, while keeping morphology intact as shown by grazing-incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) measurements.
Scherf et al. studied a system where trace amount (∼100 ppm) of palladium covalently linked to a diphenyl-substituted ladder-type poly(para-phenylene) (PhLPPP) produced triplet excitons.69,72 The trace Pd is a result of synthetic conditions, being incorporated during the attachment of the phenyl group to the polymeric backbone, which may represent a synthetic route for other triplet-sensitized polymers.73 By comparing BHJs using PCBM and based on the Pd-sensitized PhLPPP and the Pd-free MeLPPP, the dimethyl-substituted version of the polymer, the authors showed that introducing triplet states greatly improved JSC and led to over 300% improvement of PCE (0.23%) (Fig. 9). The diffusion of the triplet states was found to be independent of temperature and the LD was later determined to be as high as 1–4 μm.15 Even though PhLPPP is a wide bandgap polymer with electron and hole mobilities lower than P3HT, these studies provide a different strategy for sensitization and show the value of covalently attaching a spin–orbit coupling center to the main donor material.

4. Donor materials containing heavy atoms
In contrast with blending a singlet material with a triplet sensitizer, molecules with heavy atoms and strong spin–orbit coupling can be used directly as the main donors in OPVs to generate triplet states. The most common approaches for this strategy involve using either metal-containing small molecules or metal-containing polymers.
4.1 Metal-containing small molecules
Lane et al. have studied the effect of altering the metal centres in metallophthalocyanine (MPc, in Fig. 4) electron donors containing group 10 metals (Ni, Pd, Pt) in planar heterojunctions using fullerene as the electron acceptor.74 Using heavier metal centers resulted in a slightly blue-shifted absorption spectrum as the d-orbitals of the metal expand and overlap better with phthalocyanine π-orbitals, but with similar absorptivities through 200 to 1000 nm. The change in metal also altered device performances with MPc layers of 20 nm leading to PCE values of 0.7%, 2.2% and 1.5% for NiPc, PdPc and PtPc, respectively, consistent with the change in JSC from 4.90 to 9.35 and 7.56 mA cm−2, despite NiPc having the highest hole mobilities. The PdPc-based device was also more efficient than one made with the more common CuPc (PCE = 1.4%, JSC = 4.27 mA cm−2). This higher efficiency can be related to spin–orbit coupling which leads to longer lived excitons and an improved JSC. The LD for a similar planar device based on PdPc was determined by EQE modelling as 10.1 nm, compared to around 6 nm for Cu, Zn and Pt phthalocyanines.75 The unexpected LD for the heavier PtPc was assigned to trap states created by impurities which also decrease hole mobility and affected negatively the efficiency.
Molecules that are commonly used as dopants have also been used as the bulk donor material in heterojunctions that wish to generate triplet excitons. Based on the high phosphorescence efficiency of PtOEP and its success as an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) material, Shao and Yang used PtOEP in a layered architecture with C60 as the acceptor material (Fig. 10).33 The devices fabricated had all parameters improved after annealing at 100 °C for 1 h under N2 and achieved VOC = 0.66 V, JSC = 5.6 mA cm−2, FF = 0.57 and PCE = 2.1% (Fig. 11). The low PCE can be associated with the low carrier mobility in the PtOEP, which is consistent with the decrease to 1.2% PCE without annealing as the morphology is worsened. The optimized PtOEP layer thickness was 30 nm, which serves as an estimate of the diffusion length of the excitons in this material. This value agrees with the LD of other metal-containing small molecules determined by Forrest et al. through photoluminescence experiments, although this same group arrived later to a triplet exciton diffusion length of 18 nm for monomeric PtOEP based on spectrally-resolved PL quenching.40,65

Different iridium compounds have also been used as donor materials in BHJs with PCBM but had their efficiency limited by hole mobility.64,76 Overall, these studies and the others presented in this section reveal that charge mobility is a common problem when using heavy atom-containing small molecules and that the improvement of exciton diffusion length in detriment of other parameters can be disadvantageous.
4.2 Metal-containing polymers
The combination of efficient triplet generation of some organometallic complexes with the processability and tunable bandgap of polymers can be very interesting as the versatility for polymer engineering is enormous. Copolymerization allows metals to be integrated into different polymeric backbones to introduce ISC, though the synthesis of new polymers may be arduous and can lead to unexpected efficiencies.

4.2.1 Polymers with platinum. 
Schanze et al. have shown that cyclometallated platinum auxochromes with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) have high ISC rates (kisc ∼ 7.4 × 109 s−1) and used these molecules to generate triplet states in polymer solar cells.34,77–79 Polymers where Pt is linked to the main chain through a 2-phenylpyridine (Poly-DPP-Ph-Pt) or a 2-thienopyridine (Poly-DPP-Th-Pt) unit (Fig. 12a) were synthesized and compared to metallated and unmetallated monomers.78 BHJs based on Poly-DPP-Th-Pt had peak PCE at 1.77% (JSC = 3.79 mA cm−2, FF = 0.64) with a polymer to PCBM ratio of 1:7 while Poly-DPP-Ph-Pt gave a maximum PCE of 0.65% (JSC = 1.61 mA cm−2, FF = 0.41), with a PCBM ratio of 1:3 (Fig. 12b). The difference in the PCE between the two polymers can be explained by a more intense and red-shifted absorption for Poly-DPP-Th-Pt (Fig. 12c), in addition to poor nanoscale phase separation with PCBM for Poly-DPP-Ph-Pt, leading to worse BHJ morphology.

The effect of platinum auxochromes covalently linked to isoindigo chromophores in oligomers and polymers (Iin-C18-Poly, shown in Fig. 13a) was also studied.79 BHJs of Iin-C18-Poly with PCBM in ratios of 1:1, 1:3 and 1:6 showed a gradual increase in efficiency from 0.04% to 0.12% and 0.21%, following an increase in FF from 0.23 to 0.30 and 0.35 (Fig. 13b). The increase in PCE with the ratio of PCBM can be related to changes in morphology as the root mean square surface roughness decreased from 4.4 to 0.9 nm (5 μm resolution) with an increase in PCBM. However, the overall efficiencies were limited by a small LUMO offset (measured by cyclic voltammetry) between Iin-C18-Poly and PCBM leading to a low driving force for singlet exciton dissociation and a triplet energy level in Iin-C18-Poly that is too low for charge generation. This suggests that these molecules would require a different electron acceptor or could be better employed as electron acceptors themselves in OPVs.

Platinum polyynes have also been synthesized and utilized in OPV devices but leading to different results depending on the final polymer. Schanze et al. have copolymerized a bis(tri-butylphosphine)palladium-ethynylene with thiophene (p-PtTh, in Fig. 16) leading to a polymer showing both fluorescence (436 nm) and phosphorescence (608 nm), based on the high ISC rate for the platinum monomer (kisc > 1011 s−1).34 In solution, the authors could measure the lifetime of the triplet state as 5.8 μs and its quenching by PCBM as it promotes either energy or electron transfer. In addition, p-PtTh was used as a chromophore and a donor material in conjunction with the PCBM acceptor as the active layer in organic solar cells. A 1:5 blend of p-PtTh:PCBM was tested at various thicknesses, giving its peak performance at 43 nm with a PCE of 0.27% and a FF of 0.43.
On the other hand, Chan et al. synthesized similar polymers with varying thiophene chain lengths (Fig. 14a) where no phosphorescence is observed.80 Increasing the number of thiophene rings led to a decrease in bandgap (2.40 eV for no thiophene and 2.06 eV for three linked thiophenes per repeat unit) and an increase in emission wavelength, as expected by a longer conjugation length. The fluorescence wavelength observed was also highly dependent on the solvent used (solvatochromism), providing evidence for the authors' claim that in this case the platinum complex acts as an absorption enhancer by promoting a transition dependent on charge-transfer, while the increased conjugation length would improve the overall sunlight absorption.81,82 In fact, the change in number of thiophene rings from zero to three resulted in an increase in the PCE from 0.21% to 2.50% and corresponding FF of 0.32 to 0.44 in BHJs with a 1:4 ratio of donor to PCBM. Additionally, the increase in thiophene content within the donor material led to significant increase in both electron and hole mobility (Fig. 14b and c), in line with the poor hole mobilities observed for organometallic complexes, showing that increasing the platinum content in polymers does not always lead to an increase in efficiency.33,76

4.2.2 Polymers with iridium. 
Iridium complexes can be tethered to the main chain of the conjugated polymer to improve ISC. Holdcroft et al. studied the effect of binding iridium to 2-phenylpyridine, comparing poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene-co-2-phenylpyridine) (PFPP), to poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-co-tris(2-phenylpyridine)iridium-(III)) (Ir-PFPP) (Fig. 15a), in a system that can be related to the use of Ir(ppy)3 as a sensitizer.32,60,61,83 The PL lifetime of Ir-PFPP was measured to be 0.26 μs, consistent with other iridium-containing polyfluorene copolymers, which demonstrate a decreasing phosphorescence lifetime with increasing iridium content.84 Using a BHJ formed by a 1:4 ratio between either of the polymers and PCBM, the authors show a PCE improvement by a factor of 35 from 0.002% without iridium to 0.07% in its presence, despite a decrease in FF from 0.24 to 0.19 (Fig. 15c). As expected for the presence of triplet excitons, JSC was increased from 0.01 mA cm−2 to 0.44 mA cm−2 in addition to a slight increase in VOC from 0.60 V to 0.63 V. The broad PL spectra (Fig. 15b) observed for both polymers shows a PFPP peak associated with fluorescence (singlet states), while the Ir-PFPP has a phosphorescence peak (triplets states). The complete quenching of the Ir-PFPP phosphorescence in devices with PCBM suggests electron or energy transfer from the Ir-PFPP excited state to the PCBM. Although the PCE is small, the authors suggest that the poor performance is related to the low absorption cross section of the polymers, even when Ir is attached, which leads to absorption of 74% of incident light at short wavelengths (350 nm).

4.3 Other donors
The introduction of heavier halogens covalently bound to a chromophore has been shown to promote ISC and can also help improve crystallinity by halogen–halogen interactions.85,86 As a result of triplet formation, the lifetime of singlet states has been shown to decrease in metal-free carbomethoxyphenyl porphyrins with the replacement of carbomethoxyphenyl groups by bromophenyl and, especially, iodophenyl (Fig. 16).37 Devices using PCBM as the acceptor, however, showed decreased efficiency with increased triplet population due to mismatch of the triplet energy levels in the porphyrins with the LUMO of PCBM.
 Fig. 16  Molecular structure of additional donor materials mentioned. 
The same heavy atom concept can be applied directly to polythiophenes by replacing sulfur with heavier selenium and tellurium atoms.87–92 This strategy has the goal of enhancing ISC, but also leads to improved absorption and crystallinity. A transient absorption technique based on broadband pump-probe has been able to detect formation of triplet states in both selenium and tellurium analogues, consistent with the fluorescence quenching as spin–orbit coupling is increased by the increase of atomic mass.93 On a side note, triplet excitons have been identified in tellurophene-containing acceptors with diffusion length of approximately 34 nm.94 Furthermore, platinum polyynes have been synthesized with thiophene, selenophene and tellurophene comonomers, showing a redshift in absorption and PL with the increase in atomic weight of the heteroatom (however a decrease in phosphorescence intensity was noted).95
5. Overcoming challenges associated with triplet materials
Thus far in this review, the trend of increasing JSC and PCE through enhancement of LD was highlighted. However, it is notable that the determination of LD directly in OPV devices shows only small increases in overall diffusion length (Table 1). These values are still not satisfying and differ greatly from measurements of diffusion under more controlled conditions or from the determination of LD associated with only triplet excitons.9,15,47 This shows that this research field still has room to grow and faces challenges that it must overcome in order to improve device efficiency. In this section we discuss energetic requirements for the use of triplet materials and the main challenges associated with them, which can help explain the low values of LD and offer strategies for material design.

5.1 Energetic requirements and maintaining VOC
One of the first requirements for any material in OPVs is correct energy matching for the dissociation of excitons into free charge carriers.3,4 Although research on exciton dissociation at a p–n junction is still evolving, the intermediate formation of a charge-transfer (CT) exciton, where the exciton is located across the interface, seems to play an important role in dissociation. Therefore, when using triplet materials, the triplet exited state must be higher in energy than that of CT excitons for energy transfer to be possible (Fig. 17). Care must be taken when matching donors and acceptors with a small LUMO offset because a potential barrier may be created for the dissociation of triplets.79 When using triplet sensitizers, it is also important to match the triplet energy levels of the sensitizer (Ts1) and host (Th1), following Sh1 > Ss1 > Ts1 > Th1, where Sh1 and Ss1 are the singlet excited state energies. This energy order would allow for both singlets generated in the host to be converted to triplets and triplet injection directly from the sensitizer into the host.60
 Fig. 17  Schematic representation of energetic requirements for successful usage of triplet materials. Blue arrows represent excitation, green arrows are energy transfer and black arrows are intersystem crossing (ISC). ISC can happen between Sh1–Th1 if the host contains heavy elements. 1CT and 3CT are the singlet and triplet charge-transfer excitons, respectively, and FC represents free charge carriers. With Th1 > 3CT, the energy back transfer is unlikely. The CT states are dissociated into FC under thermal excitation (kBT). 
It is also important to note that, while triplet excitons have lower energy than their singlet counterparts, the final VOC is not necessarily affected by this difference. This is due to VOC being strongly associated with the energy of CT while the singlet and triplet states of CT (1CT and 3CT) are almost degenerate in energy.21,96–98 Thus when comparing singlet and triplet excitons in a system where the CT state is already below the triplet energy, the final energy of a charge transfer exciton is the same and the VOC may remain the same. In fact, several studies reviewed here report no significant change in VOC upon sensitization of the singlet donor.32,60,61,63,68 An advantage of these energetic requirements is that the triplet exciton back-formation from CT states to the donor material is blocked and would not be an efficiency loss pathway, as has been identified in different devices.21,22,97
5.2 Mobility and lifetime of excitons and charge carriers in triplet materials
In contrast to singlet excitons, triplets move mainly via Dexter energy transfer, requiring close contact between molecules and orbital overlap to diffuse.8,9,99 That is why covalently linking a triplet sensitizer to its host facilitates sensitization as well as avoids energy transfer directly from sensitizer to the unbound acceptor.48,69 This difference can also help explain why sensitization of singlet hosts does not lead to much greater LD, since maintaining the same film morphology and crystallinity level from the neat host may not provide high enough triplet mobility (D in eqn (1)). Disorder in the film can strongly impact the diffusion of excitons and the highest LD values reported for triplets are related to more rigid aromatic molecules, such as acenes, with high crystallinity.9,14,16,100
When comparing LD of acenes (∼μm) to that of neat organometallic films (∼nm) there is also a big difference related to lower triplet mobility and reduced triplet lifetime in organometallic films, as the enhancement of ISC by the heavy atoms to generate triplets also leads to shorter lifetimes.40,101 This points to the doping of rigid conjugated molecules and polymers as a better strategy to enhance both mobility and lifetime. Doping becomes even more interesting when we consider that poor charge carrier mobilities are frequently reported for the use of neat organometallic small molecules and that the increase of metal content in Pt polyynes is also associated with decrease in charge mobility.18,19
Keeping the points mentioned above in mind, the results obtained by Scherf et al. with a dopant covalently bound to a polymer chain can provide a good strategy to increase LD.15 Due to the rigid fused core of PhLPPP (Fig. 4), the authors show high diffusion coefficients (10−6 to 10−5 cm2 s−1), approaching those of rigid small molecules (∼10−4 cm2 s−1), to achieve a triplet LD of 4 μm.40 Increasing the molecular weight of the polymer increased D due to the strong orbital overlap within the chain. This allows the exciton to travel through the polymer in quasi-one-dimensional paths until being quenched by the acceptor, showing less hoping between polymer chains when the polymer is longer. Similarly, an increase in the energetic barrier for ring-torsion has also shown to significantly increase charge mobility in analogues of polythiophene.102 Core rigidity, high polymer molecular weight and triplet generation at the polymer chain is a promising combination for triplet photovoltaics, with the problem of PhLPPP being its relatively wide bandgap and poor charge mobility.
Enhanced charge mobility improves charge collection efficiencies in solar cells. The popular phosphorescent dopant (ppy)2Ir(acac) has a very low hole drift mobility of 2.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1,103 due to which it is a poor host matrix for the active layer in electroluminescent as well as photovoltaic devices. Phosphorescent materials with higher carrier mobilities are therefore required. Wang et al. reported [bis(4,6-di-fluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2′]iridium(N,N′-diisopropylbenzamidine) ((Fppy)2-Ir(dipba)), that shows high carrier mobilities of ∼10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, along with well-matched energy levels with hole and electron transporting layers.103 Another family of compounds which have shown promise in this regard, are the small molecule and polymeric tellurophenes.104 Small molecule tellurophenes can be solution processed into highly crystalline, p-type semiconducting thin films with hole mobilities of ∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1.105 Isoindigo–tellurophene polymers and tellurophene-diketopyrrolopyrrole polymers have been shown to have hole mobilities in the range 0.07–1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1.106
5.3 Triplet–triplet annihilation
The encounter of two triplet excitons to generate a single high energy singlet exciton through triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) is another problem that must be considered.8 These encounters have been shown to decrease diffusion lengths but not much attention has been given to TTA in photovoltaics, as most systems are based on singlet materials.46,47 TTA becomes important as the density of triplets increases so it is a barrier that triplet photovoltaics inevitably has to face. In this scenario, the use of techniques to probe the dynamics of triplets in devices, such as PIA and TAS can be valuable. Additionally, Curtin and Holmes have recently developed a method to determine if exciton–exciton annihilation is impacting OPV performance through voltage measurements under varied illumination intensities.29
To reduce TTA, it is possible to draw applicable strategies from several studies focusing on its effects in OLEDs, the main strategies being: (1) reduce the density of triplet excitons,107,108 (2) reduce the lifetime of the triplets28,109 or (3) reduce their mobility.46,110 All these aim at decreasing the chance of triplet encounter. Strategy (1) is possible if the solar cell is operated at low irradiation power or if the triplets are quickly dissociated after their creation. The problem is that (2) and (3) go against the goal of increasing LD (eqn (1)). It could be possible to keep high exciton mobilities while reducing the chance of their encounter if using systems such as polymers with a backbone that affords high triplet mobility and side-chains that diminish their intermolecular interactions.15,111 However, reduction of TTA can be a formidable challenge when the goal is using triplet materials for photovoltaics as one would hope for materials with strong sunlight absorption and efficient triplet generation in this context.
5.4 Use of techniques specifically for triplet excitons
Lastly, it must be pointed out that most LD values determined in solar cells (Table 1) were based on thickness optimization and performance modelling. While such methods are more accessible, they reflect only an overall diffusion length of excitons, considering both singlets and triplets, and do not give clear information on how triplets are being generated or diffusing on the devices. The use of more specific techniques for triplets (Section 2) can provide more insight and allow for further material optimization. Techniques that do not depend on luminescence are especially powerful since they allow for the determination of triplet LD in sensitized hosts that do not possess strong phosphorescence, having long lived triplet states with possibly large values of diffusion length.
6. Summary of device performances

Table 2 and 3 summarize the main studies covered in this review paper. Despite the overall low values of PCE shown when compared to high-performing organic solar cells based on singlet materials, there is a clear trend of increased efficiency when triplet excitons are introduced, which should lead to much greater efficiencies provided further device engineering and optimization. It should also be noted that many of these studies use simple device architectures to allow for better comparison and frequently do not have state-of-the-art efficiencies when using common unsensitized materials as a basis for this comparison.59,71

7. Conclusion
The generation of triplet excitons has been shown to increase the overall exciton diffusion length and lead to increased performance in both bulk heterojunctions and planar organic solar cells. Although the overall efficiencies outlined in this review are relatively low, triplet photovoltaics clearly show advantages to the purely singlet materials even if most of the work is still in the initial stages of development.
The use of triplet sensitizers in low loadings with correct matching of energy levels has shown to affect minimally the morphology of the host while leading to an increase in LD and PCE. Additionally, while the use of neat triplet donor materials has faced problems with charge transport, organometallic compounds can be integrated into polymeric chains through copolymerization with a large degree of synthetic flexibility to allow for a balance between triplet formation and charge mobility.
The small improvements in LD when employing triplet materials do show, however, that the field faces challenges and has room to grow. The strong dependence of triplet mobility on crystallinity may explain the low LD when sensitizing singlet materials. In this case, the use of the experimental techniques presented for identification of materials with long diffusion lengths along with promising photovoltaic properties is highly important. Additionally, the current extent of triplet–triplet annihilation and its effect on the systems presented is yet to be determined. Employing materials with correctly matched energy levels for the use of triplet excitons while attempting to tackle these issues to achieve high PCE can provide different research avenues for the future. The use of experimental techniques that can probe triplet state dynamics and diffusion is especially important not only to determine LD, but to understand triplet exciton limitations in photovoltaic devices and more accurately devise strategies to improve efficiency.

 	Fig. 1  Experimental determination of LD. Donor material is represented in blue; acceptor in orange (a) thickness optimization and performance modelling: L is optimized and L ≈ LD is assumed or OPV output (e.g. EQE) is fitted to calculate LD. (b) TDPL and SRPL quenching: luminescence (blue arrow) and lifetime decrease if L ≤ LD. (c) SRPL quenching: difference in distribution of excitons determined through PL with a blocking layer (non-quenching) and with a quenching layer on top allows determination of LD. (d) Indirect luminescence: non-emissive triplets travel through the sample to decay radiatively in the acceptor. Excitons can be created directly in the donor layer or injected from another material (green), with the acceptor PL intensity depending on LD. (e) PIA and TAS: absorption spectroscopy of triplets further excited in the triplet manifold to determine number of triplets and their quenching dynamics. Microwave photoconductivity: change in number of free charge carriers determined and related to excitons dissociation and LD.

 	Fig. 6  Photoluminescence (PL) intensity measurements for NPD (a) and CBP (b) doped with Ir(ppy)3.

Singlet states generated in the NPD can be converted to triplets by the dopant and be transferred back to NPD, leading to long-lived states and low PL, but in CBP, the dopant acts as a singlet sink and increasing its concentration leads to phosphorescence from Ir(ppy)3.

 	Fig. 17  Schematic representation of energetic requirements for successful usage of triplet materials. Blue arrows represent excitation, green arrows are energy transfer and black arrows are intersystem crossing (ISC). ISC can happen between Sh1–Th1 if the host contains heavy elements. 1CT and 3CT are the singlet and triplet charge-transfer excitons, respectively, and FC represents free charge carriers. With Th1 > 3CT, the energy back transfer is unlikely. The CT states are dissociated into FC under thermal excitation (kBT).
