    , Accepted 29th March 2018First published on 29th March 2018AbstractTwo non-fullerene acceptors with selenophene π bridges to link the indacenodithiophene (IDT) core and 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (IC) or difluorinated IC (2F-IC) terminals, i.e.IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F, were synthesized. IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F have low optical band gaps (Eoptg) of 1.45 and 1.39 eV, respectively. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on them were fabricated with the wide band gap polymer PBDB-T as the donor. A wide photo-current response extending to 850 and 900 nm was observed for the IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F based devices, respectively. Besides, the PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend film exhibited higher electron mobility and more balanced hole and electron transport ascribed to the higher packing order of IDT2Se-4F in the blends and a proper phase-separated morphology. As a result, the IDT2Se-4F based devices delivered a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.19% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.79 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 21.49 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 65.9%, whereas the devices based on IDT2Se showed a lower maximum PCE of 9.36%.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on the blend films of electron-donor and electron-acceptor materials have attracted considerable attention due to their low cost, light weight, and great potential in making flexible and large-area solar cell panels through low-cost coating methods.1–3 In an OSC device where solar energy is converted into electric energy, the application of photoactive materials with broad absorption spectra is deemed one of the key methods to promote power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).4–6 Since about 50% of solar radiation energy rests in the near-infrared (NIR) region, the development of NIR-absorbing organic semiconductors with optical band gaps (Eoptg) below 1.5 eV (corresponding to an absorption onset of 825 nm) is desirable for efficiently absorbing solar radiation.7–13 Besides, the NIR-absorbing photoactive materials demonstrated great potential in tandem OSCs and semitransparent OSCs.8,10,11,14–18
For a long time, fullerene derivatives have been prevailing acceptor materials in OSCs, though they exhibit limited absorption in the visible and the NIR region. Donor materials thus have to play the main role in absorbing photons in the OSC blend film. Over the past decade, many donor materials with absorption spectra extending to the NIR region have been designed and applied to OSCs. However, the active layers based on fullerene acceptors and NIR absorbing donors presented relatively weak absorption in the visible region in most cases, and large energy loss generally exists in these OSCs. The above disadvantages limit further the enhancement of PCEs of OSCs based on NIR absorbing donors and fullerene acceptors.
Recently, Zhan et al. developed a new type of non-fullerene acceptor with polycyclic aromatics such as indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) as central units and the strong electron-withdrawing group 3-(dicyanomethylidene)indan-1-one (IC) as terminals.19–23 This kind of acceptor exhibited tunable energy levels, a large absorption coefficient and proper aggregation properties as well as low energy loss in OSCs. The PCEs of binary OSCs were boosted to ∼13% as a result of optimised optical and electronic properties via molecular engineering.24–26 Typically, these state-of-the-art non-fullerene acceptors display Eoptg above 1.55 eV (absorption onsets below 800 nm), and wide band gap polymer donors were used in device fabrication to compensate their absorption.27–32
To push the photo-response of OSCs to the NIR region, several non-fullerene acceptors with Eoptg < 1.50 eV have been reported, as shown in Fig. 1. IHIC,17,33 FOIC,34 BT-IC35 and COi8DFC,36 which comprise electron-richer polycyclic central units than IDTT, presented low Eoptg of 1.38, 1.32, 1.43 and 1.26 eV, respectively. Among them, COi8DFC based binary OSCs achieved a high Jsc of 26.12 mA cm−2 and a PCE exceeding 12%. Alternatively, introducing electron-rich aromatic alkoxylthiophene (IEICO,37 IEICO-4F38 and IEICO-4Cl18) or thieno[3,4-b]thiophene with quinoidal character (ATT-2)39 as a π spacer between IDC central units and IC terminals is a facile and efficient approach to lower the Eoptg to ∼1.3 eV. Relatively lower PCEs of ∼10% were obtained for binary OSCs. Nevertheless, non-fullerene acceptors characterized by low band gaps and ease of synthesis are still highly desirable for OSC applications.

Selenophene is an analogue of thiophene with selenium replacing the sulfur atom. Selenophene-based molecules/polymers always have lower band gaps than their thiophene counterparts, because selenophene can stabilize the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level more effectively.40–44 Moreover, selenium is more polarizable than sulfur, which might induce intermolecular Se–Se interaction and thus improve the charge carrier mobility.41,45 Thereby, in the current paper, two non-fullerene acceptors, i.e., IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F as shown in Fig. 2a, were synthesized by using selenophene as a π spacer to link the central IDT unit and the terminal IC or 2F-IC units. As expected, two molecules display low Eoptg of 1.45 and 1.39 eV, respectively. Conventional OSCs were fabricated with a wide band gap polymer, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di(2-thienyl)-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-di-one))] (PBDB-T, Fig. 2a), as the donor, and PCEs of 9.36% and 11.19% were achieved for IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F, respectively.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic route to IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4T is shown in Fig. 2b. Microwave-assisted Stille coupling of compound 1 and 5-bromoselenophene-2-carbaldehyde afforded compound 2 in a yield of 73%. Subsequent Knoevenagel condensations gave IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F in yields over 80%. The chemical structures of IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F were verified by NMR spectra (Fig. S1–S6†), matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectra (Fig. S7–S9†) and elemental analyses.
Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) indicate that both IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F have good thermal stability with 5% weight loss temperatures (Td) at 350 and 338 °C, respectively (Fig. S10†). No obvious thermal transitions were observed for IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F in their differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) scans in the range of 25–300 °C (Fig. S11†), possibly since their melting points are higher than Td.
Crystal structure analysis
Single crystals of IDT2Se-4F suitable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were successfully obtained for exploring the geometry and packing behavior of the molecule. The crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1.† The ORTEP drawings are shown in Fig. 3a. IDT2Se-4F shows a slightly-twisted conjugated backbone together with centrosymmetry characteristics. The dihedral angles are 12° between selenophene and the IDT unit and 2° between IDT and 2F-IC units. The four bulky hexylphenyl groups lie outside the plane of the conjugated backbone. Fig. 3b–d show the packing diagrams of IDT2Se-4F. Two-dimensional (2D) intermolecular interactions parallel to the ac plane (Fig. 3b) and the grid-like packing structures of conjugated backbones in the ab plane (Fig. 3c) can be found. For clearly expounding the packing motif, the basic packing mesogens are illustrated in Fig. 3d. The molecule 1 aligns parallel to molecules 2 and 3 while intersects with molecules 4 and 5. The degree of translation of these molecules is displayed in the pink images and the large intermolecular π–π overlap is indicated by the shorter longitudinal (including selenophene and the terminal 2F-IC units) and negligible transverse shift. Among them, molecules 1 and 2 (3) form π–π stacking with an interplanar separation of 3.33 Å, and the shortest C⋯C distance of 3.38 Å exists between molecules 1 and 4 (5). The formation of a tight 2D transport network is beneficial for exciton diffusion and charge transport.

Density functional theory calculations
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level were applied to evaluate the distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the two molecules (Fig. 4). For both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) mainly distribute along the IDT core and selenophene spacers, while the LUMOs delocalize over the entire molecules with higher density at the end groups. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of IDT2Se-4F are 0.12 and 0.15 eV lower than those of IDT2Se, respectively, owing to the introduction of four F atoms.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The solution and film UV-vis-NIR absorption spectra of IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F are illustrated in Fig. 5, and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. In solution, IDT2Se shows an absorption maximum (λsmax) at 722 nm. IDT2Se-4F displays a slightly red-shifted solution absorption spectrum with a maximum at 737 nm. From solution to film, red-shifted absorption and more obvious vibronic absorption peaks are observed for both molecules. Besides, compared with the IDT2Se film, the IDT2Se-4F film exhibits broader and much more red-shifted absorption with a maximum at 789 nm, indicative of the stronger intermolecular interaction of IDT2Se-4F in solid. Eoptg estimated from the film absorption onset is 1.45 eV for IDT2Se and 1.39 eV for IDT2Se-4F, which are lower than that of the molecule DC-IDT2T (Eoptg = 1.55 eV) with thiophene as a π spacer.18 The lowering of Eoptg by replacing thiophene with selenophene is consistent with the widely reported results in the literature.39–42

Cyclic voltammograms were recorded to calculate the energy levels of IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F. The potentials were internally calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the molecules were calculated from the redox onset potentials. As shown in Fig. S12† and Table 1, compared with IDT2Se (HOMO = −5.41 eV, LUMO = −3.87 eV), IDT2Se-4F possesses deeper HOMO and LUMO energy levels of −5.51 and −4.00 eV, respectively, which is consistent with the DFT calculation results. This could be ascribed to the introduction of four electron-withdrawing F atoms in the terminals of IDT2Se-4F.
Photovoltaic properties
The wide band gap polymer donor PBDB-T has suitable energy levels and complementary absorption with acceptors IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F. The blend films presented broad and efficient absorption in the region from 300 to ∼900 nm (Fig. S13†). Thereby, the OSCs using PBDB-T as the donor, and IDT2Se or IDT2Se-4F as the acceptor were fabricated with a device configuration of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopene):polystyrenesulphonate (PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/PDINO/Al, where PDINO is a cathode interlayer material (see Fig. S14†) developed by Li et al.46 The detailed device data obtained from different fabrication conditions, including donor/acceptor weight ratios, active layer thicknesses and post treatments, are outlined in Table S2–S4.† The optimized devices were fabricated by using chlorobenzene as the processing solvent with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 and an active-layer thickness of ∼110 nm. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 6a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. The device based on the PBDB-T:IDT2Se blend film without any post-treatment showed a PCE of 8.91% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.89 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 17.08 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 58.6%. The device based on PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F showed a PCE of 9.84% with a Voc of 0.81 V, a Jsc of 19.28 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.0%. The lower Voc of the IDT2Se-4F based device is derived from its lower LUMO energy level (−4.00 eV) than that (−3.87 eV) of IDT2Se. The devices based on both acceptors displayed relatively low FF, probably because there is not enough time for the acceptors to form good molecular packing during the film drying process. Thus, the active layers were treated by solvent vapor annealing (SVA) and thermal annealing (TA) to facilitate the molecular packing. The Jsc and FF of the devices based on the PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend film with chloroform SVA for 90 s were enhanced to 20.75 mA cm−2 and 64.8%, respectively, resulting in a higher PCE of 10.76%. When the active layer was treated with SVA and then TA at 80 °C for 10 min, the PCE of the devices was further increased to 11.19%, with a Voc of 0.79 V, a Jsc of 21.49 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.9%. The reverse dark saturation current density (Jso) is 1.74 × 10−1 mA cm−2 for IDT2Se-4F based OSCs with SVA and TA treatments, which is higher than that (7.65 × 10−2 mA cm−2) of the device without any treatment (see Fig. S15 and Table S5†). This indicates that the post annealing treatments enhance the intermolecular interaction between the donor and the acceptor in the blend films, thus resulting in a small drop in Voc.47–49 The IDT2Se-based devices with SVA and TA treatments also presented slightly increased FF and Jsc, thus an improved PCE (9.36%). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the best performing devices based on IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F are shown in Fig. 6b. The IDT2Se-4F based device exhibited a broader photo-to-current response range of 300–900 nm, compared with that (300–850 nm) of the IDT2Se based device, which is consistent with the narrower band gap of IDT2Se-4F. Besides, the EQE of the device based on IDT2Se-4F was higher than that of the IDT2Se based device, and the maximum EQE values of IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F based devices reached 63% and 71%, respectively. The calculated Jsc obtained from EQE curves were 16.54 and 20.33 mA cm−2 for IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F based devices, respectively, which are in accordance with those (17.41 mA cm−2 for the IDT2Se based device, and 21.49 mA cm−2 for the IDT2Se-4F based device) extracted from J–V curves within an acceptable deviation of ∼5%.

The stability of unencapsulated devices was preliminarily tested. The photostability of the devices was validated in an argon-filled glove box under continuous illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The devices based on IDT2Se-4F exhibited greater photostability. After illumination for 57 h, PCEs were dropped to ∼85% and ∼65% of initial values for the devices based on IDT2Se-4F and IDT2Se, respectively (Fig. S16†). The devices based on IDT2Se-4F also showed better thermal stability. After heating at 100 °C for 57 h in an argon atmosphere, the devices based on IDT2Se-4F and IDT2Se retained ∼31% and ∼15% of their initial PCEs, respectively (Fig. S17†). The device performance degraded rapidly in air for both acceptors (Fig. S18†), which can be ascribed to the diffusion of oxygen and water into the unencapsulated devices.50,51
To further understand the photovoltaic performance of IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F based devices, the effective voltage (Veff) dependent photocurrent density (Jph) was measured and is displayed in Fig. 6c. With increasing Veff, the saturation photocurrent density (Jph,sat) in the device based on IDT2Se-4F was reached earlier than that in the device based on IDT2Se. Under short circuit conditions, the values of Jph/Jph,sat were 87% and 93% for the devices based on IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F, respectively. Under the maximal power output conditions, the Jph/Jph,sat ratios of IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F based devices were 70% and 80%, respectively. These results suggest that both processes of exciton dissociation and charge collection were more efficient for the device based on IDT2Se-4F. The carrier mobility of the blend films was measured by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, and the results are shown in Fig. S19 and Table S6.† The hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of the PBDB-T:IDT2Se blend films without any post treatment were 1.02 × 10−4 and 0.33 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and μh and μe were enhanced to 1.52 × 10−4 and 0.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for the films with SVA and TA treatments. Similar to PBDB-T:IDT2Se blend films, after SVA and TA treatments, PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend films also presented increased μh and μe, which were 1.76 × 10−4 and 1.34 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for the films without any post-treatment and 2.08 × 10−4 and 1.64 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, for the films with SVA and TA. Compared with IDT2Se blends (μh/μe = 3.17), IDT2Se-4F blends showed higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities (μh/μe = 1.27) and thus a higher FF in the OSCs, which is related to the film morphology and molecular packing, as discussed in detail below.
Film microstructures and morphology
The morphology of PBDB-T:IDT2Se and PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend films was first investigated using an atomic force microscope (AFM). As shown in Fig. 7a–d, all blend films were smooth and uniform. Without any post treatment, the PBDB-T:IDT2Se and PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend films showed root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of 2.72 ± 0.05 and 2.20 ± 0.06 nm, respectively. For the films with SVA and TA treatments, the RMS roughness slightly decreased to 1.76 ± 0.05 nm for PBDB-T:IDT2Se and 2.13 ± 0.04 nm for PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F. As revealed by the AFM phase images (Fig. 7e–h), nano-scale phase separation was observed for both blends. After SVA and TA treatments, more obvious fiber-like nanostructures were observed for both PBDB-T:IDT2Se and PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend films, which are beneficial for charge transport. In addition, the PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend films exhibited better interpenetrating networks of donor and acceptor phases compared to their PBDB-T:IDT2Se counterparts. The film morphology of PBDB-T:IDT2Se and PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F was also investigated using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). As shown in Fig. 7i–l, a similar morphology evolution trend was observed: PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blends showed more distinct interpenetrating networks, and more obvious and denser fibrous nanostructures were observed for both blends after SVA and TA treatments. Above results are consistent with the higher photovoltaic performance of the devices based on the annealed PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend. Besides, no obvious morphology change was observed for the blend films of both IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F after continuous light illumination and thermal annealing (Fig. S19†).
 Fig. 7  AFM height (a–d) and phase (e–h) and TEM (i–l) images of PBDB-T:IDT2Se blend films (a, b, e, and f) and PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend films (c, d, g, and h) without any treatment (a, c, e, and g), and with SVA and TA treatments (b, d, f, and h). Root-mean-square (RMS) roughnesses of the films corresponding to the images a, b, c and d are 2.72 ± 0.05, 1.76 ± 0.05, 2.20 ± 0.06 and 2.13 ± 0.04 nm, respectively. 
The blend films were also characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 8, PBDB-T:IDT2Se and PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend films exhibited very similar XRD patterns. A relatively strong diffraction peak at 2θ = ∼4.9° and a broad π–π stacking diffraction peak at 2θ = ∼25° were observed in the out-of-plane patterns, while a weak diffraction peak at 2θ = ∼4.0° appeared in the in-plane XRD patterns. In combination with the XRD patterns of the neat films as shown in Fig. S20 and S21,† the small angle diffraction peaks in the in-plane and out-of-plane patterns could be attributed to the diffraction of the acceptors and PBDB-T, respectively, and the broad peak at 2θ = ∼25° in the out-of-plane patterns can be ascribed to the overlapped π–π stacking diffractions of the acceptors and the polymer. This indicates that, in the blend films, the acceptor molecules predominantly adopted face-on arrangement while both edge-on and face-on stacking of conjugated backbones are observed for the polymer. Clearly, compared to the PBDB-T:IDT2Se blend, the PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend showed higher crystallinity as indicated by the stronger diffraction peaks in both in-plane and out-of-plane patterns. After annealing, the π–π stacking diffraction peaks became slightly stronger for both blends. All these results are consistent with the photovoltaic properties of the materials discussed above: PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F exhibited photovoltaic performance superior to PBDB-T:IDT2Se and the annealing process resulted in a slight enhancement in device efficiencies.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized two NIR-absorbing non-fullerene acceptors IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F by introducing selenophene π bridges between the IDT core and the IC or IC-2F terminals. IDT2Se and IDT2Se-4F exhibit low Eoptg of 1.45 and 1.39 eV, respectively. OSCs were fabricated with IDT2Se or IDT2Se-4F as the acceptor and the polymer PBDB-T as the donor. Compared to IDT2Se, IDT2Se-4F exhibited superior device performance because of its lower band gap and the higher and more balanced hole and electron mobilities of the PBDB-T:IDT2Se-4F blend. A maximum PCE of 11.19% has been realized for the devices based on IDT2Se-4F. Our study suggests an effective way for the easy synthesis of low band gap non-fullerene acceptors for high efficiency OSCs.
Experimental
Materials and synthesis
Toluene, chloroform and pyridine were dried and distilled prior to use following standard methods. All chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial sources and used as received unless stated otherwise. PBDB-T (number–average molecular weight: 25.0 kDa, polydispersity index: 2.36) and PDINO were purchased from Solarmer Materials and SunaTech Inc., respectively. Anhydrous o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Compound 1 and 5-bromoselenophene-2-carbaldehyde were synthesized according to the literature.19,52

Compound 2. 
To a reaction tube were added compound 1 (500 mg, 0.405 mmol), 5-bromoselenophene-2-carbaldehyde (242 mg, 1.015 mmol), Pd(PPh3)4 (35.5 mg, 0.00310 mmol) and anhydrous toluene (4.00 mL). The mixture was degassed twice with argon and stirred in a microwave reactor as a dynamic model (170 °C, 150 W) for 1 hour. Then the reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted with CHCl3. The combined organic extracts were dried over anhydrous MgSO4. After evaporating the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 (1:2) as the eluent to afford the product as an orange red solid (360 mg, 73%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): δ 9.72 (s, 2H), 7.86–7.87 (d, J = 4.4 Hz, 2H), 7.42 (s, 2H), 7.38–7.39 (d, J = 4.0 Hz, 2H), 7.21 (s, 2H), 7.13–7.19 (m, 8H), 7.06–7.12 (m, 8H), 2.55–2.59 (t, J = 8.0 Hz, 8H), 1.52–1.65 (m, 8H),1.20–1.40 (m, 24H), 0.84–0.91 (m, 12H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): δ 183.6, 157.3, 157.8, 153.1, 146.9, 143.1, 141.9, 141.2, 141.1, 140.3, 135.2, 128.5, 127.8, 125.5, 122.5, 117.7, 63.1, 35.5, 31.7, 31.3, 29.1, 22.6, 14.1.

          . 
A solution of compound 3a (159 mg, 0.820 mmol) and compound 2 (250 mg, 0.205 mmol) in dry CHCl3 (20 mL) was degassed twice with argon followed by the addition of four drops of pyridine. Then the reaction mixture was stirred at 65 °C for 15 hours. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the residues were purified by column chromatography on Esilica gel with petroleum ether/CH2Cl2 (1:2) as the eluent and then recrystallized with hexane/toluene mixture to afford the product as a black solid (280 mg, 87%). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz, ppm): δ 8.93 (s, 2H), 8.66–8.68 (d, J = 7.2 Hz, 2H), 7.92–7.94 (d, J = 4.8 Hz, 2H), 7.86–7.91 (m, 2H), 7.67–7.78 (m, 4H), 7.45–7.51 (m, 4H), 7.15–7.21 (m, 8H), 7.08–7.15 (m, 8H), 2.52–2.63 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 8H), 1.55–1.66 (m, 8H), 1.23–1.39 (m, 24H), 0.81–0.91 (m, 24H). 13C NMR (CDCl3, 100 MHz, ppm): δ 189.1, 162.0, 160.2, 158.4, 154.4, 149.7, 145.4, 142.1, 141.9, 141.0, 140.7, 139.9, 138.6, 136.7, 135.7, 135.2, 134.4, 128.7, 127.8, 126.7, 125.3, 123.8, 123.7, 121.0, 69.1, 63.2, 35.6, 31.7, 31.3, 29.1, 22.6, 14.1.
