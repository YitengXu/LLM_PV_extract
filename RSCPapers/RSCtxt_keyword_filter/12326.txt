    , Accepted 20th August 2015First published on 21st August 2015AbstractWe demonstrate that solution processed graphene oxide (GO) grafted polyethylenimine ethoxylate (PEIE) is an efficient electron transport layer for organic solar cells with an active layer that consists of poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7) mixed with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM). The optimized GO:PEIE demonstrated the best efficiency of 8.21% compared to that of the GO and PEIE devices.
1 Introduction
Organic solar cells have attracted particular attention due to their low cost, light weight, flexibility, and low temperature fabrication. The PCE of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on poly({4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl}{3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl}) (PTB7) mixed with [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) exceeds 9%.1,2 Recently, a PCE of greater than 11% has been reported using triple-junction architecture that employed wide, medium, and small bandgap polymers as the front, medium, and bottom subcells, respectively.3–5 Although the PCE of triple-junction devices is superior to that of single junction devices, they are difficult to fabricate and optimize. In addition, recent reports on ternary systems where the polymer/polymer/fullerene combinations generally have significant influence on the light absorption range which led to a 21.2% PCE improvement compared to that of normal binary systems.6–8 However, unlike triple-junction and ternary devices, typical single-junction devices are composed of an active layer sandwiched between an indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) positive electrode and a Ca low-work function negative electrode. The frequently used conducting polymer, PEDOT:PSS layer, and low-work-function metal electrode are known to deteriorate the stability of the device. Therefore, the lifetime of this kind of device is a problem because the PEDOT:PSS is hygroscopic and acidic in nature.9,10 Moreover, one must take into account that the 10% optical loss in the visible region, due to absorption of the PEDOT:PSS film, is quite remarkable.11 In order to overcome these drawbacks, many groups have proposed inverted structures of solar cells to take full advantage of the absence of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS interface. In general, a high work function metal is used as a top electrode, while n-type metal oxides such as tin oxide (SnO2), titanium dioxide (TiO2), lithium zinc oxide (LZO), and zinc oxide (ZnO) are used as electron transport layers.12–14 These ETLs also help to redistribute the light intensity inside the devices and to protect the active layer from degradation by oxygen or moisture.12 Among the proposed metal oxides, LZO is an excellent cathode interfacial layer due to its high electron mobility, good transparency, low cost, non-toxicity, air-stability, and hole blocking properties.15,16
On the other hand, two-dimensional (2D) graphene with a one atom thickness received voluminous interest due to its superior electrochemical properties, which make it a promising additive for the preparation of various composite materials.17,18 Graphene demonstrates undesirable electrochemical performance because of its agglomerative behaviour. Thus, many groups have proposed alternatives to graphene such as reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene oxide (GO), and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs).19–34 Amongst these graphene family members, GO has attracted great attention since it has many functional groups, such as hydroxyl, epoxide, carbonyl, and carboxyl groups, which are attached to the graphene monolayer sheet. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the presence of these functional groups makes GO strongly hydrophilic.35 Thus, it is incompatible with most organic polymers due to the fact that it only disperses in aqueous media.
Herein, we have demonstrated simple techniques to develop a GO and PEIE mixture as an electron transport material. In brief, PEIE was mixed in 1:1 blend ratio and stirred for 2 h at 70 °C. More information can be found in the Experimental section. The final product was used without any filtration or further purification. The systematic thin film characterization was performed to confirm the presence of PEIE in the mixed solution. Finally, we fabricated organic solar cells using the narrow bandgap polymer PTB7:PCBM in a conventional configuration. The performance of our proposed PEIE:GO ETL outperformed the other devices, using only GO and PEIE as ETLs.
2 Results and discussion
The thin films of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE were first evaluated by UV-vis spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis spectra of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE with the absorption peaks located at 230, 270 and 260 nm, respectively. There was a slight shift in the absorption peak of the pristine GO located at 230 nm to 260 nm for the GO:PEIE, most likely due to the reinstatement of π-electron conjugation within the graphene sheets.36 By using the 1:1 ratio, no aggregation was found during the doping process. We argue that during the doping process, one GO sheet can react with numerous PEIE molecules, resulting in the formation of PEIE doped GO sheets. Hence, it is critical that there is an appropriate ratio of PEIE and GO and no aggregation when preparing the homogeneous GO:PEIE mixture.

Fig. 2 shows the Fourier transform infrared spectra in the frequency range of 500–4000 cm−1. For all GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE, the wide peak at 3058 to 3580 cm−1 is assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of the O–H groups of water molecules absorbed on the GO, while the peak located at 1723 cm−1 corresponds to the CO stretching vibration mode. In the case of the GO film, a weak peak at 1635 cm−1 corresponds to the CC stretching vibration mode. The presence of two absorption peaks at 1632 and 1745 cm−1 corresponds to the stretching vibration of the C–O of carboxylic acid and C–OH of alcohol, respectively. The shoulder peak at 1120 cm−1 is defined as the stretching vibration of C–OH of alcohol. This is in agreement with previous work.37,38 After the interaction between GO and PEIE, two absorption bands located at 2824 and 2944 cm−1, that correspond to the symmetric (–CH2–) and asymmetric (–CH2–) of the PEIE chains, appeared indicating the successful incorporation of PEIE into the GO sheets.39 Therefore, the mixing of PEIE into GO simplifies the conversion of hydrophobic to hydrophilic in nature of the GO:PEIE mixture. The GO:PEIE mixture provides a facile method for developing a novel graphene based composite.
 Fig. 2  FTIR spectra of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE deposited on silicon wafer. 
The chemical elements of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE were analysed by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 3a depicts the broad energy scan of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE thin films deposited on a glass substrate. In all scans, the peaks found at 284 and 530 eV were assigned to C 1s and O 1s, respectively. In the case of the GO thin film, only carbon and oxygen peaks were found and they are located at 284.5 and 533 eV, respectively. In the wide scan of PEIE, the carbon peak at 285.5 eV can be attributed to the different binding states of carbon atoms in the PEIE structure. In the GO:PEIE, a superposition of the GO and PEIE peaks (285.5 eV) attributed to the C 1s confirms that PEIE is present on the graphene oxide film.40 Finally, the observed appearance of a shoulder and a shift in the C 1s peak position of PEIE doped GO suggests that the n-doping was induced by PEIE mixing (Fig. 4).

Raman spectroscopy was performed to reveal the quality of graphene and its doping state before and after PEIE mixing by evaluating the D, G, and 2D bands in terms of their positions, widths, and intensity ratios. The differences in the G and 2D band position, intensity ratios, and width corresponds to its various doping states.42 It is worth noting that our doping process successfully took place with an unchanged D band after mixing with PEIE. It implies that the incorporation of PEIE does not create any significant damage to the GO lattice structure.43 However, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the G band and the I2D/ID reveal the changes in the electronic state (data not shown). After the mixing with PEIE, the position of the G band decreased by ∼8 cm−1 and the D band decreased by 7 cm−1. This is attributed to the Raman properties of the n-doped GO.
The XRD patterns of GO, PEIE, and PEIE:GO were investigated by using an X-ray diffractometer X'Pert PRO with Cu Kα targets (λ = 0.154 nm) at a scanning rate of 2° min−1 and an operating voltage of 40 kV with a current of 100 mA. The XRD patterns of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE films are shown in Fig. 5. The GO film exhibits a sharp peak at 2θ ≈ 10.7°, indicating to a 002 interlayer spacing of approximately 0.84 nm.44,45 This is due to the high degree of exfoliation and the disordered structure of GO.46 Additionally, a broad shoulder peak centred at 2θ ≈ 21° (d ≈ 0.42 nm) is assigned to the presence of un-oxidized graphite.47 This observation is in agreement with the FTIR (CC stretching vibration at 1633 cm−1) and the XPS aromatic region (CC at 284.8 eV) results.
 Fig. 5  XRD patterns of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE thin films. 
For the GO:PEIE films, the peak at 10.7° present in GO disappears, implying complete exfoliation of the GO and homogeneous dispersion of GO sheets in the matrix. Moreover, the peak in the GO:PEIE films centred at 2θ ≈ 15.1° (d ≈ 0.434 nm) confirms the restoration of the GO structure.48
Arguably, this is caused by the slight broadening of the 002 interlayer spacing which is due to the disturbance of PEIE on the GO sheet.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE are shown in Fig. 6. The SEM image of PEIE reveals some ripples featured on its surface (Fig. 6a). While from Fig. 6b, it can be observed that graphene oxide has a layered structure, which affords ultrathin and homogeneous graphene films. Such films are folded or continuous at times. Additionally, it is possible to distinguish the edges of the individual sheets, including kinked and wrinkled areas. In contrast, Fig. 6c reveals the porous microstructures of lyophilized GO:PEIE, suggesting that the GO sheets were cross-linked in the porous PEIE networks.

As illustrated in Fig. 6d (different magnifications), the SEM image of the GO:PEIE reveals that the presence of randomly aggregated, thin, and crumpled sheets are closely connected to each other and results in a disordered solid. The composition of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) heated in the air (Fig. 7). In general, the weight loss seen at 100 °C corresponds to the decomposition of physically absorbed water. For GO, the weight loss between 100 °C to 300 °C of about 48% corresponds to the decomposition of oxygen-containing functional groups (Table 1).

The carbon skeleton underwent bulk pyrolysis after the temperature went above 500 °C.49 Compared to that of the GO:PEIE, the GO:PEIE films show a steady and minor weight loss at around 100 °C (∼2%). This is attributed to the hydrophobic nature of GO. It is worth noting that GO did not undergo reduction when mixed with PEIE. Moreover, according to TGA data, the GO:PEIE film demonstrated a higher thermal stability compared with the GO, which is due to the higher cross-linking within the network structures in the film.
The work function (WF) was measured by using a Scanning Kelvin Probe (SKP Princeton Applied Research) to verify the doping of GO by PEIE and the shift in its respective Fermi energy levels. The measurements were also performed on bare GO and bare gold substrates, resulting in WFs of 4.70 ± 0.05 eV and 5.0 ± 0.05 eV, respectively. Fig. 8 illustrates the changes in the WF of GO by the PEIE layer. Mixing of PEIE with GO creates intrinsic molecular dipole moments, associated with the neutral amine groups in PEIE. The interaction between PEIE and GO leads to a WF of 3.8 ± 0.05 eV. There was a significant reduction in the WF of GO by a facile technique which is stable in air. n-Doping of graphene has been extensively investigated.50–55 Some approaches have revealed potential in n-doping of graphene in a whole range of temperatures and it is air stable as well. In a previous study by Matis et al., it was reported that n-doping of graphene was done by light hydrogenation. Nonetheless, hydrogenation is less desirable because it induces defects to graphene, with a significant defect of the D band in the Raman plots after the treatment.56,57

It is well known that the electrical characteristics of the interfacial layers are very important for the performance of organic devices since they influence charge transport at the interface. Fig. 9a illustrates the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PTB7:PC71BM based on conventional architecture fabricated using the ETL of GO:PEIE and PEDOT:PSS as HTL; this was measured under 100 mW cm−2 air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination. The energy level diagram for each ETL is shown in Fig. S1.† The solar cell parameters, in terms of the short circuit-current density (JSC), open circuit voltage (VOC), fill factor (FF), power conversion efficiency (PCE), series resistance (RS) and shunt resistance (Rsh), are collected in Table 2. The PTB7:PC71BM based device with PEIE demonstrates a JSC of 13.97 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.74 V, FF of 68.02%, and PCE of 7.03%. The PTB7:PC71BM with GO shows a JSC of 14.74 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.74 V, FF of 67.86%, and PCE of 7.42%. The best photovoltaic performance has been demonstrated with the mixture of GO and PEIE as the ETL, with a PCE of 8.21%, JSC of 15.41 mA cm−2, VOC of 0.74, and FF of 70.09%. The device with GO:PEIE ETL illustrates a reduced RS of 24.11 Ω cm2 compared to that of GO and PEIE based devices. One sees that the ETL has a strong influence on the JSC, VOC, and FF for all fabricated devices. To further probe this behaviour, we are currently conducting transient photocurrent and impedance measurements, and further discussion will be reported elsewhere.

The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of PTB7:PC71BM based organic solar cells are displayed in Fig. 9b. The GO:PEIE interlayer demonstrates a substantially enhanced response from 300 to 700 nm compared to that of PEIE or GO interlayers. The maximum IPCE value of the GO:PEIE based device is 70% compared to 65% and 60% for the GO and PEIE, respectively. The IPCE spectra are consistent with the measured JSC in the fabricated devices.
To probe the key elements of the ETLs in organic solar cells, the electron mobilities are determined by the space-charge limited current (SCLC) technique with the configuration of electron only devices (EODs). The complete EOD structure is: ITO/LiF (2 nm) ETL (10–20 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (100 nm). The mobilities were determined by fitting the current density to the model of a single carrier SCLC. The calculated electron mobilities are 3 × 10−7, 1.49 × 10−7, and 5 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1 for GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE, respectively. As mentioned above, the devices employing PEIE and GO ETLs demonstrated lower JSC values. This result can be attributed to the lower electron mobilities, thus the slower electron extraction rate of PEIE and GO, which led to an enhanced possibility of charge recombination due to electron accumulation at the interface of the PTB7:PC71BM and ETL.
To further strengthen our understanding on device performance, we performed a simulation of optical electrical field |E|2 as a function of wavelength using GO and GO:PEIE ETLs (Fig. 10). As illustrated in Fig. 10b, the |E|2 of the GO:PEIE device is greatly improved compared to that of the GO device. The highest |E|2 for an incident light wavelength of 600 nm is 3.53 V m−1 compared to that of 2.74 V m−1 for GO:PEIE and GO, respectively. The variation of |E|2 of both devices associates with the JSC and PCE values. The improved JSC originates from the high |E|2 in the active layer which generates more photocurrent in the devices. According to the simulation, it is safe to conclude that utilizing GO:PEIE ETL results in organic solar cells with improved |E|2 compared to that of GO organic solar cells.

Finally, we conducted the stability measurements for these three different ETLs as shown in Fig. 11. As one sees, the efficiencies of the GO and PEIE based devices degraded faster compared to those of GO:PEIE based devices over 4 weeks of storage. It is worth noting that the lifetime study was conducted at room temperature, and all devices were encapsulated with a glass slide. The efficiencies of GO and PEIE based devices degraded mostly due to the reduction in both JSC and FF (data not shown). Although our scientific community usually pointed out that vapour and oxygen are two main factors that influenced the performance of organic devices, the real mechanism for the rapid degradation of GO and PEIE is currently being investigated and will not be treated here.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we report that the GO:PEIE solution is a transparent conducting electrode for high performance organic photovoltaic devices based on the PTB7:PC71BM system. Additionally, GO:PEIE is an effective transparent electrode compared to that of GO or PEIE electrodes. This study suggests that the application of the GO:PEIE film as the electron transport layer is also an effective method to improve the device performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that utilizes GO:PEIE ETL in highly efficient PSCs.
4 Experimental section
4.1 Preparation of the GO and GO:PEIE
Graphene oxide was prepared using a modification of Hummers' method from flake graphite (99.95% purity, Aldrich). To prepare GO:PEIE, the above GO (10 mg) was dispersed in MilliQ H2O (10 mL), and then PEIE (60 kDa, branched; 30 mg, 0.073 mmol, Aldrich) and N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, 50 mg, 0.26 mmol, Aldrich) were added. The mixture was stirred overnight, membrane-filtered (100 kDa, Millipore), washed three times with MilliQ H2O, and dispersed in 10 mL of H2O.
4.2 Organic solar cell fabrication
Single-junction BHJ polymer solar cells were prepared using the procedure described below. The ITO substrates (10 Ω sq−1) were cleaned with acetone, methanol, isopropanol, and deionized water, dried with compressed nitrogen before use and then treated with oxygen plasma for 15 min. The PEDOT:PSS (HC Stark Clevios P VP AI4083) was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 25 s on top of the cleaned ITO substrates to form a 35 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer that was then annealed at 130 °C for 20 minutes in a N2 conditioned glovebox. The photoactive layer PTB7:PC71BM BHJ composite, approximately 80 nm thick, was then spin coated on HILs from a chlorobenzene (CB) solution with a 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive composed of PTB7 and PC71BM (PTB7:PC71BM = 1:1.5, by weight). The photoactive layer was spin coated at 500 rpm for 25 s in a N2 conditioned glovebox. The GO:PEIE solution was then spin coated on top of the photoactive layer at 4000 rpm for 25 s in the N2 conditioned glovebox. Subsequently, the devices were completed by depositing a 100 nm thick Al layer under a vacuum chamber of ∼10−7 torr. Finally, the cell was encapsulated using UV curing. The device was covered with glass encapsulation in a N2 conditioned glovebox.
4.3 Characterization
FTIR spectroscopy measurements were performed under ambient conditions using a PerkinElmer FTIR spectrometer (JASCO FTIR 4100). Samples for FTIR were prepared with KBr to form transparent pellets. The ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy data at ambient temperature was recorded using a UVS-2100 SCINCO spectrophotometer. The chemical nature of the GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE was analysed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (Multilab. ESCA 2000) in KOPTRI. Raman spectra of GO, PEIE, and GO:PEIE were obtained using a Jobin Yvon T64000, Triple Raman Spectrometer. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a XRD diffractometer X'Pert PRO with Cu Kα targets (λ = 0.154 nm) at a scanning rate of 2° min−1 and an operating voltage of 40 kV with a current of 100 mA. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted in a nitrogen atmosphere using TGA, TA Q500 in a temperature range between 0 and 700 °C, with a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. For SEM, the scanning was conducted using a SEM, Hitachi S-4700. The film thickness was measured using a Dektak AlphaStep Profiler. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were recorded with a Keithley 2410 source unit. The EQE measurements were performed using an EQE system (Model 74000) obtained from Newport Oriel Instruments USA and a HAMAMATSU calibrated silicon cell photodiode used as a reference diode. The wavelength was controlled with a monochromator 200–1600 nm.
