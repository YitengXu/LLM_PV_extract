    , Accepted 28th April 2015First published on 29th April 2015Abstract3D multi-walled carbon nanotube (CNT)/graphene counter electrodes (CEs) with different transmittances were prepared using a spraying method based on CNT/graphene (MCG) aerogels. Fragments of MCG aerogels formed a 3D structure on FTO as CEs, which showed excellent performance in DSSCs. A mirror was set under the testing cells to reflect the light passed through the counter electrodes. With the increasing loading of materials at CEs, the transparency decreased and the electrocatalytic activities improved. The conversion efficiency of these CE based DSSCs surpassed that of the Pt CE (6.90%) when the transmittance was below 30% at 662 nm, and the efficiency was as high as 7.62% at a transmittance of 11%. A mirror was set under the cells, and the improvement of photocurrent density depended on the transmittance of the CEs. Re-harvesting the light increased the efficiency of the DSSCs, and the CE-based cell with the transmittance of 30% achieved the highest efficiency (7.70%).
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been regarded as a potential alternative to silicon-based solar cells due to their low cost, easy fabrication, and fine conversion efficiency.1–3 Typical DSSCs comprise TiO2 coated with dyes on a transparent conductive oxide layer as the photoanode, a redox couple as the electrolyte, and platinum (Pt) on an FTO substrate as the counter electrode (CE). With high conductivity and catalytic activity, Pt has shown excellent CE characteristics;4,5 however, the high cost of precious metals has led many researchers to focus on carbon materials with similar properties, such as carbon black,6 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),7–10 nanocarbon,11,12 and graphene.13
To achieve new kinds of CEs for DSSCs, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene have been combined to design CEs with excellent conductivity and catalytic properties.14–17 Furthermore, counter electrodes with a three-dimensional (3D) structure consisting of graphene have exhibited great superiority in new types of CEs, such as graphene sheets with a honeycomb-like structure;18 hierarchical, vertically oriented graphene;19 nitrogen-doped graphene foams;20 and p-doped graphene nano-networks.21 Besides improving the material characteristics of CEs,21,22 other parts of DSSCs also have been developed to accomplish higher conversion efficiency, reduce the cost, and achieve greater stability. For example, the redox couple Co(III)/Co(II) as an electrolyte could significantly increase the open-circuit voltages (Voc).23
There are two main components concerning the light-harvesting property of DSSCs, the dye and the mesoporous photoanode which supports the sensitizer.24 Increasing the range of absorption band is a matter of concern for effective utilization of the solar spectrum. Many trials have been accomplished by the development of new dyes (N3 to N719, and black dyes) to increase light reharvesting.25,26 In a study by Hardin et al.27 luminescent chromophores were added into a liquid electrolyte to absorb high-energy photons and efficiently transfer the energy to a dye, increasing the absorption bandwidth of the DSSCs.
One-dimensional nanostructures are used as photoanodes by taking advantage of the large surface area to improve light harvesting.28 However, apart from the design of the DSSCs' inner components, improving the harvesting of light from the counter electrodes is also an effective way to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE).29 Maximizing the use of the incident solar light could increase the current and maximize the PCE.30 Previous studies have primarily focused on Pt-related counter electrodes because of their high transparency;29,31,32 for carbon-material-based counter electrodes, these studies stopped at the discussion of the transmittance and thicknesses of CEs that influenced the PCE,33–36 and thus research on reharvesting light from carbon material CEs remains insufficient and related work has seldom been reported.
Graphene/CNT transparent electrodes have attracted enormous interest in solar cells37 and field effect transistors (FETs);38 the optical transmittance and sheet resistance of graphene/CNT transparent films can be manipulated by the addition of CNTs. Peng et al.39 prepared transparent, conductive, and flexible graphene/CNT hybrids with two three-dimensional microstructures. In the work by Jiang et al.40 graphene/CNT films were printed on flexible plastic substrates using a printing method. In this paper, graphene was selected as the dispersing and cross-linking agent to decorate CNTs to form a 3D-CNT aerogel. Furthermore, an island-like structure formed on the FTO substrate using the spraying method, which led to graphene/CNT transparent films with different transmittance values.
Here, we discuss light reharvesting in CNT/graphene (MCG) CEs with different transmittance values. A mirror was set under the testing cells to reflect the light passing through the counter electrodes. CNT/graphene aerogels were formed by taking advantage of the self-assembling ability of graphene oxide (GO) with a reducing agent under heating. Fragments of MCG aerogels formed a 3D structure on FTO as CEs. The transmittance of the CEs decreased as the load of materials increased, further influencing the electrocatalytic activities. The improved PCE resulted from the enhanced harvesting of light; MCG-CEs showed the highest PCE of 7.7% at a transmittance of 30% at 662 nm with the assistance of a mirror in our experiment.
Experimental section
Preparation of the MCG aerogels
GO solution (1 mg ml−1) was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of graphite oxide powder in 100 ml of distilled water for 4 h in an ultrasonic bath, with several minutes of probe sonication. Then, 400 mg of CNTs were added to 100 ml of GO solution and stirred; after 1 h of ultrasonication, the CNT/GO solution was obtained. Then, 200 mg of glutathione was added to the CNT/GO solution. The CNT/GO hydrogel was obtained after heating the previous solution at 95 °C in a water bath for 12 h. The aerogel was prepared by freeze-drying the hydrogel for 48 h to remove the water. Finally, the aerogel was further treated at 800 °C under an Ar atmosphere for 2 h.
Preparation of the counter electrode
The aerogels were ground to a powder in an agate mortar; 100 mg of aerogel powder and 20 mg of PVPk30 were dispersed into 1 ml of ethylene glycol and 2 ml ethanol, and a paste was prepared for 30 min in an ultrasonic bath. The resultant paste was sprayed directly onto FTO/glass with an airbrush. By controlling the spraying time, counter electrodes with different degrees of transmission were obtained. Finally, these counter electrodes were annealed at 400 °C under flowing argon for 1 h.
Fabrication of dummy cells
TiO2 photoanodes were immersed in an N719 dye solution in dry ethanol at a concentration of 3 mmol l−1 for 20 h at 60 °C. The TiO2 photoanodes and N719 dye were purchased from Dalian HeptaChroma SolarTech Co., Ltd. To assemble a DSSC cell, a 60 μm-thick Surlyn film was used to separate the photoanode and CE, and the cell was assembled using two clamps. The iodide electrolyte, which consisted of 0.6 M 1-methyl propylimidazolium iodide, 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, and 0.5 M tert-butyl pyridine in acetonitrile, was injected into the solar cell through a hole on the back of the CE. To fabricate a symmetric dummy cell, two symmetric CEs facing each other were packaged using the same procedure.
Characterization and measurements
The microstructure and morphology of the samples were analyzed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-2100F) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, Hitachi S-4800). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed in a Kratos Axis Ultra DLD spectrometer using monochromated Al Kα X-rays at a base pressure of 1 × 10−9 Torr. Survey scans performed between 1100 and 0 eV revealed the overall elemental compositions of the sample; regional scans for specific elements also were performed. The peak energies were calibrated by placing the major C1s peak at 284.6 eV. Then, I–V measurements were performed using a solar simulator (91160, AM 1.5, Oriel, Newport Corporation, USA) with a power density of 100 mW cm−2 on the surface of the test cell, and using an Oriel I–V Test Station (Model PVIV-212). This system was calibrated at NREL (USA) using an amorphous Si solar cell measurement. A silver mirror was placed under the testing cell, and used to improve the visible light utilization rate of the CEs.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel-polarization measurements were conducted using an electrochemical workstation (CHI Instruments 660D). CV was performed in the range of −0.5 to 1.0 V with a three-electrode system with Pt foil as the CE, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode in an acetonitrile solution containing 10 mM LiI, 1 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1. EIS spectra of the symmetric dummy cells were measured in the frequency range of 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz in the dark. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set to 0 V and 10 mV, respectively. The EIS spectra of the symmetric dummy cells were analyzed using equivalent circuit models with Zsimpwin software. The Tafel curves of symmetric dummy cells were measured between +1.0 and −1.0 V at a scan rate of 10 mV at room temperature. A UV-Vis spectrophotometer (UV2310II) was used to measure the transmittances of the CEs.
Results and discussion

Scheme 1 shows the fabrication process of different transparent CEs and the cell working model. CEs were set up with different loading materials by controlling the spraying time. Light harvesting was enhanced by setting a silver mirror under the cells.

Fig. 1a shows the TEM image for MCG powders; wrinkled graphene nanosheets were in contact with the CNTs. Taking advantage of graphene's ability to self-assemble at high temperatures, with a reducing agent, graphene interlayer π–π stacking was the driving force in the formation of the MCG hydrogel structure. SEM images of MCG powders are illustrated in Fig. 1b. The MCG aerogels show a highly wrinkled 3D framework; CNTs were inserted into the graphene sheets and could hardly be observed from the outside. The mass ratio of CNTs to graphene oxide was 4:1; thus the C content of the mixture was high. Fig. 1c shows the XPS survey spectra of MCG, in which the C1s, N1s, and O1s peaks appear at 284.8 eV, 400.3 eV, and 533.8 eV, and the contents of C, N, and O are 95.91 at%, 1.36 at% and 2.73 at%, respectively.

N-doping can significantly improve the catalytic properties of graphene.41 The N1s spectra of MCG can be resolved into four peaks, which implies four kinds of N species, respectively.42,43 As shown in Fig. 1d, the peaks appearing at ∼398.6 and ∼399.9 eV can be ascribed to the pyridine N and pyrrole N, respectively. The N incorporated into the graphene networks is termed “graphitic” N, which is located at about ∼401.3 eV, and the last high energy peak at ∼403.8 eV is related to oxidized N. However, the pyridinic N and “graphitic” N are regarded as the main catalytic active sites for the iodine reduction reaction, which may be due to the shift in the redox potential and the reduced adsorption energy.44
The UV-Vis transmittance spectra of FTO and the CEs are presented in Fig. 2a. The original FTO substrate exhibits a maximum transmittance of 84.2% at 662 nm, and Pt on FTO a value of 76.6% (Fig. S1†). The MCG-CEs were classified according to the different maximum transmittances at 662 nm. The CE with the highest transparency has a transmittance of 72% at 662 nm, which is labeled as T72%; however, CEs that transmitted from 71 to 73% were also classified as the T72% team in order to reduce the difficulty of the experiment. This rule was adapted to other teams as well. The photographs of counter electrodes with different transmittances are shown in Fig. 2b, which correspond with Fig. 2a. To further simplify the process, we chose T72%, T60%, T50%, T40%, T30%, T20%, and T11% CEs in the following discussion.

Fig. 3a presents the AFM analysis of the 3D morphology of the surface of the counter electrode. The mountain-like morphology vividly reflects the vertical structure. The morphology analysis of CEs is illustrated in Fig. 3b–h for T72%, T60%, T50%, T40%, T30%, T20%, and T11%, respectively. Obviously, the transmittance of the CEs decreases as the material load on FTO increases. The size of the aerogel fragments is primarily from 10 to 20 nm, and the fragments adhere to FTO well with the help of PVPk30. Every single fragment has a 3D configuration; thus, the high coarse 3D morphology was formed with the assembly of small particles. The uncovered surface of FTO provides certain penetrability of light and offers more space for 3D particles contacting vertically with the electrolyte.

To investigate the characteristics of the counter electrodes, cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel plots were introduced in the analysis. The electrochemical redox behavior of I−/I3− of the electrode was measured through CV in a three-electrode system, with the CEs as the working electrode, a Pt foil as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, with a scanning range from −0.5 V to 1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl.
The CV results are shown in Fig. 4a. The pair of peaks at a relatively low potential reflect redox reaction (1), and it is the one relevant to the functionality of the counter electrode.19,45 I3− + 2e− ⇄ 3I−(1)

Tafel plots (d) of dummy cells between +1.0 and −1.0 V at a scan rate of 10 mV at room temperature. 
The peak A of current density JA and the difference in the potential value between low potential peak-to-peak separations (ΔEP) co-decide the catalytic activity of the counter electrode. From the reaction kinetics, ΔEP varies inversely with the charge transfer rate (ks), indicating that the smaller the ΔEP, the better the catalytic activity.46,47 The JA of MCG-CEs are all higher than that of Pt CE, implying that the 3D MCG aerogel structure could have provided more electron transport sites than the 2D-Pt CEs; thus, the MCG-CEs show good charge transfer performance. The peak A of MCG-CEs rises while shifting to the left with decreasing transmittance, which directly increases JA and diminishes ΔEP. In other words, the electrochemical characteristics of MCG-CEs increase with the loading of materials on FTO, and the additional materials could offer more reaction sites.
EIS measurement was conducted on a symmetrical dummy cell consisting of two identical electrodes; the results are shown in Fig. 4b. From the reported graphene counter electrode,22 the high-frequency semicircle between 100 kHz and 2.5 kHz reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance in the porous electrode (ZW, pore); however, it cannot be observed in the EIS curves of MCG-CEs, and thus there is less coverage on the surface of the materials. In the frequency range between 25 Hz and 2.5 kHz, the impedance is related to the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and capacitance at the interface of the CE/electrolyte. Rct is considered to be a crucial factor that affects power conversion efficiency. The frequency range of the serial resistance (Rsh) and Nernst diffusion (Nw) is consistent with classic reports.5 The corresponding equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. S2.†
The exchange current density J0 varies inversely with Rct, as described in eqn 2: J0 = RT/(nFRct)(2)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, n is the number of electrons, and F is the Faraday constant. Assuming an exchange current density (J0) of 20 mA cm−2, the J0 value corresponds to an Rct = 1.3 Ω cm2 (n = 1) at room temperature.48
The values of ΔEP and Rct are summarized in Fig. 4c. Pt shows a ΔEP of 298 mV and 4.5 Ω cm2. The CEs T72% exhibit large values of ΔEP = 700 mV and Rct = 82.2 Ω cm2, which reflect the poor charge-transfer ability; however, ΔEP and Rct of T11% are as low as 301 mV and 0.8 Ω cm2, respectively. Therefore, T11% shows excellent electrocatalytic activities, as well as exchange current density and high catalytic activity. The Rct of the CEs also decrease with reduced transmittance, indicating that loading more aerogel fragments improves the catalytic activity for reducing I3− to I− at the electrolyte–electrode interface. Comparing the results of CV and EIS, ΔEP of MCG-CEs changes in accordance with Rct; these values are quite consistent and reflect the performance of CEs.
To further confirm the electrochemical characteristics of MCG-CEs, Tafel-polarization measurements were carried out using dummy cells and the plots are shown in Fig. 3d. The curve at intermediate potentials with a sharp slope is attributed to the Tafel zone,33 and the ionic diffusion coefficient D can be calculated according to eqn (3): D = 2nFcJlim/δ(3)where Jlim is the limiting current density, n is the number of electrons in the I−/I3− redox couple, F is the Faraday constant, c is the I3− concentration, and δ is the distance between the electrodes in the dummy cell.
The limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) and the exchange current density (J0) can be obtained from a high potential and intermediate potential, respectively.49 The slopes of the Tafel curves of MCG-CEs become sharper with the increasing load of materials, and the Tafel zone of Pt appears between those of T30% and T40%. Larger slopes demonstrate higher exchange current density (J0) on the surface of the electrodes and indicate a higher ionic diffusion coefficient D. Results from the CV, EIS, and Tafel measurements confirm that the electrocatalytic activities of MCG-CEs increase with decreasing transmittance, and the performance is better than that of Pt when the transmittance of the CEs is lower than 30% at 662 nm.

Fig. 5a and b show the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristic curves of T72%, T30%, T11%, and Pt DSSCs under simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G), and the corresponding curves with a mirror and without a mirror. The entire data for the DSSC devices are listed in Table S1.†Fig. 5c summarizes the values of η and ΔJ of DSSCs. Jsc improved remarkably when a mirror was set under the cells. The Jsc of T72% increases by 2.14 mA cm−2 and η becomes 0.56% higher. Jsc of T11% improves only by 0.6 mA cm−2 and η does not change. However, T30% shows the highest η (7.70%) with a mirror with Jsc increasing by 0.83 mA cm−2. Obviously, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) undergoes little change with the use of a mirror; therefore, reharvesting light to increase Jsc (ΔJ) is the main factor for improving η. Fig. 5c presents the curves of η and ΔJ, which clearly show the change of η with ΔJ. η of MCG-CEs is already close to that of Pt (6.9%) at a transmittance of 40% (6.8%) without a mirror, and the highest η achieved is 7.62% at T11%, which is consistent with the previous electrochemical analysis results. However, T30% exhibits higher η than T11% with the advantage of light reharvesting, and this result shows the crucial significance of this work.

Conclusion
Here we fabricated different transparent CEs by controlling the spraying time, and focused on the relationship between light reharvesting and transmittance of CNT/graphene CEs. Based on the CV, EIS, and Tafel results, the electrocatalytic characteristics of MCG-CEs increase with decreased transmittance; however, by reharvesting the reflected light from the cell with a mirror, the T30%-based cell achieved a higher PCE than that of T11%, although the improvement of PCE with MCG-CE-based cells is lower than that of Pt due to the low transparency. Our work is important for future research on transparent CEs and the large-scale application of carbon-material-based transparent DSSCs, such as for outside windows or walls.
