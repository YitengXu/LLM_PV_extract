First published on 16th July 2009AbstractIn constructing a review from such a huge body of published science, editors must make many choices, none of which would have been possible without Sci-Finder® (i.e., Chemical Abstracts) of which we have made optimal use. Details like the organization, selection of articles, and the brevity of the abstracts is our fault, but more than two thousand photochemistry papers have been published in the most cited scientific journals in 2008: Accounts of Chemical Research, ACS Nano, Advanced Functional Materials, Angewandte Chemie International Edition, Chemistry-A European Journal, Chemical Communications, Chemistry Letters, Chemistry of Materials, Chemical Physics Letters, Chemical Reviews, European Journal of Organic Chemistry, Journal of the American Chemical Society, Journal of Chemical Physics, Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology A: Chemistry, Journal of Physical Organic Chemistry, Langmuir, Macromolecules, Nano Letters, Nature, Nature Materials, Nature Nanotechnology, Nature Photonics, Organic Letters, Photochemical and Photobiological Sciences, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Science, The Journal of Organic Chemistry, The Journal of Physical Chemistry A, The Journal of Physical Chemistry B, and The Journal of Physical Chemistry C. We abstracted papers mainly from these journals.
1. Photodynamics and spectroscopy
Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and transient IR are powerful tools in detection of reactive intermediates and in delineating photochemical reaction mechanisms. Even known reactions such as hydrogen-abstraction, cycloreversion, bond cleavage and photoinduced rearrangements evidence new aspects using these ultrafast chemical detection tools.

Benzophenone (BP) excited states continue to attract attention. The well-known BP intersystem crossing from S1(n,π*) to T1(n,π*) states, whose direct transition is forbidden by El-Sayed rules, had been reinvestigated using subpicosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy. The authors used effective data analysis for various excitation wavelengths and in different solvents to identify an intermediate (IS) between S1 and T1. They report characteristic times for the transition S1 to IS of 6.5 ps, and for the IS to T1 transition, of 10 ps.1 Direct photolysis of the oxetane from 1,3-dimethylthymine and BP has been studied by ultrafast broadband transient absorption spectroscopy. This indicates that the cycloreversion is stepwise from a singlet excited-state, with subsequent intersystem crossing to produce the triplet carbonyl product.2 Transient grating (TG) spectroscopy was used to probe the photoinduced hydrogen-abstraction reaction of BP in various room temperature ionic liquids. Transient absorption methods confirmed that the BP ketyl radical (BPK) was formed in these liquids, and analysis of the TG signal provided the diffusion coefficients of BPK and BP. It appears that the diffusion coefficient of the BKP is (in contrast to those of the stable molecules) close to that predicted by the Stokes–Einstein relation.3 In another system, photolysis of the ortho allyloxy-substituted BP was found to give a diastereomeric mixture of dihydrobenzofuran derivatives (Scheme 1).4 It is proposed that this cyclization is via a short-lived 1,5-biradical. The substrate also underwent a pseudo-Paterno–Büchi rearrangement to give an unusual acetal.

Among all reactions forming intermediates of some significant lifetime, electron transfer reactions received the most attention. Pulsed laser generation of the tris(4-bromophenyl)aminium radical cation was used to induce cycloreversion of cis- and trans-1,2,3-triphenylazetidine (cis R1 = Ph, R2 = H; trans R1 = H, R2 = Ph) (Scheme 2); this results from electron transfer to the radical cation. Based on studies that included transient absorption spectroscopy, the authors proposed a stepwise C–N and C–C bond cleavage (modes shown as a and b) of the resulting azetidine radical cations.5
 Scheme 2 
Transient absorption spectroscopy has been used to study the biological electron-transfer chain system FAD-W382-W359-W306 (Fig. 1) found in DNA photolyase from E. coli. This had hitherto been problematic because the chain reactions involve identical molecules, and so electron transfer between them does not change net absorption.6 Using linearly polarized flashes to detect the anisotropy spectrum overcame this difficulty. The appropriate spectrum in the wild-type photolyase was clearly distinct from that in a mutated version and identified W306 as the oxidized species. An upper limit of 10 ns for electron transfer from W306 to W359 radical cation in wild-type DNA photolyase was proposed.

Femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was used to study the protonation states of two flavin cofactors, flavin-adenine dinucleotide and flavin mononucleotide. Three states of protonation, Fl−, Fl and FlH+, were found, and while Fl and Fl− exhibit the same excited state absorption, the lifetime of Fl− is much shorter than that of Fl.7
As well as the biosystems above, an eclectic range of chemical systems was studied. A femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy study of intramolecular electron-transfer in crystal violet lactone in polar, aprotic solvents reveals an initially excited charge transfer state (1CTA) that is rapidly converted into a highly polar charge transfer state (1CTB). The rate of this ET process was found to be solvent dependent due to the differing dipole moments of the two states.8 Matrix isolation remains a useful technique. Vacuum UV photolysis (121.6 nm) of silane in a nitrogen matrix at 12 K revealed four transient species SiN2, Si(N2)2, HSiN2 and H2SiN2 that were characterized using FTIR spectroscopy. A further transient species was found that contains only silicon and hydrogen.9 Dynamics occupied theoreticians and experimentors. An ab initio study of the ps photodynamics of low-lying excited states nO–π* and π–π* of formamide showed that the primary deactivation process is via C–N bond dissociation.10 The effect of aqueous solvation on vibrational energy relaxation of the carbonyl CO stretching modes of CH3COOD and CD3COOD has been studied in D2O by frequency-resolved IR pump–probe spectroscopy. The vibrational energy relaxation was found to show two dynamical components with time constants 450 and 980 fs for CH3COOD. Values for CD3COOD were similar, suggesting that vibrational energy is not initially distributed to modes related to the methyl group.11 The photoinduced Wolff rearrangement of BpCN2COCH3 (Bp = biphenyl) to ketene in MeCN was studied by femtosecond time-resolved UV-vis and IR transient absorption spectroscopy (Scheme 3). The latter suggested at least two mechanisms of ketene formation.12
 Scheme 3 
CN radicals formed photolytically using 100 fs laser pulses were probed and their subsequent reaction with solvent molecules was studied by monitoring radical loss using transient vibrational spectroscopy near 3.07 μm, and HCN product formation using transient electronic spectroscopy at 400 nm. The radical was found to disappear more slowly than the HCN appeared, and this was interpreted as indicative of two different CN-solvent (DCM) complexes.13 The ring-opening and ring-closure reactions of photochromic indolylfulgimides have been investigated with femtosecond vibrational spectroscopy.14 Visible light causes a pericyclic ring-opening (Scheme 4) via an excited state with lifetime 2–4 ps, depending on the solvent. UV light causes ring-closure with an excited state lifetime of 0.5 ps. Time-resolved IR measurements do not indicate any long-living intermediate states.
 Scheme 4 
Subpicosecond, frequency-resolved IR pump–probe spectroscopy has been used to study the vibrational dynamics of the OH stretching mode of the benzoic acid dimer in nonpolar solvents.15
Sensors continue to suggest new opportunities. A set of rhodamine and pyronin dyes with modifications (in particular S replacing the O) to the central xanthene unit showed promising triplet state yield and photostability, suggesting potential for use in ultra-high resolution microscopy.16
The exciplex behavior of three benzoxazole derivatives (e.g.Fig. 2) was studied by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and transient absorption spectroscopy. Attachment of a crown ether allowed binding of barium and lithium cations, which resulted in strong fluorescence.17
 Fig. 2 
Photoreactions continue to receive some attention. 1-Oxoindan-2-yl and 1,3-dioxoindan-2-yl groups (R1 and R2 = H. Me, Ph) (Fig. 3) were studied as potential photoremovable protecting groups for carboxylic acids; removal of the groups in the presence of H-atom donors was via a radical chain reaction.18
 Fig. 3 
Oligomers of anthracene ‘plates’ and acetylene linkers were prepared (Scheme 5) and, on photolysis, were found to fold into a zigzag structure, undergoing a [4 + 4] photocycloaddition, which was thermally reversible.19

2. Photo-responsive materials (photoisomerization)

Azobenzene, stilbene and their derivatives are still the most popular compounds used in photo-responsive materials. A UV-light induced gel to sol transition was effected by utilising the trans–cisphotoisomerisation of a triarmed cis-1,3,5-cyclohexanetricarboxamides gelator containing azobenzene moieties.20 In studies towards the development of molecular electronic devices, photoresponsive azobenzenes have been grafted onto hydrogen-terminated Si(111) surfaces via covalent Si–C linkages.21 Development of ‘Smart bases’ has received attention. By using a photochromic azobenzene-derived blocking group, a piperidine base can be switched between a sterically shielded, inactive form and an accessible, reactive form. Thus, light can be used for the reversible external modulation of ground-state basicity and hence activity in general base catalysis.22 The thermal and photo-isomerisation of the sterically hindered [0.0](3,3′)-azobenzenophane was studied by UV-Vis and NMR spectroscopy. The cis–cis isomer was found to be the most stable thermodynamically. Irradiation around 430 nm gave the trans–trans isomer, which exhibited thermal trans-to-cisisomerization with a lifetime of 20 days. An intermediate cis–trans form isomerised to the stable cisi–cis with a lifetime of 1.0 s.23 The isolation of a single azobenzene in an alkanethiolate monolayer on Au{111} has been reported. It was reversibly photoisomerised by cycling exposure to visible and UV light (Fig. 4).24

Tightly packed self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of ultra-rigid conjugated azobenzenes incorporated into a Hg-based junction undergo reversible photoisomerization. The current–voltage curves indicate that the junction operates as a current photoswitch as a result of the forces expressed by the SAMs, which act as a light-powered cargo lifter (Fig. 5).25

Photoactivatable fluorescent proteins (FPs) are powerful fluorescent highlighters in live cell imaging that have potential for optical nanoscopy and for use in biophotonic devices. They can show two types of photoactivation, photoswitching between fluorescent and non-fluorescent forms, and photoconversion. By combining crystallography and spectroscopy, it proved possible to study both types for a particular example of a fluorescent highlighter, called IrisFP.26 A reversible change is the 2D ordering of a diarylethene-pyrene diad and a diarylethene–pyrene–diarylethene triad at a solution-HOPG interface was induced by UV-Vis light and studied by scanning tunnelling microscopy (Fig. 6).27

The cis-transphotoisomerisation fullerene dimers, with an azobenzene linker, has been studied.28 Also, studied was the isomerization of cis,cis-1,4-di-o-tolyl-1,3-butadiene (Fig. 7) in isopentane glass at 77 K. For this isomerisation, hula-twist pathways were considered unlikely, because unstable photoproduct conformers do not form. Instead, the isomerization was found to proceed by bicycle-pedal and one-bond-twist mechanisms.29
 Fig. 7 
In studies of biosystems, the photochemistry of photochromic compounds based on thioindigo and stilbene analogs (hemithioindigos, HTI) was studied. Typically, photochemical Z/Eisomerization occured with time constants of 216 ps (Z→E) and 10 ps (E→Z).30 The photochemical isomerization of a stilbene unit in a rotaxane caused movement of calixarene units; the resulting distance changes were utilised as a molecular muscle (Fig. 8).31

3. Photochemistry of complexes
Transition metal complexes with organic ligands attract attention because of their spectral photoproperties such as high extinction coefficients, high excited-state energy and long lifetime, tunable redox potentials, photostability, high reactivity in light-induced electron and energy transfer reactions with typical energy and electron acceptors and donors. They are widely used as photosensitizers and photocatalysts. Development of new metal complexes and characterization of their properties are important areas of interest.
A series of bistridentate ruthenium(II) polypyridyl-type complexes (Fig. 9) with the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transition showed a strong absorption band at λmax = 491 nm. Room temperature emission from the lowest excited (3MLCT) state for these compounds shows unusually long lifetimes (typically microseconds). Substitution at the pyridyl 4-position allows for the construction of linear, rod-like molecular arrays for photosensitization.32

Another complex has been described, [{(bpy)2Ru(dpp)}2RhBr2](PF6)5 (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine, dpp = 2,3-bis(2-pyridyl)pyrazine), which is also an efficent visible absorber (due to MLCT). In the presence of an electron donor and visible light, the complex undergoes excited state intramolecular electron transfer from the light-absorbing Ru centres to the RhII, reducing it to RhI. The RhI complex allows photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water.33
A photosensitive caged Cu complex prepared from a tetradentate ligand (H2cage) is composed of two pyridylamide arms connected by a photoreactive nitrophenyl group. The H2cage binds Cu2+ in water with a stability constant of 108. Photolysis of 350 nm cleaved the ligand to release photoproducts with less affinity for Cu2+, thereby uncaging the metal ion. Post-photolysis, the uncaged Cu can promote hydroxyl radical formation (Fig. 10).34

Ultrafast dissociation of excitons in CdSe quantum dots (QDs) viaelectron transfer to adsorbed Re bipyridyl complexes has been demonstrated. The dissociation pathway was determined by observation of reduced adsorbate using femtosecond IR spectroscopy. The rate of electron transfer increased at smaller QD sizes. The electron transfer time >2.3 ps was faster than the exciton annihilation time in CdSe (Fig. 11).35

A dinuclear RuII–PdII complex shows efficient H2 production in the presence of triethylamine as a sacrificial electron and proton donor under visible light irradiation. XPS and TEM analyses reveal that photoreduction of PdII to Pd0 causes dissociation of Pd from the complex to form colloids that probably are the actual catalyst for H2 production (Fig. 12).36

        Ruthenium chelating sulfoxide complexes can exhibit excited state S → O isomerization and ground state O → S isomerization, and have potential for use as molecular information storage devices; however, they can be labile to hydrolysis. The novel complex [Ru(bpy)2(PhNSO)](PF6)2 (bpy is 2,2′-bipyridine, PhNSO [N-benzylidine-2-(ethylsulfinyl)ethanamine] is stable to hydrolysis, and its S and O bonded isomers show absorption maxima at 382 nm, and at 360/486 nm, respectively.37
A new supramolecular system, consisting of an expanded porphyrin, cyclo[8]pyrrole (C8) and a pyrene carboxylate (Py) is capable not only of electron transfer upon photoexcitation, but is found to result in “umpolung” (reversal of the predicted charge-separation); C8˙+–Py˙− (2.58 eV) is formed as opposed to C8˙−–Py˙+ (1.31 eV).38
4. Photochemistry of DNA sequence-directed structures
Many studies have been related, directly or indirectly to DNA. The reduction of guanosine by tryptophan as a model for chemical DNA repair has been studied by time-resolved chemically induced dynamic nuclear polarization (CIDNP).39 The quenching of the emission of the cationic polyelectrolyte poly[9,9′-bis(6″-N,N,N-trimethylammonium)hexylfluorene-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) dibromide] by photoinduced electron transfer from negatively charged C60 derivative sodium diphosphorate methano[60]fullerene has been studied with the aim of reducing the complexity of the optical output when such polyelectrolytes are used in ssDNA-specific assays.40 A series of protonated 9-alkylamino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (Acr+)- and phenothiazine (Ptz)-modified DNAs, in which the G–C base pairs are used as a hole-transporting pathway, were synthesized and used to provide a model DNA in which the charge-seperated state is long-lived and amenable to further study.41 The mechanism of the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) reaction between the [Cu(phen)2]2+ complex and DNA has been studied. The reaction proceeds without the need for a reducing agent or oxidant (such as oxygen or hydrogen peroxide), and can be influenced by an internal or an external magnetic field.42 The design of photoswitchable small molecules for binding to DNA is an important goal in chemical biology. A photospiran is reported that is activated into an open zwitterionic ‘binding’ form by UV light (albeit with a relatively low binding constant of 2 × 10−4 M−1), and deactivated into a closed ‘non-binding’ form by visible light.43 Streptavidin functionalized CdSe–ZnS QDs have been conjugated to biotinylated pDNA as a means of investigating the effect of photoinduced QD damage to DNA; the effects include strand breakage and nucleobase damage. The photoactivated QDs induce the DNA damage via energy transfer to nearby oxygen, which yields reactive oxygen species, such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radical (Scheme 6).44

5. Optical single-molecule detection and photoprobes
Optical single-molecule detection is important in photochemistry with the development of detection techniques. Several have been found and used as powerful tools in detection reactions at a single-molecule level, especially in biological systems. Efforts are in process to develop high emission, stable, less toxic materials that can be used as efficient photoprobes in single-molecule detection experiments. A method for single-molecule detection and biomolecular structural mapping based on dual-color imaging and automated colocalization of bioconjugated nanoparticle probes at nanometer precision has been reported.45
A study of the unfolding of a large autofluorescent protein, Citrine, a variant of green fluorescent protein was reported in which a single-molecule fluorescence technique detected an intermediate on the unfolding/folding pathway, and also revealed the existence of parallel unfolding pathways.46 A general strategy for the site-specific dual-labeling of proteins for single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer is illustrated in Fig. 13.47

As models for electronic excitation energy transfer in, for example, light-harvesting complexes in living organisms and optoelectronic devices, dyads composed of a perylenediimide donor and a terrylenediimide acceptor were linked by short (three units) and long (seven units) oligo(phenylene) bridges. Time and frequency resolved single molecule spectroscopy studies showed that energy is transferred more efficiently for the shorter bridge, than for the longer.48Cyanine dyes linked by conjugated alkene units of different length (covalent heterodimers of Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores) have been prepared and found to act as molecular photoswitches. The photophysical behaviour of these materials has been investigated and found to include photoexcitation of the Cy5 resulting in fluorescence or formation of a long-lived, but metastable, dark state.49
6. Photochemistry of nanoparticles and nanostructures
The nano world is literally amazing. Nanoparticle size and shape have serious effects on properties. Nanoparticles have applications in all kinds of fields such as chemistry, physics, biology and as electronic devices, as well as in novel materials. Nanoparticle-polymer composites are expected to have many applications. Photochemical incorporation of stabilized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into a polymer matrix without the use of conventional photoinitiators was reported. AuNPs in the size range of 2–6 nm are modified with 5-mercapto-2,2′-bithiophene. The charge-separated states of the functionalized AuNPs generated upon exposure to UV light are active intermediates that can cause polymerization of an acrylic monomer. SEM reveals uniform distribution of the AuNPs within the matrix and a unique texture of the polymer composite (Fig. 14).50

Controlled synthesis well-defined nanoparticles is important, and a simple photochemical synthesis of bovine serum albumin (BSA) stabilized gold nanoparticles, using Irgacure I-2959 as photoinitiator, has been described. The particles are prepared in one easy step with no denaturation of the protein.51
Biological fluorescence imaging using conventional dyes is often hindered by their lack of brightness and photolability. As a means to overcoming some of thee problems, highly fluorescent conjugated polymer dots have been developed. The photophysics of a range of these conjugated polymer dots have been studied, and they have been shown to exhibit high emission rates (∼108 s−1) and excellent photostabilities with ∼109 emissions per nanoparticle before bleaching.52
The intensity and direction of photocurrents in photosensitizer-electron acceptor dyads anchored to electrodes is controlled by the orientation and composition of the subunits. DNA templates attached to electrode surfaces act as scaffolds for the assembly of the dyads, which comprise either CdS nanoparticles or Ru(II) polypyridyl complexes in conjunction with viologen units that act as relays (Fig. 15).53

The optical band gap of single-walled carbon nanotubes can be modified by insertion of an encapsulated fullerene, C60. Such modified nanotubes, called nanopeapods, have been studied by photoluminescence and excitation spectroscopy. The shifts in optical transition energies were found to depend on the nanotube diameter and the “2n + m” family type; this was attributed to the effects of local strain and hybridization between the nanotube states and the C60 molecular orbitals.54 A facile method for the functionalization of multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) by photopolymerization of 5-mercapto-2,2′-bithiophene modified metal (Au or Ag) nanoparticles on the surface of the MWCNT was developed.55
7. Photocatalysis
In scanning 24 journals, we found abstracts of at least 485 papers that would broadly fall under the title photocatalysis. Papers on TiO2 alone could take up an entire review. We have selected a few of these of relevance to organic chemistry, while trying to make the rest of our selections from a broad base of the science. Obviously, another faced with the same task would select a different set.
Highly controlled hybrid gold-tipped CdSe nanorods (nanodumbbells) were used for photoreduction by visible light of a model organic acceptor, methylene blue. Irradiation produces charge separated states between the semiconductor and metal parts of the hybrid particles.56 In a similar vein, visible-light absorption of B-doped mesoporous TiO2 depends strongly on the state of the dopant. A new O–Ti–B–N structure formed on the surface of the photocatalyst is highly active in collecting and separating the charge carriers, thereby greatly enhancing the visible light photocatalytic activity (Fig. 16).57

Self-organized, vertically oriented TiO2nanotube arrays functionalized with palladium nanoparticles were found to be excellent heterogeneous photocatalysts for rapid and efficient decomposition of nonbiodegradable azo dyes (e.g.methyl red and methyl orange), using simulated solar light, and without the need for an oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide.58

8. Two-photon and multiphoton chemistry
Two-photon/multiphoton chemistry is continually and widely investigated. It is a curiosity and fun; and it has potential application in photodynamic therapy and imaging in live cells. Looking for chemical compounds or nanomaterials with high two-photon absorption cross sections is still one of the main objectives. Semiconductor quantum dots and metal nanoparticles have attracted much attention due to their quantum confinement properties and because they show large two-photon absorption and emission.
Studies continue with the aim of using the two-photon fluorophore chemistry of gold and silver nanoparticles for biological applications. A small range of water-soluble oligonucleotide-encapsulated Ag clusters were found to exhibit large two-photon cross sections with high quantum yields in the red and near-IR.62
Fabrication of a three-dimensional (3D) nanoparticle array in polymer matrixes using a two-color two-laser irradiation system has been reported. A film of a formic acid solution of poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) containing Cu(CH3COO)2 precursor and benzophenone (BP) was used (Fig. 17).63

Four giant π-conjugated macrocycles composed of thiophene, acetylene and ethylene subunits (12 mer to 30 mer) have been synthesized (Fig. 18). These constitute 72π, 108π, 144π and 180π electron systems, and their one- and two-photon absorbance properties were investigated. It was found that increasing π-conjugation causes an increase in the two-photon absorption cross section with magnitudes as high as 100000 GM (10−50 cm4 s photon−1) in the visible.64

Benzodioxinone and naphthadioxinone can act as caged sensitizers for diaryl iodonium salts that generate acids for initiation of cationic polymerization. The first absorbed photon should uncage the sensitizer. The released sensitizer absorbs the second photon to reduce the iodonium salt yielding protonic acids for initiation of cationic polymerization (e.g.Scheme 10).65

9. Solar cells
More than 500 papers were found on “solar cells” in the journals above. We have deliberately tried to spread the area of coverage in this review, so papers on familiar topics may be left out. Our read of the literature suggests that there are substantial inconsistencies in the way things are measured and reported. Calibration from paper to paper is nearly impossible and this makes the results qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, in the aggregate. Hopefully, journal editorial boards will establish consistent policies for reporting solar energy parameters in the immediate future.
Conductive polymers, quantum dots, carbon nanotubes and metal complexes have been widely investigated in order to get high power conversion efficiency. The use of a new low band gap silole-containing conjugated polymer, PSBTBT (Fig. 19), gave a device with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 5.1%, and a response range that covers the visible spectrum.66

Two low-bandgap (LGB) conjugated polymers based on thiophene–phenylene–thiophene (TPT) have been reported. These have band gaps of 1.76 and 1.70 eV, capable of harvesting a broad solar spectrum. Use of these in a polymer cell device gave a good PCE of 4.4%.67 A polymer photovoltaic device based on a biodegradable platform was prepared by using a biodegradable poly-L-lactic acid substrate filled with nanoclay and giving it a coating of a conducting transparent anode and an evaporated aluminium cathode.68
In a study of a binary blend comprised of polyfluorene copolymers, designed to explore the reasons for the low efficiency of low band-edge organic photovoltaic devices, evidence was found for efficient recombination of tightly bound charge pairs into neutral triplet excitons (Fig. 20).69

The spectral range over which light can be collected by a semiconducting electrode can be increased by use of a sensitizing dye, and a novel class of chalcogenoxanthylium sensitizing dyes has been reported. The light harvesting efficiency is increased by dye aggregation when attached onto nanocrystalline titania films (Fig. 21).70

Processable functionalized graphene was used as the electron-accepting material in an organic photovoltaic (OPV) and shown to be a competitive alternative to the currently dominant material PCBM (a fullerene derivative). The fabrication and performance of bulk heterojunction OPV devices with this graphene and different donor materials was discussed.71 The mechanism by which so-called processing additives control the morphology of bulk heterojunction (BHJ) materials for use in solar cells was found to depend on two criteria, selective (differential) solubility of the fullerene component, and higher boiling point than the host solvent (Fig. 22). Accordingly, some 1,8-di(R)octanes with various functional groups (R) were prepared to demonstrate these criteria; the best results were for the material with R = iodine.72

A luminescent solar concentrator can be used to concentrate sunlight in a photovoltaic device; such materials usually consist of a dye dispersed in a transparent waveguide. Novel organic solar concentrators, a thin organic dye fils on glass, have been prepared, which allow 10-fold increase in the power obtained from photovoltaic cells.73
