    , Accepted 5th December 2018First published on 8th December 2018AbstractTwo porphyrin sensitizers, SGT-023 and SGT-025, were synthesized through acceptor structural engineering. SGT-023 was designed by replacing the commonly used benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit in the well-known platform of D-porphyrin-triple bond-BTD-acceptor sensitizers (e.g., SM315 and SGT-021) with a pyridothiadiazole unit as a stronger electron-withdrawing group. As for SGT-025, an additional ethynylene bridge was inserted into the acceptor part of the well-known skeleton of D-porphyrin-triple bond-BTD-acceptor sensitizers. The impact of the auxiliary acceptors on the optical, electrochemical, and photovoltaic properties was investigated and compared with a benchmark dye, SGT-021, developed by our group. Consequently, both porphyrin sensitizers could red-shift the absorption range and downshift the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which was supposed to achieve higher light harvest efficiency (LHE). Under standard global AM 1.5G solar light conditions, SGT-025 attained a relatively high maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.0%, which was slightly lower than that of the reference dye SGT-021 (12.6%), and a moderate PCE of 5.6% was obtained by SGT-023. The main reason is the lower charge collection efficiency, which can be attributed to the tilted dye adsorption mode on TiO2. This may allow for faster charge recombination which eventually leads to lower Jsc, Voc and PCE.
Introduction
In recent years, with the hazards of the greenhouse effect and concerns about exhausting fossil fuels, there has been urgency for the exploitation of clean renewable energy. Therefore, making full use of solar energy resources is one of the most realistic measures for slowing down the exhaustion of mineral resources and for improving and protecting the global ecology and environment. From these points of view, the application of photovoltaic technology has attracted much attention. However, the photovoltaic technologies only provide around 1% of the energy demand all over the world.1 Among the photovoltaic technologies, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted significant attention, because they are low cost and easy to fabricate. In 1991, mesoporous TiO2 nanocrystal layers were first introduced into a DSSC system by Grätzel and O’Regan. This led to a substantial improvement in photoelectric transformation efficiency (PCE).2 Since then, DSSCs have continued to show enhanced PCE and stability over the last 27 years.3–8 Compared with metal-free sensitizers9 and ruthenium sensitizers,10 porphyrin sensitizers are attractive owing to their remarkable light harvesting ability, tuneable electronic structures, and high molar extinction coefficients.11–14 To date, DSSCs based on porphyrin dyes have achieved PCE over 13% under standard (1.5) illumination.15
However, due to the nature of porphyrins, there are two significant drawbacks. One is the absence of absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region and the weak absorption in the range of 500–600 nm.16–19 Another drawback is the aggregation of dyes caused by the long π-conjugation structure, which leads to quenching of the porphyrin excited state and to poor electron injection efficiency.20–22 It is obvious that optimization of structures will be an effective approach to overcoming these problems, as well as enhancing photovoltaic performance. For example, inserting a benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit into the acceptor part, which leads to the well-known platform of D-porphyrin-triple bond-BTD-acceptor sensitizers (e.g., SM315 and SGT-021),14,15 has been a promising approach for further advances in photovoltaic performance, because this enhances visible and long wavelength absorbance properties.15,23–27
In this work, in order to narrow the HOMO–LUMO energy gap as well as to extend the absorption range, two strategies were introduced by modulating the acceptor group unit in the well-known platform of D-porphyrin-triple bond-BTD-acceptor sensitizers (e.g., SM315 and SGT-021). One is replacing the BTD unit by a more electron-withdrawing pyridothiadiazole unit; another one is constructing a more planar electronic skeleton by inserting an ethynylene bridge between the benzoic acid and BTD unit. Therefore, based on our previously reported dye SGT-021 which outperformed SM315, a well-known world champion porphyrin from a comparative study,14 we synthesized two porphyrin dyes, SGT-023 and SGT-025, as shown in Scheme 1. Meanwhile, the optical properties, electrochemical properties, and photovoltaic performances were systemically investigated.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The synthetic procedures for SGT-023 and SGT-025 are illustrated in Schemes 2 and 3, respectively.

The detailed synthesis procedures of SGT-023 and SGT-025 sensitizers are described in the Experimental section. The bis(2′,4′-bis(hexyloxy)-[9,9′-dimethylbifluoren]-4-yl)amino group was used as a bulky donor group in the two sensitizers, due to the fact that it tends to reduce the charge recombination rate in cobalt electrolytes and to display high photovoltage.13,14 All the 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, and Maldi-TOF data are described in the ESI.†
Absorption and electrochemical properties
The absorption spectra of the dyes SGT-023 and SGT-025 in THF solution were collected and compared with that of SGT-021 (Fig. 1). All three porphyrins exhibit an absorption feature with an intense Soret band (400 to 500 nm) and Q bands (600 to 750 nm). As shown in Table 1, the dye, SGT-021, exhibits a molar extinction coefficient (ε) of 107786 M−1 cm−1 at the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax = 455 nm), and the λmax of SGT-023 and SGT-025 are 430 nm (ε = 148658 M−1 cm−1) and 462 nm (ε = 103006 M−1 cm−1), respectively. It is worth mentioning that the Soret band peaks of SGT-021 and SGT-025 were significantly split into two peaks and the Q bands were both red-shifted upon the introduction of a pyridothiadiazole unit and an ethynylene bridge, respectively. In addition, the fluorescence emission spectra were also measured in THF (Fig. 1). For the fluorescence spectra, SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025 display major emission bands at 736, 806 and 768 nm, respectively. Therefore, the optical properties of these three porphyrin sensitizers revealed that the light-capturing region could be broadened by introducing electron withdrawing moieties or by extending the π-conjugations.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to evaluate the oxidation and reduction behaviors of these three porphyrin sensitizers (Fig. S3, ESI†); the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 2, the ground state oxidation potentials which correspond to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025 are almost the same, because they have the same donor units. Meanwhile, the reduction potentials of SGT-023, SGT-023 and SGT-025, determined from the equation (S+/S) − E0–0, were calculated to be −0.91, −0.81, and −0.86 eV, respectively. These reduction potential differences may be attributed to the change of molecular structure in the acceptor unit. The observed results also revealed that the Eox values are much more positive than that of the Co(bpy)32+/3+ (bpy = 2,2′-bipyridine) redox couple (0.56 V vs. NHE) and that the Ered values are much more negative than the conduction band (CB) of TiO2. This indicates that all three of these porphyrin dyes have sufficient driving force for dye regeneration and charge injection.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
DFT calculations at the M0628/6-31G29–31 (LANL2DZ32–34 for Zn atom) level were carried out to investigate the molecular geometries and electron distribution. The optimized ground state molecular structures and corresponding dihedral angles are shown in Fig. 3 and Table S1 (ESI†). The HOMO of all three porphyrin sensitizers was mainly delocalized at the donor unit. The location of the LUMO in SGT-023 displayed a more obvious shift towards the benzoic acid unit than in SGT-021. Hence, compared to SGT-021, an enhanced charge transfer character was expected in the case of SGT-023. Notably, SGT-025 showed less electron occupation on benzoic acid due to the insertion of the ethynylene bridge. In the optimized structures of SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025, the dihedral angles between benzoic acid and the adjacent auxiliary acceptor are 34.03°, 16.89° and 2.22°, respectively. Owing to the reduction of the torsion angle, SGT-023 and SGT-025 displayed a better coplanar geometry and more effective π-conjugation than SGT-021, but this geometry increased the possibility of dye aggregation. Moreover, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the simulated absorption spectra also exhibited the same tendency when compared with the experimental UV absorption spectra.

Photovoltaic characteristics
The photovoltaic properties of the devices based on SGT-023, SGT-025 and reference dye SGT-021 were evaluated under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G solar light with the Co(bpy)32+/3+ redox couple as the electrolyte and with CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) as the co-adsorbent. The relevant photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 3 and the device parameters are summarized in Table 2. As compared to the reference dye SGT-021 (Jsc = 16.9 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.848 V, FF = 75.8% and PCE = 10.8%), the pyridothiadiazole incorporated dye SGT-023 only showed a moderate PCE of 2.0%. The Jsc value of SGT-023 dramatically dropped to 3.4 mA cm−2 and its Voc also decreased to 0.739 V. The π-conjugation extended dye SGT-025 showed a power conversion efficiency of 9.1%, and the Voc value (0.819 V) was similar to that of SGT-021 but the Jsc value (14.1 mA cm−2) was relatively lower than that of SGT-021. The corresponding IPCE (incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency) spectra of SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025-based devices were measured under 100 mW cm−2 simulated AM 1.5G solar light. As shown in Fig. 4, when compared to SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025 sensitizers exhibited a broader absorption response (the absorption onset extended to 850 nm), which is consistent with the absorption spectra on TiO2 films shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). In contrast, the SGT-023-based device displayed a quite low IPCE value (no more than 20%) from 400 to 900 nm, thereby limiting the Jsc values. As for SGT-025-based cells, although the IPCE spectral shape is similar to that of SGT-021, it displayed a relatively lower IPCE intensity.

To further improve the photovoltaic performance of these porphyrin sensitizers, another co-adsorbent, HC-A1, was introduced in this study. As a multi-functional co-adsorbent, HC-A1 has been used in our previous research studies,9,13 and its structure is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). As expected, due to the efficient reduction of charge recombination and light harvesting in shorter wavelength regions,35–38 the PCE values of SGT-023 and SGT-025-based solar cells were dramatically improved to 5.6% and 11.0%, respectively (see Fig. 5). Notably, by changing the co-adsorbent, the device of SGT-021 achieved an extremely high PCE of 12.6%, which is higher than the PCE (12.0%) reported by our previous work.16 In addition, the dye loading amounts were found to be similar for SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025, indicating that the impact of the dye loading amount on photovoltaic performance is relatively small in this study.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
To investigate the interfacial charge transfer in all DSSC devices, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was measured in the dark. Nyquist plots and Bode plots are shown in Fig. 6, and the EIS data are shown in Table 3. The second semicircle increases in the order SGT-023 (8.64 Ω) < SGT-025 (23.85 Ω) < SGT-021 (53.38 Ω), indicating that the electron recombination rate increases in the order SGT-021 < SGT-025 < SGT-023. On the other hand, according to the equation τr = Cμ·Rrec, the electron lifetime was calculated to be 15.92, 4.21 and 9.43 ms for SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025, respectively. Meanwhile, the charge-collection efficiency ηcc, derived from ηcc = (1 + Rtr/Rrec)−1,39 was confirmed to be 96.03% (SGT-021), 73.48% (SGT-023) and 90.68% (SGT-025). The results observed above are consistent with the observed Voc values for SGT-021 (0.848 V), SGT-023 (0.739 V) and SGT-025 (0.819 V). Thus, when compared to SGT-021 and SGT-025, the highest charge recombination rate and the lowest charge collection efficiency of the SGT-023-based device may be the main reason for its disappointing lower photovoltaic performance.

Time-resolved photoluminescence
To further explore the influence of different acceptors on the charge injection efficiency (ηinj), we measured the time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) on Al2O3 and TiO2 films (Fig. S5 and Table S2, ESI†). The averaged lifetimes exhibited at the Al2O3 and sensitizer interface were 0.169, 0.071 and 0.063 ns for SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025, respectively. As for TiO2 and sensitizer surface, the averaged lifetime decreased to 0.021, 0.014 and 0.010 ns for SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025, respectively. According to the equation ηinj = 1 − (τTiO2)/(τAl2O3), the ηinj values of SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025 were calculated to be 87.5, 80.6 and 84.2%, respectively. According to the equation IPCE (λ) = LHE × APCE = LHE × ηinj × ηcol, the different electron injection efficiency and charge collection efficiency values caused by various acceptor units will significantly influence the IPCE value as well as the photocurrent density. Thus, the obvious lower ηinj and ηcol values are the main reason for the fact that the SGT-023 based device showed an extremely low Jsc value.
Adsorption mode of the porphyrin sensitizers on the TiO2 surface
To find the structural reason for the moderate PCEs observed for SGT-023 and SGT-025, the FT-IR spectra of the dye powders and of the dyes adsorbed on transparent TiO2 nanoparticles were investigated (Fig. 7). For the dye powders of SGT-021, SGT-023 and SGT-025, the CO stretching band of the carboxyl group was observed at 1734, 1735 and 1732 cm−1, respectively. After the three dyes were adsorbed on the TiO2 surface, the FT-IR spectra revealed the disappearance of the CO stretching bands, which demonstrated the formation of bidentate binding between the carboxylate functional group and the TiO2 surface.40,41 Notably, for the dye powder of SGT-023, the CN stretching band of the pyridothiadiazole unit was observed at 1608 cm−1. However, this band was shifted to 1627 cm−1 after adsorption on the TiO2 film. This shift may be attributed to the formation of a coordination bond between the nitrogen atom in the pyridothiadiazole group and the TiO2 surface.42–45 By comparison, the CC stretching band of both SGT-021 and SGT-025 displayed no shift after adsorption on the TiO2 film, indicating a difference in the coordination mode between these two porphyrin sensitizers. Therefore, the SGT-023 sensitizers tend to be adsorbed on TiO2 with a big tilt angle (see Fig. 8). Moreover, SGT-025 is longer than SGT-021 due to the insertion of the ethynylene bridge, so it will also tend to tilt intensively on TiO2, but SGT-021 will tilt less than SGT-023. Thus, the tilt angle probably increases in the order SGT-021 < SGT-025 < SGT-023. This dye adsorption mode on TiO2 may cause a faster charge recombination, which leads to lower power conversion efficiency.46,47 In order to prove this point, we also utilized X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to investigate the adsorption mode of sensitizers, and the N1s XPS spectra of the SGT-023 powder and the SGT-023-sensitized TiO2 surface were compared in detail. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), all the N1s XPS spectra have intense peaks at around 398.0 eV and 399.3 eV and a relatively weak peak at around 400.0 eV, which can be assigned to the four nitrogen atoms of zinc porphyrins, two nitrogen atoms of the benzothiadiazole (BTD) unit and one nitrogen atom of diphenylamine, respectively.48–52 In particular, upon comparing the N1s XPS spectra of the SGT-023 powder and the SGT-023-sensitized TiO2 surface, we can easily find that the peak intensity at 398.8 eV derived from the nitrogen atom of the CN–C bond of pyridothiadiazole disappeared and a new peak at around 401.3 eV emerged. Positive shifts in the binding energy of N1s are known to be caused by the transfer of the lone pair electrons on pyridine-type nitrogen into acidic sites on a metal oxide surface.40,53,54 Thus, from the XPS study, we can conclude that the pyridine-type nitrogen in SGT-023 would tend to adsorb on the TiO2 surface with a big tilt angle, which is in agreement with the results obtained from FT-IR spectra.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of porphyrin sensitizers based on different acceptors have been developed in order to investigate the structure–performance relationship between the photovoltaic performance and the structure of various acceptors in the well-known platform of D-porphyrin-triple bond-BTD-acceptor sensitizers. The effects of an ethynyl-substituted pyridothiadiazole unit (SGT-023) and an additional ethynylene bridge (SGT-025) in D–π–A porphyrin sensitizers were evaluated, and the photophysical and electrochemical properties were compared with the BTD unit used in the SGT-021 sensitizer. The Q bands of SGT-023 and SGT-025 were red-shifted and broadened compared to those of SGT-021. This indicates that the introduction of both pyridothiadiazole and extended ethynylene bridges are effective strategies for strengthening the absorption of porphyrin sensitizers. Even though the SGT-021-based device reached an extremely high PCE of 12.6%, a moderate PCE of 5.6% and a relatively high PCE of 11.0% were displayed by SGT-023 and SGT-025-based DSSCs, respectively. The serious efficiency loss for the SGT-023-based device could be ascribed to a fast charge recombination rate caused by the tilted adsorption mode on the TiO2 surface. Meanwhile, the extended π-conjugation in SGT-025 leads to an unexpected dye aggregation caused by the enhanced backbone co-planarity. Our study has underlined the importance of the adsorbed mode for a sensitizer and this should be seriously considered in future rational designs of dye-sensitized solar cells.

Compound 2. 
To a solution of compound 1 (200 mg, 0.55 mmol) in THF (30 mL) and methanol (15 mL) was added a solution of 20% NaOH (aq.) (8 mL). The solution was refluxed for 4 hours. At this time, TLC (silica, dichloromethane) indicated complete hydrolysis of the ester. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 100 mL), washed with HCl (1 M) and water. After filtration and drying at ambient temperature, the crude dark yellow product compound 2 was used to synthesize SGT-023 without further purification.
