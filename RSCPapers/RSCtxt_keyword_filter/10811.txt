    , Accepted 5th October 2015First published on 5th October 2015AbstractHerein we report a simple n-doping method to enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells with a planar heterojunction structure. Devices with an n-doped PCBM electron transporting layer exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 13.8% with a remarkably enhanced short-circuit current of 22.0 mA cm−2 as compared to the devices with an un-doped PCBM layer.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have recently attracted enormous attention as the next generation material for solar cells because of their superior intrinsic properties such as extremely long exciton diffusion length, high absorption coefficient, and excellent charge carrier transport.1 A dramatic enhancement of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells has been achieved over the last few years.2 The conventional n–i–p structure with mesoporous TiO2/methylammonium lead trihalide perovskite (CH3NH3PbX3, X = Cl−, Br−, I−)/hole transporting material has widely been used and its PCE has currently exceeded 20%.2e However, since the formation of TiO2 layer requires a high temperature sintering process (>450 °C), it is imperative to develop low-temperature and solution processable perovskite solar cells. Very recently, a planar heterojunction (PHJ) structure with a configuration of anode/hole transporting layer/perovskite/electron transporting layer (ETL)/cathode has attracted considerable attention because of its simple structure and low-temperature fabrication process.3
For PHJ perovskite solar cells, fullerene derivatives such as C60, phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM), PC71BM, and indene–C60 bisadduct (ICBA) have commonly been used as the ETL material because of their room temperature solubility and orthogonal solvent processability on the perovskite layer.4 The thickness of the ETL is very critical for achieving high performance PHJ perovskite solar cells, because a sufficiently thick ETL is required to prevent direct contact between the rough perovskite layer and the metal cathode.3c However, low electron mobility and low electrical conductivity of fullerene derivatives may limit the ETL thickness. When the thickness of PCBM was increased to 100 nm or thicker, the solar cell performance was notably diminished because of largely increased charge recombination.5 Therefore, it is needed to increase the electrical conductivity of fullerene derivatives. One of the effective ways to increase the electrical conductivity of fullerenes is to dope or modify them, which may allow us to increase the ETL thickness and thus to achieve the performance enhancement of PHJ perovskite solar cells.
1,3-Dimethyl-2-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzoimidazole (DMBI) has been reported as an effective n-type dopant for enhancing the electrical properties of n-type materials such as fullerene or naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives.6 Since DMBI has good solubility in common organic solvents, the doping is easily achieved by simply mixing with n-type material in organic solvents. It has been reported that DMBI-doped PCBM films show remarkably increased electrical conductivity (from 8.1 × 10−8 S cm−1 to 1.9 × 10−3 S cm−1) and enhanced air stability.6a It was also reported that an organic solar cell with the DMBI-doped NDI-based ETL exhibited an enhanced PCE (from 0.69% to 3.42%).6d Despite the effectiveness of DMBI derivatives as n-type dopants, the doping of DMBI to fullerene derivatives in organic solar cells has not been studied yet. Since the PHJ structure of perovskite solar cells contains a PCBM layer as the ETL, DMBI is expected to effectively dope the PCBM and thus to enhance the solar cell performance of perovskite solar cells.
In this report, we introduce an n-type dopant, DMBI, to dope the PCBM in perovskite solar cells with an inverted p–i–n structure. PCBM is effectively n-doped by simple mixing with DMBI, as clearly evidenced by an up-shift of the Fermi level of PCBM upon addition of a small amount of DMBI. The solar cell device with the n-doped PCBM ETL exhibits an enhanced PCE with a remarkable enhancement of short-circuit current (JSC) as compared to the device with an un-doped PCBM layer. The improved electron transporting properties of PCBM by n-doping decrease the series resistance and thus increase the fill factor (FF). The best device exhibits a high PCE of 13.8% with a JSC of 22.0 mA cm−2 under illumination of AM 1.5 G 100 mW cm−2. Especially, the effect of doping is more prominent when the thickness of the PCBM layer is increased.
DMBI, an n-type dopant for the ETL of PHJ perovskite solar cells, was synthesized by reacting N,N′-dimethyl-o-phenylenediamine with benzaldehyde according to the literature.6c Synthesized DMBI has good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene, and therefore the n-doped PCBM layer is easily fabricated by spin-coating of a mixed solution of PCBM and DMBI in a common solvent. The electrical conductivity of the DMBI-doped PCBM film is 6.1 × 10−5 S cm−1 which is 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the pristine PCBM film (3.8 × 10−9 S cm−1), as measured for the device with a planar diode structure by a probe station (see the ESI†), indicating that the doping by DMBI largely increases the electrical conductivity of PCBM. When UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of pure PCBM and DMBI-doped PCBMs were measured and compared, as shown in Fig. 1, the DMBI-doped PCBM films exhibit a broad peak centered at 900 nm, while the peak intensity increases with the doping concentration, indicating that PCBM radical anions are formed in DMBI-doped PCBM.7 Therefore, it is concluded that DMBI effectively dopes the PCBM in the simple mixture by donating an electron to PCBM.
 Fig. 1  UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of pure PCBM film and DMBI-doped PCBM films with various doping concentrations. All films are fabricated by spin-coating the chloroform solution on glass. 
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) spectra were measured to examine the change in the Fermi level and the HOMO energy level with doping (Fig. 2). The work functions of films are determined by subtracting the binding energy cutoffs in the high binding energy region (Fig. 2a) from the He I photon energy (21.22 eV), while the binding energy cutoffs in the low binding energy region (Fig. 2b) indicate the energy gap between the Fermi levels and the HOMO energy level. The work function of PCBM is decreased from 5.04 eV to 4.78 eV upon addition of 1 wt% DMBI, as can be seen in Fig. 3c, and further addition of DMBI does not cause a significantly further decrease of work function (Fig. 2a). In other words, the addition of DMBI shifts the Fermi level of PCBM toward the LUMO energy level, which is further evidence of n-doping. Therefore, the up-shift of the Fermi level due to n-doping of PCBM leads us to expect the enhancement of the electron transporting properties of PCBM and thereby an increase in the photocurrent of the solar cell device with the n-doped PCBM ETL.

When the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of perovskite solar cells are measured with an inverted device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PCBM or PCBM:DMBI/Ca/Al (Fig. 3a), JSC is notably enhanced by the addition of DMBI to the 50 nm-thick PCBM ETL, as shown in Fig. 4a and Table 1. The PCE is increased from 12.3% with a JSC of 19.1 mA cm−2 to 13.0% with a JSC of 21.0 mA cm−2, when 1 wt% DMBI is added. Particularly, the increase of JSC upon addition of 1 wt% DMBI is attributed to an increased number of free electrons due to the up-shift of the Fermi level. Increased electrical conductivity of DMBI-doped PCBM film is clear evidence of this argument. When the addition of DMBI is further increased, both JSC and VOC remain nearly unchanged while FF is decreased, indicating that the optimum addition of DMBI is 1 wt%. The reason for the decrease of FF will be discussed later.

Fabrication of a thick PCBM layer has an advantage of easy processing in industry while the increase of the PCBM layer thickness decreases the PCE probably due to increased recombination and high series resistance, which arise mainly from the low electrical conductivity of PCBM.8 Hence, an increase of the electrical conductivity of PCBM is essential for the fabrication of a thick PCBM layer without compromising the device performance. Therefore, the dramatically increased electrical conductivity of PCBM by n-doping may lead to high PCE in the devices with a thick PCBM layer. When one compares the doping effect on the photovoltaic performance for thin PCBM (Fig. 4a) with that for a thick PCBM layer (Fig. 4b), it is revealed that the doping effect by DMBI is more remarkable than for the thick PCBM layer. As shown in Fig. 4b, the device with a 105 nm-thick PCBM layer exhibits an S-shaped J–V curve with a low FF of 0.55, while the device with 1 wt% DMBI-doped PCBM shows a remarkably improved FF of 0.72, probably due to reduced series resistance (Table S1, ESI†), and as a result the PCE is increased from 8.9% (JSC = 19.6 mA cm−2 and VOC = 0.83 V) to 13.8% (JSC = 22.0 mA cm−2 and VOC = 0.87 V) upon addition of 1 wt% DMBI. The JSC values calculated from the external quantum efficiency spectra also show that JSC increases when PCBM is doped by DMBI (see Fig. S1 and Table S1, ESI†), which are very consistent with the JSCs measured from the J–V curves within 5% error. Since it has been well recognized that the charge accumulation is the key factor for the S-shaped curve,9 the above result leads us to conclude that the doping by DMBI increases the electrical conductivity of PCBM and therefore prevents charge accumulation by generating free electrons in the PCBM layer. In short, the addition of a small amount of DMBI (1 wt%) allows us to fabricate the devices with a thick PCBM layer without loss in the solar cell performance.
When the addition of DMBI is increased more than 1 wt%, the FF of the device is slightly decreased for both cases of thin and thick ETLs, as shown in Table 1. The atomic force microscopy images of the film surfaces have revealed that the pristine PCBM film and 1 wt% doped PCBM film have a smooth surface while PCBM films doped with 3 wt% and higher DMBI show a rough surface with large aggregates (Fig. 5). The rough surface inevitably causes poor contact between the ETL and the cathode, resulting in the increase of series resistance (Table S1, ESI†). Hence, excessive doping may worsen the device performance, especially decreasing the FF.

When we measure the hysteresis of devices, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), we realize that all devices exhibit stable J–V curves without significant hysteresis with respect to the scan direction. However, the devices with high doping concentration (>3 wt%) exhibit weak hysteresis. Although the origin of the hysteresis has not clearly been identified, the trap sites, ferroelectric properties of perovskites and ion migration have been proposed as possible reasons. Hence, we have assumed that the hysteresis of our devices with high doping concentration is caused by an increase of trap sites due to DMBI doping.
In summary, we first introduced an n-type dopant, DMBI, to dope the PCBM ETL in PHJ perovskite solar cells. PCBM was effectively doped by DMBI, which was evidenced by UV-Vis-NIR absorption and UPS measurements. Solar cell devices with the n-doped PCBM ETL exhibit higher PCE with remarkably increased JSC as compared to the un-doped device, mainly due to the up-shift of the Fermi level of PCBM. The best device shows a high PCE of 13.8% with a JSC of 22.0 mA cm−2. Furthermore, since the effect of DMBI-doping on the photovoltaic performance is more prominent for the device with a thicker PCBM layer, this method allows us to fabricate a thicker ETL, which has a benefit of industrial processing of device fabrication. In short, this simple doping method can be an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of PHJ perovskite solar cells.
