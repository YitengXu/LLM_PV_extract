ChinaReceived 4th May 2013, Accepted 4th July 2013First published on 8th July 2013AbstractWe demonstrated an environmentally friendly photoanode composed of nano-flower structured hematite (α-Fe2O3) and a photocathode composite made of reduced graphene oxide–polyaniline (PANI-RGO) for efficient dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The porous petals–root structure of the α-Fe2O3 film characterized by different structural means (XRD, SEM, HRTEM, SAED and N2 adsorption–desorption) was demonstrated to provide an efficient pathway for the charge carrier transfer of DSSCs. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) profiles suggested a broad photo-response spectral region of up to 700 nm in the presence of nano-flower α-Fe2O3 in the photoanode. The PANI-RGO composite coated on the counter electrode was proven to have a higher photon-to-electron conversion efficiency than the conventional Pt, which is attributed to the improved electro-catalytic activity and conductivity of PANI-RGO. It was found that the energy conversion efficiency (1.24%) achieved from PANI-RGO as photocathode material is increased by a factor of 1.3 compared with Pt. The better electro-catalytic activity of PANI-RGO CE is brought about by a synergistic effect between PANI and RGO, which was verified by micro-Raman spectroscopy and electrochemical characterizations (CV, EIS).1. IntroductionSince the past two decades, intensive efforts have been dedicated to the so-called third generation of solar cells represented by dye-sensitized solar cells, because this type of cells offers compatibility with flexible substrates, low cost, easy fabrication, and high photon-to-electron conversion efficiency which allows them to compete with fossil fuel electrical generation.1 The most important step in the fabrication of DSSCs is to seek for photoelectrode materials that have high efficiency in charge carrier injection and pronounced photoelectrochemical stability in electrolytes where harsh redox reactions could take place. Titanium dioxide (TiO2) was usually thought of as a good material for photoanodes, as it has high photochemical stability. However, TiO2 has a large band gap of ∼3.0 eV and hence can only be photo-excited by UV light (<400 nm in wavelength), which is just 5% of solar light in energy percentage. Therefore, materials that exhibit broader photo-response in the visible region are strongly recommended to improve the energy conversion efficiency, although the photo absorbance is partly contributed by the sensitizer dye molecules. Hematite (α-Fe2O3), an n-type indirect semiconductor (Eg = 2.1 eV) which is sufficient to utilize ∼40% of sunlight,2 has received much attention as a promising material with many applications as catalyst,3 pigment,4 gas sensor,5 electrode material,2 and in water splitting6 in view of its low cost, superior stability against photocorrosion, natural abundance, and environmental inertness.7 As the most stable allotrope among the iron oxides under ambient conditions, α-Fe2O3 has fascinating physicochemical properties in aqueous solution and a relatively small band gap for the absorption of visible light.8 It has been reported that the co-semiconductor Fe2O3/TiO2 can effectively increase in the contact area between the TiO2 and the dye, and thus prevent electron recombination in the HOMO of the dye and the electrolyte.9 However, unfortunately α-Fe2O3 normally shows a low energy conversion efficiency (<0.1%) because of its small optical absorption coefficient and low carrier mobility.10 The photon penetration depth (α−1) in hematite is around 118 nm at a wavelength of 550 nm, and α−1 produces the majority of photo-generated carriers at a distance of less than 100 nm from the semiconductor liquid junction.10a The ultrafast recombination of the photo-generated carriers (time constants ∼10 ps) along with the poor minority charge carrier mobility (0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1) leads to a short length (2–4 nm) of hole diffusion.11 As a result, the overall photocurrents produced by the bulk hematite as a photoanode material would be severely limited due to lower efficiency in holes collection. One way to improve the efficiency of the injected photocurrent into the anode could be the control of morphology, size and porosity of the hematite layers which were deposited on the photoanode.12 Compared to the particulate layers, the photo-electrodes modified with porous Fe2O3 layer show advantages in superior charge transfer, collection efficiency, full contact between the semiconductor layer and the electrode substrate, and excellent capability in harvesting the light owning to their large surface area and the special structure.13 Therefore, studying the effects on the photovoltaic properties by the structural control is of great importance in both applications and fundamental research.Thin films of Pt are usually used as the catalysts coated on the counter electrode (CE) or photocathode for DSSCs.14 Due to the cost-effect and a problem in the long-term stability, alternative materials such as conducting polymers, carbon materials or composites, have been investigated in view of replacing Pt in DSSCs.15 Among these materials, graphene is an ideal carbon material for the counter electrode as well as the catalyst. Graphene is a substance made of pure carbon, with atoms arranged in close-packed conjugated hexagonal lattices similar to graphite, but in a one-atom thick sheet. The atomic thin layers endows it superior electronic conductivity, chemical stability, and high surface area (theoretical value 2600 m2 g−1), and these properties are appealing for the fabrication of photovoltaic devices.16 However, to fabricate the graphene modified electrode, the difficulty lies in the step of deposition in getting a uniform layer on the electrode substrate because pure graphene does not have any functional groups, and thus few bonds that induce the adsorption between graphene and the substrates. Furthermore, single layer graphene sheets tend to stack with each other, and no uniformity with closely packing layers on the electrode was obtained. Thus the conductivity of the graphene film is quite low as a result.17 To overcome this difficulty, one can apply an oxidant to the graphene, and make graphene oxide (GO) to increase the amount of additional functional groups (–OH, O, –O–, etc.). One can make a composite by mixing GO with other conductive polymers. A typical polymer is polyaniline (PANI) that has been widely used in electronic conductivity devices due to its facile synthesis, environmental stability and good electrical conductivity.18 The use of PANI as photoanode in solar cells has been reported,19 however a main hindrance in obtaining a better photon-to-current conversion efficiency is the lower surface area of the polymer.20 Therefore, the composition of GO and PANI is promising in view of enhancing the surface area, electron mobility, specific conductivity, electrochemical reversibility, excellent photo absorption capability, and ease of fabrication for a film electrode in DSSCs.Herein we demonstrate a new type of DSSCs fabricated with hierarchically structured α-Fe2O3 with a flower shape as the photoanode and a reduced graphene oxide–polyaniline (PANI-RGO) composite film as the photocathode. A schematic representation of the prepared DSSCs is illustrated in Scheme 1. The flower-shaped α-Fe2O3 was synthesized via alcoholysis of FeCl3·6H2O. The photocathode material PANI-RGO composite film was synthesized by in situ polymerization of aniline monomer in a suspension of GO–acid solution. By virtue of the unique hierarchical mesoporous structure and relative high specific surface area, the flower-shaped α-Fe2O3 exhibited enhanced photon-to-electron conversion efficiency. The superior electro-catalytic activity and conductivity of composite PANI-RGO in CE layers has been demonstrated to show better performance than those based on commercial Pt used in DSSCs. Scheme 1  Scheme of the assembled dye-sensitized solar cells using α-Fe2O3 as cathode and PANI-RGO as anode. 2. Experimental2.1 MaterialsAll the reagents of analytical purity were used as received. Graphite was purchased from Beijing Chemical agents Co. Ltd. Iodine, 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP), guanidinium thiocyanate, and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) were provided by Sigma-Aldrich. The dye cis-diisothiocyanato-bis(2,2-bipyridyl-4,4- dicarboxylato) ruthenium-(II) bis-(tetrabutyl-ammonium) (N719, >95%) was obtained from Solaronix SA, Switzerland.2.2 Synthesis2.2.1 Synthesis of flowerlike α-Fe2O3 hierarchical nanostructure. In a typical experiment,21 0.9 g of FeCl3·6H2O and 1.2 g of urea were dissolved in 150 mL of ethylene glycol under magnetic stirring. The suspension was then transferred to a 200 mL teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. After sealing, the autoclave was treated at 160 °C for 8 h. The product was collected by centrifugation followed by washing with absolute ethanol several times, followed by drying in vacuum at 60 °C for 6 h. The powders were then calcined at the temperature of 500 °C for 10 min in air atmosphere. After the sample was cooled naturally, the final red α-Fe2O3 powders were collected and preserved in a desiccator prior to characterization or assembly of DSSCs. For comparison, Fe2O3 powders were prepared via hydrothermal means from FeCl3·6H2O and NaOH in aqueous solution.2.2.2 Preparation of graphene oxide (GO). Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized via a modified Hummers' method.22 Briefly, graphite (2.0 g) was treated in concentrated sulfuric acid (98%, 150 mL) in the presence of NaNO3 (1.5 g) at room temperature for 2 h. Afterwards KMnO4 (9.0 g) was added to the mixture at a temperature of ∼5 °C, and the suspension was stirred for another 2 h. The slurry was further magnetically stirred for five days at room temperature followed by dilution with 280 mL water. The solution was then heated to 98 °C and maintained at this temperature for 2 h. After cooling down to 60 °C, 6 mL hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%) solution were added, and the mixture was continuously stirred overnight. The product was filtrated and washed by copious deionized water. The final product designated as graphene oxide (GO) was re-dispersed in 50 mL water to prepare the stock solution.2.2.3 Synthesis of polyaniline-reduced–graphene oxide (PANI-RGO) composite. Typically, GO stock solution (10.0 mL) was mixed with 120 mL of HClO4 solution (1 M), ethanol (50 mL) and aniline (0.1 g) under magnetic stirring. Then ammonium persulfate (0.16 g) diluted with 40 mL of HClO4 solution (1 M) was added in the mixture. The dispersion was kept at −14 °C for 12 h. Finally the green composite was collected by filtration followed by washing with water and ethanol. It should be pointed out that reduction of GO takes place in this experiment which was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy. Therefore we named this composite as PANI-RGO. All the experiments took place under vigorous stirring.2.3 Fabrication of DSSCs2.3.1 Preparation of Fe2O3 paste. Fe2O3 powders (0.1 g) were placed in an agate mortar, and 5.0 mL of ethanol were added into the mortar. The Fe2O3 powders were ground for 30 min. The ground Fe2O3 was then transferred to a solution of ethanol (50 mL), terpineol (4.0 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.60 g) in a 100 mL beaker under magnetic stirring. The dispersion was homogenized by means of ultrasonic and magnetic stirring for 3 h. Finally, the solvent was removed by a rotary evaporator at 45 °C until a concentration of Fe2O3 of 14% wt. was obtained.2.3.2 Dsscs assembly. A layer of Fe2O3 was coated on the cleaned fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (Nippon Sheet Glass Co., Surface Resistance = 15 Ω/cm2, Transmittance = 90%) by using a screen-printing technique. The film was dried at 125 °C for 6 min, and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min to remove any organic compounds. The Fe2O3 films were then immersed in 75 mM of TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min.23 Then the electrodes coated with TiCl4 were sintered at 500 °C for another 30 min before dye sensitization. The Fe2O3 electrodes with an active area of 0.25 cm2 were immersed in a N719/ethanol (0.5 mM) solution for 24 h. The electrodes were rinsed with ethanol to remove any excess dye before the DSSCs were assembled. Different materials including Pt screened–printed or PANI-RGO were used as photocathode modifiers. The redox electrolyte is I−/I3− couple (LiI (10.0 mM), I2 (1.0 mM), and LiClO4 (0.10 M) dissolved in acetonitrile). The DSSCs were sealed with Surlyn sealant (Surlyn1702, Dupont).2.4 CharacterizationX-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were conducted on an X′Pert PROS (Philips Co.) with a radiation of Cu-Kα (λ = 1.54060 Å). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements were undertaken by using a field emission environmental scanning electron microscope (Sirion 200, FEI Co.). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) were used to study the microstructure of the materials by a JEM-2100F (JEOL) instrument. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Multimode V, BRUKER) was used to study the topographic morphology and the thickness of GO coated on the electrode. Micro-Raman measurements of the samples were carried out using a spectrometer (LABRAM-HR, JY) excited by an incident laser (λ = 532 nm). N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were recorded on a BET Tristar II 3020 M instrument (Micromeritics Co.), and the specific surface areas (SBET) were calculated using the BET equation. A desorption isotherm was used to determine the pore size distribution using the Barret–Joyner–Halender (BJH) method. The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs was measured under a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 3A Solar Simulator, 94063A, Newport Stratford Inc.), equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (Newport) and a digital source meter (Keithley, 2400) controlled by Testpoint software. The irradiation intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm2 with standard reference crystalline silicon solar cell. The incident monochromatic photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) plotted as a function of excitation wavelength was recorded on a QTest Station 1000 ADI system (Crowntech, Inc.). The measurements were carried out by placing a monochromator between the dye-sensitized solar cells and the light source (100 mW cm2). The electro-catalytic activities and their conductivities of the counter electrodes were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS). The experiments were recorded on CHI 660C (Chenhua. Co.), and the electrolyte is acetonitrile with I3−/I− species dissolved as mentioned above. For EIS measurement of a symmetric thin-layer cell consisting of two identical electrodes, the applied bias was set at zero voltage with an AC amplitude of 10 mV, and a scanned frequency range of 100 kHz–0.1 Hz was applied. The EIS data were fitted according to an equivalent circuit by using Zview software. The CV was scanned in a three-electrode cell: the working electrode, Ag/Ag+ electrode (reference) and a platinum wire (counter electrode) at a rate of 50 mV s−1.3. Results and discussion3.1 Characterization of photoanode materialThe SEM and TEM images of the α-Fe2O3 synthesized via ethylene glycol hydrothermal method are shown in Fig. 1. The low-magnification SEM image demonstrates that the material is composed of many interconnected flower-shaped granules, and the average diameter of each granule is 2–3 μm (Fig. 1a). A porous structure is observed either between the granules or the flower petals. A magnified flower (Fig. 1b) shows that the granule consists of many petals or sheets. The petals have an average length of about 500 nm. Every petal can be one piece of crystal. The sheets are randomly assembled and irregularly shaped, but they grow from the same root. The TEM image of a single petal is shown in Fig. 3c which demonstrates that the petal has the shape of a trapezoid and a smooth surface. The corresponding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern shows a hexagonal-like spot array. This type of pattern suggests that the sheet is a single-crystal, and the crystal structure can be indexed to a hexagonal type of α-Fe2O3. Fig. 1d shows the lattice-resolved HRTEM image obtained for a single flower petal. The spacing values of the lattice fringes are determined to be 0.22, 0.25, and 0.28 nm, which is consistent with d spacing of the planes (11  3), (11  0), and (10  4) in hexagonal hematite (α-Fe2O3). We also observed the SEM morphology when the flower-shaped Fe2O3 was screen printed on an electrode (FTO). Fig. 1e displays the front view of the electrode, from which we find that the flower structure is preserved. A close-packing Fe2O3 flower is also observed. The thickness (∼2 μm) of the film is evaluated according to the cross-sectional view (Fig. 1f). We also observed the porous structure inside the film which was formed by the stack of the Fe2O3 petals. It is easy to understand that the porous framework of the α-Fe2O3 film would provide a hierarchical pathway for the charge carrier transfer, which is favorable for its potential use in photovoltaic devices.24 Fig. 1  (a, b) SEM and (c, d) TEM images of the flower-shaped α-Fe2O3 particles; The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of a single petal shown in Fig. 1c is displayed as an inset; (e, f) SEM images of the α-Fe2O3 photoanode with TiCl4 treatment: (e) front view; (f) cross-sectional view. The crystallinity and phase of the prepared Fe2O3 were also determined by using powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy. The XRD pattern of the sintered Fe2O3 sample is displayed in Fig. 2a. All diffraction peaks are well indexed to the rhomb-centered hexagonal α-Fe2O3 (JCPDS Card No. 80-2377, space group R  c (167), a0 = 5.0 Å, c0 = 13.7 Å). No other peaks are observed indicating the high purity of the as-prepared α-Fe2O3. This result is consistent with the HRTEM and SAED analyses. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption measurements were carried out to evaluate the specific surface area and pore size of the flowerlike α-Fe2O3 (Fig. 2b). The isotherm can be categorized as type IV according to the adsorption classification (BET). A distinct hysteresis loop was observed in the range of 0.5–1.0 P/P0. The specific surface area of flowerlike α-Fe2O3 hierarchical nanostructure is 47.6 m2 g−1. The surface area is almost twice the irregular shaped Fe2O3 powders (28.4 m2 g−1) prepared via hydrothermal means where only irregular shapes were synthesized. The BJH analyses show that the flower α-Fe2O3 particles possess bimodal porous distribution, and the distribution profile calculated from the desorption branch of the isotherms demonstrates a combination of mesopores (5–20 nm) and micropores (4–5 nm) (inset in Fig. 2b). To demonstrate the influence of a particular shape and the specific area on the adsorbing performance of the sensitizers (N719 dye molecules), we carried out UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy studies on the film α-Fe2O3 adsorbed with dye molecules. As shown in Fig. 2c, the amount of dye desorbed from the film of flower shaped α-Fe2O3 is 30% higher than for the regular Fe2O3 particles. The result demonstrates that the porous structured Fe2O3 film benefits the immobilization of N719 dye molecules.

Fig. 3a and 3b show AFM images in topographic mode of a GO film on a FTO substrate. We observed randomly oriented GO layers that were located on the substrate. Most layers have smooth surfaces, and the average thickness is around 0.88 nm. Others are aggregates that are formed by overlapping with each other. The cross-section analysis along a line in Fig. 3b is illustrated in Fig. 3c. Compared with the elementary thickness of graphene (0.33 nm), we inferred that our obtained GO are highly exfoliated during the oxidation process but we did not obtain elementary graphene sheets. The result is similar to most structures of other reports prepared via Hummers' method.25Fig. 3d shows the SEM image of a PANI film deposited on FTO. The fibrous structure was observed, which is a typical feature of the PANI polymerized in acid environment.30 For composite film PANI-RGO, the SEM images (Fig. 3e) displays that all the GO sheets are homogeneously incorporated in PANI, and there are still some fibrous structures on the surface. These RGO fibers exhibited their edges when they were embedded in PANI. A highly magnified image (Fig. 3f) also corroborates this assumption. Because the GO sheets are rich in oxygenated groups (O or –O–) which form from a partially broken sp2-carbon network with phenol hydroxyls, epoxide groups are on the basal plane and carboxylic acid groups are on the edges.26 These functional groups are assumed to be uniformly distributed on the GO surface and play a crucial role in the chemical bond formation. In this experiment, we found that GO sheets were easily dispersed in water and formed a uniform dispersion. When a GO aqueous solution is mixed with aniline, the ions of PANI are bonded with the GO layer through the chemical bonds of oxygenate groups while the GO is partly reduced to RGO.27 Therefore we named the composite PANI-RGO. Fig. 3  (a, b) AFM images in topographic mode of the exfoliated GO; (c) cross-section profile of the line presented in (b); (d) SEM images of pristine PANI; and (f, g) PANI-RGO composite film on FTO. The bond formation between the GO and aniline ions was investigated by Raman spectroscopy and XRD measurements. Fig. 4a displays Raman spectrum of both samples (GO and the PANI-RGO composite). The spectrum of GO displays two prominent peaks around 1356 and 1610 cm−1, corresponding to the well-documented D (sp2 carbon network) and G (defects in the sp2 lattice) modeled bands. For the Raman spectrum of sample PANI-RGO, despite the D and G bands, yet new peaks appear at 1493, 1180 1163, and 810 cm−1. These peaks can be ascribed to CC stretching, C–H bending vibration of the quinoid ring and substituted benzene ring deformation which was obtained after reduction of GO.28 It should be noted that the spectrum of the PANI-RGO shows a strong G-band around 1610 cm−1 but a weak D-band around 1356 cm−1 (Fig. 4c), and the ratio of D-to-G intensity (0.84) is less than for pure GO (0.94). See the fitted profiles in Fig. 4b and 4c obtained based on Gaussian distribution modes. This means a significant reduction in the degree of ordered structure, and more defect sites or new bond (CC, C–H, quinoid ring and deformation) were produced after the incorporation of GO with aniline.29Fig. 4d illustrates the XRD patterns of the pure GO and PANI-RGO film. GO exhibits a broad diffraction peak at 2θ = 10.4°, and this peak is assigned to the (001) diffraction of the gallery space. This also suggests that our prepared GO is a multilayer structured material. Upon polymerization the diffraction peaks of the composite PANI-RGO were found at around 2θ = 20.4°, which can be indexed to the diffraction peaks of PANI.30 However, the original GO peak was difficult to distinguish. The reason could lie in the small amount (5% wt.) of GO doped in PANI and, due to the low crystallinity, PANI substrates also exhibit a noisy background in the XRD profile. The composite PANI-RGO was also characterized by N2 adsorption–desorption and the specific surface area (91.3 m²/g) was derived via the BET method. The isotherm and BJH pore size distribution are displayed in Fig. 4e and inset. Both micropores and mesopores were found in the representation of pore size distribution. To calculate the specific surface area of commercial Pt particles, we purified the Pt paste and observed it under TEM (Fig. 3f). The platinum particles were found to have a quasi-spherical shape. The average diameter is around 8.0 nm. Therefore we might calculate the surface area (1.06 m²/g) of Pt particles based on the amount of Pt when they were incorporated in the photocathode. It is obvious that the specific surface area is two orders larger than for Pt modified photocathodes.

For a comparable research we also studied the properties of DSSCs constructed with irregular shaped Fe2O3 powders that were synthesized by hydrothermal route and the commercial Pt particles modified cathodes. Four types of DSSCs have been fabricated in this research. The anodes and cathodes are listed in Table 1. Fig. 5 and Table 1 summarize the results, and the photovoltaic parameters including short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and the power conversion efficiency (η) derived are presented. Firstly we compared the performance of photoanodes that were fabricated by flower-shaped α-Fe2O3 and irregular shaped Fe2O3 powders. Fig. 5a shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the two DSSCs by using the above two anode materials. The Voc of the two DSSCs seems not to change much, but the Jsc and η are greatly enhanced in the case of flower α-Fe2O3. These results suggest that the α-Fe2O3 flower-like nanostructures have a higher efficiency in capturing photo-generated electrons. As observed in the SEM images (Fig. 1), the Fe2O3 particles were found to grow into flower petals and the petals are connected with each other. The flower petals–root hierarchical network would provide a facile pathway for conductivity. Furthermore, the higher specific surface area of flower α-Fe2O3 enhances the adsorption of the dye (Fig. 2c), thereby improving the yield of the light generated electrons while a better electron transfer would suppress the recombination rate.31Fig. 5b displays the IPCE profiles for both flower-shaped α-Fe2O3 and irregular shaped Fe2O3 particles modified photoanodes. The UV-Vis absorption spectrum of α-Fe2O3 coated electrode is also given as a blue curve. Both IPCE curves exhibit photo-response from visible red to UV wavelength (700–340 nm). Two peaks (530 and 608 nm) were found in the IPCE profiles. The peak at 608 nm is ascribed to the absorption of Fe2O3 layer, and it is in good consistency with the band gap of bulk α-Fe2O3 (2.1 eV). From the absorption spectrum, we can see there is a weak broad peak in the near infrared region (800–1000 nm) which can be the scattering of the Fe2O3 particles.32 The main absorption onset was found to start at ∼700 nm, and the absorbance subsequently climbs up to 1.2 units at the wavelength of 340 nm. This region (700–340 nm) of absorption is mainly attributed to the electron transition demanded by the hematite nanocrystals.33 The good consistency between IPCE profiles and absorption spectrum suggests a desirable choice of Fe2O3 as an anode material, which could make use of a wider light-harvesting spectral region. By comparison of the two IPCE profiles, we found a higher IPCE value at a wavelength of 608 nm in the flower α-Fe2O3 photoanode. This increment is due to the higher photon-to-electron efficiency in case of flower-shaped Fe2O3 because we deposited the Fe2O3 film at the same density (10.4 mg cm−2).

As shown in Table 1, the Jsc and Voc of the DSSCs using Pt–CE as CEs material are 1.52 mA cm−2 and 0.58 V. The counterparts are 1.40 mA cm−2 and 0.57 V for the DSSCs by using PANI-RGO as cathode material when the anodes are the same (irregular Fe2O3 powder). The Jsc in both DSSCs was found to be lower than for the published TiO2 based DSSCs. The reason could be the low carrier mobility of Fe2O3 at the photoanode.34 However we found that the photocurrent is enhanced by a factor of 1.1–1.4 by comparison of PANI-RGO film with the commercial Pt particles. The maximum energy conversion efficiency reaches 1.24%. We attributed such enhancements to a synergistic effect of PANI and GO. We studied the DSSCs by using PANI or GO as a single component in the cathodes. The photocurrent is always less than ten percent of the present data in composite film. To investigate the electrochemical catalytic activity of the materials in CE, we utilized cyclic voltammetry (CV) to scan the DSSCs. The potential window from −0.7 to 1.3 V (vs. Ag+/AgCl) is shown in Fig. 5c. Two pairs of redox peaks were observed for the two DSSCs. The relative negative pair is assigned to the redox reaction of I3−/I−, eqn (1), and the positive pair is due to redox reaction of I2/I3−, eqn (2). I3− + 2e− ↔ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ↔ 2I3−(2)By comparison, we found that the PANI-RGO CE has a higher redox current density and a left-shift in the potential onsets (I3−/I−) with respect to Pt modified CE. As shown in Fig. 5c, the redox peaks of PANI-RGO (Epc = −0.26 V, Epa = −0.52 V) shift to the negative side compared to the couple peaks of Pt (Epc = 0.088 V, Epa = −0.381 V vs. Ag+/AgCl). This left-shift in anode peak potential indicates a rapid reduction of I3− to I− at the surface of PANI-RGO CE.19c Another possible reason could be ascribed to the adsorption of electrolyte, like 4-tert-butylpyridine onto the PANI surface as well as the carbon materials.35 Similar to the findings of Lin and co-workers,36 we also found the window of the redox peaks (Epp = Epc − Epa, denoted in Fig. 5c) of both electrodes is overall the same in width, however, based on the magnitude of Jsc, an enhancement in the redox current density was found in the case of PANI-RGO CE which demonstrates that PANI-RGO has a better activity for the reduction of I3− compared to either PANI or Pt CEs.37 The enhanced electrocatalytic activity can be attributed to its highly specific surface and rapid electron transfer nature from the RGO, and intrinsically excellent electrocatalytic activity from PANI.36 The EIS spectra of the DSSCs with the CEs fabricated by the films of PANI-RGO and Pt are shown in Fig. 5d. A frequency range of 100 kHz–0.1 Hz was used to estimate the interfacial charge-transfer resistance (Rct) from the counter electrode to I3−. The equivalent circuit diagram of the DSSC device is shown as an inset in Fig. 5c.38 The left semicircle at the high-frequency region (100–10 KHz) corresponds to the Rct as well as the chemical capacitance (CPE) at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. The evaluated Rct (28 Ω) of PANI-RGO counter electrode is lower than that of the Pt counter electrode (Rct = 30 Ω), which suggests a more facile electron transfer in the case of PANI-RGO. A possible explanation for the lower Rct of the PANI-RGO electrode is related to high electronic conductivity and better ohmic contact with the FTO glass.39 RGO provides a larger surface area of the CE than that of with Pt for the reduction of I3− ions. This observation is in accordance with the N2 adsorption-desorption and TEM analysis (Fig. 4e and 4f).4. ConclusionsIn summary, a new type of DSSCs based on porous flower-shaped α-Fe2O3 films as photoelectrodes and reduced graphene oxide incorporated with polyaniline as photocathodes were successfully prepared. It was found that the flower-shaped structure of α-Fe2O3 enhances the charge transfer rate to prevent the charge recombination and an increased light collection efficiency was obtained. Solar absorption was expanded to 700 nm by the introduction of flower-shaped α-Fe2O3 into the photoanode. The maximum energy conversion efficiency of 1.24% was achieved by using a polymer composite film PANI-RGO as photocathode material. This efficiency is nearly six times that of DSSCs fabricated with irregular Fe2O3 powders and printed Pt photocathode. A better electro-catalytic ability of PANI-RGO CE was obtained by a synergistic effect that resulted in a particular network structure, high specific surface area and intrinsic reactivity of the photocathode materials. These results open the possibility of replacing conventional semiconducting material TiO2 in photoanode and expensive Pt in cathode by innocuous and low cost materials of similar efficiency. This construction and its applications to DSSCs can be a good reference for future research work.AcknowledgementsThis work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (21103039, 11075068), Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province (11040606Q45) and the Program of Doctor Start-up Fund Research in Hefei University of Technology (2010HGBZ0604, 2012HGZY0011).References
