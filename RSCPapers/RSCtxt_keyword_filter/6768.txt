    , Accepted 26th June 2012First published on 27th June 2012AbstractWe report a facile solution based synthesis protocol to incorporate nitrogen within zinc oxide nanorods with substantially improved visible light harvesting via broadband absorption stretching from UV to deep visible wavelengths (650 nm). We also report a peculiar visible region maximum around 470 nm. Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirm incorporation of nitrogen along with other complex defects such as zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancies. Our N:ZnO appears pale orange as opposed to the pale yellow reported in other works. It exhibits significantly superior photo-electrochemical performance over undoped ZnO. Notably under monochromatic green light illumination (530 nm) N:ZnO shows a photocurrent density of 3.2 μA cm−2, whereas pristine ZnO fails to show any photo-response. The IPCE spectrum of N:ZnO follows the broadband absorption spectrum extending up to an unprecedented value of 650 nm, potentially expanding the scope for using our material in other solar energy harvesting applications.
1. Introduction
With several intriguing properties such as a wide direct band gap (3.3 eV), large exciton binding energy (60 meV), high mobility (2000 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 80 K) and coexistence of semiconductivity and piezoelectricity,1 zinc oxide (ZnO) has become a workhorse material for various optoelectronic applications such as UV photodetectors,2 solar cells,3 sensors,4 field emission5 and spintronics.6 Zinc oxide has a wurtzite structure which exhibits two peculiar characteristics viz. non-centro-symmetry and polar surfaces. This offers a great flexibility in the growth of ZnO with various attractive morphologies such as flowers, spheres, nanosheets, and nanorods.7 Among these, one dimensional (1D) nanostructures are advantageous because of the higher diffusion length of the charge carriers and the fairly high surface to volume ratio which are essential features for many optoelectronic applications.
Therefore significant efforts have been expended by researchers to synthesize zinc oxide nanorods by various routes such as pulsed laser deposition,8 vapour phase synthesis9 and solution based synthesis.10
Solution based synthesis of zinc oxide nanorods offers an edge over other methods because of cost effectiveness and easy scalability. Solution synthesized ZnO nanorods have been used in a variety of solar energy based applications such as dye sensitized solar cells,11 photocatalysis12 and photo-electrochemical water splitting13,14 wherein both the unique optical and electrical attributes of ZnO are utilized advantageously. However the wide (3.34 eV) band gap of ZnO has restricted the widespread applicability of ZnO in these fields because solar light is mostly composed of the visible spectrum. One way to improve the visible absorption of transparent metal oxides such as TiO2 or ZnO is substitutional doping of a metal or non-metal in the metal oxide lattice, which can introduce inter-band states. TiO2 doped with transition metal ions (Cr3+, Fe3+, V5+) has showed improved absorption in the visible region15 but at the expense of enhanced electron–hole recombination. On the other hand non-metal (N, S, C) ion doping has been found to be advantageous in this context.16 There have been many reports on nitrogen doped zinc oxide thin films formed by magnetron sputtering or pulsed laser deposition where the focus has been on ‘P type conductivity’ rather than their opto-electronic properties.17 There are only a few interesting studies13,14,18,19 on nano-structured nitrogen doped zinc oxide exploring the optical aspect of N:ZnO for visible light photocatalysis or photo-electrochemical (PEC) water splitting. Recent reports on nitrogen doped zinc oxide nanorods have involved post synthesis high temperature (530 °C (ref. 13) or 900 °C (ref. 14)) annealing in an ammonia environment which shows considerable improvement in PEC water splitting, whereas the corresponding IPCE spectrum shows a visible light photo-response tail extending only up to 450 nm.
Here we report low temperature (400 °C) facile solution based synthesis of nitrogen doped zinc oxide (N:ZnO) with a high aspect ratio nanorod morphology which can be easily scaled up to get high yields. Importantly, the diffused reflectance spectrum (DRS) for our N:ZnO nanorods not only exhibits enhanced broadband absorption in the visible region extending from the UV to 650 nm, but also a peculiar visible region maximum around 470 nm. The synthesized N:ZnO material has been characterized thoroughly with Raman and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm nitrogen incorporation within the ZnO lattice. Notably the results from Raman and XPS are in agreement with recent theoretical predictions20 about the nature of nitrogen related defects within the ZnO lattice so as to bring absorption of ZnO down to 2.1 eV. PEC characterization reveals a superior performance of N:ZnO nanorods under AM1.5 1-Sun solar irradiation. Specifically, in comparison with previous reports13,14 on nitrogen doped ZnO nanowires which were unable to show photon to electron conversion over 450 nm, the IPCE of our N:ZnO sample shows a significant photo-response in the visible region extending up to 650 nm. A significant photo-response spanning over half the visible spectrum makes the N:ZnO nanowires synthesized in this report a promising candidate material for other applications such as multispectral (broadband) photodetectors21 and solar cells.
2. Experimental
Synthesis
The nitrogen doped zinc oxide nanorods (N:ZnO) were synthesized by solution based synthesis. Transparent aqueous solutions of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (Merck, 0.12 M, 10 mL), Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) (Sigma Aldrich, 0.12 M, 10 mL) and Polyethylenemine (PEI) (Sigma Aldrich, Mw1800, 0.025 M, 10 mL) were first prepared separately and then mixed to form a homogeneous solution followed by addition of the ammonia (30%, 2.4 mL) solution which acts as a source of nitrogen. This solution was then added to 0.07 g of metallic zinc powder (Merck) and ultra-sonicated for 60 s. The solution was transferred to a 40 mL glass vial and heated at 95 °C under closed conditions for 6 hours. The final product was washed several times with deionised water and un-reacted metallic zinc was removed by centrifugation. The centrifuged product was finally dried under an IR lamp. The dried product was annealed at 400 °C for one hour to get pale orange coloured nitrogen doped zinc oxide (N:ZnO) nanorod powder. The presence of metallic zinc is found to enhance incorporation of nitrogen within the ZnO lattice (ESI, S1†). The reference undoped zinc oxide (ZnO) nanorod powder was synthesized using a similar protocol but without ammonia. The working electrodes for photo-electrochemical measurements were prepared on fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates using the doctor blade technique.
X-Ray diffraction (XRD) data were recorded on a Philips X'Pert PRO using Cu Kα radiation. High-resolution transmission electron micrographs of samples were recorded with HR-TEM, FEI Tecnai 300. X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed using a VG scientific ESCA-3000 spectrometer. UV–Visible diffused reflectance spectra were recorded using a Jasco V-570 spectrophotometer. Raman spectra for ZnO samples were obtained using a Horiba Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR System.
An Autolab PGSTAT30 (Eco-Chemie) was used for photo-electrochemical measurements, which were performed in a three neck quartz photo-reactor with a planer window. The photo-electrochemical cell was prepared using N:ZnO coated FTO as the working electrode, platinum as the counter electrode, and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. X-ray diffraction

Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction data for the ZnO and N:ZnO samples. For both the samples the X-ray diffraction peaks can be assigned to the zinc oxide hexagonal wurzite phase. In comparison with undoped ZnO, the X-ray diffraction peaks for N:ZnO are found to shift towards higher theta values, implying a decreased lattice parameter due to nitrogen doping. This is in accordance with previous reports22,23 on nitrogen doped zinc oxide thin films formed by magnetron sputtering wherein the decreased lattice parameter is assigned to the Zn–N bond length being shorter than that for Zn–O and compressive stress caused by nitrogen substituting oxygen wherein two nitrogen atoms substitute for three oxygen atoms for charge balance. Consistent with the small difference between the ionic radii of nitrogen (N3−, 132 pm) and oxygen (O2−, 126 pm) the observed change in the lattice parameter (0.01 Å) represented by the observed shift of the XRD peaks for ZnO is quite small. The N:ZnO X-ray diffraction peaks also show a larger FWHM than those for ZnO, implying a smaller crystallite size as compared to undoped ZnO.

3.2. Diffused reflectance spectra (DRS)
The visual appearance of the ZnO and N:ZnO samples was white and pale orange, respectively. The optical absorption of ZnO and N:ZnO was studied using diffused reflectance spectroscopy (Fig. 2). ZnO nanorods showed 80% reflectance in the visible region which fell to 9% at 370 nm corresponding to an inter-band transition of 3.3 eV. Thus the undoped ZnO sample showed strong absorption only in the UV region, explaining its white appearance. In contrast to undoped ZnO, the N:ZnO sample clearly showed an absorption tail from 650 nm to 400 nm remarkably spanning half the visible spectrum.

The spectral response of N:ZnO for different colours in the visible spectrum is indicated using coloured arrows. (b) Tauc's plots for ZnO and N:ZnO. 
This broadband absorption within the visible region is attributed to interband N2p states introduced by nitrogen doping. The energy gap of optically active semiconducting materials can be calculated by extrapolation of the tangent to Tauc's plots24,25 based on the equation:  Where F(R) is modified Kubelka–Munk function,  R is reflectance measured from the DRS of samples and n = 1/2 for direct band gap material while n = 2 for indirect band gap material. From Tauc's plot of N:ZnO, it can be seen that the valance band edge of the N:ZnO sample is shifted to 2.1 eV, giving an effective reduction of about 1.2 eV as compared to the energy gap of ZnO. This is in very good agreement with reported theoretical values20 for the band gap in nitrogen doped ZnO wherein the reduced band gap of N:ZnO is related to the combined role of defect complexes such as oxygen vacancies (VO), nitrogen substitution for oxygen (NO) and zinc interstitials (Zni) which is further confirmed on the basis of Raman and XPS.
We also found that the presence of metallic zinc in the reaction leading to the formation of N:ZnO helps enhance the incorporation of nitrogen within the ZnO lattice. Metallic zinc dissolves in the presence of ammonia and zinc nitrate forming complexes such as Zn(NH3)n2+ where ‘n’ can take values of 1, 2, 3, 4. These complexes get incorporated during synthesis, which on post-annealing give substitutional nitrogen within the ZnO. This was confirmed by DRS of N:ZnO with and without metallic zinc (S1, ESI†) where DRS of N:ZnO synthesized with metallic zinc showed improved visible light absorption owing to enhanced nitrogen incorporation. The presence of metallic zinc may also contribute to the local Zn-rich environment during the synthesis of ZnO, which is responsible for the observed n-type conductivity in nitrogen doped ZnO.36
3.3. Raman spectroscopy
With a sampling depth of nearly one micron, Raman spectroscopy offers useful insight into the nature of defects and lattice disorder. Hexagonal wurtzite ZnO belongs to the C46v space group with eight sets of optical phonon modes viz. A1 + E1 + 2E2 modes (Raman active), 2B1 modes (Raman silent), and A1 + E1 modes (infrared active) where A1 and E1 modes split into Longitudinal Optical (LO) and Transverse Optical (TO) components.26Fig. 3 shows the Raman spectra for the ZnO and N:ZnO samples. The undoped ZnO sample shows an E2high mode at 439 cm−1 with a peak at 335 cm−1 which is assigned to multiple phonon scattering.28 It does not show a Raman mode at 584 cm−1, assigned to the combination of E1 LO and A1 LO modes, which is found to be enhanced with disorder within the lattice.27 Absence of a 584 cm−1 band implies higher crystallinity in the case of the undoped ZnO sample. Appearance of a mode at 584 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of N:ZnO clearly corresponds to the formation of lattice disorder after incorporation of nitrogen in the ZnO lattice. The Raman spectrum of N:ZnO also shows the appearance of two new peaks at 278.3 cm−1 and 511 cm−1, which are characteristic of N doped ZnO. Based on experimental results supported by ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations Friedrich et al.28 have shown that the vibrational mode at 278 cm−1 is assigned to a complex formed between interstitial zinc (Zni) and nitrogen substituting oxygen (No). The mode at 511 cm−1 on the other hand is assigned to a zinc interstitial (Zni) and oxygen interstitial (Oi) complex formed due to nitrogen doping. Thus the Raman modes at 279 cm−1 and 511 cm−1 in nitrogen doped ZnO support the presence of both interstitial Zinc (Zni) and nitrogen substituting lattice oxygen (No) which are essential for reducing the band gap of ZnO to 2 eV.20

3.4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
Nitrogen doping in ZnO nanorods was further confirmed with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 4 shows an XPS comparison of ZnO and N:ZnO samples. No appreciable changes in the peak positions for zinc or oxygen are observed in undoped ZnO and N:ZnO. A shoulder peak around 532.4 eV (called the medium binding energy component29 in oxygen 1S XPS) observed for both the samples can be assigned to O2− species in the oxygen deficient region of the Zn–O matrix, which is indicative of the presence of oxygen vacancies in both samples.
 Fig. 4  X-ray photoelectron spectra for the ZnO and N:ZnO samples. 
The N 1S XPS spectrum for N:ZnO shows two features in the region from 395 eV to 405 eV which are not observed in the case of undoped ZnO. The peak around 398.2 eV can be assigned to substitutional doping of nitrogen30 at the site of oxygen in ZnO. A small feature at 395.2 eV is assigned to substitutionally doped nitrogen in the local N-rich environment.31 A broad feature around 404.7 eV in the N:ZnO XPS is indicative of incorporation of N2 molecular species on the oxygen sublattice which is also known to contribute to interband states near the valance band of ZnO.32 Thus this reaction protocol allows nitrogen incorporation within the ZnO lattice in two different ways viz. nitrogen substituting oxygen in the ZnO lattice while N2 molecules are incorporated on the oxygen sublattice.33 On basis of the XPS analysis the percentage incorporation of nitrogen within ZnO was calculated to be 4%.
3.5. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

Fig. 5 shows transmission electron micrographs (TEMs) of the ZnO and N:ZnO samples. It can be seen that the N:ZnO sample consists of nanorods with lengths ranging between 3 and 5 microns and cross-sections between 40 and 100 nm, which gives a high aspect ratio (50–70). Undoped ZnO nanorods exhibit a lower aspect ratio (10–15) because of their larger cross-section as compared to nitrogen doped ZnO. This can be attributed to the combined effect of ammonia and PEI in the synthesis of N:ZnO. It is well known that HMT allows ZnO nanorods to grow along the [001] direction while preferential capping of PEI blocks the growth of planes other than (001). In the case of nitrogen doped ZnO, the presence of ammonia subdues the homogeneous nucleation within the reaction bath.34 Thus the number of ZnO nuclei formed is limited which makes enough PEI available for capping and preferential growth. In the absence of ammonia a large number of ZnO nuclei are formed within the reaction bath making insufficient PEI available for capping, which causes ZnO nanorods to grow in their width. Fig. 5(e) and (f) show HRTEM micrographs of the ZnO and N:ZnO samples wherein the growth of ZnO nanorods is seen to take place along the [001] direction. The lattice spacing for the (100) planes of N:ZnO (2.85 A0) is found to be smaller than that for the ZnO (100) planes (2.863 A0), which is consistent with the small shifts observed in X-ray diffraction. In Fig. 5(g) we have overlapped the inverse fast Fourier transformation (IFFT) images of lattice fringes of ZnO and N:ZnO so that lattice planes of both are initially nearly commensurate (shown in lower red circle) and, as seen from the upper red circle region, after about 20–22 fringes the lattice fringes of N:ZnO lag behind those of ZnO implying a lower lattice parameter for N:ZnO.

Lattice constants calculated from inverse fast Fourier transformation profiles (IFFT) based on the HRTEMs of ZnO [Fig. 5(e)] and N:ZnO [Fig. 5(f)] for 10 lattice fringes. Fig. 5(g) includes the IFFT images of lattice fringes initially commensurate in the lower circle which later become incommensurate in the upper circle, reflecting the lattice mismatch. 
3.6. Mott Schottky analysis
We carried out a Mott–Schottky analysis in order to determine the nature of the conductivity and the flat band potential for N:ZnO. Mott–schottky plots were taken in the dark with a three electrode assembly and a perturbation amplitude of 10 mV in 0.5 M Na2SO4 aqueous electrolyte. Fig. 6 shows the Mott–Schottky plots for the ZnO and N:ZnO samples. The positive slopes for the ZnO and N:ZnO Mott–Schottky plots imply n-type conductivity in both. N:ZnO has long been predicted to give p-type conductivity in ZnO,35 but the subject has been controversial and most claims of p-type conductivity have been questioned subsequently.
 Fig. 6  Mott–Schottky plots for ZnO and N:ZnO samples. The inset shows the onset of photocurrent against voltage for both samples. 
It has also been shown that the type of conductivity in nitrogen doped ZnO nanoparticles depends on the annealing temperature of the sample.36 In our case the samples are annealed to 400 °C in air, explaining the observed n-type conductivity.
Extrapolating the linear region of the Mott–Schottky plots gives the flat band potential of the samples to be −0.33 V against an Ag/AgCl reference electrode, which nearly matches with onset potential for the photocurrent as shown in the inset of Fig. 6.
3.7. Photo-electrochemical measurements
The photo-electrochemical (PEC) properties of the synthesized ZnO and N:ZnO nanorods were explored using a three electrode assembly with ZnO or N:ZnO coated FTO as the working electrode, platinum foil as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. All the PEC measurements were performed with aqueous 0.5 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte. The basic photo-electrochemical mechanism in ZnO is given in ESI S4†.

Fig. 7(a) shows linear sweep voltagrams for the ZnO and N:ZnO samples (−0.5 V to 1 V vs. Ag/AgCl) in the dark and under simulated solar light (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2) with a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. In the dark both ZnO and N:ZnO show negligible current (10−7 A cm−2). When irradiated with simulated solar light undoped ZnO exhibits a photocurrent density around 0.032 mA cm−2 at 0.35 V against Ag/AgCl, whereas the N:ZnO shows a higher photocurrent density of 0.16 mA cm−2 at the same potential. The power conversion efficiency of these PEC cells was calculated using following equation:37  Where Jp is photocurrent density (in mA cm−2), Eapp = Emeasured − EVoc (in V), Ilight is incident power (in mW cm−2). Fig. 7(b) shows the power conversion efficiency for N:ZnO and ZnO vs. Ag/AgCl reference electrode. Undoped ZnO shows a maximum efficiency of 0.02% at 0.2 V, whereas N:ZnO shows a higher efficiency of 0.1% at 0.35 V, against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The enhancement in the photocurrent density and power conversion efficiency of N:ZnO can be attributed to the enhanced visible light absorption and higher surface to volume ratio of N:ZnO with respect to undoped ZnO.
 Fig. 7  (a) Linear sweep voltagrams for ZnO and N:ZnO samples in the dark and with AM1.5 radiation. (b) Efficiency of ZnO and N:ZnO nanorods against applied potential. 
In order to further confirm the visible light photoresponse of N:ZnO due to enhanced absorption in visible region we carried out linear sweep voltametry for both ZnO and N:ZnO using monochromatic light emitting diode (LED) sources.

Fig. 8(a) shows the linear sweep voltagram for the ZnO and N:ZnO samples with a blue emitting LED (Luxeon Star LXHL MB1C) with a central wavelength of 470 nm and a spectral half width of 25 nm. It can be clearly seen that N:ZnO gives a photocurrent density of 13 μA cm−2 at 1 V against Ag/AgCl, which is 13 times higher than the photocurrent density of undoped ZnO at the same potential. The small photoresponse of undoped ZnO at 470 nm could be because of a trace amount of nitrogen which can get incorporated within the lattice due to nitrogen containing additives like HMT or PEI in the reaction bath with the undoped ZnO.
 Fig. 8  (a) Linear sweep voltagrams for ZnO and N:ZnO nanorods with a blue light emitting diode. (b) Linear sweep voltagrams for ZnO and N:ZnO nanorods with a green light emitting diode. 
The diffused reflectance spectrum (DRS) shows the absorption of N:ZnO extending to 650 nm. Thus it should be able to transform incident photons of wavelengths up to 650 nm into external photo-current. This is further verified by linear sweep voltagrams for the ZnO and N:ZnO samples [Fig. 8(b)] under illumination by a green LED (Luxeon Star LXHLMM1C) with a central wavelength of 530 nm and a spectral half width of 35 nm. Under green light illumination undoped ZnO fails to show any photoresponse while N:ZnO shows a photocurrent density of 3.2 μA cm−2 at 1 V against the Ag/AgCl reference electrode.
We further investigated the overall incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) for N:ZnO and ZnO at various wavelengths in the visible region (400 nm–800 nm). The IPCE for both samples was investigated using a Quantum Efficiency Setup (Newport Corporation) under zero applied bias with 0.5 M aqueous Na2SO4 electrolyte between a ‘two electrode sandwich assembly’ of ZnO or N:ZnO coated FTO as the working electrode and Pt-nanoparticle coated FTO as the counter electrode. Fig. 9 shows IPCE spectra for N:ZnO and ZnO in the visible region (400 nm to 800 nm) which clearly shows the multi-spectral photo-response of N:ZnO. Significantly N:ZnO is capable of utilizing photons even beyond the central yellow part of the visible spectrum. Thus nitrogen doping by our process enables the photon to current conversion ability of ZnO to be pushed deep into the visible region. The IPCE spectrum for N:ZnO also shows a local maximum around 470 nm which can be assigned to the transition from nitrogen-related levels to the conduction band of ZnO, which is consistent with the deep acceptor model of N:ZnO.38
 Fig. 9  Incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) comparison for ZnO and N:ZnO nanorods. 
Generally the IPCE spectrum should be consistent with the absorption spectrum so that the possibility of artefacts in the IPCE due to second order transmission of the monochromator is eliminated.39 In order to verify this we plotted [ESI S3†] the IPCE (normalized to the IPCE value at 350 nm) and the absorption (normalized to the absorption value at 350 nm) as a function of wavelength. It can be seen that the absorption onset matches with the onset of photocurrent around 650 nm. The clear photo-response under LED sources also eliminates the possibility of artefacts in the IPCE due to second order transmission in the monochromator of the IPCE setup.
3.8. Differentiating nitrogen doping and nitrogen adsorption
It is worth mentioning that the Raman mode at 278.3 cm−1 plays a decisive role in differentiating between incorporation of nitrogen within the ZnO lattice and nitrogen surface adsorption. Gole and Burda40et al. reported an interesting case where “room temperature” treatment of TiO2 with triethylamine (TEA) led surface adsorbed nitrogen compounds to exhibit visible light absorption and photo-catalytic activity. In such a case it is difficult to incorporate nitrogen deep within the crystallite, leading to low stability at higher temperatures. Thus to rule out the possibility of visible light photo-electrochemical activity in our case being due to surface adsorbed nitrogen compounds on the ZnO in our protocol, we repeated the experimental procedure reported by Gole and Burda40et al. on an undoped ZnO sample which involves only adsorption of TEA on the ZnO surface.

Fig. 10(a) shows the DRS for undoped ZnO compared with TEA adsorbed ZnO. Interestingly, consistent with the results of Gole and Burda, TEA adsorbed ZnO does give an absorption tail in the visible region, but it disappears on annealing at 400 °C implying loss of adsorbents with heating. Fig. 10(b) shows the Raman spectra for the TEA surface treatment case in comparison with that for N:ZnO. We observe that TEA adsorbed as well as post annealed samples fail to show a Raman mode at 278.3 cm−1 which is characteristic to nitrogen doping.
 Fig. 10  (a) DRS, (b) Raman spectra for TEA adsorbed ZnO before and after annealing as compared with our N:ZnO sample. (c) and (d): PEC performance of TEA adsorbed ZnO before and after annealing in comparison with the N:ZnO case. 
Further, we also carried out PEC measurements for TEA adsorbed ZnO samples [Fig. 10(c) and (d)] which failed to show a photo-response under blue (470 nm) and green (530 nm) illumination, the deep visible region.
Similar surface treatment of ZnO with ammonia solution was also carried out for examination, as it was the source of nitrogen in our protocol. This also failed to show the Raman mode at 278.3 cm−1 and a visible light photo-response [ESI S2(a)–(d)†]. These experiments establish the fact that ambient temperature solution based surface treatment of ZnO with nitrogen containing chemicals such as amines may give visible light absorption but fails to show a photo-electrochemical response in the deep visible region.
3.9. High temperature stability of N:ZnO

Fig. 11(a) shows the DRS for N:ZnO samples annealed at 400 °C and 600 °C. It can be clearly seen that N:ZnO shows considerable absorbance even after annealing at 600 °C. The Raman mode at 278.3 cm−1 in Fig. 11(b) further confirms the presence of nitrogen dopant in the N:ZnO 600 °C annealed sample which results in stable visible light photo-electrochemical performance as shown in Fig. 11(c) and (d). Thus N:ZnO synthesized by our protocol exhibits excellent high temperature stability.
 Fig. 11  (a) DRS, (b) Raman, (c) and (d) PEC performance of N:ZnO after annealing at 400 °C and 600 °C. 
Thus the enhanced absorption of the N:ZnO sample in the visible region is a clear confirmation of the N2p inter-band states introduced by successful incorporation of nitrogen within the ZnO lattice by our process. The photo-response of N:ZnO on excitation with energy smaller than the band gap energy proves the ability of these N2p levels within band gap of ZnO to generate a usable photocurrent. It is worth mentioning that recent reports13,14 on nitrogen doped ZnO have shown enhancements in the IPCE extending only up to 450 nm while the N:ZnO synthesized in this report exhibits superior photo-conversion ability which extends up to 650 nm, spanning half the visible spectrum. This exciting result opens up doors to other applications such as multispectral photo-detection21 where N:ZnO can be a cost effective and environmentally friendly alternative. A study of aligned nitrogen doped zinc oxide for photo-detection is currently underway and will be published elsewhere.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we report a simple solution based process to synthesize nitrogen doped zinc oxide nanorods with a high aspect ratio of 50–70. We show that such N:ZnO nanorods exhibit enhanced broadband visible light absorption extending from the UV up to 650 nm, with a peculiar visible region band maximum around 470 nm. By using several characterization methods we establish that substitutional doping of nitrogen is accompanied by other complex defects such as zinc interstitials and oxygen vacancies which result in an effectively reduced band gap of 2.1 eV, in very good agreement with recent theoretical predictions. Mott–Schottky analysis brings out that the N:ZnO material is n-type, with a flat band potential of −3.3 V against Ag/AgCl reference electrode. PEC characterization demonstrates a much superior performance of N:ZnO nanorods over undoped ZnO. The N:ZnO sample shows a photocurrent density of 3.2 μA cm−2 under green (530 nm) LED illumination while undoped ZnO fails to show any photoresponse at this wavelength. The incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of N:ZnO brings out its capability to convert photons with wavelengths up to 650 nm into usable current, which agrees well with absorption spectrum of N:ZnO. Thus visible light responding nitrogen doped zinc oxide nanorods synthesized in this report expand the scope of using ZnO for other applications such as dye sensitized solar cells, visible light photocatalysis, visible light photodetectors and water splitting.
