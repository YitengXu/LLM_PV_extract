    , Accepted 1st April 2020First published on 1st April 2020AbstractIn this work, we reported an efficient and universal method to fabricate perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells with enhanced efficiency. Through dissolving an optimal amount of conjugated polymers in a PQD matrix solution to fabricate a polymer-QD bulk heterojunction hybrid layer located at PQD/hole transporting layer (HTL) interfaces, the resultant solar cell devices exhibit significantly enhanced short-circuit current density and efficiency. In-depth characterization indicates that adding an optimal amount of conjugated polymers to the PQD film can effectively reduce pin-holes, resulting in more efficient interfacial charge transfer and decreased carrier recombination loss. More importantly, it shows that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of the conjugated polymer is crucial for achieving improved carrier transport at the PQD/HTL interfaces. Through rational selection of conjugated polymers, we achieved the best power conversion efficiency of ∼14% and 13.2% for CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQD based solar cells respectively, placing them at the forefront of all reported PQD solar cells. These findings will provide insights into well controlling organic–inorganic interfaces to improve current PQD based photovoltaic (PV) devices.
1. Introduction
Since Luther et al. demonstrated the first CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells with an efficiency exceeding 10%,1 PQD photovoltaic (PV) devices have received immense interest owing to the numerous advantages of PQD materials such as spectrally tunable bandgap, flexible compositional control, and crystalline strain benefits.2–5 Besides, QDs offer opportunities to explore a variety of concepts that cannot be easily achieved in thin film solar cells, such as quantum confinement, diverse processing conditions, and more varieties of device structures like bulk heterojunctions (BHJs) and multiple planar junctions.6–9 Up to now, colloidal CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQDs have been successfully integrated into solar devices, which brought about unique opportunities for developing high-performance and stable photovoltaics.1,8–18 In 2017, the efficiency of CsPbI3 based PQD solar cells was further improved to 13.4%, achieving a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of QD based solar cells.10
Benefiting from the thin film perovskite device architecture, most PQD solar cells are comprised of an n-type electron transport layer (ETL) (i.e. TiO2 and SnO2),11,14,19,20 a PQD absorbing active layer and a p-type organic hole transport layer (HTL) (i.e. Spiro-OMeTAD and PTAA).1,12,21,22 PCEs up to 14% and 13% can be achieved by well passivating the QD surface in CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 based devices, respectively.12,14 However, the interfaces between PQDs and the organic HTL from sequential solution deposition are not ideal for efficient charge extraction, due to large surface energy difference between QDs and polymers.23 Many studies have demonstrated ultrafast charge transfer between conjugated polymers and conventional QDs such as lead sulfide (PbS).24,25 The interfacial charge transfer process is mainly determined by organic/inorganic energy level alignment and phase separation.23 Although some efforts were made to develop an inorganic HTL for efficient QDs and perovskite solar cells,26–28 organic semiconductors are still promising candidates due to their low-temperature solution processing, which is compatible with large-scale manufacturing printing techniques.29 In addition, the optical and electrical properties of organic semiconductors can be well tuned through manipulating their chemical structures.30–32 Therefore, adjusting QD/HTL interfaces to improve the charge dynamic process might be an effective approach to further enhance the PV performance.
To accomplish this target, we developed a solution-processed conjugated polymer-PQD hybrid BHJ layer. As illustrated in Fig. 1a, the hybrid BHJ layer can act as a “bridge” to connect the pure PQD absorbing layer and organic HTL. Through rational polymer selection, a graded energy level (QD/polymer/PTAA) can be built for efficient hole transfer and electron blocking, which theoretically could enhance charge carrier extraction and reduce recombination loss at PQD/HTL interfaces.33 Through this interfacial modification strategy, we obtained a best PCE of 13.8% for CsPbI3 PQD solar cells, which is among the highest values reported for this type of photovoltaic device.10,12,17 Moreover, we further demonstrated this strategy to another PQD system, FAPbI3. A highest PCE of up to 13.2% was obtained in comparison with 11.6% for the control ones, placing them at the forefront of all reported FAPbI3 PQD cells.13,14 Therefore, we believe the hybrid BHJ interfacial modification presented here would provide a new direction to well control the organic–inorganic interfaces for expectant charge carrier dynamics.

2. Results and discussion
The modified PQD solar cells have a device structure, as shown in Fig. 1a, where TiO2 processed by chemical bath deposition was used as the electron-transporting material,19 and CsPbI3 or FAPbI3 PQDs as the light harvester. Before spin-coating the organic HTL PTAA, a conjugated polymer-QD hybrid layer was deposited on the existing QD layer. Here, we investigated the performance of both CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQD solar cells by employing various conjugated polymers (PBDB-T, PTP8, PTB7-Th and PTB7) to build the hybrid connecting layers, which have been widely used in organic solar cells as donor polymers, and their molecular structures are presented in Fig. 1b.11,32,34 Specifically, all these donor–acceptor (D–A) type co-polymers share the same donor building block: benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT). We further change the acceptor comonomers in order to fine-tune their optical properties and energy levels, aiming to investigate their impact on the resultant device performance. The space charge limited current (SCLC) mobility of these polymers is about 10−3–10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 according to a previous report.11,32,34 The CsPbI3 or FAPbI3 perovskite QDs used in this work were prepared according to our previous work,9,12 and the synthesized QDs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. S1 and S2, ESI†) and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 1c). Meanwhile, we also studied the optical properties of the conjugated polymers. As shown in Fig. 1c, the maximum absorption regions of the polymer solutions are located between 500 and 700 nm, which are complementary to the PQD absorption region.Interfacial energy level alignment is crucial for decreasing carrier recombination loss and improving carrier extraction. As shown in Fig. 1d, we comprehensively compared the energy level positions of both PQDs and conjugated polymers together with the HTL material PTAA. The valence band (VB) or highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level values of the QDs and polymers were characterized by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (shown in Fig. S3 and S4†), and the conduction band (CB) or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level values were further calculated according their optical bandgap. Evidently, the CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQDs exhibit deep VB energy levels of −5.70 eV and −5.46 eV, respectively, whereas PTAA exhibits shallower HOMO energy level of −5.20 eV.9,11 The PQD/conjugated polymer energy levels are well aligned to form a type-II band structure (except for PTP8). Besides, we selected conjugated polymers with varying HOMO energy levels located between the VB of PQD and the HOMO of PTAA, in order to understand the impact of the polymer HOMO energy levels on carrier extraction and recombination at the PQD/HTL interfaces.

Fig. 2a and b present the current density versus voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cell devices based on CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQDs, respectively, under AM1.5G illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2, with the device parameters shown in Table 1. The PQD solar cells based on neat CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 QDs exhibit PCEs of 13.1% and 11.6%, respectively, which are comparable to those of previous reports.12,14 For the polymer-QD BHJ connecting layer, the device optimization includes fine tuning the polymer/QD blend weight ratio (Fig. S5, S6, Tables S1 and S2†). The optimal weight ratio was found to be 1/90 (polymer/PQDs) in both CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 systems. It is interesting to find that by adding the PBDB-T/QD BHJ connecting layer, the PCEs of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 QD based devices were improved to 13.8% and 13.2%, respectively. The improvement was mainly ascribed to the enhanced short-circuit current density (Jsc) value, which may be attributed to the decreased carrier recombination at the interfaces. By adding a different polymer PTP8, which shows a deeper HOMO level of −5.50 eV, Jsc and PCE enhancement only in the CsPbI3 based device was observed. In addition, the two conventional polymers PTB7 and PTB7-Th were also studied for more comparison. As shown in Fig. 2a and b and Table 1, PTB7-Th with the HOMO in a medium position (−5.20 eV) can simultaneously improve the efficiency of both CsPbI3 (13.4%) and FAPbI3 (12.2%) PQD based devices, but is less efficient compared to PBDB-T. By adding PTB7 with a highest HOMO level of −5.13 eV, both CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQD based devices exhibit a significantly decreased Jsc value, and the resultant PCE is decreased to 11.1% and 8.9% respectively. Evidently, the HOMO energy levels of the adopted conjugated polymer are crucial to the photovoltaic performance. Through comparing the VB/HOMO energy levels of neat PQDs, conjugated polymers and PTAA, we found that the ideal conjugated polymer should have an appropriate HOMO level position located between that of PQDs and PTAA.

To understand the working mechanisms of the polymer-QD hybrid connecting layer in PQD based solar cells, we need to investigate the properties of these hybrid blend films comprehensively. As shown in Fig. 2c, we first studied the optical properties of these hybrid films compared to those of neat polymer and PQD films. Notably, we observed a new peak centering in the 600–700 nm region in both PBDB-T/CsPbI3 and PBDB-T/FAPbI3 hybrid blend films, which is consistent with the absorbance maximum of neat conjugated polymer PBDB-T, indicating well mixing of the polymer and PQDs in the blend films. It is worth noting that the PTAA layer was further deposited on top of the polymer-QD hybrid layer from the toluene solution. To evaluate the effect of toluene on the polymer-QD hybrid layer, we further conducted UV-vis absorption measurements of the hybrid blend film before and after toluene treatment. As shown in Fig. S7 and S8,† the UV-vis absorption spectra of both PBDB-T/CsPbI3 and PBDB-T/FAPbI3 blend films exhibit negligible difference after toluene treatment, indicating that the polymer-QD hybrid/PTAA structure presented in Fig. 1a can be retained. The external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the polymer-QD hybrid layer modified PQD solar cells (Fig. 2d) exhibit apparent improvements in the entire photo-response region compared to those of the control neat PQD devices, indicating improved charge collection efficiency.15 However, it is hard to distinguish if the polymer absorbance could contribute to the device current. The Jsc calculated by integrating the EQE curve with an AM1.5G reference spectrum was comparable to the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curves for all devices. In our previous report,12 PQD solar cells show a negligible hysteresis effect, and inserting hybrid layers also exhibits similar reverse and forward scanning J–V characteristics, confirming the reliability of our J–V measurements (Fig. S9 and S10†). All of these results confirm that the addition of the polymer-QD hybrid structure can improve the light-harvesting and charge-collection efficiency in comparison with the neat PQD based devices.
To further understand the improved charge-collection efficiency, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements were introduced to ascertain carrier dynamics by adding conjugated polymers to PQDs. As shown in Fig. 3a, in comparison with samples based on the pristine polymer PBDB-T (Fig. S11†), CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQDs, the PBDB-T/PQD hybrid BHJ film exhibits obvious PL quenching, suggesting charge transfer between the polymer and PQDs in the hybrid blends. In addition, in the TRPL decay profiles (Fig. 3b), both PBDB-T/CsPbI3 (0.85 ns) and PBDB-T/FAPbI3 PQDs (1.92 ns) exhibit much shorter lifetime than neat CsPbI3 (1.05 ns) and FAPbI3 PQDs (3.47 ns), respectively. The significantly quenched PL intensity and faster PL decay profiles indicate the hole transfer from PQDs to PBDB-T which is commonly known as a donor in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices.14 We hypothesize that a suitable conjugated polymer such as PBDB-T played a crucial role in charge carrier dynamics of the PQD film, especially at the PQD/HTL interfaces, enhancing charge separation and reducing the charge recombination rate.

In order to further understand the role of polymers in carrier dynamics, more characterization experiments were performed on PQD solar cell devices. Fig. 4 presents the variation of Jsc and Voc of PQD solar cell devices as a function of illumination intensity. The Jsc is expected to demonstrate power-law dependence on light intensity I (Jsc ∼ Iα).12Fig. 4a and b show the values of exponential factors (α) of 0.99, 0.99, 0.91 and 0.95 for the devices based on neat CsPbI3 PQDs, CsPbI3 PQD + PBDB-T, neat FAPbI3 PQDs and FAPbI3 PQD + PBDB-T, respectively. These results indicate that adopting PBDB-T can suppress bimolecular recombination only in FAPbI3 PQD based solar cell devices.35 Moreover, the light intensity dependence on Voc was also studied (Fig. 4c and d). If the slope is larger than 1kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge), it indicates the interfacial trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination.35 The values of the slope were calculated to be 1.69kT/q, 1.60kT/q, 1.95kT/q and 1.86kT/q for the devices based on neat CsPbI3 PQDs, CsPbI3 PQD + PBDB-T, neat FAPbI3 PQDs and FAPbI3 PQD + PBDB-T, respectively. These results suggest the reduction in trap-assisted carrier recombination, which is the dominant recombination in the PQD solar cells. Upon adding the conjugated polymer, both CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQD solar cells exhibit decreased carrier recombination. We have reported that the removal of native ligands in FAPbI3 using the same treatment is not as efficient as that in CsPbI3 PQD.9 The removal of long insulating ligands can increase QD coupling and may induce closely packed QDs to form large grains, which is essential for efficient charge transport. Therefore, the polymer-QD hybrid BHJ layer strategy works more efficiently in FAPbI3 PQD based devices, which may be attributed to the reduction of initial serious carrier recombination.

Further, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was utilized to investigate the PQD solar cells with/without (w/wo) the conjugated polymer-PQD hybrid connecting layer, aiming to investigate the interfacial charge transfer and carrier recombination within PQD solar cell devices. Fig. 5 depicts the Nyquist plots of neat PQDs and PQD with hybrid connecting layer based devices, together with the equivalent circuit model. Typical inner series resistance (Rs) values include the sheet resistance (Rsheet) of the electrodes, and charge-transfer resistance (Rct) at the interfaces between the PQD active layer and the organic HTL. As shown in detail in Table S3,† it is clear that the Rs in CsPbI3 + PBDB-T and FAPbI3 + PBDB-T based devices is significantly decreased compared to those in neat CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 based ones, confirming the improved PCE after hybrid interfacial modification, which can be attributed to the more efficient interfacial charge transfer and extraction. Moreover, the R1 (charge recombination resistance) in CsPbI3 + PBDB-T and FAPbI3 + PBDB-T based devices is slightly increased compared to those in neat CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 based ones, suggesting decreased interfacial recombination after introducing the polymer/QD hybrid layer.36

To gain more insights into the decreased interfacial charge carrier recombination loss, the morphological properties at the PQD/HTL interfaces need to be studied. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM) were utilized to investigate the surface morphology of the PQD films w/wo conjugated polymers. Due to the discreteness of zero-dimensional PQD materials as well as the post-ligand removal process during PQD film fabrication, we observed many cracks in the neat CsPbI3 (Fig. 6a) and FAPbI3 PQD films (Fig. 6c). Lots of previous reports have demonstrated that the cracks or pin-holes at the film surface can become a recombination center, and lead to decreased solar cell performance.22,37 The FAPbI3 PQD film exhibited fewer cracks, compared to the CsPbI3 PQD film, which may be attributed to the less QD surface ligand removal, but the long native surface ligands would hinder charge transport between neighboring QDs. In contrast, by adding an optimal content of conjugated polymer to the PQD matrix, we observed a more smooth and continuous film surface morphology for both CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQDs (as shown in Fig. 6b and d). The improvement of surface conditions may be due to a certain agglomeration function of the polymer to PQDs for lower surface energy and larger van der Waals forces between the conjugated polymer and PQDs.23 Meanwhile, AFM characterization was introduced to detect surface roughness and blend phase separation. As shown in Fig. 6e–h, due to the different surface energies between the conjugated polymers and PQDs and the aggregation properties of the conjugated polymer, we observed an increased grain size and surface roughness in the polymer-PQD hybrid film relative to the neat PQD ones. The phase separation and interconnection between the conjugated polymer and PQDs are crucial for better charge transfer and transport in the polymer-QD hybrid blend film.22 By optimizing the polymer/QD blend ratio, we could simultaneously fix the surface cracks in neat PQD films and build an optimal polymer-QD network for improved charge carrier dynamics. Therefore, according to all these aforementioned investigations, the intrinsic mechanism for enhancement of PQD solar cell performance lies in the improvement of the PQD/HTL interfaces. By adding an optimal amount of the conjugated polymer with appropriate HOMO energy levels to the PQD film one can effectively reduce pin-holes, resulting in more efficient interfacial charge transfer, decreased carrier recombination loss, and finally an overall enhancement in the PQD solar cell performance.

Despite rapid progress in PCEs,8–14,38–40 the long-term stability of current perovskite solar cells under operating conditions still requires further research and development. Under environmental stress, the organic–inorganic lead halide perovskite (e.g. CH3NH3PbI3) is notorious for decomposition into PbI2 and volatile alkylammonium iodide.41 The most suitable all-inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 suffered from structural instability and is easily transferred to a non-conductive orthorhombic phase under ambient conditions.1 Most conventional conjugated polymers are hydrophobic and relatively stable under ambient conditions;42 we also demonstrated that these conjugated polymers could be processed under ambient conditions to fabricate efficient and stable OPV devices. Finally, we investigated the moisture resistance properties of the PQD film w/wo conjugated polymers through water contact-angle measurements. Fig. 7a–d shows the contact-angle measurements obtained using deionized water droplets on pristine CsPbI3, CsPbI3 + PBDB-T, pristine FAPbI3 and FAPbI3 + PBDB-T. Upon adding conjugated polymer PBDB-T to the PQD film, the contact angle value of the CsPbI3 system increases from 83.2° to 107.5° and from 95.3° to 110.9° for the FAPbI3 system. These results evidently demonstrate a change in the PQD films from being hydrophilic to hydrophobic upon introducing conjugated polymers.21 To evaluate the stability of PQD solar cells, we compared changes in the device performance of the QD and QD + PBDB-T based film under ambient conditions (relative humidity of 20–30% at 25 °C), as shown in Fig. 7e. Both CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 solar cells exhibit slightly improved stability when employing the PQD/PBDB-T BHJ layer, indicating that the strength of the hybrid interfacial layer could be an alternative strategy to further simultaneously improve the efficiency and stability of PQD based optoelectronic devices.

3. Experimental
3.1. Measurements
UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained by using a PerkinElmer model Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. PL spectra were measured using a FluoroMax-4 spectrofluorometer. SEM images were obtained by using a Zeiss Supra 55 and AFM images were obtained from an Asylum Research Cypher S AFM microscope. EIS measurements were carried out by using a Zahner IM6 electrochemical workstation fitted with ZSimDemo3.30d software. The contact angle measurement was conducted by using Dataphysics equipment with water droplets on sample surfaces.
3.2. The preparation of polymer/PQD hybrid blend solutions
Firstly, CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQDs were dispersed in chloroform at a concentration of 45 mg mL−1, and conjugated polymers were dissolved in chloroform at a concentration 10 mg mL−1. Then, the polymer/PQD blend solution was obtained by mixing the neat PQD and polymer solution in different blend ratios (w/w), and the hybrid solution was stirred at room temperature for at least one hour before film deposition.
3.3. The fabrication and characterization of CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQD solar cells
A compact hydrothermal TiO2 layer was deposited on the pre-patterned FTO-coated substrates. The TiO2 film was exposed to UV-ozone for 10 min before PQD film preparation. The CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQDs (45 mg mL−1 in chloroform) were spin-cast on top of the as-prepared TiO2 film at 2000 rpm for 40 s. 200 μL of MeOAc was loaded onto the QD film for 5 s to remove the surface ligands and spun at 2000 rpm for 20 s. This process was repeated three times to build up a ∼300 nm thick film (normally 3–4 cycles). For the polymer/QD hybrid layer modified device, the final PQD layer was replaced with the polymer/QD hybrid layer with different blend weight ratios. For the CsPbI3 PQD based film, the film was further treated with saturated FAI solution in ethyl acetate.10 The PQD film deposition processes were performed in a dry air-filled glove box, with a relative humidity lower than 10%. The PQD film was then transferred into a nitrogen glove box and annealed at 70 °C for 10 min before the fabrication of the HTL. The HTL was deposited into the N2 glovebox by spin-coating the tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane-doped PTAA toluene solution (15 mg mL−1, dopant/PTAA = 5% in weight) at 3000 rpm for 40 s.12 Finally, 10 nm MoO3 and a 120 nm Ag electrode were deposited by thermal evaporation. The effective area of the device was defined as 7.25 mm2 with a commercial available mask. The J–V curves were obtained through a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under a simulated AM 1.5G spectrum at 100 mW cm−2 with a solar simulator (Class AAA, 94023A-U; Newport Corporation). The range of testing voltage was from −1.3 V to 1.3 V, with a scanning step of 0.0125 V and a scanning rate of 0.1 V s−1. The EQE spectrum was recorded through certified incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency equipment (Solar Cell Scan 100, Zolix Instruments Co. Ltd.).
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, by dissolving functional conjugated polymers in a QD solution to prepare a polymer-QD BHJ hybrid interfacial layer, we have demonstrated an efficient and universal strategy for fabricating QD solar cells with improved efficiency. The introduction of conjugated polymers into the PQD layer can form a hybrid BHJ interfacial connecting layer, which plays an important role in optimizing the PQD film surface morphology, improving the contact between the active layer and the HTL and tuning the surface to a hydrophobic one. All these modifications can strengthen charge transfer at interfaces and suppress interfacial recombination, finally governing the device efficiency and stability. More importantly, we have shown that through rational selection of the conjugated polymers with appropriate HOMO levels, the polymers can further strengthen these functions. Through optimizing the concentration of the conjugated polymer in the hybrid BHJ connecting layer, an improved PCE of ∼14% and 13.2% was achieved for CsPbI3 and FAPbI3 PQD solar cells, respectively, in comparison with a PCE of 13.1% and 11.6% for the control devices. We believe our work may provide a facile, versatile, and universal approach to tune organic–inorganic interfaces for fabricating efficient and stable PQD solar cells.
