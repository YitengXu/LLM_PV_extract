    , Accepted 12th July 2021First published on 13th July 2021AbstractDeveloping an effective method to decrease the voltage loss (Vloss) and increase the short-circuit current density (JSC) simultaneously is of vital importance to realize high-efficiency organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, we adopted three material combinations based on three medium bandgap (1.91 eV) benzotriazole (BTA)-based polymer donors (J52, J52-F, J52-OMe) and a narrow bandgap (1.48 eV) thiophene-fused benzotriazole containing a small molecule acceptor (JC2) to balance the JSC and open-circuit voltage (VOC). JC2 extended the light harvesting region, affording a high JSC. Methoxy or fluorine substitutions effectively decrease ΔV2 and ΔV3 due to their decreased charge transfer (CT) state absorption and enhanced EL external quantum efficiency (EQEEL). Consequently, a significant reduction of total voltage loss of 0.589 V is realized in both J52-OMe and J52-F based devices compared to a large one (0.725 V) for J52:JC2. J52-F and J52-OMe achieved high VOC values of 0.991 V and 0.986 V, much higher than that of the J52:JC2 combination (0.850 V). On the other hand, in the substituted two blend films a slower charge transfer process and lower hole/electron mobilities than those of the J52:JC2 blend occurred, leading to their slightly lower JSC. Finally, J52-F:JC2 and J52-OMe:JC2 reach a fine balance between VOC and JSC, producing power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 11.4% and 11.2%, respectively. This work not only expands the accessible material combinations used in high VOC systems, but also provides a deep insight into how the subtle substitutions affect their OPV performances.
1. Introduction
Non-fullerene organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted tremendous interest in recent years owing to their special advantages, such as facile modification of their optical/electronic properties and strong absorption in visible light.1–8 These huge successes mainly originate from the novel molecular structure design combined with favorable combinations between donors and acceptors.9–18 For instance, since the report of Y6 in 2019,9 its superior intrinsic properties, including the unique molecular structure, negligible energetic driving force but efficient charge generation19,20 and suitable energy level alignment,21,22 have accounted for a remarkable breakthrough in OPVs, which directly pushes this field to a second golden age. PM6:Y6 could achieve VOC = 0.84 V and PCE = 16.88%23 and D18:Y6 could realize VOC = 0.86 V and PCE = 18.22%12 through device engineering. By contrast, for the high VOC OPV systems, simultaneously obtaining a high PCE is a challenge, which needs careful modulation between the energy levels of the donor and acceptor. In our previous works, we synthesized a series of benzotriazole (BTA)-based A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type small molecular acceptors and proposed a “Same-A-Strategy” (SAS) to design the active layer materials,24–30 in which both the polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors had the same electron-withdrawing moiety (A), i.e., benzotriazole (BTA). Due to the decreased energy offsets, we attained some high-voltage OPV devices. The material combination of J52-F:BTA13 and J52-Cl:BTA3 could reach VOC = 1.18 V, PCE = 8.36%25 and VOC = 1.24 V, PCE = 10.5%,27 respectively. However, since the BTA-based acceptor materials are medium bandgap ones, i.e., their absorption onsets locate in the range of 1.7–1.9 eV, the external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the fabricated OPV devices can only reach a maximum onset of around 720 nm. Hence, the highest JSC is limited at ∼13 mA cm−2.27 Further broadening the absorption band of these small-molecule acceptors and maintaining the high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels would realize a good balance between JSC and VOC.
It has been demonstrated that the fusion of BTA could increase its quinoid structural population, which can effectively decrease the optical bandgap and broaden the absorption spectrum of the final material.31–34 For example, Chen et al.33 reported one thiophene-fused BTA based small molecular acceptor (SMA) JC2, which has an A2–A1–D–A1–A2 type backbone and exhibits a near-infrared absorption up to 830 nm and a high-lying LUMO level of −3.73 eV. Thus, this fused BTA-based SMA is expected to raise the JSC while simultaneously maintaining a high VOC.
In this contribution, we applied JC2 to pair with three BTA based polymers, J52, methoxy-substituted and fluorine-substituted analogues J52-OMe and J52-F (shown in Scheme 1) and investigated the influence of subtle modifications on the properties of polymer donors as well as the performance of their OPV devices. The three material combinations were systematically studied using the highly sensitive external quantum efficiency (s-EQE) and EL measurements, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Our results show that the methoxy and fluorine substitutions gradually decrease the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels. S-EQE and EL measurements reveal that both the methoxy and fluorine substitutions obviously reduce the radiative loss below bandgap (ΔV2) and non-radiative loss (ΔV3) due to the decreased CT state absorption and enhanced EQEEL. As a result, the total voltage loss (Vloss) is largely decreased to 0.589 V with an improved and close VOC values of 0.991 V and 0.986 V for J52-F:JC2 and J52-OMe:JC2, respectively. J52-OMe:JC2 and J52-F:JC2 exhibit a slower charge transfer rate and lower hole/electron mobilities than J52:JC2, giving rise to slightly decreased JSC. Thus, because the methoxy and fluorine substitutions only slightly decline the JSC but largely reduce the voltage loss, J52-F:JC2 and J52-OMe:JC2 eventually realize close and relatively high PCEs of 11.44% and 11.18%. Our data revealed the important role of the methoxy- and fluoro-substitutions in balancing the VOC and JSC of the fused BTA based OSCs and achieving improved PCEs.

2. Result and discussion
UV-vis absorption and energy level alignment
The J52-OMe and J52-F were synthesized via the Stille coupling reaction in toluene, as shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). J52 was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc (Beijing). JC2 was obtained from the lab of Prof. Xingguo Chen. The detailed procedures are provided in the ESI.† The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of J52-OMe and J52-F are 23.2 kDa/2.22 and 30.0 kDa/2.33, respectively, estimated using gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The normalized ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectra of the polymers and JC2 in thin film and dilute chloroform solution are depicted in Fig. 1a and Fig. S1(a) (ESI†), respectively. The absorption spectra of the three blend films are shown in Fig. S1b (ESI†) as well. From the absorption spectra it can be observed that the three polymers exhibit a similar characteristic featuring two absorption peaks at around 520 nm and 600 nm, same absorption onset at 650 nm (corresponding to a bandgap of 1.91 eV). This indicates that the methoxy and fluorine modifications on the thiophene side chains of the BDT unit have a negligible influence on their optical properties. Meanwhile, JC2 displays a broad absorption with onset up to 838 nm (corresponding to a bandgap of 1.48 eV) benefited from its increased quinoid structural population as aforementioned. Eventually, it appears that the absorption of polymers and JC2 complement each other well, which could be helpful to obtain a high JSC. Fig. 1b shows the HOMO energy level alignment measured by the cyclic voltammetry (CV) method with the Fc/Fc+ couple as an external standard. The original CV curves are displayed in Fig. S2 (ESI†). It should be noted that the values of J52, J52-F and JC2 are taken directly from the literature.25,33 The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) value of J52-OMe is obtained by subtracting its optical bandgap from the corresponding HOMO energy level. In contrast to our expectation, both methoxy and fluorine modifications decreased the HOMO and LUMO of J52 even though methoxy is commonly considered as an electron-donating group, which was also observed elsewhere.35,36

Photovoltaic performance
The photovoltaic performance of the three devices was investigated by fabricating the conventional OPV device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J52-X (X = H, OMe, F):JC2/PDINO/Al. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimal devices are illustrated in Fig. 1c. The detailed photovoltaic parameters and the screened optimization processes are collated in Table 1 and Tables S1, S2 (ESI†). As expected, both methoxy and fluorine substitutions distinctly improve VOC due to their lower HOMO energy levels. However, J52-OMe:JC2 attains a nearly identical VOC (0.986 V) to that of J52-F:JC2 (0.991 V) despite its higher HOMO level, which could be ascribed to a similar voltage loss in the J52-OMe:JC2 device and will be discussed below. In terms of charge generation, all three combinations attain a relatively high JSC with 19.04 mA cm−2 for J52:JC2, 18.33 mA cm−2 for J52-OMe:JC2 and 18.05 mA cm−2 for J52-F:JC2, indicating that the charge generation is efficient in these three devices. Furthermore, the sequential decreased absorption of the J52:JC2, J52-OMe:JC2 and J52-F:JC2 blend films could account for this same reduction tendency on JSC to some extent (Fig. S1b, ESI†). Detailed discussion on the difference in JSC is provided below. Fig. 1d shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimal devices. It can be seen that the three devices exhibit a broad and efficient charge generation in the range of 300–800 nm. The calculated JSCs are 18.13, 17.50 and 17.39 mA cm−2 for J52, J52-OMe and J52-F based devices respectively, which agree well with the values obtained from the J–V curves with mismatch within 5%.

Voltage loss analysis
To investigate the causes for the distinct VOC differences between the J52, J52-OMe and J52-F based devices in detail, s-EQE and EL measurements were performed. The detailed energy loss data of these solar cells are listed in Table 2. Based on detailed balance limitation theory,37 the voltage loss could be divided into three parts: (1)where q is the element charge, VSQOC is the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limited VOC, VradOC is the limited VOC assuming that all the recombination is radiative, ΔVnon-radOC is the non-radiative loss, Eg is the optical bandgap, which is derived from the corresponding device's EQE curves via SQ-VLA software (Enlitech). Apparently, as the three devices consist of the same low bandgap acceptor JC2, they show nearly identical Eg. Thus, J52:JC2, J52-OMe:JC2 and J52-F:JC2 attain similar VSQOC values of 1.302, 1.302 and 1.306 V, respectively, with ΔV1 being around 0.27 V. To identify ΔV2, we performed the s-EQE to study the three devices’ CT properties.21,37–39 As shown in Fig. 2a, the three devices display similar s-EQE curves, but J52:JC2 exhibits an obvious absorption at low energy, which could be attributed to the CT state absorption. After substitution with methoxy and fluorine, the CT absorption is decreased. Consequently, the ΔV2 values of J52-OMe:JC2 and J52-F:JC2 are decreased to 0.034 V and 0.036 V, respectively, in contrast to the large one of 0.123 V for J52:JC2.

In terms of non-radiative loss ΔV3, which could be determined by the equation: . The EQEEL of three devices are depicted in Fig. 2b, J52:JC2 exhibits a quite low EQEEL with a value of 6.86 × 10−6 (note that this value is extracted at JSC), which donates a high ΔV3 of 0.308 V. By contrast, after methoxy or fluorine substitutions, the EQEELs are largely enhanced with values of 6.67 × 10−5 and 7.00 × 10−5, respectively, which are one magnitude higher than that of J52:JC2. Thus, the ΔV3 is effectively reduced to 0.249 and 0.248 V, respectively, indicating that the methoxy and fluorine substitutions could effectively decrease the non-radiative loss. Furthermore, as the EQEELs are very close for the J52-OMe and J52-F based devices; there is negligible difference between the methoxy and fluorine substitutions with regards to their non-radiative loss. The separate voltage losses are shown in Fig. 2c. The main reason for the largely reduced voltage loss after methoxy and fluorine substitutions could be attributed to the effective decrease of both ΔV3 and ΔV2. Meanwhile, there are no differences between the J52-OMe and J52-F based devices at any part of the voltage loss.
Charge transfer process, theoretical calculations, and charge transport properties
Since JSC is decided by several processes, such as charge transfer, charge transport and charge collection process, we performed transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) to study the effects of the methoxy and fluorine substitutions on their charge transfer process when blended with JC2. Given that the differences of the HOMO energy level (ΔEHOMO) between the donors and acceptor are smaller than the differences of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level, which comes out to be the dominant limitation of the charge transfer as well, here we mainly concentrate on the hole transfer from JC2 to J52-X in blend films. We selectively excite the pristine JC2 film and the three blend films at 680 nm, where only JC2 has strong absorption but without excitation of the donors (Fig. 1a). The TAS spectra are shown in Fig. 3(a–d). From the TAS spectra of JC2, we could find that there mainly exist two ground-state bleaching peaks at 680 and 760 nm, which could be attributed to the exciton decay signals of JC2 given that only JC2 excitons exist when the pristine film was excited.40 After the blend films were excited, all three blend films showed a distinct JC2 exciton signal at 680 nm and 760 nm, which disappeared with the delay time, while the JC2 exciton signal at 760 nm cannot be differentiated due to the large signal/noise ratio. Meanwhile, two increasing bleaching peaks appear at 550 and 600 nm with time delay, which should be assigned to the charge signal corresponding to the charge transfer process with increasing charge separation. In order to quantitatively investigate the charge transfer rate in the three blend films, we extract the exciton delay dynamics at 680 nm and plot them in Fig. 3e. It is found that J52:JC2 exhibits the fastest charge transfer than that of J52-OMe:JC2 and J52-F:JC2, while the latter two blend films show a nearly identical charge transfer rate. Meanwhile, all three blends show faster exciton delay than the pristine JC2 due to the hole transfer process in the mixed film. When fitted with a biexponential delay function, we obtain two lifetime components for each film: 1.9 ± 0.13 ps and 49.3 ± 5.5 ps for the pristine JC2, 0.5 ± 0.06 ps and 2.7 ± 0.20 ps for J52:JC2, 1.3 ± 0.06 ps and 19.2 ± 1.74 ps for J52-OMe:JC2, and 1.2 ± 0.10 ps and 11.2 ± 0.98 ps for J52-F:JC2. Indeed, charge transfer in the latter two blend films is slower than that of J52:JC2, indicating that the methoxy and fluorine substitutions decelerate the charge transfer process when blended with JC2, which should be restrained by their electronic structures (Fig. 1b).

All films were excited at 680 nm, where only JC2 could be excited without the excitation of donors. (e) Time evolution dynamics for the three blend films probed at 680 nm. 
Furthermore, we perform the density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the effects of donor–acceptor interactions and fragment charge differences on the charge transfer rate. We optimized the donor–acceptor complex geometry at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/6-31G(d) level using Gaussian 09 package. Given that J52-OMe and J52-F have large similarities to J52 except for subtle substitutes on the side chain of BDT, we speculate that their stacking to JC2 would be similar.41 Hence, here we only calculated the J52/JC2 complex. The initial geometry of the complex can be found in Fig. S3 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4b, both the A2 and A1 units (marked as blue circle and rectangle) of JC2 interact with the thiophene–BTA–thiophene (T–BTA–T) unit of J52 and forming the π–π stacking with 3.52 Å, but the BTAZT unit mainly stacks onto the BTA unit of the polymer. To quantitatively define the fragment charges of the interaction domain (mark as red rectangle or circle), we first calculate the electrostatic potential (ESP) of the polymers and JC2 (Fig. 4a). Afterward, we perform quantitative analysis of the atomic charges using the atomic dipole corrected Hirshfeld atomic charge (ADCH) method42 by Multiwfn43 since this method has been proved to be robust in reproducing molecular dipole moment and ESP, correlating slightly to the basis sets and wavefunctions as well. The ADCH charges of T–BTA–T appear to be −0.181, −0.176 and −0.166 a.u. for J52, J52-OMe and J52-F, respectively. Therefore, the largest charge difference between J52 and JC2 would be another reason for the fastest charge transfer process in blend. Regarding the disagreement of J52-OMe and J52-F between calculations and TAS, we speculate that the precise interaction position of J52-OMe/JC2 and J52-F/JC2 would be slightly different from that of J52/JC2, where the interaction domains should display nearly identical charge difference between polymers and JC2.

Moreover, the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method is used to characterize the hole and electron mobilities of the three blends with device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blends/Au and ITO/TiOx/blends/Al. The mobilities are determined using the equation:  where J is the current density, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the blends, μ is the carrier mobility, L is the thickness of the active layer and V is the internal potential of the device. The J1/2–V curves of the three blends are depicted in Fig. 5. The hole mobilities and electron mobilities are estimated to be 1.24 × 10−4/8.85 × 10−4, 0.95 × 10−4/6.19 × 10−4 and 0.82 × 10−4/5.36 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for J52:JC2, J52-OMe:JC2 and J52-F:JC2, respectively. Thus, the fastest charge transfer rate and largest hole/electron mobilities account for the improved JSC (19.04 mA cm−2) of J52:JC2, while the close charge transfer rates and hole/electron mobilities produce nearly identical but lower JSC for J52-OMe:JC2 (18.33 mA cm−2) and J52-F:JC2 (18.05 mA cm−2).

Morphology
To investigate the morphology of the three blend films, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was carried out and the height images are displayed in Fig. 6. Obviously, these three blends have a smooth surface morphology with small root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 1.33, 1.06 and 1.09 nm for J52, J52-OMe and J52-F based blend films, respectively. The slightly larger roughness in the J52:JC2 blend may be correlated to the enhanced phase separation, which can be proved by the higher carrier mobilities, thus yielding a higher JSC. The similar RMS values of J52-OMe and J52-F based blend films indicate that the methoxy and fluorine substitutions have an insignificant effect on the morphology of the blend films in JC2 systems and give rise to similar JSC.

3. Conclusions
In conclusion, we systematically designed three BTA-based polymers to match a thiophene-fused BTA unit based small molecular acceptor JC2, for simultaneously improving the JSC and VOC of OPV cells. Both methoxy and fluorine substitutions downshift the HOMO energy level of the polymers with distinctly improved VOC but slightly compromised JSC. Voltage loss analysis reveals that both ΔV2 and ΔV3 are effectively reduced after methoxy and fluorine substitutions, which stems from the decreased CT absorption and enhanced EQEEL values, respectively. Thus, a total voltage loss of 0.589 V was achieved in both the J52-OMe:JC2 and J52-F:JC2 devices compared to 0.725 V for the J52:JC2 device. Although the slower charge transfer process and lower hole/electron mobilities of the J52-OMe and J52-F blends than those of the J52 blend slightly decline the JSC values (18.33 mA cm−2 for J52-OMe:JC2, 18.05 mA cm−2 for J52-F:JC2 compared to 19.04 mA cm−2 for J52:JC2), the largely reduced voltage loss leads to eventually improved PCEs of 11.44% and 11.18% for J52-F:JC2 and J52-OMe:JC2 with high VOC values of 0.991 V and 0.986 V, respectively. Moreover, this work gives a deep insight into how subtle substitutions affect the OPV performances and provides a guideline for designing matched polymer donors and acceptors to balance the trade-off between JSC and VOC and realize high device performance.
