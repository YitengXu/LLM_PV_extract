    , Accepted 1st December 2013First published on 2nd December 2013AbstractA competitive power conversion efficiency of 7.01% is achieved for TiO2-based dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) using a chemically stable and mechanically robust molybdenum di-sulfide (MoS2) counter electrode, synthesized using a simple, scalable and low-temperature wet-chemical process, owing to its good redox reaction stability.
In dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), a thermally evaporated or drop-cast platinum (Pt) counter electrode (CE) is commonly favored due to its excellent electrocatalytic activity. The ever escalating cost, scarcity and mandatory high temperature annealing requirements of Pt, however, remain a hurdle in the context of commercialization. Thus, it is imperative to replace Pt with an alternative eco-friendly and cost-effective CE that would exhibit comparable chemical stability and catalytic activity.1–3 Various alternatives, including conducting polymers, carbon materials, transition metals, inorganic materials, nitrides, carbides and most recently, electrochemically reduced graphene oxide etc.,4,5 have been explored as counter-electrodes in DSSCs. On the other hand, environmentally benign, abundant, and non-expensive transition metal di-chalcogenides (MX2, M = Mo, W and X = S, Se), sulfides and selenides are subject to extensive investigations due to their strong catalytic activities and potential applications, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, chemical sensors, thermoelectric devices, lithium-ion batteries, fuel cells and non-volatile memory devices, etc.6,7 Among them, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), which is typically a two-dimensional, layered transition metal sulfide, exhibits a hexagonal structure in which a sheet of Mo atoms is sandwiched between two hexagonally packed sulphur layers. The bonding between the three stacked atomic layers (S–Mo–S) is covalent and held together by weak van der Waals interactions. Moreover, with an indirect band gap energy of 1.2 eV, it is a semiconductor with tremendous potential in the areas of photovoltaics and photocatalysis.7,8 Most importantly, it can be synthesized at low temperatures using wet chemical methods.8
Despite the few reports of DSSCs with CE based on MoS2–carbon composites (synthesized in situ by a hydrothermal method at 200 °C for 48 h) with power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 7.59% and 7.69%,9 surprisingly, the literature on DSSCs with a solution-processed pristine MoS2 CE is still inadequate.10 In this study, we introduce a simple, scalable (2.5 × 10 cm2) and reproducible synthesis method for the fabrication of a (pristine) MoS2 CE using a low-temperature, wet chemical route. This work is a continuation of our research focused on the development of low-temperature chemical syntheses of DSSC components.11 The performance of TiO2-based DSSCs with a MoS2 CE exhibit an impressive 7.01% PCE, which is comparable to DSSCs with a Pt CE (7.31%), on account of the excellent electrocatalytic activities (I3− reduction) of MoS2.
The MoS2 CE was fabricated by immersing the pre-cleaned fluorine-tin-oxide (FTO) substrates in a reaction beaker containing appropriate concentrations of molybdenum(V) chloride and thioacetamide in an ethanolic solution at 70 °C for 7 h (Fig. S1, ESI†). On completion of the reaction, the products were taken off, washed with ethanol and distilled water, and dried with argon gas prior to use. The Pt CE was freshly synthesized using a drop-cast method, as reported previously.10 In brief, a thin TiO2 blocking layer (100 nm) was deposited onto FTO by immersing the FTO in 0.1 M TiCl4 for 45 min at 70 °C and annealing at 450 °C for 30 min in air. A TiO2 layer (4 μm) with an average particle size of ∼20 nm was coated by the doctor blade method. A light scattering TiO2 layer (thickness ≈ 3 μm) was applied over the previously deposited TiO2 and sintered again at 450 °C for 30 min. The prepared TiO2 photoanode was dipped in 0.3 mM N719 (ethanol + acetonitrile) dye for 24 h to prepare the dye cell. The DSSCs were fabricated by injecting a liquid electrolyte (0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M tetrabutylammonium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile) through an aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the CE (MoS2 & Pt CEs, individually). The field-emission scanning electron microscopy analysis revealed that the fabricated MoS2 CE consists of densely packed nanocrystallites with diameters of 50–200 nm. Fig. S2a–d in the ESI† demonstrates that the CE surface is free of cracks and that the nanocrystallites are stacked one above the other with a thickness of 100 nm. This would propagate unperturbed charge transport. A grain size of 5–10 nm is evidenced from high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images (Fig. S2e–f, ESI†). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the MoS2 CE (Fig. 1a) obtained on a glass substrate shows a hexagonal crystal structure with a molybdenite mineral-type form (JCPDS no. 731508). The diffraction at 2θ = 26.2° (300) is of higher intensity compared to the others (33.4°, 37.5°, 51.35°, 54.4° and 61.5°, 65.5° and 78.4°), reflecting strong orientation along the a-direction. The MoS2 phase is also confirmed from the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern and the lattice spacing of 0.35 nm, obtained from the SAED pattern (Fig. S2g, ESI†), agrees with the d-spacing of the (300) MoS2 plane (JCPDS no 731508). A chemical 1:2 stoichiometry for Mo and S, approved from the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. S2h, ESI†) analysis, again confirms the formation of MoS2. A set of fuzzy rings due to random orientation of the crystallites, corresponding to diffraction from different planes, corroborates its nanocrystalline nature. The Raman characteristic peaks (Fig. 1b) at 376 cm−1, 459 cm−1, 654 cm−1 and 821 cm−1 correspond to the E12g, 2LA, A1g and 2A1g Raman modes of MoS2. The surface area obtained using N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms (H1 type) of MoS2 (scratched from the electrode) is 159.67 m2 g−1 (Fig. S3, ESI†). A broad and diffused peak at 10–150 nm and a sharp peak at ∼0.36 nm (inset) in the pore-size distribution curve confirms the nanoporous structure of MoS2, which should naturally result in enhanced redox reactions. A Hall measurement (Fig. S4, ESI†) carried out at 300 K revealed p-type conductivity of the MoS2 CE (conductivity = 2.6 × 10−4 Ω cm−1, charge mobility = 2.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, Hall coefficient = 8.05 × 103 m2 C−1 and surface charge concentration = 2.32 × 1010 cm2). The XPS spectrum of the MoS2 CE is presented in Fig. 2a. In the C1s spectra (Fig. 2b), peaks at 285.1 eV to 286.1 eV binding energies are due to C–C, C–H and C–O bonds, respectively. The Mo3d signal (Fig. 2c) consists of two doublets. The doublet (Mo3d5/2 = 229.4 eV; Mo3d3/2 = 232.6 eV) at a relatively low binding energy can be assigned to the Mo ion in the +4 oxidation state, whereas the other doublet (Mo3d5/2 = 232.6 eV; Mo3d3/2 = 235.8 eV) is attributed to the Mo ion in MoO3, which could possibly be formed in due course of redox reactions. Furthermore, the peaks at binding energies of 162.2 and 163.3 eV are assigned to the spin–orbit couple S2p3/2 and S2p1/2, respectively (Fig. 2d). These XPS signals are consistent with values reported elsewhere,11 corroborating the formation of defect-free MoS2.

The electrocatalytic activity and stability of the MoS2 CE for iodide reduction in relation with a Pt CE are investigated using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and other electrochemical measurements using a symmetrical sandwich-type configuration. The CV spectra (Fig. 3a) for the Pt and MoS2 CEs in a I3−/I− redox electrolyte at a 10 mV s−1 scan rate shows the distinct cathodic peak potential of the MoS2 and Pt CEs at −0.125 and −0.127 V, respectively, supporting that the electrocatalytic activity of MoS2 is comparable, which is attributed to its relatively higher surface roughness compared to the much smoother Pt (discussed later). Here, the anodic peak is responsible for 3I− formation, whereas the cathodic peak produces 2I3− after accepting two electrons.12 On the other hand, closely matched peak current densities of MoS2 (−6.35 mA cm−2) and Pt (−6.41 mA cm−2) confirms the competitive electrocatalytic activity as well as similar chemical capability of MoS2 (in comparison to Pt) to reduce tri-iodide to iodide. Moreover, with an increase in the scan rate from 10 to 250 mV s−1 (Fig. 3b), the overall enclosed area of the voltammogram for the MoS2 CE increases along with the current density, indicating that at a high scan rate, the inner sites of MoS2 also become reactive.13 The higher peak current densities and lower peak-to-peak (Epp) separation value (Table 1) confirm that MoS2 offers remarkable electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of I3−. Furthermore, the unaltered curve shape and almost constant current density for 100 cycles carried out at a sweeping rate of 10 mV s−1 (Fig. 3c) confirms the excellent electrochemical stability of the MoS2 CE in the I−/I3−-based electrolyte system. In the Tafel polarization curves (Fig. 3d), a larger slope in the anodic and cathodic stream indicates nearly the same exchange current (Jo).12 Apparently, the calculated Jo also follows the order of MoS2 > Pt, which is consistent with the short-circuit current density (Jsc) value, suggesting that the MoS2 CE has similar electrocatalytic activity to a Pt CE. To further elucidate the catalytic activities of the CEs on the reduction of tri-iodide, EIS experiments were carried out using symmetric cells fabricated with two identical electrodes (CE–electrolyte–CE). The Nyquist plots (Fig. 4a) for the symmetric cells with the MoS2 CE illustrate impedance characteristics, in which two semicircles are observed in the higher (left) and lower (right) frequency regions. According to the Randles-type circuit (see Fig. S5, ESI†), the low-frequency intercept on the real axis represents the series resistance (Rs). The left arc arises from the Rct at the CE–electrolyte interface, which changes inversely with the catalytic activity of the MoS2 CE on the reduction of tri-iodide, and the corresponding constant phase element (CPE), while the right arc arises from the diffusion impedance (W1) of the I3−/I− redox couple in the electrolyte. The impedance values presented in Table S1 of the ESI† are calculated using the total surface area of the catalysts on the electrode of the dummy cell. The obtained Rs value for the MoS2 CE (23.51 Ω cm2) is lower than the Pt CE (26.73 Ω cm2), indicating good catalytic activity on the reduction of tri-iodide. The Rct values of the MoS2 and Pt CEs are 18.50 and 22.88 Ω cm2, respectively. Here, W1 is increased from the MoS2 CE (1.8 Ω cm2) to the Pt CE (2.3 Ω cm2), suggesting that the diffusion coefficients of tri-iodide vary in the inverse order. Overall, the catalytic activity obtained from the EIS and CV data is consistent. This strongly suggests that a MoS2 CE would be a good alternative to replace expensive Pt CEs in DSSCs.

Fig. 4c presents the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of DSSCs based on MoS2 and Pt CEs under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The obtained PCE parameters are summarized in Table 1. DSSCs employing MoS2 as the CE exhibited an excellent PCE of 7.01% owing to a Jsc value of 18.46 mA cm−2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.68 V, and fill factor (ff) of 0.58. This performance is close to that obtained for DSSCs having a Pt CE (PCE = 7.31%). Slight variations in the Voc followed by Jsc values for the DSSCs of both CEs are attributed to: (a) the higher surface roughness of MoS2 (19 ± 0.25 nm) compared to Pt (6 nm) (Fig. S6, ESI†), (b) the nanoporous nature of the MoS2 CE in contrast to the planar Pt CE, and (c) the p-type conductivity of MoS2. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency curves of DSSCs based on Pt and MoS2 CEs (Fig. 4b) exhibit similar characteristics as well as responses, suggesting that almost similar catalytic activity is offered by the MoS2 CE.
A summary of the results obtained in this work and other reported literature involving MoS2-based CEs (composites) is compiled in Table S2 in the ESI.† It is noteworthy to mention that a pristine MoS2 CE, synthesized using a wet chemical method at ambient temperature (70 °C), has demonstrated remarkable TiO2-based DSSCs performance and it is the first study of its kind so far.
In summary, we present for the first time, the use of a wet chemically synthesized pristine MoS2 CE in DSSCs. DSSCs based on a mechanically robust MoS2 CE with a molybdenite mineral-type structure exhibited a competitive power conversion efficiency of 7.01%, which is largely comparable to DSSCs with Pt CEs (PCE = 7.31%). The MoS2 CE presented in this work is quite promising and is a prospective candidate to replace highly expensive Pt as a CE, owing to its comparable catalytic properties and most importantly, the ease of fabrication at extremely low temperatures.
