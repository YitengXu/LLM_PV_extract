    , Accepted 9th July 2012First published on 11th July 2012AbstractWe report the first case of Ru(II) dipyrrinates employed as dyes in dye-sensitized solar cells. These complexes exhibit panchromatic light harvesting that results in significant DSSC current densities, rendering them promising for photovoltaic applications. Adjustment of the lowest excited state energy is required to boost the power conversion efficiency.
The last two decades have witnessed a fast-paced growth of research and development of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) – appealing light-harvesting devices that combine low fabrication costs with promising light-to-electricity conversion efficiencies.1 In a conventional DSSC, photoexcitation of a dye leads to a rapid electron injection from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of TiO2, followed by regeneration of the sensitizer by a reversible redox mediator (e.g. I3−/I−) in the electrolyte. Since light-harvesting is the key process in the DSSC device, many efforts have been devoted to increasing the absorptivity and stability of the dyes.2 Ru polypyridine dyes exhibit remarkable performance owing to their strong absorption in the visible region and long-lived charge-separated excited states.3 The most well-known among them are coded [Ru(H2dcbpy)2(NCS)2] (N3; dcbpy = 4,4′-dicarboxylato-2,2′-bipyridine),4 (Bu4N)2[Ru(Hdcbpy)2(NCS)2] (N719),5 and (Bu4N)3[Ru(Htctpy)(NCS)3], tctpy = 2,2′:6′,2′′-terpyridyl-4,4′,4′′-tricarboxylate (N749),6 and share an identical structural aspect, i.e. coordination of the RuII center by NCS− ions. The latter is believed to be the weakest part of the dye, due to the lability of the monodentate NCS− ligands.7
To improve the dye stability, chelating anionic ligands, e.g. those derived from phenyl-pyridine8,9 or pyridine-pyrazole,10,11 have been successfully explored as alternatives to the thiocyanato ligand. Nevertheless, examples of NCS−-free dyes are still scarce, which calls for an active exploration of Ru complexes with appropriate chelating ligands as potential DSSC components. In this context, dipyrrins are promising chelating ligands that exhibit strong absorption around 400–500 nm, which is complementary to the MLCT band of Ru polypyridine sensitizers. Nevertheless, Ru dipyrrinates have remained surprisingly underexplored.12
The first Ru dipyrrinate, [Ru(bpy)2(O2CPhDP)] (O2CPhDP = 4-carboxylatophenyl-dipyrrin), was reported only recently.13 The carboxylate group allows attachment of this complex to the surface of TiO2,14a but the excited-state electron density is not appropriately positioned for efficient sensitization of TiO2.14b In contrast, we have recently reported a detailed study of [Ru(dcmb)2(3-TDP)](PF6)15 (dcmb = 4,4′-bis(methoxycarbonyl)-2,2′-bipyridine; 3-TDP = 3-thienyl-dipyrrinate), in which the ester groups are positioned on the dcmb ligands, away from the dipyrrinate moiety. This compound exhibits remarkable absorptivity in the visible range and appropriate electrochemical and photophysical characteristics to warrant further investigation in the context of sensitizing TiO2. Cognizant that the thienyl substituents often help to increase the extinction coefficient (ε) of the MLCT band in Ru polypyridine complexes,16 we have modified our initially reported complex to contain 2-thienyl-dipyrrinate (2-TDP) instead of 3-TDP, with the expectation that moving the S atom closer to the dipyrrinato moiety will increase εMLCT, thus improving the light-harvesting properties of the resultant complex. Higher molar extinction coefficients enable thinner TiO2 films to be used, thereby suppressing deleterious interfacial electron transfer with the electrolyte prior to electrons reaching the collecting electrode.
Herein we report the synthesis and electronic, photophysical, and electrochemical properties of Ru complexes bearing 2-TDP or its 2,2′-bithiophene-substituted derivative (Scheme 1). We show that the nature of these dyes is conducive to charge separation and localization of electron density on the carboxylato-containing ligands in the excited state. This work also discloses, for the first time, the performance of DSSCs prepared with Ru dipyrrinate dyes.
 Scheme 1  Ru dipyrrinate complexes 1–4. 
A reaction between [(p-cymene)RuCl2]2 and 2-TDP results in the formation of the neutral complex [(p-cymene)Ru(2-TDP)Cl]. An ester derivative of the dye, [Ru(dcmb)2(2-TDP)]NO3, is obtained by refluxing a mixture of [(p-cymene)Ru(2-TDP)Cl], dcmb, and AgNO3 in MeOH overnight, followed by addition of an excess of NH4PF6 to precipitate [Ru(dcmb)2(2-TDP)]PF6. The corresponding dye, [Ru(H2dcbpy)(Hdcbpy)(2-TDP)] (2) is obtained by refluxing the ester derivative with Et3N in an H2O–DMF mixture for 18 h. Complexes 3 and 4 (Scheme 1) are prepared in similar fashion.†
UV-visible spectra of 1–4 and benchmark dye N3 are presented in Fig. 1. In comparison to N3, complex 2 exhibits significantly stronger absorption throughout the visible region and a slightly bathochromically shifted MLCT band (εMLCT = 1.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1 and 1.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for 2 and N3, respectively). The spectrum of 2 is also characterized by intense absorption band centered at 468 nm (ε = 4.3 × 104 M−1 cm−1) that mainly corresponds to a combination of dipyrrin π–π* transitions and ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) transitions from dipyrrin to H2dcbpy (vide infra). The εMLCT value of 2 is also notably higher than that of the analogous 3-TDP-containing complex 1 (1.7 × 104 M−1 cm−1). This finding supports the notion that the smaller separation between the dipyrrin moiety and the S atom of thienyl provides stronger coupling between the two aromatic fragments, although the lack of coplanarity between them appears to reduce the extent of coupling. The absorption spectra of 3 and 4 are nearly identical to that of 2, except that the shoulder at 375 nm in the latter is shifted to 400 nm and increased in intensity in 3 and 4. The absorption of visible light by these Ru dipyrrinates is superior to the vast majority of Ru(II) polypyridine complexes.17 Dyes 1–4 are not emissive due to a decrease in the highest occupied–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) energy gap enabling non-radiative decay from the excited state.18
 Fig. 1  Absorption spectra of 1–4 in MeOH and N3 in MeCN. 
To get better insight into the nature of the absorption bands, DFT calculations at the B3LYP/TZVP (DZVP for Ru) level in MeCN solution were carried out to obtain the optimized structure of 2 and the corresponding electronic structure (Table S1, ESI†). The calculations revealed that the HOMO corresponds to the π-orbital of 2-TDP (Fig. S1, ESI†) and lies slightly higher in energy than a set of three mostly metal 4d orbitals, with minor contributions from 2-TDP (HOMO − 1, HOMO − 2) or H2dcbpy (HOMO − 3) (Table S1, ESI†). The two lowest unoccupied orbitals (LUMO, LUMO + 1) are centered on H2dcbpy. At 0.4 eV above them appears a 2-TDP-centered π* orbital (LUMO + 2).
Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were used to simulate spin-allowed absorption bands of 2 in MeCN (Table S2 and Fig. S2, ESI†). The shoulder observed at 630 nm in the experimental spectrum corresponds to the theoretical bands at 616 and 589 nm, which are of MLCT character (Table 1). Also assigned as MLCT band is the one at 541 nm that corresponds to calculated excitations at 513 and 488 nm. The intense band at 468 nm is primarily due to the TDP-π → TDP-π* and TDP-π → H2dcbpy-π* (LLCT) excitations calculated at 420 nm. The low-energy side of this band includes another MLCT excitation at 435 nm, while the high-energy side has a shoulder attributed to the LLCT excitation at 391 nm. Note that the majority of excitations promote the excited electron to the H2dcbpy-based orbitals, which is a preferable scenario for photoinduced electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band.

The electrochemical properties of 2–4 were examined by cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S3, ESI†). The voltammograms were recorded in 0.1 M solutions of (Bu4N)PF6 in DMF, and the potentials were referenced to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE).† Each complex exhibits a quasi-reversible one-electron oxidation wave at 1.06 V, corresponding to the energy of the HOMO.19 The energy of the lowest excited state, E(S+/S*), was estimated as −0.59 V from the equation ES*/S = ES+/S – E0−0, where ES+/S = EHOMO and E0−0 is determined as the onset of the absorption spectrum (1.65 V). Thus, for each complex, the HOMO is located significantly lower than the redox potential of the I2˙−/I− couple (+0.8(1) V),20 while the lowest excited state appears to lie higher in energy than the bottom of the TiO2 conduction band (Ecb ∼ −0.50 V).1 The appropriate electrochemical characteristics and excellent light-harvesting properties make complexes 2–4 viable candidates for DSSC performance tests.
The performance of DSSCs constructed with 2–4 was studied under AM1.5 conditions. The current–voltage characteristics of cells prepared with 2 were probed in two electrolytes that differed in the identity of the cation and concentration of the iodide salt (i.e., 0.7 M (BMII + NaI) in EL1 and 1 M LiI in EL2), as well as auxiliary components (Table 2). A cell fabricated with EL1 showed an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.31 V and a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 0.71 mA cm−2. The same size cell with EL2 maintained the same Voc value, but produced a much higher Jsc of 6.85 A cm−2 (Fig. 2, Table 2). The dramatic increase in current density can be related to the changes in the electrolyte mixture; namely, the presence of the Li+ ions shifts the TiO2 conduction band to lower energy.3 As a result, the photo-induced electron transfer from the dye into the TiO2 is energetically favourable in the cell with EL2. These observations also suggest that the E(S+/S*) of 2 is close in energy to the Ecb of TiO2.

 Fig. 2  Current density–voltage curves of DSSCs prepared with dye 2 and electrolyte EL2 and recorded under AM1.5 illumination. The blue and red lines correspond to entries 2 and 3 in Table 1, respectively. 
To further probe the factors affecting the electron injection process, we examined the performance of DSSCs sensitized by 3 (which contains a bulkier bithienyl substituent) with various electrolyte compositions. The data obtained (Table S3, ESI†) clearly demonstrate that the increase in the concentration of Li+ ions leads to progressively higher current densities (Table S3, entries a–e, ESI†), although the Voc is slightly compromised at the highest concentration (1 M LiI). The presence of tBP (particularly at concentrations above 0.1 M), however, results in a significant suppression of Jsc – even at large concentrations of Li+ ions (Table S3, entries f–i, ESI†). Similar results were obtained with dye 4 (Table S4, ESI†). These collective findings indicate that, while the E(S+/S*) values of 2–4 are at the threshold of favorable charge transfer into the conduction band of TiO2, the lowering of the Ecb by using Li+ ions can lead to higher JSC values at the expense of VOC.
To the best of our knowledge, the complexes reported herein are the first examples of Ru(II) dipyrrinates used as DSSC dyes. The remarkable light-harvesting properties of this class of compounds yield significant current densities in DSSC devices, provided that the energy of TiO2 conduction band is adjusted to create a sufficent driving force for electron injection from the excited state of the dye. Efforts are underway in our laboratories to tune electronic energy levels of these complexes to help boost the voltages and PCEs of DSSCs that incorporate these dyes.
