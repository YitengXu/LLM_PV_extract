    , Accepted 16th January 2017First published on 17th January 2017AbstractSmall molecules with defined chemical structures and low quality variation are important for organic solar cells (OSCs). Three thieno[3,4-b]thiophene small-molecule donor materials, STB-C, STB-O and STB-S, with different side-chain substitutions of alkyl, alkoxy and alkylthio were synthesized and applied to investigate the heteroatom effects on the OSC performance. Optimized devices based on STB-C, STB-O and STB-S delivered power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.84%, 8.68% and 4.05%, respectively, revealing the distinct influence of heteroatoms. Systematic structure–property relationships were further investigated by using incident X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and resonant soft X-ray scattering. Compared with those of STB-C and STB-S, the highest efficiency of STB-O can be attributed to the excellent charge transport properties, originating from the stronger π–π stacking, a multi-length scaled phase separation and a slightly elevated LUMO energy level. It is noteworthy that STB-O delivered the highest PCE among small-molecule donors based on alkoxy-substituted BDTs.
1. Introduction
Due to the unique features of lightweight, flexibility, and low cost,1–3 bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) are regarded as a promising technology that may be utilized to partly cope with the energy issue. Over the past few years, the rapid development of BHJ-OSCs has led to high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% for single-junction devices by a joint endeavour of material development,4–11 morphology control,12 and device architecture optimization.13,14 Compared with polymer-based OSCs, small-molecule OSCs are believed to be another type of important candidates owing to their advantages of well-defined chemical structures and good batch-to-batch repeatability.15,16 Significant progress has been made for small-molecule OSCs with high PCEs over 9%.17–20
Quite a few approaches have been successfully adopted in molecular design to optimize OSC performances, one of which is to utilize the heteroatom effect on the electronic structure and self-assembly behaviour. Sun et al. reported a small-molecule donor, DTS(PTTh2)2, with pyridine rings achieving a higher PCE of 6.7% than that of DTS(BTTh2)2 with benzene rings, 0.18%, which was attributed to its wider absorption range, better crystallinity, and higher carrier mobility.8 Meanwhile, the selection of side chains containing heteroatoms is also crucial for achieving high-performance OSCs.9,21–24 Chen et al.9 designed a small-molecule donor, DR3TSBDT, containing a central dialkylthio-substituted BDT unit and achieved a high PCE of 9.95% because of the enhanced absorption and a preferable morphology of the optimized blend films. By incorporating an intramolecular noncovalent S–O interaction between side alkoxy chains and thiophene rings, Guo et al. disclosed high-performance polymers with narrow bandgaps.25 Systematic studies on the influence of the side-chain heteroatom effect on OSC performance are important, especially for small-molecule donors, which may provide a new insight into the molecular design of OSCs with even higher performance.
We recently developed a new category of small-molecule STB-n based on electron-rich 2-alkyl-substituted thieno[3,4-b]thiophenes,26 in which the quinoidal resonance meets donor–acceptor hybridization.27 By careful side-chain tuning and device optimizations, a high PCE of over 9% was achieved for STB-3. In this work, we designed and synthesized three donor materials, STB-C, STB-O and STB-S (Fig. 1), with alkyl(3-ethylheptyl), alkoxy[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy], and alkylthio[(2-ethylhexyl)thio] side chains on the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) moiety and systematically investigated the influence of chalcogen atoms on light absorption, molecular packing, thin-film morphology, and thus device performance. It should be noted that STB-O with the distal sulphur orientation shows much superior performance than that with the proximal sulphur orientation. Depending on the heteroatoms, the PCEs can vary significantly from 4.05% (STB-S), 7.84% (STB-C) to 8.68% (STB-O). It is noteworthy that STB-O-based devices delivered the highest PCE of 8.68% among small-molecule donors based on alkoxy-substituted BDTs.28,29

2. Results and discussion
Materials preparation
The synthesis of STB-C, STB-O, and STB-S is shown in Fig. 1. Compounds 2a, 2b, and 2c were synthesized from BDT-Sn 1a, 1b and 1c and 2-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-iodothieno[3,4-b]thiophene by the Stille coupling reaction, respectively. Compounds 2 were rapidly passed through a silica-gel column and used without further purification. Dialdehydes 3 were synthesized by deprotonation followed by the reaction with DMF in 30, 39 and 29% yields based on compounds 1, respectively. Target molecules STB-C, STB-O and STB-S were synthesized by the Knoevenagel reaction between compounds 3 and 3-ethylrhodanine in 78, 68, and 65% yields, respectively (after recrystallization) as black solids. All the target molecules show good solubility in common organic solvents (>15 mg mL−1 in CHCl3), which guaranteed their applications in solution-processed OPVs. As shown in Fig. S2,† STB-C, STB-O and STB-S exhibit good thermostability with high decomposition temperatures (5 wt% weight loss) at 362 °C, 326 °C and 332 °C, respectively.
Absorption and electrochemical properties
The detailed photophysical and electrochemical properties of STB-C, STB-O, and STB-S are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 2 presents the UV-vis absorption spectra of these molecules in diluted chloroform solutions and thin films. All the molecules show similar absorptions ranging from 450 to 700 nm with the maximum absorption peak (λabsmax) at 624 nm, and STB-S gives the highest molar absorptivity (ε) of 1.09 × 105 L M−1 cm−1. Compared with their absorptions in solutions, the maximum absorptions of STB-C, STB-O and STB-S in thin films are bathochromically shifted to 670, 680 and 676 nm by 46, 56 and 52 nm, respectively. The most intense shoulder peak of the STB-O suggests its effective intermolecular interaction in the solid state. The optical bandgaps estimated from the onsets of the thin-film absorptions are similarly 1.65 eV for all the compounds. The frontier orbital energy levels were further determined by cyclic voltammograms based on the onsets of oxidation and reduction waves (Fig. S1†). As shown in Fig. 2b, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are −5.11 and −3.52 eV for STB-C, −5.03 and −3.46 eV for STB-O, and −5.15 and −3.51 eV for STB-S, respectively. The LUMO energy level of STB-O is slightly higher than those of STB-C and STB-S, which may offer a larger energy offset between the LUMOs of donor and acceptor materials benefiting the exciton dissociation in blend films.

Photovoltaic performance
To systematically investigate the influence of heteroatoms on the photovoltaic performance of the three small-molecule donors, solution-processed BHJ solar cells were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donors:PC71BM/PFN/Al. The blend films were achieved by spin-coating a chloroform solution of STB donors and PC71BM with a total concentration of 25 mg mL−1 (1:1.5 mass ratio). Subsequently, solvent vapor annealing (SVA) using chloroform was employed to optimize the blend morphology and promote device performance. The J–V curves of the devices before and after SVA for 40 s are presented in Fig. 3a and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 2. All the as-cast devices showed relatively low device performances, especially in fill factors (FFs). STB-C showed the highest PCE of 4.6% among all three materials with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.03 V, a short-circuit current (Jsc) of 10.53 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.41. By contrast to STB-C, similar PCEs of ∼3% were obtained for as-cast devices based on STB-O and STB-S with a lower Jsc and FF. Vocs of the STB-O and STB-S are 0.93 V and 1.00 V, respectively. The lowest Voc of STB-O agrees well with the slightly high HOMO energy level. Surprisingly, after SVA, a high PCE of 8.68% was obtained for STB-O with significantly enhanced Jsc (from 8.92 to 13.85 mA cm−2) and FF (from 0.36 to 0.70). The STB-C-based device showed a moderate PCE of 7.84% after SVA with a Voc of 0.938 V, a Jsc of 12.10 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.68. For the STB-S-based device, SVA leads only to a limited increase in Jsc from 9.31 to 9.68 mA cm−2 and FF from 0.34 to 0.40, without notable changes in Voc. As a result, the selection of heteroatoms can significantly affect device performances. The PCE of an STB-O:PC71BM blend film is the highest among all small-molecule donor materials based on one-dimensional alkoxy-substituted BDTs. External quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the STB:PC71BM optimized blend films are shown in Fig. 3b, which indicate the efficiency of the photo-electron conversion process. Devices based on the three donor materials exhibited a similar broad photo-current response from 300 to 700 nm. Corresponding to the best device efficiency, EQEs of the STB-O are high over 60% between 550 and 700 nm with a maximum value up to 70% at around 630 nm, which means the most efficient photoelectron conversion process and is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra. The higher absorption intensity across the whole photo-current response areas of the STB-O:PC71BM blend than that of the STB-C:PC71BM one agrees well with the higher Jsc of the former. The lowest Jsc of the STB-S:PC71BM blend confirmed by the EQEs below 45% may result from the severe charge recombination or/and the charge extraction losses. All the Jsc values from the J–V test are consistent with the integration of the EQE curves showing a little mismatch within 3–5%. Distinct differences in the photovoltaic performances were analyzed by the charge generation and extraction, mobility, recombination kinetics, and morphology of the active layers, which will be discussed below.

The influence of SVA on the efficiency of charge generation and extraction is investigated by measuring the photocurrent density (Jph) versus the internal voltage (Vin). Jph is defined as Jph = JL − JD, where JL and JD are the current density under illumination and in the dark, respectively. The Vin is calculated by V0 − V, where V is the applied voltage, and V0 denotes the compensation voltage when Jph is 0.30 As shown in Fig. 4a, the Jph of the blended films after SVA from these three donor materials shows a different increasing trend under Vin. Both Jph of the STB-C and STB-O blends increase to their saturation value at high Vin (2 V and above), and the Jsat of the STB-C and STB-O blends are about 12.60 mA cm−2 and 14.37 mA cm−2, respectively. Considering that the UV-vis absorption spectra of these BHJ films only show slight differences, the higher Jph of the STB-O blend at the saturation point where the Vin is large enough to sweep out all carriers to the electrodes prior to recombination than that of STB-C and thus the superior charge extraction should mainly be attributed to the more favourable LUMO energy level and charge transport properties of STB-O. Although the EQEs of the STB-S blend are quite low, the Jph at high Vin (2 V) is comparable to the Jph of the STB-C blend and slightly lower than the Jph of the STB-O one. Thus, recombination loss is serious which limits the Jsc and FF.

The effect of SVA on the charge transport in these blends was investigated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurement and therefore the hole and electron mobilities are calculated by analyzing the J–V curves of single carrier devices (Fig. S5† and Table 2). The SVA treatment boosts the hole mobility of the STB-O:PC71BM blend from 1.08 × 10−4 to 3.02 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and the electron mobility from 2.88 × 10−4 to 3.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. Meanwhile, relatively little improvements of the hole (from 0.77 × 10−4 to 1.94 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron mobilities (from 2.26 × 10−4 to 3.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) are obtained in the STB-C:PC71BM blend. Notably, SVA mainly improved the hole mobilities in STB-O and STB-C blends. The highest and most balanced mobilities suppress the charge recombination loss and ensure the best device performance of the STB-O blend. For the STB-S:PC71BM blend, neither hole nor electron mobility can be improved effectively under a similar SVA procedure. The poor charge transport may be accountable for the rather low Jsc and FF.
To further investigate the relationship between charge transport and recombination in the optimal devices of these three molecules, the light intensity (P) dependence of Jph under different Vin conditions was measured. The recombination parameters (α) are obtained by fitting the power-law equation, Jph ∝ Pα.31 As shown in Fig. 4b–d, for the STB-C:PC71BM and STB-O:PC71BM blends, recombination parameters are all close to 1, which suggests the negligible bimolecular recombination and efficient sweep-out of carriers. These observations are consistent with the balanced hole and electron mobilities. Indeed, low and unbalanced carrier mobilities enhance the bimolecular recombination in the device based on STB-S. A recombination parameter of 0.87 found under a low Vin condition shows that the STB-S:PC71BM blend is space-charge limited around the Voc condition, confirmed by the strong electric field dependence of carrier transport in Fig. 4a.32 Only when the Vin is high enough can recombination get suppressed, indicating that the sweep-out is unfavorable for the optimal device based on STB-S.
Thin-film morphology
Given that the morphologies of these blend films are directly related to device performances, we carried out grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) to investigate BHJ thin film structural details. Shown in Fig. 5 are GIXD results. As-cast thin films for all these materials show a weak and similar crystalline order. A broad diffraction peak is seen at around 0.4 Å−1 in all samples, which is fully spread in all directions. A strong diffraction at 1.35 Å−1 is seen, coming from PCBM. BHJ films under solvent annealing showed drastic changes in the crystalline order. As seen from Fig. 5a and c, the crystalline structures are more pronounced. As seen from the STB-C sample, the (100) diffraction peaks become sharp and complicated (several peaks merged together), composed of polymorph structures. In the in-plane direction, a major peak by fitting is recorded at 0.35 Å−1 (1.79 nm), with a crystal coherence length (CCL) of 13.5 nm. The π–π stacking is more pronounced in the out-of-plane direction, and in line-cut profiles, which reads at 1.77 Å−1, corresponding to a distance of 0.36 nm. The STB-O sample shows a similar improvement in the crystalline order. The (100) peak is dominated by several scattering signals, the major one located at 0.39 Å−1 (1.61 nm) reading from the in-plane diffraction profile. The CCL in this direction is 14.6 nm. A quite sharp π–π stacking peak is seen for the STB-O sample that locates at 1.71 Å−1 (0.37 nm) in the out-of-plane direction. The π stacking CCL is estimated to be 4.5 nm, which is quite large in conjugated molecules, providing good transport properties, especially in the out-of-plane direction. The STB-S sample shows a less pronounced improvement under SVA treatment. Though the (100) diffraction peak in the out-of-plane direction shows some enhancement, other features remain quite similar compared to the as-cast thin film.

TEM and RSoXS are used for examining the phase-separated structure in BHJ thin films. As seen in Fig. 6, a different morphology is seen from different materials and processing conditions. STB-C as-cast blends showed a weak phase separation, which is at a 30–40 nm length scale in RSoXS. SVA changes the morphology into a fibril network structure, which comes from improved crystallization of the STB-C molecule. This phase structure change leads to strong scattering in RSoXS, giving a center distance of 26 nm. The reduced length scale of phase separation and the enhanced phase contrast give rise to the improved Jsc and FF in SVA-treated devices. The STB-O as-cast sample showed a reduced phase contrast, seen from both TEM and RSoXS. In the SVA sample, TEM reveals a multi-length scaled phase separation composed of nano-fibrils and dark colored aggregations. In RSoXS, a high intensity scattering peak is seen at 0.017 Å−1, giving a distance of 37 nm. The high scattering intensity indicates that the phase separation is quite sharp in blends, and the multi-length-scale morphology provides pathways for both carriers. Thus, optimal performance is obtained in this condition. The STB-S blend shows good mixing. The RSoXS curve shows a quite weak and continuous decay. Thus, poor device performance is expected. However, SVA treatment leads to a phase separation located at 0.0083 Å−1, (76 nm). The phase image from TEM is quite different from that of other materials. No fibrils are seen, which is correlated well with the less-ordered structure in GIXD. Dark aggregations are seen from TEM, which come from PCBM aggregations. It is seen from AFM characterization that these aggregations give large-sized surface feature variations. The less pronounced structure order and an unfavorable length scale of phase separation in the STB-S SVA sample give rise to the poor performance of the devices.

3. Conclusions
We designed and synthesized three new donor materials, STB-C, STB-O and STB-S, with different side-chain substitutions on BDTs and investigated the heteroatom effect of chalcogen on OSC performance in depth. STB-O with alkoxy side chains shows the most favourable photophysical and electrochemical properties than those of STB-C with alkyl side chains and STB-S with alkylthio side chains. Optimized devices based on STB-C, STB-O and STB-S exhibit PCEs of 7.84%, 8.68% and 4.05%, respectively, revealing the distinct influence of heteroatoms. Compared with that of STB-C, the higher efficiency of STB-O can be ascribed to the higher and more balanced carrier mobilities, originating from the stronger π–π stacking and a multi-length scaled phase separation. Besides, the more favourable LUMO energy level of STB-O is beneficial for the promotion of Jsc. By contrast, STB-S:PC71BM blends show a poor morphology with a quite weak crystalline order and large length scale of phase separation, which lead to low carrier mobilities and enhanced bimolecular recombination. Thus, applying the heteroatom effect to design small-molecule materials is important to achieve high-performance organic photovoltaics.
4. Experimental
Materials and general methods
All the reactions dealing with air- or moisture-sensitive compounds were carried out in a dry reaction vessel under a positive pressure of nitrogen. Unless stated otherwise, the starting materials were obtained from Adamas, Aldrich and J&K and were used without any further purification. Anhydrous THF and toluene were distilled over Na/benzophenone prior to use. Anhydrous DMF was distilled over CaH2 prior to use. Hydrogen (1H NMR) and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra were measured with Bruker Fourier 300 or Bruker Avance 400 spectrometers. Chemical shifts of hydrogen are reported in parts per million (ppm, δ scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the residual protons in the NMR solvent (CDCl3: δ 7.26). 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 100 or 75 MHz. Chemical shifts of carbon are reported in parts per million (ppm, δ scale) downfield from tetramethylsilane and are referenced to the carbon resonance of the solvent (CDCl3: δ 77.0). The data are presented as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, m = multiplet and/or multiple resonances, and br = broad), coupling constant in hertz (Hz), and integration. MALDI-TOF measurements were performed on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyzer. Elemental analyses were performed using a Carlo Erba 1106 elemental analyzer. UV-vis spectra were recorded on a JASCO V-570 spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were carried out on a CHI640C analyzer in a conventional three-electrode cell setup with a glassy-carbon electrode as the working electrode, platinum wire as the counter electrode, Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode and calibrated with ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) as an external potential marker in anhydrous acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte under a nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature. All potentials were corrected against Fc/Fc+. The CV was measured at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Shimadzu DTG 60 instrument at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under a N2 atmosphere with runs recorded from room temperature to 550 °C. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the thin films were obtained on a Nanoscope IIIa AFM (Digital Instruments) operating in tapping mode. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed using a JEOL 2200FS instrument at 40 kV accelerating voltage.
General synthetic routes to 3a–3c
To an oven-dried round-bottom flask loaded with compound 1 (0.307 g, 0.30 mmol) in anhydrous DMF (2.5 mL) and toluene (2.5 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere, was added 2-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-iodothieno[3,4-b]thiophene 0 (0.455 g, 0.84 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (40 mg, 0.035 mmol). The reaction was stirred and heated to 90 °C for 2 days in the dark. The reaction mixture was poured into water and extracted three times with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was separated, dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was quickly passed through a silica-gel column and used for the next step without further purification.
Compound 2 (0.170 g, 0.18 mmol) was dissolved in anhydrous THF (12 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere and cooled to −78 °C; then n-butyllithium (1.60 M in hexane, 0.25 mL, 0.4 mmol) was added by using a syringe under stirring. After stirring at −78 °C for 30 min, DMF (100 μL) was added and the mixture was stirred at −78 °C for 30 min.

Fabrication of organic solar cells
Small-molecule solar cell devices were fabricated using ITO-coated glass substrates (15 Ω sq.−1), which were cleaned with de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol in successive 25 min sonication steps applying a final 6 min oxygen plasma treatment to eliminate any remaining organic component. A thin layer (ca. 30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (Bayer Baytron 4083) was first spin-coated on the pre-cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates at 3000 rpm and baked at 150 °C for 15 min under ambient conditions. The substrates were then transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Subsequently, the active layer was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating from a 25 mg mL−1 chloroform solution of STB and PC71BM. Solvent vapor annealing in chloroform for 40 s was used to improve the BHJ morphology. Then, a thin layer of PFN was spin-coated on the active layer at 2000 rpm. At the final stage, the substrates were pumped down in high vacuum, and aluminium (80 nm) was thermally evaporated onto the active layer. The active area of the solar cells was 3.08 mm2 as defined by shadow masks.
Device characterization
The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of unencapsulated photovoltaic devices were measured under N2 using a Keithley 2400 source meter. A 300 W xenon arc solar simulator (Oriel) with an AM 1.5 global filter operated at 100 mW cm−2 was used to simulate the AM 1.5G solar irradiation. The illumination intensity was corrected by using a silicon photodiode with a protective KG5 filter calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured using certified IPCE equipment (Zolix Instruments, Inc, Solar Cell Scan 100).
SCLC mobility measurements
Space charge-limited currents were tested in electron-only devices with a configuration of glass/Al/STB-n:PC71BM/Al and hole-only devices with a configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/STB-n:PC71BM/MoO3/Al. The devices were prepared following the same procedure for photovoltaic devices described in the Experimental section, except for the metal electrode. The mobilities were determined by fitting the dark current to the model of a single carrier SCLC current with field dependent mobility, which is described as: (1)where J is the current, μ0 is the zero-field mobility, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the material, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer.
Microstructure investigation
Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXD) characterization of the thin films was performed at the Advanced Light Source on beamline 7.3.3, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL). Thin film samples were spin-cast on top of the PEDOT:PSS covered Si wafers under exactly the same conditions as those for the fabrication of solar cell devices. The scattering signal was recorded on a 2D detector (Pilatus 2M) with a pixel size of 0.172 mm by 0.172 mm. The beam energy was 10 keV, operating at top-off mode. Typically, 10 s exposure time was used to collect diffraction signals. All GIXD experiments were done in a helium atmosphere. The data were processed and analyzed using Nika software package. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the Advanced Light Source, LBNL. Then BHJ thin films were floated and transferred onto silicon nitride membrane windows. The scattering was done in transmission mode and signals were collected in a vacuum using a Princeton Instrument PI-MTE CCD camera.
