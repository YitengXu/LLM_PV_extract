    , Accepted 11th August 2020First published on 20th August 2020AbstractNon-fullerene acceptors have been utilized to construct efficient organic solar cells (OSCs). In this work, two new acceptors, TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F, with quinoxaline (Qx)-fused rings, were designed and synthesized. The single-junction inverted OSC devices based on two NFAs, blended with PM6 as the polymer donor were systemically investigated. The introduction of fluorine atoms into the Qx-containing fused central framework not only downshifted the energy levels, but also greatly optimized the morphology of PM6:TPQx-6F blend films. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the PM6:TPQx-4F based devices improved from 6.78% to 7.72% through thermal annealing (TA) treatment. Meanwhile, the PM6:TPQx-6F based devices showed a PCE of 12.10%, in which a remarkable PCE of 14.30% was obtained after TA treatment. The different performances of the devices based on PM6:TPQx-4F and PM6:TPQx-6F were mainly attributed to the variation of the short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Further investigations indicated that the PM6:TPQx-6F blend films presented higher mobilities, and more efficient charge dissociation and uniform nanophase separation than those of the TPQx-4F-based devices, leading to higher Jsc and FF. In addition, enhanced Jsc and FF were simultaneously realized by simple TA treatment for the TPQx-4F- and TPQx-6F-based devices. This work provides more insight into the underlying reasons behind fine-tuning the energy levels and optimizing the active layer morphology in high-performance OSCs.
1. Introduction
Non-fullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cells (OSCs) have gained huge attention from the scientific community due to their unique advantages of light weight, low-cost, the diversity of the molecular structure, easy purification, flexibility and semitransparency of devices.1–4 During the past decade, numerous endeavors have been devoted to the development of OSCs, including synthesis of novel electron donating and accepting materials, interface layers, and device engineering.5 Till now, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of NFA based OSCs has broken 17% for single junction and tandem devices,6–9 which is higher than fullerene acceptor based OSCs.10,11 Enormous efforts have been dedicated to investigating acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type NFAs, due to their high charge mobility, good film morphologies etc.12,13 In A–D–A type NFAs, the configuration of the D unit is an electron-rich central framework, such as indacenodithiophene (IDT), indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) and benzodithiophene (BDT) moieties.14–16 For the acceptor units, electron-deficient groups including indanedione and rhodanine can be used.17,18 It is well known that the energy level, absorption coefficient, and morphology can be subtly manipulated by modifying the chemical structures of the D and A units.19–22 Therefore, it is of great importance to rationally design new acceptors to achieve high performance devices.13,23 Among the reported A–D–A type NFAs, the majority of them exhibit weak absorption in the near-infrared (NIR) region, which reduces the utilization of solar energy.24,25 Very recently, Zou et al. designed a new acceptor Y6 (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile), with the absorption onset at 931 nm. Y6 is based on an A–DA′D–A structure, with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (2FIC) as the A unit and electron-deficient fused ring (di-thienothiophen[3.2-b]-pyrrolobenzothiadiazole) as the A′ unit. A breakthrough PCE of 15.7% was achieved in the PM6:Y6 based single-junction OSC device. Since then, a series of high-efficiency acceptors based on electron-deficient fused rings have been reported in a short period of time,26–31 which is paving the way for the further design of A–DA′D–A type NFAs.
As an electron-deficient acceptor unit, quinoxaline (Qx) has been widely used for OSCs,32 with the advantages of easy synthesis, tunable physical properties by substitution optimization, and good planarity to facilitate intermolecular π–π stacking and charge transfer.33–35 As a successful example, the low-cost polymer donor poly[(thiophene)-alt-(6,7-difluoro-2-(2-hexyldecyloxy)quinoxaline)] (PTQ10) was blended with Y6 to reach a high PCE up to 16.53%. It has been reported that thienyl substitution exhibited stronger light-harvesting and more effective charge transfer due to its large charge density and small steric hindrance.36,37 On the other hand, as the smallest electron-withdrawing group, the fluorine atom is usually employed to adjust the electron donating or withdrawing properties of donor and acceptor materials.38,39 Combining with the fluorine atom, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can be effectively reduced.40 The fluorine atom can also improve the planarity of molecules and the intermolecular interaction.41,42 Besides, the charge transfer and collection efficiency can be enhanced through modulation of the active layer morphology by the fluorine atom, leading to enhancement of the device performance.43 However, many reported small molecules contain fluorine on the non-conjugated units in the central core,44,45 and the device performance is generally not higher than OSCs based on conjugated fused rings. Here we tried to introduce fluorine into Qx-fused rings to optimize the performance of OSCs.
Based on previous analysis, in this work, two thienyl Qx-containing fused ring based NFAs with a configuration of A–DA′D–A type, named TPQx-4F (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((13,14-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6,7-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-3,10-diundecyl-13,14-di-hydrothieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-f]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[2,3-h]quinoxaline-2,11-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile) and TPQx-6F (2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((13,14-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-6,7-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)-3,10-di-undecyl-13,14-dihydrothieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-f]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[2,3-h]quinoxaline-2,11-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile), were designed and synthesized, which have ideal molecular orbital energy levels and absorbance ranges. We noted that TPQx-6F is the first NFA Qx-containing fused central core with an F substituent. In this work, we chose PM6 (poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] as the donor material through considerable selection,10 and the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were −5.56 eV and −3.50 eV, respectively. Blended with the donor polymer PM6, OSCs based on TPQx-4F gave a PCE of 6.78%. With introduction of fluorine atoms into thiophene, the PCE of the TPQx-6F based device was boosted up to 12.10%. We observed that thermal annealing (TA) treatment can further improve the efficiency to 7.72% and 14.30% for TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F based devices, respectively. It was revealed that the efficiency enhancement from TPQx-4F to TPQx-6F can be attributed to short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) enhancement, while the morphology and molecular packing were optimized by TA treatment, compared to those of the TPQx-4F-based device. This work provides more insight into the underlying reasons behind fine-tuning the energy levels and optimizing the active layer morphology in high-performance NFAs based OSCs. More importantly, we also proved that the thienyl Qx-containing fused central core is a good alternative building block to construct NFAs for efficient fullerene-free OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 14.30% is among the highest value reported in the literatures to date for thienyl Qx-containing fused central core based NFA OSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and thermal properties
The synthetic routes of TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F are shown in Scheme 1, and detailed data are summarized in the ESI.† Compound 1 was synthesized according to methods in the literature.46 Compound 1 was reduced by Zn and AcOH to receive the corresponding diamine intermediate, and then condensed with dione to obtain compound 2. Red solid compound 3 was synthesized by a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. Then compound 3 and 2FIC were reacted through Knoevenagel condensation to receive TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F. Compounds TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. Both TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F showed good solubility in common organic solvents, such as dichloromethane (DCM), chloroform (CF), chlorobenzene (CB), etc. The thermal properties of TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F were investigated through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). As shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†), the decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) for TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F were 348 °C and 353 °C, respectively, which displayed high thermal stability for TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F.

2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F in chloroform (CF) and films are given in Fig. 1(b). The optical parameters are listed in Table 1. In the CF solution, both TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F showed broad and strong absorption in the range of 300–800 nm; the absorption maxima (λmax) are 748 nm and 740 nm for TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F, respectively. In contrast, λmax of TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F in the film was red-shifted to 813 nm and 805 nm, respectively, indicating the strong intermolecular charge transfer (ICT) and good planarity in the thin solid film.47 PM6 exhibited a good complementary absorption spectrum with TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F. The absorption onset of TPQx-4F was 878 nm, giving the optical bandgap Eoptg as 1.41 eV. With the fluorine substituent on TPQx-6F, the absorption onset was slightly blue-shifted to 867 nm, giving an Eoptg of 1.43 eV. Compared with AQx-1 and AQx-2 prepared by Zhu et al., large blue shifts of TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F were observed in the thin film state. This is due to the larger steric hindrance of the thiophene substituents, which affects the molecular planarity and thus weakens the ICT effect.26

The electrochemical characteristics of TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F were investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) with the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox as an internal reference. Based on the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, the HOMO and LUMO levels of TPQx-4F were estimated to be −5.57 eV and −3.74 eV, while they were −5.61 eV and −3.78 eV for TPQx-6F, respectively. Compared with TPQx-4F, the deeper energy levels of TPQx-6F were mainly resulting from the strong withdrawing electronic effect of the fluorine atoms.48 Furthermore, both TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F exhibited higher LUMO levels than AQx-1 (−3.82 eV) and AQx-2 (−3.88 eV) because of the electron-donating thiophene group.
2.3 Photovoltaic properties
To explore the photovoltaic properties of the PM6:TPQx-4F and PM6:TPQx-6F blend films in devices, inverted devices with the structure of ITO (indium tin oxide)/ZnO/active layers/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. Since the ratio of the donor/acceptor materials has a significant effect on the device performance, we firstly optimized the ratio of the donor/acceptor, where the best performance can be obtained with a ratio of 1:1.2. The devices were measured under illumination with AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, and the corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) curves are shown in Fig. 2(a). The photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2 and more details are provided in Table S1 (ESI†).46 The devices based on PM6:TPQx-4F showed a PCE of 6.78% with a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 13.50 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 52.50%. Compared to TPQx-4F, the PM6:TPQx-6F based devices realized a much higher PCE of 12.10% with a relatively lower Voc of 0.92 V versus 0.95 V, a Jsc of 20.36 mA cm−2versus 13.50 mA cm−2 and a FF of 63.83%, which are in agreement with the lower LUMO energy level of TPQx-6F and the blueshifted absorption compared to TPQx-4F. The devices based on PM6:TPQx-4F and PM6:TPQx-6F both exhibited a relatively high Voc (over 0.92 V). As known, Voc is related to the HOMO energy levels of the donor and LUMO energy levels of the acceptor material.49 Relative to the LUMO energy levels of Y6 (−4.10 eV), TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F both exhibited higher LUMO energy levels, resulting in a higher Voc than that of the Y6-based devices (0.83 V). Moreover, the TPQx-4F-based devices had a higher Voc, attributed to the lower LUMO energy levels compared to TPQx-6F. We further investigated the active layer morphology by TA treatment (as shown in Table S2, ESI†). The optimal photovoltaic properties of the donor/acceptor blend films were achieved by annealing at 100 °C for 5 min. After the TA treatment, the PM6:TPQx-4F blend films showed an increased PCE of 7.72%, with a Voc of 0.94 V, a Jsc of 14.96 mA cm−2 and a FF of 54.41%. The PM6:TPQx-6F based devices presented a quite impressive PCE of 14.30% with a Voc of 0.92 V, a Jsc of 21.83 mA cm−2 and a FF of 70.94%, which is among the best value for OSCs. The Jsc and FF values were simultaneously improved for the devices after TA treatment. Besides, the PM6:TPQx-6F based devices exhibited much higher Jsc and FF, resulting in higher efficiency OSCs.

The wavelength-dependent external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the PM6:TPQx-4F and PM6:TPQx-6F based devices were investigated. According to Fig. 2(b), the PM6:TPQx-6F based devices exhibited a much stronger response than that of the PM6:TPQx-4F based devices, resulting in higher Jsc. In addition, the maximum EQE value of the PM6:TPQx-6F blend films increased from 76.2% to 81.5% after the TA treatment. From the EQE measurements, the calculated Jsc of the PM6:TPQx-4F and PM6:TPQx-6F based devices with TA treatment was 15.05 mA cm−2 and 21.97 mA cm−2, which were in good agreement with the values measured from the J–V curves.
To investigate the exciton dissociation and collection efficiency in the devices, we measured the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves, as shown in Fig. 2(c). As we know, Jph is defined as JL–JD, in which JL and JD are the photocurrent density under light and dark conditions, respectively. Veff follows the formula of V0–Vbias, where V0 is the voltage at Jph = 0 mA cm−2, and Vbias is the bias voltage applied to the device. Generally, Jph will arrive at a saturation value with the increase of Vbias, named the saturation photocurrent density (Jsat), reflecting the efficient dissociation of the photogenerated excitons. The ratio of Jph/Jsat is used to characterize the charge generation and collection properties in the device. As shown in Fig. 2(c), Jph of the PM6:TPQx-4F blend films without/with TA treatment had not reached a saturation value even at a high Veff, suggesting poor charge dissociation in the devices,18 which was the main reason for the low Jsc and FF of the PM6:TPQx-4F based devices. On the contrary, Jsat of the PM6:TPQx-6F blend films soon was reached at a lower Veff. Meanwhile, the Jph/Jsat value of the PM6:TPQx-6F blend films was enhanced from 93.2% to 95.2% by the TA treatment at 100 °C for 5 min. It demonstrates that the TA treatment can facilitate charge generation and collection, therefore leading to higher Jsc and FF.
In order to investigate charge recombination as a loss mechanism for the solar cells, we measured the dependence of Jsc on the light intensity (Plight). The relationship between Jsc and Plight can be expressed as Jsc ∝ Pαlight. Bimolecular recombination can be ignored when α approaches 1. As shown in Fig. 2(d), the α value for the PM6:TPQx-4F based devices without and with TA treatment was 0.947 and 0.943, respectively. The α values were calculated to be 0.919 and 0.977 of the PM6:TPQx-6F based devices without and with TA treatment, respectively. In this work, the TA treatment exhibited a desirable influence on bimolecular recombination in the PM6:TPQx-6F blend films. Moreover, weaker bimolecular recombination is beneficial to the Jsc and FF values of PM6:TPQx-6F based devices.
To explore the charge transport characteristics of the PM6:TPQx-4F and PM6:TPQx-6F blend films, the electron (μe) and hole (μh) mobilities of the optimized single-junction devices were investigated through the space charge limited current (SCLC) method; the J1/2–V curves and details are shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b) and Table 3. The hole-only and electron-only devices were developed with the structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layers/MoO3/Ag and ITO/ZnO/active layers/PDINO/Al, respectively. μh and μe of the PM6:TPQx-4F blend films were calculated to be 4.18 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 2.65 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. These mobilities became 4.53 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 after TA treatment, respectively. The PM6:TPQx-6F blend films exhibited a μh of 6.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe of 4.47 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, where the values showed a little change in μh and μe (4.45 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 4.57 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) after TA treatment compared to the PM6:TPQx-4F blend films. After TA treatment, the enhanced μe/μh values in PM6:TPQx-4F and PM6:TPQx-6F blend films indicates that TA treatment has a positive effect on improving the balance of mobility. On the other hand, better balanced mobility also benefits Jsc and FF of PM6:TPQx-6F blend films.

2.4 Morphological characterization
We further investigated the effects of the active layer morphology on the device performance through atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The AFM and TEM images of the PM6:TPQx-4F and PM6:TPQx-6F blend films with TA treatment are shown in Fig. 4, while those without TA treatment are presented in Fig. S12 (ESI†). As seen in the AFM images, the surface of the PM6:TPQx-4F blend films exhibited a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.11 nm, while the PM6:TPQx-4F blend films presented a more smooth morphology with a lower RMS value of 1.36 nm after TA treatment. Similarly, the RMS value of the PM6:TPQx-6F blend films decreased from 1.10 nm to 0.99 nm after TA at 100 °C for 5 min. The large phase scale were observed in the TEM images of the PM6:TPQx-4F blend films without and with TA treatment, which were negative for exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Meanwhile, the aggregation of the PM6:TPQx-6F blend films was evidently reduced, and the TA treated TPOx-6F films exhibited more homogeneous and uniform nanophase aggregation, giving rise to a better device performance.

3. Conclusion
In summary, two small molecule acceptors of TPQx-4F and TPQx-6F were designed and synthesized for thienyl substituent Qx-containing fused central core based NFA OSCs. The introduction of fluorine atoms into the Qx-containing fused central core showed a vital effect of modulating the molecular energy levels and active layer morphology of the TPQx-6F-based devices. The PM6:TPQx-4F based devices exhibited a relatively low PCE of 6.78% and 7.72% without and with TA treatment, while 12.10% for the PM6:TPQx-6F based as-casted devices. Moreover, the thermally treated devices based on PM6:TPQx-6F exhibited a high PCE of 14.30% due to the further simultaneous improvement of Jsc and FF. It is revealed that the more homogeneous phase separation and higher exciton dissociation efficiency of the fluorinated substitution TPQx-6F are the major origins of the higher device performance compared to the counterpart TPQx-4F. In addition, fluorination and TA treatment exhibited a synergistic effect in modulation of the molecular energy levels and active layer morphology for high efficiency PM6:TPQx-6F based devices. These facts illustrate that the modulation of the molecular energy levels and morphology is of great importance for high efficiency photovoltaic devices.
