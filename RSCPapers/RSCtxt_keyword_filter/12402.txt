    , Accepted 28th October 2016First published on 31st October 2016AbstractA novel, NIR absorbing organic small molecular donor material denoted as ICT3 with an A–D–D–D–A architecture having dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) and butylrhodanine as donor and acceptor moieties, respectively, is synthesized and its thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties are explored. ICT3 has excellent stability over a broad range of temperatures with a decomposition temperature (Td corresponds to 5% weight loss) of 372 °C, soluble in most common organic solvents (solubility up to 30 mg mL−1) and suitable for solution processing during device fabrication. ICT3 has broad (520–820 nm) and intense visible region absorption (molar excitation coefficient is 1.69 × 105 mol−1 cm−1) and has suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels with the [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor for efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer. Bulk heterojunction solar cells (BHJSCs) with an indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/ICT3:PC71BM/poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)fluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl) (PFN)/aluminium (Al) structure are fabricated and the BHJSCs with the active layer as cast from chloroform solution displayed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.04% (JSC = 8.22 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.86 V and FF = 0.43). Annealing the active layer significantly improved the PCE of these BHJSCs. While thermal annealing of the active layer improved the PCE of the BHJSCs to 4.94%, thermal followed by solvent vapour annealing enhanced the PCE to 6.53%. X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy analyses are carried out on the active layer and these results revealed that annealing treatment improves the crystallinity and nanoscale morphology of the active layer, enriches the device exciton generation and dissociation efficiency, charge transport and collection efficiency and reduces carrier recombination. The observed higher PCE (6.53%) of the BHJSCs having ICT3 with a DTP donor moiety broadens the scope to develop new, efficient DTP based small molecular donor materials for BHJSCs.
Introduction
In recent years, organic bulk heterojunction solar cells (OBHJSCs) have attracted great interest as an effective technology for using sunlight to produce electricity. Owing to their advantages such as low cost, lightweight, solution processability and flexibility, OBHJSCs are considered to be alternative to the conventional silicon solar cells.1–3 In general, a bulk heterojunction photoactive layer of OBHJSCs consists of π-conjugated donors (polymers or small molecules) and fullerene acceptors. Broad and efficient light absorption, compatible electronic levels with the fullerene derivatives, efficient charge transport and better thin-film morphology and molecular packing are essential for the donor materials to obtain high power conversion efficiency (PCE).4–8 During the last two decades, numerous efforts have been made in developing new polymer donor materials to enhance the PCE of OBHJSCs and a PCE of over 10% has been achieved.9–13 However, drawbacks like difficulties in reproducibility in synthesis, purification and optimization of electronic properties are still associated with polymeric donor materials. Overcoming these limitations, small molecular donor materials have attained importance over polymer donor materials in terms of their well-defined molecular weights, excellent reproducibility without batch-to-batch variations, high purity and relatively simple purification procedures.4,5 Push–pull organic small molecular donor materials with interconnected electron donating (donor, D) and electron accepting (acceptor, A) moieties can provide broad molecular optical absorption due to intramolecular charge transfer between D and A and assist in the formation of favourable morphologies and suitable molecular orbital energy levels.14–21 By judicious molecular design of donor materials, morphology control and device optimization, a PCE of over 10% has been reported for OBHJSCs with small molecular donor materials.6–8
Short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) are the main device parameters that influence the PCE of OBHJSCs and high PCE values can be achieved by simultaneously improving the magnitudes of JSC, VOC and FF. Generally, JSC of an OBHJSC can be increased by exploiting donor materials with longer wavelength absorption and VOC can be improved by lowering the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor material to reduce the donor–acceptor recombination.22,23 Hence a donor material with low laying HOMO and longer wavelength absorption is advantageous to improve the PCE of an OBHJSC. The optical band gap of push–pull donor materials can be narrowed by selecting the donor moieties with strong electron donating capability to couple with the acceptor moieties. The strong electron donating tendency of the donor moieties can induce efficient electron coupling with acceptors and provide satisfactory long wavelength absorption and high extinction coefficients.24
Recently, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) has been widely explored to develop donor materials for high performance OBHJSCs. It is well established that owing to its excellent planarity, a fused benzene ring with two peripheral thiophene rings of BDT induces strong intra and intermolecular interactions in its thin film state and improves the charge carrier mobility in the bulk heterojunction.7,8,25–28 We have also reported two A–D1–D2–D1–A structured BDT (D2)–dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole (DTP) (D1)–rhodanine (A) conjugates as donor materials for OBHJSCs.29 By optimizing the device fabrication, we have achieved a PCE of 5.90% for the OBHJSCs using the synthesized donor and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor materials.29 Apart from the advantages of BDT, its poor electron donating tendency limits the absorption profiles of the donor materials to the visible region (<750 nm).
DTP, a three-ring fused donor moiety, has considerable planarity and efficient electron donating capability compared to BDT.30 Considerable efforts have been made by the researchers to describe the utility of DTP based small molecules as donor materials for BHJSCs.24,29,31–45 Roncali and coworkers have reported two D–A–D systems using the DTP donor with isoindigo and 3-alkoxy-4-cyanothiophene acceptor units, respectively. BHJSCs fabricated using these donor materials yield moderate efficiencies of, respectively, 0.19% and 0.88%.33,34 Peter Bauerle and coworkers have reported several A–D–A oligomers comprising DTP as the central donor and dicyanovinylene and thieno[2,3-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione units as acceptor moieties. By optimizing various parameters like alkyl side chains and annealing procedures, they have reported PCEs up to 7.1%.36,38,41–43 Recently, Beaujuge and coworkers have reported three DTP–5,6-difluorobenzo-[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTP–[2F]BT) small molecule donors with alkyl substituted thiophene end groups having distinct solubilizing side chain and chain length patterns. By optimizing annealing procedures they have achieved PCEs of up to 6%.44 Based on these interesting findings on DTP based small molecule donor materials and advantages of DTP moieties,30 we anticipated that the synthesis of new donor materials by replacing the BDT central donor of our reported donor materials29 with the DTP donor can result in a better donor material with improved light harvesting ability.
Considering all the above reasons, herewith we report a new small molecular donor material ICT3 with an A–D–D–D–A architecture containing butylrhodanine acceptor (A) and DTP (D) donor moieties, respectively, and its thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties are investigated. ICT3 has good solubility in common organic solvents and has excellent thermal stability. Since DTP has strong electron donating capacity over BDT, ICT3 has a red shifted absorption profile compared to our previously reported BDT based donor materials.29 The broad and intense visible and NIR region absorption and suitable HOMO and LUMO levels of ICT3 with commonly used acceptor PC71BM allows us to explore its photovoltaic properties. BHJSCs are fabricated using ICT3 as donor and PC71BM as acceptor materials. BHJSCs fabricated using ICT3:PC71BM blends processed from chloroform exhibited a PCE of 3.04% (JSC = 8.22 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.86 V and FF = 0.43). Annealing the active layer significantly enhanced the PCE of these BHJSCs. The devices with the active layers processed by thermal annealing (TA) and thermal followed by solvent vapour annealing (TA + SVA) showed a PCE of 4.94% and 6.53%, respectively. The enhancement in PCE of the BHJSCs is attributed to the enhanced light harvesting ability and improved nanoscale morphology of the active layer leading to efficient exciton generation, transport and dissociation at the donor–acceptor interface and balanced charge transport to their respective electrodes. Higher PCE (6.53%) associated with the BHJSCs having ICT3 with the DTP central donor compared to its BDT analogue donor materials29 broadens the scope to develop new, efficient DTP based small molecular donor materials for BHJSCs. Moreover, the observed PCE is one among the best reported for DTP based small molecule donors.
Experimental section
Materials and instruments
All the synthetic precursors were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Butylrhodanine is synthesized as per the reported procedure.29 Dry toluene (dried on sodium wire), dry DMF (dried over molecular sieves) and freshly distilled THF (distilled over sodium/benzophenone) were used in all experiments. NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance (500 MHz) spectrometer. MALDI-MS spectra were recorded on a Thermofinngan Mass Spectrometer. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 5000 UV-VIS-NIR spectrophotometer. Fluorescence experiments were carried out on a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. Cyclic voltammetry measurements were conducted on a PC-controlled CHI 62C electrochemical analyzer in CH2Cl2 solvent at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte. The glassy carbon, standard calomel electrode (SCE) and platinum wire were used as working, reference and counter electrodes, respectively. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. The potential of the reference electrode was calibrated using ferrocene internal standard. All the potentials were reported against ferrocene. TGA and DSC experiments were conducted under an inert atmosphere on Exstar TG/TGA 7200 and Exstar DSC 7020 instruments, respectively, with 10 °C min−1 heating and cooling rates.
Device fabrication and characterization
Small molecule solution processed BHJSCs were fabricated using indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass as an anode electrode and aluminium (Al) as a cathode in the conventional structure of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/ICT3:PC71BM/poly(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PFN)/Al. The ITO coated glass substrates were pre-cleaned sequentially with aqueous detergent, deionised water, acetone and iso-proponal in an ultrasonic bath and finally dried in air. A 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS layer was spin coated from an aqueous solution onto the ITO coated glass substrate at 3500 rpm and then baked at 110 °C for 20 minutes. A blend of ICT3 and PC71BM with different weight ratios was dissolved in a chloroform solution (18 mg mL−1) and then spin coated onto a PEDOT:PSS layer to form an active layer. For the thermal annealing of the active layer, before the deposition of the Al electrode, the layer was annealed at 80 °C for 10 minutes. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were placed in glass Petri dish containing 100 μL THF for 1 minute for solvent vapour annealing (SVA). A PFN cathode buffer layer was prepared directly by spin coating the PFN in methanol solution on the top of the active layer, without any additional thermal annealing or post treatment. Finally, 90 nm of Al was deposited by thermal evaporation at high vacuum of 10−5 Torr on the top of the active layer to complete the device. For the hole-only devices, the diode was fabricated with a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au configuration using a process similar to that used for the photovoltaic cells described above. Only the top electrode (Au, 90 nm) was vacuum-deposited on the active layer (10−5 Torr). The electron-only devices were fabricated with an Al/active layer/Al structure. The current–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaics were measured using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 source meter at an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. A solar simulator consisting of a xenon light source coupled with an AM 1.5 optical filter was used as the light source to illuminate the surface of the devices. The incident photons to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements were performed at zero bias by illuminating the device with monochromatic light supplied from a Xenon arc lamp in combination with a monochromator. The number of photons incident on the sample was calculated for each wavelength by using a silicon photodiode. The resulting current was measured using a Keithley electrometer under short circuit conditions. The J–V characteristics of the hole only and electron only devices were measured in the range of 0–3 V using a Keithley 2400 source measuring unit in the dark. The carrier mobility was calculated by fitting the J–V curves to a space charge limited current (SCLC) model.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and thermal properties
The chemical structure of ICT3 is shown in Scheme 1. The donor material ICT3 has an A–D–D–D–A architecture and contains DTP and butylrhodanine as donor and acceptor moieties, respectively. The synthetic scheme of ICT3 is shown in Scheme 1 and its detailed synthetic procedures are provided in the experimental section. The reported ICT3 was synthesized by condensing the bis-aldehyde intermediate 6 with butylrhodanine. The bis-aldehyde intermediate 6 was obtained from the corresponding distannyl derivative 3 and 5. Intermediate 3 was synthesized by lithiation of 2 using n-BuLi followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride. Intermediate 2 was prepared by Pd0-catalyzed Buchwald–Hartwig coupling of 1 with 2-ethylhexylamine. Intermediate 5 was synthesized from 2, by subjecting it to formylation using POCl3/DMF followed by bromination with NBS. All the intermediates and the donor molecule ICT3 are thoroughly characterised (Fig. S1–S3, and S8–S26, ESI†). ICT3 is soluble in common organic solvents and suitable for solution processability during device fabrication.

Thermal properties and phase transition characteristics of ICT3 were evaluated using thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively, under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. TGA and DSC thermograms of ICT3 are shown in Fig. 1 and the corresponding data are provided in Table 1. From the TGA analysis, it is clear that ICT3 has good thermal stability with the decomposition temperature (Td, defined as that at which 5 wt% loss is observed) of 372 °C (Fig. 1a). During the DSC analysis, ICT3 exhibits a sharp endotherm corresponding to its melting temperature (Tm) of 278 °C (Fig. 1b). High Td and Tm observed for ICT3 designate its applicability even at elevated temperatures. Moreover, in the DSC analysis, multiple crystallization exotherms are observed during the first cooling cycle supporting the highly crystalline nature of ICT3 and it could be due to the strong intermolecular interactions among the ICT3 molecules induced by the flat DTP donor moiety.49

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The UV-Visible absorption characteristics of ICT3 were measured both in solution and thin film states. Fig. 2a shows the UV-Visible absorption spectra of ICT3 and the corresponding data are provided in Table 2. In chloroform solution, ICT3 displays absorption bands in two distinct regions, i.e. 300–500 nm and 500–750 nm. The absorption band at longer wavelength has the absorption maximum (λmax) at 630 nm with an extinction coefficient (ε) of 1.69 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (Fig. 2a and Table 2). The observed high ε is attributed to the planarity of the molecular backbone of ICT3. Compared to the ter(DTP) donor core alone reported by Roncali and coworkers, the absorption band of ICT3 is red shifted by ∼166 nm (Table 2), indicating intramolecular charge transfer among the DTP donor and rhodanine acceptor units.50 Moreover, the broad and red shifted absorption of ICT3 compared to its BDT analogue materials (Fig. S4, ESI†) supports the efficient electron donating tendency of DTP compared to the BDT unit. It can be seen that absorption bands of ICT3 in the thin film state are red shifted about 40 nm with a new vibronic shoulder peak at longer wavelength regions (Fig. 2a), indicating the strong intermolecular interactions due to π-stacking and effective intermolecular packing between the molecular backbones.51–53 These intermolecular interactions are beneficial for efficient charge transport. The optical band gap of ICT3 calculated from the absorption onset of the thin film is estimated to be 1.56 eV and it falls in the optimal range (1.5–1.6 eV) to obtain the best PCE.54 Moreover, the broad and NIR (510–830 nm) light harvesting capacity of ICT3 compared to its BDT analogues can improve the exciton generation efficiency and short circuit current density (JSC) of the corresponding BHJSCs.

Absorption spectra of the ICT3:PC71BM blend film processed from chloroform solvent under different conditions are shown in Fig. 2b. Absorption spectra of the ICT3:PC71BM blend film as cast from chloroform solvent comprised two characteristic bands, one at shorter wavelength corresponding to PC71BM and another at longer wavelength corresponding to ICT3. However, compared to the pristine films (Fig. 2a), the absorption band corresponding to ICT3 in their blend film is considerably blue shifted with the disappearance of the vibronic peak shoulder indicating the strong interaction between the ICT3 and PC71BM that disrupts the intermolecular packing of ICT3 molecules. Annealing (TA or TA + SVA) the blend film broadened and red shifted the absorption band corresponding to ICT3 with a new vibronic shoulder as observed in their pristine films revealing that annealing treatment improves the molecular packing of ICT3 in their blend films.
Redox properties of ICT3 were studied using cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis to estimate its HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital) energy levels. The cyclic voltammogram of ICT3 is shown in Fig. 3 and it shows two quasi-reversible one-electron oxidation waves with onset oxidation potentials of 0.06 and 0.40 V vs. Fc/Fc+ (0.36 and 0.70 V vs. SCE) corresponding to cation radical and dicationic states of ICT3, respectively. Obtained oxidation peak potential values (0.43 and 0.81 V vs. SCE) are comparable with ter(DTP) (0.34 and 0.71 V vs. SCE) reported by Roncali and coworkers.50 The HOMO energy level of ICT3 was calculated from the onset oxidation potential by assuming the energy level of Fc/Fc+ to be −5.1 eV below the vacuum level. The LUMO energy level of ICT3 was estimated from ELUMO = EHOMO − E0–0, where E0–0 was obtained from the intersection of solution state absorption and emission spectra (Fig. S5, ESI†). The HOMO and LUMO energy level values of ICT3 are provided in Table 2. The higher magnitude of the HOMO energy of ICT3 compared to its BDT analogues reported also supports the higher electron donating capacity of the DTP moiety over the BDT unit (Fig. S4, ESI†). Since the open-circuit voltage of a BHJSC depends on the energy difference between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor material, an observed increase in the HOMO of ICT3 compared to its BDT analogues can reduce the VOC of BHJSC devices. However, well aligned HOMO and LUMO energy levels of ICT3 with the HOMO (−6.0 eV) and LUMO (−4.1 eV) levels of PC71BM designate its suitability as a donor material in BHJSCs when blended with the PC71BM acceptor. Since the energy gap of the donor–acceptor LUMO levels has a prominent role in the exciton dissociation, the observed 0.71 eV higher magnitude of the LUMO of ICT3 over PC71BM can afford effective photo-induced charge separation at the D/A interface.55

Theoretical studies
Theoretical calculations were performed to understand the molecular level properties of ICT3 using density functional theory (DFT) and time dependant density functional theory (TD-DFT). The ground state geometry of ICT3 was fully relaxed in the gas phase without any symmetry constraints during relaxation. Geometry optimization was performed using B3LYP, a hybrid exchange–correlation functional along with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.56–61 Frequency analysis was carried out to confirm that the relaxed geometries are the local minima on the potential energy surface. The relaxation process was done according to the default tight convergence criteria implemented in the G09 package. Long alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups for computational ease. The vertical excitation energy of ICT3 was estimated for the first 25 states using the TD-DFT method using PBE, B3LYP and M06 functionals and 6-31G(d,p) basis set over the ground state optimized geometry.56–58,62,63 Solvent effects were also included for chloroform (CF) solvent using the integral equation formalism variant of the polarisable continuum model (IEFPCM) as implemented in the Gaussian package.64,65 Molecular orbital analysis was performed on ICT3 to estimate the electron density distribution over different fragments in various MOs. The Gausssum package was used to estimate the percentage contribution of various fragments to the corresponding FMOs.66 All these calculations were performed using the G09 software package.
As shown in Fig. S6, ESI,† the optimized structure of ICT3 is almost planar and the dihedral angle between the central DTP molecular plane and the peripheral DTP molecular plane of ICT3 is in the range of 8.34–14.67°. This high planarity of ICT3 assists in the formation of intermolecular aggregates and it could be the reason for the observed wavelength shift and new vibronic bands in the thin film absorption spectrum of ICT3 (Fig. 2a).
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels and allowed vertical electronic excitations of ICT3 were calculated using M06, B3LYP and PBE functionals and the results obtained are provided in Tables S1–S3, ESI.† From these results it is clear that HOMO → LUMO transition has predominant contribution to the first excitation. Optimized structures and isosurface plots of the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs) of ICT3 are shown in Fig. 4. It is clear from Fig. 4 that the HOMO and LUMO of ICT3 are extended all over the molecular backbone. However, the HOMO is more localized on central and peripheral DTP donor moieties and the LUMO is predominant on peripheral DTP and butylrhodanine moieties. The results obtained from the Gausssum package revealing the contributions of different moieties of ICT3 to its FMOs are shown in Fig. S7, ESI.† Since HOMO → LUMO transition is mainly contributed to the first excited state, moderate charge transfer from the central and peripheral DTP donor moieties to the butylrhodanine acceptor moiety is observed. UV-Visible absorption spectra of ICT3 obtained using TD-DFT analysis (M06/6-31G(d,p) and B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)) in gas and chloroform solvent phases are shown in Fig. S8, ESI.† These absorption spectra were acquired by convoluting Gaussian functions with FWHM of 3000 cm−1 using the Gausssum package. The absorption spectra generated from the gas phase studies are in good agreement with the experimental results. However, the absorption maxima of ICT3 obtained from TD-DFT calculations in the chloroform solvent phase are slightly overestimated.

Photovoltaic properties
In order to evaluate the photovoltaic properties of ICT3, bulk heterojunction solar cells were fabricated using ICT3 as donor and PC71BM as acceptor materials with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ICT3:PC71BM/PFN/Al. Initially, BHJSCs were optimized by fabricating the devices with various D/A weight ratios of 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2 and 1:2.5 in chloroform solution keeping the total concentration as 18 mg mL−1. We found that devices based on ICT3:PC71BM (1:2 wt ratio) show best photovoltaic performance and all the further studies were carried out using a 1:2 D/A weight ratio. Current–voltage characteristics and incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices with an optimized ICT3:PC71BM active layer are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 3. The device fabricated from the active layer processed with chloroform solution showed a PCE of 3.04% with a JSC of 8.22 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.86 V and a FF of 0.43. The IPCE spectra consist of two bands (Fig. 5b) and closely resemble the absorption spectra of the active layer. The band at shorter and longer wavelength regions corresponds to the absorption of PC71BM and ICT3, respectively, indicating that both PC71BM and ICT3 contribute to the photocurrent generation. The overall PCE of the solar cell based on ICT3:PC71BM processed with chloroform is quite low and it could be due to the poor JSC and FF associated with these devices. Since thermal annealing (TA)7,67,68 and solvent vapour annealing (SVA)69–71 can improve the morphology of the active layer and thereby enhance the PCE of the device, we have fabricated BHJSCs based on the thermal annealed (TA) and thermal followed by solvent vapour annealed (TA + SVA) active layers. Current–voltage characteristics and IPCE spectra of these devices are also included in Fig. 5. The BHJSCs with the active layer treated with TA exhibited a better PCE of 4.94% with a JSC of 10.38 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.82 V and a FF of 0.58. With simultaneous TA and SVA treatment of the active layer, PCE is further increased to 6.53% with a JSC of 11.94 mA cm−2, a VOC of 0.84 V and a FF of 0.65 (Table 3). BHJSC devices with the ICT3 donor displayed higher JSC and FF and lower VOC values compared to the BHJSCs with its BDT analogue donor materials (Fig. S4, ESI†). These results are in agreement with the photophysical and electrochemical data obtained for ICT3. Since ICT3 has broad and red shifted optical absorption compared to its BDT analogues, higher exciton generation is expected and that in turn could improve the JSC of the devices. An observed decrease in the VOC values of the BHJSCs with the ICT3 donor could be due to its higher magnitude HOMO level compared to its BDT analogues. However the overall PCE of the BHJSCs with ICT3 donor is higher compared to that of the BHJSCs with its BDT analogue donor materials (Fig. S4, ESI†). Hence it is clear that replacing BDT with DTP can result in the donor materials with better photovoltaic properties.

In order to get insights into the increase in PCE of the BHJSCs with an annealed active layer, we have measured the hole and electron mobilities in the active layers by measuring the J–V characteristics of the hole and electron only devices and fitting these characteristics with space charge limited current described by the Mott–Gurney model.72 The J–V characteristics of the hole and electron only devices are shown in Fig. 6a and b, respectively. The device with an active layer spin cast from chloroform solvent exhibited hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobilities of 2.64 × 10−5 and 2.48 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with the electron to hole mobility ratio (μe/μh) of 9.34 leading to the unbalanced charge transport, which could be the reason for the observed low PCE (3.04%) of the BHJSCs with as cast active layer. Interestingly, annealing treatment on the active layer substantially improved the hole mobility of the devices. Devices with TA treated active layers displayed μh and μe of 9.54 × 10−5 and 2.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, with μe/μh = 2.55. Devices with TA + SVA treated active layers showed further enhancement in μh and the observed μh and μe are 1.76 × 10−4 and 2.54 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and μe/μh is 1.44. Hence these results clearly indicate that annealing treatment imparts balanced charge transport in the active layer and in turn reduces the charge recombination and leads to an increase in FF, JSC, and overall PCE of the BHJSCs.
 Fig. 6  Current–voltage characteristics in the dark for hole (a) and electron (b) only devices, solid lines indicate SCLC fitting. 
We have also measured the photocurrent density (Jph) and effective voltage (Veff) characteristics of the BHJSCs with the ICT3:PC71BM active layer processed under different conditions and the data are shown in Fig. 7. As shown in Fig. 7, Jph (Jph = JL–JD, where JL and JD are the current densities under illumination and in the dark, respectively) of the BHJSCs is increased sharply with Veff (Veff = Vo − Vappl, where Vappl is the applied voltage and Vo is the voltage at which Jph = 0)73 and reached a saturated value (Jphsat) at higher Veff. However, the increase in the Jph with respective to Veff is sharp for the BHJSCs with TA or TA + SVA treated active layers and reached Jphsat at a low value of Veff compared to the BHJSCs with as cast active layers. These results suggested that for the BHJSCs with either TA and TA + SVA treated active layers, both the exciton generation, their dissociation into free charge carriers and charge collection at the respective electrodes are more efficient compared to the BHJSCs with as cast active layers. Since Jphsat is correlated with the maximum exciton generation rate, which is a measure of the maximum number of photons absorbed,74,75 higher Jphsat observed for the BHJSCs with TA + SVA treated active layers indicates the higher light harvesting capacity of these devices. These results are also consistent with the UV-Visible absorption of the active layers (Fig. 2b). Moreover, we observed a significant enhancement in the Jph/Jphsat ratio under short circuit conditions for the BHJSCs with annealing treated active layers (0.84 and 0.89, respectively, for TA and TA + SVA treated active layers) over the BHJSCs with as cast active layers (0.72). Since the Jph/Jphsat ratio is related to the overall exciton dissociation and charge collection efficiencies, the observed higher magnitudes of the Jph/Jphsat values for the BHJSCs with annealing treated active layers indicate their improved charge collection efficiency.76 Hence the results of the hole/electron mobility experiments and Jph − Veff characteristics collectively suggested that TA + SVA treatment of active layers improves the exciton generation and dissociation efficiency, charge transport and collection efficiency and reduces the carrier recombination of the BHJSCs.

Since the annealing treatment substantially altered the absorption (Fig. 2b) and charge transport characteristics (Fig. 6 and 7) of the active layer, we expected that the observed significant enhancement in the PCEs of the BHJSCs with TA or TA + SVA treated active layers could be due to better nanoscale morphology of the active layer induced by annealing treatment. To ascertain this, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses were performed. XRD patterns of the active layer blend thin films processed under different conditions are provided in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 8, ICT3:PC71BM blend thin films as cast from chloroform solvent displayed a strong (100) reflection peak at approximately around 2θ = 5.08°, corresponding to a d100 spacing of 17.38 Å. The peak at small angle suggests that the d100 spacing is between the side chains rather than π–π stacking and indicates that the molecular packing is dominated by the alkyl side chains of ICT3.21 TA or TA + SVA treatment of the active layer appreciably altered the XRD pattern of the blend thin films and we observed significant enhancement in the reflection intensity of the diffraction peak, indicating that TA or TA + SVA treatment improves the degree of crystallinity of the active layer. Enhanced crystallinity is beneficial for the carrier transport and collection and reduced charge recombination, resulting in an improvement in JSC of the resulting device. AFM images of the ICT3:PC71BM blend thin film are shown in Fig. 9. As cast ICT3:PC71BM blend thin films showed an uniform surface morphology with a surface roughness root mean square (RMS) value of 0.74 nm, indicating that the observed nanoscale morphology is not sufficient for efficient exciton dissociation due to the reduced D–A interface area. Also these smaller domains can hinder the charge transport due to insufficient interpenetrating pathways, increase the charge carrier recombination and lead to poor JSC and FF values. However, with TA + SVA treatment, the RMS value of ICT3:PC71BM blend thin films is increased to 1.26 nm, indicating more ordered packing in the active layer.67,77 The increase in the RMS value may lead to better phase separation and appropriate domain size of donor and acceptor molecules in the active layer, which is beneficial for exciton dissociation and charge transport, and it could be the reason for the improvement in the overall PCE of the BHJSCs.78 Hence all these experiments collectively demonstrate that TA + SVA treatment of active layers induces crystallinity and better nanoscale morphology to the active layer and improves the device exciton generation and dissociation efficiency, charge transport and collection efficiency and reduces carrier recombination.

Conclusion
In summary, we have synthesized a novel low band gap organic small molecular donor material, ICT3, with an A–D–D–D–A architecture using DTP and butylrhodanine as donor and acceptor moieties. Thermal, photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of ICT3 are explored. ICT3 is stable over a broad range of temperatures, suitable for solution processing during device fabrication and it has suitable HOMO and LUMO energy levels compared to the PC71BM acceptor. BHJSCs are fabricated using ICT3 as donor and PC71BM as acceptor materials and devices with the active layer as cast from chloroform solvent displayed a PCE of 3.04%. Annealing treatment of the active layer significantly improved the PCE of the BHJSCs. BHJSCs with TA treated active layers exhibited a PCE of 4.94% and it is 6.53% for the BHJSCs with TA + SVA treated active layers. XRD and AFM analyses on the active layer revealed that annealing treatment improves the crystallinity and nanoscale morphology of the active layer, enriches the device exciton generation and dissociation efficiency, charge transport and collection efficiency and reduces carrier recombination. The observed higher PCE (6.53%) associated with the BHJSCs having ICT3 with the DTP donor moiety broadens the scope to develop new, efficient DTP based small molecular donor materials for BHJSCs.
