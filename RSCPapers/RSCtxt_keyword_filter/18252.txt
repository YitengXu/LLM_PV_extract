It improves charge transport and moisture stability giving out a champion power conversion efficiency of 16.69% for an excellent inorganic perovskite solar cell.
Research studies toward organic–inorganic halide perovskite (OIHP) solar cells have increased dramatically due to their incredible power conversion efficiency (PCE) arising from efficient charge carrier transport, long carrier diffusion length and high optical absorption.1–4 Nowadays, the demand for stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) under continuous photothermal conditions has turned the attention towards exploring the attractive inorganic cesium lead iodide (CsPbI3) perovskite solar cell systems.5–9 However, similar to OIHP, inorganic perovskite CsPbI3 also faces the problems of crystallographic defects at the crystal surface and grain boundaries.10,11 These deficiencies would lead to charge recombination and structure decomposition that impair the photovoltaic (PV) performance. Until now, various strategies have been explored for the development of inorganic PSCs, such as PbS quantum dots,12 choline iodine,13 phenethylammonium,14 and phenyltrimethylammonium halide.15 Nevertheless, the performances of these inorganic CsPbI3 based devices are still not a patch on OIHP solar cells. Meanwhile, another intrinsic problem that hinders the application of inorganic perovskite materials CsPbX3 is their bandgaps ranging from 1.73 eV for α-CsPbI3 to 2.3 eV for CsPbBr3.16–18 Recently, Zhao et al. have developed a DMAI additive method opening a new way for the preparation of uncommon tetragonal β-CsPbI3 perovskite at a lower temperature of 210 °C. This reveals that tetragonal β-CsPbI3 exhibits a favorable bandgap of 1.68 eV for PSCs.19 And the PCE of β-CsPbI3 based solar cells has been found to reach up to 19% with high stability and reproducibility. These fascinating findings attract new research and development toward the construction of photoelectric devices based on β-CsPbI3, due to the urgent need for all inorganic perovskite solar cells with high photo-thermal stability.
Herein, we report the preparation of a stable β-CsPbI3 perovskite passivated by conjugated 2,3-naphthalenediammonium (2,3-NDAx+) cations, showing a high PCE of 16.69% and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.08 V for an excellent anti-deliquescence inorganic perovskite solar cell. In view of the fact that multiple-ring aromatic compounds haven’t been explored in all-inorganic PSCs systems, the cis-isomerism 2,3-NDAx+ cation with two ammonium groups has been investigated as the β-CsPbI3 passivator here. On comparison with the insulating aliphatic or single-ring aromatic cations, the π-electron delocalized multiple-ring aromatic molecules not only can passivate the uncoordinated ions for stabilizing the perovskite layer, but can also be expected to enhance charge transport, thus improving the PCE performance of photovoltaic devices. Furthermore, paving cis-isomerism 2,3-NDAx+ as a capping layer on the CsPbI3 film also contributes to improving its water-repellent effect. Finally, the fabricated β-CsPbI3-based devices without further complicated encapsulation exhibit a long-term stability when the constructed devices are stored in dry air for more than one month.
Distorted black phase β-CsPbI3 was fabricated by spin-coating CsPbI3 precursor solution containing a stoichiometric mixture of CsI + PbI2 + 1.2 DMAI in DMF solvent, followed by annealing at 210 °C for 5 min in a dry box. The bifunctional organic compound 2,3-NDAIx was spin-coated onto the deposited perovskite surface. Scheme 1 illustrates β-CsPbI3 preparation and post-synthetic treatment, where the optimal concentration of NDAIx IPA solution is 1.0 mg mL−1. After the post-treatment with 2,3-NDAIx, the perovskite film is labeled as (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3. As is well-known, organic molecules usually bind the crystal surface as surface capped organic cations on the top of pervoskites.14 While even a small alkyl ammonium cation is not able to be incorporated into the CsPbI3 crystal during the ammonium salt treatment,20 NDAIx cations can only locate on the surface of the β-CsPbI3 crystal due to their bigger configuration. The iodide anions from them can be used to passivate the iodide defects in the polycrystalline perovskite.21

The XRD pattern (Fig. 1a) of the black CsPbI3 thin film shows characteristic (110) and (220) diffraction peaks at 14.2° and 28.6° for the tetragonal β-CsPbI3 crystal.19 There is no distinct difference between pristine β-CsPbI3 and NDAIx post-treated β-CsPbI3 samples observed from the XRD data. This suggests that NDAIx treatment would not affect the overall crystallinity and phase purity of the β-CsPbI3 films. The absorbance edge of the CsPbI3 film is observed at ∼733 nm in its UV-vis spectra (Fig. 1b), which is consistent with the previous report for the β-CsPbI3 film.19

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) have been measured to investigate the chemical interactions between NDAx+ cations and β-CsPbI3. As shown in Fig. 1c, no organic molecular signal is detected in the FTIR spectrum of pristine β-CsPbI3 except for the typical absorption bands at 3456 cm−1 observed for the absorbed H2O. The IR spectrum of 2,3-NDAIx shows absorption peaks at 890 cm−1, 825 cm−1 and 771 cm−1 that can be assigned to N–H scissor bending in NDAIx.22 After the spin-coating of 2,3-NDAIx onto the perovskite layer, the characteristic N–H scissor bending peaks are shifted to 872 cm−1, 808 cm−1 and 753 cm−1. Such red shifts of ∼15 cm−1 indicate an interaction effect between the –NH3+ groups and the β-CsPbI3 layer.23
XPS spectra were collected to further investigate the chemical composition of 2,3-NDAIx powder and (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 perovskite thin layer. N1s peaks and the corresponding fitting results are shown in Fig. 1d, and the binding energies of 401.3 eV and 398.97 eV (N1s) are referred to as –NH3+ and –NH2 of 2,3-NDAIx, respectively. In contrast to 2,3-NDAIx powder, the core levels of N1s for (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 are shifted to 400.68 eV and 398.53 eV, indicating strong chemical bond formation between NDAx+ cations and [PbI6]4− octahedra. In addition, I3d peaks (Fig. S1, ESI†) of (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 are observed to be shifted from 630.1 eV and 618.7 eV to 629.6 eV and 618.2 eV in comparison with that of 2,3-NDAIx. The changes indicate the formation of chemical bonds between the iodides of 2,3-NDAIx and CsPbI3 perovskite layer. These results prove that 2,3-NDAIx is an excellent passivator for inorganic perovskite films.
As listed in Table S2 (ESI†), the atomic ratios of Cs, Pb and I of perovskite films are investigated using XPS measurements. For the pristine β-CsPbI3 film, its I/Pb ratio of 2.73 is lower than that of the calculated ratio of 3 according to the chemical formula, indicating vacancies of I on the perovskite surface. By comparison, the I/Pb ratio of the fabricated (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 thin film is observed to be increased to 4.12. This proves that adding iodide ions from NDAIx cations contributes to suppressing the I vacancies, thus improving the stability of perovskite and PCE performance of PSCs. As is well-known, the stability of the polycrystalline perovskite in the ambient atmosphere is challenged by chemical reactions of the defect sites initialized at the crystal surface and grain boundaries.13 Unfortunately, black β-CsPbI3 perovskite is also easily converted into unfavorable photovoltaic δ-phase (Fig. S2, ESI†) especially in a humid atmosphere.18 In the designed structure of passivator, the introduction of hydrophobic naphthalene rings into NDAIx cations aims to protect the water-sensitive β-CsPbI3 layer due to their strong moisture-repelling effect evidenced by water contact measurement. A larger water contact angle of 108.1° for the (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 thin film is observed in contrast to that of 88.8° for the bare perovskite film (Fig. 2).

The moisture stability of the pristine β-CsPbI3 and 2,3-NDAIx modified β-CsPbI3 film have also been measured by exposing them in air with a 50 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) at 19 °C. For the pristine β-CsPbI3 films, a visible color change from black to yellow can be observed when they were stored in the humid air for only 90 min (Fig. 3a). This can be attributed to the phase transition from β-CsPbI3 to δ-CsPbI3.13 The emergence of the δ-CsPbI3 characteristic peaks at 9.93° in the XRD data indicates that a phase transition from β- to δ-phase takes place in this process. By comparison, the β-CsPbI3 film modified using 2,3-NDAIx with cis-ammonium arrangement is fairly stable in such humid environment. It retains black color and shows no impurities before and after exposure in the same humid air for 90 min (Fig. 3b) as proved using the XRD data. Intriguingly, the (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 film also can retain the β-phase for more than three months in a glove box (Fig. S3, ESI†). Such improved stability can be attributed to highly efficient passivation by the surface passivator cis-isomerism 2,3-NDAx+ with two ammonium groups anchoring on the perovskite layer. They can occupy Cs+ vacancies at the β-CsPbI3 crystal surface and grain boundaries, prohibiting the corrosion of the perovskite structure.14,24 In addition, the formation of an edge-on hydrophobic naphthalene layer on the surface of the perovskite improves the water repelling ability of the β-CsPbI3 film.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the pristine β-CsPbI3 film exhibits a uniform and compact thin layer (Fig. 3c). However, some cracks were observed on the film surface, which would cause a negative impact on the performance of perovskite.13 This problem can be solved by post-treating the film with NDAIx IPA solution, forming a crack free morphology (Fig. 3d). The deposited (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 thin films are found to be compact with a high surface coverage with average grain sizes of about 530 nm (Fig. S4, ESI†). Such submicrometer-sized grains as well as ∼450 nm film thickness (Fig. S5, ESI†) enable efficient charge extraction and transfer for PSCs.25,26
Planar PSCs are fabricated with a configuration of glass/FTO/c-TiO2/β-CsPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag, in which the thickness of perovskite is approximately 450 nm. Relevant current–voltage (J–V) curves of the champion PSCs are shown in Fig. 4a. The pristine β-CsPbI3 based champion device has only achieved about 12% PCE due its low Voc (1.0 V) and fill factor (FF) (70%) stemming from the defects in the perovskite layer. After spin-coating the surface capped organic molecule 2,3-NDAIx, the PCE performance of the (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 based devices is significantly enhanced to 16.69% with a Jsc of 19.34 mA cm−2, a Voc of 1.08 V and a FF of 80%. The current density of the devices can be improved by reducing the ionic defects in the (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 perovskite films, which is mainly attributed to the enhanced charge collection efficiency. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) performance (Fig. 4b) of the (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 based device exhibits a better photo-response than that of control β-CsPbI3 devices in a wide range from 400 nm to 700 nm. These results affirm the good passivation effect with interactions between the conjugated molecule and perovskite. The integrated current densities from the EQE spectra with the AM1.5G solar spectra give the same trend compared with the J–V measurement. For the solution concentration of the passivator, 2,3-NDAIx from 0.5 mg mL−1 to 2.0 mg mL−1 all show higher PV performances than pristine CsPbI3 based devices (Fig. S6 and Table S3, ESI†), for suppressing the vacancies and defects at the crystallite surface.27 The optimal concentration of passivation is 1.0 mg mL−1. The performances of the PSCs decreased slightly when higher 2,3-NDAIx concentrations (2.0 mg mL−1) were applied. The device performances of the as-prepared PSCs also have good reproducibility. As described in Fig. S6b and d (ESI†), the (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3-based devices show excellent average performance with a striking improvement of Voc and PCE, which can be attributed to the I doping and ammonium passivation effect by the 2,3-NDAIx additive. A fatigue test is carried out with the unencapsulated devices stored in a dry box with <20% RH at room temperature. As shown in Fig. 4c, the PCE of the control β-CsPbI3 device decreases by more than 50% of its initial value within 20 days, while the (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3 based device still maintains about 90% of its fresh PCE. The stability of PSCs is proved to be significantly improved by the 2,3-NDAIx post-treatment. Furthermore, the (2,3-NDAIx)CsPbI3-based best device is held under a bias of 0.91 V to monitor the photocurrent density reaching 17.7 mA.cm−2, giving a stable ∼16.1% PCE output (Fig. 4d).

In conclusion, β-CsPbI3 perovskite stability is enhanced via efficient chemical passivation by the 2,3-NDAx+ cations with cis-arranging ammoniums anchoring the molecular structure. Strong passivation effect of the ammonium groups is verified using the IR and XPS measurements. The presence of conjugated naphthalene hydrophobic rings largely improves the humid stability of the β-CsPbI3 perovskite film. This approach provides highly reproducible inorganic PSCs with a champion stabilized efficiency of 16.69% and Voc of 1.08 V. The unencapsulated decoration devices also exhibit a long-term stability in dry air, retaining over 90% of their initial PCE at least for one month. This strategy shows that multiple anchoring arrangement and suitable hydrophobic capped structure benefit the fabrication of thermodynamically stable β-CsPbI3. This would be a promising route for the construction of photovoltaic and other optoelectronic devices with high photo-thermal stability.
