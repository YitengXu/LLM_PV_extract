    , Accepted 28th April 2011First published on 15th June 2011AbstractA new platinum acetylide complex, (3-(4-(diphenylamino)phenylethynyl))(3-(4-(2-carboxyl-2-cyanovinyl)phenylethynyl))(bis(triethylphosphine))platinum (Pts), has been designed and synthesized as a sensitizer for application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The absorption spectra, electrochemistry, impedance spectroscopy and photovoltaic properties of this platinum acetylide complex have been extensively investigated. For the best DSSC, the overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency of 3.28% was achieved with a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 6.77 mA cm−2 and the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) of 0.70 V(fill factor ff = 0.69).
1. Introduction
In the 21st century, fossil fuel based energy has to be replaced by new energy systems by incorporating novel technologies derived from advancements in science. Renewables are the perspective for future energy needs and the key to sustainable development. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) cells, capable of directly converting sunlight into electrical power, are one of the most promising devices in the search for sustainable and renewable sources of clean energy. Two types of PEC cell are presently being investigated. In one system, an n- or p-type semiconductor electrode is used as a photoanode or photocathode, respectively. In the alternative system, dye-coated mesoscopic oxide semiconductors are employed in the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs or Grätzel cells).
DSSCs have attracted intensive interest for their highly efficient performance in converting solar energy-to-electricity at low cost.1–4 In DSSCs, dye molecules anchored to the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 absorb visible light and then inject an electron into the conduction band of the TiO2 in their excited states. Recently, the synthesis of transition-metal dye molecules as DSSCs sensitizers has received much attention. Especially the photo-sensitizers based on Ru-complexes such as the black dye show recorded solar energy-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 11.18%.5–8 Other metal complexes based dyes have also been investigated, including the complexes of Fe,9,10 Os,11,12Cu13,14 and Re.15 Earlier the utility of platinum (Pt) complexes as dye sensitizers in DSSCs had been reported with the lower efficiency.16–18
Most of the above metal complex sensitizers,9–18 referring to the structure of ruthenium complex sensitizers, only employ bipyridine or similar structure as ligands. This greatly limits the development for metal complex sensitizers used in DSSCs. In the past decades, platinum-acetylide compounds have been extensively explored in supramolecular chemistry and materials sciences. By taking advantage of the linear geometry of the alkynyl unit and its π-unsaturated character, some platinum acetylide complexes have exhibited interesting properties such as non-linear optics, luminescence, liquid crystallinity and electrical conductivity.19 In this report, we employed the organic sensitizers D–π–A design concept, which greatly improves the structural tailorability, to design and synthesize a new D–π–M–π–A structured platinum acetylide complex (Pts shown in Scheme 1) as sensitizer and investigated its application in DSSCs.

2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
The FTO conducting glass (FTO glass, fluorine doped tin oxide over-layer, transmission >90% in the visible, sheet resistance 15 Ω/square) was obtained from the Geao Science and Educational Co. Ltd. of China. Valeronitrile and n-iodobutane were purchased from Aldrich. Titania pastes of Ti-Nanoxide T/SP and Ti-Nanoxide 300 were from Solaronix. Lithium iodide was from Fluka and iodine, 99.999%, was from Alfa Aesar. 1-Butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII) was prepared according to published procedures.20

          THF and toluene were distilled from sodium, Et2NH was dried from potassium hydroxide, and both of them were degassed under N2 for 30 min before use. All reactions were performed in standard glassware under an inert N2 atmosphere. Compounds 1 and 3 were prepared by the reported procedure.21,22 85% H3PO4 (δ 0.0) was used as an internal standard in 31P{1H} NMR spectra.
2.2 Preparation of photovoltaic devices
A screen-printed double layer of TiO2 particles was used as photoelectrode. A 10-μm thick film of 13-nm-sized TiO2 particles (Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was first printed on the FTO conducting glass and further coated by a 4-μm thick second layer of 400-nm light-scattering anatase particles (Ti-Nanoxide 300). Sintering was carried out at 450 °C for 30 min. Before immersion in the dye solution, these films were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. Then the films were heated again at 450 °C for 30 min followed by cooling to 80 °C and dipping into a 3 × 10−4 M solution of dye in tetrahydrofuran for 12 h at room temperature. To prepare the counter electrode, the Pt catalyst was deposited on the cleaned FTO glass by coating with a drop of H2PtCl6 solution (0.02 M in 2-propanol solution) with heat treatment at 400 °C for 15 min. A hole (0.8-mm diameter) was drilled on the counter electrode by a Drill-press. The perforated sheet was cleaned by ultrasound in an ethanol bath for 10 min. For the assemblage of DSSCs, the dye-covered TiO2 electrode and Pt-counter electrode were assembled into a sandwich type cell and sealed with a hot-melt gasket of 25 μm thickness made of the ionomer Surlyn 1702 (DuPont). The size of the TiO2 electrodes used was 0.25 cm2 (i.e., 5 mm × 5 mm). A drop of the electrolyte was put on the hole in the back of the counter electrode. It was introduced into the cellvia vacuum backfilling. The hole in the counter electrode was sealed by a film of Surlyn 1702 and a cover glass (0.1 mm thickness) using a hot iron bar.
2.3 Electrolyte
The electrolyte employed was a solution of 0.5 M BMII (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide), 0.1 M DMPII (1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide), 0.03 M I2, 0.05 M LiI, 0.1 M GuSCN (guanidinium thiocyanate) and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15).
2.4 Measurements
Photovoltaic measurements employed an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon lamp (Model No. 91160, Oriel). The power of the simulated light was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a Newport Oriel PV reference cell system (Model 91150V). I–V curves were obtained by applying an external bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter. The voltage step and delay time of photocurrent were 10 mV and 40 ms, respectively. Cell active area was tested with a mask of 0.158 cm2. The photocurrent action spectra were measured with an IPCE test system consisting of a Model SR830 DSP Lock-In Amplifier and a Model SR540 Optical Chopper (Stanford Research Corporation, USA), a 7IL/PX150 xenon lamp and power supply, and a 7ISW301 Spectrometer. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements of all the DSSCs were performed using a Zahner IM6e Impedance Analyzer (ZAHNER-Elektrik GmbH & CoKG, Kronach, Germany). The frequency range is 0.1 Hz–100 kHz. The applied voltage bias is −0.70 V. The magnitude of the alternative signal is 10 mV.

Then ethylamine (73 mL) and dried toluene (110 mL) were introduced into the reaction flask by syringe. The reaction mixture was stirred under an inert atmosphere at room temperature for 3 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel to give 2 as a yellow solid. Yield: 2.83 g, 76.5%.

After removing the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography using silica gel and the mixed EA:CH3OH (v:v, 10:1) as the eluent to get a deep red solid. The solid was dissolved in CH2Cl2 and washed with HCl (10%). The organic phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and pumped dry to get a deep red solid (301 mg, yield 89.9%).

4. Results and discussion
4.1 Synthesis
The chemical structures and the synthetic pathways of all the platinum acetylide complexes are shown in Scheme 2. The starting materials, 4-(trimethylsilylethynyl)benzaldehyde (1) and (4-ethynylphenyl)diphenylamine (3), were prepared according to the literature,21,22 respectively. The complex 2 was prepared by the reaction of 1 with trans-[Pt(PEt3)2I2] in the presence of a catalytic amount of copper(I) iodide. In this reaction, an excess of trans-[Pt(PEt3)2I2] is necessary to minimize the formation of undesirable oligomeric byproducts. From the precursor 2, compound 4 was synthesized by using the similar copper(I)-catalyzed dehydrohalogenation approach. Subsequent condensation of the aldehyde 4 with cyanoacetic acid by Knoevenagel reaction in the presence of piperidine gave the target compound 5 in a reasonable yield. The molecular structures of new compounds were characterized by using multiple nuclear NMR (1H, 31P, and 13C) and mass spectroscopy. The 31P{1H} NMR spectra of 4 and 5 displayed a sharp singlet (ca. 11.7 ppm), respectively, shifted downfield from the starting platinum compound 2 by approximately 2.5 ppm due to the electron withdrawing by the large π-conjugated bridges.

4.2 Absorption properties in solutions and on TiO2 film

UV-Vis
absorption spectra of dye Pts in a diluted solution of THF and on the TiO2 film are shown in Fig. 1 and the absorption data are listed in Table 1. In the UV-Vis spectra, Pts in the solution exhibits one major prominent band, appearing at 300–450 nm. It is ascribed to HOMO → LUMO, HOMO-1 → LUMO and HOMO → LUMO + 1 transition (Figure S1 and Table S1). The absorption maximum for Pts in THF is at λ = 357 nm. In comparison with conventional ruthenium complexes (for example, 1.39 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 541 nm for N3) 23 the present dye molecules show about twice as high absorption coefficients. The greater maximum absorption coefficients allow a correspondingly thinner nanocrystalline film so as to avoid the decrease of the film mechanical strength. This also benefits the electrolyte diffusion in the film and reduces the recombination possibility of the light-induced charges during transportation.24,25Fig. 1 also shows the absorption spectra of Pts on TiO2 films after 12 h adsorption. As shown in Fig.1, the absorption peak for Pts on the TiO2 film is at λ = 391 nm and its absorption band is red-shifted by 34 nm compared with that in the solution. The red shift of the absorption spectra on TiO2 film of Pts could be ascribed to the aggregation of the dyes on the TiO2 surface, which can occur readily because of the presence of carboxyl groups in the molecules. The interaction between the carboxylate group and the surface Ti4+ ions may lead to increased delocalization of the π* orbital of the conjugated framework. The energy of the π* level is decreased by this delocalization, which explains the red shift for the absorption spectra.

4.3 Electrochemical properties
Suitable highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels of the sensitizer are required to match the conduction band (CB) edge level of the TiO2 electrode. To evaluate the possibility of electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the conduction band (Ecb) of TiO2, a cyclic voltammogram (Fig. 2) was recorded in acetonitrile solvent using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as supporting electrolyte, TiO2 films stained with sensitizer as the working electrode, a Pt wire as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The SCE reference electrode was calibrated using a ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple as an external standard, and the E1/2 of the Fc/Fc+ redox couple was found to be 0.37 V versus the SCE reference electrode. It can be speculated from Fig. 2 that the first half-wave potential of Pts is 0.34 V (vs.Fc/Fc+). Therefore, the ground state oxidation potential corresponding to the HOMO levels is 0.74 V (vs.NHE). From Fig. 1, we know that the absorption thresholds for dye Pts are 500 nm on TiO2 film, which correspond to the band gap energy (E0–0) of 2.48 eV. The estimated excited state potential corresponding to the LUMO level, calculated from EHOMO − E0–0, is −1.74 V. The examined HOMO level and the LUMO level are listed in Table 1. From these data, we found the HOMO level of Pts to be sufficiently more positive than the iodine/iodide redox potential value (0.4 V), indicating that the oxidized dyes formed after electron injection into the CB of TiO2 could thermodynamically accept electrons from I− ions. The LUMO level of the dye (see Table 1) was sufficiently more negative than the conduction-band-edge energy level (Ecb) of the TiO2 electrode (−0.5 V vs.NHE), which implies that electron injection from the excited dye into the CB of TiO2 is feasible.

4.4 Performances of Pts-sensitized solar cells
The photovoltaic performance was measured at 100 mW m−2 under AM 1.5 conditions (Fig. 3). For the best cell, the overall solar-to-electric conversion efficiency was 3.28% (with short-circuit photocurrent density Jsc = 6.77 mA cm−2, open-circuit photovoltage Voc = 0.70 V, fill factor ff = 0.69). This can be compared to solar cells with the conventional ruthenium dye N719 made under similar conditions (with dye baths in ethanol optimized for the N719 dye) giving η = 7.47% (Jsc = 16.10 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.69 V, ff = 0.67). Measuring the incident to photon current efficiency (IPCE), the highest value obtained for Pts was 83.1% at 350 nm and exceeds 60% in the spectral range 320–440 nm. The inset of Fig. 3 displays typical IPCE curves which spread to both sides compared with the absorption spectrum of the dye adsorbed on TiO2 (Fig. 1). This important shift in the photocurrent response is attributed to lateral interaction in the adsorbed layer of the sensitizer and the detailed reason for this needs further studies.

4.5 
          Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy

To further clarify the interrelation between the dyes and photoelectric properties of DSSCs, the electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS), which is a powerful tool to elucidate the electronic and ionic transport processes in DSSCs, was collected at open-circuit potential in the dark. Fig. 4 shows the electrical impedance spectra of DSSCs with Pts and N719 sensitizers. As shown in Fig. 4a, the small peaks on the left express the Pt/redox (I−/I3−) interface charge transfer and the large peaks on the right express dye-sensitized TiO2/redox (I−/I3−) interface charge transfer. The reaction resistance of the DSSCs with Pts or N719 sensitizers was analyzed by software (ZSimpWin) using an equivalent circuit containing a constant phase element (CPE) and resistances (R) (Fig. 4c) and the parameters obtained by fitting the impedance spectra shown in Table 2. The peak frequency in the Bode phase plots (Fig. 4b) of the middle-frequency peak is related to the charge recombination rate, and its reciprocal is regarded as electron lifetime.26 It is obvious that the middle-frequency peak shifts to a smaller value with N719 sensitizer indicating its longer electron lifetime than Pts.

5. Conclusion
In summary, a new platinum acetylide sensitizer (Pts) has been successfully prepared, which exhibited a promising application in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). A maximum solar energy to electricity conversion efficiency of 3.28% (Jsc = 6.77 mA cm−2, Voc = 700 mV, ff = 0.69) under simulated AM 1.5 solar light irradiation (100 mW cm−2) with a DSSC based on Pts was obtained, which is higher than that of most previously reported platinum (Pt) complexes as dye sensitizer. Compared to N719, there are some limitations for this dye with the narrow UV-Vis absorbance and shorter electronic lifetime, which limit the elevation of short-circuit photocurrent. While the charge-transfer resistance (R2) is 105.9 Ohm cm−2 for Pts and 50.7% higher than N719, which is beneficial to suppressing the back reaction of the injected electron with the I3− and is reflected in the improvements seen in the photovoltage, yielding substantially enhanced device efficiency. The contradiction between the higher charge transfer resistance and shorter electronic lifetime may be due to the aggregation of the dye inducing electronic recombination with oxidation state dye. The next work is to expand the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the Pt-complexes, extend electron lifetime and further improve the optical properties of devices by molecular structure design.
