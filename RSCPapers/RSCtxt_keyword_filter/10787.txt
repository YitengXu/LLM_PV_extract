    , Accepted 26th April 2019First published on 26th April 2019AbstractEggplant biomass was successfully converted into N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon materials as multifunctional electrodes for Zn–air battery-driven capacitive deionization via carbonization with potassium bicarbonate activation under a nitrogen atmosphere. The as-prepared N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon (NPC) electrode has a high N doping content (2.67 at%), oxygen-enriched chemical structure (surface oxygen content: 21.34 at%), hierarchical pore distribution (interconnected micro–meso–macropore system), high pore volume (0.72 cm3 g−1), and large specific surface area (1226 m2 g−1) as well as superior electroconductibility, which is advantageous for valid electrolyte approachability and rapid ion transmission to enhance the electrosorption capacity of carbon electrodes. These characteristics provided great salt adsorption capacity (SAC, 31.9 mg g−1) and excellent charge efficiency (CF, 60.3%) for capacitive deionization. Meanwhile, the NPC displays bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for the oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction, capable of constructing a rechargeable Zn–air battery with an open circuit voltage of 1.32 V. As a prototype integrated system, an NPC-800 constructed Zn–air battery was employed to power an NPC-800 symmetrical CDI device (denoted as a self-powered CDI system), showing comparable SAC and CF in the DC power driving mode. Furthermore, the self-powered CDI system also shows high removal efficiency for harmful heavy metal ions from water (99.1% for Pb2+ and 97.9% for Cd2+).

Water impact
Capacitive deionization (CDI) has been widely accepted as a promising water purification technology to obtain potable water. Nevertheless, the low ion removal capacity of currently developed carbon electrode materials and the traditional direct-current supply mode have seriously restricted the development of the CDI technique. Herein, a viable and economical method for achieving N, O-enriched porous carbon materials from raw biomass as multifunctional electrodes for a self-powered CDI system (rechargeable Zn–air battery-driven CDI device), which have tremendous potential in the portable applications of CDI devices, especially in geographically remote areas with inefficient electrical power, is reported.

1. Introduction
The emerging capacitive desalination (CDI) technology has been proven to be feasible and effective for obtaining freshwater from seawater/brackish water.1–4 The advantage of the CDI technique, utilizing carbon-based materials to generate electric double layer capacitance (EDLC) at the interfaces between electrolytes and carbon electrodes for adsorption of charged ionic species, is overwhelming, ascribed to its high energy efficiency, cost effectiveness, lack of secondary contamination, fast renewable electrodes and handy devices.5–10 Moreover, some studies also demonstrate that the CDI technique can be utilized for capacitive adsorption of heavy metal ions (such as Pb2+, Cd2+, Cu2+ and Mn2+) in water.11–14 Nevertheless, the low ion removal capacity of currently developed carbon electrode materials and the traditional direct-current supply mode have seriously restricted the development of the CDI technique.
Exploitation of biomass for fabricating versatile carbon materials has received sustained attention over the past decade because it provides solution strategies for solid waste disposal, lowers the cost of manufacture and increases the value of the final product for different applications.15,16 Bountiful biomass resources have been demonstrated to be the first priority category of raw materials for the manufacture of carbon materials, owing to their low cost, abundance, intrinsic structure and composition properties at the molecular level and natural N-containing characteristic.17,18 In this respect, many research groups including ours have recently reported that various biosources (e.g., soybean shell, silk cocoon, pomelo peel, watermelon, etc.) were successfully converted to N-doped porous graphitic carbon and used as CDI electrodes.19–21 Eggplant, as an important economic crop, has a slender elliptical shape, is widely distributed all over the world notably in Asia and Mediterranean countries and has been ranked the 25th global commodity crop.22 On the basis of the statistical data of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the global eggplant production for 2016 was estimated to be over 5.1 million metric tons in the world. More than 85% of the global eggplant production was derived from China and India. However, eggplant, especially its peel and carpopodium, was almost all discarded as rubbish by food processing plants, refectories or some other comestible production venues, which will give rise to fearful environmental issues due to their arbitrary disposal.23 Nowadays, eggplant is regarded as a source of high value-added ingredients, for instance polyphenols24 and polysaccharides,25 while the conversion of this waste into versatile carbon materials as multifunctional electrodes for capacitive deionization is less studied.
Generally, the performance of CDI depends strongly on the structural properties of carbon-based electrode materials.26 The large specific surface area and suitable pore volume distribution for fast ion transportation and continuous electron transfer are of primary importance to carbon-based CDI electrodes.27–29 Moreover, N doping and surface enriched oxygen functionalization, which conspicuously improve the wetting ability of electrodes and can contribute the pseudocapacitance through partaking in the Faradaic reactions, have a significant effect on the electrosorption performance.30,31 However, the prevalent activation treatment of carbon electrode materials is carried out by pore-forming agents (e.g., KOH, ZnCl2 or caustic NH3 gas), which remarkably eliminates N or O-embracing functional groups on the porous surface, which have great impacts on the performances of carbon-based CDI electrodes.32,33 In this respect, how to achieve N, O-enriched carbon electrodes with a large specific surface area and suitable pore volume distribution as well as a high-quality graphitization degree from raw biomass for CDI-related applications is still considerably important, deserving a deep study.
It is noteworthy that a CDI system is composed of not only a CDI device but also a power source. To date, the commonly used power supply is still the direct current power supply, and this power supply mode severely limits the portable applications of CDI devices. Introducing a new power approach to expand their outdoor applications will be a promising option to solve the above problem. For example, Wu et al. developed a self-sustainable desalination system through the combination of solar cells and CDI devices.34 Yuan et al. proved a microbial fuel cell as the power source to successfully drive CDI to desalinate salt water.35 Furthermore, zinc–air batteries are a relatively mature technology with a high theoretical energy density value, low cost, environmentally friendly features,30,31 and appropriate open-circuit voltage ranges that meet the CDI demands, providing an opportunity to drive CDI devices by zinc–air batteries. The combination of the CDI system and zinc–air battery can not only reduce the size and weight of the system but also greatly enhance the adaptability of the CDI system, especially in geographically remote areas with inefficient electrical power.
In this study, eggplant was selected as a carbon precursor to prepare N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon by carbonization followed by activation of potassium bicarbonate, owing to its high hydrocarbon content with spongy structures and internally connected configuration of cellular tissue. The as-prepared N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon (NPC-800) electrode has a high N doping content (2.67 at%), oxygen-enriched functional groups (surface oxygen content: 21.34 at%), a hierarchical pore distribution (interconnected micro–meso–macropore system), and a large surface area of 1226 m2 g−1, affording high electrosorption performance and superior electrocatalytic activities for the ORR and OER, favourable for CDI and rechargeable Zn–air battery applications. As a result, the NPC-800 CDI electrode displayed a great salt adsorption capacity (SAC), average salt adsorption rate (ASAR) and excellent charge efficiency (CF). Meanwhile, the NPC-800 prepared Zn–air battery has an open circuit voltage (OCV) of 1.32 V, which was utilized to drive the NPC-800 symmetrical CDI device (denoted as the self-powered CDI system), exhibiting comparable SAC and charge efficiency (CF) in the DC power driving mode. Moreover, the self-powered CDI system was also extended to remove harmful heavy metal ions in water, showing a high removal efficiency of 99.1% for Pb2+ and 97.9% for Cd2+ under the given experimental conditions (Scheme S1†). Our studies demonstrated the feasibility of using the integrated CDI system for salt ion and heavy metal ion removal applications.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Preparation of NPC
In this work, eggplant was selected as a carbon precursor to prepare NPC materials. The eggplant was cut into slices, and then immersed into a saturated KHCO3 solution for 30 min to adequately adsorb the KHCO3 activating agent. After freeze-drying treatment for 48 h, a sheet-like eggplant with adsorbed KHCO3 was obtained. Subsequently, the freeze-dried sample was carbonized at 600, 700, 800 or 900 °C for 3 h with a ramp rate of 10 °C min−1 in a nitrogen atmosphere. Afterward, the obtained product was pulverized and then soaked in 60 mL of dilute HNO3 aqueous solution (50% volume ratio) for 4 h at 80 °C to remove impurities. The final NPC product was collected through centrifugation and washed adequately with deionized water, followed by drying at 65 °C over 8 h. The as-fabricated N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon materials were represented as NPC-X (X denotes the carbonization temperature of 600, 700, 800 or 900 °C, respectively).
For comparison, an eggplant derived N-doped carbon material (NC-800) was also prepared at 800 °C in a N2 atmosphere, using the same preparation process above without the activation of potassium bicarbonate.
2.2 Material characterization
The materials were measured by means of SEM, TEM, XRD, FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, nitrogen sorption, contact angle measurement and XPS spectroscopy. The electrochemical performances of the materials, including cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear sweep voltammetry (LSV), ORR and OER activities and performances of Zn–air batteries, were measured using an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instruments, Inc., Shanghai, China). The experimental details are described in the ESI.†
2.3 Measurement of CDI performances
The electrosorption performance of the carbon electrodes was characterized at 1.2 V in batch mode, and the particulars of the equipment and experimental processes were followed as reported in our previous work.19 80 mL of NaCl solution with different concentrations of 40–1000 mg L−1 was employed to estimate the deionization capability of the CDI electrodes, and the initial concentration of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water was set at 0.5 ppm and 0.1 ppm, respectively, to study their capacity for removal of heavy metal ions, which are ten times their corresponding concentration in the national drinking water standard (GB5749-2006). The above stock solutions were continuously pumped into the CDI device with a flow rate of 15 mL min−1 and the efflux was reverted to the original solution. The reverse voltage mode was used to regenerate the CDI electrode. CDI electrodes with specific dimensions of 4.0 × 4.0 cm were prepared by weighing the active ingredient (NPC material), acetylene black and Nafion with a mass ratio of 8:1:1 in isopropyl alcohol to form a homogeneous compound. After desiccation at 60 °C in a vacuum oven over 8 h, the total mass of the active ingredient in the CDI electrodes is approximately 64 mg. The experimental details are described in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Structural and composition characteristics of NPC materials
Eggplant with high hydrocarbon content and trace amounts of N possesses interconnected frameworks of thin cell walls, consisting of sponge-like microstructures, and is readily pyrolytically converted to low cost N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon materials with the activation of potassium bicarbonate in a nitrogen atmosphere. In comparison with classical carbon, the eggplant-derived N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon materials for CDI-related electrochemical applications have six advantages: (i) the large specific surface area is conducive to providing numerous adsorption active sites for improving the electrosorption capacity of salt or heavy metal ions; (ii) the formed three-dimensional (3D) porous structure is beneficial to the electrochemistry-related mass transport and contributes to the high capacitance; (iii) the high graphitization degree offers conspicuous electroconductibility; (iv) the porous carbon materials possess great physicochemical and electrochemical stability; (v) the heteroatom (e.g., N) doped and surface enriched oxygen functionalized porous carbon can be a highly-active electrocatalyst (ORR and OER) for rechargeable Zn–air batteries; (vi) the electrode materials are capable of realizing rechargeable Zn–air battery-driven CDI devices for removal of salt ions and heavy metal ions.

Fig. 1a shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) curve of the freeze-dried eggplant with adsorbed KHCO3 in a N2 atmosphere. Below 200 °C, the initial weight loss of the sample is ascribed to the desorption of physically adsorbed water. A weight reduction of 44.5 wt% in the TGA curve is observed between 200 and 400 °C, which can be mainly ascribed to the carbonization of eggplant and the decomposition of KHCO3.36 After the pyrolysis temperature increased to 900 °C, a gradual weight reduction in the TGA curve can still be observed, primarily due to a series of KHCO3-related decomposition reactions occurring during the carbonization and graphitization of the eggplant-derived NPC at high pyrolysis temperature.36 As the pyrolysis temperature increases from 400 to 900 °C, the formation of gas products (e.g., CO2 and CO) through KHCO3 decomposition and the reaction between KHCO3-decomposed intermediates and eggplant-derived carbon are very favourable for creating porous structures and increasing surface oxygen-enriched functional groups in carbon.37 This results in eggplant-derived carbon materials with different surface areas and hierarchical pore distributions, which are critically important for electrochemical applications.38Fig. 1b shows the SEM image of the eggplant-derived N-doped carbon (NC-800) pyrolyzed at 800 °C without activation of KHCO3. Obviously, the as-fabricated NC-800 exhibits large-sized sheet-like morphologies without porous structures in the absence of KHCO3. In contrast, the SEM image (Fig. 1c) of the eggplant-derived N-doped porous carbon (NPC-800) pyrolyzed at 800 °C with activation of KHCO3 shows interconnected porous structures, which can extremely reduce the ion diffusion pathway for improving ion transportation. Synchronously, the thin microporous wall and inner channels act as the electrolyte reservoir during electrosorption/desorption, leading to superior rate performance of electrosorption. In Fig. 1d, a mass of wormhole-like frameworks were observed in the NCP-800 sample. The hierarchical porous structures of NCP-800 are interconnected micro–meso–macropores with two dimensional carbon sheets. This reveals that the activation of potassium bicarbonate can effectively create hierarchically open and interconnected porous structures in the as-fabricated carbon, consistent with our and other recently reported results.19,36 The detailed information on the porous structures of the as-fabricated NPC samples would be subsequently investigated in virtue of mercury intrusion porosimetry and N2 sorption isotherm measurement.

The influence of pyrolysis temperature on eggplant-derived NPC with the activation of KHCO3 was also investigated. Fig. S1a–c† show the SEM images of NPC-X (600, 700 and 900) samples. As shown, NPC-600 and NPC-700 have bulk carbon aggregates without good porous structures, while the fused carbon structure can be clearly seen for NPC-900 owing to the fusion role of K2CO3 obtained from KHCO3 decomposition at 900 °C.36 The above SEM results demonstrate that a low or high carbonization temperature is unfavourable for forming hierarchical porous structures in virtue of KHCO3 activation, possibly resulting in low performance for electrochemical applications. Fig. S1d† presents the XRD patterns of the eggplant-derived carbon materials NC-800 and NPC-X (600, 700, 800 and 900). As shown, similar XRD results can be obtained for all the samples investigated. The two broad diffraction peaks located at 23° and 44° were ascribed to the (002) and (100) planes of the disturbed structure of amorphous carbon and graphitic carbon with a limited degree of graphitization, which was conducive to the increase of the specific surface area of the carbon materials. The above XRD analysis indicates that the activation of KHCO3 during pyrolysis has no discernible effect on the crystal texture of the eggplant-derived carbon.
In the Raman spectra, all the NPC-X samples and NC-800 exhibit two characteristic bands at ∼1350 cm−1 (D-band) and ∼1580 cm−1 (G band), matching to the carbon sp3 and sp2 configuration, respectively (Fig. 2a). The calculated ID/IG values of NPC-X (600, 700, 800, and 900) and NC-800 are 0.90, 0.91, 0.94, 0.93 and 0.92, respectively. This demonstrates that NPC-800 has the largest ID/IG value among all the investigated samples, suggesting the presence of more carbon defects by the activation of KHCO3 owing to the formation of large numbers of pores in the carbon structure.28 This is favourable for highly-efficient electrocatalysis and salt ion accommodation during the electrosorption process when NPC-800 was used as the electrocatalyst and CDI electrode material.39 The FT-IR spectra of NC-800 and NPC-X samples exhibit the characteristic absorption bands of C–O at 1150 cm−1, CO at 1625 cm−1 and O–H at 3425 cm−1 in Fig. 2b,40 suggesting the surface abundant O-containing functional groups on the eggplant-derived carbon materials. These can endow the eggplant-derived porous carbon materials with superior surface hydrophilic properties with contact angles between 65° and 72°, which are vital to their electrochemical applications (Fig. S2†). Furthermore, the existence of oxygen-containing groups in the eggplant-derived porous carbon materials also promotes their high ORR and OER activities.41

In view of the macroporous characteristic from the above-mentioned SEM observation, mercury intrusion porosimetry has been employed to measure the macropore distribution of the as-prepared N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon. As presented in Fig. S3,† there is a wide pore size distribution ranging from a few micrometres to hundreds of micrometres, accompanied by one major peak centred at 6.6 μm. This proved that the characteristics of macroporous structures exist in the as-prepared N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon materials. Simultaneously, the porosity, total intrusion volume, and pore area are 32.5%, 1.31 mL g−1 and 2.4 m2 g−1, respectively. The nitrogen sorption isotherms of NC-800 and NPC-X samples are presented in Fig. 2c. For all the NPC-X samples, the representative type-IV isotherms reveal that the eggplant-derived NPC-X samples possess hierarchical porous frameworks with interconnected micro–meso–macropores, which are beneficial for improving the specific surface area and mass transport of the carbon materials during the electrochemical process.42 In contrast, the isotherm of NC-800 obviously revealed its poor pore structure compared with those obtained of the NPC-X samples, which is in accordance with the SEM characterization. The specific surface areas of NC-800 and NPC-X (600, 700, 800 and 900) are calculated to be 111, 472, 602, 1226 and 928 m2 g−1 with corresponding total pore volumes of 0.074, 0.25, 0.33, 0.72 and 0.51 cm3 g−1, respectively. The pore size distribution plots (Fig. 2d) of NC-800 and NPC-X samples indicate their dominant micropore, mesopore and macropore structures. Some reported studies have verified that the presence of micropores and mesopores can effectively promote the exposure of active sites during the electrochemical process.39,42 Moreover, large numbers of mesopores can tremendously accelerate the mass transport and specific capacitance, and thus improve the CDI performance.28 In brief, in virtue of KHCO3 activation, the NPC-800 sample with enriched O-containing functional groups exhibits a hierarchical porous structure and large specific surface area, which are conducive to the acceleration of ion transportation and the exposure of active sites for improving the electrochemical capacities.29
Fig. S4† shows the surface survey XPS spectra of NC-800 and NPC-800, exhibiting the presence of C, O and N elements for these two samples. The C 1s XPS spectra of NC-800 and NPC-800 are shown in Fig. 3a. The C 1s spectra were deconvoluted to six different peaks at 284.3, 284.6, 285.1, 286.4, 290.1 and 293.2 eV for these two samples, corresponding to C–C, CC, C–N, C–O, CO and O–CO, respectively.40 The O 1s spectra of NC-800 and NPC-800 were divided into three different peaks at 531.4, 532.8 and 533.9 eV, which were indexed to CO, C–O–C and C–OH, respectively (Fig. 3b). The presence of these surface enriched oxygen functional groups on the eggplant-derived porous carbon contributes to the high activities of the ORR and OER.41,43 Previously published studies have demonstrated that inherent N-doped carbon has high ORR activity due to the altering of the charge distribution and atomic density of the adjacent carbon to the doped N atom.44 Moreover, the N doping species (pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and quaternary N) have a serious impact on the ORR performance.44 The N 1s XPS spectra of NC-800 and NPC-800 are shown in Fig. 3c. The N 1s spectra were deconvoluted to three different peaks at 398.5 (pyridinic-N), 400.1 (pyrrolic-N) and 401.2 eV (graphitic-N), respectively.45 The pyridinic-N and graphitic-N contents of NPC-800 are 33.2 at% and 46.7 at%, respectively, obviously higher than those of NC-800 (pyridinic-N content of 22.3 at% and graphitic-N content of 33.7 at%), implying its higher ORR activity.44 Comparatively, the O content (21.3 at%) of NPC-800 is obviously higher than that of NC-800 (9.29 at%), while the N content of NPC-800 is decreased to 2.67 at% from 4.71 at% in NC-800 (Table S1†), possibly owing to the influence of KHCO3 during pyrolysis. Overall, in virtue of the KHCO3 activation during pyrolysis, the eggplant-derived carbon material obtained at a suitable pyrolysis temperature has high surface oxygen content and dominant pyridinic-N/graphitic-N, combined with a high specific surface area and hierarchical porous structure, making it a promising electrode material with high electrochemical performance in electrocatalysis and capacitive deionization.

3.2 Electrochemical capacitance performance
Here, we first study the impact of the hierarchical porous structure and pyrolysis temperature on the electrochemical capacity of the eggplant-derived carbon materials. Fig. 4a shows the CV plot of NC-800 and NPC-X. The CV curve integral areas of NPC-X (600, 700, 800, and 900) are conspicuously large compare with that of NC-800, because of their hierarchical porous structure and excellent specific surface area. Furthermore, NPC-800 displays the largest CV curve area, indicating its highest electrochemical capacitance among all the investigated carbon materials, which is beneficial for high CDI performance. The GCD curves at a current density of 0.5 A g−1 (Fig. 4b) show similar results, indicating that the optimal pyrolysis temperature is 800 °C in a N2 atmosphere with the activation of KHCO3. The GCD curves exhibit a representative triangle charge–discharge curve of a supercapacitor in Fig. 4b. When the pyrolysis temperature decreases to 600 and 700 °C, the electrochemical capacitance of NPC-600 and NPC-700 is decreased dramatically, primarily attributed to their inferior pore structure and poor specific surface area. However, when the pyrolysis temperature is set at 900 °C, the fusion role of K2CO3 obtained from KHCO3 decomposition leads to the dilation of pores in the obtained carbon material, thus decreasing the electrochemical capacitance. The CV curves of NPC-800 at scan rates from 2 to 50 mV s−1 are shown in Fig. 4c. The quasi-rectangular form of the CV curves implies good EDLC behaviour of NPC-800.27

(b) GCD curves over a potential range of −1.0 to −0.2 V at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. (c) CV curves of NPC-800 at different sweep rates. (d) Specific capacitances at various current densities. (d) Cycling stability of NPC-800 at a current density of 0.5 A g−1. (e) EIS measurement of NC-800 and NPC-X (600, 700, 800 and 900) electrodes in 1.0 mol L−1 NaCl solution. (f) Electrosorption capacity of the NPC-800 electrode at 1.2 V in various initial concentrations of NaCl solution. 
Fig. S5a–e† show the GCD curves of NC-800 and NPC-X at current densities from 0.5 to 3.0 A g−1. Fig. 4d shows their corresponding specific capacitances. Conspicuously, NPC-800 has the largest capacitance among all the investigated electrode materials in NaCl solution. The capacitance of NPC-800 is 172.5 F g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, whereas the capacitances of NC-800, NPC-600, NPC-700 and NPC-900 are 126.7, 125.0, 146.1 and 166.7 F g−1, respectively. This suggests that NPC-800 is the greatest CDI electrode among all the eggplant-derived carbon materials. The stability test (Fig. 4e) of NPC-800 shows that the capacitance retention is almost 98% after 1000 cycles at 0.5 A g−1, demonstrating its great electrochemical stability. The EIS Nyquist plots of NC-800, NPC-600, NPC-700, NPC-800 and NPC-900 are shown in Fig. 4f. An equivalent-circuit diagram is presented in the inset of Fig. 4f. The charge transfer resistance (R2) values of NPC-600, NPC-700, NPC-800, NPC-900 and NC-800 are 0.08, 0.07, 0.04, 0.10 and 0.37 Ω, respectively, indicating the superior charge transfer properties of NPC-800. This is attributed to the advantages provided by the hierarchical porous structure to effectively improve the mass transport and the N doping and surface enriched oxygen functionalization on the carbon structures to enhance the electroconductibility and wettability of NPC-800, which are all vital to the electrochemical performance.
3.3 Measurements of CDI performances in DC power driving mode
The CDI performances of NPC-X were measured in different concentrations of NaCl solution (40, 100, 300, 500 or 1000 mg L−1) at 1.2 V provided by a DC power supply. The conductivity variations of the NaCl solution before and after electrosorption of NPC-X electrodes are shown in Fig. S6a and b.† Obviously, the NPC-800 electrode displays a higher SAC (31.9 mg g−1) and a faster ASAR (1.52 mg g−1 min−1) compared to NPC-600 (7.52 mg g−1, 0.50 mg g−1 min−1), NPC-700 (16.25 mg g−1, 0.87 mg g−1 min−1) and NPC-900 (26.23 mg g−1, 1.23 mg g−1 min−1) in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution. As an important criterion, the cycling stability of NPC-800 was measured in this work, and conductivity changes over six sequential adsorption/desorption cycles are shown in Fig. 5a. In this study, the desorption process was conducted by applying a reverse voltage, which is helpful for the complete desorption of ions and extending voltage CDI effects. The changes in conductivity indicate that the NPC-800 electrode successfully captures and releases salt ions, and the conductivity retention is over 98% after every operation, suggesting the superior stability and excellent regeneration capability of the NPC-800 electrode. Moreover, the current profiles (Fig. 5b) during CDI operation also demonstrate an analogous feature of the constant voltage mode in CDI, indicating that the current is primarily relevant to the capture and release of salt ions during the CDI operation.

To obtain deep comprehension of CDI performances, the electrosorption capacity of the NPC-800 electrode in different concentrations of NaCl solution was determined at 1.2 V and the correlative currents were recorded contemporaneously as shown in Fig. 5c. This clearly shows that the electrosorption rate increases as the NaCl concentration increases. The variation of current is in accordance with the change of the ion concentration in NaCl solution, suggesting the general applicability of the NPC-800 electrode for salt ion capture. Fig. 5d shows the final SAC and CF values of the NPC-800 electrode in different initial concentrations of NaCl solution at 1.2 V. The adsorption capacity of the NPC-800 electrode is 14.2, 21.7, 23.1, 31.9 and 33.1 mg g−1 in NaCl solution with an initial concentration of 40, 100, 300, 500 and 1000 mg L−1 and the corresponding CF (Λ) is 29%, 41%, 56%, 60% and 57%, respectively. Further, the Kim–Yoon plot is an effective tool to evaluate the real time correlation between the SAC and the related ASAR. As depicted in Fig. 5e, the corresponding Kim–Yoon plot shifts over the upside boundary with the increase of the NaCl solution concentration, suggesting the fast deionization rate of the NCP-800 electrode in high concentration of NaCl solution. Fig. 5f shows the adsorption capacity of the NPC-800 electrode at 1.2 V in different concentrations of NaCl solution. The curve of the adsorption capacity depends on the concentration of NaCl solution and corresponds to the Langmuir adsorption model, indicating the monolayer adsorption of salt ions on the NPC-800 electrode during the electrosorption process. The calculated Langmuir adsorption constant (KL) and the maximum adsorption amount corresponding to the monolayer coverage (qm) are 0.073 and 0.92 mol g−1 for the NPC-800 electrode, respectively.
3.4 ORR and OER activities of the NPC electrodes
The N-doped carbon materials possess high ORR and OER activities, indicating great application potential as cathodes for Zn–air batteries.27 In our recent report, the porous carbon derived from soybean shell was used for realizing primary Zn–air battery-driven CDI devices.19 From the perspective of both energy and economy, utilizing Zn–air batteries to power CDI devices assembled with the same biomass-derived N, O-containing hierarchical porous carbon materials would be very attractive for future applications of portable CDI devices. Currently, eggplant-derived hierarchical porous carbon with N, O-enriched functionalization will be promising as a bifunctional electrocatalyst (ORR and OER) for Zn–air batteries. Therefore, the ORR activity of the as-fabricated NPC-800 was first evaluated as shown in Fig. 6a. As observed, NPC-800 shows an onset potential of ca. 0.85 V (vs. RHE), and the limiting current density increases with the increase of the rolling speed. The Koutecky–Levich (K–L) plots (Fig. S7a†) derived from Fig. 6a display great linearity at various potentials, and the number of electrons transferred (Fig. 6b) from 0.15 to 0.35 V (vs. RHE) is calculated to be 3.85 for NPC-800, revealing an approximately four-electron ORR course. The cycling durability curve of NPC-800 for the ORR is presented in Fig. S6b.† Obviously, NPC-800 possesses higher durability with only 8.73% current density decrease in comparison with a Pt/C electrode with 21.73% current density reduction during a 12 h run at a rolling speed of 1600 rpm. Additionally, NPC-800 as an electrocatalyst also exhibits high OER activity with an onset potential of 1.51 V (vs. RHE) and an over potential of 320 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 6c). The superior oxygen reaction functionality of NPC-800 is ascribed to the doping of active N species (e.g., pyridinic-N and graphitic-N) and its surface abundant O-containing functional groups, large surface area, and hierarchical porous structure as well as good conductivity, making it promising for rechargeable Zn–air battery application. Accordingly, NPC-800 as an air cathode and Zn foil as an anode were used to construct a homemade rechargeable Zn–air battery. Fig. 6d presents the correlative power density curve of the constructed Zn–air battery. The constructed Zn–air battery possesses a power density of 178.5 mW cm−2 at a current density of 250 mA cm−2. Fig. 6e shows the capability of the constructed Zn–air battery. In the charging course, the current density of the constructed Zn–air battery can achieve 74.6 mA cm−2 at a charging voltage of 2.2 V. The relevant discharging current density is 104.6 mA cm−2 at a current density of 1.0 V. The cycling stability measurement (Fig. 6f) demonstrates that the constructed Zn–air battery via NPC-800 possesses high durability, which is vital to Zn–air batteries.

3.5 The performance of the rechargeable Zn–air battery driven CDI device
As shown in Fig. 7a, the LED lamp arrayed “CDI” pattern is triumphantly powered by the NPC-800 constructed Zn–air battery with an OCV of 1.32 V (inset in Fig. 7a). Furthermore, this NPC-800 constructed Zn–air battery (OCV of 1.32 V) is also employed to drive a CDI device. The self-powered CDI system (rechargeable Zn–air battery-driven CDI device) was evaluated by performing consecutive adsorption–desorption cycling experiments. Fig. 7b demonstrates that the self-powered CDI system of NPC-800 possesses high cycling stability, and the conductivity retention of the effluent is over 98.5% after every cycle operation. Moreover, the current profiles during operation display similar properties of the conductivity changes in the consecutive adsorption–desorption measurements, suggesting the primary correlation between the current and the adsorption–desorption of the salt ions during CDI operation (Fig. 7c). Fig. 7d shows that the SAC and CF of the self-powered CDI system of NPC-800 are 34.4 mg g−1 and 59.9% in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution, which are superior to those of recently published carbon-based CDI devices (Table S2†).46 The high SAC value obtained in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution at a voltage of 1.32 V could be due to the following: (1) the obtained NPC electrode possesses a high specific surface area of 1226 m2 g−1, a high N doping content (2.67 at%), oxygen-enriched functional groups (surface oxygen content: 21.34 at%), and a hierarchical pore distribution (interconnected micro–meso–macropore system) which facilitate the adsorption of salt ions, thus contributing to the high SAC value; (2) the higher NaCl concentration (e.g., 500 mg L−1) and high driving voltage (1.32 V) are favourable for facilitating the establishment of a compact electrical double layer (EDL), thus improving the salt adsorption capacity of the NPC electrode.

As we know, effective removal of harmful heavy metal ions from water is critically important to guard our drinking water safety. Recently, several studies have experimentally validated the feasibility of using the CDI technique to remove heavy metal ions from water.11,13 In particular, the utilization of the CDI technique to remove trace heavy metal ions from water may be more efficient and significant owing to its intrinsic electrochemical related properties. As a prototype integrated CDI system, the self-powered CDI system of NPC-800 was evaluated for capacitive removal of trace harmful heavy metal ions (e.g., Pb2+ and Cd2+) from water (Scheme S1†). The initial concentration of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water was set at 0.5 ppm and 0.1 ppm, respectively, which are ten times their corresponding concentration in the national drinking water standard (GB5749-2006). The concentrations of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water after the capacitive removal are detected in virtue of inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Fig. 8a and b show the change of Pb2+ and Cd2+ concentration in water with the capacitive removal and adsorption time. As shown, using the self-powered CDI system of NPC-800, the concentration of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water is rapidly decreased in the initial stage, and then the concentration of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water gradually reaches an equilibrium state after 60 min. After the self-powered CDI system of NPC-800 was run for 90 min, the concentration of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water dropped to 4.5 ppb and 2.2 ppb, respectively, affording a removal efficiency of 99.1% for Pb2+ and 97.9% for Cd2+. The residual concentration of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water is significantly lower than that regulated by the national drinking water standard (50 ppb for Pb2+ and 10 ppb for Cd2+). Furthermore, a mixed solution containing 0.5 ppm Pb2+ and 0.1 ppm Cd2+ was also measured using the self-powered CDI system of NPC-800. The results (Fig. 8c) show that the concentration of Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water is rapidly decreased within the initial 15 min, and then reaches an equilibrium state after 60 min. The above results indicate the great potential of such an integrated CDI system for practical water purification. The regeneration of CDI electrodes is vital to their practical application. In this study, we adopted a direct short-circuit approach to regenerate the CDI electrode after electrosorption of Pb2+ and Cd2+. The results of three cycling experiments (Fig. 8d) demonstrate that the integrated CDI system of NPC-800 still maintains high removal efficiencies for Pb2+ and Cd2+ after direct short-circuit regeneration for 1 h in each experiment after electrosorption for 90 min, indicating the feasibility of such an integrated approach of rechargeable Zn–air batteries and the CDI technique for heavy metal ion removal applications.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, N, O-enriched hierarchical porous carbon derived from eggplant was triumphantly developed by a KHCO3-assisted pyrolysis approach. Owing to its high N doping content (2.67 at%), oxygen-enriched functional groups (surface oxygen content: 21.34 at%), hierarchical pore distribution (interconnected micro-meso-macropore system), pore volume of 0.72 cm3 g−1 and surface area of 1226 m2 g−1, as well as good conductivity, the eggplant-derived porous carbon procured at a pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C exhibited a SAC of 31.9 mg g−1 and a CF of 60.3% for capacitive deionization in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution at 1.2 V, and superior bifunctional electrocatalytic activities for the ORR and OER, capable of constructing a Zn–air battery with an OCV of 1.32 V. The eggplant-derived carbon assembled integrated CDI system exhibits a SAC of 34.4 mg g−1 and a CF of 59.9% in 500 mg L−1 NaCl solution, as well as a high removal efficiency of 99.1% for Pb2+ and 97.9% for Cd2+ under the given experimental conditions, demonstrating its great application potential for electrosorption of salt ions and heavy metal ions. This research work provides a viable and economical method for achieving N, O-enriched porous carbon materials from raw biomass for energy-saving CDI application.

Water impact
Capacitive deionization (CDI) has been widely accepted as a promising water purification technology to obtain potable water. Nevertheless, the low ion removal capacity of currently developed carbon electrode materials and the traditional direct-current supply mode have seriously restricted the development of the CDI technique. Herein, a viable and economical method for achieving N, O-enriched porous carbon materials from raw biomass as multifunctional electrodes for a self-powered CDI system (rechargeable Zn–air battery-driven CDI device), which have tremendous potential in the portable applications of CDI devices, especially in geographically remote areas with inefficient electrical power, is reported.
