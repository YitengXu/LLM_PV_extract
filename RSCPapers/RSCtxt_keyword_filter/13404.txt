    , Accepted 26th May 2023First published on 27th May 2023AbstractIn perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the charge transfer (CT) process at the electron transport layer/photosensitive layer heterojunction has a significant effect on the power conversion efficiency. However, obtaining nondestructive and microscopic information of the interfacial CT process is still challenging. Here, taking advantage of the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effect of ZnO and MAPbI3, the microscopic ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction is investigated, and two main factors affecting the CT process – energy level alignment and film quality – are discussed. Under different conduction band offset (CBO) values, the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction exhibited evident CT trend changes, observed with the SERS signal of probe molecules. When the precursor ratio of PbI2/MAI was 1.0, the strongest CT was observed with the CBO at 0.14 eV. This work not only provides new information for PSC fabrication but also suggests a role for SERS in sensing the CT process of solar devices.
1. Introduction
Over the past decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have gained increasing attention due to their impressive optoelectronic properties, such as strong solar absorption, long carrier lifetime, low binding-energy excitons, high carrier mobility, and low nonradiative carrier recombination rate. Since the first report of PSCs in 2009,1 significant progress has been made in device structure design and interface engineering, with the power conversion efficiency increasing to 25.7% in 2021.2 In PSCs, the charge separation, injection, transport and reverse recombination processes mainly occur at the electron transport layer (ETL)/photosensitive layer (PL) heterojunction, which determines the I–V characteristics and Voc of PSCs.3 Meanwhile, compared with other photosensitive materials, there are relatively few deep defects in bulk perovskite materials,4 which means that the charge transfer (CT) and recombination processes at the ETL/PL interface play a more important role. In addition to the film morphology, the interfacial energy level alignment at the ETL/PL heterojunction strongly affects the carrier recombination and injection. Usually, the energy level alignment at the interface is described by the conduction band offset (CBO), which determines the electron transfer process. To ensure that the photogenerated electrons in the perovskite can be efficiently injected into the electron transport layer, a suitable CBO between the PL and ETL must be ensured. Quickly judging the effect of energy level alignment on interfacial CT is important for improving the cell efficiency and reducing the cost, which requires sensitive interface characterization methods.
Today, exploring microscopic information in optoelectronic devices (i.e., heterojunctions) is still very challenging, even though it provides a great deal of helpful information. On the one hand, realizing a nondestructive technique is challenging, and on the other hand, the resolution of conventional microscopy techniques is not sufficient to distinguish bulk phases and interfaces. To date, most works on interfacial CT are mainly based on theoretical methods.5,6 Most experimental investigations on the CT process of PSCs are mainly focused on photocurrent–voltage characteristics (I–V curves) with support from other experimental techniques.7–11 These techniques provide essential information for the CT process at the ETL/PL heterojunction from a macroscopic perspective. However, considering the sensitivity, non-destructivity and bulk–interface resolution, more suitable experimental techniques are needed to achieve nondestructive sensing of interfacial CT processes from a microscopic perspective, which is of great significance for material optimization and device design.
Since it was discovered in 1974,12 surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) has been applied as a sensitive tool for investigating interfacial processes.13,14 When excited by laser light, electrons move between the adsorbed molecules and the semiconductor substrates.15 This CT process depends on the interfacial energy level matching degree,16–18 leading to an enormous magnification of molecular polarizability and Raman scattering. Thus, it can reflect the interaction process between surficial molecules and the substrate, making SERS technology a new method for sensing the interface CT mechanism. SERS has its own advantages in exploring interfacial CT processes. Some of the advantages are as follows: (1) as a conventional surface–interface characterization method, the semiconductor-based SERS system originates from the interface of 1- to 2-layer molecular thickness, thus enabling the distinction of bulk material and interface properties;19 (2) different from photoluminescence spectra, the SERS spectrum shows the fingerprint peaks of the interface molecules, which provide rich interface information such as the interfacial molecule–molecule interaction,14 interfacial molecular structure,20 charge separation,13etc.; (3) as a kind of ultrasensitive spectroscopy, SERS based on semiconductor substrates is very sensitive to changes in interfacial molecular electron density distribution in the study of interface CT processes and can provide a more microscopic interaction mechanism.21 For PSCs, ETL/PL semiconductor materials show strong SERS activity,21–23 which provides the possibility for ultrasensitive exploration of the microscopic CT mechanism at the ETL/PL heterojunction.
In this work, SERS spectroscopy was applied to sense the CT process at the microscopic ETL/PL interface of PSCs, and two main factors affecting the CT process – energy level alignment and film quality – are discussed based on the SERS technique. Because of the simultaneous realization of efficient electron transport and strong SERS enhancement, a ZnO nanorod array was employed as the ETL. As the most commonly used perovskite material, MAPbI3 was chosen as the photosensitive layer. Due to its sensitivity to CT processes,14,24,25 MPY (4-mercaptopyridine) molecules were chosen as SERS probes to reveal how charge transfers in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction. It was found that the introduction of MPY not only sensed the effect of energy level alignment on the CT process but also facilitated the rapid extraction of electrons in the heterojunction. The photoluminescence spectra are taken as a reference for determining the effectiveness of SERS in sensing the interfacial CT process. Compared with ZnO/MPY, a significantly enhanced SERS signal was obtained due to the improved CT process in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction. Meanwhile, different CT trends in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction were observed in SERS spectra with the changed CBO when MAPbI3 films were formed with different self-doping ratios, which is in line with the CT trend observed with steady-state and transient photoluminescence. This work demonstrates the huge potential of the SERS technique in exploring the microscopic CT mechanism at the ETL/PL heterojunction due to its high sensitivity, time efficiency, and nondestructive nature.
2. Experimental section
2.1. Chemicals
Zinc nitrate hydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 99%), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA, 99%), zinc acetate (Zn(Ac)2, 99.9%), 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH3CH2OH, 99.8%), and 4-mercaptopyridine (MPY, 96%) were purchased from Aldrich Co. Methylammonium iodide(MAI, 99.5%), polyethyleneimine (PEI, branched, low molecular weight), lead iodide(PbI2, 99.999%) and N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.9%) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd (China). The ITO glass was purchased from Xiangcheng Technology Co., Ltd., China, with a sheet resistance of 7–10 Ohm sq−1, an ITO film thickness of 185 ± 50 nm and a transparency of 85%. Triple distilled water with resistivity greater than 18.0 MΩ cm was used throughout. All reagents were used as received without further purification.
2.2. Device fabrication
The ITO substrates were first thoroughly cleaned by acetone/isopropanol sonication for 20 min each and then coated with a thin film of ZnO nanorod arrays. The ZnO precursor solution was prepared following previous reports,26,27 where Zn(Ac)2 was dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol with ethanolamine as a stabilizer. Then, ZnO nanorods were grown by immersing seeded substrates in aqueous solutions containing 25 mM Zn(NO3)2, 25 mM HMTA, and 5–7 mM PEI at 90 °C for 3 hours. After the hydrothermal process, the arrays were rinsed with deionized water and baked in air at 400 °C for 30 min to remove any residual organics. As shown in Fig. 1, the MPY molecules were introduced by immersing the ITO/ZnO substrates into an ethanol solution of MPY (10−3 M). Next, freshly prepared MAPbI3 solution (1 M) was spin-coated and annealed at 80 °C for 4 min to form the MAPbI3 layer. The MAPbI3 precursor was prepared by mixing pristine PbI2 and MAI (1:1) in DMF.

2.3. Measurements
UV-vis absorption spectra were collected on a Shimadzu UV-2700 spectrometer. The Raman spectra and Raman images were obtained on a WITec alpha300R confocal Raman microscope (WITec GmbH). The SERS mapping images were collected from a square matrix of 10000 points (100 × 100). The data extraction process was automatically completed with the WITec Project Plus software. The excitation laser was a diode-pumped solid-state laser (532 nm, cobalt laser). A diffraction-limit spot size of the 532 nm laser of approximately 600 nm was obtained with a 100× objective (NA = 0.90). The laser power was fixed to 1.5 mW cm−2 for Raman spectra and Raman images. Detected from the top side of ITO (Fig. 1), all SERS spectra were collected in 1 s accumulations with 60 times cycles. The Raman data analysis was performed with WITec Project Plus software. The steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the perovskite films were recorded on an Edinburgh FLS1000 instrument (λex = 468 nm, λem = 786 nm.). Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were conducted on a VG ESCALAB MK II spectrometer equipped with an integrated ultrahigh vacuum system using the 21.2 eV He(I) line of a He discharge lamp. The morphologies of the perovskites and ZnO nanorods were characterized using a ZEISS Merlin Compact field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed using a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer.
3. Results and discussion
In Fig. 2a, the ZnO layer appears as nanorods with a diameter of ∼50 nm and a length of ∼1 μm, whose larger specific surface area is conducive to further exploration via SERS. Fig. 2b and c show SEM images of perovskite films on bare ZnO and ZnO/MPY substrates. The MAPbI3 distribution on bare ZnO is almost the same as that on the ZnO/MPY substrate. The cross-sectional images of perovskite films on bare ZnO and ZnO/MPY substrates are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), in which MAPbI3 can be observed filling the interstices of the ZnO nanorods. Fig. 2d shows the XRD patterns of MAPbI3 films grown on ZnO and ZnO/MPY substrates. The peaks at 14.5°, 20.4°, 23.9°, 28.9°, 32.3°, 40.9°, and 43.5° can be attributed to the (110), (200), (202), (220), (310), (224) and (314) faces of the MAPbI3 crystalline structure,28 respectively. These perovskite diffraction peaks became slightly enhanced with the insertion of MPY, as shown in Fig. 2d (red line), indicating an improvement in the crystallinity of MAPbI3 films. This improvement is in accordance with previous reports in which the introduction of molecules with –SH groups can effectively passivate lead defects due to the electrostatic interaction of Pb and S atoms.29,30 The peaks with an asterisk are from PbI2. According to previous reports,31 the enhancement of the peaks at 13.1° and 34.9° comes from the introduction of MPY molecules, which indicates the sight decomposition of CH3NH3PbI3 the perovskite film on the MPY-modified ZnO layer. As shown in previous reports,28 perovskite films with high crystallinity are beneficial to the construction of efficient PSCs. Thus, the morphology evolution with MPY deposition can be deduced to possibly improve the device performance of PSCs and pave the way for the application of SERS in CT process sensing.

To confirm the CT process between perovskite, MPY, and ZnO, steady-state and transient photoluminescence measurements were conducted on MAPbI3 thin films deposited on glass slides, ZnO, and ZnO/MPY. As shown in Fig. 3a, the photoluminescence intensity of the MAPbI3 film on ZnO is lower than that on glass slides, with significant photoluminescence quenching. Although not complete, the strong quenching of the photoluminescence in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction is evidence for the faster CT between MAPbI3 and the ZnO substrate.32,33 After introducing MPY, a slight reduction in the photoluminescence quenching is observed, which is in accordance with previous reports.29 Correspondingly, the photoluminescence lifetimes are also reduced for MAPbI3 on ZnO/MPY or ZnO, as shown in Fig. 3b.

As shown in Table 1, the decay processes of the MAPbI3 film are fitted with two-component exponential decay following previous reports. For the MAPbI3 film on a glass slide, the average photoluminescence decay lifetime is ∼161.3 ns, with nearly first-order decay.28,29,34 After contact with MPY-modified ZnO, the fitted lifetime is reduced from ∼50.3 to ∼33.2 ns, which suggests a more efficient and faster CT process between MAPbI3 and ZnO. The fast decay of τ1 may come from bimolecular recombination, and the long decay of τ2 may come from the recombination of free carriers in the radiation channel.28,29,33 Notably, compared with that on ZnO, the free carrier decay time (τ2) of MAPbI3 on ZnO/MPY shows a notable reduction with slightly lowered contents, suggesting faster free carrier extraction in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction after introducing MPY molecules. The faster CT process between the MPY and ZnO layers is also confirmed by the faster decay of the transient photoluminescence shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The MPY molecules absorbed on the ZnO substrate show a much shorter lifetime than those on glass, which can be ascribed to the CT process between MPY molecules and ZnO. Fast carrier extraction is beneficial for higher power conversion efficiency, which motivated many researchers to improve cell efficiency by introducing interfacial molecules and laid the foundation for exploring interfacial CT processes via SERS.

When the electrons transfer between the ZnO and MAPbI3 layers, the instantaneous electron cloud distribution of MPY molecules will be disturbed, allowing a change in the polarizability on the molecules.35 That is, the polarizability of MPY molecules, as a parameter that shows the distortion of a molecule under an external electric field, changes with the CT process in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction. As an inelastic scattering process, Raman spectra depend on the instantaneous polarizability of a bond, which is related to the real component of polarizability.19 The relationship between the Raman intensity and polarizability can be obtained by the following expression:36  where E(ω0) is the intensity of the incident photoelectric magnetic field, E(ωS) is the intensity of the scattered photoelectric magnetic field, and α represents the polarizability under incident excitation light in the ρ direction and Raman scattering light in the σ direction. According to the above SERS intensity rule, the SERS intensity is proportional to the square of polarizability, providing a new perspective for interfacial CT sensing. Different from SERS spectra, photoluminescence spectra result from the emission of a photon from S1 to S0, following a direct absorption of the photon and relaxation of the molecule. Since the CT process between heterojunctions offers an additional relaxation channel, steady-state photoluminescence quenching is always used as a means of characterizing interfacial CT processes.37 In combination with the previously mentioned properties of SERS-originating from the surficial 1–2 molecular layers, we can conclude that both SERS and photoluminescence respond to interfacial CT, but when we consider the interface/bulk phase distinction and the ultrasensitive properties of SERS, the former one is more focused on the surface and more informational.
According to previous work, when the laser energy approaches the excitation threshold, the CT process shows a trend of rising first and then reaching equilibrium.38,39 In this work, photoluminescence spectra were obtained with a laser at 468 nm, and SERS spectra were obtained with a laser at 532 nm. Because the band gap of the MAPbI3 film is ∼1.55 eV, both the 532 nm and 468 nm excitation wavelengths reach the excitation threshold and therefore have a similar excitation effect. Thus, the most commonly used 532 nm laser close to the 468 nm wavelength was chosen as the SERS excitation source. Fig. 4a shows the SERS spectra of MPY molecules absorbed on the ZnO substrate and in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction. The SERS spectra of MPY on the ZnO layer shown in Fig. 4a are in accordance with previous reports,14 and the band assignments of MPY are listed in Table 2.

As shown by the formula mentioned above, for semiconductor SERS substrates, when the optical properties of materials such as UV-Vis absorption and refractive index change, E(ω0) does not change, and E(ωS) changes slightly with structural changes. The change in E(ωS) has no vibration direction selectivity and shows the same enhancement effect as all vibrational modes. Usually, in SERS analysis, the a1-mode peaks are normalized to exclude the variations in peak intensity caused by structural changes,14 as the a1-mode peaks are only affected by the electromagnetic field intensity. We normalized the SERS spectrum at 1022 cm−1. The band at 2440 cm−1, ascribed to the stretching of the –SH group in MPY molecules, shows a significant decrease after contact with the MAPbI3 layer (Fig. 4b). Thus, it can be deduced that the MPY molecules are anchored on MAPbI3 with the apical S atom of MPY, which can be explained with the hard and soft acids and bases theory (HSAB).40 Significantly enhanced nontotally symmetric (b2) modes were observed at 1241, 1319, and 1426 cm−1, while similar enhancements were not observed in the totally symmetric (a1) modes at 1061 cm−1 and 1118 cm−1. To further clarify the selective enhancement phenomenon, SERS mapping images of ZnO and the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction were based on the band intensity of MPY at 1241 cm−1 (b2), as shown in Fig. 4d and e. The statistical results show that the intensity of the band at 1241 cm−1 (b2) in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction is significantly enhanced compared with that on the ZnO substrate. For clarity, as shown in Fig. 4f, the Raman results of 10000 points were extracted from the SERS mapping images of the MPY-modified ZnO substrate and MPY-modified ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction. The statistical results of bands at 1061, 1118, 1319, and 1426 cm−1 are shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The changes in the intensities of these bands are shown in Table 3, where b2-type bands are significantly more intense, while a1-type bands are barely enhanced. The band at approximately 1591 cm−1 is an overlap result of two bands: a totally symmetric vibration mode at 1612 cm−1 (8a1) and a nontotally symmetric vibration mode at 1577 cm−1 (8b2).14 In Fig. 4c, the band at 1591 cm−1 in the ZnO/MAPbI3 interface becomes wider than that on the ZnO substrate, which can be attributed to the intensity increase of the band at 1577 cm−1 (8b2). Overall, we can conclude that the SERS spectrum of MPY molecules in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction shows selective enhancement of the b2-type vibrational mode compared with that on the ZnO substrate.

For semiconductor-based systems, the CT mechanism is the dominant contribution to the SERS signal. According to the Raman selection rule,19 the change in polarizability occurring with molecular vibration allows this vibration to be Raman active. As shown in Fig. 5a, considering the presence of CBO and the energy of the 532 nm laser, the CT process can only occur from MAPbI3 to ZnO. The valence band edge of MAPbI3 is at −5.46 eV with respect to vacuum according to the UPS spectra shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and one of the unoccupied orbitals of MPY is above −4.86 eV.41 The effect of the CT process on the SERS intensity can be understood with the Herzberg–Teller surface selection rules41,42 – the CT process occurs only when the symmetries of the dipole operator and the unoccupied orbitals match. For MPY, there are three candidates for the CT process – unoccupied π* orbitals of symmetry B1, B2, and A1, whose enhancement order is the same as that of decreasing oscillator strength of the optical transitions.43,44 By comparison, we found that the SERS spectra of MPY on ZnSe were similar to those in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction.41,45 We deduced that B2, the lowest lying state, is maximally enhanced. We further assume that the molecule is attached perpendicular to the surface with A1 symmetry.41 When applying the Herzberg−Teller selection rules to the whole CT process, we obtain B2 × A1= b2. Thus, the CT process from MAPbI3 to ZnO can selectively enhance the nontotally symmetric vibrational mode (b2) of MPY molecules through the Herzberg–Teller effect. Considering the fitted band shape and the magnitude of the intensity change, the band at 1241 cm−1 was chosen to sense the CT trend in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction.
 Fig. 5  Energy level diagram of the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction under 532 nm laser excitation (a); energy level diagram of the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction with different perovskite precursor ratios of 1.7, 1.0, 0.65, and 0.65 after annealing at 150 °C for 45 min, respectively (b). 
Based on the above conclusions, we also investigated the effect of the PbI2-to-MAI ratio on the CT process at the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction with the SERS technique. One unique property of perovskite is that its formation involves the reaction between an organic precursor and an inorganic precursor. Therefore, the composition of the perovskite can be largely tuned by self-doping. Both stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric PbI2-to-MAI ratios were used for the preparation of the perovskite layer. By changing the PbI2/MAI ratio in the precursor solution, the CBO value varied with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) position of MAPbI3. According to previous XRD studies,46 the precursor ratio that leads to a stoichiometric perovskite film is above 0.52 (the molar ratio of PbI2/MAI). Two other molar ratios of PbI2/MAI of 1.7 and 0.65 were chosen to fabricate the MAPbI3 film. Meanwhile, due to the low dissociation energy, MAPbI3 is not thermally stable at temperatures above 150 °C with the evaporation of MAI. Thermal annealing was also chosen to further confirm the sensitivity of SERS in sensing CT in ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunctions. The XRD patterns for the MAPbI3 films prepared with the different precursor ratios are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). With the increase of the proportion of methylamine in the precursor, the peak of the MAPbI3 crystal becomes stronger, while the composition of PbI2 decreases. After annealing, perovskite diffraction peaks show slight enhancement, while the diffraction peak of PbI2 reappears due to the volatilization of MAI. According to previous reports,23,47 the valence band and conduction band of ZnO are at approximately 7.5 eV and 4.1 eV, respectively. The energy levels of the four kinds of MAPbI3 were determined with UPS, as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), following previous reports.48,49 The ultraviolet–visible absorption spectra of all MAPbI3 perovskite films were measured to obtain the bandgap information (Fig. S6, ESI†). Through Tauc analyses, it was found that the four kinds of perovskite films have the same bandgap of 1.55 eV. As is widely known in thin-film compound solar cells, the energy level alignment between the ETL and PL is a decisive factor for carrier recombination at the interface, which can be quantitatively described by the CBO. As shown in Fig. 5b, the CBO for different precursor ratios of 1.7, 1, 0.65, and 0.65-annealed is 0.02, 0.14, 0.28 and 0.10 eV, respectively.
Normalized by the 1022 cm−1 band, the statistical results of the 1241 cm−1 band (b2) intensity with 10000 points as statistical objects are shown in Fig. 6a. Interestingly, the band intensity at 1241 cm−1 (b2) changes with the molar ratio of PbI2/MAI. The strongest b2-type bands are obtained at a PbI2/MAI molar ratio of 1.0. When the precursor ratio is reduced to 0.65, the band intensity at 1241 cm−1 (b2) is reduced. Concurrently, the band intensity at 1241 cm−1 (b2) shows a decrease as the precursor ratio increases to 1.7. The statistical results of the 1319 cm−1 (b2) band intensity in ZnO/MAPbI3 are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), which show a similar intensity trend. According to the UPS results, when the PbI2/MAI molar ratio is 1.0, the CBO value of ZnO/MAPbI3 is 0.14 eV. In conjunction with the XRD pattern (Fig. S5, ESI†), there is no obvious correlation between the crystal quality, the appearance of the second phase and the trend of charge transfer. Thus, we conclude that the strongest b2-type bands and the strongest CT process are obtained with the CBO at approximately 0.14 eV, which is consistent with the previous literature where the optimum CBO value is 0∼0.2 eV for PSCs.7 When the CT process was enhanced, the polarizability of intermediate MPY molecules was enhanced as well. For the heterojunctions with PbI2/MAI molar ratios of 1.7 and 0.65, the CBO values are 0.02 eV and 0.28 eV, respectively, which deviate from the optimal CBO value. Notably, the band intensity at 1241 cm−1 (b2) of MPY in the ZnO/0.65-annealed MAPbI3 heterojunction is obviously enhanced after annealing at 150 °C for 45 min. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that the CBO value approaches the optimum value as the MAI evaporates during the annealing process. The correlation between the b2-type band intensity and CBO value was further confirmed by a thermal annealing experiment, which also proves the sensitivity of SERS as a tool for sensing CT.
 Fig. 6  Statistical results of the 1241 cm−1 band (b2) intensity of MPY molecules in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction with 10000 points as statistical objects (a); steady-state photoluminescence spectra of MAPbI3 films with different precursor ratios on glass substrates (black line) and MPY-modified ZnO substrates (red line) (b); transient photoluminescence spectra of MAPbI3 films with different precursor ratios on MPY-modified ZnO substrates (c). 
Steady-state and transient photoluminescence spectra were also obtained to compare the CT process between different MAPbI3 films and ZnO. As shown in Fig. 6b, MAPbI3 films with precursor ratios of 1.7, 1.0, 0.65, and 0.65-annealed on MPY-modified ZnO substrates exhibit 56%, 70%, 51% and 61% photoluminescence quenching, respectively. As we mentioned above, the photoluminescence quenching can be well explained by the faster interfacial CT. Thus, the strongest CT process can be concluded to be obtained with a precursor ratio of MAPbI3 films of 1.0, which is consistent with the SERS results. As shown in Fig. 6c and Table S2 (ESI†), the shortest decay lifetime obtained in the ZnO/1.0-MAPbI3 heterojunction also proves a more efficient and faster CT process between ZnO and 1.0-MAPbI3, as the SERS spectra show. The longest decay lifetime occurs in the ZnO/0.65-MAPbI3 heterojunction, implying a weaker CT process, corresponding to the weak b2-type band in SERS (Fig. 6a). We also compared the absorbance of MAPbI3 at different compositions in Fig. S8 (ESI†), in which the MAPbI3 films with different compositions have similar absorbance. Thus, we conclude that the SERS spectra can achieve nondestructive sensing of interfacial CT processes in ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunctions from a microscopic perspective.
To quantitatively analyze the CT process in ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunctions with perovskites of different compositions, we calculated the CT degree (ρCT) with SERS, which is usually used to estimate the contribution of the CT process to Raman enhancement. More details are shown in the ESI.† As Fig. 7 shows, the trend of ρCT of the 1241 cm−1 band (b2) positively correlates to that of the photoluminescence quenching efficiency (obtained from Fig. 6b) and the band intensity at 1241 cm−1 and negatively correlates to the photoluminescence decay lifetime, which further confirms the effectiveness of SERS as a powerful tool to observe the CBO-driven CT process through the change trend of b2-type bands.
 Fig. 7  The change trends of photoluminescence lifetime, CT degree, photoluminescence quenching efficiency and band intensity at 1241 cm−1 as functions of the precursor ratio (PbI2/MAI). 
Additionally, the heterojunction has the greatest CT when the CBO is ∼0.14 eV, which is confirmed by the SERS, steady-state and transient photoluminescence at the same time.
When the precursor ratio is changed, the film coverage of the perovskite is also changed. As shown in Fig. 8a, in ZnO/MAPbI3-1.7 heterojunction, the MAPbI3 film was coated on the surface of ZnO nanorods in the form of nanorod bundles.50 As the MAI ratio increases, MAPbI3 appears as a larger range of nanorod bundles in ZnO/MAPbI3-1.0. When the MAI component content increased slightly, MAI began to dissolve as a solvent and coordinate PbI2, resulting in the disappearance of nanorod bundle morphology in ZnO/MAPbI3-0.65, and the appearance of perovskite disk morphology with the increase of surface coverage. After the thermal annealing process, the film coverage rate of MAPbI3 is reduced again because of the evaporation of MAI. The highest film coverage was observed when the ratio was 0.65 (Fig. 8a), however the lowest charge transfer trend was observed when the ratio was 0.65 (Fig. 7). Therefore, we can conclude that the energy level alignment is the main factor affecting the interfacial CT in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction. SERS mapping images of ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunctions with different precursor ratios were also obtained to investigate whether SERS could provide film coverage information. As shown in Fig. 8b, limited by the test conditions, the change trend of the SERS signal distribution uniformity is roughly the same as that in the SEM images. From a ratio of 1.7 to 0.65, the SERS signal distribution tends to become more uniform. After thermal annealing, the SERS signal of ZnO/MAPbI3-0.65-annealed is enhanced because of its more suitable CBO value compared with that of ZnO/MAPbI3-0.65. However, its SERS signal also exhibits greater inhomogeneity, which is in accordance with its SEM image. Thus, in addition to providing information on the CT intensity of the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction, SERS can also provide information on the uniformity of the CT distribution. We hope that the SERS images with higher resolution will provide more powerful help in screening more CT-effective heterojunctions.

Conclusions
In this work, SERS spectroscopy was taken as a powerful tool to sense the CT process in ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunctions. Compared with the ZnO substrate, the b2-type bands of MPY molecules are selectively enhanced in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction, which can be attributed to the CT process between ZnO and the MAPbI3 film. The effect of the PbI2-to-MAI ratio on the CT process at the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction was also investigated using the SERS technique. By controlling the precursor ratio of PbI2/MAI, the electronic energy levels in MAPbI3 films were aligned. As the CBO changes in the ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunction, different CT trends in ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunctions were observed by comparing the b2-type band intensities of the SERS probe molecules. When the precursor ratio of PbI2/MAI is 1.0, the CBO is 0.14 eV, at which we obtain the strongest b2-type bands. The sensitivity of SERS as a tool for sensing CT at ZnO/MAPbI3 heterojunctions was further confirmed by a thermal annealing experiment. These results provide new insights for optimizing the performance of solar cells and suggest the possibility of using SERS spectroscopy to realize rapid and nondestructive identification of the CT process in heterojunctions.
