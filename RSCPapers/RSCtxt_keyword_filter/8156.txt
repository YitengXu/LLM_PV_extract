    , Accepted 5th February 2016First published on 5th February 2016AbstractWe demonstrate spray coating of graphene ink as a viable method for large-area fabrication of graphene-based dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) modules. A graphene-based ink produced by liquid phase exfoliation of graphite is spray coated onto a transparent conductive oxide substrate to realize a large area (>90 cm2) semi-transparent (transmittance 44%) counter-electrode (CE) replacing platinum, the standard CE material. The graphene-based CE is successfully integrated in a large-area (43.2 cm2 active area) DSSC module achieving a power conversion efficiency of 3.5%. The approach demonstrated here paves the way to all-printed, flexible, and transparent graphene-based large-area and cost-effective photovoltaic devices on arbitrary substrates.
1. Introduction
The development of any photovoltaic (PV) technology is linked to the possibility to scale-up lab-cell prototypes to the size required by the specific application. Currently, PV devices are exploited in different contexts such as conventional PV plants, building integrated PV (BIPV),1–3 space solar power,4,5 energy harvesting for sensors and other information and communication technology devices,6,7etc. Nowadays, PV technology is largely based on silicon solar cells,8 showing power conversion efficiency (η) of the order of ∼25%.9 Driven by the need for cost savings,10 second generation PVs based on thin film crystalline (c-Si)11 and amorphous12 silicon (a-Si), copper indium gallium diselenide13 and cadmium telluride14 have been developed. However, degradation (e.g., a-Si modules suffer the Staebler–Wronski effect)15 and environmental pollution due to hazardous by-products16 have pushed the research towards the development of third generation PV cells with the aim to achieve higher η than silicon solar cells by using novel light absorbing materials.17,18 Meso-super-structured solar cells19 based on an organic halide perovskite as photosensitizer20 and an organic hole-transport material21 with η of 21% have been recently developed.22 However, despite the easy fabrication techniques,23 perovskites may not satisfy sustainability requirements, due to their lead content. Another class of PV cells known as organic PV cells24 are emerging as a cost effective approach being based on cheaper and more advanced manufacturing processes, e.g., roll-to-roll25 and other coating/deposition techniques,26 as compared with Si technology. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs)27 are another class of third generation PV technology that have recently achieved η values over 14%.28
Dye-sensitized solar cells have great potential for large-scale applications, both economically and technically. In fact, they demonstrate high η values under diffuse light29 and low illumination conditions,30 together with a reduced angular dependence of η.31 Moreover, the possibility to realize DSSCs with on-demand colour and transparency32 make them well-suited for both indoor applications33 and BIPVs.34,35 In this context, although BIPVs based on silicon PV and thin film technologies36 are largely used in solar park and rooftop applications,37,38 they are not suitable for integration into windows other than shading elements due to the difficulties in tuning color and/or transparency.
A typical DSSC is assembled by placing an electrolyte, either liquid or solid,39 containing a redox system in between the photoanode, consisting of high porosity nanocrystalline nanoparticles (e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO2), zinc oxide (ZnO),40 or hybrid materials e.g. TiO2/ZnO41) sensitized by dye molecules (photosensitizer of organic42–44 or inorganic27,45,46 nature, see ref. 47 for a review), and the counter electrode (CE).27 The latter has a double role: it back transfers electrons arriving from the external circuit to the redox system27 and it catalyzes the reduction of the charge mediator.27 In order to fulfil such functions, the CEs should exhibit high exchange-current density (i.e., the rate of electron transfer between electrolyte and electrode), low charge-transfer resistance Rct (i.e. the electrode–electrolyte interface resistance), and high specific surface area (SSA).47
Counter electrodes are commonly composed of ∼15–20 nm thick Pt layer,27 deposited onto transparent conductor oxides (TCOs) or, more rarely, on stainless steel.48 However, Pt has several issues. First of all, it has limited reserves on earth and it is costly.49 Furthermore, from the technical point of view, Pt suffers degradation over time, especially when in contact with the I3−/I− liquid electrolyte,50 and it tends to induce formation of polyiodites,51 strongly reducing the η value of DSSCs. The aforementioned issues have boosted47,52,53 efforts towards the replacement of Pt with cheaper and/or more stable materials.
In this context, carbon-based nanomaterials have been at the centre of an ongoing research effort for their use as catalyst in DSSCs.54 However, DSSCs based on graphite,55 carbon nanotubes (CNTs),48,56 amorphous carbon57 and hard carbon spherules (HCS)55 as catalyst materials have, to date, shown lower η values than the ones achieved with Pt. Graphene, thanks to its large SSA exceeding 2600 m2 g−1,58 much larger than that reported to date for carbon black (∼900 m2 g−1 (ref. 59)) or for CNTs, ≈100–1000 m2 g−1,58 and similar to activated carbon (carbon processed with oxygen to make it porous),60 high mechanical strength and61 electrical conductivity (σ)62 values, can satisfy all the CE requirements. Moreover, the ease of functionalization,63 together with optical transparency64 and the potential for mass production,26 makes graphene an ideal platform for PV applications (e.g., as transparent conductors (TCs),65 photosensitizers,66,67 channels for charge transport68–70) as well as for other conversion and storage devices.71
Graphene-based materials, such as graphene nanoplatelets – GNPs (sheets of functionalized graphene with an overall thickness ranging from ∼2 nm to ∼15 nm),72 nitrogen-doped GNPs,73 reduced graphene oxide (RGO)74–77 and hybrid structures of RGO–GNPs–CNTs78,79 have been exploited not just to develop Pt-free CEs with η values close to or exceeding the ones based on Pt, but also to improve the electron transport of the photoanode.80 Indeed, a new record high of DSSCs (η = 14.3%) has been achieved exploiting GNPs in combination with gold and fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) at the CE.28 However, the hybrid structure used (GNP–gold–FTO) for the realization of the CE is based on a noble and expensive metal, i.e., gold.28 Other inorganic layered materials LMs – such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), transition metal oxides (TMOs) and metal carbides, nitrides and sulfides81 as well as hybrid systems, such as graphene–MoS2,82 have been tested as CE in DSSCs; however, with lower η values than for state of the art DSSCs.28 Moreover, the aforementioned materials require post-processing treatments such as RGO and more costly materials (e.g., CNTs, TMDs and TMOs) as compared with pristine graphite.
Graphene can be produced both by top-down83–89 and bottom-up90–94 approaches. However, the latter processes require high temperatures (>1000 °C),81–84 costly substrates26 and additional transfer processes to the target substrates.26 Thus, the top-down approach is emerging as the most promising in view of large volume production.95 In particular, by solution processing it is possible to produce single (SLG) and few-layer (FLG) graphene flakes starting from either oxidized77,78 or pristine graphite,83,96 as well as from expanded graphite for the realization of GNPs. Graphene oxide, produced by exfoliation of graphite oxide,85–87 can be mass-produced at room temperature (RT).85,86 However, it is insulating,87 with defects87 and gap states,87,97 not offering optimal charge transfer for electrons arriving from the external circuit to the redox system. Solution processing also offers the possibility to produce other LMs (e.g., TMDs, TMO, etc.)98 exploiting similar production protocols. Moreover, by solution processing it is possible to produce dispersions83 and inks,96,99–102 which can easily be deposited on large area target substrates (by drop casting, filtration75 and/or printing/coating processes91–94) without the need for tedious transfer protocols required by the bottom-up approaches.26 This is key for the exploitation of graphene in applications where large volume and/or large area films/electrodes are needed.
Here, we demonstrate the printability of graphene inks in dimethylformamide (DMF) on large area TCO (>90 cm2) by spray coating. Tackling the long lasting issues with the scaling-up from small size cells (∼1 cm2) to large area modules, usually associated with a reduction of performance (i.e., η), even more critical in DSSCs103 due to the management of the liquid electrolyte, we demonstrated the fabrication of large area module (43.2 cm2 active area) DSSCs based on the graphene CE. In this work, we designed and fabricated a DSSC Z-type connection module with ad hoc vertical contacts layout, in term of width and thickness to prevent voltage loss due to large electrical resistance value in the connection of adjacent cells. Moreover, we designed a sealing mask to prevent the corrosion of the vertical metal contacts by the electrolyte. Our DSSC module has achieved an η of 3.5% at 1 Sun, i.e., 100 mW cm−2. If compared with Pt, our graphene-based ink allows for a cost reduction of ∼4 order of magnitudes. Given that material cost and deposition systems play a key role for the development of large area module, the optimization of production/formulation of graphene-based inks and their deposition on both rigid and flexible substrates will enable further scaling up, thus paving the way for the development of carbon-based DSSC technology.
2. Experimental
2.1. Preparation of graphene ink
The graphene ink used in this work was prepared by dispersing 200 mg of Graphite flakes (Sigma Aldrich Ltd) in 20 ml of DMF (Sigma Aldrich Ltd). The initial dispersion was then ultrasonicated (Branson 3510) for 6 hours and subsequently ultracentrifuged using a SW-41 swinging bucket rotor in a Beckman-Coulter Optima XPN ultracentrifuge at 20000 rpm (∼61000g) for 30 min. After ultracentrifugation, the supernatant was extracted by pipetting.

2.1.1. Characterization of graphene ink. 
The concentration of graphitic flakes in the as prepared ink was determined from the absorption spectrum, as described in ref. 83. Absorption measurements were carried out with a Jasco V-550 UV-Vis. The viscosity of the ink was measured with a Discovery HR-2 Hybrid Rheometer (TA instruments), using a double-wall concentric cylinders geometry (inner diameter of 32 mm and outer diameter of 35 mm), designed for low-viscosity fluids. The temperatures of the graphene ink and the DMF solvent were set and maintained at 25 °C throughout all the measurements.
For Raman measurements, the graphene ink was diluted with DMF and drop-casted onto a Si wafer with 300 nm thermally grown SiO2. Raman measurements were carried out with a Renishaw 1000 at 532 nm and a 100× objective, with an incident power of ∼1 mW. The D, G and 2D peaks were fitted with Lorentzian functions.
The as prepared ink was also drop casted at RT onto carbon coated copper TEM grids (300 mesh) and rinsed with DI water. TEM images were taken with a Zeiss Libra 120 transmission electron microscope, operated at 120 kV and equipped with an in-column omega filter. All the images and the diffraction patterns were energy filtered with a 15 eV slit on the zero loss peak.

2.2. Counter-electrodes fabrication via spray coating graphene ink
Graphene flakes dispersed in DMF were sprayed (N2 gas carrier) onto TCO (FTO coated glass 2.2 mm thick, 8 Ω □−1, 25 mm × 25 mm) substrate. The small area CE was 25 mm × 25 mm, while the large area CE was 84 mm × 110 mm. During the deposition, the substrate temperature was heated at 100 °C, the distance between substrate and aerograph was approximately 15 cm and the ink flux was continued during the deposition. The amount of graphene ink deposited onto FTO was 0.5 ml cm−2. The substrate was then transferred under inert atmosphere (N2) for annealing at 400 °C for 60 min. For the PT-based CE, we deposited the Pt paste (Chimet) by screen printing onto the FTO.

2.2.1. Counter-electrodes characterization. 
The as prepared electrodes were characterized by optical absorption and Raman spectroscopies. Transmittance measurement were carried out by a Shimadzu UV-Vis 2550 spectrophotometer coupled to an integrating sphere. Raman measurements were instead carried out in the same experimental conditions reported for the characterization of the inks, see section 2.1.1.

2.3. Dye sensitizer solar cell and symmetry dummy cell fabrication
To test the performance of graphene flakes as CE in small area devices, we fabricated the DSSC as follows. The photoanodes were realized by stamping onto the TCO (see detail in section 2.2) a TiO2 paste (18 NR-T, Dyesol) with a dry thickness, measured via profilometer (Dektak Veeco 150), of 6–7 μm (active area 5 mm × 5 mm). The as produced photoanodes were first left to dry in an oven at 90 °C and then sintered at 480 °C and afterward immerged in a 0.3 mM N719 dye ethanol solution. The graphene-based CE was fabricated following the procedure detailed in section 2.2. The solar cell chamber, resulting from the sandwiching of the photoanode and CE, was filled with the I3−/I− electrolyte EL-HPE (Dyesol).
For electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements we fabricated a symmetric dummy cell. We used two identical CEs made of TCO substrates (details specified in section 2.2) covered with both graphene nanoflakes and Pt (see section 2.2 for details) and sealed with thermoplastic resin (25 μm thick Surlyn, Solaronix). The I3−/I− electrolyte (HSE-electrolyte, Dyesol) was then filled in between the two symmetric CEs. The active area of 1.44 cm2 and 0.25 cm2 was realized cutting a square of thermoplastic mask for the graphene and Pt CEs, respectively. The measurements are carried out at RT, in dark and at bias voltage of 0 V.104,105
2.4. Module fabrication
We used 2.2 mm-thick FTO/glass substrates (Pilkington, 8 Ω □−1) both as the photoanode (84 mm × 100 mm) and CE support (84 mm × 110 mm). The substrates after cleaning with ethanol and acetone were scribed by a CO2 Laser System, Universal Laser System to separate a single cell of module. Dupont 7713 silver paste was deposited via screen printing for the realization of the interconnections between the cells forming the module. The CE glass after drying at 90 °C in oven for 15 min, was sintered in oven at 480° for 30 min. On the photoanode glass after drying at 90 °C in oven, instead we deposited via screen printing technique 8 cells (single cell area 5.4 cm2, 6 mm in width and 90 mm in length, resulting in a total active area of 43.2 cm2) of TiO2 paste (20 nm sized TiO2 particles, Dyesol 18 NR-T). The photoanode substrate was dried in oven at 80 °C followed by sintering at 480 °C for 30 min. The TiO2 layer thickness was measured via profilometer (Dektak Veeco 150) resulting ∼6–7 μm thick. The nanoporous TiO2 was sensitized by immersing it in a N719 0.3 mM ethanol dye solution at RT. Bynel foils 60 μm thick (Solaronix) were used to seal module and electrolyte. EL-HPE (Dyesol) or EL-HSE (Dyesol) was injected through the hole in the surlyn mask on the short edge of each cell, which was subsequently sealed with a resin. The Pt-based reference DSSC module was fabricated following the procedure outlined above, with the only difference relying in the deposition of the Pt paste (Chimet) carried out by screen printer after the deposition and curing of the Ag interconnection. The as prepared CE was then cured at 480 °C for 30 min.
2.5. Characterization
The photovoltaic performance of all devices was measured under a Class B Sun Simulator (Solar Constant 1200 KHS) at AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 and 17 mW cm−2 calibrated with a Skye SKS 1110 sensor, using a Keithley 2420 as a source-meter in ambient conditions. The sun simulator is class B in the visible and near-infrared range (class B between 700–800 nm and class A in the rest of the 400–1100 nm range) and has a spatial uniformity <±5%. Sun simulator spectrum was measured with a BLACK-Comet UV-VIS Spectrometer (range 190–900 nm).
For EIS measurement to investigate the Rct of electrolyte/catalytic interface we utilized AUTOLAB 302N potentiostat (Metrohm) and Nova electrochemical interface system with all measurements carried out in dark at 0 V and at RT. The frequency was in the 20 Hz–1 MHz range and the amplitude of the a.c. voltage was 10 mV.
3. Results and discussion
Graphene-based ink is prepared via low-power ultrasonication of graphite in DMF. The choice of graphite exfoliation in DMF is set by the need of having the best contact at the inter-flake junctions upon deposition on the electrode, which could be affected by the surfactant coverage in aqueous solutions,106,107 and by the lower boiling point (153 °C)108 with respect to N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (202 °C),109 one of the best solvent for the exfoliation and dispersion of graphitic flakes.83,88,96 The ultrasonication process induces exfoliation of the graphitic flakes83 producing a heterogeneous dispersion of thin/thick and small/large graphitic flakes.26
We exploit sedimentation-based separation (SBS) to sort graphitic flakes by lateral size.88 The rate of sedimentation of a graphitic flake in a centrifugal field is described by the Svedberg equation:110 s = v/ω2r = m(1 − υρ)/f(1)where s is the sedimentation coefficient reported in Svedberg (S) units (1S corresponds to 10−13 s.),110m the mass, υ the partial specific volume (the volume that each gram of the graphitic flake occupies in solution), ρ the density of the solvent and f the frictional coefficient which depends on the morphological properties (lateral size and thickness) of the graphitic flakes and the viscosity of the solvent. In general, f increases as the particle geometry moves away from a spherical shape, which means that large or elongated particles experience more frictional drag than compact, smooth spherical ones.88,128 The value of s depends on the morphological properties of the particle being proportional to the buoyant effective molar weight of the particle, while it is inversely proportional to f.110 As reported in eqn (1), the sedimentation of graphitic flakes depends on the frictional coefficient and mass.26,88 Thick and large flakes, having larger mass, sediment faster with respect to thin and small flakes (having smaller mass), which are thus retained in dispersion.26
3.1. Characterization of graphene-based ink
The rheological properties of the as formulated inks were characterized by means of optical absorption spectroscopy (OAS) and viscosity measurements under shear conditions. We use OAS in order to evaluate the concentration (c) of graphitic material in the ink.

Fig. 1a plots the OAS of the ink prepared via SBS. The UV absorption peak at ∼266 nm is attributed to inter-band electronic transitions from the unoccupied π* states at the M point of the Brillouin zone.111,112 The asymmetry of the UV peak, with a high-wavelength tail, is attributed to excitonic effects.112,113 Using the experimentally derived absorption coefficient of 1390 L g−1 m−1 at 660 nm83 we estimate c ∼ 60 mg L−1. Concerning the viscosity of our ink, the inset to Fig. 1a shows the viscosity of the ink, as well as that of pure DMF for comparison, under shear stress. The ink has ν = 1.02 mPa s, which is only ∼8% higher than the solvent (0.93 mPa s),114 probably due to the low concentration (c ∼ 60 mg L−1) of the graphene-ink. The viscosity of the graphene-based ink, as well as the pure DMF, is almost independent of the shear rate, at least in the shear rate range here investigated, a behaviour typical of a Newtonian fluid (i.e., a fluid, such as water and solvents, in which the viscosity arising from its flow is linearly proportional to the strain rate).115
 Fig. 1  (a) Room temperature absorption spectrum of the graphene ink. Inset: viscosity of the produced inks vs. shear rate for DMF (green curve) and DMF–graphene ink (black curve). (b) Bright field TEM images of a graphene flake at low magnification. Inset: electron diffraction pattern collected on an area of 2 μm in diameter. The 10–10 and 11–20 polycrystalline diffraction rings of graphene are clearly visible. The rings are formed by strong spots corresponding to the larger flakes and a background of weaker unresolved spots associated with smaller flakes.117 
The morphological properties of the graphene flakes dispersed in the ink are characterized by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy.

Fig. 1(b) plots a low-resolution TEM bright field image of a flake deposited on the TEM grid. The sample is formed by flakes having average dimensions in the range ∼0.01–0.02 μm2. Electron diffraction collected on flake aggregates shows polycrystalline rings demonstrating that the flakes are crystalline. All the rings can be indexed as h,k,−h−k,0 reflections of a hexagonal lattice with a = 0.244(1) nm, in agreement with the graphene structure.116
Raman spectroscopy is a fast and non-destructive technique to identify number of layers, doping, defects, disorder, chemical modifications and edges of graphitic flakes.117,118 In a typical Raman spectrum of graphene, the two main peaks are the G peak, corresponding to the E2g phonon at the Brillouin zone centre,117,118 and the D peak, which is due to the breathing modes of sp2 rings and requires a defect for its activation by double resonance.118 The 2D peak is the second order of the D peak, as it is a single peak in monolayer graphene, but it splits in four components in bi-layer graphene, thus reflecting the evolution of the band structure.118 Because no defects are required for the activation of two phonons with the same momentum, one backscattered from the other, the 2D peak is always seen, even in the absence of D peak.118
Double resonance can also happen as an intra-valley process, i.e. connecting two points belonging to the same cone around K or K′,117 giving rise to the D′ peak. The 2D′ is the second order of the D′, and as in the case of the 2D peak is always seen, even in the absence of D′ peak.
Statistical analysis of the micro-Raman spectra (Fig. 2a) shows that the 2D peak is at Pos(2D) ∼2691 cm−1 (Fig. 2b), while the FWHM(2D) varies from 60 to 95 cm−1 with a peak at ∼80 cm−1 (Fig. 2c) and I(2D)/I(G) varies from 0.75 to 1.30 (Fig. 2d). This is consistent with the sample being a combination of SLG and FLG flakes. The Raman spectra show significant D and D′ peaks intensity, with an average intensity ratio I(D)/I(G) ∼1.50 (see Fig. 2e) and I(D′)/I(G) ∼0.35. This is attributed to the edges of our nanometer flakes, rather than to structural defects on the basal plane of SLG and FLG flakes.
 Fig. 2  (a) Raman spectra of graphene inks in DMF. (b–h) Statistic of Raman analysis of graphene ink. Distribution of (b) Pos(2D), (c) FWHM(2D), (d) I(2D)/I(G), (e) I(D)/I(G), (f) FWHM(G), (g) Pos(G) and (h) I(D)/I(G) as a function of FWHM(G). 
This observation is supported by the analysis of I(D)/I(G) (Fig. 2e), FWHM(G) (Fig. 2f) and Pos(G) (Fig. 2g). Indeed, combining I(D)/I(G) with FWHM(G) allows us to discriminate between disorder localized at the edges and disorder in the bulk. In the latter case, a higher I(D)/I(G) would correspond to higher FWHM(G). I(D)/I(G) and FWHM(G) are not correlated, as shown in Fig. 2h, an indication that the major contribution to the D peak comes from the sample edges. Moreover, in the high-defect concentration regime FWHM(G) and FWHM(D′) become broader and eventually merge into a single band.117
3.2. Counter-electrodes
Graphene flakes are then deposited on FTO substrates (see Methods for details) by spray-coating (Fig. 3a), a technique widely used for depositing thin films on a substrate.119 This technique is widely used in the industrial coating, painting and graphic arts,120 and it has been also exploited to fabricate RGO-based transparent conductive films.121 In the spray deposition process, the overall quality of the coating is determined both by the rheological properties of the ink such as density, surface tension and viscosity, as we have discussed before for the characterization of our ink, and by other process parameters, such as the spray pressure and distance to the sample, spray time and temperature, as well as the physico-chemical characteristics of the substrate.119

We deposited graphene ink in DMF on FTO substrate kept at a temperature of 100 °C, as shown in Fig. 3a (see Methods for more details). Considering a concentration of 60 mg L−1 for our graphene ink, see Fig. 1a, we can estimate a loading of graphene flakes of ∼30 μg cm−2 onto the CE. After the deposition is complete, the substrate is thermally treated at 400 °C for 60 min, under N2 atmosphere. The as produced graphene-based CEs (see Fig. 3b) are then characterized by absorption and Raman spectroscopy. Fig. 3c shows that the fabricated graphene-based CE has a transmittance of ∼43% including the FTO substrate (transmittance FTO ∼80%) at 550 nm. Note that the commonly used wavelength for the optical characterization of TCs is 550 nm where the human eye is most sensitive.64 This transmittance value renders the CE semitransparent, as demonstrated by the photograph in Fig. 3b.
The as-produced CE is also characterized by Raman spectroscopy in order to monitor the quality of the flakes composing the CE. Fig. 4a compares a typical Raman spectrum measured at 532 nm for a flake deposited onto SiO2 substrate from the ink, with that of the graphene–FTO electrode. Fig. 4b–e compare Pos(2D) and FWHM(2D) distributions. The graphene–FTO electrode has a larger distribution of both Pos(2D) (between ∼2692 cm−1 and ∼2702 cm−1) and FWHM(2D) (peak at ∼80 cm−1), with respect to the graphene flakes. However, the 2D peak still shows a Lorentzian lineshape distinctly different from that of graphite. This implies that the flakes are SLG or, if FLG, they are electronically almost decoupled and behave, to a first approximation, as a collection of SLGs.

3.3. Electrochemical properties
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, i.e., the measurement of the linear electrical response for the evaluation of the physico-chemical properties of the electrochemical system under investigation, is exploited to evaluate/quantify the catalytic activity of DSSC CEs and carried out in dummy cell configuration (see section 2.3 for details and Fig. 5a for a schematic representation). In such configuration, a thin layer of electrolyte solution is sandwiched between two identical electrodes to be tested as DSSC CEs. The symmetrical dummy cell configuration permits to investigate both the electrochemical activity and stability of a CE, under simulated DSSC operating conditions, but with the advantage of eliminating the photoanode contribution.104,122–124
 Fig. 5  (a) Schematic of dummy cell for EIS measurements. (b) Nyquist plots of FTO (red line) and FTO–graphene (black line) CEs measured in the 20 Hz–1 MHz range. In the inset is reported the EIS plot of dummy cell fabricated with Pt CE. (c) Equivalent circuit used for data fitting. (d) Tafel plot for dummy cell assembled with FTO, FTO/graphene and FTO/Pt. 
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy data are represented by a complex plane (Nyquist plot) that includes the imaginary impedance (Y-axes) that represents the capacitive and inductive behaviour of the cell against the real impedance (X-axes). In the plot, each point represents the impedance value at a defined frequency (data associated to low frequency scan are reported on the right side of the plot while the ones linked to higher frequency are on the left part).125–127 Typically, a Nyquist plot of the symmetrical dummy cell exhibits two semicircles.127 The first one at high frequency (KHz–MHz range) is attributed to the catalyst/electrolyte interface,125 while the second one, shifted toward lower frequency (Hz range), is linked with ionic diffusion processes in the electrolyte.125
The Nyquist plot of our symmetrical dummy cell (see Fig. 5b), composed by I3−/I− liquid electrolyte sandwiched in between two graphene-based electrodes, measured in the 20 Hz–1 MHz range, displays the first semicircle. The width of this semicircle, along the X-axis, gives indication about the Rct (i.e. the electrode–electrolyte interface resistance). Large semicircle is synonymous with large Rct value and vice-versa.128 The intercept with the X-axis of the first semicircle represents Rs, the ohmic resistance of the electrolyte and the resistance of external circuit included TCO resistance,128 here estimated to be ∼18 Ω.
The scheme of the circuit used for the determination of Rct is shown in Fig. 5c. Here, CPE represents the constant phase element associated with the CE–electrolyte interface, describing deviation from the ideal capacitance,128 Zn represents the Nernst diffusion impedance of triiodide in the electrolyte solution,128 while Zpore is the Nernst diffusion impedance in the pores of the electrode material.75 The parameter Zpore was introduced for functionalized graphene contacting an I3−/I− electrolyte solution.75 However, to this parameter is associated a third semicircle at high frequency on Nyquist plot, which we do not detect in our measurements and consequently it was neglected.128 A performant CE should have both low Rct and high catalytic activity.129 The inset to Fig. 5b shows the EIS plot for a dummy cell fabricated with Pt (Rct = 2 Ω cm2). A large value of Rct (>10 kΩ cm2) measured for the CE made of only FTO is a clear fingerprint of its poor catalytic activity.130 After the spray deposition of the graphene ink, we have not detected any change in the Rs value (∼18 Ω), while, on the contrary, we have seen that Rct decreased to 650 Ω cm2, with respect to the value of FTO CE. As reported in the literature,122 graphene-based CEs (i.e., GNPs) have shown low catalytic activity with iodide-based electrolytes if compared with cobalt based mediators.122 The low catalytic activity of graphene-based CEs with iodide-based electrolytes is highlighted by the high Rct, which is reflected in the low FF in solar cell devices under strong illumination conditions.
To better understand the electrochemical activity of the CE/mediator interface, in Fig. 5d we show the Tafel plot, a logarithmic current density (J) as a function of voltage for the dummy cells with (FTO/graphene) and without (FTO) graphene and compared with the one with Pt (FTO/Pt), used as reference. In the curve at high potential (horizontal part), it is possible to derive the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim). Jlim is determined by the diffusion properties of the redox couple and the activity of the CE catalysts.131Fig. 5d shows a poor catalytic activity of the FTO-based CE. In contrast, graphene-flakes spray deposited onto a FTO substrate show catalytic activity towards the redox system, producing a Jlim of 14.9 mA cm−2. However, this value is still lower than for the FTO/Pt CE (60.5 mA cm−2). The latter suggests a higher diffusion coefficient (D) compared to that of graphene CE according to eqn (2): D = (l/2nFC)Jlim(2)where l is the spacer thickness of the dummy cell, n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of triiodide at the electrode, F is the Faraday constant, and C is the triiodide concentration.132 However, more work is still needed to fully understand the catalytic properties of graphene with the I3−/I− charge mediator.
3.4. Photo-electrochemistry performance
The performance of graphene ink on DSSC CEs is first tested on a small area (0.25 cm2) device to monitor the feasibility of the process, namely to test the catalytic activity of graphene flakes before scaling up the device to solar module. The small area DSSC fabrication process is reported in section 2.3. We have tested the DSSCs under two illumination conditions (1 Sun and 0.17 Sun = 17 mW cm−2). In Fig. 6 (left side axis) we report the J/V curve at 1 Sun, achieving η = 3.6%, open circuit voltage (Voc) = 711 mV, short-circuit current density (Jsc) = 14.8 mA cm−2 and field factor (FF) = 34.7%. The large Rct value (650 Ω cm2) of the graphene-based CE influences the J–V shape close to the Voc showing an S-shape characteristic which affects the FF and consequently the η. However, such S-shape characteristic is reduced in low light conditions, i.e., 0.17 Sun (right hand side axis of Fig. 6) bringing to a better photovoltaic) performance than 1 Sun, with η = 4.9%, Voc = 670 mV, Jsc = 2.4 mA cm−2 and FF = 51.6%. As reported in the literature,33 DSSC technology presents better performance (i.e., FF and η values) at low lighting illumination conditions. Although Jsc generally decreases at low illumination due to lower photo-generated current and Voc subsequently decreases logarithmically, both the FF and η values increase as a result of the reduction of charge recombination rate.133 In our case, the S-shape behaviour is less marked at 0.17 Sun with respect to the full illumination conditions (1 Sun), because the photo-generated current can be better sustained by the catalytic properties of the graphene flakes, in agreement with the electrochemical results reported in the previous section.

Several strategies have been proposed to improve the catalytic properties of graphene and consequently to reduce the S-shape behaviour such as graphene on a Ni nanoparticles-based layer134 and graphene with Pt nanoparticles.135 In the following sections, however, we will focus only on pristine graphene flakes being promising for indoor applications and avoiding, at the same time, possible instabilities of the catalysts due to the presence of Ni or Pt nanoparticles.51
Having tested the photovoltaic and electrochemical performances of our graphene flakes-based ink, we now demonstrate the scalability of our approach to printed large-area modules. Fig. 7a shows a photograph of the photoanode module, left hand side, with sensitized active area and silver vertical contact. On the right hand side of the photograph, the CE module after the spray coating deposition of the graphene flakes-based ink. Fig. 7b shows the sandwich-type assembled module comprising the photoanode and CE (>90 cm2) substrate. Fig. 7c and d show the J–V curves of large area DSSC modules under different illumination conditions (1 Sun and 0.17 Sun). We compare the photovoltaic performance of a module fabricated with Pt (used as reference) with those fabricated with graphene ink as CE. We considered two different iodide-based electrolytes, namely the High Stability Electrolyte (HSE, Dyesol) able to guarantee the time stability of solar cells136 and the High Performant Electrolyte (HPE, Dyesol) able to guarantee high performance, i.e. η, of the solar cell.137 Although the Jsc value is typical of this dye/electrolyte combination137 as expected, (see Fig. 7c and d) the module with HPE outperforms the one with HSE. However, the increase of the value of η is dependent on the light intensity. In fact, the module with HPE has a 6% and 14% higher η with respect to the HSE-based one at 1 and 0.17 sun, respectively. In particular, Fig. 7d shows the J–V curve of single cells of a module fabricated with HSE where all the single cells, and the complete module curve, have the same Jsc (13.4 mA cm−2) confirming a good uniformity of the module's fabrication which prevents the unbalance in term of current of the module itself. All the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1.

We notice that for the same electrolyte (HPE) the Jsc of the graphene-based module is larger than the one with Pt, confirming the potential of graphene as catalyst for large area DSSC modules. In particular, taking into account the performance/cost ratio, the replacement of Pt with graphene flakes may result in ∼four orders of magnitude cost reduction (the costs are for materials only and based on Sigma-Aldrich prices available at http://www.sigmaaldrich.com), which, coupled with the easy deposition method, will enable further scaling up, thus paving the way to the development of carbon-based DSSC technology.
4. Conclusions
We demonstrated a large-area dye-sensitized solar cell module based on a spray-coated graphene ink counter electrode. We produced a graphene-based ink by liquid phase exfoliation of graphite in dimethylformamide. By using spray coating we deposited the graphene ink on a transparent conductive oxide substrate to realize a large area (∼90 cm2) counter-electrode with a transparency of 44%. The large area (43.2 cm2 active area) dye-sensitized solar cell module achieved a η value of 3.5%. In view of the performance/cost ratio of photovoltaic devices, the exploitation of graphene ink can be a viable alternative to current technology based on Pt. Moreover, the use of cobalt-based mediators could boost the performances of DSSC modules, as already demonstrated for lab-scale DSSC devices. Further optimization of graphene-based inks formulation and their deposition methods on both rigid and flexible substrates will pave the way to all-printed, flexible, transparent graphene-based photovoltaic devices on arbitrary substrates.

 	Fig. 1  (a) Room temperature absorption spectrum of the graphene ink. Inset: viscosity of the produced inks vs. shear rate for DMF (green curve) and DMF–graphene ink (black curve). (b) Bright field TEM images of a graphene flake at low magnification. Inset: electron diffraction pattern collected on an area of 2 μm in diameter. The 10–10 and 11–20 polycrystalline diffraction rings of graphene are clearly visible. The rings are formed by strong spots corresponding to the larger flakes and a background of weaker unresolved spots associated with smaller flakes.117	 

 	Fig. 2  (a) Raman spectra of graphene inks in DMF. (b–h) Statistic of Raman analysis of graphene ink. Distribution of (b) Pos(2D), (c) FWHM(2D), (d) I(2D)/I(G), (e) I(D)/I(G), (f) FWHM(G), (g) Pos(G) and (h) I(D)/I(G) as a function of FWHM(G).	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Spray coating graphene ink. The graphene ink is deposited through the air onto the FTO substrate by a spray gun. (b) Optical image of graphene-based counter electrode. (c) Optical transmittance of FTO (grey curve) and graphene-coated FTO substrate (black curve).	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) Representative Raman spectrum of flakes dispersed in the ink, compared with the spectrum taken on the glass substrate. Pos(2D) and FWHM(2D) for (b, c) flakes in the ink and (d, e) spray deposited on the FTO substrate.	 

 	Fig. 5  (a) Schematic of dummy cell for EIS measurements. (b) Nyquist plots of FTO (red line) and FTO–graphene (black line) CEs measured in the 20 Hz–1 MHz range. In the inset is reported the EIS plot of dummy cell fabricated with Pt CE. (c) Equivalent circuit used for data fitting. (d) Tafel plot for dummy cell assembled with FTO, FTO/graphene and FTO/Pt.
