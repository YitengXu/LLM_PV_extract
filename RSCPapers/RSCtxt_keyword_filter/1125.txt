    , Accepted 27th October 2017First published on 27th October 2017AbstractNew-generation solar cells based on colloidal lead chalcogenide (PbX) quantum dots (CQDs) are promising low-cost solution-processed photovoltaics. However, current state-of-the art CQDs are all using an inverted device architecture. The performance gap between CQD solar cells with conventional and inverted structures is much larger than that for other solution-processed photovoltaics such as organic and perovskite solar cells, which may restrict the future development of CQD solar cells. Here, we reported a record-high power conversion efficiency of 8.45% for conventionally structured PbS QD solar cells by the introduction of a unique conjugated polymer PDTPBT as the anode buffer layer. With the modification of the anode, the device performance was largely improved through a dramatic enhancement in open circuit voltage (Voc), which can be attributed to the enhanced hole extraction to the anode after PDTPBT modification. Meanwhile, the polymer layer can also efficiently improve charge separation and reduce interfacial charge recombination as well as reverse saturation current density, which result in significantly enhanced Voc. More importantly, our results proposed a new conventional architecture for QD solar cells which can avoid the complex processing of metal oxides and is free of light-soaking. This new device structure may offer more flexibility in future device design and show potential advantages in large-scale manufacturing by simplifying the fabrication process.
Introduction
Colloidal lead chalcogenide (PbX) quantum dot (CQD) materials are promising candidates for new generation photovoltaic devices due to their size-tunable bandgap, solution processing and multi-exciton generation effect.1–4 Propelled by extensive research on surface passivation5 and device architecture engineering,6 the reported power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CQD solar cells has been rapidly boosted up to 11.28% (certified).7 More importantly, compared to other kinds of solution-processed photovoltaic materials like organic and perovskite materials, CQDs show more advantages in the formation of dense and uniform films. Highly crystalline CQDs do not require additives or strict deposition conditions to finely control the film crystallization and morphology, which, however, is critical for the fabrication of perovskite and organic solar cells. This simple fabrication process may endow CQDs with a more advantageous position than other current competitors in the large-scale manufacturing of photovoltaic devices in the near future. In addition, the unique layer-by-layer deposition process for CQDs is beneficial for the fabrication of multi-junction solar cells.
Nowadays, the commonly used CQD devices are constructed by forming a rectifying junction between metal oxides (TiO2, ZnO, etc.) and CQD layers (PbS, PbSe, etc.), which can also be classified as having an inverted device configuration with fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) or indium tin oxide (ITO) as the cathode, TiO2 or ZnO as the electron-transporting material (ETM), CQDs as the active layer, molybdenum oxide (MoO3) as the hole-transporting material (HTM) and gold (Au) as the anode (cathode/ETM/CQDs/HTM/anode).8–12 Until now, CQD solar cells with PCE above 8% have all been constructed with an inverted device architecture. However, the typical high sintering temperature of TiO2 (>500 °C)8 increases the manufacturing cost and is incompatible for flexible substrates (<120 °C). Although ZnO nanocrystals can be deposited through solution processing at room temperature, they normally possess a high density of surface defects,13,14 leading to interfacial recombination in a CQD/n-type metal oxide heterojunction. Meanwhile, metal oxides require complicated re-engineering to guarantee appropriate band alignment when the CQD absorber is size-tuned to a different bandgap, which may also limit their application in multi-junction solar cells.15,16 More importantly, a long time light soaking process is usually required before device measurements to improve electron transport in metal oxides, otherwise non-optimal device performance and hysteresis may be observed.17–19
In organic solar cells (OSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs), inverted and conventional device structures have both been invented and widely used.20,21 For OSCs, conventional device structures have first been proposed and extensively studied. Then the adoption of inverted device structures was found to be critical for improving the photovoltaic performance and stability of certain organic materials.22,23 For perovskite solar cells, the recent invention of the conventional (planar heterojunction) device structure has simplified the fabrication process and reduced the hysteresis,24 largely boosting the development of perovskite solar cells. These studies revealed that the device structure can affect both solar cell efficiency and stability profoundly. In addition, more flexibility in device structures can greatly broaden the selection criteria for carrier transport materials and control their compatibility with active materials. Moreover, the adoption of different device structures gives more options for the design of multiple junction solar cells and may also facilitate the large-scale fabrication of solar cells.
For CQD solar cells, the inverted device structure employing metal oxides as ETMs has been the mostly adopted structure because of its mature fabrication process and high device performance. In comparison, CQD solar cells with a conventional device configuration have attracted little attention with PCE lagging significantly behind those of inverted devices. The original conventional devices adopted a simple Schottky junction structure without using metal oxide carrier transport layers.25 The reported PCEs of these devices, however, were less than 6% due to the innate limitation of the Schottky junction.6,26 Then doped CQDs were applied to construct a “quantum junction” for conventionally structured solar cells, showing improved PCE.16,27 The consequent implementation of a graded doping strategy further boosted the PCE to 7.4%,28 which is the highest PCE ever reported for conventional CQD solar cells. Nonetheless, compared to inverted devices with a record PCE of 11.28%, only very few conventional CQD solar cells have achieved PCEs >6% so far.27–30 In comparison, for both organic and perovskite solar cells the PCE gap between inverted and conventional devices is very small nowadays. Thus, it still remains a big challenge to improve the device performance of current conventional CQD solar cells. Recently, the PbS-TBAI (tetrabutylammonium iodide)/PbS-EDT (1,2-ethanedithiol) homo-junction has been widely applied to the inverted structure, resulting in high device PCEs over 10%.7,14,31–33 However, conventional devices with this homo-junction structure have not been reported. We thus proposed to adopt this efficient PbS-TBAI/PbS-EDT structure in our conventional devices. We also realized that the current low device performance for the conventional architecture is likely attributed to the non-optimal interface between the active layers and the electrodes. The lack of efficient HTMs between ITO and CQDs may be a critical factor for the poor performance of current conventional CQD solar cells. Until now, only traditional poly (3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)34 and nickel oxide (NiO)35 have been used as HTMs in conventional CQDs solar cells. Unfortunately, the performance is still not satisfactory. Therefore, in order to further boost the efficiency of conventional CQD solar cells, it is urgent to develop new HTMs to improve hole extraction at the anode. Organic semi-conducting polymers have been widely used as HTMs in perovskite solar cells or as donor materials in organic solar cells with excellent performance.21,36 The use of such organic materials as carrier transport materials can avoid the possible drawbacks of metal oxides and the selection of organic HTMs with matching energy levels with PbS QDs can be easily achieved due to the vast amounts of candidates. In addition, the design of the organic–inorganic hybrid structure is highly feasible since the deposition of the top PbS QD layer will not harm the underneath organic HTM, benefiting from the unique solution processing of CQDs with hexane or octane as the solvent. Moreover, the combination of polymers and PbS QDs may create a synergistic effect of hybrid materials in conventional CQD solar cells, leading to further improved device performance.
In this work, we present poly[2,6-(N-(1-pentylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PDTPBT), an efficient donor polymer in nanocrystal/polymer hybrid solar cells,37,38 as the HTM in conventional CQD solar cells. We reveal that the incorporation of PDTPBT produces a shift of the vacuum level at the interface of ITO/PbS. Meanwhile, the organic HTM can greatly facilitate charge separation and reduce interfacial charge recombination, resulting in a higher open circuit voltage (Voc). As a result, metal oxide ETM-free CQD solar cells with a simple ITO/PDTPBT/PbS-EDT/PbS-TBAI/LiF/Al conventional architecture achieved a high PCE of 8.45%, which is significantly higher than the previous PCE record of 7.4% for conventional CQD devices. We believe that this efficiency can be further improved in the future to approach the PCE of state-of-the art inverted devices by employing a suitable ETL. More importantly, the introduction of an organic buffer layer in PbS QD conventional devices may become an efficient approach to rapidly reduce the performance gap between the current conventional and inverted CQD solar cells, which can then greatly diversify the ways of designing and manufacturing future CQD solar cells.
Results and discussion
The optimal conventional architecture of CQD solar cells used in this study is shown in Fig. 1a. PbS CQDs with a bandgap of 1.37 eV (Fig. S1b†) were deposited using a layer-by-layer process and the solid-state exchange process was performed by using two kinds of ligands. A TBAI-processed PbS QD layer (PbS-TBAI) acts as the main charge generation layer and an EDT-processed PbS QD layer (PbS-EDT) functions as the hole-extracting/electron-blocking layer. This strategy was developed in inverted CQD solar cells recently,12 and was found to be appropriate in conventional CQD solar cells as well. We first studied the performance of the simplest device with a structure of ITO/PbS-TBAI/Al. A relatively low PCE of 4.18% was achieved, likely due to the low carrier selectivity of the two electrodes. We then incorporated a PbS-EDT layer into the devices and effectively improved the hole extraction and electron blocking at the anode, leading to increased PCE from 4.18% to 6.52%, as a result of comprehensively increased photovoltaic parameters (Fig. S2,†Table 1). By further improving the electron extraction at the Al side using a 0.6 nm thin insulating LiF layer and meanwhile optimizing the thickness of CQD layers, the device PCE was increased significantly to 7.17% (Fig. S3 and Table S1†). Hereafter, we define the device comprised of ITO/PbS-EDT/PbS-TBAI/LiF/Al as the control device in this study.

At first, the conventional anode buffer layer poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was employed in conventional CQD solar cells while it led to an extremely poor device performance (Fig. S2† and Table 1), likely due to its incompatibility with the solvents used in ligand-exchange or exposure to moisture during the ambient fabrication process. Therefore, it is critical to exploit other efficient HTMs for conventional CQD solar cells. Enlightened by the remarkable performance of a low band-gap polymer PDTPBT in the polymer/CQD hybrid solar cells,38 we try to introduce PDTPBT as the HTM between ITO and PbS QDs layers in our conventional configuration (ITO/PDTPBT/PbS-EDT/PbS-TBAI/LiF/Al) (Fig. 1a). Its desired energy level alignment and excellent compatibility with PbS QDs are expected to further improve the carrier selectivity at the anode side. After careful optimization, the optimal thickness of PDTPBT and PbS QDs layers is determined to be around 10 nm (corresponding to a concentration of 1 mg mL−1 for the cast solution, Fig. S4†) and 300 nm respectively (Fig. 1b). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the CQD solar cells with and without a PDTPBT layer are shown in Fig. 1c. We can observe that the device with the PDTPBT HTM exhibits a greatly improved PCE of 8.45% compared to 7.17% for devices without PDTPBT. The PCE improvement mainly stems from the remarkable improvement of Voc (from 0.56 V to 0.63 V) and a slight improvement of short circuit current density (Jsc) (from 19.51 mA cm−2 to 20.39 mA cm−2). The detailed parameters are summarized in Table 1. We further measured the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra to confirm the change of Jsc for the control and HTM buffered devices, as shown in Fig. 1d. The devices with PDTPBT exhibit generally higher EQE values than the control devices, which agrees well with the enhancement of Jsc. The anomalously lower EQE of the HTM buffered devices around 800 nm may be attributed to the strong absorption of the PDTPBT HTM in this region (Fig. S1c†). Meanwhile, we integrate the EQE curve and the obtained current densities are consistent with the J–V results (with a mismatch of <5%).
To explore the origin of the enhancement, Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) was employed to measure the contact potential difference (CPD) of the PbS-EDT layer on ITO or PDTPBT, where CPD = Vtip − Vsample (Vtip and Vsample are the potential of the tip and sample surface, respectively). As a consequence, the relative CPDs correspond to the vacuum level shifts of the sample surfaces.41 Based on the measurement, we can then evaluate the effect of PDTPBT on the device carrier extraction on the anode side. Fig. S5† shows the topography of the PDTPBT layer partially covered by PbS QDs, with an abrupt bump caused by accumulated materials at the boundary of the PbS-EDT layer. The corresponding CPD image is shown in Fig. 2a. In Fig. 2b, the sample is fabricated by first depositing a PDTPBT layer partially on the ITO substrate. Then PbS-EDT is prepared on the top of both PDTPBT and ITO. The bump is the boundary between ITO and PDTPBT. The cross-sectional line profiles of the CPD images for the two samples are shown in Fig. 2c. The upper graph in Fig. 2c indicates a 300 mV CPD difference between the PbS layer and the PDTPBT layer. Note that the work functions of PbS-EDT, PDTPBT and ITO are 4.4 eV, 4.6 eV and 4.7 eV respectively from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) (Fig. S6†). The work function difference of 200 meV between PbS-EDT and PDTPBT is not enough to interpret the 300 meV vacuum shift in KPFM results, which suggests that a dipole-charge distribution at the polymer/PbS QDs interface could also be the reason for the shift.42 To further confirm the effect of PDTPBT, we compared the CPDs of PbS on both ITO and PDTPBT, as shown in the lower graph in Fig. 2c. We can clearly observe that the CPD of the PbS QDs on top of the polymer layer is higher than that on ITO, indicating enhanced charge redistribution after the incorporation of PDTPBT. As shown in Fig. 2d, the formation of a dipole can actually lower the work function of ITO to approach the valence band of the PbS-EDT layer for better hole extraction.

To further investigate the effect of the PDTPBT HTM on hole extraction, surface potential distribution under dark and illumination was measured by KPFM (Fig. 3). In the dark, the surface potential difference between ITO/PbS-EDT and ITO/PDTPBT/PbS-EDT samples should be determined by the work function differences and possible surface dipole.43 Under illumination, the photovoltaic effect leads to a negative shift of the surface potential of both structures, likely caused by electron accumulation on the PbS surface after hole extraction to the anode. The surface potential shift for ITO/PDTPBT/PbS-EDT (115 mV) is almost two times larger than that of ITO/PbS-EDT as shown in Fig. 3a and b. The histogram distribution of the surface potential for the samples with and without PDTPBT under different conditions is quantitatively plotted in Fig. 3c and d. The value of SPlight–dark = SPlight − SPdark for ITO/PDTPBT/PbS-EDT (115 mV) is almost two times larger than that of ITO/PbS (57 mV), which indicates that the insertion of the PPDTPBT layer as the HTM greatly benefits electron–hole pair separation at the anode side.44 Meanwhile, from the intersections of the corresponding device's J–V curves under AM 1.5G illumination and in the dark (Fig. S7†), the extracted built-in potential (Vbi) for the control device and PDTPBT device is 0.60 V and 0.66 V respectively.45 This enhanced Vbi is also consistent with the improved carrier extraction. In addition, we notice that the polymer layer has a higher lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) than PbS-EDT (Fig. 2d), which is helpful for electron-blocking and may reduce charge recombination at the anode.

Furthermore, the doping density (1.93 × 1015 cm−3) of the p-type organic layer PDTPBT was achieved from capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements, and was significantly lower than that of the PbS-EDT layer (NA ≈ 1016 cm−3).46 Therefore, there is no p+–p heterojunction formed and the enhancement of device performance should be mainly derived from the buffer layer effect of the polymer at the interface between ITO and PbS-EDT layers. We then carried out several device characterizations to investigate carrier recombination in devices. As shown in the dark J–V curves (Fig. 4a), the leakage current for the device with the PDTPBT HTM is greatly suppressed compared to the control device, while the two devices exhibit similar output current in the forward direction, indicating a higher rectification ratio and thus improved hole selectivity of the anode after using the PDTPBT HTM.14,47 To get more insight into the charge recombination kinetics, we studied the variation of Jsc and Voc as a function of the illumination intensity. According to the power law equation: Jsc ∝ Iα, where I is the light intensity, both the values of the exponential factor (α) of the device with and without the PDTPBT HTM are found to be close to unity from the light intensity dependence of Jsc (Fig. 4b). This result indicates that bimolecular recombination during the charge sweep-out under short-circuit conditions is not serious for both devices.14 In addition, the light intensity dependence of Voc was also studied according to the following relation: , where k is the Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, q the elementary charge, and c the fitting parameter collecting all the terms independent of light intensity.48 The values of the diode ideality factor n are determined to be 1.61 for the control and 1.32 for the device with the PDTPBT HTM from the light intensity dependence of Voc (Fig. 4c). The lower n of the device with the PDTPBT HTM indicates likely reduced trap-assisted bimolecular recombination at the anode.14 According to the equation ,49 where J0 is the reverse saturation current density, the value of J0 for the PDTPBT-based device is calculated to be 1.76 × 10−7 mA cm−2 which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of the control device (2.60 × 10−5 mA cm−2). Hence, the higher Voc for the PDTPBT-based device can be explained by the smaller reverse saturation current density J0, which is a direct outcome of the enhanced hole selection effect of PDTPBT.50

In addition, the Nyquist plots from impedance spectroscopy (IS) show significant reduction of the total series resistance in the device with PDTPBT compared to the control device (Fig. 4d),47 which may benefit from the reduced interfacial charge recombination and improved interfacial contact. From the results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig. S9†), the reduced QD aggregation on the sample surface suggests improved interfacial contact after the insertion of the PDTPBT layer. Lower root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values were also observed in the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images when PbS-EDT deposited on PDTPBT instead of on ITO (Fig. S10†). At last, we compared the light soaking effects of our conventionally structured devices and the typical inverted devices. As shown in Fig. S11,† we plot the evolution of PCE and FF as a function of various exposure times under AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2). The inverted device exhibits an apparent light-soaking phenomenon and takes more than 20 min until the PCE reaches a stable value, which may be attributed to the slow filling process of trap states in the ZnO layer. In contrast, the conventional structure exhibits much more stable PCE output with time, demonstrating the absence of the light-soaking phenomenon, which shows the superiority of using organic instead of metal oxide HTMs. However, the current device with a conventional structure shows lower stability than the inverted PbS QD solar cells,51 and the devices under air are less stable than under nitrogen (Fig. S12†), which may be attributed to the lack of a more protective cathode buffer layer and the degradation of the Al electrode in air. We believe its stability will be improved significantly after further research on cathode interfacial materials and the use of more stable metal cathodes.
Conclusions
In summary, a record-high PCE of 8.45% has been achieved for conventionally structured PbS QD solar cells by the introduction of a unique conjugated polymer PDTPBT as the buffer layer between ITO and PbS CQDs. With the aid of an organic buffer layer, the device performance was largely improved through a dramatic enhancement in Voc, which can be attributed to the enhanced hole extraction at the anode after PDTPBT modification. Meanwhile, the polymer layer can also efficiently improve charge separation and reduce interfacial charge recombination as well as reverse saturation current density, which result in significantly enhanced Voc. More importantly, our results proposed a new conventional architecture for QD solar cells without employing metal oxides, which may offer more flexibility in future device design and show potential advantages in large-scale manufacturing by simplifying the fabrication process.
Experimental section
Materials preparation
PDTPBT was synthesized according to the literature.39 The synthesis of oleic acid (OA)-capped PbS QDs was performed with a modified recipe previously documented.40 Lead oxide (450 mg) was dissolved in 1.4 g of oleic acid and 20 g of 1-octadecene at 100 °C. The solution was degassed for 2 hours and then cooled down to 75 °C under nitrogen. 0.21 mL of hexamethyldisilathiane in 4 mL of 1-octadecene was rapidly injected into the lead precursor solution. After the synthesis, the solution was transferred into a nitrogen-filled glovebox. QDs were purified by precipitation once in hexane/isopropyl alcohol and once in hexane/acetone and stored in solid form in a glovebox. For film fabrication, PbS QDs were re-dispersed in hexane (40 mg mL−1 for PbS-TBAI layers and 20 mg mL−1 for PbS-EDT layers).
Device fabrication
The ITO-coated glass substrate was ultrasonically cleaned with detergent, isopropyl alcohol and acetone in sequence. And then the substrate was oven-dried and subjected to an UV-ozone treatment. A PDTPBT solution (1 mg mL−1 in chloroform) was spin-coated at 2500 rpm onto the ITO substrates. The PbS-CQD active layers were fabricated via layer-by-layer spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 10 s. Solid-state ligand exchange was performed by soaking the film in a tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI) solution (10 mg mL−1 in methanol) or an EDT (0.01% by volume in acetonitrile) solution for 30 s, followed by two rinse-spin steps with methanol or acetonitrile respectively. This process was repeated until the desired thicknesses were obtained. Then the films were stored in air overnight. Finally, LiF (0.6 nm) and the electrodes (80 nm thick) were deposited by thermal evaporation at a reduced pressure (<10−6 Torr) through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2).
Measurements and characterization
The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5 G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). The light intensity was calibrated using a certified Oriel Reference Cell (91150 V) and verified with a NREL calibrated Hamamatsu S1787-04 diode. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) measurements were performed under ambient conditions with a Bruker Dimension Icon atomic force microscope. UV-Vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model Lambda 750. Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were performed using a precision impedance analyzer 6500B series. UPS measurements were performed using an Omicron Nanotechnology system with a base pressure of 2 × 10−10 Torr. The device cross-section was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on a Zeiss Supra 55 field in high vacuum mode at 15 kV accelerating voltage. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed using a Veeco Multimode V instrument.
