    , Accepted 20th January 2016First published on 21st January 2016AbstractWe firstly fabricated a peculiar 3D structure of Bi2S3 salix leaf-like nanosheet/TiO2 nanorod branched heterostructure arrays by a convenient hydrothermal method and discussed their mechanism of improving photoelectrochemical cell (PEC) properties. The salix leaf-like Bi2S3 nanosheets (NSs) were grown on TiO2 nanorod arrays through controlling the molar ratio of EDTA-Na2/Bi3+ and the reaction time. The morphology, crystal structure, microstructure and optical performance of the 3D Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NRs at different reaction times were investigated. The results show that the branched heterostructure of 3D Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR arrays exhibits enhanced photocurrent density and optical absorption, which were attributed to the larger Bi2S3 surface area, as well as a direct electron path within the salix leaf-like Bi2S3 NS and TiO2 NR heterojunctions, resulting from more excitation sites of incident light. The photocurrent density of the 3D Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR arrays was almost 9 times greater than that of pristine TiO2 without a branching structure. The results of the present work demonstrate that fabrication of the branched Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR heterogeneous structure is a significant fabrication technology with great promise in PECs.
1. Introduction
Inorganic semiconductor materials, which retain many advantages of low cost, stable performance and size control, have been studied widely. Of these, metal oxide semiconductor materials are of critical importance, since they are one of the main components in photoelectrochemical cells (PECs).1,2 Especially, TiO2 nanorods (NRs) have attracted much attention because of their straightforward pathways for photogenerated electrons and fast electron transportation rate.3 However, single TiO2 still has some deficiencies, such as smaller surface area and a large band energy (3.0–3.2 eV), which signifies that only the short wavelength of ultraviolet light in the solar spectrum can be absorbed and that there is a high recombination rate of photogenerated electrons and holes.4,5 Various methods have been applied to solve this problem, such as the use of semiconductor sensitized solar cells (SSSCs)6,7 and heteroatom doped TiO2 solar cells,8,9 which aim to change the band energy of TiO2 and expand the spectrum response. But to date, the efficiency of PECs is still low, and it is necessary to design new architecture to improve the photovoltaic performance. Branched semiconductor nanostructures have recently attracted great attention, and the controlled growth of such hierarchical nanostructures is of particular interest and challenging.10 It is reported that the synthesis of hierarchical and branched TiO2 based nanorod array PECs with a larger surface and many excitation sites can simultaneously provide the electron transfer pathway and benefit the charge separation and collection.11,12
A 3D branched heterojunction hierarchical structure has been considered as an ideal composite structure to improve surface area and excitation sites to provide short electron pathways for the rapid transfer and efficient collection of photogenerated electrons.11 Kim’s group reported hierarchical anatase pine tree-like TiO2 nanotubes based on a one-step hydrothermal method and obtained 8.0% conversion efficiency.12 Lei et al. presented a novel hierarchical homogeneous nanoarchitecture of TiO2 nanosheets, branched TiO2 nanosheet arrays, which exhibited 6.66% photoefficiency.13 Liao et al. reported hierarchical anatase TiO2 nanowire arrays consisting of long TiO2 nanowire trunks and short TiO2 nanorod branches made by a simple two-step hydrothermal process and offering an increased power conversion efficiency of 4.51% compared to TiO2 nanowire arrays’ efficiency of 3.12%.14
In order to further investigate the superiority of the above-mentioned structure, a novel nanoarchitecture, a Bi2S3 salix leaf-like NS/TiO2 NR heterostructure array, was proposed in the present work. Bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) is an important lamellar structured direct band gap semiconductor with a narrow band gap (1.4 eV) and a high absorption coefficient (105 cm−1). Recently, lots of Bi2S3-based visible-light photocatalysts have been synthesized to improve photoinduced charge separation and visible-light photocatalytic activity and this material is becoming an ideal candidate material in photovoltaics.15,16 We fabricated the hierarchical branched Bi2S3 salix leaf-like nanosheet/TiO2 NR heterostructure arrays for the first time by a simple hydrothermal process. Herein, a lower reaction temperature (70 °C) and shorter reaction time (1 h) were employed to prepare the Bi2S3 salix leaf-like morphology and build on TiO2 NR arrays to form a branched hierarchical structure with considerable performance. The orthorhombic phase salix leaf-like Bi2S3 nanosheets were coated on the TiO2 NRs by changing the molar ratio of EDTA-Na2/Bi3+ and reaction time that constituted a branched structure through using 3-aminopropyl triethoxysilane (APTS) as a coupling agent. The growth mechanism of the salix leaf-like Bi2S3 nanosheet formation and explanation for the strong adhesion to TiO2 are suggested. Experimental results show that the TiO2 NR arrays can enhance the charge transportation while the Bi2S3 branches provide a large surface area which strengthens the absorption of sunlight and promotes the PEC properties of the TiO2 photoelectrodes.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Fabrication of salix leaf-like Bi2S3 nanosheet/TiO2 NR arrays
The TiO2 nanorod arrays were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass using a hydrothermal method that was described in detail previously.17
In a typical Bi2S3 nanosheet/TiO2 NR array synthesis process, Bi(NO3)3·5H2O (0.35 mM) was dissolved in 2 mL deionized water and a few drops of dilute nitric acid was added in case of hydrolysis. EDTA-Na2 (0 mM, 0.17 mM, 0.35 mM or 0.52 mM was used, respectively) was dissolved in 10 mL water, and the two solution were mixed and diluted to 50 mL. After that they were filled with Na2S2O3·5H2O (0.38 mM) and dropped in 0.1 M HNO3 making the solution pH 0.95. The TiO2 NR substrates were firstly soaked for 3 h in 3 mM APTS anhydrous methanol solution, and were then placed at a stainless steel autoclave with the above precursor solution and maintained at a temperature of 70 °C for several different time periods (30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h). After synthesis, the samples were rinsed with deionzied water and then dried in nitrogen.
2.2 Characterization
The morphology of the sample was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, JSM-6701F, Japan). The microstructure was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM, TF20) and high resolution transmission microscopy (HRTEM). The phase was detected by X-ray diffractometry (XRD, Rigaku D/max-2400, Japan) in the 2θ range of 10–80°. The chemical composition was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI-5702). The absorption spectrum of the electrodes was determined by a LabTech spectrophotometer (China).
2.3 PEC measurements
PEC properties were determined by an electrochemical workstation (CH instruments, model CHI660d), which carried an electrolytic cell including a standard three-electrode system. The Bi2S3 nanosheet/TiO2 NRs were used as the working electrodes, a platinum mesh as the counter electrode, and a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were carried out in electrolyte containing 0.95 M Na2SO3 and 0.05 M Na2S·9H2O aqueous solution. The CHI electrochemical workstation was used to measure dark and illuminated current at a scan speed of 0.1 V s−1. The illumination source was a xenon lamp using 500 W, and sunlight was simulated in a full spectrum. The light intensity was calibrated using standard crystalline silicon cells, equivalent to AM 1.5 G light at 100 mW cm−2.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure characterization

Fig. 1 presents the FESEM images and the cross-sectional view of the TiO2 photoelectrodes (a and b), and the top-view FESEM images of the surface morphologies of the Bi2S3 nanosheet/TiO2 nanorod arrays with different molar ratios of EDTA-Na2 to Bi3+ from varying the amount of EDTA-Na2 from 0 mM to 0.52 mM at 70 °C for 1 h (c–f). It can be found from Fig. 1a and b that the TiO2 NRs with tetragonal crystal planes vertically grow on the FTO substrate and without any impurities appearing in the surface. Fig. 1(c–f) demonstrate that the EDTA-Na2 concentration affects the final morphology of the Bi2S3 nanostructures. Without EDTA-Na2, a large number of nanoparticles uniformly covered the TiO2 nanorods (Fig. 1c). The sharp NSs begin to appear in the interstice of TiO2 NR with addition of EDTA-Na2, and the top surface is distributed chaotically by the intersection of nanoparticles and nanosheets (Fig. 1d). When the EDTA-Na2/Bi3+ molar ratio is 1, each of the flower petals coated on TiO2 become a regular salix leaf shape (Fig. 1e). By increasing the molar ratio to 1.5, the density of the nanoflowers is increased and accompanied by severe agglomeration (Fig. 1f).

Top-view SEM images of Bi2S3 nanosheet/TiO2 nanorod arrays synthesized at different EDTA-Na2/Bi3+ molar ratios at 70 °C for 1 h (c) without EDTA-Na2, (d) 0.5, (e) 1, (f) 1.5. 

Fig. 2 shows the FESEM images of the Bi2S3 nanosheet/TiO2 nanorod arrays at different reaction times with the EDTA-Na2/Bi3+ molar ratio kept at 1:1. It is clear that a large number of salix-like NSs are uniformly and epitaxially constructed on the TiO2 NRs in different directions with prolonged growth time. The nanoflowers on the top of the TiO2 consist of several salix-like petals in the image of the hydrothermal reaction of 1 h (Fig. 2b), and their length is in the range of 100–300 nm. The original smooth TiO2 surfaces are converted into a branched hierarchical architecture. With the extension of the reaction time, the anchoring number of Bi2S3 branched NSs on the TiO2 NR arrays increased, the size of flower petals became larger and agglomeration occurred (Fig. 2c and d). Fig. 2e demonstrates that the Bi2S3 NSs are distributed on the whole TiO2 NR surface and interweave into a branched porous structure. More importantly, the gap between TiO2 nanorods remains clear, which can not only provide a large surface and many light adsorption active sites, but is also beneficial to electrolyte immersion and diffusion. It is believed that this novel architecture should be beneficial for enhancing light-harvesting ability and electronic transportation, and thus further improve the photoconversion efficiency of the PECs.

The growth mechanism of salix leaf-like Bi2S3 nanosheet formation can be concluded as below:
In this process, the possible reactions are: Bi3+ + EDTA-Na2 → [Bi(NaEDTA)n]3+[Bi(NaEDTA)n]3+ → Bi3+ + EDTA-Na2Bi3+ + S2− → Bi2S3The EDTA-Na2 complex agent is capable of controlling the nucleation of Bi3+, and slowing down the growth rate of Bi2S3 thereby indicating that the chelating effect of EDTA-Na2 is more dominant.18 –OH on the TiO2 NR surfaces easily undergo nucleophilic substitution with one end of the APTS linker, and other –NH2 functional groups have a strong tendency to coordinate with inorganic cations and metals. In a supersaturated solution, the functionalized surface can reduce the nucleation barrier of bismuth sulfide and act as a nucleation site due to its capacity to bind bismuth ions.19 The nuclei are further grown and produced small flowers via the Ostwald growth process, and are eventually transformed into well-defined Bi2S3 sheets.20
TEM and HRTEM images, and XRD analysis of the as-prepared Bi2S3 nanosheet/TiO2 nanorods (the EDTA-Na2/Bi3+ molar ratio is 1:1, at 1 h) are shown in Fig. 3 and 4, respectively. It can be seen that the Bi2S3 NSs grow dispersively on the surface of the whole TiO2 NRs (Fig. 3a). The corresponding HRTEM image indicates that the Bi2S3 NSs are highly crystalline with an interplanar distance of 0.35 nm for the plane of (310) (Fig. 3b). The inset is the corresponding SAED image of the Bi2S3 nanosheet, which also indicates that the nanosheet is single-crystalline with a preferential growth in the direction of the (310) plane. This is consistent with the results of the XRD patterns (Fig. 4), where curve a represents the XRD pattern of pristine TiO2 and the crystal planes of (101), (002), (301) and (112) are consistent with the standard tetragonal rutile phase of TiO2 (JCPDS No. 75-1748, a = b = 0.4594 nm and c = 0.2959 nm). The curves b, c, d and e show the XRD patterns of the Bi2S3 nanosheet/TiO2 nanorod arrays at different reaction times (30 min, 1 h, 2 h and 3 h, respectively), where the diffraction peaks are indexed to the standard orthorhombic structure of Bi2S3 (JCPDS No. 17-0320, a = 1.1149 nm, b = 1.13 nm, c = 0.398 nm).21 Furthermore, the XRD results revealed that the as-prepared TiO2 NRs and Bi2S3 NSs are of high purity and good crystallinity, and the intensities of the diffraction peaks are stronger with prolonged time. Such a highly crystalline structure would effect an improvement of the photovoltaic property effectively.

The XPS analysis results clearly indicate that the as-obtained sample (EDTA-Na2/Bi3+, molar ratio is 1:1, at 1 h) contains C, Ti, O, Bi and S elements without the appearance of an obvious impurity peak (Fig. 5a). The XPS peak for C1s at 284.8 eV was used to revise the high-revolution peaks. The peaks of binding energy at 158.0 eV and 163.3 eV are assigned to Bi4f7/2 and Bi4f5/2 (Fig. 5b), and the observed peak separation is 5.3 eV, meanwhile the binding energies of 160.98 eV and 162.18 eV are appointed to S2p3/2 and S2p1/2, which are consistent with the literature.22Fig. 5(c and d) show prominent peaks centered at 458.8 eV, 464.8 eV and 531.3 eV, which are consistent with the energy of Ti2p3/2, Ti2p1/2 and O1s.23–25 The above analysis results of SEM, TEM, XRD and XPS unanimously prove that the Bi2S3 nanosheets have successfully covered the TiO2 nanorods.

Fig. 6a reveals the UV-vis absorption spectra of the plain TiO2 and the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR heterojunctions at different reaction times. The Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR heterojunction exhibits a superior light response range compared to the plain TiO2, which can be attributed to the deposition of the Bi2S3 NSs on the TiO2 NRs and the large surface areas of the special branched structure.13,26 The light absorption intensity of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR composite film is generally increased with a longer deposition time and causes a red shift, and the absorption edge moves toward the visible light region from 400 to 800 nm with the growth of Bi2S3 nanosheets on the TiO2 NRs. Fig. 6b and c show that the calculated band gaps for plain TiO2 and bare Bi2S3 NSs are 3.1 eV and 1.59 eV, respectively; the small band gap energy of Bi2S3 NSs matches well with the solar spectrum.27Fig. 6d displays the diffuse reflectance spectra of pristine TiO2 and Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR branched arrays at different reaction times. It can be found that plain TiO2 has high diffuse reflectance in a wide wavelength range, and after the deposition of Bi2S3 NSs, the range of the diffused reflectance of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR branched arrays shifts from visible light to infrared light. The diffuse intensity of Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR branched arrays in wavelengths of 400–800 nm reduced significantly, which is probably due to the fact that the Bi2S3 NS thin film covering on the TiO2 NRs benefits multiple light scattering among the TiO2 NRs and Bi2S3 NSs, and that would increase the light absorption sites and paths, while the pristine TiO2 NR arrays leads to only a single reflection from the nanorod surface.28 So an improved photocurrent in PEC measurements is expected.

Photocurrent responses (I–T) with different reaction times and photocurrent stabilities are shown in Fig. 7. The photocurrent responses of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrodes are significantly increased and better than that of the pristine TiO2, and reach a maximum of 0.8 mA cm−2 at a reaction time of 1 h (Fig. 7a), which is 9 times that of the plain TiO2 (0.09 mA cm−2). Meanwhile, the photocurrent density can remain at a stable value long term after the first 200 s, revealing a good capability to resist photocorrosion (Fig. 7b).29 It can also be found that the corresponding photocurrent density is 0.2 mA cm−2 and 0.58 mA cm−2 at the reaction time 30 min and 2 h, respectively. The inferiority of the photoelectrochemical properties of the material at a shorter reaction time ascribes to a lower loading or smaller size of the Bi2S3 nanoparticles. After a longer reaction time, the lowered photocurrent is mainly attributed to a thicker and longer Bi2S3 nanosheet layer which may have lengthened branches, which enhance the electron migration distance and increase the recombination of electrons and holes.30,31

The EIS Nyquist plots of TiO2, and Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR (1 h) electrodes suggest that only one semicircle was achieved (Fig. 8a). The Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrode performed smaller resistance-circles than pristine TiO2 whether in the dark or under visible light, which suggests a quick separation of electrons and holes in the interface of the electrode/electrolyte when Bi2S3 nanosheets are deposited.32Fig. 8b shows typical Mott–Schottky plots of TiO2 and Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR (1 h) electrodes. The positive slopes of the curves indicate that all the samples are n-type semiconductors. The slope of a Mott–Schottky plot shows the charge carrier density ND as it can be calculated by the equation: ND = (2/e0εε0)[d(1/C2)/dV]−1, where e0, ε0, ε, and d(1/C2)/dV represent the elementary electron charge, permittivity of the semiconductor electrode, permittivity of vacuum and the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot, respectively. This indicates that the smaller the slope of the Mott–Schottky plot is, the higher the charge carrier density will be.33 As is shown in Fig. 8b, the slope of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrode is smaller than that of the pristine TiO2 NR electrode, suggesting that the photo-generated carrier density of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrode is greater than that of the TiO2 NR electrode. Combined with the results of EIS, it is concluded that the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrode could improve the capability of generation and separation for photo-generated charge carriers, which is beneficial to the enhancement of PEC performance.

The changes of photocurrent density versus potential in the dark or under the light were further characterized as shown in Fig. 9a; the potential scan range is −0.9 V to 0.8 V. The dark currents of all the electrodes are so small in the whole scanning process that they can be neglected, indicating that in the TiO2 and Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrodes separation of electrons and holes almost does not occur in dark states. While under visible light irradiation, the current densities generate instantly and that of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrode is higher than that of pristine TiO2. For the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrodes, the photocurrent is increased rapidly then reduced and remains at a stable value as the bias voltage becomes more positive. The photocurrent peak for both the dark and visible light may be due to the intercalation of Na+ and H+ ions in the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR heterojunction, and then deintercalation at a higher potential.34 This phenomenon can also be found in the literature.35,36 Under the same illumination, the photocurrent intensity of reaction time at 1 h registers the highest saturated photocurrent density (0.9 mA cm−2), which is close to the results of Fig. 7a. The corresponding photoconversion efficiency (η) of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrodes according to the equation described in the literature25,37 is shown in Fig. 9b. The highest efficiency is 2.23%, which is about 9 times higher than that of pristine TiO2 (0.25%). This could be attributed to the particular branched heterojunction structure and suitable Bi2S3 nanosheet size, which can enlarge the absorption area and capture more visible light. Based on the above analyses, the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR electrode shows a higher photocurrent, revealing that Bi2S3 and TiO2 forming branched heterojunctions were more appropriate for light absorption and the separation of electrons and holes.
 Fig. 9  The current density versus voltage (I–V) (a) and photoconversion efficiency (b) of the pristine TiO2 and Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR heterojunction electrodes with different reaction times under the visible-light illumination of 100 mW cm−2. 
To investigate the mechanism of the improved photocurrent of the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR branched heterojunctions, the separation processes of the photo-excited electrons and holes are analyzed and calculated based on the following empirical equation of the valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) energy:5,38EVB = X − Ee + 0.5Egwhere Eg is the band gap energy of semiconductor materials, Ee is the energy of free electrons on the hydrogen scale (∼4.5 eV), and X is the electronegativity of the semiconductor, which can be expressed as the geometric mean of the absolute electronegativity of the constituent atoms.39 The X values of Bi2S3 and TiO2 are calculated to be 5.56 eV and 5.81 eV, respectively. Therefore, the valence band energy (EVB) of Bi2S3 and TiO2 is estimated to be 1.85 eV and 2.86 eV, and the corresponding ECB is 0.26 eV and −0.24 eV, respectively. From the above conclusion, we can deduce that a possible cascade process takes place inside the Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR heterojunctions (Fig. 10a). A possible reason is that under visible-light illumination, the photoexcited electrons in the Bi2S3 nanosheets can spontaneously jump from the valence band (1.85 eV) to the conduction band (0.26 eV) in the electrolyte. Meanwhile the water undergoes a photoelectrocatalytic oxidation process, and then the electrons in the Bi2S3 conduction band transfer to the higher edge of the oxygen reduction potential (−1.48 eV) due to the higher photon energy under irradiation and an internal electric field and then inject into the TiO2 conduction band.5,40 Hence, the reformed conduction band energy of Bi2S3 is more negative than that of TiO2 in the composite structure. This reveals that an appropriate matching of the gradient energy structure occurred, which is a key factor in PEC solar cells because it can significantly increase the efficiency of carrier injection and collection.41 The excited electrons are easily transferred through the conduction band of Bi2S3 to TiO2, meanwhile, the injection ability of the excited electrons is enhanced because of the branched structure and the increased spatial channels. Thereby, in this study, we have successfully designed and fabricated Bi2S3 salix leaf-like NS/TiO2 NRs that can take advantage of the beneficial optical, chemical, and transport properties of both materials TiO2 nanorods and Bi2S3 salix leaf-like nanosheets.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully fabricated 3D Bi2S3 salix leaf-like nanosheet/TiO2 nanorod branched heterostructure arrays for the first time by a simple hydrothermal technique. The Bi2S3 salix leaf-like nanosheet loading on the TiO2 nanorods assembled a branched heterojunction structure, which greatly enhanced the optical absorption ability and photocurrent density compared with that of pristine TiO2. The increased photovoltaic performance may be attributed to the larger surface area of the special Bi2S3 NS/TiO2 NR structure and longer direct electron path. Meanwhile, an internal cascade process is advantageous to the separation of electrons and holes. Therefore, the branched heterostructure could be effective for improving the efficiency of PECs.
