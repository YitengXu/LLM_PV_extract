    , Accepted 26th June 2012First published on 20th July 2012AbstractPorous nanocrystalline Zn/TiO2 materials were synthesized employing agarose gel as a template, achieving a maximum Zn-doping concentration of around 2 at.%. Low Zn-doping concentrations (e.g. <1 at.%) improved the photocurrent of the dye-sensitized solar cell when these materials were applied as the working electrode, as n-type doping favors electron transportation. Compared to the efficiency of the undoped sample, 6.7%, the 0.5 at.% sample showed a much higher efficiency of 7.6%. Further doping decreases the performance of the device as it introduces deficiencies that act as electron–hole recombination centers.
Introduction
The dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC), as a potential commercializable renewable energy device, has attracted great interest due to its low cost, compared with the traditional Si solar cell.1,2 The dye molecules attached on the surface of the TiO2 nanocrystals absorb the solar light and convert photons to electrons that are then injected into the conduction band of TiO2. The dyes can be reduced by the redox couples in the electrolyte solution. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the device is determined by the open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), and fill factor (FF). There are several ways to increase the photocurrent: (a) increasing the light harvesting, which could be achieved by developing new dyes with broad absorption spectra and high extinction molar coefficient,3 or introducing a scattering layer on the transparent nanocrystalline TiO2 film to reduce the loss of the photon energy;4,5 (b) increasing the electron injection rate by increasing the electron injection overpotential;6 (c) shifting the redox couple Fermi level to improve the dye regeneration rate or increase the photovoltage;7 (d) increasing the electron lifetime by reducing the possibility of electron and hole recombination;8 and (e) increasing the electron transport rate in TiO2.9 Modification of the working electrode (an important component of the DSC) has been investigated to increase the photocurrent and hence the overall PCE of the DSC.10–12 For example, modification of the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2 by TiCl4 can achieve an enhanced photocurrent due to the increase in the electron lifetime.10 Palomares et al. also coated a thin layer of insulator on the surface of the TiO2 to retard the combination of a photoexcited electron and I3− to increase the photocurrent.11 The morphology of TiO2 has been altered, such as employing an ordered nanotubular structure of TiO2, to increase the electron lifetime and electron transport rate.12
However, few studies have been conducted on modifying the chemical composition of the working electrode. While semiconductor oxides other than TiO2 have been explored, TiO2 is widely regarded as the best candidate.9,13,14 In order to alter the chemical composition of TiO2, the doping technique has attracted recent interest.15–18 Doping the TiO2 nanocrystals with a second element can modify the structure of the TiO2 crystal thereby altering the band position17 and the conductivity.19 Liu et al. doped Ta into TiO2 and achieved ∼16% enhancement in photocurrent due to an increased electron injection rate and electron transport rate.16 Nb-doped TiO2 electrodes improved photocurrents from 11.87 mA cm−2 to 17.67 mA cm−2 due to similar reasons.19 ZnO20,21 or a combination of ZnO/TiO2 materials22–24 have been used to construct the working electrode in DSCs as electrons injected from excited dye molecules have a longer lifetime in these electrodes than TiO2,9 but little work has been carried out on Zn-doped TiO2 electrodes.25,26 Only a very small range of doping concentrations were studied and the effect the dopant had on the material properties and then the performance of devices were not fully detailed. Zn-doped TiO2 has been applied in photocatalysis, resulting in an increase in the photocurrent compared with non-doped TiO2.27 As Zn-doping in TiO2 gives an n-type doped material, the excess negative charge carriers help the transport of electrons and thereby increase the photocurrent.25,26 Here we employed sol–gel chemistry and a template technique to synthesize Zn–TiO2 porous nanomaterials containing different Zn dopant concentrations.
Experimental section
Materials
The agarose powder used for the template preparation was of Molecular Biology Grade from Scientifix. The metal alkoxide precursors, titanium isopropoxide (TIP, 97%) and zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O, 98%), were purchased from Aldrich. Ethanol (99.5%), methanol (99.5%) and isopropanol (99.5%) were from Univar. All chemicals were used as received. The water used in all experiments was produced in a Millipore Milli-Q purification system and had a resistivity higher than 18.2 MΩ cm.
Synthesis
First, the 3 wt.% agarose gel template was synthesized according to a previous report.28 The agarose gel was then cut into 1 cm3 cubes and a solvent exchange process was carried out from H2O, H2O:methanol (2:1, by volume), H2O:methanol (1:2, by volume) to methanol. The required amount of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O was dissolved in methanol and then mixed with TIP to obtain the required Zn at.% as listed in Table 1. The agarose gel pieces were removed from methanol and placed immediately in the TIP and Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O mixed solution. After 2 h, the agarose gel was placed in a H2O/methanol (1:1, by volume) solution for 8 h to undergo hydrolysis and condensation reactions. The samples were dried in air at room temperature for 36 h, and then placed in an oven at 60 °C for 5 h. Finally, the samples were calcined in a laboratory furnace (31165A, B&L Tetlow) under flowing air at 450 °C for 10 h (heating ramp 3.5 °C min−1) to remove the agarose template and induce crystallization of the inorganic material. Throughout this work, a set of acronyms is used for the samples: Z0.0, Z0.5, Z1.0, Z2.0, Z4.0, Z6.0, and Z8.0. The numbers indicate the at.% of Zn/(Zn + Ti) in the composites.

Characterization
The specific surface area of the samples was determined by nitrogen sorption on a Micromeritics Tristar 3000 surface area and porosity analyzer. A Philips XL 30 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used to examine both the original agarose gel template structure (after drying using a critical point drying technique) and the prepared inorganic materials. For X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), the materials were crushed and ground to a fine powder by an agate mortar and pestle, and the XRD data were collected on a PANalytical X'pert Pro X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The UV-vis reflectance spectra of the ground fine powder were recorded on a Cary 5G UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer.
Cell construction
The prepared materials were ground to powder, made to a slurry, and then doctor-bladed into films (thickness of ∼10 μm) on F-doped SnO2 glass. The electrodes were then sintered at 450 °C for 30 min and after cooling soaked in 0.3 mM N719 (B2, Dyesol) tert-butanol and acetonitrile (1:1, by volume) solution. Finally they were assembled into a sealed sandwich type cell, which was filled with the electrolyte comprising 0.6 M tetrabutylammonium iodide, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile. The current–voltage curves of the DSCs made from the prepared samples were determined under 1 Sun intensity (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5). The Mott–Schottky analysis was carried out using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (Potentiostat, BioLogic VSP). The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl and the counter-electrode was Pt wire. The photocurrent transient measurements on the films were conducted at 20 ± 2 °C with a BAS100B electrochemical workstation in a three-electrode cell. The reference electrode was Ag/AgCl in 3 M KCl and the counter-electrode was Pt wire. The potential was set at 0 mV. The working electrode in the 0.1 M NaSCN solution was illuminated through the quartz window by a white light generated from a 7 W xenon lamp, and the photocurrent was recorded continuously during the light on and off period.
Results and discussion
There are different templates and templating approaches for preparing porous TiO2, including soft and hard templates, and coating or casting methods.29 For example, Yong et al. used an amphiphilic block copolymer (P123, (EO)20(PO)70(EO)20) to prepare mesoporous TiO2 with controlled pore structures.30 Here, agarose gel, a preformed template, was employed to prepare mesoporous TiO2. The agarose gel template was soaked in the methanol solution containing Zn(CH3COO)2 and titanium isopropoxide before conducting hydrolysis and condensation reactions to form a hybrid agarose/inorganic material. The template was removed by heating at 450 °C leaving the Zn/TiO2 material that had a porous morphology obtained from the agarose gel template structure.28 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images (Fig. 1) show that the porous structure of the Zn/TiO2 samples does not vary significantly with variation in the amount of Zn. The pores would enhance electrolyte transport through the electrode for DSC application. The doping of Zn within the TiO2 materials did not alter the surface area significantly, with the specific surface areas as measured by gas sorption (according to the BET theory) being between 60 and 70 m2 g−1 for the samples.

To study the crystal properties of the prepared samples, X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used (Fig. 2). The peaks in the XRD patterns correlate to anatase phase TiO2. The average crystallite diameters of the samples were calculated using the Scherrer equation (Fig. 3). As the doping amount increases the crystallite becomes smaller, which may be attributed to an increase of the Zn–O–Ti bonds in the doped samples inhibiting growth of the crystal grains.31 After the doping concentration rises to 2 at.%, the crystal size remains relatively constant. The Zn in the samples may be incorporated into the structure of the titania lattice or exist as clusters of ZnO adsorbed onto the surface of titania.32 If the Zn is doped in the TiO2 crystal, the unit cell parameters may be altered a little. As the diffractometer used here was calibrated before measurement with the NIST LaB6 standard SRM 660a, the obtained XRD data can be used to calculate the anatase unit cell parameters: a-dimension and c-dimension. The a-dimension showed no significant change (3.784 Å). However, the c-dimension decreased with the increasing Zn quantities until 2 at.%, after which there is little change, as shown in Fig. 3. Kolen'ko et al. also found that the c-dimension decreased as the Zn content increased when doping Zn into TiO2.31 From the XRD data, it can be concluded that the Zn is incorporated in the TiO2 crystal when the doping concentration is no more than 2 at.%, which corresponds to approximately one Zn2+ substitution in every 4 unit cells of anatase. DSCs were constructed using the Zn/TiO2 samples to fabricate the working electrode. The photovoltaic characteristics of the DSCs are given in Table 2. When the Zn content increases, the photovoltage increases, whereas the photocurrent yields a maximum at 0.5 at.%. The Zn doping improved the PCE with the highest performance (7.6%) achieved at 0.5 at.%, much higher than the non-doped sample (6.7%). The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the Z0.0, Z0.5 and Z1.0 devices, Fig. 4, clearly show the superior properties of the Z0.5 device.

As Zn doping in TiO2 is an n-type doping, it would alter the position of the conduction band edge position (VCB) of the TiO2. The VCB relates to the Voc as follows:33 (1)where kBT is the thermal energy, e is the elementary charge, nC is the concentration of electrons in the conduction band, and NC is the effective density of states in the conduction band. Therefore, the doping of Zn in the TiO2 would affect the Voc of the DSC. To estimate the band-gap of the prepared materials, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (shown in ESI Fig. SI1a†) were analyzed. The band-gaps, calculated from extrapolation of the linear dependence of (αhv)1/2 = A1/2(hv − Eg) to the abscissa, are shown in ESI Fig. SI1b.† The band-gap of the Zn/TiO2 materials was increased with the Zn quantities until 2 at.%, after which it remained constant. Thus it appears that 2 at.% Zn is the maximum doping concentration, which is in good agreement with the XRD results. The increase in band-gap in this case indicates an increase in energy of the conduction band edge. Therefore the Voc will increase with the Zn doping concentration according to eqn (1), as shown in Table 2. Above 2 at.%, the Voc kept increasing mainly due to the core–shell effect on the electrode,34 as the additional Zn that was not incorporated within the TiO2 crystal existed as clusters of ZnO adsorbed onto the surface of titania.
In order to confirm the up-shift in the conduction band edge, the flatband potential (Efb) was measured from the Mott–Schottky relationship:35 (2)where Csc is the capacitance of the space charge layer, ε is the dielectric constant of the semiconductor, ε0 is the vacuum permittivity, q is the elementary electric charge, N is the carrier density, E is the applied potential, Efb is the flatband potential, kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Thus Efb is the intercept when extrapolating a straight line from the plot of the inverse square of the space charge capacity against the applied voltage as demonstrated in Fig. 5 (further plots are shown in ESI Fig. SI2†). Clearly, the Z0.5 and Z1 samples had more negative potentials than the Z0 sample, which means that the Fermi level was moved upwards with increasing Zn dopant concentration. Above 2 at.% doping, which is the maximum doping concentration, further change of the Efb is negligible, as shown in ESI Table S1.† These results match the UV-vis diffuse data well. The charge carrier densities (N) were also calculated from the slope of the plot and showed a similar trend (ESI Table S1†). As TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor, the charge carrier here refers to electrons. Since the doping of Zn increases the charge carrier density (electron density), this confirms that Zn doping in TiO2 is an n-type doping, which agrees well with other reports.25

In general, if the recombination rate is retarded, it would improve the performance of the cell. To investigate the reason for the improvement of the 0.5 at.% cell, the dark current was measured, shown in Fig. 4. However the recombination rate of the 0.5 at.% cell was quicker than that of the 0.0 at.% cell. A possible explanation is that Zn doping introduces surface oxygen vacancies (SOVs) within the TiO2, which can easily capture or bind photoinduced electrons, thereby acting as charge recombination centers.32 This results in an increase in the recombination rate. The recombination of photogenerated charge carriers will emit photoluminescence (PL). Hence, PL spectroscopy was employed to analyze the efficiency of photo-generated charge carrier trapping and separation. In ESI Fig. SI3,† all the samples showed similar PL peaks from 400 to 500 nm, which are related to the SOVs of TiO2.36 When Zn was doped into TiO2, resulting in the deficiencies on the surface of TiO2 that act as electron–hole recombination centers, the PL peak intensities increased. However, when the doping concentration reaches 2 at.%, the maximum doping concentration, the PL intensity decreased. As was discussed, the excess Zn exists as ZnO clusters on the surface of TiO2. The clusters can suppress the electron–hole recombination by trapping electrons or holes.37
The Zn doping increases the photocurrent, which benefits the overall efficiency. Normally, the increased photocurrent is the result of higher loading of the dye. To determine if that is the case here, the dye desorption test was used to measure the amount of the dye adsorbed onto the working electrode. The dye-sensitized film was placed in a 0.1 M NaOH H2O/ethanol (1:1, by volume) solution and then UV-vis spectroscopy was used to determine the concentration of the desorbed dye. The UV-vis spectra of the desorbed dye solution of the Z0.0 and Z0.5 sample (ESI Fig. SI4†) show that the Z0.0 sample adsorbed more dye than the Z0.5 sample. In theory, this means the photocurrent of the Z0.0 cell should be larger than the Z0.5 cell as more dye results in the capture of more photons and then generation of more electrons. However, here it is not the case. Therefore, the enhanced photocurrent of the Z0.5 cell does not originate from increased dye adsorption. According to the literature, Zn-doping also improved the photocurrent for photocatalytic application.27 It is the Zn doping that changes the electronic properties of the material itself. A possible reason is that doped Zn favors electron transport in the material as the Zn/TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor, which increases the electron carrier density in the material as shown in ESI Table S1.† Hence, the photocurrent was increased when the nanocrystalline TiO2 was doped with small quantities of Zn. However, if more Zn were added to the TiO2, more defects would occur in the electrode, causing the decrease in performance of the prepared DSC.
Photocurrent transient measurements were conducted to evaluate the photo-electrochemical properties of the materials. Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent produced by Z0.0 and Z0.5 electrodes. The Zn-doping really enhanced the photocurrent. The shape of the photoresponse shows that the pure anatase TiO2 and the Zn/TiO2 were n-type semiconductors as anodic photocurrents were produced.25 The n-type semiconductor favors electron transport due to the more negative charge carriers. Hence, the Zn-doping has altered the photoelectrical properties of the materials, making them more favorable for electron transportation.

Conclusions
Porous Zn-containing TiO2 materials with different Zn content were synthesized by employing agarose gel as a template. The 2 at.% Zn/(Zn + Ti) is the maximum amount of doping for Zn. The performances of the DSCs fabricated using these samples as electrodes were evaluated, yielding the highest solar to electric power conversion efficiency with the 0.5 at.% cell. The improvement is primarily the result of an increased photocurrent, which is not due to more adsorbed dye or a reduced recombination rate. Small amounts of Zn-doping, as an n-type dopant, changed the electronic property of the doped material favoring electron transportation. Therefore, the photocurrent was enhanced by the 0.5 at.% Zn doping, compared with a non-doped sample.
