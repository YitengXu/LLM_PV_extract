    , Accepted 24th October 2012First published on 25th October 2012AbstractEthynyl-linked porphyrin hetero-dimers substituted by a series of electron donors, namely, bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino (BMPA), bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino (BTBPA) and 3,6-di-tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl (DTBC) as well as a reference dimer with a non-donor moiety (3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl, DTBP) have been synthesized to systematically investigate the influence of donor introduction on the photovoltaic performances of near-IR dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) with these sensitizers incorporated. Despite the expected bathochromic shift and intensification of long-wavelength absorption bands as well as elevated LUMO levels and thus increased electron injection driving forces, the substitution of diphenylamino groups (BMPA and BTBPA) with stronger electron-donating abilities gave rise to surprising mediocrity in the short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc), leading to overall energy conversion efficiencies in the order BMPA (3.94%) < DTBP (4.57%) < BTBPA (4.83%) < DTBC (5.21%). A study of the in situ fluorescent behavior of these sensitizers revealed that for all the sensitizers, excited-state lifetimes were significantly shortened in the simulated DSC environment compared to those in a free solution. BMPA showed the shortest intrinsic in situ lifetime while DTBC showed the longest one. These results were correlated with the photovoltaic performances, which is required for a better understanding and further design of porphyrin array sensitizers.
Introduction
For the past two decades, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted worldwide research interest in providing sustainable electricity at low cost and with greater practical as well as aesthetic virtue.1 Although an overall energy conversion efficiency above 11% has been reported with ruthenium complexes,1b,c and more recently, also achieved for the first time by a novel ruthenium-free porphyrin sensitizer2 and organic sensitizers,3 further performance improvements aimed at utilizing a wider range of sunlight still lacks a substantial breakthrough.4 That is, while the extension of the spectral region has long been paid attention to, fundamental insights into long-wavelength sensitizers, especially their photophysical and kinetic behavior in the actual operating environment in DSCs,5 remain relatively less developed. As a result, most of these sensitizers do not perform in proportion to their superior light-harvesting abilities. On the one hand, the narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap required for long-wavelength absorption usually implies reduced driving forces of electron injection or dye regeneration, which are essential for efficient photovoltaic performances. On the other hand, extended π-conjugation frameworks are favoured for superior light-harvesting properties. However, it has been reported that these large aromatic structures may catalyze the recombination of injected electrons and electrolyte redox species, giving rise to low photovoltages.6
As part of the effort on long-wavelength sensitizers, we have been paying special attention to ethynyl-linked porphyrin arrays7–12 that allow moderate electronic conjugation and excitonic coupling and thus serve as promising building blocks for near-IR sensitizers.8 On the other hand, there is growing research interest in donor-substitution, almost exclusively diphenylamino groups, at the meso-positions of porphyrin monomers, which has been demonstrated as a promising strategy to fabricate highly efficient porphyrin-sensitized solar cells.2,13 In parallel, heterocyclic groups, such as carbazole, have been demonstrated both as novel antennas in heteroleptic Ru dyes14 and to serve independently as efficient sensitizers.15 Recently, we have extended the concept of donor-substituted porphyrins for the first time to heterocycle-modified porphyrin oligomers. By combining the strategy of donor substitution and the “built-in” energy gradient of the hetero-dimer taking advantage of the different energy levels of zinc-coordinated and non-coordinated porphyrins,16 we constructed a novel N-fused carbazole–zinc porphyrin–free-base porphyrin triad DTBC and obtained highly efficient light-to-current conversion throughout the visible and near-IR region.12 However, considering the moderate electron-donating ability of carbazole, and also in order to systematically examine the universality and validity of donor–acceptor structures in the innovation of long-wavelength sensitizers, in the present study, ethynyl-linked porphyrin hetero-dimers substituted by a series of electron donors, namely, bis(4-methoxyphenyl)amino (BMPA), bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)amino (BTBPA) and 3,6-di-tert-butylcarbazol-9-yl (DTBC) as well as a reference dimer with a non-donor moiety (3,5-di-tert-butylphenyl, DTBP) have been synthesized. These molecules, with the chemical structures illustrated in Fig. 1, serve as novel prototypes for fundamental investigations of the effects influencing the photovoltaic performances of long-wavelength sensitizers in relation to general photophysical and energetic considerations.

In recent studies, it has been revealed more and more that electron injection could be a critical step limiting the overall energy conversion efficiency5a,17 even for the highly efficient ruthenium dyes.18 However, the prototypes employed in those studies generally do not display significant long-wavelength absorption, for which reason the injection potential is usually sufficiently above the TiO2 conduction band-edge. Therefore, most of the time, the significance of injection kinetics is treated as an independent issue rather than correlated with in situ excited-state lifetimes of the sensitizers, which concertedly participates in the determination of the final injection efficiencies, since there have rarely been opportunities to encounter cases in which injection rates are considerably slow relative to excited-state lifetimes for high-performance sensitizers. However, on the one hand, electron injection from some near-IR sensitizers with low-lying LUMO levels is not so fast since the injection kinetics are very much dependent on the density of electron acceptors in TiO2. Considering the exponential distribution of electron acceptors from below the TiO2 conduction band, even a slight lowering of the injection potentials may correspond to a steep decrease in acceptor densities, especially near the band-edge,19 resulting in the retardation of injection rates by some orders of magnitude.20 On the other hand, the excited-state lifetime is not long enough to support slow electron injection, which may result from the relaxation induced by the huge molecular framework and severe vulnerability to environmental polarity increases due to the large dipole moment or high directionality required for efficient electron transfer.6 In the present study, such a point is systematically investigated by scrutinizing the fluorescent behavior of the sensitizers in a simulated DSC environment.
Experimental section
Synthesis
Carbazole-substituted DTBC was synthesized according to a previously described procedure12 while diphenylamino-substituted BMPA and BTBPA were synthesized in a similar way. The synthesis of the reference compound DTBP was different from that of the donor-substituted porphyrins due to the sufficient solubility of its ester precursor in THF–methanol solution, allowing successful hydrolysis after a Sonogashira coupling reaction. Detailed synthetic routes to the target compounds as well as the intermediates are described in the ESI.†
Spectroscopy
UV–vis absorption spectra of the sensitizers in CHCl3–CH3OH solution and on TiO2 films were measured by a JASCO V-570 UV/VIS/NIR Spectrophotometer. TiO2 films for absorption measurements comprised the transparent part of the photoanodes (see Device fabrication and photovoltaic characterization below). The fluorescence lifetimes in dehydrated toluene solution and on semiconductor films immersed in electrolyte-simulating solutions (see below) were determined by a two-dimensional photon-counting technique using a streak camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K. K., C4334 streakscope) and the exciton pulse source of a mode-locked Ti-sapphire laser (Spectra Physics, Tsunami; frequency-doubled excitation pulse: 400 nm). The total apparatus response function was about 50 ps. A glass cutoff filter was used to isolate the fluorescence from the scattered laser light. Al2O3 and TiO2 films used for transient fluorescence measurements were prepared by screen-printing the corresponding pastes onto an F-doped SnO2 glass substrate (Nippon Sheet Glass). TiO2 paste (Solaronix, 20 nm, 60 m2 g−1) was commercially available while Al2O3 paste was prepared by mixing α-terpineol, ethanol and ethyl cellulose with Al2O3 nano-powder (NanoTek, 31 nm, 55 m2 g−1) which was a gift from C. I. Kasei Co., Ltd. Considering the different particle sizes and specific surface areas of the nano-particles in the two pastes, TiO2 and Al2O3 films with different thicknesses (ca. 6 μm and 10 μm, respectively) were printed in order to obtain matching optical densities in the Q-band regions, as demonstrated in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The as-prepared films were then dyed (see Device fabrication and photovoltaic characterization) and immersed in a 2 mm-pathlength cell containing electrolyte-simulating solutions (see discussion below) to measure the fluorescence decay. For the measurement of lifetimes in solution, the detection wavelength range was 700–800 nm and the total number of iterations was 3000. For the measurement of lifetimes on semiconductor films, the detection wavelength range was 720–820 nm and the total number of iterations was 6000.
Electrochemistry
Electrochemistry was performed with a three-electrode potentiostat (BAS 100B/W Electrochemical Workstation) in dehydrated dichloromethane which was further deoxygenated by bubbling with prepurified argon. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was conducted in a two-compartment cell in which a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode soaked in a saturated KCl solution was connected by a salt bridge to the bulk sample solution where a Pt disk working electrode (BAS) and a Pt wire as a counter electrode were situated. Potentials were calibrated with reference to the Fc+/Fc couple and converted to the NHE scale.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations
Geometry optimization and electronic structure calculations of the porphyrins were performed at the B3LYP/6-31G level of theory using the Gaussian 03 program package.
Device fabrication and photovoltaic characterization
TiO2 films composed of a 16 μm power-generating layer and a 4 μm scattering layer were prepared by repeatedly screen printing TiO2 pastes (Solaronix) onto F-doped SnO2 (FTO, Nippon Sheet Glass) substrates. After all the layers had been printed, the films were calcined at 500 °C for 30 min, treated with TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and calcined once again. After the second calcination, when the temperature was reduced to 80 °C, the films were immediately immersed in chloroform–methanol (volume ratio 2/1) solutions containing 0.2 mM sensitizers and 2 mM chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and kept at 30 °C for 3 hours. After dye loading, the films were taken out, rinsed with ethanol and assembled with commercially available Pt counter electrodes (Geomatec Co., Ltd) with the gap filled with electrolyte separated by a 30 μm spacer (Himilan, DuPont). The electrolyte contained 0.1 M LiI, 25 mM I2, 0.6 M DMPII and 0.2 M TBP in acetonitrile. The active area of the cells was 0.16 cm2.
The current–voltage characteristics of the cells were measured under AM 1.5 G illumination from a solar simulator (CEP-25TF, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). The light intensity was calibrated by a standard silicon cell (BS-520 S/N 235, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). Data were collected by a source meter (Keithley 2400) and the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) was obtained according to the equation η = JscVocFF/Pin, where Jsc is the short-circuit photocurrent density, Voc the open-circuit voltage, FF the fill factor and Pin the incident radiation power. The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured by an IPCE measurement system (SM-250E, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd). A standard silicon solar cell (SiPD S1337-1010BQ, Bunkoukeiki Co., Ltd) was used as a reference and the IPCE values were obtained by comparing the current ratios and the IPCE values of the reference cell at each wavelength.
Results and discussion
Photophysical and electrochemical properties

Fig. 2(a) shows the absorption spectra of the four molecules in CHCl3–methanol (volume ratio 2/1) solution. Corresponding peak positions and molar extinction coefficients are summarized in Table 1. Excitation energies (E0–0) were estimated from the intercepts of the normalized absorption and emission spectra in toluene (Fig. S2, ESI†) and are also listed in Table 1. All four sensitizers displayed two strongly broadened absorption bands between 400 and 500 nm and above 700 nm due to ethynyl-mediated inter-porphyrin conjugation.8 Compared to non-donor-substituted DTBP, the diphenylamino-substituted dimers, BMPA and BTBPA, showed significant red-shifting and intensification of the Q-band absorption, and the effect was greatest for BMPA which has the largest electron-donating ability of the four molecules. In contrast, carbazole-substituted DTBC had almost the same Q-band peak positions as DTBP and slight increments in the extinction coefficients. This is attributed to the low electron density on the carbazole moiety due to the substantial participation of the nitrogen lone electron pair in molecular conjugation, as mentioned previously.12 It is noteworthy that in the Q-band regions, four distinct absorption peaks can be observed for DTBP and DTBC whereas the two peaks at around 530 nm and 649 nm bathochromically degenerated into smooth slopes and flat shoulders, respectively, for BMPA and BTBPA. Considering the exclusive structural differences in the donor/end moieties pendant to the zinc porphyrin edge, this might be tentatively related to the lower rotational probability of DTBP and DTBC (only through the meso-position bond between the aromatic substituent and zinc porphyrin) compared to diphenylamino-substituted BMPA and BTBPA where the rotation through the two phenyl–N (amino) bonds and N (amino)–C (zinc porphyrin) bond is simultaneously possible. In Soret-band regions, compared to non-donor-substituted DTBP, all the donor-substituted dimers showed similarly red-shifted positions of both the sharp low-energy peaks (around 479 nm) that symbolize in-axis coupling of Bx transition dipole moments and the broadened high-energy bands (around 434 nm) that are determined by the distribution of the dihedral angles between By transition dipole moments.8,21 However, the intensities of the split components tended to be more balanced for DTBP, indicating less rotational flexibility as well as a larger deviation from a coplanar conformation of the two porphyrin units. In general, changing donor moieties from carbazole to diphenylamino further enhanced the light absorptivity, especially in long-wavelength regions, and excitation energies were also reduced from the similar values of DTBP and DTBC (1.71 eV) to 1.68 eV for BTBPA and 1.65 eV for BMPA, accounting for the aforementioned excellent photophysical properties.

Transparent TiO2 films were used to measure the UV-visible absorption of the four sensitizers adsorbed on the films. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), when adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films, the four sensitizers showed a similar absorptive trend in the Q-bands as for the solution absorption, that is, BMPA > BTBPA > DTBC ≈ DTBP. In the Soret-band region, the absorption flattened and displayed comparable intensity with the Q-band peaks, which may be due to saturation of the absorption. Comparison between spectra in a toluene solution and on TiO2 thin films, taking DTBC as an example (Fig. 2(c)), clearly revealed similar Q-band peak positions (at around 720 nm for DTBC) and shapes, indicating negligible dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface using 10 equivalencies of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) during the dye loading process. Besides, it is interesting to note that the original absorption tail extending up to 800 nm in solution was hybridized with a newly emerging peak centered at around 920 nm when adsorbed on TiO2. Such a phenomenon has been reported in the literature and can be ascribed to the long-lived porphyrin cation radical generated after diffuse-light-induced electron injection into TiO2.13h In our case, all four sensitizers showed broad but resolute cation radical peaks at around 900 nm, the centers of which also shifted to longer wavelengths in the sequence of increasing electron-donating ability from DTBP to BMPA, demonstrating sufficient dye+/e− (TiO2) interfacial stability.
Fundamental electrochemical properties for assessing energy-level matching in DSCs based on the four sensitizers were characterized by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV, see Fig. S3, ESI†). The first oxidation potentials (ES+/S) were taken as HOMO levels, from which the injection potentials (ES+/S*, LUMO) were estimated by subtracting the excitation energies (E0–0). Corresponding data are also listed in Table 1 and the energy level diagram is plotted in Fig. 3. For all four sensitizers, the LUMO levels were above the TiO2 conduction band edge and the HOMO levels lay below the electrolyte redox potential (I3−/I−),22 indicating thermodynamically feasible electron injection and dye regeneration. As expected, for donor-substituted sensitizers with decreased electron-donating ability from BMPA to DTBC, the LUMO levels were shifted downward from −0.84 to −0.67 V vs. NHE while the HOMO levels underwent an even larger descent from 0.81 to 1.04 V vs. NHE. However, it is still surprising to see that the electron-donating ability of DTBC was attenuated so much that its energy levels were even lower than those of DTBP (−0.73 V vs. NHE for the LUMO level and 0.98 V vs. NHE for the HOMO level) despite their identical molecular bandgaps. Therefore, from the thermodynamic viewpoint concerning energetic matching in DSCs, DTBC was expected to have the least favorable driving force among the four sensitizers, whereas BMPA might hopefully perform the best provided that its superiority in light absorption and the electron injection driving force brought about by the introduction of the strong electron donor could be fully taken advantage of.
 Fig. 3  Schematic energy levels of ethynyl-linked hetero-porphyrin dimers based on redox potentials and excitation energies. 
In order to gain further insight into the photophysical and electrochemical properties, theoretical calculations of molecular energy levels and orbital distributions was carried out based on density functional theory (DFT) and the results are illustrated in Fig. 4. With decreasing electron-donating ability from BMPA to DTBP, the calculated excitation energy increased from 1.91 eV to 2.11 eV, the trend of which exactly matched that obtained from spectroscopic measurements. At the same time, the HOMO levels lay in the sequence BMPA > BTBPA > DTBP > DTBC with a total decrease as large as 0.26 eV, which is also consistent with the electrochemical measurements. As shown in Fig. 3, the calculated energy levels of DTBC in Fig. 4 are also substantially lower even compared with those of non-donor-substituted DTBP. Scrutinizing the electronic characteristics of different energy levels, all four sensitizers shared a similar distribution of LUMO and LUMO + 1 orbitals, preferably on the free-base porphyrin component due to its intended role as an electron acceptor. Therefore, comparable degrees of electronic coupling between the dye LUMO level and the TiO2 3d orbital could be expected, and thus, other causes for variation in photovoltaic performance should be considered. In contrast to the similarity of the LUMO levels, the distribution of the HOMO orbitals was much perturbed in reference to the donor/end moieties. For the HOMO levels, a gradual evolution of distribution partitioning between the donor moiety and the porphyrin was observed from the highly electron-donating BMPA to the degenerated DTBC where the electronic cloud was similarly absent on the carbazole moiety as on the di-tert-butylphenyl group of the DTBP. However, the carbazole moiety in DTBC can still be considered a donor, although admittedly weak, in so far as the HOMO − 1 orbital was exclusively located on it. Furthermore, the orbital centered on the pyrrole carbons of the zinc porphyrin component was found to be in the HOMO − 1 level in the non-donor-substituted DTBP but was located at the HOMO − 2 level for BMPA, BTBPA and DTBC, demonstrating a similar impact of the carbazole moiety compared to the other two diphenylamino donors on the energy level arrangement. As discussed previously,12 the involvement of the HOMO − 1 level in the actual optical transition23 may give rise to a larger transition dipole moment and thus a higher oscillator strength, accounting for the slightly improved extinction coefficient of DTBC compared to DTBP despite their similar molecular bandgaps and Q-band positions.24

Photovoltaic performances

Fig. 5 shows the photovoltaic performance of the four sensitizers in DSCs under the optimized dye-loading conditions mentioned in the experimental section. Corresponding data are listed in Table 2. Combined with spectroscopic and electrochemical measurements, changing the carbazole moiety to more strongly electron-donating diphenylamino groups resulted in considerably enhanced harvesting of longer-wavelength light and elevated injection potentials, which are essential for near-IR dyes generally suffering small injection driving forces. However, the resulting photovoltaic performances were lower than expected. As illustrated in Fig. 5(a), the four sensitizers showed almost indistinguishably low open-circuit voltages (Voc) near 550 mV, which can be attributed to their similar large aromatic molecular systems that catalyze the recombination of electrons in TiO2 and the electrolyte redox species.25 Therefore, the variation in the overall energy conversion efficiency was mainly attributed to different short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc), the trend of which was consistent with the IPCE levels illustrated in Fig. 5(b). The IPCE spectrum of each sensitizer steeply rose from around 900 nm and almost reached a plateau from 800 nm, demonstrating efficient panchromatic sensitization. Although BMPA displayed the most promise in terms of thermodynamics and photophysics, and its IPCE rose from the longest wavelength accordingly, the plateau values were even lower than those of non-donor-substituted DTBP, yielding the poorest photovoltaic performance among the four sensitizers. Another diphenylamino-substituted sensitizer BTBPA showed slightly higher IPCE values than DTBP but still couldn’t match DTBC. This leads to a sequence of Jsc of BMPA (10.55 mA cm−2) < DTBP (12.51 mA cm−2) < BTBPA (13.15 mA cm−2) < DTBC (14.26 mA cm−2), the last of which is consistent with our previous report.12 In other words, enhanced donor–acceptor characteristics in BMPA and BTBPA did not necessarily ensure the desired improvements in device performances, and the smallest injection driving force and inconspicuous light absorptivity of DTBC did not account for the determined drawbacks.

Fluorescence decay and estimation of electron injection rates
As mentioned above, distinct IPCE differences accounted for unexpected variations in overall energy conversion efficiencies. However, it is difficult to interpret the trends as being with or against any trends in light absorption or energy levels alone. Basically, IPCE is the overall effect of light harvesting, electron injection and electron collection. As illustrated in Fig. 2(b), when adsorbed on TiO2 films, BMPA showed significant superiority in light absorption over the other three sensitizers and thus had the highest light-harvesting efficiency. BTBPA was in second place but was only slightly higher than DTBC and DTBP. Obviously, this is insufficient for IPCE interpretation. On the other hand, it has been reported that the charge collection efficiency was mainly determined by the recombination of injected electrons, namely, with oxidized dye cations or with electrolyte redox species.1d In principle, recombination between e− (TiO2) and dye cations depends on the kinetic competition between the electron back flow itself and the dye regeneration. Given comparable electron back flow rates, the faster the regeneration, the less likely it is that electrons are recaptured by dye cations. The dye regeneration rates are sensitive to reaction driving forces.26 In our case, DTBC possessed the largest regeneration driving force due to its lowest HOMO level, whereas BMPA possessed the smallest one thanks to its most destabilized HOMO level (Fig. 3 and Table 1), which seemed to mirror their photovoltaic performances. However, as part of our original design intention, the hetero-combination of donor (D)-substituted zinc porphyrin (ZnP) and free-base porphyrin (H2P) with sequentially lower energy levels implied a positive charge center located far away from the TiO2 surface following photoinduced electron injection, a similar principle to that of well-known triphenylamino-modified Ru-dyes.27 Therefore, as mentioned above, the recombination between dye+ and e− (TiO2) was in itself inactive so that a characteristic long-wavelength band assigned to dye+ could be observed for dyes adsorbed on TiO2 due to the electron injection induced even by ambient light.13h This indicated that the effect of regeneration driving forces may not be dominant since dye+–e− (TiO2) recombination was too slow, which also explained in part why DTBP possessed a larger regeneration driving force but still performed less efficiently compared to BTBPA. As for the electron recombination with electrolyte redox species, considering the indistinguishable Voc of the four sensitizers as well as the identical photoanode structures and electrolyte compositions, it is reasonable to assume similar interfacial conditions and postulate that DSCs incorporating these four sensitizers suffered similar charge recombination rates that are largely determined by the analogously large aromatic frameworks.25
Based on the analysis above, it is essential to look into the electron injection so as to gain some insight regarding the IPCE. Recently, time-correlated single-photon-counting (TCSPC) fluorescence decay techniques have been utilized to study electron injection rates in DSCs based on different kinds of sensitizers, including not only ruthenium sensitizers18 but also metalloporphyrin5a,13h and purely organic sensitizers5b where kinetic data5a,13h or their combination with amplitudes of fluorescence signals5b,18 were analysed. In our case, the fluorescence intensities of samples adsorbed on semiconductor films could be substantially changed by a slight variation in the sample position. Therefore, only kinetic data were used for analysis.

Fig. 6(a) shows the fluorescence decay spectra of the four sensitizers in toluene solution. Detailed data analysis is presented in Fig. S4 (ESI†). All the transients can be fitted well by a mono-exponential decay with the exponents taken as excited-state lifetimes and listed in Table 3. Among the four sensitizers, diphenylamino-substituted BTBPA (1.69 ns) and BMPA (1.45 ns) displayed significantly shorter excited-state lifetimes than DTBC (2.33 ns) and DTBP (2.00 ns) commonly featuring only one pendant substituent to the meso-position of the zinc porphyrin component, which may be related to the higher probability of the rotational relaxation of the diphenylamino groups as mentioned above. The long lifetime of DTBC and the short lifetime of BMPA may be indicative of their photovoltaic performances as two poles within the series, but are still not decisive. Under the actual operating conditions of DSCs, a much more polar environment due to both the solvent (acetonitrile, with a dielectric constant of 37.5 at 25 °C28) and the TiO2 semiconductor film (with a dielectric constant of 80 at 25 °C29) coupled with a high ionic strength in the electrolyte is applied, which may further reduce the excited-state lifetimes.

It is generally recognized that electron injection from excited-state adsorbates to Al2O3 is forbidden due to its sufficiently high conduction band-edge.30 Therefore, the excited-state lifetimes of sensitizers on Al2O3 and TiO2 are different in that an additional deactivation pathway of the excited state is present in the latter case through electron injection. Such a difference could be used to estimate the electron injection rates on TiO2.5a,13h In a separate reference experiment, the loading amounts of the sensitizers on either film were controlled to be comparable and dye aggregation was also confirmed to be negligible (see Fig. 2(c) and Fig. S3, ESI†), therefore, the apparent excited-state lifetimes measured by fluorescence decay can be written as (1) (2)with τAl and τTi being the excited-state lifetimes on Al2O3 and TiO2, and kinj, kf and knr the rate constants of the electron injection, fluorescence and non-radiative pathways, assuming comparable kf and knr on both semiconductors. The electron injection rate could thus be obtained as:5a,13h kinj = τTi−1 − τAl−1(3)The environment for TCSPC measurement on Al2O3 and TiO2 needs delicate consideration. First of all, as discussed above, the solvent alone may impose unpredictable influence on the intrinsic photodynamic behaviours of the sensitizers. Moreover, the interfacial energetics could be drastically changed by the chemical complexity of the electrolyte environment, in particular the TiO2 conduction band-edge position is strongly determined by the presence of adsorptive species, moved either upward by electron-donating reagents such as TBP,31 or downward by small cations such as Li+ and H+.32 All these may dramatically change the injection dynamics of the sensitizers.18a Therefore, a solution environment simulating the features of real electrolytes was adopted in order to recover the in situ photophysical behaviors of the dyes in DSCs as much as possible. On the other hand, the excitation laser pulse from our instrument was fixed at 400 nm, where I2 has a considerable absorption and may thus result in insufficient excitation of the samples. Therefore, I2 was precluded from the electrolyte-simulating solution. Meanwhile, considering that it is Li+ rather than the large imidazolium cation that mainly determines the TiO2 conduction band-edge,33 the imidazolium iodide source 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII) was also not incorporated. Finally, dyed Al2O3 or TiO2 samples were immersed in acetonitrile solution containing 0.1 M LiI and 0.2 M (TBP) and the fluorescence decay was recorded.

Fig. 6(b) compares the “intrinsic” (i.e. the same as that on TiO2 except for electron injection) in situ deactivation of the excited states of the four sensitizers adsorbed on the Al2O3 films immersed in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiI and 0.2 M TBP. Detailed data analysis is presented in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Distinct non-exponential characteristics can be observed for each case,5a,13h which may be attributed to the heterogeneity of the semiconductor surfaces and thus their interactions with the adsorbed dyes.34 Such transients can be fitted well by a bi-exponential decay and the weighted average of the two exponents were taken as the lifetimes,13hi.e., τAl = A1τ1 + A2τ2, Ai representing relative amplitudes subject to ΣiAi = 1. All the kinetic data on the Al2O3 films are also summarized in Table 3. Time constant data of similar orders of magnitude have been reported recently in the literature concerning in situ excited-state lifetimes of porphyrin sensitizers,5a demonstrating the validity of our measurements. It is clearly shown that even theoretically without electron injection (on Al2O3), excited states became short-lived in simulated operating conditions compared to those in toluene solution. In the literature,5a,35 such a unique phenomenon for porphyrin dyes in contrast to ruthenium dyes36 was ascribed to either oxidative or reductive quenching of excited states by electrolyte redox species.37 However, contributions from the large change in the environmental polarity as mentioned above are also considerable, and are the most important for BMPA with the most donor–acceptor character among the four molecules, concerning its unrivaled in situ shortening of the excited-state lifetime by 83%. Preluding electron injection, excited-state lifetimes (τAl) of the four sensitizers in a simulated DSC environment remained in the same order as that in toluene solution despite reduced amplitudes, that is, BMPA (0.24 ns) < BTBPA (0.53 ns) < DTBP (0.63 ns) < DTBC (0.83 ns).

Fig. 6(c) compares the in situ deactivation of the excited states of the four sensitizers adsorbed on TiO2 films immersed in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 M LiI and 0.2 M TBP. Non-exponential characteristics can still be observed, which may result from not only the heterogeneous dye-semiconductor interaction as in the alumina case but also the dispersed electron injection rates for each sensitizer on each specific TiO2 film due to distributed densities of electron acceptors with different energy levels.5b,19a The kinetic data and calculated electron injection rates based on the fitting to bi-exponential decays are also listed in Table 3. Detailed data analysis is presented in Fig. S6 (ESI†). For all the sensitizers, the lifetimes on TiO2 were further shortened as expected due to electron injection. The sequence remains BMPA (0.19 ns) < BTBPA (0.38 ns) < DTBP (0.54 ns) < DTBC (0.68 ns). However, the fluorescence decay on TiO2 is the overall result of all kinds of deactivation pathways, including electron injection and self-relaxation in particular. Therefore, unlike the decay on Al2O3 which could be roughly considered to be self-relaxation and is thus comparable between the sensitizers to identify their intrinsic properties, the decay on TiO2 could apparently not by itself give any information. When treated mathematically with the decay on Al2O3 according to eqn (3), the calculated electron injection rates (kinj) show the trend DTBC (0.28 ns−1) < DTBP (0.30 ns−1) < BTBPA (0.79 ns−1) < BMPA (1.10 ns−1). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the electronic distribution of LUMO orbitals was similar for all four sensitizers, it can be therefore expected that the electronic couplings between the LUMO levels and TiO2 3d orbitals were also comparable. Electron injection rates would thus be mainly determined by the driving forces. According to Fig. 3 and Table 1, from DTBC to DTBP to BTBPA to BMPA, the injection driving forces increased due to enhanced electron-donating abilities of the donor/end moieties, and this trend was clearly reflected in the calculated injection rates. However, the overall effect of electron injection is synergically determined by both electron injection and intrinsic in situ deactivation of excited states. For BMPA with the largest electron-donating ability, although the fastest electron injection was achieved, unfortunately, the intrinsic in situ excited-state lifetime was really short which completely eliminated the advantage in the injection rate. In contrast, the slow electron injection rate of DTBC was much compensated for by its long excited-state lifetime so that the best photovoltaic performance, mainly attributed to the largest Jsc, could be achieved despite its relatively weak light absorptivity and the smallest injection driving force. As for DTBP and BTBPA, although the latter displayed a slightly shorter intrinsic in situ excited-state lifetime than the former, it may inject electrons much faster according to its considerably larger kinj. This coupled with its better light harvesting ability means it gives rise to better photovoltaic performances. It is noteworthy that the superiority of BMPA in light absorption also to some extent counteracted its poor electron injection, but the effect is marginal and does not result in substantial compensation.
In recent studies concerning donor-substituted porphyrin monomer sensitizers, comparable excited-state lifetimes in solution were reported.13b However, injection issues were not taken into account due to the assertion that electron injection was generally ultrafast on a time scale of 0.1–1 ps.38 In our study, it is definitely revealed that excited-state lifetimes play a crucial role in determining the photovoltaic performances, especially for some sensitizers whose injection rates are not so fast. Besides small electron injection driving forces, the slow electron injection rates of these four sensitizers may also originate from the relatively weak electronic coupling between the LUMO and the Ti 3d orbitals as expected from Fig. 4. In this regard, engineering in the anchoring groups with better electronic coupling with titania, such as cyanoacrylic acid,39 is the direction of our further efforts. However, even this could be overcome by more delicate molecular modification, excited-state lifetimes might themselves be significantly shortened in the DSC environment compared to those in solution, and the degree of shortening is also related to dye structures even using the same electrolyte composition. In such cases, the in situ excited-state lifetimes are thus not sufficiently long to support slow electron injection, giving rise to overall injection efficiencies that are highly dependent on excited-state lifetimes. It should be pointed out that the elaboration above contains certain assumptions, and also the time scale of our instrument imposed limitations on the elucidation. Currently we cannot find other reasons for the unexpected mediocrity of the diphenylamino-substituted BMPA and BTBPA. Even so, the fact that the IPCE is greatly influenced by the intrinsic in situ excited-state lifetimes is still indicative of the need for further design of long-wavelength sensitizers. Investigations employing photophysical measurements with even faster time scales such as ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and fluorescence up-conversion femtosecond spectroscopy are now underway towards an even deeper understanding.
Conclusions
Efforts in terms of molecular variation have been devoted to gaining deeper insight into donor-substituted ethynyl-linked porphyrin hetero-dimers. Based on our previously reported N-fused carbazole-substituted dimer DTBC, two other diphenylamino-substituted dimers BMPA and BTBPA with stronger electron-donating abilities as well as one reference compound DTBP without a donor moiety have been designed and synthesized. The introduction of stronger electron donors did enhance light harvesting and promote injection energy levels. However, these failed to generate improved photovoltaic performances as expected. Transient fluorescence measurement showed that although electron injection occurred at higher rates for diphenylamino-substituted BMPA and BTBPA due to their significantly larger electron injection driving forces, such an advantage was counteracted by the short in situ excited-state lifetimes, yielding a sequence of overall energy conversion efficiencies of BMPA (3.94%) < DTBP (4.57%) < BTBPA (4.83%) < DTBC (5.21%) in accordance with their relative Jsc values.
As a general indication, the in situ excited-state dynamics could be a crucial factor influencing the photovoltaic performances of some near-IR dyes. To further release their enormous potentials for excellent light harvesting, intrinsic excited-state dynamics need to be taken into account as an important perspective, especially the relative values of electron injection rates. The aim is at accelerating electron injection while protracting excited states by both molecular engineering and electrolyte optimization.
