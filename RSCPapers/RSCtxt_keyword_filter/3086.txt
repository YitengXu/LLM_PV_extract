    , Accepted 3rd October 2016First published on 4th October 2016AbstractA series of novel triphenylamine (TPA)-based dyes that use double linkers between the electron donor and the electron acceptor are synthesized, characterized, and applied as photosensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cells. The dyes contain N-methylpyrrole (NMP) (MTPA-2 dye) and styrene (St) (STPA-2 dye), respectively, linkers on TPA. These linkers are expected to generate effective π-conjugation forming donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) links. The photovoltaic performance of the dyes depends on the linker type. For the dual-St-π-linked dye, the charge transfer from the excited dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2 is improved, making the efficiency of the corresponding devices higher than those of dye-based devices with NMP linkers and no linkers. The device with the dye bearing positions of C3 and C4 on NMP linkers has the lowest conjugation effect and efficiency. In particular, the STPA-2 dye shows a broad incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency response with a signal of up to 700 nm, covering most of the ultraviolet-visible light region. Device efficiencies of 5.43% and 7.56% for dye-sensitized devices using the STPA-2 dye and the cis-RuL2(NCS)2 (N3) dye, respectively, were fabricated using the same method and measured under AM 1.5 irradiation.
1. Introduction
Solar energy is a clean renewable energy resource. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), effective devices for converting sunlight into electricity,1,2 have been extensively investigated because of their high theoretical power conversion efficiency (PCE), facile fabrication processes, and potential low cost.1 Ruthenium(II) polypyridyl complexes have been shown to be highly efficient sensitizers with a PCE of over 11%.3 However, the high cost and toxicity of Ru(II) sensitizers limit their application in DSSCs. Recently, DSSC devices using zinc-porphyrin sensitizers achieved an efficiency of ca. 12% by employing the CoII/CoIII electrolyte under standard conditions.4–6 However, the complex synthetic process and low yield of porphyrin sensitizers restrict their widespread use in DSSCs. Organic dyes are feasible alternatives due to their practical advantages, such as facile structure tuning, an easy synthesis process, and low cost.7 Organic sensitizers are generally designed to link the electron donor and the electron acceptor. A TiO2 surface-anchoring group, such as carboxylate, is integrated at the acceptor end. Upon light irradiation, these dipolar molecules induce intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor, and the electron is then injected into TiO2via the anchoring group.
Several dipolar organic dyes have been reported as sensitizers in DSSCs, including coumarin-,8 perylene-,9 xanthene-,10 thiophene-,11 oligoene-,12 indoline-,13,14 and triarylamine-based15,16 dyes. An ideal sensitizer must have a sufficiently high lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level for efficient electron injection into TiO2 and a sufficiently low highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level for the efficient regeneration of the oxidized state. Additionally, an ideal sensitizer should have an absorption band ranging from the visible region to near-infrared (IR) as well as enough spatial separation between the positive charge on the dye and the electron. We developed some organic sensitizers for application in solar cells and recently reported a series of efficient DSSCs using dipolar triarylamine/rhodanine-3-acetic acid (or 2-cyanoacetic acid) sensitizers.15–21 We showed that the introduction of two acid groups into the triphenylamine (TPA) unit as electron acceptors improved its photovoltaic performance due to an increase in the red shift and broadening of the absorption spectrum.15,22 The dyes linked two acceptors (carboxylic acids) that appear to help convey the charge transfer from the excited dye molecules to the conduction band of TiO2, leading to a higher efficiency of the assembled devices. Electrochemical impedance measurements support the effect of these dyes on enhancing the charge transfer of TiO2 (e−).
The present study systematically extends our previous studies to synthesize organic dyes containing triarylamine as the electron donor, a series of double donor–π–acceptor (D–π–A) linkers as the conjugation segments, and double acid groups as the electron acceptors. Organic dyes configured with two D–π–A structures can enable efficient photo-induced charge separation.23–25 Two electron-rich π-conjugated linkers/electron acceptors can induce efficient intramolecular charge transfer and extend the spectral response to low-energy solar photons with good electron delocalization over the whole molecule, facilitating donor–acceptor interactions.26 Therefore, we chose two electron-rich conjugated linkers, namely N-methylpyrrole (NMP) and styrene (St), as the π-linkers. The double π-linkers were strategically incorporated into the triarylamine donor at the C3 and C4 positions in NMP linkers, and carboxylic acids were bound to the linker sites as compared to the 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) linkers at the C2 and C5 positions (ETPA-2 dye) and without linkers (TPAR-2 dye), (2Z,2′Z)-3,3′-(7,7′-(4,4′-(phenylazanediyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(2,3-dihydrothieno[3,4-b][1,4]dioxine-7,5-diyl))bis(2-cyanoacrylic acid) (ETPA-2)27 and (2Z,2′Z)-3,3′-(7,7′-(4,4′-(phenylazanediyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(rhodanine-3-acetic acid)) (TPAR-2),15 after electron injection may prevent electron back-transfer from TiO2 to the oxidized dye. The molecular structures of these dyes are: 2-(E-5-(4-(4-((4-(4-((Z)-(3-(carboxymethyl)-4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-5-ylidene)methyl)styryl)phenyl)(phenyl)amino)styryl)benzylidene)-4-oxo-2-thioxothiazolidin-3-yl)acetic acid (STPA-2) and (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(4,4′-(4,4′-(phenylazanediyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(1-methyl-1H-pyrrole-4,3-diyl))bis(2-cyanoacrylic acid) (MTPA-2), respectively.

2.4. TiO2 mesoporous electrode
To synthesize a hydrothermally processed TiO2 colloid, 3 g of TiO2 nanoparticles (P25, Degussa AG, Germany, a mixture of approximately 30% rutile and 70% anatase phases) was dispersed in 100 mL of 10 N NaOH and heated to 130 °C in an autoclave for 1 d. The precipitate was then redispersed in 100 mL of 1 N HNO3. This suspension was subsequently subjected to autoclaving at 240 °C for 12 h to produce the TiO2 colloid. The TiO2 samples were baked at 450 °C in air for 30 min. The Raman spectra of the TiO2 nanoparticles revealed a pure anatase phase that corresponded to wavenumbers of 150, 400, 517, and 638 cm−1. The X-ray diffraction patterns of the titanate-derived TiO2 confirmed the presence of a pure anatase phase. The average crystal size was calculated to be approximately 20 nm using Scherrer's equation. The solution of the TiO2 colloid was mixed with polyethylene glycol (PEG-2000) (Fluka) to form a viscous TiO2 dispersion at a 0.15 PEG/TiO2 ratio. This dispersion was spin-coated onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass (10 Ωgl, Hartford) to form a TiO2 film of 0.25 cm2. The thickness of the TiO2 film was maintained at approximately 7 μm. The film was dried in air at 120 °C for 30 min and calcined at 450 °C for 30 min.
2.5. Assembly and characterization of DSSCs
Dye solutions with concentrations of 0.3 mM in a mixed solvent of toluene and acetonitrile (1:4 volume ratio) were used for the dye adsorption process. After the TiO2 films were heated at 450 °C for 30 min, the films of 105 °C were instantly immersed into the dye solution (and kept at 25 °C) for 12 h. The dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrodes were subsequently used as photoelectrodes. A platinum counter electrode was coated onto FTO glass (10 Ω □−1, Hartford) via spin-coating processes. The dye-loaded anode and the Pt counter electrode were sealed together with a sealing material, SX1170 (Solaronix), around the TiO2 active area of 0.25 cm2. The electrolyte contained 0.6 M 1-propyl-2,3-dimethylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodine, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile (MPN).
2.6. Measurements
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AV400 FT-NMR spectrometer (400 MHz). The XPS measurements were performed using ESCA 210 and MICROLAB 310D (VG Scientific Ltd) spectrometers. XPS spectra were recorded under Mg Kα (hν = 1253.6 eV) irradiation as the photon source with a primary tension of 12 kV and an emission current of 20 mA. The analysis chamber pressure during the scans was kept at approximately 10−10 mbar. The IR spectra were recorded using a Perkin-Elmer RXI FT-IR spectrometer. The absorption spectra were obtained using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 25 ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometer. The photoluminescence spectra were measured using a spectrofluorimeter (Hitachi, F-7000) with the excitation wavelength of the respective dye set at the λmax of the UV-Vis spectrum. For both excitation and emission, a slide width of 5 nm, an amplitude tube potential of 700 V, and auto response time were employed to sweep from 300 to 800 nm at a scan rate of 20 nm s−1. The thickness of the TiO2 films was determined using an α-step instrument (Surfocorder TE 2400M, Tosaka Lab Ltd). The electrochemical experiments were performed using an electrochemical analyzer (PGSTAT 30, AUTOLAB Electrochemical Instrument, The Netherlands). All measurements were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a platinum working electrode, a platinum wire auxiliary electrode, and a non-aqueous Ag/AgNO3 reference electrode. The potential separation (ΔEp) values were determined as (Epa − Epc), where Epa and Epc are the anodic and cathodic peak potentials, respectively. The potentials are quoted against the ferrocene internal standard. The electrochemical experiments used a mixed solvent of acetonitrile/AcOH (7/1, v/v) and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate as the supporting electrolyte. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using a Keithley-2400 digital source meter controlled by a computer at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1. An Oriel 500 W xenon lamp served as the light source in conjunction with an AM 1.5 global filter (Oril 81094), used to remove UV and IR radiation and give 100 mW cm−2 at the surface of the test cell. The light source was calibrated using a USB 400 plug-and-play miniature fiber optic spectrometer (Ocean, USA) to give AM 1.5 simulated sunlight. The active area of the testing cell was 0.25 cm2.
2.7. Theoretical approach methodology
The Gaussian 03 package30 was used for the theoretical calculations. To model the electronic state of the TPAR-2 dyes on the TiO2 surface, the dye's potassium salt was employed to simulate the dye bonded to the TiO2 surface in its carboxylate form.15 The B3LYP method with a 6-31G(d) basis set was applied to optimize the ground state geometries of STPA-2 and MTPA-2. The minimum energy structures were confirmed by the absence of imaginary frequencies.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis of dyes
STPA-2 and MTPA-2 organic dyes were synthesized and employed in DSSCs. The synthetic processes of STPA-2 are illustrated in Scheme 1. The di-aldehyde groups were first linked to the TPA molecule using the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction with aldehyde groups, producing 4,4′-(phenylazanediyl)dibenzaldehyde (1). Compound 1 was reduced by the reagents of Ph3PCH3I/t-BuOK to form N-phenyl-4-vinyl-N-(4-vinylphenyl)aniline (2). Then, compound 2 and 4-bromobenzaldehyde were reacted with suitable catalysts using the Mizoroki–Heck reaction in a basic solution to obtain the intermediate of TSC2. The final organic dye (STPA-2) was then synthesized through nucleophilic addition and dehydration between the aldehyde group on TSC2 and the methylene of rhodanine-3-acetic acid using the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The structures of the intermediates (1–2, TSC2) and the product (STPA-2) were confirmed by NMR and IR spectroscopy, respectively. The 1H-NMR spectra of STPA-2 are shown in Fig. 1. The proton signals of the DMSO-d6 solvent and H2O are at 2.50 and 3.31 ppm, respectively. The proton signals of the benzene rings and St π-linkers are distributed from 7.00 to 7.93 ppm. The signals of 7.22 and 7.41 ppm correspond to the –CHCH– of St with an integral value of 4. The signal of 9.96 ppm corresponds to the –CH of aldehyde groups on St linkers, obtained through the Knoevenagel condensation reaction with methylene on rhodaniline-3-acetic acids. The signals of 4.70 and 13.50 ppm correspond to the protons of –N-2-COOH and –N-CH2-, respectively, on rhodaniline-3-acetic acid. The integral values of –N-2-COOH and –N-CH2- are 4 and 2, respectively. These results indicate that there are two St segments and two rhodaniline-3-acetic acid groups on STPA-2. The Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of STPA-2 are given in the ESI† (Fig. 1S).

The synthetic processes of MTPA-2 are illustrated in Scheme 2. The 1H-NMR spectra of MTPA-2 are shown in Fig. 2. The signal of 9.58 ppm corresponds to the –CH of aldehyde groups on NMP, obtained through the Knoevenagel condensation reaction with methylene on 2-isocyanoacetic acid. The integral value of 13.80 ppm was set at 2 as the basis of estimation, which is equal to the proton number of the carboxylic groups in an MTPA-2 molecule. The proton signals on the benzene ring are distributed from 6.91 to 7.48 ppm. The relative integral values of the C–H signals from the left to right side are 1, 4, 2, 2, and 4. The total integral value is 13, equal to the proton number of the benzene ring in TPA. In addition, the integral value of the C–H signals is 6 at 3.87 pm, which corresponds to the proton number of the methyl group in N-methylpyrrole. The total integral value of proton signals is 23, which is in agreement with the number of hydrogens in the MTPA-2 dye molecule. All of the peaks were assigned to the hydrogen atoms of the recurring unit. These spectra agree well with the proposed molecular structures of the two dyes. The FTIR spectra of MTPA-2 are given in the ESI† (Fig. 2S).

To investigate the frontier molecular orbitals of STPA-2 and MTPA-2 dyes with bidentate carboxylate coordination to potassium, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were conducted using the Gaussian 03 program at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The electron distributions of the HOMOs and LUMOs of the two dyes are shown in Fig. 3. For the HOMO of the STPA-2 dye, the electron density is mainly distributed on the TPA skeleton (donor) and adjacent St π-linkers. The LUMO of the dye delocalizes electron distribution through the isocyanoacetic acids (acceptors), adjacent St π-linkers, and benzene rings of the TPA molecule adjacent the St π-linker in the process of charge transfer. This indicates that conjugation effects exist in the chains of this dye molecule, enhancing the intramolecular charge transfer along the π-conjugated St linkers.31 This type of electron distribution of the HOMO and LUMO of STPA-2 indicates that HOMO–LUMO excitation moves the electron from the TPA donor to the cyanoacrylic acid acceptors through the St π-linker groups, ensuring efficient charge separation and electron injection. In the HOMO state of the MTPA-2 dye, the electrons are mainly distributed on the TPA skeleton (donor) and the adjacent NMP π-linker. In the excited state of the LUMO, the intramolecular charge transfer results in electron movement from the donor skeleton to the NMP π-linkers and acceptor groups (isocyanoacetic acids). Conjugation effects were not observed in the chains of this dye molecule because there were no remaining electrons on the benzene rings of the TPA molecule adjacent the NMP linker in the process of charge transfer, unlike for the STPA-2 dye. This shows that the NMP π-linker cannot enhance the electron movement when it binds the donor (TPA) and acceptors across a single bond at the C3 and C4 positions in the NMP rings of the MTPA-2 dye, leading to a more difficult injection of electrons into the TiO2 photoelectrode by MTPA-2 (i.e., the Eg value is greater).

3.3. Photophysical and electrochemical properties
To compare the effects of different π-linkers, St, EDOT, and NMP segments were bonded onto the TPA frame structures, respectively. The absorption spectra of the dyes adsorbed on the TiO2 surface are shown in Fig. 4(a). The absorption spectra of the adsorbed STPA-2 dye on the TiO2 surface exhibit relatively obvious red shifts compared to those of the as-synthesized dyes of ETPA-2,27 (TPAR-2),15 and MTPA-2. This result indicates that the dyes were adsorbed on the TiO2 surface with only partial J-type aggregates26 and that the carboxylic acid of STPA-2 was anchored on TiO2, forming a stable excited state. The absorption ranges of these synthesized dyes are in the order STPA-2 > ETPA-2 > TPAR-2 > MTPA-2. These results are related to the energy band gap (see below).

Based on the Tauc relation,32 the energy gap (Eg) can be obtained by plotting (αhν)2vs. hν and extrapolating the linear portion of (αhν)2 to zero, as shown in Fig. 4(b). The red shift of the STPA-2 dye is evidenced by its lower energy band gap compared to those of the as-synthesized dyes of ETPA-2, TPAR-2, and MTPA-2. The St π-linkers in the STPA-2 dye lead to more efficient excitation of electrons on the dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface, leading to a lower Eg. This is ascribed to the resonance interaction in the coplanar St segment between the electron donor (TPA) and the electron acceptor (rhodaniline-3-acetic acid), leading to a more efficient transport of the excited electrons on the molecular chains of the STPA-2 dye. The magnitude of Eg values of these dyes is consistent with their absorption ranges. The Eg values of these synthesized dyes are in the order STPA-2 < ETPA-2 < TPAR-2 < MTPA-2, implying that the St π-linkers lead to a more efficient electron-hole separation than that obtained with EDOT and NMP linkers. In the ETPA-2 dye, the EDOT π-linkers are bonded at the C2 and C5 positions in the thiophene rings, yielding alternating single and double bonds in this hetero-ring, which can conjugate with the adjacent donor (TPA) and acceptors (rhodaniline-3-acetic acids). However, EDOT has a non-planar structure. The sp3-hybridized carbon atoms connected to the oxygen atoms do not lie on the same plane as the rest of the molecule. There are two possibilities for the space orientation of these carbon atoms: (1) both carbon atoms are above or below the molecular plane (kinked), or (2) one of the carbon atoms is above and the other is below the molecular plane (twisted). In the twisted structure, the oxygen atoms are only 0.8° above and below the backbone, which indicates that the p-lone pairs of the oxygen atoms have slightly higher π-orbital interaction with the conjugated system. However, the optimum planar arrangement of the EDOT segment of the ETPA-2 dye is hindered by ethylenedioxyl groups. Thus, resonance effects are reduced by this steric effect compared to those of the STPA-2 dye, resulting in a slightly larger Eg value. The NMP π-linkers are bonded at the C3 and C4 positions in the NMP rings, connecting the donor (TPA) and acceptors (isocyanoacetic acids) across a single bond in this hetero-ring, which cannot conjugate with the adjacent donor (TPA) and acceptors, leading to difficult transport of the excited electrons from the donor (TPA) to the acceptors on the molecular chains of the MTPA-2 dye. The Eg value of MTPA-2 is much higher than that of the TPAR-2 dye.
Cyclic voltammetry can be used to determine the redox properties of organic materials. The experimental values of the HOMO, LUMO, and Eg of each of the compounds were obtained using cyclic voltammetry and UV-Vis spectroscopy (Fig. 4(b)).33 The dyes can be reversibly oxidized at moderately high oxidation potentials. Representative cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of N3, STPA-2, MTPA-2, ETPA-2,27 and TPAR-215 dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films in an acetonitrile/AcOH (7/1, v/v) solution containing 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium tetrafluoroborate (TBABF4) are shown in Fig. 5. One redox couple was detected in these dyes, indicating that a one-electron oxidation wave of the amine was observed in the range of 600–1800 mV (vs. Ag/Ag+). The electrochemical data obtained for the dye compounds are provided in Table 1. The HOMO energy level can be calculated from the onset oxidation potential [Eox(onset)] based on the reference energy level of ferrocene (4.8 eV below the vacuum level, which is defined as zero) as HOMO = −[Eox(onset) − EFc + 4.8] eV(1) LUMO = HOMO + Eg(2)where EFc is the potential of the internal standard (i.e., the ferrocene/ferrocenium ion (Fc/Fc+) couple). The value of EFc, which is determined under the same experimental conditions, is approximately 0.25 V vs. Ag/Ag+. The excited state (LUMO) of the sensitizer was estimated from the ground state (HOMO) and the band gap (Eg) derived from the absorption onset (Fig. 4(b)). The LUMO values (see Table 1) are higher than the conduction band-edge energy level of the TiO2 electrode, −4.0 eV,33 indicating that the electron injection process is energetically favorable. The related energy levels are listed in Table 1. Moreover, the oxidation potentials of the dyes are more positive than the I−/I3− redox couple (∼0.4 V vs. normal hydrogen electrode).34 A sufficiently low HOMO energy level of the dye will ensure more effective dye regeneration and suppress the recapture of injected electrons by dye cations. The LUMO values of these dyes are in the order STPA-2 < ETPA-2 < TPAR-2 < MTPA-2, implying that the π-linkers of St lead to more efficient electron–hole separation than that obtained with EDOT and NMP linkers. Of note, the TPAR-2 dye has the smallest potential separation (ΔEp = 0.21 V) among the dyes, indicating that the TPAR-2 dye has the best electrochemical reversibility. This suggests that the dye molecules of TPA-carboxylic acid without π-linkers generate an electrochemically active material that increases the attachment possibility of cations, such as Li+ and H+, in the electrolyte. Consequently, the electron–hole recombination rate is relatively fast in the TPAR-2 dye compared to those of dyes with π-linker segments between the donor and the acceptor. In contrast, the MTPA-2 dye has the greatest potential separation (ΔEp = 1.902 V) among the dyes, indicating that the MTPA-2 dye has the lowest electrochemical reversibility. This indicates that the electrons in the TPA donor are not easily conveyed to acceptors through the NMP (C3- and C4-linking)-π-linkers compared to the dyes with St (C2- and C5-linking)- and EDOT-π-linkers and moderate potential separation (ΔEp = 1.4–1.7 V). This implies that the electrons in the MTPA-2 dye are relatively difficult to inject into the TiO2 layer compared to those in the other dyes because NMP π-linkers are bonded at the C3 and C4 positions in the NMP rings, connecting the donor (TPA) and acceptors across a single bond in the hetero-ring, which cannot conjugate with the adjacent donor (TPA) and acceptors, leading to difficult transport of the excited electrons from the donor (TPA) to the acceptors on the molecular chains of the MTPA-2 dye. Through St-π-linking and EDOT C2- and C5-π-linking, the values of potential separation in STPA-2 and ETPA-2 dyes are close to that (ΔEp = ∼1.706 V) of the N3 dye, implying that the St and EDOT C2- and C5-π-linkers can conjugate along donor–π–acceptor chains, which have moderate potential separation, providing more efficient electron–hole separation in STPA-2 and ETPA-2 dyes under light irradiation.

The photoluminance spectra of dyes adsorbed on TiO2 are shown in Fig. 6. The intensity of light emission is in the order MTPA-2 > TPAR-2 > ETPA-2 > STPA-2 > N3, which is completely opposite to that of the energy gap (Eg). This indicates that the recombination of electron–hole pairs is relatively insignificant in the STPA-2 dye when the dye molecules are excited,35 implying that the lifetime of an electron in the photoanode is relatively long in the STPA-2 dye. This suggests that STPA-2-based DSSCs will have a higher efficiency compared to those of other TPA-based dye devices.

3.4. Photovoltaic devices
DSSCs were fabricated using these dyes as the sensitizers with an effective area of 0.25 cm2, nanocrystalline anatase TiO2 particles, and an electrolyte composed of 0.6 M DMPII, 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M iodine, and 0.5 M TBP in MPN. Light irradiation from a 500 W xenon lamp was focused through a monochromator onto the tested photovoltaic cell. The incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) of a DSSC was estimated between 400 and 800 nm according to the following equation:5 IPCE(λ) = [1240Jsc (mA cm−2)]/[λ (nm) φ (mW cm−2)](3)where λ is the wavelength, Jsc is the short-circuit density, and φ is the power of the incident radiation per unit area. The light intensity was measured using a USB 400 fiber optic spectrometer. Fig. 7(a) shows the IPCE of the DSSCs as a function of wavelength. It is apparent that the photocurrent response of the STPA-2-sensitized DSSC has a higher value (exceeding 50%) in the range of 500–580 nm compared to those for DSSCs based on ETPA-2, TPAR-2, and MTPA-2 dyes. The maximum IPCE value of 56% occurs at 520 nm. The decrease in the IPCE above 600 nm (i.e., in the long-wavelength region) is attributed to the decrease in the light harvesting by these dyes. The lower photocurrent response of the MTPA-2, TPAR-2, and ETPA-2-sensitized devices is ascribed to the blue shift in the absorption spectra of the dye with a higher energy band gap compared to that of the STPA-2 dye. A similar data acquisition system was used to obtain the overall efficiencies (η) of the DSSC devices. Devices with different TiO2 thicknesses were also produced to optimize device performance. A decrease in the film thickness resulted in a slight increase in the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and a decrease in Jsc. The device with a ∼7 μm film thickness had the best conversion efficiency and fill factor. A thicker film resulted in better light harvesting at the expense of dark-current suppression. The value of η is calculated from Jsc, Voc, fill factor (FF) of the cell, and intensity of incident light (Pin) as follows:36 η = [JscVoc(FF)/Pin](4)
 Fig. 7  (a) IPCE spectra and (b) photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSSCs based on the different dyes under AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2). 
The J–V curves of the DSSCs are shown in Fig. 7(b). The curve of the STPA-2-based DSSC is higher than those of the MTPA-2-, TPAR-2-, and ETPA-2-based DSSCs. These results are consistent with those of the IPCE measurements. The performance statistics of the fabricated DSSCs with these dyes under AM 1.5 illumination is listed in Table 2. Note that the adsorbed dye density is similar for all cells (STPA-2, 2.31 × 10−7; ETPA-2, 2.40 × 10−7; TPAR-2, 2.39 × 10−7; MTPA-2, 2.41 × 10−7 mol cm−2), and that the influence of the dye density on cell performance is insignificant (see below). As shown in Fig. 7(b), the STPA-2-based DSSC has the highest Voc and Jsc values (648 mV and 8.99 mA cm−2, respectively). This result is attributed to D–π–A conjugation, the major St π-linker of the STPA-2 resonance structure that can inhibit dark current,37 because the Voc is inversely proportional to the dark current. The Voc values are in the order STPA-2 > ETPA-2 > TPAR-2 > MTPA-2, indicating that Voc increases with the introduction of an appropriate conjugated π-linker (such as St on STPA-2 and C2-, C5-EDOT on ETPA-2). This result is consistent with the device efficiency results. The values of the FF and Voc for the TPAR-2-based DSSCs are lower than those for the STPA-2- and ETPA-2-based DSSCs. The TPAR-2 molecule has no π-linker to give a stable conjugation of electrons between the donor and the acceptor, providing an increase in the attachment possibility of cations, such as Li+ and H+, to the TiO2 surface,38 leading to a significant decrease in the values of FF and Voc. The adsorbed dye density follows the same order in all cells, suggesting that dye aggregation alone cannot account for the differences in the device efficiency. The comparatively smaller Eg of STPA-2 may also play an important role due to the smaller required driving force for the reduction of the oxidized dye. In the molecular chains of the MTPA-2 dye, NMP π-linkers are bonded at the C3 and C4 positions in the NMP rings, connecting the donor (TPA) and acceptors (isocyanoacetic acids) across a single bond in this hetero-ring, which cannot conjugate with the adjacent donor (TPA) and acceptors, leading to difficult transport of the excited electrons from the donor (TPA) to acceptors in the MTPA-2 dye. This explains the very small value of Jsc. By substituting Voc, Jsc, and FF values into eqn (4), the overall efficiency of the devices can be calculated; the results are shown in Table 2. As can also be seen in Fig. 7(b), the FF values of the STPA-2- and ETPA-2-based devices are higher than that of the TPAR-2-based device, indicating that the dark current is significantly suppressed upon the introduction of the conjugated St and C2-, C5-EDOT π-linkers into the dye molecules. Thus, the higher FF leads to a higher efficiency in the two devices.

The absorption range of the STPA-2 dye is the highest for the synthesized TPA-based dyes (Fig. 4(a)). The IPCE of the STPA-2-based DSSC was measured to be approximately 20% above 600 nm. This result indirectly suggests the presence of strong interaction between the dye and TiO2. The absorbance of a TiO2 film was calculated from the difference between a dye-adsorbed TiO2 film and a blank, semitransparent TiO2 film. The reflection of TiO2 was minimized, and thus the light-harvesting efficiency could be estimated directly from the absorbance.38 With the assumption that the TiO2 film was uniform and the reflection of incident light was small, the light-harvesting efficiency for the dye on a ∼7 μm TiO2 film was estimated to be 50% at 600 nm, 63% at 500 nm, and 66% at 550 nm. These values are in agreement with the IPCE values measured for the device sensitized with STPA-2 (44% at 600 nm, 52% at 500 nm, and 56% at 520 nm).
3.5. AC impedance analysis
The STPA-2-sensitized DSSC is more efficient than the other TPA-based DSSCs for reasons similar to those for the increase in IPCE. To elucidate the above results, the kinetic parameters of photo-injected electrons with the oxidized dye were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis of the DSSCs. In these cells, the electrons are transported through the mesoscopic TiO2 network and react with I3−. At the same time, I− is oxidized to I3− at the counter electrode. The Nyquist plots of the DSSCs with different dyes are shown in Fig. 8. The TiO2 photoanode thickness was controlled at 7.0 ± 0.2 μm. Three semicircles were observed in the typical Nyquist plots. The smaller semicircle (high frequencies, >1 × 102 Hz) represents the redox charge transfer response at the Pt/electrolyte interface. The larger semicircle (intermediate frequencies, 1–102 Hz) represents the electron transfer impedance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, and the third semicircle (low frequencies, <1 Hz) represents the Nernst diffusion response of the electrolyte.39 Previous studies have employed EIS to investigate the kinetics of charge transfer and recombination in DSSCs.15,16 The diffusion–recombination model is the most popular model for describing the charge transfer properties in DSSCs.15,16 By modeling and fitting the EIS data of DSSCs measured at Voc under illumination, one can obtain several parameters of the electron transport in the photoanode, including the lifetime of an electron in the photoanode (τ), the effective rate constant for recombination (keff), the electron transport resistance in the photoanode (Rw), the charge transfer resistance related to the recombination of an electron at the interface (Rk), and the steady-state electron density (ns). Moreover, the values of τ and the effective diffusion coefficient Deff of an electron in the photoanode of a DSSC can be estimated as ωmax = Keff = 1/τ(5) Deff = (Rk/Rw)(L2/τ)(6)where ωmax and L represent the peak frequency of the arc in the electron transfer impedance plot at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte and the film thickness of the photoanode, respectively. Generally, a longer electron lifetime implies an increased resistance between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, which consequently reduces dark current and improves Voc. Deff is a lumped key criterion that determines the DSSC efficiency.31,40 The Deff value of an electron in a DSSC photoanode is closely related to the efficiency of the DSSC.31,40 A greater Deff generally results in a higher DSSC efficiency. As revealed in Table 2, the STPA-2-based device has a longer electron lifetime (τ) than those of ETPA-2, TPAR-2, and MTPA-2-based devices due to the slower recapture of the conduction band electrons by I3−, in accordance with a higher Voc. Moreover, the larger value of Deff reflects higher efficiency. This outcome is consistent with our previous hypothesis that the introduction of the conjugated π-linkers into the dye molecules decreases the possibility of electron capture by I3−. In comparison to ETPA-2 and other TPA-based dyes, the lower Eg of the STPA-2 dye produces a red shift in the absorption spectra (Fig. 4(a)). This red shift results in the higher IPCE of the STPA-2 dye. Because Jsc reflects the integrated IPCE amplitude, this value should be higher for the STPA-2-based DSSCs. Because the TiO2 film thickness and the loading of these dyes are almost the same, the high Jsc of the STPA-2-based DSSCs shows that the STPA-2 dye has a lower resistance for electron injection into the TiO2 anode than those of ETPA-2, TPAR-2, and MTPA-2 dyes. This diffusion resistance is strongly reflected by the suppression of Jsc in MTPA-2.

4. Conclusion
We systematically synthesized a series of TPA-π-linker dyes featuring St, C2, C5 position-3, 4-ethylenedioxythiophene, and C3, C4 position-N-methylpyrrole as the conjugation segment to link TPA (electron donor), π-linkers, and rhodaniline-3-acetic acids or 2-isocyanoacetic acids (electron acceptors). These dyes were designed with different kinds of π-linkers and different bonding positions in the dye molecular chains and exhibited different photovoltaic performances. The incorporation of St (STPA-2 dye) and C2, C5 position-3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (ETPA-2 dye) on the TPA molecular frame was demonstrated to be beneficial for charge transfer efficiency in the excited state. It is likely that the introduction of an appropriate conjugation of additional dual π-linkers between the electron donor and the electron acceptors into the TPA structure will further improve the performance of DSSCs.
