    , Accepted 8th November 2012First published on 9th November 2012AbstractUniformly distributed Pt nano-particles with excellent adhesion were deposited on conductive substrates by coating the substrate with a Pt complex precursor and its subsequent reduction with a gaseous reducing agent at temperatures as low as 100 °C. This novel two-step method enables excellent control over the particle size and distribution since it is dependent only upon the deposition of the precursor solution, and there is little to no agglomeration or movement of Pt nano-particles during the reduction process. The good adhesion was the result of the reaction at the solid–gas interface, where the solid precursor was chemically converted to metallic Pt. XPS confirmed that 100% of Pt was in the metallic state. The electrochemical catalytic properties of the Pt nano-particles were tested using cyclic voltammetry in an iodide electrolyte. The prepared samples were also used to assemble dye-sensitised solar cells that achieved a light to electricity conversion efficiency of 5.1% under AM 1.5 illumination.
Introduction
Platinum is a highly versatile catalyst that has been applied in many devices including fuel cells and electrochemical solar cells.1–5 Among promising types of solar cells, dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) are fairly cheap to manufacture and have a good cost to power production ratio.6,7 DSSCs use Pt for the reduction of tri-iodide to iodide, thus regenerating the electrolyte and completing the circuit that enables the production of electrical energy. Lately much effort has been put into the deposition of thin Pt layers at low temperatures and the development of flexible dye-sensitised solar cells that would overcome the restrictions imposed by the rigidity of the glass, optically transparent electrode (OTE) used in conventional solar cell designs. One way to obtain flexible DSSCs is to deposit the catalyst8 or even TiO29 on a metal substrate that can withstand high temperatures and have the required flexibility, but it is difficult to prevent corrosion of these substrates by the iodide electrolyte which is an integral part of this type of solar cells.
There are various methods for the application of Pt particles on a number of substrates at low temperatures,2–5,8–11 but most of them require sophisticated and expensive equipment or are too complicated to be of practical use. It is thus important to develop a simple and effective method of depositing Pt nano-particles at low temperatures. One way of achieving this goal is by reduction with various reducing agents in a solution-based process,12–14 but these methods usually result in poor adhesion to the surface, non-uniform layers because of the aggregation of particles in the liquid phase and spotty deposition because of droplet formation of the solution while drying. To overcome these drawbacks, we used a two-step process that uses vapour instead of a solution in the second step, similar to the Ion Layer Gas Reaction (ILGAR) method.15 In this way the quality, distribution and uniformity of the nano-particles depend solely on the deposition of the precursor complex and the completeness of the solid–gas reaction.
Experimental
Synthesis
An ethanolic solution of H2PtCl6 was used as the precursor to obtain metallic nano-structured platinum. An appropriate amount of the precursor was deposited on a transparent glass plate with a conductive coating of fluorine-doped SnO2 (SnO2:F, Solaronix, R□ = 7 Ω−1) or on PET/ITO (polyethylene terephthalate coated with indium tin oxide, Visiontek systems, R□ = 60–90 Ω−1), i.e. an OTE, and left to dry at room temperature. Spin coating and drop coating methods were used to deposit the precursor solution on the substrate. Spin coating typically consisted of dropping 60 μL of 0.02 M H2PtCl6 on a 2.5 × 2.5 cm glass plate and spinning at 2000 ± 200 RPM, while drop coating typically consisted of dropping 25 μL of 0.02 M H2PtCl6 on a 2.5 × 2.5 cm glass plate or PET foil and drying the sample at room temperature. The precursor complex was then exposed to a gaseous reducing agent for 15 minutes. In this case formic acid was used as the reducing agent. Alternatively, some of the samples were prepared by spin coating with an ethanolic solution of the platinum precursor and then heat-treated at 450 °C in air for 30 minutes; this is the standard method of preparation of Pt catalysts.3
Instrumental
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to determine the catalytic properties of platinum nano-particles in an iodide electrolyte. The iodide electrolyte consisted of 0.5 M lithium perchlorate, 50 mM lithium iodide and 10 mM iodine in propylene carbonate (PC).9 The experiment was carried out on an EG&G PAR273 computer-controlled potentiostat–galvanostat consisting of a three-electrode cell. The working electrode was platinum deposited on OTE using the spin coating method with approximately 1.0 cm2 of the platinum covered surface exposed to the electrolyte solution. Platinum electrodes were used as the counter and reference electrodes. CV was performed from +1.0 to −0.6 V with a scanning rate of 5 mV s−1. The environment for all measurements was an air atmosphere in an air-conditioned room at a temperature of 22 ± 2 °C.
Analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS or ESCA) was carried out on a PHI-TFA XPS spectrometer produced by Physical Electronics Inc. The area analysed was 0.4 mm in diameter and the depth analysed was about 1–3 nm. Sample surfaces were excited by X-ray radiation from an Al source with a photon energy of 1486.6 eV. Wide-scan survey spectra were acquired with an analyser pass energy of 187 eV. The narrow-scan spectra of Pt 4f, C 1s, O 1s, Sn 3d, and Cl 2p were obtained with an analyser pass energy of 58 eV, yielding an energy resolution of about 1.0 eV. Quantification of the surface composition was performed from XPS peak intensities taking into account relative sensitivity factors provided by the instrument manufacturer.16
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with a Zeiss ULTRA Plus was used to determine the surface morphology and dispersion of platinum particles on the substrates. The size of the platinum particles was additionally examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Cross-section samples for TEM observation were prepared by ion milling (PIPS, Gatan) at 4 kV and at an incident angle of 10 degrees. Bright-field (BF) imaging was performed on a Jeol JEM-2010F transmission electron microscope.
Electrochemical solar cells were assembled using commercially available materials purchased from Solaronix. The working electrode was prepared by applying TiO2 paste on 0.2 cm2 of the 2.5 × 2.5 cm OTE using the doctor blade technique, heat treated at 450 °C and then submerged in the dye solution (Ruthenizer 535-bis-TBS, Solaronix 20 mg per 50 mL in ethanol). After ten hours, the layer was rinsed and dried at room temperature. The counter electrode was prepared by spin coating an ethanolic solution of H2PtCl6 on a 2.5 × 2.5 cm OTE and then either heat treated at 450 °C or chemically reduced using formic acid vapour at 100 °C. After assembly, the cells were covered by a mask with an area of 0.2 cm2 to prevent incident light from affecting the measurements. The experiment was carried out on Oriel® Sol3A™ Class AAA Solar Simulator.
Results and discussion
Uniformly distributed Pt nano-particles were obtained using a two-step process at temperatures as low as 100 °C. The first step was the deposition of H2PtCl6 on an OTE conductive substrate to obtain a uniform thin layer. An organic solvent with a low surface tension such as ethanol was used to obtain a uniform precursor layer. Spin coating and drop coating methods were used to deposit the precursor solution on the substrate, although dip coating, spray coating or adsorption of the Pt complex on the surface are all valid alternatives. We found that applying a liquid reducing agent directly to the substrate caused the agglomeration of Pt nano-particles, since they redissolved in the reducing agent, and its high surface tension prevented the formation of a uniform layer when drying. To obtain more uniformly distributed metallic Pt nano-particles, the samples were exposed to the vapour of the reducing agent instead. Because the precursor cannot dissolve in the second step, there is no movement of the Pt particles and the quality of the thin layer is therefore dependent solely on the deposition of the precursor solution and the completeness of the solid–gas reaction. To successfully utilise this method the reducing agent has to be in the gaseous form at the required temperature and the vapour needs to be at a high enough concentration for the reaction to take place.
The results show that heating the samples in the presence of formic acid at or above its boiling point (100 °C) resulted in the reduction of the precursor complex and the formation of metallic Pt nano-particles. Temperatures lower than 100 °C produced partial reduction of the precursor Pt complex but allowed the vapour to condense on the substrate surface causing some agglomeration and resulted in less uniform films and poor adhesion of the Pt nano-particles to the substrate.
The completeness of the reduction reaction was proven using XPS to determine the state of the deposited platinum. To confirm the effect of the gaseous reducing agent on the reduction of Pt, one sample was heated to 100 °C for 15 minutes but was not exposed to the vapour of the reducing agent. Comparison of the XPS survey spectra (Fig. 1A) clearly indicated the presence of platinum on the surface of the samples. Comparison of the reduced and partly reduced spectra showed that the signal for chlorine disappeared after reduction. By examining the Pt(4f) region of the reduced and partially reduced sample (Fig. 1B) it could be seen that the low energy band and the high energy band contained in the two doublets from spin orbital splitting of the 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 states shifted from 72.8 eV and 76.0 eV to 71.6 eV and 74.8 eV, respectively, indicating that the prepared platinum was in the metallic state.17,18

Adhesion is the result of the interaction of nano-particles with the surface of the substrate and is related to the surface energy of the particles. Since the surface energy rapidly decreases after particle formation because of the rearrangement of atoms on the surface, adhesion can be improved if the ageing of the particles before their attachment is suppressed.12 This is achieved by not allowing the precursor complex to re-dissolve in the reducing agent. By forming the nano-particles directly on the surface of the substrate at the gas–solid interface, we produced Pt nano-particles with excellent adhesion which could not be removed by wiping or cleaning in an ultrasonic bath.

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of the surface of an OTE covered with Pt nano-particles. Clearly visible are the randomly sited crystals of SnO2 which form the rough morphology of the surface (Fig. 2A). Pt particles cover most of the surface with some agglomeration of Pt particles occurring in the recesses and around the bigger crystals of SnO2; this is the result of using a spin coater for the deposition (Fig. 2C). The SEM images of Pt prepared by heating at 450 °C (Fig. 2D) show that the reduction process at high temperatures gives results similar to reduction with a gaseous reducing agent. The distribution and size of the particles are comparable in the two reduction methods and are dependent mostly upon the deposition of the precursor solution. Drop coating (Fig. 2B), on the other hand, resulted in a much larger amount of deposited Pt. Because of the pooling of the solvent in the precursor solution, agglomeration occurred during the deposition process and the distribution of the particles is not as uniform as with the spin coating method. The size of the particles and their fairly uniform distribution give the deposited Pt a large specific surface area making it ideal as a catalyst.

Pt deposited on PET/ITO (Fig. 3) is less uniform and shows greater agglomeration than that deposited on SnO2:F; this is mostly due to the hydrophobic nature of the conductive layer and the formation of droplets of the precursor solution. Since the agglomerates are composed of smaller particles it nevertheless retains a high enough electrochemical surface area to result in good catalytic activity.

TEM images (Fig. 4) show that the prepared Pt particles are approximately 5 nm in size independent of the deposition method. Clearly visible is the agglomeration of the particles in the recesses using the drop coating method (Fig. 4A), a feature that is absent when using spin coating, where usually only isolated single Pt particles adhered to the SnO2:F surface are observed (Fig. 4B).

To evaluate the catalytic behaviour of the prepared platinum catalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells, cyclic voltammetry in an iodide electrolyte was performed. The two anodic peaks, seen in Fig. 5, correspond to the oxidation of iodide (A1 at ∼0.1 V) and tri-iodide (A2 at ∼0.7 V). The two cathodic peaks correspond to reverse oxidation reactions, C1 at ∼0.4 V to reduction of iodine and C2 at ∼−0.2 V to reduction of triiodide.9 During cycling the position and amplitude of the relevant peak showed only minor shifts and stabilised relatively quickly. Longer cycling (1000 cycles) did not result in further decrease or shifting of the current peaks, indicating that the catalyst is stable and is not significantly degraded by use.

Fig. 6 shows cyclovoltammograms of the prepared Pt catalysts. It can be seen that there is little difference in the catalytic activity between the samples prepared on different conductive substrates. Peak C2 for Pt on ITO is shifted to slightly lower potentials which is probably the result of the higher resistivity of the conductive layer compared to SnO2:F. Samples prepared at 450 °C are comparable to those reduced with formic acid vapour.

The catalytic ability of the deposited Pt nano-particles was also investigated in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSSCs) using them as the counter electrode. In this system Pt nano-particles catalyse the reduction of tri-iodide to iodide which is an important step in converting light to electricity. Fig. 7 shows the I–V curve of cells assembled using Pt prepared by the formic acid vapour method on glass/SnO2:F or PET/ITO, and Pt prepared by thermal treatment at 450 °C on glass/SnO2:F, while Table 1 shows the photovoltaic performance of the DSSCs. It is evident that there is little difference in Isc, Voc and the power conversion efficiency between the cells on glass electrodes prepared by the different methods of reduction. The cell with a flexible plastic counter electrode, on the other hand, has lower Isc and Voc, mostly because of the higher resistivity of the ITO conductive layer, resulting in a lower overall efficiency.

Conclusion
This work presents a two-step method for producing Pt catalysts at low temperatures. The concept of using a gaseous reducing agent to react with a metallic complex provides a novel method of depositing metallic particles at low temperatures.19 Using this method it is possible to deposit catalytic Pt particles on flexible substrates that are not stable at higher temperatures and prepare flexible counter electrodes for DSSCs.
Other reducing agents such as ethylene glycol could likely be used in their gaseous phase to reduce Pt complexes in a similar manner, although the required temperature might differ from that of formic acid, especially considering their lower vapour pressure. Since formic acid is quite corrosive, finding reducing agents that are easier to handle would be beneficial to this process and we are actively searching for alternatives.
