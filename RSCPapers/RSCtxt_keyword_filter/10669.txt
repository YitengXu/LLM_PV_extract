    , Accepted 29th July 2019First published on 29th August 2019AbstractThiophene and its derivatives have been extensively used in organic electronics, particularly in the field of polymer solar cells (PSCs). Significant research efforts have been dedicated to modifying thiophene-based units by attaching electron-donating or withdrawing groups to tune the energy levels of conjugated materials. Herein, we report the design and synthesis of a novel thiophene derivative, FE-T, featuring a monothiophene functionalized with both an electron-withdrawing fluorine atom (F) and an ester group (E). The FE-T unit possesses distinctive advantages of both F and E groups, the synergistic effects of which enable significant downshifting of the energy levels and enhanced aggregation/crystallinity of the resulting organic materials. Shown in this work are a series of polymers obtained by incorporating the FE-T unit into a PM6 polymer to fine-tune the energetics and morphology of this high-performance PSC material. The optimal polymer in the series shows a downshifted HOMO and an improved morphology, leading to a high PCE of 16.4% with a small energy loss (0.53 eV) enabled by the reduced non-radiative energy loss (0.23 eV), which are among the best values reported for non-fullerene PSCs to date. This work shows that the FE-T unit is a promising building block to construct donor polymers for high-performance organic photovoltaic cells.

Broader context
Recently, hundreds of novel small molecule acceptors have emerged with extremely diverse molecular properties since the non-fullerene acceptor surge. Now, polymer solar cells (PSCs) with top-of-the-line power conversion efficiencies (PCEs > 15%) have been reported. To further enhance the performance of PSCs, the field has a strong need for more effective building blocks to tune the molecular properties of the donor polymers to make them more compatible with the rising acceptor molecules and substantially reduce energy loss without sacrificing external quantum efficiency. The thiophene unit has been one of the most important moieties for the design and development of polymers for organic electronics. We overcame the synthetic barrier and successfully synthesised a novel thiophene derivative FE-T, featuring a monothiophene unit functionalized with both an electron-withdrawing fluorine atom and an ester group. The synergistic benefits of them afford unprecedented opportunities for the judicious optimization of the frontier orbital level, the aggression/crystallization of the polymers and the blend morphology. One example in this work is the FE-T-based donor polymer S1, which yields a remarkable PCE of 16.4% with a small energy loss (0.53 eV) when applied in non-fullerene PSCs. This is among the best results for single-junction PSCs reported to date.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have emerged as a promising photovoltaic technology due to their ease of fabrication, flexibility and potential for cost-effective large-scale production.1,2 In the past few years, considerable developments have been achieved in non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs).3–5 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of NF-PSCs have surpassed 15%,6–12 which is far beyond the state-of-the-art fullerene-based PSCs.13 Recent research has demonstrated that these high-performance NF-SMAs have extended absorption profiles with edges in the near-infrared region contributed by the intramolecular electron “push–pull” effects and easily tunable end-capping units.14–17 The extended absorption is beneficial for broadening the photon-harvesting range of the active layer and thus increasing the short-circuit current density (JSC). To further increase the performance of NF-PSCs, it is also important to increase the open-circuit voltages (VOC) and reduce the energy loss (Eloss) of devices. To achieve this goal, it is often necessary to modify the building blocks and chemical structures of donor and acceptor materials for optimizing the energy levels of conjugated materials. One of the strategies of tuning energy levels is attaching electron withdrawing or donating groups onto thiophene units. For instance, to accommodate the relatively low-lying LUMO levels of many state-of-the-art NF-SMAs,18–20 functionalizing the thiophene units can be employed to tune the properties of donor polymers toward a wide band gap (WBG) and in the meantime a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level,21–23 which could promote the VOC while keeping the JSC high. Due to the electron-donating nature of the thiophene unit, which could lead to relatively high HOMO levels for the resulting polymers,24,25 introducing a suitable electron-withdrawing substituent onto the β-position of thiophene is considered a more effective strategy compared to the incorporation of a strong electron-deficient conjugated building block in order to downshift the HOMO level while keeping the WBG.
Among various electron-withdrawing groups, the fluorine atom (F) is one of the most feasible choices for lowering the energy levels without introducing undesirable steric hindrance.26 In recent work, the success of the fluoro-substituted thiophene (FT) group on both the main and the side chain of polymers has been manifested by the high-performance of their non-fullerene PSCs (Fig. 1).27–32 Besides fluorine, another functional group that deserves attention is the ester group (E). In addition to introducing E on the quinoidal moiety, such as thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene,33 several polymers with ester-substituted thiophene (ET) groups on the main chains show large bandgaps and low-lying HOMO levels,34,35e.g., ester-modified polythiophene (i.e., PDCBT36) (Fig. 1). Also, the ET and FT groups trigger intra and interchain noncovalent interactions, increasing the backbone planarity and interchain charge transport. In particular, such noncovalent interactions facilitate the formation of a favorable polymer:SMA blend morphology, leading to significantly improved PCEs.37–39 To gain the synergistic effect of fluoro and ester functional groups, they have been introduced simultaneously into the main chain and side chains of polymers recently (Fig. 1).29 However, the increased thiophene content in the polymer showed negative effects on the optimization of the HOMO levels. Meanwhile, the increased thiophene content could cause an excessively strong propensity for the polymer to crystallize/aggregate and thus insufficient miscibility between the polymer and NF-SMAs.40
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of representative high-performance polymer donors containing ET and FT units for NF-PSCs and the polymer donor S1 used in this work. 
In the work, we design and synthesize a novel building block based on a monothiophene unit with both F and E substitutions. The synergetic effects of two electron-withdrawing groups (F and E) should offer further downshifted energy levels for the resulting materials. Importantly, the new FE-T unit cannot be synthesized using the conventional approaches used for FT or ET units. Here, we overcome the synthetic challenges and obtain the FE-T unit with high overall yields (80%) with six steps (Scheme 1). FE-T features two functional groups, E and T, on the β-positions of the monothiophene, which is expected to yield a weaker donor unit than FT and ET. Then we introduce the FE-T unit into the state-of-the-art donor polymer PM6 via a random polymerization strategy and synthesize several donor polymers with different ratios of FE-T units. Our device characterization shows that the polymer (named S1) incorporating 20% of FE-T units exhibits the best PSC performance. Compared to the PM6 polymer without FE-T, S1 exhibits a deeper HOMO level, a higher VOC and thus a higher efficiency than the devices made using PM6. More importantly, the S1-based device delivers a very low non-radiative energy loss (0.23 eV). As a result, the efficiency (16.4%) and Eloss (0.53 eV) achieved by the S1:Y6-devices are among the best values reported of NF-PSCs to date. To understand the structure–property relationship, we also synthesize an analog polymer with the ET unit. Our results show that polymer containing the FE-T unit possesses a more optimized structure and thus shows better performance. This superb device performance, along with the investigation into the structure–performance relationship of the series of polymers presented in this work, demonstrates the success of our design rule and manifests that employing the FE-T unit in copolymerization is a promising strategy for further development of PSCs.

Results and discussion
Although previous research efforts have demonstrated the synthesis of FT and ET units, the dibrominated monothiophene monomer with both fluorine and ester substitution has not been reported due to synthetic challenges. In this work, we overcame this synthetic challenge by taking advantage of reaction selectivity of the α and β-position of the thiophene. First, the FT compound 2 was synthesized using commercial 3,4-dibromothiophene based on an improved Heeney's protocol.41 We found that excess tert-butyllithium (t-BuLi) promotes the yield and purity. Without the time-consuming normal/reverse-phase chromatography or the costly preparative GPC reported by Heeney's and our groups,42,43 compound 2 was subsequently treated with excess t-BuLi at low temperature, followed by quenching with CO2 to afford compound 3. It is worth noting that excess t-BuLi increases the yield from 50% to 95% for compound 2. Compound 4 can be facilely deprotected and thus brominated to yield the dibrominated monomer FE-T. This route produces the FE-T monomer in a high overall yield of 80%. To utilize the new FE-T unit in a donor polymer, we incorporate the FE-T into a state-of-the-art polymer – PM6. A recent report has shown that the combination of PM6 and Y6 can achieve a high efficiency of 15.7% for non-fullerene PSCs.10,44 To further improve the performance of PM6–Y6 devices, we intend to modify the structure of PM6 to deepen its HOMO level, hence further increasing the efficiency of the device.
We synthesized a series of copolymers named S1, S2, S3, and S4 that have distinct FE-T:BDD ratios. For comparison purposes, we also prepared the non-fluorinated counterpart named ES1 as a control (see the ESI†). All the polymers were prepared via a Stille coupling reaction following the synthesis route provided in Scheme 1, and detailed synthetic procedures and characterization can be found in the ESI.† The structures of the monomer FE-T and polymers were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis (Fig. S14–S21, ESI†). Molecular weights for the series of polymers were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The number-average molecular weights (Mn) of the polymers are above 30 kDa, and the polydispersity indexes (PDIs) are around 2.0 (Table S1, ESI†). Besides, decent thermal stability with decomposition temperatures (Td) above 350 °C was observed in the thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S1, ESI†) for the polymers.
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were carried out to investigate the optimal geometries and frontier molecular orbitals of the polymers. As shown in Fig. 2a and b and Fig. S2b in the ESI,† introducing an ET unit leads to enhanced dihedral angles of 27.35° and 8.18° in the conjugated backbone, caused by the steric hindrance effect of the ester group, which is consistent with previous reports,8 and affects the intermolecular packing in the films. In the organic electron field, the fluorine atom features a small atomic size and a high electronegativity, which allows it to effectively reduce the energy level without introducing steric hindrance when incorporated into the polymer. In addition, it can trigger noncovalent interactions, leading to a self-planarized backbone.45 Hence, with the F atom on the FE-T unit, S1 exhibits decreased dihedral angles (25.32° and 0.8°) and a polymer backbone with a conformational lock (benefiting from the S–O and S–F noncovalent interactions enabled by the FE-T unit), contributing to more extended π-electron delocalization and a lower-lying HOMO level compared to PM6 and ES1 (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) method was employed to investigate the HOMO levels of the materials (Fig. S3, ESI†), and the corresponding energy level diagrams are shown in Fig. 2c. The HOMO energy level of S1 (−5.52 eV) is slightly lower than that of ES1 and PM6. It can be observed that introducing ET units yields up-shifted LUMO levels and down-shifted HOMO levels, resulting in enlarged bandgaps. We also performed ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) experiments to gain deeper insights into the HOMO levels46 and compared the UPS results with the CV. S1 has a higher ionization potential (IP) of 5.54 eV compared to PM6 (5.48 eV), which is also in parallel with the theoretical calculations (Fig. S4, ESI†). These results indicate that S1 will yield a smaller HOMO–HOMO offset with the small molecule acceptor Y6, which contributes to the high VOC and small Eloss.

We measured temperature-dependent absorption spectra to investigate the aggregation behaviors of the polymers in chlorobenzene. With increased temperature, a significant blue-shift of the absorption is observed, implying that the polymers have a strong aggregation effect in the solution (Fig. 2f and Fig. S5, ESI†). Such a strong temperature-dependent aggregation property of the donor polymers was also conducive to constructing efficient organic photovoltaic devices.40,47,48 From solutions to films, the polymers have some red-shifts in the absorption spectra (Fig. 2d and e). In addition, the blend films cover a broad spectral range from 300 to 900 nm (Fig. S5h, ESI†) and the introduction of FE-T also leads to enhanced absorption coefficients in both neat and blend films (Fig. S6, ESI†), which is a desirable feature for enhanced light harvesting and thus an increase of photocurrent generation in OSCs. These favorable optical properties serve as the base for a high photocurrent.
To investigate the photovoltaic performance of the series of polymers, we fabricated PSCs in a conventional device structure: ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)(PEDOT:PSS)/active layer/Zracac/Al. Notably, the interlayer of Zracac (1–2 mg mL−1, in ethanol) was generally deposited on the active layer via spin-coating at 2000–4000 rpm for 30 s. In our case, Zracac was prepared in ethanol at a concentration of 1.4 mg mL−1, and was spin-coated at a rate of 3000 rpm for 30 s. Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices based on all the polymers, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 1 and Tables S7–S9 (ESI†). The PM6:Y6-based cell yields a PCE of 15.41%, with a VOC of 0.84 V, a JSC of 25.01 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73, which are comparable to previous results (15.7%). In contrast, the S4:Y6-based device shows a low PCE of 5.76%, with a drastically reduced JSC (12.78 mA cm−2) but an enhanced VOC (0.93 V). In order to further optimize VOC, we prepared FE-T-based devices with different FE-T contents. It is apparent that the VOCs from the S1 to S4-based cells increase with the increased content of FE-T. The champion cell was achieved at a weight ratio of FE-T:BDD = 2:8 and the device exhibits a remarkable PCE of 16.42%, with a VOC of 0.877 V, a JSC of 25.4 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.74, which is also significantly higher than the ES1-based device (15.37%). To the best of our knowledge, the 16.42% PCE is the top value reported so far for single-junction organic solar cells.6,7,10,11,49–52 Notably, Eloss, defined as Eloss = Eg − qVOC (where Eg (a.k.a. EPVg) is extracted from the derivatives of the EQE curve),53 is only 0.53 eV in the device based on S1:Y6, which is significantly smaller than most reported Elosss. These results demonstrate that the FE-T unit considerably increases the JSC and FF while allowing the device to reach a high VOCvia a low Eloss, fulfilling the goal of our design rationale.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all cells are shown in Fig. 3b. The integrated JSCs from the EQE spectra are shown in Table 1, which match well with the values from the J–V curves within 4% error. The S1:Y6 device was found to have the highest photoresponse with a maximum EQE of over 80% in the spectral range of 300–900 nm due to the highly complementary absorption between the polymer donor and Y6. The increased JSC and FF of the S1-based device are also attributed to the higher and more balanced charge carrier mobilities: the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) hole (μh,SCLC) and electron (μe,SCLC) mobilities were found to be 7.01 × 10−4 and 4.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (μh,SCLC/μe,SCLC = 1.67), respectively, for the S1:Y6 blend. Both the hole and electron mobilities of S1:Y6 are significantly higher than those of the other blends, and S1:Y6 possesses the lowest ratio of μh,SCLC/μe,SCLC (Fig. S9 and Table S5, ESI†), which are beneficial for reducing the space charge accumulation and recombination, and thus for enhancing JSC.
To understand the effect of FE-T on the active layer packing structure, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) experiments were carried out (Fig. 4 and Fig. S7, ESI†). As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the PM6, S1, S4, and ES1 neat films demonstrate a preferential face-on orientation, which is beneficial for charge transport in the vertical direction (Table S4, ESI†). In addition, compared with ES1 (0.28 Å−1), the (100) scattering peaks of the S1 neat films were increased to 0.29 Å−1 in the in-plane direction, corresponding to d-spacing values of 21.65 Å. S1 exhibits the largest crystal coherence length (CCL) (S1 = 22.60 nm) for the π–π stacking (010) peak (a d-spacing of 3.50 Å) in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction (Table S2, ESI†). Apparently, the trend in the neat samples is basically retained in the blend films of the polymers with Y6. As depicted in Fig. 4, the S1:Y6 blend shows the strongest (010) scattering peak in the OOP direction, indicating an enhanced face-on orientation after loading the optimal content of FE-T units. In addition, as shown in Table S3 (ESI†), the S1:Y6 blend exhibits the largest π–π stacking CCL (25.69 nm) among all blend films, indicating that the FE-T unit can improve the π–π stacking. The trend of the (010) CCL is consistent with that of the charge carrier mobilities measured for these blends (see Table S5, ESI†). Importantly, the FE-T unit triggers noncovalent S⋯O and S⋯F interactions that promote polymer packing in a face-on orientation, which contributes to the JSC enhancement. Similar situations were observed in other systems such as polymer:fullerene,54 polymer:A–D–A type non-fullerene small molecule acceptors,55,56 and our previous work.38 These results clearly demonstrate that the incorporation of FE-T in the copolymer not only can change the energy levels but also can tune the packing structure.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) experiments were carried out to further investigate the morphology and phase separation (Fig. 5). As shown in the AFM images, the PM6:Y6 blend films exhibit uniform and smooth surface morphologies with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 0.89 nm. After introducing E-T into the polymer chain, a slightly reduced RMS roughness was observed in the ES1:Y6 blend due to the irregular terpolymer backbone. In contrast, the RMS roughness gradually increases with the incorporation of FE-T. Meanwhile, similar to the trend in the AFM images, the domain size observed in the TEM images of these blends exhibits an increase with the FE-T ratio. Except for the S4-based blend film, well-developed nanoscale interpenetrating networks are formed in all blends. Such suitable nano-fibrillar structures in the blends suggest a near-ideal phase separation that balances exciton dissociation and charge transport, which will in turn contribute to the high JSC. Indeed, in terms of the control device based on PM6:Y6 with a high efficiency of 15.4%, it is difficult to significantly improve the device performance via morphology optimization as the morphology of PM6:Y6 is decent and the two parameters (VOC and JSC) are already high. Despite this, the introduction of FE-T into PM6 results in a more optimized crystallization/aggregation behavior and miscibility between the donor and acceptor without sacrificing the charge carrier mobility.

To investigate charge-recombination in the PSCs, we studied the relationship between JSC and the light intensity (P) (Fig. 3c), which can be described by the powerlaw formula JSC ∝ Pαlight. Generally, the exponent α being close to 1 indicates weak bimolecular recombination in the device. The α values are 0.966 and 0.874 for the PM6 and S4-based devices, respectively. In contrast, the optimized S1 device exhibits a greater α (0.978) than ES1 (0.932), indicating that FE-T loading suppresses bimolecular recombination, which contributes to the high JSC. Furthermore, we investigated exciton dissociation in the active layers. The photocurrent density (Jph) is plotted as a function of the effective voltage (Veff) for all optimized devices (Fig. 3d).
The saturation Jph (Jsat), exciton dissociation efficiency (ηdiss) and charge collection efficiency (ηcoll) can be estimated from the Jph–Veff curves. The results are shown in Table S6 (ESI†), where the ηdiss values are 95.2%, 95.8%, 69.6% and 90.3% for the PM6, S1, S4, and ES1-based devices respectively. ηcoll exhibits a parallel trend to ηdiss, which indicates an efficient hole transfer process from the acceptor to the polymer donors despite the small ΔHOMO, thus enhancing JSC.
Finally, to gain further insight into the reasons for the increase of the VOC in our NF-OSCs, we perform more device physics studies. As reducing Eloss is a promising route to achieve a high VOC without sacrificing JSC, we carried out Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) experiments and measured EQEEL to analyze the Eloss in detail for both S1- and PM6-based devices (Table 2). According to previous work35,57,58 the total Eloss (ΔE) can be divided into three parts:ΔE = Eg − qVOC = (Eg − qVSQOC) + (qVSQOC − qVradOC) + (qVradOC − qVOC) = (Eg − qVSQOC) + qΔVrad,belowgapOC + qΔVnon-radOC = ΔE1 + ΔE2 + ΔE3

The first part, ΔE1, comes from radiative recombination loss above the bandgap, which is unavoidable based on the Shockley–Queisser (SQ) theory. The value for ΔE1 typically ranges from 0.25–0.30 eV. In our case, S1- and PM6-based devices show similar ΔE1 (0.26 eV). The second part, ΔE2, originates from radiative recombination loss below the bandgap. For inorganic and perovskite solar cells, ΔE2 is negligible due to their steep absorption edges. In contrast, ΔE2 is usually larger for fullerene-based organic solar cells. This situation has changed recently with the rapid development of NF-OSCs. A reduction in ΔE2 can be achieved by decreasing the energy offset in either the LUMO or the HOMO levels between the donor and the acceptor.59,60 The third part, ΔE3, is the non-radiative recombination loss, which can also be efficiently reduced in certain non-fullerene systems that show high EL quantum efficiencies.
In order to accurately evaluate Eloss, we extract the optical bandgaps (EPVgs) from the derivatives of the EQE curve,53 where the EPVgs of PM6:Y6 and S1:Y6 are calculated to be 1.42 and 1.41 eV, respectively. We then carried out Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy external quantum efficiency (FTPS-EQE) experiments to determine ΔE2. As depicted in Fig. 6a and Fig. S13a (ESI†), the FTPS-EQE onsets of the PM6:Y6 and S1:Y6 blend films are both nearly identical to that of the neat Y6 device. In addition, we measured the electroluminescence (EL) (Fig. S13b, ESI†) of the two blend films, the spectra of which are also in line with the Y6-based neat film. Based on these results, no distinct and red-shifted charge-transfer (CT) absorption and emission can be found in both cells. This observation has been made in other recently reported high-performance NF-OSCs with low-energy offsets between the donor and acceptor, which contributes to reducing ΔE2.35,57,58 The two cells in our study both show negligible ΔE2 (0.06 eV for PM6:Y6 and 0.05 eV for S1:Y6) (Table 2), which are among the smallest values in OSCs.

By measuring the EQEEL of the cells, ΔE3 can be calculated via the following equation: ΔE3 = −kTln(EQEEL). Both devices exhibit high EQEEL values with magnitudes over 10−5, which are the top values among NF-OSCs. Particularly, the S1:Y6-based cell shows a higher EQEEL of 1.5 × 10−4 than the PM6:Y6 device (4.3 × 10−5) and the calculated ΔE3 is 0.23 for the S1:Y6-based cell, which is lower than that for PM6:Y6 by 30 meV (Fig. 6b). From Table 2 below, the reduced non-radiative recombination loss is the main contribution to the low Eloss in the S1:Y6-based cell (Fig. 6c).
Conclusion
In summary, we have developed a novel weak electron donor unit, FE-T, featuring a monothiophene functionalized with both an electron-withdrawing F atom and an ester group. The synthetic barriers of grafting two distinct electron-withdrawing groups onto the β-position of monothiophene were successfully overcome, which allows us to enlarge the family of thiophene-based weak electron donor units, a widely used building block in constructing wide band gap conjugated polymers. Through copolymerization, the first example of an FE-T-based terpolymer, S1, has been successfully designed and synthesized. Compared to its parent polymer (PM6) and analog (ES1) without F, the incorporation of FE-T not only optimized the energy levels but enabled a favorable balance between crystallinity and miscibility in the active layer. As a result, with Y6 as the acceptor, an impressive PCE of 16.42% was achieved for single-junction OSCs. Notably, a high VOC of 0.88 eV is achieved at a bandgap of 1.41 eV, and the corresponding Eloss is only 0.53 eV. The EQEEL measurements demonstrate that the cell based on S1 exhibits a high EQEEL of 1.5 × 10−4, which indicates that a low nonradiative recombination loss of 0.23 eV is obtained, contributing to the increase in VOC. Through the structure–property–performance relationship studied in this work, we demonstrate that FE-T is a very effective building block for designing organic semiconductors as it is feasible to adjust the molecular geometry and tune the optoelectronic properties. It is foreseeable that FE-T-based new materials will be demonstrated in the short term, leading to further growth of the PCE in the field of organic solar cells and potentially performance enhancement in other organic electronics. Further insight into the observation of high EQE along with very low Eloss in this system will be investigated in our future work.

Broader context
Recently, hundreds of novel small molecule acceptors have emerged with extremely diverse molecular properties since the non-fullerene acceptor surge. Now, polymer solar cells (PSCs) with top-of-the-line power conversion efficiencies (PCEs > 15%) have been reported. To further enhance the performance of PSCs, the field has a strong need for more effective building blocks to tune the molecular properties of the donor polymers to make them more compatible with the rising acceptor molecules and substantially reduce energy loss without sacrificing external quantum efficiency. The thiophene unit has been one of the most important moieties for the design and development of polymers for organic electronics. We overcame the synthetic barrier and successfully synthesised a novel thiophene derivative FE-T, featuring a monothiophene unit functionalized with both an electron-withdrawing fluorine atom and an ester group. The synergistic benefits of them afford unprecedented opportunities for the judicious optimization of the frontier orbital level, the aggression/crystallization of the polymers and the blend morphology. One example in this work is the FE-T-based donor polymer S1, which yields a remarkable PCE of 16.4% with a small energy loss (0.53 eV) when applied in non-fullerene PSCs. This is among the best results for single-junction PSCs reported to date.
