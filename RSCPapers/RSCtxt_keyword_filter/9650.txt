    , Accepted 27th January 2021First published on 17th February 2021AbstractDeveloping dopant-free hole-transporting materials (HTMs) is very important for improving the stability and increasing the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, nine boron–nitrogen substituted tetrathienonaphthalene (BN-TTN) derivatives as hole-transporting materials (HTMs) were investigated using theoretical calculations combined with the Marcus theory and the Einstein relation. The results showed that the introduction of a boron–nitrogen group in tetrathienonaphthalene leads to a deep HOMO level, good thermal stability, and enhanced hydrophobicity. Importantly, most BN-TTN molecules possess larger hole mobility due to a broader distribution of the frontier molecular orbitals of the dimer. The BN-TTN core that matches with the size of the perovskite interface also increases the interfacial interaction and hole transfer from the perovskite layer to the HTM layer. The present findings can highlight the potential of BN-TTN core-based HTMs for efficient PSCs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic halide perovskites have recently attracted considerable attention as light-absorbing materials because of their outstanding photoelectric properties, such as the direct bandgap, excellent carrier mobility, long carrier lifetime, high light absorption, and low-temperature solution-fabrication process.1–5 Recently, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have exceeded 25%.6,7 Hole transport materials (HTMs) play an important role in extracting and transferring holes, suppressing undesired charge recombination losses, and enhancing their stability in PSCs.8,9 To date, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis (N,N′-di-para-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) is still the most common organic small molecule HTM. However, Spiro-OMeTAD suffers from expensive synthesis cost and poor hole mobility, limiting its practical applications.10,11 Moreover, Spiro-OMeTAD strongly relies on additives and dopants (such as LiTFSI and TBP) to improve its hole mobility.12 Unfortunately, the use of these dopants leads to sophisticated oxidation procedures and undesirable ion migration and interactions, which accelerate cell degradation and significantly decrease the stability of PSCs.13 The development of efficient alternatives represents a challenge for the coming years.14
In recent years, a lot of organic small molecules without dopants have been developed to replace Spiro-OMeTAD.15 Chen and Jen groups presented a new structural Trux-OMeTAD with a planar, rigid, and fully conjugated molecule as a dopant-free HTM, which exhibits excellent hole mobility and desirable surface energy to the perovskite layer.16 Sun et al. reported a fluoranthene core-based donor (D)–acceptor (A) type dopant-free HTM, which presents highly ordered and strong molecular packing in the solid state, leading to much higher hole extraction and transport.17 Tu et al. developed a series of potential D–A small organic molecules (BTTI) as HTMs, and showed that shortening the side chain of BTTI shows remarkably improved performance, and compared to those made with the routine doped Spiro-OMeTAD, the devices based on dopant-free BTTI-HTMs significantly enhanced the operational stability.18 These results showed the great advantages of HTMs with a planar core in increasing the performances of PSCs. In addition to the experimental studies, density functional theory calculations have been adopted to develop a new HTM with a planar core. For example, we have designed a planar organic molecule called ATT-2, and its energy levels, hole mobility, and optical properties were calculated using computational chemistry. Importantly, it has been synthesized by the Nazeeruddin group recently.19 ATT-2 was tested in PSCs and their PCE was found to increase to 18.1% under 1 sun irradiation. Besides, the energy levels and spectral properties predicted by us were consistent with the corresponding experimental data.20 This work encouraged us to further design new HTMs and calculate their performances by computational chemistry. In recent years, azaboron chemistry has been continuously developing as an important branch of organic semiconductor materials.21 Nakamura et al. developed a BN-fused polycyclic aromatic compound and its hole mobility(0.07 cm2 v−1 s−1) is one order of magnitude higher than that of its carbon analog dibenzo[g,p]chrysene (0.007 cm2 v−1 s−1).22 The higher hole mobility is mainly derived from the tight stacking array and strong intermolecular electronic coupling in the solid state. Besides, Pei's group also synthesized a series of BN-substituted tetrathienonaphthalene (TTN) derivatives (BN-TTN), and demonstrated that the BN group plays a key role in reducing the molecular HOMO level and reorganization energies.23,24
In this work, we report the electronic structures, thermostability, and hole transport behaviors of BN-TTN-based HTMs. We showed that all molecules possess deep HOMO levels and good stability. Interestingly, the boron–nitrogen group not only increases the molecular hole mobility but also enhances the hole transfer at the interface between perovskite and the HTMs.
Results and discussion
Geometric and electronic configurations
These new HTMs were built via planar BN-TTN groups as the cores and triphenylamine moieties as the ending groups (Fig. 1). We expected BN-TTN to increase the hole transport and triphenylamine to maintain the superior hydrophobicity of HTMs.
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of B–N substituted HTMs. 
To get a deeper insight into the electronic properties, the frontier molecular orbitals of all molecules were elucidated. As shown in Fig. 2, both the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) present π orbital features. The HOMOs of BN-TTN-B1, BN-TTN-N1, BN-TTN-BN2, BN-TTN-B3, and BN-TTN-N3 are mainly localized at triphenylamine groups, and those of BN-TTN-B2, BN-TTN-N2, BN-TTN-BN1 (BN-TTN-BN1 has two degenerate orbitals owing to their similar energies), and BN-TTN-4 are delocalized over the whole molecules. While the LUMOs of most molecules are only distributed over the BN-TTN cores, the wide distribution of HOMOs may lead to a deep HOMO level because the excellent conjugate will reduce the orbital level.
 Fig. 2  Energy level diagram of perovskite, Spiro-OMeTAD, and the studied molecules. The HOMO values of Spiro-OMeTAD and the studied molecules are computed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level and the calculations for the LUMO energy of all molecules were obtained from the expression, LUMO = HOMO + Eg. The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of perovskites are taken from ref. 28 and 29. 
Next, we calculated the HOMO energy levels of all HTMs. The HOMO energy level is a crucial consideration since it can not only reflect the hole-injection capacity but also influence the open-circuit voltage (VOC) of the devices in PSCs.25 The HOMO energy levels were calculated approximately ranging from −5.43 to −5.18 eV (Fig. 2), which are deeper than that of the classical HTM Spiro-OMeTAD (−5.14 eV) and well match with the valence band (VB) of CH3NH3PbI3 (−5.43 eV), indicating that all the compounds may be in favor of increasing the VOC and benefit the hole injection.26 Meanwhile, we found that as the number of triphenylamine increases, the HOMO values present an increasing trend, which means that the BN-based core can effectively reduce the HOMO energy level of molecules. Besides, the estimated LUMO energy levels of all molecules were obtained from the expression, LUMO = HOMO + Eg, where the Eg stands for the bandgap and approximately equals the first excitation energy from HOMO to LUMO transitions.25,27 Higher LUMO levels, compared to the conduction band of CH3NH3PbI3 (CB, −3.93 eV), should effectively block the electron backflow perovskite to the anode and suppress interfacial charge recombination. We showed that all molecules possess higher LUMO energy levels than the CB of CH3NH3PbI3. On the whole, the HOMO and LUMO levels of BN-TTN-based HTMs matched well with the VB and CB values of perovskites, respectively, which can efficiently extract holes from the perovskite layer to the metal back contact and block the electron transfer to a metal back contact. Besides, in order to further verify the role of the BN group, we also calculated and compared the electronic properties of the two cores (BN-TTN and CC-TTN, see Fig. S1†). The calculation results showed that BN-TTN possesses a lower HOMO level compared with CC-TTN, which means that BN-TTN is indeed a potential core unit for constructing high-performance HTMs.
Optical properties
HTMs can be regarded as “sandwich” structures between the anode and the perovskite layer. Previous reports have shown that the optical transmission of HTMs has a critical effect on the light capture capability and current density of PSCs.30,31 A potential HTM should show no absorption or weak absorption in the light absorption range of perovskite to avoid competition with the absorption of perovskite. We showed that the maximum absorption peaks of all molecules are located in the UV-visible region from 300 nm to 500 nm (Fig. 3a and Table S1†), which indicated that these molecules have excellent transmission properties in the absorption band of perovskites (500 nm–800 nm).32 Besides, combining the absorption and emission properties, the Stokes shift is also calculated and are shown in Fig. 3b and Table S1.† The larger Stokes shift indicates a deeper structural deformation between the ground state and excited state geometries and facilitates the pore-filling of HTMs.33 As shown, the Stokes shift values of all molecules are greater than 90 nm, which are larger than that of Spiro-OMeTAD (64.0 nm). The results demonstrate that these molecules would be beneficial to improve the conversion efficiency with their flexible structure.

Chemical stability properties
The stability of HTMs plays an important role in increasing the stability of PSCs because the HTM acts as an anti-abrasion layer on the perovskite layer in PSCs, which can protect the perovskite from external damage.34 The stability of the HTMs can be defined in the terms of resistance against the change in the number of electrons.35 This parameter has a direct relationship with the absolute hardness (η) defined as η = (IPa − EAa)/2, where IPa and EAa are the ionization potential and the adiabatic electron affinity, respectively.36 The larger the η value, the better the stability. We showed that all molecules have similar hardness values (Fig. 4 and Table S3†) with Spiro-OMeTAD (the green dotted line in Fig. 4), indicating that these molecules have good self-stability to resist the destruction of the external environment.
 Fig. 4  (a) The absolute hardness (η), (b) hydrophobic property (LogP) and (c) solvation free energy (ΔGsolv, kcal mol−1) were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level, among them, the dotted line represents the value of Spiro-OMeTAD. 
Besides, the high hydrophobicity of HTMs is another crucial property to prevent perovskite from being exposed to air, especially the moisture in the air.37,38 The hydrophobicity can be evaluated by logPoctanol/water, which was calculated using the following formula:39  
We showed that the value of logPoctanol/water gradually enhances as the number of triphenylamine groups increases (Fig. 4 and Table S3†). All molecules have comparable hydrophobicity and three molecules (BN-TTN-B3, BN-TTN-N3, and BN-TTN-4) show significantly higher logPoctanol/water compared to Spiro-OMeTAD (the rosy dotted line in Fig. 4). In addition, the molecular partition coefficients in dichloromethane (logPdichloromethane/water) were also considered (Table S2 and Fig. S2†). The results indicated that the hydrophobicity in dichloromethane showed the same trend as that in octanol. These results demonstrate that introducing more triphenylamine groups is beneficial to improve the hydrophobicity.
In addition to the hydrophobic properties, the solubility also should be considered because a large solubility of HTMs in organic solvents can promote the formation of uniform thin films, and further facilitate charge transport at the perovskite/HTM interface.29 The solubility is determined by the solvation Gibbs free energy (ΔGsolv, ΔGsolv = Gsol − Ggas).40 The Gsol and Ggas denote the Gibbs free energy in the solvent (dichloromethane) and vacuum, respectively. A negative ΔGsolv value indicates excellent solubility properties. Our results showed that all molecules can dissolve spontaneously due to the negative ΔGsolv value. Besides, on the whole, the ΔGsolv value reduced with an increase in the number of triphenylamine groups, and the molecules are easier to dissolve in dichloromethane. This finding indicates that the triphenylamine group could play an important role in increasing the molecular solubility.
Hole transport-related properties
It is well established that the PCE of PSCs strongly depends on the carrier mobility of HTMs.41 The favorable hole transport properties of HTMs contribute to the enhancement of the short-circuit current density and fill factor of PSCs.42 The semiclassical Marcus theory and the Einstein relation have been widely used to estimate the hole transfer rate.43–45 The related key parameters, including the hole transfer integral (ν), hole reorganization energy (λ), centroid distance (d), hole hopping rate (k), and hole mobility (u), are listed in Table 1.

The hole transfer integral (ν) presents the HOMO coupling of the nearest neighboring molecules, which is a vital parameter to determine the hole mobility.29 In general, a larger hole transfer integral leads to fast hole mobility. It strongly depends on the configuration of the dimer. In this work, only the hole mobility between the two molecules in the most stable dimer was considered since it can provide the largest transfer integral in all hole transfer pathways. To get a reliable 2D face-to-face stacking model, we adopted a combination of dynamic simulation and quantitative calculation for optimization. The calculation details were described in the ESI† and the optimized dimers are shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† All the dimers showed good π–π stacking, and the intermolecular distances were 3.5–4.5 Å. This good stacking may be due to the dipole–dipole interactions and intermolecular S⋯S contacts of adjacent molecules. Besides, we showed that the calculated v values show a significant difference between isomers. The difference is mainly derived from the distributions of HOMO and HOMO−1 (Fig. 5 and Fig. S4–S6†). Taking BN-TTN-B3 and BN-TTN-N3 as examples, the HOMO and HOMO−1 of BN-TTN-B3 are delocalized along the whole dimers, while those of BN-TTN-N3 are distributed on two single molecules (see Fig. 5). As a result, the wide distributions of the HOMO and HOMO−1 in BN-TTN-B3 lead to strong HOMO–HOMO overlap and larger ν. Similarly, the v values of other isomers (BN-TTN-B1 and BN-TTN-N1; BN-TTN-B2 and BN-TTN-N2; BN-TTN-BN1 and BN-TTN-BN2) exhibited a consistent result. In other words, the more widespread the distribution of the HOMO and HOMO−1 in the dimers is, the larger the hole transfer integral is.

Hole reorganization energy (λ) is another vital parameter that affects the hole transfer rate, which is closely related to the change in molecular geometries from the neutral state to the cation state.46 A distinct structural change would lead to a larger λ value. For example, the λ value of BN-TTN-4 is highest in all molecules, which is mainly caused by the biggest change of the dihedral angles in the BN-TTN core and triphenylamines from a neutral state to the cation state (see Fig. 3c and Table S3†). Besides, other molecules exhibit similar λ values (0.187–0.213 eV).
Based on the calculated transfer integrals and reorganization energies, the hole transfer rate constants and hole mobility were obtained (Table 1). We demonstrated that almost all molecules have higher hole mobility than Spiro-OMeTAD (5.65 × 10−3 cm2 v−1 s−1 obtained in the same way.). The result can be attributed to the fact that the planar BN-TTN core leads to small structural distortion and tight stacking.23 Furthermore, it deserves to be mentioned that BN-TTN-B3 exhibits the highest hole mobility (1.94 cm2 v−1 s−1) in all molecules, which is of a larger three order of magnitude than the value of Spiro-OMeTAD. In addition to the small λ value and larger v value, another major cause of high hole mobility is the shortest sulfur (S)⋯sulfur (S) contacts (3.71 Å) compared with other molecules. Previous studies have demonstrated that strong S⋯S interaction is helpful to improve the hole mobility of the molecule.47 From the hole mobility view, all molecules have great potential as promising HTMs.
Interface performance
Hole transport behavior on the interfaces between HTMs and perovskite layers plays an important role in increasing the PCEs of PSCs3,48 In this section, we selected two molecules (BN-TTN-B3 and BN-TTN-N3) as representatives for further research. The (110) surface of perovskite was selected to build the complex of perovskite and HTMs because previous studies have shown that the (110) surface of perovskite was beneficial for hole transportation.49 Surprisingly, the size of the BN-TTN core matches with the (110) surface lattice of tetragonal perovskite well (Fig. 6a), which provides great support for the interaction of four sulfur atoms in the BN-TTN core and four Pb atoms in CH3NH3PbI3 (Fig. 6b). The interactions between S and Pb atoms are dominant in the complex. The calculated bond lengths of the S–Pb bonds were 3.716 and 4.114 Å (Fig. 6b), which are longer than the covalent bond of S–Pb (2.39 Å). Moreover, we also investigated the surface binding energy (Eads) based on a stable complex, which was obtained by the formula: Eads = EHTM-CH3NH3PbI3 − (EHTM + ECH3NH3PbI3), (where EHTM-CH3NH3PbI3, EHTM and ECH3NH3PbI3 are the total electronic energies of the HTM adsorbed on the perovskite system, the pristine HTM, and the perovskite surface, respectively). The surface binding energy of −1.85 eV showed a strong interaction of the HTM and perovskite. Besides, we also employed the independent gradient model (IGM)50 to perform a detailed analysis of the interaction between the two fragments of the HTM and perovskite using the Multiwfn program51 (Fig. 6c). The results showed that the interaction mainly occurs on the BN-TTN core and one triphenylamine group of BN-TTN-B3 and perovskite.

(b) The front and top views of the optimized structure of BN-TTN-B3/perovskite (equatorial one), and the S–Pb bond length along with the surface binding energy are shown. (c) The independent gradient model (IGM) to perform a detailed analysis of the interaction between the HTM and perovskite for BN-TTN-B3. The green color represents the area of weak interaction. (d) Isosurface view of the spatial charge density difference at the same value upon the formation of an HTM/perovskite interface; the yellow and cyan colors indicate the electron gain and loss, respectively. The planar average electron density difference (Δρ) is integrated over the x–y plane for the HTM/perovskite systems as a function of the z coordinate (perpendicular to the surface). (e) The contour plots of the CBM and VBM, along with the electrostatic potentials of the CBM and VBM viewed from the (010) surface. 
To determine the flow direction of hole carriers at the interface, we continue to consider the charge difference density (CDD) plots of the complex. The CDD is defined as the difference between the charge density after bonding and the atomic charge density at the corresponding point.52Fig. 6d shows the CDD for the complex, along with the planar average electron density difference (Δρ) integrated over the x–y plane for the HTM/perovskite systems as a function of the z coordinate, the yellow and cyan colors indicate the electron gain and loss, respectively. The CDD map (Fig. 6d) indicates strong interfacial coupling and obvious charge transfer across the HTM/perovskite interface. In combination with the planar average electron density difference, the electron loss mainly occurs on the HTM, and the electron gain mainly occurs on the surface of the perovskite, which means that holes are transferred from the surface of the perovskite to the HTM. To further evaluate the extent of hole transfer across the interface, Bader charge calculation on each atomic charge was considered, which is an important way to quantify the displacement of charge that occurred across the HTM/perovskite interface.53 The result showed that a 0.025-hole carrier has been transferred from perovskite to the HTM surface. This thorough transfer improves the efficiency of interface transfer and effectively avoids recombination.
Moreover, we further studied the orbital charge densities and electrostatic potentials of the valence band maximum (VBM) and the conduction band minimum (CBM), since the electron–hole recombination capacity strongly depends on the overlap of the corresponding orbital charge densities.54 As shown in Fig. 6e, the electron densities from the VBM were primarily located on the HTM adsorbed onto the surface of perovskite, whereas the electron densities of the CBM are mainly located on the perovskite surface. There are little electron overlaps between the CBM and VBM, and this weak coupling may remarkably avoid the charge recombination in the process of efficient interface transfer. Besides, BN-TTN-N3 presents similar fine interface properties (see Fig. S7 in the ESI† for specific information). In addition, we also considered the standing model and obtained smaller adsorption energy (Fig. S7 in ESI†), which means that the main bonding interaction of the interface is still in the flat form.
Conclusions
In summary, we designed nine new organoboron HTMs with BN-TTN as cores and triphenylamine as branches. Their geometric structures, absorption spectrum, stability, hole transport properties, and interface properties are investigated through theoretical calculations. All molecules have suitable HOMO energy levels and similar stability compared with those of Spiro-OMeTAD. Besides, the introduction of the boron–nitrogen group significantly increases the hole transfer behavior. Importantly, the BN-TTN core that matches with the size of the perovskite interface shows strong interface binding ability and rapid charge transfer from the perovskite layer to the HTM layer. Our results are helpful for further promising applications of the boron–nitrogen group in designing efficient HTMs.

 	Fig. 1  Chemical structures of B–N substituted HTMs.	 

 	Fig. 2  Energy level diagram of perovskite, Spiro-OMeTAD, and the studied molecules. The HOMO values of Spiro-OMeTAD and the studied molecules are computed at the B3LYP/6-31G** level and the calculations for the LUMO energy of all molecules were obtained from the expression, LUMO = HOMO + Eg. The valence band (VB) and conduction band (CB) of perovskites are taken from ref. 28 and 29.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Absorption spectra of the studied molecules in dichloromethane at the M062X/6-31G** level (346 nm shown by a blue dotted line is the value for Spiro-OMeTAD). The changing trend of the (b) Stokes shifts (nm) and (c) reorganization energies (λ, eV) from BN-TTN-B1 to BN-TTN-4.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a) The absolute hardness (η), (b) hydrophobic property (LogP) and (c) solvation free energy (ΔGsolv, kcal mol−1) were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G** level, among them, the dotted line represents the value of Spiro-OMeTAD.
