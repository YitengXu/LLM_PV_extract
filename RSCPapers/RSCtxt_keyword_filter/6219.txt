    , Accepted 5th October 2020First published on 5th October 2020AbstractMetal-free dithiafulvalene (DTF) organic sensitizers for dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) applications have been greatly improved and expanded in the last decade. Herein, for DSSC applications, we modified a basic carbazole (CBZ) sensitizer (C0) by substituting additional excellent donor, hexyl dithiafulvalene (HDT), to synthesize two dithiafulvalene-carbazole (DTF-CBZ) compounds using the D–π–A concept, in which either cyanoacrylic acid (HDT-C1) or rhodanine-3-acetic acid (HDT-C2) acts as an acceptor or anchoring group. All the synthesized sensitizers were characterized by various spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques and were successfully applied in DSSCs using the I−/I3− liquid redox couple. UV-visible absorption, electrochemical studies and theoretical calculations (DFT/TDDFT) were used to determine the favoured energy levels for the sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of these two dyes were compared with that of a simple carbazole sensitizer (C0); the PCE improved significantly from 3.96% (C0) to 7.38% (HDT-C1) and 6.90% (HDT-C2). The superior performance is due to the introduction of the strong electron-donating hexyl dithiafulavalene group, which leads to minimized aggregation and also favours rapid regeneration of the oxidized dye from the redox couple in DSSCs. The PCE of HDT-C2 is not drastically reduced compared to that of HDT-C1, probably due to their well-matched HOMO levels with redox potentials of the redox couple. These thermally stable DTF-CBZ organic dyes possess excellent photovoltaic properties and are anticipated to be alternatives to existing materials in DSSC applications; this will be an active methodology to fabricate DTF sensitizers in the broad and quickly growing area of metal-free organic sensitizers in solar cells.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted a wide range of attention in both academia and industry since the motivating work by O’Regan and Grätzel in 1991, in which Ru(II) polyridyl complex used as a dye with the I−/I3− redox couple showed an efficiency of 7.1%.1 Over a period of two decades, the certified efficiency of DSSCs has reached 11.9% using Ru(II) polypyridyl complex as the dye with the traditional I−/I3− redox couple, and the device efficiency has reached 14.3% using metal-free organic dyes, i.e., ADEKA-1 sensitizer, and using Co(II/III) as a redox couple.2–4 Despite their high efficiencies, metal-free organic sensitizers require easy-to-synthesize, low-cost, and less harmful materials that are thermally and photochemically stable. To obtain metal-free organic sensitizers, the most proficient tactic is based on D–π–A, which leads to a broad and intense optical absorption band in the visible spectral region due to the effective intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the D to A units.5–10 Quite a few organic sensitizers have been reported in the literature using the D–π–A approach for application in DSSCs, such as coumarin,11,12 indoline,13–15 triarylamine,16–19 carbazole,20–24 phenothiazine (PTZ),25–29 and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) dyes.30–32 The best device efficiency obtained to date was based on a carbazole scaffold, and the sensitizer indeed played a vital role along with the redox mediator.4 Recently, academicians have paid attention to thermally stable organic sensitizers based on the strong electron donor dithiafulvalene (DTF) scaffold, mainly due to their straightforward synthesis, low cost, and easy to optimize optical and electronic properties for DSSC applications.
Dithiafulvalene (DTF), a strong terminal electron donor, has been used with high success in DSSCs due to its non-planar molecular configuration, which helps minimize the formation of aggregates on the surface of nanocrystalline TiO2.33–35 DTF sensitizers facilitate ultrafast interfacial electron injection from the excited state of the sensitizer to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor.36 Secondly, the recombination of injected electrons with the redox couple can be concealed because of the propeller-shaped molecular structure of DTF. Additionally, the oxidized DTF unit is spatially and conveniently placed to support the movement of electrons towards the redox couple species, ensuring fast dye regeneration. Dithiafulvalenes (DTFs) exhibit unique charge transport characteristics due to their coplanar molecular structures with strong π–π* and S–S interfaces.37
Shihe Yang and co-workers investigated the sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 using metal-free organic DTF sensitizers by adopting the D–π–A concept for the first time.38 In all three sensitizers, keeping the same donor (DTF) and acceptor or anchoring cyanoacrylic acid groups with varying π-bridges or spacers such as phenyl, biphenyl and phenyl-thiophene-phenyl, photon conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 3.15% to 8.29% with an IPCE of 85% were displayed using the I−/I3− liquid redox couple, which is the highest to date using DTF-based dyes. The improved efficiency is due to the increase of both short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) with increasing auxiliary acceptor π-bridge length. These results suggest that the increasing the π-bridge length not only shifts the absorption maxima with enhanced molar extinction coefficients but also improves the overall efficiency of the device. Since then, a few groups have started working on DTF-based sensitizers using the D–π–A concept in which the π-spacers are triphenylamine, phenothiazine and cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene; however, the efficiencies are in the range of 3% to 7%.39–44 In an extension of our efforts towards the development of thermally stable and efficient metal-free organic dyes, we realized that the introduction of a carbazole moiety as a π-spacer, DTF as a donor, and either cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-carboxylic acid as an acceptor moiety may provide better efficiency to DSSC devices. Carbazole derivatives are widely used in several optoelectronic applications based on their optical and electronic properties; however, there are no reports of HDT-CBZ sensitizers for DSSC applications to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we introduced a strong electron donor, 4,5-bis(hexylthio)-1,3-dithiole-2-thione (HDT), at the C6 position of carbazole and either cyanoacrylic acid (HDT-C1) or rhodanine-3-acetic acid (HDT-C2) as an acceptor or anchoring group in these sensitizers. In addition to this, we synthesized a sensitizer containing a cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group at the C3 position of carbazole as a pristine (C0) sensitizer for comparison. All three sensitizers were characterized by various spectroscopic and electrochemical methods. Finally, the new sensitizers were applied for the sensitization of nanocrystalline TiO2 using the I−/I3− redox couple in acetonitrile solvent and showed efficiencies of up to 7.38%. The structures of the dithiafulvalene-carbazole-based sensitizers (C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2) are shown in Chart 1.

Proton (1H) NMR spectra were recorded using a 400 MHz Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer with X-WIN NMR software. The samples were prepared either with CDCl3 or CD2Cl2 according to their solubility, and the concentration was 1.0 × 10−3 M. The spectra were analyzed using Mestrenova software. Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra were recorded on a Waters Quattro micro (Waters Inc, USA). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry was performed on a Shimadzu Biotech Axima Performance 2.9.3.20110624: Mode: Reflectron-HiRes; Power: 85. Major fragmentations are given as percentages relative to the base peak intensity. Cyclic voltammetric measurements were performed on a system-controlled CH instruments model CHI 620C electrochemical analyzer using 1 mM sample solution in tetrahydrofuran solvent using 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as a supporting electrolyte at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. The working electrode was glassy carbon, standard calomel electrode (SCE) was used as a reference electrode, and platinum wire was used as a counter electrode. After a cyclic voltammogram (CV) was recorded, ferrocene was added, and another voltammogram was measured. A Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e instrument was used for the thermogravimetric measurements at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 with 10 mg of sample. The detailed instrumentation characterization (UV-visible absorption, time-resolved fluorescence measurements, theoretical calculations (DFT/TDDFT) and device fabrication measurements) of these dyes are available in the supporting information.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Synthesis
The detailed synthetic route of the dithiafulvalene-carbazole based sensitizers is shown in Scheme 1. The intermediate compounds 1, 2 and 3 were obtained as per literature methods.7,45,46 The vital intermediate, i.e., compound (4), was synthesized by adopting our previously reported procedure, and we adopted Knoevengel condensation of formyl derivates with either cyanoacetic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid using ammonium acetate and acetic acid. Finally, the desired sensitizers (C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2) were obtained by silica gel column chromatography purification. All intermediate compounds and the three sensitizers were fully characterized by various spectroscopic techniques and electrochemical methods. The MALDI-TOF spectrum of HDT-C1 showed a peak at m/z = 722.14 (CHN) and that of HDT-C2 showed a peak at m/z = 826.95, which were assigned to their comparable molecular ion peaks (Fig. S1 and S8, ESI†). The 1H NMR spectra of the C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 sensitizers are shown in Fig. S1–S8 (ESI†).

3.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
Determining the optical properties of sensitizers is essential in order to know how the sensitizers absorb photons and convert them into electrical energy. For this reason, we measured the absorption properties of C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 in THF solvent. Fig. 1a demonstrates the absorption spectra of all three sensitizers, and the corresponding wavelengths of their absorption maxima and molar extinction coefficient data are given in Table 1. The absorption spectrum of each sensitizer consists of two prominent peaks at 300–500 nm and around the 550 nm region. The absorption peaks at 320 and 386 nm in the case of C0 sensitizer purely belong to the π–π* transitions of carbazole moiety, as this sensitizer does not possess a DTF donor; meanwhile, in the case of HDT-C1, the peak in this region is a combination of both the donor DTF and π-spacer carbazole. In contrast, the absorption peak red-shifted to 435 nm in the case of the HDT-C2 sensitizer because of the presence of powerfully electron-withdrawing rhodanine-3-acetic acid. In addition to this, the absorption peak in the longer wavelength region at ∼550 nm is feasible due to intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) bands from the donor DTF to the acceptor (cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid) through the carbazole π-spacer. Fig. 1b illustrates the absorption properties of these D–π–A acceptor dyes adsorbed on the surface of the 6 μm thick TiO2 films. The absorption spectra of all three sensitizers exhibit red-shifts in comparison with the solution spectra due to the interaction of the carboxylic acid group with TiO2 and also possibly because of aggregation. In both the dyes, the onset of absorption extends up to 650 nm. The emission spectra were measured in THF solvent at room temperature for C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 dyes, which showed emission maxima at 446, 460 and 498 nm, respectively. The emission intensity was almost quenched when the dyes were adsorbed on TiO2. The singlet excited-state lifetimes were measured in THF solvent; they were found to be in the range of 0.86–0.21 ns (Fig. S9, ESI†), and the excited lifetimes were quenched when the dyes were adsorbed on TiO2. The quenching of both the steady-state emission and excited-state lifetime on TiO2 is presumably because of photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. In the end, we calculated the singlet excited energies (E0–0); these are useful in calculating excited state oxidation potentials, as will be discussed later, from the intersection of the absorption and emission spectra; they were found to be 2.98 ± 0.05, 2.99 ± 0.05 and 2.61 ± 0.05 eV for C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2, respectively.

Subsequently, we measured the redox potentials of all three sensitizers in THF solvent using a differential pulse voltammetric technique, which is useful for the estimation of the HOMO and LUMO positions of the dyes; the data are presented in Table 1. The results in Fig. 2 and Table 1 suggest that the sensitizer C0 has a quasi-reversible oxidation peak at 1.12 V vs. NHE, whereas in the cases of HDT-C1 and HDT-C2, the oxidation peak cathodically shifted to ∼0.75 V vs. NHE. The first oxidation potentials of these DTF donor-based dyes were used to calculate the HOMO positions, and the LUMOs were estimated by subtracting the band gaps from the HOMO levels. The found energy levels of these newly synthesized sensitizers are appropriate for the energy levels of TiO2 and the electrolyte.47 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels (vide infra) calculated by both experimental and theoretical methods are in good agreement with each other. Finally, we used the expression  to assess the excited-state oxidation potentials  of the C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 dyes, which were estimated to be 1.86, 2.23 and 2.06 eV, respectively.

3.2. Theoretical studies
The optimized energy structures, electronic distributions, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) maps, theoretical absorption spectra, HOMO–LUMO energy levels, and bandgaps of the sensitizers (Fig. 3, Tables S1 and S2, ESI†) were theoretically calculated using the Gaussian 09 program package with the functional basis set of the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level. Table S1 (ESI†) suggests that both the HRD-C1 and HRD-C2 dyes have similar optimized structures in which the hexyl group on the sulfur atom of the DTF donor and on the 9-N of carbazole are in the same plane, which will not only minimize the aggregation but enhance the solubility of the sensitizers in common organic solvents. Fig. 3 and Table S1 (ESI†) suggest that the HOMOs for the C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 dyes are completely located on the donor and π-spacer (DTF and carbazole) units, whereas the LUMO is delocalized over the carbazole and cyanoacrylic acid groups in C0 dye. On the other hand, the LUMO was delocalized completely on the anchoring group of cyanoacrylic acid (HDT-C1) or rhodanine-3-acetic acid (HDT-C2) and partially on the carbazole moiety, which indicates efficient intramolecular electron injection from the singlet excited state of the dye to the conduction band of TiO2. This has been proved even from the MEP maps; for both dyes, the positive electrostatic potential was concentrated at the donor DTF and π-spacer connecting the carbazole, while the negative potential was concentrated at the anchoring group (either cyanoacrylic acid or rhodanine-3-acetic acid). The HOMO–LUMO gaps of the dyes are 3.34, 2.74 and 2.57 eV for C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2, respectively. Additionally, we performed single-point TDDFT studies (the first 15 vertical singlet–singlet transitions to obtain the absorption spectra; see Fig. S10, ESI†) with THF as the solvent and calculated the vertical excitation energies for the singlet together with the oscillator strengths, as listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The experimental absorption properties with the theoretical data show that the results are in excellent agreement with the experimental values.

3.3. Photovoltaic performance
First, we calculated the amounts of sensitizer adsorbed on the surface of TiO2. This was executed by desorbing the adsorbed dye, and the obtained amounts are listed in Table 2. The loaded amounts of C0, HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 dyes were found to be 4.13 × 10−7, 4.06 × 10−7 and 3.99 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. The dye loading amount of HDT-C2 was low compared to that of HDT-C1 dye, probably due to the larger molecular size of the former dye and its weak interaction with the nanocrystalline TiO2 surface compared to HDT-C1. The photovoltaic performance of all three sensitizers, i.e., the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) and photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves, was evaluated in test devices using TiO2 films of 8 μm thickness with a volatile acetonitrile-based electrolyte composition of 0.5 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP (4-tert-butyl pyridine), and 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII). The detailed device fabrication was described in our preceding studies.7,25Fig. 4a and b illustrate both the I–V and IPCE spectra of all three sensitizers, and the respective photovoltaic data are presented in Table 2. As shown in Table 2, the carbazole sensitizer (C0) without a DTF donor has a low short-circuit current (Jsc) of 7.22 ± 0.37 mA cm−2, whereas in the cases of the sensitizers with a DTF donor, i.e., HDT-C1 and HDT-C2, the current was enhanced to 14.12 ± 0.43 and 13.19 ± 0.46 mA cm−2, respectively. The open-circuit voltages (Voc) and fill factors of all three sensitizers are in the range of 0.76 ± 0.02 to 0.78 ± 0.02 and 0.67 to 0.72 V, respectively. These results clearly suggest that the presence of the donor DTF improved the photovoltaic performance and device efficiency of the sensitizer C0 by 3.96 ± 0.14%, and the efficiencies of the DTF-substituted sensitizers increased by 7.38 ± 0.32% and 6.90 ± 0.23%, respectively. The difference in the PCEs of C0, HDT-C1, and HDT-C2 is reflected in the IPCE spectra, as illustrated in Fig. 4b. In the case of C0 sensitizer, a maximum IPCE of ∼60% was observed at 410 nm. On the other hand, the introduction of the donor DTF in the HDT-C1 dye IPCE rose to 78%, and in the case of HDT-C2 it was further enhanced to 80%. However, the presence of a rhodanine-3-acetic acid anchoring group in HDT-C2 broadened the IPCE spectra, which can help tap more photons and leads to a higher PCE than the remaining two dyes. However, this was true only when compared to the C0 sensitizer; the reason may be the non-conjugated structure between the rhodanine ring and carboxylic anchoring group, whereas the HDT-C1 sensitizer has a cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group that maintains the conjugation.48HDT-C1 dye with a conjugated cyanoacrylic acid anchoring group not only enhances the electron injection into the TiO2 conduction band but also slows the charge recombination, as was the case in our previous reports. However, literature reports point out that the device efficiency is drastically reduced in dyes containing rhodanine-3-acetic acid compared to those with a cyanoacrylic acid group using the same scaffold. In the present study, the efficiency is not greatly reduced, probably because the charge regeneration is the same in both HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 as their HOMOs are not much different.

The present DTF-based D–π–A dyes showed better device performance than literature-reported dyes in which the π-spacer is either a triphenylamine or phenothiazine scaffold. There are many reasons for the high efficiency of the present dyes compared to the literature-reported dyes; one is that the onset of the IPCE extends to 650 nm, and another is that the HOMO levels of the present sensitizers are very close to the oxidation potential of the redox couple, so the driving force for the regeneration of oxidized dye is <0.2 eV.34,40,41,44 On the other hand, the efficiencies of the HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 dyes are lower than those of literature-reported DTF-C3 (8.29%);38 this is probably due to the more extended π-conjugation, so that the onset of IPCE extends to 700 nm as a result of the high efficiency. Further, the efficiencies of HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 may be enhanced by the introduction of more π-conjugation between the carbazole π-spacer and anchoring group.
3.4. Thermogravimetric analysis
In addition to the efficiency of devices, the thermal properties of dyes are essential for the commercialization of DSSC technology. For this reason, we adopted thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) to understand the thermal stabilities of the newly synthesized dyes. As reported in the literature, the thermal stability of the thiafulvalene derivatives is high.49Fig. 5 illustrates the TGA curves of the sensitizers from 50 °C to 300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under an inert atmosphere. As shown in Fig. 5, both the HDT-C1 and HDT-C2 dyes are stable up to 150 °C, and the initial weight loss (∼5%) observed from 100 °C to 150 °C is due to the removal of moisture. Among metal-free organic dyes, dithiafulvalene compounds show good thermal stability and facile synthesis; thus, commercialization of this technology may be possible.

4. Conclusions
In conclusion, we successfully introduced a strong electron donor HDT unit into a carbazole for the first time to form an HDT-substituted carbazole (HDT-CBZ) hybrid donor using the D–π–A concept for application in DSSCs. Two novel sensitizers have been synthesized using the HDT-CBZ donor, in which either cyanoacrylic acid (HDT-C1) or rhodanine-3-acetic acid (HDT-C2) functioned as an acceptor or anchoring group. With the introduction of the HDT donor, the absorption peak red-shifted and the PCEs of the DSSCs were enhanced compared to that of the simple carbazole sensitizer, with η values of 3.96 ± 0.14% (C0) to 7.38 ± 0.32 (HDT-C1) and 6.90 ± 0.23% (HDT-C2). The improved PCE can be attributed to the HDT moiety, which improved the electron-donating capacity and decreased the dye aggregation, enabling increased intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to the acceptor. Also, the driving force for the regeneration of the oxidized dye from the redox couple is <0.2 eV, and the charge recombination is slow due to the propeller structure of the DTF moiety. These results strongly indicate that changing the molecular design approach for DTF-based DSSCs through further careful manipulations and device fabrication would enable the development of DTF sensitizers in this broad and rapidly rising area of metal-free DTF-based organic sensitizers in photovoltaic applications.
