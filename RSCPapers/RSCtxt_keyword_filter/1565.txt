    , Accepted 22nd March 2013First published on 26th March 2013AbstractHigh-performance solution-processable ZnO thin films for use as electron-transporting layers (ETLs) of inverted-structured polymer solar cells (I-PSCs) are developed via a low-temperature annealing (<200 °C) sol–gel process. The properties of the low-temperature-annealed ZnO (L-ZnO) thin films (used as ETLs) are optimized based on the evaluation of the roles of the internal nanocrystal (NC) orientation and film-surface morphology in charge transport/transfer in I-PSCs. The low-temperature annealing conditions (dynamic annealing or static annealing) could be successfully manipulated to alter the NC orientation of the L-ZnO films, whereas tactical control of the precursor-coating conditions enabled the embedding of nanoripples on the film surfaces. Suppression of the preferential (002) plane NC orientation of the L-ZnO layers is beneficial for charge transport in I-PSCs; these devices should be evaluated in a manner different from field-effect transistors (FETs). The performance of ETLs is further enhanced by the development of nanoripple-embedded L-ZnO film surfaces, which furnish an increased area for contact with the active layers. The I-PSCs fabricated using the optimized L-ZnO films display a >20% higher power-conversion efficiency (PCE) than those employing the conventional L-ZnO films for a range of active materials including poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) and poly(thienothiophene-co-benzodithiophenes)7-F20 (PTB7-F20)/phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blends. A PCE of 6.42% is achieved for the I-PSCs using the optimized L-ZnO films and PTB7-F20/PC71BM blends as the ETL and active materials, respectively. This study presents a universal method for optimizing sol–gel-driven ZnO-based ETLs, whilst the low-temperature processability and long-term stability of the developed ETLs are beneficial for the commercialization of I-PSCs.
Introduction
While silicon-based solar cells have dominated the market, polymer-based solar cells (PSCs) have been recognized as promising candidates for the development of next-generation solar cells.1,2 The inherent advantages of polymers such as ultra-low cost, high processability, and flexibility have enabled the exploration of new niches, including disposable energy devices. Achieving competitive power-conversion efficiency (PCE) and long-term air stability are the major challenges in the commercialization of PSCs.3,4 The rapid progress made recently in the field of PSC research has enabled the achievement of ∼8% PCE through the development of novel low-band-gap polymers and the control of their nanomorphology, in addition to providing appropriate choice of buffer layers.5–7 Conventional PSCs utilize indium-doped tin oxide (ITO) as a transparent anode, and a low-work-function metal such as Al is used as the cathode. However, these conventional PSCs display low environmental stability because of the highly oxidative cathodes. Moreover, the materials that are most popularly used as the hole-transporting buffer layer (HTL), i.e., thin films of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS), are acidic enough to etch the ITO anode, further limiting device stability.8,9 Avoiding the use of low-work-function metals and acidic materials has been the key issue in improving the stability of PSCs.
Inverted-structured PSCs (I-PSCs) have been developed as an alternate strategy for augmenting the stability of PSCs. In I-PSCs, electrons are collected through an electron-transporting buffer layer (ETL) deposited on ITO, and high-work-function metals such as Au and Ag collect the holes.7,10 Selective hole-blocking capability, low resistivity for electron conduction, and transparency in the visible spectral region are the key parameters for determining the efficiency of ETL materials. Various wide-band-gap n-type metal oxides possessing an appropriate conduction band (CB) and high electron-transporting properties, such as TiO2,11 ZnO,8,12–16 Cs2CO3 (ref. 17), and certain polyelectrolytes with a large dipole moment5 have been successfully applied as ETLs.
ZnO has been commonly utilized as the ETL for I-PSCs because of its high electron mobility, reduced light-absorption ability, and high environmental stability.8,12–16 ZnO thin films prepared by various methods such as atomic layer deposition (ALD),18 electrodeposition,12 spin-coating from colloidal crystalline nanoparticles,8 and sol–gel technique13–16 have been successfully used as ETLs for I-PSCs. Among these thin films, those derived from the sol–gel technique have received the highest attention because this process yields high-quality films without requiring any vacuum instrument. These characteristics make the sol–gel technique amenable to low-cost manufacturing, which is the predominant advantage of using PSCs. In this method, ZnO precursor solutions are deposited on the ITO surface followed by thermal annealing at elevated temperatures. The fabrication conditions such as the composition of the precursor solutions, coating methods, heating process, and temperature determine the end-properties of the ZnO-ETL films.13–16,19,20 Cao and co-workers reported the influence of ZnO-film coverage of the ITO anode surface on the performance of I-PSCs.15 In their study, the coverage and packing density of the ZnO nanoparticles were varied by manipulating the concentration of the precursor solution and spin-coating conditions. Several groups have intensively studied the effects of the morphology of the ZnO-film surface on the ETL performance.15,16,19,20 Nanoripples (ripples of a few tens of nanometers in size) were deliberately formed on the film surface by adjusting the processing conditions. The nanoripple-containing film surfaces could enhance the electron-collection efficiency because the interfacial contact area with polymer active layers increased. Thus far, in a majority of studies on sol–gel-driven ZnO thin-film ETLs, the samples have been prepared by thermal annealing at a relatively high temperature (>300 °C), because the charge mobility of ZnO films is known to increase for highly crystalline ZnO thin films as revealed in the studies of field-effect transistors (FETs).21,22
Low-temperature-annealed, sol–gel-driven ZnO (L-ZnO)-based ETLs for I-PSCs have recently been reported by a few groups.13,14 By carefully choosing the ZnO precursors and fabrication conditions, ETL performance comparable to that of the high-temperature-annealed films (300–350 °C) could be achieved with the L-ZnO films (annealing temperatures: 150–200 °C). The resulting L-ZnO films were amorphous in nature, and their electron mobility (∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), measured using FETs, was lower than that of the high-temperature-annealed crystalline ZnO films (∼1 cm2 V−1 s−1). Nevertheless, this electron mobility was comparable to that of the organic active layers of PSCs, thus affording acceptable ETL performance. However, in all of the previous reports, the electron mobility of ZnO-ETLs for I-PSCs was determined using FETs, in which the electrons are transported in the lateral direction (parallel to the substrates, Fig. S1b in the ESI†), whereas the electrons are, in fact, transported in the vertical direction (perpendicular to the substrates) in PSCs (Fig. S1a in the ESI†). Because the electron transport of ZnO thin films in each direction may vary depending on the orientation of the internal nanocrystal (NC) and the degree of crystallinity,21 the estimation of the electron mobility of PSCs based on the values obtained using FETs may not be conclusive. To the best of our knowledge, no research on the electron transport of ETLs in the vertical direction with respect to the ZnO NC orientation has been reported thus far. Optimization of the internal NC morphology of L-ZnO-based ETLs for improved charge transport should contribute significantly to the enhancement of the device performance.
The development of high-performance solution-processable L-ZnO-based ETLs is reported herein, and the properties with crucial influence on the performance of I-PSCs were optimized based on the internal NC orientation and film-surface morphology. Application of the optimized L-ZnO films as ETLs for I-PSCs allowed the achievement of 6.42% PCE for devices fabricated using poly(thienothiophene-co-benzodithiophenes)7-F20 (PTB7-F20)/phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) blends as the active materials. L-ZnO was fabricated via the sol–gel technique followed by annealing at 200 °C. The NC morphology and the surface morphology of the L-ZnO films were manipulated by altering the coating processes (spin-coating duration) and thermal-annealing methods (dynamic or static). Control of the NC orientation and its influence on vertical electron transport were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and electron-only device characterization, respectively. The nanoripple-embedded surface morphology was also successfully constructed by adjusting the solvent drying kinetics, as confirmed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The effects of the internal NC morphology and surface morphology of the L-ZnO films were clearly revealed in the I-PSCs possessing a range of active materials including poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT)/[6,6]-phenyl-C60-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM) blends and PTB7-F20/PC71BM blends.
Experimental
Preparation of L-ZnO ETL
The precursor solution was prepared by dissolving zinc acetate dihydrate (Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O)/ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) in 2-methoxyethanol (0.45 M) under vigorous stirring for 12 h at 60 °C for the hydrolysis reaction in air. The freshly prepared ZnO precursor solution was spin-coated onto indium-doped tin oxide-coated glass (ITO/glass) at 4000 rpm for 15 s (and 1 min) under a N2 atmosphere to produce a 40–50 nm thick layer. ITO/glass substrates (sheet resistance <20 Ω □−1) were treated with UV/ozone for 20 min before use. For SA, the substrates, spun for 15–60 s, were placed on a hot plate that was heated at 200 °C and annealed for 5 min. DA was performed by placing the as-spun ZnO sol–gel films on the hot plate at RT. The temperature was then ramped to 200 °C over a period of 4 min. Once the temperature of 200 °C was achieved, the substrates were immediately removed from the hot plates.
Fabrication of P3HT/PC60BM-based I-PSCs
The polymer blend solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mg of P3HT (RIEKE Metals) and 1 mg of PCBM (Nano-C) in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. The solutions were stirred for >5 h at RT before use. A commercial spray gun assembly (Lumina automatic spray gun, nozzle size: 1.0 mm) was used for the deposition of the active materials. In a typical spraying, the P3HT/PCBM blend solution was loaded into a fluid cup and deposited onto the L-ZnO/ITO/glass at a 0.18 ml min−1 rate through the air-spray gun, which was powered by N2 gas at 0.8 kgf per cm2. The thickness of the photoactive film was ∼250 nm. The spray nozzle tip was maintained at a distance of 25–30 cm from the substrate for depositing the active layers. The morphology of the active layers was optimized by the SSO treatment.35 The active layers of the coated samples were transferred to a vacuum thermal evaporation chamber for the deposition of the Ag (1000 Å) top electrodes. The Ag layer was deposited under a high vacuum of 10−6 Torr using a shadow mask. The active area of the devices was 0.09 cm2.
Fabrication of PTB7-F20/PC71BM-based I-PSCs
The PTB7-F20/PC71BM blend was fabricated by dissolving 8 mg of PTB7-F20 and 12 mg of PC71BM (Nano-C) in 0.97 ml of CB and 0.03 ml of 1,8-diiodooctane. The solutions were stirred for >6 h at 40 °C under ambient conditions. The solution was deposited onto the L-ZnO/ITO/glass substrate by spin coating at 1000 rpm for 20 s in a N2 atmosphere after passing the solution through a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter. The thickness of the photoactive film was ∼100 nm. The as-spun PTB7-F20/PC71BM film was aged for 1 h under ambient conditions at RT before the deposition of the anode. MoOx (50 Å)/Ag (1000 Å), used as the anode of this cell, was deposited under high vacuum (10−6 Torr) using a shadow mask. The active area of the devices was 0.09 cm2.
Device characterization
Measurement of the J–V characteristics was performed using a Keithley 2400 source unit. A class-A solar simulator with a 150 W Xenon lamp (Newport) served as the light source, and the light intensity was adjusted using a monosilicon detector (with KG-5 visible color filter) calibrated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to minimize the spectral mismatch for a light intensity corresponding to AM 1.5 G one sun illumination.
Characterization of L-ZnO film morphology
The surface morphology of the L-ZnO film on the ITO/glass was measured using an AFM (SPA 300 HV, Seiko Instrument Inc.). A surface profilometer (Alpha-Step IQ Profilers) was used to measure the film thicknesses. XRD analyses were performed using a high-resolution X-ray diffractometer (RIGAKU, Cu anode, 40 kV, 200 mA). For XRD analysis, the ZnO film was spun on a silicon (100) substrate at 3000 rpm and then annealed. This procedure was carried out more than four times for each sample.
Electrical properties of L-ZnO films
The L-ZnO films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solutions onto an ITO/glass substrate at 3000 rpm followed by annealing. In order to fabricate a sufficiently thick L-ZnO film, this procedure was repeated six times to produce a film thickness of ∼250 nm. The prepared L-ZnO films on ITO/glass were transferred to a vacuum thermal evaporation chamber for the deposition of the Al (1200 Å) top electrodes to complete the electron-only devices. The Al layer was deposited under high vacuum (10−6 Torr) using a shadow mask. The active area of the devices was 0.09 cm2. The J–V characteristics measurements were performed using a Keithley 2400 source unit.
Results and discussion

Fig. 1 shows schematic illustrations of the preparation of the L-ZnO films and the device structures of the I-PSCs used in this study. L-ZnO thin-film-based ETLs with thicknesses of ∼40 nm were prepared on an ITO/glass substrate (sheet resistance <20 Ω □−1) using the sol–gel method. A 0.45 M solution of zinc acetate dihydrate Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O/ethanolamine (NH2CH2CH2OH) in 2-methoxyethanol was spin-coated onto ITO/glass at 4000 rpm for 15–60 s under a N2 atmosphere followed by annealing at 200 °C. This low-temperature annealing was performed in two different modes: (i) the temperature was gradually increased from room temperature (RT) to the target annealing temperature at a heating rate of ∼60 °C min−1 (dynamic annealing mode, denoted as DA, Fig. 1b) or (ii) the temperature was fixed at the target temperature for 5 min (static annealing mode, denoted as SA, Fig. 1b). The L-ZnO films were amorphous-dominant as indicated by the absence of sharp XRD peaks (Fig. 2a), typically observed for the highly crystalline ZnO films prepared by high-temperature annealing (>400 °C).22–24 Nevertheless, the characteristic signature of the intrinsic NC orientation of ZnO was distinctly observed in the L-ZnO samples, as typified by the broad peaks in the region 32–36°. These peaks in Fig. 2a are correlated with the (100), (002), and (101) ZnO crystal planes (Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) no. 36-1451). As shown in Fig. 2a, all L-ZnO samples exhibited these three peaks, whose heights varied with the samples, indicating that the NC orientation could be controlled by the processing conditions. The preferential NC orientation of ZnO could be estimated by calculating the texture coefficient (TC), defined in the following equation:12 (1)where I(hkl) is the measured relative intensity, I0(hkl) is the relative intensity of the corresponding plane from the JCPDS data, and n is the number of reflections. Table S1† summarizes the calculated TC values of various L-ZnO films. The (002) plane, parallel (or c-axis perpendicular) to the substrate (Fig. 2a),23 is known to enhance the lateral charge transport, whereas the (100) plane, perpendicular (or c-axis parallel) to the substrate, is known to resist the lateral charge transport, as has been intensively studied using FET devices.22 From the values of TC (002) and TC (100), one can find that the higher (002) orientation density was yielded by SA, whilst the more random NC orientation was obtained by DA. This result is in good agreement with previous reports on high-temperature-annealed crystalline ZnO films.22,24,25 Ong et al. reported the preparation of (002)-oriented ZnO films via SA at 500 °C; the corresponding FETs displayed charge mobility improved by several orders of magnitude as compared to the randomly oriented crystalline ZnO films owing to the parallel NC orientation relative to the substrates. The dependency of the NC orientation of the L-ZnO films developed herein with respect to the annealing modes was further clarified by growing NCs of the L-ZnO films at elevated temperatures up to 300 °C. The XRD patterns became sharper and better resolved at higher temperatures, whereas the height ratio of the peaks remained constant (Fig. S2 and Table S1 in the ESI†), thereby confirming the dependence of the NC orientation on the annealing technique.

Many previous studies have reported that the crystallinity of the ZnO layers is a crucial parameter in determining the charge-transport properties of ZnO-based ETLs for I-PSCs.14 These studies primarily discussed the charge mobility, measured using FET devices, as the defining parameter.21–23 However, charge transport in I-PSCs is perpendicular to the direction of the substrates, whereas that in FETs is measured parallel to the direction of the substrates (Fig. S1†). Consequently, the discussion on the charge transport of the ZnO-ETLs for I-PSCs should be re-evaluated because NC orientation can influence the charge transport in an opposite manner for each of the aforementioned devices. In order to directly characterize the electron transport of L-ZnO films in the vertical direction (perpendicular to the substrates), we measured the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) of the L-ZnO films by using electron-only devices (the configuration is shown in Fig. S1†). The L-ZnO film thickness was maintained at >250 nm to confirm the space-charge region.26 The logarithmic JL3–V curves in Fig. 2b are characterized by three distinct regions corresponding to different conduction mechanisms. The built-in voltage (V) during the measurements was 0.4 V, determined from the work-function difference between ITO and Al.27,28 The data conform to Ohm's law in the lower voltage regime (<0.2 V) owing to the effect of thermal free carriers; the deep traps at the ITO/L-ZnO interface affected the charge-transport profile as reflected by the slopes of the JL3–V curves. In the presence of carrier traps in the L-ZnO layer, a trap-filled-limit region was observed between the Ohmic region and the trap-free SCLC region. The SCLC in the trap-free region can be characterized using the Mott–Gurney square law:29,30 J = (9/8)εμ(V2/L3)(2)where ε is the static dielectric constant of the medium and μ is the carrier mobility. The SCLC of the L-ZnO films produced by DA was an order of magnitude greater than that fabricated by SA regardless of the coating conditions. This result indicates that the NC orientation of L-ZnO influences the electron mobility in the vertical direction of the device, and a lower degree of orientation along the (002) plane (in other words, more random orientation of the NCs) is preferential for charge transport in I-PSCs. The controlled nucleation and growth of the ZnO NCs achieved using DA promotes more favorable assembly of the NC morphology for I-PSCs.
The J–V characteristics of the I-PSCs fabricated using various L-ZnO thin film-based ETLs are shown in Fig. 3, and the derived data are summarized in Table 1. The cell performance was measured under AM 1.5 G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2). Consistent with the results of the SCLC measurements, the I-PSCs utilizing the L-ZnO films fabricated via DA displayed higher PCEs than those using the films produced by SA under the same coating conditions (Fig. 3 and Table 1). In the P3HT/PC60BM-based I-PSCs, the fill factor (FF) of DA15-P3HT (DA15 indicates the films prepared by 15 s spin-coating followed by dynamic annealing) was much higher (62%) than that of the statically annealed counterpart, SA15-P3HT (57%). In general, the FF of PSCs is closely related to the series resistance (RS) values of the cells, which are strongly correlated with the vertical electron transport. Because the active layers were fabricated under identical conditions, the ∼50% higher RS value of SA15-P3HT (14.8 Ω cm2) compared to that of DA15-P3HT (10.2 Ω cm2) reflects the influence of the electron mobility of L-ZnO-ETLs, indicating that the internal NC morphology within the L-ZnO layers, controlled by the annealing conditions, may exert a considerable influence on the final I-PSC performance.

The effects of film-surface morphology on the performance of ZnO-ETLs have been actively investigated by several groups. Construction of ripple-like nanostructures on the surface of ZnO films was first reported by Yang and coworkers, who achieved enhanced PSC performance because of an increase in the contact area between the active layers and the ETLs due to the nanoripples.16 Several modifications of this process to achieve similar structures have suggested the use of crystalline ZnO films prepared by high-temperature annealing (>300 °C). Doping the precursor solutions with nanostructured seeds19,20 or controlling the heating/cooling rate during the annealing steps16,31 are some techniques that have been successfully used to prepare nanoripple-embedded ZnO films. In order to incorporate nanoripples onto the surface of the L-ZnO films fabricated herein, the precursor coating conditions and the annealing modes were manipulated, and it was found that the presence of residual solvent molecules can facilitate the assembly of the nanoripples. Fig. 4 shows the tapping-mode AFM images of the L-ZnO films. The L-ZnO films prepared by DA were characterized by a much higher root mean square roughness (Rrms) than those prepared by SA, which were flat, similar to typical spin-coated films. Granular surface features were observed for the DA films prepared using a longer spin-coating duration (DA60), whereas the nanoripple-embedded surface morphology was achieved when the spin-coating time was reduced to 15 s (DA15).

Preparation of ZnO films using sol–gel chemistry is a complex process. The precursor molecules are polymerized during gelation, forming numerous nanoparticles, and thin films are obtained by the assembly of these nanoparticles.25 The assembly may be determined by the kinetics of the gelation process.32 A slow heating process, similar to that used for DA preparation in this study, is beneficial to the assembly process because sufficient time is provided for structural relaxation of the precursor molecules.16,33 Furthermore, the solvent molecules can provide enhanced chain mobility for the nanoparticle assembly, as reported by Rabani et al.32 In the presence of residual solvent molecules in combination with DA, the nanoparticles can be assembled to generate particular features in the films. As shown in Fig. 4, a shorter spin-coating duration (15 s, Fig. 4a) gave rise to increased residual solvent affording the formation of nanoripples, whereas granular features were formed in the presence of reduced residual solvent (60 s, Fig. 4b). The low-temperature annealing process (∼200 °C) used herein prolongs the presence of solvent molecules. The nanoripples achieved with this process were ∼15 nm in height and ∼150 nm in length, similar to those of the previously reported crystalline ZnO films.16,19,31 Under the present spin-coating conditions, the nanoripple-embedded surface morphology could be achieved by using a spin-coating duration of <15 s, as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† The abrupt heating shock applied during SA brings about heterogeneous evaporation of the solvent, resulting in smooth L-ZnO films (Fig. 4).32 The cell performance depended on the presence of the nanoripples (Fig. 3a and Table 1). The PCE of DA15-P3HT (3.59%) was ∼11% higher than that of DA60-P3HT (3.22%). Optimal ETL performance of the L-ZnO films was attained when the preferred internal NC morphology and nanoripple-embedded surface morphology were achieved. A PCE of 3.59% was achieved for the P3HT/PC60BM-based I-PSCs (specifically, DA15-P3HT) by utilizing the optimized L-ZnO buffer layers, which represents >20% enhancement of the PCE as compared to the cells that utilize L-ZnO films prepared by the conventional process (SA60-P3HT, PCE = 2.96%).
The performance of L-ZnO-ETLs was further evaluated by fabricating high-efficiency I-PSCs using PTB7-F20/PC71BM as the active materials. The PTB7 series of polymers is known to have a narrow band-gap of ∼1.8 eV, which enables the absorption of a wider range of the solar spectrum.7 Consistent with the P3HT/PC60BM-based cell behavior, the L-ZnO layers constructed by DA displayed enhanced ETL performance as compared to those derived from SA. The J–V characteristics of the PTB7-F20/PC71BM-based I-PSCs (Fig. 3b) demonstrate a PCE of 6.42% for DA15-PTB7-F20, which is ∼25% higher than that of SA15-PTB7-F20 (5.12%, Table 1). The FF was considerably improved in the optimized cells. Note that the work functions of the various L-ZnO films, determined by Kelvin probe microscopy (KPM), were nearly identical (Fig. S4 in the ESI†), indicating that the variation in the performance of different L-ZnO films was derived primarily from the NC morphology and surface morphology. The consistent enhancement achieved for various I-PSCs confirms that optimization of the NC morphology and surface morphology of the L-ZnO ETLs is a universally applicable strategy. Finally, the long-term stability of the developed P3HT/PCBM-based I-PSCs was evaluated in air under ambient conditions. After 50 days of aging, PCEs decreased by <6%, thereby demonstrating the high intrinsic environmental stability of the developed I-PSCs (Fig. 5).

Conclusions
The performance of sol–gel-driven L-ZnO films applied as the ETL of I-PSCs was optimized by evaluating the effects of the internal NC orientation and film surface morphology. Control of the NC morphology was achieved by adjusting the annealing conditions, and a nanoripple-embedded film surface was attained by controlling the solvent drying kinetics during coating. The effects of NC orientation within the L-ZnO layers on electron transport in the vertical direction (perpendicular to the substrates) were elucidated based on the analysis of electron-only devices. The optimization of L-ZnO buffer layers could enhance the PCE of I-PSCs by >20% when different active materials were used. A PCE of 6.42% was achieved for the I-PSCs by employing the optimized L-ZnO and PTB7-F20/PC71BM blends as the ETL and active materials. This study may serve as a guideline furnishing a universal approach for optimizing the performance of sol–gel-driven metal oxide-based ETLs, whereas the low-temperature processability and long-term stability of the developed ETLs enable the commercialization of I-PSCs.
