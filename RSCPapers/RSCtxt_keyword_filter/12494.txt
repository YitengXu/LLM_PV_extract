    , Accepted 27th June 2016First published on 28th June 2016AbstractA general methodology is proposed to produce active cathode/anode materials for lithium-ion batteries with a hierarchical structure. In particular, the active electrode materials in nano-dimension (<10 nm) are carbon-coated and encapsulated inside submicron-scale graphite-like carbon spheres derived from a poly-(styrene-acrylonitrile) copolymer prepared by mini-emulsion polymerization. The graphite-like carbon matrix inside the spheres provides high conductivity and mechanical rigidity and keeps well separated the nanoparticles (NPs) of the active materials to avoid their aggregation. The carbon spheres possess mesopores for improving the diffusion of Li ions in and out of the active materials, and for accommodating possible volume changes. The inter-space among the carbon spheres provides continuous channels which facilitate electrolyte infiltration. The proposed methodology has been applied to prepare anatase TiO2/carbon anode materials. The lithium-ion battery prepared using this anode material exhibits a reversible capacity of 173 mA h g−1 at 500 mA g−1, with a negligible capacity fading even after 600 cycles. Moreover, the applied preparation route can be easily scaled up for industrial productions.
1 Introduction
Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are widely applied in various portable electronic devices and are increasingly used in electric vehicles and in storage devices for intermittent energies, such as solar and wind, where safe, high power and low cost batteries are required.1,2 It is recognized that developing proper electrode materials with a well-defined structure is the key step for the application of LIBs in the advanced fields of electro-mobility and grid power. Tremendous efforts have been devoted to explore new materials for both cathode and anode and techniques for obtaining desired structures.3 Regardless of the selected electrode materials, one of the main challenges in LIBs is the complex thermodynamic equilibrium at the electrode–electrolyte interface, involving inevitable side-reactions,4 which are responsible for low capacity, poor cycling stability and low efficiency. Therefore, engineering the surface properties of electrode materials, including reducing the particle size and controlling their morphology, to enhance the electrochemical (EC) compatibility with specific electrolytes and to facilitate the electron transfer and ion diffusion, has been the major concern to improve the battery performance.5,6
The commonly used strategy is to develop composite materials with adjustable surface chemistry.7 Carbon, due to its superior EC stability, electronic conductivity, tunable microstructure and low cost, has been widely explored as a surface coating of electrode materials.8,9 Various carbon allotropes (amorphous carbon,10 carbon nanotubes,11,12 graphene,13,14etc.) and preparation technologies (mechanical blending,15,16 CVD,17,18 spray coating,19,20 electrospinning and carbonization,21,22etc.) have been intensively studied in association with various anode and cathode materials. The difficulty of these technologies is to address the limitations of single active materials while at the same time avoiding excessive interference.23–27 Some general conclusions have been reached in the literature. First, it is required that the conductive carbon network must be uniformly distributed and in good contact with the core active materials so as to reduce the interfacial resistance.28 Secondly, well-defined porous structures are essential to facilitate electrolyte diffusion, and in particular the fast transport of Li ions from and into the active material.29 Thirdly, sufficient space should be provided to accommodate the potential volume change of the active material (e.g., silicon and sulphur) during cycling, so as to disperse the internal stress and avoid its deterioration (pulverization or cracking).30,31 However, the methodologies reported in the literature to realize the above requirements are often applicable only to specific active materials, involving rather complex processes that are unfavourable for large-scale production. Therefore, it is necessary to develop general and controllable approaches, which can be realized through simple and scalable processes.
Designing a carbon-based hierarchical structure is a feasible strategy to meet these criteria. Magasinski et al. reported a hierarchical bottom-up assembly route for the synthesis of a porous Si–C composite through a CVD approach.32 Zhang et al. proposed a hierarchical tubular structure constructed using ultrathin carbon-coated SnO2 nanoplates.33 Wu et al. designed a multiscale and multilevel carbon coating to prevent mechanical deterioration and polysulfide dissolving in Li–S batteries.26 Han et al. built 3D mesoporous carbon nanoparticles (NPs) and a graphene hierarchical architecture to accommodate selenium, forming a binder-free cathode which presents superior EC performance.34
In this work, we propose a general methodology to generate a hierarchical architecture of LIB electrode materials, where the nanoscale active materials are caged inside a mesoporous carbon structure. We select anatase TiO2, a classical anode material,35–42 as a model system to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed methodology. It is known that anatase TiO2 has both a low Li-ion diffusion coefficient (10−15–10−9 cm2 s−1) and electronic conductivity (10−12–10−7 S cm−1), which significantly restrict its performance when serving as the anode.37,38 Carbon coating has been widely used to improve its performance,10,39–51 particularly using glucose as the carbon source. Although these studies demonstrate substantial improvement in EC performance by various types of carbon coating, long-term (cycle number > 500) cyclability is still unsatisfactory in most cases. We believe that this arises because the general criteria summarized above are only partially satisfied by these composite active materials.
In this work, we aim at realizing a hierarchical structure of TiO2 anode materials that possess the following four features: (1) the TiO2 NPs are very small (<10 nm) (for high surface area and short diffusion path), (2) they are not only coated by graphite-like carbon, but also well separated and distributed inside submicron-scale carbon spheres (for good conductivity and no aggregation), (3) mesopores are present inside the submicron-scale carbon spheres (so as to accommodate possible volume changes and improve electrolyte diffusion), and (4) the inter-space among the densely packed carbon spheres generates interconnecting channels (for electrolyte infiltration). To realize these features, we start with in situ encapsulation of TiO2 NPs (<10 nm) (feature 1) into sub-micron poly-(styrene-divinylbenzene-acrylonitrile) (PSAN) spheres. We then proceed by properly drying the densely packed PSAN spheres, and then the active anode material is obtained by pyrolysis of the precursor under desired conditions, where the poly-acrylonitrile (PAN) forms graphite-like carbons (feature 2) and the poly-styrene (PS) is sacrificed to form the mesopores inside each sphere (feature 3). Another crucial reason for us to choose PSAN is that when a proper pyrolysis procedure is followed, the PSAN spheres can retain their original shape after the high temperature pyrolysis, thus warranting feature 4. We show that such a composite anode material not only exhibits high rate performance and capacity but also improves the cycling stability with respect to those reported in the literature. Most importantly, the developed preparation process is sufficiently simple and scalable to be amenable for industrial productions.
2 Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
All chemicals obtained from Sigma-Aldrich are of analytical grade, and were used without further purification. TiO2 NPs (<10 nm) were prepared by an anhydrous synthesis method and the details can be found in our previous work.52 In brief, TiCl4 was added dropwise into ethanol (1:5, in volume). The mixture was injected into benzyl alcohol with the volume ratio of 6:20 and reacted for 8 h under stirring in an oil bath maintained at 80 °C. The obtained products were thoroughly washed with ethanol. After hydrophobic surface modification with MPS [3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate], the TiO2 NPs were dispersed homogeneously in the mixture of monomers: styrene (St), acrylonitrile (AN) and divinylbenzene (DVB) (7:3:0.1 in weight). The net mass ratio between TiO2 and the monomer components was set to be 4:3, 4:5 and 4:8, respectively. With the intense shear force,52 the pre-emulsions were formed in the water phase and stabilized by both steric (Tween 20) and cationic (CTAB, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide) surfactants. Initiated by V-50 [2,2-azobis(2-methylpropanimidamide) dihydrochloride], in situ emulsion polymerization at 70 °C for 6 h was applied to form the submicron-scale composite spheres. The average diameter of the composite spheres, determined by dynamic light scattering, is in the range of 80–150 nm, within which the TiO2 NPs are uniformly encapsulated.
The composite spheres were then progressively densely-packed by centrifugation force using a Multifuge 3S-R (Thermo Fisher, Switzerland) at 4500 rpm for 15 min and dried in an oven at 60 °C overnight. The dried precursor of the anode material was ground in a mortar for 10 min and the obtained powder was transferred into a tube furnace (Borel TO1100, quartz tube diameter ∼ 6.5 cm) for a two-step heat treatment. The first step was oxidation in air with the ramping from room temperature to 150 °C at 5 °C min−1, from 150 °C to 220 °C at 2 °C min−1 and finally from 220 °C to 250 °C at 1 °C min−1, after which the sample was held at 250 °C for 1 h. The second step was pyrolysis in nitrogen, with the ramping from room temperature to 400 °C at 5 °C min−1, from 400 °C to 500 °C at 1 °C min−1, and finally from 500 °C to the desired pyrolysis temperature (650, 700, 750, 800 or 850 °C) at 5 °C min−1. The sample was maintained at each desired temperature for 1 h to accomplish the pyrolysis process.
2.2 Materials characterization
The crystalline pattern of the products was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) on an X'Pert Pro powder diffractometer (Cu Kα, 45 kV, 40 mA) (PANalytical B.V., the Netherlands). The powder morphologies were investigated using a Zeiss Leo 1530 FEG scanning electron microscope (5 kV) and FEI Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope. Elemental mapping and HAADF images were performed using an FEI Talos F200X STEM (200 kV). Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed on a Mettler Toledo TGA/SDTA 851 analyzer. Confocal Raman measurements were conducted with a combined STM/Raman microscope (Ntegra Spectra, NT-MDT, Zelenograd, Russia). Nitrogen sorption at 77 K was performed using a Quantachrome Quadrasorb SI analyzer. Prior to the measurements, samples were degassed under vacuum (10−1 mbar) at 423 K for 12 h.
2.3 Electrochemical characterization
EC tests were conducted using the CR2032 coin cell system with lithium metal as the counter electrode at room temperature. In the preparation of the electrodes, the active material and PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) binder dissolved in NMP (N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) (6% wt) were mixed (9:1 in weight) by sufficient vortex treating aided by additional NMP. The obtained slurry was coated onto Cu foil and pressed to a uniform film with a thickness of 150 μm. The casted foil was placed in an oven at 90 °C for 2 h for complete evaporation of the solvent and then vacuum-dried overnight prior to use. The typical mass loading of the active material on each disk (14 mm in diameter, punched from the Cu foils) was 1.5–2.0 mg. The electrolyte, 1 M LiPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate (1:1 in volume), was provided by Novolyte (USA). Celgard 2325 membrane was used as the separator. Cell assembly was performed in a glovebox under an argon atmosphere. The cells were cycled at various current densities in the voltage range from 1.0 to 3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+) on a Land CT2001A battery test system at room temperature. Cyclic voltammograms (CV) were measured using a Biologic instrument (VMP3) over 0.0–3.0 V vs. Li/Li+ at various scanning rates from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1. For charge/discharge performance characterization, 1C is defined as 165 mA g−1.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Design and synthesis of the hierarchical architecture
The objective of this section is to describe the procedure for preparing a hierarchical structure which satisfies the requirements illustrated in the Introduction. The active material in the form of NPs is carbon-coated and encapsulated inside the carbon matrix present as submicron-scale spheres. The carbon matrix improves the conductivity and mechanical properties and separates individual NPs to avoid their aggregation. The carbon spheres exhibit mesopores, necessary for ease of Li-ion diffusion in and out of the active material and accommodating possible volume changes. In addition, the inter-space among the carbon spheres generates continuous channels, which are used for electrolyte infiltration. It is worth noting that such a design concept is fully general and can be applied for various cathode and anode materials. In this work, we use anatase TiO2 as a model system to prepare the anode material. Scheme 1 illustrates the sequence of individual steps needed to complete the process for the manufacturing of anode materials.

Step 1: preparation of submicron-scale composite spheres.
An in situ mini-emulsion polymerization process52 is developed to prepare the submicron-scale composite spheres within which anatase TiO2 NPs are embedded and distributed. Compared to conventional emulsion polymerization, in situ mini-emulsion polymerization is proven to be more reliable and effective in the encapsulation and dispersion of inorganic NPs within the polymer spheres. Since the TiO2 NPs used in this work52 are positively charged, the pre-emulsion is prepared using a cationic surfactant, CTAB, and a cationic initiator, V-50. A steric surfactant, Tween 20, is also applied to further improve the emulsion stability. To reach the desired size and narrow size distribution, the emulsion droplets were generated using a Microfluidizer, M-110Y (Microfluidics, USA).52 The dominant polymer to encapsulate the TiO2 NPs in this work is PAN, because of its high conversion rate during pyrolysis to graphite-like carbon. The secondary monomer, St, co-polymerizes with AN, leading to the co-polymer (PSAN).53 The cross-linker, DVB, provides a 3-D cross-linking needed to strengthen the encapsulation network. Both the St and DVB components are decomposed during the pyrolysis, leading to the formation of mesopores.
Composite spheres with different mass ratios between TiO2 and PSAN have been prepared and their composition measured by TGA. For the mass ratios of TiO2 to PSAN equal to 4:3, 4:5 and 4:8, the corresponding TGA curves are shown in Fig. 1a. In all the cases there are two distinct drops in mass in the temperature ranges 300–400 °C and 400–550 °C, which are ascribed to the degradation of PAN and PS, respectively. The normalized weight fractions of TiO2 for the three samples have been estimated based on the stable plateau at high temperature, equal to 62%, 42% and 20%, denoted as 62TP, 42TP and 20TP, respectively. A typical TEM image of the 42TP sample is shown in Fig. 1b, where it is seen that the TiO2 NPs are indeed uniformly distributed inside the spheres.

Step 2: generation of the hierarchical architecture through pyrolysis.
After the above composite spheres are densely-packed by centrifugation and dried, the resulting powder is pyrolyzed under proper conditions. The pyrolysis procedure consists of two steps: oxidation in air and carbonization in an inert atmosphere. Oxidation is an essential step to warrant the formation of “ladder” chains via cyclisation, which is carried out by heating the powder up to 250 °C in air with a flow rate of 100 ml min−1 and holding it at 250 °C for 5 h. The cross-linker, DVB, is used to prevent the possible collapse of the precursor structure when the temperature increases above the glass transition temperature of the copolymer (approx. 100 °C). After the oxidation step, the colour of the powder changes from white to brownish, owing to successful intermolecular cyclisation of the polymer chains. The SEM image of the oxidized powder is shown in Fig. 2a, where the well-defined contour of the individual particles confirms that the original precursor structure is maintained. Finally, the carbonization in nitrogen flow at various temperatures is carried out, as discussed in Section 2.1, in order to produce a proper carbon network inside the individual spheres around the TiO2 NPs.

3.2 Characterization of the material structure

Fig. 2b to d show the typical high resolution TEM images of the carbonized samples at 750 °C. The fine crystalline lattice of the TiO2 NPs (5–8 nm, white arrows) can be distinguished from the amorphous carbon structure (red arrows), and the estimated lattice space is 0.33 nm. In the case of 20TP with the lowest fraction of TiO2 in Fig. 2b, the TiO2 NPs are separated by a thick layer of carbon. In the cases of 42TP and 62TP with higher fractions of TiO2, shown in Fig. 2c and d, respectively, the space between TiO2 NPs is substantially reduced, and some TiO2 NPs seem to be directly in contact with their neighbouring particles. From the standard TEM images and EDX mapping, in the case of 20TP shown in Fig. 2e, it is seen that the carbon matrix fully captures the TiO2 NPs, while in the case of 62TP in Fig. 2f, the C signal is weaker than the Ti signal, which may indicate incomplete C coverage. The exact mass loading of TiO2 in each sample after pyrolysis at different temperatures is quantified by TGA and summarized in the ESI, Fig. S1 and Table S1.† As expected, the carbon content decreases slightly as the pyrolysis temperature increases from 650 to 850 °C.
XRD and Raman characterization have also been performed to understand the effect of the pyrolysis temperature on the TiO2 structure. Typical results in the case of 42TP are shown in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3a, we compare the XRD patterns between the pure TiO2 NPs, and the 42TP sample after the oxidation step and further carbonization at different temperatures. Note that the pure TiO2 NPs are the same as those used inside the composite spheres. The diffraction peaks of the pure TiO2 NPs (the first curve from the bottom) coincide with the well-known anatase TiO2 pattern (JCPDS card no. 21-1272), thus confirming that the anhydrous synthesis used in this work actually produces pristine anatase TiO2 NPs. In addition, it is seen that for the 42 TP sample, the diffraction peaks corresponding to the different pyrolysis temperatures are similar to those of the pristine TiO2, except that above 850 °C, a very small peak at 43° corresponding to the (210) crystalline plane of rutile TiO2 appears, implying possible changes in the TiO2 structure from anatase to rutile. However, the other characteristic peaks of rutile TiO2 are not visible, thus indicating that such a structural change is still insignificant. It should be noticed that there is no significant peak sharpening, though one would expect that temperature higher than 700 °C would lead to the growth of TiO2 NPs. This is a confirmation that the individual TiO2 NPs are well separated by the carbon matrix.
 Fig. 3  (a) XRD and (b) Raman spectra of pure TiO2 NPs, the 42TP sample after oxidation, and the 42TP sample after pyrolysis at different temperatures; (c) deconvolutions of the D and G band spectra in (b) to D1 (red curve), D3 (dark yellow curve) and G (blue curve) bands. 
The Raman spectra are reported in Fig. 3b and c. In Fig. 3b, the pure TiO2 NPs after calcination at 650 °C (the first curve from the bottom) exhibit peaks at 145, 394, 510 and 640 cm−1, typical Eg, B1g, B1g/A1g and Eg of anatase TiO2, and the D-band (1360 cm−1) and G-band (1610 cm−1) associated with carbon are relatively flat and weak. The 42TP sample after the oxidation step displays a very strong and broad peak envelope due to the presence of the oxidized polymer that covers the signal of TiO2. After pyrolysis at various temperatures, the peak of the oxidized polymer disappears, and more intensive D and G bands of carbon are present. Since the carbon content decreases as the pyrolysis temperature increases, the D and G signals are progressively weakened as the temperature increases from 650 °C to 850 °C. Instead, the TiO2 characteristic peaks (e.g. Eg) are more dominating as the carbon content decreases. The Raman spectra corresponding to the D and G bands of carbon in Fig. 3b have been de-convoluted to peaks at approx. 1360, 1530 and 1610 cm−1, as shown in Fig. 3c. These are assigned to a disordered graphitic lattice (D1) (defects and edges), amorphous carbon (D3) and ideal graphite (G), respectively.43 The peak intensity fractions of each band at different pyrolysis temperatures are summarized in Table S2.† It is seen that as the pyrolysis temperature increases from 650 to 700 °C, the intensity fractions of both the amorphous carbon decrease, while that of the graphite increases substantially. On the other hand, for the pyrolysis temperature in the range of 700 to 850 °C, the intensity fraction of each band does not change significantly, and the intensity fraction of the graphite reaches above 40%. This may be related to a required minimum time for the polymer to convert to a regular graphite-type structure. At further higher temperatures, the polymer conversion rate is too high to facilitate the formation of the regular graphite-like structure, leading to a decrease in G and increase in D1. Thus, from the above results, the most suitable temperature for our polymer to convert to the regular graphite-like structure should be in the range between 700 and 800 °C. This motivates us to select 750 °C as the pyrolysis temperature in the following investigations.

Fig. 4a shows the adsorption/desorption isotherms for the 20TP, 42TP and 62TP samples after pyrolysis at 750 °C. All the isotherms exhibit the type IV hysteresis loop (IUPAC nomenclature), indicating the presence of mesopores in the composites. In particular, in each case two hysteresis loops exist, which are more evident in the 42TP sample. The loop in the low relative pressure region between 0.45 and 0.8 is of type H2, which corresponds to the capillary condensation of liquid N2 in the mesopores present inside (as well as among) the TiO2/C spheres. The loop in the high relative pressure region between 0.9 and 1.0 is of type H3, reflecting the presence of macropores, related to the space among the clusters of the powder. The BET (Brunauer–Emmett–Teller) surface area estimated from the isotherms in Fig. 4a is 250, 189 and 128 m2 g−1 for samples 20TP, 42TP and 62TP, respectively. Such a clear trend in the variations of the BET surface area with the particle composition confirms that the surface area is generated mainly by the pyrolysis of the polymer inside the spheres. The inset of Fig. 4a shows the estimated pore size distributions for the three samples. The reported pore diameters are all above 3 nm. This means that all the pores are in the meso- and macro-size ranges, while the amount of micropores (<2 nm) is negligible. A possible rationale is that we use PSAN, instead of PAN, to encapsulate the TiO2 NPs. In this case, the PS component, as sacrifice, decomposes to short chains and is removed by the N2 gas during the pyrolysis, leading to the formation of mesopores inside the spheres. In the case of 62TP, the pore diameter distribution is mainly in the range of 3–10 nm, while for 20TP and 42TP, it shifts progressively to the range above 10 nm. This is consistent with the fact that as the TiO2 fraction inside the spheres decreases, the space among the TiO2 NPs, which is the location of PSAN, enlarges, consequently allowing the generation of larger mesopores inside the spheres after pyrolysis.

We have also measured the adsorption/desorption isotherms for the 42TP sample pyrolyzed at 650, 750 and 850 °C, which are shown in Fig. 4b. The estimated BET surface areas in the three cases are rather comparable (221, 189 and 230 g m−2 at 650, 750 and 850 °C, respectively). The estimated pore size distributions are also similar, characteristic of bimodal distribution with one peak in the 3–10 nm range and another one above 10 nm, even though the amount of pores with diameters > 10 nm is significantly larger for the case at 750 °C than for those at 650 and 850 °C.
3.3 Electrochemical performance
Anatase TiO2, which is the active material in the composite, possesses a stable structure for Li-ion insertion/extraction. The redox reaction governing the EC process is as follows: xLi+ + xe− + TiO2 ↔ LixTiO2(1)
Theoretically, there is at most one unit of Li capable of insertion into one unit of TiO2 in the tetragonal phase, corresponding to a theoretical capacity of 335 mA h g−1. However, during the insertion process in bulk titania, the anatase transforms from its original tetragonal phase to a symmetric orthorhombic Li0.5TiO2. This means that only half of the available interstitial octahedral sites are occupied by Li ions. Thus, the maximum reversible insertion of Li is restricted to 0.5, resulting in a capacity of 167 mA h g−1.54–56 In the case of TiO2 NPs with sizes smaller than 7 nm such a phase transition is kinetically favored and therefore the LiTiO2 phase is formed.57
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) scanning for the cell prepared using the 42TP sample pyrolyzed at 750 °C was carried out in the scanning rate range of 0.1–1.0 mV s−1 and from 0.0 to 3.0 V.58 As shown in Fig. 5a, the CV curves exhibit the typical pair of cathodic and anodic peaks, which are assigned to the lithium insertion into and extraction out of the TiO2 crystalline structure, respectively. As the scanning rate increases from 0.1 to 1.0 mV s−1, the cathodic peak shifts from ∼1.6 to ∼1.5 V, while the anodic peak shifts from ∼2.0 to 2.3 V, as indicated by the arrows in Fig. 5a. The enlarged gap between the positions of the redox peaks is associated with higher polarization. In addition, the CV curve broadens as the scanning rate increases. The effect, due to which the overpotentials are increasing at higher current densities, reveals the kinetic limitations when the reaction rate increases, particularly strong for small TiO2 NPs with a large specific surface area.59,60 Moreover, a weak cathodic peak has been observed around 0.6 V when the scanning rate is above 0.5 mV s−1, possibly owing to the formation of SEI (solid-electrolyte interphase) films at this voltage.61,62 To mitigate the influence of such SEI films, in the following charge/discharge investigations, the voltage window is limited within 1.0–3.0 V. In Fig. 5b, we compare the CV curves at the scanning rate of 0.1 mV s−1 for the cells prepared using the 42TP samples pyrolyzed at 650, 750 and 850 °C. The CV curves reveal similar profiles, even though the one at 650 °C is slightly broader.

The cells assembled with the active materials prepared using the pure TiO2 NPs, 20TP, 42TP and 62TP, all pyrolyzed at 750 °C, are galvanostatically charged/discharged at the rate, 0.1C (here 1C is defined as 167 mA g−1), in the voltage range, 1.0–3.0 V (vs. Li/Li+), and the resulting voltage profiles are shown in Fig. 5c to f. All the curves exhibit a characteristic discharge voltage plateau at ∼1.7 V and charge voltage plateau at ∼2.0 V, which well correspond to the redox peaks of the CV curves. The charge/discharge process can be explained by the mechanism proposed by Wagemaker et al.57,63 The first monotonic decrease of the potential from the open circuit voltage (∼3 V) to ∼1.7 V is caused by the insertion of a small amount of lithium into the surface region of the anatase TiO2 NPs, forming a solid-solution complex.62,64 The amount of the inserted lithium at this stage is related to the crystallite size and the surface area of the host material. The subsequent potential plateau around 1.7 V corresponds to the main process of lithium insertion into the interstitial octahedral sites of the TiO2 crystal lattice. The length of the plateau reflects the effective capability of the active material to accommodate lithium. The final stage following the plateau is an extended potential decay as a result of the pseudo-capacitive behavior under the applied voltage, leading to additional lithium insertion. This part of the inserted lithium is stored at the surface because the available interstitial sites are now all occupied.57,62,64
Similar to the discharge curve, the charge curve also exhibits three stages, suggesting that the reversible lithium extraction follows the same EC mechanism. In the case of 62TP with the lowest carbon fraction in Fig. 5f, the capacity from the surface storage in the charge/discharge curves is also the lowest, but the plateau region is very flat. In the case of 20TP with the highest carbon fraction in Fig. 5d, the plateau region tends to decline slightly, while the monotonic decrease (discharge) and increase (charge) regions are the most extended. This may reflect some small contribution of the carbon component to the lithium intercalation. It should be mentioned that from the information in the literature,65,66 in the voltage range, 1.0–3.0 V, the contribution of the conductive carbon to the total capacity is very small. To confirm the literature results, we have performed independent measurements for our carbon network in the absence of TiO2, and the characterization results are reported in the ESI (Fig. S2 and S3†). It can be seen that the capacity generated by the conductive carbon network is indeed negligible in the voltage range, 1.0–3.0 V.
Although the capacity from the contribution of carbon in 1.0–3.0 V is very limited, a small amount of Li ions may be electrochemically adsorbed on the surface of graphite-like carbon layers that cover TiO2 NPs, leading to the deviations from the typical charge/discharge curves. Such deviations increase as the carbon content increases. In Fig. 5, the discharge and charge capacities in the first cycle reached 455 and 325 mA h g−1 [coulombic efficiency (CE), 71.4%] for 20TP, 360 and 290 mA h g−1 (CE, 80.6%) for 42TP, and 295 and 230 mA h g−1 (CE, 78.0%) for 62TP. Both the discharge and charge capacities decrease as the TiO2 content in the composite increases, indicating that the increase in the capacities is directly related to the content of the carbon network.
The rate performance for the cells prepared using pure TiO2 NPs, 20TP, 42TP and 62TP pyrolyzed at 750 °C is tested under various current densities from 0.1C to 10C, as shown in Fig. 6a. Although in all cases, the reversible specific capacity decreases as the applied current density increases, in the cases of 20TP, 42TP and 62TP with low current densities (≤1C), the reversible specific capacity is larger than the theoretical capacity of 167 mA h g−1. On the other hand, in the case of pure TiO2 NPs with the same current densities the specific capacity is substantially lower than the theoretical one. This indicates that with the designed hierarchical architecture, the effective insertion phase of our active materials could be LixTiO2 with x > 0.5 which increases as the carbon content increases. The effective values of x > 0.5 may partially arise from certain available active sites in the carbon matrix for Li-ion insertion. The obtained rate performance of the designed composite materials benefits from (1) the small size of TiO2 NPs supplying a high specific surface area and reducing the Li ion diffusion path, (2) the effective coating with the graphite-like carbon improving conductivity, (3) the mesopores inside the carbon spheres improving the electrolyte diffusion, and (4) the continuous channels between the carbon spheres helping electrolyte infiltration. What should be noticed is that, in our testing cells with the two-electrode configuration, the effect from metallic lithium may considerably interfere the performance of the active material at high C rates. Nevertheless, up to 3C in our case (current density ∼ 1 mA cm−2), the obtained results are reliable. Therefore, we applied the 3C rate for the following long-term cycling tests.67

3.4 Long-term cycling stability

Fig. 6b shows the performance of the cells prepared using the composite anode materials from 20TP, 42TP and 62TP pyrolyzed at 750 °C, at a high current density of 3C (500 mA g−1) along 600 cycles (repetition of the measurements is shown in Fig. S4 in the ESI†). It is seen that the reversible specific capacities have reached 173, 160 and 135 mA h g−1 for 20TP, 42TP and 62TP, respectively. The most attractive result is the excellent long-term cycling stability in the case of 20TP, with the capacity fading per cycle practically negligible during the entire 600 cycles. This result further demonstrates the advantages and applicability of the proposed methodology in preparing active electrode materials. Such high stability for long-term cycling for the anatase TiO2 anode materials with a large reversible capacity and current density was seldom reported in the literature. Only recently, Bai and coworkers have reported rather similar results.40,41 In their earlier work,40 they performed a N-doped carbon coating on TiO2, through a direct mixing of an AN monomer with the TiO2 powder, followed by thermal polymerization and pyrolysis at 550 °C. The cell prepared using this active material exhibits a very high specific capacity of ∼200 mA h g−1 at the current density of 500 mA g−1, as reproduced in Fig. 6b (curve 1). Such a high specific capacity was believed to result from the N-doping. However, the long-term cycling stability was evidently unsatisfactory. In their later work,41 the carbon-coating was realized using glucose, instead of AN, as the carbon source, at a pyrolysis temperature of 600 °C. Among the various extents of carbon-coating, the best result is reproduced in Fig. 6b (curve 2). The comparison with the results of this work shows a very similar behavior in both reversible specific capacity and long-term cycling stability. However, it should be pointed out that the best TiO2/C materials of Bai and coworkers were prepared by using a tightly-sealed stainless steel autoclave to anneal TiO2 and glucose. This is indeed facile and quick for laboratory production, but for industrial production, there are various scale-up issues to be solved to warrant the best performance obtained from the lab scale, such as reactor scale-up, reproducibility at different scales, control of the composition homogeneity, carbon-coating homogeneity, porosity of the final materials, etc. Instead, with our methodology, the reproducibility of the hierarchical architecture and the performance can be warranted even on an industrial scale because it is determined by the PSAN/TiO2 composite spheres, which can be well produced on an industrial scale.
In the cases of 42TP and 62TP in Fig. 6b, not only the specific capacity but also the long-term cycling stability is lower than that of 20TP. For 42TP, significant fading in capacity starts after about 350 cycles, while for 62TP, a continuous capacity fading starts already after 50 cycles. This indicates that the TiO2/C ratio inside the carbon spheres plays a crucial role in the performance of the anode material, as concluded also by Bai et al.41 When these results are connected to the pore size distributions in Fig. 4a, it is seen that the active material leading to the best performance is the one which possesses more mesopores larger than 10 nm in diameter, and that is 20TP.
4 Concluding remarks
We have proposed a rather general methodology to generate a hierarchical architecture in active materials to be used as LIB electrodes. Specifically, the active materials are prepared in the form of NPs (<10 nm), and are carbon-coated and encapsulated inside a conductive carbon matrix, thus taking the form of submicron-scale spheres. The carbon matrix inside the spheres improves the conductivity and mechanical properties and separates the individual NPs to avoid their aggregation. The carbon spheres possess mesopores, necessary for increasing the diffusion rate of Li ions in and out of the active material and for accommodating possible volume changes. The inter-space among the carbon spheres generates continuous channels, necessary to allow for electrolyte infiltration. It is worth noting that this design concept is general, applicable for various cathode and anode materials.
To demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of the proposed methodology, we have selected anatase TiO2 as a model system to prepare anode materials. The synthesized TiO2 NPs are <10 nm and in situ encapsulated into sub-micron poly-(styrene-divinylbenzene-acrylonitrile) (PSAN) spheres prepared by mini-emulsion polymerization. The precursor of the anode material is obtained by properly drying densely packed TiO2/PSAN spheres, and the active anode material is obtained by pyrolysis of the precursor under proper conditions, where the poly-acrylonitrile (PAN) forms graphite-like carbons and the poly-styrene (PS) is sacrificed to allow for the formation of mesopores inside the sphere. The LIB based on such prepared active anode materials exhibits a reversible capacity of 173 mA h g−1 at a current density of 500 mA g−1. The most significant result is that at high current density, the capacity fading per cycle is practically negligible during 600 cycles. The high cycling stability demonstrates the advantages and reliability of the proposed methodology in preparing electrode active materials. It should also be mentioned that the proposed synthetic route can be easily scaled to the industrial production of high performance LIBs.
It is evident that the proposed strategy with PSAN can be applied to encapsulate anode and cathode materials only when the electrode materials are stable under the pyrolysis conditions of PSAN. For some materials such as the sulphur cathode, although it is possible to encapsulate sulphur NPs in polymers, the formation of graphite-like carbons through pyrolysis is infeasible, because at such high temperatures sulphur would melt and evaporate completely. A possible solution is to directly use conductive polymers, instead of conductive carbons, to encapsulate sulphur NPs without performing pyrolysis. Thus, although the proposed methodology is general, in practical applications, different techniques and procedures may be needed to realize it.
