    , Accepted 9th May 2013First published on 6th June 2013AbstractBecause of their outstanding molecular optoelectronic properties, perylene diimides (PDIs) are promising alternatives to the commonly used PCBM. However, the overly strong aggregation ability, poor solution-processability and compatibility of PDIs severely limit their photovoltaic applications. We turned to borrowing the amphiphile concept to improve these supramolecular properties. Practically, we fine-tuned the molecular solvophobicity with respect to the molecular solvophilicity, e.g. Fsolvophob/solvophil, by changing the number of the weakly solvophobic 2-methoxyethoxyl (EG) groups in the bay-region of the thienyl-bridged dimeric PDI backbone, forming three PDI dimers of Bis-PDI-T (0 EG), Bis-PDI-T-EG (2 EG) and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG (4 EG) (Scheme 1). The photovoltaic properties using these dimers as the solution-processed non-fullerene electron-acceptor and P3HT as the electron-donor were investigated via the device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PDI dimer/Ca/Al. Bis-PDI-T exhibited overly strong aggregation ability and very poor solution-processability, which severely limited compatibility, giving a very poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0.007%. When two EG groups were attached at the 1,1′-positions, the resulted Bis-PDI-T-EG showed dramatically reduced aggregation ability, improved solution-processability, compatibility and proper phase separation. Small sized phases (∼20 nm) dominated in the active layer and the best PCE was increased to 0.39%. When four solvophobic EG functions were introduced, affording Bis-PDI-T-di-EG with excellent supramolecular properties, particularly, the improvement of the phase separation with an increased phase size of 24 nm and the enhanced electron and hole mobilities, by 2–4 times, with respect to that of Bis-PDI-T-EG. The best PCE was further enhanced to 0.88%. After using 1-chloronaphthalene as the co-solvent of 1,2-dichlorobenzene to further improve the compatibility, the PCE was improved further up to 0.41% for Bis-PDI-T, 0.76% for Bis-PDI-T-EG and 1.54% for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG.
1. Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) with a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure have been quickly advanced in the past several years. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) has beeen approached to 7–9% for the conjugate polymer based OSCs1–3 and 5–7% for the small molecule based OSCs very recently.4 With respect to the fast progress in the conjugate polymer based and small molecule based electron-donor materials, many efforts have been made to develop new electron-acceptor materials. Due to the success of [6,6]-phenyl-C61 (or C71)-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM or PC71BM), used as electron-acceptor materials, much attention has been paid on the chemical modifications of C60 and C70 backbones.5 While it is difficult to chemically modify the fullerene backbone and this limits fine-tuning of the visible and near IR absorptivity and the electronic energy levels, particularly that of the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO). Otherwise, the impurity severely limits the power conversion efficiency of PCBM and it needs special equipments like HPLC to produce high quality PCBM, which then limits the PCBM's price and further the practical applications.6 In a striking contrast, organic molecules can be easily chemically modified and produced largely and cheaply and their absorption spectrum, absorptivity and energy levels of the HOMO and LUMO may be fine-tuned in a relatively wide range. Therefore, non-fullerene electron-acceptors have received much attention in the past decade. However, little progress has been made and the PCE reported to date only approach or exceed ∼2%.7,8
A promising electron-acceptor not only requires excellent molecular optoelectronic properties such as light-harvesting ability, electron-accepting ability and electron-transporting property, but also requires excellent supramolecular properties like good solution-processability, excellent compatibility and proper phase-separation with the electron-donor, long-range ordered ππ stacking but small aggregate domains with the domain size comparable to the effective exciton diffusion length.
As a typical n-type organic semiconductor, perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives generally show strong light-harvesting ability with a broad absorption band, typically ranging from 400 to 600 nm, and a high maximum molar extinction coefficiency (εmax) in the order of 104 M−1 cm−1. They also have an excellent electron-accepting ability because of the well-placed lowest unoccupied molecular orbit (LUMO), ∼−4.0 eV, and promising electron-transporting ability with the electron mobility (μe) in the order of 101–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1.9,10 Most importantly, both the molecular optoelectronic properties and the self-assembling properties can be fine-tuned by varying the substituted functions at the bay-region (1,6,7,12-positions) or 2,5,8,11-positions and/or at the imide-positions.11–13 For example, we have observed that the molecular solvophobicity in the bay-region versus the molecular solvophilicity, Fsolvophob/solvophil, plays a leverage effect on tuning the photophysical properties and the self-assembled nano-morphologies.13a Such tunable properties of the PDI backbone both at the molecular and the supramolecular levels make them promising candidates for developing new non-fullerene electron-acceptors. However, their overly strong aggregation ability, poor compatibility with the electron-donor materials and poor solution-processability severely limit the applications of PDI derivatives as non-fullerene electron-acceptors.
In general, the backbones of the electron-donors are functionalized with solvophilic alkyl tails, for example, the hexyl side-chains on the backbone of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). To endow the PDI backbone with the above-mentioned excellent supramolecular properties, we borrowed the amphiphile concept and synthesized three amphiphilic PDI dimers by attaching the weakly 2-methoxyethoxyl (EG) groups onto the 1,1′-positions of the thienyl-bridged dimeric PDI backbone and 2-ethyhexyl (EH) tails onto the imide positions (Scheme 1). The EG and EH groups, respectively, show solvophobicity and solvophilicity in the organic solvents that are commonly used in preparations of the active layer of solar cells, for example, dichloromethane (DCM), tetrahydrofuran (THF), and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), etc. These dimers thus possess weak solvophobicity, similar to the widely used PCBM. As presented in this paper, while the imide EH tails are retained, increasing the number of the EG groups, going from 0 to 2 and 4, enhances the molecular solvophobicity at the bay-region, and thus the Fsolvophob/solvophil,13a going from Bis-PDI-T, Bis-PDI-T-EG, and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. As a result, the supramolecular properties, which are deeply related with the solution-processed OSC device performances, are fine-tuned by changing the number of the covalently attached EG groups.
 Scheme 1  Molecular structures of the PDI dimers, namely, Bis-PDI-T, Bis-PDI-T-EG, and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. 
The photovoltaic properties using these three PDI dimers as the non-fullerene electron-acceptor and P3HT as the electron-donor were studied by constructing the conventional device configuration of ITO/poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly (styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/P3HT:PDI dimer/Ca/Al and then illuminated using an AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. Our results indicated that the best PCE was increased from 0.007% for Bis-PDI-T to 0.39% for Bis-PDI-T-EG and further up to 0.88% for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. When using 1-chloronaphthalene (Cl-Naph) as the co-solvent of o-DCB to further improve the compatibility, the PCE was further improved up to 0.41% for Bis-PDI-T, 0.76% for Bis-PDI-T-EG and 1.54% for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. Accordingly, our results provided herein clearly demonstrate that the molecular solvophobicity vs. solvophilicity is a key factor to design new PDI based non-fullrene electron-acceptors.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterizations of the PDI dimers
These three PDI dimers were synthesized by following the Stille coupling reaction of mono-brominated PDI (1) and trimethyl-thiophen-2, 5-yl-distannane (Scheme 2). The monobrominated 1a and 1b were got by following our previously reported procedures.14 The 1,12-diEG-7-brominated PDI (1c) was synthesized from bromination of 1,12-diEG PDI (2), and 2 was obtained from 1,12-dichlorinated PDI (3).15 All the key intermediate products and the final PDI dimers were fully characterized with 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and TOF-mass spectra as well as elemental analysis (ESI†).
 Scheme 2  Synthetic procedures to the PDI dimers of Bis-PDI-T, Bis-PDI-T-EG, and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. 
As studied by quantum chemical calculations, each PDI dimer have a highly twisted conformation. The dihedral angles between the PDI–thienyl–PDI planes are within 50–65° for the three PDI dimers (Fig. 1 and Fig. S1, ESI†). As 2 and 4 EG groups are introduced onto the bay-region, the dihedral angle between the two naphthalene ring of the PDI unit is increased: it is 10.07° for Bis-PDI-T, 15.24° for Bis-PDI-T-EG and 32.37° for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG.

All these three dimers were soluble enough in the commonly used organic solvents such as DCM, chloroform, THF, 1-chlorobenzene and o-DCB. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that the Td of the dimers, which represents 5% weight loss temperature under the inert atmosphere, was higher than 350 °C (Fig. S2a, ESI†). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) thermograms of the three PDI dimers (Fig. S2b, ESI†) showed that the PDI dimers had a melting temperature higher than 170 °C in the heating process, suggesting that all dimers are thermally stable enough for utilizations in the OSCs.
2.2. Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of these three PDI dimers were tested in chloroform to study their aggregation and light-harvesting ability (Fig. 2a). EG is an electron-donating group. As shown in Table 1, with the increase of the EG number in the bay-region, going from Bis-PDI-T to Bis-PDI-T-EG and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, the absorption band is red-shifted due to the electron-delocalization from the covalently linked EG groups to the electron-deficient core PDI unit,13c,14 the εmax is increased slightly, and the full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) is also somewhat enlarged. All these spectral features revealed that Bis-PDI-T-di-EG shows slightly enhanced light-harvesting ability with respect to Bis-PDI-T-EG and both of them have improved light-absorptivity as compared to Bis-PDI-T.

Fig. 2b displays the film absorption spectra of the three dimers. All were obtained by drop-casting the corresponding chloroform solution onto the quartz substrate. With respect to the corresponding solution spectrum, the absorption band of the pristine film is broadened with a much larger FWHM value (Table 1). The broader absorption band, red-shifting of the absorption onset (λonset), and particularly the shoulder around 575 nm for Bis-PDI-T and that around 640 nm for Bis-PDI-T-EG, all suggest ππ interactions between the PDI chromophores and aggregation of the dimeric molecules in the film. On the other hand, the absorption spectra of the P3HT/PDI dimers blending films showed that only Bis-PDI-T-di-EG conspicuously broadened the absorption band of blending films (Fig. 2c).
The pristine P3HT film fluoresced around 644 nm (λex = 522 nm) and the PDI dimer films showed a broad fluorescent band around 711 nm, 709 nm and 720 nm for Bis-PDI-T (λex = 550 nm), Bis-PDI-T-EG (λex = 550 nm), Bis-PDI-T-di-EG (λex = 600 nm), respectively. Upon blending P3HT and PDI dimer with a D–A weight ratio of 1:1, fluorescence from both P3HT and PDI dimer was completely quenched (Fig. S3a, ESI†), indicating that photoinduced charge transfer occurred effectively between P3HT and PDI dimer. Under continuous excitation with a 4.0 mW light source for 2 h, the fluorescence intensity from the PDI dimer film only had a loss of <10% (Fig. S3b, ESI†), suggesting good photostability. These results suggest that the PDI dimers is suitable to be used as the photovoltaic materials in the PSCs.
2.3. Electrochemical properties

Fig. 3a shows cyclic voltammograms (CV) of the three PDI dimers with Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The empirical equation of EHOMO/LUMO = −(Eonset (ox/re) + 4.40) eV was applied to estimate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels,17 using the onset of oxidation/reduction potentials, as displayed in Table 1. For comparison, Fig. 3b shows the energy level diagrams of the dimers, as well as P3HT,16 PC61BM,18 and PC71BM.18
 Fig. 3  Energy level diagrams of P3HT, Bis-PDI-T, Bis-PDI-T-EG, Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, PC61BM, and PC71BM. 
Introduction of the electron-donating EG groups onto the bay-region of the dimeric PDI backbone raises the HOMO energy level, while that of the LUMO is affected slightly. The HOMO energy level increases from −5.83 eV for Bis-PDI-T up to −5.65 eV for Bis-PDI-T-EG and −5.57 eV for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, all being lower than that of P3HT (−4.94 eV). The LUMO energy level is of −3.95 eV for Bis-PDI-T and is raised up to −3.84 eV for both Bis-PDI-T-EG and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. The offset of the LUMO energy levels between P3HT (−2.94 eV) and the PDI dimers offers the possibility for the dimers to act as the electron-acceptor materials, facilitating efficient exciton separation.
The electrochemical bandgaps (Ecvg) estimated from the difference between the onset oxidation and reduction potentials, were 1.88, 1.81, and 1.73 eV for Bis-PDI-T, Bis-PDI-T-EG, and Bis-PDI-Tdi-EG, respectively. Such descending trend of bandgaps is consistent with the increase of the electron-donating EG group number, which are introduced in the bay-region.
2.4. Film-forming ability
We chose the solvophobic quartz surface to test the film-forming ability of these three dimers because the PEDOT:PSS film, which is normally used for constructing the BHJ OSC devices, is normally solvophobic. Bis-PDI-T without any EG groups is highly solvophilic and shows very limited film-forming ability. With evaporation of chloroform, Bis-PDI-T gradually formed micro-paticle-like aggregates, accompanied by withdrawing of the solution drop. As two solvophobic EG groups were introduced at the bay-region, Bis-PDI-T-EG shows improved film-forming ability: it can form a film on the solvophobic quartz surface as the chloroform was eventually evapporated. However, there were lots of microparticle-like aggregates dispersed on the film. Distinctly, as four EG groups were introduced onto the 1,1′,12,12′-positions of the dimeric PDI backbone, Bis-PDI-T-di-EG possessed good film-forming ability and good-quality films can be obtained by drop-casting its chloroform solution onto the solvophobic quartz plates.
2.5. Compatibility with P3HT

Fig. 2c shows normalized absorption spectra of the 1:1 blended films of the PDI dimers with P3HT. With respect to the spectrum of the pristine P3HT film, the blended films all show stronger absorption before 525 nm, due to contributions from the electron-acceptor, PDI dimers. In the region of 525–800 nm, the pristine film of Bis-PDI-T and Bis-PDI-T-EG each shows much stronger absorption than the pristine P3HT film (Fig. 2b), while the 1:1 blended films of P3HT/Bis-PDI-T and P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG both exhibit a little bit weaker absorption band, even than the pristine P3HT film within this wavelength range, suggesting that the aggregations of the PDI dimer and P3HT are both somewhat suppressed when they were blended together. Similarly, the blended P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-di-EG film also shows a much weaker absorption band than the pure Bis-PDI-T-di-EG film in the wavelength range from 525 to 800 nm, also implying that the aggregation of Bis-PDI-T-di-EG is weakened after it was blended with P3HT. The slight increase of the 600 nm shoulder from the P3HT:Bis-PDI-T to P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-EG and P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-di-EG blends is due to the fact that the absorption band of the electron-acceptor is red-shifted from 530 to 560 nm and 596 nm when 0, 2 and 4 EG groups are introduced onto the bay-region (Table 1).
Optical images, which were obtained from the optical microscopy—an atomic force microscopy (AFM) accessory (MultiMode 8), revealed that there were lots of micron-scaled aggregates observed from the 1:1 blended P3HT:Bis-PDI-T film, while no obvious aggregate domains were observed from the 1:1 blended P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-EG and P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-di-EG films (Fig. 4), further supporting that introduction of solvophobic EG groups enhances compatibility and prevents overly strong aggregation ability of the PDI dimers both significantly.
 Fig. 4  Optical images of the 1:1 blended P3HT:Bis-PDI-T (A), P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-EG (B), and P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-di-EG (C) films. 
2.6. Photovoltaic properties
BHJ OSCs fabricated from the 1:1 blended films of P3HT and the PDI dimers were tested with the conventional configuration of ITO/PEDOT: PSS/active layer/Ca/Al under an AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2. The best results of devices based on the blends of P3HT/PDI dimer after various process-optimizations are displayed in Table 2 and the representive current density (J)-voltage (V) curves of the corresponding best devices are shown in Fig. 5. The devices were first optimized via the blended ratio of P3HT and the PDI dimer and then using Cl-Naph as the co-solvent of o-DCB. The best D–A weight ratio of P3HT and the PDI dimer was 1:1 and the slight increase of the D–A ratio, and either decreasing or increasing the D–A ratio led to a decrease of the photovoltaic performances (Table S1, ESI†).

 Fig. 5  The J–V curves of the best devices based on the 1:1 blended P3HT and Bis-PDI-T (black), or Bis-PDI-T-EG (red), or Bis-PDI-T-di-EG (blue), respectively, without (opened symbols) or with use of Cl-Naph (solid symbols). For Bis-PDI-T, [Cl-NaPh] = 3%; For Bis-PDI-T-EG, [Cl-NaPh] = 8%; and For Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, [Cl-NaPh] = 1.75%. 
Due to the poor solution-processability and compatibility as well as the overly strong aggregation ability of Bis-PDI-T (Fig. 4A), the blended film quality is poor and only 80% devices worked. The best Bis-PDI-T-based devices showed poor photon-to-electron conversion. Only a very low PCE of 0.007% was achieved. This value is close to the P3HT-only devices without using any acceptor materials (PCE = 0.008%, Fig. S5, ESI†), further strongly supporting the overly strong aggregation ability and overly phase-separation of Bis-PDI-T with P3HT in the blended films. Introduction of two weakly solvophobic EG groups onto the 1,1′-positions of the dimeric PDI backbones improves the solution-processability and compatibility (Fig. 4B). The best Bis-PDI-T-EG-based devices exhibited better photovoltaic properties with an enhanced PCE of 0.39%. Such an increase of PCE with respect to that of the best Bis-PDI-T-based devices was mainly from the dramatic increase of Jsc (1.63 vs. 0.06 mA cm−2) and the improved FF (41.6% vs. 28.9%) as well as the increase of Voc (0.58 vs. 0.40 V). Furthermore, as four weakly solvophobic EG groups were introduced, the PCE of the best Bis-PDI-T-di-EG-based devices was further improved to 0.88%, with an obvious enhanced Jsc (3.22 vs. 1.63 mA cm−2) and increased Voc (0.65 vs. 0.58 V). The high FF of 41.6 and 42.4% were both consistent with the good solution-processability and compatibility of Bis-PDI-T-EG and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG.
Comparisons between the photovoltaic results from the three PDI dimers suggest that functionalizing the dimeric PDI backbone with the weakly solvophobic EG groups is an effective way toward highly efficient PDI-based non-fullerene OSCs due to the improvements of the supramolecular properties.
On the basis of the optimal D–A ratio (1:1), we found that Cl-Naph did positive effects on the improvement of the photovoltaic performances. Particularly, the solution-processability and compatibility of Bis-PDI-T was obviously improved. No micron-scaled aggregates were then observed from the optical image (Fig. S6, ESI†). As a result, all the Bis-PDI-T-based devices worked. The best Bis-PDI-T-based device performances were improved continuously as the [Cl-Naph] (w/w) was increased from 0 to 1 and 2%. 3% of Cl-Naph gave the best results and a further increase of [Cl-Naph] led to a decrease of the PCE (Table 2). With respect to the results without use of Cl-Naph, the Jsc was dramatically increased from 0.06 mA cm−2 to 2.01 mA cm−2, after 3% Cl-Naph was used. The FF was improved from 28.9 to 47.2%, and the Voc was increased from 0.40 to 0.43 V. Together, the PCE was improved to 0.41%.
Similarly, both the Bis-PDI-T-EG and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG-based device performances were all improved by using Cl-Naph as the co-solvent. The PCE from the best Bis-PDI-T-EG-based devices was improved from 0.39 to 0.76% when 8% of Cl-Naph was used. Improvement of the PCE was mainly from the increase of Jsc by 1.77-fold (2.89 vs. 1.63 mA cm−2). Both the FF and Voc were slightly improved.
For the Bis-PDI-T-di-EG-based best devices, the PCE was improved from 0.88% to 1.54%, when 1.75% of Cl-Naph was used. All of the three factors of Jsc, Voc, and FF were improved: the Jsc was enhanced from 3.22 to 3.83 mA cm−2, the Voc was increased from 0.65 to 0.67 V, and the FF were improved from 42.4 to 61.1%.
As shown in Table 2, the PCE was enhanced by 58.6 times, 1.95 times and 1.74 times, respectively, for the best Bis-PDI-T-, Bis-PDI-T-EG- and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG-based devices when Cl-Naph was used as the co-solvent. This suggests that Cl-Naph makes more effects on the highly solvophilic Bis-PDI-T, but less on Bis-PDI-T-di-EG with four solvophobic EG groups at the bay-region. This is due to the fact that the less polar Cl-Naph (dielectric constant, εr = 5.00) with respect to o-DCB (εr = 9.93)19 may significantly enhance the solution-processability and compatibility of the solvophilic Bis-PDI-T, yielding much smaller aggregate domains, as shown from the AFM images (vide post).
2.7. External quantum efficiency
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the best photovoltaic devices based on the 1:1 blended P3HT:PDI dimer were tested. As shown in Fig. 6a, the maximum EQE is increased from 0.011% for P3HT/Bis-PDI-T to 15.35% for P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG and 15.94% for P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. The integrated current density from the EQE curves was 0.04, 1.50 and 2.64 mA cm−2, respectively. All were consistent with the Jsc values calculated from the J–V curves (Table 2). The lower EQE as well as the low Jsc of the Bis-PDI-T-based devices are due to the very poor solution-processability of Bis-PDI-T. The broad cover of the EQE response, extending from 350 nm up to 700 nm, suggests the contributions both from P3HT and the PDI dimer to the photocurrent generation.
 Fig. 6  EQE response of the P3HT/PDI dimer blended films: (a) without and (b) with use of Cl-Naph as the co-solvent. 
As 3% of Cl-Naph was used as the co-solvent, the maximum EQE from the best P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-based device is dramatically increased up to 15.35% (Fig. 6b). Similarly, the maximum EQE is increased up to 21.64% for best P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG-based device and 26.25% for the best P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-di-EG-based device as 8 and 1.75% of Cl-Naph was used, respectively. The current density integrated from the EQE curves was 1.89, 2.86 and 3.70 mA cm−2, respectively. All agree with the Jsc values calculated from the J–V curves (Table 2).
2.8. Film-morphology
Tapping mode AFM was used to probe the film morphology of the best OSC devices. Fig. 7 shows the AFM height and phase images from the 1:1 blended films of P3HT/Bis-PDI-T, P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG, and P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, all without or with use of Cl-Naph as the co-solvent. As mentioned in Section 2.5, Bis-PDI-T without any solvophobic EG groups at the bay-region is poorly soluble and solution-processed and it formed micron-scaled aggregate domains when blended with P3HT (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, the relative smooth area on the blended film was most likely mainly from P3HT, which formed bright phases with the aggregate domain size of 30–180 nm (Fig. 7A and B). When the D/A ratio of P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG was decreased, the bright phase size was also obviously reduced (Fig. S7, ESI†). This further supports that the bright phases are mainly contributed from P3HT, and accordingly the dark phases are mainly from the PDI dimer.
 Fig. 7  Tapping mode AFM height (A, C, E, G, I, and K) and phase (B, D, F, H, J, and L) images of the P3HT/Bis-PDI-T (A–D), P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG (E–H), and P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-di-EG (I–L) blended films either without use of Cl-Naph (A, B, E, F, I, and J) or with use of Cl-Naph: 3% (C and D) for Bis-PDI-T, 8% (G and H) for Bis-PDI-T-EG, and 1.75% (K and L) for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. Note: the film roughness (Rq) is 1.24 nm (A) and 13.2 nm (C) for Bis-PDI-T, 1.56 nm (E) and 1.66 nm (G) for Bis-PDI-T-EG, 2.22 nm (I) and 1.73 nm (K) for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. 
As two or four EG groups are introduced onto the bay-positions of the dimeric PDI backbone, the resulted Bis-PDI-T-EG and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG both show good compatibility with the solvophilic P3HT, the electron-donor. No micro-scaled aggregate domains were observed from the optical image (Fig. 4B and C). The film surfaces are very smooth with a small rms value of 1.56 nm for Bis-PDI-T-EG and 2.22 nm for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. The average phase size is about 20 nm for Bis-PDI-T-EG and 24 nm for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, respectively. A smaller domain size yields a higher interface area between the electron-donor and the electron-acceptor materials, giving more efficient exciton separation, which benefits higher efficiency.
As 3% of the less polar Cl-Naph was used as the co-solvent of o-DCB, the compatibility between Bis-PDI-T and P3HT was significantly improved. No micron-scaled aggregate domains were observed from the optical image of their 1:1 blended film (Fig. S6, ESI†) and the average domain size was significantly reduced down to about 41 nm (Fig. 7C and D). This is well consistent with the dramatic increase of the PCE, going from 0.007 to 0.41% (Table 2). Use of 8 and 1.75% of Cl-Naph also improved the compatibility of other two PDI dimers and thus effectively reduced the average domain size in the 1:1 blended films of P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG and P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, being down to 17 nm for both dimers, agreeing well with the obvious increase of the efficiency.
2.9. Carrier transporting properties
Both the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the 1:1 blended films of P3HT and the PDI dimer were measured using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) method with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PDI dimer/Au (hole-only) (Fig. S8, ESI†) and ITO/TIPD/P3HT:PDI dimer/Al (electron-only) (Fig. S9, ESI†).10e,22Table 3 collects the estimated values of μh and μe both. The hole mobilities from the blended P3HT and PDI dimer films either without or with use of Cl-Naph are all in the range of 0.067 × 10−2 – 26 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, consistent with the reported value of P3HT.20 Without use of Cl-Naph, the film quality of the P3HT/Bis-PDI-T blends is very poor, and the hole mobility is very low (6.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). As 3% of Cl-Naph is used as the co-solvent, the film quality is significantly improved, and the hole mobility is raised to 8.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. For the P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG blends, the film quality is good, and the estimated μh value is of 8.5 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Bis-PDI-T-di-EG shows good compatibility and favorable phase separation with P3HT, the measured value of μh is the highest one among the three dimers, being 26 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Using 8% Cl-Naph as the co-solvent, the hole mobility of the P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-EG blends is slightly raised to 9.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, whereas the hole mobility of the P3HT/Bis-PDI-T-di-EG blends is retained as 1.75% Cl-Naph is used.

Without use of Cl-Naph, Bis-PDI-T forms the micron-scaled aggregate domains in the blended film, the measured electron mobility is of 7.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. As 3% of Cl-Naph is used, good-quality blended film is formed and the domain size is reduced down to about 41 nm, particularly, the dimeric PDI molecules form more ordered packing, as revealed from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. 8), the value of μe is slightly raised to 1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1. With respect to the P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-EG blend, the P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-di-EG blend show a higher μe value (5.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1vs. 2.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), consistent with the stronger phase separation ability and bigger aggregate domain size (24 nm vs. 20 nm) and agreeing well with the increase of the solvophobic EG number (4 vs. 2). As Cl-Naph is used as the solvent, the electron mobility is slightly raised to 4.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-EG blend and to 7.1 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-di-EG blend, both similar with the result observed fron the P3HT:Bis-PDI-T blend. The increase of the electron mobility is consistent with the smaller phases separation carried out by using Cl-Naph as the co-solvent and further the enhancemnet of the photovoltaic properties.

As comparisons, the XRD patterns of the pure P3HT film (green) without (thinner line) or with use of 3% Cl-Naph (thicker line) are also shown in green color. 
2.10. XRD pattern of the pristine P3HT and PDI dimers as well as the blended P3HT/PDI dimer films
To get insights into the molecular packing in the blended films, XRD diffraction patterns were detected. As shown in Fig. 8, the pristine P3HT film shows a broad diffraction band around 2θ = 5.74°, corresponding to a d-value of 1.54 nm, which is resulted from (100) diffraction of the ordered packing P3HT.21 After use of Cl-Naph, for example, 3%, as the co-solvent of o-DCB for preparation of the pristine P3HT film, no obvious changes were observed from the XRD diffractions.
For the P3HT:Bis-PDI-T blended film, there appears a broad diffraction around 1.61 nm (2θ = 5.50°), due to the overlapping of the diffractions from both P3HT and Bis-PDI-T. When 3% of Cl-Naph is used, a much stronger band appears around 1.74 nm (2θ = 5.08°), while the diffraction around 1.54 nm is retained. Such an obvious change in the XRD patterns is consistent with the fact that the use of Cl-Naph significantly improved the compatibility of Bis-PDI-T with P3HT, and thus dramatically improved the film quality and orientation ordering of the Bis-PDI-T hierarchical structures, as revealed from the AFM images (Fig. 7A–D) and the increase of the electron mobility (Table 3).
For both the P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-EG and P3HT:Bis-PDI-T-di-EG blends, the diffraction localized around 1.54 nm is assigned to the ordered packing P3HT and the shoulder around 1.61 nm is contributed to the ordered packing of the PDI dimers, Bis-PDI-T-EG and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. Use of Cl-Naph as the co-solvent does not change the diffraction patterns obviously, which is well consistent with the results from the AFM images that the film morphologies change little except for little reduction of the phase size (Fig. 7E–L). Therefore, the XRD patterns suggest that the reduction of the electron moblities after use of Cl-Naph is most likely resulted from the reduction of the phase size.
Taken together, the film-morphology, carrier mobility and XRD data all support that improvement of the solution-processability and compatibility and reduction of the overly strong aggregation ability, for example, from Bis-PDI-T to Bis-PDI-T-EG and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG, are the key factors for improvement of the efficiency; while for the latter two dimers, with respect to Bis-PDI-T-EG, the four solvophobic EG groups on Bis-PDI-T-di-EG enhance the phase separation and further imrpove the efficiency.
Conclusions
To obtain highly efficient perylene diimide (PDI) based solution-processed non-fullerene electron acceptors, improving the solution-processability and compatibility and reducing the overly strong aggregation ability, while retaining the ππ-stacking of the PDI chromophores are important strategies. Accordingly, we synthesized three amphiphilic PDI dimers (Bis-PDI-T with 0 EG, Bis-PDI-T-EG with 2 EG, and Bis-PDI-T-di-EG with 4 EG groups) by changing the number of the weakly solvophobic 2-methoxylethoxyl (EG) groups at the 1,1′-positions of the thienyl-bridged dimeric backbone. Increasing the molecular solvophobicity vs. solvophilicity, e.g. Fsolvophob/solvophil, by means of increasing the bay-substituted EG group number can improve the solution-processability and compatibility significantly as well as the phase separation, accompanied by the significantly reduction of the overly strong aggregation ability, also. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is improved from 0.007% for Bis-PDI-T to 0.39% for Bis-PDI-T-EG, and then 0.88% for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. After using 1-chloro-naphthalene (Cl-Naph) as the co-solvent of 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) to further improve compatibility, the PCE was further improved up to 0.41% for Bis-PDI-T, 0.76% for Bis-PDI-T-EG and 1.54% for Bis-PDI-T-di-EG. Our results provided herein, thus, clearly demonstrate that fine-tuning of the molecular solvophobicity versus molecular solvophilicity is a key molecular design strategy to improve the efficiency of the non-fullerene small molecule based OSCs. Considering the fact that most of the highly efficient electron-donor materials are functionalized with solvophilic side chains, this molecular factor may be helpful in the design and synthesis of highly efficient non-fullerene small molecules for photovoltaic applications.
