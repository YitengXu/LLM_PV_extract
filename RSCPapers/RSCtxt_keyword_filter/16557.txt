    , Accepted 7th October 2021First published on 9th October 2021AbstractThe structural instability and vague sensing mechanisms of perovskite materials when detecting gases with different properties are two main obstacles to the development of novel perovskite gas-sensing materials with high sensitivity and selectivity. The current study firstly simulated the adsorption dynamics of typical reductive, neutral, and oxidative gases on the CsPbBr3 surface and then quantitatively analysed the adsorption energy and charge transfer of gases on the surfaces of the semiconductor. Fundamental reasons for the stability improvement of perovskite materials were ascertained by comparing them with the existing simulation results. More importantly, the sensitivity and selectivity mechanisms of perovskites when sensing different oxidizing and reductive gases were summarized by further exploring the oxidation states of central metal ions and combining output therefrom with the existing experimental data. Finally, the equilibrium between the stability of perovskite materials and the detection sensitivity and selectivity for gases with different oxidation–reduction abilities was evaluated. The study may allow accurate qualitative predictions of the sensitivity and selectivity of various types of perovskite materials for gases with distinct characteristics.
1. Introduction
Various applications of ABX3 perovskite materials have emerged. The state-of-the-art perovskite-based solar cells have exhibited a power conversion efficiency exceeding 25%,1,2 thanks to their high absorption coefficient.3 Furthermore, due to the extraordinary carrier mobility,4 ABX3 materials have not only shown ultra-sensitivity to oxidative,5–9 reductive,10–15 or neutral gases,16–18 but also presented reasonable selectivity on targets with distinct chemical characteristics, such as NO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOC), e.g. acetone.7 More importantly, chemi-resistive gas sensors based on perovskite materials can work at room temperature, differing from those employing metal oxides, whose oxidation–reduction processes must be activated at high temperatures. At present, there are two important problems impairing the application of perovskite materials in the gas-sensing field: one is that the stability of the materials needs to be improved and the other is that gas-sensing mechanisms thereof remain unclear.
Our previous studies show that gases with different properties can damage the structure of perovskite materials, so that the service life of such devices is limited. The main mechanism underpinning this is that gases attack and break Pb–I bonds, thus damaging the inorganic skeleton. It has demonstrated that the stability of perovskite materials can be enhanced by replacing Pb–I bonds with stronger Pb–SCN or Pb–Br bonds19 or replacing organic groups with inorganic Cs+.19,20 At present, chemi-resistive gas sensors based on CsPbBr3 have been used to detect gases, such as NO2, O2, O3 or VOC acetone and ethanol21–24 and have shown good selectivity, sensitivity and stability; however, as the gas-sensing mechanisms remain unclear, ways to improve the selectivity and sensitivity are still ambiguous.
Researchers have proposed various sensing mechanisms for perovskite materials when detecting gases with different properties: in an O3-detecting experiment, Brintakis et al.23 considered that the electron transfer from the surface of CsPbBr3 to O3 results in sensing characteristics, which is consistent with the simulations of O3 adsorption by CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2.25,26 For CH3NH3PbI3−xClx based O3 sensing, a passivation mechanism whereby O3 molecules can passivate the vacancies of Pb2+ to enhance electron transfer and lessen the carrier recombination has been suggested by Kakavelakis et al..6 Similarly, other oxidizing gases, such as O2 and NO2, also exhibit similar charge transfer characteristics. Stoeckel et al.5 proposed the filling mechanism of O2 molecule mediated iodine vacancies and thus the chemical resistance of the sensing materials in an O2 atmosphere reduces. Jiao et al.13 and Ruan et al.27 believe that electrons transferred from NH3 to CH3NH3+ during the adsorption by CH3NH3PbX3, which increases the concentration of charge carriers and conductivity of the semiconductor. Our simulations demonstrate that proton exchange takes place between NH3 and CH3NH3+ in CH3NH3PbI3, while the reason for charge flow from NH3 to semiconductor materials is that NH3 finally attacks metal ions and forms stable Pb–N interactions.26 In addition, different perovskite materials have also been compared with regard to their adsorption ability for gas molecules. However, these models all fail to explain the fundamental selectivity and sensitivity of perovskite materials. For example, it is found that the adsorption ability of CH3NH3PbI3 for NH3 is much stronger than that for O2 and even greater than superoxidative O3 that can directly degrade perovskite materials.26
Based on the theory by Yamazoe et al.,28 to calibrate a target gas and its active sites is the initial move in the semiconductor gas-sensing process, and then the target gas functions through electronic variations introduced by gas–solid interactions. Our previous results25,26 showed that the structural instability of perovskite materials causes different dynamic changes around the adsorption sites. Such a property challenges the traditional static first-principles calculations,29–36 and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) are, therefore, used to deal with such special properties.25,26,37–42
Therefore, in this study, to explore the sensitivity and selectivity mechanisms of perovskite materials for gases with different properties, inorganic CsPbBr3 with good stability was taken as the adsorbing material. Moreover, the strong reductive NH3, neutral H2O, strong oxidizing O2 and NO2, and extremely oxidizing O3 were selected as adsorption objects for large-scale quantum dynamics simulations. The adsorption characteristics of gases with different properties on the surface of CsPbBr3 were systematically investigated by comparing with the results obtained by the previous simulation systems. This research demonstrates for the first time the influence of adsorption on the material structure and calculate the adsorption energy of different gases and the charge transfer between different gases and semiconductor materials. Then, the correlation between the oxidation–reduction states of central metal ions and the adsorption energy of the perovskite material–gas molecules and the relationship between the adsorption characteristics of gases with different properties and charge transfer were both discussed in detail. Furthermore, the influences of the oxidation–reduction properties of central metal ions on the adsorption ability and characteristics of perovskite materials were evaluated. Finally, the trade-off between the perovskite stability and the sensitivity and selectivity for gases with different oxidation–reduction abilities was evaluated. These are expected to provide fundamental ideas for the development of stable sensing materials with high sensitivity based on perovskites.
2. Computational methodology
The CsPbBr3 bulk crystal structure43 was cut into 2 × 2 slabs for five gas–solid adsorption systems. The CsPbBr3(001) surface was considered as the gas exposed surface.44,45 To balance the accuracy of the simulations and the physical time spent, a 5 Å vacuum region along the c-direction was filled with 23H2O, 18NH3, 16O2, 13NO2 and 15O3 molecules, respectively, as seen in Fig. 1. The reliability of the vacuum region settings has been confirmed by both theoretical25,26,38 and experimental5,7,10 results. The cell lattice parameters of a = 12.059, b = 11.808, and c = 16.934 Å for the perovskite surface–gas molecule interaction structures were used, and thus the total atoms for CsPbBr3–23H2O, CsPbBr3–18NH3, CsPbBr3–16O2, CsPbBr3–13NO2 and CsPbBr3–15O3 complexes were 117, 120, 80, 87 and 93, respectively.
 Fig. 1  The starting structures of (a) CsPbBr3–23H2O, (b) CsPbBr3–18NH3, (c) CsPbBr3–16O2, (d) CsPbBr3–13NO2 and (e) CsPbBr3–15O3, respectively. 
All the AIMD simulations were carried out using the Car–Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) module in the Quantum-Espresso package.46 The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional47 together with ultrasoft scalar relativistic pseudo-potentials48 was employed for the systems. The simulations were all executed using a Nose–Hoover thermostat49 at 300 K. The integration time is 5 a.u. and the total simulation time is 180 ps for each system. Plane-wave basis set cut-offs for the smooth part of the wave functions and the augmented density were set to 25 and 200 Ry, respectively. A 400 a.u. fictitious electronic mass was used.
To quantitatively show the structural changes during dynamics processes, 35 snapshots for each perovskite–gas molecule complex were extracted at 5 ps increment along the 180 ps simulations, the adsorption energy and charge transfer of the snapshots were calculated. The periodic electronic structure calculations were performed with the projected augmented wave (PAW) plane-wave basis,50,51 along with the PBE functional.47 The cut-off of the plane-wave basis set was 500 eV and a tolerance of 10−4 eV was employed for electronic minimizations. A Monkhorst-Pack k-point grid of 3 × 3 × 1 was set for the convergence of the energies and forces of the five solid–gas adsorption systems. The effect of spin–orbit coupling (SOC)52,53 for Pb was considered in the current work. The nonlocal van der Waals (VDW) interactions were computed using the Grimmer's DFT-D3 correction,54 in order to study the interaction between CsPbBr3 and gas molecules. To describe accurately the changes in the structures and the electronic states of the gas molecules adsorbed on the perovskite surfaces, the coordinates of the atoms in the snapshots were not optimized. The adsorption energy (Ead) was calculated as follows (eqn (1)): Ead = Eperovskite+gas − Eperovskite − Egas(1)where Ead, Eperovskite+gas, Eperovskite, and Egas are the adsorption energy of the whole complex, the total structural energy of perovskite and gas, the total perovskite structural energy, and the structure of gas, respectively.
To quantitatively compare the adsorption energies among different systems, the value of the average adsorption energy (Ead) was calculated using eqn (2): (2)where Ead, Eavgad and N are the adsorption energy of the complex, the average adsorption energy of the system, and the total number of gas molecules, respectively.
The charge transfer between the semiconductor and the gas molecules was evaluated by Bader charge population analyses.55,56 The net charge transfer ΔQ was calculated as: ΔQX = QT=180X − Qt=5X(3)where X represents Pb2+, Cs+, Br−, or gas, respectively. T equals 180 ps, and t equals 5 ps.
The average charge transfer values between the perovskite and gas molecules were computed using eqn (4): (4)where ΔQX, ΔQavgX, and N correspond to the total charge transfer of the system, the average charge transfer of the system, and the total number of gas molecules, respectively.
3. Results and discussion
The root mean square deviations (RMSDs) of the five complexes are shown in Fig. 2. The RMSD curve systems tend to be stable at 90 ps (H2O), 130 ps (NH3), 100 ps (NO2), 100 ps (O2) and 120 ps (O3), respectively, indicating that the adsorption of the gas molecules on the perovskite skeletons reaches equilibrium. It takes different time spans for the RMSD curves of the three systems to obtain equilibrium and the fluctuations of which are distinct as well, which might suggest that the gases with various chemical properties exhibit different adsorption behaviours.

3.1 Stability improvement of CsPbBr3 in a humid environment
Firstly, the simulations show that the moisture resistance of CsPbBr3 is significantly improved. Our previous simulations and many experiments22,25,57–59 demonstrate that the weak Pb–I bonds are easily broken under attack from gas molecules, which is deemed the reason for the instability of perovskites. In this study, the integrity ratio is still used to describe the ratio of bond breakage in dynamics simulations,20 that is, Pb–I and Pb–Br connections are respectively considered as broken when their bond lengths exceed 3.400 Å and 3.250 Å during the simulations. For example, there are 48 Pb–Br bonds in the initial CsPbBr3 structure, and at the end of the simulations, the bond length of 34 connections remains shorter than 3.25 Å, and the integrity ratio of Pb–Br bonds is 34/48 (i.e. 70.833%). During the same simulation period, the integrity ratio of Pb–I bonds in the CH3NH3PbI3–H2O system26 is 66.667% (32/48) (Table 1). For the (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2–H2O complex, in which Pb–I bonds are partially replaced with Pb–SCN,25 the stability of the skeleton is improved due to the formation of the Pb–SCN–Pb network in the humid environment and the integrity ratio of Pb–I bonds is 68.750% (22/32). In this research, replacing Pb–I bonds with Pb–Br bonds further improves the stability of the skeleton. In addition, by observing the RMSD fluctuations in Fig. 2, the curves of Pb and Br atoms in the CsPbBr3 system rapidly reach equilibrium after rising in the initial stage. Moreover, at the end of the simulations, the increase in amplitude is much smaller than that of Pb and I atoms in the CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 systems.25,26 This also indicates that the Pb–Br bonds are less active than Pb–I bonds, so the skeleton is more stable.

In the CsPbBr3 systems, the central metal ion Pb remains the active site of H2O and the Pb–Br bonds are still partially broken under attack by H2O molecules. H2O attacks Pb to form a Pb–OH2 interaction and the dynamic fluctuations in the distance between Pb2–O8 and Pb2–O23 are shown in Fig. 3. In the simulations, these distances are always slightly larger than the standard Pb–O bond length (2.490 Å),60 which implies that the connection is weaker than the actual Pb–O bond. Furthermore, CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 are respectively found to release reactants CH3NH3I25,61 and CH3NH3SCN19,25 in a humid environment; however, the release of reactants has never been observed in the CsPbBr3 system, indicating the enhancement of the structural stability by Pb–Br bonds.
 Fig. 3  Fluctuations of distances between the dynamic fluctuations in distances of Pb2–O8 to Pb2–O23. 
Furthermore, by observing fluctuations of the A site cations (Fig. 2 and Fig. S1, ESI†), it can be found that the RMSD curve of Cs+ ions rapidly reaches a stable state and the increase is much smaller than the amplitude of fluctuations of MA groups in CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2. This indicates that the fluctuation of spherical Cs+ ions is much smaller than that of stick-like MA groups, which contributes to the improvement of the stability of the [PbI6]4− skeleton.19,20 Therefore, the comparison of the structural changes of CH3NH3PbI3, (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2, and CsPbBr3 in a humid environment shows that the all-inorganic structures can still maintain a more complete octahedral skeleton at the end of the 180 ps simulations (Fig. 4).

3.2 Stability enhancement of CsPbBr3 in a reductive NH3 atmosphere
The simulations demonstrate that NH3 can rapidly attack Pb on the surface of CsPbBr3 due to the loss of shielding effects of CH3NH3+ on NH3,26 which is the most obvious difference from the CH3NH3PbI3–NH3 system. Compared with the fact that gases cannot interact with Pb2+ until 150 ps in the CH3NH3PbI3–NH3 system, NH3 molecules attack Pb2+ at 6 ps to form Pb8–N6 connection in the CsPbBr3–NH3 complex (Fig. 5a). Thereafter, Pb7–N1, Pb4–N14, and Pb4–N4 connections are successively formed. These connections are shorter than the standard Pb–N bond length of 2.910 Å at most times after their formation (Fig. 6a),62 indicating very stable interactions. Many of these strong Pb–NH3 interactions are found to form rapidly and completely break the Pb8–Br13–Pb5 and Pb7–Br14–Pb6 connections in the x-direction of the CsPbBr3 skeleton (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, new connections Pb5–Br13–Pb1 and Pb6–Br14–Pb3 are established at 14 ps (Fig. 5c) and are found to be stable until the end of the simulations (Fig. 6b). This kind of reorganization results in a transformation of the corner-sharing [PbBr6]4− octahedrons to the local edge-sharing topology as seen in Fig. 5d, which presents a hybrid 2-d/3-d hybrid structure.25 Such a phenomenon is not observed in the CH3NH3PbI3–NH3 system. Although such structural recombination changes the connection form of the octahedrons, it does not break Pb–Br bonds, so the integrity ratio of Pb–Br bonds in the system remains 70.833% (34/48). However, at the end of the simulations, the integrity ratio of Pb–I bonds in CH3NH3PbI3–NH3 is 58.333% (28/48). In addition, the release of reactant CH3NH3I is found at 5 ps in the CH3NH3PbI3–NH3 complex, but not in the current system. Pb–Br bonds are shown to be more stable, and Br− is rarely released despite the reorganized connections.

 Fig. 6  Fluctuations of the Pb–NH3 (a) and Pb–Br (b) connections during the simulations. 
In conclusion, under similar attack from NH3 on the Pb–X skeleton, the octahedral structure is eventually damaged in two different forms. In CH3NH3PbI3–NH3, the presence of CH3NH3+ slows the damage of the Pb–I skeleton by NH3 and then stable Pb–NH3 and Pb–NH2CH3 are formed: these then continue to rotate to the inside of the skeleton and further slowly damage more Pb–I bonds, finally releasing CH3NH3I from the system. Without the CH3NH3+ buffer layer in the CsPbBr3–NH3 system, more NH3 molecules can rapidly form stable Pb–NH3 and the damaged Pb–Br skeleton can continue to maintain its high integrity through local recombination of the octahedral structure (Fig. 5d).
3.3 Stability of CsPbBr3 in the environment with oxidative gases O2, NO2, and O3
Compared with the fact that the adsorption of H2O and NH3 on the surface of CsPbBr3 can form stable interactions, no stable connections have been found between O2 molecules and CsPbBr3 throughout the dynamics processes (Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the distances between all Pb and O atoms). In the CH3NH3PbI3–O2 system, although O2 is easily desorbed, there remains the Pb–O interactions, which can severely damage the skeleton of perovskite materials. After 180 ps in such simulations, the integrity ratio of Pb–I bonds is 54.167% (26/48). In this work, the integrity ratio of Pb–Br bonds in the CsPbBr3–O2 system reaches 72.917% (35/48) (Fig. 4c). In view of the above completely different adsorption states of O2 in the two systems, the mechanisms will be discussed in detail in the charge transfer section. In addition, the reactant CH3NH3I is released from the CH3NH3PbI3–O2 system due to the presence of free I−,26 while such a phenomenon has not been observed in the CsPbBr3 system.
In the CsPbBr3–NO2 complex, Pb–Br bonds also significantly improve the perovskite stability. As shown in Fig. 7, NO2 can lead to a rapid interaction between Pb4–O10 and Pb6–O13 (Fig. 7a and b) and the interatomic distance is slightly larger than the standard Pb–O bond length of 2.490 Å (Fig. 7c).60 This suggests that the adsorption of NO2 on the surface of CsPbBr3 is unstable and such an interaction does not severely damage the octahedral skeleton of CsPbBr3 until the end of the simulations (Fig. 4d). In (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2–NO2,25 although the formation of the Pb–SCN–Pb network enhances the structural stability, NO2 can still form stable Pb–O connections by damaging Pb–I bonds and attacking SCN−, resulting in the release of SCN− to form the reactant CH3NH3SCN. These phenomena show that the skeleton composed of Pb–SCN and Pb–I bonds is still not stable enough to resist oxidative NO2. At the end of the simulations, the integrity ratio of Pb–Br bonds in the CsPbBr3–NO2 system is 68.750% (33/48), while that of Pb–I bonds in the (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2–NO2 complex is 59.375% (19/32). It is evident that the structural damage to the latter is more severe than that to CsPbBr3.
 Fig. 7  The snapshot of the formation of Pb4–O10 (a), Pb6–O13 (b) and the fluctuations of the two connections during the dynamics process (c), respectively. 
In comparison with O2 and NO2, O3 is much more oxidizing: O3 can continuously and rapidly attack Pb2+ on the CsPbBr3 surface to form Pb–O connections to replace Pb–Br bonds (Fig. 8a). Free Br− can be observed at as early as 5 ps (Fig. 8b), which has not been observed in the four systems described previously. As shown in Fig. 8c, although O3 shows frequent attacking–bonding–debonding behaviors, O3 cannot enter the skeleton even at the end of the simulations, so the system can still maintain a relatively complete octahedral structure (Fig. 4e). The subsequent calculation of the charge transfer demonstrates that O3 molecules can obtain a large amount of charge from perovskite materials through these continuous and transient contacts. In the CH3NH3PbI3–O3 system,26 however, gas molecules enter, and completely damage the perovskite skeleton within a very short time. Pb–SCN bonds perform well in the improvement of stability under attack from O3; however, because of weak Pb–I bonds, the (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 system is still completely damaged after a relatively long time and some SCN− can even be oxidized into SO2.25 At the end of the simulations, the integrity ratio of Pb–Br bonds is 56.250% (27/48), while those of Pb–I bonds in the CH3NH3PbI3 and (CH3NH3)2Pb(SCN)2I2 systems are only 18.750% (9/48) and 21.875% (7/32), respectively.
 Fig. 8  The initial connection of Pb–O3 (a), the detection of a free Br− ion (b) and the highly active interactions between Pb and O3 during the simulations (c), respectively. 
In summary, for reductive, neutral, and oxidative gases, the Pb–Br bonds can improve the structural stability of perovskites compared with CH3NH3PbI3. As for extremely oxidizing O3, there is potential for improvement of the stability of the materials.
3.4 Adsorption ability and charge transfer of H2O, NH3, O2, NO2, and O3 on the CsPbBr3 surface
The charge transfer between semiconductor materials and gases is an important index affecting the conductivity of gas-sensing materials, so the charge transfer of all systems was calculated. The results are shown in Table 2 and Fig. 9, respectively. For the CsPbBr3–H2O system, H2O transfers 1.067 e to CsPbBr3 at the initial stage. In this case, the charges lost by Pb2+, Cs+, and H2O in the system separately are 5.947, 7.786, and 1.067 e, while Br− obtains charge (13.801 e). At the end of the simulations, the charge transferred to CsPbBr3 by H2O is 1.273 e. The charges lost by Pb2+, Cs+, and H2O in the system are 5.953, 7.784, and 1.273 e, respectively, while that obtained by Br− reaches 14.009 e. After the dynamics simulations, charge acceptors in CsPbBr3–H2O are Pb2+ and Br−, with obtained charges of 0.009 and 0.208 e, respectively. Cs+ and H2O are charge donors and lose 0.002 and 0.206 e, respectively. Similarly, in the CsPbBr3–NH3 complex, charge acceptors are Pb2+ (0.965 e) and Br− (0.592 e), while donors are Cs+ (0.078 e) and NH3 (0.648 e). In the CsPbBr3–O2 combination, Pb2+ (0.084 e), Cs+ (0.006 e), and O2 (0.158 e) function as charge acceptors, while Br− (0.236 e) is the donor. Moreover, in the CsPbBr3–NO2 system, Pb2+ (0.071 e) and NO2 (0.277 e) are regarded as charge acceptors, while the donors are Cs+ (0.105 e) and Br− (0.243 e). Cs+ (0.013 e) and O3 (0.923 e) are charge acceptors, while Pb2+ (0.233 e) and Br− (0.678 e) are donors in CsPbBr3–O3. Therefore, both the reductive NH3 (−0.036 e per molecule) and neutral H2O (−0.009 e per molecule) lose charges as they flow to the perovskite materials. The average charge transfer of the reductive gas is always greater than that of neutral gas. For the oxidizing gases O3 (0.062 e per molecule), NO2 (0.021 e per molecule), and O2 (0.010 e per molecule), they obtain charges from semiconductor materials and the number of charges obtained decreases in turn. Based on the aforementioned adsorption characteristics of gases on the surface of CsPbBr3, the distribution of the electronic density of states (DOS) in snapshots upon stable adsorption of various gases was calculated (Fig. S4, ESI†). The charge transfer channels in the systems are revealed by the orbital overlaps between the gas molecules and central metal ions under stable adsorption.

 Fig. 9  The total charge transfer (a) and averaged charge transfer over the number of the gas molecules (b) in each system. 
The adsorption ability of gases on the surface of CsPbBr3 was quantitatively described. As the data pertaining to adsorption energy in Table 3 and Fig. 10 indicate, the reductive NH3 shows the strongest adsorption ability (−2.950 eV per molecule) on the CsPbBr3 surface, followed by the neutral H2O (−2.050 eV per molecule), whereas the adsorption abilities of oxidizing gases O3 (−1.296 eV per molecule), O2 (−0.231 eV per molecule), and NO2 (−0.351 eV per molecule) are generally weaker than those of the first two types of gases. By combining these data with the above analysis on adsorption stability, due to the extreme oxidizing property, O3 molecules can form an unstable interaction with Pb–O3 (Fig. 8c); however, NO2 only makes very short-term contact with Pb2+ (Fig. 7c), so the adsorption energy thereof is weaker than that of O3, but stronger than that of O2 that cannot be adsorbed on the perovskite surface at all (Fig. 3).

 Fig. 10  The adsorption energy (a) and the averaged adsorption energy over the number of the gas molecules (b) in each system. 
Based on the above results, among the five gases, O2 can neither form stable adsorption nor effective conduct charge transfer. Therefore, the mechanisms show that CsPbBr3 is less sensitive to and selective for O2 in the detection than the other gases. Such a speculation has been confirmed by experiments. In the gas-sensing experiments performed by Chen et al.21 and Kim et al.,24 CsPbBr3 is not sensitive to O2 while being highly sensitive to O3 and NO2, thus verifying the reliability of the theoretical model.
3.5 Understanding the sensitivity mechanisms of the perovskite systems for gases with different properties from the perspective of central metal ions oxidation states
This research and previous simulations25,26 showed that Pb2+ is the main active site for gas attack. To find the origin of the adsorption characteristics of CsPbBr3 for gases with different properties, the oxidation–reduction properties of Pb were systematically analysed in the dynamics processes. The valence of Pb in perovskite materials is +2, showing both oxidizability and reducibility. To more systematically investigate the oxidation or reduction properties of Pb, CsPbI3 is taken as a reference structure for calculating the charge distribution, although it is not the research object of this study. Based on the data in Table 4, because Br is more oxidative than I, it has stronger electron-withdrawing ability when forming the Pb–X skeleton. Therefore, the initial charge of 4 e outside the Pb nucleus finally becomes 3.340 e after forming CsPbBr3 and the total charge lost by eight metal atoms is 5.276 e. In comparison with the CsPbI3 system, the total charge lost by eight Pb atoms is 4.490 e, which is less than that when bonding with Br, indicating that Pb in the CsPbBr3 system is more oxidative than that in CsPbI3. Therefore, in the detection of gases with different properties, Pb has the strongest adsorption for the reductive gas, the weakest adsorption ability for the oxidative gas, and moderate adsorption ability for the neutral gas. The above data pertaining to the adsorption energy perfectly accord with this oxidation–reduction adsorption law. Even for extremely oxidizing O3, its adsorption energy is only equivalent to the neutral H2O, but weaker than that of the reducing NH3. In addition, this is verified by the adsorption systems of CH3NH3PbI3 for NH3 and O2, namely the adsorption ability of perovskite materials for NH3 is much greater than that for O2.26 In recent research, Parfenov et al.63 found that CH(NH2)2PbCl3 (FAPbCl3) prepared with more oxidizing chlorine as the X-site element showed excellent detection performance on NH3 and the detection concentration was as low as 50 ppb. This further verifies the detection sensitivity of Pb to the reductive gas due to its oxidizability. More stable Pb–Cl bonds are also bound to improve the stability of the device. Based on the sensitivity mechanisms proposed in this study, it is predicted that FAPbCl3 materials are highly sensitive to humidity and their stability can be greatly improved.

4. Conclusions
The adsorption processes of NH3, H2O, O2, NO2, and O3 on the surface of CsPbBr3 were systematically studied and compared with the existing studies. The simulations show that the stable Pb–Br can improve the stability of the CsPbBr3 skeleton during the adsorption of gases with different properties. At the end of the dynamics simulations, the structural integrities of the five systems are improved compared with CH3NH3PbI3. Secondly, due to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of Br than I, Pb connected to Br has a higher oxidation state. Therefore, CsPbBr3 has the strongest adsorption ability for the reductive NH3, followed by the neutral H2O. The adsorption abilities of the oxidative O3, NO2, and O2 are weaker than the first two.
Based on the above simulation results and with the support of the existing experimental data, it is found that there is a trade-off between the stability of perovskite materials and detection sensitivity and selectivity. Halogens or pseudo-halogens with strong electron-withdrawing ability can form stable interactions with Pb. The improvement of bond energy is conducive to increasing the overall stability of perovskite materials, which can ensure good stability in the detection of strong reductive or oxidative gases. While improving the stability, the oxidation state of central metal ions is enhanced, which can reduce the sensitivity and selectivity of perovskite materials for oxidative gases and is more favorable for the detection of reductive and neutral gases. For weak oxidizing gases, perovskite materials exhibit both ideal sensitivity and stability at the same time.
