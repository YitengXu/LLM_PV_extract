    , Accepted 23rd June 2022First published on 6th July 2022AbstractLithium–sulfur batteries (LSB) are regarded as one of the next-generation energy storage systems with a high energy density. However, the shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) and irreversible consumption of the Li anode prevent the practical application of Li–S batteries. In this work, a mixed tetrahydrofuran (THF) and dipropyl ether (DPE) based electrolyte has been optimized for Li–S batteries. Due to the common-ion effect, the LiPS solubility has been significantly inhibited when the sulfur cathode is operating in a concentrated electrolyte containing an optimized solvent system with weak dissolving power. And no self-discharge effect occurred in the cells with these electrolytes during a 10 day storage. Besides, the coulombic efficiency (CE) for Li deposition/stripping has been improved by optimizing the ratio of dual lithium salts. Impressively, Li‖Cu half-cells can run stably for more than 500 cycles with a high CE (>99.3%). For these reasons, a Li–SeSPAN cell with a L1L2TE-1382 electrolyte demonstrates an excellent capacity retention (>94% after 500 cycles) with an ultrathin (50 μm) Li metal anode. With a good compatibility of the optimized electrolyte for both the Li metal anode and sulfur cathode, this work provides a new design strategy for the electrolyte for lithium–sulfur batteries.
1. Introduction
The development of clean energy technologies, for example, thermal power, hydroelectric power, nuclear energy, solar power, and wind power, is imperative for the survival and sustainable development of human society. For the utilization of these clean energy resources, advanced energy storage devices play a key role for applications in portable electronic devices and electric vehicles in this power-demanding world. Among various advanced energy storage devices, metal–sulfur batteries, including Li–S, Na–S and Mg–S batteries, are especially attractive due to their high specific energy. With a high theoretical energy density of about 2500 W h kg−1, lithium–sulfur batteies (LSBs) have been considered as one of the most promising candidates of next generation rechargeable devices.1
In a traditional lithium–sulfur battery, soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) would form during sulfur cathode cycling in ether-based electrolytes, and they tend to dissolve in these electrolytes and react with the Li anode, which leads to low coulombic efficiency (CE) and rapid loss of active materials.2,3 To make matters worse, the low CE of lithium plating/stripping caused by dendrite lithium and dead lithium restricts the commercialization of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) using conventional ether-based electrolytes.4 The formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) by carefully regulating lithium salts and solvents is an important solution to handle these problems.5–7 In order to restrain the LiPS dissolution, many studies have developed high concentration electrolytes (HCEs) and localized high concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) with limited ether solvents for LSBs.8,9 However, the highly concentrated lithium salts and excessive fluorinated ethers result in lower conductivity and high cost.10 Wei et al. proposed a “solid–solid” conversion mechanism during discharge and charge processes, which is an effective strategy to avoid the shuttle effect and high reversibility during cycling.11 Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN), reported by Wang and co-workers in 2002, has been proposed as a promising cathode for LSBs,12 in which active sulfur is covalently bonded to the pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile (PAN) chains. Recently, Xie et al. optimized the structure of SPAN by doping selenium (SeSPAN).13,14 In general, SPAN and SeSPAN cathodes have been proved to work well in carbonate ester-based electrolytes with minimal LiPS dissolution and nearly 100% coulombic efficiency. However, compared with ether solvents, carbonate-based electrolytes are even less compatible with a Li anode, and cannot be employed in LSBs for practical application.15
Since the solubility of LiPS and the reactivity with lithium metal can be inhibited by low-polar ether solvents with a high C/O ratio, methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), dipropyl ether (DPE) and dibutyl ether (DBE) have been prudently selected as low-polarity solvents in electrolytes for LSBs.16,17 Chen et al. mixed DOL–DME (1,3-dioxolane and 1,2-dimethoxyethane) with DIPE or MTBE to give a limited solubility for LiPS and suitable conductivity for the electrolyte.18 The mixed-DIPE electrolyte also has an improved compatibility with the lithium anode, resulting in significantly improved cycling stability. Zhou et al. introduced a 4 M lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) electrolyte with a DBE solvent for LSBs. Despite having sufficient solubility of lithium salts, this pure ether-based electrolyte delivers a low Li+ ionic conductivity.19 Both lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide (LiTFSI) and LiFSI salts are common lithium salts used in lithium–sulfur batteries. Compared with LiTFSI, LiFSI salt has enhanced ionic conductivity and abundant labile fluorine, which can participate in forming a more robust and stable solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) on the Li anode.20–23 Unfortunately, the solubility of LiFSI is very limited in the DOL solvent.24 Therefore, a new mixed-solvent system needs to be developed for LSB electrolytes.
In order to achieve the purpose of eliminating the shuttle effect and parasitic reaction on the Li anode, we have designed herein a novel THF–DPE based dual-salt electrolyte for Li–S cells with a limited lithium anode (lithium foil with a thickness of 50 μm). Unlike the DME–DOL solvent system, the THF–DPE system delivers a better performance, including low volatility, a high Li+ transference number and good compatibility with electrodes. In detail, with a high CE of Li deposition/stripping (99.3%), stable cycling for more than 500 cycles was achieved in Li‖Cu cells with the L1L2TE-1382 electrolyte. And the life span of Li–SeSPAN cells with these optimized electrolytes are prolonged to 500 cycles with a high retention of capacity (>90%). Furthermore, dense morphology and low resistance of cycled Li metal anodes were identified as advantages of the higher ratio of LiFSI in electrolytes for Li anode protection.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Li metal (φ 16 mm, 600 μm, China Energy Lithium Co., Ltd., China), lithium–copper composite tape (Li, 50 μm, China Energy Lithium Co., Ltd., China), Cu foil (100 μm, Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd., China), Al foil (15 μm, Nippon Light Metal Co., Ltd., Japan), a separator (2325, Celgard, USA). lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfon)imide (LiTFSI, 99.95%), 1,3-dioxolane (DOL, 99.8%, with 75 ppm BHT inhibitor), 1,2-dimethoxyethane (DME, 99.5%), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN, average Mw ∼ 150000, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., USA. Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI, 99.9%) was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd., Japan. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, anhydrous, 99.9%) was obtained from Innochem Co., Ltd., China. Dipropyl ether (DPE, 98%), elemental sulfur (S8, 99.8%), selenium (Se powder, 99.99%), ethanol (spectral purity, 99.8%), and propanol (99.5%) were purchased from Aladdin, Inc., China. All the solvents used for electrolytes were stored with 4 Å molecular sieves in an argon glove box before use. Conductive carbon was acetylene black (Denka Black Li 250, Lion Chemical Co., Ltd., Japan), and the LA132 binder (solid content ∼ 15%) was purchased from Indigo Technology Co., Ltd., China. RO-pure water was self-made through a water purifier (Smart-N UV, Heal Force).
2.2 SeSPAN electrode preparation
Before preparing the cathode, sulfur, selenium and polyacrylonitrile powders were ball-milled at a weight ratio of 15:1:3 with ethanol used as the dispersant. The resulting mixture was dried at 60 °C for 6 h and then heated to 350 °C for 6 h in a nitrogen atmosphere to obtain the SeSPAN composite with a sulfur content of 41.8% (Table S1, ESI†). The sulfur content was determined by elemental analysis (Vario EL cube, Elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Germany). The SeSPAN cathode slurry was prepared by mixing SeSPAN, acetylene black, and an LA132 binder at a weight ratio of 7:2:1, which was then spread on Al foil. After the evaporation of the solvents in a vacuum oven at 60 °C for 12 h, the cathode coating pasted on Al foil was rolled to 30 μm thickness. The areal loading of sulfur in the as-fabricated cathode is about 2.0 mg cm−2 in all cases.
2.3 Electrolyte preparation
All electrolytes were prepared in an argon-filled dry glove box (H2O < 0.01 ppm, O2 < 0.01 ppm). First, LiTFSI and LiFSI were mixed with different molar ratios and dissolved in THF and then stirred for 30 min. A specified amount of DPE was added to the above solutions and stirred for 6 h at room temperature and the total concentration of salts was about 2.5 M. Different solutions, including 1 M LiTFSI/DME–DOL (LDD) and two THF–DPE based LiTFSI solutions with different THF–DPE molar ratios, namely LTE-4X0 (LiTFSI:THF:DPE = 4:10:0) and LTE-482 (LiTFSI:THF:DPE = 4:8:2) have been prepared. These solutions were stirred with stoichiometric amounts of lithium sulfide (Li2S) and sulfur (S8) for 24 h to form saturated Li2S6 solution and were then stored for 7 days at room temperature.
2.4 Battery fabrication
In an argon glove box, 2025 type and 2016 type coin cells were fabricated using a Celgard 2325 separator. The coulombic efficiency of plating/stripping performance of lithium was examined by using Cu‖Li coin cells (CR2016) with 20 μL electrolyte. The electrochemical window of electrolytes was examined by using Li‖steel coin cells (CR2016) with 20 μL electrolyte. The galvanostatic cycling performance of Li deposition–dissolution was tested by using Li‖Li symmetric cells (CR2025) with 30 μL electrolyte. The Li–SeSPAN cells were assembled by using CR2016 coin cells with 20 μL electrolyte.
2.5 Electrochemical measurements
The electrochemical window of these electrolytes was examined by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) using an electrochemical workstation (IVIUMSTAT, Netherlands) with Li‖steel coin cells. In order to investigate the CE of plating/stripping of lithium, the constant current density for the Li‖Cu cells was set to 0.5 mA cm−2. During each cycle, 1 mA h cm−2 of Li metal was deposited on the Cu substrate and then stripped until the potential reached 1.0 V vs. Li/Li+. The current density of Li‖Li symmetric cells was 1 mA cm−2 with a charge amount of 1 mA h cm−2 for each cycle. The discharge and charge measurements for Li‖Cu cells, Li‖Li cells and full cells were carried out on a NEWARE Battery Test System (Shenzhen, China). The current rate was calculated based on the theoretical capacity of SeSPAN and the specific discharge/charge capacities were based on the SeSPAN weight. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was obtained on an electrochemical workstation (IVIUMSTAT, Netherlands) in a frequency range from 100 kHz to 0.1 Hz with an excitation potential amplitude of 5 mV.
2.6 Electrode characterization
The morphologies of lithium anodes were investigated by using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, FESEM Phenom LE). The composition of these anode surfaces was investigated by using an X-ray photo electron spectroscopy spectrometer (XPS, ESCALAB250Xi, Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with a monochromatic Al Kα source (1486.6 eV). The Li–SeSPAN cells were dissembled in a glove box and the electrodes were thoroughly washed three times with anhydrous THF to remove the residual electrolyte.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Physicochemical properties of electrolytes
As the solvent serves as a lithium ionic conductor for mass transport, the properties of solvents and their dosage play an important role in electrolyte. The key characteristics of electrolyte solvents for the LSB are that they should have limited LiPS solubility and low reactivity with metallic lithium. Both DME and THF, having the same Gutmann donor number (DN = 20) and equivalent dielectric constants, are widely used in ether-based electrolytes to provide enough conductivity as needed. Unlike a bidentate ligand (such as DME), THF is a monodentate ligand solvent possessing a lower solvating power for lithium salts and LiPSs. As a weak solvent, inert DPE acted more as a diluent added in electrolyte to reduce the viscosity and inhibit the dissolution of LiPSs. However, excessive introduction of DPE in HCE would result in immiscibility of the solution. The digital photos of the solutions (LDD, LTE-4X0 (X = 10) and LTE-482) with saturated Li2S6 are shown in Fig. 1a. Owing to the high solubility of Li2S6 in LDD electrolyte, the color of the upper fluid turned to a red-brown color immediately and became opaque in 2 min during stirring. In contrast, with a relatively higher salt concentration (about 2.5 M) and weak coordination ability of THF, the dissolution of Li2S6 in the LTE-4X0 solution has been significantly inhibited (the light-yellow solution in the center bottle). More importantly, by replacing part of THF solvent with DPE, the color of LTE-482 solution (Li2S6 in LTE-482) is obviously lighter than that of the LTE-4X0 solution, which indicates that the dissolution of LiPSs is suppressed significantly by the common ion effect.25 Therefore, the dual-ether system containing THF and DPE (with a molar ratio of 4:1) was selected as a mixed solvent for the optimized electrolytes. The formulations and names of the electrolytes have been given in Table S2 (ESI†), and the conventional electrolyte is 1 M LiTFSI in DME/DOL (v/v = 1:1), which is labeled “LDD” in the present study.

(c) Conductivity and Li+ migration number of L1L2TE electrolytes L1L2TE-4082 and (d) volatility test for 1 M LiTFSI/DME–DOL and L1L2TE-1382 electrolytes. 
The electrochemical window of these electrolytes was investigated by the linear potential sweep method. As shown in Fig. 1b, the onset of oxidation of the electrolytes shifts from 4.1 V to 4.6 V when the molar ratio of LiFSI/LiTFSI increases. Although THF was found to breakdown at a voltage above 4 V vs. Li/Li+, the medium-concentration Li salt with a large molar ratio of LiFSI/LiTFSI can help improve the electrochemical stability of THF.26 These electrolytes are adequate for the Li–SeSPAN battery with an operating voltage of 1–3 V. The conductivity and lithium-ion transference number are two important parameters to characterize the ion transport performance in electrolyte. Fig. 1c shows the influence of salts on the conductivity and the Li+ migration number. With the increase of LiFSI, the conductivity of electrolyte has increased from 1.05 mS cm−1 (L1L2TE-4082) to 3.99 mS cm−1 (L1L2TE-1382), which explains the cells delivering a higher capacity at high rates when using L1L2TE-1382 electrolyte. Due to the high lithium concentration and the small molecule solvents, the Li+ migration number of the series electrolyte is maintained at about 0.8. Because of traditional ether-based solvents having low boiling and flash points, the battery containing these ether-based electrolytes would face great risks when they are operating in hot environments. In the volatility test of these electrolyte, 1 M LiTFSI/DME–DOL (LDD) lost about 30% of its mass in 5 minutes and 50% in 30 minutes at 25 °C (Fig. 1d). In contrast, thanks to a higher concentration of Li salts, the L1L2TE electrolyte lost only 10% of its mass in 30 minutes, which exhibits less volatility even when containing more volatile solvents.
3.2 Lithium plating/stripping cycling CE and stability
In order to assess the lithium plating/stripping behavior in these electrolytes, the galvanostatic cycling experiments were conducted in Li‖Cu half-cells with an areal capacity of 1 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 0.5 mA cm−2. With the LDD electrolyte, the Li‖Cu half-cells exhibited an unstable coulombic efficiency (CE), which increased from 77% to 98% within 50 cycles and then dropped rapidly to 40% in 100 cycles (Fig. 2a and S1a, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 2b–d, by increasing the molar ratio of LiFSI/LiTFSI, the CE of the first cycle has improved from 91% to 95% with a polarization voltage dropping from 0.039 V to 0.028 V. The CE of lithium plating/stripping in dual-salt electrolytes has increased to 99.3% after 10 cycles and is maintained over 500 cycles (2000 h). It is worth noting that the polarization voltage of the L1L2TE-1382 half-cell is very stable and lower than 40 mV even at the 500th cycle. The Li‖Cu half-cells using single-salt electrolytes (L1L2TE-4082 and L1L2TE-0482, Fig. 2e and f) exhibited a reduced CE after 100 cycles, which indicates that single-salt electrolytes cannot effectively prevent the side-reactions on a metallic lithium electrode. The long-term cycling stability of a Li anode was further examined in symmetrical cells with an areal capacity of 1 mA h cm−2 at a current density of 1 mA cm−2 (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The cells with the L1L2TE-3182 and L1L2TE-2282 electrolytes experienced a short circuit after a brief increase of the polarization voltage around 500 and 600 cycles respectively. More importantly, the symmetrical cell in L1L2TE-1382 electrolyte initially displayed the lowest overpotential of 40 mV and delivered a remarkable lifespan of more than 1000 cycles (2000 h) with a stable voltage of about 60 mV. These results demonstrate that the optimized LiTFSI–LiFSI/THF–DPE (L1L2TE-1382) is more compatible with the lithium anode, and effectively suppresses excessive consumption of the electrolyte.

In order to investigate the enhanced CE of the Li plating/stripping mechanism and stable cycling performance of Li‖Li symmetry cells in L1L2TE-4082/1382 electrolytes, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis (XPS) with an Ar+ etching technique was performed to analyze the SEI layer on the Li anode formed in the L1L2TE-4082 and L1L2TE-1382 electrolytes. Fig. 3 presents the atomic concentrations for different elements along with the etching time. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the lithium anodes cycled in L1L2TE-4082/1382 show different morphologies. A more smooth and dense passivation layer was formed on the lithium anode cycled in L1L2TE-1382 electrolyte containing LiFSI.

High-resolution spectra of (c) Li 1s XPS, (d) O 2s XPS and (e) F 2s XPS for the metallic lithium surface in LLTE-4082 and LLTE-1382 electrolytes. 
Compared with the SEI formed in L1L2TE-4082, the chemical composition of the SEI layer formed in the LLTE-1382 electrolytes maintains a higher atomic concentration of O and S elements. The high-resolution Li 1s XPS spectra for L1L2TE-4082 and L1L2TE-1382D in Fig. 3c show a negative shift of the peak position with the etching time increasing from 0 to 600 s, which can be attributed to the sequential appearance of metallic lithium at around 53 eV along with the increased etching depth. More importantly, it can be clearly observed that the content of Li–O bonds (55.0 eV) in the SEI layer formed in L1L2TE-1382 is significantly lower than that in the L1L2TE-4082 electrolyte. Combined with the analysis of the O 2s XPS spectra in Fig. 3d, the O–S bond is the main type for element O in the SEI layer formed in L1L2TE-4082 and has a higher proportion in L1L2TE-1382 electrolyte. As shown in Fig. 3e, a main peak around 685 eV can be found for both L1L2TE electrolytes, suggesting that the F element in the SEI layer only exists in the LiF phase. In addition, the XPS peak at around 688 eV (Fig. 3e) for the SEI formed in L1L2TE-4082 electrolyte was assigned to F–C bonds and is mainly due to the LiTFSI salt. These results indicated that a dual-salt electrolyte (such as L1L2TE-1382) have enhanced passivation capability compared with pure-LiTFSI electrolyte systems and can promote more lithium sulfate to participate in the formation of an SEI layer with LiF components, resulting in a more dense and stable passivation layer which can significantly suppress the parasitic reaction between the electrolyte and metallic lithium anode.
3.3 Electrochemical performances of Li–SeSPAN cells
The electrochemical performances of Li–SeSPAN cells with different electrolytes (LDD and L1L2TE-3182/2282/1382) were also investigated for comparison. The preparation process of the SeSPAN electrode is given in the ESI.† As shown in Fig. 4a, all these cells have gone through the first discharge at 0.05 A g−1 (0.075C rate) and five formation cycles at 0.1 A g−1 (0.15C rate) before long-time cycling (0.2 A g−1, about 0.3C). Because the shuttle effect occurs in the charge process, the charge capacity in LDD electrolyte is obviously higher than the discharge capacity (Fig. S2a, ESI†). And the specific capacity of the LDD cell dropped rapidly from 570 mA h g−1 to 160 mA h g−1 within 100 cycles with low CE. The cells in L1L2TE electrolyte delivered superior long-term stability and a high initial discharge capacity of about 700 mA h g−1. As shown in Fig. S2b–d,† the long-term cycling performance is significantly enhanced by increasing the molar ratio of LiFSI/LiTFSI. The cell with the L1L2TE-1382 electrolyte delivers a high capacity of 670 mA h g−1 after activation (the theoretical capacity is 729 mA h g−1). After 500 cycles, the cell retains an excellent capacity retention of more than 94% (650 mA h g−1, Fig. S2d, ESI†), corresponding to a capacity fade as low as 0.006% per cycle.
 Fig. 4  (a) Long-time cycling performances of Li–SeSPAN cells with different electrolytes. (b) Rate performance of Li–SeSPAN cells with different electrolytes (LDD, L1L2TE-3182, L1L2TE-2282 and L1L2TE-1382). 
The rate performances of Li–SeSPAN cells are shown in Fig. 4b and S3 (ESI†). With continuous loss of the active substance, the capacities of the LDD cell decreased significantly during charge–discharge cycles with a low coulombic efficiency. In contrast, the cell delivered a reversible capacity with the L1L2TE electrolytes. The stable capacity of cells with L1L2TE-2282/1382 electrolyte have recovered to about 670 mA h g−1 when the current density returned to 0.2 A g−1 (0.3C). As shown in Table S3,† due to L1L2TE-1382 having the highest conductivity, the cell with this electrolyte delivered the highest capacities of 705, 667, 646, 616, 575 and 300 mA h g−1 with a current density of 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 A g−1 (0.15, 0.3, 0.75, 1.5, 3, and 7.5C) respectively, corresponding to the utilization ratios of 96.7%, 91.5%, 88.5%, 84.5%, 78.8% and 41.1% of the theoretical capacity (729 mA h g−1). These results indicate that THF–DPE-based electrolytes with higher molar ratios of LiFSI/LiTFSI is beneficial to enhancing the cycling stabilities and rate performances of the Li–SeSPAN cell.
The capacity retention of the full cells having a long-time storage is shown in Fig. 5. All the cells were discharged to 1.9 V initially and kept quiescent at room temperature for 10 days (240 h), and then discharged to 1.0 V at the final stage. The OCV (open-circuit voltage) of the LDD cell shows an obvious decrease during storage in Fig. S4a (ESI†). In addition, the discharge capacity in the “storage cycle” for the LDD cell (in Fig. 5a) is lower than that in both the “previous cycle” (the last cycle before the “storage cycle”, with an attenuation of about 26.5%) and the “latter cycle” (the next cycle after the “storage cycle”, with an attenuation of about 10.1%). Different from the LDD cell, the OCV of the L1L2TE cells retained a constant value during long-time storage (Fig. S4b–d, ESI†). And no shrinkages were found in the “storage cycle” discharge profiles (Fig. 5b–d) in these cells, which indicates that the cells with the L1L2TE electrolytes can deliver an excellent storage performance with no self-discharge issue.

3.4 Characterization of the cycled cathodes and anodes
To explore the different effects of LDD and L1L2TE electrolytes on the sulfur cathode, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were employed to analyze the morphology and chemical composition of the cathode surface after cycling for 5 cycles in the full cells. Compared with the original cathode, the electrodes cycled in LDD and L1L2TE-1382 electrolytes do not show significant change at the end of charge and retain the original smooth surface (Fig. 6a–c). However, the EDS images (Fig. S5, ESI†) of these cathodes showed that the sulfur content on the cathode cycled in LDD electrolyte is significantly lower than both the original and the one cycled in L1L2TE-1382 electrolyte, which also proved that more of the sulfur component had migrated to the LDD electrolyte. Fig. 6d–f show the S 2p XPS spectra of these cathodes (original cathode, the cathode cycled in LDD and the L1L2TE-1382 cathode, respectively). Compared with the cathode cycled in LDD, the concentrated Li salts in L1L2TE electrolytes tended to decompose on the surface to form a lithium sulfate phase, which participates in forming an inorganic-rich SEI to separate internal active sulfur material from the electrolyte.

The detailed morphology of Li anodes dismounted from the full cells after 50 cycles was further investigated by using SEM. After cycling in the conventional LDD electrolyte, a thick fluffy layer was formed on the Li anode, and the thickness of Li has drastically increased to 135 μm (50 μm for the original Li anode). In sharp contrast, compact and dense growth of Li has formed in the L1L2TE electrolytes. The thickness of the Li anode had decreased from 105 μm to 87 μm with the increase of the molar ratio of LiFSI/LiTFSI, which was much thinner than the anode in the LDD electrolyte (Fig. 7b–d). The photographs of the separators and Li anodes of the cycled batteries are listed at the top right corner in each of Fig. 7a–d. All the cycled Li anodes was washed using THF, and the photos of the washed THF are shown in the corresponding the bottom right corners. The yellowed separator in the LDD cell was not attached to the electrode and was almost dry, which indicates that LiPSs once appeared in electrolyte and that Li metal was continuously consumed during cycling. The washed THF for the cycled Li anode in LDD has a characteristic pale-yellow color of the diluted Li2Sx solution. It reflects that only using the solid–solid conversion-based sulfur cathode with a traditional ether electrolyte cannot effectively prevent the shuttling of LiPSs. Instead, the colorless separators in L1L2TE cells were wet and adhered to the cathodes, which intuitively proves that the L1L2TE electrolyte not only has good compatibility with the Li anode, but also inhibits the dissolution of LiPSs. With less LiPSs migrating to the anode, the bottles of washed THF for Li anodes cycled in L1L2TE electrolytes were transparent and colorless.

To gain an insight into the different plating and stripping behaviors of Li in various electrolytes, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was employed to analyze the chemical composition of the SEI layers on Li anodes after cycling for 50 cycles in the full cells. In the N 1s XPS spectra (Fig. S6, ESI†), two peaks at around 399 eV and 397 eV are associated with Li2N2O2 and Li3N, respectively.27 Since the FSI− ions tend to decompose and form nitrides on the Li surface, the existence of Li3N in the SEI suggest improved ionic conductivity of lithium ions.28 The F 1s XPS spectra are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), and the distinct peak at 688 eV is attributed to C–F bonds and the peak at around 684.5 eV is associated with LiF.29,30 The intensity of the LiF peak is enhanced with the increase of the molar ratio of LiFSI/LiTFSI, whereas the S–F peak is weakened gradually. LiF is a main inorganic component for forming a robust SEI, which plays a critical role in inhibiting side reactions on the anode and suppressing Li dendrite formation. Unlike the SEI formed in LDD, with increasing salt concentration (especially LiFSI), the content of lithium sulfate increased in the SEI formed in L1L2TE electrolyte. The peaks at 166.8 eV and 167.9 eV in the S 2p spectrum in Fig. 8 are associated with Li2SOx.31,32 FSI− tends to decompose on the Li surface to form a lithium sulfate phase, which participates in the formation of an inorganic-rich SEI. The peaks at 163 eV and 161.4 eV are assigned to bridge-sulfur (SB) and terminal-sulfur (ST) in Li2Sx respectively.30 The high contents of Li2Sx–SB and Li2Sx–ST have appeared in the SEI formed in LDD electrolyte, which also supports that LiPS has dissolved and migrated to the Li anode in a traditional ether-based electrolyte. The solubilities of LiPSs have been effectively suppressed by the medium concentration dual-salt (LiTFSI–LiFSI) and the mixed solvents (THF–DPE) with low polarity. Therefore, less Li2Sx is found in the SEI formed on the Li anode cycled in the L1L2TE electrolytes.

The interfacial evolution of the full cells was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The semicircles in the high-frequency region were related to the resistance of Li+ migrating through the interface (Rct) on the anode (Fig. S8, ESI†). In the full-charged state, the cells with L1L2TE-4082 electrolyte exhibited the largest Rct values along with cycling (from 19 ohm for the 1st cycle to 40 ohms for the 50th cycle). The resistance of full cells with dual-salt electrolytes declined slightly in the first 30 cycles. By increasing the amount of LiFSI in electrolyte, the Rct of the cells with L1L2TE-1382 was smallest, exhibiting 13 ohm and 19 ohms for the 1st and the 50th cycle, respectively. These results of resistance evolution proved that the THF–DPE based electrolyte with concentrated LiFSI has improved compatibility with metallic Li and participated in forming a more stable SEI on the anode.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel electrolyte that enables a dendrite-free Li anode and eliminates LiPS shuttling in Li–SeSPAN batteries, simultaneously allowing for a long lifespan of 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 97%. The common-ion effect of medium concentration dual-salt (LiTFSI–LiFSI) and low polarity of the mixed solvent (THF–DPE) prevent lithium polysulfides from dissolving in electrolyte. Therefore, the capacity of the cells with the L1L2TE electrolytes has no self-discharge effect during a 10 day storage. This work provides an effective electrolyte design strategy toward Li anode protection and inhibition of the “shuttle effect”, which is expected to promote the long-cycle life of LSBs with an ultrathin Li anode. Some ethers (such as THF) under heat and oxygen-rich environments tend to form peroxides, which would be replaced with some safer ether solvents in subsequent research.
