    , Accepted 2nd November 2015First published on 4th November 2015AbstractAmong the various perovskite solar cells, the carbon-based hole-transporter-free type is arguably the most promising for applications because of its low material/manufacturing cost, high efficiency and better long-term stability. However, the fill factor (FF) is typically below 0.75, limiting the cell performance. In this communication, through a comparison of systematic performance between the multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) and another two representative carbon materials, namely carbon black and graphite, we highlight two salient advantages of MWCNT-based devices: high FF and hysteresis-free performance. We owe the superior performance to the charge transport highway at the interface of MWCNT/perovskite. After preliminary optimization, we have achieved a PCE of 12.67% with a very impressive FF of 0.80, which is among the highest for carbon-based perovskite solar cells.
Recently, continuous and rapid development of the organometal halide perovskite solar cells has attracted much attention not only from research laboratory but also from photovoltaic industry. The perovskite solar cells are known for their fantastic power conversion efficiency (PCE) gain (up to a certified value of 20.1%) and the solution-processable fabrication process.1–3 Among the various kinds of perovskite solar cell structures, including mesoscopic, planar and inverted designs,4–7 the most common and successful ones can be expressed as TiO2/perovskite/hole-transporter/Au. However, as the most commonly used hole transporter material (HTM), spiro-OMeTAD has proved to be unstable in air and hence we can say nothing about its long-term stability.8–11
To improve the long-term cell stability, some stable inorganic HTMs, such as CuSCN,12,13 were used to replace with the spiro-OMeTAD and have shown a PCE of 12.4%. Even more radical, Au electrode was deposited on the perovskite without the spiro-OMeTAD interlayer and a PCE of 11.5% was still achieved.14–16 Viewing from many facets of cost, performance, stability and manufacturing simplicity, carbon-based HTM-free perovskite solar cells have proved to be one of the most promising perovskite solar cells. In such perovskite solar cells (shown in Fig. 1A), electrons are injected from the perovskite to TiO2 and finally collected by FTO. Meanwhile, holes are extracted from the perovskite to the carbon electrode directly, eliminating both the noble metal electrode and HTM. Here one of the key processes is hole extraction at the interface of carbon/perovskite, the quality of which is strongly influenced by the interface engineering strategy,17–19 carbon material type,20 particle size/shape21,22 and electronic properties.22,23 Typically, the FF of nanocarbon-based perovskite solar cells is <0.75 (shown in Table S1†),17,22,24,25 which is substantially lower than that of the state-of-art HTM-based devices, e.g., >0.78.1,2 Compellingly, carbon nanotubes should make an excellent hole extraction electrode material owing to their extraordinary electrical, thermal, mechanical, electrical and net-work forming properties.26,27 To the best of our knowledge, however, there has been no study in this direction due to the challenges of proper carbon/perovskite interface engineering.

Herein, we report a multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT, 773840 ALDRICH, ≥98% carbon basis, O.D. × I.D. × L 10 nm ± 1 nm × 4.5 nm ± 0.5 nm × 3–6 μm) electrode, its seamless interface with a perovskite layer achieved by the chemical reaction embedment technique we reported previously,17–19,28 and the integration of the electrode and the interface into an efficient carbon-based perovskite solar cell. For a direct comparison, two other representative carbon materials (carbon black and graphite, see the ESI† for more details) were also used to fabricate solar cells in the same way (for experimental details, please refer to the ESI, Fig. S1†). It turns out that the MWCNT electrode is superior to the other carbon electrodes in terms of a much higher FF due to its more robust interface.
In brief, a compact and mesoscopic TiO2 thin film was prepared by one-step TiCl4 treatment firstly (shown in Fig. S2†). Then, the PbI2 thin film and the three carbon thin films were deposited in sequence by spin-coating and drop-casting, respectively. Finally, 100 μL of CH3NH3I solution (IPA, 10 mg mL−1) was dropped onto the above FTO/TiO2/PbI2/C substrates for 3 min, dried by spinning and heated at 100 °C for 10 min. This step involves the so-called in situ chemical reaction embedment which ensures the seamless contact of the C/perovskite interface in an evaporative wet medium.
It can be seen from the ultraviolet photoelectron spectra (UPS, shown in Fig. S3†) that the above three carbon materials have a similar work function. As a result, the corresponding perovskite solar cells have the same energy level alignment relative to perovskite (Fig. 1A).
A full hole extraction comprises two major steps: one is hole extraction from the perovskite to the C nanoparticle and the other is charge transport through the C film. With the chemical reaction embedment strategy, the carbon materials can be seamlessly connected with the perovskite film, forming a high quality carbon/perovskite interface that allows fluent hole extraction from the perovskite to carbon. This is clearly manifested in Fig. 1B for C black particles. However, the carbon black film is easily cracked due to lack of binding force. In this case, transport of the extracted holes from particle-to-particle through the carbon black film is expected to be slow.
As regards the MWCNT electrode shown in Fig. 1C, a seamless interface between the MWCNTs and the perovskite is also formed with the chemical embedment technique, securing an efficient interfacial hole extraction process. What is unique here is that the MWCNT network can work as a charge transfer highway for holes and should be beneficial to photovoltaic performance, which will be discussed below. Another extreme case is the graphite flake electrode shown in Fig. 1D. Although charge transport through the graphite flake film is expected to be fast, the hole extraction from the perovskite to the graphite flakes is encumbered simply because the graphite flakes are too large in size and cannot form a good contact with the perovskite crystalline film.
As mentioned above, the morphology of carbon materials has a great influence on the interface quality of carbon/perovskite and then the solar cell performance. To closely examine the morphology difference, we turned to use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe the carbon thin film and interface of carbon/perovskite. Fig. 2A shows the top view SEM image of a carbon black thin film, which is loosely packed by ∼30 nm carbon nanoparticles. As there is no binder between carbon nanoparticles and the van der Waals force is not strong enough to make particles pack closely, the as-deposited carbon black thin film is easy to crack. In this case, the extracted holes need to be transported from one particle to the surrounding particle, which is supposed to be a not so efficient way. The cracks on the carbon thin film are thought to be harmful to photovoltaic performance.21 As for the interface of carbon black/perovskite, shown in Fig. 2B, we can see a ∼650 nm of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 composite layer seamlessly connected with the carbon black thin film. From transmittance electron microscopy (TEM) images of MWCNT shown in Fig. S4,† it can be seen that the MWCNT is a 1-dimensional material with ∼15 nm in diameter and several micrometres long. The long chain-like structure makes the MWCNT easily pack and cross together to form a continuous and crack-free thin film (shown in Fig. 2C). Similar to carbon black, with chemical embedment technique, the MWCNT can also be strongly attached onto the perovskite thin film (shown in Fig. 2D and S5†). As shown in Fig. 2E, the graphite thin film consists of 2-dimensional (2D) flakes which are on the scale of tens of micrometres, significantly bigger than the carbon black particles and MWCNTs. Thanks to the 2D flake structure, the graphite flakes tend to pack compactly and connect with each other forming a continuous thin film. However, as the graphite flakes are too large in size and too rigid to fold, the as-deposited graphite thin film cannot fully contact the PbI2 thin film, leaving behind many gaps between the perovskite and graphite films even after chemical embedment (shown in Fig. 2F). It is believed that the gaps will bring in severe charge transfer problems and result in poor photovoltaic performance, which will be discussed below.

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the as-fabricated three carbon-based perovskite solar cells, current–voltage (J–V) characteristics under 1 sun conditions and dark J–V were recorded and presented in Fig. 3A and B. From Fig. 3A and Table 1, it is obvious that the graphite device shows a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.93 V, fill factor (FF) of 0.64, but the lowest current density (Jsc) of 10.30 mA cm−2 and only yielding a PCE of 6.13%. The apparent low Jsc should be attributed to the poor contact between the graphite film and perovskite film (due to gaps as indicated in Fig. 2F) while the carbon black device shows a significantly higher Jsc of 15.98 mA cm−2, together with a Voc of 0.90 V, FF of 0.65 and corresponding PCE of 9.35%. As for the MWCNT device, the most impressive aspect is the high FF of as high as 0.75, accompanied by a Voc of 0.88 V and a Jsc of 15.60 mA cm−2, resulting in a PCE of 10.30%. One of the reasons for the high FF is related to the superior conductivity (shown in Fig. S6†). Specifically, the conductivity of the MWCNT is 35.60 S cm−1, which is 4.30 times higher than graphite and 7.43 times higher than carbon black. In common parlance, the FF is sensitive to the interface quality and directly correlated with the shunt resistance (Rsh) and the series resistance (Rs). The values of Rsh and Rs are extracted from the J–V curves and shown in Table S1.† It can be seen that the MWCNT device has the lowest Rs but the highest Rsh, significantly higher, indicating a more fluent hole extraction and larger recombination suppression at the interface of CH3NH3PbI3/MWCNT. From the cell efficiency statistic results shown in Fig. S7,† one can see that the MWCNT device's performance is significantly higher than those of the carbon black and graphite devices.

In addition, the dark J–V curves also provide valuable information, such as Rs, Rsh and leakage current.4,29 From the dark J–V curves shown in Fig. 3B, it can be seen that the dark current of the MWCNT device under reverse bias is significantly lower than that of carbon black and graphite devices, suggesting that the MWCNT device shows the lowest leakage current. Moreover, in the forward bias region after 0.85 V, the injected current density of the MWCNT device is much higher than that of the other two devices, revealing a lower injection barrier between the MWCNT and perovskite. As all of the three carbon-based perovskite devices have the similar TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface and similar CH3NH3PbI3 layer, it is believed that the leakage current is mainly determined by the C/CH3NH3PbI3 interface quality. By comparison, the leakage current is in the order of MWCNT < carbon black < graphite, and the charge injection barrier is in the order of MWCNT < carbon black < graphite too, suggesting that the interface quality of C/CH3NH3PbI3 is in the order of MWCNT > carbon black > graphite. In other words, the superior conductivity of the MWCNT network and the high quality of the MWCNT/CH3NH3PbI3 interface are primarily responsible for the remarkable increase of FF.
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of some model devices were recorded and used to analyse the interfacial charge transfer and recombination processes. As shown in Fig. 3C, we fabricated two model devices with the architecture of FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/MWCNT and FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/MWCNT, respectively. Fig. 3D shows the Bode phase plots, and there is only one peak in the high frequency region (4 MHz to 1 kHz) for the FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/MWCNT device. By contrast, the FTO/TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/MWCNT devices show one peak in the high frequency region and another peak in the low frequency region (<10 Hz). Based on these results and some literature,30 we can attribute the high frequency peak to the charge transfer process for the interface of CH3NH3PbI3/MWCNT and the low frequency peak to the overall charge recombination process in the perovskite thin film. As all of the as-fabricated three carbon-based perovskite devices have the similar TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface, it is believed that the different charge transfer process of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface should be responsible for the PCE difference. Fig. 3E shows the Nyquist plots of the three kinds of perovskite model devices with the configuration of FTO/CH3NH3PbI3/C (frequency from 4 MHz to 1 kHz, bias: 0 V). In Fig. 3E, for each device, only one semi-circle is observed, which represents the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the CH3NH3PbI3/C interface. It can be seen that the MWCNT device has the lowest Rs and Rct. Fig. 3F presents the curve of derived Rct as a function of applied voltage (the original data and equivalent circuit are shown in Fig. S8†); it can be seen that Rct is in the order of MWCNT < carbon black < graphite at all applied voltage ranges. By combining the J–V test and EIS results, we can conclude that the superior performance of MWCNT devices should be attributed to the ultra-small Rs and Rct.
Despite the widely known high efficiencies,1,2 perovskite solar cells still suffer from the hysteresis effect, which is dependent on the scan direction and scan rate.31,32 Such a hysteresis effect seriously causes concern over the cell stability and difficulty to accurately determine the cell efficiency. To investigate the photocurrent hysteresis effect of the as-fabricated three carbon-based perovskite solar cells, J–V curves with different scan directions (forward: from 0 V to 1 V, backward: from 1 V to 0 V) and scan rates (10 mV s−1, 50 mV s−1 and 100 mV s−1) were recorded and presented in Fig. 4. To clearly describe the difference between the efficiency of forward scan and backward scan, we define a difference factor according to the following equation:  where ηbackward and ηforward are corresponding to the PCE of the backward scan and forward scan respectively.
 Fig. 4  Hysteresis effect investigation of the as-fabricated three carbon-based perovskite solar cells: carbon black, graphite and MWCNT. 
As shown in Fig. 4, at a scan rate of 10 mV s−1, the forward and backward curves of carbon black and MWCNT devices nearly overlap perfectly with difference factors of only 2.98% and 1.26% respectively, which means little hysteresis effect exists. However, the difference between forward and backward scans of the graphite device is more obvious with a difference factor of 5.77%, which means there is indeed hysteresis effect. When the scan rate increases up to 50 mV s−1, the difference factor of carbon black and graphite grows to 4.61% and 8.02%, respectively while the difference factor of MWCNT device is only 1.53%. When the scan rate further rises to 100 mV s−1, the hysteresis effect becomes worse for carbon black and graphite devices with a large difference factor of 19.98% and 12.49%, respectively. Impressively, even at this high scan rate (100 mV s−1), the MWCNT device only shows a difference factor of 1.53%, which is nearly the same as the values of slow scan rates (50 mV s−1 and 10 mV s−1). Based on the above results, we can conclude that there is no obvious hysteresis effect for the MWCNT device. Moreover, the statistic results of difference factor (Fig. S9†) and the fast current response upon chopped illumination (Fig. S10†) also supports the hysteresis-free performance. However, there indeed exists significant hysteresis effect for carbon black and graphite devices. As these three carbon-based perovskite solar cells have similar cell configuration and TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interface, it is believed that the different performance on the hysteresis effect is due to the different interface quality of C/CH3NH3PbI3 and the corresponding hole transfer process. By combining the EIS results in Fig. 3 and hysteresis effect investigation in Fig. 4, we believe that the MWCNT films can indeed serve as a charge transport highway (as indicated in Fig. 1C) for the extracted holes, and this is the main reason for the higher PCE and the elimination of the hysteresis effect.
On the basis of the above discussion, one can conclude that there are mainly two features for the MWCNT-based perovskite device: i.e., high FF and hysteresis-free performance, which make MWCNT films a very promising hole extraction electrode material in HTM-free perovskite solar cells. It is noticed that the key limitation for the cell performance is the low Jsc, which is strongly dependent on the perovskite composite, film thickness and quality.2 Hence, we tried to increase the PbI2 precursor layer thickness by multiple spin coating and increase the PbI2 solution concentration (please refer to step 2 for Experimental details in the ESI†). As a result, the thicker PbI2 precursor layer will result in a thicker CH3NH3PbI3 layer and higher Jsc. Fig. 5A shows the J–V curves of the MWCNT-based devices fabricated with different PbI2 precursor layers (cross-sectional SEM images are shown in Fig. S11†). As expected, the device fabricated with the 550 nm PbI2 precursor layer gives a higher Jsc (18.02 mA cm−2) than the 350 nm PbI2 layer device (15.18 mA cm−2). However, even after optimization, Jsc of the device fabricated from the 550 nm PbI2 layer is still lower than those reported in the literature,1–3 probably because the PbI2 layer is too thick and cannot be fully converted to the perovskite. Considering that the perovskite layer is covered by a thick MWCNT thin film and cannot be directly tested by XRD, we prepared a perovskite thin film with the identical procedure but leaving out the MWCNT layer. As shown in Fig. S12,† some PbI2 residues still can be detected in that film, which could be responsible for the low Jsc. Fig. 5B presents the corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum. An integration of the IPCE spectrum with the AM 1.5G solar photon flux yields a current density of 14.64 and 17.75 mA cm−2, which are well consistent with J–V test results. Moreover, it can be seen from the IPCE spectra that the Jsc enhancement is mainly due to the light harvesting improvement after 550 nm. Besides the Jsc growth, it is also found that the FF can be further increased by increasing the MWCNT electrode thickness. As shown in Fig. 5C, two MWCNT layer (∼40 μm) device presents a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 18.00 mA cm−2, and a very impressive FF of 0.80, yielding a PCE of 12.67%. By contrast, one MWCNT layer (∼15 μm) device shows a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 17.75 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.75, yielding a PCE of 11.72%. From the corresponding EIS spectra (Fig. 5D, recorded in the dark with a bias of −0.4 V), the higher FF of the two MWCNT layer device should be attributed to the smaller Rs and the larger recombination resistance (Rrec). Further, the larger Rrec implicates a stronger suppression of charge recombination in the whole perovskite thin film, including the C/CH3NH3PbI3 and TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 interfaces. We have also tested the stability of one of the MWCNT devices, and the results are presented in Fig. S13.† One can see that the device retained ∼90% of its initial efficiency after 10 days.

Conclusions
To sum up, we have identified the MWCNTs as a superior hole extraction electrode material in HTM-free perovskite solar cells. Through a comparison of systematic performances of the MWCNT and the other two representative carbon materials (carbon black and graphite), we arrive at two reasons for the good performance of the MWCNT-based devices. The first reason is the proper size (∼15 nm in diameter) and 1D chain structure. It is the small size that ensures the appropriate embedment of the MWCNTs into the perovskite film, while the 1D chain structure allows interpenetration to form a continuous, highly conductive and crack-free network film. The second reason is the interpenetrating charge transfer bi-continuous highway at the interface between the CH3NH3PbI3 and the MWCNT network, which is mainly responsible for the high FF and hysteresis-free performance. After preliminary optimization, we are able to achieve a hysteresis-free PCE of 12.67% with a very impressive FF of 0.80. Our work opens up a new opportunity for nanocarbon-based perovskite solar cells by designing and assembling low-dimensional nanostructured and highly conductive carbon cathodes. Future work on the MWCNT-based PSC devices should focus on the improvement of Jsc by judiciously promoting the crystalline quality of the perovskite active layer.1,2
