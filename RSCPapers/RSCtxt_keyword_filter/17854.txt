    , Accepted 23rd April 2019First published on 24th April 2019AbstractWith the rapid development in large-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors, the energy level mismatch between the cathode interlayer (CIL) and the acceptors becomes severe. Herein, we carefully investigate the influence of interlayers with different lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels on the performance of non-fullerene organic solar cells (OSCs), and observe that the energy level alignment between interlayers and acceptors plays a crucial role in achieving high open circuit voltage (Voc) and efficient charge extraction. Meanwhile, we find that the electron extraction and transport abilities of the CIL can be tuned by blending two CIL materials together with different ratios (named binary CIL). Based on these findings, efficient single-junction, double-junction and triple-junction homo-tandem OSCs based on a large-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor and binary CIL with an ultrahigh Voc of 1.22 V, 2.39 V and 3.21 V are demonstrated. The high Voc of tandem OSCs further ensure their application in solar-energy-driven water splitting. This study offers a new strategy to extend the application of CILs, and helps to develop efficient and thick CILs for printed large-area non-fullerene OSCs.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted tremendous scientific and industrial interest in recent years due to their advantages of low cost, light weight, flexibility and solution processing.1–3 In the beginning, organic solar cells were dominated by employing a photoactive layer composed of donors blended with the fullerene acceptors, including [6,6]phenyl-C71/C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM/PC61BM). In spite of the strong electron-accepting and isotropic electron-transport capabilities of fullerene acceptors, fullerene-based OSCs suffer from a relatively low voltage of 0.6–0.9 V due to severe photovoltage loss, low absorption intensity, and difficulty in chemical modification, which limited the further improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE).4–7 In contrast, non-fullerene acceptors would be an excellent candidate due to their strong absorption intensity, tunable energy level, and relatively low energy offset for exciton dissociation.8–10 Non-fullerene OSCs thus show much better performance than fullerene OSCs with PCEs now reaching over 15% for single junction cells.11 Since the energy level of non-fullerene acceptors can be easily adjusted, it provides an opportunity to develop large-bandgap acceptors,12 which play important roles in the construction of high-efficiency tandem solar cells with more complete coverage of the solar spectrum.13–17 Meanwhile, tandem OSCs with high Voc are a good choice for photoelectrochemical water splitting,18 carbon dioxide reduction19 or even partial voltage driven devices such as electrochromic glass.20 However, along with the broadening of the bandgap of non-fullerene acceptors, the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level is bound to be up-shifted, which poses new challenges for the development of interfacial materials.
Interfacial engineering has long been considered as an integral part to boost the efficiency of organic solar cells (OSCs). A number of high efficiency OSCs have been obtained based on polymer cathode interfacial materials.21–25 Polymer cathode interfacial materials can be divided into two categories, one of them including poly[(9,9′-bis(30-(N,N′-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN), poly[(9,9′-bis(30-(N,N′-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9′-dioctylfluorene)] dibromide (PFN-Br), polyethylenimine (PEI), etc. They improve device performance mainly through interfacial dipole and/or n-doping acceptors.26,27 These interfacial materials typically require a thin layer (∼5 nm) for efficient electron tunneling transport. Another type of polymer cathode interfacial material is based on n-type backbone materials.28–30 Since these materials generally possess coplanar conjugated main chains, they often have excellent electron transport ability and can work efficiently within a wide thickness range. In these CILs, the electrons transport through the LUMO levels of the acceptors and interfacial materials. In particular, the performance of these thick film interlayers can be further improved via self-doping, demonstrating more promising application in print processing.31 These properties also ensure their successful application in tandem OSCs since they can protect the bottom layer from being destroyed by the top layer solution.15,16 However, as the LUMO of large-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors keeps shifting up, it is predictable that the energy barrier between the acceptor and interlayer will be enlarged. Re-engineering the interface between the interfacial layer and the large-bandgap active layer is thus quite urgent and necessary.
Recently, our group reported an efficient polymer donor benzodithiophene-difluorobenzoxadiazole-2-decyltetradecyl (BDT-ffBX-DT), which works well with both fullerene32 and non-fullerene acceptors, especially for the large-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor (PDI dimer with a spirofluorene linker (SFPDI)) with a high LUMO energy of −3.71 eV.33 Here, we investigated the device performance of BDT-ffBX-DT:SFPDI based non-fullerene OSCs by selecting a series of CIL materials PIF-PMIDE-N (−3.68 eV), PNDIT-F3N (−3.89 eV), and PIF-PDI-N (−3.92 eV) with different LUMO energy levels,25,31 and demonstrated that the devices' Voc decreases with the LUMO of interfacial materials shifting down. PIF-PMIDE-N achieved the highest Voc and best PCE,33 while the others showed lower Voc and PCE. These results are attributed to the energy level alignment between the large-bandgap acceptors and CILs, which has not been systematically discussed in non-fullerene OSCs yet.34 Furthermore, by blending two CIL materials (PIF-PMIDE-N and PNDIT-F3N) together in different ratios (named binary CIL), we found that the energy level and electron transport properties of the binary interlayer can be linearly tuned. Based on the binary strategy, we successfully developed a CIL with efficient electron extraction and transport ability for large-bandgap non-fullerene OSCs. Moreover, when this binary CIL was further applied in non-fullerene homo-tandem OSCs, an ultrahigh Voc of 2.39 V was achieved, which is the highest value obtained in double-junction tandem solar cells so far. Then, solar-energy-driven water splitting experiments revealed its feasibility in the dissociation of water in an electrochemical cell. Moreover, an unprecedented high Voc of 3.21 V was achieved in triple-junction OSCs, which is expected to be applicable to carbon dioxide reduction.19
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the chemical structures of BDT-ffBX-DT and SFPDI. A single junction device based on this active layer has been demonstrated with an ultrahigh Voc of 1.23 V and an ultralow non-radiative Voc loss.33 To investigate the influence of energy level mismatch between CILs and the non-fullerene acceptor on device performances, three organic CIL materials were chosen to modify the photoactive layer. The device performances are summarized in Table 1 and Fig. 2(a), the J–V curves are shown in Fig. S1 in the ESI.† The controlled device with no CIL was also fabricated here. To ensure the accuracy of results, the frontier molecular orbital energy level of acceptors and CIL materials were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements under the same conditions (Fig. S2 and Table S1 in the ESI†), the schematic of the energy level is illustrated in Fig. 1(b), and the results are consistent with the reported literature.26,33,35 The molecular weight (Mn) of the three CILs was estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using chloroform as the eluent. PIF-PMIDE-N, PNDIT-F3N and PIF-PDI-N have comparable Mn of 16.3, 14.6 and 16.5 kDa, with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.53, 2.00, and 1.59.

 Fig. 2  Summarized Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE variation of (a) BDT-ffBX-DT:SFPDI, (b) NT812:SFPDI, (c) PBDB-T:ITCC, and (d) PCE10:N2200 modified by three CILs. 
Notably, all of these three CILs exhibited good interface modification properties when used in fullerene-based OSCs.25 However, when these three interlayers were used in large-bandgap non-fullerene OSCs based on a BDT-ffBX-DT:SFPDI blend, only PIF-PMIDE-N showed a comparable Voc and PCE with the reported literature,33 while the PNDIT-F3N and PIF-PDI-N showed a decreased Voc of 1.19 and 1.17 V, respectively. Since these three interlayers show a difference in energy levels, the variation in Voc may be attributed to the electron extraction barrier between the acceptor and CILs. The LUMO of acceptor SFPDI is −3.71 eV, when these interlayers were inserted between the acceptor and electrode; the energy offset between the acceptor and CILs increases from PIF-PMIDE-N (∼−0.03 eV) and PNDIT-F3N (∼0.18 eV), to PIF-PMIDE-N (∼0.21 eV). It is therefore expected that PIF-PMIDE-N offers more favorable energy alignment for the acceptor. The large energy offset for PNDIT-F3N and PIF-PDI-N will likely lead to thermionic losses for electron extraction and thus reduce the Voc.34,36 To further verify the influence of CILs on non-fullerene acceptors systems, these three CILs were introduced to work with three other non-fullerene acceptor systems with cascade LUMO levels (naphtho[1,2-c:5,6-c′]bis([1,2,5]-thiadiazole)-based polymer (NT812):SFPDI, poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-di(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-benzo[1,2c:4,5c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione)] (PBDB-T):3,9-bis(4-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-3-methylene-2-oxo-cyclopenta[b]thiophen)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-dithieno[2,3-d′:2,3-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITCC) and poly[[2,6-4,8-di(5-ethylhexylthienyl)benzo[1,2-b; 3,3-b]-dithiophene][3-fluoro-2[(2-ethylhexyl)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]-thiophenediyl]] (PTB7-Th):poly{[N,N-9-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)-2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5′-(2,2′-bithiophene)} (N2200), Fig. 1(c)), where the LUMO of three acceptors show gradual decrease from −3.71 to −3.98 eV. The relationship of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE with three interlayers in different systems is compared in Fig. 2(b–d) and Table S2.†
As expected, the Voc of NT812:SFPDI and PBDB-T:ITCC devices exhibited the same trend as that of the BDT-ffBX-DT:SFPDI, and the Voc loss eventually resulted in the decrease of device performance. However the third system containing N2200, which has similar LUMO value compared with that of fullerene PC71BM, showed nearly constant Voc, agreeing well with the case in fullerene based OSCs, indicating efficient electron extraction in this non-fullerene system. These results further demonstrated that reducing the charge extraction barrier between the large-bandgap acceptor and CIL is crucial to achieve an efficient device. The LUMO of interlayers should energetically match with LUMO of acceptors to achieve efficient charge extraction, otherwise the Voc would be reduced due to the additional thermionic losses for electron collection, and finally reduce the PCE. These results help us to choose efficient CILs for non-fullerene OSCs, especially for a large-bandgap non-fullerene with a high lying LUMO level.
As discussed above, an ideal interlayer should not only have good charge extraction ability but also be able to work efficiently within a large thickness variation, which ensures reproducibility in printed large-area OSC modules. As we see in Table 1 and Fig. 3(a), although PIF-PMIDE-N can work efficiently with a thickness around 5 nm, the 20 nm and 50 nm PIF-PMIDE-N showed both decreased Jsc and FF, and thus reduced PCE. This phenomenon should be attributed to the low electron mobility of the interlayer, which has also been reported in fullerene based OSCs.25 Therefore, interlayer materials with both efficient charge extraction ability and high electron mobility should be designed. Unfortunately, considering the energy level of the interlayer, there indeed exist some difficulties to balance the mobility and the LUMO of the interlayer. The up-shift of the LUMO may result in p-type dominant interface materials, which would not be suitable for electron transport, and thus limit the electron mobility. This would be a challenge to develop efficient electron transport materials fit for large-bandgap acceptors, and more in-depth investigations into related work are ongoing in our group.

Besides the design and synthesis of novel CILs, a binary strategy (by mixing two materials together) was introduced to improve the performance of the interlayer in this work. PNDIT-F3N has been identified as an excellent electron transport material in both fullerene and non-fullerene based OSCs.26 The high electron mobility endows it with the property of thickness insensitivity. Blending PNDIT-F3N into PIF-PMIDE-N is expected to achieve interfacial materials with both efficient electron extraction ability and electron transport ability. Thus, different amounts of PNDIT-F3N were blended with PIF-PMIDE-N, aiming to improve the electron mobility of PIF-PMIDE-N. The resulting device performances are summarized in Table S3.† Note that the devices with a small amount of PNDIT-F3N blended in PIF-PMIDE-N (PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N, 9:1 and 4:1) exhibited almost the same performances as the neat PIF-PMIDE-N. When further increasing the ratio of PNDIT-F3N in PIF-PMIDE-N, the Voc gradually decreases until 1.19 V, same as the neat PNDIT-F3N. The change of Voc was recorded from seven devices and is shown in Fig. S3.† The difference in the Voc may be attributed to change of the energy level in the binary interlayers (as observed above).
To further investigate the energy level properties of the binary interlayers, we conducted ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) measurements, which is a well-established analytic technique for obtaining the electronic structure in organic thin films.37,38 The UPS results are shown in Fig. 3(b). The high binding energy cutoff (Ecutoff) is estimated by linear extrapolation of the secondary electron region and finding the intersection with the background, so the work function (WF) can be further obtained by the difference between the incident photon energy, 21.22 eV, and Ecutoff.39 As shown in the right of Fig. 3(b), with the ratio of PNDIT-F3N increases, the WF varied from 3.75 to 3.66 eV, indicating the shift of the vacuum level (Evac). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) onset (EHOMOonset) of the blend films was extracted from the UPS in low energy. Then the HOMO energy level can be deduced using the equation: EHOMO = 21.22 − (Ecutoff − EHOMOonset).40 The absorption of PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N blend films with different ratios is also shown in Fig. 3(c), and the optical bandwidth (Eopt) can be extracted from the absorption edge. Thus, the LUMO of the blend interlayers can be estimated.41,42 Table S4† summarizes the WF, Eopt, HOMO, and LUMO of different blend films. And the relationship between the blend ratio and LUMO is shown in Fig. 3(d). The LUMO energy level of blend films down-shift linearly with the increase of PNDIT-F3N in PIF-PMIDE-N, indicating that the LUMO level of blend films was tuned by the addition of PNDIT-F3N. The results further confirmed what we observed in the above study that interlayers with a low lying LUMO level are unfavorable for energetically matching with large-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors.
To further study the improvement of the electron transport properties of PIF-PMIDE-N by the introduction of PNDIT-F3N, a blend ratio of 4:1 (PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N) was selected as it has high PNDIT-F3N content but does not sacrifice the Voc. A 20 nm and a 50 nm thick binary interlayer were used to fabricate the single junction device. Fig. 3(a) shows the device performance of pure PIF-PMIDE-N and PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N (4:1) with a thickness of 20 nm and 50 nm, the detailed device parameters are summarized in Table 1, and the EQE is shown in Fig. S4.† Compared with the 20 nm neat PIF-PMIDE-N, the 20 nm blend interlayer showed better performance with a PCE of 6.3%, a comparable PCE with the case of 5 nm; however when the thickness of CILs were further increased to 50 nm, the device with the binary CIL maintained a PCE of 5.1% with higher Jsc and FF in comparison to that of the pure PIF-PMIDE-N based device. These results suggested the electron transport ability of PIF-PMIDE-N was improved by the introduction of PNDIT-F3N. To further confirm these results, the conductivity test of the PIF-PMIDE-N blend with or without PNDIT-F3N was carried out. A Schottky device with the device structure ITO/PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N (5:0 and 4:1, 50 nm)/Ag was fabricated. The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 3(e). It can be seen that when blending with PNDIT-F3N, the conductivity of PIF-PMIDE-N slightly increased. In addition, the electron mobility of the PIF-PMIDE-N blend with or without PNDIT-F3N was investigated using the electron-only device with the configuration of ITO/ZnO/PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N (5:0 and 4:1, 90 nm)/Ca/Al, and it was extracted by fitting the data using the space-charge limited current (SCLC) model.43 The electron mobilities of PIF-PMIDE-N and PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N (4:1) calculated from the SCLC curves (shown in Fig. 3(f)) are determined to be 1.2 × 10−5 and 2.5 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The mobility of the binary interlayer is twice higher than that of the neat PIF-PMIDE-N, suggesting that the introduction of PNDIT-F3N into PIF-PMIDE-N is a feasible and efficient way to increase the mobility of PIF-PMIDE-N. All the above data indicate that the binary strategy is a simple and efficient way to result in interlayer materials with balanced properties from the parent materials and greatly extend the application of neat CILs.
Since the binary interlayer of PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N (4:1) exhibits good performances in both electron extraction and transport, it can be applied in tandem OSCs with the front cell consisting of a large-bandgap non-fullerene acceptor. Therefore, homo-junction tandem OSCs based on the structure ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/BDT-ffBX-DT:SFPDI/PIF-PMIDE-N (20 nm) or PIF-PMIDE-N:PNDIT-F3N (4:1, 20 nm)/Ag(2 nm)/PEDOT:PSS/BDT-ffBX-DT:SFPDI/PIF-PMIDE-N (5 nm)/Ag (100 nm) was fabricated (see Fig. 4(c)). The device results are summarized in Table 2, the J–V curve and EQE are shown in Fig. 4(a) and (b). Since the light response of the tandem cells with two identical sub-cells is similar, the EQE of the tandem device can be estimated by measuring the photo-response of the tandem cell and then multiplying it by two to represent the total number of photons being converted to electrons.44 Besides, the EQE of the tandem cell can also be estimated based on total absorption of the tandem cell and IQE response of single cells (as discussed in the ESI†).45,46 As expected, the binary interlayer based tandem devices showed much better performance than neat PIF-PMIDE-N based tandem devices. And the best device showed a PCE of 6.5% with a Voc of 2.39 V, a Jsc of 5.0 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.55. Our device shows the highest Voc in double junction tandem OSCs to date (as summarized in Fig. 4(d)),14,15,47–56 which ensures its broad application in the solar-fuel field, such as OPV-based solar water splitting systems.57 The solar-driven water splitting experiment, containing two platinum electrodes and a 1 mol L−1 NaOH electrolyte, was carried out (Fig. 5). The production of bubbles in the platinum wire cathode can be easily observed, which were further identified to be H2 by gas chromatography. The evolved hydrogen was collected and calculated to be 79.6 μmol cm−2. In addition, based on the similar structure, non-optimized triple junction OSCs were also fabricated and achieved a high Voc of up to 3.21 V (Table 2 and Fig. 4(a)). It can be expected to be applicable for carbon dioxide reduction, which typically requires a high voltage from the photovoltaics to overcome the 2–2.5 V threshold when considering the overpotential.19

Conclusions
In conclusion, we carefully investigated the influence of interlayers with different energy levels on the performance of non-fullerene OSCs. It was found that with the LUMO of the non-fullerene acceptor keeps shifting up, choosing a CIL with a high-lying LUMO is crucial for achieving high Voc and efficient charge collection. In addition, we find that the electron extraction and transport abilities of a CIL can be tuned by blending two CIL materials together with different ratios, which offered us the opportunity to design a binary CIL with excellent electron extraction ability and high electron transport ability. Based on the findings, homo-junction tandem OSCs with a high Voc of up to 2.39 V was obtained by introducing a binary interlayer into the interconnecting layer, which is the highest Voc among reported double junction tandem solar cells, further demonstrating its practical application in solar-energy-driven water splitting. This study guides the design of CIL materials for large-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors. Besides, the binary interlayer offers a new strategy to extend the application of neat CILs and helps to develop efficient and thick CILs for printed large area non-fullerene OSCs.
