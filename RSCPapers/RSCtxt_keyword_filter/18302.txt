    , Accepted 29th May 2014First published on 3rd June 2014AbstractA series of organic sensitizers based on different configurations such as D–π–A, D–[π]n–A, D–π–[A]n, [D]n–π–A, D–π–A–π–D, D–π–[A]n–π–D and D–[π–A]n–π–D (where n = 1–4) are designed using theoretical methods. The effects of repeating π-linker, donor–acceptor moieties and the substitution of additional donor–acceptor moieties on the optoelectronic properties have been addressed. Our results show that the strength of the acceptor units changes the mono band absorption into dual band absorption in all the considered strategies. We found that repeating π-linker/donor moieties in the D–π–A series enhances the intensity of the absorption and can tune their absorption spectra from UV-to-visible and visible to near IR regions by repeating acceptor units. Also, the present results indicate that the D–π–A–π–D configuration shows improved optical properties than the conventional D–π–A structure. This theoretical study explores the new configurations and design strategies of organic dyes for developing efficient light harvesting devices working in the whole visible and near IR regions.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been considered as an alternative to the conventional silicon based devices in the generation of energy, which is one of the most important tasks in the 21st century.1–4 In recent years, it has been proved that the structure and electronic properties of the sensitizers determine the performance of the DSSCs and hence designing efficient sensitizers is one of the emerging topics for researchers in the development of DSSC.5 A typical sensitizer must have a broad and intense absorption band in the visible and near IR regions. Also, it should have improved optoelectronic properties and most importantly it should ensure efficient electron injection into the semiconductor surface.6–8 A number of sensitizers based on Ru-complexes,9,10 metal free organic dyes11–14 and porphyrin4,15,16 are proposed in the literature and their optoelectronic properties have been studied using both experimental and theoretical methods.
In recent years, metal-free organic dyes featuring intermolecular charge transfer transitions have been attracting considerable attention owing to their high molar extinction coefficients, abundance of raw materials, flexibility of their molecular design and low cost device fabrication.17–19 Generally, these metal free organic dyes consist of an electron donor (D) and an electron acceptor (A) at two ends which are connected by a π-bridge (π) and are denoted as D–π–A; this structure allows an effective intramolecular charge transfer during photoexcitation. Over the last couple of years, enormous progress has been made in designing efficient organic sensitizers, thus increasing the overall power conversion efficiency close to 11%.7,20–24 Even though these D–π–A type organic dyes show excellent spectral properties, they tend to form aggregates on the semiconductor surface.25,26 Dye aggregation suppresses electron transport from the excited dye molecule to the semiconductor surface resulting in low performance of DSSCs.
Generally, dye aggregation can be reduced by introducing bulky substituents or by the bridging of two chromophores into a basic structure.27,28 Also, Holmes et al. reported in their study that using a nonlinear structure and long aliphatic chains in the sensitizers avoids dye aggregation.29 Considering this herein, we proposed and designed a new series of sensitizers based on different configurations such as D–[π]n–A, D–π–[A]n, [D]n–π–A, D–π–[A]n–π–D and D–[π–A]n–π–D (where n = 1–4) and studied their optical and energetic properties using theoretical methods. For this, we considered triphenylamine (TPA) as the donor part and 9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene (F) as the π linker. Recent studies have shown that TPA is a good functional group in the electron donor part and it reduces dye aggregation due to its non-planar structure.13,30–33 Also, it is well known that the acceptor group plays an important role in the optoelectronic properties of the dyes.5 Thiophene (T) and dicyano-methylene cyclopentadithiophene (CDM) are well known acceptors and have been widely used as acceptors in the sensitizers.4,34,35 In order to know the acceptor effects, we considered T and CDM as two different acceptors (A1 and A2 respectively) to construct the above different configurations. The molecular structures of the donor, π linker and acceptors considered in this study are shown in Fig. 1.

2. Computational details
In the present study, the ground state geometries of all the D–π–A series were fully optimized based on the DFT method using the Becke's three-parameter functional and the correlation functional of Lee–Yang–Parr (B3LYP) together with a standard 6-31G* basis set.36,37 The consistency of the B3LYP method with the 6-31G*basis set for the investigation of organic dyes has been widely reported in various studies.38–40 All of the calculations have been performed without any symmetry constraints. Frequency calculations were performed at the same level of theory to confirm that the optimized geometry corresponds to the minimum energy in the potential energy surface. The time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) has been used to calculate the optoelectronic properties of these designed dyes. In order to choose a reliable functional for TD-DFT calculations, we have performed benchmark calculations for the recently synthesized triphenylamine based organic dyes P1B, P2B41 and TC142 using different DFT functionals such as M062X,43 M06HF,44,45 ωB97XD,46 CAM-B3LYP47,48 and B3LYP and also using a semi-empirical method such as ZINDO.49 The polarizable continuum model (PCM) method was used to simulate the solvent environment, for comparing with the experimental data.50,51 Table S1 (ESI†) presents a comparison between calculated absorption wavelengths using different functionals and experimental data for P1B, P2B and TC1 dyes. It can be seen from this table that Truhlar's hybrid functional M062X and semi-empirical method ZINDO predict the absorption wavelengths of these reference dyes very close to the experimental values41,42 with an average deviation of 15 and 10 nm, respectively, which is smaller than the generally accepted upper limit required for the design of new dyes. The calculation using the M062X method for all the designed dyes might be time consuming and resource expensive, since in the present work we considered many cases which contain too many atoms. Moreover, previous studies of Nemukhin et al. reported52–54 the success of the ZINDO method in predicting the transition energies. Also, we have calculated absorption energies for some of our designed dyes using the M062X/6-31G* method and the calculated values are given in Table S2 of ESI.† We found that the calculated values based on the ZINDO method are slightly red shifted (∼35 nm) compared to those based on the M062X method. Therefore, on the basis of the above results, we chose the ZINDO method for further calculation of the absorption wavelengths and intensities of the 20 lowest-energy electronic transitions of all the designed sensitizers. These will be transformed, using the SWizard program,55 into simulated spectra using Gaussian functions with half-widths of 3000 cm−1. In addition to this, density of states (DOS) for all the designed dyes were calculated using the GaussSum 2.2.5 program.56 Also, we have calculated the light harvesting efficiency (LHE) of the designed dyes using the formulaLHE = 1 − 10−fwhere f is the oscillator strength of the designed dyes corresponding to the wavelength. All of the above calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 package.57
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Spectral properties of simple D–π–A1 and D–π–A2 sensitizers
The UV/vis spectra of D–π–A1 and D–π–A2 sensitizers were simulated by single point calculations using the ZINDO method based on the optimized structures at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. The simulated UV-vis spectra and the corresponding features for the main peak of the spectra of these sensitizers are presented in Fig. 2 and Table 1, respectively. As can be seen from this figure, the UV-visible spectrum of the D–π–A1 sensitizer possesses mono band absorption characteristics, i.e., a strong absorption band in the UV region (λ = ∼360 nm), whereas D–π–A2 has dual band characteristics, which shows absorption bands in both UV (∼390 nm) and visible regions (∼810 nm). Further, we noticed that the substitution of a strong acceptor moiety (i.e. in the case of D–π–A2) leads to a red-shift in the UV absorption band and generation of a visible absorption band. In general, the absorption bands manifested by either intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the donor and acceptor units along with a π–π* transition, or the reorganization of molecular orbitals to generate easily accessible low- and high-lying energy levels spread across both donor and acceptor units. In this dual-band absorption spectrum, the UV and visible absorption bands are frequently attributed to low-energy ICT transition and high-energy π–π* transition, respectively. With the aid of the isodensity plots of the frontier MOs (see Fig. S1, ESI†) all the ICT and π → π* transitions presented in Table 1 can be easily identified. In order to use these sensitizers in light-harvesting devices, the features of UV-visible absorption spectra of these sensitizers should be tuned. To be specific, both the UV-visible bands of these sensitizers should cover the visible-to-near IR region and their intensity should be increased to ensure an efficient light absorption. To achieve this, we modified the basic D–π–A structure by means of different configurations and the designed sensitizers will be tested for DSSC applications.

3.1.1. Effect of repeating the π-linker in D–π–A. 
It is well known that the spectral properties of the dyes could be enhanced by increasing the π-conjugation length. Moreover, previous studies have shown that extending the π-linker leads to an increase in the overall efficiency of the dyes.11,58–60 Therefore, to improve the spectral properties, we increased the π-conjugation length of the designed dyes (D–[π]n–A, where n = 1–4) and also considered the effect of two different acceptors (A1 and A2) on the spectral properties. The designed dyes (D–[π]n–A1 and D–[π]n–A2, where n = 1–4) are optimized using the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The simulated UV/vis absorption spectra of these dyes using the ZINDO method are presented in Fig. 3 and the corresponding transition data are summarized in Table 2. All the ICT and π → π* transitions presented in Table 2 are easily identified using the isodensity plots of the frontier molecular orbitals (MOs) (Fig. S2 and S3, ESI†). From Table 2, we see that the absorption spectra of these series of sensitizers correspond to combined contribution of ICT and π → π* transitions. By looking at Table 2, it is clear that the use of 9,9-dimethyl-9H-fluorene as π-linker with its increasing unit number significantly increases the π → π* contribution compared to the ICT contribution; for instance, in the D–[π]n–A1 series, the ICT transition decreased from 61% to 32% and the contribution of π → π* transitions increased as the length of π-linker increased from n = 1 to 4. Similar trends have also been observed for D–[π]n–A2 sensitizers. When n = 1, all the electronic transitions of D–[π]n–A2 belong to ICT, whereas when n is increased from 2 to 4, the π → π* transitions are generated and the extent of these transitions becomes stronger. Furthermore, another prominent absorption band in the visible region (800 nm) was observed for the D–[π]n–A2 series of sensitizers, which corresponds to the ICT and remains almost constant when the number of π-linker is increased. Fig. 3 clearly shows that, rather than the bathochromic shift of the absorption spectra, only hyperchromic shifts are observed when increasing the π-linker units.

To gain insight into the effect of extending the π-linker on optoelectronic properties, we plotted the DOS pattern for both D–[π]n–A1 and D–[π]n–A2 sensitizers and the plots are shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). It has been noticed that, the extension of π-linker in both D–[π]n–A series leads to a small decrease in their band gaps (i.e., from 3.52 to 3.32 eV in D–[π]n–A1 and from 1.68 to 1.63 eV in D–[π]n–A2). This may be the reason for the absence of bathochromic shift in their optical spectra. It is interesting to note that the substitution of a strong acceptor (A2) lowers the LUMO level significantly (from −1.6 to −3.4 eV), which indicates that the use of a strong acceptor unit helps to reduce the band gap of a given D–[π]n–A sensitizer. The above results indicate that, extending the number of π-linker units significantly increases the π → π* contribution compared to the ICT contribution. This will significantly increase the shorter wavelength absorption intensity only (340–420 nm: mostly contains π → π* transition) whereas the absorption intensity at longer wavelengths remains almost constant (800 nm: mostly contains ICT transition). Hence, this strategy is probably suitable for applications which mostly utilize π → π* transitions.


3.1.2. Effect of repeating the acceptor unit in D–π–A. 
The designed dyes such as D–π–[A1]n and D–π–[A2]n (where n = 1–4) are optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory and optoelectronic properties are obtained using the ZINDO method. The simulated UV/vis absorption spectra of D–π–[A1]n and D–π–[A2]n sensitizers are shown in Fig. 4 and the corresponding absorption energies, oscillator strength, and electronic transition configurations to the lowest singlet excited state are given in Table 3. The results show that the absorption spectra of both the sensitizers are red shifted to higher wavelengths with a simultaneous increase in their intensity and light harvesting efficiency when the number of acceptor unit is increased. In the D–π–[A1]n series, we found a significant shift of absorption spectra from the UV to visible region (364 to 515 nm) along with a small increase in their absorption intensities. On the other hand, the D–π–[A2]n series show characteristic absorbance bands in both the shorter and longer wavelength regions and these are red shifted to the respective longer wavelengths (i.e., UV to visible and visible to near IR region) along with a significant increase in their absorption intensity when n is increased from 1 to 4. This dual band absorption is not observed for the D–π–[A1]n series and this behavior is probably due to the substitution of a strong acceptor unit. All the ICT and π → π* transitions presented in Table 3 are easily identified using the isodensity plots of the frontier MOs (see Fig. S5 and S6, ESI†). As can be seen from Table 3, the absorption bands of the D–π–[A1]n series in the 364–515 nm region are mainly contributed by the ICT transition of H → L, in which their absorption intensity values are increased (i.e. f value from 1.62 to 1.87) with the increase in the number of acceptor unit (n = 1–4). This effect is found to be stronger when a strong acceptor unit (i.e. CDM) is used, as evidenced in the D–π–[A2]n series.

Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the DOS pattern of the D–π–[A1]n and D–π–[A2]n sensitizers with increasing acceptor units. It can be clearly seen from this DOS that the extension of acceptor unit in both the series leads to a significant decrease in their band gaps, i.e., from 3.48 to 2.83 eV in D–π–[A1]n and from 1.68 to 1.21 eV in D–π–[A2]n. Also, the substitution of a strong acceptor (A2) lowers the LUMO level more compared to that achieved with the weak acceptor (A1), which indicates that the use of a strong acceptor unit helps to reduce the band gap of a given D–π–[A]n sensitizer. Moreover, this result confirms that the LUMO levels of the organic sensitizers are more sensitive to acceptor units. Furthermore, the extension of acceptor units causes an increase in the number of states in both HOMOs and LUMOs and their subsequent energy locations get closer to each other. This effect is more intense when a strong acceptor is used (see Fig. S7, ESI†). From the above results we found that this strategy not only leads to a red shift in the absorption spectra, but also increases the absorption intensity and LHE considerably. The extension of the weak acceptor unit could easily tune their absorption spectra from the UV-to-visible region and subsequently increase their intensities; this effect becomes much stronger when a strong acceptor unit is used. Also, this strategy increases the ICT contributions of the absorption spectra and significantly decreases their band gaps. Therefore, this could be suitable for light-harvesting applications, such as DSSCs, which mostly require a strong ICT transition and a small band gap with wide and strong visible absorption spectra.7


3.1.3. Effect of repeating the donor unit in D–π–A. 
Recently, Promarak et al.61,62 synthesized 2D-π–A and 2D-D–π–A type of organic dyes and found that increasing the electron donating unit leads to improved optical performance compared to the conventional D–π–A structure in support of other studies.63,64 Based on these results, we have also designed [D]n–π–A (where n = 1–4) type of organic sensitizers and studied their optical performance using theoretical methods. The simulated UV/vis absorption spectra of [D]n–π–A1 and [D]n–π–A2 sensitizers are shown in Fig. 5 and the corresponding absorption energies, oscillator strength, and electronic transition configurations to the lowest singlet excited state are given in Table 4. It has been noticed that increasing the electron donating group does not improve the UV/vis absorption spectra of both series of sensitizers. As can be seen from the MO diagram, the charge transfer from donor units to the acceptor unit after excitation will be inefficient because of the conjugation length and this will reduce the electron injection efficiency of the sensitizers.

3.2. Optoelectronic properties of D–π–A–π–D
Besides the conventional D–π–A based sensitizers, there are also special structures like D–π–A–π–D configurations based on the metal free organic sensitizers. Previously, Hua et al.65 synthesized such type of organic sensitizers and reported conversion efficiency of only less than 3%. This low photovoltaic performance may be due to their selection of inefficient acceptor (carboxylic acid) and π-linker (diketopyrrolopyrrole) moieties. In order to check our selected D, π, A combinations, we designed such D–π–A–π–D configurations and optimized them using the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The computed absorption energies, oscillator strength, and electronic transition configurations of D–π–A1–π–D and D–π–A2–π–D sensitizers using the ZINDO method are given in Table 5. Fig. 6 presents the simulated UV/vis absorption spectra of D–π–A1–π–D and D–π–A2–π–D with their conventional D–π–A structures. As can be seen from Fig. 6 and Table 5, these two sensitizers show a significant redshift in their spectra and an increase in their intensities as well as LHE compared to D–π–A structures. In the D–π–A1–π–D structure, the absorption band is red shifted from the UV region (360 nm) to the visible region (415 nm), whereas both UV and visible absorption bands of the D–π–A2–π–D sensitizer are significantly red shifted to visible and near-IR regions, respectively. Further, the ICT contributions are enhanced considerably in the D–π–A–π–D configuration compared to the D–π–A. The above results show that the use of D–π–A–π–D like structures is more important than that of D–π–A in terms of enhancement of their ICT contributions, significant red-shift in the absorption spectrum and simultaneous increase in their absorption intensity. We expect that these sensitizers could be potential candidates for optoelectronic devices such as OLEDs.

3.2.1. Effect of repeating the acceptor unit in D–π–A–π–D. 
From the above discussion, it should be clear that the extension of the acceptor moiety enhances the optical properties compared to the extension of the π linker. Hence, here we extended the acceptor unit in this configuration and studied their optoelectronic properties. The D–π–[A]n–π–D (where n = 1–4) configuration is designed and optimized using the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. The calculated optoelectronic properties and simulated UV/vis absorption spectra using the ZINDO method are given in Table 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. It has been observed that the absorption spectra of both the D–π–[A]n–π–D series are red-shifted to a longer wavelength with increasing acceptor units. The absorption spectra of the D–π–[A1]n–π–D sensitizer are found to be red-shifted from the UV to visible region (400 to 555 nm) with a small increase in their absorption intensities, whereas in the D–π–[A2]n–π–D series, we found a significant change in their absorption spectra as well as in their intensity, which is due to the substitution of a strong acceptor. With the aid of the isodensity plots of the frontier MOs (Fig. S8 and S9, ESI†), all the ICT and π → π* transitions presented in Table 6 are identified. It has been observed that the absorption spectra of the D–π–[A1]n–π–D series are mainly due to the ICT transition and this contribution becomes stronger when a strong acceptor unit (i.e. CDM) is introduced. Fig. S10 (ESI†) presents the DOS patterns of the D–π–[A]n–π–D series with increasing acceptor units. It clearly indicates that extending the acceptor units leads to a decrease in the band gap values (from 2.99 to 2.28 eV in D–π–[A1]n–π–D and from 1.40 to 1.17 eV in D–π–[A2]n–π–D), resulting in a redshift in their absorption spectra. Compared to the D–π–[A]n configuration, the D–π–[A]n–π–D series of sensitizers have better absorption properties (i.e., absorption bands are in visible and near IR regions) along with higher ICT contributions, which are highly essential for DSSC applications.7

3.2.2. Effect of repeating π-linker and acceptor units in D–π–A–π–D. 
Here we extend both π-linker and acceptor units simultaneously in order to tune the optoelectronic properties of the sensitizers. The designed configurations D–[π–A]n–π–D (where n = 1–4) are optimized using the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory. Table 7 summarizes the details of electronic transitions of the D–[π–A1]n–π–D and D–[π–A2]n–π–D sensitizers and the simulated UV/vis spectra are shown in Fig. 8. From this we found that the extension of π–A units together in the D–[π–A1]–π–D series could shift the spectra only very little (415 to 445 nm), but it enhances the absorption intensities in the visible region enormously (i.e. f value from 2.31 to 5.41). This large increase in absorption intensities was not observed in the strategies considered so far and hence this series of sensitizers might be a potential candidate which will be used to harvest light in the 400–500 nm region. In the D–[π–A2]n–π–D series, we observed a substantial increase in absorption intensities only in the shorter wavelength regions (400–450 nm) and in the longer wavelength regions, the increase in intensity was small. Here also, we noticed the dual band absorption characteristics in the D–[π–A2]n–π–D series, which is due to the substitution of a strong acceptor. As can be seen from the MO plots of D–[π–A]n–π–D sensitizers (Fig. S11 and S12, ESI†) and Table 7, the extension of the π–A unit increases both ICT and π → π* contributions and this is reflected in the strong increase in UV band intensities (mostly contributed by π → π* transitions) and visible-to-near IR band intensities (mostly contributed by ICT transitions). The DOS pattern of the D–[π–A]n–π–D sensitizers shows that the extension of π–A can decrease the HOMO–LUMO gap very little compared to the other configurations. From the above results, we found that the extension of the π–A unit in this series of sensitizers prominently improves the absorption intensity compared to other configurations.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have designed the organic sensitizers with different configurations such as D–π–A, D–[π]n–A, D–π–[A]n, [D]n–π–A, D–π–A–π–D, D–π–[A]n–π–D and D–[π–A]n–π–D (where n = 1–4) and the effects of acceptor strength on their optoelectronic properties are tested extensively using theoretical methods. The important highlights of our study are as follows:
(1) The substitution of a strong acceptor moiety changes the mono band absorption into dual band in all the considered strategies.
(2) In the D–π–A series, repeating π-linker and donor moieties enhances only the intensity of the absorption, whereas when acceptor units are repeated; the weak acceptor unit shifts the absorption spectra from 364 to 515 nm with a slight increase in their intensities and the strong acceptor shifts the absorption spectra at both shorter and longer wavelengths into higher regions together with a significant increase in their intensities. This strategy will be useful for designing sensitizers to harvest sunlight from UV to near IR regions for the DSSCs.
(3) The introduction of an additional donor group (D–π–A–π–D) enhances both absorption spectra and ICT contributions compared to the conventional D–π–A structure. This strategy will be useful for the spectra engineering in designing LEDs and UV/vis light absorbers.
(4) The extension of the weak acceptor unit in the D–π–A–π–D series red shifts the absorption spectra in the shorter wavelength regions (from 415 to 545 nm) with a slight increase in their intensities and the substitution of a strong acceptor shifts the absorption spectra in the longer wavelength regions to near IR regions along with a significant increase in their intensities.
(5) We found that the extension of both π–A units in the D–[π–A]–π–D series prominently improves the absorption intensity compared to other configurations and this series of sensitizers might be useful to harvest light in the 400–500 nm region.
This theoretical study provides a deeper understanding of the effect of π-conjugation and extension of acceptor moieties on the absorption properties of the designed organic dyes. We hope this study will be useful to improve the efficiency of organic sensitizers used in the DSSCs.
