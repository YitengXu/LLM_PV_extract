    , Accepted 20th February 2019First published on 21st February 2019AbstractHybrid organic–inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as a low-cost, high-efficiency photovoltaic technology; however, the device performance seriously depends on interfacial properties between each contact layer. The interface plays an important role in PSCs as it induces defects, trap states, charge recombination sites etc., which are detrimental to the device performance and stability. Herein, a post-treatment of self-assembling large cations of tert-butylammonium (tBA) on the surface of the perovskite layer is demonstrated as an effective strategy to passivate interface and grain boundary defects and thus improve device performance and stability. In particular, a normal hysteresis is turned into an inverted hysteresis by increasing the amount of tert-butylammonium iodide (tBAI), which can be ascribed to modified interface states. An impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 20% with a significantly suppressed hysteresis is achieved via the careful control of post-treatment conditions, which shows great promise for commercialization in the future.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have recently emerged as intriguing photovoltaic materials due to their high absorption coefficient, long charge-carrier diffusion length, and high carrier mobility.1–5 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has experienced rapid development during the past decade and has been boosted up to 23%. This has been realized by various improvements such as fabrication process development, component modulation, interface passivation and charge transporting material optimization.6–12 However, their commercialization is still restricted by the difficulty of upscaling fabrication, as well as insufficient long-term stability.
The presence of surface defects in perovskite polycrystalline thin films is a serious problem for the large scale fabrication of perovskite devices.13 These surface states facilitate non-radiative charge recombination at the interfaces which are harmful to device efficiency and also initiate the degradation of perovskite structures.14 Basically, the passivation of defects in perovskites is proved to be an effective engineering method for improving device performance of PSCs.14,15 To date, various passivation additives such as small molecules, polymers, metal ions, cations, anions, etc. have been employed to passivate the defects at the surface, bulk or gain boundary in perovskites.16–19 Chiang et al. utilized phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) to fill pinholes and vacancies between perovskite grains and achieved a high-quality perovskite layer.20 Abdi-Jalebi et al. and our previous report both indicated that potassium ions can efficiently passivate the perovskite interface and result in the elimination of hysteresis.17,21 In addition, Yang et al. also suggested that the addition of iodide decreases the concentration of deep-level defects of perovskites and consequently results in a certified PCE of 22.1%.6
Selective growth of two-dimensional (2D) stacking layers such as n-butylammonium (BA),22 phenylethylammonium (PEA),23 and octylammonium (OA)24 onto three-dimensional (3D) perovskites have been widely applied to improve the stability of PSCs. However, the introduced long chains may inevitably impede charge injection from the perovskite material to the electron transport layer (ETL) or hole transport layer (HTL). A solution based post-treatment to induce secondary growth of perovskite via an Ostwald ripening process is a promising way to passivate the perovskite defects and improve the device stability. Yang et al. demonstrated a post-treatment that spin-coats the MABr solution onto perovskite to improve its film quality and thus enhance the efficiency and stability.25 In addition, Luo et al. used large cations of guanidinium (GA) to reduce surface traps and mitigate nonradiative recombination. An increase of 100 mV in Voc and a record efficiency over 21% for inverted PSCs were achieved after surface passivation.26 Pham et al. also reported the passivation of the perovskite surface by using GA thiocyanate assisted Ostwald ripening growth.27
Herein, we demonstrate a novel post-treatment using large cations of tert-butylammonium (tBA) to modify the as-deposited Cs0.05(FA0.85MA0.15)0.95Pb(I0.85Br0.15)3 (CsFAMA) perovskite films. The post-treatment using the tert-butylammonium iodide (tBAI) solution is proved to effectively reduce the trap density at the surface of the perovskite layer. Accordingly, the post-treated device shows an improved PCE of 20.12% compared to the reference device (19.32%). In addition, the common hysteresis phenomenon is also suppressed after the tBAI treatment. Our results suggest that the post-treatment with large cations has great potential for obtaining high quality perovskite layers and for further commercialization of PSCs.
Results and discussion
The schematic representation of the post-treatment with a tBAI/isopropanol (IPA) solution on the surface of perovskite films is shown in Fig. 1a. The CsFAMA perovskite films were first deposited on the FTO/SnO2 substrate using a green anti-solvent of ethyl acetate. After the annealing treatment, the tBAI/IPA solution was then spun onto the perovskite surface, followed by a re-annealing process. The perovskite films treated with tBAI solution are a darker color compared with the pristine film, as seen from Fig. S1,† which indicates the formation of a self-assembling layer after post-treatment. The tBA cation is an isomeride of BA, which possesses a shorter chain length, but its size is still larger than that of the FA cation. Because it is slightly above the upper limit of the tolerance factor, tBA cations can be considered as a partial substituent in organic cations to form a 3D perovskite structure. As the BA cation can induce a 2D structured perovskite film, a layered surface structure appeared obviously even when a low concentration of BAI/isopropanol solution was employed (Fig. S2†). However, perovskite films treated with the tBA cation show a similar morphology compared to the 3D perovskite films even at a high concentration (5 mg mL−1) of the tBAI/isopropanol solution (Fig. 1b). Besides, it can also be seen that with the increased amount of tBAI, the PbI2 fragments are obviously reduced and purer and more uniform perovskite films are obtained. Therefore, a small amount of tBA may be incorporated into the perovskite surface 3D structure. However, when the perovskite surface is treated with a high concentration of 10 mg mL−1, a new phase appears at the grain boundary which can be ascribed to the formation of tBAPbX3 (X= Br, I) due to the large tBA cation.28

To further investigate the microstructure of perovskite films, X-ray diffraction (XRD) was conducted to compare the films before and after the tBAI post-treatment (Fig. 2a). There is no new diffraction peak observed in perovskite films treated with a lower concentration of tBAI solution. In contrast, some new diffraction peaks corresponding to the 2D layered perovskite emerge in the perovskite films treated with BAI solution, as shown in Fig. S3.† In addition, the residual PbI2 peak diminishes after the tBAI post-treatment, and the typical (110) peak of the perovskite film exhibits an obvious left-shift as a function of the tBAI concentration (Fig. 2b), indicating that a small amount of tBAI has reacted with PbI2 and been incorporated into the 3D perovskite structure, as shown in the schematic in Fig. 3a. When the amount of tBAI further increases to 20 mg mL−1, an obvious peak at ∼7.2° belonging to the 1D tBAPb(IxBr(1−x))3 compound appears (Fig. S4†). Furthermore, grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was also conducted to probe the crystallinity and orientation of the perovskite films with and without surface modification (Fig. 3b and d).29 All diffraction patterns exhibit clear isotropic rings, which means that there is random orientation of perovskite crystal grains. The BA treated film (Fig. 3c) shows discrete Bragg spots in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction indicating the formation of the 2D perovskite phase. However, there is no new scattering peak observed in the tBAI treated perovskite film (Fig. 3d). The tBAI treated perovskite film shows more cambered scattering signals compared to the pristine films (Fig. 3b) which indicates enhanced crystallinity without a significant change in the orientation of crystal grains. The X-ray diffraction results also confirm the incorporation of the large tBA cation into the perovskite surface crystal.

In addition, optical properties of the pristine and tBAI treated perovskite films are investigated as shown in Fig. 4a. To show the difference in the spectra of the perovskites, an enlarged image is shown in Fig. 4b, where a slight red-shift is found with increasing amounts of tBAI. The slight red-shift of the UV-Vis spectra could be ascribed to the iodide introduced by the tBAI post-treatment, which is also confirmed by the corresponding PL spectra (Fig. 4c). This post-treatment process has been proved to be an effective method of suppressing the surface and grain boundary defects with enhanced carrier lifetime.30–32 The time resolved PL (TRPL) spectra of perovskite films treated with different concentrations of the tBAI solution are presented in Fig. 4d. Notably, a significantly increased PL lifetime is observed in the perovskite films after proper tBAI surface treatment, indicating reduced defects and suppressed charge recombination (for the lifetime fitting details please refer to Table S2†).26,33 In addition, the TRPL spectra of the pristine and 3 mg mL−1 tBAI treated perovskite films with Spiro-OMeTAD layers are also recorded to evaluate the charge separation ability (Fig S6†). A reduced lifetime of the tBAI treated perovskite film with the Spiro-OmeTAD layer demonstrates efficient hole extraction at the interface (Table S3†).34

To characterize the impact of post-treatment of the tBAI on the perovskite device performance, PSCs are fabricated with a structure of FTO/SnO2/PCBM/CsFAMA/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in Fig. 5a. Fig. 5b shows the corresponding cross-sectional SEM image of the tBAI treated device with the different layers of (i) FTO, (ii) compact SnO2/PCBM, (iii) CsFAMA perovskite, (iv) Spiro-OMeTAD, and (v) Au, respectively. The photovoltaic characteristics and the distribution of Voc, Jsc, fill factor (FF) and PCE from 15 cells for the pristine and tBAI treated devices are plotted in Fig. 5c, and the corresponding detailed parameters are showed in Table S1.† All the devices are tested with both reverse scan and forward scan under 1 sun AM 1.5G illumination with an aperture area of 0.16 cm2. They exhibit an increase in Voc from 1.069 V for the pristine cell to 1.090 V for the champion cell treated with 3 mg mL−1 tBAI solution under reverse scan (RS), and a more obvious Voc increase is observed under forward scan (FS) from 1.019 V to 1.083 V. This increased Voc can be attributed to the surface passivation after the tBAI post-treatment.33,35 The incorporation of large cations into the perovskite film minimizes surface defects, thus suppressing the charge recombination at the interface. The average Jsc experiences an increase after the proper tBAI treatment, confirmed by the corresponding EQE spectra in Fig. S5.† The increased current density can be the result of the reduced PbI2 residues and slightly enlarged absorption range. A significant increase in FF and a reduced hysteresis are also found in the device with the proper tBAI post-treatment. However, with the further increase of the tBAI concentration, the Voc and Jsc of the devices dramatically decrease. As the concentration of the tBAI solution is above 3 mg mL−1, tBAI cannot fully react with the perovskite film. The residual tBAI on the surface of the perovskite and the formation of the pure tBAPbX3 phase exert negative effects on the charge injection from the perovskite film to the hole transport material. In addition, the FF under RS decreases much faster than that under FS. An inverted hysteresis is found in the devices treated with higher concentrations of tBAI. The hysteresis index (HI) of the devices treated with different amounts of tBAI is plotted in Fig. 5d, and their corresponding typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. S7.† A significant decrease in hysteresis after the proper tBAI treatment can be ascribed to the improved film quality and reduced surface defects. The mechanism for the inverted hysteresis after excess tBAI treatment is still under investigation. Some reports suggest that the inverted hysteresis can be ascribed to the charge/ion accumulation and recombination at interfaces in the PSC.36,37 Thus it may be caused by the barrier of the unreacted tBAI residuals.

(c) The distribution of Voc, Jsc, FF and PCE of different amount of tBAI solution treated perovskite solar cells. And (d) the corresponding hysteresis index derived from the typical J–V curves of different amount of tBAI solution treated perovskite solar cells. 
The photovoltaic characteristics of the champion devices with and without tBAI post-treatment are listed in Table 1, and the typical J–V curves are shown in Fig. 6a. The tBAI treated champion device achieved a high PCE of 20.12%, with a Voc of 1.128 V for RS and 1.124 V for FS, a Jsc of 22.78 mA cm−2 for RS and 22.77 mA cm−2 for FS, and a FF of 0.78 for RS and 0.79 for FS. The pristine device without treatment shows a lower PCE of 19.32% and a larger hysteresis index (HI) of 0.09. Fig. 6b shows the EQE spectra of corresponding perovskite devices. The integrated photocurrent densities are 21.90 mA cm−2 and 21.81 mA cm−2 for perovskite devices with and without post-treatment, respectively, which perfectly match with the Jsc measured from the J–V curves. The corresponding steady-state output current densities at the maximum power point of the devices are shown in Fig. 6c. The tBAI treated perovskite device not only shows a very stable power output but also an extremely fast photo-response compared to devices without post-treatment. This rapid photo-response reflects more efficient charge extraction in the post-treated devices compared to that in the pristine devices. Furthermore, the long-term stability of the tBAI treated devices is also remarkably enhanced compared to that of the pristine devices as devices are stored under ambient air conditions with 20% RH without encapsulation over 1000 hours (Fig. 6d). Therefore, the application of a post-treatment method for passivating the perovskite absorber greatly improved both the PCE and stability of perovskite solar cells.

The interface plays an important role in charge recombination.16,38 To further understand the charge recombination mechanism after post-treatment, light intensity dependent measurements are carried out on these devices as well. The open circuit voltage is dependent on the light intensity with a kT/q slope as shown in Fig. 7a. The PSC with interface passivation shows a slope of 1.43 kT/q, which is much lower than that of the non-passivated device (1.68 kT/q). It indicates substantially reduced trap-assisted recombination. We also measured photocurrent density under different light intensities to study bimolecular recombination under short circuit conditions (Fig. 7b). The current density of both devices shows a linear dependence on the light intensity in logarithmic coordinates with a slope of 1.0, indicating negligible bimolecular recombination. Fig. 7c shows the Mott–Schottky (M–S) plots of these perovskite solar cells at a proper frequency of 10 kHz.39 The post-treated PSC presents an increased built-in potential (Vbi) of 0.93 V compared with the 0.91 V for the non-treated device, which indicates fast charge collection and transportation. In addition, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique is also employed to evaluate the electron trap densities of perovskite films with or without tBAI treatment. The typical J–V curves of the electron only devices with an architecture of FTO/PCBM/perovskite/PCBM/Au were recorded in the dark as shown in Fig. S8.† The calculated electron trap densities of perovskite films after tBAI treatment decreased from 1.79 × 10−16 cm−3 to 1.66 × 10−16 cm−3, indicating the reduced defects with tBAI treatment.

(e) The contact resistance (Rct) and (f) recombination resistance (Rrec) of devices at different biases. 
In addition, we also conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement, which is considered as a useful technique to reveal underlying carrier transport behaviors in the PSC.40,41 The Nyquist plots of the devices with and without interface passivation are obtained under AM 1.5G with an applied bias voltage of 1.0 V which is close to the Voc, as shown in Fig. 6d. The high frequency component is related to the charge transport resistance (Rct) of cells, and the low-frequency component corresponds to the charge recombination resistance (Rrec) occurring at the interfaces.42–44 The main difference between these devices is the interface between the perovskite layer and the HTL. Therefore, the slightly lowered Rct (23 Ω cm2) obtained by numerical fitting of the tBAI treated device compared to the pristine device (24 Ω cm2) indicates that fast charge extraction occurs at the passivated interface. The numerically fitted Rrec (20 Ω cm2) is much higher compared to that of the pristine devices (8 Ω cm2), which indicates less recombination after interface passivation. In addition, the fitted Rct and Rrec are plotted with respect to the different applied forward biases as shown in Fig. 6e and f, respectively. The value of Rct in the interface passivated perovskite decreases as a function of the applied voltage. The Rrec is much higher compared to that of the pristine one even at different bias voltages. Therefore, the EIS data clearly show the improved charge transport and reduced recombination in perovskite devices with the interface tBAI passivation.
Conclusion
In summary, we perform a post-treatment via self-assembling large cations of tBA on the perovskite surface, which not only improves the device performance but also enhances the stability. This post-treatment enables incorporation of large cations into the perovskite crystal structure and thus passivates the surface and grain boundary defects. The proper treatment of the perovskite surface with tBAI solution results in an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) approaching 20.12%, which is much higher compared to that of the non-treated device (19.32%). It also shows a suppressed hysteresis compared to the pristine devices, which can be ascribed to the fast charge transport and reduced charge recombination. Therefore, this simple post-treatment strategy shows great promise for future commercial application.
