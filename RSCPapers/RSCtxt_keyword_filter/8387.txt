    , Accepted 28th March 2016First published on 29th March 2016AbstractMethylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3) has made a re-entry into the literature nowadays for its extraordinary characteristics, such as high absorption of light, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, low trap-state density, low surface recombination velocity and ease of attainment. Here, we report a self-powered photodetector based on a CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal by employing asymmetric Au–Al electrodes. The key issue of this photodetector was the metal–semiconductor contacts, owing to the Schottky junction between them. By setting the channel length between the Au–Al electrodes to 30 μm for sufficient electron–hole pair separation and transportation, the device showed good performance under 1 sun illumination. The short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit voltage were 6.86 mA cm−2 and 0.7 V, respectively. The photocurrent was almost 2 orders of magnitude larger than that based on a perovskite polycrystalline film with a similar device structure. More importantly, the device could detect the lowest noticeable incident power density down to 1 × 10−8 W cm−2. Under this weak light intensity, the responsivity was as high as 0.24 A W−1 without any bias. The photoresponse also had a broadband ranging from 375 nm to 808 nm accompanied by a fast response speed.
1 Introduction
Photodetectors with fast response speed and high responsivity in broadband spectra have always attracted people's attention for their extensive applications in areas such as biological sensing, camera imaging, missile warning, and communication.1–4 In the past few years, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have almost induced a revolution in the field of optoelectronics. The outstanding characteristics of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites such as the appropriate direct band gap,5 large absorption coefficient,6 long carrier diffusion length,7,8 and high charge carrier mobilities9,10 make it possible for them to exhibit extraordinary optoelectronic properties. Firstly, perovskites have boosted the rapid development of solar cells11,12 since Tsutomu Miyasaka et al. used a perovskite material for a dye-sensitized solar cell as a light-absorbing material.13 Then, lead halide perovskites have also been used to fabricate high-performance photodetectors. Park et al. first reported large photocurrent multiplications in methylammonium lead iodide perovskite (MAPbI3), which proved the possibility of its application in photodetectors.14 Yang et al. demonstrated a perovskite photodetector which has a similar structure to a classic sandwiched solar cell. This perovskite photodetector exhibited the ability to detect weak signals, in a linear dynamic range of over 100 dB, and a fast photoresponse with a 3 dB bandwidth up to 3 MHz.15 The performance of this novel photodetector was already better than most reported organic or quantum dot photodetectors. What’s more, it was comparable to some traditional photodetectors based on inorganic semiconductors. Subsequently, Xie et al. made a robust flexible perovskite photodetector.16 A high-speed and broad-spectrum photoresponse was achieved by simply depositing a MAPbI3 film on a flexible substrate. Huang et al. reported a solution-processed perovskite photodetector which showed a high photoconductive gain and a broad spectral response ranging from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region.17 This perovskite photodetector worked as a photodiode in the dark. It showed a large photoconductive gain under illumination due to trapped-hole-induced electron injection. Importantly, they pointed out that the gain of the photodetector was influenced by the MAPbI3 layer thickness and achieved the maximum when the thickness was between 360–410 nm. To enhance the responsivity in broadband spectra, more efforts have been made, such as development of a photodetector combining MAPbI3 with graphene,19 narrow band photodetection using MAPbClxBr3−x (ref. 20) and incorporating photovoltaic function into photodiodes.21
Besides, the MAPbI3 materials applied in photodetectors come in a wide variety, including films,15–18 nanowires22,23 and single crystals.24,25 Most studies so far are based on thin films because of their facile access. Due to their polycrystalline nature, problems such as instability, defects, and relatively low carrier mobilities were obvious. Although MAPbI3 nanowires prepared by a modified evaporation-induced self-assembly provided an opportunity to study low dimensional devices, the performance of the nanowire-based photodetector was not good enough in terms of either the responsivity (R = 1.3 A W−1) or the response time (0.3 ms).23 Single crystals can make up for many deficiencies. A lot of efforts have been made to reduce the defect density of a perovskite film by increasing the crystalline quality, in other words, increasing the grain size. In this regard, the ultimate solution would be to use a single crystal. More and more attention has been paid to the perovskite bulk single crystal since its growth was first reported by Tao and co-workers in 2015.26 The perfect characteristics of the perovskite bulk single crystal stimulate widespread interest. Shi et al. found a low trap-state density on the order of 109–1010 per cubic centimeter in MAPbX3 single crystals which was comparable to that of the best photovoltaic-quality silicon. The charge carrier diffusion lengths exceeded 10 micrometers.27 Yang et al. reported that the surface recombination velocity in CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite single crystals was 3.4 ± 0.11 × 103 cm s−1, almost 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than those in many important unpassivated semiconductors, measured by broadband transient reflectance spectroscopy.28 Dong et al. observed that the charge carrier diffusion lengths in MAPbI3 single crystals could exceed 175 μm under 1 sun illumination.29 Meanwhile, in polycrystalline MAPbI3 films, the diffusion lengths were shorter than 1 μm.8 These exciting results all indicate that a better performance can be expected in an optoelectronic device based on a perovskite single crystal. Our group has fabricated a photodetector on the (100) facet of a MAPbI3 single crystal with a responsivity of 953 A W−1 and an external quantum efficiency of 2.22 × 105% at 1 V with 532 nm light of 2.12 nW cm−2 irradiance.24 We have also reported a self-powered device by integrating a MAPbI3 single crystal photodetector with a triboelectric nanogenerator.25 The photodetector exhibited a large responsivity of 196 V mW−1 cm−2 and a wide detection range from 10 μW cm−2 to 100 mW cm−2. This self-powered photodetector was actually driven by the triboelectric nanogenerator rather than itself.
Generally speaking, the key issue in making a photodetector is to establish an electric field to separate electron–hole pairs which are produced by absorbing incident light. The most common way is applying an external bias.30–32 It's easy to achieve and the response can be adjusted by changing the bias. On the other hand, a built-in field would be more interesting, energy saving as well as easy to be integrated with other devices. To make a built-in field, the p–n junction,33,34 p–i–n junction35,36 and Schottky junction37,38 were usually implemented. Among these, the Schottky junction stands out due to its facial preparation and higher current saturation density. The recent emergence of a new approach to make a Schottky junction by using asymmetric electrodes is fascinating for it is simple and efficient to attain. The asymmetric electrodes (Ti–Pt) prepared on a MoS2 film elucidated the Schottky barrier formation which showed a highly rectifying behavior through the source-drain current.39 Yoo et al. fabricated a photodetector by directly integrating PbS quantum dot–P3HT quantum dot hybrid nanowire (NW) arches into Au–Al electrodes.40 The photodetector showed a high sensitivity and fast response time in the UV to NIR range. To the best of our knowledge, an absolutely self-powered photodetector based on a MAPbI3 single crystal has not been reported yet.
In this work, we proposed a self-powered MAPbI3 single crystal photodetector by using Au–Al asymmetric electrodes to make a built-in field. Through simple metal deposition on the perovskite single crystal, this self-powered photodetector could work under ambient air and the responsivity could reach as high as 0.24 A W−1 without any bias. It showed a broadband response ranging from 365 to 808 nm. Additionally, the self-powered device also showed a satisfactory response speed.
2 Experimental
2.1 Crystal growth and device fabrication
In this work, the perovskite single crystal was grown by a reported method.26 Briefly, Pb(Ac)2(H2O)3 (99.5%, Sinoreagent) and CH3NH2 (40 wt% aqueous solution, Aladdin) were dissolved in HI (57 wt% aqueous solution, Acros Organics) separately. By mixing the PbI2 solution and CH3NH3I solution at a high temperature to get a homogenous solution, and by slowly cooling it down to room temperature, black CH3NH3Pb3I single crystals can be attained. Au and Al were deposited on the smooth face of the single crystal with a channel of 30 μm length and 4 mm width, using a designed mask.
2.2 Measurements
XRD data of the ground single crystal were collected by X-ray diffraction (Bruker D8-Advance) using Cu Kα radiation. The transmission spectrum was measured with a Lambda 950 UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the MAPbI3 single crystal photodetector were measured with a digital Sourcemeter (Keithley 2400) under dark and illuminated conditions. A solar simulator (xenon lamp, Oriel, AM 1.5G light) was used for adjustable illumination. Photoresponse measurements were performed with a laser equipped with a manual monochromator. The spot diameter of the laser hit on the device was 1 mm. The wavelength of each laser was 1064 nm, 808 nm, 785 nm, 633 nm, 532 nm, 405 nm and 375 nm. The incident powers were measured by a set of optical power meters. Different filters were used to achieve weak light below 10−5 mW cm−2. The electrical signals were collected by a Keithley 2400 Sourcemeter. The photoresponse speed of the device was measured by an optical chopper and a precision source/measure unit (Agilent B2911A).
3 Results and discussion
The phase structure of the as-grown CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal was characterized by powder X-ray diffraction as shown in Fig. 1a. The sharp peaks are consistent with the reported results,26 confirming the high purity of the crystal. The inset in Fig. 1a shows the bulk crystal obtained from solution growth. A more detailed structure analysis of this crystal can be found in our previous work.24 As shown in the UV-visible absorption spectra in Fig. 1b, the perovskite exhibits a broad range of light absorption from the ultraviolet to the near infrared range. The absorption band edge at 830 nm illustrates that the crystal has a direct band gap of 1.49 eV.

The asymmetric electrodes are the key components in making the Schottky junction, as schematically exhibited in Fig. 2a. We constructed the device by depositing Au and Al on the surface of the perovskite single crystal. Utilizing a special mask, a channel width of 30 μm between Au and Al can be attained. As reported by Dong and coworkers, the diffusion lengths in MAPbI3 single crystals could exceed 175 μm under 1 sun illumination.29 To let the electron–hole pairs separate and transfer as much as possible, we chose a reliable distance of 30 μm, which is far less than 175 μm. In this circumstance, the interface between the metal and the semiconductor is where the Schottky barrier occurs. The Schottky barrier was closely related to the work function of the metal and the electron affinity of the semiconductor. In other words, the electrons moved from the conduction band minimum of the semiconductor to the metal in contact (the holes moved from the valence band maximum to the metal in contact) to get a balanced Fermi level. In this work, we chose the suitable metals Al (work function −4.3 eV)41 to form a high barrier and Au (work function −5.1 eV)42 to form a low barrier, as schematically shown in Fig. 2b. Accordingly, an electric field from Au to Al is built in the device.

To assess the performance of this built-in electric field, the J–V characteristics of the device were measured in air under AM 1.5G solar irradiation and in the dark. As shown in Fig. 3a, the typical J–V curves of the single crystal device were measured. The short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) were calculated to be 6.86 mA cm−2, 0.7 V, 16.5%, and 0.79%, respectively. In comparison with typical sandwich solar cells, the FF and PCE are relatively low. This may be caused by the difficult carrier transmission without a hole and electron transport layer. As the cost of simple fabrication and the limitation of Schottky junction solar cells, the low FF and PCE are not surprising. Meanwhile, the Jsc and Voc indicate the effective separation of carriers in the single crystal under illumination. This also proves the possibility of making a self-powered photodetector. The J–V characteristics of a similarly structured device based on a polycrystalline film were also measured for comparison. The Voc is 0.72 V, similar to the value obtained in the single crystal device. However, the short circuit photocurrent density is only 0.023 mA cm−2, almost 2 orders of magnitude lower than the Jsc in the single crystal device. This significant reduction was attributed to the existence of defects and grain boundary in the MAPbI3 film, which hindered the diffusion of carriers and made the generated electron–hole pairs recombine easily.

As previously mentioned, the key issue of the driving force was the contacts between the metal and the semiconductor. Without any bias and illumination, a positive space charge caused the band to bend upward. After applying a bias, the electrons crossed the barriers from the semiconductor to the metal, forming an opposing current. In this route, the electrons need to transfer through the depletion region of the perovskite. The movement was controlled by the diffusion and the electric field in the barrier. With a positive voltage, the decreased recombination rate of the electron–hole pairs would increase the free carrier density. The movement of electrons or holes was promoted to form a high current. A negative voltage exhibited the opposite effect. Under illumination, the incident light induced the generation of electron–hole pairs. Owing to the high absorption and large carrier mobilities of the MAPbI3 perovskite, the photocurrent was kind of considerable.
Due to the presence of a built-in electric field, the generated electrons and holes transported to different electrodes, resulting in a photocurrent without any external bias. Thus, the device can act as an excellent self-powered photodetector except for a normal Schottky junction solar cell. To study the performance of this photodetector, two key parameters responsivity (R) and external quantum efficiency (EQE) were measured, as shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively. The detector was tested at 0 V bias under an 808 nm laser. The whole test was performed in ambient air at room temperature. The responsivity can be defined as follows:  where IL is the photocurrent when the light is on, ID is the dark current when the light is off, P0 is the irradiance power density and S is the effective illuminated area. The spectral responsivity describes the photoelectric conversion efficiency. The external quantum efficiency is described as the electrons generated divided by the incident photons. The ability of photodetectors is also a very important issue to consider. The external quantum efficiency can be defined as:  where R is the responsivity, h is Planck's constant, c is the velocity of light, e is the electron charge, and λ is the wavelength of incident light.

The light source was an 808 nm laser and all measurements were performed without any bias. (c) A comparison of photoresponses based on Au–Al electrodes and Au–Au electrodes. 
In this work, the responsivity of the device at 808 nm was tested in the range of 1 × 10−8 W cm−2 to 0.038 W cm−2. The lowest noticeable incident power density of the detector is 1 × 10−8 W cm−2, as shown in Fig. 4a. Under this weak light intensity, the responsivity is as high as 0.24 A W−1. Although the responsivity is not as high as that reported in our previous work, it should be pointed out that the working mechanisms of the two photodetectors are absolutely different. Correspondingly, the EQE is 36.16% (Fig. 4b). When the light intensity increased to 0.038 W cm−2, the R decreased to 2.32 × 10−4 A W−1. Particularly, it should be pointed out that the S was the illuminated spot area rather than the channel area (30 μm in length and 4 mm in width) here. In comparison with the asymmetric structure, the photoresponse of the device with symmetric Au–Au electrodes was also measured, as shown in Fig. 4c. The test was performed under 808 nm with a light intensity of 1 mW cm−2. It was obvious that without any bias, the symmetric Au–Au device had no response in photodetection, while the asymmetric device had a photocurrent on/off ratio of ∼20, which fully proved that the self-driving force was derived from the asymmetric structure. It also verified that 30 μm was appropriate in consideration of an excellent photocurrent yield.
The device has shown a good response to the 808 nm laser under different light intensities as discussed above. To reveal the influence of wavelength on the device, we measured the photoresponse in the range of 375 nm to 1064 nm under 1 mW cm−2. The wavelength of irradiation was adjusted by using a different semiconductor laser. Limited to the kind of laser, the wavelengths during the measurements were 1064 nm, 808 nm, 785 nm, 633 nm, 532 nm, 405 nm and 375 nm, respectively. It's obvious that under 1064 nm, the device had no response. Given the fact that the absorption band edge is at 830 nm, as discussed in Fig. 1b, the movement of the valence electrons to the conduction band occurred when the incident light was at 830 nm. This supported the minimum photo energy which can be absorbed. When the wavelength of the incident light was beyond 830 nm, such as 1064 nm in this work, the perovskite had no response. Under the same conditions, the device exhibited different efficiencies at different wavelengths. Fig. 5a shows the spectral responsivity directly. The device had the highest photocurrent at 808 nm. However, the R demonstrated a clearer efficiency with respect to the wavelength, as shown in Fig. 5b. The device showed a good broadband response from 375 nm to 808 nm. Additionally, with the increase in wavelength, the responsivity improved. It is worth noting that Xie et al.16 observed different results, which showed a better response at 365 nm. They attributed this phenomenon to the fact that the incident light with a short wavelength has a larger energy which results in more electron–hole pairs, which then contribute a larger photocurrent under the same bias. To understand the wavelength dependence of the responsivity observed in this work, we may consider the mechanism of photodetection, which generally starts from the generation of electron–hole pairs. In the range of high absorption, i.e. 500 nm to 830 nm as observed in Fig. 1b, every photon absorbed is expected to generate one electron–hole pair. If we assume that the quantum efficiency is constant, there are more photons generated in the case of a longer wavelength. Therefore, the responsivity increases with wavelength, as seen in Fig. 5b. Furthermore, it can be observed that the response is not saturated at lower wavelengths, as shown in Fig. 5a. Accordingly, the responsivity exhibits an even stronger dependence at lower wavelengths, as seen in Fig. 5b.

To further characterize the response speed of the self-powered CH3NH3PbI3 single crystal photodetector, the transient photocurrent response without any bias was measured. A 532 nm laser with a light intensity of 1.8 mW cm−2 was used as the incident source in combination with a 1 kHz chopper. As shown in Fig. 6, the rise and decay time (defined as the time taken from the initial photocurrent to 80% increase and decrease) were calculated to be 71 μs and 112 μs, respectively. The fast response speeds were comparable to the results of previously reported perovskite photodetectors.17,24,43

4 Conclusions
In summary, the first absolutely self-powered organolead halide perovskite single crystal photodetector based on asymmetric electrodes was demonstrated. Remarkably, the device showed a broadband response to light of wavelengths ranging from 375 nm to 808 nm. Additionally, the device had the best efficiency at 808 nm considering the incident photo energy and the depletion region built at the conducting surface. We also demonstrated that this device with Au–Al electrodes had a good response. The responsivity was 0.24 A W−1 at the lowest noticeable incident power density of 1 × 10−8 W cm−2. This photodetector also exhibited a fast rise and decay time of 71 μs and 112 μs, respectively. The MAPbI3 single crystal photodetector with asymmetric electrodes reported in this work might open up an avenue for the applications of organolead halide perovskite materials in self-powered optoelectronic devices.
