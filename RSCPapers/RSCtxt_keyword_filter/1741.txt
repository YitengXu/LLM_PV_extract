    , Accepted 1st October 2017First published on 3rd October 2017AbstractDouble bond π-bridges were introduced into an A–D–A structured n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) IDT-IC and a new n-OS acceptor SJ-IC was synthesized. In comparison with IDT-IC, the SJ-IC film shows significantly red-shifted absorption, improved electron mobility and tuned crystallinity, which make its blend film with a polymer donor easier to form appropriate phase separation. The polymer solar cells with polymer J61 as a donor and SJ-IC as an acceptor demonstrated a higher PCE of 9.27% with a higher Jsc of 16.99 mA cm−2, while the device based on J61/IDT-IC only delivered a PCE of 6.95% with a Jsc of 13.70 mA cm−2, which should be ascribed to the red-shifted and broadened absorption of SJ-IC. Therefore, inserting double bond π-bridges into n-OS acceptor molecules is a simple and effective way to broaden and red-shift their absorption to improve their photovoltaic performance. In addition, the near-infrared absorption of the SJ-IC acceptor should be beneficial to its future application in semitransparent and tandem PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn increasing attention because of their unique advantages of light weight, flexibility and low production cost.1 PSCs are composed of a blend active layer of a p-type conjugated polymer as a donor and a fullerene derivative (such as PCBM) or an n-type organic semiconductor (n-OS) as an acceptor, sandwiched between a transparent bottom electrode and a top metal electrode. At present, owing to the development of novel donor and acceptor materials and device optimization, PSCs have exhibited power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 11%.2 Especially, considerable efforts have been devoted to developing non-fullerene (NF) n-OS acceptors in recent years due to their advantages of easy tuning of absorption, electronic energy levels and low voltage loss.3,4 To date, through rational design, a variety of n-OS acceptors have been synthesized, such as n-OSs based on rylene diimide,5–9 calamitic shaped small molecules with discrete separation of electron-rich and electron-deficient units (A–D–A-type),3,10–12 and small molecules based on diketopyrrolopyrrole.13–15 By selecting donors that possess complementary absorption spectra and matching electronic energy levels with n-OS acceptors, PCEs were boosted to 8–13% for PSCs.16–22 Meanwhile, manipulating the absorption and frontier orbital energy levels of the existing n-OS acceptors via chemical modifications is of critical importance for enhancing the short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc), respectively, which could enhance the PCEs of PSCs.
Among the n-OS acceptors, A–D–A structured molecules such as ITIC,23 IDIC,24etc. possess narrow energy bandgaps, strong absorption and suitable LUMO and HOMO energy levels, and PSCs with A–D–A molecules as acceptors demonstrated high photovoltaic performance. In order to further improve the photovoltaic properties of n-OS A–D–A molecules, a lot of efforts have focused on manipulating the central fused donor unit,25 side-chains of the donor unit26 and modifying the electron deficient (A) units27 to tune their absorption, electronic energy levels19 and degree of crystallinity.28 However, few reports concern the π-bridge between the donor and acceptor units of A–D–A n-OS molecules.12,29 Actually, the π-bridges in D–A structured conjugated polymers and organic molecules play an important role in extending the conjugation, tuning the absorption, electronic energy levels and crystallinity of photovoltaic materials.30
Among various chemical modifications, insertion of double bonds into π-conjugated systems has been demonstrated to be a simple and effective strategy to modulate electronic properties, which can effectively extend the conjugation length and increase the degree of electron delocalization, according to the molecular orbital theory.31 In addition, in push–pull (D–A) systems, double bonds can result in a pronounced increase in the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect from the electron-rich core (D) unit to the electron-deficient (A) unit,30a all of this is helpful to reduce the energy bandgap and red-shift the absorption spectrum of the corresponding molecules.32 In addition, for small molecule n-OS acceptors, the crystallinity greatly influences the performance of the device, and large crystalline domains in BHJ films lead to large phase separations and reduced exciton diffusion/separation efficiencies.24 So, tuning the crystallinity of n-OS acceptors also is important for improving the PCEs of PSCs. And insertion of double bonds can eliminate torsional interactions between donor and acceptor rings, effectively reducing space resistance, tuning the crystallinity of molecules and benefitting intermolecular arrangements.33 Considering the effect of double bonds on the molecular structure and physicochemical properties of conjugated organic molecules, in this work, we insert double bond π-bridges into the A–D–A n-OS molecule of IDT-IC25 and synthesize a new n-OS molecule SJ-IC (see Fig. 1) in order to further extend the conjugation of the molecule and regulate the absorption and crystallinity of the molecule.

Results and discussion
Theoretical calculation
In order to compare the chemical geometry and π electronic structures of the two molecules of IDT-IC and SJ-IC, calculations with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level were performed. Simulated molecular geometries (Fig. S5 in the ESI†) show that both the molecules have a flat structure and the introduction of double bonds has little effect on the planarity of the molecule. The calculated LUMO and HOMO electronic density distributions of the two molecules are also shown in Fig. 1a, which reveals that the double bond π-bridges in SJ-IC lead to a larger conjugated system. Fig. S6 in the ESI† shows the absorption spectra of IDT-IC and SJ-IC calculated with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level. It can be seen that the absorption spectrum of SJ-IC is ca. 80 nm red-shifted in comparison with that of IDT-IC, due to the insertion of the double bond π-bridges. The results indicate that the double bond π-bridge in SJ-IC is beneficial to increasing the electronic couplings for the terminal π–π stacking dimers, and may be advantageous for improving charge transport.34 Actually, a typical example for extending the absorption of conjugated polymers by inserting double bonds is poly(3-hexylthienylene vinylene) (P3HTV)35 in comparison with poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). The absorption edge of the P3HTV film is red-shifted to ca. 750 nm compared to that (ca. 650 nm) of the P3HT film due to the insertion of the double bonds.
Synthesis and thermal stability
The synthetic route to SJ-IC is shown in Fig. 1b. The introduction of the double bond in the monomer IDT-CHO to form SJ-CHO was accomplished by reaction with tributyl(1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)phosphonium bromide and NaH at room temperature, and the excess NaH was quenched with 10% HCl. Then the Knoevenagel condensation of SJ-CHO with 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydroinden-1-ylidene)-malononitrile afforded the new n-OS acceptor SJ-IC. The synthesis details of SJ-IC are described in the Experimental section. The thermal stability of SJ-IC was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The TGA plot of SJ-IC (see Fig. S7 in the ESI†) shows a decomposition temperature at 5% weight loss (Td) of 333 °C, which indicates that the thermal stability of SJ-IC is good enough for application in PSCs.
Absorption spectra

Fig. 2a and b show the absorption spectra of IDT-IC and SJ-IC in chloroform solution and in the film state, respectively. It can be seen that the absorption spectra of SJ-IC both in solution and in the film state are significantly red-shifted and broadened in comparison with those of IDT-IC, indicating that introducing double bond π-bridges is an effective way to broaden the absorption of n-OS acceptors. In chloroform solution, SJ-IC displays a strong absorption in the wavelength region of 560–800 nm with a peak at 720 nm, which is red-shifted by 65 nm relative to that of IDT-IC. Compared to its solution, the absorption spectrum of the SJ-IC film exhibited a 57 nm red-shift with an absorption onset of 833 nm, corresponding to an optical energy bandgap (Eoptg) of 1.49 eV (Eoptg = 1240/λedge) which is 0.23 eV lower than that (1.72 eV) of IDT-IC (Table 1). The broader and near-infrared (NIR) region absorption spectra of SJ-IC would be beneficial to harvest more sunlight and enhance the photovoltaic performance of the PSCs with the n-OS as the acceptor.

Electronic energy levels and electron mobility
The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the SJ-IC film were measured by electrochemical cyclic voltammetry36 with Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode and a Fc/Fc+ couple as an internal reference. The onset potentials of oxidation and reduction of SJ-IC were measured to be 1.25/−0.42 V vs. Ag/AgCl, respectively, from its cyclic voltammogram as shown in Fig. 2c. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of SJ-IC were calculated to be −5.61 and −3.94 eV, respectively, according to the equation: EHOMO/LUMO = −e(Eox/red + 4.36) (eV). (Redox potential of Fc/Fc+ is 0.44 V vs. Ag/AgCl in our measurement system, and we take the energy level of Fc/Fc+ as 4.8 eV below vacuum.) In comparison with IDT-IC, the HOMO level of SJ-IC was shifted upward by 0.08 eV while the LUMO was downshifted by 0.06 eV (Table 1). The electrochemical bandgap (Eecg) of SJ-IC is 1.67 eV according to its LUMO and HOMO energy levels.
The electron mobilities of the two compounds were measured by using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method with the electron-only device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al. The measurement results are shown in Fig. S8 in the ESI,† and the calculated electron mobilities of IDT-IC and SJ-IC are 1.94 × 10−4 and 5.73 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. Obviously, the introduction of the double bond π-bridges in the A–D–A structure of IDT-IC improved the electron mobility.
Photovoltaic properties
To investigate the effect of introducing the double bond π-bridges into SJ-IC on its photovoltaic properties, we fabricated PSCs with our previously reported polymer J61 (its molecular structure is shown in Fig. 1c) as the donor18 and SJ-IC as the acceptor with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J61:acceptor/PDINO/Al. The energy level diagram of the components of the PSCs is shown in Fig. 2d. The optimized device fabrication conditions include a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 and with thermal annealing at 160 °C for 2 min.

Fig. 3a shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the optimized devices under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, and the photovoltaic performance data are listed in Table 2 for a clear comparison. The PSC based on J61/SJ-IC (1:1, w/w) without thermal annealing delivered a PCE of 7.48% with a Voc of 0.85 V, Jsc of 16.12 mA cm−2, and FF of 54.44%, while the optimized devices with thermal annealing at 160 °C for 2 min demonstrated a PCE of 9.27% with a Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 16.99 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.95%. The device based on J61/IDT-IC (1:1, w/w) with thermal annealing at 160 °C for 2 min delivered a PCE of 6.95% with a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 13.70 mA cm−2, and FF of 57.30%. The significantly higher Jsc of 16.99 mA cm−2 for the SJ-IC-based device than that (13.70 mA cm−2) of the device based on IDT-IC could be ascribed to the red-shifted and broadened absorption of SJ-IC in the wavelength region of 750–850 nm. But, the relatively lower Voc should be due to the down-shifted LUMO energy level of the SJ-IC acceptor. Obviously, the introduction of double bond π-bridges into A–D–A n-OS acceptors would be a simple and effective way to enhance the Jsc of PSCs.

The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the two PSCs with SJ-IC and IDT-IC as acceptors are shown in Fig. 3b. The IPCE values in the shorter wavelength range of 300–580 nm should be attributed to the absorption of the polymer donor in the active layer. The photoresponse in the longer wavelength range of 630–850 nm should be ascribed to the contribution of the acceptor component. Especially, the strong IPCE values in the wavelength region from 740 to 850 nm indicate that the SJ-IC has a higher ability to capture photons in the near infrared region, which confirms the contribution of the broad absorption of SJ-IC to the higher Jsc of the PSCs with SJ-IC as the acceptor. The calculated Jsc from the integration of the IPCE spectrum with the AM1.5G reference spectrum is 16.73 mA cm−2, which agrees very well with the Jsc value (16.99 mA cm−2) from J–V measurements with only 1.5% mismatch.
To probe the exciton/charge separation dynamics, we measured the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) of the optimized devices, as shown in Fig. 3c. The Jph values reach saturation (Jsat) at 2 V, suggesting that all the charges are collected by the electrodes. The charge separation probability can be calculated from Jph/Jsat values, which are 0.991 and 0.945 for the PSCs based on J61:SJ-IC and J61:IDT-IC, respectively, implying that the overall exciton dissociation and charge collection processes all are quite efficient for the SJ-IC- and IDT-IC-based PSCs.
We also measured the Jscversus light intensity (P) curves to study charge recombination behavior (Fig. 3d). The relationship between Jsc and P can be described as Jsc ∝ Pα. While α < 1 means the existence of bimolecular charge recombination and α = 1 indicates that there is no bimolecular charge recombination.37 The α values of the PSCs with SJ-IC and IDT-IC as acceptors are 0.98 and 0.95, respectively, indicating that the bimolecular charge recombination is weak in the two PSCs, especially there is very weak bimolecular recombination in the PSCs based on J61:SJ-IC.
The charge carrier mobilities of the active layers were measured and estimated using the SCLC method. The hole and electron mobilities were measured with the hole-only device of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Au and the electron-only device of ITO/ZnO/active layer/PDINO/Al, respectively. The measurement results are shown in Fig. S9 in the ESI,† and the mobility data are listed in Table 2 for a clear comparison. The hole (μh)/electron (μe) mobilities of the J61:SJ-IC blend film are 1.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/3.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the as-cast blend film and 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/6.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the annealed blend film. The μh/μe values of the J61:IDT-IC film are 4.85 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1/1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the annealed film. Apparently, after thermal annealing, the electron mobility of the J61:SJ-IC blend film increased from 3.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 6.29 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was about four times of that (1.60 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) of J61:IDT-IC, and the hole mobility also obviously increased from 1.43 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.10 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The significantly improved electron mobility may be responsible for the increased FF (65.9%) of the SJ-IC-based device in comparison with that (57.3%) of the IDT-IC-based device.
Morphology characterization
The ordering of acceptor neat films and BHJ thin films was studied with grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements. Fig. 4 shows 2-D diffraction images and the corresponding line-cut profiles of the films. In the neat film, SJ-IC showed a weak crystalline feature, without sharp diffraction peaks (Fig. 4a and c). A broad (100) diffraction at 0.38 A−1 was seen without much orientation preference. Its crystal coherence length (CCL) from the in-plane diffraction profile was estimated to be 3.7 nm, corresponding to a couple of lamellae stacks. A broad diffusive diffraction was seen at 1.45 A−1, corresponding to the average intermolecular distances. No clearly defined π–π stacking peak could be observed. IDT-IC showed quite good diffraction ordering features (Fig. 4b and c). A well-defined (100) diffraction was seen at 0.35 A−1 with a CCL of 13.4 nm (in-plane direction), and a sharp (010) diffraction peak was seen at 1.81 A−1 (0.35 nm inter-distance) with in-plane preference. Thus by comparison, the IDT-IC acceptor is much more prone to crystallization in the neat film. The introduction of the π-bridge increases the structural complexity and decreases the crystallinity of the molecule.

GIXD images of (g) annealed J61/SJ-IC blend films and (h) J61/IDT-IC, and (i) line cuts of the GIXD images of the annealed J61/acceptor blend films. 
The GIXD images of BHJ blends display the polymer packing feature. As seen from Fig. 4e and f for the as-cast SJ-IC based BHJ film, the in-plane diffraction showed a broad peak at 0.25 A−1, which is comprised of diffraction features of both the donor polymer and SJ-IC, and the donor polymer played a more significant role. The polymer π–π stacking can be seen clearly in the out-of-plane direction at 1.74 A−1, with a CCL of 2.2 nm. The IDT-IC based BHJ thin film showed strong IDT-IC diffraction features. The polymer (100) diffraction peak is located in the same region as that of the IDT-IC (001) diffraction peak. After thermal annealing (see Fig. 4g–i), the structural features of the SJ-IC-based BHJ blend films changed largely. A quite sharp polymer (100) diffraction can be seen in the SJ-IC-based BHJ thin film at 0.24 A−1 with a CCL of 9.8 nm. Adjunct to that was the SJ-IC peak with a weak intensity. A sharp polymer π–π stacking peak can be seen in the out-of-plane direction at 1.75 A−1 with a CCL of 3.5 nm. While the thermal annealing had less effect on the IDT-IC-based blends. As seen from the IDT-IC (100) and polymer (100) diffraction peaks, the crystal coherence length increased from 6.0 nm to 6.6 nm, and from 6.0 nm to 6.8 nm, respectively, after thermal annealing. But no sharp polymer face-on π–π stacking could be observed. These differences in morphology reveal quite different physical properties for these two acceptor materials.
It should be mentioned that SJ-IC is less crystalline and its interaction with the polymer is of some difference from that of IDT-IC without the double bond π-bridges. The too strong crystalline feature of IDT-IC makes it the dominating component in the BHJ blends. Thus when thermal annealing is applied, the crystallization of the polymer donor is retarded. For SJ-IC, the amorphous acceptor molecules could be easy to mix with the polymer donor in the as-cast blend. Then thermal annealing leads to quick demixing of the SJ-IC molecules from the polymer mixture and results in the polymer crystallization, which leads to the improvement of hole mobility (see Table 2). At the same time, the crystallization of the polymer donor could also improve the purity of the acceptor domain. In addition, the double bond π-bridge in SJ-IC has a profound effect on the electronic structure of the molecules, which favors the improvement of its electron mobility. Therefore thermal annealing could strongly improve the transport properties of the SJ-IC BHJ blends, leading to the improved device fill factor and efficiency.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed for investigating the effect of the acceptor materials and thermal annealing treatment on the morphologies of the active layers of the PSCs. The AFM height images, as shown in Fig. 5, display a root mean square (RMS) roughness of 0.83 nm and 1.20 nm for the J61:SJ-IC films, and 1.26 nm and 1.36 nm for the J61:IDT-IC films with and without thermal annealing, respectively. The smaller RMS values of the J61:SJ-IC film and the decreased RMS values with thermal annealing may be ascribed to the reduced size of the phase separation in the blend active layers, which is beneficial to improve the photovoltaic performance.

Conclusions
Double bond π-bridges were introduced into A–D–A n-OS molecules for obtaining near-infrared n-OS acceptors. Under this strategy, a new n-OS acceptor SJ-IC was synthesized by inserting double bond π-bridges into the n-OS molecule IDT-IC. The SJ-IC film shows a significantly red-shifted absorption with an absorption edge at 833 nm corresponding to a narrow bandgap (Eg) of 1.49 eV in comparison with the absorption edge at 720 nm with an Eg of 1.72 eV for IDT-IC. Furthermore, insertion of the double bond π-bridge improved the electron mobility and tuned the crystallinity of the molecules, which makes the BHJ film easier to form appropriate phase separation. The PSC with a medium bandgap polymer J61 as a donor and SJ-IC as an acceptor with a D/A weight ratio of 1:1 demonstrated a higher PCE of 9.27% with a Voc of 0.83 V, Jsc of 16.99 mA cm−2, and FF of 65.95%, while the device based on J61/IDT-IC (1:1, w/w) only delivered a PCE of 6.95% with a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 13.70 mA cm−2 and FF of 57.30%. The significantly higher Jsc of 16.99 mA cm−2 for the SJ-IC-based device than that (13.70 mA cm−2) of the IDT-IC-based device should be ascribed to the red-shifted and broadened absorption of SJ-IC. Therefore, we can conclude that inserting double bond π-bridges into n-OS acceptor molecules is a simple and effective way to broaden and red-shift their absorption, regulate the crystallinity and molecular accumulation and improve their photovoltaic performance. In addition, the near-infrared absorption of the acceptor should be beneficial to its future application in semitransparent and tandem PSCs.

Materials
All chemicals and solvents were purchased from J&K, Alfa and TCI Chemical Co. IDT-CHO was bought from Solarmer Company. J61 was synthesized according to the literature.2

Synthesis of SJ-CHO. 
To a solution of the mixture of IDT-CHO (1.0 equiv.) and tributyl(1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)phosphonium bromide (1.1 equiv.) in anhydrous tetrahydrofuran was added sodium hydride (60% dispersed in mineral oil, 3.0 equiv.) under an argon gas atmosphere, and the resulting turbid solution was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. After completion of the reaction, the excess NaH was quenched using 10% HCl solution under cooling and the reaction mixture was brought to acidic pH and stirred at room temperature for 4–5 h. The contents in the reaction flask were concentrated and the organic contents were extracted into ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water followed by brine, dried using anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to dryness to afford the crude aldehyde which after purification by silica-gel column chromatography using dichloromethane gave the product as a yellow solid in excellent yields (89%).

Synthesis of SJ-IC. 
To a three-neck round-bottom flask were added SJ-CHO (203 mg, 0.2 mmol), 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (279 mg, 1.4 mmol), chloroform (50 mL), and pyridine (1 mL). The mixture was deoxygenated with nitrogen for 30 min and then refluxed for 12 h. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into methanol (200 mL) and filtered. The residue was purified by column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether/dichloromethane (1:1) as eluent, yielding a dark green solid (234 mg, 86%).

Measurements. 

1H-NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer with d-chloroform as the solvent and trimethylsilane as the internal reference. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry was performed on a Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation, in an acetonitrile solution of 0.1 mol L−1n-Bu4NPF6 at a potential scan rate of 100 mV s−1 with an Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a platinum wire counter electrode. The film morphology was measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM, Bruker-ICON2-SYS) in the tapping mode. The RMS values of the surface AFM images are averaged based on five-time testing on different areas for each sample.


Theoretical calculations. 
Molecular simulation was carried out at the DFT B3LYP/6-31G(d, p) level with the Gaussian 03 program package.


Device fabrication and characterization. 
The PSCs were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/active layer/cathode. A thin layer of PEDOT:PSS was deposited through spin-coating on precleaned ITO-coated glass from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution (Baytron P VP AI 4083 from H. C. Starck) at 2000 rpm and dried subsequently at 150 °C for 15 min in air. Then the device was transferred to a nitrogen glovebox, where the active blend layer of J61 polymer and SJ-IC (or IDT-IC) was spin-coated from its chloroform solution onto the PEDOT: PSS layer at a spin-coating rate of 2800 rpm. After spin-coating, the active layers were annealed at 160 °C for 2 min for the devices with thermal annealing treatment. The thickness of the active layers is ca. 120 nm. Then a methanol solution of PDINO at a concentration of 1.0 mg mL−1 was deposited atop the active layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s to afford a PDINO cathode buffer layer with a thickness of ca. 10 nm. Finally, the top Al electrode was deposited in a vacuum onto the cathode buffer layer at a pressure of ca. 5.0 × 10−5 Pa. All film thicknesses were measured by using an Alpha-Step D-500 surface profilometer. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the PSCs were measured in a glovebox on a computer-controlled Keithley 2450 Source-Measure Unit. An Oriel Sol3A Class AAA Solar Simulator (model, Newport 94023A) with a 450 W xenon lamp and an air mass (AM) 1.5 filter was used as the light source. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 by using a Newport Oriel 91150V reference cell. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured by using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3-011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd., Taiwan). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photovoltaic cell. An optical microscope (Olympus BX51) was used to define the active area (4.7 mm2) of the device. All the masked and unmasked tests gave consistent results with relative errors within 0.5%. The Jsc values obtained by integrating the IPCE values with the AM1.5G solar spectrum agreed well with the measured value within 5% mismatch. All the device measurements were performed in a nitrogen glovebox (O2 < 0.1 ppm, H2O < 0.1 ppm). For the J–V measurement, the voltage step and delay time were 10 mV and 1 ms, respectively. The scan started from −1.5 V to 1.5 V.


Mobility measurements. 
Hole and electron mobilities were measured using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method. Device structures are ITO/PEDOT:PSS/J61:SJ-IC IDT-IC (1:1, w/w)/Au for hole-only devices and ITO/ZnO/J61:TT-IC IDT-IC (1:1, w/w)/PDINO/Al for electron-only devices. The SCLC mobilities were calculated by using the Mott–Gurney equation:1  where J is the current density, εr is the relative dielectric constant of the active layer material usually 2–4 for organic semiconductors, herein we use a relative dielectric constant of 4, ε0 is the permittivity of empty space, μ is the mobility of holes or electrons, L is the thickness of the active layer and V is the internal voltage of the device, and V = Vapp − Vbi, where Vapp is the voltage applied to the device and Vbi is the built-in voltage resulting from the relative work function difference between the two electrodes (in the hole-only and electron-only devices, the Vbi values are 0.2 V and 0 V, respectively).
