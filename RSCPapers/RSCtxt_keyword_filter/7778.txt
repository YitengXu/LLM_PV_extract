Introduction
Carbon-based nanomaterials, including fullerene, graphene, carbon nanotubes, and carbon nanodots (CDs), have been regarded as a viable alternative to organic dyes and traditional semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in bioimaging and biosensing, photocatalysis, optoelectronics, and photovoltaics (PVs).1–8 Especially, CDs, owing to their superior performance in terms of water solubility, stability, toxicity, resistance to photobleaching, and biocompatibility, have recently drawn significant attention.9–15 The electron injection from CDs to TiO2 was demonstrated to be feasible and the CD-sensitized TiO2 photoelectrodes have been applied in photocatalysis and PVs.10,16–21 However, it is still a challenge to achieve efficient electron injection from CDs to TiO2 under sunlight,21 which is a primary photophysical process in generating photocurrent in CD-based PVs.22,23 To date, the power conversion efficiency of CD-based PVs has been only 0.13%, as reported by Mirtchev and co-workers.21 The authors pointed out that the low power conversion efficiency was possibly due to inferior electron injection from CDs to TiO2. Most of the CDs, such as those prepared by laser ablation, electrochemical oxidation, and hydrothermal synthesis, have the main absorption band in the ultraviolet region,10 which is unfavorable for efficient absorption of solar energy. The CDs used by Mirtchev et al. in the CD-based PVs have absorption bands mainly in the ultraviolet region with a tail in the visible region.21 The long tail absorption band possibly arises from surface defect states.24,25 The surface defects are unstable and dissipative in energy, which are unfavorable for efficient electron injection in PVs.23,26–28 In addition, the reported CDs are generally passivated with insulating long chain molecules,10,12,29 which act as tunneling barriers and are against efficient electron injection and well performing CD-based optoelectronic devices.22,30 To realize efficient CD-sensitized TiO2 PVs under sunlight, the CDs should exhibit intrinsic absorption in the visible region and be integrated effectively with TiO2. Thus, it is of significant interest to exploit such photoelectrodes based on CD/TiO2 composites to demonstrate the possibility of developing a well performing CD-based PV system.
Previously, we prepared non-long-chain-molecule-functionlized CDs with a strong and specific absorption band in the visible region (CDs-V) extending to 500 nm, which exhibited superior photostability compared with organic dyes.12,29,31,32 Amplified spontaneous green emission and lasing were achieved from the CDs-V.29 Green photoluminescence (PL) was proposed to be intrinsic state emission and the visible absorption was from intrinsic absorption rather than from surface defect states.29 In this work, we demonstrated that the CDs-V could be integrated with TiO2 with the absorption band extending to the visible region. Efficient photoelectrodes were prepared by integrating the CDs-V with the TiO2 film on the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate with fast and efficient electron injection from CDs-V to TiO2 with a rate of 8.8 × 108 s−1 and an efficiency of 91%. The electron injection properties and charge separation processes for the CDs-V/TiO2 composites were investigated through regulating the surrounding environment. The CDs-V/TiO2 composites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light, much better than pure TiO2 and the CDs with the main absorption band in the ultraviolet region (CDs-U) and TiO2 composites, indicating that visible photoinduced electrons and holes in CDs-V/TiO2 composites could be effectively separated. The CD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells were prepared. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) results also agreed with efficient charge separation between CDs-V and the TiO2 electrode in the visible range. These interesting results demonstrate that the non-long-chain-molecule-functionlized CDs with visible intrinsic absorption could be appropriate photosensitizers and offer new opportunities for developing a well performing CD-based PV system.
Experimental section
Chemicals and materials
Citric acid (99.5%) and urea (99%) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. TiO2 powder (P25, a mixed phase of 80% anatase and 20% rutile; average size 25 nm) was purchased from Degussa. CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs were purchased from Ocean Nano Tech LLC. All chemicals were used without further purification. The water used in all experiments was purified using a Millipore system.
Synthesis of CDs-V
3 g of citric acid and 6 g of urea were added to 20 mL of deionized water to form a transparent solution. Then the mixed solution was heated in a domestic 750 W microwave oven for about 5 minutes, during which the solution changed from a colorless liquid to a light brown and finally dark brown clustered solid, indicating the formation of CDs. The solid was then dissolved in water and centrifuged to remove agglomerated particles with a speed of 8000 rpm for 20 min three times.
Synthesis of CDs-U
3 g of citric acid and 6 g of urea were added to 20 mL of deionized water to form a transparent solution. The mixed solution was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. Then the sealed autoclave was heated to 160 °C and kept for about 4 h.
Fabrication of CD/TiO2 composites
The CD/TiO2 composites were prepared by simply dispersing P25 powder in CDs-U or CDs-V aqueous solution (5 mg mL−1) with constant stirring for 24 h. All the reaction mixtures were washed with water and centrifuged to remove unadsorbed CDs with a speed of 5000 rpm until the supernatant was non-fluorescent. The samples were then dried at 80 °C and kept in a vacuum oven for further experiments and measurements. The color of TiO2 changes from pure white to light brown after integrating with the CDs-V as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).
Fabrication of CDs-V/TiO2 composites on glass and FTO substrates
The TiO2 films were spread on glass and FTO substrates by spin-coating P25 paste onto the substrates with a speed of 2500 rpm for 60 s, and the obtained substrates were calcined at 500 °C in air for 60 min and cooled to room temperature naturally. The TiO2 films on glass and FTO substrates were immersed in the aqueous solution of CDs-V with a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 for 24 h and then rinsed thoroughly with water.
Fabrication of CD-sensitized solar cells
TiO2 mesoporous films were spread on FTO substrates by successive screen printing of P25 paste as the transparent layer (9.5 ± 0.5 μm) and 30 wt% 200–400 nm TiO2 mixed with 70 wt% P25 paste as the light scattering layer (6.5 ± 0.5 μm). The obtained substrates were calcined at 500 °C in air for 60 min and cooled to room temperature naturally. A modification of the TiO2 mesoporous films with an aqueous solution of TiCl4 (0.04 M) was then performed. For the integration of CDs-V with TiO2 film electrodes, the TiO2 mesoporous films on FTO substrates were immersed in the aqueous solution of CDs-V with a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 for 24 h and then rinsed thoroughly with water. Platinum coated FTO was chosen as the counter electrode. The solar cells were prepared by sealing the platinum coated FTO counter electrode and CD-sensitized TiO2 film electrode with a binder clip using a Scotch spacer. Then, a small amount of I−/I3− electrolyte was infiltrated into the cell through a pre-drilled hole in the platinum coated FTO counter electrode.
Photocatalytic activity measurements
The photocatalytic activity of the samples was tested through measuring the decomposition rate of Rhodamine B (RhB) molecules under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm) from a Zolix SS150 solar simulator with a 400 nm cut-off filter. The CDs-V, P25 TiO2, CDs-U/TiO2 and CDs-V/TiO2 composites were dissolved in water at a 5 mg mL−1 concentration. Each solution (0.1 mL) was mixed with 0.1 mL of RhB aqueous solution (100 ppm), and 3 mL of deionized water was added. The mixed solutions were then transferred into a quartz cuvette and kept away from any source of light for 1 h with magnetic stirring for the adsorption/desorption equilibrium between catalysts and RhB. Then the solutions were exposed to visible light irradiation with continuous stirring. The decrease in the absorbance value at the characteristic absorption peak of RhB (554 nm) was measured after irradiation for a constant time interval with visible light. The absorption spectra were measured in situ using the absorbance mode of a USB4000-UV-VIS Spectrometer with reference light from an Ocean Optics HL-2000 light source. A 510 nm cut-off filter was placed on the light source to prevent the excitation of CDs-U and CDs-V. The reference light was imported from an Ocean Optics QP8-2-SMA-BX fiber and exported from an Ocean Optics QP1000-2-SR fiber.
Results and discussion
The CDs-V were synthesized according to our previous work with the starting materials of 3 g of citric acid and 6 g of urea.12,29 The CDs-V have a specific intrinsic absorption band in the visible region ranging from 400 to 500 nm (Fig. 1a). The mass extinction coefficients of the CDs-V are much higher than those of CdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) in the entire absorption band, especially in the visible region as shown in Fig. 1a, which indicates that the CDs could be a good photosensitive material for PVs. A compact integration of CDs-V with TiO2 nanoparticles is necessary for efficient electron injection. The CDs-V/TiO2 composites were prepared by simply mixing them in water under constant stirring for 24 h. The reaction mixtures were diluted with water and centrifuged to remove unadsorbed CDs-V with a speed of 5000 rpm until the supernatant was non-fluorescent. The color of TiO2 changed from pure white to light brown after the integration of CDs-V with TiO2 nanoparticles as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), verifying the success in integrating the CDs-V with TiO2 nanoparticles. Fig. 1b shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra (converted from diffuse reflection spectra) of TiO2 and CDs-V/TiO2 composites. Pure TiO2 has almost no absorption above 400 nm, while the CDs-V/TiO2 composites have continuous broad absorption in the visible region ranging from 400 to 600 nm, indicating the adsorption of CDs-V on the surface of TiO2. To further confirm the integration of CDs-V with TiO2 nanoparticles, high resolution transmission electron microscopic (HRTEM) images of the CDs-V/TiO2 composites were recorded (Fig. 1c and d). As seen from Fig. 1d, the interplanar spacing of 0.35 nm is assigned to the (101) lattice plane of anatase TiO2, while the 0.21 nm lattice fringes agree well with the (102) plane of graphitic carbon, demonstrating the integration of CDs-V with TiO2 nanoparticles. It should be mentioned that no long chain molecules were functionalized on the CDs-V. Thus, the cores of the CDs-V could be closely anchored to the surface of TiO2, resulting in compact integration, as shown in Fig. 1d, which is beneficial for efficient electron injection.

To clearly illustrate the electron injection properties of the CDs-V/TiO2 composites, the PL properties of the CDs-V/TiO2 composites in water were studied. The emission of CDs-V could be quenched by TiO2 after integrating CDs-V with TiO2. The PL dynamics of CDs-V and CDs-V/TiO2 composites in water were collected as shown in Fig. 2. After integration with TiO2 nanoparticles, a shortening in the PL decays of CDs-V was observed. This shortening is ascribed to electron injection from CDs-V to the conduction band of TiO2.33 The electron injection rate (kEI) and efficiency (ηEI) can be calculated from eqn (1) and (2): (1) (2)where τave(CD) and τave(CD/TiO2) are the average lifetimes of the CDs-V and CDs-V/TiO2 composites, respectively.33–35 The PL decay curves of the CDs-V and the CDs-V/TiO2 composites were fitted with bi- or tri-exponential decay kinetics and the calculated kEI and ηEI are summarized in Table 1. The kEI and ηEI from CDs-V to TiO2 in water were estimated to be ∼0.15 × 108 s−1 and 8.8%, respectively.

To acquire a deep understanding of the electrical interaction between the CDs-V and TiO2, the PL dynamics of the CDs-V/TiO2 composites in air were measured, as shown in Fig. 2. The CDs-V/TiO2 composites were prepared by immersing mesoporous TiO2 films on glass or FTO substrates in aqueous solution of the CDs-V with a concentration of 5 mg mL−1 for 24 h and then rinsing thoroughly with water to avoid the aggregation of CDs-V. The CDs could be separately adsorbed on paper with enhanced fluorescence as shown in our previous report.12 The reference sample was prepared by dispersing the aqueous solution of the CDs-V with low concentration on commercially available filter paper, which is an insulator and there is no electron transfer process in the CDs-V/paper composites. As seen from Fig. 2, the PL decay of the CDs-V/TiO2 composites on the glass substrate is significantly shortened, which can be further shortened in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites on the FTO substrate. The kEI and ηEI for the CDs-V/TiO2 composites on the glass substrate in air were 3.9 × 108 s−1 and 82%, respectively. When the CDs-V were integrated with the TiO2 film on the conductive FTO substrate, kEI and ηEI were further increased to 8.8 × 108 s−1 and 91%. These results demonstrate that efficient electron injection in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites can be achieved. kEI and ηEI from the CDs-V to TiO2 in water were estimated to be ∼0.15 × 108 s−1 and 8.8%, respectively, which were much lower than those for the CDs-V/TiO2 composites in air. There are three possible dissipative channels for the electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites, which are electron extraction by O2,16 electron capture by defect states in TiO2, and electron recombination from TiO2 to the CDs-V, as shown in Fig. 3. It can be inferred that the content of O2 in air is much higher than that in water, which could efficiently extract the photoinduced injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 from the CDs-V. The photoinduced injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 from the CDs-V could not be efficiently extracted by O2 in water, due to low concentration of O2 in water (∼8 mg L−1). So the electron injection from the CDs-V to TiO2 in water was less efficient than that in the composites in air. It can be concluded that the electron capture by defect states in TiO2 and electron recombination from TiO2 to the CDs-V are unfavorable compared with electron extraction by O2. Effective electron capture by defect states in TiO2 and electron recombination from TiO2 to the CDs-V would also extract the photoinduced injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 and then promote the electron injection from CDs-V to TiO2 nanoparticles, which cannot lead to such obvious oxygen-content-dependent electron injection properties. After replacing the glass substrate with the conductive FTO substrate in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites, kEI and ηEI in air were further increased. This is because the FTO substrate enhances the electron extraction from the conduction band of TiO2 due to the role of the FTO conductive film as another dissipative channel for the electrons. It can be inferred that the visible photoinduced charges in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites could be efficiently separated and collected through an effective loop in the CD-based PVs.

CB: the conduction band of TiO2, VB: the valence band of TiO2. 
We further investigated the photoinduced charge separation processes in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites by photocatalytic experiments on the CDs-V/TiO2 composites. The decomposition rates of RhB by the CDs-V/TiO2 composites were measured under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The absorption spectra of RhB solutions mixed with pure TiO2 and the CDs-V/TiO2 composites measured at different visible light irradiation times are shown in Fig. S2a–e (ESI†). The characteristic absorption peak of RhB aqueous solution (554 nm) mixed with CDs-V/TiO2 composites decreased quickly with peak wavelength exhibiting a blue shift under visible light irradiation (Fig. S2e, ESI†), which might be due to two concomitant photodegradation processes: cleavage of the conjugated chromophore ring structure and de-ethylation of RhB.38,39 The intensity ratios of the characteristic absorption peak of RhB (554 nm) after irradiation under visible light for a constant time interval (C) and prior to irradiation (C0) were calculated as shown in Fig. 4a. Fig. 4b shows the photodegradation kinetics (ln(C0/C)) of RhB solutions containing different components.16 As seen from Fig. 4a and b, pure CDs-V have almost no degradation of RhB under visible light. The decomposition rate constant of RhB by the CDs-V/TiO2 composites was much higher than that of pure TiO2, which indicates that the charge separation in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites was the major factor for improving the photocatalytic activity of TiO2.16–19 The photocatalytic activity of the composites based on CDs-U was also investigated (Fig. 4a and b). The CDs-U were synthesized according to recent work.16 The CDs-U/TiO2 composites were prepared using the same method as for CDs-V/TiO2 composites. The decomposition rate constant of RhB by the CDs-U/TiO2 composites was similar to that of pure TiO2 and much inferior to that of CDs-V/TiO2 composites, due to weak absorption of CDs-U in the visible region (Fig. S2f, ESI†). It can be concluded that the CDs with main absorption in the visible region are important for charge separation in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites under visible light to improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2. Fig. 4c shows the optical images of RhB solution and mixed solutions of RhB with pure TiO2, the CDs-V/TiO2 composites, and the CDs-V without and with sunlight irradiation for 2 hours. It can be seen that most RhB was degraded by the CDs-V/TiO2 composites under sunlight for 2 hours, which is much more efficient than pure TiO2. The excellent photocatalytic activity of the CDs-V/TiO2 composites indicates that the small amount of O2 and OH− in water can effectively extract the visible photoinduced electrons and holes in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites, respectively, to generate O2˙ and ˙OH to decompose RhB as shown in Fig. 3. It also agrees with the fact that electron recombination from TiO2 to the CDs-V is unfavorable. It can also be inferred that the visible photoinduced charges in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites could be efficiently separated and collected through an effective loop in the CD-based PVs.

(c) Optical images of RhB (10 ppm) and mixed solutions of RhB (10 ppm) with pure TiO2, the CDs-V/TiO2 composites, and CDs-V (TiO2, CDs-V/TiO2 composites, and CDs-V at the same concentration of 0.5 mg mL−1) without (above) and with (below) daylight irradiation for 2 hours. The pH values of the RhB and mixed solutions of RhB with CDs-V, TiO2, CDs-U/TiO2 and CDs-V/TiO2 composites: 6.51, 6.42, 6.14, 6.32, and 6.47, respectively. Illumination intensity at the solution surface: 72.5 mW cm−2, irradiating area: 1 cm2. 
Simple CD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells with a general dye-sensitized solar cell structure with an I−/I3− electrolyte were prepared to further investigate the photoinduced charge separation behaviors between CDs-V and TiO2. The IPCE spectra of pure TiO2 and the CD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells were measured as shown in Fig. 5. The IPCE curve of pure TiO2 solar cells is almost zero in the visible region (λ > 400 nm) due to the large band gap width of TiO2. In comparison, the IPCE curve of the CD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells is obviously enhanced in the range from 380 to 500 nm, indicating that the visible absorption of CDs-V contributes to the photogenerated current. At this stage, the performance of the CD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells is unsatisfactory, which might be due to the low adsorption degree of the CDs-V on the TiO2 electrode causing low absorption of visible light as evaluated from the UV-Vis absorption spectrum of the CDs-V/TiO2 composites, in which the relative intensity of CDs-V and TiO2 is low (Fig. 5). Considering the relatively low adsorption degree of CDs-V on the TiO2 electrode and the similar shapes of the IPCE spectrum of the CD-sensitized TiO2 solar cell and the absorption spectrum of CDs-V/TiO2 composites, the photoinduced charge separation between CDs-V and the TiO2 electrode should be efficient. We propose that the performance of the CD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells can be further improved by increasing the adsorption degree of the CDs-V on the TiO2 electrode, and this work is in process.

Conclusions
In summary, non-long-chain-molecule-functionlized CDs with visible intrinsic absorption (CDs-V) were compactly integrated with TiO2. The PL dynamics study demonstrated that photogenerated electrons from the CDs-V could quickly and efficiently inject into TiO2 with kEI = 8.8 × 108 s−1 and ηEI = 91%, respectively, in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites. The CDs-V/TiO2 composites exhibited excellent photocatalytic activity under visible light, which was much better than pure TiO2 and CDs-U/TiO2 composites, indicating that visible photoinduced electrons and holes in CDs-V/TiO2 composites could be effectively separated and electron recombination from TiO2 to the CDs-V was unfavorable. The IPCE results for the CD-sensitized TiO2 solar cells also agreed with efficient photoinduced charge separation between CDs-V and the TiO2 electrode in the visible range. These results demonstrate that the non-long-chain-molecule-functionlized CDs with a visible intrinsic absorption band are appropriate candidates as photosensitizers and indicate that the visible photoinduced charges in the CDs-V/TiO2 composites could be efficiently separated and collected through an effective loop in the CD-based PV system.
