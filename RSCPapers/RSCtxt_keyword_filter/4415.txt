    , Accepted 24th November 2016First published on 24th November 2016AbstractMore efficient light harvesting throughout the whole solar spectrum by introducing third and fourth components offers a new pathway towards the development of high efficiency organic solar cells based on polymer/fullerene blends. Recently, dye molecules have been utilized as promising light harvesting photosensitizers in the near-IR region. Herein, we report the design, synthesis and application of a novel silicon naphthalocyanine (SiNC-1) as an efficient photosensitizer in single dye ternary devices as well as in multi-colored co-sensitized quaternary devices, incorporating a silicon phthalocyanine (SiPC-0 or SiPC-1) as the fourth component to complement the spectral absorption of the SiNC-1. The dominant complex charge transfer/transport mechanism behind the enhanced photosensitivity of the ternary blend has been investigated by means of electrical, optical, and advanced characterization techniques. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements on multi-colored dye sensitized devices covering the UV-vis as well as near-IR regions from 350 up to 900 nm outline apparent signal characteristics of each single dye, corroborating the effective contribution of both SiPC and SiNC dyes to enhancing the short-circuit current density (JSC). Our results further illustrate the potential of the multi-colored dye sensitization concept as a powerful approach to mitigate the non-ideal optical absorption normally encountered in organic-based optoelectronic devices.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells based on polymer/fullerene blends have attracted much attention over the past decade, leading to a breakthrough in power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10%.1–5 Higher PCEs are now achieved using low-bandgap polymers that allow harvesting a broader fraction of the solar spectrum.6,7 Since common polymers such as regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene, P3HT) absorb only a quarter of the total photons in the terrestrial solar light spectrum,8 more efficient light harvesting is required to optimize absorption in BHJs. Several strategies are currently being pursued to achieve enhanced PCE. One possible solution is through employing conjugated polymers with smaller band gaps with absorption ranges extending into the near-IR region.9–13 Alternatively, the tandem concept, which involves stacking two or more cells with complementary absorption spectra in series or parallel connection, could be another successful approach.14–17
The formation of BHJ devices from ternary blends using a third component to act as the second donor or acceptor material (with different optical properties) has been intensively studied.18–24 These reports show that dye sensitization is a promising way to improve light harvesting. Recently, a variety of dye molecules have been designed and synthesized to act as light-harvesting photosensitizers in the longer wavelength region of the spectrum,25,26 and the photophysics of systems composed of, for example, polymer/dye/fullerene blends has been studied.27–29 Little is known, however, about the details of the overall charge transfer/transport mechanism and the role of dyes in ternary blends.
To the best of our knowledge, some dye molecules have successfully been applied for ternary blend systems, while the light absorption is always limited in the near-IR range of 600–850 nm for various dye molecules.30–33 A simple and versatile method using multi-colored dye sensitization by multiple dyes is thus desirable, which could increase the visible light absorption through the use of dyes that have complementary spectral features in the near-IR region. This concept has been successfully applied in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), by selecting a suitable co-absorbing material or constructing a dye-bilayer structure stained with two different dyes.34–39 To date, however, there is only one report of polymer/fullerene BHJ solar cells based on the concept of multi-colored dye sensitization.40 The limited success of this concept in BHJ solar cells is often the result of unfavorable interactions between different dye molecules and formation of dye aggregation, which hinder efficient light harvesting in blends and also limit high dye loading.
In the current work, a substituted silicon naphthalocyanine (SiNC-1) was synthesized to include flexible axial ligands, offering favorable intermolecular interactions when it is incorporated into ternary devices (P3HT:dye:PCBM). The broad sensitization range of the new dye, SiNC-1, up to 950 nm, was studied as a means to boost efficient light harvesting in ternary blends. On the basis of the detailed analyses, such as steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and photoinduced absorption (PIA) measurements, a definite charge transfer/transport mechanism has been clarified. Finally, multi-colored dye sensitized quaternary solar cells were fabricated by employing SiNC-1 in combination with SiPC (SiPC-0 or SiPC-1) (see Scheme 1). The device with SiNC-1 and SiPC as co-sensitizers showed enhanced power conversion efficiency compared to the individual blend solar cells with single dye blending.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of SiNC-1

Scheme 2 presents the synthetic route to silicon naphthalocyanine SiNC-1, which features axial substitution with two pyrene acetic acid groups. Furthermore, the periphery of the naphthalocyanine incorporates four bulky tert-butyl groups, which improve the solubility of the dye molecule and reduce the dye aggregation to allow high dye loading. In particular,41–45 dicyanonaphthalene 1 was condensed with NH3 in the presence of NaOMe to give diiminobenz[f]isoindoline 2 (Scheme 2a). Compound 2 was then heated in the presence of quinoline and SiCl4 to give the dichlorosilicon naphthalocyanine 3. Displacement of the two chloride ligands of 3 with pyreneacetic acid (4) gave SiNC-1 (Scheme 2b). The product SiNC-1 was characterized by 1H NMR and UV-vis spectroscopy as well as APPI HRMS, and all data were consistent with the proposed structure. The detailed synthetic procedure is described in the Experimental section and the ESI.† Phthalocyanines SiPC-0 and SiPC-1 were synthesized as reported.45

Absorption properties
The normalized absorption spectra of P3HT:PCBM, pristine SiPC-0 and SiNC-1 in thin films are shown in Fig. 1a, and demonstrate that the spectra combine the absorption features of dye (SiPC-0: 550–750 nm and SiNC-1: 650–950 nm and the ligand pyrene: 300–400 nm). Most significantly, SiNC-1 shows a strong red shift compared to SiPC-0, providing broader absorption in the near-IR region. This behavior can be explained with the extending of the π-system in SiNC-1 that allows for better electronic communication between the intermolecular moieties, resulting in smaller HOMO–LUMO gaps, being consistent with the HOMO and LUMO energy levels estimated by cyclic voltammetry, see Fig. S2† (LUMO = 3.7 eV and HOMO = 5.3 eV for SiPC-0; LUMO = 3.5 eV and HOMO = 4.9 eV for SiNC-1). As shown in Fig. 1a, the complementary absorption profiles of SiPC-0 and SiNC-1, which do not significantly overlap with those of P3HT:PCBM, promise to allow enhanced solar harvesting in ternary and quaternary systems. Hence, solar cells were fabricated based on an inverted device structure using ZnO nanoparticles as the electron-transporting layer, MoOx as the hole-transporting layer, and an air stable high work function (WF) metal Ag as the anodic electrode. All devices were fabricated using doctor-blade technology under ambient conditions with an inverted structure as shown in Fig. 1b. In the following, results on the device performance, photo-physics and morphology are discussed in detail.

Photovoltaic properties
Glass/ITO/ZnO/P3HT:SiNC-1:PCBM/MoOx/Ag BHJ inverted ternary solar cells with increasing dye contents were fabricated and characterized. The performance of the P3HT:PCBM reference was rather moderate (PCE ≈ 2.97%) compared to the state-of-the-art due to different processing technologies and different material sources. However, we went forward to gaining a fundamental understanding of the functionality of a novel class of naphthalocyanine-based NIR sensitizers. Fig. 2a shows the J–V characteristics of the ternary blend solar cells and the corresponding control P3HT:PCBM binary blend solar cell. Fig. 2b presents a relative difference of solar cell parameters compared to that of the binary control P3HT:PCBM device. The photovoltaic device parameters are further summarized in Table 1. These device parameters are averaged over 10 devices for each composition ratio (Fig. S3†). As expected, the addition of SiNC-1 results in an increase of the short circuit current density (JSC). Sensitization turned out to be most efficient at a dye concentration of 15 wt%, leading to a JSC increase of almost 10% from 8.83 mA cm−2 for the binary control device to 9.66 mA cm−2 for the ternary based device. For concentrations above 20 wt%, however, the positive influence of sensitization on JSC starts to decline. The fill factor (FF) for the ternary blend cells showed also some moderate improvement at low concentrations of SiNC-1, and was almost the same as for the control device at a sensitizer content of 15 wt%. The latter can be explained based on the fact that no disruptive change in the morphology of ternary blends has been seen, as will be discussed later in detail. Similar to JSC, the FF starts to decrease when the SiNC-1 content is beyond 20 wt%, suggesting that the sensitizer loading at the P3HT/PCBM interface reaches saturation with a content less than 20 wt%. Previous studies showed that if the excess dye sensitizers are located in P3HT or PCBM domains, they will not contribute to photocurrent generation.32,33 Interestingly, the VOC also shows an increase from 0.60 V for the reference device to 0.65 V for the ternary blend with a sensitizer concentration of 10 wt%. The enhancement of VOC is dominantly attributable to the decrease of non-radiative recombination pathways between the polymer and fullerene regions as the sensitizer is intercalated directly at the heterojunction between P3HT and PCBM.46 On the other hand, the increased VOC can be possibly due to the improved crystallization of P3HT.47 The results revealing the details of the VOC changes in the ternary blends will be reported in a separate manuscript. Overall, the ternary solar cells exhibit a substantially improved performance compared to the binary control cells (around 20 to 25% improvement in PCE for sensitizer contents of 10 to 15 wt%).

Fig. 3a presents the absorption characteristics of ternary films with increasing SiNC-1 contents. To precisely assess the changes of absorption profiles and intensities, a constant film thickness of ca. 120 nm is targeted for all blends. All films exhibit distinguished vibration bands at around 500–600 nm, which are indicative of the crystallization of P3HT. All SiNC-1 ternary blend films exhibit strong absorption in the range between 650 nm and 950 nm. Fig. 3b illustrates the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the corresponding devices. The ternary blend solar cells exhibit a broad EQE peak at 650–950 nm, corresponding to the absorption of SiNC-1. The sensitization effect increases with higher amounts of SiNC-1, consistent with the trend seen in the absorption spectra. This increase stems from the extended absorption in the near IR region, which can produce a significantly higher number of photo-generated carriers. The EQE peak associated with P3HT (400–600 nm) features a slight drop for the SiNC-1 less than 15 wt% and shows a significant decrease only after increasing the dye's concentration beyond 20 wt%. The latter can be explained by the optical loss due to the reduced relative weight fraction of P3HT, and also by the electrical loss due to decreased charge transport of the whole system caused by disturbing the crystallization of P3HT after high dye loading. To study the change in the crystallization of P3HT, the normalized absorption spectra of P3HT:SiNC-1:PCBM ternary films are recorded with varying dye contents, as shown in Fig. S4.† The shoulder around 600 nm is evidence of the crystallization of P3HT caused by the π–π conjugation. This shoulder starts to vanish when the amount of SiNC-1 exceeds 15 wt%.

In order to evaluate the efficacy of the charge generation and extraction processes, we calculate the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) spectra from the measured EQE spectra according to the following equation.48 (1)where R is the reflection for the total device, and T is the corresponding transmission. The SPA accounts for the simulated parasitic absorption within the ITO, MoOx and Ag layers.

Fig. 3c shows the IQE spectra of the SiNC-1 ternary blend devices with increasing SiNC-1 contents. For SiNC-1 contents below 15 wt%, the IQE remains almost constant in the regime where P3HT absorbs, while for the concentrations beyond 20 wt%, a huge photocurrent loss is observable. This trend is similar to the diminution seen for JSC and FF. As aforementioned, one possible explanation for this observation is that the excess SiNC-1 dye molecules that desirably need to be located at the interface of P3HT and PCBM accommodate within the domains of P3HT/PCBM instead, causing in turn a limitation to the charge transport. Interestingly, the above trend is not observed in the near-IR region. The IQE features a significant improvement from 5 wt% to 15 wt% and levels off beyond 20 wt%. This suggests a parallel-like hole transfer by forming a mature percolation pathway of SiNC-1 domains, adjacent to the P3HT crystallites. In order to verify whether SiNC-1 is capable of transferring holes by itself, we tested the SiNC-1:PCBM binary device. The J–V curve and EQE are shown in Fig. S5.† On the basis of these results, it can be concluded that SiNC-1 is able to transfer holes to the anode by itself to form a parallel-like charge transfer pathway.
To further reveal and analyze any other possible charge transfer/transport mechanisms within this complex ternary blend, we performed steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and photoinduced absorption (PIA) measurements.
Photoluminescence (PL) quenching
The photoluminescence (PL) spectra of pristine P3HT, pristine SiNC-1, the binary blends of P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:SiNC-1, and the ternary films with different SiNC-1 contents are shown in Fig. 4a. All samples were excited at 445 nm. All PL spectra are corrected for the absorption and the sensitivity of the sensor. The variation in the PL maximum of P3HT at 720 nm indicates that compared to the binary P3HT:PCBM film, the quenching for ternary films is slightly more efficient when a SiNC-1 content of 5 wt% is being added (≈5%). By further increasing the SiNC-1 content, the PL intensity of P3HT is further quenched (over 90% quenching for a SiNC-1 content of 15 wt%), which means almost all the P3HT excitons are quenched. This effective quenching suggests that a more efficient charge transfer pathway exists in the ternary systems compared to binary blends.

Energy transfer
Interestingly, in the case of the P3HT:SiNC-1 blend, the PL of P3HT quenches simultaneously by increasing the emission peak of SiNC-1, suggesting that there is a non-radiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between P3HT and SiNC-1. As shown in Fig. 4b, there is a strong overlap of donor (P3HT) emission with acceptor (SiNC-1) absorption, which fulfills a primary condition for the occurrence of FRET.49 Huang et al. previously reported a FRET process between P3HT and polysquaraine dyes in ternary solar cells, and provided some experimental evidence for the idea that FRET enhances the probability of exciton harvesting.50 To verify if this finding is also valid for our system, we performed PL studies for the P3HT:SiNC-1 blends with different ratios. As observed in Fig. S6,† the emission peak of SiNC-1 becomes larger with increasing P3HT amount even when the SiNC-1 weight ratio decreases. Since FRET is a distance-dependent and non-radiative phenomenon, for a favorable system, it is 50% efficient in the donor–acceptor separation distance named Förster radius (R0). In order to understand how this mechanism works in our case, we calculated the Förster radius (R0) in blends of SiNC-1 and P3HT by using the following equations, as previously reported.49–51 (2) (3)where Q0 is the donor photoluminescence quantum efficiency in the absence of an acceptor and can be considered 1% for P3HT. k2 indicates the dipole orientation factor, which is equal to 2/3 for a random orientation of donor and acceptor molecules. n and NA are the refractive index of the medium and Avogadro's number, respectively. n is approximately 1.4 for organic media. J is the spectral overlap integral and can be calculated by fD and εA, which are the normalized P3HT emission spectrum and SiNC-1 molar extinction coefficient spectrum.
According to the above parameters, R0 is calculated to be 7 nm, which describes that FRET acts efficiently between P3HT and SiNC-1 only if the distance between them is 7 nm or less.
Photoinduced absorption (PIA)
As known, locating the HOMO and LUMO level of the third component between the HOMOs and LUMOs of host components (cascade energy level), can provide several effective ways for charge transfer and transport. However, in our case, the HOMO level of SiNC-1 is similar to that of P3HT. As known, locating the HOMO and LUMO level of the third component between the HOMOs and LUMOs of host components (cascade energy level), can provide several effective ways for charge transfer and transport. However, in our case, the HOMO level of SiNC-1 is similar to that of P3HT.To obtain deeper insights into the charge transfer/transport mechanism in SiNC-1 ternary blend solar cells, steady-state photoinduced absorption (PIA) is recorded for a SiNC-1 (20 wt%) based ternary film. In order to better describe the charge transfer process, the PIA studies of the SiNC-1:PCBM binary as well as SiPC-0:PCBM binary and P3HT:SiPC-0:PCBM ternary systems are also performed. As demonstrated in our previous report,45SiPC-0 shows obvious sensitization effects in ternary solar cells. For the PIA experiments, a red pump laser beam (786 nm) is used to selectively excite SiNC-1 or SiPC-0 at wavelengths where the P3HT absorption is negligible. To exclude even the effect of charge transfer (CT) state absorption, we measure the PIA of P3HT:PCBM under different laser intensities. As shown in Fig. S7a,† the effect of CT state is negligible for laser densities around 14.2 mW cm−2. Herein, all PIA experiments are recorded at this laser light intensity. The polaron formation and polaron features of the pristine P3HT, SiNC-1 and SiPC-0 are pre-examined by measuring the photoabsorption of the corresponding iodine doped films, as a replacement to spectroelectrochemistry. Fig. S7† depicts clearly the peak position of the positive polarons formed in P3HT, SiNC-1 and SiPC-0 films.

Fig. 5 and S8† reveal the PIA experimental spectra measured by using both silicon and InGaAs detectors to analyze a broad wavelength region. The negative normalized absorption spectra of the P3HT:PCBM, SiPC-0 and SiNC-1 films are also added, to be able to explain clearly and more precisely the features related to the ground-state photobleaching of the compounds. Fig. S8† summarizes the results of the PIA investigation of the binary and ternary blends of the SiPC-0 system. For the SiPC-0:PCBM (1:1) film (the line with open circle symbols), the photobleaching band peak is observed at 666 nm, 727 nm and 826 nm, which corresponds to the absorption of SiPC-0. The positive band extends from 450 to 620 nm with a peak at 530 nm, and the band with a peak at 754 nm corresponds to SiPC-0 polaron photoabsorption regions, which is consistent with the results from iodine doping experiments shown in Fig. S7.† While for the corresponding ternary film with 20 wt% SiPC-0 content (the line with closed circle symbols), the sharp peaks at 525 nm, 573 nm and 623 nm correspond to the bleaching of P3HT ground-state absorption. Compared with the binary system, the significantly enhanced positive regions from 649 to 776 nm and 800 to 1100 nm are the signals combined by P3HT polarons and the SiPC-0 bleaching peak. Since the blend has only 20 wt% SiPC-0, the bleaching peaks are fully overlapped by the P3HT polaron peaks. As the PIA spectroscopic feature of PCBM extends beyond 1000 nm, the corresponding signal is not observable because of the sensitivity limitation of our detector.52 Obviously, P3HT cations are formed upon excitation of SiPC-0, meaning that hole transfer from SiPC-0 to P3HT happens, which is in accordance with the cascade charge transfer mechanism.
 Fig. 5  PIA spectra recorded at 6.8 mW cm−2 light intensity and 14.2 mW cm−2 laser intensity of P3HT:PCBM, SiNC-1:PCBM, and SiNC-1 based ternary films measured by (a) silicon and (b) InGaAs detectors. The normalized absorption spectra of the P3HT:PCBM and SiNC-1 films are presented on the same graphs for a direct comparison of the peak features. 
The PIA investigations of the binary and ternary blends of the SiNC-1 system are shown in Fig. 5. For the SiNC-1:PCBM (1:1) film (the line with open triangle symbols), the sharp features from 460 to 730 nm with a peak at 600 nm belong to the SiNC-1 polaron signals. The bleaching peaks at 440 nm, 780 nm and 860 nm are consistent with the absorption features of SiNC-1. In contrast, for the corresponding ternary film with 20 wt% SiNC-1 content (the line with closed triangle symbols), the measurements show not only the bleaching peak of SiNC-1, but also the bleaching peaks of P3HT at 525 nm, 573 nm and 623 nm. Meanwhile, the enhanced positive polaron regions from 730 to 780 nm and 900 to 1100 nm provide strong evidence for the formation of P3HT polarons. This means that the P3HT polarons are generated upon the photoexcitation of SiNC-1 and subsequent hole transfer from SiNC-1 to P3HT.
Charge transfer/transport mechanism
In total, a reasonable explanation for the charge transfer/transport mechanism in P3HT:SiNC-1:PCBM ternary systems with various dye contents is schematically illustrated in Fig. 6. When SiNC-1 ≤ 5 wt%, located at the amorphous P3HT:PCBM interface, the photoinduced excitons in SiNC-1 molecules are efficiently dissociated at the interfaces of P3HT:SiNC-1 and SiNC-1:PCBM and, afterwards, form free holes and electrons which are transported within P3HT and PCBM rich domains towards the electrodes. In the case of 5 wt% ≤ SiNC-1 ≤ 15 wt%, a parallel-like hole transport within the SiNC-1 and P3HT rich domains is very likely besides the aforementioned cascade charge transfer/transport mechanism. This explains why the IQE shows a huge improvement from 5 wt% to 15 wt% in the near-IR region. In both cases, efficient energy transfer and/or cascade electron transfer from P3HT to the dye molecules facilitate P3HT exciton dissociation. When SiNC-1 ≥ 15 wt%, SiNC-1 dye molecules overload the donor:acceptor amorphous interface volume and start interfering with the crystallites of the P3HT and PCBM host matrices. Consequently, the charge transport and device performance are diminished.

Quaternary BHJ solar cells
According to our studies, both SiPC and SiNC-1 can be used as potential sensitizers in organic ternary solar cells as they show complementary spectral absorptions at longer wavelengths. Herein, in the following, quaternary blend solar cells with an active layer configuration of P3HT/SiNC-1/SiPC/PCBM are fabricated and studied by the incorporation of SiPC-0 or SiPC-1 (see Fig. S9† for the absorption spectrum of SiPC-1). For comparison, we choose the same amount of SiPC (7.5 wt%) for the blends with different SiNC-1 contents. Fig. 7a and S10a† show the J–V curves of P3HT:SiPC-0:SiNC-1:PCBM and P3HT:SiPC-1:SiNC-1:PCBM blended quaternary devices and their photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Tables 2 and S1,† respectively. The chart-box presentations of the device performance are depicted in Fig. S11 and S12.† Their relative difference to the corresponding ternary device P3HT:SiPC (7.5 wt%):PCBM parameters is illustrated in Fig. 7b and S10b.† As shown, the quaternary blend solar cells exhibit an improved performance compared to the reference SiPC based ternary blend control cells. This increase in PCE is mainly caused by the improvement of the current density (JSC). For example, when keeping the amount of SiPC-0 constant (7.5 wt%), the photocurrent generation improves by increasing the SiNC-1 content. The sensitization has a positive impact up to 10 wt% SiNC-1 and starts to decline for higher contents. A similar trend is seen for the SiPC-1 quaternary system. As summarized in Table 2, the PCE of the quaternary blend solar cells is higher than that of the individual ternary blend solar cells, which means that both dyes can effectively contribute to photocurrent generation without unfavorable interactions between the two sensitizers.

The corresponding EQE spectra of these two quaternary solar cells, with broad signals from 350 nm up to 900 nm, are displayed in Fig. 8a and S13a.† The EQE of the quaternary device shows two broad peaks at 710 nm and 840 nm, indicating that both SiPC and SiNC-1 act as sensitizers in the P3HT/PCBM matrix. By increasing the amount of SiNC-1, the EQE associated with the SiNC-1 part continuously improves, accompanied by an increase in JSC. Interestingly, the EQE signal related to SiPC remained unchanged. All results are consistent with the trend shown in the corresponding absorption spectra (Fig. 8b and S13b†). The possible explanation is that SiPC is always located at the interface of the P3HT/PCBM matrix and that there is no unfavorable interaction between the two dyes. This can be concluded from the measured EQE value in the near IR region which is almost the same for the quaternary blend and the individual ternary blend solar cells with a single dye. For both quaternary systems, the peak associated with P3HT (400–600 nm) exhibits a slight drop at less than 10 wt% SiNC-1 and then a huge decrease at 15 wt% SiNC-1, a trend similar to the change in JSC. A possible deduction is that, no matter whether one or two sensitizers are added, the total amount of sensitizers loading at the interface of P3HT/PCBM is always in the range of 15 to 20 wt%.

As shown in Fig. 4, the PL of P3HT in quaternary films is more effectively quenched compared to that of the individual ternary blend solar cells with a single dye. This finding suggests more efficient charge transfer processes in the quaternary system compared to the corresponding ternary system.
Other photophysical studies
To elucidate the phenomenon of improved JSC both in the P3HT:SiNC-1:PCBM ternary system and in the P3HT:SiNC-1:SiPC:PCBM quaternary system, we discuss the impact of sensitizer addition on charge generation in the following. Fig. S14† shows the variation of photocurrent density (Jph) as a function of effective voltage (Veff).53 The saturation current Jsat and the maximum generation rate of free charge carriers Gmax are estimated according to previous work.45,54 Herein, Jsat and Gmax values are summarized in Table 3. These results are consistent with the difference in JSC and clearly suggest more efficient exciton generation, leading to higher PCE in the end.

Studying the FF, the ternary and quaternary devices show comparable values; a possible explanation for this is that the morphology is not adversely affected by adding the third component. To further study the relationship between the addition of sensitizers and device performance, charge transport of the aforementioned systems is investigated in detail. By employing the technique of photoinduced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing the voltage (photo-CELIV), the charge carrier mobility (μ) of devices can be analyzed.55–57 Fig. S15a† shows the photo-CELIV traces after a delay time of 50 μs, which are recorded for the reference binary control device as well as for the P3HT:SiNC-1:PCBM ternary devices at low and high dye contents. In Fig. S15b and c,† photo-CELIV traces are shown for the quaternary devices and the corresponding ternary devices. The applied method is similar to our previous work.45 At the end, a similar μ is achieved for all the devices. The μ values are listed in Table S2,† which is consistent with the similar FFs we found for ternary and quaternary devices.
Blended film morphology

Atomic force microscopy (AFM). 
In general, incorporating a third or fourth component material will destroy the morphology of the polymer/fullerene host system. Hence, in the following, the blend film morphology will be investigated. Fig. S16† shows the surface topographies of active layers investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM). All films show a similar root-mean-square (RMS) roughness. The RMS value is 1.031 for the binary blend film, 0.858 for the ternary blend film with a ratio of 15 wt% SiNC-1, and 0.860 for the quaternary blend film with a combined ratio of 7.5 wt% SiNC-1 + 7.5 wt% SiPC-0. The surface of all films appeared to be smooth. One would expect an increase of the surface roughness, if there was any significant phase separation. These findings indicate that the sensitizers do not cause any notable phase separation or any obvious morphology modifications, which further suggests that the examined sensitizers are highly compatible to the blend of P3HT:PCBM. To get better insight into the bulk morphology, anyhow, we carried out EFTEM which will be discussed in the following.


Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
TEM investigations are performed to gain further insights into the morphology. Fig. 9 shows TEM bright field images as well as elemental maps based on energy filtered TEM (EFTEM) imaging of sulfur (S) using the S L edge and of carbon (C) using the C K edge for binary, ternary and quaternary films. As only P3HT contains sulfur atoms it is feasible to distinguish P3HT from the other components using the sulfur signal. Due to the difference of the carbon content of PCBM (81.8 at%) in comparison to P3HT (40.0 at%), SiPC-0 (50.3 at%), and SiNC-1 (52.4 at%) the carbon signal can be used to represent PCBM. The Si as well as the N signals of SiPC-0 and SiNC-1 are too small for EFTEM imaging. Comparing the images of Fig. 9, it is shown that the morphology is preserved even at high dye loading. The P3HT fibers of the binary films still exist in the ternary case and also in the quaternary case. The preservation of the P3HT fiber morphology could explain why there is no obvious drop of EQE associated with the P3HT part and why the FFs are similar for all the devices as long as the total amount of dye molecules is less than 20 wt%.

Conclusions
In summary, a silicon naphthalocyanine (SiNC-1) with axial substituents consisting of pyrene acid groups has been synthesized and characterized. A ternary OPV device has been fabricated using SiNC-1 as a light-harvesting photosensitizer in the longer wavelength region. Embedded into the P3HT/PCBM matrix, SiNC-1 provides an additional charge generation pathway. SiNC-1 shows strong photosensitivity in the near-IR region (650–950 nm), as verified by both UV-vis and EQE measurements, yielding an improvement of up to 10% for JSC and 24% for PCE in the blend with P3HT/PCBM. Our in-depth study based on the complementary IQE, PL, and PIA measurements reveals complex charge transfer and transport kinetics, including cascade charge transfer, energy transfer and parallel-like charge transfer mechanisms. Furthermore, quaternary devices have been fabricated based on multi-colored dye sensitizers (SiNC-1 + SiPC-0 or SiNC-1 +SiPC-1) blended with a P3HT/PCBM matrix. Complementary spectral absorption is observed in the near-IR region of the EQE spectra, which means that both dyes contribute to the generation of excitons with efficient charge separation. Quaternary solar cells with 7.5 wt% SiPC and 5–7.5 wt% SiNC-1 show an improved PCE compared to the individual ternary blend solar cells. A possible deduction is that, no matter one or two sensitizers are added, the total amount of sensitizers loading at the interface of P3HT/PCBM always reaches saturation in the range of 15 to 20 wt%; sensitization turned out to be most efficient at this concentration. AFM and TEM investigations show that the morphology is not disturbed even with 15–20 wt% dye loading for both ternary and quaternary systems.
Hence, incorporation of dye molecules as a third and/or fourth dye component is an efficient approach to pursue high efficiency in organic solar cells. This simple and versatile method could be applied to efficiently enhance light harvesting and, thus, to increase the PCE and enable an easy access to the optimal morphology of solar cells even for the highly efficient low-bandgap polymer/fullerene system. According to the simulation results of Savoie et al.,58 incorporating a compound such as SiNC-1 with a bandgap of 1.5 eV into the suitable host system has the potential to approach over 10% power conversion efficiencies in ternary solar cells.
Experimental section
Synthesis procedure
All chemicals were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received. All solvents were distilled prior to use. 1-Pyreneacetic acid was directly purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Synthesis of compound 3. 
Anhydrous NH3 was bubbled into a stirred solution of compound 1 (285 mg, 1.00 mmol), sodium (23.0 mg, 1.00 mmol), and dry MeOH (15 mL) for about 20 h while the reaction was held at reflux. The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, and the solvent was evaporated. The resulting solid was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, MeOH) to give compound 2 (180 mg, 0.716 mmol, 71%) as a light yellow powder. In the next step, tetrachlorosilane (0.10 mL, 0.873 mmol) was added to a suspension of compound 2 (150 mg, 0.598 mmol) in quinoline (3 mL) at room temperature under nitrogen. The mixture was heated to 210 °C and stirred for 2 h. After cooling to room temperature, MeOH (15 mL) was added, and the resulting mixture was stirred overnight. The reddish-brown solid was filtered, washed with MeOH (10 mL), and then dried to yield 3 (80.0 mg, 52%), which was used for the subsequent reaction without further purification.


Synthesis of compound SiNC-1. 
A mixture of 3 (56.0 mg, 0.0540 mmol), 1-pyreneacetic acid (50.0 mg, 0.192 mmol) and diglyme (2 mL) was added into a flask under nitrogen. The mixture was stirred at 160 °C for 6 h. After cooling to rt, the yellow solid was passed through a plug silica gel using CH2Cl2. After removing the solvent, the residue was purified by column chromatography (silica gel, CH2Cl2/hexanes 1:1 to 1.5:1) and the solvent evaporated. The yellow solid was recrystallized from MeOH (20 mL), and then filtered. The solid was further washed using acetone (20 mL) and the filtrate was evaporated to afford SiNC-1 as yellow powder (20.0 mg, 25%). UV-vis (CH2Cl2) λmax 245, 279, 347, 721, 813 nm; 1H NMR (CDCl3): δ 1.75 (s, 36H), 2.14 (s, 4H), 5.65 (d, J = 6.0 Hz, 2H), 5.75 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 2H), 6.66 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 4H), 7.22–7.24 (m, 4H), 7.54 (d, J = 9.0 Hz, 2H), 7.69–7.72 (m, 2H), 7.83–7.88 (m, 2H), 8.00–8.07 (m, 8H), 8.42–8.51 (m, 8H), 9.24–9.41 (m, 4H). The 1H NMR spectrum of SiNC-1 is shown in Fig. S1.† APPI HRMS m/z: calc. for C100H78N8O4Si (M+), 1482.5896; found 1482.5910. MALDI TOF (matrix) m/z 1482 (M+, 10%), 1223 (M − PyCH2CO2–, 50%).

Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
Regioregular P3HT was purchased from BASF (Sepiolid P200) and PC61BM was purchased from Solenne BV; both were used without further purification. All devices were fabricated using doctor-blading under ambient conditions with the structure shown in Fig. 1b. Pre-structured indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were cleaned with acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 15 minutes each. After drying, the substrates were successively coated with 40 nm of zinc oxide (ZnO), followed by annealing in air on a hot plate at 80 °C for 5 min. Finally a 120 nm thick active layer based on P3HT:sensitizers:PCBM (20 mg mL−1) was bladed. The whole stack was annealed on a hot plate at 140 °C for 5 min in a glovebox. To complete the fabrication of the devices 10 nm of MoOx and 100 nm of Ag were thermally evaporated through a mask (with a 10.4 mm2 active area opening) under a vacuum of ∼5 × 10−6 mbar. The blend solution was prepared as follows: P3HT, PCBM and two sensitizers (SiPC and SiNC-1) were prepared at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene, and then left overnight to stir on a hot plate at 85 °C to ensure complete dissolution of the compounds in the solvent. The mixed solutions were allowed to spin on a hot plate for at least 1.5 h at 85 °C to ensure that the solutions were fully mixed before blading. The device measurement methods are summarized in the ESI.†
Characterization methods

Chemical instrumentation. 
Analytical TLC was performed on Al plates coated with 0.20 mm silica gel and containing a fluorescent indicator (Macherey-Nagel, ALUGRAM.SILG/UV254). Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (Macherey-Nagel, M-N Silica Gel 60A, 230–400 mesh). The UV-vis characterization of the solution was performed on a Cary 5000 UV-vis-NIR (Varian) spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were recorded under ambient conditions on a Bruker Avance 300 spectrometer and referenced to the residual solvent signal (1H: CDCl3, δ = 7.24 ppm) and recorded under ambient conditions. Mass spectra were obtained by using a Shimadzu AXIMA confidence (MALDI TOF) and a maXis 4G (Bruker, APPI HRMS). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies were similar to our previous work.45 The concentration of SiNC-1 was 1.0 mM. As a result, the potential values (E1/2) were calculated using the following equation: E1/2 = (Ered + Eox)/2, where Ered and Eox correspond to the cathodic and anodic peak potentials, respectively. Potentials are referenced to the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple used as an internal standard. The HOMO and LUMO energies were calculated with the empirical relation:59 (4) (5)
Thereby, all redox potentials were referenced to the Fc/Fc+ couple which were set to 0 V.


General device measurements. 
The J–V characteristics were measured using a source measurement unit from BoTest. Illumination was provided by a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 1A, from Newport) with an AM1.5G spectrum at 100 mW cm−2. Film UV-vis absorption was performed on a Lambda 950 from Perkin Elmer. External quantum efficiencies were measured via an integrated system from an Enli Technology (Taiwan).


Photo-CELIV. 
In photo-CELIV measurements, the devices were illuminated with a 405 nm laser-diode. Current transients were recorded across an internal 50 Ω resistor of an oscilloscope (Agilent Technologies DSO-X 2024A). We used a fast electrical switch to isolate the cell and prevent charge extraction or sweep out during the laser pulse and the delay time. After a variable delay time, a linear extraction ramp was applied via a function generator. The ramp, which was 60 μs long and 2 V in amplitude, was set to start with an offset matching the VOC of the cell for each delay time.


PL. 
PL measurements were performed on active layer films, exciting at 375 nm and 445 nm by a chopped argon laser beam. The PL emission of the films was dispersed by a 600 lines per mm grating monochromator (HRS-2) and detected by a Germanium detector (ADC 403L) through the lock-in technique.


PIA. 
PIA studies were performed by exciting the sample with a 786 nm laser while simultaneously probing the sample with a white lamp. The PIA spectra of the sample were dispersed by a 1200 lines per mm grating monochromator (iHR320) and detected by a silicon detector and an InGaAs detector separately through the lock-in technique.


Film morphology studies. 
The AFM measurements were performed in a tapping mode using a Veeco Model D3100. The films used to do TEM investigations were prepared as follows. Firstly, films of PEDOT:PSS and active layers with a thickness of 50 nm were deposited on glass using doctor-blading under ambient conditions. To float off the active layer, the sample was put into a vessel with distilled water, where PEDOT:PSS dissolved, and the active layer was transferred to a Cu TEM supporting grid. The TEM investigations were performed using an FEI Titan Themis 3003 TEM with a high brightness field emission gun (X-FEG) operated at 200 kV equipped with a high resolution Gatan Imaging Filter (GIF Quantum) used for energy filtered TEM (EFTEM). Elemental maps were obtained using the three-window technique.
