The linear electric field model is developed with the incomplete gamma function of the quantum efficiency as compared to the empirical data at forward bias conditions. This model is characterized with a consistent set of parameters from a series of measurements and the literature. Using the analytical modelling method, the carrier collection profile in the absorber is calculated and closely fitted by the developed mathematical expressions to identify the carrier dynamics during the quantum efficiency measurement of the device. The analytical calculation is compared with the measured quantum efficiency data at various bias conditions.
1 Introduction
Thin film photovoltaic device has made a dramatic progress commercially and technically after a stagnant performance in the past five years. One of the leading candidates is polycrystalline thin film CdTe and Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) based solar cells. Due to their dramatic conversion efficiency improvements and the cost reduction in mass module production as well as the balance of the system, the research and investment in thin film photovoltaic devices gained momentum across the community. However, despite a number of advantages of thin film solar cell technology such as lower manufacturing cost, lower temperature coefficient, direct energy band gap, and better energy payback time, the market is still dominated by crystalline Si solar cell technology due to the slightly higher module efficiency and better reliability at room temperature despite the higher cost. To improve the conversion efficiency of the cost-effective thin film solar cell technology, there have been constant attempts to better understand the loss mechanism by quantifying the charge carrier collection analytically, especially in emerging Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4, hereafter CZT(S,Se), thin film solar cells.
CZT(S,Se) solar cells are band gap-tunable from 1.0 eV to 1.5 eV and prove to be cost-effective by utilizing earth-abundant materials which are environment-friendly with possible complete Cd-free buffer in CZT(S,Se) devices.1–4 To further optimize the band gap (1.0 eV–1.4 eV)5 while improving a critical Voc deficit issue in these devices, Ge incorporation into CZT(S,Se) solar cells has been extensively studied recently while achieving a dramatic grain growth of the absorber.6–9 Bag7 presented hydrazine-processed CZTSe (S ∼ 0), alloying with 40% Ge which increased Voc (<0.476 V) mainly due to the band gap increase. Collord8 demonstrated a wide range of Ge concentration with Ge/(Ge + Sn) from 0 to 90% in various concentrations of CZT(S,Se), showing that 25% of Ge concentration improves the Voc deficit ratio from 58% to 63% of the theoretical Voc with a Voc deficit (Eg/q − Voc) of 548 mV. In another study, Giraldo9 reported a Voc deficit of 560 mV (60% of the theoretical Voc) by incorporating 2% of Ge in CZTSe devices (S ∼ 0) with various thicknesses of the Ge nanolayer (<15 nm), which led to GeOX–SnOX nano-inclusions in bulk. Recently, Kim10 demonstrated 12.3% efficiency for 22% of Ge/(Sn + Ge) in CZTSe with a Voc deficit of 583 mV which is equivalent to 61% of the theoretical Voc. Hence, the recent progress in Ge incorporation in CZTSe solar cells provided the foundation to further improve the performance which requires a proper understanding of the loss mechanism in these devices.
To address the possible loss mechanism of this type of photovoltaic device, analytical models of quantum efficiency have been studied as the spectral response of quantum efficiency provides the information about the spatial distribution of the charge recombination path. Gartner's model describes the collection function of minority carriers in thin film solar cells with the assumption of a complete collection in the space charge region and a 1-dimensional model with lateral uniformity.11 However, the heterojunction recombination is generally accepted as the main recombination source even with lower symmetry polycrystalline thin film devices.12 Hence, Hadrich13 and Kosyachenko14 demonstrated the analytical model with a constant electric field (CEF) based on the hypothesis of CEF for mathematical simplicity. To include the recombination in the space charge region, the half of the maximum electric field (E = Emax/2) is assumed at the heterojunction, justifying a case of CdTe thin film solar cells with the small deviation from the linear electric field (LEF) model with a long depletion width (1–2 μm). Recently, various approaches were employed to describe the photocarrier collection of CZT(S,Se) solar cells with the analytical models, assuming almost total collection in the space charge region with negligible recombination, and the CEF model by neglecting dominant recombination losses at the heterojunction interface.15–17 Furthermore, the total collection function of a drift component is greater than that of a diffusion component which leads to even larger deviation from the exact analytical expression if CEF is used.
In the present work, we fabricated Ge nanolayer (<10 nm) CZTSe solar cell devices (CZTSe:Ge) and developed an exact analytical model of quantum efficiency with LEF at the interface. We intended to apply the developed analytical model to the general bias-dependent quantum efficiency trend of fabricated CZTSe:Ge devices. Furthermore, a modified analytical model is developed to explain the unique spectral response of the quantum efficiency at forward bias with a higher concentration of the interface states. These defects at the interface alter the light and voltage bias-dependent trend. The analytical model is based on key parameters such as depletion width (doping concentration), lifetime of carriers, diffusion and drift length, surface recombination velocity, and the thickness of the absorber layer. The key parameters of CZTSe:Ge solar cells are quantitatively described for the quantum efficiency responses by considering the recombination losses near or at the CdS/CZTSe:Ge interface as well as the absorber layer. After developing analytical and mathematical expressions, the dependency of charge collection efficiencies in the space charge region and the absorber is discussed. Since the artifacts from the absorption coefficient obtained from pure optical characterization often mislead the comprehension of the absorber material properties,16 we utilize the reported dielectric functions, and refractive index and extinction coefficient to calculate the critical absorption parameters for CZTSe,17 CdS,18 non-doped ZnO,18 ITO,19 and MgF2.20
2 Experimental details
The Cu-poor and Zn-rich CZTSe (Cu2ZnSnSe4, with Cu/(Zn + Sn) = 0.78 and Zn/Sn = 1.20) thin film was synthesized on a soda-lime-glass/Mo substrate using a sequential process based on the deposition of Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn metallic stacks by direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering, followed by a reactive annealing under an Se + Sn atmosphere. The selenization was performed in a two-step process. The first step at 400 °C (heating ramp of 20 °C min−1) for 30 min and under 1.5 mbar of Ar pressure was followed by the second step at 550 °C (heating ramp of 20 °C min−1) for 15 min and under 1 bar of Ar pressure, with a natural cooling down to room temperature. Before the selenization, a Ge nanolayer (10 nm thick) was deposited on top of the precursors as has been reported elsewhere.21 The final thickness of the absorber was 1.8–2.0 μm. After several chemical etchings to minimize the secondary phases and to passivate possible defects on the surface of the absorber,22,23 a CdS buffer layer (50 nm) was grown by chemical bath deposition. As reported earlier,24 n-type CdS is doped by intrinsic defects, which is calculated by ab-initio theory that sulfur vacancies are dominant donor defects as they have the lowest formation energy.25 The typical doping concentration of the chemical bath deposited CdS in this work is 1 × 1017 cm−1. Following 50 nm CdS chemical bath deposition, the CZTSe device was completed by the DC-pulsed sputtering deposition of intrinsic-ZnO (50 nm) and In2O3–SnO2 (ITO, 350 nm) as a transparent conductive window layer. After ITO was deposited, the solar cells were mechanically defined as 5 × 5 mm2 and complete with Ni/Al front metal fingers and MgF2 anti-reflective coating. The electrical characterization was done with Agilent B1500 after calibration with the standard photodiode. The spectral responses of this sample were characterized using a PV Measurements QEX10 quantum efficiency measurement system with a xenon arc lamp and the spectral distribution of the photon flux at the outlet slit was calibrated with a NIST calibrated photodiode G425.
3 Modelling with analytical description
3.1 Electrical characterization
Based on the capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurement, we extracted the net carrier concentration using the method in ref. 26. To exclude undesirable effects from the frequency dependency (i.e. not too low or high), C–V measurements were carried out at 40 kHz. In Fig. 1, we calculated the average net doping concentration from the measurements of three representative devices as 5.0 × 1015 cm−3 which is a bit lower than the values reported elsewhere.27 The depletion width calculated is 277–297 nm. As reported earlier,13,28 the depletion layer of n-CdS/p-CZTSe:Ge is located almost all in the p-CZTSe:Ge absorber layer as CdS, ZnO, and ITO contribute negligibly to the photogenerated current, only causing optical losses. Based on this assumption, we will use these values for modelling and simulation.

3.2 Modelling

3.2.1 Basic equation. 
The analytical models are developed with the carrier collection efficiency model for the CZTSe:Ge solar cells and put in a mathematical expression. The external quantum efficiency, EQE(λ,V), is the ratio of the number of charge carriers collected by the photovoltaic device to the number of photons or energy onto the device at a given wavelength. When the various wavelengths of light in the spectrum are applied, the quantum efficiency corresponds to the spectral responses (amperes per watt) of solar cells per unit area, unit second, unit wavelength. (1)where Iph is the photocurrent, Φp is the photon flux which is equivalent to Popt/hν, and Popt is the optical power.
Since the ITO, ZnO, and CdS layers contribute negligibly to the photocurrent, these only cause optical losses. Accordingly, the EQE(λ,V) equation is related to the reflection and transmission of each material as given below: (2)where RARC is the reflectance of the antireflection coating (ARC), TTCO is the transmission of transparent conduction oxide (TCO), TZnO is the transmission of ZnO, and TCdS is the transmission of CdS.
Under the steady-state illuminated conditions, we derive the total current density under widely accepted assumptions which have no thermal generation current and no photocurrent contribution by an n-type CdS layer. Hence, the electron–hole generation rate by the absorber's absorption is described below: Ge(x) = Φp·α·exp(−αx),(3)where Φp is the incident photon flux per unit area and α is the absorption coefficient of CZTSe:Ge. To isolate non-transmission terms in the quantum efficiency eqn (2), we distinguish EQE(λ,V) and IQE(λ,V) so that we will be able to focus on developing a model for the carrier collection function with IQE(λ,V). As mathematically derived by Gartner11 and Sze26 with boundary conditions, the quantum efficiency is a sum of a drift component in the space charge region and a diffusion component in the quasi-neutral region. After simplifying the exact solution of Lavagna's model,29 Kosyachenko derived IQE.28 (4)
With the assumption of an abrupt p–n junction, the internal quantum efficiency is reduced to the widely accepted Gartner formula11,28,29 as no significant contribution of electron collection by CdS is expected:13,28 (5)where W is the space charge region width and Ln is the diffusion length of the electron .


3.2.2 Charge collection from the drift and diffusion components. 
As CdS does not fundamentally contribute to the photogenerated current, the depletion layer of n-CdS/p-CZTSe:Ge is located almost all in the p-CZTSe:Ge absorber layer, which is fundamentally similar to an abrupt n+/p junction diode or a Schottky diode.
Photogenerated carriers in the space charge region are assumed to be completely collected as a drift component after integrating the drift current (Jdrift).26 (6) IQEdrift = 1 − exp(−αW)(7)
Photogenerated carriers outside the space charge region are collected by the diffusion process without an electric field29 as follows: (8)
Consequently, the total internal quantum efficiency is the sum of eqn (7) and (8). With the complete collection of the carrier in the space charge region, the external quantum efficiency is revised after introducing the interface recombination term. (9)where h(V) is the interface recombination function due to the lattice mismatch between CdS and the CZTSe:Ge absorber, IQE(λ,V) is the internal quantum efficiency of the CZTSe:Ge absorber,30Sjunction is the surface recombination velocity, μe is the electron mobility, and Ejunction is the electric field at the junction.


3.2.3 Charge collection with the linear electric field at the space charge region. 
As mentioned by Hadrich,13 there is considerable interface recombination at the space charge region. A number of researchers identified that significant uncompensated acceptors and defects cause the recombination in the space charge region which fails the complete carrier collection model.28,31,32 To include the recombination at the space charge region, Hardrich revised a collection function (CFSCR)13 for the space charge region. (10)where τe is the lifetime of the electron minority carrier in the p-doped CZTSe:Ge absorber and t is the time.
Although Hardich introduced the recombination with the constant electric field at the space charge region successfully,13 the electric field in the space charge region is not constant. To reflect a practical situation with a feasible device model, we develop the linear electric field model by assuming nearly constant doping throughout the space charge region, which is, in particular, applicable to a device with a narrower depletion width (<1 μm). The electric field in the space charge region linearly decreases along the depth of the CZTSe:Ge absorber. Although the constant doping model is nearly close to the practical situation, it also requires a couple of assumptions due to the doping profile fluctuation with grain boundaries, fixed charges, impurities, and dimensionality. We mathematically derive the case with LEF at the junction. Hence, we are able to develop an alternative expression for the linearly decreasing electric field in the space charge region.
The alternative expression for the collection in the space charge region begins with the definition of the drift velocity, assuming the one-dimensional charge movement, which limits the lateral movement caused by non-uniformity. To simplify the mathematical processes, we define a new x-coordinate, x′ = 0, at the interface between the space charge region and the quasi-neutral region (x′ = W − x). Therefore, the drift time for the electron is as given below: (11)where an electron generated at point x′ is swept to the edge of the space charge region. The electric field inside the space charge region decreases linearly toward the quasi-neutral region of the p-type absorber layer and E(x′) can be revised to be Emax(x′/W). (12) (13) (14)
By defining κ(=μeτeEmax), the LEF collection function is (15)
After integrating throughout x (replacing x′ into W − x) using the incomplete gamma function (Γ), the drift component of the LEF internal quantum efficiency is (16)
For a diffusion component of the photoelectric quantum response, the exact solutions for the electron and hole are described26 for the case of a p-layer in a p–n junction, including surface recombination at the back surface of the CZTSe:Ge absorber. We assume only electron contribution of the absorber layer, considering that the hole collection is negligible due to the strong compensation with a large number of high p-type compensating defects in CdS.28 (17)where d is the thickness of the CZTSe:Ge absorber layer and Sb is the recombination velocity at the back surface of the absorber. The sum of the drift and diffusion components is the total internal quantum efficiency. The total internal quantum efficiency of the absorber for the revised LEF model is the sum of eqn (17) and (18). (18)


3.2.4 Revised total external quantum efficiency. 
The revised external quantum efficiency is the product of the total internal quantum efficiency, the recombination at the interface (eqn (10)), and the optical losses prior to CZTSe:Ge absorption. (19)
Although mathematical expressions for the non-uniform field are developed with the exponential electric field33 or two different electric field regions,34,35 there is a strong argument that the inclusion of various additional parameter sets for the non-uniform electric field only adds confusion with no additional insights.36 Moreover, the linear electric field model we developed is good enough to fit into the situation with CZTSe:Ge solar cells for our analysis which is shown in the following section.
We now compare the external quantum efficiency with the LEF and CEF models. In the CEF model, most of the carriers generated between Emax and Emax/2 in the space charge region experience the underestimated electric field by <50% whereas LEF provides the linearly decreasing electric field from Emax to Emax/2. At the point of Emax/2 where the CEF homogeneous mean field is assumed, the CEF model is effectively equivalent to the LEF model. For carriers generated with less than Emax/2 in the space charge region, the CEF model overestimates the electric field at least >100% to almost infinity and hence, the lifetime to pass through the space charge regions is overestimated by the same factor. Conversely, in the LEF model, the electric field is linearly decreasing beyond Emax/2, which effectively is a practical case with a constant doping concentration. In other words, LEF requires more time to pass through the depletion region which increases the recombination losses. In particular, this is the situation with the carriers generated under the electric field less than Emax/2 in the space charge region and the narrow depletion width (<1 μm) as compared to the longer penetration depth of light. Furthermore, this overestimated EQE response under CEF further deviates when the lifetime is short (∼1 ns) and the interface defect concentration is high, particularly in the case of CZTSe:Ge solar cells. Hence, the space charge recombination including Sjunction reduces the EQE responses in LEF whereas CEF underestimates the interface recombination.

4 Characterization and model comparison
To confirm the developed analytical model, we used MATLAB/Simulink to simulate and compare with the measured external quantum efficiency. To avoid the reported artifacts of optical characterization,16 we adopted the reported dielectric functions, refractive index, and extinction coefficient to calculate the critical absorption parameters for consistency17–20 and the electron lifetime is 1–3 ns for this analytical work.
In Fig. 2, the measured band gap from the derivative of the quantum efficiency curve is 1.11 eV and the total quantum efficiency-calculated short circuit current is 33.59 mA cm−2 at 0 V. The quantum efficiency spectrum for the best fit is analytically simulated with the measured model parameters, Ndoping = 5.0 × 1015 cm−3 and depletion width, W = 277–297 nm, to the experimental data. The fitted data at the applied voltage bias, 0 V and −0.2 V, consist of the drift component (dashed line) of the carrier collection and the diffusion component of the carrier collection (dashed-dotted line) as discussed above.
 Fig. 2  Comparison of experimental EQE curves (dots) with fitted curves (solid lines) at the applied voltage, Vapp = 0 V (red) and −0.2 V (blue). The color-coded dashed lines are the drift components and the dashed-dotted lines are the diffusion components. The EQE data at +0.2 V are added for the reference without fitting. 
Although it is expected to have non-ideal device effects such as interdiffusion, defects, 3-D lateral effects from the grain boundary, and so on, with the exception of slight deviations near 500 nm and 900 nm, a good match is found throughout the measured wavelength range region due to the modification of the depletion width by the applied bias at −0.2 V and no bias. The drift component at −0.2 V increases while the diffusion component decreases as compared to the opposite trend at 0 V.
Interestingly, the quantum efficiency measurement at 0.2 V is unique in the case of the presence of a significant amount of interface defects which is described elsewhere.37 With constant uniform doping of the absorber, this setting keeps the shape and the ratio of the quantum efficiency curves at different biases with reference to the near-full collection voltage bias (in this study, Vapp = −0.2 V) since the shape of the curves in quantum efficiency depends on the wavelength and is almost independent of the bias voltage.30 However, we observed a stronger drop at both <500 nm and >550 nm disproportionately whereas it is less near 500 nm. To investigate this further, voltage bias is held at 0.2 V while very weak (0.01 sun, 1 mW cm−2) bias lights are applied at three different wavelengths such as 400 nm, 660 nm, and 900 nm. In Fig. 3, with the same intensity of light, 0.01 sun (1 mW cm−2) at 0.2 V, the measured quantum efficiency at 660 nm (green) and 900 nm (cyan) demonstrates similar or almost identical trend under two different bias lights as compared to the reference quantum efficiency without light and voltage biases. However, a curve under 400 nm light bias (pink) is recovered completely close to the reference quantum efficiency level at 0 V without light bias.
 Fig. 3  Weak light biased (0.01 sun, 1 mW cm−2) EQE curves at 0.2 V. The curve in magenta dots is under light bias, 400 nm at 0.2 V; the curve in cyan dots is under light bias, 660 nm at 0.2 V; the curve in green dots is under light bias, 900 nm at 0.2 V; and the curve in black dots is under light bias, 400 nm at 0.0 V. The curve in blue dots is at no light and 0.0 V which is added for the reference from the previous figure. 
To accurately model this unique quantum efficiency at 0.2 V, a new parameter is introduced to reflect the wavelength-dependent doping near the space charge region by higher mid-gap interface defects, which is the so-called “electronic doping” near the interface region.38 The electronic doping or photo-doping effect happens when two or more sets of localized states interact with different capture rates for recombination, in particular, in the presence of deep defect states near the midgap at the interface. When the concentration of acceptor-type deep defect states is significant compared to the concentration of shallow donor states, acceptor-type defects are ionized and compensate intrinsic n-type doping. Therefore, this decreases the effective n-type doping concentration. Under light illumination, specifically short-wavelength blue light onto the interface, photons absorbed in the space charge region create electron–hole pairs. The photogenerated holes from the valence band are captured by the negatively charged deep acceptor-type defects near the midgap at the interface. This compensation of ionized acceptor-type defects increases the effective n-type doping concentration compared to the case without blue light. In the literature,24,39–41 there are different types of deep defect states near the midgap such as VCd, VSn, CuSn, and (VCu–VSe) based on the first principles calculation.
First of all, the CdS buffer layer is not affected and modified including defects whereas most of the arguments in the past focused on the CdS defect-induced modification. Rather, the defective interface layer between CdS and CZTSe:Ge is assumed where most of the interdiffusion occurs. Secondly, due to the complexity of the interface regions, we simplify and categorize the maximum electric field into two scenarios in the presence of uncompensated and compensated ionized acceptor-type defects by holes at the short wavelength near the interface. To avoid multi-parameter fitting and modelling errors, we introduce only two new parameters: the modified maximum electric field with the error function distribution and the associated recombination coefficient at each maximum electric field. Accounting for interdiffusion near the interface, the relaxing factor of the error function distribution for the defect is referenced to a peak of quantum efficiency near 2.4 eV (516.6 nm) which is the bandgap of CdS at the beginning of the interface (Table 1).

To illustrate the good agreement between the modelling and the measurements, the quantum efficiency measurement at 0.2 V is shown in Fig. 4 along with those of 0 V and −0.2 V from Fig. 2. We would like to mention that the data points near 900 nm deviate slightly from the data point taken from the rest of the quantum efficiency characteristics most likely due to the measurement artifacts. Nonetheless, the fitted curve agrees well with the data points at forward bias, 0.2 V, which shows a result consistent with the previous computational simulation results with a SCAPS simulator.37

Finally, we now discuss the elemental distribution and growth mechanism of the CZTSe:Ge nanolayer film, which influence the interface recombination with deep defect states. Using the same type of device with a series of Ge nanolayer thicknesses (0–50 nm), Giraldo9 and Marquez42 recently reported the growth mechanism of CZTSe:Ge nanolayer devices and Ge concentration gradient toward the back contact. During the initial selenization, Cu, Zn, and Sn up-diffuse through the surface Ge layer toward the heterojunction interface to react with gas-phase Se, which firstly forms Cu–Se selenide followed by Ge-poor CZTSe. Subsequently, Ge reacts with Se to form GeSe which vanishes when Ge incorporates into CZTSe. When CZTSe reacts with GeSe to form CZTGeSe, Ge occupies the Sn site and SnSe2 partially segregates at around 475 °C. During the dwell time at 500 °C, SnSe2 loss leads to the formation of voids near the back contact interface and further Ge–Sn interdiffusion induces the Ge compositional gradient toward the back contact with the accumulation of Ge. Consequently, Ge-rich CZTGeSe forms near the back contact and Ge-poor CZTGeSe forms near the front contact. The Ge concentration gradient toward the back contact influences the band gap energy with a gradual increase toward the back contact by ∼50 meV from the front interface around 1.01 eV. The [Ge]/([Ge] + [Sn]) ratio is estimated to be <0.14 based on the assumption that the lattice parameters vary linearly with the composition.42,43
5 Conclusions
We have analytically modelled the characteristics of the quantum efficiency of CZTSe:Ge devices under a set of bias conditions. The analytical and mathematical expression is derived based on the practical linear electric field in the space charge region assuming a constant doping concentration to accurately reflect the practical situation as compared to the constant electric field model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the analytical description, we fabricated and characterized CZTSe with a Ge nanolayer (<10 nm) followed by a series of measurements. The derived model with the linear electric field is used to fit and model the measured quantum efficiency data at different bias conditions such as −0.2 V, 0 V, and 0.2 V which agree well with the empirical data. The simulated model at 0.2 V which reduces the maximum electric field is assumed to have a higher concentration of deep interfacial defects near the space charge region, facilitating wavelength-dependent spectral responses in quantum efficiency by electronic doping effects. A good agreement with the empirical data was found with the modified electric field near the interface at the short wavelength regions.

 	Fig. 2  Comparison of experimental EQE curves (dots) with fitted curves (solid lines) at the applied voltage, Vapp = 0 V (red) and −0.2 V (blue). The color-coded dashed lines are the drift components and the dashed-dotted lines are the diffusion components. The EQE data at +0.2 V are added for the reference without fitting.	 

 	Fig. 3  Weak light biased (0.01 sun, 1 mW cm−2) EQE curves at 0.2 V. The curve in magenta dots is under light bias, 400 nm at 0.2 V; the curve in cyan dots is under light bias, 660 nm at 0.2 V; the curve in green dots is under light bias, 900 nm at 0.2 V; and the curve in black dots is under light bias, 400 nm at 0.0 V. The curve in blue dots is at no light and 0.0 V which is added for the reference from the previous figure.	 

CB effective density of state	2.2 × 1018 cm−3
VB effective density of state	1.8 × 1019 cm−3
Electron mobility	1.25–50 cm2 V−1 s−1
Hole mobility	1–25 cm2 V−1 s−1
Relative dielectric constant	9

 	Fig. 4  A modelled EQE curve with wavelength-dependent doping concentration at 0.2 V. The measurement at 0.2 V agrees well with the fitted curve except near 900 nm, which are most likely measurement noise. For reference, the data at 0 V and −0.2 V are present.
