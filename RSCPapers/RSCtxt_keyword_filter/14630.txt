    , Accepted 14th October 2015First published on 14th October 2015AbstractA solid-state mechanochemical synthesis of ZnxCo3−xO4 was developed with highly tunable Zn concentration. Photovoltaic performance was evaluated in dye-sensitized solar cells and tested with various Zn concentrations, exhibiting maximum performance with ZnCo2O4. Oxidative treatments led to a nearly three-fold increase in dye loading and a significant increase in short-circuit current density.
A key challenge facing the modern world lies in the development and implementation of environmentally-friendly energy sources. Mesoporous dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have been extensively studied since their first report in 1991.1 The highest performing DSSCs in the literature feature power conversion efficiencies exceeding 12% and use an n-type TiO2 photoanode as the working electrode.2 Analogous p-type DSSCs can, in principle, achieve comparable efficiencies with the circuit operating in reverse by replacing the photoanode with a photocathode. However, the current efficiency record is 2.55% using NiO, the champion photocathode material to date.3 The underperformance of NiO compared to TiO2 demands the investigation of alternate materials, which is an active area of research including, for instance, efforts to develop NixCo3−xO4 and Cu(I) delafossites.4–9
A DSSC is a solar-to-electric photovoltaic device that typically features one photoactive electrode, either an n-type anode or a p-type cathode, and one dark counter electrode, typically Pt. In a tandem configuration, however, the anode and cathode are placed in series and both are photoactive, allowing for a larger photovoltage and complementary light absorbance, with the photoanode absorbing blue wavelengths and the photocathode absorbing red wavelengths. Targeting a tandem design enables the use of photocathode materials with band gaps as small as ∼2 eV, which would typically not be considered for a conventional DSSC. Moreover, tandem solar fuel devices, such as dye-sensitized photoelectrosynthesis cells (DSPECs),10 can synthesize solar fuels by integrating molecular catalysts that store solar energy in a chemical bond. With current materials, the photocathode significantly limits the performance of a DSPEC or similar tandem device, further motivating interest in identifying new materials.10–15
ZnCo2O4 is a candidate p-type semiconductor that crystallizes in the cubic spinel lattice.16–18 The general spinel formula, AB2O4, features a divalent metal, A, tetrahedrally coordinated to oxygen, and a trivalent metal, B, octahedrally coordinated to oxygen. For example, Co3O4 is a spinel, consisting of one Co2+ and two Co3+. ZnCo2O4 can be considered a substituted Co3O4 material, where Zn2+ replace the Co2+ cations. The Zn2+ substitution results in a change in several material properties that are beneficial to p-type DSSCs, including increasing the optical band gap, conductivity, doping level, and hole mobility.17,18 A dense thin-film of ZnCo2O4 has previously been reported in a DSSC configuration.16 However, a high surface area mesoscale form is critical for increasing the light-harvesting efficiency of ZnCo2O4. Nanostructures of ZnCo2O4 have been reported for applications in catalysis and batteries.19–25 Here, we present a novel solid-state synthesis of phase-pure ZnxCo3−xO4 nanoparticles with highly tunable Zn stoichiometry, and we present the first report of p-type DSSCs using mesoscopic ZnxCo3−xO4 films.
ZnxCo3−xO4 spherical nanoparticles were synthesized via a mechanochemical solid-state preparation. Typical mechano-chemical syntheses require high levels of mechanical energy introduced via ball milling over several hours.26,27 In contrast, the preparation developed here is a highly facile, low-energy reaction using manual grinding of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and NaOH to form a mixed metal hydroxide of general formula ZnxCo3−x(OH)6, as shown in Fig. 1A. Upon calcination at temperatures ranging from 300 to 500 °C, a phase-pure spinel is observed. An advantage of this synthesis is that by simply tuning the starting ratio of cobalt and zinc nitrates, the Zn concentration in the spinel lattice is directly tuned. Five Zn concentrations were studied, where x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1, given the general formula, ZnxCo3−xO4. The morphology of the hydroxide and calcined oxide are confirmed via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, and the oxide forms nanospheres of 24 ± 5 nm diameter, as shown in Fig. 1B and C. The nanospheres form because of the significant change in density between the oxide (6.11 g cm−1) and the hydroxide (3.60 g cm−1).28

(B and C) SEM images of ZnCo2(OH)6 nanosheets (panel B) and ZnCo2O4 nanoparticles (panel C). Scale bars, 100 nm. 
Elemental composition of ZnxCo3−xO4 was analyzed via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), confirming that the Zn concentration is unchanged throughout the synthesis (Fig. 2A) and is facilely adjusted within the range of x = 0 to x = 1. Prior to calcination, any unreacted material is rinsed away with H2O. The synthetic preparation is described in detail in the ESI.† Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (Fig. 2B) show peaks consistent with spinel lattice. Notably, no peaks characteristic of a wurtzite phase are present in any sample, indicating the absence of ZnO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the presence of Zn2+ and Co3+ (Fig. S1†). To characterize the uniformity of Zn within the nanoparticles, EDS mapping in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) was performed, confirming a homogeneous composition in the material (Fig. 2C).

The ZnxCo3−xO4 nanoparticles were processed into thin films on glass slides by spin casting pastes prepared by a modification of literature procedures29 (see ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3A, the films are black, and absorbance spectra show increasing absorbance in the 300–500 nm range with increasing Zn concentration. Non-band gap absorbance, likely due to trap states, causes the black appearance, and future optimization will need to address these detrimental trap states. Tauc plots (Fig. S2†) were used to determine the band gaps, as shown in Fig. 3B, for each Zn stoichiometry. As the Zn concentration increases, the band gap also increases. The band gap of ZnCo2O4 is 2.17 eV, which agrees well with the literature value of 2.2 eV.17 With decreasing Zn concentration, the optical band gap decreases to a value of 1.85 eV for Co3O4, also in agreement with literature values of 1.8 eV.30

We probed the electrical transport characteristics of ZnxCo3−xO4 by measuring the conductivity and doping level of thin films (Fig. 4A). Conductance measurements performed with micron-scale electrodes (Fig. S3†) indicate that the conductivity increases by two orders of magnitude with increasing Zn concentration. Mott–Schottky analysis (Fig. S4†) yielded the doping level and valence band edge of each stoichiometry of ZnxCo3−xO4. The doping concentration (Fig. 4A) increased by more than one order of magnitude as the Zn substitution increased. This increase most likely results either from an increase in cation vacancies or an increase in the divalent metal (Zn2+) occupying a trivalent site (Co3+), consistent with previous reports.17,18,31 The electrical mobility of ZnxCo3−xO4 (Fig. 4B) was determined from the conductivity and doping level and shows an increase of more than one order of magnitude with increasing Zn concentration. The values range from a low of 2.41 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for x = 0 to a maximum of 3.58 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for x = 0.75. The measured mobility value for Co3O4 is on the same order-of-magnitude as literature values,32,33 and the mobility of the mesoscopic ZnCo2O4 is approximately two orders of magnitude lower than the previously-reported dense thin film.16 The difference can be attributed to interparticle hopping required for charge transport in the nanoparticle film. Compared to previous reports on NiO mesoporous films, mobility values of holes in ZnxCo3−xO4 are comparable given similar annealing conditions.34 To confirm conduction by holes and thus the p-type nature of the material, the Fermi level was measured via ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S5†), showing that the Fermi level is within 500 meV of the valence band edge. In addition, the Seebeck coefficient of ZnCo2O4 was measured to be a positive 8050 ± 10 V K−1 (Fig. S6†).

DSSCs were fabricated to probe how the ZnxCo3−xO4 thin films perform as mesoscopic hole-conducting photocathodes. Devices with all five Zn concentrations were prepared using 1.2 μm-thick films, the P1 molecular chromophore, and an I−/I3− electrolyte. Full experimental conditions are described in the ESI.† Current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics were collected in the dark and under AM1.5G one-sun illumination. J–V curves are plotted in Fig. 5A for all Zn concentrations. Full metrics are provided in the ESI in Table S1.† With increasing Zn substitution in the spinel lattice, the short-circuit current density (Jsc) increased significantly, ranging from 0.11 ± 0.02 mA cm−2 to 0.37 ± 0.09 mA cm−2 for Co3O4 and ZnCo2O4, respectively (Fig. 5B). We attribute the increase in current to the substantial increase in mobility. Absorption spectroscopy (Fig. S7†) confirmed that the dye-loading on all samples was the same (Fig. 5B), and, therefore, not the cause for an increase in Jsc. Methods used to quantify dye-loading are described in the ESI.† The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency was measured (Fig. S8†), confirming that the dye generates the photocurrent.

(B and C) Jsc (black circles and left-hand axes) and dye-loading (red squares and right-hand axes) as a function of Zn stoichiometry (panel B) and as a function of annealing condition for ZnCo2O4 (panel C). In panel C, annealing conditions are 1: air 300 °C; 2: UVO 200 °C; 3: UVO 200 °C, air 300 °C; 4: UVO 50 °C; air 300 °C, UVO 200 °C. 
Further material and device optimization was pursued on the highest performing Zn concentration, ZnCo2O4. Poor dye-loading relative to other metal oxides was identified as a performance limiter.35 Consequently, we attempted to increase dye-loading by increasing the oxygen concentration on ZnCo2O4's surface because P1 features a carboxylic acid linker group that requires a surface oxygen to bind to the metal oxide.36 It is possible for the surface to be metal-terminated as a result of carbothermal reduction, which can occur in the presence of the polymer, hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC), used to process the nanoparticles into a paste for spin casting. Annealing the spin-cast films at sufficiently high temperatures (≥300 °C) in air results in a combustion reaction of the HPC, leaving behind the mesoporous metal oxide thin films. These conditions are also favorable for a carbothermal reduction because of the presence of hydrocarbons, oxygen, and sufficiently high temperatures.37 Although these processing conditions are standard for n-type DSSCs, TiO2, an exceptionally stable metal oxide, is unlikely to undergo carbothermal reduction.37,38 Consequently, methods used for n-type DSSCs cannot necessarily be translated to p-type DSSCs, and separate methods will often need to be developed.
Operating under the hypothesis that dye-loading would improve with increased surface oxygen, we pursued alternate strategies to produce a mesoscopic thin film of ZnCo2O4. The films were treated in an oxidizing environment using an ultraviolet/ozone (UVO) system. The UVO treatment allows for the HPC removal at lower temperatures via alternate reaction mechanisms, producing a mesoporous thin film while preventing carbothermal reduction and maintaining the oxygen-terminated surface. When the films were treated only at 200 °C under UVO atmosphere (condition 2), a nearly three-fold increase in dye-loading, from 8.8 to 23 nmol cm−3, was observed compared to films annealed in air at 300 °C. UVO-treated films were then tested in a DSSC configuration.

Fig. 5C illustrates the changes in photocurrent and dye-loading with successive annealing treatments. Although the UVO treated films (condition 2) featured higher dye-loading, the Jsc decreased by 21% to 0.26 ± 0.04 mA cm−2. We hypothesized that the low-temperature UVO treatment preserved the oxygen-terminated surface advantageous for dye-loading but was insufficient to sinter the individual nanoparticles together to create an electrically interconnected, mesoporous scaffold. By combining the two annealing techniques, allowing for the UVO removal of the HPC at low temperatures and electrical sintering of the particles at higher temperatures in air, the Jsc improves from 0.26 ± 0.04 mA cm−2 to 0.38 ± 0.02 mA cm−2. The order of the annealing treatments dictates the device performance. Several conditions were tested, and we report a subset here (Fig. 5C) to demonstrate trends. The most successful process (annealing condition 4) results from three successive treatments of the film. First, the HPC is removed via a low-temperature (50 °C) UVO treatment. Second, a high-temperature air anneal at 300 °C electrically sinters the film, and third, a 200 °C UVO treatment increases the oxygen concentration on the surface, which led to the highest Jsc of 0.47 ± 0.04 mA cm−2, a 1 sun power-conversion efficiency of 0.025%, and a dye loading of 21 nmol cm−2.
Conclusions
Here, we have presented a solid-state preparation of nanoparticulate ZnxCo3−xO4 with highly tunable Zn concentration and a pure spinel phase. Tuning the Zn concentration within the spinel lattice improved the electrical properties of the material, significantly increasing the mobility one order of magnitude from ∼10−5 to ∼10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The ZnxCo3−xO4 nanoparticles were processed into a mesoscopic photocathode, which was characterized in a p-type DSSC configuration. Evaluation of DSSC performance with respect to Zn concentration resulted in the trend of increased performance with increased Zn concentration. Through further optimization, UVO treatments on ZnCo2O4 photocathodes resulted in a nearly threefold increase in dye-loading from 8.8 to 21 nmol cm−3 and an increase Jsc from 0.33 ± 0.04 to 0.47 ± 0.04 mA cm−2. This initial evaluation of ZnCo2O4 as a mesoporous photocathode demonstrates promise for the further development of this material for solar energy devices.
