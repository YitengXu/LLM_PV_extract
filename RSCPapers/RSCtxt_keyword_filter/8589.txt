    , Accepted 27th January 2020First published on 30th January 2020AbstractHerein, a new electropolymerized (EP) film named poly-triphenylcarbazole fluoranthene (p-TPCF) has been in situ synthesized by an electrochemical cyclic voltammetry method and applied to tune the work-function (WF) of the PEDOT:PSS hole-transporting layer (HTL) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Multiple techniques, including Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), light intensity dependent solar cell characterization, Mott–Schottky analysis, and transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements, have been explored to provide insights into the mechanism. Benefiting from the deeper work-function (WF), larger built-in voltage (Vbi), decreased recombination, and longer carrier lifetime, the devices with EP films exhibited superior device performance with simultaneously enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF.
Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted considerable attention because of their solution processability, lightweight, high flexibility and low production cost.1–4 Recently, OSCs have been developed rapidly and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) has also been continuously improved.5–12 Although the PCE of OSCs has increased rapidly, hole transporting materials in solution-processed devices are still scarce.13 For conventional devices, poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used as a hole transporting layer (HTL), owing to its aqueous solution processability, high transparency and excellent wettability to indium tin oxide (ITO) surfaces.14,15 However, the acidic and hygroscopic nature of PEDOT:PSS is detrimental to long term stability and ultimate efficiency.16,17 In addition, the fixed work function (WF) of PEDOT:PSS limits its application in BHJ systems with deep HOMO level donor materials.
To collect charge more efficiently in deep HOMO active layer systems, a deeper WF of PEDOT:PSS is a prerequisite. Several strategies have been applied to tune the WF of PEDOT:PSS, i.e., ultraviolet-ozone (UV-ozone),18 organic solvent treatment19,20 and component optimization.21–23 UV-ozone and organic solvent treatment are two simple methods but also bring some other problems, such as resulting in reduced hole current characterized by single carrier devices.17,24 On the other hand, component optimization can permanently alter the electronic energy level, such as by applying sulfonated acetone-formaldehyde (SAF) to replace PSS,21–23 and doping amphiphilic Nafion in PEDOT:PSS.25,26 Involving a buffer layer on top of PEDOT:PSS using an electrochemical deposition method is another strategy to tune its WF.
The electropolymerized polymer which is a unique kind of polymer consisting of π-conjugated segments has been applied to modify PEDOT:PSS as the HTL. These materials combine high surface areas and π-conjugated backbones with favorable photophysical properties relevant to organic electronics.27,28 Electrochemical polymerization (EP) is considered to be an effective method to form in situ polymer films on the substrate.29–35 Ma et al. firstly reported a C60-based electron-collection layer in inverted OSCs through an EP method.35 Then, they further prepared a crosslinked EP film based on an intentionally designed precursor, TPTCz, which was composed of a tetrahedral tetraphenyl-methane core and four peripheral carbazole groups.36,37 However, the resulting EP films need to be further electrochemically doped with LiClO4 to obtain a WF of 5.25 eV from the initial value of 4.86 eV, which is time-consuming and laborious during OSC device fabrication. Although an undoped p-TPCz film based on a carbazolyl triphenylethylene derivative (TPCz) has already been prepared by Liu et al.,38 it is still worthwhile to develop new design strategies toward high performance undoped EP thin films.
In this contribution, we in situ synthesize a new undoped EP thin film based on a triphenyl carbazole fluoranthene (TPCF) monomer on top of PEDOT:PSS to tune its WF. The evidence of the polymerization product is provided by the optical characterization and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra. The introduction of the EP film on top of PEDOT:PSS increases the PCE of the PTB7-Th:PC71BM solar cell to 8.99%, compared to 8.49% in the device with bare PEDOT:PSS. Furthermore, the mechanism study, such as light-dependent J–V parameters, transient photovoltage, transient photocurrent and Mott–Schottky analysis, assists us in gaining more insights into the effects of the EP layer on the charge recombination, the carrier lifetime, the charge extraction and the built-in voltage (Vbi) in the devices.
Results and discussion
The choice of using fluoranthene as the core is based on its several advantages including low cost, easy functionalization, good thermal and electrochemical stabilities, etc., and its derivatives have been successfully explored as efficient hole transport materials by us.39,40 The synthetic route to TPCF is shown in Fig. 1a. A mixture of compound 1 (0.74 g, 2.00 mmol), 2 (0.22 g, 0.50 mmol) (compounds 1 and 2 were synthesized as reported40,41), Cs2CO3 (0.49 g, 1.50 mmol) and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.05 g, 0.05 mmol) in dry THF (10 mL) and distilled water (5 mL) was heated to 70 °C under nitrogen for 24 h. After cooling down to room temperature, the mixture was extracted with DCM. The organic layer was collected, washed with distilled water and dried with anhydrous Na2SO4. After concentration using a rotary evaporator, the crude product was purified by column chromatography on the silica gel using petroleum ether/DCM (v/v: 1/1) as the eluent to obtain TPCF as a yellow solid (0.16 g, 34.6%).

The EP film was in situ polymerized using triphenyl carbazole fluorescence (TPCF) as a precursor via an electrochemical cyclic-voltammetry (CV) method in which the Ag/AgCl electrode was used as the reference electrode and a 2 × 2 cm platinum electrode was used as the counter electrode. After the electro-polymerized process, an EP film (p-TPCF) was in situ deposited onto the substrate and the CV curves with five cycles are illustrated in Fig. 1b. The film thickness can be regulated by the number of scan cycles as shown in Fig. 1c.
A series of optical characterization methods have been carried out to confirm the molecular structure of the polymerization products. Fig. 2a shows the FT-IR spectra of the monomer film and the EP film from 650 to 900 cm−1. The peak at 725 cm−1 in the EP film (and 723 cm−1 in the monomer film) is attributed to the disubstituted benzene ring of the carbazole ring, the peak at 749 cm−1 in the EP film (and 748 cm−1 in the monomer film) is attributed to the para-disubstituted benzene ring, and the peak at 807 cm−1 in the EP film is attributed to the trisubstituted carbazole ring, demonstrating the presence of dimeric carbazole.37 The intensity of the trisubstituted carbazole ring (807 cm−1) is similar to the intensity of the disubstituted carbazole ring (725 cm−1)42,43 Considering that the vibration intensities of trisubstituted carbazole and disubstituted carbazole are similar, it is revealed that almost all the carbazole in the EP film was transformed into dimeric carbazole.37,38

(c) Transmission spectra of PEDOT:PSS (black line) and the PEDOT:PSS/EP film (red line). (d) XPS N 1s spectra of the PEDOT:PSS/EP film (black dots) and fitting line (black, blue and red lines). 
The absorption properties of the monomer and EP films have been evaluated by UV-vis spectroscopies as shown in Fig. 2b. The monomer thin film shows an absorption peak at 377 nm in the UV-vis spectra. After polymerization, the absorption peak of the EP film red-shifts around 8 nm (to 385 nm) owing to the increase of the substitution of the carbazole groups and the expanded π-electron delocalization. Next, we examined the PL spectra of the spin-coated monomer and the EP film as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). Compared with the spin-coated monomer film, the EP film displays a redshift of 12 nm and the maximum photoluminescence wavelength (λmax) appeared at about 502 nm. These results indicate that a cross-linked film was formed by the electrochemical polymerization reaction of carbazole groups which may enhance the planarity of the molecules and cause a substantial increase in the extended π-conjugated backbone, resulting in red-shifts in the optical spectra of EP films. Furthermore, the transparency of HTLs significantly affects the amount of solar radiation in the device and the short-circuit current in organic solar cells. Thus, we compared the transmittance spectra of PEDOT:PSS and EP-modified PEDOT:PSS films (Fig. 2c). In comparison with the PEDOT:PSS coated ITO substrate, EP-modified PEDOT:PSS displays no significant difference in high transmittance which permits sufficient solar light to transmit through the HTLs. To confirm that the polymerization of TPCF occurs onto PEDOT:PSS, ellipsometry has been performed to measure the thickness of the p-TPCF film. As shown in Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI†), the thickness of p-TPCF deposited on PEDOT:PSS is 6.79 nm. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has been further performed to confirm that the EP film has deposited on the PEDOT:PSS film. As shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), the strong N 1s peak illustrates the presence of the N element. Moreover, according to the N 1s spectra in Fig. 2d, two narrow and high peaks can be attributed to the formation of the EP film which contains the carbazole group.37,44
AFM characterization has been widely utilized to explore the surface morphology and roughness information of thin films. Fig. 3a and b show the AFM images of the PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/EP film, respectively. As illustrated, the root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the PEDOT:PSS film is 0.686 nm, while the PEDOT:PSS/EP film exhibits a slightly larger RMS roughness which is 0.929 nm. This result demonstrates that the EP film doesn’t significantly affect the smoothness of the PEDOT:PSS film. KPFM has been applied to test the work function (WF) of PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/EP HTLs. Fig. 3c and d show the KPFM patterns of the PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/EP film, respectively. The PEDOT:PSS/EP film shows a deeper WF of −5.28 eV in contrast to the PEDOT:PSS film which shows a WF of −5.15 eV. CV tests have also been used to test the HOMO of the bare p-TPCF film. As shown in Fig. S7 and Table S2 (ESI†), the HOMO of p-TPCF is −5.30 eV which can be calculated using the following equation: HOMO = Eox − E(Fc/Fc+) + 4.8 (E(Fc/Fc+) is 0.1 eV in this test).38 This result is consistent with the KPFM result (−5.28 eV). These results illustrate that the WF of the HTL can be tuned by depositing the EP film on top of PEDOT:PSS, which may be beneficial for achieving better contact between the HTL and the BHJ layer with a deeper HOMO level. The band gap of p-TPCF was calculated according to the absorbance spectra shown in Fig. S7b (ESI†) and the value of it is 2.46 eV (shown in Table S2, ESI†). In addition, based on the HOMO and band gap values, the LUMO value can be calculated using the equation: LUMO = HOMO + Egap and this value is −2.84 eV.

Due to its good transmittance and superior WF, the PEDOT:PSS/EP thin film has been used as the HTL, compared with the control device with PEDOT:PSS HTL, in OSCs with a conventional structure: ITO/HTL/PCE-10:PC71BM/PFN-Br/Al (the device structure is given in Fig. 4b). In order to find out the best conditions for electrochemical polymerization, the concentration of the monomer solution, the starting voltage and the number of cycles have been optimized. In addition, to ensure that the polymerization occurs on carbazole groups, the cutoff voltage has been strictly controlled at 1.45 V, which is the oxidation potential of carbazole groups.

(e) J–V curves and (f) EQE curves of devices with PEDOT:PSS (the black curve) and with the optimized PEDOT:PSS/EP (the red curve) HTLs. 
As illustrated in Fig. 4c and Table 1, when the concentration of the monomer solution increases from 0 mmol L−1 to 0.05 mmol L−1, the PCE of OSCs is simultaneously enhanced and the best PCE appears at a concentration of 0.05 mmol L−1. When the monomer concentration continuously increases, the PCEs are reduced. The starting voltage also affects the film properties. As shown in Fig. 4d, when the starting voltage decreases, the Voc and the PCE become worse as well. The cycle number has also been optimized and we find that the best cycle number is 1 time. This can be attributed to the fact that the film thickness will increase with the increase in the cycle number and thicker films will influence the carrier transport causing poor device performance. The scanning speed of the CV process has also been tuned. As illustrated in Fig. S8 and Table S3 (ESI†), the device in which the EP film is deposited at 0.1 V s−1 exhibited the best performance. Moreover, to confirm that the reason for the performance enhancement is EP-film modification, devices with the PEDOT:PSS film treated by the CV process in solvent (CH3CN:CH2Cl2 = 1:4) without monomers have also been prepared. As shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†) and Table 1, compared with devices deposited with the EP film on PEDOT:PSS, this kind of device shows poor performance. This result can confirm that the performance improvement of devices after modification is due to the formation of the p-TPCF film. We note that the device exhibited the best performance when the voltage range is 0–1.45 V, the monomer concentration is 0.05 mmol L−1, and the number of cycles is 1 time. As shown in Fig. 4e, simultaneous enhancement of Jsc (confirmed by EQE measurements shown in Fig. 4f), Voc and FF lead to an improvement of PCE, reaching 8.99% in the optimal device from 8.49% in the control device with the PEDOT:PSS HTL.

Physical studies on the devices have been performed to further understand the mechanism of how the EP film affects the device performance. Light intensity-dependent J–V characterizations, TPV/TPC measurements, and Mott–Schottky analysis have been used to study devices with PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/EP HTLs.
The slope of Vocvs. Plight can be applied to disentangle the bimolecule (slope ∼ 1kBT/q) from Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH, >1kBT/q) recombination.45,46 As illustrated in the light intensity-dependent Voc curves in Fig. 5a, PEDOT:PSS-based devices exhibit a slope of 1.17kBT/q. In contrast, PEDOT:PSS/EP-based devices exhibit a smaller slope which is 0.97kBT/q. Compared with those of unmodified devices, the slope of the EP-film-modified device is closer to 1kBT/q, which illustrates that the SRH recombination or the charge trapping effect is insignificant.47 Based on this, we can infer that the charge recombination reduces in EP modified devices. In Fig. 5b, the photocurrent exhibits a power law dependence as ∼Plight which is equal to exactly 1 for all devices (on the double-logarithm scale). This is indicative of the first-order recombination present in these devices.48,49

The carrier lifetime can be calculated by fitting the transient photovoltage curves. As illustrated in Fig. 5c, devices with the EP film exhibit a significantly slower decay process. The decay times of PEDOT:PSS and the PEDOT:PSS/EP film devices are 62.97 and 77.01 μs, respectively. A longer decay time means that the device with the EP film exhibits an excellent carrier lifetime which will be helpful for enhancing device performance. The transient photocurrent curve can provide more insights into the charge carrier extraction. Fig. S11 (ESI†) shows the transient photocurrent curve of devices with different HTLs. The decay times of devices with the PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/EP film are 56.39 and 55.75 ns, respectively. This indicates that the device with the EP film exhibits a faster charge extraction. The prolongation of the charge lifetime and the acceleration of charge extraction both result in the improvement of device performance. Mott–Schottky analysis was performed to obtain information on the built-in voltage (Vbi) in devices with different HTLs. As shown in Fig. 5d, the Vbi of devices with the PEDOT:PSS and PEDOT:PSS/EP film is 0.72 V and 0.74 V, respectively. Compared with OSCs of PEDOT:PSS, the OSCs modified by the EP film exhibit a larger Vbi, which may be attributed to the larger Voc and also the enhanced charge carrier extraction.
Conclusions
In summary, we have synthesized a new fluoranthene-based conjugated small molecule TPCF, and through a facile electrochemical CV approach, an in situ polymerized p-TPCF film can be deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS layer for OSCs. After modification, the resulting EP-modified PEDOT:PSS exhibits a deeper WF to enable a more excellent Voc. Decreased recombination, longer carrier lifetime and larger Vbi are also found to simultaneously contribute to the enhancement of device performance. Our work provides a new conjugated EP film for anode modification. Moreover, after further optimization, this type of material will have a great application prospect in photovoltaic devices.
Experimental section
Materials
Acetonitrile, dichloromethane (DCM), methanol and chlorobenzene (CB) were purchased from Alfa, Aladdin, Acros and Sigma-Aldrich, respectively. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) was purchased from TCI. PTB7-Th, PC71BM and PFN-Br were purchased from Solarmer Material Inc. 1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) was purchased from TCI. PEDOT:PSS was purchased from Heraeus (CLEVIOSTM PVP Al 4083). Triphenylcarbazole fluoranthene (TPCF) was synthesized as shown in Fig. 1a.
Solution preparation
The TPCF monomer (0.05 mmol L−1) and tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP, 0.1 mol L−1) were dissolved in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and dichloromethane (1:4, v/v). The PTB7-Th:PC71BM (1:1.5, wt/wt) mixture was dissolved in chlorobenzene with a donor concentration of 12 mg mL−1. The active layer solution was stirred at 60 °C for at least 3 hours and 3% DIO (DIO:CB, v/v) was added 30 minutes prior to the spin coating.
Device fabrication
Firstly, ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned with distilled water, acetone and isopropanol (IPA) in an ultrasonic bath followed by ultraviolet-ozone treatment for 15 minutes. A solution of PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the ITO surface at 4000 rpm and thermally annealed at 165 °C for 15 minutes. Then the EP film was deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS thin film with a voltage scale of 0–1.45 V by an electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) method. After polymerization, the EP film was washed with acetonitrile and dichloromethane successively to remove adherent monomers. After this, the PTB7-Th:PC71BM solution was spin-coated at 2000 rpm followed by PFN-Br solution with a rotation rate of 4000 rpm. Finally, the Al (80 nm) cathode was thermally evaporated under high vacuum (ca. 3 × 10−4 Pa).
Characterization
The film thickness of the EP film was measured using a step profiler and an ellipsometer. The J–V characteristics of the OSCs were recorded using a Keithley 2400 Precision Source/Measure unit under standard AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) solar irradiation sourced by a XES-70S1 solar simulator (SANYOU Electric Co., Ltd, AAA grade, 70 mm × 70 mm photo-beam size). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra were measured using a Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System QE-R3011 (Enlitech, Taiwan). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy was performed using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (Spectrum One). The UV-visible spectrum was measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950. The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum was recorded using a Nano LOG-TCSPC. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) and kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) images were recorded using a Bruker Multimode-8. The transient photovoltage (TPV) and transient photocurrent (TPC) were determined using customized transient measurement systems (Physike Technology Co., Ltd) with a pulsed semiconductor laser (Coherent, Inc.).
