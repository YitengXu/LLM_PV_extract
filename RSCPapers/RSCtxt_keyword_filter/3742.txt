    , Accepted 30th November 2017First published on 1st December 2017AbstractP25 is one of the most widely used forms of titanium(IV) oxide (TiO2), routinely utilised in dye-sensitised solar cells (DSCs), where it is often employed as a control, in spite of its poorly defined nature and the typically low device efficiency (or possibly because of this). Work by Park in 2000 and later by Lin et al. suggests that the rutile component might not be to blame for this, as has often been claimed. Recently it has been observed that P25 has quite a sizable amorphous content. A method to selectively remove this non-crystalline material has been developed, allowing for scrutiny of the role this amorphous material plays. Here we compare hydrothermally treated P25 (H-P25) with the as-received material, realizing solar-to-electric conversion efficiencies of 5.3% and 3.2% respectively. More importantly, this reveals important information about the detrimental effect of amorphous TiO2 on DSC performance, with broader implications, as most researchers do not actively examine their synthesized materials for the presence of an amorphous component.
P25 has been adopted as a cheap source of TiO2 nanoparticles and has been widely used in photocatalysis and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSC) applications.1,2 As an integral component of a DSC, the photoanode provides a high surface area for adsorption of the sensitizer and serves as a medium for transferring electrons injected from the sensitizer to the charge collector and is commonly made of TiO2 nanoparticles.3 The crystal structure of TiO2 is, therefore, an important factor to be considered in designing efficient photoanodes for DSCs.4
P25 is a commonly employed control and understanding its chemistry is important and may have broader implications in DSCs and in other technologies (such as catalysis, batteries and super-capacitors among others).
Even though P25 has been widely applied in the photoanodes for DSCs,5 it is well known for its comparatively poor performance. The poor performance has often been attributed to the rutile component, with the conduction band edge of rutile being below that of the anatase phase by ∼0.2 V. As a first approximation, this could be expected to affect the open circuit value (Voc). Anatase is usually the preferred form of TiO2, with record efficiencies all attained using this crystal phase.6,7 It has however been seen that DSCs based on rutile photoanodes display similar Voc and fill factors (FF) to those obtained using anatase TiO2. The short circuit current densities (Jsc) of rutile based devices are however typically low,8,9 with Park reporting that the DSCs based on rutile photoanodes have Jsc values of around 70% of devices based on the anatase photoanode. This was attributed to the lower dye loading in the rutile sample. More recently, our group reported the application of high surface area, hierarchically assembled, 3D rutile nanorod assemblies as photoanodes for DSCs, utilizing a high extinction coefficient organic dye (D149) to realize a similar performance to that of anatase photoanodes with a similar total surface area (5.5% versus 5.8% efficiency).9 The difference in Jsc values here was only 13% with the FF and Voc again being close to one another. In light of these studies, which suggest that the solar-to-electric conversion efficiency is not inherently low for rutile based DSCs, the question remains as to why P25 shows such poor performance in DSCs and what the broader implications are.
Some studies have shown that the electronic structure of amorphous TiO2 is similar to that of anatase and rutile phases.10,11 On the other hand, amorphous TiO2 has localized trap states near both the valence and conduction band edges, due to the disordered positions of the O and Ti atoms, resulting from network distortion.10,11 Studies have also shown that the adsorption of dye molecules on TiO2 surfaces is strongly correlated to surface facets. Particles without well-defined facets are more likely to show worse surface dye packing, also resulting in an exposed surface, which is susceptible to charge recombination reactions.12–14 Faceted surfaces can also enhance light scattering which again contributes to improving the light harvesting efficiency.15 It is seen that amorphous TiO2 leads to a lower dye packing density compared to other phases.16,17 Thus, it is postulated that removing this amorphous TiO2 will improve the DSC performance.
It has been observed that P25 has a substantial amorphous content18 (which cannot be observed directly from the XRD diffraction patterns). Recently a hydrothermal treatment process was developed by our group to remove this amorphous material by selective dissolution and recrystallization.19 This modified TiO2 material showed a remarkably enhanced charge separation and photocatalytic efficiency as a result of the removal of recombination sites/barriers for charge separation. Getting rid of this amorphous content, while maintaining the high surface area, is, however, a challenge which needs to be considered. In another study, Kurian used water treatment to convert an amorphous TiO2 layer (15 nm), deposited by atomic layer deposition, to crystalline anatase nanoparticles, which resulted in improving the electron transport in TiO2 nanotubes. These were then used as a photoanode in a DSC,20 where the PCE was 3.9% and 4.9% for untreated and treated photoanodes respectively.
Herein, we use the recently developed amorphous content free analogue of P25 (H-P25) in a photoanode to investigate the effect of amorphous TiO2 on DSC performance, through comparison with devices based on P25 (N.B. TiCl4 surface treatment is explicitly omitted from the photoanode preparation). Significantly, DSC devices based on the H-P25 photoanode, sensitized with N719, showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.3%, compared to 3.2% for the untreated P25 photoanode.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the primary particle size and shape of H-P25 were similar to those of P25 (Fig. 1a and b). On the other hand, H-P25 has a large number of extended interfaces compared to P25, as indicated by the yellow arrows in Fig. 1a and b. The number of interfaces between crystalline particles was estimated for H-P25 and P25 by counting the crystalline particle interfaces across multiple (>3) high-resolution TEM images (HRTEM). Enlarged TEM images (HRTEM) for P25 and H-P25 (as shown in Fig. 1c and d) show a significant decrease in the amorphous material after treatment. For P25 the charge transport will occur either through amorphous TiO2 and/or longer routes. The TEM and HRTEM images show that the amorphous component removed during the hydrothermal treatment was converted to a crystalline material. As a result, H-P25 undergoes more aggregation and has more crystalline particle interfaces compared to P25 (see ref. 19). In addition to the crystal phase changes, the morphology is expected to impact the performance. The surface area of H-P25, obtained from nitrogen isotherm measurements, is around 20% lower than that of P25 (47 m2 g−1, compared to 57 m2 g−1, as shown in Fig. 1e and Table 1). The lower surface area of H-P25 can be attributed to the increased interparticle contact and a greater degree of agglomeration resulting from the redeposition of the dissolved amorphous TiO2. The inset in Fig. 1e shows that the pore size distribution of H-P25 is significantly changed after removal of the amorphous content, with the average size being substantially larger than that of P25. This leads to a slightly lower porosity than that of P25 (Table 1). XRD analysis shows that the diffraction peaks related to the anatase and rutile in H-P25 were more intense, indicating higher crystallinity (or larger amount), than for P25 (Fig. 1f). The compositional analysis was reported previously, showing P25 to be 76 wt% anatase:13 wt% rutile:11 wt% amorphous and H-P25 to be 81:19:0.19

The current–voltage responses of DSC devices based on either H-P25 or P25 photoanodes are plotted as shown in Fig. 2a. The key photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 2. Three devices for each were made (see Table S1, ESI†). DSCs incorporating H-P25 photoanodes exhibited photocurrent conversion efficiencies of 5.3 ± 0.5%, substantially higher than those of the P25 based devices, 3.2 ± 0.3% (Table 2 and Table S1, ESI†). The higher performance is mainly due to improvement in the fill factor (FF) and Jsc. The Voc was consistent between the two sets of devices. Jsc enhancements were further investigated by incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements (Fig. 2b). The IPCEs of the H-P25 based devices are higher than those of P25 over the 400–725 nm range, consistent with the higher value of Jsc resulting from an enhanced light harvesting efficiency and thereby an increased photocurrent value. The higher Jsc obtained from H-P25 devices can be attributed to the better light harvesting, in spite of the lower specific surface area of the materials, which is explained by the substantially higher packing density of these dyes on H-P25 compared to P25, (30 ± 1 and 24 ± 1 nmol cm−2) and (61 ± 1.5 and 48 ± 2.3 μmol cm−3) respectively. This was quantified using a desorption method to compare the light harvesting efficiencies for both photoanodes (Fig. S1 and Table S2, ESI†). This higher density of the dyes is attributed to more sites being available for dye binding on the faceted surfaces, as opposed to amorphous TiO2 (see Scheme 1). The optical properties of P25 and H-P25 films including transmittance, diffuse reflection, absorbance and absorbance of dyes, measured and reported in Fig. S2a–d (ESI†), show minimal differences in the transmittance and diffuse reflection measurements. This is in line with what would be expected, given that the dye loading per unit area on both films was similar – the effects of higher dye packing density and lower surface area on H-P25 canceling one another out.

 Scheme 1  Inhibition of electron recombination at the TiO2/I3− interface by a densely packed N719 layer on clean total interfaces (right), and irregularity spaced on P25 by amorphous TiO2 (left). 
Due to the major difference in the observed photovoltaic responses related to the FF, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed. EIS measurements were carried out under 1 sun illumination, to compare the electron transfer rates and lifetimes, with Nyquist and Bode plots shown in Fig. 2c and d respectively. These were analyzed based on the model proposed by Bisquert and co-workers.21,22 Parameters from the fitted data are shown in Table 3, with Rs referring to the series resistance, Rct1 and Rct2 to the charge transfer resistance at the counter and the working electrode respectively. CPE1 and CPE2 represent the constant phase elements associated with the counter and working electrodes respectively. CPEs are used in this EIS model instead of a simple capacitor as interfaces between the electrolyte/photoanode, and the electrolyte/counter electrode, which form double layer capacitance, are not ideal due to the diffuse electrolyte layer (leaky capacitor), surface roughness and nonuniform current distribution.22 Two semicircles were observed in the Nyquist plots, as seen in Fig. 2c, which were fitted (Fig. S3, ESI†) using an equivalent circuit shown in the inset. The first semicircle originated from higher frequencies and represents the electrochemical impedance of electron transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface. As expected this was very similar for both devices tested.

Meanwhile, the second semicircle at mid-range frequencies is related to the impedance of the interface between the photoanode material and the liquid electrolyte in competition with the transfer of injected electrons through the photoanode material.21,23 Devices based on H-P25 exhibit a lower electrochemical impedance to charge transport through photoanodes (36.5 Ω cm−2) compared to that of P25 photoanodes (45 Ω cm−2) which indicates better charge transport through H-P25. As shown in Fig. 2d, the frequencies of the local impedance maxima (ƒmax, low frequencies) in the devices were 79 Hz and 100 Hz respectively. The electron lifetime, calculated using τn = 1/2πfmax,24 in the H-P25 based cells was therefore observed to be longer than that in the P25 based photoanode, again indicating that electron recombination losses have been mitigated, increasing the FF of the device. Furthermore, devices based on H-P25 exhibit a higher chemical capacitance (Cμ) value compared to P25, indicating higher densities of shallow traps that receive more electrons generated from the excited dye (higher electron density).9 It has previously been seen that the amorphous material may form electronic barriers.16,25
This study has investigated the effect of removal of amorphous TiO2 in commercially available TiO2 (P25) on DSC performance. Amorphous TiO2 was dissolved and recrystallized to new anatase or rutile nanoparticles through selective hydrothermal treatment. The efficiency of DSCs based on H-P25 was enhanced by 44% compared to those based on untreated P25, due to an increased Jsc, along with a substantially better FF. The higher Jsc was attributed to the enhanced light harvesting due to higher dye loading on H-P25, in spite of the lower specific surface area. This is attributed to the surface construction of the crystalline material which is more favorable for the binding of the dye. The enhancement in the FF results from the substantially longer electron lifetimes, higher electron densities and suppressed recombination losses due to the removal of the amorphous barriers and associated defect states. While it is seen that amorphous TiO2 affects DSC performance negatively, the PCE of DSCs based on H-P25 is still low due to the high density of shallow traps (which is expected for such mixed phase P25), in spite of anatase and rutile being good materials for photoanodes in their own right. This study sheds light on an issue that has not been widely studied and can provide a more detailed understanding of the effect of amorphous TiO2 on the photovoltaic performance. P25 persists as a control for many research groups around the world, with quite variable performance. Furthermore, most researchers, ourselves included, have tended to ignore the role of amorphous TiO2 in the DSC photoanode. These findings may also be useful to explain the performance of other TiO2 samples, used in DSCs and other devices, where the impact of the amorphous content may go unnoticed.
