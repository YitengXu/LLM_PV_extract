    , Accepted 5th March 2014First published on 14th April 2014AbstractFour novel D–π–A–π–D-type small molecules (SMs) were synthesized and their π-linkage effects were investigated. Among them, SM2 with vinylene as the π-linkage exhibited better molecular coplanarity, reaching a relatively higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.76%. SM3 and SM4 with acetylene and acrylonitrile as π-linkages exhibited relatively higher open-circuit voltages (VOC) of 0.93 V and 0.90 V, respectively, owing to their deep-lying HOMO levels. These results gave an important guide for developing new materials in solution-processed small molecule solar cells.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) have developed rapidly during the past decade due to their advantages of easy-fabrication, light-weight, flexible and cost-effective device characteristics.1 Though solution-processed polymer-based BHJ OSCs have received much attention with PCEs over 9%,2 much effort has been made on the low band gap solution-processed small molecular OSCs, due to their potential of reproducibility, easy purification and good photovoltaic (PV) efficiency reproduction.3 To date, organic small molecules (OSMs) exhibit outstanding PV performance with PCEs over 8%,4 in particular, an encouraging PCE of 9.02% has been reported by Heeger et al.5 However, small molecules based BHJ OSCs still require a better material design.
In recent years, much attention has been paid to the linear donor–acceptor–donor (D–A–D) type organic PV materials.6 Because this design makes it possible to introduce monomer units with quinoidal character into the conjugated system, which can not only efficiently reduce the band gap of the material, but also tune the electrochemical properties through intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between donor and acceptor units within molecules.7 To date, the design of small molecular materials containing both fused thiophene and benzene rings can efficiently lower the band gap, broaden the absorption range and improve the device performance.8 On the other hand, the benzene rings inserted in small molecule materials usually sacrifice the relatively lower band gap for their larger aromatic resonance energy, compared with thiophene rings. The most creative solution is to reduce the aromaticity as well as dilute the effect of the benzene rings. This could be realized by introducing multiple-bond linkage between the benzene ring and the end-capping group, such as double bond and triple bond.1a,7,9 Moreover, it has been demonstrated that inserting vinylene into D–A type molecular architecture will enhance the conjugation degree and coplanarity of the OSMs, leading to the increase of ICT and short-circuit current (JSC).10 Furthermore, using acetylene or acrylonitrile groups as the π-linkage group could result in an increased oxidation potential, hence increasing the VOC. Zeng et al. have reported that a solution-processed OSM solar cell based on acrylonitrile linkage exhibits an impressive VOC of 1.04 V and a PCE of 3.85%.11 Although there are several reports about π-linkage of OSMs, it seems to lack systematic investigation. Therefore further study of the π-linkage effect on novel OSMs will be critical for deeply understanding the relationship between the molecular structure and property.
In this work, a series of novel compounds, SM1, SM2, SM3 and SM4, have been synthesized successfully, consisting of diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the electron-withdrawing group and triphenylamine (TPA) as the electron-donating unit. In addition, four linkage units, single bond, vinylene, acetylene and acrylonitrile, were introduced to form a D–π–A–π–D type structure. To investigate the π-linkage effect of synthesized compounds, we reported the detailed discussions on theoretical calculations, photophysical and electrochemical properties, hole mobility as well as PV performance. The chemical structures of the synthesized PV materials are shown in Fig. 1a. DPP was chosen to be the central acceptor for its exceptional properties with broad absorption and strong fluorescence performance, as well as for possessing excellent photochemical and thermal stability.12 The purpose of using triphenylamine (TPA) as the end-cap group was due to its good hole-transporting capability and solubility.13 Though both DPP and TPA have been regarded as excellent units for organic PV materials, the highest PCE value of the OSM donor based on the DPP-TPA unit reported so far is still below 1.81%.14 In this paper, the solution-processed OSCs based on SM1, SM2, SM3 and SM4 exhibit PCEs of 2.74%, 3.76%, 3.10% and 2.92%, respectively. These results strongly suggest that it is an effective approach to improve PCE of DPP-TPA based OSMs by selecting an appropriate π-linkage group.

Experimental section
Reagents and materials
All reagents were obtained commercially and used without further purification, unless otherwise noted. Toluene was dried by distillation from metallic sodium/benzophenone under a nitrogen atmosphere before use. All reactions were carried out in an air atmosphere unless otherwise noted.
Fabrication of a photovoltaic device
BHJ OSCs were fabricated with a conventional device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC61BM (1:2, w:w)/Al. The ITO substrate was pre-cleaned in water, acetone, toluene and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min, respectively. Then a thin layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS from Baytron P VP AI 4083) was spin-coated (4000 rpm, 60 s) onto the ITO glass. After being baked at 140 °C for 15 minutes, the substrate was transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box. Subsequently, the active layer was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 60 s with the blend solution of SMs and PC61BM (total concentration of 9 mg mL−1 in chloroform) on top of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS substrate. Finally, a 100 nm aluminium electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation through a shadow mask, yielding six individual devices with 5 mm2 nominal area.
Measurements and characterization

1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra were obtained using a Bruker AVANCE II 400 MHz spectrometer with CDCl3 as the solvent and TMS as the internal standard. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were collected using a MALDI Micro MX spectrometer. UV-vis spectral data were recorded on an Agilent Cary 5000 spectrophotometer at room temperature in chloroform solution and in thin film. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out on a CHI 610D electrochemical workstation from CH Instruments, Inc. On electrochemical analyses, the redox properties of these molecules were measured in Bu4NBF4/dichloromethane solutions. The glass-carbon electrode served as the working electrode, and the Ag/Ag+ electrode (Ag in 0.1 M AgNO3 solution of MeCN) and platinum wire were chosen as the reference electrode and the count electrode, respectively. A ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple was selected as the internal standard. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under AM 1.5 G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured with a SM-25 photoelectric conversion analyzer. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of blend films were taken using a Nanoscope IIIa Dimension 3100.
General procedures of Suzuki coupling reaction for the target molecules
A synthetic route is shown in Scheme 1. To a solution of compound 5 (0.2 mmol ratio), D (compound D1–D4) (0.5 mmol ratio), K2CO3 (4 mmol ratio), and Pd(PPh3)4 (0.02 mmol ratio) in dry toluene (10 mL), degassed deionized water (4 mL) and ethanol (2 mL) were added using a syringe under a nitrogen atmosphere, then the mixture was refluxed at 110 °C for 24 h. After being cooled to room temperature, the mixture was poured into water (50 mL) and the organic layer was separated. The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane (3 × 20 mL) and the combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The organic solvent was evaporated and the crude product was purified by silica column chromatography eluting with petroleum ether/dichloromethane to afford the pure product.

Results and discussion
Theoretical calculation
To examine the ground-state geometries, electronic-density distribution and energy levels of SMs, the density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the Gaussian 09 software at the Becke's three-parameter gradient-corrected functional (B3LYP) with a polarized 6-31G(d) basis.15 The theoretically calculated energy levels and electronic-density distribution are shown in Fig. 1b. The calculation results demonstrated that the electronic density of the HOMO was distributed over the whole molecules, whereas that of the LUMO was located predominantly on the DPP unit, indicating that an ICT process occurred from the TPA group to the central DPP unit. The DFT theoretically calculated energy levels and the band gap (Eg) are summarized in Table 1. Despite some marginal error in the calculated values, there was a consistent changing law between the theoretically calculated energy levels and the electrochemical experiment data. The theoretically calculated results gave an important guide for designing new materials.

Synthesis and thermal stability
The synthetic route of four SMs is shown in Scheme 1. The synthetic details of S1, S2 and S3 are shown in the ESI.† The DPP-based acceptor moiety, compound 5, was synthesized in three steps starting from commercially available 2-thiophenecarbonitrile following the procedures reported in the literature.16 Compound 1 was synthesized in a yield of 65% by Pd(PPh3)4 catalyzed Suzuki reaction of S1 and 4-bromoiodobenzene. The Heck reaction of N,N-diphenyl-4-iodoaniline and 4-bromostyrene took place to give compound 2 in a yield of 47%, with Pd(OAc)2 as the catalyst, TBAB as the phase transfer catalyst and KOAc as the base in DMF. Compound 3 was obtained in a yield of 93% by Pd(PPh3)2Cl2 catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reaction between S2 and 4-bromoiodobenzene.17 Compound 4 was obtained by Knoevenagel condensation of S3 and 4-bromobenzonitrile, using NaOH as the base in EtOH with a yield of 89%. Subsequently, the donor units, compounds D1, D2, D3 and D4, were synthesized by the Miyaura borylation reaction from bromo-substituted donating groups and bis(pinacolato)diborane.11,18 Finally, SM1, SM2, SM3 and SM4 were prepared by the Suzuki coupling reaction, using Pd(PPh3)4 as the catalyst and 2 M K2CO3 as the base in toluene at 110 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere with yields of 75%, 72%, 78% and 75%, respectively. The chemical structures of these synthesized compounds were identified by HRMS, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectra. The obtained OSMs are readily dissolved in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, chlorobenzene and dichlorobenzene, owing to the alkyl-substituted DPP as the central unit and TPA groups as ending units. The thermal stabilities of four OSMs were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1, as shown in Fig. 2, and the thermal data of the materials are summarized in Table 1. The onset decomposition temperatures (Td, at 5% weight loss) of four SMs are 411 °C, 415 °C, 411 °C and 409 °C, respectively. The results show that these materials are fairly stable for their applications in PV devices.

Optical properties
The UV-visible absorption spectra of the synthesized SMs in chloroform solution and thin-film state are shown in Fig. 3, and the correlated optical parameters are summarized in Table 1, including the absorption peak wavelength (λmax) and the optical band gap (Eoptg). As shown in Fig. 3, these compounds exhibited broad absorption covering 300–900 nm wavelengths in the solid state, owing to their D–π–A type molecular structure. The λsolmax in the long wavelength region were located at 618, 627, 621 and 622 nm for SM1, SM2, SM3 and SM4, respectively, corresponding to the ICT transition between the DPP and the TPA unit. In comparison with the absorption spectra in solution, the λfilmmax were red-shifted by 25, 34, 32 and 44 nm for SM1, SM2, SM3 and SM4, respectively, indicating a strong intermolecular interaction in the solid state. As a result, their optical band gaps (Eoptg) corresponding to their absorption onsets were 1.72 eV, 1.67 eV, 1.70 eV and 1.67 eV, respectively, in agreement with their electrochemical band gaps.

Electrochemical characteristics
The CV measurements were carried out to evaluate the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the synthesized SMs. Fig. 4 displays the CV curves in anhydrous CH2Cl2 solutions of 0.1 M NBu4BF4 under a nitrogen atmosphere with ferrocene–ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) couple as an internal reference. The HOMOec, LUMOec energy levels and the electrochemical band gaps (Eecg) could be obtained from onset oxidation potentials (Eox) and onset reduction potentials (Ered) of the CV curves according to the following equations:HOMOec = −(Eox − E1/2ferrocene + 4.8) eVLUMOec = −(Ered − E1/2ferrocene + 4.8) eVEecg = LUMOec − HOMOecwhere the unit of potential is relative to Ag/Ag+. E1/2ferrocene = 0.05 eV versus Ag/Ag+.19 The related electrochemical data (HOMOec, LUMOec and Eecg) are listed in Table 1. The HOMOec energy levels were −5.10 eV, −5.07 eV, −5.14 eV and −5.12 eV, respectively, and the LUMOec energy levels were −3.35 eV, −3.37 eV, −3.40 eV and −3.41 eV, respectively. These results clearly demonstrated that the synthesized OSM donors possessed appropriate energy levels to satisfy the requirement of solution-processable OSCs, with PC61BM as the acceptor. In comparison with P3HT, the synthesized four compounds gave rise to relatively lower HOMO energy levels. It is well known that the deep-lying HOMO level is desirable for obtaining high VOC since the value of VOC is determined by the energy difference between the HOMO level of the donor material and the LUMO level of the acceptor material.1a

Hole-mobility measurement
Hole mobility is a key parameter for both material design and device fabrication. To determine the hole mobilities of synthesized compounds, the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristic of each material is measured and the space-charge-limited currents (SCLC) model is fitted according to the Mott–Gurney law:20J = (9/8)ε0εrμh(V2/L3)where J is the current density, εr is the relative permittivity and assumed as approximately 3.0, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, μh is the hole mobility, V is the effective voltage, and L is the thickness of the active layer.
The J–V characteristics of hole-only devices with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC61BM/Au were measured in the dark, as shown in Fig. 5a. By fitting the J–V curves in a double logarithmic scale to a SCLC model, the hole mobility can be derived, and the results are plotted in Fig. 5b. The hole mobility values of SM1, SM2, SM3 and SM4 were 6.17 × 10−5, 2.68 × 10−4, 1.20 × 10−4 and 4.46 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, and the data are summarized in Table 2. The charge mobility in the BHJ film might be closely related to the charge stability, the morphology of the active layer as well as the intermolecular interaction, leading to the increase of the transporting property of the carrier. It was interesting to note that SM2 exhibited about 2 times and 6 times higher hole mobility than those of SM3 and SM4, respectively, which were consistent with their PV performance data (JSC and PCEs). Nevertheless, the hole mobility of SM1 is slightly higher than that of SM4, probably due to the better morphology of the SM1 based active layer, as shown in AFM images (ESI, Fig. S9†).

Photovoltaic properties
The PV properties of the synthesized SMs were investigated by fabricating solution-processable BHJ devices in a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/SMs:PC61BM/Al, and the corresponding device structure is shown in Fig. 6a. In addition, the related J–V characteristics of these devices are described in Fig. 6c and the corresponding PV data are summarized in Table 2, including the VOC, JSC, fill factor (FF) and PCEs. The PV devices based on SM1, SM2, SM3 and SM4 gave PCEs of 2.74%, 3.76%, 3.10% and 2.92%, respectively. Among them, the best PV performance of SM2 could be attributed to the vinylene linkage, increasing the rigidity and coplanarity of the molecular backbone, and facilitating intermolecular interaction, which was consistent with its high hole mobility. The relatively higher VOC values of SM3 and SM4 were proportional to their deep-lying HOMO energy levels caused by the acetylene and acrylonitrile linkage groups with the electron-withdrawing effect, increasing the oxidation potential. The JSC values of SM2, SM3 and SM4 were 11.90, 10.30 and 9.73 mA cm−2, respectively. The descending of JSC was in agreement with their hole mobility. In contrast, the relatively lower JSC of SM1 was probably due to the poor coplanar structure. Bearing in mind that the better FF value indicated good morphology of the active layer, it was interesting to note that SM1 and SM2 exhibited a relatively higher FF, which was consistent with their good bicontinuous interpenetrating network, as shown in the AFM image (ESI, Fig. S9†). As a result, the π-linkage units significantly affected the coplanarity of the OSMs and intermolecular charge transfer.7b,21

In order to deeply understand the relationship between the molecular structure and PV property, the dihedral angles of SMs were discussed. Fig. 6b shows the dihedral angles (θ) of SMs optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G (d) level. The θ1 is the dihedral angle between the DPP unit and the thiophene ring, θ2 is the dihedral angle between the thiophene and benzene rings, θ3 is the dihedral angle between the benzene ring and π-linkage, and θ4 is the dihedral angle between the π-linkage and TPA unit. The differences of dihedral angles θ1 and θ2 were less than 2° for all SMs, illustrating that thiophene and benzene rings were just beneficial for extending the conjugation length. The dihedral angle θ3 in SM1 was 34.03°, indicating that the coplanarity decreases with the introduction of TPA to the benzene ring, while the torsion angles were weakened in SM2, SM3 and SM4. There was a slight increase in the dihedral angle θ4 of SM2 and SM3 compared with θ3 of them, because the vinylene and acetylene as π-linkages could stiffen the molecular structure and eliminate torsion between benzene and TPA. Compared with the dihedral angles of SM2, a larger θ3 and a smaller θ4 of SM4 were observed, indicating that acrylonitrile in the D–A–D structure leads to a slightly twisted structure, thereby forming a relatively lower JSC. Obviously, in comparison with SM1, the relatively higher PCEs of devices based on the other three materials could be attributed to their better coplanar structure and strong intermolecular interaction. In addition, the coplanarity and intermolecular interaction lead to more red-shifted absorption spectra of SM2, SM3 and SM4 in films.
The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were measured as well. As shown in Fig. 6d, all devices based on these SMs exhibited significant photon-to-current responses in the range of 300–800 nm with the maximum IPCE of 38%, 45%, 43% and 41% at around 350 nm, and 31%, 38%, 27% and 30% at around 600 nm, respectively, which were consistent with their UV-vis absorption profiles. By introducing vinylene linkage in SM2, the IPCE spectra became broader and higher, which was attributed to its high hole mobility and strong intermolecular interaction, in agreement with its best PCE performance.
Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully designed and synthesized four novel DPP-TPA based D–π–A–π–D type compounds by introducing single bond, vinylene, acetylene and acrylonitrile groups as linkages, respectively. The best PCE performance of SM2 could be attributed to the vinylene linkage, increasing the coplanarity of the molecular structure and facilitating the intermolecular interaction, which is consistent with its high hole mobility. The relatively higher VOC values of SM3 and SM4 were due to the deep-lying HOMO levels caused by the electron-withdrawing effect of acetylene and acrylonitrile linkages. As a conclusion, we explored an effective approach to improve the PV performance of DPP-TPA based OSM donors by selecting an appropriate π-linkage. These results gave an important guide for developing new materials in solution-processed small molecule solar cells. Further experiments on device optimization are underway in our laboratory.
