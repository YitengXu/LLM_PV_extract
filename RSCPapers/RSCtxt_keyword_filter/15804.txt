    , Accepted 10th March 2020First published on 11th March 2020AbstractTwo phenazine copolymer donors P1 and P2 were developed. P1 and P2 have deep highest occupied molecular orbital levels, enhanced light-harvesting capability and good hole mobility. Solar cells based on P2 and a nonfullerene acceptor, Y6, gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 15.14%, which has been the highest value achieved by phenazine-donor-based solar cells to date.
Phenazine (Pz) is an important polycyclic aromatic compound with a long history which can be traced back to the 19th century.1 It shows wide applications in synthetic dyes, biology and pharmacy.2Pz found applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs),3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs)4 and organic solar cells (OSCs).5 In 2011, Cao et al. first reported a Pz copolymer donor PCzTTPz for OSCs.5a The solar cells based on PCzTTPz and a fullerene acceptor PC71BM gave a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.0%. In the same year, the Marder group and Jen group reported two Pz copolymer donors, P3 and PIDT-phanQ, giving PCEs of 1.4% and 6.24%, respectively.5b,c After these reports, several groups developed a bunch of Pz-based polymer and small molecule donors, affording 0.3–5.7% PCEs in fullerene-based OSCs.5j Very recently, Moon et al. developed a Pz polymer donor PIDTT-Phz. Blending PIDTT-Phz with PC71BM or with a nonfullerene acceptor ITIC gave PCEs of 6.7% and 3.1%, respectively.5k The above results demonstrated the potential of Pz building blocks for OSCs. As highly efficient nonfullerene OSCs have advanced rapidly in recent years,6Pz copolymers deserve further exploration. In this work, we designed and synthesized two fused-ring Pz units, dithieno[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (DTPz) and 9,10-difluorodithieno[3,2-a:2′,3′-c]phenazine (FDTPz) (Fig. 1). Compared with reported Pz-units, DTPz and FDTPz show better coplanarity when constructing D–A copolymer donors. Two copolymers P1 and P2 based on DTPz and FDTPz, respectively, showed good performance in OSCs. Solar cells based on P2 and a nonfullerene acceptor Y67 gave a PCE of 15.14%, which has been the highest efficiency achieved for Pz-based donors to date.

The synthetic route to P1 and P2 is shown in Scheme 1. Treating benzo[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene-4,5-dione with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) gave compound 1 in 66% yield. Condensation of 1 with benzene-1,2-diamine or 4,5-difluorobenzene-1,2-diamine afforded DTPz-Br or FDTPz-Br in 97% yield, respectively. Stille coupling of DTPz-Br or FDTPz-Br with (4-(2-hexyldecyl)thiophen-2-yl)trimethylstannane gave compound 2a or 2b in 87% or 72% yield, respectively. Bromination of 2a or 2b with NBS gave the monomer, compound 3a or 3b, in 92% or 94% yield, respectively. Finally, Stille copolymerization of 3a or 3b with (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-chlorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) (ClBDT-Sn) gave P1 or P2 in 81% or 73% yield, respectively. All compounds were characterized by spectroscopic techniques, i.e.1H NMR, 13C NMR and mass spectrometry. Both P1 and P2 show good solubility in common solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene. The number-average molecular weights (Mn) and the polydispersity index (PDI) are 53.5 kDa and 2.35 for P1 and 55.2 kDa and 1.82 for P2, respectively.

The absorption spectra of P1, P2 and Y6 films are shown in Fig. 2a. P1 or P2 presents two absorption bands, a weak band at 340–420 nm and a strong band at 420–700 nm. The 340–420 nm band could come from the characteristic absorption of the fused-ring Pz moiety (Fig. S13, ESI†). It gifts the copolymer stronger light-harvesting capability in the short-wavelength region. The absorption onsets for P1 and P2 films are 667 nm and 693 nm, respectively, corresponding to optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of 1.86 eV and 1.79 eV, respectively. The smaller Eoptg of P2 than P1 suggests the stronger electron-accepting capability of FDTPz than DTPz, which strengthens the intramolecular charge transfer and leads to a bandgap shrink. As shown in Fig. 2a, the absorption of Y6 is complementary with that of P1 and P2. The energy levels for P1 and P2 were estimated by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. S14, ESI†).8 The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels for P1 and P2 are −5.33 eV and −5.46 eV, respectively, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels are −2.94 eV and −3.16 eV, respectively (Fig. 2b). The fluorine atoms lower both the HOMO and LUMO levels for P2, but they lower the LUMO more. The deep HOMO levels of P1 and P2 favor the production of a high open-circuit voltage (Voc) in solar cells. To gain more structural information of the copolymers, we built up models for P1 and P2 and performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations (Fig. 3).9 The geometries for P1 and P2 were optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The optimized structures of P1 and P2 show that the dihedral angles between the fused-ring Pz units and the thiophene units are small (6.0–12.8°), indicating the good coplanarity of the DTPz and FDTPz units. Previously reported Pz units show larger dihedral angles and poor coplanarity.5d The good coplanarity facilitates polymer packing and charge transport.

Conventional solar cells with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al were made to evaluate the performance of P1 and P2. J–V curves and external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra for the best cells are shown in Fig. 4a and b, respectively, and the performance data are listed in Table 1. The best P1:Y6 cells gave a PCE of 12.30%, with a Voc of 0.777 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 25.70 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 61.6%. These cells have a D/A ratio of 1:1.6 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 99 nm and 1 vol% diphenyl ether (DPE) as the additive (Tables S1–S3, ESI†). The best P2:Y6 cells gave a PCE of 15.14%, with a Voc of 0.867 V, a Jsc of 26.53 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.8%. These cells have a D/A ratio of 1:1.4 (w/w), an active layer thickness of 101 nm and 1 vol% DPE as the additive (Tables S4–S6, ESI†). Compared with P1 cells, P2 cells gave a higher Voc due to the deeper HOMO level of P2. High Jsc values were achieved for both cells. As shown in Fig. 4b, both cells gave >70% EQE at 450–820 nm. P2 cells afforded a higher EQE than P1 cells in the short wavelength region. The exciton dissociation probabilities (Pdiss) for P1 and P2 cells are 87.9% and 94.9%, respectively, suggesting more efficient charge generation in P2 cells (Fig. S15, ESI†). We studied bimolecular recombination by plotting Jsc against light intensity (Plight) (Fig. S16, ESI†).10 The data were fitted to a power law: Jsc ∝ Plightα. The α values for P1 and P2 cells are 0.933 and 0.958, respectively, suggesting lower bimolecular recombination in the latter. Higher Jsc and lower charge recombination for P2 cells suggest a better charge-transporting capability for P2. Hole mobilities (μh) were measured for P1 and P2 films using the space charge limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S17, ESI†).11P2 shows a higher μh of 7.74 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 than P1 (2.00 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1). The μh and electron mobilities (μe) were also measured for the blend films (Fig. S18 and S19, ESI†). Compared with the P1:Y6 blend film, the P2:Y6 blend film has higher μh (3.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (2.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1), and more balanced charge carrier transport (μh/μe = 1.41) (Table S7, ESI†). The morphology of the active layers was studied using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. S20, ESI†). The root-mean-square roughnesses of the P1:Y6 and P2:Y6 blend films are 1.49 nm and 1.95 nm, respectively.

Conclusions
In summary, two copolymer donors P1 and P2 based on fused-ring Pz building blocks were developed. P1 and P2 possess deep HOMO levels, enhanced light-harvesting capability and good hole mobility. Solar cells based on them gave PCEs up to 15.14%, which has been the highest efficiency achieved from Pz-based donors to date. This work demonstrates the great potential of Pz copolymer donors for nonfullerene organic solar cells.
