    , Accepted 19th September 2022First published on 19th September 2022AbstractPolymer donor materials have been considered as a game changer, especially in the early history of polymer solar cells. However, much progress is the result of hard work resulting from hit and miss experiments. A deeper understanding of the electronic behavior of polymeric materials is necessary to select efficient materials for polymer solar cells. A detailed computational analysis is performed on the chalcogen-based polymers CP1, CP2, and CP3 to study the effect of chalcogen atoms on their non-covalent interactions, structural and electronic properties. The alteration of the chalcogen atoms significantly changed the electronic and excited behavior of the polymers. Moreover, the chalcogen atoms also exerted a significant effect on nearby groups. Selenium had more of a polarization effect on molecules compared with other chalcogen atoms. Polymer:Y6 complexes were also studied to determine rules for donor:acceptor pair selection. Significance changes were observed on changing the chalcogen atoms. The sulfur and selenium-based polymers CP2 and CP3 exhibited higher density of states near to the Fermi level in comparison with the oxygen-based polymer CP1. The effect of chalcogen atoms on molecular packing and blend morphology was studied using molecular dynamics simulations. The sulfur-based polymer showed closer packing compared with the other polymers in both pure and blended form. The selenium-based polymer CP3 showed lower free energy of mixing and Flory–Huggins parameter values for various solvents. Our detailed multi-dimensional modelling thus has the potential to assist in the practical design of chalcogen-based polymers for efficient polymer solar cells.
1. Introduction
Polymer solar cells have gained widespread popularity due to their exclusive advantages, such as flexibility, solution processability and semitransparency.1 The performance of organic solar cells has increased significantly. However, it has been the result of long-term hard work. All over the world, many groups are working in this field. Both polymers and small molecules have been extensively used as active layer materials, both with their own advantages and disadvantages.2,3 Mostly polymer donors are designed as donor–acceptor alternative conjugated polymers using a suitable combination of electron-rich and electron-deficient groups.4,5 This is an efficient way to achieve push-full characteristics that are necessary for free charge generation. The strength of electron-rich and electron-deficient groups controls the interaction between polymer molecules as well as the interaction between them and their counterparts.6,7 To achieve the goal of the commercial application of polymer solar cells, it is essential to develop better donor–acceptor alternative conjugated polymers and thereby further boost the performance of polymer solar cells.8
In the literature, several structural design strategies have been reported. You et al. introduced different heteroatoms and substituents to benzotriazole-based conjugated polymers.9 A cyano (CN) group had a greater impact on the benzotriazole core compared to a nitrogen atom as the cyano group is more electron-withdrawing than nitrogen. Cyano-based polymers exhibit high power conversion efficiency (PCE). Huang et al. have also studied the effect of CN substitution position on the performance of dicyanodistyryl benzene-based polymers,10 with the results indicating that the substitution position has a significant effect on the PCE of polymer solar cells. In another study, You et al. fluorinated a conjugated linker that joins electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties.11 Fluorination lowers energy levels and increases efficiency compared to nonfluorinated counterparts mainly due to the increase in open-circuit voltage (VOC). They have also studied the effect of the position of fluorine on the backbone of polymers,12 with no significant difference observed in the efficiency of solar cell devices. Li et al. synthesized two quinoxaline-based polymers differing in fluorothiophene.13 The polymer with two alkyl-substituted fluorothiophenes showed stronger intermolecular interactions, redshifted absorption, and higher hole mobility, resulting in a high PCE. The tuning of the structural behavior of polymers through a change in alkyl chains is another strategy to by which to enhance the PCE of polymer solar cells.14
Using chalcogen atoms to tune the structural properties of polymers is also a useful strategy,15–18 with oxygen (O), sulphur (S), and selenium (Se) being the most commonly used chalcogen atoms. Cho et al. synthesized three polymers based on dithienobenzochalcogenadiazole (with O, S and Se).19 The findings of the study indicated that the change in electronegativity and size of the atoms affected the intrinsic properties, morphological features and PCE if the materials, with the polymers containing S showing the highest PCEs. Hou et al. synthesized three polymers containing chalcogen atoms on a π-spacer.20 S- and Se-based polymers exhibit more planar conjugated backbones compared to O-based polymers, and also have much higher PCEs than O-based polymers. Min et al. synthesized three fused-ring conducted polymers featuring furan, thiophene and selenophene as π-spacers.21 This structural engineering has affects intermolecular interactions and charge transport properties. Here, a solar cell device fabricated with a Se-based polymer showed the highest PCE.
It is well-known that experimental work is expensive and time consuming. It is very difficult to study a large number of materials using experiments.22,23 Due to the structural versatility of organic semiconductors, a large number of polymers are possible.24,25 However, so far, only a limited number of materials have been studied. Therefore, computational simulations are an important solution to this problem. Quantum chemical calculations can be applies to a large number of organic semiconductors. Density functional theory (DFT) is one of the quantum chemical calculation methods that is very efficient and widely used in organic solar cell research.26–28 DFT can provide valuable information about different aspects of organic semiconductors. DFT can help to study the electronic behavior of semiconductors to check their suitability for use in organic solar cells. DFT can also be used to study non-covalent interactions.
Electrons, the workhorses of the light-to-electricity conversion process, are key objects of interest. Solar cell devices absorb solar light and generate free charges. Donor and acceptor materials are major components of organic solar cells, both absorbing light. The working of OSCs can be explained in the following steps: light absorption, exciton generation, exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, and charge transport to the respective electrodes. The chemistry of used materials matters most. The detailed analysis of electronic properties related to free charge generation and the excited state behavior of molecules can provide deeper understanding. Therefore, a multi-dimensional modelling from the molecular to the bulk level is essential.
In the present work, our aim is to provide detailed insight for the judicious design of conjugated polymer donors. New polymers differing in chalcogen atoms are designed (Fig. 1). We have tried to develop structure–property relationships for these polymers. Detailed computational analysis was performed to study the effect of chalcogen atoms on the non-covalent interactions, structural and electronic properties of the materials. Structural similarity analysis was also conducted to quantify the structural changes after chalcogen atom change. Molecular packing was studied through radial distribution calculated using trajectory data obtained from molecular dynamic simulations. With the help of free energy of mixing and Flory–Huggins parameters, a cheaper and fast method is introduced for the solvent selection of polymers.

2. Computational details
2.1. DFT calculations
In this study, all the calculations were performed using Gaussian 09.29 To reduce the calculation time, the alkyl chains were replaced with methyl groups as the alkyl chains do not strongly affect the electronic properties. The monomer structures of polymers are optimized in the ground state using density functional theory (DFT). B3LYP functional is used for this purpose, with 6-31G(d,p) used as a basis set. The absence of imaginary frequencies confirmed the success of optimization. The excited state behavior was studied using time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) employing the CAM-B3LYP functional instead of B3LYP. In the study of the excited state behavior of molecules CAM-B3LYP is more accurate than B3LYP.30–32
2.2. Molecular dynamics simulations
Molecular dynamics simulations were performed using Materials Studio 6.1.33 Cubic simulation boxes were constructed using Amorphous Cell module. For pure polymer, 100 monomers were put in a simulation box with 0.5 g cm−3 density. To construct simulation boxes for a polymer:Y6 blend, 50 monomers and 50 Y6 molecules with density of 0.5 g cm−3 were used. The size of the simulation boxes was 70 Å × 70 Å × 70 Å. Molecular dynamics simulations were implemented using the Forcite module. The COMPASS force field and force-field-assigned charges were used. For both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions, group-based summation methods were used. A 100 ps MD simulation in the constant number N of particles, volume V, and total energy E (NVE) ensemble with a time step of 1 fs was conducted at T = 298 K. The blends module was used to calculate the free energy of mixing and Flory–Huggins parameter (χ).
3. Results and discussion
The electronic behavior of materials is related to their chemical structures.34–36 To select better materials, it is therefore essential to gain a deeper understanding of their electronic behavior. Therefore, in the present work, a detailed study was performed to analyse the effect of chalcogen atoms on polymer donors from various perspectives.
3.1. Geometries
It is well-known that planar systems are good for enhancing intramolecular charge transfer.37 Therefore, planarity plays a significant role in controlling their performance in polymer solar cells. The top and side views of the optimized geometries of polymers are given in Fig. 2. Only in the case of CP1 is the electron-deficient group slightly out of the main plane because the nitrogen of the electron-deficient group and the oxygen of the furan are electron rich. The absence of non-covalent interactions leads to a slight deviation from planarity. In other molecules, S and Se are electron deficient; they can form non-covalent interactions. In the case of CP2 and CP3, thiophene and selenophene are respectively out of plane. However, these groups are not part of the main chain. So, such deviation from planarity does not have a significant negative effect on the conjugation system.

3.2. Frontier molecular orbital analysis
As mentioned above, a detailed instinctive understanding of electronic behavior is necessary. For this purpose, wavefunctions are useful as they help to understand polaron delocalization. To achieve charge separation, extensive polaron delocalization is essential. Graphical representations of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) are given in Fig. 3, from which it is clearly indicated that HOMOs are found on the electron-rich part and LUMOs are found on the electron-deficient part of the molecule. This situation facilitates intramolecular charge transfer.

3.3. Electrostatic potential
Electrostatic potential (ESP) is used to locate nucleophilic and electrophilic sites on molecules.38–40 Electron density on the various positions of molecules can be found using an electrostatic potential map. ESP maps of polymers are given in Fig. 4(a). In CP1, electron-rich and electron-deficient regions are highly mixed. In the case of CP2 and CP3, there is a clear distinction between electron-rich and electron-deficient regions. The bar plots of ESP values of individual atoms are given in Fig. 4(b). The label numbers of chalcogen atoms are from 68 to 73. In the case of CP1, the average ESP values are negative. In the case of CP2, the chalcogen atoms have lower negative values. In the case of CP3, the chalcogen atoms (Se) exhibit more positive average ESP values. In the case of CP3, the ESPs of the non-chalcogen atoms are also positive compared to the other molecules. From this, it is clear that a change in chalcogen atoms affects other atoms in the molecules.

The quantification of molecular surfaces is a powerful tool by which to study organic semiconductors.41,42 The results of the quantitative analysis of surfaces are given in Table 1. The overall average values of CP2 are positive and negative for CP1 and CP3. The overall average values increased on going from CP1 to CP3. Overall, the molecular polarity shows the same trend, with the polymers become more polar on going from CP1 to CP3. This increase in polarity decreases the exciton binding energy.

3.4. Density of states
Along with the total density of states (TDOS), partial density of states (PDOS) were also calculated. For this purpose, molecules were partitioned into two segments. The parts of molecules where the chalcogens are introduced were put into fragment 1, while the parts of molecules on which no structural engineering was conducted were put in fragment 2. The fragmentation is graphically represented in Fig. 5. The density of states of the polymers are given in Fig. 6. CP2 and CP3 have high density of states near the Fermi level, meaning that they are good semi-conductors. There was no structural change on fragment 2, but still the PDOS of fragment changed, indicating that the chalcogen atoms affect nearby groups.

3.5. Non-covalent interaction (NCI) analysis
Non-covalent interactions play an important role in the packing of molecules.43,44 Their analysis is thus necessary to find better materials. The non-covalent interactions were studied using a reduced density gradient method. A visual representation of the non-covalent interactions of polymer:Y6 complex dimers are given in Fig. 7a, where the blue color indicates attractive interactions, the red color indicates steric effects, and the green zone indicates van der Waals interactions. All the complexes exhibited similar attractive forces and van der Waals interactions. However, CP1:Y6 and CP3:Y6 exhibited more repulsive interactions. The scatter plots of non-covalent interactions are given in Fig. 7b. The attractive interactions are the same. CP2:Y6 exhibits less repulsive interactions.

3.6. Charge density difference
Charge density differences (CDDs) were calculated for the four lowest excited states, with the results presented in Fig. 8. The CDD diagram helps to visualize charge transfer, were the green color represents the depletion of charge and the red color represents the accumulation of charge. In the case of CP1:Y6, for the S1 and S4 states, charge depletion and accumulation took place on Y6, for the S2 and S3 states, charge depletion took place on CP1 and charge accumulation took place on Y6. In the case of CP2:Y6, for states S1, S3 and S4 charge depletion took place on CP2 and Y6, however, charge accumulation took place only on Y6. The situation is the reverse for the S2 state. The behavior of CP3:Y6 is very different from that of the other systems. For the S1 state, charge depletion and charge accumulation took place on both CP3 and Y6. In the other states, there was very little charge accumulation on CP3. The change in the chalcogen atoms significantly altered the excited behavior of the polymers. The excitation energies of the four states are given in Table 2. The energies of the 1 and 4 states for all of the complexes are very close. In the case of the 2 state, CP2:Y6 exhibits a higher value than the other complexes. In the case of the 3 state, the energy of CP2:Y6 is much lower than for the other complexes.

3.7. Structural similarity analysis
To find a quantitative answer for the structural changes that occur upon chalcogen atom substitution, similarity analysis was performed using RDKit, a cheminformatics software.45 RDKit compares the fingerprint of a query structure (reference structure) with fingerprints of other compounds and calculates the Tanimoto index. For similarity analysis, pharmacophores, distances, fingerprints, etc., can be used. In the present study, we used an extended connectivity fingerprint, with up to four bonds (ECFP4), the results of which are presented in Fig. 9. A value closer to 1 indicates higher similarity. From Fig. 9, it is clear that CP2 and CP3 are similar to each other but very different from CP1.

3.8. Molecular dynamics simulations
The film morphology of active layer materials strongly controls the performance of organic solar cells.46 Molecular dynamics simulations are useful to study the behavior of molecules as a function of time. They can be used to study the bulk behavior of materials for organic solar cells. These calculations can be used to find the best donor:acceptor materials.47,48 A good donor:acceptor pair is necessary to achieve the driving force for high exciton dissociation.

3.8.1. Molecular packing behavior. 
There are several experimental techniques, such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS), which can be used to study film morphology.49 As experimental work is very expensive, how can the packing behavior of donor and acceptors be studied without experimentation? To select the best materials quickly molecular dynamics simulations can be useful. Such types of calculations can reduce the dependence on expensive fabrication and the characterization of solar cell devices. Semiempirical methods and DFT can be used to study the properties of individual molecules. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to study amorphous morphology. For this purpose, MD simulations data can be analyzed to obtain the radial distribution function (RDF). Simulation boxes for pure polymers are given in Fig. 10. Simulation boxes for polymer:Y6 blends are given in Fig. 11. The data show the aggregation or packing of the same type of molecules as well as the aggregation of different types of molecules, which indicates that there is the chance of the formation of mixed phases that are good for charge generation. It looks as though CP2:Y6 has more mixed phases than other blends. RDF plots for pure polymers and blends are given in Fig. 12. In the case of pure polymers, CP1 exhibits the closest packing, with the behavior of CP2 being very similar to that of CP1. In blends, the behavior is much different, with at most distances CP2:Y6 showing the highest intensity. This is an indication of strong interactions. These results are more or less consistent with the non-covalent interaction analysis. The behavior of CP1:Y6 is very different from that of CP1. At a short distance, the peak intensity of CP1 is higher and the peak intensity of CP1:Y6 is lower.

3.8.2. Polymer–solvent interactions analysis and solvent selection. 
The interactions between polymer and solvent molecules control the solubility of polymers.50,51 These interactions also control the film morphology of polymer solar cells. The polymer–solvent interactions are strongly dependent on the materials. In the present work, these interactions were studied using molecular dynamics simulations. For this purpose, the blend module of Materials Studio was used. The free energy of mixing (ΔEmix) and Flory–Huggins parameters (χ) were determined. The free energy of mixing was calculated using the following equation: (1)where Z is the coordination number; E is the binding energy; and the subscripts s and b represent screen and base molecules, respectively. The Flory–Huggins parameter was calculated using the following equation: (2)
The Flory–Huggins parameter can be used to explain the thermodynamics of organic solar cell blends. The pivotal advantage of the Flory–Huggins parameter lies in its simplicity and in its ability to quantitatively study polymer-containing mixtures. Here, it is important to mention that the values obtained using theoretical methods are not as accurate as the experimental values. However, experimental methods are very expensive and cannot be used for large-scale screening purposes. Therefore, fast computational methods are required to explore a large chemical space.
A low ΔEmix value indicates favorable mixing and therefore a stable system. There is no strict criterion for χ. Generally, low values are considered good. ΔEmix and χ values were determined for five solvents that are widely used in polymer solar cells. The calculated ΔEmix and χ values are given in Table 3. The values observe the following trend: CP1 > CP2 > CP3. If we compare the solvents, low values were obtained for trichlorobenzene. These calculations can help to select the best solvents and save time.

4. Conclusions
Detailed quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the effect of chalcogen atoms on the electronic behavior of polymers (CP1, CP2, and CP3). The change in chalcogen atoms significantly changes the polarity of molecules. Chalcogen atoms also exert a significant effect on nearby groups. Selenium has more polarization effect on molecules. Polymer:Y6 complexes were also studied to determine rules for donor:acceptor pair selection. Significance change was observed upon changing the chalcogen atoms. The sulfur and selenium-based polymers CP2 and CP3 exhibit a high density of states near to the Fermi level. The effect of chalcogen atoms on molecular packing and blend morphology was studied using molecular dynamics simulations. Sulfur-based polymer CP2 shows closer packing both in pure and blend form. Selenium-based polymer CP3 exhibits low values of free energy of mixing and Flory–Huggins parameters in various solvents. Trichlorobenzene was determined to be the best solvent for all the polymers. The proposed multi-dimensional modelling provides useful information about molecular and bulk properties that can aid in the judicious design of donors for polymer solar cells.
