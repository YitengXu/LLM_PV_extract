    , Accepted 14th May 2018First published on 15th May 2018AbstractPerovskite solar cells (PSCs) have received tremendous attention due to their stunning progress in photovoltaic performance. The hysteresis behavior, however, is one of the major concerning issues accompanying the development of PSCs. In this context, we propose a new mechanism that explains the origin of hysteresis behavior by analyzing the electrical processes after changing the external electrical bias: the compensating electric field to the scanning voltage induced by drifting carriers. This is further verified by experiments, where we observed much reduced hysteresis in the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics for the PSCs based on a thinner perovskite layer, which is a result of more evenly distributed electrons and holes. Moreover, light illumination with different wavelengths was applied to vary the initial carrier distribution inside the perovskite layer. We found that J–V curves when illuminating the device with longer wavelengths exhibited diminished hysteresis, which could be a result of more evenly generated carriers due to a smaller absorptivity than that with short wavelength illumination. Based on the proposed model, three key factors affecting the hysteresis behavior were pointed out, including the initial carrier distribution, the carrier transport properties in the perovskite layer, and the carrier extraction properties at the interfaces. Strategies to construct hysteresis-free and stable PSCs have thus been accordingly proposed.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have opened up a brand new and fascinating vista of the next-generation, low-cost photovoltaic (PV) technology by demonstrating extraordinary photovoltaic performances.1–5 The certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) has been swiftly improved from 3.7% in 2009 to the present 22.7%,6,7 overpassing most of the other thin-film PV technologies that have gone through much longer development histories. For instance, the record efficiencies only reach 22.6% for copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), 22.1% for CdTe, 13.4% for quantum dot solar cells (QDSCs), and 11.9% for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), respectively.7,8 Nevertheless, a few issues impede the commercialization of perovskite technology, among which the hysteresis behavior is one of the most pronounced.9–12 The hysteresis phenomenon can not only be revealed by the substantial mismatch between the current density–voltage (J–V) curves measured in forward (from short circuit to open circuit) and reverse scans (from open circuit to short circuit), but also by the slow transient response with a timescale of tens of seconds or even longer after altering operation conditions via bias, illumination conditions and so on.9 The hysteresis behavior that is unique and extensively reported for PSCs with different configurations not only makes it hard to evaluate the photovoltaic performance accurately, but also has detrimental effects on the long-term stability.12–14 This issue has attracted tremendous attention from both research and industry fields,15–17 though consensus has not been reached yet in regard to its origin.
A variety of mechanisms have been suggested to elucidate the causes of hysteresis behaviors by both experiments and numerical simulations,18 such as ion migration,19–22 ferroelectric properties of the perovskite,23,24 the carrier dynamics at the trap states near the interfaces or inside the perovskite layer, or a combination of these.25,26 To date, the hysteresis phenomenon has been widely recognized to be a comprehensive outcome associated with the perovskite material, device structure, the interfaces between charge extraction layers (CELs) and the measurement protocols of the J–V scan. Ion migration has been mostly discussed and successfully employed to explain many hysteresis behaviors, by the means of screening the external electric field due to the accumulation of mobile ions at certain positions.27 First-principles calculations also indicate that the methylammonium cation (CH3NH3+) and the iodide anion (I−) in the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal are very likely to migrate due to the low activation energy of 0.32 eV and 0.55 eV, respectively.28–31 On the other hand, the ferroelectric properties of the perovskite layer have also been considered as one of the causes that affects the hysteresis behavior, as the polarization and rotation of the ferroelectric domains in the perovskite film can modify the band structure of the perovskite.32 Both of these potential causes seem to be linked to the bulky properties of the perovskite film. This, therefore, seems to conflict with the fact that PSCs with the same perovskite films but with different device configurations show significantly varied hysteresis behaviors.33–35 Generally, the planar n–i–p structure of PSCs based on TiO2 electron transport material (ETM) shows relatively more serious hysteresis behaviors than their counterparts in an inverted p–i–n structure, and the latter usually results in hysteresis-negligible derivatives. Moreover, cells consisting of non-ferroelectric PbI2 also show hysteresis behavior in J–V characteristics. The capturing (trapping) or releasing (detrapping) of carriers by the defects at interfaces or grain boundaries has also been regarded as one of the main contributors to the hysteresis.36,37 However, Snaith and colleagues found that the timescale for the carrier trapping and detrappinng processes, usually in the order of 10−5 s, is inconsistent with the timescale of tens of seconds that is measured by experiments. It seems that none of the above theories can explain the hysteresis with full satisfaction, which strongly indicates that much more efforts are required to be devoted to this field by further investigating the established theories or overviewing the electrical process from different perspectives.
Herein, using an established analytical approach developed in traditional semiconductor physics as a reference, we propose a new possible mechanism for hysteresis that explains the origin of hysteresis in J–V curves.38,39 The space-charge electric field induced by the drifting carrier in a perovskite film could be one of the main causes for hysteresis in PSCs. Based on this theory, the electrical process of generating a discrepancy between the forward and backward J–V scans was qualitatively analyzed step by step. We also performed two sets of experiments to verify our theory, by either varying the perovskite-layer thickness or the illumination wavelength. The hysteresis behaviors under both scenarios measured from the J–V curves are consistent with what we anticipate from our proposed model. Aiming at constructing hysteresis-free devices, we then point out three key factors that are related to the hysteresis, including the initial carrier distribution, the carrier extraction properties at the interface near the illuminated side and the carrier mobility of the perovskite layer. We think it is important to decrease the polarity generated by the differential distribution of electrons and holes through enhancing the carrier extraction at the interface and increasing the optical path in the perovskite. Moreover, accelerating the compensating process of the space-charge electric field by increasing the carrier mobility of the perovskite layer is also beneficial to reducing hysteresis, which could be achieved by optimizing the crystallization process of the perovskite and compositional engineering.40,41
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I, MAI) was purchased from Dyesol Ltd (Australia). 2,2′,7,7′-Tetrakis-(N,N-di-4-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (Spiro-OMeTAD) was purchased from Borun Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Ningbo, China). [6,6]-Phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) was purchased from Luminescence Technology Co. All the other materials, unless specified, were purchased from either Alfa Aesar or Sigma-Aldrich, and used as received without further purification.
2.2 Fabrication of solar cells
Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO, sheet resistance ∼10 Ω □−1) substrates were ultrasonically cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol for 15 min each sequentially. Then, they were further cleaned with ultraviolet ozone treatment (UV-O3) for 15 min before device fabrication.
For PSCs with the n–i–p configuration: the compact TiOx and FeOx electron extraction layer (EEL) was fabricated by spin-coating an acidic ethanol solution (0.12 M) of titanium isopropoxide and iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), respectively, at 4000 rpm for 40 seconds. The substrates were subsequently heated at 100 °C for 30 min and further annealed at 500 °C for 1 hour. We then spin-coated an 8 mg mL−1 solution of PCBM in chlorobenzene at 4000 rpm for 30 s for passivating the TiOx surface. This modified TiO2 is denoted as TiOx(m). A perovskite layer with a composition of CH3NH3PbI3 was deposited by spin-coating the precursor solution composed of CH3NH3I and lead iodide (PbI2) (molar ratio of 1:1; 1.35 M) in a mixed solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) (with a volume ratio of 7:3) onto the EEL at 5000 rpm for 60 s. Meanwhile, chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the center of the substrate for 10 s after the spin-coating commences. The as-deposited film was then heated at 100 °C for crystallization for 15 min. Spiro-OMeTAD solution, consisting of 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 17.5 μL of bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide lithium salt (LiTFSI) in acetonitrile (520 mg mL−1), and 28.8 μL of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in 1 mL of anhydrous chlorobenzene, was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer at 4000 rpm for 40 s to form the HEL. Finally, a Au electrode with a thickness of around 90 nm was deposited on top of the HEL by thermal evaporation for the n–i–p structured PSCs.
For PSCs with the p–i–n configuration: A NiOx compact hole extraction layer (HEL) was fabricated by spin-coating a solution of nickel(II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) in anhydrous ethanol (0.1 M) at 4000 rpm for 30 s twice. Before the second spin-coating, the film was dried at 80 °C for 15 min. Afterwards, the film was sintered at 350 °C for 30 min. The preparation method of the perovskite layer is the same as that mentioned for the n–i–p structured PSC fabrication. Then, PCBM in anhydrous chlorobenzene (20 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the CH3NH3PbI3 layer at 2000 rpm for 40 s to prepare the EEL for the p–i–n structured PSCs. As the final step, silver with a thickness of about 120 nm was thermally evaporated onto the EELs to fabricate a top electrode for the p–i–n PSCs.
2.3 Characterization
The film morphology and thickness information were obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, EHT = 5.0 kV, WD = 6.5 mm, Zeiss LEO1530, Germany). Ultraviolet-visible absorption and transmission spectra were recorded using a Lambda 950 spectrophotometer at room temperature with an integrating sphere detector (250–800 nm, PerkinElmer, USA). Steady-state and transient PL decay spectra were obtained using an FLS920 transient optical spectrometer. Steady-state PL measurements were measured by exciting the sample using a monochromatic xenon lamp source with a central wavelength of 460 nm. Time-resolved PL measurements were performed using a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) system. Samples were photoexcited using a 405 nm laser beam (EPL405), pulsed at frequencies between 10 and 20 MHz, with a pulse duration of <100 ps and the maximum fluorescence intensity. The J–V characteristics of the linear voltage scan and stepwise voltage scan were measured using a digital source meter (2400, Keithley Instruments, USA) under AM 1.5G illumination, with the device illuminated by a solar simulator (91192, Oriel, USA). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard crystalline silicon solar cell (PT-SI-RSC, Pharos Technology). The active area (0.06 cm2) of the devices for photovoltaic J–V measurement was determined by a metal aperture.
3. Results and discussion
In this study, we included PSCs with both the n–i–p and p–i–n structures to study the hysteresis behavior, and we made comprehensive comparisons between them. In the n–i–p structured PSCs, by keeping the perovskite and hole transport material (HTM) the same, we varied the electron transport material using the normal solution-processed TiO2, or that passivated by PCBM (noted as TiOx(m)) or FeOx. The p–i–n PSCs with the structure of FTO/NiOx/perovskite/PCBM/Ag were fabricated as a reference for hysteresis analysis. The perovskite compositions (MAPbI3) and the fabrication process are identical in all the devices. The morphology of the as-prepared perovskite films remains the same in different device configurations, as can be seen from the SEM images in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Therefore, the bulky properties of the perovskite films are expected to be similar for all these conditions.
The hysteresis behaviors are usually demonstrated by comparing the typical J–V curves of the forward and reverse scans. We therefore show the J–V curves of these different devices in Fig. 1a, with the photovoltaic parameters listed in Table 1. The hysteresis index αH = PCERe/PCEFw is used to assess the hysteresis phenomena. We note that all the devices fabricated in this work show respectable photovoltaic performance, confirming all the layers in the devices are of high quality. Consistent with the literature, the p–i–n stacked PSC based on NiOx fabricated in this work shows negligible hysteresis (αH = 1.02),42,43 while its counterparts in the n–i–p configuration exhibited much more prominent hysteresis behavior no matter which EEL was used. Specifically, the planar PSCs based on bare TiOx result in a significant hysteresis behavior with an αH of 1.58, which is consistent with other reported works.9,33 Substituting TiOx with FeOx effectively reduces the hysteresis index to 1.34. Coating the TiOx with PCBM dramatically diminished the hysteresis index to 1.07, corresponding to negligible hysteresis.

For the n–i–p structured PSCs, due to the same bulky properties of the perovskite, the hysteresis in the J–V characteristics should be linked to the electron extraction properties of the EEL at the interfaces. This in turn affects the carrier distribution inside the perovskite layer. The steady-state PL spectra (Fig. 1b) and transient PL decays (Fig. S2, ESI†) of the perovskite layer based on different EELs prove this. It is shown that both TiOx(m) and FeOx cause an obviously reduced PL intensity compared with that based on bare TiOx, also known as the quenching effect, suggesting more efficient and faster electron extraction for the former two EELs. This is also attested by the transient PL decays, which involve a fast decay process mainly attributed to the charge carrier extraction across the interface between perovskite and EELs, and a slow decay process corresponding to the radiative decay in the bulky perovskite. Perovskite layers based on TiOx(m) and FeOx show much faster decays compared with that based on bare TiOx, revealing improved electron extraction efficiency.
We then more deeply investigated the hysteresis by a stepwise voltage scan (solid line) and a linear voltage scan (dashed line), and further proposed a possible origin of the hysteresis phenomena. The stepwise voltage scan was carried out by scanning the external voltage, as shown in Fig. 2a, with a step size of 50 mV and a step time of 0.2 s. Each scan step contains 10 time points to depict the current evolution. For the forward stepwise scan, during each transient step, the detected current shows a sharp decrease at first, followed by a continuous recovery. In contrast, for the reverse stepwise scan, the detected current increases sharply, followed by a slow decrease process. The scanning direction-dependent varying trends, consequently, result in the discrepancy in the J–V characteristics as shown above.

Based on these results, we propose a new theory that could explain the origin of the hysteresis behavior of the PSCs, namely the electric field induced by drifting carriers. We marked three typical time points in the forward stepwise scan in Fig. 2a, and took them as examples to explain the slow recovery after the sharp change in the stepwise scan (Fig. 2b–d). The light is illuminated from the FTO side in this work. The illuminating light is absorbed by the perovskite layer following Lambert–Beer's law: Ix = I0e−αx(1)where I0 is the initial light intensity; Ix is the light intensity at a distance of x from the EEL; α is the absorption coefficient of the perovskite layer. The excitons are generated after the light absorption, and thereby also follow a logarithmic distribution. Then, the carrier separation and carrier drift are actuated by the built-in electric field (Ein) to form the current flow. The electrons and holes, however, comply with different dynamic distribution equilibria, which are related to carrier generation and drifting, as depicted in Fig. 2b. The resultant non-overlapping of the distribution of electrons and holes thereby would produce a space-charge induced electric field (Esp). When the matching degree of the electron and hole distribution increases (distribution lines move to coincide), fewer carriers would join to form the dipole, resulting in a decreased Esp. Conversely, if the matching degree of the electron and hole distribution decreases, the amount of carriers participating in forming the Esp would increase, which would increase the Esp.
According to the formula: i = nev = Eneμ(2)where i is the current density; E is the internal electric field in the perovskite layer, n is the carrier concentration; e is the charge of an electron; v is the average carrier-drift velocity; and μ is the carrier mobility. As n, e and μ can be considered as constants during the J–V scan, the current yield mainly depends on the internal electric field (Etotal) inside the perovskite layer. Besides the Esp, the built-in electric field (Ein) and the applied electric field induced by the voltage scan (Esc) are also important contributors. Therefore, there is: Etotal = Ein − Esc − Esp(3)
Based on the drifting carrier theory, the electric process shown in Fig. 2b–d can be explained accordingly. During the forward stepwise scan, at the time point t = t1 and scan voltage VSC = V0, the electric field and carrier distribution tend to reach equilibrium (Fig. 2b).
However, at time point t = t2, when the scan voltage jumped up to V1, Esc is correspondingly increased sharply, which straightforwardly leads to a decrease in the driving force of carrier transport and extraction. Thus, the current shows a sharp drop, as depicted in Fig. 2c, in the beginning stage, breaking the previous carrier equilibrium. As the scan voltage is held at V1 from the time point t2 to t3, the new dynamic equilibria would be reached by pushing the carriers to move in the direction of overlapping. Consequently, carriers participating in forming the space-charge induced electric field result in the reduction in Esp and bring about the current recovery. Moreover, as the dynamic distribution of electrons becomes more even, electron extraction would be less efficient, resulting in a moderate variation trend, as depicted in Fig. 2a. Overall, the movement of the dynamic equilibrium of carriers has been considered as a key factor of the theory proposed in the present study.
Based on this theory, we propose to explain the hysteresis mechanism. The light absorption induced exciton distribution would largely affect the hysteresis phenomena, since the holes and electrons transport in opposite directions. A sharper initial absorption induced exciton distribution would lead to a more polar distribution of electrons and holes, aggravating the influence of a compensating electric field. This is a unique deduction in the present context. To further verify this assumption, two sets of experiments by varying both the perovskite-layer thickness and the illumination wavelength to change the initial absorption induced exciton distribution were carried out. As shown in Table 1, the n–i–p structured PSCs based on the FeOx EEL (FTO/FeOx/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au) exhibited a moderate hysteresis index, providing reasonable room for reducing or exacerbating their value by varying experimental conditions. Thus, experimental verifications were carried out based on devices with this structure.
Firstly, J–V characteristic tests were carried out for PSCs with different perovskite-film thicknesses, as shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. S3 (ESI†). All the other layers are identical, including a ∼40 nm thick FeOx and ∼180 nm Spiro-OMeTAD layer. Three different perovskite film thicknesses have been used in this work, including ∼210 nm, ∼330 nm and ∼420 nm. Fig. 3b depicts the initial absorption induced carrier distribution of the three devices, where the thickness is normalized for comparison. With thinner perovskite film, the concentration of carriers generated by light illumination would decrease less in the whole perovskite film region, leading to smaller polarity in the carrier distribution.

(b) The initial carrier distribution along the perovskite film (with the film depth normalized). (c) Typical J–V curves and (d) distributions of the hysteresis indexes of PSCs with different perovskite-layer thicknesses. 

Fig. 3c shows the typical J–V curves of PSCs based on these perovskite layers with both forward and reverse scanning, and the corresponding performance parameters are listed in Table 2. The effects of the perovskite-film thickness on the hysteresis behavior are further confirmed by the distribution of the hysteresis indexes based on two batches of 8 devices shown in Fig. 3d. The hysteresis indexes for PSCs based on the perovskite layer of ∼210 nm are averaged at 1.3. When the thickness of the perovskite layer increased, the average value of αH is enhanced to about 1.5 for the device based on 330 nm-perovskite and 1.8 for that based on 420 nm-perovskite. This result is consistent with our theory, as increasing the perovskite layer thickness reduces the Esc and Ein, thus weakening the influence of Esp.

Further verification was provided by applying light illumination with different wavelengths to vary the exciton distribution, while keeping the perovskite layer thickness the same. Fig. 4a shows the variation of the absorption coefficient of CH3NH3PbI3 derived from the absorbance spectrum according to the formula: α = A/dPEV(4)where α is the absorption coefficient, A is the absorbance value, and dPEV is the thickness of the perovskite layer. According to formula (1), a larger absorption coefficient leads to a sharper decrease of the carrier density along the direction of the film thickness. Fig. 4b shows the normalized carrier distribution with the wavelength ranging from 350 nm to 750 nm. The PSCs with the same structure of FTO/FeOx/CH3NH3PbI3/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au and a perovskite thickness of 330 nm were used for this study. For a wavelength over 550 nm, there would be light reflection from the gold electrode, which would lead to low-finesse cavity interference (as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†).44 We therefore used three wavelengths of 350 nm, 450 nm and 550 nm to illuminate the PSCs, by using the light filters with a wavelength bandwidth of 80 nm centered at each wavelength. The transmittance spectra of the light filters are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). We tuned the light intensity to be approximately 50 mW cm−2 for each range by using an adjustable LED source. The typical J–V curves of PSCs illuminated by different wavelengths are shown in Fig. 4c, with the performance metrics listed in Table 3. The effect of light wavelength on hysteresis behavior is further confirmed by the distribution of the hysteresis indexes based on the two batches of 8 devices shown in Fig. 4d. The PSCs illuminated by the light with a wavelength centered at 350 nm show a hysteresis index as high as 2.5 (averaged value), and it is effectively diminished to 1.9 (averaged value) and 1.7 (averaged value) for that based on a wavelength centered at 450 nm and 550 nm, respectively. These varying trends also show good consistency with the expectation from the proposed theory. When the carriers are more evenly generated inside the perovskite layer by longer wavelength light illumination, the polarity of the carrier distribution would be smaller, which results in a weaker electric field along the opposite direction of carrier transfer. As a result, the influence of the space charge electric field would be reduced, leading to a diminished hysteresis.

The dynamic equilibrium is mainly dominated by three key factors: (a) light absorption induced exciton distribution, (b) the carrier extraction properties at the interfaces, especially the interface at the light illuminating side and (c) the carrier transport properties of the perovskite layer. The former two have been proven by experiments, while for the last factor, better carrier transport properties (e.g. less grain boundary or larger carrier mobility) would lead to quicker carrier responses for both forward and reverse scans, and thus, reduced hysteresis. For factor (b), quicker carrier extraction would lead to a more even distribution of electrons and holes. Therefore, the influence of space charge induced electric field would be weakened, causing the diminished hysteresis. Based on our theory, several strategies could be deduced for elimination of the hysteresis: utilizing a mesoporous structure can increase light scattering and enhance the carrier extraction;26,45 incorporating metal plasma into the perovskite layer would increase light scattering and speed up the carrier transport; interface modification at the illuminating side would enhance the perovskite crystallinity and carrier extraction properties.33
4. Conclusion
In summary, we propose a possible mechanism to explain the origin of the hysteresis phenomena that is different from all the established theories. The dynamic distribution of a drifting carrier is considered to be one of the key factors dominating the hysteresis behavior, besides the widely discussed migrating ions and trapped carriers. In our theory, the space-charge induced electric field participates in the charge extraction process, thus affecting the J–V test, which is strongly associated with the initial absorption induced exciton distribution, the carrier extraction properties of the interface at the illuminating side and the carrier mobility. The former two largely affect the intensity of the space charge induced electric field, and the carrier mobility would affect the lag time of the space-charge electric field change. Our theory is further reinforced by experimental results. We modulated the initial absorption-induced exciton distribution by either varying the perovskite-layer thickness or the illumination wavelength, and achieved J–V measurements with the same trend of hysteresis behavior to what we expect from our theory. Though we think our theory can explain some of the hysteresis behaviors of PSCs well, we agree that this phenomenon is supposed to be multifactorial. We also note that to further uncover the origins of hysteresis, more efforts are required to be devoted to various aspects including qualitative analysis based on our theory. The theory proposed in this work supplies deep insights for the causes that result in the hysteresis behavior and points out the critical aspects that need to be paid attention to in order to design and construct hysteresis-free perovskite solar cells in the future.
