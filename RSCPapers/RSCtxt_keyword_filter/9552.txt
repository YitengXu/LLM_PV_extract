    , Accepted 28th November 2014First published on 28th November 2014AbstractHydrogen is an attractive alternative to fossil fuels in terms of environmental and other advantages. Of the various production methods for H2, photocatalysis requires further development so that it can be applied economically on an industrial scale. One- and two-dimensional nanostructures in both pristine and modified forms have shown great potential as catalysts in the generation of H2. We review here recent developments in these nanostructure catalysts and their efficiency in the generation of H2 under UV/visible/simulated solar light. Despite much research effort, many photocatalysts do not yet meet the practical requirements for the generation of H2, such as visible light activity. H2 production is dependent on a variety of parameters and factors. To meet future energy demands, several challenges in H2 production still need to be solved. We address here the factors that influence the efficiency of H2 production and suggest alternatives. The nanostructures are classified based on their morphology and their efficiency is considered with respect to the influencing parameters. We suggest effective ways of engineering catalyst combinations to overcome the current performance barriers.
1. Introduction
Hydrogen (H2) is considered to be an ideal fuel for future energy demands when it is sourced from clean and renewable energy resources.1 H2 has attracted much interest as a result of its potentially unlimited generation from the Earth's abundant water resources. On combustion, H2 generates water rather than CO2, in contrast to conventional fossil fuels. Its gravimetric energy content (heat of combustion) is about five times higher than that of methanol and ethanol and about 2.5 times that of hydrocarbons.2 The greatest disadvantage of this fuel is its lack of natural availability. However, H2 can be produced from both renewable and conventional energy sources (solar, wind, hydro and geothermal power, fossil fuels, nuclear energy and biomass sources3) (Fig. 1). Renewable energy currently contributes almost 5% of the overall hydrogen production through the electrolysis of water, whereas the rest is mainly derived from fossil fuels.4 Producing H2 from fossil fuels is not economically feasible because it requires a high temperature input for synthesis and emits CO2; in addition, fossil fuels are non-renewable.3 Thus the generation of H2 from fossil fuels is not an environmentally friendly option.5

Among the renewable power sources, the photocatalytic splitting of water offers a promising method for the clean, low cost and environmentally friendly production of H2 by solar energy. Nanostructured catalysts have additional advantages in photocatalysis6–11 and the photocatalytic production of H2 from water via solar energy is currently the best available method and is an attractive and competitive technology. As technology advances, the implementation and associated costs of this technique will be significantly reduced. In 1972, Fujishima and Honda12 demonstrated a photoelectrochemical (PEC) method to split water into H2 and O2 in which a bias was applied across a TiO2 thin film and a Pt counter electrode. In 1979, Bard13–15 showed that water can be split into H2 and O2 by simply using a powdered TiO2 catalyst and exposing it to sunlight in the presence of a sacrificial reagent (SR) without applying any bias.
It is now understood that catalysis takes place on the surface of a semiconductor. When a photon of energy matches or exceeds the band gap energy (Eg) of a semiconductor, an electron is promoted to the conduction band (CB), leaving a hole in the valence band (VB). Essentially, the excited state CB electron and the VB hole can recombine or become trapped in a metastable surface state. They can also participate in reactions with electron donors and acceptors adsorbed on the surface of the semiconductor. Under suitable conditions, the CB electron can reduce H+ ions to yield H2 gas and the VB hole can generate O2. Back-reactions to form H2O instead of H2 gas are possible.
Efficient e–h pair separation is crucial in catalysis. Selecting a semiconductor requires prior knowledge about the CB and VB levels with respect to the redox potential of H2O, i.e. the CB should be lower than the H+/H2 potential and the VB should be higher than the OH−/O2 potential. The next immediate consideration is the Eg of the semiconductor, which determines the range of wavelengths for which it can absorb energy to create e–h pairs. Low Eg materials such as ferrous oxide (1.9–2.1 eV),19 tungsten nitride (2.2 eV)20 and other III–V and II–VI compound semiconductors21–23 may be active materials within the limits of the energetic locations of the CB and VB with respect to the H2O redox potential. For some semiconductors, although their Eg values cover the visible part of the solar spectrum, their CB and/or VB levels are not compatible with respect to the redox potential of H2O. These materials, e.g. MoS2, Fe2O3 and WO3, may be photocorrosive if their CB minimum is lower than the thermodynamic requirement.24 Such photocorrosive catalysts have been explored after certain modifications, such as the incorporation of co-catalysts (NiOx, RuO225,26 or Rh–Cr), doping with metal ions or combination with other semiconductors.5,27–29 The same principle of thermodynamic requirement applies to the PEC method.29,30
Considerable use of small Eg semiconducting materials may cause serious environmental impacts as a result of their instability; wide Eg materials are preferable in H2 production. However, although suitable band positions and stability in the electrolyte favour large Eg materials (e.g. TiO2 or ZnO),30–32 their absorbance is limited to the UV region of the solar spectrum. A significant solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (η) of 16.25% has been obtained from TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) (45 μm) under 100 mW cm−2 irradiation with UV light (320–400 nm).33 Only a small fraction (about 5%) of the available energy in the solar spectrum is used in this example. Wide Eg materials can be subjected to modifications, such as doping34 and interfacing with other materials35,36 in the form of heterojunctions, to enable absorption in the visible region or to efficiently isolate the e–h pairs. This offers a clean, cost-effective and environmentally benign production method for H2. Izumi et al.34 studied the visible light response over TiO2 NTs by anionic (S, N) doping. Zhan et al.35 demonstrated that this heterostructure can cover about 22% of the entire solar spectrum. Sathre et al.37 analysed the PEC method of hydrogen production based on fundamental principles. Hisatomi et al.38 addressed the fundamental aspects of the PEC method of water splitting. The Z-scheme and tandem systems based on multi-step photoexcitation liberate semiconducting materials from thermodynamic limitations and enable the application of a variety of materials to unassisted water splitting.38
Semiconducting nanostructures, especially one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) structures have superior photocatalytic activity as a result of improved e–h separation and a low recombination rate. Ford et al.16 reported that, by decreasing the diameters of InAs nanowires (NWs), the mobility of the electrons could be controlled. Martinson et al.17 compared the transport and recombination dynamics of sintered nanocrystalline particles versus nanorod (NR) arrays. Core–shell type nanostructures18 have been demonstrated to have enhanced PEC water splitting properties under solar light. Various architectures of 2D nanosheets (NSs) with thicknesses <100 nm hold great promise for the efficient PEC splitting of water. 2D NSs also offer optimized charge migration, surface modification and light absorption. Zhou et al.39 addressed the performance of advanced PEC devices using 2D NSs as photoelectrodes. Chemically modified nanostructures offer a green and low cost method of generating H2 fuel via PEC water splitting.40 Liu et al.41 demonstrated that Pt-loaded titania hierarchical photonic crystals could double the evolution of H2 in photocatalytic water splitting. The enhancement in H2 evolution was a result of the hierarchical structure, which can cause multiple scattering among the photonic crystals and improve the absorbance of light. This provides a strong light-harvesting method.
The focus of research has recently intensified towards nanostructures and their potential applications. The high specific surface area (SA) of nanostructures provides a high density of active sites compared with their bulk counterparts.42,43 The effect of quantum confinement results in important optical and electronic properties. The properties of various types of 1D and 2D semiconducting nanostructures, such as NRs, NWs, NTs and nanofibres (NFs)44,45 are considered in the next section, against the background of H2 generation.
1.1. Why nanostructures for H2 generation?
The growing interest in nanostructured metal oxides46–55 is due to their large SA, short lateral diffusion length and low reflectivity. However, most metal oxides have large band gap energies, leading to limited light absorption in the visible region. This imposes a fundamental limitation on the overall conversion efficiency of solar energy to hydrogen. Delaying the recombination of photogenerated e–h pairs creates the environment required for the exciton pair to diffuse to the surface and participate in catalysis. 1D nanostructures can trap photons more effectively under appropriate geometric configurations where the carrier diffusion lengths are comparable with their physical dimensions.46 As a result, the photocatalytic performance significantly increases47–55 at smaller dimensions. The preparation of nanostructured photocatalysts is therefore indispensable in meeting future energy demands. The nano-dimensions facilitate the efficient collection of free carriers and increase η.56–58
This concept of charge carrier generation and subsequent migration is similar to that in solar cells, where the intrinsic electrical field assists the separation. This concept of using an intrinsic electrical field is applied in H2 generation.59 n–n type heterojunctions yield similar results.35 In the case of photocatalytic H2 generation, the migration should take place by itself, although some assistance may be obtained from the depletion layer (if it exists) on the surface. Arrays of NRs have attracted considerable interest as a result of their enhanced absorption of incident light and their crystallinity. For example, ZnO NR arrays,60 single crystalline GaN NRs61 and GaP NRs62 can be used as effective anti-reflection coatings as a result of their regular textures and morphology. Strontium metaniobate (SrNb2O6) NT morphologies are effective photocatalysts compared with their micron-sized powders. However, single crystalline ZnO shows enhanced electron collection efficiency compared with polycrystalline ZnO nanostructures,17 due to shorter collection times. Light reflection increases the ratio of non-diffusive absorption and diffusive scattering, which results in a reduction in photon harvesting.63 The periodic nature of nanostructures and their intrinsic property of low reflectivity can also be seen with NWs. NW arrays have a higher theoretical absorbance at lower wavelength regions than their thin-film counterparts.64 Single-crystal Si NWs have delayed recombination and high optical absorption.43,65,66
NW structures can absorb incident photons while the low-energy photons are scattered inside the structure. Further increase in absorbance can be obtained by tailoring the fill factor of NWs.64 This phenomena of multiple reflections inside the nanostructure is similar to that seen in NT.67 These 1D structures (NWs and NTs) act as electron pathways in the axial directions. However, the scattered or transmitted light has a higher wavelength, which requires the use of sensitizers such as dyes (e.g. Eosin Y68 in combination with carbon NTs) to increase η. Arrays of NWs69 and dual-diameter germanium nanopillars70 have effective photon absorption at low (300–600 nm) and high (600–900 nm) wavelengths, respectively. Single crystalline TiO2 NWs showed faster electron mobility (about 1 cm2 V−1 s−1) than polycrystalline NWs;71 likewise single crystalline ZnO NWs (1–5 cm2 V−1 s−1).72 Although the mobility of the charge carriers in 1D polycrystalline TiO2 is comparable with that of zero-dimensional (0D) TiO2,67,73 the recombination time of 1D polycrystalline TiO2 is much longer than that of 0D TiO2. This may be a result of the unevenly distributed recombination centres on the surface. Furthermore, the radial electrical field that may be present in 1D NWs delays the recombination process, which accounts for the enhanced electron collection efficiency in 1D TiO2.73–75 1D materials with relatively small Eg values have been reported to have η = 0.6% (branched CuO NWs) and η = 0.71% (CuO–ZnO core–shell NR arrays).27 Hexagonal Zn2GeO4 NRs show the highest rate of H2 evolution of 0.6 mmol h−1.76 A comparative study showed that Zn2GeO4 NRs could produce a stable rate of H2 evolution of 6.24 mmol g−1 h−1 under irradiation with UV light.77
Haematite (α-Fe2O3) was considered for PEC solar water splitting78 with 3D nanophotonic structures, which resulted in a current density as high as 3.05 mA cm−2 at 1.23 V with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). Hwang et al.79 reported that layered perovskites loaded with Ni are important photocatalysts for water splitting, with a photon yield of 23%. A quantum yield as high as 30% was obtained when K2La2Ti3O10 was prepared by a polymerized complex method.80 Zhang et al.81 reported an improved photochemical evolution of H2 from a TiO2 leaf structure. Nanostructures are therefore potential recyclable candidates for water splitting.82 Analysis from the ISI Web of Science has shown extensive growth in research on H2 production (Fig. 2). It is clear from Fig. 2 and 3 that PEC water splitting is a potentially important method of producing H2 with environmentally friendly features. Fig. 3 suggests that nanostructured materials are promising PEC catalysts.

This review focuses on the fundamental properties of nanostructured materials and their efficiency in the context of processing parameters. The basic mechanism of H2 evolution is addressed, including the vital points that influence the catalytic activity. A wide range of photocatalysts has been developed for use under UV illumination and have been modified to extend their capability to use visible light. H2 evolution from various nanostructures are classified into two major sections: UV and visible illumination, along with various types of nanostructures such as NRs and NSs. The efficiencies and amount of H2 evolution from various materials in different morphologies are tabulated separately for both the UV and visible regions. Important results and the relevant configurations (e.g. heterojunctions) are discussed in detail. In the concluding remarks, we consider the crucial points that require further attention in the design of the next generation of catalysts.
2. Basic mechanisms of hydrogen generation
The basic PEC setup12 for water splitting is shown in Fig. 4a. When electrolysis takes place, the water molecules undergo redox reactions to generate H2 and O2 at the Pt and TiO2 electrodes, respectively. This PEC setup was later simplified by Bard,13–15 who used semiconducting particles and/or powders in the presence of aromatic compounds (Fig. 4b) as heterogeneous catalysts. The involvement of a semiconductor (catalyst), from which e–h pairs are photogenerated to then take part in catalysis, is essential. The crucial factor in enhancing the productivity is to delay the recombination of the excited e–h pairs and their subsequent migration (diffusion) to the surface. The output from the catalyst depends on how efficiently the e–h pairs are created and how well they diffuse to the surface. These factors depend on the semiconductor used,16,17,60–62 the morphology,16,60 the crystal structure,17,25,61,62 intrinsic/surface defects, the intrinsic carrier lifetime and the collection time.17 These factors can be tuned in nano-scale catalysts.

The mechanism of water splitting is as follows. The water molecules are reduced to form H2 and oxidized to form O2. The reduction and oxidation are mediated by electrons and holes, respectively. The redox potential of water is 1.23 V, i.e. H+/H2 is 0 V and O2/H2O is 1.23 V with respect to the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE) (Fig. 4c). Under suitable illumination, electrons and holes are created in the CB and VB, respectively. Several factors are involved in photocatalytic water splitting that finally determine the value of η. These are: (1) the absorption of photons to form excited e–h pairs; (2) the recombination, separation, migration, trapping and migration of excited charge carriers; and (3) surface chemical reactions (the construction of surface reaction active sites for the evolution of H2 and O2). When the conditions are favourable, these photoexcited electrons and holes migrate to the surface of the photocatalyst (Fig. 4). Fig. 4c describes the role of SRs in the catalysis process. As the quantity of SR decreases, the H2 production rate also decreases; however, the production rate can be regained if the reagent is replenished.83 It has been reported that SRs can effectively reduce H2O to H2 or oxide it to O2. Co-catalysts and/or the addition of SRs to TiO2 resulted in an improved performance.24 A sufficiently negative flat band potential, a good absorption cross-section over a wide spectral range, photostability and an appropriate band gap are also essential. In this context, metal oxides such as TiO2, SrTiO3 and NaTiO3 have been studied in detail as a result of their suitable band structures, low environmental impact and low toxicity, and high stability. However, these wide band gap oxides have only low conversion efficiencies as they are only active under UV light, which accounts for just 4% of the solar spectrum. Buhler et al.84 reported that CdS has promising absorption up to 520 nm and has a flat band potential of −0.66 V (pH 7). However, the Eg of CdS is still relatively large (2.5 eV) and is not stable in aqueous solution under irradiation (anodic dissolution), although it can be stabilized in aqueous solutions by using reducing agents or SRs that provide electron donors to consume the photogenerated holes. SRs promote H2 evolution by contributing to half of the reaction.84 Where the SRs used two outputs can be expected: one is H2, although and the second is desulfurization processes of S2− and SO32−. In the case of dye sensitization,85 excitation and subsequent charge transfers occur on a sub-nanosecond or picosecond time-scale. As electrons populate the CB, their energy should be more negative than H+/H2 with reference to the NHE. Holes participate in catalysis from the VB and their energy should be more positive than O2/H2O (1.23 V) with reference to the NHE. Therefore the Eg of the photocatalyst should be >1.23 eV. The energetic levels of the VB and CB play a vital part in water splitting, where their edges correspond to the ionization potential and electron affinity, respectively. Fig. 5 shows the CB and VB edges for various semiconductors with reference to the NHE and a vacuum; these values are also given in Table 1 for easy reference.

The basic half-equations which form H2 and O2 gases are given in eqn (1)–(3). As a result of the uphill nature of the reaction (positive change of Gibbs free energy ΔG0 = 237 kJ mol−1 at 25 °C), back-reactions may take place between H2 and O2 to form water in addition to intermediate products. Hence the surface of the catalyst or co-catalyst (if any) should be less supportive of the back-reactions. Reduction-Pt (Fig. 4c): 2H+ (aq) + 2e− → H2 (g)(1) Oxidation-catalyst (Fig. 4c): 2H2O (l) + 4h+ → O2 (g) + 4H+(2) Overall reaction: 2H2O (l) → 2H2 (g) + O2 (g)(3)

Fig. 5 gives information about semiconducting catalysts that are suitable and unsuitable materials for H2 production. Fig. 5a shows that, for most of the semiconductors, the VB edge is deeper than the O2/H2O oxidation potential. Hence there is no need for a co-catalyst, except in special cases. To increase the value of η, the visible light region of the solar spectrum should be used. Although there are some semiconductors whose band gap covers the visible light region of solar spectrum, they are not considered as active materials because of their unsuitable band energies with respect to the NHE. These semiconductors (e.g. MoS2, Fe2O3 and WO3) are known to be photocorrosive materials as their CB minimum is lower than the thermodynamic requirement (Fig. 5b).24 Wide band gap materials cannot harvest visible light, unless suitably modified. As an example, Fig. 6 shows a schematic band diagram of doped TiO2.34 Under UV illumination (hν1), the evolution of both H2 and O2 is favourable. In the S-doped TiO2, the evolution of O2 is possible at S2− sites under illumination with visible light (hν2), i.e. the S2− state lies above the O2/H2O oxidation potential. In contrast, for V-doped TiO2, the evolution of H2 is not possible at the V4+/5+ site under illumination with visible light (hν3), i.e. the V4+/5+ state is at a higher potential than the H2/H+ reduction potential. It is important to note that the dopants form localized states. If they are accessible on the surface, then catalysis takes place from holes and electrons if the essential criteria for the redox potentials are met. Many photocatalysts have been reported to work under UV/visible light irradiation.2

Charge separation and migration of the photogenerated charge carriers are strongly affected by changes in crystal structure (polymorphs),77,92 crystallinity93 and particle size. Lattice defects act as traps or recombination centres and, consequently, the catalytic activity decreases. The density of defects can be lowered by increasing the crystallinity. By decreasing the size of the semiconductor, the photogenerated e–h pairs can migrate to the surface before they are trapped or recombined. If a catalytic site is not available even after reaching the surface, then they will have to recombine irrespective of whether they have a high enough potential to split water molecules. The surface chemical reactions depend on the SA and the density of surface defects.
Doped TiO2 is visibly active where the dopants create intermediate bands within the band gap. However, the evolution of H2 varies within TiO2 polymorphs92 (Fig. 7), in which the flat band potential of rutile and anatase varies with reference to the H+ reduction potential. The flat band potential of rutile TiO2 is almost the same as that of the reduction potential of protons, whereas that of anatase TiO2 is shifted negatively by about 0.2 V.94 This implies that the photogenerated electrons in anatase are more energetic than those in rutile. When recombination sites are dominant, as in amorphous TiO2, negligible catalytic activity is expected.95 Another polymorph of TiO2 is brookite, which has a better catalytic activity than commercial TiO2 (P-25).96 Again, the difference in the flat band potential explains the higher efficiency: for brookite, the flat band potential is cathodically shifted by 0.14 V compared with anatase. Kandiel et al.92 studied three TiO2 polymorphs with respect to their production of H2 from MeOH–H2O gas. Their results suggested that the anatase and brookite phases result in similar H2 production, whereas rutile has a lower performance. Cubic structured KNbO3 had a higher rate of H2 production than orthorhombic and commercial KNbO3.97

3. Quantification of hydrogen generation
Many types of illumination sources (Xe or Hg lamps) have been used with different amounts of catalysts. An agreed quantification method is needed so that efficiencies can be compared across different studies.
3.1. Solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency (η,%)
The efficiency of H2 generation can be measured either by quantifying the amount of H2 gas evolved or the number of electrons transferred from the photocatalyst to the water within a certain time period under illumination. The overall conversion of solar energy is given by the following equation:33 (4)where jp is the photocurrent density (mW cm−2), jpE0rev is the total power output, jp|Eapp| is the electrical power output and I0 is the power density of the incident light (mW cm−2). E0rev is the standard reversible potential (1.23 V/NHE). Eapp is the applied potential, which can be derived from Eapp= Emeas − Eaoc, where Emeas is the electrode potential of the working electrode at which the photocurrent was measured under illumination and Eaoc is the electrode potential of the same working electrode under open circuit conditions, under the same illumination when immersed in the same electrolyte. Eaoc and Eapp are measured with respect to Ag/AgCl. The voltage at which the photocurrent becomes zero is taken as Eaoc. The details of the light source can be included in the quantification process and the quantum yield (QY) can be calculated. The overall QY is defined in eqn (5) and (6) for H2 and O2, respectively:98 (5) (6)
Some photocatalysts are active in visible light, whereas others are active in the UV region of the solar spectrum. Although the principle of H2 generation is the same for both UV and visible irradiation, given the large amount of visible light available it is appropriate to discuss these regions separately.
4. UV-active nanostructured photocatalysts for hydrogen generation
Wide band gap semiconductors can only use the UV region of the solar spectrum. Nevertheless, considerable amounts of H2 have been reported47–52 to be produced when these catalysts are in the form of nanostructures.5,99 The density of active surface sites increases with increasing SA,100–102 particularly with 1D nanostructures, which have fast charge transfer rates and efficient charge separation.103 For example, NWs,93,104,105 NTs,106–110 NRs/nanoribbons111–116 and NFs44,117–121 have shown great potential for the production of H2. However, it is vital to understand which type of 1D structure is better for the generation of H2. We have carried out a comparative analysis of these 1D structures with respect to their efficiency under UV irradiation.
4.1. Nanowires
NWs have shown significance photocatalytic activity as a result of the improvement in electron–hole separation and lower recombination rates. Such remarkable features are highly desirable to enhance the efficiency of PEC water splitting. NWs have been studied extensively.93,122–124 Yang et al.122 reported that N-doped ZnO NWs used as photoanodes in PEC yielded relatively higher efficiencies as a result of the improved charge transport over the 0D nanostructures. TiO2 NWs were more effective for H2 generation than commercial TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs). The yield from these NWs was about 1.421 μmol m−2, which is significant123 and was ascribed to the high SA and low recombination rate of the e–h pairs. Jitputti et al.93 studied TiO2 NWs with methanol as a SR to show the effects of post-treatment and its consequences for the SA. The SRs removed the photogenerated holes in an irreversible fashion, thereby preventing mutual electron–hole recombination and the H2 and O2 back-reaction124 (eqn (2)). The overall process can be expressed by the following equations:125 (7) (8) (9) (10)Notably, methanol is oxidized to form CO2, which is an adverse effect. Despite this, the H2 yield was about 20.1 μmol h−1 for the samples post-treated at 500 °C for 1 h (Fig. 8). This may be because the unique 1D NWs and high crystallinity promoted the evolution of H2 under UV irradiation.93 The amount of H2 evolved increases with increasing post-treatment temperatures up to 500 °C, then decreases with further increases in temperature. The decrease may be a result of the lowered SA. A similar effect has been reported26 for lithium niobate (LiNbO3) NWs, for which a higher SA yielded better results. However, when RuO2 is used as a co-catalyst under UV-visible illumination, the overall amount of water splitting is increased.

Si NWs (n type) are known for their competitive carrier recombination. Forming a p–n heterojunction accelerates improves the separation of the photogenerated charge carriers. This was illustrated by Xiong et al.59 using Cu2O (p-type) as a core–shell structure with Pt as a co-catalyst. This composite structure showed a nearly 45% increase in the generation of H2 compared with pristine Si NWs. In addition to p–n type heterojunctions,59 n–n type heterojunctions have also been investigated in a similar core–shell structure with ZnO/ZnxCd1−xTe NWs.35 To put this in context, it is important to mention a study36 which showed the selective isolation of electron–hole pairs in an n–n type heterojunction. Such structures help to isolate the hole, thereby inhibiting back-reactions. In ZnO–ZnxCd1−xTe NW heterojunctions, the shell material absorbs in the NIR region (855 nm), in contrast with the core, which absorbs the UV region (380 nm), covering about 22% of the solar spectrum. Under suitable illumination, type II band alignment allows the transfer of photogenerated electrons from the CB of ZnxCd1−xTe (Eg tunability 2.25–1.45 eV depending on the Cd:Zn ratio) to the CB of ZnO (Fig. 9a). The recombination is delayed while the transfer takes place, yielding higher H2 production. The electrons collected at the ITO produce H2 molecules. The holes are transferred to the VB of the ZnxCd1−xTe shell and are consumed by the SR (S2− and SO32−). If the ZnxCd1−xTe covers the whole substrate, including the ITO, then it is not useful for the generation of H2. As the ITO is an expensive substrate, alternative methods of fabrication should be considered. For example, if ZnO is taken as the shell and ZnxCd1−xTe as the core, then the electrons can take part in the catalysis from a much higher SA (in the original configuration35 it is just the ITO). Even if the ZnO covers the whole substrate, good access to the electrons is preserved when the fabrication difficulties in this configuration are acknowledged.

(b) CdSe–CdS core–shell NW heterojunctions with Pt as the co-catalyst.126 etr and htr are electron and hole traps, respectively. 
These heterojunctions have been developed further by introducing Pt as a co-catalyst126 – for example, in CdSe–CdS core–shell NW heterojunctions. After charge generation the Pt acts as an electron collector and enhances the production of H2 at its best value of 434.29 μmol h−1 g−1 under UV illumination. The CdS shell also helps to passivate the surface defects of the core, which helps to increase the carrier lifetime. Tongying et al.126 illustrated a band diagram without considering the energetic locations of the bands. However, we have redrawn this (Fig. 9b), taking the CB and VB edges for the two semiconductors from Table 1. In process 1, Tongying et al.126 suggested that the electron from the CB of CdS does not reach the CB of CdSe. In process 2, the electron from the CB of CdS takes <5 ps to reach the EF of Pt. Process 3 is, of course, not possible given the physical inaccessibility. In process 4, the electron takes nearly 1–2 ps to reach the bottom of the CB of CdSe. Electron and hole trap processes (etr and htr, respectively) take place in CdSe and the time-scales are shown in Fig. 9b. Within CdSe it was suggested126 that the electrons are not excited to the bottom of the CB and hence do not recombine directly, however mediated by etr and htr. Wu et al.127 reported the evolution of H2 from N-doped TiO2 NFs (hydrothermal) decorated with Pt NPs of about 2 nm diameter under different wavelengths of illumination. The catalysts were effective in the production of H2 with conversion efficiencies of 3.6 and 12.3% for UV irradiation at 365 and 312 nm, respectively.
4.2. Nanotubes
TiO2-based NTs have been shown to have considerable efficiency as catalysts for the generation of H2 under UV irradiation.33,128–132 The physical dimensions of these NTs control the overall efficiency of water splitting. When the scattering of light within the structures increases, a higher rate of H2 generation can be expected.129 Paulose et al.33 fabricated self-aligned TiO2 NTs (134 μm length, 20–150 nm pore diameter) by anodization using a process in which the pore size and length could be tuned (Fig. 10a–c). After annealing the amorphous NTs at 550 °C, a photoconversion efficiency of about 16.25% was achieved under UV illumination. Mor et al.128 demonstrated Ti–Fe–O NTs based on thin films with an H2 production rate of about 7.1 mL W−1 h−1. Eder et al.133 reported Fe/Pt–TiO2 NTs with superior electron lifetimes and efficient charge separation under UV light.131,134 Bulk recombination is reduced by the NT architecture (porosity), while the photogenerated minority carriers (holes) can be trapped by surface states based on a model proposed by Lubberhuizen et al.135 For example, the typical time needed for holes to reach the surface is about 10−10 s in nanoporous GaP.

It is known that the noble metals (e.g. Au,136,137 Pt,46,133,138 Ag139 and Pd140) and many co-catalysts (e.g. NiOx46) act as electron reservoirs (acceptors)138 and collect photogenerated electrons from the CB of semiconductors in close contact. As a result, recombination is delayed, i.e. there is Fermi level (EF) equilibration of the metal and the semiconductor. Delayed recombination helps to enhance the activity of the catalyst. Pt is special because it has a favourable H+ chemisorption energy and a high activity for proton reduction reactions and it also has a low electrochemical impedance to discharge the absorbents.138 This is discussed in detail in Tongying et al.126 Pt forms a Schottky junction with TiO2, which is crucial for the generation of H2. However, the formation of the Schottky barrier is prevented when Pt is calcined at 873 K.141 As an additional advantage, these noble metals are not photocorrosive. However, an optimum loading of Pt should be maintained because excessive loadings decrease the production of H2 as a result of the decreased SA for chemisorption.142,143 The performance of Au depends on the shape and structure of the NTs.137
TiO2 NTs with Au NPs have shown enhanced H2 production.136 Pd quantum dots (QDs) have been used in conjunction with TiO2 NTs in a solution containing Na2CO3 and ethylene glycol (EG) with significant results.140Fig. 10a–c shows SEM images of TiO2 NT arrays with Pd QDs; the evolution of H2 is shown in Fig. 10d.140 The measurements were performed at −0.3 V versus a standard calomel electrode containing 2 M Na2CO3 + 0.5 M EG solution under 320 mW cm−2 irradiation for a Pd weight percentage of 2.15. Pt NPs have been used extensively in conjunction with TiO2 NTs,144 with a reported QY of about 16% under UV irradiation.
The recombination rate of e–h pairs in TiO2 NTs is reduced in the presence of Ag NPs (Fig. 11a–c). The yield of H2 (about 10.69 μmol h−1) is dependent on the anodization voltage and time (the texture of TiO2 NTs)139 (Fig. 11d and e). A smooth texture provides a better channel for the transport of electrons with minimal scattering. Similar results have been reported by Li et al.,145 who showed that the morphology, anodization potential and time were interlinked with the efficiency of H2 production.

An annealing temperature of about 350 °C has been found to be optimum for TiO2 NTs.146 At higher annealing temperatures, the barrier thickness of the NT arrays and Ti substrate becomes thicker, which inhibits the transfer of charge to the Ti substrate. Fig. 12 shows the generation of H2 with respect to temperature and cycle times. W-doped (W6+ state) TiO2 NTs were investigated under a glycerol/fluoride electrolyte and the production of H2 was about 24.97 μmol h−1, depending on the W loading and annealing temperature.147 The effect of the processing parameters was extended to Ta2O5 NTs by Gonçalves et al.,148 who suggested that the anodization potential, electrolyte temperature (diameter, length of NTs) and annealing temperature influence the generation of H2 with ethanol as an SR. Fig. 13 shows the current densities at different electrolyte temperatures, from which the variation in length and diameter of the tubes can be seen. Gonçalves et al.148 observed that CO, CO2, CH4, C2H4 and C2H6 gases were produced during ethanol photo-reformation. The amount of gas generated increased with increasing annealing temperature.148 Single crystalline NT arrays of SrNb2O6 with rhombic cross-sections showed superior H2 evolution compared with their bulk counterparts as a result of the smaller diffusion length of the charge carriers, in addition to the high SA.46 This was further enhanced (to 102 μmol g−1) by introducing NiOx and Pt by impregnation and photodeposition methods, respectively.

H2 production efficiencies can be enhanced by carbon-rich catalysts such as graphene, multiwalled carbon NTs (MWCNTs), carbon fibres and activated carbon. Cargnello et al.149 enhanced the generation of H2 from MWCNTs@M/TiO2 to about 10 mmol h−1 g−1 in the presence of methanol as a SR, where M = Pt or Pd. It was also suggested that the nanocomposite with Pt was slightly more active than that with Pd. This is a result of the various positive effects from the MWCNTs, Pt and the metal oxide. Primarily, MWCNTs delocalize the photogenerated electrons, thus enhancing the lifetime of the charge carriers, which eventually increases the evolution of H2.150
In a typical investigation,68 Eosin Y (EY) and triethanolamine (TEOA) were used as a sensitizer and electron donor, respectively, and the MWCNTs showed a nearly nine-fold enhancement in performance compared with other carbon-rich catalysts under simulated sunlight. Fig. 14a is a schematic representation of an EY-loaded MWCNT on which noble metal NPs can also be used. Fig. 14b shows the evolution of H2 against EY concentration.

4.3. Nanorods
Arrays of NRs have similar effects to NWs, such as a high SA111,114 promoting surface reactions rather than recombination151 and short collection lengths for excited carriers in a direction normal to light absorption. Rutile TiO2 NRs have shown efficient H2 generation in aqueous solutions containing methanol–water SRs in the presence of Cu2+ under UV light irradiation.152 In addition, the design of a radial p–n junction NR device could provide large improvements in efficiency relative to a conventional planar geometry.153
SrSnO3 NR structures were synthesized via a hydrothermal method and showed a better H2 production rate than dumb-bell like structures (Fig. 15a). Fig. 15b shows the UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectra of these NRs and dumb-bells together with a band level diagram for SrSnO3.154

Sun et al.155 used Sb-doped SnO2 NRs as a transparent electrode in the presence of H2O2 SR, which improved the conductivity of the scaffold. The improvement in PEC performance is a result of enhanced charge separation efficiency and charge injection efficiency. Controlled incorporation of Sn-doped TiO2 NRs achieved a good PEC performance.156 Wang et al.143 reported that the well dispersed CdZnS single crystalline NRs showed higher H2 generation than CdS when the aqueous solution contained two different SRs (SO32− and S2−) with and without Pt under simulated solar light. This enhancement is attributed to the abundant hydrogen reactive sites on CdZnS. However, the incorporation of SRs, co-catalysts, sensitizers, electrolytes and reducing agents yielded a better performance.144 The parameters affecting the catalytic activity of SRs are not yet well understood. A higher activity is associated with the proton-exchange capability of the materials. Sometimes the native material performs better in the absence of co-catalysts.
Nanostructures of Zn2GeO4 have been reported by a number of researchers.25,76,77,157,158 Liang et al.76 reported on hexagonal Zn2GeO4 NFs and NRs (Fig. 16a and b) and compared the evolution of H2 with its bulk counterpart (Fig. 16c). The results suggest that Zn2GeO4 NRs show better H2 evolution than the NFs and bulk particles where the NRs have predominant reflections from the (110), (21), (12), (1), (20) and (10) planes. Another study on Zn2GeO4 suggested that a rhombohedral phase crystal orientation yields better H2 evolution.77 Similar to the TiO2 nanostructures (section 4.2), the process parameters of Zn2GeO4 play a crucial part in determining the efficiency of catalytic H2 generation. Lin et al.157 studied the evolution of H2 in relation to the calcination temperature of Zn2GeO4 NRs. The results (Fig. 17) suggested that a higher calcination temperature (1000 °C) gives a performance as high as 430 μmol h−1 g−1, which is nearly seven times higher than that of a sample calcined at 400 °C.157 However, the SA dropped to one-fifth of that of the sample calcined at 400 °C. Although the SA influences H2 production, a more crucial parameter is the quality of the crystal and its facets.25,77 Yan et al.25 reported that Zn2GeO4 NRs have the best performance with 3 wt% of RuO2. The overall water splitting performance depends on the synthesis temperature; NRs obtained at lower temperatures (40 °C) had a dominant (110) crystal face. This face may induce strong CO2 gas adsorption and hence higher H2 production. Liang et al.158 reported a method for crystal orientation and the self-assembly of Zn2GeO4 NRs.

Similar to other core–shell heterojunction catalysts, Yang et al.159 reported the fabrication of In2O3–In2S3 core–shell NRs that showed a better performance than their individual NR counterparts. Fig. 18 shows the band diagram of the interface of the In2O3 and In2S3 shell, where the energetic alignment of the bands favours the transfer of both electrons and holes to the shell layer (type I band alignment). It is notable that, if the electrons and holes are transferred to the shell region, then the recombination is delayed, yielding O2 and H2, which may cause a back-reaction.

4.4. Electrospun nanofibres
Electrospinning is a versatile and convenient technology to produce 1D nanostructures,160–163 although there are other physical and chemical methods to synthesize fibres.164–169 1D NFs are important in electronics, optoelectronics, magnetic sensors,170 photo-dye degradation,36,171–173 photocatalysis174 and in energy-harvesting technologies.175–178 Functional electrospun NFs have important optical179–185 and/or electronic properties.186–197 In the context of H2 production, TiO2 electrospun NFs (Fig. 19) perform better than nanostructures produced by hydrothermal synthesis, where process parameters such as the calcination temperature, crystallinity and SA are determining factors (Fig. 20).117

The results suggest that a calcination temperature of 450 °C is the optimum to give the highest yield. However, although calcination at 400 °C gave the highest SA, the H2 evolution is not significant, as a result of the lowered crystallinity (Fig. 20b). Similar to NRs and NWs, noble metal NPs are used in conjunction with NFs and act as an electron skin, enhancing H2 production. Zhang et al.118 used Au and Pt NPs simultaneously in the presence of SRs (0.1 M L-ascorbic acid at pH 4.0). Their results suggested that the best combination is Au0.25/Pt0.25/TiO2.118 Zhang et al.118 reported that no H2 is evolved for Au NPs under surface plasmon resonance illumination (about 550 nm or visible light). The process of electrospinning can also be applied to mixed oxides such as TiO2–SnO2119 and the calcination temperature plays a key part in the efficiency of H2 generation (methanol is used as an SR). Another catalyst combination is SrTiO3–TiO2 NFs, for which the efficiency is better than the individual counterparts when a water–methanol mixture is used as a SR under UV irradiation.198 Similar to the earlier examples, the H2 yield is dependent on the calcination temperature and the SA.120 These composite fibres contrast with core–shell structures where the combination of materials can be selected so that electrons are transferred to the shell region and holes are transferred to the core region. However, in composite structures, the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes is delayed during the transfer while both stay within the structure. The long NF structure and larger specific SA are advantageous for catalytic activity.121 Our group has reported the development of MWCNT–TiO2 NFs and their H2 generation capability.44
4.5. Two-dimensional nanostructures
2D nanostructures such as nanobelts (NBs),199–201 NSs,202–204 nanoplates,205–207 nanolayers,208,209 nanoribbons,115,210 and nanoleaves211 are also efficient for the production of H2. The transfer of charge carriers to the surface takes place in a similar manner to 1D structures and helps to enhance performance.201,212–216
Pure TiO2 NS surfaces are catalytically inactive as a result of the presence of a large over-potential and fast backward reaction (generation of H2O), whereas surface-fluorinated Pt–TiO2 NSs have significant catalytic activity.217 However, in sharp contrast, ultrathin TiO2 NSs showed a high catalytic activity as a result of a shorter migration time, which suppressed recombination.218Fig. 21a shows the process of producing photogenerated electrons and holes at the TiO2 surface, where Pt acts as an electron skin (Fig. 21b). However, an optimum amount of Pt should be determined because further increases in the Pt content decrease the production of H2 (Fig. 21c). TiO2 NSs showed a better performance than commercial TiO2 anatase powder,219 whereas TiOx NSs fabricated by photodepositing the metal and metal oxide showed enhanced activity203 with slower e–h recombination in the TiOx NSs than in the single crystalline counterparts. In single crystalline NSs, the photogenerated electrons react at the edge of the NSs while, in contrast, the holes react over all of the surface.

ZnO NB arrays have shown better activity than thin films or the rod/comb-like ZnO nanostructures under similar conditions.199 Micro- and nanocomponents of ZnO were combined by Lu et al.,7 in which NS networks on hexagonal pyramid-like microcrystals were studied to determine their catalytic performance. In this complex structure, electrons were transferred from the NSs of high electrical potential to the core micro-pyramids of low electrical potential; this reduces the probability of photogenerated e–h recombination. NiO hollow microspheres showed greater catalytic activity than rods6 because the microspheres facilitated a higher density of active sites and a better surface charge carrier transfer rate.
Semiconducting niobate NSs were integrated220,221 into two-component nanostructure systems with separate sites for water reduction and oxidation. Although WO3 is inactive for H2 evolution, its derivative Na2W4O13 is active for overall water splitting from aqueous solutions containing SRs where the later have a layered structure (see ref. 247 cited in Chen et al.222). Bi2WO6 nanoplates were reported by Zhang and Zhu.206 Kale et al.8 reported that CdIn2S4 nanostructures with a marigold-like morphology composed of numerous nanosized petals displayed significant H2 production from H2S in KOH aqueous solution.
A special class of 2D NSs self-assembled into a 3D architecture is another important research area in photocatalysis.6–11 Layered titanates have been introduced for H2 production as a result of their proton-exchange capability in the absence of co-catalysts.223,224 Sodium trititanate (Na2Ti3–xMxO7), potassium tetratitanate (K2Ti4−xMxO9) (where M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu and x varies from 0.15 to 0.30) and their substituted samples with SiO2-pillared structures at the interlayer showed high activities.223Fig. 22 shows the effect of the BET SA of the unsubstituted tri- and tetratitanates with respect to H2 generation. Layered double hydroxides have the general formula [MII(1−x)–MIIIx(OH)2]An−x/n·mH2O, where MII is a divalent metal cation (e.g. Mg2+, Co2+, Ni2+ or Zn2+), MIII is a trivalent metal cation (e.g. Al3+, Cr3+, Ga3+ or Fe3+) and A− can be an organic and/or inorganic anion (see references cited in Parida et al.209). These layered hydroxides can be doped with a cation at the octahedral sites, which yields properties similar to doped semiconductors. Mg/Al layered double hydroxides with incorporated Fe3+ showed significant H2 production.209 Compton et al.220,221 reported calcium niobate (HCa2Nb3O10) NSs with Pt for photochemical generation of H2. Ferroelectric materials, such as the stibiotantalites, SbMO4 (M = Nb, Ta) were investigated for H2 production in the form of NPs.208 The evolution rate of H2 from SbTaO4 (3.72 eV) was approximately twice as high as that of SbNbO4 (3.12 eV) and was further enhanced after the incorporation of a RuO2 co-catalyst. The differences in activity are attributed to the higher CB edge of SbTaO4 (Ta 5d orbitals in TaO6 octahedral configuration) and the high dielectric constant, which enhances the photogenerated charge separation.
 Fig. 22  Properties of different semiconductors: (a, b) BET surface area and (c) H2 production. The figure is redrawn based on the results from ref. 223. 
Polyoxometalates, such as Bi2W2O9, BaBi4Ti4O15 and Bi3TiNbO9 layered structures, are highlighted for H2 evolution in the presence of SRs in a review article by Yamase.225 Scheelite-structured PbMoO4 shows activities for H2 and O2 evolution in the presence of SRs under UV irradiation. The substituted compounds Na0.5Bi0.5MoO4, Ag0.5Bi0.5MoO4, Na0.5Bi0.5WO4 and Ag0.5Bi0.5WO4 are also active for O2 evolution;222 however, molybdates and tungstates only respond to UV. Pb, Bi and Ag play important parts in the structure of the VB. Solid solutions of b-Ga2O3 and In2O3 consisting of d10 cations have been systematically studied for H2 or O2 evolution from aqueous solutions in the presence of SRs. In these catalysts, the band gap and luminescent energy decrease as the ratio of indium increases.222
Sabio et al.226 reported that hydroxide-supported calcium niobium (HCa2Nb3O10) NSs had a superior H2 production rate under UV irradiation in the presence of SR or co-catalysts. NSs produced H2 at a high rate compared with their bulk counterparts. The structural conversion of TiO2 NPs to NSs showed their high catalytic activity for H2 generation and the removal of environmental pollution.227 Pt-loaded TiO2 hierarchical photonic crystals41 have shown a doubling of efficiency. The rate of hydrogen production was 247 μmol h−1 and the QY was about 11.9%. The experimental results showed that the stop band reflectivity was suppressed, enhancing the evolution of H2. Zhou et al.81 fabricated a leaf-like structure by copying the complex architecture of leaves and replacing the natural photosynthetic pigments with catalysts to realize an efficient catalyst. The use of 20% aqueous methanol as an SR might have improved the rate of evolution of H2 (Table 2).

5. Modified visible light active photocatalysts for hydrogen generation
Photogenerated electrons easily recombine with holes in semiconductors. This recombination leads to the low quantum efficiency (QE) of photocatalysis. SRs can effectively restrain this recombination process and improve the QE. Several common approaches have been adopted to activate wide band gap materials to visible light for water splitting: (1) doping with metal and/or non-metal ions; (2) controlling the band structure by developing solid solutions; (3) dye sensitization; (4) band gap engineering; and (5) combining wide band gap materials with visible light active semiconductors. The visible light activity of nanostructured materials has been important in enhancing the efficiency of electron injection to the CB in photocatalysts.
5.1. Nanowires
The fabrication and doping of a variety of nanostructures has improved the activity of PEC water splitting. The confined dimensionality of 1D and 2D structures offers enhanced light absorption as a result of the large active SA and ultrafast charge transport behaviour. In the introduction, we outlined the thermodynamic requirement24 that must be met to avoid catalyst corrosion. However, CdS (Eg = 2.4 eV) is very effective in splitting water under visible light irradiation229 in the presence of SRs such as S2− and SO32−. Fig. 23 shows the effect of SA and generation of H2 with respect to synthesis temperature. As the synthesis temperature increases, the evolution of H2 also increases, despite the decrease in the SA (Fig. 23a). The rate of H2 production was improved by incorporating graphitic (g-C3N4) structures with CdS under visible light irradiation (see Table 3).230 In the presence of Pt and SRs, CdS showed further improvement in H2 production.104 Titanic acid NWs/EY in the presence of Pt NPs and TEOA have been shown to yield significant H2.231 The performance of NWs was significantly improved by introducing Au NPs;137 it was noted that the H2 yield depends on the shape and structure of Au. Kibria et al.232 reported GaN NW photocatalysts for spontaneous water splitting to produce H2 under visible and IR light irradiation.

With respect to heterostructures, CdS–TiO2 NTs were investigated for H2 production233 and the results suggested a QE of about 43.4% under visible light irradiation (≥ 420 nm). The high activity is a result of the quantum size effect and the potential gradient at the interface.234 Liu et al.234 combined Si (cathode) and TiO2 (anode) NWs; both the difference in the band gap of these materials and the band alignment are notable (Fig. 24). In this instance e–h pairs are generated in Si and TiO2 under illumination during the absorption of different wavelength regions of the solar spectrum. The band bending shown in Fig. 24d favours the transfer of electrons from TiO2 to recombine with holes in Si. The electrons from Si and holes from TiO2 take part in H2 and O2 generation, respectively.

1D NWs of the multi-band gap metal nitride (InGaN–GaN) heterostructure facilitated efficient matching and use of the incident solar irradiation.235 InGaN–GaN NWs with various doping levels of In facilitated a broad range of absorption wavelengths with co-catalyst Rh–Cr2O3 core–shell NPs.236Fig. 25a shows the SEM image of GaN–InGaN NWs grown on GaN nanowire templates on an Si(111) substrate; Fig. 25b suggests the reaction mechanism on the co-catalyst and InGaN–GaN NWs. Water splitting takes place on both GaN and InGaN NWs (Fig. 25c) under suitable illumination. With increasing wavelength, the apparent QE decreases (Fig. 25d). Similar work with GaN and InGaN heterostructures have been reported by the same research group.237

5.2. Nanotubes
In general, surface defects such as oxygen vacancies on the semiconductors play a crucial part in catalysis.36,172,173,238–241 The oxygen vacancies serve as adsorption sites depending on their physical location within the catalyst, as well as help to delay recombination.36,72,173 For TiO2 NTs, Kang et al.242 suggested that NaBH4 treatment could control the defects on the surface. The treated surface had better electron transfer properties at the semiconductor/electrolyte interface than the parent surface. However, predominant oxygen vacancies will not help to enhance the H2 production. Similar results were obtained on surface-fluorinated TiO2 nanoporous films. TiO2 NTs with Pd QDs as a co-catalyst facilitated a relatively higher efficiency of photocatalytic H2 generation140 (Fig. 26).

(b) Schematic diagram of Pd QDs–TiO2 NTs and the charge transfer process from TiO2 to Pd (lower right panel). This figure is reproduced with copyright permission from ref. 140. 
1D nanostructured titanate NTs are known for their cation-exchange capacities, which allow high loading of the active catalysts. Li and Lu244 investigated Na2Ti2O4(OH)2 NTs in the presence of triethanolamine (TEA) and Pt. Titanates have been investigated for their photocatalytic degradation of dye molecules,171 but they should also be considered for H2 production because of their predominant surface defect densities, which enhance catalysis.
Li et al.245 reported that EY–MWCNTs in the presence of TEOA (electron donor) showed significant H2 generation under visible light illumination (λ ≥ 420 nm). The role of MWCNTs is similar to that of the noble metals in the context of delaying recombination by trapping electrons and they may be a good substitute for Pt. Type I and type II band alignments consist of two semiconductors such as CdS–TiO2,243 whereas ternary (CdS–TiO2–Pt and CdS–TiO2–CNTs) and quaternary (CdS–TiO2–Pt–CNTs) composites have also demonstrated significant H2 generation. In all these instances, cascaded charge transfer takes place between the TiO2 and CdS, while the Pt and/or CNTs act as electron collectors.246 TiO2 in the form of NTs modified by CdS nanostructures have been investigated243 (Fig. 27a). p-type Cu–Ti–O NTs with n type TiO2 NTs have shown significant photocurrent generation, although they are self-biased as a result of suitable band alignment (Fig. 27b).132 CdS–trititanate NTs have been investigated for their H2 generation capability. Effective charge separation is evidenced in this composite, which favours the catalytic activity.247

5.3. Nanorods
The incorporation of a small amount (about 1%) of copper ions into TiO2 NRs gave an improved performance over their pure counterparts under solar light.248 Doping caused the band gap to shrink from 3.10 to 2.84 eV. However, a further decrease in Eg (2.40 eV at about 3% Cu doping) decreased the production of H2 by about five times in pure water. In the presence of MeOH aqueous solution, the production of H2 from 1 and 3% Cu-doped TiO2 is comparable. It was suggested that a lower band gap may not enhance photon harvest in all instances. Severe doping may cause lattice defects or the formation of a secondary phase that might act as an electron trap, thereby decreasing the production of H2. However, if the density of the hole traps can be increased, then the H2 productivity can be increased, or, at least, the back-reactions can be minimized. The morphology and crystal quality help to enhance the generation of H2, as seen with CdS NRs and nanograins, where NRs gave better results.113 CdS NRs modified with Ni(OH)2 (23 mol%) showed the highest reported generation of H2 under visible light irradiation249 (Fig. 28a). Fig. 28b shows that the potential of Ni2+/Ni is lower than the CB of CdS and more negative than the H+/H2 potential. This alignment favours the transfer of electron from the CB of CdS to Ni(OH)2 and the reduction of H+ to H2. Based on the band gap of iron oxide (corresponding to absorption in the visible range), maghemite (γ-Fe2O3)–haematite (α-Fe2O3) core–shell NRs were produced and showed a higher evolution of H2 from H2S than their individual NRs.250 Porous ZnFe2O4 NRs showed effective evolution of H2 from an aqueous methanol solution under visible light; the shapes and intraparticle porous structure were beneficial for the rapid transfer of photogenerated carriers onto the surface.252 The evolution of O2 was not detected, as a result of the mismatched energy levels of the VB (of ZnFe2O4) and the oxidation potential of water. Surprisingly, without using any SRs, an Au NRs/TiO2 cap/Pt NP configuration252 produced about 2.8 mmol h−1 g of H2. The improved evolution of H2 was a result of the promotion of trap-bound electrons in the TiO2 to the CB. These electrons were then captured by Pt to participate in the H2 evolution.150

5.4. Electrospun nanofibres
Metal oxide composite NFs228,253 have also proved to be efficient in H2 generation. Zhang et al.254 reported plasmon enhancement of photocatalytic H2 generation over Au–Pt–TiO2 electrospun NFs. Yousef et al.255 suggested that the incorporation of transition metal NPs strongly modifies the physiochemical characteristics of the metal oxide nanostructures. Lee et al.254 have shown that TiO2–CuO composite NFs are promising for H2 production. Fig. 29a–c shows typical SEM images of the electrospun fibres and H2 production over time. Charge generation and subsequent catalysis are shown in Fig. 29d. Similar work by the same research group has also been published elsewhere.228 It has been reported that the combination of Fe2O3 NPs and TiO2 NFs has advantages over the individual materials and enhances light absorption.256 An effective strategy to overcome photocorrosion and toxicity problems from CdS-based materials is their incorporation in polymeric NFs. CdS and CdS–PdS NPs were mixed in poly(vinyl acetate) electrospun NFs and the composite produced more H2 than bare CdS NPs.257 The efficiency of H2 generation also depends on the morphology of the NFs.83 Yang et al.83 reported that electrospun core–shell CdS–ZnO NFs showed excellent H2 generation under visible light. The activity was mainly attributed to high visible light absorption and low charge carrier recombination. N-doped TiO2 electrospun NFs were also explored for efficient H2 generation and the efficiency was found to be dependent on the concentration of the N precursor.45 Caterpillar-like ZnO nanostructures on ZnO force-spun NFs showed about 0.165% photon-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency;258 the increase is accounted for by enhanced light-harvesting ability and the effective electron–hole separation.

5.5. Two-dimensional nanostructures

5.5.1. Nanosheets. 
CdS NSs produced by a two-step synthesis were able to produce H2 at about 4.1 mM h−1 under visible light259 (Fig. 30a). From earlier results, it is clear that Pt is an excellent co-catalyst. However, it is vital to quantify its loading percentage. As expected, excessive loadings may not increase the yield and the optimum loading is shown in Fig. 30b. This study also optimized the concentration of SRs and H2 evolution from various cycles (Fig. 30c and d). ZnS (Eg = 3.4 eV) is not active in the visible region, in contrast with ZnIn2S4,260 which has an almost five times higher activity in the presence of Pt in the visible region than its pristine counterpart. ZnS NSs have been studied in combination with CuS–Cu2S in the presence of Na2S and Na2SO3.88Fig. 31a shows H2 production rates from different catalyst combinations. Pristine ZnS (CZ0) has a negligible production of H2 as its band gap is too large to absorb visible light. In contrast, after the addition of small amounts of CuS to ZnS, the generation of H2 is abruptly increased under visible light irradiation. Fig. 31b shows the mechanism for the production of H2 by CuS–ZnS porous NSs.

(c) Energetic values of the CB and VB positions of ZnS, Cu2S and CuS taken from the corresponding references as follows: ZnS (1),88 Cu2S (2)262,263 and CuS (p) (3). The figure (c) is redrawn based on the results from ref. 88, 261–263. 
The band-to-band transition of ZnS cannot take place under visible light irradiation due to the large band gap energy. Pure CuS also shows no visible light activity, although the combination CuS–ZnS provides a platform for visible light activity. Zhang et al.88 did not mention the VB of CuS–Cu2S, but the band diagram suggests a band gap of 2.94 eV where the VBs of ZnS and CuS–Cu2S are at the same energy level. If we consider the published band diagram of CuS and Cu2S, the VB of ZnS and CuS or Cu2S are not energetically in line with each other (Fig. 31c). If interfacial charge transfer has to take place, then the energy difference from the VB of ZnS to the VB of Cu2S–CuS should be taken into account. In the band gap range 1.2–2.15 eV (CuS–Cu2S combined), illumination at 420 nm is sufficient to create e–h pairs in these semiconductors. In this instance, the transfer of charge takes place from CuS–Cu2S to ZnS. The interfacial regions are generally defective and we can therefore expect charge carrier traps within the interface. Another combination of heterostructures is NiO–CdS,264 where the CdS absorbs visible light and photogenerated electrons are transferred to the NiO. This combination has shown significant H2 production (Fig. 32a). Fig. 32b shows the band alignment and corresponding charge transfer phenomenon under visible light irradiation.

Graphene, apart from having outstanding electrical conductivity, can also inhibit the recombination of the electron–hole pairs by collecting the electrons and enhancing the absorption of visible light. This phenomenon is similar to that of the noble metal NPs.265Fig. 33 shows the mechanism and influence of graphene oxide with CdS clusters for the high efficiency photocatalytic production of H2 driven by visible light.265

5.5.2. Nanolayers. 
Simulation studies266 on MoS2 layered structures suggest that pristine single-layer MoS2 is a good candidate for H2 production. The catalytic activity can be improved by applying a small in-plane compressive strain or an out-of-plane tensile strain. p-type doping (with phosphorus) can also be used to enhance the overall splitting of water. Fig. 34 shows the changes that occur as a result of doping. A layered Zn–In–S photocatalyst in the presence of NaCl also shows high visible light activity for the evolution of H2.267 Morphologically similar structures have been produced with ZnIn2S4 and their activity for H2 production tested.268

5.5.3. Nanoribbons. 
The MoS2 layered structure has been shown to have potential for the evolution of H2. In this instance, the MoS2 layers are exfoliated via ultrasonication and chemically linked to CdSe nanoribbons. The resultant composite has a QY of 9.2% at 440 nm, whereas bulk CdSe is not active for this reaction. The overall increase is nearly four times, although this depends on the mass percentage of MoS2. The chemical linkage of Pt NPs to the CdSe nanoribbons did not influence the evolution of H2.269


5.5.4. Metal-free photocatalysts. 
Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) has potential for the production of H2 from water under visible light illumination.270 Under suitable illumination, the creation of e–h pairs is similar to that in metal oxide photocatalysts, where the electrons are excited to the CB and holes are created in the VB. In this example, the oxidation of H2O takes place at the N atoms, whereas the C atoms provide reduction sites for H2 (Fig. 35). A similar study has been reported by Wang et al.270

The 1D graphitic carbon nitride NRs were synthesized on a template and decorated with Pt NPs.272 This hybrid material showed a surprisingly high H2 yield with a low specific SA in the presence of a triethanolamine scavenger. The enhancement is ascribed to the efficient charge separation of the 2D layered structures. Huang et al.273 reported bio-inspired carbon nitride mesoporous NSs composed of nanospheres and with the possibility of H2 generation.

6. Conclusions and future prospects
Nanomaterials have attracted much attraction and there have been high expectations of innovations in many research areas, including medicine, communications, materials development and energy and environmental technology. At the same time there is growing concern that nanomaterials may be hazardous to both health and the environment. In the energy sector, nanomaterials have great potential as they can be used in energy-absorbing materials, such as batteries, fuel cells and solar cells, for the storage of energy. Although nanomaterials are seen by some workers as the way to meet future requirements, they have some disadvantages. As these particles are very small, problems can arise from their inhalation. Nanotechnology is currently very expensive and further development will be costly; manufacturing difficulties may increase the cost of the products. Realistic market costs of nanomaterials have been reported online.275
Environmentally friendly and cost-effective fuels are in great demand and this is why H2 production is of interest. Although it is a promising technology, there are many challenges that require further development before it can be used on an industrial scale. One challenge is the fabrication of a catalyst that harvests H2 from a non-conventional energy resource such as solar energy with significant efficiency. Wide band gap semiconductors cannot use the visible region of the solar spectrum. Some small band gap materials require SRs or are unstable in long-term usage because of the thermodynamic requirement of the positions of the CB and VB. SRs can inhibit back-reactions by capturing photogenerated holes,93 but tend to form CO2 instead of O2,124 which has an adverse effect on the environment. Industrial waste (sulfides from aqueous solutions containing S2− and SO32−) can be used as an SR. These techniques not only clean the environment, but also produce valuable H2 energy. Wide band gap materials can be subjected to band gap engineering to enable activity in the visible light region by doping or creating intrinsic defects. Care should be taken with intrinsic defects as they can act as electron traps, reducing the efficiency of production, whereas hole traps are useful. Defect-mediated catalysis is of prime importance, although these concepts require further investigation.
Delaying the recombination of the photogenerated e–h pairs is the primary objective in enhancing the catalytic activity. The availability of these charge carriers, especially the electrons, on the surface of the catalyst is vital. The transport of electrons to the surface can be improved by creating an internal electric field via heterojunctions. The best studied heterojunctions are based on NWs or NRs, which possess the crucial property of vectorial charge transport. Various methods have been used to fabricate these 1D structures, although electrospinning has the most potential because of its versatility in producing such structures.
It is important to consider a semiconductor combination that drives electrons to the surface of the heterocatalyst, while other combinations separate e–h pairs in the background. Such a combination should increase the harvesting of solar energy. For example, ZnxCd1−xTe in conjunction with ZnO in heterostructures helps to extend the absorption of solar energy into the NIR region, which can be as high as 22% of the solar spectrum.35
In the process of fabrication, inorganic nanostructures are generally subjected to thermal treatment(s), note that there are exceptions. Various studies have shown the dependence of H2 production on processing parameters, such as the calcination temperature. However, excessively high temperatures can decrease the output.93 The calcination temperature is crucial in determining the quality of the crystal, which, in turn, determines the efficacy of H2 evolution when balanced against the defect density. The density of defects is also process-dependent. The catalytic activity is related to the number density of active sites, which may not be directly related to the SA measured through N2 adsorption and desorption curves. Irregularities on the surface may increase the SA; however, the increased area is not necessarily directly correlated with H2 evolution. For example, H2 evolution increases with synthesis temperature, although the SA decreases.229 The characteristic defect density238–241 may be obtained from photoluminescence measurements. These can be correlated with the photocatalytic activity36,172,173 to give a better understanding of the development of promising materials. The photoluminescence may be taken as a standard measurement to quantify the defect density from radiative recombinations. The relation between SA and H2 evolution has been extensively studied, but a clear correlation has not been obtained because the evolution of H2 depends on a number of variables, such as the catalyst properties,276 the particle size,277 co-catalysts, the SRs, sensitizers85 and, in particular, the kinetics of the chemical reactions that lead to the final formation of O2 and H2.278
Finally, the following points need to be considered for the design of efficient and cost-effective photocatalysts: (i) band gap engineering to improve the absorption of photons in the solar spectrum; (ii) an increase in the recombination time of the photogenerated excitons so they can take part in photocatalysis; and (iii) avoidance of back-reactions to form water.

(b) PEC diode consisting of TiO2 and Cu–Ti–O NT arrays. The oxygen-evolving TiO2 side absorbs UV irradiation and the Cu–Ti–O side absorbs the visible part of the spectrum, evolving H2. Figure is reproduced with copyright permission from ref. 132.	 

 	Fig. 28  (a) Comparison of H2 production for various ratios of CdS to Ni(OH)2 (SN). The ratios (in parentheses) for various samples were SN0 (0), SN (0.5), SN (6), SN (23), SN (29), SN(38), N (100) with 1 wt% Pt–CdS under visible light in a TEA aqueous solution. (b) Proposed mechanism for H2 production. This figure is reproduced with copyright permission from ref. 249.	 

 	Fig. 29  (a) FE-SEM images of TiO2–CuO at 6 mol% in Cu NFs. (b) High magnification FE-SEM image. (c) H2 evolution with time. (d) Schematic band gap diagram of TiO2/CuO heterojunction. Reproduced with copyright permission from ref. 253.	 

 	Fig. 30  Evolution of H2 with (a) amount of CdS catalyst with 10 wt% Pt and (b) Pt loading (0.15 g CdS). (c) Concentration of SRs against H2 evolution rate from 0.15 g of Pt–CdS and (d) 0.15 g of 10 wt% Pt–CdS. (a), (b) and (d) used a 0.25 M Na2SO3 + 0.35 M Na2S electrolyte. All reactions were performed under visible light. Reproduced with the copyright permission from ref. 259.	 

 	Fig. 31  (a) Comparison of H2 production using CuS/ZnS porous NSs and ZnS samples under visible light in the presence of 0.35 M Na2S + 0.25 M Na2SO3.
