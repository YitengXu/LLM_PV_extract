    , Accepted 17th November 2017First published on 22nd November 2017AbstractA series (10 examples) of thienyl spacing D–π-A push–pull chromophores end-capped with a triphenylamine (TPA) donor and tetracyanobutadiene (TCBD) acceptor have been synthesized in high yields. The synthesis of these chromophores as well as their synthetic precursors was accomplished in good to excellent chemical yields. Interestingly, acetylenic precursors displayed strong emissive properties with a large Stokes shift and positive solvatochromism behaviour. The photophysical investigation of the targeted chromophores revealed that their low optical band gap (ca. 1.38 to 1.62 eV) coupled with excellent molar absorptivity (ca. 28800 to 90500 M−1 cm−1) ensures good light-harvesting properties, while the electrochemical studies revealed their deep HOMO (ca. −5.31 to −5.16 eV) and LUMO (ca. −3.49 to −4.31 eV) energy levels suggesting them to be promising semiconducting materials for organic solar cell applications. An inverse bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic device with a cell configuration of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/V2O5/Ag was fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these molecular semiconductors as active layer materials. A cursory analysis of the device performance of all materials under identical conditions showed a reasonable power conversion efficiency ranging from 1.95 to 3.33%. These initial results are encouraging for TPA-TCBD adjoined semiconductors with an indication of prospective applications and development, since their potential was little explored in small molecule-based organic solar cells.
Introduction
The synthesis and development of new molecular semiconductors as charge transporting or active layer materials in organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices has received paramount importance in recent times.1 Within this purview, the synthesis of low band gap π-semiconductors displaying an absorbance >700 nm is highly desirable for efficient photocurrent generation from low energy photons.2 Stating about organic semiconductors, their band gap (Eg) in general can be fine-tuned by employing strategies such as chemical rigidification, inductive/mesomeric effects, non-covalent interactions, regioregularity-induced interchain coupling, aromaticity with bond length alteration and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) by alternating the donor–acceptor (D–A) arrangement.3 Amongst these strategies, molecular construction of ICT chromophores by implementing a strong D–A push–pull arrangement by single or multiple electron-withdrawing units (acceptors) is perhaps the most appealing as it would lead to absorption in the near-IR region (Eg < 1.6 eV).4 Especially, the use of 1,1,4,4-tetracyanobuta-1,3-diene (TCBD) as an acceptor unit has gained considerable significance, because of its propensity to red shift the UV-vis absorption edge (λonset) with fairly high molar absorptivity (ε).5 In general, these acceptors are prepared by reacting alkynes with tetracyanoethylene (TCNE) through a tandem [2 + 2]-cycloaddition/retro-electrocyclization.6 These molecular sub-units when tethered with appropriate π-conjugated spacers and/or donors find a myriad of applications as materials for nonlinear optics, piezochromicity, dye-sensitized solar cells, electro-optics, and photochromic and solvatochromic probes.7 However, their utility as active layer materials for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells was little explored, largely because of their distorted geometry and only a few reports have been disclosed to date.8 To address this issue and to establish their worth in organic photovoltaics, we envisioned the construction of TCBD-based new D–π-A push–pull systems with particular emphasis on using thienyl groups and triphenylamine (TPA) as a π-spacer and donor, respectively. Parallel to our research interest in the organic molecules of medicinal relevance,9 we recently initiated a research program on functional organic materials for energy conversion.10 In connection with this endeavor, we herein report the synthesis of a new series of D–π-A push–pull chromophores as low band gap molecular semiconductors based on a thienyl π-spacer anchored with TPA and TCBD as donor and acceptor groups, respectively. These ICT chromophores displayed a remarkably low optical band gap coupled with deep HOMO–LUMO energy levels that makes them suitable candidates for organic small molecule solar cells by exhibiting moderate power conversion efficiencies. Additionally, the starting materials required for our study displayed interesting photoluminescence properties and a compilation of all these results is disclosed in this paper.
Results and discussion
Molecular design and synthesis
As presented in Scheme 1, our synthetic strategy commenced from the preparation of the TPA-donor moiety 4 by a slightly modified Hagfeldt's procedure. Towards this end, TPA 1 was subjected to the Vilsmeier–Haack formylation to afford TPA-carboxaldehyde 2, which was followed by reduction with NaBH4 to produce the corresponding alcohol 3. The latter upon phosphination with triphenylphosphonium bromide using acetonitrile under refluxing conditions11 gave a quantitative yield of the Wittig salt 4.12 Having synthesized the requisite donor in an overall excellent yield, we next turned our attention towards the synthesis of the desired D–π-A chromophores. In this connection, a solvent-free Sonogashira–Hagihara reaction13 between 2-iodothienyl aldehydes (5a–d) and terminal alkynes (6a–f) was carried out to obtain the cross-coupled intermediates (7a–m) in good to excellent yields. These intermediates upon Wittig olefination with phosphonium salt 4 using K2CO3 as a base produced a mixture of E/Z-olefinated products. This mixture was isomerized to thermodynamically more stable E-isomers by refluxing in chloroform under the catalysis of iodine. The resultant Wittig adducts 8a–m upon [2 + 2] cycloaddition–cycloreversion with TCNE 9 in 1,2-dichloroethane at 40 °C for 6 h granted access to hitherto unknown D–π-A molecular systems (10a–j). The reaction proceeds smoothly for all aryl/heteroaryl substrates and afforded the target molecules in attractive synthetic yields. However, a slightly reduced yield was observed for compounds possessing the 3-thienyl substituent (10f and 10g). Nevertheless, the substrate scope of our methodology is broad to include different π-spacers like thiophene (10a, 10e and 10h), bithiophene (10b, 10f and 10i), terthiophene (10c) and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (10d, 10g and 10j). Needless to mention that peripheral groups directly attached to the TCBD unit such as phenyl (10a–d), 3-thienyl (10e–g) and 2-thienyl (10h–j) were also tolerable under the conditions. Conversely, substrates possessing linear alkyl chains such as n-butyl (8k), n-hexyl (8l) and n-decyl (8m) completely failed to undergo the final reaction even after refluxing the reaction mixture for 4 days. Despite this limitation, we have manifested the utility of our procedure for the synthesis of ten derivatives (10a–10j) in overall high chemical yields. At this juncture, it is pertinent to mention that compounds 10a and 10b were not unprecedented in the literature, but were prepared via different synthetic routes in moderate yields.14 However, the synthesis of these compounds was achieved in improved yields through our protocol. Notably, all chromophores (10a–10j) exhibited good solubility in most of the organic solvents (viz. chloroform, acetone, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene), which is an indication to realize solution-processed device fabrication. Indeed, this property circumvents any pre-functionalization with alkyl chains, which otherwise has to be incorporated during the synthesis stage to enhance the solubility.15 The obtained products were purified by column chromatography and thoroughly characterized by IR, 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS (ESI†). As an illustrative example, the IR spectrum of compound 10a exhibits a stretching peak at 2215 cm−1 characteristic of the nitrile functionality. In 13C NMR, four less intense peaks resonated at δ 111.7, 112.1, 113.4, and 117.8 ppm agree with the presence of four nitrile carbons. Additionally, peaks at δ 76.3 and 88.5 ppm were assigned to the two carbons attached directly to the dicyanomethylene group. Finally, the HRMS data acquired in positive ionization mode exhibited a peak at m/z = 581.1672 that unambiguously confirmed the structure of the product.

Photophysical properties
Before initiating our investigation on the photophysical properties, we anticipated that the addition of TCNE to the acetylene unit of 8a–m could contribute to a bathochromic shift of the corresponding chromophores 10a–j. Therefore, we first inspected the optical properties of 8a–m by recording UV-vis absorption spectra in chloroform solutions (4.0 × 10−5 M) and the pertinent parameters are collected (Table 2). As shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†), these compounds exhibit absorption maxima (λmax) varying from 405 to 443 nm ascribed to the π–π* electronic transition of the conjugated molecular backbone. The optical onset (λonset) was located between 464 and 515 nm, which relates to a solution state band gap between 2.67 and 2.40 eV. It is appropriate to mention that compounds 8a–m exhibited strong fluorescence in solution which prompted us to investigate their emissive properties, although it was not the real focus of our study. Towards this end, the photoluminescence of 8a–m was measured in chloroform solution at the same concentration (4 × 10−5 M). An intense blue to green fluorescence with a large Stokes shift was observed (Fig. S4, ESI†). This significant red shift in the emission peak maximum (λem) varying from 481 to 537 nm could be attributed to the facile formation of excited species through strong π–π interactions leading to low-energy emissions. For all these compounds, the fluorescence emission quantum yield (Φ) as calibrated using standard quinine sulphate (Φ = 55%) was found to be in the range of 4.0 to 29.9%.16 Solvatochromism was exerted in the prototype molecule 8a to streamline the strong charge separation in the excited state (S1). To this end, the UV-spectra of 8a obtained in solvents of different polarities displayed only a negligible batho/hypsochromic shift (Fig. 1a), signifying a weak solvent effect in the ground state (S0). In contrast, the fluorescence emission showed a positive solvatochromism with a pronounced Stokes shift (Fig. 1b). This remark indicates the strong dipole relaxation of the solvent molecules around the photoexcited 8a leading to emission at a longer wavelength.17 Moreover, the quantum yield gradually increased with the increase in the molar electronic transition energy (ENT) of the solvents,18 which was ascribed to the increased singlet state character in more polar solvents (Table 3).19 Nonetheless, a comprehensive study of these details is outside the realms of the present work.

With an elementary idea about the optical properties of 8a–8m, we next set out to assess similar properties for chromophores 10a–10j. Henceforth, the UV-vis absorption spectra of 10a–10j were obtained both in chloroform solutions (4.0 × 10−5 M) as well as thin films spincast on quartz plates. As shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†), all compounds in the solution state displayed a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character ranging from 460 to 800 nm, probably due to the electronic transition from the HOMO of TPA to the LUMO of TCBD groups (Table 4). Because of this strong electronic communication between the TPA and TCBD units, a huge bathochromic shift was observed for 10a–10j (λmax from 601 to 610 nm) compared to their respective parent molecules 8a–8m (λmax from 405 to 443 nm). The presence of high energy bands in the visible absorption between 360 and 450 nm could be accredited to the π–π* electronic transition. With the increase in the number of thienyl π-spacer, only a minimal red shift was observed suggesting a limited effect of the increase in π-conjugation. Analysis of the molar absorptivity values revealed that 10c possessing a terthiophene π-spacer exhibited ε = 90500 M−1 cm−1, the highest among the series, because of the extended π-delocalization. Interestingly, compounds with bithiophene (10b, 10f and 10i) as the π-spacer exhibited molar absorptivity less than those containing the monothiophene spacer (10a, 10e and 10h). This behavior can be accredited to the different torsional angle interactions exhibited by bithiophene cores through non-covalent interaction and backbone conjugation with an impact on reduced molar absorptivity.20 Nevertheless, the absorption profile of all compounds in the film state as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†) exhibited broad absorption bands with red-shifted absorption edges (λonset) between 763 and 894 nm (1.62 and 1.38 eV). This could possibly be because of the strong molecular packing and intermolecular interactions of the molecules in the solid state. In other words, the optical band gap (Eoptg) in the film state is ca. 0.11–0.32 eV smaller than that in the solution state suggesting different solid-state aggregations of the molecules. This significantly extended absorption towards a higher wavelength is vital for the enhancement of the spectral overlap with the solar spectrum and should be beneficial for attaining a higher short-circuit current (Jsc) when applied in OPVs.21 Precisely, compound 10c possessing a terthiophene π-spacer demonstrated a reduced band gap of 1.38 eV with a high molar extinction coefficient (ε = 90500 M−1 cm−1) ensuring a good photon harvesting ability for the aforementioned application.

Electrochemical properties and energy levels
To glean information about the redox behavior and HOMO–LUMO energy levels of the frontier orbitals of 10a–10j, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed in acetonitrile (2.0 × 10−3 M) using nBu4ClO4 (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte at room temperature. Glassy carbon and platinum wire were used as the working and counter electrodes, respectively. This electrochemical experiment was referenced with respect to silver wire as the pseudo-reference electrode and then calibrated to a standard ferrocenium/ferrocene redox couple (Fc+/Fc). Under these conditions, the half-wave potential (E1/2(ferrocene)) of Fc+/Fc versus Ag wire was found to be 0.41 V. All compounds exhibited identical CV patterns with one anodic peak potential (Eox1) and two reversible cathodic peak potentials (Ered1 and Ered2) within a potential window of −1.0 and 1.0 V (Fig. S7, ESI†).22 As depicted in Table 1, the first oxidation potential (Eox1) appeared between 0.77 and 0.92 V was correlated with the electron-rich TPA unit.23 A quick look at the electrochemical data validated that an increase in the number of thiophene down-shifts the Eox1 values (10a–10c, 10e & 10f, 10h & 10i), which can be ascribed to the electron-donating nature of thienyl rings. As expected, the Eox1 for the fused thienyl systems was located relatively at higher potentials (10d, 10g and 10j). The HOMO energy levels of all compounds were derived from their respective Eox1 values using the Pommerehne empirical relation, EHOMO = −[(Eox1 − E1/2(ferrocene)) + 4.8] eV.24,25 All compounds exhibit a reversible two-step reduction wave which was ascribed to the one-electron transfer in each step. It is noteworthy to mention that there is a gradual increase in Ered1 values (10a–10c, 10e & 10f, 10h & 10i) for an increase in the number of thienyl π-spacer. The LUMO energy levels were determined from the first reduction potential (Ered1) using the correlation, ELUMO = −[(Ered1 − E1/2(ferrocene)) + 4.8] eV. The electrochemical band gap (ECVg) was determined by the formula, ECVg = ELUMO − EHOMO.26 Although no strict correlation exists between the band gap obtained from the electronic spectra and electrochemical data, they are roughly in good agreement with the same tendency. Based on these calculations, an energy band diagram was constructed by comparing the HOMO–LUMO energy levels of 10a–10j with standard p-type (P3HT) and n-type (PCBM) materials used in organic solar cell applications (Fig. S9, ESI†).27 Analysis of the frontier molecular orbital energy band diagram clearly revealed that all compounds possess more or less similar HOMO–LUMO levels, signifying that the lateral groups have little influence on the energy levels. The EHOMO of all compounds was placed between −5.16 and −5.31 eV, which is quite close to the frequently used small molecule donor (hole-transporting) materials.28 Indeed, these low-lying HOMO energy levels are essential for attaining a high open-circuit voltage (Voc), which in turn improves the power conversion efficiency (η) of the given OPV device.29 On the other hand, the LUMO energy level positions varying from −4.24 to −3.49 eV imply efficient exciton dissociation at the donor/acceptor interface and enhance the short-circuit current (Jsc) values, had a bulk heterojunction solar cell been constructed using standard n-type materials (Table 5).30

Thermal analysis
To understand the thermal stability of the chromophores (10a–j), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out at a heating rate of 5 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. S10, ESI†). The temperature of decomposition (Td) for 5% weight loss for all chromophores varied from 305 to 146 °C, with the highest for 10a and the lowest for 10f (Table 6). The trend in thermal stability follows the order 10a > 10c > 10j > 10d > 10b > 10i > 10g > 10e > 10h > 10f with indication of no strict correlation between the chemical structure and thermal stability. The phase behavior of the series of 10a–10j molecules was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and the results are summarized in (Fig. S11, ESI†). The endothermicity of 10a–10j observed between 175 and 244 °C was attributed to the melting temperature (Tm). It is noteworthy to mention that compounds 10a, 10e and 10g did not reveal any significant melting temperature. Whereas, all compounds displayed a clear exothermic peak ranging from 300 to 330 °C that was assigned to the crystallization temperature (Tc) of 10a–10j.

Theoretical studies
The information regarding the effect of TCBD acceptors on the molecular structure and electronic properties of chromophores 10a to 10j was gathered by semi-empirical calculations.31 The Cartesian coordinates and HOMO–LUMO contours of the optimized structures are shown in Tables S1 and S2, respectively (ESI†). As expected for D–π-A push–pull systems, the HOMO is significantly contributed by the electron-rich TPA donors and the thienyl portion of 10a–10j. On the other hand, the LUMO orbitals of all chromophores are essentially located at the electron-deficient TCBD unit. This observation corroborated the low optical band gap and red shift in the electronic spectrum. Since the TCBD unit inherently possesses a distorted geometry,5,6 analysis of the dihedral angle between the two dicyanovinyl groups (C(CN)2) of all the optimized structures becomes meaningful. The dihedral angle between the planes having the two C(CN)2 groups was determined using Gaussview. The energy-minimized structures displayed a dihedral angle between 78.8° and 88.7°, with the lowest and highest being for 10d and 10j, respectively (Table S3, ESI†). These results confirmed that the two C(CN)2 groups are orthogonal to each other, and thus would restrict the π-electron delocalization in the TCBD core. However, the lateral groups attached to the TCBD group were found to be in planar alignment with the central thienyl π-spacer.
OPV device fabrication
In order to assess the photovoltaic properties of the semiconducting materials 10a–j, a preliminary device fabrication was attempted. Towards this end, solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photovoltaic cells were fabricated by spin-casting films of 10a–j on ITO plates. The active layer consisting of 10a–j and PCBM in a blend ratio of 1:1 was prepared from o-dichlorobenzene solution. An inverted device configuration of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/V2O5/Ag was constructed and used in the present study (Fig. 2a).32 Simulated solar illumination under AM 1.5 conditions at 100 mW cm−2 was used to measure the power conversion efficiencies (η) of the fabricated cells (Fig. 2b). The best performance of each material (10a–10j) on a batch of four identical devices is shown in Table 7.

Analysis of the photovoltaic performance revealed that all cells exhibited a similar FF ranging from 0.36 to 0.60. Significant JSC values between 5.6 and 11.1 mA cm−2 were reached on account of the broadened red shift in the absorption spectrum. Despite exhibiting favourable EHOMO values, all materials displayed only a moderate Voc (0.51 to 0.63 V), which could be rationalized by the poor film quality and limited charge transport by the distorted TCBD units. Nonetheless, all materials displayed noteworthy efficiencies ranging from 1.95 to 3.33%. In this work, three materials (10c, 10g and 10j) exhibited efficiencies greater than 3%. In particular, 10c showed superior performance by resulting in a η of 3.33% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc), current density (Jsc) and fill-factor (FF) of 0.61 V, 10.9 mA cm−2 and 0.50, respectively. The better performance of this material could be attributed to the favourable combination of a reduced optical band gap (Eoptg = 1.38 eV), high molar absorptivity (ε = 90500 M−1 cm−1) and low EHOMO level (−5.17 eV). Compounds 10g and 10j having a fused thieno[3,2-b]thiophene core emerged as the second most efficient with a η of 3.22 and 3.10%, respectively. The performance of the other materials investigated led to slightly reduced efficiencies ranging from 1.95 to 2.37%. Nevertheless, these initial findings are highly encouraging for TCBD containing molecular systems, since the TCBD unit was known to be highly distorted from co-planarity and may lead to the breaking of the D–A π-conjugation path with a direct impact on the lowest energy excitation.33,34
A crucial role in improving the power conversion efficiency of BHJ solar cells relies on the surface morphology and thickness of the active layer. Hence, we intended to study the film morphology of the most efficient material 10c using atomic force microscopy (AFM). For AFM studies, a mixture of 10c and PCBM in a blend ratio of 1:1 in o-dichlorobenzene was prepared. This mixture was then spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 1 minute on an etched ITO electrode and annealed at 120 °C for 5 minutes under vacuum. The topographical and phase images of 10c with PCBM before and after thermal annealing in an area of 5 × 5 μM are given in Fig. S12 (ESI†). The pristine films as shown in Fig. S12a† appear to be rough with a root-mean-square roughness (σRMS) of 3.79 nm. The same blend upon thermal treatment resulted in a slightly increased surface smoothness (σRMS = 3.02 nm). This lower coarsening of the morphology (Fig. S12b, ESI†) compared to the as-spun films is an indication of the increased number of interfaces between the donor and acceptor. These findings suggest that annealing is likely to improve the quality of the interface, which in turn should permit an efficient p/n heterojunction for the given organic solar cell. In addition, it has been described that only those D–A chromophores showing centrosymmetric antiparallel dimers afford good efficiencies in organic photovoltaics.35 In fact, theoretical calculations revealed that the optimized geometries of all chromophores exhibit a significant twisting of the two TCBD groups from co-planarity. Looking from these perspectives, the overall performance of our push–pull D–π-A chromophores is reasonably comparable to the efficiencies reported for other low-molecular weight donor materials in recent times.36 Moreover, there is plenty of room to improve the device performance by modulating a range of device fabrication parameters.
Experimental section
Materials, methods and measurements
All commercially available reagents were used without further purification unless otherwise stated. Terminal alkynes, 2-bromo-thienyl aldehydes and tetracyanoethylene were purchased from TCI Chemicals (India) Pvt. Ltd, Japan. The solutions in organic solvents were dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate or magnesium sulphate. The solvents were evaporated under reduced pressure. Column chromatography was performed using thick-walled glass columns along with a mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate on silica gel (100–200 mesh, SRL, India). The relative proportions of solvents in chromatography solvent mixtures refer to the volume to volume ratio. Analytical TLC was performed on precoated plastic sheets of silica gel G/UV-254 of 0.2 mm thickness (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) using analytical grade solvents and visualized with iodine spray (10% w/w I2 in silica gel), UV light (λ = 254 and 365 nm) and alkaline KMnO4 solution. Melting points were recorded on a microcontroller-based melting point apparatus using open capillaries. The infrared (IR) spectra for all solid compounds were recorded on a Bruker Optik GmbH, TENSOR 27 FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellets. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained in acetone-d6 and CDCl3 on a BRUKER spectrometer at 400, 500 and 100, 125 MHz, respectively. Proton chemical shifts (δ) are relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ = 0.00) as the internal standard and expressed in parts per million. The number of protons (n) for a given resonance was indicated as nH. Spin multiplicities are given as s (singlet), d (doublet), t (triplet), q (quartet) and m (multiplet). Coupling constants (J) are given in hertz. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were obtained using a Q-TOF and JEOL-GCMate II mass spectrometer. GC-MS spectra were obtained using a PerkinElmer instrument. UV-Visible spectra for all solution and the thin film phase were recorded in chloroform solution and a thin film on a SHIMADZU UV-3600 plus UV-VIS-NIR spectrometer. Photoluminescence spectra were recorded on a Jasco spectrofluorometer FP-8500. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments were performed with an Autolab potentiostat galvanostat (Model PGSTAT-30). All CV measurements were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration employing a glassy carbon electrode as the working electrode, silver wire as the pseudo-reference electrode and a Pt wire as the counter electrode. Tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (0.1 M) as the supporting electrolyte was used in argon-purged acetonitrile at a scan rate 50 mV s−1. Atomic force microscopy images were captured using 5500 Series, Agilent Technologies. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were carried out on a NETZSCH STA 409PC instrument under a purified nitrogen gas flow at a 5 °C min−1 heating rate. A thermal evaporator with a sputtering unit (model no.: VRSU04D) and thickness monitor (model no.: CTM-200) was used for chemical vapour deposition. The OPV device performance was measured by recording the current voltage characteristics using a potentiostat (Keithley 2400) under illumination from a Solar Simulator (Science-Tech) with an AM 1.5G filter set and an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
General experimental procedure for the synthesis of 7a–7m
1.0 mmol of iodo precursor, 5 mol% of Pd(Ph3P)2Cl2, and 5 mol% of CuI were taken in an oven dried round flask under an argon atmosphere. To this mixture was added 5 mL of triethylamine followed by a slow addition of 1.1 mmol of terminal alkyne and stirred at room temperature for 12 h. Then the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 25 mL) and the combined organic extract was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, concentrated under reduced pressure and subjected to column chromatography on silica gel (100–200 mesh) using 5% ethyl acetate/petroleum ether as the eluent to afford the pure product.
General procedure for the synthesis of 8a–8m
1.1 mmol of N,N-diphenylamino-N-4-(benzyl)triphenylphosphonium bromide was dissolved in 10 mL of DMF and 2.2 mmol of anhydrous potassium carbonate was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 15 min. Then, 2 drops of 18-crown-6 were added and stirring was continued for another 15 min. 1.0 mmol of 7a–7j synthesized from the previous step was added and stirred at room temperature for 2 h. Then the reaction mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 25 mL) and the combined organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford a crude mixture of E/Z isomers. The crude mixture was taken in 15 mL of chloroform and refluxed with 5 mol% of iodine for 8 h to carry out the isomerization. This reaction mixture was quenched with 10% of sodium thiosulphate solution (3 × 25 mL) and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The organic extract was dried over anhydrous MgSO4, concentrated under reduced pressure and subjected to chromatography on silica gel (100–200 mesh) using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether as the eluent to afford the pure product (8a–8m).
General procedure for the synthesis of 10a–10j
1.0 mmol of 8a–8j from the previous step was taken in 10 mL of 1,2-dichloroethane and 1.0 mmol of tetracyanoethylene was added to it and stirred at 60 °C for 6 h. The reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced pressure and subjected to silica gel column chromatography using 20% ethyl acetate/petroleum ether to afford the pure products 10a–10j.
Procedure for OPV device fabrication
An inverted device architecture consisting of ITO/ZnO/10a–10j/PCBM/V2O5/Ag was constructed. An ITO electrode (1.5 × 1.5 cm) was first etched (0.5 × 1.5 cm) with Zn powder and 0.1 M HCl. A sequential cleaning via sonication in pure water, acetone and isopropanol was followed by UV-ozone treatment. A ZnO layer was deposited by spin-coating on the ITO substrate at 3000 rpm for 1 minute. A bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer was prepared from 10a–10j (15 mg) and PCBM (15 mg) in 1,2-dichlorobenzene (1 mL) at a blend ratio of 1:1 under stirring for 5 h. These solutions were then spin-coated on the ZnO surface at 1000 rpm for 1 min and left to stand in air for 30 min. Then, V2O5 at a thickness of ∼5–7 nm was coated over the BHJ surface by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) at 0.1 Å s−1 followed by silver (∼140–160 nm) at 10 Å s−1. All devices were encapsulated in air. The photocurrent of the fabricated devices was measured with a sweeping voltage using a source measurement unit controlled by a computer under simulated solar light (AM 1.5 G; 100 mW cm−2) illumination. The incident light intensity was calibrated to 1 Sun (100 mW cm−2) with a standard silicon photodiode. The current vs. voltage (J–V) characteristics were measured for an area (0.2 × 0.5 cm) of 0.1 cm2.
Conclusions
In summary, the synthesis of new π-conjugated small donor–acceptor push–pull chromophores (10 examples) in good to excellent chemical yields was disclosed. These unprecedented chromophores demonstrate a very low band gap (1.38–1.62 eV) coupled with favourable HOMO (−5.31 to −5.16 eV) and LUMO (−3.49 to −4.31 eV) energy levels that makes them attractive candidates as semiconducting materials in organic photovoltaics. To delineate the scope of the synthesized chromophores as active layer materials, an inverse photovoltaic device of ITO/ZnO/BHJ/V2O5/Ag configuration was constructed, which resulted in an efficiency ranging from 1.95 to 3.33%. We are currently engaged in the optimization study to enhance the device performance as well as to investigate other optoelectronic applications.

When the potential window was set up to 2.0 V, a second oxidation wave (Eox2) seen in the range of 1.00–1.30 V probably originating from the oxidation of the thienyl bridge was observed. Under these conditions, only two irreversible anodic potentials (Eox1 and Eox2) and no significant reduction potential were observed. The quasi-reversibility in these redox processes can be due to to the further complex reactions spurred by electron transfer (Fig. S8, ESI†).
