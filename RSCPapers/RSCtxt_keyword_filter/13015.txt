    , Accepted 29th October 2018First published on 30th October 2018AbstractIn this work, a non-fullerene acceptor molecule (ITIC-FOR) based on heptacyclic (indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene) IDTT as the core with F-phenylalkoxy (FOR) as a side chain was designed and synthesized. The photovoltaic properties of the HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR based non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs) were explored. By device optimization, a good power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.33% was obtained.
1 Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have drawn great attention owing to their advantages, such as simple processing, light-weight, low cost and mechanical flexibility.1–7 Among them, in terms of improving PSC performance, fullerene acceptors have played a key role; in particular, PSCs based on a [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) acceptor material and suitable polymer donor materials have obtained power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 11% in lab-scale single junction bulk heterojunction (BHJ) PSCs.8 However, fullerene and its derivatives have some disadvantages, such as a metastable morphology of the blended films, weak absorption, and a difficult to modify structure.9 Therefore, researchers have been paying more attention to non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) as a substitute.4,10–13 In recent years, the performance of NF-PSCs has developed rapidly due to their simple synthesis, fine-tuned absorption spectra and energy levels and low cost preparation. Several small molecule non-fullerene acceptors (SMNFAs) of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A)-type have been reported and the PCEs of the NF-PSCs were comparable or higher than those of the PSCs based on fullerene acceptors.14–19 Among the known SMNFAs, IEIC based on indacenodithiophene (IDT) or ITIC20 based on indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) has been developed as a central core in the NFAs due to their good light absorption, excellent transport ability, large planar π-conjugated structure, and good intermixing ability with the polymer donors.16,21–24 Particularly, the PCEs of PSCs with ITIC-based NFAs have already exceeded 13%.25 On the basis of an IDT electron-rich unit, a NF-acceptor IEIC blended with PTB7-Th was reported, and the device obtained a PCE of 6.31%.24,26 Our group reported a series of acceptors (e.g. m-ITIC-OR and ITTC), which showed good performances; PSCs based on ITTC or m-ITIC-OR blended with HFQx-T displayed a PCE of 10.4% and a PCE of 9.13%, respectively.27,28
Several strategies have been employed to modify the structure of small molecule acceptors (SMAs) in order to effectively control the molecular packing and fine-tune the frontier orbital energy levels to further enhance the PCE, such as changing the side chains,29,30 the extension of π-conjugation length,31–33 the substitution of end groups and the introduction of a F atom.25,31,34 For example, three NFAs, ITIC,35 ITIC-Th,29 and ITIC-Th1, with INCN, have been reported; the alteration of the side chains improves intermolecular interactions, which effectively tuned π-stacking and charge transport.36–38 In addition, substituting the end groups to improve the intermolecular interactions is also an effective strategy to optimize the device performance.39,40
In this work, ITIC-FOR with F-phenylalkoxy as a side-chain (Fig. 1) was synthesized and characterized. Fluorination is an effective strategy for improving optoelectronic properties, and thereby optimizing the device performance.41,42 Firstly, the F atom has some advantages, such as low polarizability, small radius, and high electronegativity. Secondly, fluorination can simultaneously lower the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels.43 Thirdly, owing to the influence of the intermolecular non-covalent interactions of F⋯π, F⋯S, and F⋯H, fluorinated materials have stronger inter/intramolecular interactions. These features are beneficial for charge mobility. In addition, fluorinated molecules have higher absorption coefficients than non-fluorinated molecules.44 Our group reported a polymer donor, HFQx-T (Fig. 2A), which demonstrated strong and broad absorptions in the UV-vis region from 300 to 800 nm and appropriate energy levels for application as a donor in PSCs.45 Therefore, we chose HFQx-T as the donor in the ITIC-FOR-based NF-PSCs.

2 Results and discussion
2.1 Materials synthesis
All reagents were obtained from commercial companies. Sensitive reactions were done under Ar. Compound 1 was distannylated and Stille coupled with 25-dibromo terephthalic ethyl ester to synthesize compound 2. Then, 3-(octyloxy)-1-bromobenzene was lithiated and reacted with compound 2 to obtain compound 3. Compound 4 was synthesized by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction. ITIC-FOR was synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation. The synthetic route of ITIC-FOR is shown in Fig. 1. 1-Bromo-3-fluoro-4-hexyloxybenzene was synthesized according to a previous literature report.46 All intermediates were characterized by NMR (Fig. S2–S6, ESI†). Fig. S5–S7 (ESI†) show the 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS spectra of ITTC-FOR.
2.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of ITIC-FOR in chloroform (CF) solution and in the blend film are shown in Fig. 2B, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table 1. ITIC-FOR shows a maximum absorption peak at 662 nm in solution and at 692 nm in the film. Thus, ITIC-FOR exhibits a red-shift of 30 nm from its solution to solid state, indicating that there is stronger aggregation between molecules in the film state. Correspondingly, the absorption onset of ITIC-FOR is also slightly red-shifted, resulting in an optical bandgap of 1.62 eV for ITIC-FOR, according to the absorption edge of the thin film (765 nm): Eoptg = 1240/λedge.26,47 The absorption coefficients of ITIC-FOR (film) are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The peak absorption coefficient reached 1.18 × 105 cm−1.

The electronic energy levels of ITIC-FOR were investigated using cyclic voltammetry (Fig. 2C). ITIC-FOR shows a reversible reduction and oxidation process. The energy levels of the HOMO (EHOMO) and LUMO (ELUMO) were obtained according to the initial oxidation potential (1.25 V) and the initial reduction potential (−0.39 V) by cyclic voltammetry, respectively. The EHOMO and ELUMO of ITIC-FOR are −5.6 eV and −3.96 eV, respectively. The medium bandgap donor HFQx-T was selected as the donor to be blended with the ITIC-FOR acceptor to fabricate NF-PSCs. The EHOMO and ELUMO of HFQx-T are −5.45 eV and −3.50 eV, respectively. The ΔE(LUMO) is 0.46 eV, calculated using ΔE(LUMO) = D(LUMO) − A(LUMO),48 showing efficient electron transfer at the interface. The ΔE(HOMO) is only 0.15 eV, calculated using ΔE(HOMO) = D(HOMO) − A(HOMO), however, studies have proved that non-fullerene systems can still have efficient exciton separation if the ΔE(HOMO) is less than the empirical value, which is 0.3 eV. The energy diagram relative to the vacuum level is shown in Fig. 2D. Corresponding optical and electrochemical data are listed in Table 1.
2.3 Photovoltaic properties
In order to study the photovoltaic properties of ITIC-FOR, we fabricated a NF-PSC based on a HFQx-T donor and ITIC-FOR acceptor, with a conventional device architecture, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PDINO/Al, where PDINO acts as the cathode buffer layer material,49 and HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR acts as the active layer.34,50 The device was optimized by screening the D/A weight ratios and changing the thermal annealing temperature. Fig. 3A shows the current density–voltage curves (J–V) of the PSCs based on HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR (w/w, 1:1.5) without and with thermal annealing (TA) at 120 °C, under the illumination of AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2, and the detailed photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 2. Firstly, we explored the photovoltaic performance of HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR (1:1, w/w) without any post-treatment, and a PCE of 6.13% was obtained; then, the D/A ratio was changed to 1:1.5, and although Jsc showed a slight decrease, both Voc and FF increased, and a PCE of 6.42% was obtained. Finally, when the D/A ratio was changed to 1.5:1, each photovoltaic parameter decreased. As a result, a PCE of 4.04% was obtained. However, the photovoltaic performance of a device is not only related to the optical properties of the D/A material, but it is also related to the morphology of the device. The morphology of the active layer was optimized by changing the TA temperature. In light of the optimal D/A ratio (1:1.5), the device without TA demonstrated a PCE of 6.42%, and when the TA temperature increased to 100 °C, the FF showed a slight increase and a PCE of 7.06% was achieved. When the TA temperature was increased to 120 °C, the Jsc and FF showed a moderate enhancement, and a PCE of 7.33% was obtained, with a Voc of 0.88 V, Jsc of 13.47 mA cm−2 and FF of 62%. As a whole, the Jsc and FF of the device with TA indicated a clear ascending trend compared with those without TA.

The HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR-based device (w/w, 1:1.5) with TA exhibited a higher external quantum efficiency (EQE) value, while the devices without TA showed relatively lower EQE values (Fig. 3B). The HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR-based device with TA exhibited a good photoresponse in the 300–800 nm region, which is consistent with the UV-vis absorption spectra (Fig. 2A). For the HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR device with TA, the EQE value is below 55% at 300–550 nm, whereas it is above 60% with a maximum value of 65% in the region of 570–720 nm, showing an effective photoelectron conversion process in the TA-treated device. The Jsc value calculated using the EQE curve and the Jsc value obtained from the J–V curve are within 10% of each other, showing that the photovoltaic parameters measured by using the J–V curve are reliable.51
The hole/electron mobility has a great effect on Jsc and FF. The charge transfer characteristics of the HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR blend film were measured before and after annealing by using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. The J1/2–V curves are shown in Fig. 4. The electron and hole mobilities were investigated by studying the electron-only and hole-only devices of ITO/ZnO/HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR/Al and ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR/Au, respectively. The electron and hole mobilities of the device without TA are 4.54 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 6.02 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. After TA at 120 °C for 10 min, the electron and hole mobilities of the device increased to 7.51 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 8.65 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The higher mobilities promote photogenerated carrier transfer and transport in the device with TA.52 Detailed parameters are shown in Table 3.

In order to study the effective charge separation and collection properties of the NF-PSCs with ITIC-FOR as acceptor, we explored the change of the photocurrent as a function of the effective voltage of the device, see Fig. 5. The effective voltage (Veff) is calculated by Veff = V0 − Vappl, where V0 is the voltage at which the photocurrent density Jph is zero, and Vappl is the bias voltage applied to the device. The photocurrent density (Jph) is calculated by Jph = JL − JD, where JL is the photocurrent density under illumination and JD is the photocurrent density under dark conditions.53,54 When Veff is higher than 2 V, Jph reaches saturation current (Jsat), indicating that charge recombination is minimized at the higher voltage due to the high internal electric field in the devices. The value of Jph/Jsat is defined as the exciton separation and charge collection rate. The ratio of Jph/Jsat for HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR without and with TA was calculated to be 0.874 and 0.944, respectively, indicating that the device with TA treatment exhibits good exciton dissociation and good charge collection compared with that without TA.

2.4 Morphology analysis
The morphology of the HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR (w/w, 1:1.5) blend film without and with TA was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Fig. 6 shows the height and phase images. As shown in Fig. 6, the blend film of HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR with TA exhibited different morphologies in comparison with that without TA. A root-mean-square-roughness (RMS) of 2.94 nm was found for the HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR blend film, whereas after TA at 120 °C for 10 min, the RMS of the blend film was reduced to 2.27 nm. The blend film with TA shows a uniform surface morphology with a reasonably small RMS, indicating good intermixing between HFQx-T and ITIC-FOR.55 This benefits charge transport. Therefore, with TA, the HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR blend film shows a higher FF than that without TA. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 7) was also carried out to investigate the HFQx-T:ITIC-FOR blend film morphology. Compared with the blend film without TA, a well-defined phase separation of HFQx-T and ITIC-FOR with an interpenetrating network was observed in that with TA. This benefits charge carrier generation and extraction, and thus leads to a good Jsc.56

3 Conclusions
In summary, a non-fullerene acceptor with acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) molecular structure (ITIC-FOR), based on a heptacyclic(indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene) IDTT unit with F-phenylalkoxy (FOR) as a side chain and 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (IC) as an end-group, was synthesized and characterized. ITIC-FOR exhibits excellent solubility in common organic solvents, improved film-forming properties and thermal stability. ITIC-FOR shows an optical bandgap of 1.62 eV, and broad and strong absorption coverage from 500 to 770 nm in the film state. We obtained a PCE of 7.33% for the device with HFQx-T as the polymer donor and ITIC-FOR as the NFA by optimizing the device such as choosing a proper D/A ratio and thermal annealing temperature. We firmly believe that the photovoltaic performance can be improved by combining different donor polymers with ITIC-FOR.
