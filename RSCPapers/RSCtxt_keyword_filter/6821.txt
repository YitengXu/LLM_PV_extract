    , Accepted 29th June 2018First published on 3rd July 2018AbstractVarious amino benzothiadiazoles (Am-BTDs) are synthesized and their photophysical properties in different states (solution, film, crystal, and powder) are investigated. Unusual anti-Kasha's emission is observed for those compounds with a strong electronic coupling effect between the donor and the acceptor which directly results in the white emission of those compounds in dilute solutions. Among these Am-BTDs, some of them can be utilized as fluorescent chemosensors in sensing gaseous ammonia, and some of them can be developed for detecting fluoride anions with high selectivity and high sensitivity. Moreover, aggregation caused quenching is not observed for these compounds in the solid state. They are emissive in films, crystals and powders with high color purity and moderate efficiencies. The emission color could be tuned from yellow to red according to the varying amino groups. Furthermore, they can be used as an emissive layer in organic light emitting diodes.
Introduction
2,1,3-Benzothiadiazole (BTD) is a unique electron deficient heterocycle which has been widely applied as a building block in the synthesis of optoelectronic compounds for organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs),1 organic field effect transistors (OFETs),2 solution-processable bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs),3 organic flow batteries,4 solar–hydrogen conversion,5 bioprobes,6 and fluoride anion chemsensors.7 Connection of BTD with AIE-fluorogen (aggregation induced emission active fluorogen) induces these BTD-based compounds to emit light in aggregates for long-term two-photon cell imaging.8 Generally speaking, π-extended BTD derivatives facilitate planarization and polarization which enhance the electronic communication between the electron donor and the electron acceptor and simultaneously increase the intermolecular interactions and afford well-ordered crystal structures for better device performance.2a,9 Meanwhile, most of the BTD-based compounds are stable in both the ground state and the excited state even after a long period of irradiation.6a Therefore, the discovery of new BTD-based compounds in order to fit the requirement of the steady development of materials science and life science has always been the focus of research. By surveying the literature, the conjugation normally extends from the 4,7-positions of BTD by covalently bonding alkenyl,10 alkynyl,11 and aryl.1,12 For example, upon insertion of BTD into a polyfluorene backbone, a pure green emitter was obtained.12c On the other hand, modification of the BTD core by installing electron-withdrawing fluoro or cyano at the 5- or 6-position of BTD could further lower its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level and thereafter increase its electron affinity for red-shifted absorption.13,14 Apart from fluorination and cyanation, borylation could also lower its LUMO level and enhance its electron affinity.15 On the other hand, substitution at the 5- or 6-position of BTD with the electron-donating alkoxy group changes it into a transmitter by improving its electron mobility.16
However, direct substitution at the 4,7-positions with amino groups is seldom reported although this kind of modification would dramatically change its energy level to a great extent and has been demonstrated for some particular purposes (Scheme 1). For instance, by covalently bonding 2-aminopyridine to the 4-position of BTD, BTD-AP possesses dual functions of excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) and has been applied as a mitochondrial fluorescent marker with high selectivity and stability.6b,17 By attaching a p-nitrophenylamino group at the 4-position of BTD, CBT-NH shows selectivity and sensitivity to fluoride anions and works as a fluoride fluorescent chemosensor.7 By incorporating diarylamino, MR-3 was designed for dye-sensitized solar cells with an apparent increase of the power conversion efficiency.12c Recently, BTZ-DMAC and others, with two diarylamino groups at the 4,7-positions of BTD, have been designed as red TADF-emitters (thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters) with electroluminescence at 636 nm and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 8.8%.18 Here, we would like to report the synthesis of a series of amino benzothiadiazoles (Am-BTDs, 1–7), the investigation of the amino effect on their photophysical properties in different states, and the utilization of these compounds in fluorescent sensors and materials sciences.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of Am-BTDs (1–7)
The synthetic route to Am-BTDs (1–7) is shown in Scheme 2. A sequence of Suzuki coupling and Buchwald–Hartwig cross-coupling was applied to prepare Am-BTDs (1–7). The synthesized compounds could be classified into three categories according to their amino groups, including aliphatic primary amines (1 and 2), aromatic primary amines (3, 4, and 5), and aromatic secondary amines (6 and 7). The structures of compounds 1–7 were characterized using 1H NMR, 13C NMR (Fig. S1–S14, ESI†), IR, HRMS, and single crystal analysis. All compounds were stable to 276 °C according to thermogravimetric analysis (Fig. S15, ESI†). Their decomposition temperatures varied from 276 °C to 355 °C, depending on the amino group (Table 1).

NMR spectra of Am-BTDs (1–7) in CDCl3
The electron donating ability of the various amino groups could be described by the chemical shift of Ha in 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole as illustrated in Fig. 1. The chemical shift of Ha in compounds 1–7 is found to be 6.49, 6.87, 7.27, 6.97, 7.55, 7.28, and 6.99, respectively. The smaller the chemical shift is, the greater the shielding of this nucleus is. Upon aliphatic amine substitution, Ha in compounds 1 and 2 are highly shielded in comparison with the ones in aromatic amine substituted compounds 3–7. The best p–π conjugation between a lone pair electron of nitrogen and the BTD core is seen in compound 1. On the other hand, the chemical shift of Hc could be used to refer to the relative acidity of N–H in compounds 1–5. The larger the chemical shift is, the stronger the acidity of N–H presents. Thus, compound 5 presents the strongest acidity among compounds 1–5 due to the electron withdrawing nature of the cyano group. Acidities of N–H in compounds 3–5 are much stronger than those in compounds 1 and 2 because of the better delocalization of these conjugated bases. Moreover, it is clear that chemical shifts of Ha and Hb in compounds 3 (7.27 and 7.68 ppm) and 6 (7.28 and 7.76 ppm) are almost identical. A similar situation is observed for compounds 4 and 7. This indicates that the electronic effect on the replacement of the monoarylamino group with the diarylamino group is almost the same no matter how many aryl groups are tethered.

Crystal data of Am-BTDs (1–7)
Fortunately, single crystals of compounds 1–7 were obtained after slow evaporation of their corresponding dilute solutions. Crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The selected dihedral angles and bond distances are indicated in Fig. 2. In good accordance with 1H NMR findings, C–N bond lengths of compounds 1 and 2 are relatively shorter than those of others. It was found to be 1.366 Å and 1.369 Å for compounds 1 and 2 respectively. This implies that the C–N bond in compounds 1 and 2 has a partial double bond character because of the strong electron donating nature of the nitrogen in aliphatic amines. Meanwhile, the conjugation between para-methoxyphenyl (PMP) and BTD is better in compounds 1 and 2 than those in others, indicated by the dihedral angles between PMP and BTD as well as the C–C bond lengths between PMP and BTD. Thus, combining with those findings from 1H NMR, it could be concluded that intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) apparently exists in compounds 1 and 2 no matter whether the state is solution (NMR analysis) or solid (X-ray analysis). However, in the series of compounds 3, 4, and 5, relatively longer C–N bond lengths are observed, especially in the case of compound 5 because of the electron-withdrawing nature of the cyano group. Moreover, a more twisted PMP is seen in compounds 3, 4, and 5 on the basis of the dihedral angles and C–C bond lengths between PMP and BTD. This implies that the electronic communication between the donor and the acceptor in these D–A–D molecules (3, 4, and 5) is weakened which makes these compounds have multiple conformers. In compounds 6 and 7, the three arenes swing around the nitrogen and exist in a propeller structure. The C–N bond length is determined to be 1.413 Å and 1.410 Å, while the distance between PMP and BTD is determined to be 1.474 Å and 1.477 Å for compounds 6 and 7, respectively.

Absorption of Am-BTDs (1–7) in dilute solutions
At the beginning, we measured the absorption spectra of compounds 1–7 in non-polar toluene solutions at a concentration of 2 × 10−5 M (Fig. S16 ESI† and Table 1). Upon aliphatic amine substitution, compounds 1 and 2 absorb light at 471 nm and 477 nm with molar absorptovities of 6.38 × 103 and 6.43 × 103, respectively (Fig. 3a and Fig. S16a, ESI†). Upon aniline substitution, compound 3 absorbs light at 475 nm with an increased molar absorptivity of 9.61 × 103. Addition of a methoxy or cyano group at the para-position of aniline tunes the energy level as we expected. Thus, red-shifted absorption is observed for compound 4, while blue-shifted absorption is seen for compound 5 (Fig. S16b, ESI†). With the addition of one more phenyl or p-methoxyphenyl group, further red-shifted absorption is observed. Thus, compounds 6 and 7 absorb light at 479 nm and 502 nm, respectively (Fig. S16c, ESI†). When the absorption spectra were recorded in a polar solvent, such as acetonitrile, all compounds presented blue-shifted absorptions with decreased molar absorptivities, respectively (Fig. 3b, Fig. S16d–f ESI† and Table 1).

In compounds 1–7, BTD works as the electron acceptor, while p-methoxyphenyl and amino groups function as electron donors. When these D–A–D compounds were dissolved in polar solvents, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels in ground states decreased simultaneously because of the solvation. In more polar solvents, a larger transition energy gap is observed because of the greater stabilization of the HOMO level.19
Emissions of Am-BTDs (1–7) in dilute solutions
Emission spectra of compounds 1–7 in dilute toluene solutions are recorded at a concentration of 2 × 10−5 M, excited at the corresponding maximum absorption wavelengths (Table 1). Compound 1 emits light at 595 nm with a Stokes shift of 124 nm and a quantum yield of 2.5% (Fig. 3a). Emission of compound 2 in toluene is almost identical to that of compound 1 (Fig. S16a, ESI†). In these cases, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the aliphatic amine to the BTD core occurs in the excited state and makes the large Stokes shift possible. Upon aniline substitution, which eventually reduces the electron-donating ability of the nitrogen via p–π conjugation between the lone pair electrons of nitrogen and benzene, compound 3 emits light at 582 nm with a Stokes shift of 107 nm and a quantum yield of 12.7%. Upon p-methoxyphenyl (PMP) substitution, emission of compound 4 is red-shifted with a larger Stokes shift (117 nm) and a lower quantum yield (10.6%) in comparison with that of compound 3. In contrast, in the case of cyano substitution, compound 5 emits light at 569 nm with a quantum yield of 30% (Fig. S16b, ESI†). Upon introduction of one more phenyl group, compound 6 emits light at 575 nm with the smallest Stokes shift (96 nm) and the largest quantum yield (61.0%) in this family. This might be ascribed to the propeller shape of triphenylamine (TPA) and thus the partially inhibited ICT. Compound 7 emits light at the longest wavelength (630 nm), but with a much lower quantum yield (4.1%) (Fig. S16c, ESI†). In general, the larger the Stokes shift is, the lower the quantum yield.20 Emissions of compounds 1–6 in dilute acetonitrile are all red-shifted compared to those in toluene (Fig. 3b and Fig. S16d–f, ESI†). In the excited state, the polar solvent tends to stabilize the LUMO level and decrease the energy gap. As a result, these compounds present large Stokes shifts in acetonitrile (133–154 nm) but with significantly decreased quantum yields. Some of them present weak luminescence in polar solvent and their emission efficiencies are too weak to be detected, such as compounds 1, 2, and 4. As an extreme example, compound 7 is non-fluorescent in acetonitrile.
Excitation dependent emission (EDE)
Excitation dependent emissions are observed (Fig. 3 and Fig. S17, ESI†). For compound 1, two distinguishable emissive peaks are recorded in toluene as well as in acetonitrile as the excitation wavelength changes. In toluene, as the excitation wavelength changes from 380 nm to 440 nm, the emission intensity at a shorter wavelength (483 nm) gradually decreases while the emission intensity at a longer wavelength (595 nm) increases (Fig. 3c). The emissive color change could be seen by naked eye (Fig. 3h). It is worth noting that a bright white emission is recorded when this dilute toluene solution is excited at 400 nm. In acetonitrile, these two emissive bands (547 nm and 623 nm) still exist as the excitation wavelength changes from 380 nm to 440 nm (Fig. 3d). A similar situation is observed for compound 2 (Fig. S17a and S17A, ESI†). For compound 3, only one emissive band at a lower energy gap (582 nm) is seen in toluene as the excitation wavelength changes from 360 nm to 420 nm. In this case, the emission peak is not shifted, but there is a gradual increase of emission intensity (Fig. S17b, ESI†). In acetonitrile, the two emissive bands (545 nm and 611 nm) come back (Fig. S17B, ESI†). This phenomenon is reproducible in the case of compound 4 (Fig. S17c and S17C, ESI†). For compound 5, one emissive peak (569 nm) is recorded with tunable emission intensities as the excitation wavelength changes (Fig. S17d, ESI†). However, a gradually red-shifted emission, accompanied by a decrease of emission intensity, is observed as the excitation wavelength changes from 380 nm to 440 nm (Fig. S17D, ESI†). When compound 6 is examined, only one emissive peak is recorded either in toluene or in acetonitrile (Fig. S17e and S17E, ESI†). The emission spectrum of compound 7 in toluene depends upon the excitation wavelength with the appearance of two changeable emissive peaks (Fig. S17f, ESI†). However, emission in acetonitrile is too weak to be detectable. Moreover, emission quantum yields of compounds 1, 2, and 7 in dilute toluene solutions are closely related to their excitation wavelengths. For instance, when compound 1 is excited at 380 nm, 400 nm, 420 nm, and 440 nm, emission quantum yield is determined to be 9.0%, 2.5%, 1.2%, and 0.6%, respectively. Similar results are observed for compounds 2 and 7 (Table S2, ESI†).
These dual emissions are quite unusual and intriguing in comparison with the normally observed two emission bands from D–A compounds. For a common D–A compound, dual emission bands originate from the locally excited emission (SLE1 emission) and intramolecular charge transfer emission (SICT1 emission) due to the conformational change in the excited state which should be independent of the excitation wavelength.21 In order to understand the origin of these dual emissions, we firstly measured the purity of the sample in order to avoid the incorrect assessment which may result from the impurity.22 For all the compounds we investigated, the purity is guaranteed good enough for the photophysical study on the basis of HPLC analysis (Fig. S18, ESI†). Secondly, we recorded excitation spectra for each of the two emission bands (Fig. 3 and Fig. S19, ESI†). For a typical D–A compound, the SICT1 state could not be directly excited, and it is populated via the SLE1 state. Thus, their excitation spectra monitored at two emission bands should be similar and match with its absorption.23 However, for compound 1, both the excitation spectra show a distinguishable band when monitored either at a longer wavelength (595 nm) or at a shorter wavelength (483 nm) in toluene (Fig. 3e). When the excitation spectra are recorded in acetonitrile, two bands are observed in the excitation spectrum when monitored at 623 nm, while only one band exists in the excitation spectrum when monitored at 547 nm (Fig. 3f). A similar situation is recorded for compound 2 (Fig. S19a and S19A, ESI†). In the case of compound 5 in acetonitrile, a very broad excitation peak is recorded which is in accordance with the excitation-dependent red-shifted emission (Fig. S19D and S17D, ESI†). On the basis of the measurement of the excitation dependent emission and their corresponding excitation spectra, it could be preliminarily concluded that the two emissive bands could be respectively excited and the lower energy state is not populated from the higher energy state.
Then we move to the measurement of the lifetimes of these dual emissions (Fig. 3g, Fig. S20, and Table S2, ESI†). Fig. 3g presents the fluorescence decay traces of compound 1 in toluene recorded during emission at 483 nm and 595 nm, respectively, corresponding to the dual emissions in Fig. 3c. Both decay traces are bi-exponential with lifetime components of 1.32 ns (66.32%) and 10.96 ns (33.36%) for an emission band at 483 nm, 1.65 ns (90.83%) and 4.85 ns (9.17%) for an emission band at 595 nm. For compound 1 in acetonitrile, emission is too weak for the lifetime measurement. For compound 3 in toluene, one emission band at 582 nm (Fig. S17b, ESI†) fits the single exponential function with fluorescence lifetime of 4.01 ns. Meanwhile, the two emission bands (Fig. S17B, ESI†) fit the bi-exponential function with lifetimes of 1.11 ns (14.81%) and 12.67 ns (85.19%) for an emission at 545 nm, and 0.94 ns (93.11%) and 5.50 ns (6.89%) for an emission at 611 nm, respectively. For compound 5 in toluene, an emission at 569 nm fits the single exponential function with a lifetime of 6.84 ns, while two components are recorded for compound 5 in acetonitrile with lifetimes of 2.11 ns (52.98%) and 12.38 ns (47.02%), respectively (Fig. S17D, ESI†). For compound 6, a single emission peak is seen in toluene (575 nm) and in acetonitrile (611 nm) (Fig. S17e and S17E, ESI†). Both of them fit the single-exponential function with lifetimes of 15.26 ns and 6.80 ns, respectively. Finally, it could be concluded that the emission at a higher energy gap presents a longer lifetime than the emission at a lower energy gap.
On the basis of the above observations, it is clear that compounds 1–7 present excitation dependent emission (EDE) and could be classified into three categories: (a) dual emissions with variable emission intensities (1–4, 7), (b) single emission with variable emission intensity (6), and (c) gradually red-shifted emission (5). These phenomena eventually break the Kasha–Vavilov rule, which states that polyatomic molecules generally luminesce with appreciable yield only from the lowest excited state of a given multiplicity, irrespective of the initial photoexcited state.23,24 Emission at a longer wavelength could be ascribed to S1 → S0 decay as the usual D–A molecules present ICT emission, while emission at a shorter wavelength could be ascribed to S2 → S0 decay.25 The variable quantum yield as a function of excitation wavelength further proves the anti-Kasha behavior (Table S2, ESI†).26
For a typical fluorescent molecule, internal conversion (IC) and vibration relaxation (VR) are faster than radiative and other non-radiative decays (Scheme 3). Thus, population in the S1 state occurs which finally results in the emission from the S1 state. In the cases of compounds 1 and 2, dual emissions are seen in both toluene and acetonitrile because of the strongest electron-donating ability of aliphatic amines which leads to the most charge transfer and the most planarization of the molecules among these compounds. As a result, vibrational relaxation (VR) and internal conversion (IC) from S2 → S1 are effectively inhibited in these rigid molecules and the emissions from the S2 state come into being. For compounds 3 and 4 in toluene, emissions from the S2 state are effectively inhibited because of the extended conjugation of aryl amine which reduces the electron donating ability of nitrogen to the BTD core. However, in acetonitrile, the intramolecular charge transfer is enhanced via acetonitrile solvation. Thus, emission from the S2 state comes back. For compound 5, it is actually a D–A–D–A system. Addition of a cyano group makes the conformation in excited states more complicated. The resulting multiple conformers bring about red-shifted emissions in acetonitrile as the excitation wavelength changes. In comparison with compound 3, compound 6 presents single emission in either toluene or acetonitrile because of the propeller structure of triarylamine and the disappearance of the rigid structure. In other words, for these compounds, the appearance of the anti-Kasha emission depends on the conformation. A rigid conformation tends to present the anti-Kasha emission because of the inhibited vibrational relaxation (VR) and internal conversion (IC).

Emissions of Am-BTDs (1–7) in solids and in frozen states
Compounds 1–7 are all emissive in powders and in crystals (Table 1 and Fig. S21, ESI†).27 Emissions in crystals are all red-shifted in comparison with the emissions in powders as we can see from the emission spectra (Fig. S21, ESI†) and the photos under UV light (Fig. 4). The largest red-shifted emission (29 nm) from powder to crystal is observed for compound 3.

Emissions of compound 2 are red-shifted in comparison with those of compound 1 in powder and in crystal. It could be explained by the different molecular packing modes in the single crystal (Fig. 5). For compound 1, two molecules vertically align anti-parallel, driven by π–π stacking (3.390 Å) between two individual BTD cores (Fig. 5a). Meanwhile, two molecules horizontally align anti-parallel, driven by the short contact between the oxygen of methoxy and the sulfur of BTD (3.125 Å) and multiple C–H⋯π interactions (2.353 Å, 2.873 Å, 2.832 Å, and 2.886 Å). For compound 2, because of the ball structure of amantadine, the π–π interaction between the adjacent two BTD rings is effectively inhibited, with a parallel but translational alignment of two molecules (Fig. 5b). The main intramolecular interaction is the electrostatic force arising from C–H of benzene in PMP and π electron circulation of BTD. The distance of this CH⋯π interaction is determined to be 2.960 Å. Other interactions are CH⋯N interaction (2.654 Å) between methoxy and BTD, and CH⋯S interaction (2.931 Å) between amantadine and BTD. The parallel alignment of compound 2 induces red-shifted emission, while the anti-parallel alignment of compound 1 results in blue-shifted emission.

In the single crystals of compounds 3, 4, and 5, multiple conformers are seen. Four conformers exist in the single crystal of compound 3, while two conformers for 4 and 5, respectively. The four conformers in compound 3 exist in two layers, each of which possesses an anti-parallel dimer because of the double short-contact between sulfur and nitrogen from the adjacent two BTD cores. Further intermolecular CH⋯O and CH⋯N interactions integrate these dimers in layer by layer structures (Fig. 5c). The molecular packing mode in compound 4 is similar to what we have seen in compound 3 (Fig. 5d). However, in the case of compound 5, the double short-contact between sulfur and nitrogen is absent because of the insertion of the cyano group (Fig. 5e). Crystal densities of compounds 3, 4, and 5 are determined to be 1.387, 1.416, and 1.435 g cm−3, respectively (Table S1, ESI†). It implies that compound 3 has the largest tendency to change the emissive color in solid states among these compounds by applying external stimuli.28 The molecular packing mode is essentially the same in single crystals of compound 6 (Fig. 5f) and compound 7 (Fig. 5g). The double short-contact between sulfur and nitrogen from the two adjacent BTD cores results in a dimer with anti-parallel alignment and further assembles to construct a layer-by-layer structure through CH⋯π interaction in compound 6 and CH⋯N interaction in compound 7.
Films are formed by spinning a dilute chlorobenzene solution of compounds 1–7 on quartz plates and then vaporizing under N2 atmosphere. Absorptions of compounds 1–7 in films are all red-shifted about 20 nm compared to those absorptions in dilute acetonitrile solutions with larger full widths at half maximum intensity (FWHMs) (Table 1 and Fig. S22, ESI†). Three films, prepared from 1, 5, and 6, are fluorescent while the others are not. These three films emit light at 575 nm, 559 nm, and 602 nm with quantum yields of 10.8%, 7.0%, and 43.6%, respectively. By doping these compounds in PMMA (9 × 10−5 mol 1–7/1 g PMMA), the films, doped with compounds 5 and 6, are fluorescent and emit light at 563 nm and 571 nm, respectively. The others are non-fluorescent (Fig. S23, ESI†).
As the excitation wavelength changes from 360 nm to 420 nm, all powders (1–7) show a single emission (Fig. S24, ESI†). This is a good indication of the expression of anti-Kasha's emission in solution. In the condensed phase, the energy released from VR and IC processes could be relieved as heat through intermolecular interactions which directly results in the depopulation of S2 states.23 In other words, only one emission band (S1 → S0) could be seen in the condensed phase. A similar situation is observed for their emissions in the frozen state. By freezing the dilute toluene solutions of compounds 1–7 in liquid nitrogen, only one emission band (S1 → S0) is observed and the intensity changes as the excitation wavelength changes (Fig. S25, ESI†).
Application as a gaseous ammonia sensor
The absorption and emission spectra of compounds 1–6 depend on environmental acidity (Fig. S26, ESI†). When the absorption spectra of these compounds are recorded in acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1 M HCl, blue-shifted absorption is observed for compounds 1 and 2. As we can see from the photo (Fig. 6a, inset photo), the yellow color fades in the presence of HCl. Nevertheless, the emission turns on. Bright yellow emission is seen when HCl is added to an acetonitrile solution of compound 2. The quantum yield is determined to be 22.2% for 2 in acidic acetonitrile. The distinguishable emission color change of compound 2 could be used to reversibly probe gaseous hydrogen chloride and gaseous ammonia (Fig. S27, ESI†).29 Dipping the fluorescent silica plate (Silica GF254) into a dilute dichloromethane solution of compound 2 and evaporating the solvent, a pristine plate with the doping of compound 2 is prepared. The pristine plate is blue under UV light. Putting the pristine plate on the top of a bottle of concentrated HCl and saturating it with HCl vapor for 180 seconds, the plate becomes yellow under UV light. The color could be turned back to blue after the plate is re-saturated with ammonia vapor for 30 seconds. As a practical usage, the powder of compound 2 could be directly used to detect ammonia and hydrogen chloride vapor in a reusable way (Fig. 6b and c). The color of the powder changes between yellow and red under UV light when the powder is alternately exposed to hydrogen chloride and ammonia vapor for 180 seconds and 30 seconds, respectively.

Application as a fluoride anion sensor
These compounds are versatile. Compound 5 might be developed as a potential fluoride fluorescent chemosensor due to the enhanced acidity of the NH group affected by the electron withdrawing cyano group which is absent in the other compounds (Fig. 7). The absorption spectrum changes as tetrabutylammonium fluoride gradually approaches 20 equivalents for compound 5 (Fig. 7a). Three isosbestic points appear in absorption spectra with values of 347, 430, and 536 nm, respectively. The solution color remains yellow as the fluoride anion reaches 10 equivalents. A dramatic change is observed when the fluoride anion reaches 12 equivalents. The color changes to green and remains the same beyond this point (Fig. 7c). Meanwhile, a turn-off emission is observed as fluoride anion is added to a dilute solution of compound 5. When the fluoride anion reaches 10 equivalents, the emission intensity decreases to half of its initial. As the amount of fluoride anions further increases, the emission intensity decreases and finally turns off at 20 equivalents (Fig. 7b).
 Fig. 7  Absorption (a), emission (b), and photo (c) of 5 (c = 5 × 10−5 M, DMSO) in the presence of varying amounts of TBAF; absorption (d), emission (e), and photo (f) of 5 (5 × 10−5 M, DMSO) in the presence of 20 equivalents of various tetrabutylammonium salts in DMSO. 
Subsequently, we tested the anion selectivity. Thus, various anions are respectively added to a dilute solution of compound 5. Absorption spectra remain unchanged when Cl−, Br−, I−, NO3−, AcO−, ClO4−, PF6−, H2PO4−, and HSO4− are, respectively, tested except the hydroxide anion (Fig. 7d and f). With the gradual addition of the hydroxide anion, the absorption spectrum alters and the alteration is almost identical to the addition of the fluoride anion (Fig. 7d). Fortunately, the discrimination between fluoride and hydroxide anions could be realized by the measurement of their emission spectra (Fig. 7e and f). Addition of hydroxide leads to blue-shifted emission, while addition of fluoride turns the emission off.
Electrochemical studies of Am-BTDs (1–7)
Oxidation and reduction potentials obtained from cyclic voltammetry are applied to estimate the frontier orbital levels and the results are summarized in Fig. S29 and Table S4 (ESI†). The energy gaps between the HOMO and LUMO obtained from electrochemical studies are in good accordance with the energy gaps resulting from UV measurements except for the cases of compound 1 and 4. Meanwhile, the results obtained from the theoretical calculation (Fig. S28 and S30, ESI†) are in good accordance with those from UV measurements, but with much higher absolute values.
Electroluminescence of compound 6
To further extend the utility of these compounds, an organic light emitting diode with a structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/compound 6 (65 nm)/TBPI (40 nm)/LiF (1.5 nm)/Al (50 nm) is fabricated. The device emits light at 625 nm (CIE: 0.63, 0.37) with a HWHM of 107 nm at a voltage of 7 V and exhibits a turn-on voltage of 3.0 V at a brightness of 1 cd m−2, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.91%, a luminous efficiency of 1.06 cd A−1 and a power efficiency of 0.81 lm W−1 (Fig. 8).

Conclusions
In conclusion, by directly covalent bonding amino groups to the BTD core, we have developed a series of Am-BTDs with interesting and applicable fluorescent properties. Anti-Kasha's emission is observed for some Am-BTDs in solutions which could be ascribed to the strong electronic communication between nitrogen and the BTD core. The stronger the electronic communication is, the more the expression of anti-Kasha's emission. Applying this abnormal property, a white solution emission is obtained. Moreover, some Am-BTDs could be developed as fluorescent pH sensors for detecting environmental acidity, not only for probing solution acidity but also for probing gaseous ammonia. It is also noteworthy that compound 5 could be developed as a fluorescent fluoride sensor. The discrimination between fluoride and hydroxide could be easily achieved by fluorescence detection. Finally, Am-BTDs are not only emissive in solutions but also emissive in solids. The emissive color in solid is tunable and varies from yellow to red depending on the different amino groups and the different states. In the film state, a maximum quantum yield of 43.6% is obtained which opens a window for them to become promising emitting materials in OLEDs. Although the OLED result is not good enough at this stage, the facile preparation, tunable color, abnormal anti-Kasha's emission and thermal stability of these new compounds are valuable and worth noting in the future.
