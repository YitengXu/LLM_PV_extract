    , Accepted 4th June 2015First published on 5th June 2015AbstractCurrently, TiO2 on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate is the most commonly used type of photoelectrode in high-efficiency quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of TiO2 photoelectrodes is limited because of higher charge recombination and lower QD loading on the TiO2 film. This article describes the effect of a TiO2 compact layer on a TiO2 film to enhance the performance of QDSSCs. TiO2 nanoparticles were coated on an FTO substrate by the doctor-blade method and then the TiO2 compact layer was successfully fabricated on the surface of the nanoparticles by a simple hydrothermal method. QDSSCs were made using these films as photoelectrodes with NiS counter electrodes. Under one sun illumination (AM 1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2), the QDSSCs showed PCEs of 2.19 and 2.93% for TCL1 and TCL2 based photoelectrodes, which are higher than the 1.33% value obtained with bare TiO2. The compact-layer-coated film electrodes provide a lower charge-transfer resistance and higher light harvesting. The compact layer on the TiO2 film is a more efficient photocatalyst than pure TiO2 film and physically separates the injected electrons in the TiO2 from the positively charged CdS QD/electrolyte.
1. Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are environmentally friendly and made from cheap materials that do not need to be highly purified. They can also be printed at low cost and have acceptable power conversion efficiency.1–4 O'Regan and Gratzel fabricated titania (TiO2) nanoparticles for DSSC applications. The nanoparticles act as a mesoporous n-type photoanode and drastically increase the surface area for dye attachment by a factor of more than one thousand.5
During the 1990s and early 2000s, researchers found that iodide/triiodide and ruthenium, which act as an efficient redox-electrolyte and sensitizer, respectively, provided the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE).6,7 The small size of the iodide/triiodide redox components allows for relatively fast electron diffusion within mesoporous and slow recombination kinetics between electrons in the titania and the triiodide in the electrolyte. However, the PCE of DSSCs is inferior to that of thin-film and Si-based solar cells.8,9 At this stage, it would very beneficial to develop a new type of solar cell with enhanced conversion efficiency and stability.
Semiconductor quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have advantages of low cost and a simple fabrication process. This technology has thus attracted considerable interest for solar energy harvesting and conversion efficiency.10–13 The attractive properties of semiconductor quantum dots are the multiple exciton generation effects, an enhanced theoretical PCE beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit for QDSSCs, higher extinction coefficients, and tunable band gaps.14 It is well known that the concept of QDSSCs is similar to that of DSSCs but with the molecular dye replaced by a wide-band-gap semiconductor electrode and counter electrode.15
The TiO2 nanoparticle-based photoelectrode in DSSCs has a PCE of up to 12%, but that for QDSSCs is currently less than 7%.16 Clark et al. concluded that the low PCE is because of the design of QDSSCs rather than being fundamental to QDSSCs.17 In DSSCs and QDSSCs, an optimized mesoporous film of sintered TiO2 nanoparticles is used as the photoelectrode. The difference between molecular dyes and quantum dot sensitizers (such as CdS, CdSe, PbS, InP, and CdTe) is that the optimized TiO2 photoanode in DSSCs does not effectively work for QDSSCs due to the different size and different charge recombination route. To enhance the PCE, modification of the TiO2 photoanode is essential.
The photoanode is important for collecting photo-injected electrons from the QD sensitizers and as a bridge between the sensitizer and an external circuit to provide better electron transport. The main advantage of using TiO2 nanoparticles in QDSSCs is the high surface area available for the sensitizer's adsorption, which enhances the light harvesting efficiency.18 A TiO2 photoelectrode in QDSSCs has tremendous advantages and plays three major roles: (1) providing a substrate of TiO2-coated fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) for QD adsorption, (2) accepting excited electrons from the CdS sensitizers, and (3) transporting the electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 toward the FTO substrate.19 However, some factors limit the PCE, such as the greater recombination between the photoanode and electrolyte, poor utilization of near-infrared light, and a large amount of grain boundaries.20 Ways to enhance the PCE of QDSSCs are continuously being explored through reducing charge recombination between the photoanode, electrolyte, and counter electrode (CE), as well as design and optimization of TiO2 photoanodes to increase the QD loading. Charge transfer resistance and the rate at the interface of the photoanode and electrolyte are key processes that determine the PCE of QDSSCs, which suffer from high charge recombination.
Recently, several metal oxide materials have been widely used as potential barriers between TiO2 and the electrolyte to suppress the recombination reaction. A number of advantages have been demonstrated for TiCl4 on TiO2, which acts as a compact layer in QDSSCs.21 TiCl4 has been employed on FTO glass, on mesoporous TiO2 film, and for fabrication on FTO and TiO2 film. However, Mora-sero et al. fabricated TiCl4 on a TiO2 film and concluded that TiCl4 treatment does not lead to any appreciable improvement in the PCE of QDSSCs.22 Apart from the compact layer on a TiO2 film, an optimized thickness of the photoanode results in better performance because of improved QD sensitizer loading on the photoanode, which can harvest more incident photons. For example, Lee et al. reported a TiO2 photoanode with 8.5 μm thickness and achieved a conversion efficiency of 2.9%.23 Kamat et al. fabricated very thin mesoscopic TiO2 films with thicknesses of 0.2–2 μm for colloidal CdSe-based QDSSCs.24
Recently, many studies have examined the recombination process at the interface between the photoelectrodes and electrolyte with different semiconducting and insulating materials as compact layers, such as TiO2, Nb2O5, ZnO, CaCO3, and BaCO3. Among them, a compact layer of TiO2 is the most suitable semiconductor material as a blocking layer and has been investigated most frequently. Hongsik et al. used TiO2 as a compact layer and deposited it on a substrate by hydrolysis of a TiCl4 aqueous solution. They improved the PCE by 24% compared with a bare cell.25 Besides the blocking effect, a higher density of the TiO2 compact layer can provide more electron pathways from the photoelectrodes to the FTO for photo-generated electrons. This can improve the electron transfer process and enhance the electron transfer efficiency. The compact layer can be fabricated directly on the conductive substrate by sputtering, chemical vapor deposition, spray pyrolysis, and dip-coating. However, the overall cost of the QDSSC or DSSC can be dramatically decreased if the coating process requires only solution containers and substrate mounting devices.
We have fabricated TiO2 nanoflowers on TiO2 films by a hydrothermal method, which is simple and low cost. The TiO2 nanoflowers were used as a blocking layer to reduce the electron back reaction. An appropriate amount of TiO2 nanoparticles on TiO2 films can also increase the light-harvesting efficiency and decrease the surface roughness. Using the compact layer, we achieved a PCE of 2.93% with only CdS as a sensitizer and NiS as a CE. This high PCE for TiO2/CdS-based QDSSCs is due to the improved short-circuit current density (10.44 mA cm−2) under one sun illumination.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Commercially available TiO2 paste (Ti-nanoxide HT/SP) was purchased from Solaronix and used without any further purification. Cadmium acetate dihydrate [Cd(CH3COO)2·2H2O], sodium sulfide [Na2S], titanium n-butoxide, hydrochloric acid [HCl], nickel sulfate hexahydrate [NiSO4·6H2O], urea [CH4N2O], and thioacetamide [C2H5NS] were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
2.2 Fabrication of bare TiO2/CdS, TCL1, TCL2 and TCL3 photoanodes
TiO2 nanoparticles were directly deposited by the doctor blade method on an FTO glass substrate (13 Ω sq−2, Hartford Glass Co. Inc.). Before deposition, the FTO substrates were cleaned with acetone/ethanol and deionized water for 15 min each. 20 nm anatase TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide, HT/SP, Solaronix) was deposited onto the FTO glass by the doctor blade method and heat treated at 450 °C for 30 min. To deposit rutile TiO2 nanoflower on the TiO2 film, a precursor solution was prepared in a stainless steel autoclave of 50 mL capacity with a Teflon liner. Hydrochloric acid (20 mL of 37%) and 0.7 mL of titanium(IV) n-butoxide were added to 20 mL of deionized water and stirred for 30 min. The resulting precursor mixture was then transferred to the autoclave, in which the TiO2-coated FTO substrates were placed in a tilted position inside the Teflon liner. The autoclave was sealed, and the deposition was done at 85, 95 and 105 °C for 45 min. The autoclave was then naturally cooled to room temperature, and the resulting substrates were cleaned with deionized water and ethanol several times.
The CdS QDs were sensitized on the TiO2 nanoflower film by the successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. In this method, a TiO2 nanoflower film was dipped into 0.2 M Cd(NO3)2 for 5 min to allow Cd2+ ions to adsorb over the TiO2 nanoflower film and rinsed with deionized water and ethanol for 1 min each to remove the excess Cd2+ ions. The film was dipped for another 5 min into 0.2 M sodium sulfide, where the pre-adsorbed Cd2+ ions react with S2− ions to form CdS, followed by rinsing again with deionized water and ethanol and drying with an air dryer. These two-dipping procedures define one cycle. Up to five SILAR cycles were performed to obtain the desired coating.
2.3 Preparation of NiS counter electrode
A simple chemical bath deposition (CBD) method was used for the preparation of the NiS CE on the FTO substrate. Prior to the CBD method, the FTO substrates were cleaned ultrasonically with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for 15 min each. The NiSO4·6H2O and C2H5NS act as cationic and anionic sources of Ni2+ and S2− ions, respectively. Urea acts as a strong reagent and increases the hydrolysis rate of the aqueous solution and the rate of C2H5NS decomposition.26,27 The cleaned FTO substrates were immersed in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M NiSO4·6H2O, 0.4 M C2H5NS, and 0.2 M urea (in 40 mL of DI water). The resulting solution and cleaned FTO substrates were placed in a hot air oven and maintained at a deposition temperature of 90 °C for 90 min. Then, the NiS-coated FTO substrates were cleaned with deionized water and ethanol several times and dried at 60 °C for 1 h.
2.4 Fabrication of QDSSCs
Finally, the QDSSCs were assembled by sandwiching a QD-sensitized TiO2 photoanode and NiS CE using a 50 μm hot melt sealing sheet (double sheet of SX 1170-25, Solaronix). The internal space between the photoanode and CE was filled by capillary action with a polysulfide electrolyte containing 1 M Na2S, 1 M sulfur, and 0.1 M NaOH in methanol/water (7:3 ratio). These prepared cells were left for a few minutes for complete diffusion of the polysulfide electrolyte within the photoanode. The active areas of the QD-sensitized TiO2 film and CE were 0.25 and 0.7 cm2, respectively.
2.5 Measurements
The surface morphology and the thickness of the bare TiO2 and TiO2 nanoflower electrodes were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi S-4200). An energy dispersive X-ray spectroscope (EDX) and atomic force microscope (AFM, JPK NanoWizard II AFM, JPK Instruments, Berlin, Germany) with a scan rate of 0.8 Hz in contact mode were used to identify the elemental composition and surface roughness of the films. QD loading measurements were conducted using an OPTIZEN 3220 UV spectrophotometer. X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/Max-2400, Rigaku) was characterized to identify the crystal nature and phase composition. Photocurrent–voltage (I–V) measurements were performed using an ABET Technologies (USA) solar simulator with an irradiance uniformity of ±3 under one sun illumination. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed using a Biologic SP-150 with frequency ranging from 100 mHz to 500 kHz, and the applied bias voltage was set to the Voc value of the QDSSCs.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphological and structural studies
The TiO2 nanoflowers were coated on the TiO2 film by a simple hydrothermal method with various deposition temperatures for 45 min. For convenience, the QDSSCs fabricated using TiO2 + TiO2 nanoflowers deposited at 85, 95, and 105 °C are denoted as TCL1, TCL2 and TCL3, respectively. The morphology changes of the TiO2, TCL1, TCL2, and TCL3 were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The surface morphology of a bare TiO2 electrode has a uniformly distributed scale-like nanostructure that renders a high surface area on the FTO substrate. The size and density of the TiO2 nanoparticles do not change even after deposition of the TiO2 nanoparticles on TiO2 (TCL1). The nanoparticles act as a compact layer between the TiO2 and the CdS-sensitized layer, but the surface becomes more uniform compared to bare TiO2, as shown in Fig. 1b.
 Fig. 1  SEM images of (a) bare TiO2, (b) TCL1, (c) TCL2 and (d) TCL3 photoanodes. 
The TCL2 electrode has a dark white color, implying the loading of TiO2 nanoparticles on the TiO2 electrodes. The gaps between the scale-like nanostructures were diminished by increasing the deposition temperature from 85 to 95 °C. The TCL2 electrode consists of scale-like nanoparticles, and a number of tiny particles formed a group that resembles a flower structure. The flower-type and scale-like nanoparticles block off the CdS sensitizer and electrolyte from the TiO2 film, which affects the QDSSC performance by blocking the recombination reaction and reducing forward electron injection. When the deposition temperature was increased from 95 to 105 °C (Fig. 1c), the active material started to peel off from the FTO substrate. The amount of adhesion of the active material on the FTO and compact layer on the TiO2 films plays a vital role in blocking the recombination and increasing the conversion efficiency. We obtained good adhesion between the TiO2/TiO2 nanoflower and CdS sensitizer using deposition temperatures of 85 and 95 °C for 45 min. Surface and cross-sectional SEM was applied to identify the surface morphology and thickness of the films of the NiS CE, and the corresponding images are shown in the ESI (Fig. S1†).
XRD analysis was conducted to identify the crystal structure and phase purity of the TiO2, TCL1, TCL2, and TCL3 films. The resulting XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 2. The downward arrow and diamond symbols represent the TiO2 and FTO glass substrate peaks. The bare TiO2 and compact-layer-coated electrodes were dried with a hair dryer after the hydrothermal method and examined without further calcination. For all the films, three diffraction peaks were observed at 2θ angles of 25.32°, 37.84°, and 78.75° corresponding to the crystal planes of (1 0 1), (1 0 4), and (2 0 6), respectively (indicating an anatase body-centered tetragonal structure; JCPDS card no. 01-084-1286). The results suggest that pure TiO2 was successfully deposited on the FTO substrate through the doctor-blade and hydrothermal methods.

The peak intensity is decreased for TCL3 compared to TiO2, TCL1, and TCL2. This is mainly due to the formation of an amorphous substance on the film surface. However no characteristic peaks were observed, which might be due to the very low thickness of the materials or interference from the XRD signals of the high-crystallinity FTO. The particle sizes of the films were estimated using the Scherer equation: D = 0.91τ/βcosθ(1)where D is the average particle size, τ is the wavelength of the X-rays (1.54056 Å), β is the peak width at half-maximum in radians, and θ is the Bragg angle. Using this equation, the average particle size was estimated to be 30.30–45.45 nm for all four films. The mean particle size of the electrodes was observed from the prominent (1 0 4) diffraction peak and is in good agreement with that observed in the SEM images (Fig. 1).
Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) was used to characterize the crystalline phases. Fig. 3 shows the EDX spectra, and the atomic percentages are shown in the insets of Fig. 3. The spectra show only orbital states of Ti and O with strong peaks, and no external peaks were detected in the films. The atomic ratio of Ti to O was found to be 33.85:66.45, or approximately 1:2. Interestingly, the atomic ratio of Ti to O did not change, even when the deposition temperature increased from 85 °C to 95 and 105 °C for the compact layer fabrication. From the XRD and EDX analyses, we can conclude that the phase purity of the TiO2 film and structure do not change, even if the deposition temperature varies.

The surface morphology and electron-transfer rate can be changed by mechanical erosion, localized thermal melting, varying deposition time, and hydroxyl radical attack. However, the SEM results can indicate only the structural features and density of the particles, and the presence of these particles cannot be distinguished with the resolution of SEM analysis. To investigate the possibility of changes in surface morphology and roughness by the deposition temperature, AFM was carried out for the TiO2 and TCL2 electrode. Fig. 4 shows the two-dimensional and three-dimensional AFM images, which show that the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of TCL2 decreased from 35.21 to 28.99 nm with increasing deposition temperature or with the compact layer. For TCL2, the surface morphology showed scale-like nanostructures and tiny flower-type structures covering the entire surface area, which lead to low RMS surface roughness. The higher surface roughness for the TiO2 electrode is mainly due to the small nanoparticle size compared with the TCL2 electrode, as shown in Fig. 1a and c. The PCE of the QDSSCs mainly depends on the lower surface roughness of the photoanode.28 A reduction of the surface roughness in TiO2/TiO2 nanoflowers tends to enhance Jsc (which affects the optical properties) and decrease the charge transfer resistance at the interface between the photoanode and electrolyte.

3.2 Optical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra before sensitization are shown in Fig. 5a over the range of 300–600 nm. The absorption edges of the TiO2 and TCL1 appear around 390 nm, and those of TCL2 and TCL3 appear at around 400 nm. The TiO2 and TCL1 electrodes showed similar absorption intensities for the wavelengths of 300–390 nm. TCL2 and TCL3 showed the highest absorption intensity, which was slightly shifted towards a higher wavelength compared to the bare TiO2 and TCL1. Through extrapolation of the plot of (OD × hv)2 with respect to hv (where OD is the optical density), we estimated the band gap (Eg) of the TiO2 and TCL2 electrodes to be 3.17 and 3.1 eV, which are approximately equal to values from published work.29
 Fig. 5  UV-vis absorption spectra of photo-electrodes made (a) before sensitization and (b) after sensitization. 
One of the vital components in QDSSCs is the photoelectrode, which is formed by a combination of a TiO2 film and a QD sensitizer for light harvesting. The CdS sensitizer on the TiO2 film absorbs photons and generates electron–hole pairs at the interface between the TiO2 and the polysulfide electrode. The sensitizer plays a key role in the whole photovoltaic process, particularly in the cell's short-circuit current density (Jsc). This value is directly proportional to the light harvesting ability of the cell and the injection of excited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band.30 In addition, CdS loading on the TiO2 electrode also affects the open-circuit voltage (Voc).31 Effective loading of the QD sensitizers on the TiO2 film is important for controlling and eventually optimizing the QDSSC parameters.
The UV-Vis absorbance was also recorded after CdS sensitization, as shown in Fig. 5b. The spectra show that the absorption of CdS-sensitized electrodes was different from that in Fig. 5a. With the compact layer, the peaks broadened and the absorption increased dramatically with increased deposition temperature due to the increased number of CdS molecules on the TiO2 film. When CdS nanoparticles were deposited on TiO2 nanoflowers by the SILAR method, the absorption edges of the TiO2, TCL1 increased from 390 nm to 520 and 530 nm. Simultaneously, the absorption edges of the TCL2 and TCL3 also increased from 400 to 555 nm (Fig. 5b). This indicates that the light absorption range shifts towards a higher wavelength with the compact layer and improves the QDSSC performance.
3.3 Photovoltaic performance of QDSSCs

Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the QDSSCs with the different photoelectrodes, NiS CEs, and a polysulfide electrolyte, which acts as a hole transporter. Under one sun illumination, the QDSSC with the bare TiO2 has a much lower photoelectric conversion efficiency of 1.33% (Table 1) compared to the other three cells. This was due mainly to the lower Jsc (4.45 mA cm−2) and FF (0.46). The lower values reveal lower CdS loading, lower light scattering, and greater energy loss. Fig. 6 shows that Jsc and FF are greatly enhanced from 4.45 to 10.44 mA cm−2 and from 0.46 to 0.49 for the TCL2-based cell. This can be attributed to the larger surface area from the compact layer adsorbing more CdS QDs because of the additional scale-like TiO2 nanoflowers. The amount of CdS on the TCL2 film is significantly larger than that of the bare TiO2 film according to the UV-Vis absorption measurement (Fig. 5b), resulting in a higher short-circuit current density. It can be concluded that the enhancement in the Jsc and conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs mostly arises from the CdS QD loading on the TiO2 film.32

3.4 Electrochemical impedance studies
Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were used to study the electron charge transfer behavior at the photoanode/electrolyte and CE/electrolyte interfaces.33 To identify the electrochemical characteristics, QDSSCs were fabricated with a sandwich structure consisting of CdS-sensitized TiO2 and NiS as the photoelectrode and CE, respectively. EIS was performed under various applied bias voltages (DC voltage, 0 to 0.9 V) and various AC frequencies (100 mHz–500 kHz). The photoanode had an active area of 0.25 cm2 and that of the NiS CE was 0.7 cm2.
The plot shows that the diameter of the higher semicircle is constant with increases in bias voltage, but the diameter of the lower semi-circle decreases as the bias voltage is increased from 0 to 0.9 V (Fig. 7a). This can be explained as follows. At various applied bias voltages, the excited electrons are injected into the conduction band of the TiO2 electrode and some of the electrons recombine with the polysulfide electrolyte. The recombination rate increases as the bias voltage approaches Voc. Therefore, the decrease of the lower frequency semi-circle can be determined as the change in the number of electrons recombining with the electrolyte at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface.33,34 Thus, the diameter of the higher semi-circle in Fig. 7a is closely related to Jsc due to the electron back reaction. The diameter of the higher semi-circle is inversely proportional to the short-circuit current. This result is quite interesting because when the applied bias voltage is near Voc or higher, there is greater charge transport at the interface of the photoelectrode and electrolyte interface.

The equivalent circuit model is shown in the inset. (b) EIS spectra of QDSSCs based on TiO2 and TCL1, TCL2, and TCL3 photoanodes using the NiS counter electrodes. (c) Bode-plot curves from EIS of the QDSSCs on the above mentioned electrodes. 
EIS was used for its advantages in characterizing the internal resistance, Warburg diffusion resistance, and charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte and photoelectrode/electrolyte interfaces. EIS was carried out with AM 1.5 G one sun illumination at an applied bias of Voc. The Nyquist plot and parameters are shown in Fig. 7b and Table 2. In the equivalent circuit, a series resistance (Rs) is added to account for the nonzero intercepts on the real axis of the impedance plot and denotes the sheet resistance of the TCO and the contact resistance of FTO/TiO2. RCE and Rct can be used to monitor the charge transfer resistance at the CE/electrolyte and photoelectrode/electrolyte interfaces. These resistances are parallel with the chemical capacitance (Cμ). The Warburg diffusion coefficient (Zw) is in the low-frequency region and can be obtained from the Warburg impedance of the redox couple in the electrolyte. Rs and Cμ at the photoelectrode and polysulfide electrolyte reflect the charge transfer resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte interface. Larger Rs and Cμ values indicate a higher charge recombination rate and an upward shift of the Fermi level, which gives a larger Voc.33

The result shows that the QDSSCs made with the bare TiO2/CdS had a higher Rct (6.75 Ω) and the lowest Cμ (4.86 μF), which indicates higher recombination rate at the interface of the photoelectrode and the electrolyte.34Rct was significantly lower for the TCL1 and TCL2 cells (3.56 and 3.33 Ω, respectively). The low Rct indicates an enhanced electron transfer rate and greater conversion efficiency. The Zw values for the TiO2, TCL1, TCL2, and TCL3 QDSSCs are 1.85, 1.70, 1.39, and 1.91 Ω, respectively. The very low value for TCL2 compared to the bare TiO2 demonstrates a higher diffusion velocity of the redox couple.35 Using an appropriate deposition temperature for the compact layer leads to an increased electron transfer rate without recombination and improved conversion efficiency.
The electron lifetime (τe) can be estimated from the maximum angular frequency of the impedance semi-circle arc at middle frequencies, according to the following equation: τe = 1/2πfmax(2)where fmax is the peak frequency among the mid-frequency peaks. The τe values for the TiO2, TCL1, TCL2, and TCL3 QDSSCs were 0.166, 0.348, 0.503, and 0.305 ms, respectively. Fig. 7c shows a mid-frequency peak shifting towards lower frequency, which represents a higher electron life time (a shift to higher frequency represents a lower electron lifetime).36 For QDSSCs with the TCL2 photoanode, a higher τe of 0.503 ms was obtained compared to bare TiO2. This may be due to the lower back reaction of electrons with the polysulfide electrolyte. The longer diffusion length (Ln) and electron recombination rate are the major factors that can influence the electron lifetime.37Ln can be calculated using the following equation: Ln2 = Deff × τe(3) Deff = (Rk/Rw)L2Keff(4)where Deff, Rk, Rw, Keff, and L are the effective electron diffusion coefficient, charge transfer resistance related to recombination, electron transport resistance in the photoanode, effective rate constant for recombination, and photoelectrode thickness, respectively.

Fig. 8a shows the QDSSC structure that consists of the anatase TiO2 film, CdS QD sensitizer, polysulfide electrolyte, and CE. Photons are captured by the CdS QDs, yielding electron–hole pairs that are rapidly separated into electrons and holes at the interface between the nanocrystalline oxide and quantum dots. The excited electrons are injected into the TiO2 film (1), electrons are transported from the conduction band of TiO2 to the collecting electrode surface (2), the holes are released by the polysulfide redox couple (3), and the polysulfide redox electrolyte regenerates (4). During this process, an undesirable side process occurs in which excited electrons are injected into the conduction band of TiO2 and may reduce either the oxidized CdS QDs or recombine with the polysulfide electrolyte (6).

Kamat et al. reported that the electron transfer between CdS QDs and TiO2 is much faster than the hole transfer (1010–1011 S−1 for QDs and TiO2, 107–109 S−1 for hole transfer).38 However, the electron transport within the mesoporous TiO2 film is even slower. So, the recombination losses between the interfaces become a major factor in limiting the overall conversion efficiency. In addition, introducing TiO2 nanoparticles onto the TiO2 photoanode can effectively prevent the recombination from the conduction band of TiO2 for the oxidized CdS QDs and polysulfide electrolyte (6). Moreover, the compact layer on the TiO2 film is a more efficient photocatalyst than pure TiO2 film and physically separates the injected electrons in the TiO2 from the positively charged CdS QDs and electrolyte. The recombination between the interfaces was drastically reduced and led to a better photovoltaic performance of the TCL2-based photoelectrode. The conversion efficiency was increased from 1.33% to 2.93% after adding the compact layer between the TiO2 and CdS QDs due to the large accumulation of photo-injected electrons in the conduction band of the TiO2 film.
The factors that limit the conversion efficiency in QDSSCs include the charge transfer resistance at the photoelectrode/electrolyte and CE/electrolyte interfaces, slower hole transfer and recombination of charge carriers with the polysulfide electrolyte, and the CE performance. In this study, the EIS analysis revealed that lower charge transfer resistance (3.33 Ω) and the highest chemical capacitance (10.25 μF) were obtained with the TCL2-based photoelectrode, which is directly reflected in Jsc. The photovoltaic performances of QDSSCs with the TiO2, TCL1, TCL2 and TCL3 photoanodes were compared based on the Rct value, as shown in Fig. 9. It was found that the Rct value corresponding to the TCL2 (3.33 Ω) is significantly lower than that of the TiO2, TCL1 and TCL3 cells (6.75, 3.56 and 5.12 Ω, respectively). The lower Rct in the TCL2 photoanode suggests grater enhancement of the charge transfer, which would increase large injection and accumulation of photo exited electrons in the conduction band of the photoanode.39 These EIS results support the higher recombination rate for the TiO2 cell, which is worthless for the enhanced Jsc and FF values for cells subjected to the without TiO2 nanoflower treatment on a TiO2 film as observed in the J–V measurements.18 The QDSSC performance was improved with the deposition temperature at 95 °C for 45 min for the compact layer fabrication.

4. Conclusions
In summary, we have prepared bare TiO2 and compact-layer-coated photoelectrodes for CdS QDSSCs with NiS CEs. Interestingly, the surface morphology changes from nanoparticles to nanoflowers, which is greatly affected by the deposition temperature ranging from 85 to 95 °C. We compared the photoanodes and found TCL2 to be the most efficient one owing to its faster charge transport, more efficient charge separation, and greater light harvesting. An efficiency of 1.33% with Voc = 0.64, Jsc = 4.45 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.46 has been achieved under one sun illumination with the bare TiO2 and NiS CE. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results indicated that the lower charge-transfer resistance (3.33 Ω), highest chemical capacitance (10.25 μF) and QD loading on TiO2 are beneficial for the photocurrent and performance of QDSSCs. A maximum short-circuit density of 10.44 mA cm−2 and 2.93% conversion efficiency have been achieved with the compact layer deposited at 95 °C for 45 min, which enabled 54.60% improvement in the conversion efficiency compared to bare TiO2. The increase in deposition temperature from 95 to 105 °C proportionally increases the charge recombination rate due to the higher surface roughness of the photoanode and affects the QDSSC performance. The experimental results confirmed that the deposition temperature of 95 °C is very effective in improving both the device performance and electron transfer rate. The results confirm that optimized preparation conditions are needed for the preparation of the compact layer to improve the performance. Studies on optimization of the photoanode by controlling the compact layer thickness, morphology, and fabrication techniques are underway and could lead to a new record conversion efficiency for QDSSCs.
