    , Accepted 30th June 2008First published on 1st August 2008AbstractHighly-ordered and well-aligned fullerene nanofibre arrays were fabricated via a nanotemplate preparation method and surface-wetting technique. The as-prepared fullerene nanofibre arrays were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra and X-ray diffraction analysis. The dual-layered photoreceptors containing the fullerene nanofibre arrays or bulk fullerene films as the charge-generation layer (CGL) were fabricated. The photosensitivity of photoreceptors with fullerene nanoarrays as CGL was improved by one order of magnitude compared to that of their bulk films. The effect of the diameter and the length of the fullerene nanofibres on the photosensitivity of the photoreceptors was also investigated.
Introduction
Fabrication of nanometre-scale components in desired geometries is of significance for the new generation of optoelectronic devices such as field-effect transistors, photovoltaic cells, light-emitting diodes, and lasers etc.1–3 In particular, vertically aligned nanofibre arrays with a high surface-to-volume ratio on conductive substrates are expected to exhibit a high charge-carrier mobility due to the well-defined transportation channels for carriers,4,5 and thus would be ideal building blocks for photovoltaic and photoconductive devices.6
Fullerenes have become one of the most intensely investigated semiconductors during the past decade because of their fundamental importance and promising applications in optics, electronics and other areas.7–12 It should be mentioned that solution-processed organic solar cells with the highest power conversion efficiency published so far were based on the polymer blends with fullerene derivatives as the acceptor materials.8,9 Although great efforts have been made to produce designed fullerene films using a variety of nanofabrication techniques,13–15 it is still a great challenge to tailor the morphology, orientation and size of fullerene nanostructures in a controllable way.
So far, a lot of research on the preparation of fullerene nanostructures by using various preparation methods has been published.16–27 Among all these preparation techniques, the template-synthesis-method21,22 has attracted more attention due to its efficiency and convenience in controlling the shape and the size of the resulting nanomaterials. Recently, well-defined metallofullerene nanowires and nanotubes were fabricated via an electrophoretic template-synthesis method,23,28 and a controllable brushlike fullerene thin film was prepared by maintaining a pressure difference between the two sides of anodic aluminium oxide (AAO) templates for quite a long time.24 All these fabrication approaches have their remarkable advantages, but certain limitations of demanding external assistance, such as from an electrical field or gas pressure, are still required to be addressed. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a versatile, yet facile, process for the preparation of fullerene nanostructures.
Surface-wetting, based on a familiar and thoroughly investigated physical phenomenon,29,30 is a kind of universal preparation method that may meet the above requirements. In general, solutions, mixtures, or melts with low surface energies spread over substances with higher surface energies.31 Similar wetting phenomena should occur if a liquid is allowed to spread on the pore walls of a nanoporous membrane, such as the AAO membrane. Herein we report the syntheses of the highly-ordered and well-aligned [60]fullerene nanoarrays by combining this surface-wetting technique with AAO membrane templates. The photosensitivity of the photoreceptor with the as-prepared fullerene nanoarrays as charge-generation layer (CGL) was found to be improved by one order of magnitude compared to that of their bulk film. This template-based surface-wetting method involves a new concept of surface wetting for preparing fullerene nanostructures, which is not only a solvent process with low cost and good controllability, but also a quick preparation method for C60 nanoarrays without any assisting equipment or external energy, such as applied electric field or gas pressure. This simple fabrication approach as well as the photoconductivity improvement of the fullerene nanostructures may intrigue researchers' strong interest in the application of fullerene nanostructures on solar cells.
Experimental
Chemicals

Fullerene powder (＞99.9%) was purchased from Yongxin reagent department and used as received. Other chemicals were commercially available and used without further treatment.
Preparation of the AAO templates
Highly ordered and well-aligned AAO membranes were prepared by two-step anodization of aluminium sheets according to the published procedures32 with some modifications. In order to maintain a constant temperature condition, the anodization was carried out in an ice-water bath. The pore diameter and the length of AAO templates could be tailored by changing the anodization time and the anodization voltage. The alumina barrier layer (BL) was reduced by dipping in 5% phosphoric acid aqueous solution at 30 °C, and the pore diameter of the AAO membrane could be enlarged at the same time. The AAO membrane was perforated by etching the aluminium substrate in a mixed aqueous solution of CuCl2 and HCl, and then decorated on the back side with a sputtered Au layer as conductive substrate. Three kinds of AAO templates with an average pore size of 40, 60 and 80 nm were prepared and used for further study in this work.
Nanotemplate preparation of C60nanofibre arrays by surface-wetting
C60 powder was fully dissolved in an organic solvent (toluene, benzene or carbon disulfide) at room temperature with the aid of a few minutes of ultrasonication. The concentration of C60 solution in organic solvents was 0.75 mg ml−1. The AAO template with the average pore size of 40, 60 or 80 nm decorated with a conductive Au back layer was placed in a clean vessel, with top surface upright. An amount of the as-prepared C60 solution, about 2 mL, was extracted with a burette and equably spread on the surface of the AAO membrane, forming a uniform liquid layer in several seconds. A semi-transparent maple thin film could be observed after the solvent was fully evaporated from the liquid layer in air at 25 °C for 1–3 h. The sample surface was polished softly with a piece of fine 1200 grit sandpaper to remove the stack layer on the template surface, giving a shining film.
Analysis
The obtained fullerene nanofibres were imaged with both an S-4800 (Hitachi) field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) equipped with EDMX operated at 10 kV and a JEM-1230 transmission electron microscope (TEM) operated at 100 kV. In order to obtain the FESEM and TEM images of the fullerene nanofibres, the nanofibres must be freed from the template membrane. This was accomplished as follows: the surface layers and any remains were removed by carefully polishing using a piece of fine grit sandpaper. The alumina membrane was then fully removed by dissolving in a 10% sodium hydroxide solution for 10 minutes at room temperature. For FESEM sample preparation, the dissolving step was carried out after cementing an intact membrane to a piece of glass plate using epoxy, and a very thin platinum (Pt) layer was sputtered on the sample surface to improve the electron conductivity during FESEM characterization. The samples for ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra (UV-vis) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis were prepared in the same way. For comparison, a C60 nanoarrays without removing the bulk layer on their surface was also fixed on a glass plate. TEM and HRTEM samples were prepared from the as-prepared FESEM samples by ultrasonic dispersion in ethanol for 30 min. XRD patterns were obtained on a Rigaku D/max-2500 diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a CARY Bio100 spectrophotometer. HRTEM images were taken on a JEOL JEM-2010 high-resolution transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV.

          Photoreceptor preparation
Dual-layered photoreceptors were fabricated. The well-ordered and aligned C60nanofibres in AAO templates served as the charge-generation layer (CGL), and one layer of polycarbonate (PC) matrix containing 50 wt% dimethyltriphenylamine (TPD) coated on the CGL acted as a charge-transportation layer (CTL). Fig. 5(II) (top right) shows the photoreceptor configuration. For comparison, the photoreceptor employing cast-coated bulk C60 fullerenes as the CGL was also fabricated on the aluminium substrate. The photosensitivity measurement was carried out on a GDT-II model photoconductivity measuring device by a standard photoinduced discharge technique,33,34 of which a typical photoinduced xerographic discharge curve was given in Fig. 5(II). The half-decaying exposure energy (E1/2) is defined as the product of the half decaying time (t1/2) and the intensity of exposure light (I), that is, E1/2 = I × t1/2. Photosensitivity (S) is defined as the reciprocal of the half-discharge exposure energy (S = 1/E1/2). As can be seen from the discharge curve, a desired photoreceptor with higher photosensitivity should have a smaller t1/2 value and a bigger S value.35
Results and discussion
The morphology and absorption spectra of C60nanofibre arrays fabricated by surface-wetting
The AAO templates used here had well-defined close-packed arrays with an average diameter of 80 nm (see the inset in Fig. 1). We found that the templates filled with C60nanofibres had a metal sheen and smooth surface. It could be observed from Fig. 1a that all of the nanopores were fully filled by C60 when an appropriate amount of C60 solution in toluene was used. An FESEM image (Fig. 1b) of nanofibre arrays, obtained after dissolving the alumina template, confirmed that aligned arrays of close-packed fullerene nanofibres were successfully synthesized by this method.

Panels (b) and (c) give the morphologies of C60nanofibre arrays, acquired following dissolution of the alumina templates in 10% aqueous NaOH. The inset in (c) is the TEM image of the individual C60nanofibre. The EDAX graph and elemental percentage data for the sample in (c) are shown in panel (d). 

Fig. 1b showed that wire bundles with tens of micrometres in length were formed from C60 solution and were vertically free-standing on the substrate. Further investigation found that the nanofibres exhibited a smooth outer surface and uniform diameter of about 80 ± 5 nm (Fig. 1c). Corresponding EDAX graph for the sample showed signals of C, O, Au and Pt elements. With O, Au and Pt from epoxy paste, pre-coated Au conductive layer on the back side, and sputtered Pt layer, respectively, the elemental percentage data for the sample in Fig. 1c demonstrated that these nanofibres were composed of fullerene. The individual nanofibres liberated from arrays in Fig. 1c by ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol were investigated by TEM (inset in Fig. 1c), revealing their dense and solid structure. The nanofibre diameter, d, was about 80 ± 5 nm, consistent with the internal pore diameter of original templates.
It should be noted that the template nanochannels could be half-filled or irregular bulk film could appear on the template surfaces if an insufficient or superfluous amount of C60 solution was spread on the AAO membrane. However, the irregular bulk films on the template surfaces (Fig. 2a), if formed by adding an excessive amount of C60 solution, could be removed by softly polishing with a piece of fine grit sandpaper and the templates could be perfectly retained (Fig. 2b). Thus, C60nanofibres with length, L, ranging from hundreds of nanometres to tens of micrometres, could be obtained using different AAO membranes with corresponding thickness. Moreover, C60nanofibres were also obtained by using the C60 solution in different solvents. The FESEM images of the free-standing C60nanofibre arrays prepared from the C60 solution in benzene and carbon disulfide were shown in Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, respectively. It should be noted here that by using AAO templates with different pore sizes, the C60nanofibres diameter could be changed. The C60nanofibres with average diameter of 40, 60, and 80 nm were showed in Fig. 2c,d, and Fig. 1b,c, respectively, replicating the pore size of the original templates. The length of the nanofibres of several micrometres also replicated the membrane thickness of the original templates. As can be seen from Fig. 2c and 2d, the length of C60nanofibres was tested as several micrometres, which corresponded to the membrane length of AAO template used (for a comparison, the side view of the used AAO membrane was given in the inset in Fig. 2c). However, the diameter and the length of the resulting nanofibres only depended on the pore size of the used AAO templates, and had nothing to do with the solvents used.

Inset in (c) gives the side view of the used AAO membrane with several micrometres in length, and the scale bar represents 1 μm. 

UV-vis spectra of fullerene solution in toluene and fullerene films fixed on common glass plate are shown in Fig. 3. The purple solution of C60 in toluene showed two absorption peaks with two shoulders in the absorption band of 400–600 nm, consistent with previously reported results.36 The absorption band of nanofibre arrays fixed on the glass plate after removal of the AAO membrane supporter became much broad and red-shifted. Besides, their absorptions were significantly enhanced in the visible region when compared to that of C60fullerene in toluene solution. This phenomenon may attribute to the aggregation state change of C60 in nanofibres, which results in the stronger intermolecular interactions and then distorts the symmetry absorption.37 However, the spectra of the C60nanofibre arrays accompanied by the C60 bulk film on their surface were very similar to that of C60cluster films on an optically transparent electrode,15 indicating the dominating contribution from the C60clusters in the bulk layer. The broad absorption of the fullerene nanofibres in the visible and infrared region makes them ideal candidates for photovoltaic application.

          XRD patterns and HRTEM image (Fig. 4) of C60nanofibres were recorded to investigate the crystal structure of the as-prepared C60nanofibres. Fig. 4a showed the XRD patterns recorded for the C60nanofibres embedded in AAO membrane and for blank AAO membrane without nanofibres. Two diffraction peaks at 12.28° and 21.38° marked by asterisks were observed for C60nanofibres, indicating a crystal structure with low crystallinity for C60nanofibres.38 The typical HRTEM of C60nanofibre is shown in the right panel of Fig. 4, where the crystal lattice fringes are clearly seen as stripes. The fast Fourier transform (FFT) patterns along the center gave the repeat spacing (d) of about 0.33 nm, close to the value for C60 nanowhiskers.39,40 All these observations revealed that C60nanofibres were polycrystalline. After annealing treatment at 100 °C for 12 h, the free-standing C60nanofibres showed in the XRD pattern (Fig. 4c) the typical eight reflections indexed as the (111), (220), (311), (222), (331), (420), (422) and (511)/(333) originated from the fcc lattice of C60,41,42 indicating that the crystal structure of C60nanofibres could be improved by annealing at a higher temperature. HRTEM image for annealing C60nanofibre (Fig. 4d) also showed improved crystallinity property, and the FFT patterns gave d values of about 0.35 nm and 0.50 nm, in agreement with the reported data for C60 crystals.16

Insets in panel b and panel d are the FFT patterns. 
Based on the above experimental results, the fabrication process and the growth mechanism of C60nanofibres are schematically depicted in Fig. 5a–c. As mentioned, solutions, mixtures, or melts with low surface energies can spread over substances with higher surface energies.31 Due to the high surface energy of the AAO template, the wetting process of the AAO template by C60 solution is rather rapid and thorough. The wetting can be determined by the contact angle (θ) between the liquid and the template surface, since the sign of the pressure difference ΔP across the meniscus formed during contact given by the Young–Laplace equation depends only on cosθ. If θ < 90°, ΔP will be positive and there will be a spontaneous driving force to wet the surface of the nanotubes. As a result the liquid will be adsorbed, and the contact angle is said to be wetting. As can be seen from Fig. 6, the contact angle test data showed that the surface of AAO membranes could be wetting in several seconds by either deionized water or n-hexane with the contact angle below 40° and 10°, respectively. When fullerene solution in organic solvent was dropped onto the surface of the porous alumina membrane, it spread along the surface and gradually wetted the internal walls of the nanopores in a few seconds. For the AAO template with thickness of about 10 micrometres, the wetting process was about 10 seconds, and the calculated wetting rate was about 1μm s−1. After the organic solution containing fullerene entered the template pores, the nanopores could be fully filled from the bottom upwards. As the organic solvent evaporated from the nanopores in air at room temperature for several hours, the remaining C60clusters aggregated in the nanopores and nanofibre arrays were formed. If the solvent was evaporated at a higher temperature, the evaporation time would be shorter.

Photoconductivity study of the C60nanofibre arrays
Dual-layer photoreceptors were fabricated to evaluate the photoconductivity of the C60nanofibres by using the standard photoinduced discharge technique. Table 1 summarizes the photoconductivity of the photoreceptor exposed to visible light (400–800 nm) with an intensity of 1.1 mW cm−2. The photosensitivity of the bulk C60 film on an aluminium substrate was also given for a comparison (No. 1). We can see that the photoreceptor containing the C60nanofibre arrays with 40 nm in diameter and 4 μm in length (No. 2) showed a good photoconductivity with the half-decaying time (t1/2) of 0.86 s and the photosensitivity (S) of 1.058 (mW s)−1 cm2. In contrast, the photoreceptor containing bulk C60 performed poorly with t1/2 >10 s and S < 0.09 (mW s)−1 cm2. The photosensitivity of the C60nanofibre arrays showed an S value of one order of magnitude higher than that of the bulk film. The improved photoconductivity for C60nanofibre arrays in the AAO channels over their bulk counterparts was believed to be induced by the large surface-to-volume ratio and the one-dimensional (1D) continuous charge-carrier channels in the C60nanofibres.

Photoreceptors No. 2–6 in Table 1 consist of C60nanofibre arrays with different sizes. It was found that their photosensitivity decreased with increasing the average diameter and the length of the nanofibres. For example, for the same length of 8 μm, the photosensitivity value increased from 0.541 to 0.594 (mW s)−1 cm2 when the nanofibre diameter decreased from about 80 to 60 nm. While for the same diameter of 80 nm, the photosensitivity could be greatly improved from 0.309 to 0.541 (mW s)−1 cm2 as the nanofibre length reduced from 15 to 8 μm. These results revealed that the photoconductivity of photoreceptors with C60nanofibre arrays as CGL was highly dependent on the diameter and the length of the C60nanofibres. The effect of the nanofibre size on the photosensitivity is thought to be related to the transportation of the photo-generated carriers in the nanofibre arrays. The faster carrier transportation was found in the nanofibres with a smaller diameter and a shorter length.43–45

Fullerene film sandwiches have been studied previously to reveal enhanced photoconductivity as well,46 but the film thickness is around 300 nm. In our case, the thickness of the photoconductive layer is about 4–15 μm. It is reported that the efficiency (0.0002 %) of the three-dimensional bulk heterojunction donor–acceptor-type organic thick film solar cell from C60-nanorods (∼5 μm in length) and regioregular poly-3-octylthiophene is much lower than that (3–5 %) of bulk heterojunction thin film (∼100 nm) organic solar cells.47 The device performance is expected to be further improved by further reducing the photoactive layer to around 100 nm. Although our C60nanofibre arrays are quite long, they still show one order of magnitude higher photosensitivity than that of their bulk thin films. Therefore, if C60nanofibre arrays with a length in hundreds of nm scale could be prepared by using much thinner AAO membrane as template, much higher photosensitivity of the photoconductive devices would be obtained.
Conclusion
In summary, we successfully prepared highly-ordered and well-aligned [60]fullerene nanofibre arrays by introducing the facile template-surface-wetting method. The C60nanofibre arrays exhibited significantly enhanced absorption in the visible region compared to that of its bulk materials. The photosensitivity of the photoreceptors with the highly-ordered fullerene nanoarrays as CGL was improved by one order of magnitude compared to that of their bulk films, demonstrating that the C60 nanoarrays can facilitate the dissociation of the photo-induced excitons and the transportation of charge carriers. The broadened photoresponse and the high photosensitivity may extend and envision the application of C60nanofibre arrays in the field of photovoltaic cells.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  
            FESEM images of the template surface, in which pores are fully filled with C60 from C60 solution in toluenevia the template-surface-wetting method, and the inset in panel (a) gives the morphology of the AAO template used. Panels (b) and (c) give the morphologies of C60nanofibre arrays, acquired following dissolution of the alumina templates in 10% aqueous NaOH. The inset in (c) is the TEM image of the individual C60nanofibre. The EDAX graph and elemental percentage data for the sample in (c) are shown in panel (d).	 

 	Fig. 2  Morphologies of the fullerene films with the AAO templates before (a) and after (b) removing the surface remains by careful polishing using a piece of fine grit sandpaper. FESEM images of C60nanofibre arrays prepared from the C60 solution in benzene (c) and carbon disulfide (d) after removing the alumina template by 10% aqueous NaOH. Inset in (c) gives the side view of the used AAO membrane with several micrometres in length, and the scale bar represents 1 μm.	 

 	Fig. 3  
UV-vis absorption spectra of the C60 solution in toluene (solid line), C60nanofibre arrays (dashed line), and C60nanofibre arrays with C60 bulk film on their surface (dashed dotted line). The curves are normalized at the absorption peak at around 370 nm.	 

 	Fig. 4  
            XRD patterns of C60nanofibres imbedded in AAO membrane on aluminium substrate (top left) and HRTEM image of individual C60nanofibre (top right). XRD patterns (bottom left) for free-standing C60nanofibres and HRTEM image of individual C60nanofibre (bottom right) after annealing at 100 °C for 12 h. Insets in panel b and panel d are the FFT patterns.	 

 	Fig. 5  (I) Schematic preparation process of the C60nanofibre arrays via template-surface-wetting method: a) a drop of C60 organic solution spreads on the surface of the perforated AAO template with a pre-coated Au conductive substrate and gradually fills the template pores; b) with the solvent evaporation, the C60clusters aggregate in the nanopores and form nanofibre arrays; c) free-standing nanofibre arrays after removal of the AAO template with 10% aqueous NaOH solution. (II) The bottom right is the schematic structure of the photoreceptor using C60nanofibre arrays as the charge-generation layer (CGL) and TPD as the charge-transportation layer (CTL). The top right is a typical photoinduced xerographic discharge curve, where V0 is the initial surface charge potential, Rd is dark decay, Vi is surface potential at illumination, t1/2 is half decaying time, and Vr is residual surface charge potential.	 

 	Fig. 6  Contact angle test for the AAO membrane wetting by deionized water (a) and n-hexane (b), respectively.
