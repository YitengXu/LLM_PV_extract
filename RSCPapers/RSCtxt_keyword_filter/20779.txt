    , Accepted 22nd January 2020First published on 22nd January 2020AbstractModulating the heterostructured interface of semiconductor nanocrystals is being widely explored to enhance the charge transfer rate in photoelectrochemical cells. Here we use electrophoretic deposition and a linker-assisted method to fabricate heterostructured photoanodes based on CdSe quantum dots (QDs) or CdSe(S) nanoplates (NPLs)/TiO2 nanoparticles. The semiconductor nanocrystals exhibit red-shifted or dual photoluminescence emissions after electrophoretic deposition, due to the formation of surface traps. The calculated electron transfer rates in CdSe QDs/TiO2 nanoparticle photoanodes fabricated via electrophoretic deposition and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA)-assisted attachment are 5.5 × 107 s−1 and 2.7 × 107 s−1, respectively, which are both higher than those obtained from NPLs/TiO2 nanoparticles ranging from 0.7 × 107 s−1 to 1.3 × 107 s−1. As a proof of concept, we used heterostructured semiconductor nanocrystals/TiO2 nanoparticles as photoanodes for solar-driven hydrogen generation. Upon one sun illumination, the saturated photocurrent densities of photoanodes fabricated via electrophoretic deposition were found to be higher than those of photoanodes prepared via MPA-assisted attachment, while the corresponding photoanode shows inferior long-term photostability due to the formation of surface traps on the QDs or NPLs during the electrophoretic deposition process. These results provide useful information for engineering the surface/dimension/composition of semiconductor nanocrystals, their adsorption on porous TiO2 films, and designing high-efficiency photoelectrodes in photoelectrochemical devices.
1. Introduction
Efficient conversion of solar energy into electricity (solar cells) and solar fuels (e.g. H2 by solar-driven water splitting) is a promising technology to address the current energy crisis.1–7 Thanks to their excellent optoelectronic properties, the use of semiconductor nanocrystals as building blocks in solar technologies has been widely explored.8–18 In particular, colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals, such as quantum dots (QDs), nanorods and two-dimensional nanoplates (NPLs), have been widely explored as light harvesters, sensitizers or antennas in solar technologies. The optoelectronic properties of semiconductor nanocrystals can be controlled by tuning their composition, size, shape, band structure and preparation routes, which provides flexibility for their optimization and design in photovoltaic devices19–21 and photoelectrochemical cells for hydrogen production.22–24
In principle, in the case of QDs/metal oxide heterostructures, upon solar illumination, the photogenerated electron–hole pair in QDs is separated at the QD/metal oxide and QD/electrolyte interfaces. Ideally, the electrons are injected into the metal oxide (such as TiO2, SnO2, or ZnO) film with larger bandgaps (Eg) and flow to the external circuit as electrical energy or for hydrogen generation. The QDs are restored by electron donation from the electrolyte via a redox reaction or the generated holes in the QDs participate in water oxidation.22–24 To date, the power conversion efficiency of QD sensitized solar cells and the solar to hydrogen efficiency in photoelectrochemical cells are still relatively low.25–28 A major challenge is the limited charge transfer rate in the solar cell or photoelectrochemical cell. Charge transfer at various heterostructures in photoelectrochemical cells has been demonstrated, such as CdSe QDs/TiO2, CdS QDs/TiO2, PbS/CdS QDs/TiO2, CuInSeS QDs/TiO2, CdS/CdSe QDs/SnO2, CuInS2/ZnS QDs/ZnO, etc.29–35 These studies, among a series of charge transfer processes, revealed that the electron transfer from the photoexcited semiconductor nanocrystals to the metal oxide is dominated and highly influenced by the corresponding heterostructured interface.36
Several strategies have been developed to engineer the electron transfer rate (ket) at the semiconductor heterostructure interface.31,37 For instance, Kamat's group demonstrated the size-dependent electron injection from CdSe QDs into TiO2 nanoparticles in QD sensitized solar cells,37 showing that CdSe QDs with favorable conduction band energies for electron injection can be obtained by varying the size of QDs due to the quantum size effect. Aside from the investigations of size in semiconductor nanocrystals, Watson et al. demonstrated the influence of the surface linker mercaptoalkanoic acid (MPA) with different alkyl chains on the efficiency of electron transfer at the CdS QDs/TiO2 interface.31 These results suggest that the electron transfer is dependent on the distance between QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles. Thus, the technique to adsorb the semiconductor nanocrystals onto the metal oxide plays an important role in the modulation of the heterostructured interface, leading to efficient electron transfer in the photoelectrochemical cells. In general, aside from the in situ formation of heterostructured photoanodes,38 direct adsorption via van der Waals forces, electrophoretic deposition, and indirect linker-assisted adsorption are commonly used in fabrication of heterostructured photoelectrodes.18,31,39 In previous work, we studied the gradient adsorption dynamics of PbS/CdS QD uptake into a TiO2 film by electrophoretic deposition, which was influenced by the applied electric field and the concentration of QDs.40 Kamat and co-workers monitored the adsorption and electron injection rates of CdSe QDs on TiO2 using MPA-linked adsorption and direct attachment by van der Waals forces.39 The ket observed from the direct attachment by van der Waals forces is higher than that from MPA-linked adsorption, while the aggregation of CdSe QDs on the surface of TiO2 may occur after a long adsorption time, leading to reduced efficiency of electron transfer.39 So far, there are few works on the comparison of ket in semiconductor nanocrystals/metal oxides, formed via indirect linked attachment and direct electrophoretic deposition, which may offer more physical insights into the optimization of heterostructured interfaces in high-efficiency photoelectrochemical cells.
Herein, we describe the effect of using electrophoretic deposition and MPA-assisted linked attachment as deposition techniques on the electron transfer dynamics between semiconductor nanocrystals and TiO2 nanoparticles. Three types of semiconductor nanocrystals with different morphologies and compositions were used: CdSe QDs, CdSe NPLs and alloyed CdSe1−xSx (CdSeS) NPLs. We further investigated their optical properties and calculated the ket in semiconductor nanocrystals/TiO2 nanoparticles under different deposition methods. The estimated ket at the interface between CdSe QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles obtained via electrophoretic deposition and MPA-assisted attachment are 5.5 × 107 s−1 and 2.7 × 107 s−1, respectively, which are both higher than those of NPLs/TiO2 nanoparticles ranging from 0.7 × 107 s−1 to 1.3 × 107 s−1, respectively. As a proof of concept, we compared the photoelectrochemical performance of photoanodes based on semiconductor nanocrystals/TiO2 nanoparticles obtained via two different deposition methods for solar-driven hydrogen generation. The photoanodes fabricated by electrophoretic deposition achieve higher saturated photocurrent density than the photoanodes fabricated by MPA-linked attachment under one sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), yet they exhibit reduced long-term photostability due to the formation of surface defects during electrophoretic deposition. This work provides essential information on engineering the heterostructure of semiconductor nanocrystals/TiO2 photoanodes in photoelectrochemical cells.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Synthesis and morphological characterization of semiconductor nanocrystals
Colloidal CdSe QDs were synthesized via a hot-injection method.41 Fig. S1† shows a representative transmission electron spectroscopy (TEM) image of CdSe QDs. The CdSe QDs have a uniform radius of ∼1.65 nm and narrow size distribution. The d spacing estimated from the inset high resolution TEM (HRTEM) image is ∼0.36 nm, corresponding to the (111) plane of the zinc blende crystal structure, which is consistent with previous work.41 The synthesis of alloyed CdSeS NPLs and CdSe NPLs was adopted from the literature by tuning the feeding ratio of Se/S.17 As shown in Fig. 1a, CdSeS NPLs (Se/S = 1) exhibit a large lateral size in the range of 15–80 nm. The thickness of ∼1.5–1.8 nm (5–6 monolayers) in alloyed NPLs was estimated from the TEM image displayed in Fig. S2,† which matches the value stated in ref. 15 and 17. Similar morphologies are observed in CdSe NPLs and the as-measured d spacing of 0.35 nm is ascribed to the (111) plane of zinc blende CdSe (Fig. S3†). Accordingly, in the CdSeS NPLs, the measured lattice parameter of 0.344 nm lies between the values of the (111) plane in the zinc blende phase of CdS and CdSe, indicating the formation of alloyed CdSeS NPLs.

(b–e) TEM images, HRTEM images and EDS spectra (f) of heterostructured alloyed CdSeS NPLs/TiO2 nanoparticles formed via linker assisted attachment (b and d) and electrophoretic deposition (c and e). The EDS data are collected from the area shown in Fig. 1b and c. 
The morphologies of CdSeS NPLs/TiO2 nanoparticles formed via linker-assisted attachment and electrophoretic deposition are shown in Fig. 1b–e. No significant aggregation of NPLs was found in Fig. 1b–e. From the HRTEM images (Fig. 1d and e), lattice parameters of 0.354 nm/0.351 nm and 0.343 nm/0.341 nm are observed, which are consistent with the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 and the (111) plane of zinc blende CdSeS NPLs, respectively.15,17 Furthermore, the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) spectra of CdSeS NPLs/TiO2 nanoparticles were acquired and are shown in Fig. 1f and S4,† confirming the presence of all elements (Ti, O, Cd, Se and S) in these heterostructures. Moreover, the hybrid heterostructure of CdSe QDs/TiO2 nanoparticles obtained via electrophoretic deposition are shown in Fig. S5,† which shows that the CdSe QDs are uniformly deposited on the TiO2 nanoparticles with no apparent aggregation of CdSe QDs. From the inset HRTEM images of CdSe QDs/TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. S5b†), the lattice parameter of ∼0.36 nm corresponds to the (111) plane of zinc blende crystal structures of CdSe QDs, which is consistent with that of colloidal CdSe QDs. It also indicates the successful fabrication of hybrid CdSe QDs/TiO2 nanoparticle heterostructures for further investigation.
2.2 Optical properties and electron transfer dynamics of heterostructures
Generally, due to one-dimensional quantum confinement, the ultrathin NPLs exhibit thickness-dependent optical properties. As shown in Fig. 2a, in CdSe NPLs, the excitonic absorption peaks at ∼433 and ∼460 nm are ascribed to light-hole and heavy-hole transitions, which was reported in ultrathin NPLs.17 In alloyed CdSeS NPLs, both the absorption and emission peaks are slightly red shifted due to the increase in thickness of NPLs, with respect to the as-synthesized CdSe NPLs. The thickness of CdSe(S) NPLs can be estimated from their absorption spectra, as has been already demonstrated theoretically and experimentally.15,17,42 Based on the excitonic absorption peak positions of CdSe(S) NPLs (Fig. 2a), the thickness of the NPLs corresponds to 5 monolayers in CdSe NPLs and ∼5–6 monolayers in CdSeS NPLs, respectively.17 These results are consistent with the values of thickness in NPLs estimated from HRTEM images. For ultrathin NPLs with a very small Stokes shift, the PL emission peak position of NPLs can be regarded as the position of the band edge (or close band edge), indicating that the bandgaps are 2.67 eV for CdSe NPLs and 2.64 eV for CdSeS NPLs, respectively. In addition, the CdSe QDs exhibit broad absorption over the ultraviolet (UV) and visible (vis) ranges, with a clear absorption peak at a wavelength of 550 nm (Eg, 2.25 eV), which is consistent with the literature.41

(c) Scheme of electron transfer dynamics in the heterostructure interface upon sun illumination. (1) The generated electron in CdSe at the excited state; (2) band to band recombination of electrons; (3) electron injection from the excited state into the TiO2 film; (4) the relaxation of the electron from the excited state to the trap state; (5) trap-assisted recombination of electrons. 
The investigated heterostructured photoanodes were fabricated by incorporating semiconductor nanocrystals into a porous TiO2 film via MPA-assisted attachment or the electrophoretic deposition method, as depicted in Fig. 2b. The upper scheme in Fig. 2b illustrates the adsorption of QDs or NPLs on the MPA modified TiO2 nanoparticles. Briefly, MPA serves as a linker on the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles, which enhances the affinity between QDs or NPLs and TiO2 nanoparticles.36 The porous TiO2 film composed of TiO2 nanoparticles with sizes of 20 and 400 nm on a conductive fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate is immersed in a QD or NPL suspension for 10 h at room temperature to achieve the formation of the nanocrystals/TiO2 heterostructure. Alternatively, in the electrophoretic deposition process, the QDs or NPLs in toluene can move swiftly towards the surface of TiO2 nanoparticles under an opportune applied bias (scheme at the bottom, Fig. 2b).
As mentioned above, the bandgaps of CdSe QDs and CdSe(S) NPLs are in the range of 2.2–2.7 eV, which are smaller than that of bulk anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (3.2 eV).17 According to the band alignment in the heterostructures shown in Fig. 2c, the conduction bands of CdSe QDs and CdSe(S) NPLs are higher than that of anatase TiO2 films,43 suggesting the possible injection of photo-generated electrons into the TiO2 film.
We further investigated the optical properties of heterostructured photoanodes through time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. For comparison, ZrO2 with a wider bandgap and higher conduction band energy level with respect to CdSe QDs and CdSe(S) NPLs was used to prevent electron transfer from QDs or NPLs into ZrO2 in the control experiment.41 As shown in Fig. 3, the PL emission peaks of NPLs after MPA-assisted attachment are almost constant as the samples in the solution, while the PL spectra of NPL samples after electrophoretic deposition are slightly broadened and show a small red-shift due to the formation of surface defects, as summarized in Table 1.44 Differently, the CdSe QD based photoelectrodes fabricated via electrophoretic deposition exhibit dual PL emission with respect to the heterostructure obtained via the linker-assisted method. The emission with a longer wavelength is attributed to trap emission.44,45 Specifically, during the electrophoretic deposition process, defects and traps are formed on the surface of QDs, creating an intermediate state as the trap state in the QDs.44 In this case, the PL emissions are dominated by both band to band transition (2) and trap-assisted recombination (5), resulting in the dual emission (illustrated in Fig. 2c).

In Fig. 4, the PL decay curves of semiconductor nanocrystals in heterostructures are measured and fitted with a triple-exponential function. The corresponding average PL lifetimes (τ) are calculated and summarized in Table S1† using the following equation:41 (1)where ai (i = 1, 2, 3) are the pre-exponential factors of the PL decays and τi (i = 1, 2, 3) are the corresponding characteristic lifetimes, respectively. The estimated PL lifetimes in the semiconductor nanocrystals/ZrO2 heterostructures obtained via electrophoretic deposition are slightly shorter than those of samples with linked MPA, due to the varied distance between semiconductor nanocrystals and ZrO2. As expected, the PL lifetimes in samples incorporated with TiO2 nanoparticles are shorter than those of samples coupled with ZrO2 nanoparticles, indicating efficient electron transfer from semiconductor nanocrystals to TiO2 nanoparticles. In particular, the PL lifetime of the CdSe QDs/TiO2 sample prepared via electrophoretic deposition is nearly half of the value of the sample prepared via MPA-assisted attachment, indicating a strong correlation of the electron transfer dynamics and the distance between QDs and TiO2.

We further calculated ket in the investigated semiconductor nanocrystals/TiO2 samples following the equation:41 (2)where the τQDs, τNPLs/TiO2 and τNPLs/ZrO2 are the PL lifetimes of QDs, NPLs/TiO2, and NPLs/ZrO2, respectively. As shown in Table 2, ket exhibits no apparent difference in the NPL based samples prepared via the two deposition methods. However, in the CdSe QDs/TiO2 sample prepared via electrophoretic deposition, the ket of 5.5 ± 0.7 × 107 s−1 is almost two-fold higher than the value (2.7 ± 0.2 × 107 s−1) in the sample prepared via MPA-assisted attachment, even if there are many surface traps formed in CdSe QDs during electrophoretic deposition. This implies that the electron transfer at the QDs/TiO2 interface is much more dependent on the distance between QDs and TiO2 than that of ultrathin NPLs/TiO2 samples. A possible reason is that, in the ultrathin NPLs, the electrons and holes are quantum confined in only one dimension15 while they are confined in three dimensions in QDs with very small size.33 The electron transfer rate in the NPL based sample is dominated by the electron transfer in the lateral dimension of NPLs rather than the radial direction. Therefore, the ligand on the surface of TiO2 will not significantly affect the rate of electron transfer in NPLs.

2.3 Photoelectrochemical performance
As a proof of concept, we fabricated photoanodes based on CdSe QDs, CdSeS NPLs and CdSe NPLs via electrophoretic deposition and linker-assisted attachment for solar-driven hydrogen generation. The details of fabrication procedures are described in the Experimental section. The distribution of CdSeS NPLs in the porous TiO2 film is monitored as an example via using cross-section scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging and related EDS mapping. In Fig. S6 and S7,† the thicknesses of the as-prepared photoanodes measured via tape-casting are in the range of 8 to 10 μm. The corresponding EDS mapping spectra confirm the presence of elements (Cd, Se and S) in the TiO2 films. In the EDS line mapping spectrum of the photoanode fabricated via MPA-assisted attachment, the signals of the elements (Cd, Se and S) are found to be evenly distributed in the cross-section area, indicating a uniform dispersion of CdSeS NPLs in the TiO2 film. In contrast, the signals of CdSeS NPLs are more concentrated near the surface of the photoanode fabricated via electrophoretic deposition. There are different possible explanations for this phenomenon: on the one hand, the stronger signals may be induced by the aggregation of NPLs on the surface of the TiO2 film; on the other hand, it can be attributed to the gradient loading amounts of NPLs in the film. A higher deposition loading of NPLs can be found near the surface of the porous TiO2 film rather than the area close to the FTO substrate. A similar adsorption dynamics was also observed in QDs/TiO2 photoanodes fabricated via electrophoretic deposition.40 Hence, it indicates that the heterostructure of CdSeS NPLs (CdSe QDs)/TiO2 nanoparticles is successfully achieved using both MPA-assisted attachment and electrophoretic deposition.
Based on the type II band alignment of the heterostructured CdSe QDs or CdSe(S) NPLs/TiO2 nanoparticle films, upon solar illumination, the electrons generated in CdSe QDs or CdSe(S) NPLs can be injected into TiO2 and move through the counter electrode for hydrogen generation. The photogenerated holes will participate in a redox reaction in the electrolyte and be consumed by the hole scavengers (Na2S and NaSO3) in this system (Fig. S8†). A three-electrode system composed of the working electrode (heterostructured photoanodes), Pt counter electrode and Ag/AgCl (saturated with KCl) reference electrode is used in the photoelectrochemical measurements. To prevent the photocorrosion of photoanodes, a ZnS layer with a larger bandgap is overcoated on the photoanodes via a successive ionic layer absorption reaction.18,41
As shown in Fig. 5a, a saturated photocurrent density of ∼6 mA cm−2 is obtained for the CdSe QDs/TiO2 photoanode prepared via electrophoretic deposition at 0.8 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) under one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), which is three times higher than the value (∼1.7 mA cm−2) of the photoanode made via MPA-assisted attachment. This result is in agreement with the corresponding electron transfer rates in CdSe QDs/TiO2 photoanodes fabricated via the two deposition methods. Although the surface traps are created in CdSe QDs during electrophoretic deposition, which may hinder the electron transfer in the photoelectrochemical cell, the direct attachment of QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles accelerates the electron transfer from QDs to TiO2 nanoparticles, leading to improved photoelectrochemical performance. In addition, the electron transfer rates in CdSe(S) NPLs/TiO2 photoanodes are not significantly affected by the deposition approaches, as summarized in Table 2. The saturated photocurrent densities in CdSe(S) NPL/TiO2 photoanodes fabricated via electrophoretic deposition (3 mA cm−2 for CdSe NPLs and 3.2 mA cm−2 for CdSeS NPLs, respectively) are both higher than the values in photoanodes fabricated via MPA-assisted attachment (Fig. 5b and c). In this case, the adsorption of NPLs on porous TiO2 films using electrophoretic deposition and MPA-assisted attachment should be considered. The NPLs with a large lateral size do not easily diffuse into a low porosity TiO2 film. Compared to MPA-assisted attachment, electrophoretic deposition provides a stronger driving force to allow more NPLs to deposit onto the TiO2 film. The concentrated deposition of NPLs near the surface of the TiO2 film will lead to more efficient consumption of holes by the hole scavenger in the electrolyte, reducing the recombination of electrons and holes. Thus, the as-fabricated photoanodes with higher loading amounts of NPLs absorb more sunlight and achieve higher saturated photocurrent densities (Fig. S9†).

(d) Measured photocurrent density ratio as a function of illumination time at 0.8 V vs. RHE under one sun illumination for CdSeS NPL based photoanodes via different depositions. 
Moreover, we investigated the photostability of photoanodes based on CdSeS NPLs fabricated via the two deposition methods. Fig. 5d displays the photocurrent density ratio as a function of illumination time at 0.8 V vs. RHE under one sun illumination for CdSeS NPL based photoanodes. The photocurrent density in photoanodes fabricated via electrophoretic deposition quickly drops to 70% of the initial value after 500 s of continuous AM 1.5 G sun illumination. Meanwhile, for the photoanode fabricated via MPA-assisted attachment, the photocurrent density still maintains 85% of its initial value, even after 2500 s of illumination. Typically, in this kind of photoelectrochemical system, photocorrosion occurs when photogenerated holes are not consumed by the hole scavenger but are rather trapped in the NPLs. As demonstrated in Fig. 2c and 3, after electrophoretic deposition, surface traps or defects are created in the NPLs, which accumulate the photogenerated holes in the surface of NPLs and reduce the long-term photostability. Photocorrosion can be alleviated by introducing an inorganic or organic passivation layer on the surface of NPLs or a photocatalyst to increase the hole transfer rate.
3. Conclusions and perspectives
In summary, we fabricated heterostructured photoanodes using CdSe QDs and CdSe(S) NPLs incorporated in TiO2 nanoparticles via electrophoretic deposition and MPA-assisted attachment. The optical properties and electron transfer dynamics at the interface of the photoanodes were investigated. The calculated ket in CdSe QDs/TiO2 nanoparticle heterostructures formed via electrophoretic deposition and MPA-assisted attachment are 5.5 × 107 s−1 and 2.7 × 107 s−1, respectively, which are correlated to the distance between QDs and TiO2 nanoparticles. Differently, the electron transfer rate in NPLs/TiO2 nanoparticles (ranging from 0.7 × 107 s−1 to 1.3 × 107 s−1) is not significantly affected by the deposition methods. As a proof of concept, CdSe QDs or CdSe(S) NPLs/TiO2 photoanodes were used for solar-driven hydrogen generation. In the photoanodes prepared by electrophoretic deposition, the obtained saturated photocurrent density is higher than that of the photoanodes fabricated using MPA-assisted attachment. However, the photocorrosion due to the surface traps generated in the semiconductor nanocrystals during electrophoretic deposition reduces the long-term photostability of the photoanode. This can be alleviated by introducing a passivation layer or photocatalyst in the photoanode.19 In the case of NPLs, the large lateral dimension blocks their sufficient adsorption on the porous TiO2 film, resulting in a lower photocurrent density. Small lateral sized NPLs or nanodisks with a broad absorption range will be favorable in high efficiency photoelectrochemical cells. This work paves the way for the optimization and design of heterostructured interfaces via deposition methods, compositions and morphologies of semiconductor nanocrystals in solar technologies.

Colloidal CdSe QDs were synthesized via a hot-injection method.41 TOPO (1 g) and Cd-oleate (0.38 mmol, 1 mL) were added into ODE (8 mL) and the mixture was purged with N2 gas at room temperature for 30 min. Then the reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C and kept for 30 min under vacuum before being restored under a N2 atmosphere. With the temperature increased to 300 °C, a mixture of TOP-Se (4 mmol, 4 mL), OLA (3 mL) and ODE (1 mL) at room temperature was swiftly injected into the former reaction system under vigorous stirring. The reaction was quickly quenched in an ice bath after injection. Ethanol was used to wash the final product twice and precipitate it. The as-prepared CdSe QDs were dispersed in toluene.


4.2.2 Synthesis of CdSe(S) NPLs. 
Typically,17 for the synthesis of CdSe(S) NPLs, Cd(CH3CO2)2·2H2O (960 mg) was added and mixed with 90 mL of ODE and 2.6 mL of OA and kept under vacuum at 110 °C for 90 min. Se powder (156 mg) {Se powder (120 mg) and S powder (48 mg) for synthesis of CdSeS NPLs} dissolved in 4 mL of ODE was injected into the reaction flask. The reaction mixture was heated to 240 °C with N2 gas. As the temperature rose to 205 °C (193 °C), 480 mg (720 mg) of Cd(CH3CO2)2·2H2O was added. The reaction mixture was kept for 15 min at 240 °C and was then cooled to room temperature. OA (5 mL) and toluene (15 mL) were added during the cooling process. The precipitates were collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min, and washed using hexane twice. The CdSe(S) NPLs were redispersed and stored in hexane.

4.3 Preparation of porous TiO2 and ZrO2 films41
In general, FTO glass substrates were cleaned and sonicated in a mixture of ethanol, methanol and IPA (1:1:1, v/v/v) for 30 min, then rinsed with distilled water and dried using N2 gas.

TiO2 film. 
A thin and continuous TiO2 layer was spin coated on the FTO substrate using the solution of Ti-Nanoxide BL/SC (at 2000 r.p.m. for 30 s). The above-mentioned substrates were then annealed at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature naturally. Then, a commercial TiO2 paste (18 NR-AO) was deposited on the TiO2 compact layer coated FTO substrates via the tape-casting technique and dried under ambient conditions for 15 min. The TiO2 photoanodes were heated on a hot plate at 120 °C for 6 min. The as-prepared mesoporous TiO2 photoanodes were sintered at 500 °C for 30 min and cooled to room temperature for further use.


ZrO2 film. 
Briefly, a commercial ZrO2 paste was used to coat a single layer of ZrO2 on the cleaned FTO substrate via the tape-casting technique. Then the ZrO2 film was annealed at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature naturally.

4.4 Fabrication of heterostructure photoanodes via electrophoretic deposition and MPA-assisted attachment

Electrophoretic deposition. 
41
Typically, two slides of TiO2 or ZrO2/FTO substrates were placed with a distance of 1 cm in the suspension of CdSe QDs or CdSe(S) NPLs with a applied bias of 200 V for 30 min. Then the slides were rinsed with toluene to remove excess QDs or NPLs on the substrates and dried with N2 gas for further use.


MPA-assisted attachment. 
39
First, TiO2 or ZrO2 films were immersed in HCl solution with pH of 2 for 20 min, rinsed with DI water until pH of 7, then rinsed once with acetonitrile and dried with N2 gas. The aforementioned TiO2 or ZrO2/FTO substrates were immersed in 1 M MPA/acetonitrile solution for 10 h and washed with acetonitrile and toluene separately. Third, the MPA treated TiO2 or ZrO2/FTO substrates were immersed in a suspension of QDs or NPLs at room temperature for 10 h. The QDs or NPLs incorporated in TiO2 or ZrO2 films were washed with toluene to remove the residual QDs or NPLs on the surface and then dried with N2 gas for further use.
In the photoelectrochemical measurements,18 two cycles of ZnS coating were performed on the heterostructure photoanodes via a successive ionic layer absorption reaction. Specifically, the as-prepared QDs or NPLs/TiO2 photoanodes were immersed in a solution of Zn(CH3CO2)2 (0.1 M) and methanol for 1 min and rinsed with methanol for 30 s, then immersed in a solution of Na2S (0.1 M) and methanol/H2O (1:1 v/v) for 1 min and rinsed with methanol/H2O for 30 s. The procedure was repeated once and the photoanodes were dried using N2 gas. Finally, the edges and the surface (excluding the active area) of the photoanodes were covered with epoxy for further testing.

4.5 Characterization
TEM and HRTEM images were collected using a JEOL 2100F TEM. SEM images and EDS mapping spectra were obtained with a FEI Sirion high resolution SEM system equipped with an Atmospheric Thin Window (ATW) EDS detector. UV–vis absorption spectra were measured by using a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR spectrometer (Varian). The PL spectra and PL lifetime of QDs, NPLs in solution and film samples were measured via a Fluorolog®-3 system (Horiba Jobin Yvon).
In the photoelectrochemical measurements,18 a three electrode system was used, including the as-fabricated photoanodes as the working electrode, a Pt counter electrode and an Ag/AgCl (saturated with KCl solution) reference electrode. The electrolyte solution contains 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3 with pH of ∼13. All potentials were measured with respect to the Ag/AgCl reference electrode during photoelectrochemical tests and were converted to the RHE scale using the following equation VRHE = VAg/AgCl + 0.197 + pH × (0.059). Photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted using an electrochemical station (CHI-760D with 20 mV s−1 sweep rate) and a Sciencetech SLB-300A solar simulator (AM1.5 G, 100 mW cm−2).
