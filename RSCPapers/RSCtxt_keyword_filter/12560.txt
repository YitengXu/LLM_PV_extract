, Accepted 13th May 2023First published on 17th May 2023AbstractThe development of nonfullerene electron acceptors (NFEAs) is a landmark advance in the field of organic solar cells (OSCs). To achieve better light utilization and greater efficiencies of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type and analog acceptors, various decorations of central π-backbones, side chains, and endcaps have been intensively conducted, which has promoted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) to over 19% in single bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells recently. Among the multiple decoration approaches, π-bridge engineering provides a facile but effective strategy to manipulate the molecular energy levels, photo-physical properties, molecular aggregation, and the final photovoltaic performance. The π-bridge strategy has received long-term attention and achieved marvellous progress with respect to increasing the PCE and expanding the applications of NFEAs. However, the efficiencies of π-bridged acceptors are still far behind those of their rigid counterparts at this stage. Despite the great challenges, the intrinsic merits of π-bridges provide great potential to mark a breakthrough in PCE, by rationally designing and employing the π-bridge strategy in the design of NFEAs. Meanwhile, the high availability of π-bridges for constructing ultra-small bandgap acceptors with intense near-infrared (NIR) absorptivity provides a great basis for NIR-related organic devices, for example, the tandem OSCs, semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs), and organic photodetectors (OPDs). In this review, we first screened the development of typical π-bridged small molecular acceptors in different NFEA communities, attempting to confirm the advantages and disadvantages of the current π-bridged NFEAs. In the end, the current challenges and possible strategies for π-bridge engineering in advancing the development of NFEAs are discussed, from the viewpoints of PCE breakthroughs, NIR-absorbing acceptors, and critical conformation interconversion in the family of π-bridged NFEAs.Fan FengFan Feng received his Bachelor's degree from Qingdao University of Science & Technology in 2021.

1. Introduction
As an emerging photovoltaic technology, organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted widespread attention due to their advantages of flexibility, low-cost, easy-manufacturing and semitransparency. These advantages endow organic photovoltaics with promising applications in the fields of wearable devices and intelligent windows.1–5 Encouragingly, benefiting from the innovative development of photovoltaic materials, charge transport layers, and device fabrication technologies, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs have exceeded 19% in single cells and reached 20% in tandem devices, suggesting their great promise in future industrialization.6–14
Dating back to 1958, Kearns and Calvin15 discovered the photovoltaic effect in organic systems based on laminated solar cells, which led researchers into a new inspiring field. In 1986, Tang et al.16 reported the first OSC device with a PCE of 1%, ascribed to insufficient donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces in the bilayer photoactive layer where the photo-excited excitons (bound hole–electron pairs) were separated. Excitons in organic semiconductors are usually more strongly bound (with a Coulombic attraction of ∼0.5 eV) owing to the relatively small dielectric constants of organics. Therefore, sufficient D/A interfaces with an appropriate energy offset are required to form built-in potential to facilitate the dissociation of excitons. To solve this critical problem, Heeger and coworkers created the concept of a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) by coating the blending solutions of donor and acceptor materials.17,18 In the BHJ networks, the donor and acceptor form numerous p–n junctions, which provide sufficient D/A interfaces to dissociate excitons and then transport the resultant electrons and holes through comparatively independent channels to electrodes. In recent years, researchers have gradually realized the importance of vertical phase separation in suppressing charge recombination losses for greater efficiencies. Therefore, other structural active layers, such as the pseudo-planar heterojunction (PPHJ), were developed to enhance the somehow undeveloped phase separation gradient in BHJ systems. Nevertheless, the overall microstructures of these newly reported technologies basically follow those of BHJs.19–24
Besides the reform of device architectures, the molecular structures of donors and acceptors have undergone several revolutions. Heeger and coworkers25 reported photo-induced electron transfer from an excited conjugated polymer (MEH-PPV) to fullerene C60 in 1992. C60 has high electron affinity and large electron mobility in 3D, which enables the electrons produced from polymers to be transferred to C60 effectively. This discovery established the dominance of fullerene and its derivatives as acceptors in the following two decades. During this period, research on OSCs focused on developing narrow bandgap donor materials with broad absorption to match the low absorptivity fullerene acceptors.26–29 The representative donor PBDTTT-C can afford a high PCE of 6.58% when matched with PC70BM.30 However, the inextricable demerits of fullerene acceptors such as a narrow absorption region and low extinction coefficient (ε) restrict the boost of short-circuit current density (JSC) and PCE of the resultant solar cells. Meanwhile, the requirement of a large energy level offset (>0.3 eV) between donors and fullerenes to separate the strong bonded excitons of fullerenes places severe limitations on the design of narrow bandgap donors, which is disadvantageous to harvesting more lower-energy photons. Therefore, most of the typical high-performance fullerene-based OSCs (PCEs over 10%) afford a moderate JSC lower than 16 mA cm−2.
To overcome the shortcomings of fullerenes, researchers came up with the concept of nonfullerene electron acceptors (NFEAs).31–36 With the progressive development of design principles, NFEAs primarily underwent three exciting periods, including the perylene diimide (PDI)-series analogs, ITIC-series analogs, and Y6-series analogs. The chemical structures of the representative molecules of PDI, ITIC, and Y6 are displayed in Fig. 1a. Among them, the ITIC-series analog and Y-series analog acceptors could be collected into one category, which is characterized by fused-ring molecules, rigid molecular planarity and a strong intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect. To some extent, the ITIC-series acceptors open a brand-new door for the prosperous development of NFEAs and thus OSCs, and the Y-series acceptors have enabled progress to take a big step forward. From PCBM to ITIC-series and Y6-series, absorption has been accordingly extended, with the corresponding PCEs increased from the levels of ∼10% to ∼15% and ∼19%. Therefore, the extension of absorption should be one key factor in maximizing the light utilization and boosting efficiencies, with the cooperative optimization of heterojunction morphologies, exciton/charge behaviors and energy loss. To reduce the optical bandgaps of NFEAs for broader absorption, the ICT effect should be enhanced. As depicted in Fig. 1b, the strong interaction between the D and A moieties brings new hybridized molecular orbitals with upshifted highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and downshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels, and thus reduced bandgaps in the resulting molecules. In order to enhance this hybridization, two strategies are generally frequently employed, involving the central part π-cores and distal end-caps. Regarding π-core engineering, enhancing the electron-rich feature or extending the π-conjugation length could facilitate the ICT effect and reduce the bandgaps by elevating the HOMO. Meanwhile, similar molecular structures usually guarantee good molecular stacking and charge mobilities. However, extension of π-backbones could greatly raise the synthetic complexity, and reduce the solubilities and film-form kinetics of the acceptors and active layers. More desperately, the regulation effect could be limited when the number of fused rings reaches a certain degree. Taking an example, Zhan and coworkers systematically studied the effect of core size of A–D–A fused-ring acceptors.37–39 They synthesized a series of NFEAs end-capped with 2-(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile (DCI-2F) and cored with increasing numbers of thiophene, namely F5IC, F7IC, F9IC, and F11IC.39 Increasing core size from 5 to 11 fused rings raised the corresponding HOMO energy level from −5.82 to −5.44 eV and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level from −4.05 to −3.94 eV. Relative to F5IC, the increased number of thiophene rings red-shifts the film absorption of F7IC by approximately 40 nm. However, continued increasing generates negligible changes in absorption and bandgaps, but results in decreased solubilities. Especially for F11IC, its poor solubility is an obstacle in constructing solar cells. Similar tendencies were also discovered in the Y6-series analogs. Besides, the photo-stability can also worsen with the extension of conjugation,40 and core engineering plays a negligible role in the modulation of absorption as the number of rings exceeds seven. In terms of the ITIC and Y6 acceptors, the onset wavelengths of absorption are limited to 778 nm and 931 nm, respectively, leaving much room for further improvement (Fig. 1c). In comparison with central core modification, end-cap engineering is intensively employed to manipulate the energy levels and bandgaps.41–43 The most successful approach is halogen substitution.44–48 With the introduction of halogen atoms on the benzene or thiophene motif of end-caps, the LUMO levels of acceptors could significantly downshift, giving markedly reduced bandgaps. Meanwhile, the halogen atoms on the endcaps could enhance intermolecular interactions and molecular stacking, which is helpful to enhancing the charge mobilities and suppressing charge recombination processes. However, the choice of end-caps has been largely limited to dicycanovinylindan1-one (DCI) and analogs, even though other terminal units have been used sporadically. The reaction sites on the current end-caps are also limited and poly-halogenations are still difficult to realize.

Alternatively, the π-bridge strategy is a more cost-effective approach to enrich the families of NFEAs and modulate the molecular orbitals and bandgaps. The π-bridge is a conjugated group that connects alternating electron-deficient and electron-rich units together in NFEAs. The electronic properties of π-bridge motifs and side groups attached to them can bring fascinating evolutions. π-Bridges have close relationships with ICT and the planarity of molecules, producing versatile manipulations in absorption, energy levels, molecular conformations, and molecular stacking. The π-bridge strategy has long been employed in constructing D–A donor materials to reduce the steric hindrance between D and A moieties and distortion of the molecular planes.49–57 Likewise, it plays a full-chain significance in NFEAs including those of the PDI-series, ITIC-series, and Y6-series acceptors. However, even identical π-bridges may dictate opposite regulations in varied molecular systems. Therefore, in this review, we try to screen the π-bridges in the NFEA communities, emphasizing their variations and multidimensional functions in adjusting photophysical, energetic, and molecular aggregation properties and the photovoltaic conversion of OSCs. Besides, some representative examples with unique π-bridge chemical structures, linker positions, functions, and research perspectives are described in detail. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of the π-bridge strategy at the current stage are discussed, with the aim of boosting the photovoltaic efficiencies or expanding the application potential of the π-bridge strategy in OSCs. The chemical structures of typical polymer donors discussed in this review are collected in Fig. 2.

2. π-Bridges in PDI-based NFEAs
PDI was first known as a kind of pigment in the 1910s, and was employed in OSCs pioneered by Tang and coworkers.16,58,59 Owing to their satisfactory electron structures and photophysical properties, PDI and its analogs were the most effective NFEAs before the birth of ITIC. In the PDI monomer, the large π-conjugated molecular plane endows strong π–π intermolecular interactions and thus decent electron transfer capacity.60,61 However, the excessive π–π interactions of the conjugated skeleton afford strong self-aggregation in the solid state, which results in severe phase-separation and high charge recombination loss in the active layer. Therefore, the primary task for PDIs is to regulate the aggregation behaviors in order to balance the molecular assembly and BHJ morphologies. π-Bridges play a big role in the manipulations and have enabled the steady improvement of PCEs from 1% to ∼10%. In that period, various chemical structures and conformations of PDIs, including streamlined, star-shaped, and even topological structures, were developed, which greatly boosted the development of NFEAs. In terms of the linker positions, the three sites of bay-, ortho-, and imide-are generally considered, which give distinguished properties of the resultant PDIs. The corresponding energy levels, bandgaps, and photovoltaic parameters are shown in Table 1.

The previous studies from Narayan and coworkers62 evidently exhibited the vast differences between PDI monomer and the twist dimer (Fig. 4a). To avoid strong aggregation of the monomer PDI (2), the researchers directly linked two monomers at their imide-positions and reported dimer PDI (1). The results showed that with PBDTTT-C-T as the donor, the monomer PDI exhibited a very low short-circuit current density (JSC) of 0.8 mA cm−2 at 1.2 suns exposure and a small PCE of 0.13%. Encouragingly, the twist conformation of the dimer gave a notably improved JSC of 9.5 mA cm−2 with PCE increased to 2.78%. The morphology studies based on optical images of blend films showed that the perylene phase in a PBDTTT-C-T:2 blend separated from the polymer phase, giving rise to large scale phase separation with micrometer-sized PDI crystals. This finding apparently suggests the significance of limiting self-aggregation of PDIs. At the imide-position, a tetraphenylmethane (TPC) central core was used to bridge four PDIs and a star molecule Me-PDI4 was reported (Fig. 3b), which afforded a PCE of 2.73% coupled with PBDTTT-C-T.63 Although effective in modulating the aggregation behavior, functionalization at imide-positions has little effect on the electronic and optical behaviors of the resultant acceptors.

In comparison, bridging at the bay-position has proven not only effective in suppressing the aggregation of PDIs, but effective in chemistry modification. Although equally promising to regulate the aggregation of PDIs, modification at the ortho-position is less effective and requires complex synthetic conditions. Thus, modification at bay-positions is the most widely employed approach to designing new PDI-series acceptors.64–67 For example, Zhan and coworkers68 pioneered the insertion of one thiophene bridge to link two PDI monomers (Fig. 3c). Compared to the monomeric precursor, the resulting NFEA Bis-PDI-T-EG had an extended absorption band, upshifted energy levels, and appropriate phase domains, collectively contributing to a markedly enhanced PCE from 0.13% to 4.03%. These improvements are attributed to the collective regulation of the π-bridge of electronic and spatial effects. Later, manifold bridges, e.g. benzene, thiophene, bithiophene, and spirobifluorene, were employed to construct similar dimers. Three-arm molecules were further developed. In 2016, Li and coworkers69 reported a star-shaped acceptor B(PDI)3 with a benzene central bridge and three PDI arms (Fig. 3c). The highly distorted B(PDI)3 molecular configuration remarkably restricts the self-aggregation of PDIs and produced an appropriate BHJ morphology, leading to a high PCE of 5.65% with a narrow bandgap with PTB7 as the donor. However, the high steric hindrance of H–H interactions between the benzene core and PDI arms significantly broke the planarity of the PDI backbones, which is detrimental to efficient charge transport. Therefore, Yan and coworkers70 employed 1,3,5-triazine as an electron-deficient core to bridge the PDIs. The resultant acceptor Ta-PDI reduced the serious conflict between molecular stacking and compatibility with the donor. As a result, a higher PCE of up to 9.15% was recorded from Ta-PDI based solar cells. Besides, a triphenylphosphine monoxide (TPO) unit was used as the core bridge to design the acceptor TPO-PDI.71 4,4′-Biphenol (BPO) was introduced into the Ta-PDI based blend as a solid additive to build intermolecular hydrogen bonds for enhanced crystallinity and charge transport. With PTTEA as donor, TPO-PDI based OSCs delivered an impressive fill factor of 75% and PCE of 11.01%, which is one of the highest among π-bridged PDIs. Furthermore, various four PDI-armed acceptors were reported as well. Taking 4PDI-ZnP (Fig. 3c) as an example, the metal atom on the porphyrin core endows the acceptor with a pronounced charge transport capacity, and the p-phenylene bridge brings additional steric interference and limits the conjugation effect between PDI and porphyrin moieties.72 Consequently, the separate absorptions of PDI and porphyrin subunits were preserved, which enlarges the absorption range for greater light utilization efficiency, and led to the record PCE of 9.64% from PTB7-Th:4PDI-ZnP based solar cells. Another four PDI-armed acceptor TZ-PDI with electron-deficient bisthiazole as the core bridge was reported by Peng and coworkers73 (Fig. 5). TZ-PDI exhibited strong absorption of high-energy photons, suitable energy levels, and an amorphous nature, which led to a functional parallel charge generation sub-channel without disturbing the nanostructure of the PM6:Y6 host matrix. Finally, the parallel connected ternary blend of PM6:Y6:TZ-PDI achieved an improved PCE of 17.52% compared to the host binary blend with a best PCE of 16.12%. This result suggests the successful regulation of ternary systems of π-bridged PDIs.

From this short review of π-bridges in PDI-series acceptors, three conclusions can be drawn. Firstly, the π-bridge is decisive in manipulating the acceptor self-aggregation and phase-separation behaviors, which are the primary driving force for the PCE increase from 0.13% to over 11%. Secondly, twisting the molecular configuration to suppress the excessive aggregation of PDI-based acceptors is the critical principle, however maintaining partially satisfactory molecular stacking for efficient charge transport should be kept in mind as well. Thus, properly designing π-bridged cores to achieve a reasonable trade-off is all-important to generate appropriate BHJ networks with decent charge transport and limit recombination losses for the final high efficiencies. Thirdly, the electronic properties (electron-deficient or electron-rich) of the π-bridged cores could moderately modulate the energy levels and photophysical properties of the resultant acceptors. However, this impact could be minor in that the significant distorted molecular plane makes it difficult for the electrons to be delocalized between cores and PDI arms. Unlike the PDI-series, greater differences could be found among planar A–D–A type NFEAs as we will discuss below.
3. π-Bridges in ITIC-based NFEAs
ITIC-Based NFEAs feature good A–D–A arranged π-skeleton planarity, which dictates decent molecular stacking for electron transport, and a strong ICT effect for broad absorptions. Meanwhile, several (usually four) lateral side groups, e.g. alkyl, alkylphenyl, and phenylalkyl, are introduced and attached to the sp3-carbon of the central core. The lateral side chains can not only provide decent solubility and film-forming capacity in the fabrication of OSCs, but also regulate the molecular packing via out-of-plane steric hindrance to obtain an appropriate trade-off between crystallinity of the materials and miscibility of the active layer (Fig. 6). From this viewpoint, the π-bridges here somehow take less responsibility for manipulating the aggregation behaviors, which are fairly different from those applied in PDI-series acceptors. Instead, as discussed above, the π-bridges with different electronic properties play pronounced roles in modulating the molecular energy levels, bandgaps, and absorption profiles of A–D–A acceptors. Therefore, in the following section, we will talk about the impacts of π-bridges in categories, from the perspective of electronic properties. The corresponding energy levels, bandgaps, and photovoltaic parameters of related NFEAs are shown in Table 2.

3.1 ITIC-based NFEAs carrying electron-rich π-bridges
Based on the simplified indacenodithiophene (IDT) and its analog cores, we summarize the representative NFEAs bearing electron-rich π-bridges in Fig. 7, and divide them into three regions. The grey region collects the different π-bridges, including thiophene, selenophen, furan, pyrrole, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TbT), thiophene, and three-ring fused cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene (CDT) structures.75 The green region includes some A–π–D–π–A acceptors with the frequently used thiophene π-bridge. In this section, we will focus on describing the regulation by side chains of π-bridges of molecular energy levels, absorptions, molecular stacking, and photovoltaic performance. The orange region gives some A–π–D–π–A acceptors based on other four/five-ring fused cores. Considering the complex combinations of backbones, lateral side groups, and endcaps, herein, we chose the relatively simple IDT-based A–D–A backbone to describe the story of π-bridges.
 Fig. 7  Representative A–π–D–π–A acceptors with the IDT (and analogous) core and electron-rich π-bridges. 
IDT-IC, which is a typical five-ring fused A–D–A type acceptor, is employed for comparison.76 To further extend π-conjugation, two thiophene bridges were inserted between the IDT core and endcaps, giving the pioneering A–π–D–π–A acceptor DC-IDT2T reported by Zhan and coworkers.77 The computational results demonstrated that the HOMO is delocalized on the π-bridges due to the elongation of the conjugation system. The film of DC-IDT2T has an onset wavelength of absorption at 800 nm and corresponding reduced Eoptg of 1.55 eV, compared to that of IDT-IC (Eoptg of 1.72 eV). With PBDTTT-C-T as the donor, DC-IDT2T delivers a greater PCE of 3.93% than the IDT-IC counterpart (PTB7-Th as donor, PCE = 3.16%). IEIC with two branched alkyls attached on the thiophene bridges was later designed.78 The distortion of the backbone arising from the significant steric hindrance between alkyl chains and IDT core partly cancelled the contribution of π-conjugation extension, leading to comparable absorption profiles and bandgaps with DC-IDT2T. Encouragingly, the imposed long branched alkyls increased the solubility and film-forming ability of the acceptor, which enhanced the miscibility with the polymer donor PTB7-Th and generated a much higher PCE of up to 6.31%. The π-bridged acceptors DC-IDT2T and IEIC provided a precursory and effective avenue to constructing new NFEAs with tunable properties and photovoltaic performance. Based on the thiophene bridge, considerable decorations of IEIC gave birth to a series of high-performance NFEAs. The most popular approach is to modify the atoms of side groups bonded to the thiophene bridge. By switching the alkyl chains to alkoxy side chains, Hou and coworkers79 reported a notable narrow bandgap acceptor IEICO. Firstly, the strong electron-donating alkoxy chains on the thiophene spacer greatly raised the electron cloud density of the π-bridge, affording an enhanced ICT effect from the electron-rich D and π-bridge to the bilateral endcaps. Meanwhile, the intramolecular S⋯O non-covalent bond between alkoxy and IDT core improves the coplanarity of the overall π-backbone, further enhancing the ICT process as well as molecular packing for efficient charge transport. Benefitting from a stronger ICT effect, IEICO has a large absorption onset of 925 nm with a corresponding low Eoptg of 1.34 eV, which is 0.17 eV smaller than that of IEIC. The extended absorption is beneficial for photon capture, and a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 66% was yielded at 810 nm. Besides, compared to IEIC, the HOMO energy level of IEICO is remarkably lifted while the LUMO level experiences a relatively small downshift, which is reasonable according to the theory of molecular orbitals and helpful in maintaining a satisfactory VOC. The researchers also found relatively stronger phase separation in the PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO active layer, providing appropriate interfaces for exciton dissociation. As a result, the PCE of the PBDTTT-E-T:IEICO based device reached 8.4% with a high JSC of 17.7 mA cm−2. By fluorination on the endcaps of IEICO, Hou and coworkers reported another A–π–D–π–A type acceptor IEICO-4F with a further enhanced ICT effect and reduced Eoptg as low as 1.24 eV.80 The introduction of strong electron-deficient units delivered a larger downshift of the LUMO level than the HOMO level, which reduced the VOC. Encouragingly, the significant extension of the absorption spectrum is conducive to producing a greater photocurrent. The researchers used a series of different polymeric donors in the fabrication of OSCs, all of which yielded high JSC values over 20 mA cm−2 with low energy losses of approximately 0.5 eV. Specifically, the PBDTTT-EFT:IEICO-4F and J52:IEICO-4F devices yielded PCEs of 10.0% and 9.4%, respectively, with respective JSC values of 22.8 and 21.9 mA cm−2. Notably, the ternary cell achieved more uniform photon utilization, giving a greater PCE of 10.9% with impressive JSC values up to 25.3 mA cm−2, which were the highest JSC values during that period. Zhang and coworkers81 employed sulphur atoms to replace the oxygen atoms on π-spacers of IEICO-4F and reported an alkylthio-substituted thiophene bridged NFEA named ACS8 (Fig. 8a). Relative to IEICO-4F, ACS8 exhibited a deeper HOMO energy level of −5.54 eV and a similar LUMO energy level of −4.08 eV, leaving a slightly greater optical bandgap of 1.30 eV. Additionally, the pristine film of ACS8 demonstrated a well-ordered face-on molecular orientation (Fig. 8b), affording double the electron mobility of IEICO-4F. With PTB7-Th as donor, the as-cast OSCs delivered a PCE of 9.9%, which was further enhanced to 13.2% with a notable JSC of 25.3 mA cm−2 after optimization using a 1-phenylnaphthalene (PN) additive. Moreover, the blend PTB7-Th:ACS8 shows weak absorption in the region of 400–600 nm, endowing the system with good application in semitransparent OSCs (Fig. 8c). Consequently, the semitransparent devices exhibit an outstanding PCE of up to 11.1% with an average visible transmittance of 28.6%. The dual alkoxy or alkylthio side chain modified thiophene bridges were also carefully investigated, with corresponding NFEAs reported as ITOIC-2F86 and IDT2ST-4F87 (Fig. 7), however both of them exhibited blue-shifted absorptions and larger bandgaps compared to their counterparts with one side chain on the π-bridge.

Carboxylate groups have also been introduced to regulate the electron density of π-bridges. With a methyl-3-thiophene-carboxylate (3MT) bridge, IDT-3MT demonstrated deeper energy levels and a red-shifted absorption compared to DC-IDT2T.84 Additionally, the oxygen atom in the ester unit could interact with the sulfur atom of the IDT core, which is favorable for a planar configuration endowed by the noncovalent conformational locks. The molecular alignment induced by the polar ester groups is beneficial for electron transport capability. With PBDB-T as the donor, IDT-3MT achieved a champion PCE of 8.4%. The thienylene–vinylene–thienylene (TVT) unit, which features a rigid planar conjugated backbone and was widely used in organic filed effect transistors (OFETs), was also utilized as a side group attached on π-bridges. Bearing TVT as a conjugated side group, the resultant acceptor ITVT exhibited an enhanced absorption profile in the short wavelength range.85 Compared to DC-IDT2T, the incorporation of electron-donating TVT enhanced the ICT effect, giving rise to extended absorption and a reduced optical bandgap. However, theoretical simulation demonstrated that the backbone geometry of ITVT was twisted, leading to moderate electron mobility. By pairing with the wide bandgap polymer donor PBZ, the optimized device achieved a PCE of 5.84%.
Another intelligent idea was proposed by Wu and coworkers.82 Instead of enhancing molecular planarity, they provided a counterintuitive molecular design strategy, that is, increasing the molecular tortuosity to achieve efficient NFEAs. The strategy was realized by connecting the endcaps at the 3-position of thiophene bridges (Fig. 9a). Compared with its isomer IEICO-4F, i-IEICO-4F possesses a much more twisted configuration with large dihedral angles between π-bridges and adjacent endcaps (Fig. 9b), which reduced π-electron delocalization along the π-skeleton and resulted in a marked blue-shift by 164 nm but accompanied by a greater molar extinction coefficient. The complementary absorptions of donor J52 and i-IEICO-4F yielded average photo-responses and higher EQEs in the range of ca. 500–800 nm. The twisted characteristics of the backbone also decreased the π-conjugating degree, resulting in an elevated LUMO energy level. The study of exciton/charge properties reported that the isomer i-IEICO-4F device shows superior charge extraction properties and a lower recombination rate, relative to the IEICO-4F device. These merits enabled collectively improved JSC, VOC, and FF parameters in the i-IEICO-4F device, yielding a high PCE of 13.18% with J52 as donor. Based on this twisted molecular backbone, other researchers explored the effects of fluorinated endcaps. Compared to the 3-fluorinated analogue (i-IEICO-F3), they found that i-IEICO-2F (a mixture of 4-fluorinated and 5-fluorinated isomers) possesses a higher dipole moment, a bathochromic-shifted absorption profile, and suppressed charge recombination.109 Paired with J52, a higher PCE of 12.86% was yielded in the i-IEICO-2F-based device, compared to the i-IEICO-F3-based device (PCE of 7.65%). The synergistic regulation of lateral alkoxy-phenyl side chains and endcaps was further explored, where the resulting acceptor i-mO-4F based device PCE reached 14.02% with PBDB-T as donor.110 With this main backbone tortuosity concept, decorations of the side chains on the π-bridge111 and the endcap112 have been reported as well. From the perspective of photovoltaic performance, the success of the planarity tortuosity strategy is primarily attributed to the reduced trade-off between photocurrent and photovoltage. The increased torsion of molecular planarity weakens the ICT effect, leaving an upshifted LUMO level for greater VOC values. Meanwhile, the blue-shifted absorption profiles provide more complementary photon utilization with large bandgap donors, giving an enhanced JSC as described above. The evolutions of these two factors are predictable to some extent. The most uncontrollable factor is charge transport, which requires an ordered molecular assembly with dominant face-on orientations. Therefore, moderate modification of the molecule twist could be advisable to ensure satisfactory molecular stacking and orientation, and output amplified JSC and VOC for boosted PCEs.

As Fig. 7 shows, in addition to the thiophene family of π-bridges, a variety of other aromatic motifs have been utilized to construct A–π–D–π–A type acceptors. Among them, thieno[3,2-b]thiophene (TT) and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TbT) are widely utilized as π-spacers in NFEAs. As for TT-bridged NFAs (e.g. Ph-DTDP-TTIC and IDTO-TT-4F), the fusion of thiophene units extends the conjugation along the molecular skeleton, however the absorption behavior and optical bandgap of Ph-DTDP-TTIC are similar to its thiophene-bridged analog Ph-DTDP-TIC. In other words, the influence of a larger π-bridge TT is limited. In addition, the larger spacers also induced unsatisfactory strong crystallinity, which led to a self-aggregated active layer with a PCE of 2.86% when paired with the donor PBDB-T.113 Comparatively, thieno[3,4-b]thiophene (TbT) is a distinctive unit as a π-bridge, whose π-conjugation is extended along the vertical azimuth instead of along the molecular backbones. TbT was first used in the design of polymeric donors, and further decorations led to a well-known low bandgap polymer donor PBDTTTT-EFT, i.e. PTB7-Th.114,115 The introduction of the TbT unit with the fusion of a proaromatic ring could stabilize the quinoidal resonance of conjugated frameworks, which would not only decrease the HOMO–LUMO gap but also provide a more rigid backbone to enhance the planarity. The quinoid-resonance effect induced by the TbT unit was further highlighted in NFEAs. By inserting a TbT unit between the central core and the terminal endcaps of NFEAs, the ground electronic state of the aromatic unit in the acceptor is destabilized, which could enhance the ICT effect and tune the optical bandgap.116,117 Zhu and coworkers reported a series of studies on the application of TbT units, e.g. the ATT-series acceptors. For better comparison with other π-bridged acceptors, we employ ATT-2 to describe the function of TbT. Owing to the synergetic effect of the quinoidal resonance and ICT, ATT-2 exhibited a greatly reduced Eoptg of 1.32 eV, which is much smaller than those of other analogs with thiophene, selenophen, furan, and pyrrole bridges. With PTB7-Th as the donor, ATT-2 delivered a PCE of 9.58%, with a VOC of 0.73 V and JSC of 20.75 mA cm−2.92 By optimizing the side chains and thus molecular crystallinity and charge transport properties, the analog ATT-5 produced a greater PCE of 12.36%.118 Besides, different from π-bridge units with symmetrical chemical structures, the linkage positions of asymmetric TbT units can markedly modulate the energy levels, photophysical behavior, and photovoltaic performance. For example, Zhong and coworkers119 studied the linkage position effects of TbT-based spacers and reported 4-position isomers (4TIC and 4TIF) and 6-position isomers (6TIC and 6T4F). Multiple results showed that 6T4F demonstrated a higher molecular packing order and charge transport capacity, contributing to a champion PCE of 10.74%, compared to 4T4F with a low 6.58% efficiency, which suggests that the regioisomeric backbone will significantly impact the optoelectronic properties. The quinoidal resonance of TbT units can be further tuned via replacing the sulfur atom in the main or peripheral ring with another chalcogen selenium atom. Zhu and coworkers94 synthesized two isomers, namely NITI-SSe with 2-alkylselenopheno[2,3-c]thiophene and NITI-SeS 2-alkylselenopheno[3,4-b]thiophene (the former selenium in the molecular backbone). With regulation of the quinoidal effect along the backbone azimuth, the absorption spectra and bandgaps were accordingly modulated. Compared to the routine TbT constructed NITI,93 NITI-SSe and NITI-SeS exhibited an enlarged and reduced Eoptg of 1.53 eV and 1.46 eV, respectively, indicating the notable impact of the backbone quinoidal resonance effect. However, the enhanced quinoidal effect and molecular stacking of the isomer NITI-SeS induced excessively strong crystallinity and thus a poor morphology, leading to a reduced FF and PCE of 9.52% compared to the control acceptor (12.54%). Instead, the moderate crystallization behavior of NITI-SSe endows a satisfactory miscibility with polymer donor PBDB-T, and a slightly higher PCE of 12.94% was recorded.
3.2 ITIC-based NFEAs carrying electron-deficient π-bridges
Relative to the popular electron-rich π-bridges, the varieties of electron-deficient π-bridges and corresponding NFEAs are limited. However, fully understanding the electronic feature of π-bridges is of importance to the development of NFEAs. One typical example, reported by Huang and coworkers,96 is the acceptor IDT-Tz with two electron-deficient π-bridges (Fig. 10). Compared to DC-IDT2T with bare thiophene bridges, the electron-negative nitrogen on bridges enhanced the electron affinity and electron-deficient nature of the acceptor, resulting in downshifted molecular orbitals. Meanwhile, the bandgap was slightly enlarged with a blue-shifted absorption spectrum, owing to the decreased ICT effect. Nevertheless, the introduced nitrogen⋯sulfur noncovalent conformational locks greatly raised the rigidity and planarity of the molecular backbone for improved molecular stacking, which reduced the reorganization energy and increased the charge transport mobility for better photovoltaic performance. These merits contributed to greater JSC and FF values, which effectively offset the decrease of VOC from the deeper LUMO energy level of IDT-Tz. With PTB7-Th as the donor, the IDT-Tz-based solar cells achieved high PCEs up to 8.4%, which is double that of the thiophene bridged counterpart. As a versatile and effective building block, thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) was also employed as a π-bridge to construct NFEAs.97,120 The strong electron-deficient feature of TPD further downshifted the LUMO energy of the resultant acceptor, giving a small bandgap of 1.46 eV.97 The intramolecular noncovalent sulfur⋯oxygen interactions between the oxygen atoms (imides) on TPD and the sulfur atoms on the adjacent thiophene backbone improved the molecular planarity and ICT effect. With low-lying energy level PTQ10 as the donor, the solar cells exhibited a PCE of 10.4% with a high VOC of 0.91 V. In addition to these typical acceptors with commonly employed DCI structures endcaps, the electron-deficient π-bridges have been widely used to construct wide bandgap acceptors with rhodamine and other analogous endcaps.102,103,121–124 For example, in combination with PTB7-Th, the wide bandgap acceptor IDTzCR (Eoptg = 1.79 eV) terminated with 2-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-rhodanine (RCN) units delivered a PCE of 8.71% with a very impressive VOC up to 1.04 V.98
 Fig. 10  Examples of A–π–D–π–A acceptors with electron-deficient π-bridges. 
Besides the thiazole and TPD units, other building blocks such as benzothiadiazole(BT), benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole (BTA), quinoxaline (Qx), and thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine(TP) were utilized as spacers as well. BT has been widely used to construct high efficiency NFEAs due to its unique electron-withdrawing properties, molecular rigidity, decoration availability, and structural adjustability,125 and it was firstly employed by Holiday and coworkers99 to design A–π–D–π–A acceptors in 2015. FBR with a 9,9-dioctyl-9H-fluorene core and 3-ethylrhodanine flanking groups possesses a wide optical band gap of 2.14 eV as well as strong absorption in the visible region. The inverted device based on P3HT:FBR yielded a PCE of 4.11%. Subsequently, they utilized an IDT central core and alkyl side chains to synthesize O-IDTBR with linear n-octyl alkyl chains and EH-IDTBR with branched 2-ethylhexyl chains.100 With refined rigid and planar molecular skeletons, the IDTBR series acceptors possess narrower band gaps. The oxidative stability of these devices was also found to be superior to the benchmark PC60BM based devices. Notably, the solar cell of P3HT:IDTBR demonstrated a higher PCE of 6.4% and improved stability under ambient conditions.
BTA, an analog of the BT unit, was another significant candidate in photovoltaic materials.126 The pioneering application of BTA bridges in A–π–D–π–A NFEAs was reported by Zhou and coworkers, with an acceptor called BTA1.101 BTA1 displays good thermal stability with strong and broad absorption from 300 to 700 nm. The high-lying LUMO energy level of −3.55 eV contributed to a high VOC of 1.02 V. With BTA1 as the basis, the end-caps were intensively decorated to regulate the energy level and intermolecular interactions.102,103,127 The LUMOs of BTA2 with a thiazolidine-2,4-dione (TD) terminal and BTA3 with RCN-Et end groups decreased.102 By replacing ethyl in RCN with benzene-containing substituents (phenyl and benzyl), BTA4 and BTA5 were designed. Benefitting from the fine-tuned intermolecular interactions and packing modes, the J52-F:BTA5 device yielded a superior PCE of 11.27% with a high VOC of 1.17 V.103 The VOC could be further improved to 1.25 V when paired with donor D18.104 Halogenation on BTA-bridges also led to deeper energy levels of F-BTA5 and Cl-BTA5.128,129 The D18:Cl-BTA5 combination yielded an excellent PCE of 12.0% with a VOC of 1.16 V. Furthermore, low trap-assistant recombination loss endowed the D18:Cl-BTA5 device with a high PCE of over 20% under 2700 K LED illumination at 1000 lux. Besides, chlorinated-BTA bridges were also adopted in the non-fused acceptor Cl-BTA33.
Quinoxaline (Qx) units have a weaker electron-deficient ability relative to the BT unit. 2,3-Diphenylquinoxaline bridged Qx1 and Qx1b were designed based on hexylphenyl-substituted IDT and octyl-substituted IDT cores.105 Moreover, Qx3b with better co-crystallization of P3HT showed an enhanced face-on orientation, leading to facilitated charge transport and a PCE of 6.37%. With the absence of phenyl groups on both IDT and Qx moieties, Qx3c possesses a planar molecular backbone, but the excessive aggregation in the active layer leads to a negligible PCE of 0.03%.106 Upon replacing benzene in 2,3-diphenylquinoxaline with a thiophene ring, another π-bridge, namely thieno[3,4-b]pyrazine (TP), was reported.107 The resulting quinoid structure of the TP moiety endowed TP21 with a narrower band gap than other fluorine-based counterparts. The J61:TP21 based device yielded a high VOC of 1.02 V and a moderate PCE of 5.81%. The band gap can be further reduced with IC as the terminal group. However, the deeper LUMO level of TP28 positioned at −4.02 eV caused a reduced VOC of 0.77 V with a decreased PCE of 5.31% when paired with PBDB-T.108
In comparison with the A–π–D–π–A acceptors carrying electron-deficient π-bridges, the acceptors with electron-rich π-bridges are more efficient overall. The most challenging issue for the former should be attributed to the low-lying LUMO energy levels and thus smaller VOCs in the resultant solar cells. To upshift the LUMO level, weaker electron-deficient endcaps are required to replace the typical IC endcap. However, based on the current acceptors collected in Fig. 10, we can see that most of them feature large bandgaps, suggesting an undeveloped ICT effect. Therefore, more appropriate endcap structures are recommended to pair with the electron-deficient π-bridges for an enhanced ICT effect and light utilization capacity. Nevertheless, the impressive high VOCs in the current A–π–D–π–A acceptors carrying electron-deficient π-bridges are equally important for ternary and tandem solar cells.
4. π-Bridges in Y6-based NFEAs
The most popular acceptor at the current stage should be assigned to Y6 and its analogs, which have a more complicated DA′D fused core and out-of-plane side chains attached on sp2 atoms. Different from the previously discussed ITIC-series NFEAs, the A–DA′D–A arranged Y6-series acceptors have distinctive advantages. Firstly, the DA′D electron-rich core provides a rigid molecular plane and thus enhanced π-electron delocalization for the ICT effect. Secondly, the introduction of the nitrogen atoms serving as heteroatomic bridges for covalent planarization offers stronger electron-donating capacity to maintain the energy orbitals at appropriate levels. Meanwhile, the electron-deficient A′ moiety in the middle of the DA′D unit facilitates the electroluminescence and potentially reduces the nonradiative charge recombination loss for a smaller VOC drop. After the first report of Y6 in 2019,130 numerous following studies have been conducted on the decorations of cores, terminals and side chains, which remarkably boosted the development of OSCs with state-of-the-art PCEs reaching 19%.131–137 In comparison, as an important alternative approach to regulate the performance, the strategy of π-bridges has received relatively less attention, which is possibly attributed to the concerns over the large disturbance from π-bridges on the current nearly-ideal electron characteristics and energy loss. However, some researchers reasonably employed π-bridges in A–DA′D–A acceptors and designed NFEAs with intensive near-infrared (NIR) absorptions, which have found picturesque application scenarios in the fields of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs), tandem solar cells, and organic photodetectors (OPDs).138–140
Li and coworkers138 proposed a distinctive approach to regulating bandgaps, that is, inserting another ethylene double bond π-bridge between the central fused DA′D unit and endcaps of Y6. As a result, a new narrow bandgap acceptor BTPV-4F was reported with an extremely low bandgap of 1.21 eV (Fig. 11a). With PTB7-Th as the donor, the single-junction devices of BTPV-4F achieved a PCE of 13.4% with a high JSC of 28.9 mA cm−2. More encouragingly, with PTB7-Th:BTPV-4F as the rear cell active layer, the tandem devices recorded a high PCE of 16.4% with good photostability (Fig. 11b). Fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene (FTT), an analog of TbT discussed above, was introduced as a π-bridge into the Y6 system. Based on the FTT unit, Zhong and coworkers139 designed a narrow bandgap acceptor BFIC. The insertion of the FTT π-bridge extended the π-conjugation, stabilized the quinoid resonant structure, and enhanced the ICT effect, which collectively endowed BFIC with strong NIR absorptivity between 700 and 1050 nm. The noncovalent interaction induced by the fluorine atoms in the FTT motif can somehow interlock the molecular geometry and restrict the rotation of σ-bonds between FTT and the DA′D central part, enabling enhanced packing of the solid state. The conventional opaque OSCs based on BFIC and PTB7-Th realized a PCE of 10.38%. Besides, the selective photoresponse in the NIR range of the device provides an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 38.79% with a PCE of 6.15% in the corresponding semitransparent OSCs. Meanwhile, the largest light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 2.39%, defined as the product of PCE and AVT, was realized from the device with MoO3 attributed to the balanced PCE (6.15%) and AVT (38.79%). The researchers further fabricated OPD devices based on BFIC and PTB7-Th, which showed a broad and intense spectral response ranging from 330 to 1030 nm with high specific detectivity over 1013 Jones in self-powered mode (Fig. 11c). These discoveries highlight the superior advantages of quinoid resonant π-bridges in designing multifunctional NIR acceptors.

Zhu and coworkers140 further developed an EQE model to explore the full potential of material design in ST-OSC performance in terms of the LUE prediction. The theoretical model revealed the high requirement for efficient ultranarrow bandgap NFEAs with a large spectral response of greater than 1100 nm. Guided by this theory, they designed the acceptor ATT-9, with two FTT units as bilateral π-bridges and 2F-DCI as endcaps. Relative to BFIC, the stronger electron-deficient feature of the endcaps further strengthened the ICT effect for regulating energy levels. When compared to the control acceptor Y6, ATT-9 shows more effective intermolecular packing, resulting in a significantly red-shifted absorption by over 100 nm (Fig. 11d). More specifically, ATT-9 has a large absorption peak at 927 nm with an onset of 1040 nm and corresponding very low optical bandgap of 1.19 eV. With PTB7-Th as donor, the opaque solar cells of ATT-9 delivered a very impressive JSC up to 30.0 mA cm−2 and outstanding PCE of 13.35%, which largely surpassed those of the Y6-based device with an optimal JSC up to 24.6 mA cm−2 and outstanding PCE of 10.93%. Notably, the JSC recorded from PTB7-Th:ATT-9 is the highest value among NFEA-based OSCs so far, and the PCE is also the highest value among binary OSCs with such a large λonset of over 1000 nm. The excellent JSC should be attributed to the intense absorption of ATT-9 and extended EQE responses in the NIR region (Fig. 11e), which suggests potential to construct high-performance ST-OSCs as well. Benefiting from the optimal bandgap and small energy loss, the ST-OSCs of PTB7-Th:ATT-9 realized a high LUE of 3.33% with a corresponding PCE of 9.37% and AVT of 35.5%, and the LUE ranks the best among ST-OSCs free of special device treatments such as optical modulations or electrode optimizations. Moreover, good balance among PCE, AVT, and infrared radiation (IR) was achieved, which is critical to ST-OSCs for promising applications in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs). In conclusion for this section, attributed to the intrinsic high-performance of Y6-series acceptors with narrow bandgaps and low energy loss, the π-bridges provide new potential to design efficient NIR-absorbing NFEAs for ST-OSCs and NIR-OPDs, which are equally important in addition to boosting the PCEs.
5. Unilateral π-bridge strategy in NFEAs
In the aforementioned sections, we focused on describing the varieties, functions, and applications of π-bridges in communities of PDI-, ITIC-, and Y6-based NFEAs. For the latter two classes, it is evident that all of these acceptors feature dual π-bridges flanked by central cores, that is, the A–π–D–π–A or A–π–DA′D–π–A type arrangement. The π-bridges can extend the conjugation length and strengthen the ICT effect, giving narrowed bandgaps. However, the HOMO/LUMO energy levels are accordingly inevitably upshifted/downshifted, which seriously reduces the VOC of OSCs. The serious trade-off between absorption and energy level (or JSC and VOC) often limits the increase of overall PCEs. This situation is more deteriorative in Y6-series acceptors, resulting in lower PCEs from bilaterally π-bridged acceptors, despite the improved LUE in ST-OSC devices. Promisingly, the asymmetric strategy has always been considered as one possible approach to achieve balance and some fresh regulation in designing organic semiconductors. Consequently, the unilateral π-bridge strategy has received increasing attention for designing high-performance NFEAs. Next, we will illustrate some examples to discuss the functions of unilateral π-bridges in the photovoltaic performance of NFEAs, with the corresponding chemical structures displayed in Fig. 12.
 Fig. 12  Chemical structures of unilateral π-bridged NFEAs and control acceptors without π-bridges. 
Zhang and coworkers141 reported an asymmetric noncovalent NFEA with a unilateral alkylthio-substituted thiophene π-bridge, namely IDST-4F (Fig. 12 and Table 3). Compared to the A–D–A type acceptor ID-4F, IDST-4F exhibited a broader absorption spectrum and higher-lying energy levels. The asymmetrical electronic structure of IDST-4F had a greater dipole moment of 2.02 Debye than that of ID-4F (0.34 Debye), which should be beneficial for solid stacking. However, the results show that IDST-4F has decreased crystallinity compared to ID-4F, which prevents the formation of large aggregations in the active layer. Notably, the optimized molecular aggregation refined the networks of the BHJ blend for improved charge transport. The red-shifted film absorption by over 70 nm enhanced the light harvesting and utilization leading to a boosted JSC. The upshifted LUMO level and greatly suppressed energy loss from 0.92 eV of the ID-4F based device to 0.59 eV of the IDST-4F based solar cell account for the greater VOC. Therefore, the overall enhanced photovoltaic parameters collectively afforded a high PCE of 14.3%, in comparison to 6.4% of the ID-4F based device. More importantly, the result shows that PM6:IDST-4F-based OSCs possess excellent thermal stability retaining 82% of their initial PCE after heating at 150 °C for 1200 min. Side chain engineering was employed to refine the molecular aggregation and BHJ morphologies. In our previous work, we first proposed a kind of new side chain, phenylalkyl, to balance the trade-off between crystallinity of acceptors and miscibility of active layers.142,143 The resulting acceptor, namely IDIC-C4Ph, recorded a FF of over 78% and PCE over 14%, both of which are much higher than those of the alkyl side chain analog IDIC with 69.88% FF and 12% PCE. Further regulating the alkyl section of phenylalkyl realized an impressive FF of 80.03% attributed to the transformation of molecular assembly from 2D stacking to a 3D packing mode. Herein, the phenylalkyl side group was adopted to cooperate with the unilateral π-bridge strategy and acceptors ID-C6Ph-4F and ID-C6Ph-ST-4F were designed144 (Fig. 12). Some variation trends including absorptions, energy levels, molecular dipoles and energy loss are consistent with those from ID-4F to IDST-4F, which is reasonable owing to the identical π-conjugated backbone and mere modification of non-conjugated side chains. However, ID-C6Ph-ST-4F exhibited slightly decreased crystallinity compared to ID-C6Ph-4F without the π-bridge, which is opposite to the tendency of IDST-4F. This discrepancy in the two systems should be attributed to the phenylalkyl side group having a bulky phenyl terminal, which reduces the crystallinity of the rigid molecule ID-4F. However, the introduction of a unilateral π-bridge in turn strengthened the molecular stacking, owing to the increased molecular dipole and π-conjugation. With the same donor, ID-C6Ph-4F exhibited an overall improvement of photovoltaic parameters with 10.75% PCE. Similarly, ID-C6Ph-ST-4F displayed mildly decreased crystallinity, and a blue-shifted absorption profile in comparison to those of the alkyl-attached counterpart IDST-4F, which generates a lower JSC of 23.19 mA cm−2 in the optimal device (Table 3). Inspiringly, with identical LUMO levels compared to IDST-4F, the device of IDST-C6Ph-4F has a greater VOC by 0.06 eV, attributed to the smaller energy loss. The moderately weakened crystallinity and self-aggregation of ID-C6Ph-ST-4F further optimized the BHJ morphology for lower charge recombination. As a result, an excellent PCE of 15.36% with a FF of over 75% was recorded. With a subtly regulated alkyl section of phenylalkyl, the unilateral π-bridged WA1 gave an impressive FF up to 79.31%, which ranks the best among OSCs with π-bridged NFEAs. The ternary devices with WA1 as the guest produced 18.15% efficiency.145

Besides, the unilateral π-bridge strategy was also employed in A–DA′D–A type acceptors. Bo and coworkers146 studied the π-bridge effect of 3,4-bis-(octyloxy)thiophene (BOT) and reported three NFEAs, namely L4, L5, and L6, as displayed in Fig. 12. L4 without the π-bridge unit displayed a low solubility in chloroform, which leads to large phase separations in the active layer. In comparison, L5 and L6 exhibited satisfactory solubility owing to the cooperation of π-bridge induced molecular torsion and lateral side chains on π-bridges. However, the slightly twisted molecular conformation could be converted to a planar backbone in the solid state, and thus produce preferred miscibility of the active layer. Notably, the asymmetric structural acceptor L5-based devices exhibited appropriate phase-separation and decent charge transport capability, generating competitive PCEs up to 15.2% from the as-cast solar cells. Likewise, L5 exhibits good application potential in optimizing ternary systems, with over 17% PCE recorded from PM6:L5:Y6 ternary devices. In addition to the conventional aromatic π-bridges discussed above, A vinylene π-bridge, a simple but uncommon structure, was also introduced to regulate the performance of NFEA based solar cells. For example, Yan and coworkers147 inserted a vinylene group into the Y6 analog and reported two vinylene extended acceptors, BTP-1V-2F with a unilateral vinylene π-bridge, and BTP-2V-2F with bilateral vinylene π-bridges. The critical π-bridge decorated central parts were obtained by Wittig reactions with different amounts of tributyl(1,3-dioxolan-2-ylmethyl)phosphonium bromide. The insertion of a vinylene group extended the π-conjugation length of the molecules, leaving small bandgaps of 1.26 eV and 1.22 eV for BTP-1V-2F and BTP-2V-2F, respectively. Similar to the findings mentioned above, the unilateral vinylene π-bridge is effective in balancing the serious trade-off of energy level and absorption, resulting in a satisfactory VOC and JSC in OSCs. With PM6 as donor, the symmetrical BTP-2V-2F shows a high JSC of 26.50 mA cm−2 but small VOC of 0.66 V, leading to a moderate PCE of 11.22%. In comparison, BTP-1V-2F maintained a high photocurrent along with greater open-circuit voltage and FFs, realizing a higher efficiency of 14.24%. These examples strongly suggest the great potential of the unilateral π-bridge strategy in regulating the molecular orbitals and photophysical properties, as well as molecular aggregation owing to asymmetrical electron distribution along the π-backbones of NFEAs. Thus, we highlight the significance of the rational unilateral π-bridge strategy in designing new efficient NFEAs and the great potential to realize a breakthrough in photovoltaic efficiencies.
An inevitable problem arising from the employment of π-bridges is the introduction of single bonds, which bring conformational isomerism and could be critical to the molecular packing and photovoltaic performance. However, determining the accurate conformations and controlling the conformational interconversions are very difficult, because of the relatively high degree of freedom for the rotary σ-bonds. As a result, the relatively small energy barrier of the rotation of σ-bonds usually leads to a dynamic equilibrium of more than one conformers, which are interconverted from one isomer to another isomer very readily and rapidly.148–151
Addressing this issue, Zhong and coworkers152 conducted a pioneering study to control the interconversions with the help of multiple non-covalent interactions. They synthesized an A–D–π–A type acceptor, namely IDFT, with FTT as the π-bridge to link the IDT central part and 2F-DCI endcap. The unilateral fluorine atom of FTT can interact with different atoms of the IDT core that accompany the rotation of the σ-bond, which regulates the molecular conformations and interconversion among different isomers. The researchers controlled the conformation interconversion by a solvent effect, wherein tetrahydrofuran (THF) and chloroform (CF) show different trends. It should be highlighted that single crystals of IDFT were prepared by way of slow evaporation of diluted solutions in THF and CF solvents, namely IDFT-THF and IDFT-CF, which provide direct and solid evidence for the solvent-governed conformation interconversion. Notably, qualifying single crystals of π-bridged NFEAs are barely reported because of the great difficulty in gaining orderly molecular aggregations from dynamic equilibrium of conformational isomers. As shown in Fig. 13a and b, the crystal from THF has two rotamers with a ratio of 1:1. Rotamer-1 contained the F⋯H (2.37 Å) interaction between the FTT bridge and IDT unit. However, the existence of the repulsive interaction between the two sulfur atoms in the FTT and IDT units reduced the molecular planarity, leading to slightly increased dihedral angles between the π-bridge and adjacent IDT core or endcap. In comparison, the FTT bridge rotates almost 180° in rotamer-2a, resulting in F⋯S (2.85 Å) attraction and S⋯H (2.75 Å) interaction between the FTT and IDT units. The crystal from CF yields a comparable molecular conformation with rotamer-2a, but with a larger backbone torsion. The different conformational isomers induced by the π-bridge exhibited different molecular stacking modes, in which triclinic and monoclinic crystal packing was observed from crystals from THF and CF, respectively. More importantly, the fast film-formation process can hardly influence the conformation because of the multiple non-covalent interactions. The mixed isomers from THF disturbed molecular solid aggregation, leading to a diversity of active layer morphology. Compared to the acceptor IDFT-THF with two isomers, the acceptor IDFT-CF yields collectively enhanced JSC and FF values, yielding a much higher PCE of 13.44% than that of IDFT-THF (10.21%). This pioneering study demonstrates the ability to control conformational interconversions induced by π-bridges, which is of great significance to rationalize the π-bridge strategy for high-performance NFEAs.

6. Summary and outlook
The emergence of NFEAs has significantly advanced the development of OSCs, with increasing efficiencies, deepened structure–function relationships, and gradually expanded application prospects. The design of new efficient NFEAs with extended photon utilization regions, appropriate energy alignment, and preferential molecular stacking is one of the primary tasks in the OSC community. The π-bridge strategy, with versatile merits such as facile synthesis and effective regulation, serves as a more cost-effective alternative compared to backbone decoration and side chain engineering. In this review, the recent advances of π-bridged NFEAs including PDI-series, ITIC-series (A–D–A arrangement), and Y6-series (A–DA′D–A arrangement) are summarized, from the perspectives of electronegativity, conjugation, backbone torsion, and conformational interconversions. By rationally employing π-bridges with an appropriate electron structure and spatial effects, the studies of NFEAs have been greatly enriched and promoted. However, challenges still exist with respect to π-bridged NFEAs at the current stage, in that most of them hold comparable or even smaller PCEs compared to the most popular A–DA′D–A variety of rigid acceptors. However, the intrinsic merits of the π-bridge strategy offer great opportunities to make a breakthrough in the efficiencies of OSCs, and expand the applications of NFEAs in other fields of organic semiconductors and devices. Thus, the future opportunities and challenges of the π-bridge strategy in designing NFEAs are provided as follows.
(1) Unilateral and asymmetric π-bridge strategy. The conventional bilateral π-bridge incorporations in rigid NFEAs often result in a serious trade-off between JSC and VOC, especially for those small bandgap acceptors. In this circumstance, a desirable JSC up to 30 mA cm−2 could be recorded, but it is usually accompanied by a very low VOC of ∼0.6 eV. Besides, the upshifted energy level will limit the choice of typical donors, most of which have wide or medium bandgaps with shallow molecular orbitals. Fortunately, the asymmetric strategy has always been able to reach a balance. The previous studies have proved the effectiveness of the unilateral π-bridge strategy in regulating the energy offset and photo-physical properties, suppressing energy loss, and enhancing the molecular stacking for boosting the PCEs of solar cells. The reduction of π-bridges can reduce the conformation isomers as well, which is preferred to yield a pure conformation of NFEAs for more ordered aggregation and charge transport capacity. Besides, the asymmetric π-bridge strategy, with bilateral π-bridges differing in electron structures or spatial effects, could be another approach in addition to the unilateral π-bridge strategy. By rationally designing π-bridges and employing a unilateral and asymmetric π-bridge strategy to balance the energy offset and absorption, as well as enhance molecular dipoles for better molecular packing, great breakthroughs in PCEs could be expected.
(2) NIR-absorbing NFEAs. NFEAs with ultra-narrow bandgaps and intense absorptions in the NIR region are important to function as the rear subcells in tandem-junction OSCs. Besides, paired with narrow bandgap donors and NIR-absorbing NFEAs, the ST-OSCs will offer high transmittance in the visible region, which will largely expand the application of organic photovoltaics in BIPVs. NIR-OPDs based on these materials can have important usage in various military and civilian fields. As described above, the π-conjugation extension of NFEAs could be complicated with multiple-step ring-fusing reactions to covalently interlock aromatic units, and more importantly, with the increase of fused-rings, the regulation of absorptions and bandgaps could be less effective. Currently, the typical NIR-absorbing NFEAs in ST-OSCs and NIR-OPDs are based on the π-bridge strategy, with a TbT or FTT moiety as the star π-bridge to stabilize the quinone resonance structure of the acceptor. Integration of electronegativity, spatial manipulation, and quinoid π-bridges could be a feasible approach to further reduce the bandgaps of NFEAs. In addition, developing new π-bridges with a smaller resonance energy and appropriate electron structures should be encouraged.
(3) Conformation interconversions. Conformation interconversions induced by the rotary σ-bonds of π-bridges are disadvantageous and inevitable, but can be effectively controlled as highlighted by the previous studies. Understanding and rational utilization of the conformation interconversions could be critical for the future development of π-bridged NFEAs. In addition to the reported solvent control, approaches via pre- or/and post-treatments of the acceptors or/and blend films need to be developed. Besides, studies of the conformation interconversions should be enriched especially in different molecular systems, in order to disclose the full-chain influence of conformation interconversions of NFEAs in π-bridge structures, energy offset, molecular aggregation, intermolecular interactions, and overall photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, exploring the conformation interconversions in-depth is also highly desirable for the boosting of PCEs and constructing high performance NIR-absorbing NFEAs.
