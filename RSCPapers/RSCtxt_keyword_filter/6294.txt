    , Accepted 20th May 2019First published on 22nd May 2019AbstractIn this work, we were able to develop a series of new conjugated molecular dyads for SCOSCs, and more importantly, we realized well-ordered nanostructures in these materials for efficient SCOSCs. The ideas started from designing three molecular dyads, in which diketopyrrolopyrrole-based conjugated backbones as donors and perylene bisimide side units as pendent acceptors were used. In addition, heteroatoms, such as sulfur and fluorine atoms, were incorporated into these molecules. We found that the sulfur-containing molecular dyads provided well-ordered lamellar structures in thin films, so they showed high photocurrent in solar cells. As a result, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.52% could be obtained, which is also among the highest PCEs of single-component conjugated molecular dyads.
1. Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have attracted extensive attention not only in academia but also in industry due to their light weight, easy device manufacture, semi-transparent nature, good flexibility and low cost compared with inorganic solar cells based on silicon.1,2 So far, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs based on polymer donors and non-fullerene acceptors have reached over 15% in single-junction devices3–5 and over 17% in tandem devices,6 which far exceed those (∼11%) of fullerene-based solar cells.7 Both fullerene and non-fullerene OSCs consist of two components, polymer donors/small molecular donors and fullerene/non-fullerene acceptors, to form bulk-heterojunction photoactive layers. These cells are fabricated by physically mixing donors and acceptors in organic solvents, facing the problem of large phase separation during long-term application,8–11 since the kinetically frozen state in films will gradually change into a thermodynamically stable one. This will cause low charge generation efficiency and PCEs, resulting in the poor stability of OSCs.
Single-component materials have been designed toward solving the poor stability of OSCs.12–15 They are constructed by incorporating an electron donor and an electron acceptor into one conjugated material usually via covalent bonds. Conjugated polymers applied to single-component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) contain block copolymers,16 including “rod–coil”17–20 and “rod–rod”21–25 architectures, and double-cable conjugated polymers,13,26–33 in which PCEs over 4% have been achieved.26,30 Small molecules with donor and acceptor moieties are another important class of single-component materials, which show the advantages of defined structures and easy synthesis. However, the PCEs of small molecule based SCOSCs are still far lagging behind those of conjugated polymers. Since Nierengarten et al. designed the first small molecules employed in SCOSCs in 1999,34 plenty of small molecule dyads35–44 and triads45–47 have been synthesized and their photovoltaic devices have achieved PCEs from 0.08%38 up to 2.44%.47 In these molecules, fullerene derivatives have been widely used as electron acceptors. They not only have many advantages but also have drawbacks (e.g., narrow absorption bands). For example, Surya Prakash Singh et al. designed a dyad composed of fullerene and diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) derivatives and gained a PCE of 2.17%, in which the absorption region of the fullerene did not complement well that of DPP, resulting in a low Jsc of 6.71 mA cm−2.40 Another example is a triad designed by Han Young Woo et al.,47 consisting of benzodithiophene–rhodanine (BDTRh) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). This molecular triad achieved a PCE of 2.44% but a low Jsc of 7.02 mA cm−2. In addition, the above-mentioned molecules always contain linear donor conjugated backbones with electron acceptors attached as the end groups (Fig. 1a), while single-component molecules with electron acceptors attached as side units, similar to double-cable conjugated polymers, have rarely been reported.38

Recently, non-fullerene electron acceptors such as perylene bisimide (PBI) derivatives have been successfully applied to OSCs due to their low-lying energy levels, and excellent electron transport and crystalline properties.48–55 We have developed a series of double-cable conjugated polymers with PBI as side units, in which they could potentially form lamellar structures with alternating donors and acceptors.26,28,55,56 These ordered structures could facilitate efficient charge transport and reduce charge recombination in SCOSCs. With these motivations, in this study, we developed three molecular dyads with DPP-based electron donors as conjugated backbones and PBIs as side units (Fig. 1b). The three molecules show a broad absorption spectrum from 400 to 800 nm. Additionally, we further introduced fluorine atoms and alkylthio side chains into these molecules, and performed a systematic study of their effect on their nanophase separation and photovoltaic performance. Fluorine atoms57,58 and alkylthio units59,60 have been widely incorporated into electron donors and acceptors to simultaneously tune their energy levels, charge transport and crystalline mobilities so as to enhance the PCEs of OSCs. Our studies in this work demonstrate that molecular dyads with similar structures to double-cable polymers are important single-component conjugated molecules with controllable nanophase separation, which can potentially realize high performance SCOSCs.
2. Results and discussion
2.1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for the monomers and small molecules are presented in Scheme 1. Compound 1 was prepared from the procedure shown in Scheme S1 (ESI†). Compound 2 was obtained according to the literature.62 Compound 1 was reacted with compound 2 in DMF at 80 °C in the presence of K2CO3 to afford M1 in 51% yield. Then M1 was reacted with M2/M3/M4via the Stille coupling reaction in toluene with Pd(PPh3)4 at 120 °C to provide double-cable molecules SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP, respectively. SMDPP had ethylhexyl side units attached to benzodithiophene (BDT), while S-SMDPP contained ethylhexylthio side units, and F atoms were incorporated into SF-SMDPP. These double-cable molecules all show good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene, which is beneficial for device fabrication via a solution process.

2.2. Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-Vis absorption spectra of SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP in solution and as films are displayed in Fig. 2. They have similar absorption profiles in solution and as films. In solution, their main absorption peaks are similar, indicating that the electronic structures of these small molecules have negligible differences in intramolecular interaction.63 As thin films, the peak around 490 nm shows obviously enhanced intensity, indicating H-aggregation of PBI units.64 This phenomenon can also be observed in PBI-containing double-cable conjugated polymers.26 The absorption from 550 nm to 800 nm that corresponds to the conjugated backbone is significantly enhanced and red-shifts, indicating their strong aggregation tendency as thin films. In Fig. 2b, the absorption intensity in the range of 600–800 nm for SMDPP is much higher than those for S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP, which might be ascribed to the different crystalline structures of the conjugated backbones in these molecules. The absorption changes from solutions to thin films reveal that both the conjugated backbone and PBI side units tend to form ordered nanostructures. All thin films show broad absorption from 400 nm to 800 nm, which is helpful to harvest sunlight, thus beneficial for producing high short-circuit current density (Jsc). The absorption onsets of SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP as thin films are located at 832 nm, 838 nm and 843 nm, corresponding to their optical bandgaps (Eg) of 1.49 eV, 1.48 eV and 1.47 eV, respectively.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to investigate the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the three small molecules in o-DCB solution, as shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The three compounds have similar energy levels with a LUMO level of 3.72 eV, which is equal to the LUMO level of PBI,26 while SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP have different HOMO levels (−5.12 eV, −5.16 eV and −5.18 eV, respectively). SF-SMDPP has the lowest HOMO level among the three small molecules due to the electron-deficient fluorine atom in its backbone.
2.3. Thermal properties
All three small molecules show good thermal stability when tested by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Fig. 3a). TGA demonstrated that the decomposition temperatures (Td) of SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP (5% weight loss) are 411 °C, 401 °C and 399 °C, respectively. The ∼50% weight loss above 500 °C might be attributed to the decomposition of the PBI side units. We also utilized differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to estimate the crystalline nature of these small molecules (Fig. 3b–d). The melting points of SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP could be extracted from the cooling process – 242.36 °C, 262.38 °C and 259.98 °C, respectively. This could be further confirmed by measurement using melting-point apparatus with 236.5–239.2 °C, 259.2–261.3 °C and 255.3–258.1 °C, respectively. We could also observe a phase transition during the cooling process, which might be due to the crystallization of the molecules. The heat of crystallization (ΔHc) values obtained from the DSC thermograms are also presented in Fig. 3, in which SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP have ΔHc values of 13.64 J g−1, 12.87 J g−1 and 14.33 J g−1. These molecules show similar ΔHc values so that it is very difficult to distinguish their crystallinity via DSC measurements. We also performed the DSC measurement of the donor molecule 2DPP-BDT and PBI, as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Both of them show high ΔHc compared to those of the double-cable molecules, indicating that the double-cable structures display lower crystallinity than either of the individual chromophores. It is worth mentioning that we can observe two peaks during the cooling process for the donor molecule 2DPP-BDT (Fig. S2b, ESI†) and the molecular dyads S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP (Fig. 3c and d), indicating that the two peaks might have originated from the conjugated backbone with two phase transitions. However, SMDPP exhibited only one peak during the cooling process, which could be due to its different crystalline behavior, but the real reason is unclear to us.

2.4. Single-component organic solar cells
The photovoltaic performances of these molecules were further studied with SCOSCs with an inverted device structure of ITO/ZnO/active layer/MoO3/Ag. The active layers were spin-coated in o-DCB solution with different contents of additive and annealed at different temperatures; the detailed procedures and optimization are summarized in the ESI† (Tables S1–S3 and Fig. S3–S5). After adding the additive and annealing at high temperature, the PCEs of SMDPP and SF-SMDPP decreased, but the performance of S-SMDPP was similar to that under the conditions of o-DCB and room temperature. Thus, we discuss the photovoltaic performance of SCOSCs based on the photoactive layers fabricated from pure o-DCB without thermal annealing.
The J–V characteristics and external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of the optimized SCOSCs are demonstrated in Fig. 4 and the parameters of photovoltaic devices are collected in Table 1. S-SMDPP based cells provided a high PCE of 2.52% with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.73 eV, a Jsc of 8.03 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.43. It should be noted that this is among the highest PCEs of SCOSCs based on single-component small molecules (see also Fig. 1). Interestingly, this performance is also similar to that of DPP-based double-cable polymers, indicating that molecular dyads have great potential to realize high performance SCOSCs.28 For comparison, SMDPP-based cells obtained a lower PCE of 1.73% with a Voc of 0.68 eV, a Jsc of 5.65 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.45 than S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP based cells due to their low Voc and Jsc. Although SF-SMDPP provided the highest Voc of 0.83 eV in SCOSCs due to the introduction of the fluorine atom, the PCE was 2.04%, still lower than the PCE of S-SMDPP due to its low Jsc of 6.08 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.40. All these molecules display broad photoresponse in the range of 300–800 nm, and S-SMDPP showed a much higher EQE than those of SMDPP and SF-SMDPP (Fig. 4b). This confirms the high Jsc in S-SMDPP based SCOSCs. The EQEs of solar cells depend on the absorption spectra and the efficiency of exciton diffusion, dissociation and charge transport, which is further strongly related to the phase separation of the donor and acceptor based photoactive layers. Therefore, in these molecular dyads with similar absorption spectra, the nanophase separation between the donor and acceptor segments would significantly influence their charge generation efficiencies, as will be discussed in the following section.

2.5. Morphological studies by AFM
To understand the distinct performance of SCOSCs based on these small molecules, we utilized atomic force microscopy (AFM) to investigate their morphology. As illustrated in Fig. 5a–c, all three molecule thin films show fibrous structures, indicating their ordered nanostructures. When using high resolution phase images (Fig. 5d–f), it seems that the image of S-SMDPP presents uniform and long fibers compared to the other two images of SMDPP and SF-SMDPP with inhomogenous structures. The structures in S-SMDPP might create continuous channels for charge transport, partially explaining the high Jsc in solar cells. We also performed AFM measurements on the thin films fabricated from o-DCB/DIO solution and thermal annealing, as shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). It clearly showed that, when using DIO as an additive or upon thermal annealing, SMDPP and SF-SMDPP thin films have smooth surfaces without microphase separation, which might be responsible for the low PCEs under these conditions.

2.6. Nanophase separation in the molecular dyads
We then exploited grazing-incidence X-ray scattering, including wide-angle (GIWAXS) and medium-angle (GIMAXS) to investigate the aggregation and stacking of these small molecules in thin films spin-coated from o-DCB. As shown in the GIWAXS patterns in Fig. 6a–c and h and i, SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP all exhibit a clearly enhanced behavior of stacking, which is confirmed by the in-plane (IP) (h00) diffraction peaks. The intensities of the (h00) diffraction peaks are in the order of SMDPP > S-SMDPP > SF-SMDPP, which correspond to their degrees of crystallinity. In addition, we utilized the full width at half-maximum of the reflections to calculate the crystal correlation length (CL), with values of 8.7, 11.0 and 8.9 nm for SMDPP, S-SMDPP and SF-SMDPP at the IP (h00) diffraction peaks (Table 2). From the GIMAXS patterns in Fig. 6e–g, we can observe three scattering peaks from small to medium angles, indicating lamellar structures in thin films. The d-spacings calculated from the q1 peaks are ∼7.8 nm, indicating a new phase of these molecules. We infer that they might be attributed to the distance between the conjugated backbone and the two PBIs located between them, but the real structures are unclear and require more experiments. The CLs calculated from the q1 peaks also show similar trends to the GIWAXS measurements; that is, S-SMDPP has the highest CL (Table 2).

From the GIWAXS and GIMAXS results, we can conclude that S-SMDPP exhibited the strongest intensity of diffraction peaks and the largest CL among the double-cable small molecules developed in this work. The strongest intensity of the diffraction peaks indicated highly ordered aggregation and stacking in the thin film of S-SMDPP, and the largest CL demonstrated that S-SMDPP is more crystalline in thin film form, which helps charge transport more efficiently. Therefore, S-SMDPP achieved a high Jsc of 8.03 mA cm−2 and PCE of 2.52%.
3. Conclusion
In this work, we have developed three molecular dyads containing DPP connected with BDT as a donor and PBI as an acceptor, which were combined with dodecyl chains as linkers. When fabricating SCOSCs based on these molecules as active layer, a PCE of 2.52% could be achieved, which is among the highest PCEs of small molecule based SCOSCs. The studies further provide a clear clue that via inserting heteroatoms, such as sulfur and fluorine, into the backbone to tune the crystallinity of the small molecules, we can obtain well-ordered nanophase separation in these double-cable polymers. This can be confirmed by their fibrous structures in their AFM images and highly ordered diffraction peaks in GIMAXS measurements. With these studies, we envision that the structure of double-cable polymers provides a powerful strategy to design the corresponding single-component conjugated materials toward efficient SCOSCs.
