    , Accepted 18th September 2019First published on 19th September 2019AbstractIn order to understand the impact of side-chains on photovoltaic performance and explore efficient all-polymer solar cells, chemical modifications on donor–acceptor based polymers containing benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and thieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) backbones were performed. Via side-chain fluorination, the molecular design resulted in lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels and enhanced backbone planarity. The intermolecular packing and solid-state ordering were found to significantly improve. These factors are considered as key influences for carrier transport. In contrast, introducing a bulky alkylthio substituent group was found to slightly distort the polymer backbone. As a result of the lower HOMO level, PTF8 exhibits an improved open circuit voltage (Voc) compared to the template polymer PT8. However, due to the increased crystallinity and aggregation, PTF8 and PTS8 experience an unfavorable phase separation in polymer–polymer bulk heterojunction blends, hindering the PCE to about 4%. Through the introduction of alkylthio side-chains and fluorination, the polymer PTFS8 exhibits an extremely low HOMO level (−5.73 eV). This reduced HOMO level limits charge separation between the donor and acceptor polymers. Without any fluorination and alkylthio side-chains, the wide bandgap polymer PT8 exhibits desired HOMO energy levels and crystallinity, delivering a best PCE of 8% together with a high Voc of 1.05 V, displaying its great potential for applications in efficient all-polymer optoelectronic devices.
1. Introduction
Over the past few years, research on non-fullerene polymer solar cells has attracted tremendous interest.1–4 It has been shown that organic non-fullerene acceptors can broaden a material's absorption spectra and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) have been recorded to approach 16%.5,6 There have also been incredible strides towards developing efficient polymer–polymer (all-polymer) solar cells (all-PSCs).7,8 With this polymer–polymer setup, the active layer of the material exhibits outstanding thermal and mechanical stability.9 It was also shown that all-polymer solar cell devices experience reduced sensitivity to thermal stress,10 donor–acceptor (D–A) blend ratios,11 and the processing environment12 relative to the polymer-fullerene and polymer-molecule system. Although all-polymer solar cells present a plethora of advantages, PCEs for small-area devices have been limited to 4–6% for many years.7,13–15 Quite recently, there has been exciting progress in the synthesis of donor polymers by using D–A copolymerization. Solar cells based on these polymers have achieved PCEs in the range of 8–10%.10,16,17 In accordance with the rapid progress of polymer-small molecule non-fullerene solar cells, more efforts should be directed to further improving all-polymer based optoelectronic devices. Added emphasis should be assigned towards the molecular engineering of both donor and acceptor polymers, the device structure, and blend morphology.
The adoption of new device architectures such as tandem18 or ternary19 structures has been demonstrated to be a simple approach to further improve device performance. Very recently, a PCE of 8.3% was recorded using a tandem structure,20 which is the first efficient spectrally matched all-polymer tandem cell. An efficiency of 11% was achieved by Cao et al.21 using a tandem all-polymer assembly with identical sub-cells. A typical polymer tandem structure consists of a front cell with a large-bandgap material and a rear cell composed of a low-bandgap material. This orientation enables the photovoltaic device to expand its absorption gamut into different regions of the light spectrum. To date, most research efforts have focused on all-polymer devices with narrow-bandgap polymers with the aim to achieve a high short circuit current density (Jsc). Few reports indicate that wide-bandgap polymers could be used to improve the open circuit voltage (Voc) for high-efficiency wide bandgap all-polymer solar cells.22 The copolymer PT8 with alkyl thienyl side chain modified benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) acts as the donor monomer, and N-alkylthieno[3,4-c]pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) is employed as the acceptor monomer. The D–A combination of these polymers initially reported a PCE of 6% and exhibited a high Voc of 1.0 V in the polymer–PCBM solar cell devices.23 These copolymers demonstrate great potential as efficient PSCs because of their simultaneous high PCE and large Voc.
The goal of this project is to understand the impact of the side-chain on photovoltaic performance and explore efficient all-polymer solar cells. It has been generally shown that the incorporation of F induces a lower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level to achieve improved Voc in PSCs and can increase the electron affinity of conjugated polymers to facilitate electron transport in OFETs. Moreover, the formation of hydrogen bonding (F⋯H) for adjacent C–H and C–F units in the fluorinated conjugated materials can promote better polymer organization.24,25 In addition, a previous report26 indicated that introducing alkylthio side chains can effectively down-shift the HOMO levels (since the sulfur atom can function as a moderate π-acceptor group when the alkylthio chains are attached to the conjugated unit), red-shift the absorption, and improve the hole mobility of the resulting conjugated polymer donors. By introducing side-chain fluorination, the material experienced an improvement in its polymer planarity, which may consequently lead to a broader absorption gamut, higher charge mobility, and a deeper HOMO energy level. These material developments assist in reaching an increased Voc of up to 1.22 V. The alkylthio side-chains are appended to the thiophene moiety, which twists the polymer's backbone. Unfortunately, due to the increased crystallinity and aggregation, the fluorinated polymer PTF8 and the alkylthio substituted polymer PTS8 exhibit unfavorable phase separation in polymer–polymer bulk heterojunction blends. This inhibition hinders the PCE to about 4%. With optimal HOMO levels and polymer crystallinity, a best PCE of 8.0% together with a high Voc of 1.05 V was obtained in PT8-P(NDI2HD-T) wide bandgap all-polymer cells. These results exhibit the material's potential and make it a prime candidate for use as an efficient all-polymer solar cell.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Polymer synthesis
The preparation of PT8, PTF8, PTS8, and PTFS8 is detailed in Scheme 1. These polymers were synthesized using a Stille cross-coupling reaction between bis(trimethyl stannane) of BDT and the dibromides of TPD. BDT and TPD precursors are both commercially available and their synthesis is simple and results in high yields. All polymerization reactions with polymers consisting of different side-chains were carried out under similar conditions and all of them produced high yields (∼85%). The four polymers exhibit good solubility in commonly used solvents such as chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB). The molecular weight of the polymers and their polydispersity (PDI) were estimated via gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using monodispersed polystyrene as the standard and THF as the eluent (Table 1). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PT8, PTF8, PTS8, and PTFS8 is 37.2k, 36.8k, 32.5k and 24.9k g mol−1, respectively.

2.2 Optical and electrical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of the PT8 series of polymers are shown in Fig. 1 and Table 1. The polymer solutions in a chloroform solvent display a broad absorption gamut from 400 to 650 nm. For the polymers that underwent alkylthio substitution, both the polymers PTS8 and PTFS8 show a distinct shoulder peak next to the absorption maximum in their solution spectra. We further did more investigations on concentration and solvent influence, with the results shown in Fig. S1 and S2 (ESI†). Apparently, a distinct shoulder peak next to the absorption maximum could be observed in both concentrated and diluted PTS8 chloroform solutions, as well as in diluted PTS8 chlorobenzene solution. The distinct shoulder peak could be due to an extra transition as an electronic effect of the alkylthio group. It can be seen that the absorption peaks of the fluorinated polymers are slightly blue-shifted in their solution spectra (PTF8 vs. PT8, and PTFS8 vs. PTS8) and red-shifted in their thin film spectra. The slight blue-shift in the solution state may be attributed to changes in intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) energy due to fluorine electronic effects, and the red-shift in the solid state indicates better packing in the solid state in these fluorinated polymers. The solid state packing will be studied in the following part. No red-shift is observed between the absorption spectra in both the solution and solid state for the alkylthio substituted polymers (PTS8 vs. PT8, and PTFS8 vs. PTF8). Based on the onset of the film absorption spectra, optical energy gap values of 1.88 eV, 1.84 eV, 1.90 eV, and 1.86 eV were estimated for PT8, PTF8, PTS8, and PTFS8, respectively. Through these results, it can be deduced that by the introduction of bulkier substituents (alkylthio substitution) and fluorination, the polymer's bandgap can be easily adjusted in both solution and thin film states. This phenomenon is likely due to the changes in ICT energy and solid state ordering within the polymer.

Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to investigate the HOMO levels of the donor polymers. The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels were estimated using the energy bandgap (Eg) and HOMO values. As summarized in Fig. 2, the HOMO levels of PT8, PTF8, PTS8, and PTFS8 were measured as −5.33 eV, −5.60 eV, −5.36 eV, and −5.73 eV, respectively. The corresponding LUMO energy levels were calculated as −3.45 eV, −3.76 eV, −3.46 eV, and −3.87 eV. As shown in Fig. 2b, the fluorinated polymers PTF8 and PTFS8 display deeper HOMO energy levels than those of the non-fluorinated and alkylthio substituted polymers. By introducing the alkylthio side-chains to PT8 and PTF8, the polymer's HOMO and LUMO levels are slightly down-shifted, which yields a larger bandgap. The incorporation of F atoms does not cause a significant steric hindrance due to the similar atomic radii of F and H (van der Waals radius, r = 1.35 Å, comparable to H, r = 1.2 Å).27,28 However, fluorine has a much larger electronegativity (EN) value in comparison to hydrogen.24 This large difference in EN largely affects the energy levels of the material. In addition, formation of the non-covalent interaction and hydrogen bonding (F–H) in the fluorinated conjugated materials can promote a better intra- and inter-molecular level of organization, respectively.25

2.3 Molecular geometry and solid-state packing
To gain further insights into the preferred molecular conformations of each polymer and the influence of repeating units on the backbone planarity, density functional theory (DFT) simulations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level29 for the hexamer model based on the four polymers were performed. Fig. 3 and Table 2 show the corresponding results obtained from the DFT calculations and list the dihedral angles between each unit on the backbone, and the calculated LUMO, HOMO and Eg values are listed in Table 2. In comparison with the experimental results (Table 1), the DFT results exhibit a similar trend. Both side-chain fluorination and alkylthio substitutions can down shift the LUMO and HOMO energy levels. The calculated polymer backbone dihedral angles in PTF8/PT8 and PTS8/PTF8 are very similar, indicating that the side-chain fluorination will not significantly alter the polymer backbone planarity. In contrast, the corresponding polymer backbone dihedral angles of PTS8 and PTFS are slightly increased relative to those in PT8 and PTF8, respectively. F substitution has less effect on the planarity of either the side thiophene ring or the polymer backbone, while the alkylthio substitutions have more impact on the polymer backbone planarity. Therefore, the theoretical simulation results reveal the planarity of these polymers sharing the same backbone while having different side groups. In general, F substitution will not alter the backbone planarity, and the hydrogen bonding (F–H) in the fluorinated conjugated materials could further promote a better inter-molecular level of organization for improved solid state absorption. In comparison, the alkylthio substitution would slightly distort the polymer backbone.

To comprehensively understand the aggregation behavior and tendencies of the polymers in the solid-state, the morphology of the pristine polymer thin films was studied using GIWAXS measurements.30 All of the pristine polymer films were prepared by spin-coating from chloroform solutions under identical conditions (10 mg mL−1). As shown in Fig. 4, all of the polymers exhibit a broad and relatively strong (010) diffraction peak at ∼1.6 Å in the out-of-plane direction. This corresponds to a preferable face-on packing orientation of polymers. In addition, the polymers also display a sharp (100) diffraction peak at ∼0.2 Å in the in-plane direction, which corresponds to the alkyl chain ordering in the films. The (100) alkyl diffraction peak of polymers PTS8 and PTFS8 is less anisotropic compared to that of PT8 and PTF8, which may be attributed to their bulkier side groups and twisted backbone. In addition, the corresponding “π–π stacking” distance (average distance between two polymer backbones) is 3.74 Å, 3.68 Å, 3.69 Å, and 3.65 Å, for PT8, PTF8, PTS8, and PTFS8, respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†). These results indicate that both fluorination and alkylthio substitution could enhance interaction between polymer backbones. Meanwhile, the “alkyl-stacking” distances (average distance between polymer side-chains) are also calculated to be 22.8 Å, 23.2 Å, 26.2 Å, and 24.4 Å for the aforementioned four polymers (Fig. S4, ESI†). The fluorination and alkylthio substitution cause bulkier side-chains, which may hinder the “alkyl-stacking” interaction, resulting in an increased packing distance. This result is in accordance with the size of the polymer side-chains. In addition, the crystal correlation lengths (CCLs) are calculated from Gaussian fitting of the “lamellar” and π-stacking diffraction peaks to evaluate the polymer crystallization.31 It should be noted that the value of the CCL does not directly correspond to the crystallite size in the film due to peak broadening from disorder. However, comparing the CCL values of the acceptor polymers may still provide useful insights to understand their different performance. As shown in Fig. 4, the CCL of the (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction exhibits the following order: PTF8 > PTFS8 > PT8 > PTS8. Similarly, the CCL of (100) in the in-plane direction shows the same order: PTF8 > PTFS8 > PT8 > PTS8. The comparison results reveal that fluorinated polymers generally exhibit a more ordered structure in solid films. In addition, the different side-chain based polymers also affect the film crystallization. Therefore, the GIWAXS measurement indicates that fluorination can improve the polymer backbone planarity and hence enhance solid-state packing. The red-shift in the thin film absorption and the increased CCL in solid-state films indicate a larger crystallite and more ordered local structures in the polymer films, which may lead to enhanced carrier transport.

2.4 All-polymer solar cell performance
As shown in Fig. 5a, the photovoltaic performance of these donor polymers using NDI-based acceptor polymers P(NDI2HD-T) was further investigated. The all-PSC device structure is ITO/PEDOT:PSS/all-polymer blend/PFN-Br/Al. PSCs with a PT8 and P(NDI2HD-T) bulk heterojunction blend were first reported by Kim et al. with a best PCE of 6.7%.9 To further optimize the device processing conditions and properties, adjustments were made to the polymer/polymer blend weight ratio, total solid concentration, processing additives, and post thermal annealing (Tables S1–S11, ESI†). Chloroform was selected as the best processing solvent for all polymers. The optimal polymer/polymer weight ratio was determined to be 1.3:1, with a total solid concentration of 13 mg mL−1 for all polymers. The solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was introduced to further enhance device performance. This additive has been recently proven to be an effective supplement to improve the morphology of polymer–polymer films.32 PCEs of 4.66%, 2.83%, 2.31%, and 0.50% were achieved without introducing the additive for devices based on PT8, PTF8, PTS8, and PTFS8, respectively. The relatively low PCE of PTFS8-based devices can be attributed to the extremely low HOMO levels. These low energy levels result in a marginal HOMO–HOMO offset between the donor and acceptor polymers. As shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), the Eg and the HOMO energy level of the acceptor polymer P(NDI2HD-T) were further explored. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the photoluminescence of the donor polymers PT8, PTF8, and PTS8 and acceptor P(NDI2HD-T) is well quenched, indicating an efficient charge transfer. In contrast, the PTFS8:P(NDI2HD-T) blend exhibits improved photoluminescence, indicating a much less efficient charge transfer. After the addition of 1% DIO and annealing the compound at 120 °C for 15 min, improved PCEs of 8.00%, 4.01%, 3.65%, and 0.63% were obtained. The photovoltaic parameters and the current density–voltage curves (J–V curves) of the solar cells under illumination (AM 1.5G 100 mW cm−2) are shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5b. The enhancement of the PCEs is mainly due to the improved fill factor (FF) and Jsc. It is worth noting that devices based on PT8 exhibit a significantly higher efficiency than devices using PTF8. This efficiency is also much higher than that of devices based on PTS8, which has the same backbone but with a non-bulky side-chain. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was further measured to evaluate the photoresponse of these all-polymer blends and to calibrate the Jsc data (Fig. 5c). The Jsc was calculated by integrating the EQE curve with an AM 1.5G reference spectrum within a 5% error margin and comparing this value to the corresponding Jsc obtained from the J–V curves. Due to the similar optical energy gap, all four of the all-polymer blends show a similar photoresponse in the region of 300–700 nm. PTFS8:P(NDI2HD-T) blends show the lowest monochromatic EQE value of less than 10%, which may be attributed to the less efficient charge-transfer. Quite unexpectedly, the EQE value of both PTF8:P(NDI2HD-T) and PTS8:P(NDI2HD-T) is significantly lower compared to that of PT8:P(NDI2HD-T). These unexpected results require further testing to determine the correlation between the device performance and the photovoltaic properties of these donor polymers.

In order to understand the major effect of donor polymer properties on device performance, several tests on charge generation, transport, and recombination were performed. The dependence of the photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) was first recorded under illumination at 100 mW cm−2. Jph is equal to JL − JD, where JL and JD are the measured currents under illumination and in the dark, respectively.33Veff is equal to V0 − Va, where V0 is the voltage when Jph is zero and Vappl is the applied voltage. As shown in Fig. 5d, at a low effective voltage below 0.5 V, with the exception of PTFS8:P(NDI2HD-T), the Jph of all devices increases drastically and reaches a plateau at higher voltages. This suggests that free charges are swept out efficiently. In comparison, the Jph values of PTF8:P(NDI2HD-T) and PTS8:P(NDI2HD-T) increase at a slower rate, indicating less efficient carrier extraction. More importantly, the Jph of PT8:P(NDI2HD-T) is significantly larger than that of the PTF8 and PTS8 based devices at a normal device operational voltage, which is in accordance with its lower Jsc value. Therefore, the low Jph density suggests that the carrier generation process for PTF8 and PTS8 must be less efficient than that for the PT8 based material, which can be attributed to the different blend morphologies. In addition, their different dark J–V characteristics in Fig. S8 (ESI†) show that the PTF8 and PTS8 based devices exhibit a lower rectification ratio and a higher leakage current under reverse bias compared to the PT8:P(NDI2HD-T) based device, indicating increased carrier recombination. The charge transport properties of each polymer were also examined. Charge carrier mobility is another important factor that affects solar cell device performance. To compare the charge transport properties, hole only diodes (Fig. S9, ESI†) were fabricated and measured, with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/blend/MoO3 (8 nm)/Ag (100 nm). As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the hole mobilities of PT8, PTF8, PTS8, and PTFS8 are 3.2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, 3.1 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, 2.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, and 4.8 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The alkylthio substituted polymer exhibits lower mobilities, which may explain its lower Jsc and FF values. However, the fluorinated polymer PTF8 exhibits the highest hole mobility, which is about one order of magnitude higher relative to PT8. All these results further demonstrate the importance of investigating the blend morphology to understand its major effect on the charge transport and device performance.
2.5 All-polymer solar cell characterization
According to many reports, the charge generation, dissociation, and transport processes are strongly influenced by the polymer/PCBM or polymer/polymer blend morphology.34,35 Therefore, a thorough morphological study may be helpful to understand the less efficient carrier generation and transport process in all-polymer solar cells. The morphology of all-polymer blend films was first examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 6a–d). As shown in Fig. 6b, the fluorinated polymer PTF8 displayed an increased degree of crystallinity and intermolecular organization. These properties can assist the crystallization process and lead to a much rougher surface (RMS: 2.8 nm). The enhanced packing and reduced π–π stacking distance can also assist the polymer by promoting polymer demixing, which leads to a larger domain size. Meanwhile, by adopting the alkylthio substituent, the increased side-chain bulkiness can prevent the intercalation of donor and acceptor polymers in its solution-state. This substituent also leads to a slightly rougher surface (RMS: 1.5 nm). However, the PTFS8:P(NDI2HD-T) blend exhibits a modest surface roughness of 1.7 nm, which may be due to the different polymer molecular weight. In order to gain insight into the polymer–polymer phase separation, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were captured. The film morphologies can be seen in Fig. 6e and f. For the PT8:P(NDI2HD-T) blend, the donor polymer exhibits a short nanofiber structure, and a moderate D–A phase separation, which is favorable for charge separation and transport. In addition, the length of the polymer fiber was further enhanced in the PTF8:P(NDI2HD-T) blend. However, this blend also exhibits a polymer–polymer demixing morphology. A donor polymer fiber structure could be observed and the size of both donor polymer-rich domains is estimated to be over 20 nm. Based on the TEM results, PTF8 exhibits improved molecular packing, which is beneficial for charge transport. However, it is not surprising that it delivers an inferior photovoltaic performance in comparison to PT8. Meanwhile, both the PTS8 and PTFS8 blends show a strong phase separated morphology and a long-range order of polymer acceptors, which can be observed in the TEM images. As previously mentioned, PTS8 and PTFS8 with bulkier side-chains exhibit strong aggregation in the solution-state. The increased bulkiness can prevent the intercalation of D–A polymers at the molecular level. According to previous reports, NDI-based polymers exhibit stronger crystallinity and aggregation properties, which may explain the large acceptor domain within these two all-polymer blends, as well as the dramatically decreased solar cell performance. Based on these results, it can be concluded that the polymer energy level and morphology are critical for the design of both the donor and acceptor polymers for all-PSCs.

3. Conclusion
By introducing fluorination and adopting alkylthio modifying side-chains, a series of D–A acceptor polymers based on BDT–TPD backbone structures was designed and synthesized. These modifications provided control of the material's photovoltaic properties for wide bandgap all-polymer solar cells. The intermolecular packing of these polymers was determined by their backbone coplanarity, resulting in improved crystallinity in the solid film. This is proven via UV-vis absorption, DFT simulation, and GIWAXS results. Optimized all-polymer solar cells using P(NDI2HD-T) as an electron acceptor demonstrated a high PCE of 8.0% with a high Voc of 1.05 V, which is among the reported high performance all-polymer solar cell devices. The improved device performance may be attributed to the matched crystallinity of the donor/acceptor polymers, which can lead to the optimal phase separation morphology balancing charge transport. This work outlines the key factors (energy level, molecular packing, and balanced D/A polymer crystallinity) to optimize the photovoltaic properties of current acceptor polymers and provides an insight in achieving high performance all-polymer solar cells by using energy level and crystallinity matched donor/acceptor polymers.
4. Experimental section
BDT–tin monomers were purchased from Suna Tech Inc, and TPD-Br was prepared according to the literature.23 PFN-Br was purchased from 1-Materials Inc. P(NDI2HD-T) was prepared according to our previous report.9 All the chemicals were purchased and used as received.
4.1 Synthesis of donor polymers
PT8 polymers were prepared using Stille cross-coupling polymerization under similar conditions. In an inert atmosphere, in a 50 mL reaction flask, the compound BDT–tin (0.3 mmol), TPD-Br (0.13 g, 0.3 mmol), the catalytic system: Pd2(dba)3 (0.01 g), tri(o-tolyl)phosphine (0.02 g), and solvent: ultra-dry toluene/DMF (5/0.5 mL) were mixed together. The reaction system was gradually heated up to 110 °C and stirred for 48 hours. The mixture was then cooled and poured into 80 mL of acetone. For the purification of these polymers, the precipitate was collected and washed in a Soxhlet extractor step-by-step with acetone (14 h) and hexane (12 h) to remove the catalysts, ligands, and oligomers. Finally, the polymer was extracted with chloroform, concentrated, and precipitated in acetone. The precipitate was collected and dried in a vacuum at 80 °C overnight. PT8: obtained as a dark purple solid (231 mg, 85%), GPC: Mn = 37200 g mol−1, PDI = 2.2. PTF8: obtained as a dark purple solid (245 mg, 87%), GPC: Mn = 36800 g mol−1, PDI = 2.4. PT8: obtained as a dark purple solid (243 mg, 86%), GPC: Mn = 32500 g mol−1, PDI = 2.3. PT8: obtained as a dark purple solid (252 mg, 89%), GPC: Mn = 24900 g mol−1, PDI = 2.7.
4.2 All-polymer solar cell fabrication and characterization
The structure of all-polymer solar cells was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/blend/PFN-Br/Al. Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sequential ultrasonic treatment in detergent, acetone, deionized water, and isopropyl alcohol. The organic residue was further removed by treating with UV-ozone for 10 min. A thin film of PEDOT:PSS (∼40 nm) was spin-coated onto the ITO substrates and dried at 150 °C for 10 min. For the bulk heterojunction devices, donor/acceptor all-polymer blend solutions (13 mg mL−1) in chloroform (1% DIO v/v) were kept at 40 °C for at least 8 h. The all-polymer active layer was spin-coated onto the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer at 2000 rpm for 60 s, which was thermally annealed at 120 °C for 15 min in a glovebox. PFN-Br in methanol (0.5 mg mL−1) was then spin-coated onto the top of the all-polymer active layer at 5000 rpm for 40 s. Finally, 100 nm Al (2 Å s−1) layers were then thermally evaporated onto the active layer at a pressure of 1.0 × 10−6 mbar through a shadow mask (active area 7.25 mm2). The current density–voltage characteristics of the photovoltaic cells were measured using a Keithley 2400 (I–V) digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2 (Newport, Class AAA solar simulator, 94023A-U). Solar cell devices were measured under forward scan (−1.3 V → 1.3 V, step 0.0125 V, scan rate: 0.1 V s−1) without an illumination mask in a glovebox.
