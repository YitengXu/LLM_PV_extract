    , Accepted 6th January 2020First published on 6th January 2020AbstractA novel strategy to improve the performance of fibre-shaped dye-sensitized solar cells (FDSSCs) has been successfully implemented using a polar polymer interlayer made of poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOx). The inclusion of the PEOx interlayer reduces the typical defect sites and interband trap sites that exist on the TiO2-nanotube-based photoanode of the FDSSC. A local built-in electric field, induced by the interfacial intrinsic polarity of the PEOx interlayer, promotes facile photogenerated charge injection/extraction kinetics at the TiO2/dye interface. The negative polarity present on the bottom part of the PEOx chain exhibits an electronic doping-like behaviour, passivating the TiO2 defect sites and reducing trap-assisted recombination, while the positive polarity present on the top part of the PEOx chain provides dye-rich anchoring sites to improve the N719 dye adsorption loading on the TiO2 surface. The charge collection efficiency, short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor of FDSSCs with the novel TiO2@PEOx photoanodes are superior than those of FDSSCs with traditional TiO2 photoanodes, by approximately 16.94%, 8.57%, 14.08%, and 6.58%, respectively. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the proposed FDSSC is considerably improved, reaching 11.22%. Thus, the PCE of the proposed FDSSC is improved by approximately 32.16% compared with that of the traditional FDSSC.
Introduction
The market demand for smart, wearable textiles with self-charging capabilities has been predicted to increase drastically in the coming years.1–4 Smart textiles require a wearable, renewable power resource, and a fibre-shaped dye-sensitized solar cell (FDSSC) is a good candidate for this application because it possesses several ergonomic features, such as light weight, good stitchability, geometrical compatibility with the irregular human epidermal surface, and the capability to be integrated into fabrics.5–9 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of current FDSSCs has not yet reached a practical level.
An FDSSC typically contains a ruthenium (Ru)-complex dye-adsorbed titanium dioxide (TiO2) photoanode deposited on a titanium (Ti) wire substrate, a platinum (Pt) wire counter electrode, and an iodide/triiodide (I−/I3−) redox couple electrolyte in an organic solvent. The performance of the FDSSC is strongly dependent on the interfacial characteristics of the TiO2 photoanode, because the photogenerated charge injection/extraction and charge transport occur primarily at the TiO2 photoanode/dyes/electrolyte interfaces. In traditional TiO2 layers, high-density interfacial defect sites (e.g. a dangling bond or oxygen vacancy) cause interfacial recombination of photogenerated electrons with the oxidized dye molecules and I3− electrolyte acceptors.10,11 In addition, N719 dye is adsorbed on the classical TiO2 surface through a COO–Ti bond, with an ester-like linkage between a carboxylic acid group (–COOH) of the N719 dye and a hydroxyl group (Ti–OH) at the TiO2 surface. Further, the esterification process produces a byproduct, H2O, which forms additional defect and interband electronic trap sites on the TiO2 photoanode surface, reduces the light–charge harvest capability and the charge-transport injection/extraction kinetics at the TiO2/dye interface, and consequently degrades the cell performance. Moreover, the H2O byproduct also reduces dye loading by encouraging the desorption of Ru-based dyes through a hydrolysis reaction at the TiO2/dye interface.12,13
To address these problems, the interfacial characteristics of the TiO2 layer are typically treated with a TiCl4 modifier through a hydrolysis process. This not only reduces the interband trap-assisted recombination sites in the TiO2 photoanode, but also improves dye loading, owing to an increased surface area of the TiO2 layer.14–16 However, the industrial use of TiCl4 for treating FDSSCs is prevented by several limitations, such as the rapid, irreversible degradation of TiCl4 under ambient conditions, the hazardous nature of TiCl4 due to its acidity, and the hostile environment resulting from the inorganic characteristics of TiCl4.11,17–20 Thus, the inclusion of environmentally-friendly constructive interlayers with charge-selective capabilities is necessary to simultaneously reduce the interfacial defect and interband electronic trap sites in the TiO2 photoanode, enhance the charge-transport injection/extraction rates, and improve the dye loading. An ideal interlayer for a photoanode should meet several criteria: it should including have strong light absorption, good transparency, and a high electron injection rate; it should be able to passivate the vacant TiO2 photoanode surface, that is, the region of the TiO2 surface without any dye; it should not exhibit any competitive adsorption with the dye; it should prevent dye aggregation on the TiO2 surface, thereby providing sufficient binding sites for the dye to on the TiO2 surface; and it should be easy and simple to prepare for large-scale production. Previously, metal-oxide interlayers have been widely used in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs).21–23 However, metal-oxide-based materials generally suffer from poor light absorption and slow electron injection rates. To successfully improve DSSC performance, Sönmezoglu et al. reduced defect sites in the TiO2 photoanode by introducing a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecule interlayer on the TiO2 surface.24 However, the inherent difficulty in handling DNA-based biomaterial has hindered its wide employment in DSSCs. Alternatively, a polymer-based dipole material is considered a promising interlayer candidate when it is introduced into the metal-oxide electron transport layer (ETL) of quantum dot and perovskite solar cells, because the permanent dipole moment induced by the polymer-based dipole interlayer enhances the photogenerated electron injection/extraction kinetic rate.25–27 In addition, the free-like electrons generated by the dipole formation, during the attachment of the interlayer to the ETL, passivate the defect sites present on the metal-oxide ETL.
In this study, the interfacial characteristics of the TiO2/N719 dye have been modified by introducing an environmentally-friendly, chemically stable, room-temperature, solution-processed, low-cost poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOx) interlayer, utilizing a commonly used material in biomedical applications28,29 to enhance the FDSSC performance. As demonstrated in Scheme 1, the effect of several expected features of the PEOx interlayer are briefly described here: (1) the intrinsic permanent dipole moment of the PEOx interlayer enhances the photogenerated electron injection/extraction kinetic rates at the TiO2/N719 dye interface by increasing the built-in electric field, and subsequently the built-in voltage (Vbi), at the interfacial depletion region, resulting in improvements to the short-circuit current density (JSC) of the FDSSC; (2) the delocalized free electrons in the enolate group, present on the negative-polarity part of PEOx chain, exhibits an electronic doping-like behaviour that passivates the TiO2 defect sites, yielding a reduction in both the electronic recombination and interfacial ohmic resistance at the TiO2/N719 dye interface that enhances the Fermi energy (EF) level of TiO2 and subsequently improves the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF); (3) the positive polarity in the iminium group of the PEOx chain spreads within the polymer configuration and behaves as an anchoring agent for the N719 dye, providing dye-rich anchoring sites and enhancing JSC by increasing dye loading. In addition, the beneficial effects of the PEOx interlayer insertion on FDSSC performance have been demonstrated, and their origin has been investigated.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the expected features resulted from the PEOx interlayer: (1) to enhance the charge-light harvesting capability of FDSSC by passivating the defect sites of TiO2 photoanode and increasing the built-in electric field (i.e. the greater built-in voltage (Vbi)), (2) to enhance the photogenerated electron injection/extraction rates at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, and (3) to improve dye loading on TiO2 photoanode surface. 
Results and discussion
The FDSSC structure, shown in Fig. 1a, consists of a Ti wire/N719-dye-sensitized TiO2 photoanode, a Pt wire counter electrode, and an iodine-based electrolyte, and is prepared via the process systematically depicted in Fig. S1 and S2.† The TiO2 nanotube photoanode was prepared by an anodizing process (Fig. S2†).30 Notably, the PEOx interlayer sandwiched into the TiO2/N719 dye interface possesses a hydrophobic electron-donating part (an iminium group) and a hydrophilic electron-withdrawal part (an enolate group), which induce an interfacial permanent dipole moment (μ), as depicted in Fig. S3.† The proposed binding configuration of the polar PEOx interlayer (Fig. 1b) illustrates that the negative-polarity O atom of the PEOx interlayer binds to the Ti atom from the defect sites of TiO2 photoanode, whereas the positive-polarity N atom binds to the negative-polarity O atom from the carboxylic acid backbone of the N719 dye. Once PEOx meets TiO2, the lone-pair electron of the N atom, from the amide chain of PEOx, is spontaneously delocalized and transforms the amide chain from the OC–N bond to the –O–CN– bond, which induces the formation of positive and negative polarities at the edges of the iminium and enolate groups of the PEOx chain, respectively.31 Moreover, the hydrophobic nature of the iminium group in the PEOx chain allows the group to resist H2O-based byproducts produced from the esterification between the iminium group in PEOx and the carboxylic acid group of the N719 dye during the dye anchoring process. Fig. S4† shows the 3D molecular model of the PEOx interlayer material binding at the TiO2/N719 dye interface with monomer, dimer, and trimer configurations. Clearly, steric hindrance can occur between the PEOx interlayer and TiO2 if the oligomer chain length and/or PEOx concentration is increased, so these parameters must be optimized to carefully balance the advantageous effects and the steric hindrance of PEOx at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, to achieve the best possible performance of TiO2@PEOx FDSSCs.

To prove that the interfacial electronic properties of the TiO2 photoanode are modified by the inclusion of the PEOx interlayer, the full-range spectra of ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) characterization was analysed, as shown in Fig. S5.†Fig. 1c shows that in the UPS cut-off region, both the work function and EF level decrease considerably, dropping from 4.48 to 3.83 and from 2.70 to 3.15 eV, respectively, when PEOx is added to the photoanode. This is attributed to the shift-up phenomena of the TiO2 work function and EF, which originates from the permanent dipole moment induced by the PEOx interlayer.32 The shifting-up of the TiO2 conduction band (CB) on the TiO2@PEOx sample, as observed in the UPS data in Fig. 1c, does not reduce the driving force for the photogenerated electron injection/extraction at the TiO2/N719 dye interface. In addition, the dipole moment of the PEOx interlayer does not attract any counterion, such as TBA+, from the N719 dye. The positive polarity and the larger depletion region at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, caused by the doping-like behaviour of the PEOx interlayer dipole, could block the TBA+ from migrating from the dye into the TiO2 region.
The electron-rich nature of the electron-withdrawal part in PEOx causes an electron to be donated to the TiO2 photoanode to passivate the defect sites, causing the EF level to increase. To illustrate this clearly, the energy diagrams of FDSSCs, both with and without PEOx modification, are shown in Fig. 1d and Scheme 1. Overall, the TiO2/N719 dye interface can be analysed as a p–n junction, with TiO2 and the N719 dye acting as n-type and p-type materials, respectively. In particular, when TiO2 attaches to N719 dye material at the equilibrium condition, with no external energy applied, a TiO2/N719 dye interface is formed. The EF of both TiO2 and N719 dye align and then remain at the same level. Further, the CB and valence band (VB) of TiO2 align with those of the N719 dye to produce band bending at the TiO2/N719 dye interface. In addition, when it attaches to the TiO2, a dipole is induced on the edge of the PEOx interlayer between the negative-polarity enolate group at the bottom of the PEOx, near the TiO2, and the positive-polarity iminium group at the top of the PEOx, near the N719 dye molecules. These polarities exhibit a doping-like behaviour, which provides a structural base to enhance the photogenerated charge injection/extraction kinetics from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the N719 dye into the CB of the TiO2 photoanode. The negative and positive polarities donate electrons to TiO2 and holes to the N719 dye, respectively. The donated electrons increase the electron density and passivate defect sites in TiO2, yielding an increased EF and a decreased work function for TiO2. Similarly, the donated holes increase the hole density of the N719 dye. Consequently, band bending at the TiO2/N719 dye interface is increased, indicating that the depletion region and built-in electric field at the interface has been enhanced, subsequently increasing the Vbi. Thus, compared to the conventional TiO2-based FDSSCs, the TiO2/N719 interface in the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSCs possesses a higher Vbi, which could enhance the photogenerated electron injection/extraction rates, thereby improving the JSC. Moreover, electron donation from the PEOx interlayer into TiO2 passivates defect sites in TiO2, resulting in a shifting-up of the work function and EF levels, (i.e. an increase in work function and a decrease in EF), and a reduction in the reverse leakage current density to enhance the VOC and FF values.
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. S6† show that both the blank-TiO2 and TiO2@PEOx photoanodes possess almost the same TiO2 tube morphologies, with a tube diameter, wall thickness, and hole diameter of ∼200 nm, ∼30 nm, and ∼170 nm, respectively. There are almost no morphological and structural differences between the blank-TiO2 and TiO2@PEOx surfaces, implying that the PEOx interlayer is too thin to be detected physically by SEM. The existence of the PEOx interlayer on the surface of the TiO2 photoanode is chemically confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analyses. The analysis results are shown in Fig. 2a–d and S7,† and the summarized XPS results are listed in Tables S1 and S2.† The full-range XPS spectra of the blank-TiO2 and TiO2@PEOx samples in Fig. 2a show Ti 2p, O 1s, and C 1s peaks originating from the Ti wire, TiO2 layer, and commonly observed surface contamination, respectively. In contrast, the N 1s peak is observed in the TiO2@PEOx sample only. The EDS spectra (Fig. S6a and b†) verify that N appears only in the TiO2@PEOx sample. Here, N originates from the iminium group of the PEOx interlayer, indicating the existence of the PEOx interlayer on the TiO2@PEOx surface.

As shown in Fig. 2b, the three N 1s de-convoluted peaks of TiO2@PEOx located at 398.53, 400.05, and 401.90 eV denote the presence of NC, N–CO, and N–C bonds of iminium, amide, and enolate groups, respectively, in the PEOx interlayer.33,34 The presence of these bonds agrees with that of the –O–CN– bond illustrated in Fig. S3b† and further supports, in significant detail, the presence of the PEOx interlayer in the TiO2@PEOx sample. According to our previous discussion, the existence of the NC bond confirms robust bonding between the Ti atoms from defect sites in the TiO2 layer and the negative-polarity O atom in the enolate functional group of the PEOx interlayer.

Fig. 2c, S7c and d, along with Table S2,† present the Ti 2p, C 1s and O 1s XPS spectra and detailed XPS results of the blank-TiO2 and TiO2@PEOx samples. The C–O and/or C–N (286.50 and 531.63 eV, respectively), CO and/or CN (287.42 and 530.63 eV, respectively), OC–N (288.40 eV), and O–CO (288.78 and 532.50 eV) bonds from the C 1s and O 1s XPS de-convoluted spectra of the TiO2@PEOx sample (Fig. S7c and d†) are attributed to the amide (OC–N, C–N, and CO bonds), iminium (CN bond), and enolate (C–O bond) groups, respectively, of the PEOx interlayer, and thereby also support the existence of the PEOx interlayer in the TiO2@PEOx sample. In contrast, the OC–N de-convoluted peak is absent from the C 1s and O 1s XPS spectra in the blank-TiO2 sample. Moreover, the lower C–O (1.94%) and CO (4.66%) bond contents in the blank-TiO2 sample, compared to the TiO2@PEOx sample (9.87% and 5.99%, respectively) indicates the absence of the PEOx interlayer on the blank-TiO2 sample. In the TiO2@PEOx sample, the higher content of C–O (9.87%) bond than both of the CO (5.99%) and OC–N (5.41%) bonds indicates that the PEOx interlayer is successfully bound to the TiO2 surface with the transformed PEOx structure, as illustrated in Fig. S3b.†
The Ti 2p XPS spectra in Fig. 2c splits into two peaks, Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2, and each of these peaks has two de-convoluted peaks, Ti3+ and Ti4+. The Ti4+ de-convoluted peaks are attributed to the Ti atom at the anatase crystalline TiO2 lattice region, whereas the Ti3+ de-convoluted peaks are attributed to the Ti atom at the defect sites with imperfect oxygen bonding, an oxygen vacancy, and/or the presence of a hydroxyl group in the TiO2 layer. The intensity of the Ti 2p peaks in the TiO2@PEOx sample is lower than that in the blank-TiO2 sample, owing to the presence of the thin PEOx interlayer on the TiO2@PEOx surface. Contrarily, the TiO2@PEOx sample possesses a lower content of Ti3+ (1.15% and 1.08%) than those in the blank-TiO2 sample (3.51% and 10.15%, respectively). Meanwhile, on the O 1s XPS spectra, the TiO2@PEOx sample possesses a lower content of O2− oxygen vacancy (0.08%) and O–H hydroxyl group (0.67%) than the blank-TiO2 sample (4.55% and 1.78%, respectively). It is important to note that, compared to blank-TiO2 sample, the lower content of Ti3+, O2− oxygen vacancy, and O–H hydroxyl group in the TiO2@PEOx sample is associated with the suppression of defect sites on the TiO2 surface, due to the presence of free electrons with doping-like behaviour in the electron withdrawal portion of the PEOx interlayer. On the other hand, the de-convoluted Ti 2p XPS spectra in Fig. 2c indicates that, unlike the blank-TiO2 sample, the TiO2@PEOx sample shows a down-shifting binding energy behaviour in the regions of both the Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 peaks. This behaviour is attributed to the presence of a higher electron density around Ti atoms in the TiO2 layer in the TiO2@PEOx sample. Ti atoms located at or nearby to TiO2 defect sites receive free-like electrons with doping-like behaviour, generated by the electron withdrawal portion of the PEOx interlayer. Furthermore, these free-like electrons improve the electron density around Ti atoms and passivate the defect sites on the TiO2 surface.35 The lower full width at half maximum (FWHM) value of the Ti3+ peak (0.75 and 1.39 eV) and the higher FWHM value of the Ti4+ peak (1.36 and 1.99 eV) for the TiO2@PEOx sample, compared to the blank-TiO2 (1.39 and 5.00 eV for Ti3+ and 1.30 and 1.94 eV for Ti4+) also support the aforementioned phenomena.36
The greater intensity of the C–N, CN, and CO vibrational FT-IR signals in the TiO2@PEOx sample than in the blank-TiO2 sample (Fig. 2d) further confirms the existence of the PEOx interlayer on the TiO2 surface. In addition, the weaker O–H vibrational peak in the TiO2@PEOx sample confirms the successful suppression of the defect hydroxyl group sites on the TiO2 surface. This observation is in good agreement with the observation of a lower O–H O 1s de-convoluted XPS peak (Fig. S7d and Table S2†) and lower Ti3+ Ti 2p de-convoluted XPS peaks (Fig. 2c) for the TiO2@PEOx sample than the blank-TiO2.
To clarify our proposed strategy of using the PEOx interlayer as an anchoring agent for N719 dye on the TiO2 surface to improve dye loading, XPS (Fig. 2e–g, Tables S1 and S3†), FT-IR (Fig. 2h), and EDS (Fig. S8a and b†) analysis were carried out on the blank-TiO2 and TiO2@PEOx samples after immersing them in N719 dye solution for 24 h. The full-range XPS spectra of the blank-TiO2 and TiO2@PEOx samples (Fig. 2e) show several XPS peaks, such as Ru 3d and S 2s, which do not exist in the samples before N719 dye immersion (Fig. 2a). The Ru 3d and S 2s peaks originate from the Ru located in the centre of the N719 dye molecule and the NCS (NCS) backbone of the N719 dye absorbed onto the blank-TiO2 and TiO2@PEOx samples, respectively. The N719 dye loading in the TiO2@PEOx sample is higher than that in the blank-TiO2 one, as indicated by the higher Ru, S, and N XPS de-convoluted peak intensities (Fig. 2e) and atomic content (Table S1†). The EDS results, which agree with the full-range XPS results (Fig. 2e, and Table S1†), confirm the higher Ru, S, and N atomic content in the TiO2@PEOx photoanode compared to the blank-TiO2 photoanode. In addition, as shown in Fig. 2f and g and S7c,† the peak intensity of the C 1s, Ru 3d, and N 1s XPS regions of the TiO2@PEOx photoanode surpass those of the blank-TiO2 photoanode, qualitatively confirming superior N719 dye loading on the TiO2@PEOx than the blank-TiO2 surface. The three de-convoluted peaks of NCS, pyridine (C5H5N), and tetrabutylammonium (TBA, [N(C4H9)4]+) bonds in the N 1s spectra shown in Fig. 2f are attributed to the N719 dye components adsorbed on the photoanodes. The higher NCS, pyridine, and TBA peak intensities for the TiO2@PEOx photoanode than for the blank-TiO2 photoanode further qualitatively indicate the superior N719 dye loading on the TiO2@PEOx photoanode than on the blank-TiO2 photoanode. The appearance of a N–O bond from N 1s (at 400.94 eV) and O 1s (at 533 eV) XPS peak regions for the TiO2@PEOx photoanode shown in Fig. 2f and S7d† indicate that an ionic bond is successfully formed between N on the PEOx interlayer and O in the carboxylic acid group of the N719 dye.
As indicated in Table S3† and Fig. 2f and estimated from the de-convoluted peak areas of N 1s XPS region, we can quantitatively conclude that the TiO2@PEOx photoanode contains higher NCS (108.58), pyridine (676.44), and TBA (68.88) content than the blank-TiO2 photoanode (19.30, 196.86, and 5.96, respectively), which demonstrates the higher N719 dye loading on the TiO2@PEOx photoanode than on the blank-TiO2. Other de-convoluted peaks from the N 1s, C 1s, and O 1s regions in Fig. 2f, S7c, d and Table S3† show higher peak areas of C–H (4645.82), sp3 CC (977.59), C–O and/or C–N (37.60, 586.88, and 1852.75), CO and/or CN (501.57, 714.93 and 721.76), O–CO (1581.61 and 1090.19), and O–H (537.73) bonds from the TiO2@PEOx photoanode than those from the TiO2 photoanode (3373.21; 582.78; 12.36, 190.43, and 555.55; 73.88, 282.25, and 370.16; 231.74 and 823.04; and 467.17, respectively). These results provide further quantitative confirmation of the higher N719 dye loading achieved on the TiO2@PEOx photoanode compared to the blank TiO2. The transmittance FT-IR spectra in Fig. 2h indicates lower C–N (pyridine), COO–, C–H (TBA), CN (pyridine), NCS (NCS), and O–H FT-IR vibrational transmittance signals for the TiO2@PEOx photoanode than for the blank-TiO2. This also confirms superior N719 dye loading on the surface of the TiO2@PEOx photoanode than on the blank-TiO2 photoanode.
Owing to the inclusion of the PEOx interlayer, the FWHM values of the NCS (1.19 eV), pyridine (1.16 eV), and TBA (1.36 eV) N 1s XPS de-convoluted peaks (Fig. 2f and Table S3†) for the TiO2@PEOx photoanode are smaller than those for the blank-TiO2 photoanode (1.60, 1.70, and 1.56 eV for NCS, pyridine, and TBA peaks, respectively), indicating inferior band bending at the TiO2/N719 dye interface.36,37 This decreased band bending is evidence of the TiO2@PEOx photoanode possessing some beneficial properties, such as fewer electronic defect sites on the TiO2 surface, faster dissociation of the photogenerated exciton (an electron–hole pair), and a swift photogenerated electron injection/extraction kinetic rate at the TiO2/N719 dye interface.
To show the anchoring effect of the PEOx interlayer on dye loading directly and quantitatively, UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption analysis was carried out by preparing and separating N719 dye solutions in ethanol into three different vials, with the same volume (6 ml) and concentration (0.5 mM) in each. As shown in Fig. S9a,† solution 1 is the dye solution without any photoanode immersion, while solution 2 and 3 are the dye solutions after immersion for 24 h with blank-TiO2 and TiO2@PEOx photoanodes, respectively. The UV-vis spectrum of solution 3 shows the lowest absorption, providing qualitative insight about the higher level of N719 dye anchored and incorporated on the surface of the TiO2@PEOx photoanode, compared to the blank-TiO2 one. To quantitatively determine the N719 dye loading amount adsorbed on the photoanode surfaces, several N719 dye solutions, in aqueous NaOH, with different concentrations of 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 mM were first prepared, and their UV-vis spectra are shown in Fig. S9b and c.† Then, the linear equation of y = 11.28333x, shown in Fig. S9d,† was extracted, where y and x are the UV-vis absorbance value at the wavelength of 500 nm and the adsorbed N719 dye loading, respectively. The calculation results from this linear equation, along with the intensity values extracted from Fig. S9e,† show that the N719 dye loading on the TiO2@PEOx photoanode is 22.42 nmol cm−1, which is 40.48% higher than that the N719 dye loading on the blank-TiO2 photoanode, which is 15.96 nmol cm−1 (Fig. S9f†). The aforementioned UV-vis results, which agree with the XPS (Fig. 2e–g, S8c and d), FT-IR (Fig. 2h), and EDS (Fig. S8a and b†) results, clearly reveal the role of PEOx interlayer as the anchoring agent for N719 dye.
To show the effect of the PEOx interlayer on the FDSSC device performance, the photovoltaic properties of FDSSCs are investigated in Fig. 3, S10,† and in Table 1. To balance the steric hindrance of the PEOx material at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, as previously discussed, the concentration of PEOx attached onto the TiO2@PEOx photoanode was varied between 4, 8, 12, and 20 mg ml−1, with the resulting devices denoted as TiO2@PEOx-4, TiO2@PEOx-8, TiO2@PEOx-12, and TiO2@PEOx-20, respectively. Fig. S10† shows the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the blank-TiO2 FDSSC and TiO2@PEOx FDSSCs with varied PEOx concentrations. With PEOx concentrations lower than 8 mg ml−1, including the PEOx interlayer enhances the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC performance, and the enhancement increases with increasing PEOx concentration. The optimum performance was obtained with TiO2@PEOx-8 (of PEOx). The FDSSC performance declines increasingly when the PEOx interlayer is included with concentrations increasing past 8 mg ml−1, possibly due to steric hindrance between PEOx and TiO2. The TiO2 layer cannot tolerate the saturated PEOx concentration, due to a high-level of steric hindrance, which reduces the adsorption of N719 dye on the TiO2@PEOx surface.

The J–V characteristic plots of the FDSSCs in Fig. 3a show that the PCE of the novel FDSSC with the TiO2@PEOx-8 photoanode is 11.22%, which is approximately 32.16% higher than the PCE of 8.49% that is achieved by the traditional FDSSC. In addition, the JSC (17.10 mA cm−2), VOC (0.81 V), and FF (0.81) values of the novel FDSSC simultaneously surpass the JSC (15.75 mA cm−2), VOC (0.71 V), and FF (0.76) values of the traditional device. After the TiO2 photoanode is treated with a methanol solvent, which is used for preparing the PEOx solution (TiO2@MeOH), the FDSSC performance exhibits only marginal enhancement compared to the performance of the traditional FDSSC with a blank-TiO2 photoanode. The PCE histogram in Fig. 3b clearly reveals that statistically, the inclusion of the PEOx interlayer considerably improves the FDSSC performance, achieving a peak efficiency of 11.22%. Thus, the substantially enhanced performance of the novel TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC can be attributed to the PEOx interlayer, implying that the capabilities of the PEOx dipole are as follows: (1) improving the JSC value by boosting photogenerated electron injection/extraction rates via TiO2/N719 dye interface engineering for a larger built-in electric field; and (2) enhancing the VOC and FF by donating the delocalized free electron of PEOx to the TiO2 defect sites to improve the EF level of TiO2 with electrolyte mediator (I−/I−3). The enhanced Vbi at the TiO2/N719 dye interface and the low level of trap-assisted defect sites in TiO2 also reduce the reverse leakage current density, which improves the FF value.

The J–V characteristics under dark conditions (Fig. 3c) show that the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC possesses a higher rectification ratio than the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC. The reverse leakage current density of the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC significantly reduces, whereas its forward output current density improves, which confirms that the PEOx interlayer successfully boosts the charge selectivity at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, owing to both the suppression of interfacial defect sites on the TiO2 surface and the generation of an interfacial dipole moment in the PEOx interlayer. Together, these effects improve the rectification ratio. The blank-TiO2-based FDSSC possesses a lower current density at forward biases compared to the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSCs, indicating that the electrons in the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC became entrapped at the existing defect sites, such as interband electronic trap sites, in TiO2 and recombined with holes. Contrarily, the superior current density of TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC is attributed to the suppression of defect sites, such as electronic trap states in TiO2 when the PEOx interlayer is included. Under reverse biases, the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC exhibits lower current density than the blank-TiO2-based device, even at low reverse bias, demonstrating the larger depletion region and higher built-in electric field, shown as the greater Vbi, at the TiO2/N719 dye interface in TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC than those in blank-TiO2-based devices. As shown in Fig. 3d, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra indicate that the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC has a higher EQE intensity than the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC throughout the visible range, from about 360 to 640 nm. A comparison of Fig. 3a and d indicates that the integrated JSC value extracted from the EQE spectra of the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC (16.78 mA cm−2) is higher than that of the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC (14.85 mA cm−2), and these values are in good agreement with the JSC values obtained from the J–V characteristics (17.10 and 15.75 mA cm−2, respectively). Remarkably, as shown in Fig. 4 and Table S4,† to the best of our knowledge the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC exhibit the highest photoelectric conversion performance among similar FDSSCs described in the literature.6,8,9,30,38–50
 Fig. 4  Comparison of FDSSC performance from TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC with other FDSSCs described in literature. 
Both dye loading and charge collection efficiency are commonly used to determine the J–V and EQE characteristics of DSSCs. To understand the photogenerated charge injection/extraction characteristics at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, the intensity-modulated photocurrent/photovoltage (IMPS/IMVS) (Fig. 5 and Table 2) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) (Fig. 6, Table 3 and S5†) measurements were performed. The IMPS/IMVS measurements provide direct evidence of the effective electron transport time (τt(IMPS)) and electron recombination time (τr(IMVS)) of FDSSCs through the equations of eqn (1) and (2): τt(IMPS) = (2πfmin(IMPS))−1(1) τr(IMVS) = (2πfmin(IMVS))−1(2)where fmin(IMPS) and fmin(IMVS) are the minimum frequency obtained from the lowest impedance of the imaginary part from the IMPS shown in Fig. 5a and b and the IMVS spectra shown in Fig. 5c and d, respectively.6,8,9 As shown in Fig. 5e and Table 2, the decreasing trends of the τt(IMPS) and τr(IMVS) values with increasing forward applied biases, for both the TiO2@PEOx- and blank-TiO2-based FDSSCs, are attributed to the filling of deep trap sites by a higher amount of photogenerated electrons produced inherently at higher voltages. When the applied voltage is varied, the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC shows lower τt(IMPS) values than the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC. In contrast, the τr(IMVS) values of the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC are higher than those of the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC in the entire applied voltage range. In this case, the lower τt(IMPS) and higher τr(IMVS) values obtained for the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC compared to the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC indicate easier transport of photogenerated electrons through the TiO2/N719 dye interface and longer photogenerated electron lifetime, respectively. These superior kinetic properties are attributed to the dipole properties in the PEOx interlayer, which enhance the photogenerated electron injection/extraction at the TiO2/PEOx interface, passivate the trap-assisted recombination sites in TiO2, and improve the dye loading.

(i) Plots of (left panel) Cμvs. applied voltage and (right panel) nμvs. applied voltage. 
The charge collection efficiency (ηC(IMPS–IMVS)) can be calculated using the eqn (3) ηC(IMPS–IMVS) = (1 − (τt(IMPS)/τr(IMVS))) × 100%(3)
The results of the ηC(IMPS–IMVS) clearly show that including the PEOx interlayer in the TiO2@PEOx photoanode considerably enhances the photogenerated charge injection/extraction and transport kinetic rates by both improving the built-in electric field at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, which improves JSC, and reducing the trap-assisted recombination sites on TiO2 by passivating defect sites and accepting the delocalized free electrons of PEOx to enhance electron density on TiO2, which improve VOC and FF.
The EIS data obtained at varied forward applied voltages and under dark conditions are used to confirm the photogenerated electron lifetime, injection/extraction, and transportation behaviours of the TiO2@PEOx- and blank-TiO2-based FDSSCs.6,8,9,51 To extract the important component values from the Nyquist plots relating to the photogenerated electron diffusion and recombination characteristic of TiO2@PEOx- and blank-TiO2-based FDSSCs, a diffusion-recombination model-based equivalent circuit, shown in Fig. 6a, was used in this work.52–54 In the simplified equivalent circuit (Fig. 6b) provided by ZView software, the DX1 element (type 11:Bisquert #2) represents the transmission line model, which relates to the photogenerated electron diffusion and recombination characteristics of both the crystalline and interfacial parts of the TiO2 photoanode layer.52 The equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. 6a consists of the series resistance (RS), the sum of ohmic resistance of two conductive wires (Ti and Pt wires) in the FDSSC; the electron-transfer resistance (RTT) and the interfacial capacitance (CTT) at the Ti wire/TiO2 interface; the charge-transfer resistance (RTi) and the interfacial capacitance (CTi) of the uncovered Ti wire area at the Ti/electrolyte interface; the electron-transfer resistance (RT) for crystalline TiO2; the charge-transfer resistance (RRe) and the chemical capacitance (Cμ) at the TiO2/N719 dye interface; the charge-transfer resistance (RPt) and the interfacial capacitance (CPt) at the Pt/electrolyte interface; and the Warburg impedance associated to the diffusion of I3− in electrolyte (ZN).
The Nyquist plots of blank-TiO2- and TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSCs depicted in Fig. 6c and d consist of four regions: the very-high frequency region associated with RS; the high-frequency semicircle (the first semicircle) region associated with RPT and CPT, RTi and CTi, and RCT and CCT components; the intermediate-frequency semicircle (the second semicircle) region associated with RT, and RRe and Cμ components; and the low frequency arc associated with the ZN component. All these components, summarized in Table 3, can be obtained after simulating the Nyquist plots by using the equivalent circuit depicted in Fig. 6a and b. The TiO2@PEOx- and blank-TiO2-based FDSSCs exhibit marginal differences in several components, such as RS, RTT, CTT, RTi, CTi, CPt, RPt, and ZN, at different applied voltages, implying that the enhanced performance of the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC doesn't originate from the Pt wire counter electrode and Ti wire but from the modified TiO2 photoanode. In contrast, the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC (Fig. 6e) exhibits RRe values of 2854.20, 1300.24, 1075.69, 776.26, and 537.26 Ω cm at forward applied voltages of 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 0.80, and 1.00 V, respectively, which are ∼3.63, 1.71, 1.74, 1.69, 1.23 times higher that of the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC (616.06, 479.92, 392.13, 288.72, and 240.98 Ω cm). This implies that the recombination of photogenerated electrons with oxidized dye molecules and I3− electrolyte acceptors is more difficult in the TiO2@PEOx photoanode than in the blank-TiO2 photoanode. Moreover, the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC shows lower RT values of 127.52, 60.04, 52.10, 38.57, and 27.34 Ω cm, corresponding with increased forward applied voltages, than that of the blank-TiO2-based device, with corresponding values of 202.00, 191.05, 183.47, 175.67, and 157.83 Ω cm, indicating facile movement of photogenerated electrons on the TiO2 crystalline grain of the TiO2@PEOx photoanode, which is attributed to the effect of the intrinsic permanent dipole moment from the PEOx interlayer.

Fig. 6f and g show Bode plots transformed from the Nyquist plots in Fig. 6c and d. The first and second peaks of the Bode plots are associated with the second and first semicircles of Nyquist plots, respectively. After extracting the frequency value at the first peak (fmax(EIS)) of the Bode plots, some other beneficial information about the dynamics of photogenerated electrons on the TiO2 layer, such as electron recombination time (τr(EIS)), electron transport time (τt(EIS)), charge collection efficiency (ηC(EIS)), electron recombination rate (keff), electron diffusion coefficient (Deff), and effective electron diffusion length (Ln) can be obtained using eqn (4)–(9)54 τr(EIS) = (2πfmax(EIS))−1(4) τt(EIS) = (RT/RRe) × τr(EIS)(5) ηC(EIS) = (1 − (τt(EIS)/τr(EIS))) × 100%(6) keff = 2πfmax(EIS)(7) Deff = (RRe/RT) × L2 × keff(8) Ln = (Deff × τr(EIS))1/2(9)where L is the real thickness of TiO2 nanotube layer (∼18 μm). The results of τr(EIS), τt(EIS), and ηC(EIS) are shown in Fig. 6h and Table 3. In agreement with τr(IMVS), τt(IMPS), and ηC(IMPS–IMVS) values obtained from the IMPS/IMVS measurement, the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSCs exhibits a higher τr(EIS) and ηC(EIS) values and a lower τt(EIS) value than the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC at every applied forward voltage. Moreover, the lower keff value and the higher Deff and Ln values of the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSCs, compared to the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC, agree with the higher RRe and the lower RT values from the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC than the blank-TiO2-based FDSSC. The lower keff value from the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC than the blank-TiO2-based one indicates a lower degree of photogenerated electron recombination at the TiO2/N719 dye interface of the TiO2@PEOx photoanode compared to the blank-TiO2 photoanode. Meanwhile, the higher Deff and Ln values from the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC than the blank-TiO2-based one reveal facile photogenerated electron transport at the TiO2@PEOx photoanode, compared to the blank-TiO2 photoanode. The much higher Ln value (∼80 to 85 μm) of the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC than that (∼18 μm) of the blank-TiO2 one is further evidence of the low recombination kinetics and facile transportation of photogenerated electrons in the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC. A low recombination rate and facile transportation of photogenerated electrons in the TiO2@PEOx photoanode further emphasizes the key roles of the intrinsic permanent dipole moment of the PEOx interlayer in enhancing the photogenerated injection/extraction kinetic rates at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, in addition to the delocalized electrons with electronic doping-like behaviour on the electron withdrawal portion of the PEOx.
The Cμ component produced by an accumulation of electrons in the TiO2 region describes an electron density change at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, and can be used to represent the total density of free electrons and localized electrons (entrapped-electrons) in the CB and electronic trap-states of TiO2. A higher Cμ value indicates a higher entrapped electron density and a higher presence of interband trap sites in the TiO2 layer.55Fig. 6i shows plots of Cμ and nμ against applied voltage. The nμ value can be extracted from Cμ using eqn (10)56 (10)where Cμ, e, kB, T, and nμ are the chemical capacitance at the TiO2/N719 dye interface, electron charge, Boltzmann's constant, room temperature (300 K), and the total density of both free electrons in the TiO2 conduction band and localized electrons in the trap states, respectively. As shown in Fig. 6i, the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC exhibits lower Cμ and nμ values under the forward biases tested than the blank-TiO2-based device. Compared with the blank-TiO2 photoanode, Fig. 6i demonstrates that the TiO2@PEOx photoanode possesses a lower density of entrapped electrons on TiO2, indicating that there are fewer electronic trap states because of the defect site suppression provided by the PEOx interlayer at the TiO2/N719 interface in the TiO2@PEOx-based FDSSC.
Conclusions
In this study, to enhance the dye adsorption capability and charge injection/extraction kinetics of an FDSSC, we employed a polar PEOx material as a bifunctional interlayer in the TiO2 photoanodes in FDSSCs. Consequently, we obtained a high-performance FDSSC with a peak PCE of 11.22%, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the highest value obtained for pure Pt-based FDSSCs. The considerably enhanced performance of the FDSSC is attributed to the bifunctional features of the PEOx interlayer. First, the intrinsic dipole moment in the PEOx chain increases the photogenerated charge injection/extraction kinetic rates at the TiO2/N719 dye interface. In addition, the delocalized free electrons in the PEOx chain provide doping-like characteristics to suppress the TiO2 defect sites and trap-assisted charge recombination. Moreover, the positive polarity of the iminium group in the PEOx chain provides additional anchoring sites for the N719 dye, to improve the dye loading on the TiO2 surface. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of the iminium backbone in PEOx prevents TiO2 from coming in contact with water-based moisture. Therefore, the charge collection efficiency, short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and fill factor of FDSSCs with PEOx-modified TiO2 photoanodes are superior to those of traditional FDSSCs with unmodified TiO2 photoanodes, by approximately 16.94%, 8.57%, 14.08%, and 6.58%, respectively, leading to an impressive PCE improvement of approximately 32.16%.
Methods and materials
Materials and solutions
Ti wire (diameter: 250 μm, purity: 99.7%, Alfa Aesar), Pt wire (diameter: 100 μm, purity: 99.7% of purity, Alfa Aesar), ethylene glycol (CH2OH, Sigma Aldrich), ammonium fluoride (NH4F, Sigma Aldrich), N719 dye (C58H86N8O8RuS2, Sigma Aldrich), lithium iodide (LiI, Sigma Aldrich), iodine (I2, Sigma Aldrich), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Sigma Aldrich), 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide (BMII, Sigma Aldrich), guanidium thiocyanate (GuSCN, Sigma Aldrich), anhydrous acetonitrile (Sigma Aldrich), and poly(2-ethyl-2oxazoline) (PEOx, [–N(COC2H5)CH2CH2–]n, molecular weight: 50 kDa, Sigma Aldrich) were used as received without any further purification and/or modification. The electrolyte solution was anhydrous acetonitrile containing 0.1 M LiI, 0.05 M I2, 0.5 M TBP, 0.6 M BMII, and 0.1 M GuSCN. The dye solution contained 0.5 mM N719 dye precursor in anhydrous ethanol. The PEOx precursor was diluted in methanol to prepare 8 mg ml−1 PEOx solution.
Preparation of TiO2@PEOx and blank-TiO2 photoanode
Fig. S2† shows the schematic illustration of the TiO2 nanotube (NT) photoanode preparation. The TiO2 photoanode was prepared using a 5 cm-long Ti wire by carrying out an electrochemical anodic oxidation (anodizing) process at ∼27 °C for 6 h with a DC anodizing voltage of 60 V. An ethylene glycol solution containing deionized water (DI-H2O, 2 vol%) and NH4F (0.25 wt%) was used as the anodizing electrolyte. The anodized Ti wire was then sintered at 450 °C for 1 h in air to transform the TiO2 phase from amorphous to anatase crystalline. For the TiO2@PEOx photoanode, after cooling to ∼27 °C, the resulting TiO2 photoanode wire was soaked in PEOx solution for 1 h at ∼27 °C. Subsequently, the obtained TiO2@PEOx wire photoanode was soaked in the N-719 dye solution for 24 h at room temperature. Lastly, the dye-sensitized TiO2@PEOx wire photoanode was rinsed with anhydrous ethanol. For the preparation of the blank-TiO2 photoanode, the PEOx treatment step was absent.
FDSSC device fabrication
The FDSSCs were fabricated according to a previous method, shown in Fig. S1.† The Pt wire, which served as the counter electrode, was twisted with the as-prepared photoanode wire. The electrolyte solution was filled inside a transparent, flexible plastic tube. Subsequently, the previously twisted electrode was inserted into the electrolyte-filled tube (i.e., a mixed solution of 0.6 mol L−1 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.01 mol L−1 I2, 0.50 mol L−1 LiI, 0.50 mol L−1 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 0.10 mol L−1 guanidinium thiocyanate in 3-methoxypropionitrile) and finally sealed with wax.

Current density–voltage (J–V) curves were obtained using a calibrated solar simulator at 1 sun (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and ∼27 °C, under a scanning rate of 30 mV s−1. A mono-silicon detector was used to calibrate the solar simulator. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed using a multichannel potentiostat analyser (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, VMP3 type). The EIS measurements were performed at an amplitude perturbation signal of 0.10 mV and a frequency ranging from 106 to 10−1 Hz. IMPS/IMVS measurements were performed using an IMPS/IMVS machine under the illumination condition of a green LED (λ = 500 nm). The photogenerated electron transport time (τET) and photogenerated electron recombination time (τER) were calculated by using the equation τET,ER = 1/2πfmin, where fmin is the minimum frequency of the imaginary part of the IMPS/IMVS spectra.
Samples characterization
SEM measurements were performed using a Nova 200 NanoLab at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV (FEI). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed using a Teneo Volume Scope (VS). Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were performed using an AXIS-NOVA (Kratos) system at a base pressure of 5 × 10−8 Torr with HeIα radiation (hv = 21.22 eV) at a pass energy resolution of 0.585 eV. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using a PHI 5000 VersaProbe (UlVAC-PHI) system equipped with a monochromatized Al Kα radiation (hν = 1486.6 eV) source operated at a constant voltage of 15 kV. MultiPak and XPSPEAK software programs (UlVAC-PHI) were used for the XPS data processing. The full-range XPS spectra were obtained at a wide scan-pass energy of 117.4 eV. The peak subtraction for the XPS core-level peak analysis was performed using a Shirley-type background. Gauss function fitting was used to obtain the peak de-convolution of the XPS spectra. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) measurements were performed by using a Nicolet Almega XR system (Thermo Scientific). UV-vis spectra were obtained using an S-3100 (Scinco) UV-visible (UV-vis) spectrometer.
