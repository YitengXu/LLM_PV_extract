The average efficiency of the planar device is 15.37% with a minimal standard deviation of ±0.37% and the best efficiency as high as 16.03%. Moreover, the device shows very good stability over 62 days with very little degradation <9% when stored under ambient conditions.
Hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite semiconducting materials, pioneered by Mitzi et al. for field-effect transistor applications,1 have attracted a great deal of research because of their excellent optical absorption, long range charge-carrier diffusion and apparent tolerance of defects.2–4 In just a few years, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the perovskite solar cells has been improved from 3.8% to 20%.5–14 Furthermore, the development based on the planar architecture has been particularly enthusiastic, thanks to its low temperature fabrication and compatibility with a range of substrates.10,11,15–18 However, problems associated with incomplete and inhomogeneous coverage of the perovskite films have emerged as two major adversary factors for device performance.19,20 There have been extensive research studies focusing on improving the morphology of the perovskite films by adjusting the precursor solution concentration,8 optimizing the annealing temperature and time,20,21 modifying interface layers10,22–26 and developing new methods for perovskite film deposition, e.g. solution deposition,10,13 vacuum deposition11,19,27–29etc. Among these methods, vacuum processes for thermal co-deposition and sequential deposition of PbCl2 and CH3NH3I materials are recognized as efficient means to prepare perovskite films with good uniformity and high surface coverage. So far the champion PCE for devices based on vacuum deposition technologies has exceeded 15%.11,19,28 However, there are only limited successful reports using the vacuum deposition techniques likely originating from the following challenges: (i) due to its low vapor pressure and small density, CH3NH3I readily diffuses inside the vacuum chamber, making it very difficult to monitor/control the CH3NH3I deposition rate and therefore the CH3NH3I/PbCl2 ratio; (ii) the uniformity of the solar cells is very poor. More specifically, even though the perovskite solar cell with CH3NH3PbI3−xClx as the absorption layer showed a champion PCE as high as 15% by vacuum deposition, the average PCE for the deposition was only 12% with a large standard deviation (s. d.) of ±2%.11
Herein, we report our success in achieving uniform layer-by-layer vacuum deposition by alternating PbCl2 and CH3NH3I precursor layers. The new deposition process allows us to relax the strict deposition monitoring and control measures, while realizing superior uniformity in film morphology, surface coverage and smoothness, together with crystalline phase purity. Using the technique, we have obtained a solar cell efficiency as high as 16.03%, the highest value in the CH3NH3PbI3−xClx devices so far. More importantly, the average PCE is 15.37% with a very small s. d. of ±0.37%, indicating the excellent reproducibility and uniformity. Meanwhile, solar cells with a large active area of 1 cm2 were fabricated and the PCE measured was up to 13.87%. In addition, the devices showed superior stability with minimum PCE degradation after the device was stored under ambient conditions for 62 days.
For a planar perovskite solar cell, the following perovskite film characteristics have critical influence on the device performance: surface coverage, roughness, uniformity and thickness. In order to investigate the thickness effect of the PbCl2 layer, four samples with a PbCl2 film thickness of 50 nm, 100 nm, 125 nm and 150 nm were prepared. For this test, a sufficient amount of CH3NH3I was ensured and the excess portion was removed by post-annealing rinsing in isopropanol. Fig. 1 displays surface scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the perovskite films grown on different thicknesses of PbCl2 on compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2) by sequential vacuum deposition and then annealing at 120 °C for 2 hours. It is clear that a uniform and full coverage perovskite film is achieved when the PbCl2 thickness is smaller than 100 nm (Fig. 1a and b and e and f). However, when the PbCl2 thickness exceeds 100 nm (Fig. 1c and d and g and h), voids appear in the perovskite films, and both the number density and size of the voids increase with the PbCl2 thickness. The dark grains within the voids are determined to be the unreacted PbCl2, and the point is supported by the morphology of dark grains, which resembles that of the PbCl2 film shown in Fig. S1.† Also, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns shown in Fig. S2† clearly reveal that when the thickness of PbCl2 films exceeds 100 nm, the PbCl2 phase30 coexists with the perovskite15,31 in the films, while the superfluous PbCl2 phase disappears when the thickness of PbCl2 films decreases to 100 nm and below. The relatively light grains with larger grain size and different morphologies observed are attributed to the perovskite formed, as confirmed by the XRD pattern, wherein four diffraction signals are observed at 14.15°, 28.48°, 31.92° and 43.24°, corresponding to the (110), (220), (310) and (330) peaks of perovskite crystals, respectively (Fig. S2†).15,31 The cross-sectional SEM image in Fig. S3† shows that the thickness of the perovskite film is about 204 nm based on 100 nm PbCl2, due to the volume expansion from the intercalation of CH3NH3I into the PbCl2 framework.32

The high resolution SEM images of perovskite films on different thicknesses of PbCl2: (e) 50 nm, (f) 100 nm, (g) 125 nm, and (h) 150 nm; the scan bar is 500 nm. 
Accordingly the perovskite solar cells based on the four different thicknesses of PbCl2 were fabricated, and the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of solar cells under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mA cm−2 are shown in Fig. S4.† The parameters of devices including short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and PCE are summarized in Table S1.† It shows that the devices based on thicker (125 or 150 nm) PbCl2 layers exhibit lower photovoltaic performance than that based on the 100 nm PbCl2 layer. Clearly, the visible amount of unreacted PbCl2 needs to be avoided. It can be further concluded that the reaction penetration depth is no more than 100 nm by the sequential vacuum deposition. Unfortunately, the PCE of the device based on the 100 nm thick PbCl2 layer is still very low as the thickness is not sufficient for effective light absorption, as witnessed by weak absorbance (Fig. S5†) and the lower shunt resistances (Rsh) (Table S1†) compared to the values reported in ref. 33 and 34. It is known from the literature that the thickness of the perovskite film needs to be ∼300 nm to warrant adequate light absorption for a good device.30,35 Therefore, the quest for new vacuum deposition processes to attain a thick enough perovskite film is of crucial importance in fabricating perovskite solar cells with high performance.

Scheme 1 illustrates the present fabrication process for the perovskite solar cells via an intercalation reaction. First of all, the PbCl2 powder was evaporated onto a glass/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO2 substrate in a vacuum chamber. The surface morphology of the PbCl2 film was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and SEM. As shown in Fig. S1,† the PbCl2 film, consisting of mainly nanoparticles with a diameter of ca. 150 nm, is demonstrated with full coverage and a small root mean surface (RMS) of 13.4 nm. The CH3NH3I powder was then thermally sublimed onto the surface of the PbCl2 film. As the excess amount of CH3NH3I is evaporated during the later intercalation reaction process, we control the CH3NH3I film thickness by quartz microbalance sensors to ensure that a sufficient amount is available to consume all PbCl2 deposited. The color of the sample changed from transparent to taupe (Fig. S6†), indicating that the perovskite was produced even at the interface even at low deposition temperature.21 XRD (Fig. S7†) demonstrates that the PbCl2 phase coexists with the perovskite in the films before annealing. The above two steps are then repeated until sufficient thickness is generated. The glass/FTO/TiO2/(PbCl2/CH3NH3I)n sample was then annealed at 120 °C in a glove box for 2 hours. After the annealing, the color of the sample changed from taupe to dark (Fig. S6†), indicating that the perovskite film formed via the intercalation reaction between PbCl2 and CH3NH3I. After cooling down to room temperature, the as-prepared perovskite film was washed with isopropanol to remove the excess amount of CH3NH3I. Eventually, 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and gold were successively deposited on the perovskite film as a hole transport material (HTM) and electrode, respectively. The details of the fabrication process are expounded in the experimental section in the ESI.†

Fig. 2a shows the XRD pattern of the as-prepared perovskite film on the glass/FTO/TiO2 substrate. Four diffraction peaks, centered at 14.15°, 28.48°, 31.92° and 43.24°, are assigned to (110), (220), (310) and (330) diffractions, respectively.15,31 The sample exhibits strong absorption in the entire visible region with an absorbance as high as 0.67–5, as shown in the UV-vis spectra in Fig. S5.† Besides, the quality of the perovskite film synthesized via the present alternating deposition is further studied using AFM and SEM. Fig. 2b shows a typical AFM image of the perovskite film. In a range of 10 μm × 10 μm, the sample appears to be very smooth with RMS = 26.8 nm, much lower than that from solution processed films (RMS = 52.7 nm).36 A smooth perovskite thin film is attributed to the smooth starting PbCl2 layer. Fig. 2c presents a SEM image of the perovskite film. It is clear that the film is composed of large grains with desired film morphology, full surface coverage and thickness uniformity. The cross-sectional SEM image of the film is shown in Fig. 2d. Even though the film is as thick as >400 nm, the crystal grains traversed across the entire absorption layer thickness, demonstrating the complete intercalation reaction between the PbCl2 and the CH3NH3I layers.

Fig. 3a shows that the number of alternate deposition cycles has a significant effect on the photovoltaic performance of the planar perovskite solar cells. The thickness of the perovskite film increases from 204 nm to 672 nm when the number of alternating deposition cycles is increased from 1 to 3, as shown in Fig. S8.† As mentioned above, the perovskite film after only 1 cycle is too thin to achieve necessary light absorption (Fig. S5†), resulting in poor device performance. The values of Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE of the devices versus the number of deposition cycles are summarized in Table 1. It is obvious that the Jsc is increased from 14.58 mA cm−2 to 21.38 mA cm−2 when the deposition is increased from 1 to 2 cycles. Both the Voc and FF are dramatically increased after 2 cycles, so does the Rsh, from 3.02 kΩ cm2 to 20.67 kΩ cm2, indicating that shunt paths are removed. The combination of the above improvements leads to the high PCE. However, the photovoltaic performance deteriorates after 3 cycles, as expected the excessive thickness of the perovskite layer would cause charge recombination,37 leading to decreased Jsc and FF. Meanwhile, Voc is found to suffer as the Rsh is reduced to below 1.45 kΩ cm2. Fig. 3b shows the incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of the perovskite solar cells using different numbers of deposition cycles. The Jsc calculated from the IPCE is 14.23, 20.22 and 15.36 mA cm−2 for the devices based on 1, 2 and 3 cycles, respectively, in excellent agreement with the J–V measurements.

Fig. 3c shows the J–V curves of the planar perovskite solar cell with the highest efficiency, with key parameters including Jsc, Voc, FF and PCE summarized in Table 1. The champion device exhibits Jsc = 22.27 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.00 V and FF = 0.72, and PCE = Jsc × Voc × FF = 16.03%. To our knowledge, this is the highest efficiency reported among planar CH3NH3PbI3−xClx solar cells fabricated using vacuum deposition to date. Fig. 3d gives the IPCE of the perovskite solar cell. The Jsc value calculated using the IPCE and AM1.5G spectrum is 21.19 mA cm−2, in excellent agreement with the J–V measurement.
To further confirm the good reproducibility using the alternating deposition technique, 15 individual devices from three different batch runs were fabricated and their J–V characteristics were analyzed. The PCE histogram distribution diagram and J–V curves are shown in Fig. S9.† It is clear that the PCE is highly reproducible with little variation, and the statistics is listed in Table 1. In summary, the average PCE is 15.37% ± 0.37% with a Jsc of 21.88 ± 0.29 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.98 ± 0.02 V and FF of 0.69 ± 0.03. All key parameters show very small deviation and the average PCE is very close to the highest PCE of 16.03%.
Meanwhile, planar perovskite solar cells with different active areas were fabricated, and the snapshots of the devices are exhibited in Fig. S10.†Fig. 3e shows their J–V curves, and the key parameters are summarized in Table 2. With the active area increasing from 0.1 to 1 cm2, the Jsc decreases by only 2%, and the Voc and FF show negligible reduction. Fig. 3f displays IPCE curves of devices with different dimensions. It shows that the IPCE value drops slightly with the increased active area. The device with a large active area of 1 cm2 exhibits a high PCE of 13.84%, thanks to the uniformity and quality achieved by the alternating layer-by-layer vacuum deposition technique.

In addition, the device fabricated by the current technique shows superior stability. Using a bare device without any encapsulation, we measured J–V on a daily basis for 62 days as the cell was kept under ambient conditions. The J–V data show very good stability. Specifically, the PCE value remained at 91% of its initial efficiency after 62 days, as shown in Fig. 4. The parameters are listed in Table S2.† We attribute the remarkable stability to the controlled vacuum environment for the perovskite fabrication and the purity of the resultant material, the former allows dense perovskite films with full surface coverage that prevents moisture penetration, the latter warrants the deposited film free of residual solvent and other contamination.

Conclusions
We have developed an effective technique to fabricate perovskite solar cells using alternating layer-by-layer vacuum deposition of the PbCl2 and CH3NH3I precursor layers. Compared with other vacuum deposition technologies, the present method has four main advantages: (1) it relaxes complicated operations to monitor/control deposition rates and thin film composition; (2) it provides high quality perovskite films with full surface coverage, smaller roughness, and more uniform morphology, along with crystalline phases of higher purity; (3) its controlled deposition environment makes the fabrication of dense and pure perovskite materials possible that in turn leads to better moisture protection, resulting in excellent device stability; (4) it offers very high solar cell efficiency with minimum performance variation. The champion PCE of the devices using the present development reaches 16.03%. Meanwhile, the PCE of the large active area (1 cm2) device is as high as 13.87%. The new technology provides a convenient yet efficient method to fabricate large area perovskite solar cells. It is promising for potential application in manufacturing large area perovskite solar cells.
