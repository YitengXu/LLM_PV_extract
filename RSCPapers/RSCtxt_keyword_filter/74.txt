    , Accepted 27th March 2013First published on 27th March 2013AbstractA highly efficient and stable inverted organic photovoltaic cell has been demonstrated by incorporating a zinc oxide (ZnO)/conjugated polyelectrolyte (CPE) stacked structure as an electron-transporting layer. The CPE not only improved the electron collection efficiency in inverted devices but also smoothened the ZnO surfaces, thereby reducing the leakage current and improving the device reliability. In this work, two CPEs, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) and poly[3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] (PTMAHT), are used, and three different interlayers, ZnO, ZnO/PFN, and ZnO/PTMAHT, are systematically studied. By coating PFN onto the ZnO surface, a high power conversion efficiency of 8.54% (with a fill factor of 73%) and ∼17% efficiency improvement are achieved in thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene copolymer, PTB7, and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester bulk heterojunction solar cells, along with excellent stability.
Introduction
The organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have attracted broad research attention because organic semiconductors have many advantages compared to conventional inorganic materials, including mechanical flexibility, lightness, and ease of large-area fabrication.1–3 Recently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 10% has been demonstrated in OPVs.4 These results also indicate the significant future potential of organic solar energy cells. Considering various breakthroughs during the development of OPVs, it is noted that improvements that result in high performance always rely on both material innovation and state-of-the-art device architecture. Among these breakthroughs, interface modification is commonly used to simultaneously improve the device efficiency and stability.5
According to our knowledge, OPV devices fabricated with a regular architecture have limited air stability; further, rapid oxidation of the low-work-function cathodes in OPV cells is observed,6 and indium tin oxide (ITO) is gradually etched by the acidic poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) charge-transport layer.7 As a result, the device performance strongly degrades, leading to poor lifetimes.8 Accordingly, to improve the stability of OPVs, an inverted architecture has been designed, where the positions of the cathode and the anode are reversed and the low-work-function electrode is replaced by an air-stable electron-transporting and hole-blocking interlayer, such as zinc oxide (ZnO).9–12 ZnO has been widely used as the interlayer in the fabrication of inverted OPV cells because it is a safe, environmentally stable, and cheap material. Moreover, ZnO can be prepared by various synthesis routes and converted into different morphologies.13–15 Careful adjustment of the interface characteristics between different materials may further improve the PCE. Recently, inverted OPVs with a high PCE of 7.3% and a fill factor (FF) of 69% were demonstrated in a device that incorporated a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer composed of thieno[3,4-b]-thiophene/benzodithiophene copolymer (PTB7) (Fig. 1a) and [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC70BM) on a ZnO interlayer.9 The PCE of the thus-prepared inverted devices is comparable to that of regular devices reported in the literature;16 further, the device stability in air is improved. Moreover, Small et al. demonstrated an inverted polydithienogermole–thienopyrrolodione:PC70BM solar cell using an ultraviolet-ozone-treated ZnO–poly(vinyl pyrrolisone) composite sol–gel film as the interlayer.17 The thus-prepared device showed a PCE of as high as 8.5% with a FF of 67%.

By incorporating a cross-linked fullerene-based electron-transporting interlayer, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric styryl dendron ester, the interface characteristics of ZnO in the inverted architecture can be further modulated. The thus-prepared device based on poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT):indene-C60 bis-adduct BHJ exhibited an improved photocurrent and FF, yielding a high PCE of 6.2%.18 Recently, conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) have emerged as a novel class of electron-transporting interlayers. The CPE layer is believed to form dipoles at the organic–metal interface and facilitate efficient electron transport.19–27 He et al. incorporated a CPE, poly[(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino)propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene)] (PFN), as the interlayer into inverted PTB7:PC70BM devices. Significant improvement of the photovoltaic performance was achieved, resulting in the highest PCE of 9.2%.28 Using a combination of CPE and a metal oxide is an alternative approach. Yang et al. demonstrated a CPE and ZnO layered structure as the interlayer in an inverted OPV and achieved an obvious efficiency improvement.27 However, reports including both subjects, stability discussion and high-efficiency device fabrication, are still rare. In this work, detailed investigations are performed to reveal the outstanding effects of CPE interlayers in inverted OPVs. Two CPEs, PFN and poly[3-(6-trimethylammoniumhexyl)thiophene] (PTMAHT),29–31 are used (Fig. 1a), and three different interlayers, ZnO, ZnO/PFN, and ZnO/PTMAHT, are systematically studied. The detailed energy level alignment of each layer of the device is shown in Fig. 1b. In our experiments, the PCEs of these three interlayers in inverted PTB7:PC70BM cells are 7.28% (ZnO), 7.64% (ZnO/PTMAHT), and 8.01% (ZnO/PFN), and excellent air stability is observed. After optimization of the BHJ layer, the device performance is further improved. Using the stacked ZnO/PFN interlayer in inverted devices, we demonstrate a high efficiency of 8.54% with an FF of 73% in this study.
Results and discussion
PTMAHT and PFN have been previously used as electron-transporting interlayers in regular device architectures, as reported in the literature.25–27,29–31 Both PTMAHT and PFN are alcohol-soluble and “orthogonal-solvent”-insoluble materials, and hence, they can be easily coated onto the hydrophilic ZnO surface from a methanol solution during the fabrication of the inverted device. Further, these layers will not be damaged by the subsequent active layer solution. Contact angle measurements showed that the ZnO surface was covered by a thin CPE film, resulting in a corresponding change in the contact angle (Fig. S1†).
In the film state, PTMAHT and PFN show different absorption spectra, with the maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) at 447 nm and 405 nm, respectively (Fig. S2†). Fig. 1c compares the UV-visible transmittance spectra of ZnO-coated ITO-glass substrate (glass/ITO/ZnO) and CPE-coated ZnO/ITO-glass (glass/ITO/ZnO/PTMAHT and glass/ITO/ZnO/PFN). Both glass/ITO/ZnO/PTMAHT and glass/ITO/ZnO/PFN were highly transparent, and the transmittance was similar to that of glass/ITO/ZnO. There was no obvious transmittance loss in the visible-light region. Slightly enhanced absorption in the blue-light region (∼400 nm wavelength) was observed in the case of PFN. This result indicated that the light absorption efficiency of the BHJ layer, when used as part of the stacked ZnO/CPE interlayer, could be retained, although it did not actually affect the optical properties of the devices.
To test the performance of stacked ZnO/CPE as an electron-transporting layer in inverted cells, PTB7:PC70BM devices (ITO/interlayer/PTB7:PC70BM/MoO3/Ag) based on different interlayers (ZnO-only, ZnO/PTMAHT, and ZnO/PFN) were fabricated. Fig. 2a shows the current density (J) vs. voltage (V) curves of the devices measured under AM 1.5G solar irradiation at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Table 1 summarizes the device performance. In the ZnO-only control device, a typical open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.74 V, a short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.8 mA cm−2, and an FF of 66.5% could be achieved, giving a PCE of 7.28%, which was similar to that of PTB7:PC70BM-based solar cells reported in the literature.9,16 When PTMAHT was added to ZnO to obtain a PTMAHT/ZnO interlayer, the device exhibited improved performance with Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE of 0.74 V, 15.3 mA cm−2, 67.5%, and 7.64%, respectively. Then, when PTMAHT was replaced by PFN, a higher PCE of 8.01% could be achieved, with a Voc of 0.75 V, Jsc of 15.5 mA cm−2, and FF of 68.9%. These results showed the superior interface properties of the ZnO/CPE stacked interlayer. The improved electron collection capability of the CPE at the interface between the ZnO and the BHJ layer results in high device efficiency.

To further scrutinize the electrical characteristics of the stacked ZnO/CPE interlayer in inverted devices, the dark J–V characteristics were measured (Fig. 2c). As shown in Table 1, the ZnO/PTMAHT and ZnO/PFN devices exhibited excellent diode characteristics with a lower leakage current and a higher rectification ratio than those for the device based on a ZnO-only interlayer, although no difference in the series resistance (Rs) was observed. To identify the origin of the leakage current, the surface morphologies of the CPE-coated ZnO were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), as shown in Fig. 3. The image of the ZnO surface (Fig. 3a) revealed a typical flat morphology with no evident rugged structure, corresponding to a uniformly smooth surface with a root-mean-square roughness (RRMS) of 2.37 nm. By coating PFN onto ZnO, the RRMS value could be reduced to 1.95 nm because of the planarization of PFN (Fig. 3b). By replacing PFN by PTMAHT, as shown in Fig. 3c, the RRMS value could be further decreased to 1.10 nm. Such a flat surface is helpful in suppressing the leakage current in diodes. This result can be used to explain why the PTMAHT-coated ZnO device shows a higher rectification ratio (9.98 × 104 at ±1.5 V) than the PFN-coated ZnO device (6.73 × 103 at ±1.5 V) and the ZnO-only device (1.82 × 103 at ±1.5 V). This observation indicates that CPE acts not only as an effective electron-transporting layer but also as an excellent surface-smoothening material for ZnO planarization. The function is similar to that of PEDOT:PSS smoothening ITO surfaces and reducing leakage currents. Such a “buffer layer” can be used to improve the device reliability.

Apart from device efficiency improvement, excellent device stability was also observed when using the stacked ZnO/CPE as an interlayer. Fig. 4 compares the air stability of devices with different architectures and interlayers. Devices without encapsulation were placed in air (humidity: ∼70%; temperature: ∼27 °C) in the dark for various times before measurements were taken. For the device fabricated with the regular architecture (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PTB7:PC70BM/PFN/Ca/Al),26,27 a high device performance could be achieved. However, such a conventional device showed serious degradation in air because of the high reactivity of Ca with oxygen and moisture. The PCE decreased to ∼30% after 2 days of exposure to air. In contrast, all inverted devices (using stacked ZnO/PTMAHT, ZnO/PFN, or ZnO-only as the interlayer) showed significantly better stability. Voc remained almost unchanged during the air exposure test. The degradation mainly affected Jsc and FF, while the PCE remained at about 70% of its initial value after 26 days of exposure to air, thus indicating the superior air stability. However, although CPEs are good planarization materials for highly reliable devices, water-soluble CPEs may be sensitive to moisture, which will result in faster degradation than that in the case of CPE-free devices. For example, the device using a stacked ZnO/PTMAHT interlayer showed ∼25% degradation in PCE after exposure to ambient air for 6 days; this degradation was faster than that for ZnO/PFN and ZnO-only devices. This result could be attributed to the water solubility of PTMAHT. As mentioned above, PFN is an alcohol-soluble material which cannot be dissolved in water because of its alternating cationic and hydrophobic octane side chains. Contact angle measurements showed that the surface energy of the ZnO layer was changed by the PFN coating, resulting in a change in the water contact angle from 61° (ZnO-only) to 114° (ZnO/PFN), as shown in Fig. S1.† This indicated that PFN will not be easily destroyed by moisture, thus leading to better stability in air. In contrast, PTMAHT is not only alcohol-soluble but also water-soluble. The water contact angle of the ZnO/PTMAHT layer changed to <10°. This implied that the PTMAHT thin film was fully destroyed by water. Consequently, the device stability would be strongly affected by moisture when using PTMAHT as the interlayer. Subsequently, we encapsulated the ZnO/PFN device with a UV-curable epoxy and a glass cover sheet and stored it in air. As seen in Fig. S3,† the encapsulated device showed a significantly more stable performance. All the photovoltaic parameters (Voc, Jsc, FF, and PCE) remained almost unchanged after 88 days of storage in the dark (in air ambient), and even slightly higher than their original values,32,33 indicating that the inverted device shows excellent stability. Film quality is another key parameter in determining the device performance.34,35 In order to avoid pinhole formation, we carefully controlled the PTB7:PC70BM film thickness and pre-dried the samples in a nitrogen atmosphere for 30 min (in a glove box), followed by evacuation to a pressure of 10−2 Torr for another 30 min to remove the residual solvent and the processing additive (1,8-diiodooctane, DIO), before molybdenum oxide (MoO3) and silver electrode deposition. The thus-prepared device with a stacked ZnO/PFN interlayer gave an improved Voc of 0.74 V, Jsc of 15.8 mA cm−2, FF of 73.0%, and PCE of 8.54% (the corresponding illuminated and dark J–V curves are shown in Fig. S4†). This efficiency was consistent with the record performance of PTB7:PC70BM devices demonstrated in a recent publication.27

Conclusions
In this work, we have demonstrated a highly efficient and stable inverted OPV device by incorporating a ZnO/CPE stacked structure as the electron-transporting layer. The CPE not only improved the electron collection efficiency of the inverted devices but also smoothened the ZnO surfaces, thereby reducing the leakage current and improving the device reliability. PCE values of above 8.54% and a ∼17% efficiency improvement could be achieved when using the stacked ZnO/CPE as the interlayer for PTB7:PC70BM-based devices. Moreover, the thus-prepared inverted devices showed superior air stability. Thus, our study represents an alternative approach for developing high-performance polymer solar cells.
Experimental
Fabrication of photovoltaic devices
The PTMAHT was synthesized by modifying the previously reported procedures.31 PTB7 and PFN were purchased from 1-Material Inc. PC70BM was purchased from Nano-C. The devices were fabricated by spin-coating the precursor solution (consisting of 0.4 M zinc acetate dehydrate and 0.4 M ethanolamine in 2-methoxyethanol) on top of the pre-cleaned ITO glass (15 Ω □−1), and then heated at 150 °C for 20 min in air. Subsequently, CPE (PTMAHT or PFN) was spin-coated onto the sol–gel derived ZnO film from its methanol solution (2 mg mL−1) at 5000 rpm for 30 s, and baked at 120 °C for 5 min in air, to form a ∼7 nm-thick film. Then, the samples were transferred into a nitrogen-filled glove box, and PTB7 (10 mg mL−1) and PC70BM (15 mg mL−1) were dissolved in 1 mL of chlorobenzene with 3% DIO. The PTB7:PC70BM blend was spin coated on top of the CPE layer at 1100 rpm for 60 s to form a BHJ layer. Subsequently, the samples were dried at room temperature in a glove box for 30 min and then pre-vacuumed at a pressure of approximately 10−2 Torr for another 30 min before being transferred into an evaporator. Finally, a 10 nm-thick MoO3 and 100 nm-thick Ag electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation at a pressure of approximately 10−6 Torr. The active area of the device defined by the shadow mask was 10 mm2.
Characterization

J–V characteristics of photovoltaic devices were taken using a Keithley 2400 source measurement unit under a simulated AM1.5G spectrum with a 150 W solar simulator (SAN-EI XES-40S1), and the 100 mW cm−2 light intensity was calibrated using a Si-based reference cell with a KG5 filter.36 The mismatch factor was not considered here. Absorption and transmittance spectra were taken using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. The surface morphology of the films was observed by AFM using a Bruker DI D3100. The image was captured in the tapping mode, and the surface roughness of the films was revealed. The film thickness of each layer was determined by a Dektak 6M profilometer and cross-sectional SEM technique (Hitachi 4800). The SEM samples were covered by a sputtered platinum film to increase the conductivity of the sample surface for SEM measurements.
