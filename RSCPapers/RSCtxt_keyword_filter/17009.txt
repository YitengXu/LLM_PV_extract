    , Accepted 7th August 2018First published on 7th August 2018AbstractRuthenium metal complexes consisting of various functionalized carbene-pyridyl anchoring ligands were synthesized, characterized, and tested for their power conversion capabilities. Carboxylate (DC101), hydroxamate (DC107), and acyl azide (DC108) groups were explored as anchors to identify a suitable and efficient binding functionality for the unique characteristic carbene-pyridyl ligand. The hydroxamate anchoring group was shown to be the most efficient anchoring group for the carbene-pyridyl ligand and the device based on dye DC107 exhibited the best efficiency (η) of 4.97% compared to those of the other prepared sensitizers. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies on the devices based on these dyes justified their performances. This is the first case of an investigation utilizing σ electron donating carbene-pyridine as the anchoring ligand and it was found to be more suitable for use as an ancillary group.
Introduction
The potential of solar energy can be comprehended by the statement “the power of sunlight that strikes the Earth in an hour is more than the energy consumption of the whole earth in a year.”1,2 If sunlight can be harvested economically by utilizing sustainable energy technologies, the world energy crisis and associated environmental concerns will be resolved successfully.3 Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) are one such renewable photovoltaic technology owing to their cost effective production and remarkable power conversion efficiency.4–9 Typically, a DSSC consists of a semiconductor photoanode sensitized by a dye component, a redox electrolyte system, and a counter electrode. The basic principle of a DSSC includes the absorption of sunlight by the sensitizer followed by the injection of electrons into the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor. The injected electrons are collected at the counter electrode through an external circuit while concurrently the oxidized dye is regenerated by the redox system for the next cycle. Obviously, the sensitizer plays an essential role in light harvesting and electron generation/transfer.7,10 Various types of compounds, such as metal complexes and metal free organic sensitizers, have been developed for DSSCs.11–16 Ru(II)-based complexes are one of the dominant classes of sensitizers, because of their superior absorption properties in the visible region and ease of tunability of electronic properties.8,14,17–22 A favorable optimization technique for enhancing the light-harvesting capacity in red-shifting the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption band of the ruthenium sensitizer is the incorporation of an electron donating moiety or a highly conjugated antenna into either its anchoring or ancillary ligand.23–27 The ancillary ligands enhance light-harvesting capabilities and help in tuning the energy levels of the dyes while the anchoring groups bind to the metal oxide and offer interesting effects at the interface between the sensitizer and the TiO2. These ligands are therefore crucial in determining the overall power conversion efficiencies.
Replacing one of the bipyridine ligands of the traditional ruthenium complex with a carbene-pyridine ancillary ligand stabilized the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level for efficient dye regeneration while having the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level for suitable photo-injection of electrons into the CB of TiO2.28 The ancillary ligand with σ electron donating carbene pyridine in the ruthenium complex CBTR28 was proven to enhance overall cell efficiency and offer some scope for the development of various efficient sensitizers in DSSCs.29–31 However, syntheses of bis-pyridyl carbene ruthenium dyes, investigation of the pyridyl carbene as the anchoring ligand, and studies of their effect on the photovoltaic properties of DSSCs have not been reported. Therefore, we were encouraged to take advantage of the unique electronic properties of carbene-pyridyl ligand by replacing both the bipyridine ligands in the traditional Ru(II) complex to study the first case of carbene-pyridyl anchoring ruthenium sensitizers and their influence on conversion efficiencies.
In this study, we report the syntheses of symmetric ruthenium metal complex sensitizers, DC101, DC107, and DC108, utilizing the various acceptors to find a suitable binding moiety for the carbene-pyridyl anchoring ligands and the analyses of their effects on the performance of the DSSCs. As shown in Fig. 1, the new dyes were composed of two 1-octyl-3-(pyridin-2-yl)-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[d]imidazole carbenes with carboxylate (DC101), hydroxamate (DC107), and acyl azide (DC108) anchoring groups and two NCS ligands coordinated to the central ruthenium metal. In addition to the widely used carboxylate functional group, a stable hydroxamate and a new acyl azide binding unit were chosen to explore the appropriate anchoring group for these sensitizers.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
The three new ruthenium sensitizers DC101, DC107, and DC108 were synthesized by the stepwise synthetic protocol depicted in Scheme 1. Compound 2 was obtained in 80% yield by the reaction of benzimidazole (1) with 2-chloroisonicotinonitrile in the presence of K3PO4.32 The alkylation of compound 2 with 1-bromooctane in diethylene glycol dimethyl ether afforded the imidazole salt 3, which was esterified via hydrolysis to yield compound 4. Complex 5 was synthesized by a three-step reaction from ligand 4. Treating compound 4 with [RuCl2(p-cymene)]2 in the presence of lithium hexamethyldisilazide (LHMDS) in CH2Cl2 yielded an intermediate that was further reacted with the imidazole ligand 4 and K2CO3 in ClCH2CH2Cl to afford the ruthenium-chloride complex.28 The chloride ligands of the resulting complex were replaced with NCS in DMF to give the ruthenium-thiocyanate complex 5.33 Ester 5 was utilized to prepare the carbene dyes DC101, DC107, and DC108 under three different reaction conditions. Hydrolysis of complex 5 with 0.5 M NaOH(aq) in EtOH/THF produced the dye DC101 in 90% yield. The hydroxamate dye DC107 was synthesized by a three step reaction. The aqueous tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAOH) mediated hydrolysis of ester 5 followed by the treatment with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) and O-(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)hydroxylamine (THPONH2) afforded a THP protected hydroxamate. Deprotection of the resulting intermediate with amberlyst-15 in THF/MeOH produced DC107 in 87% yield. The dye DC108 was prepared in 82% yield by the hydrolysis of ester complex 5 with TBAOH(aq) in THF followed by treatment with diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA) in THF. Since the DC101, DC107, and DC108 dyes have two long alkyl chains, an analogous ester DC109 was prepared and its single-crystal X-ray diffraction data (Fig. 2 and Table S1, ESI†) was utilized to support the molecular geometry of these DC dyes.

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of the dyes DC101, DC107, and DC108 in DMF solutions and on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 3. The spectra of these DC dyes in solution exhibited strong absorption bands in the visible region of 400–800 nm. The new dyes DC101, DC107, and DC108 showed their respective absorption bands at 495, 476, and 556 nm, corresponding to the intra-ligand π–π* transitions. The lower energy MLCT bands appeared at 588, 553, and 651 nm with the extinction coefficients of 0.90 × 104, 0.94 × 104, and 1.24 × 104 M−1 cm−1 for the dyes DC101, DC107, and DC108, respectively. The MLCT band of the azide dye DC108 was red-shifted by 63–98 nm compared to the MLCT bands of the other dyes DC101 and DC107. The UV-vis spectra of the dyes DC101, DC107, and DC108 adsorbed on TiO2 films (Fig. 3b) exhibited broad absorption bands. The order of the λmax of the MLCT bands of these dyes followed the trend DC108 > DC101 > DC107, which was consistent with the solution spectra. However, these bands were blue-shifted with lower extinction maxima when compared to the solution spectra, and such a blue shift might result from H-aggregation or a conformational change during their self-assembly on the TiO2 photoanode.34

Electrochemical studies
In order to utilize the synthesized dyes as sensitizers in DSSCs, it is necessary to ensure their energy levels are suitable for efficient electron injection and dye regeneration. To realize the feasibility of the electron-transfer process, redox potentials and frontier orbital energy levels of DC101, DC107, and DC108 dyes were measured from their cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S1, ESI†) and UV-vis absorption spectra. Table 1 reveals that the HOMO levels of these dyes are sufficiently lower than that of the electrolyte (I−/I3−) redox couple, ensuring a smooth electron transfer from the electrolyte for efficient dye regeneration. Also, the LUMO energy levels of the dyes DC101, DC107, and DC108 indicated that they are suitable for electron injection into the TiO2 CB edge.

From Table 1, it is clear that the newly synthesized dyes incorporated with dual-pyridyl carbene ligands have narrow band gaps and the narrowest band gap (1.54 eV) of the dye DC108 indicated that its LUMO level was very close to the CB of TiO2.
To further understand the location of the HOMOs and LUMOs, molecular orbital calculations of DC101, DC107, and DC108 were performed and the orbital densities of these dyes are shown in Fig. S2 and S3 (ESI†). The estimated HOMO–LUMO energies are presented in Table S2 (ESI†). The HOMOs of these DC ruthenium dyes are delocalized over the NCS ligands and the ruthenium metal system, and the LUMOs are populated over the carbonyl associated anchoring units through carbene-pyridyl rings of both the ligands. The results of the HOMO–LUMO calculations of these dyes indicate that the electrons move from the electron rich NCS units through the central ruthenium to the carbonyl linked binding moieties by means of photoexcitation of the dye and they are injected into the CB of TiO2via the anchoring groups. Consequently, the photoinduced electron distribution might be appropriate for solar-to-electricity conversion.
Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic properties of the solar cells sensitized by DC101, DC107, and DC108 ruthenium complexes were measured under simulated AM 1.5 G irradiation with various parameters; short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of the devices are summarized in Table 1. Fig. 4 presents their corresponding photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and incident photo-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra. The curves of the integrated Jsc and the corresponding values of the DC dyes calculated from the IPCE spectra are presented in Fig. S4 and Table S3 (ESI†). The DSSCs anchored with the dyes DC101, DC107, and DC108 achieved an overall conversion efficiency (η) of 4.06%, 4.97%, and 1.62%, respectively. The lowest efficiency of the device with the acyl azide sensitizer DC108 arose due its poor photovoltaic parameters: Jsc (4.26 mA cm−2) and Voc (570 mV). The low LUMO level of DC108 with the Fermi level of TiO2 might be one of the reasons for the low voltage of the DC108 cell.35,36 The hydroxamate DC107 device showed the highest Jsc = 9.50 mA cm−2, Voc = 710 mV, and FF = 0.74 resulting in the best power conversion efficiency, which surpassed that of the device based on DC101 with the traditional carboxylate moiety. The highest efficiency of DC107 might be due to effective photo-injection into the TiO2 through its strong binding,37–39 which indicates that the hydroxamate functionality is more appropriate for the carbene-pyridyl anchoring ligand than the common carboxylate group. The IPCE spectra of the solar cells sensitized with the carbene dyes DC101, DC107, and DC108 covered the entire region of 300–680 nm (Fig. 4b). Surprisingly, the device anchored with the dye DC108 showed the lowest IPCE maximum of 35% at 450 nm, which was consistent with the J–V curve but was contradicted by the UV-vis spectra. The lower IPCE of the dye DC108 might originate from the poor injection efficiency of excited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band or the higher charge recombination rate of injected electrons. The larger IPCE value of 60.2% at 480 nm demonstrated by the device sensitized with DC107 was coherent with the observed conversion efficiency.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
For a deeper understanding of the photovoltaic parameters Jsc and Voc, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) studies under illumination (Fig. 5a) as well as under dark (Fig. 5b) conditions were employed and their data are compiled in Table S4 (ESI†). The semicircle in the intermediate-frequency regime of the EIS spectrum obtained under illumination (Fig. 5a) represents the electron transport resistance at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.40,41 The larger radius of the semicircle for the device DC108 implied a lower rate of electron transport at the interface. Also, the EIS data of the acyl azide dye DC108 showed a short electron lifetime (τ = 38 ms) and a large charge transfer resistance (Rw = 21.64 Ω) in the semiconducting photoanode.
 Fig. 5  Electrochemical impedance spectra in the form of Nyquist plots of DC101, DC107, and DC108 sensitized solar cells measured under illumination (a) and under dark (b) conditions. 
Despite having a superior absorption profile, the DC108 sensitized cell delivered the lowest power efficiency, which could be explained from its electrochemical impedance parameters. From Fig. 5b, the radius of the semicircles that signifies the interfacial charge recombination resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface of the devices based on the synthesized dyes was in the decreasing order of DC107 (2706 Ω) > DC101 (917 Ω) > DC108 (390 Ω).42 The larger radius of the semicircle for the cell composed of DC107 compared with those of the devices based on DC101 and DC108 specified a slower charge recombination rate for the DC107 solar cell. Compared to the devices based on the other DC dyes, the highest Jsc and Voc of the hydroxamate DC107 device were supported by its longest electron lifetime (τ = 68 ms) and the largest charge recombination resistance (Rct) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated the design, syntheses, and characterization of symmetric ruthenium complexes DC101, DC107, and DC108 consisting of carbene-pyridyl ligands. For the first time, pyridyl carbenes with various anchoring functionalities were examined to assess their influence on the conversion efficiencies of the solar cells. These new dyes showed prominent absorption profiles and the acyl azide sensitizer DC108 displayed the strongest red-shifted bands with the highest extinction maximum compared to the other DC dyes. Surprisingly, the device based on DC107, the hydroxamate anchoring dye with strong binding and charge injection capacities, displayed the best power conversion efficiency, which exceeded the performance of the DC108 dye and DC101 with the standard carboxylate anchoring group. Further, EIS measurements also revealed the longest electron lifetime and the highest charge recombination resistance for the solar cell based on DC107. In our effort to expose the applicability of σ electron donating carbene pyridines as anchoring ligands and the effects of dual carbene ligands on the peformance of solar cells, it is revealed that the pyridyl carbenes are more favorable for employment as ancillary units rather than anchoring ligands. However, molecular designing with extended conjugation in the carbene-pyridyl anchoring ligand, which may improve the charge separation, decrease the back reaction, and increase the charge injection, resulting in excellent efficiency, is a part of our ongoing research.
Experimental
All the reagents utilized in the syntheses were purchased from commercial sources such as Aldrich, Alfa Aesar, Matrix etc. Common solvents such as DMF, CH2Cl2 and THF were dried using a patented solvent purifier (VAC 103991, Vacuum Atmospheres). CH3CN and other solvents were of HPLC grade. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 300 or 500 MHz spectrometer with CDCl3 and/or DMSO-d6 as solvents. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV3600 UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer, with DMF as solvent. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry was performed using a JMS-700 HRMS spectrometer. Cyclic voltammogram experiments were carried out on a CHI627C electrochemical analyzer (CH Instruments).

Fabrication of the dye-sensitized solar cell
The working electrode of the cell consisted of a dye adsorbed layer and a scattering layer. The TiO2 pastes for the dye adsorbed layer and the scattering layer were prepared from an anatase TiO2 (a-TiO2) sol and TiO2 powder, respectively. To prepare a-TiO2 paste, titanium(IV) n-butoxide was added to aqueous 2 M CH3COOH and stirred to yield a translucent solution. The resulting mixture was subjected to hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C for 5 h followed by washing and centrifuging twice with ethanol to obtain the a-TiO2 sol. The above precipitate was dissolved in ethanol(anhyd) (50 mL) and stirred for 24 h. The a-TiO2 sol was homogenized followed by dispersion in α-terpineol (12.98 g) with ethyl cellulose (45 cps, 0.96 g) in absolute ethanol (15.04 g). After evaporating the solvent, the paste was ground to afford the desired TiO2 paste using a three roller miller.
To prepare the paste for the TiO2 scattering layer, 1.0 g of TiO2 powder (QF-1125) in ethanol (40 mL) was stirred and sonicated. To the above solution, α-terpineol (6.49 g) and a solution of two viscosities of ethyl cellulose (10 cps 0.45 g and 45 cps 0.35 g) in ethanol (7.2 g) were added and sonicated. The resulting solution was concentrated at 40 °C under 70 mbar and the paste was then ground by a three-roller-miller to yield the TiO2 scattering layer.
The TiO2 photoanode for the absorbed dye was prepared by coating a-TiO2 sol paste on the fluorine-doped SnO2 conducting glass (Solaronix, sheet resistance 8 Ω □−1) using a screen printing technique (HANKY, TP-4001). The active working area of the TiO2 electrodes was 0.16 cm2. The resulting TiO2 film was dried by the following sintering process: 110 °C for 30 min, 125 °C for 15 min, 325 °C for 5 min, 375 °C for 5 min, and finally 450 °C for 30 min. A similar process was utilized to prepare the TiO2 scattering layer of the working electrode by coating with QF-1125 paste instead. The TiO2 working electrode was heated at 80 °C for 15 min and then dipped into a solution of 0.3 mM dye in DMF at 30 °C for 24 h. The DSSC assembly was performed by placing a Pt electrode over the dye-adsorbed TiO2 electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 0.5 M lithium iodide, 0.05 M iodide, 0.5 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propyl imidazolium iodide, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in acetonitrile.
Characterization of DSSCs
The photovoltaic parameters were measured using a Keithley model 2400 source measuring unit with an A-class solar simulator with a 300 W Xenon light source having an AM 1.5 filter. The light intensity at the cell measuring position was adjusted to 100 mW cm−2 using an NREL-calibrated monocrystalline silica solar cell (PVM134 reference cell, PV Measurement, Inc.). The IPCEs were measured by equipment comprising a 150 W Xenon lamp, a monochromator (Oriel CornerstoneTM 130), and a Keithley model 2400.
EIS measurements
EIS was employed using an impedance analyzer (IM6ex, Zahner, Germany) at a constant voltage under illumination (100 mW cm−2) with an ac amplitude of 10 mV and a frequency range of 102–105 Hz (Fig. 5a). Alternative impedance spectra (Fig. 5b) of DSSCs fabricated with DC101, DC107 and DC108 were measured at a forward bias of 0.70 V under dark conditions. The Z-VIEW software was utilized for modeling and fitting the EIS data of the DSSCs to obtain their various electron transport parameters (Fig. S4, ESI†).
