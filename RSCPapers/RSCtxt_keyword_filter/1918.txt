    , Accepted 27th February 2012First published on 29th February 2012AbstractWe report a new optical approach that can be used to enhance light harvesting in many different organic-based photovoltaic cells. A transparent polymer microlens array moulded on the light incident surface increases the light path in the active layer and reduces surface reflection, resulting in a 15–60% relative increase in overall cell efficiency.

Broader context
Organic-based photovoltaic (OPV) devices can be fabricated on low-cost and light weight substrates using high throughput, roll-to-roll manufacturing processes, and therefore have been considered as a potential solution for low-cost solar energy harvesting. In the last decade, we have seen many great advances in the development of new materials and device architecture, as well as further understanding of the device operation principles. While the power conversion efficiency of such OPV devices has exceeded 8% recently, further enhancement in the efficiency is still needed to meet commercial application requirements. Designing optical structures to manage light absorption (such as light trapping) has been a significant research topic for inorganic semiconductor based photovoltaics; however, it has not received similar attention for OPV devices. Here we demonstrate that by moulding a transparent polymer microlens array on the light incident surface of several different types of OPV devices, a 15–60% relative increase in the overall cell efficiency can be achieved. We believe that the simplicity, near universal applicability, and compatibility with high throughput manufacturing make this optical approach an attractive technology for use in future commercial OPV devices.

In the search for affordable, clean and renewable energy sources, organic-based photovoltaics (OPVs) have emerged as a promising candidate to directly convert solar energy to electricity. Their ability to offer mechanically robust, inexpensive, and light weight modules has fuelled much interest over the past two decades.1–4 Performance of OPV devices is beginning to approach reasonable values for market acceptance with recent reports of record power conversion efficiencies exceeding 8%.4,5 While much of the work in this field has been focused on developing new materials, materials processing techniques, and/or new device architectures to improve device efficiency and lifetime, there has been very limited research in studying and manipulating the coupling of incident light into the active layer. Here, we report that the efficiency of an OPV cell can be relatively improved significantly by attaching a close-packed, hemispherical, transparent polymer microlens array (MLA) to the light incident surface of the device using a soft-lithographic moulding method. The efficiency improvement is attributed to a longer optical path length for the incident light inside the photoactive layer(s) and reduced surface reflection induced by the MLA. This optical approach is also shown to be universally applicable to a wide range of OPV materials and device platforms, with materials ranging across small molecules, polymers, and polymer–colloidal nanoparticle hybrid materials, and device structures including bilayer, bulk heterojunction, and semi-transparent devices.
The operation of an efficient OPV device generally includes four basic processes: light absorption to generate excitons (bound electron–hole pairs), exciton diffusion to a donor–acceptor (D–A) heterojunction interface, exciton dissociation at the D–A interface to generate separated charge carriers, and charge collection at opposite electrodes.1 A fundamental trade-off exists between light absorption and either exciton diffusion (in planar heterojunction or bilayer architectures) or charge collection (bulk heterojunction architectures).6 While thicker active layer(s) are desired to efficiently absorb incident photons, optimizing the charge generation and extraction processes entails the use of thinner active layers to minimize the distances required for an exciton to diffuse to a D–A interface and/or for charge carriers to travel to an appropriate electrode.
There have been many different approaches to ameliorating this trade-off through the synthesis of new active layer materials with enhanced carrier mobilities,7–9 and the optimization of device architectures to increase exciton diffusion efficiency10,11 and create favourable morphologies for charge collection.12–15 Alternatively, there have been few reports on optical designs to induce light trapping in OPV cells, such as manufacturing on prism-shaped substrates,16 V-aligned solar cells,17,18 a patterned mirror-and-lens light trap,19 and the use of a pyramidal rear reflector.20 While they effectively increase light absorption in devices and increase performance by 10–30%, many of these optical designs are incompatible with high-throughput, inexpensive processing techniques or are nontrivial or even impractical for implementation with large-area devices. Further, anti-reflective coatings used on inorganic PVs are not ideal for OPVs due to the low refractive index of the glass substrate. Here, we present the use of easily processed, soft lithographically moulded microlens arrays to enhance light absorption in a wide range of organic-based photovoltaics without changing the internal optoelectronic characteristics of the devices.

Fig. 1(a) shows the schematic device structure of an OPV cell containing a MLA attached to the light-incident surface. Without the MLA, the optical path length for the normal incident light is simply twice the active layer thickness ta (considering reflection off of the cathode), as illustrated. However, two advantageous processes occur with the MLA: first, light striking a microlens will have a non-normal incident angle due to the curved microlens surface, which results in refraction of the incoming light. Second, light reflecting off of one microlens may strike a neighbouring lens, where the lens curvature results in an incident angle favourable for transmission. In either case, when the light reaches the active layer, it has taken on an additional angular component that effectively increases the path length to L = 2ta/cos θ > 2ta, where θ is the angle relative to the normal direction and varies for rays striking different locations on a microlens. From the ray optics point of view, this leads to an overall increase in the absorption efficiency ηA according to the Beer–Lambert law, ηA = 1 − exp (−αL), where α is the wavelength-dependent absorption coefficient.

To demonstrate the universal applicability of this MLA approach, we have fabricated several different types of efficient OPV cells: vacuum-deposited, small molecule-based planar heterojunction cells; solution-processed, polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction cells; and solution-processed, polymer:colloidal nanocrystal hybrid cells. Devices were fabricated on glass substrates coated with a transparent indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode. The substrates were sonicated in successive solutions of surfactant, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol, and then treated with UV-generated ozone immediately prior to device fabrication. Small molecule OPV devices using boron subphthalocyanine chloride (subPc)21 as the donor and C60 as the acceptor were deposited in a high-vacuum thermal evaporator (base pressure ∼10−7 Torr), which also included a bathocuproine (BCP) exciton blocking layer1 prior to the deposition of an Al cathode. For polymer:fullerene and hybrid devices, a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) layer spin coated from an aqueous solution and subsequently annealed in air was the hole extraction layer. The active layers, and in some cases a ZnO nanoparticle layer, were spin coated in a nitrogen-filled glovebox (water and oxygen concentrations <0.1 ppm). Semi-transparent poly(3-hexylthiophene):[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT:PCBM)12,15 devices used an electron-selective cathode of ITO/ZnO nanoparticles and a vacuum-deposited trilayer anode of MoO3/Au/MoO3.22 The device active areas were approximately 4 mm2 using a crossbar geometry. Except for the semi-transparent devices, a large area rear reflector (2.25 cm2) of vacuum-deposited aluminium was used to mimic the geometric characteristics of a large area device; a 100 nm thick spin coated layer of Cytop fluoropolymer was used to insulate the reflector from the device electrodes. Devices were encapsulated after fabrication to limit degradation during further characterization. Full details on material processing and device fabrication can be found in the ESI†.
Microlens arrays were fabricated using our previously published soft-lithographic molding technique23,24 from NOA 63 (Norland Products), a commercially available UV-curable optical adhesive with a refractive index of n ≈ 1.56 in the as-cured material. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) molds were created using self-assembled monolayers of 100 μm diameter polystyrene (PS) microspheres, which were subsequently removed using scotch tape liftoff. The optical adhesive and substrate were then placed on top of a mold and cured with 365 nm UV light. PDMS molds with array areas up to a few square inches can be readily fabricated in the laboratory and may be used several dozen times before they must be replaced. Fig. 1(b) shows a scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a resulting close-packed MLA, and the hemispherical shape (or 90° contact angle) of the microlenses can be seen in the cross-sectional image shown in the inset. Arrays of smaller microlenses can be obtained using smaller PS microspheres, although the microlens contact angle becomes less than 90° as we reported earlier.23,24 However, assuming a fixed contact angle, varying the microlens base diameter should have no effect on the overall performance as long as the diameter is much greater than the optical wavelength.
Current–voltage characteristics were measured in the dark and under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination from an Oriel Xe-arc lamp using an Agilent 4155C semiconductor parameter analyzer. The power intensity was measured using a calibrated silicon reference cell with a KG1 filter, and the spectral mismatch factor was corrected according to the ASTM Standard E973.25 Performance reported below represents averages of 4 to 16 devices with identical structures, and the errors include the standard deviation among these devices as well as uncertainties in device area and lamp intensity variations. External quantum efficiencies were measured using a Stanford Research Systems DSP830 lock-in amplifier together with a Keithley 428 current amplifier. The monochromatic beam was produced with an Oriel tungsten lamp coupled to an Oriel 1/4 meter monochromator. The monochromatic beam was chopped using a mechanical chopper, providing the reference signal to the lock-in amplifier. Fig. 2(a) shows the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of a small molecule-based, subPc(12 nm)/C60(40 nm) planar heterojunction device under 1 sun AM1.5G solar illumination, with and without a MLA. With the MLA, the short-circuit current density JSC is significantly increased from JSC = (4.6 ± 0.2) mA cm−2 to (5.4 ± 0.3) mA cm−2 for a relative increase of ΔJSC/JSC = 17% (where ΔJSC is the absolute increase in JSC after the attachment of the MLA). Combined with minimal increases in the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF), the power conversion efficiency also increases from ηP = (3.1 ± 0.2)% to (3.7 ± 0.2)%, a 19% relative increase. A comparison of the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the device with and without the MLA, as shown in Fig. 2(b), illustrates that the enhancement is present across all wavelengths, though it is not constant. In general, the relative increase is greater in regions where absorption is relatively weak (e.g., at wavelengths λ > 620 nm) and smaller at wavelengths where the molecules absorb strongly (e.g., at λ ≈ 575 nm, the peak of subPc absorption). This is in agreement with predictions from the Beer–Lambert law. The reduced EQE near 350 nm for the device with the MLA is caused by absorption of the microlens material.

(b) External quantum efficiency (EQE, ηEQE) spectra for the same device architecture with and without a MLA, and the relative increase in EQE, Δη/η, with the attachment of a MLA. (c) Dependence of the relative increase in the power conversion efficiency, ΔηP/ηP, on the C60 layer thickness. 
Note that due to interference between the incident light and reflected light off of the metal electrode, the optical intensity inside of the active layer does not decay exponentially as predicted by the Beer–Lambert law. Under normal incidence, interference patterns emerge inside a device with maximum intensity occurring at a distance of approximately (2m + 1)λ/4n away from the reflective cathode, where n is the wavelength-dependent refractive index and m is an integer indicating the order of interference. When the angle of incidence is shifted by refraction due to the MLA, the peak intensity locations are shifted further away from the cathode. This optical field shift can be exploited by tailoring the placement of the heterojunction interface by varying the C60 acceptor layer thickness tC60 to adjust the optical intensity profile. As shown in Fig. 2(c), the relative increase in ηP, or ΔηP/ηP, shows a strong dependence on tC60, and a maximum relative increase of (56 ± 6)% is obtained at tC60 = 80 nm. We have modified a transfer matrix model1 to calculate the optical field and the resulting absorption in the device with a MLA. As shown in Fig. 2(c), both qualitative and quantitative agreements are obtained. Additional details are provided in the ESI†.
Optical considerations are of substantial importance in understanding the nature of MLA-induced enhancement. In contrast to a planar heterojunction device with a fixed two-dimensional interface for exciton dissociation, we have also considered bulk heterojunction P3HT:PCBM devices in which exciton dissociation (and charge generation) occurs throughout the active layer. Using the conventional device structure where a reflective metal cathode was used together with a transparent anode, a similar relative increase scheme to the subPc/C60 device was obtained for the P3HT:PCBM device (Fig. 3(a), “conventional”). The optimal improvement is found when the bulk of the optical field is still within the device active layer. With very thin active layers the MLA shifts the optical field outside of the active layer, negating any benefit from increased path length. In a semi-transparent device (Fig. 3(a), “semi-transparent”), in which both electrodes are transparent such that interference is inconsequential in the active layer, we observe a decrease in the relative enhancement due to the MLA as the active layer thickness increases; this is in agreement with expectations following the Beer–Lambert relationship. For the conventional P3HT:PCBM device, we further exploited the optical interference effect by inserting a transparent ZnO nanoparticle-based optical spacer26 between the active layer and the reflecting aluminium cathode. As shown in Fig. 3(b), the relative increase in JSC and ηP shows strong dependencies on the ZnO thickness, tZnO, and the maximum relative increase of 28% in ηP is achieved with tZnO = 45 nm.

We emphasize that the mechanism of enhancement is not specific to the active materials and/or device structure. Fig. 4 shows comparisons of J–V characteristics for very high efficiency polymer:fullerene cells [Fig. 4(a)] and polymer–nanocrystal hybrid cells [Fig. 4(b) and (c)] with and without a MLA. It is noted that the devices without MLAs are all based on already optimized state-of-the-art materials and device structures. Devices with an active layer of poly(benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene)-(5,6-difluoro-4,7-dithien-2-yl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole) (PBnDT-DTffBT):PCBM27 show relative increases of ηP from 6.2% to 7.0%, a relative increase of approximately 13%. For hybrid PV cells with active layers consisting of a low-gap polymer poly[2,6-(4,4-bis-(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene)-alt-4,7-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCPDTBT) and CdSe nanoparticles (∼7 nm diameter),28 a 18% relative increase was obtained in ηP with a ZnO optical spacing layer, 32% without any optical spacer. As in previous cases, the ηP improvement in these devices is mostly attributed to the increase in JSC, whereas the VOC and FF are only changed slightly. Table 1 summarizes the relevant performance characteristics and relative increases for several device architectures with and without a MLA.

Recognizing that the solar illumination angle varies throughout the day for a photovoltaic module without a solar tracking system, we have also studied the dependence of the relative increase on the incident light direction. As shown in Fig. 5 for a 1 cm2 bilayer subPc/C60 device under ∼5 mW cm−2 white light illumination, the device without a MLA shows a monotonic decrease in JSC as the tilt angle is increased, closely following a predicted JSC(θ) = JSC(0)cos θ; this suggests compensation between increased surface reflectivity and increased path length through the active layer. This relationship deviates at very high incident angles, where surface reflection dominates. With a microlens array, the situation is similar until at large angles, where the measured current outperforms the cos θ dependence. The relative increase in JSC is mostly constant for θ < 50°, however, it sharply increases from ∼15% (for θ < 60°) to 90% at θ = 80°. We attribute this behaviour to the curved lens surface effectively reducing the reflection of high-angle incident light.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated that attaching a soft-lithographically moulded microlens array to the light-incident surface of an OPV device effectively increases the optical path lengths and reduces light reflection losses, resulting in a 15–60% relative increase in the power conversion efficiency. As this enhancement mechanism is an optical effect stemming from the interaction between the incident light and the substrate, it is compatible with a wide range of active layer materials and device platforms including vacuum-deposited bilayer subPc/C60 small molecule devices, high efficiency polymer:fullerene bulk heterojunction devices, and hybrid inorganic nanoparticle/polymer devices.
The demonstrated efficiency improvement is similar or even higher than previously reported approaches.16–20 More importantly, the MLA approach here can be applied to already-optimized devices without changing the active layer structure or substrate configuration. The MLAs are made of inexpensive, commercially available materials using a high-throughput, roll-to-roll compatible soft lithography technique. The MLA is attached to the outer device surface; hence it does not alter the active layer deposition environment which is known to strongly affect the morphology and photovoltaic characteristics of the active layer. Finally, enhancements are present regardless of the illumination angle, with the curved nature of the incident surface reducing initial reflection loss at high angles. The simplicity, near universal applicability, and compatibility with high throughput manufacturing make this a suitable technique for use in commercial-scale organic-based photovoltaic devices.

Organic-based photovoltaic (OPV) devices can be fabricated on low-cost and light weight substrates using high throughput, roll-to-roll manufacturing processes, and therefore have been considered as a potential solution for low-cost solar energy harvesting. In the last decade, we have seen many great advances in the development of new materials and device architecture, as well as further understanding of the device operation principles. While the power conversion efficiency of such OPV devices has exceeded 8% recently, further enhancement in the efficiency is still needed to meet commercial application requirements. Designing optical structures to manage light absorption (such as light trapping) has been a significant research topic for inorganic semiconductor based photovoltaics; however, it has not received similar attention for OPV devices. Here we demonstrate that by moulding a transparent polymer microlens array on the light incident surface of several different types of OPV devices, a 15–60% relative increase in the overall cell efficiency can be achieved. We believe that the simplicity, near universal applicability, and compatibility with high throughput manufacturing make this optical approach an attractive technology for use in future commercial OPV devices.
