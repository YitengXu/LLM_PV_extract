Using CoTe and NiTe2-based CEs, photoelectric conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 6.92% and 7.21% were achieved for DSCs, respectively, comparable to that of 7.04% achieved when using a Pt-based CE. The results indicated that, serving as a CE in DSCs, telluride could be a cost-effective and efficient alternative to the noble metal Pt.In the past decades, excessive utilization of fossil energies has resulted in energy crisis and global warming and has attracted wide attention from the public. Thus, developing clean energies has become essential and urgent. As one of the most promising photovoltaic devices to convert solar energy directly to electric power, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have become the research focus due to their advantages of low-cost, cleanliness, ease of fabrication and relatively high photoelectric conversion efficiency (PCE).1 As one of the crucial components of DSCs, the counter electrode (CE) is responsible for collecting electrons from the external circuit to reduce triiodide (I3−) into iodide (I−).2 Platinum (Pt), the widely used CE, exhibits excellent catalytic activity but the high cost severely restricts the large-scale application of DSCs.3 In addition, Pt can be decomposed into PtI4 in traditional electrolyte containing the I3−/I− redox couple, which is unfavorable for long-term stability of DSCs.4 Therefore, exploring economic, stable, effective and Pt-free substitutes has become a topic of interest.Among the potential alternatives to Pt, carbon materials and organic functional polymers were firstly tested for use as CEs in DSCs.5,6 Inorganic materials, especially some transition metal compounds, such as carbides,7 nitrides,8,9 phosphides,10 and oxides,11 have been developed to fabricate CEs for DSCs in recent years. Meanwhile, with high catalytic activities for the reduction of I3−, it was found that chalcogenides (MxSy or MxSey, where M is a transition metal) could also be used as CEs in DSCs.12 Cobalt sulfide (CoS) acicular nanorod arrays, previously reported by Kung et al., demonstrated good performance in DSCs.13 MoS2 and WS2 that were prepared by a hydrothermal method also enabled the DSCs to achieve a high efficiency.14 In 2012, for the first time Wang et al. reported the use of two selenides, Co0.85Se and Ni0.85Se, in DSCs and finally, high photoelectric conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of up to 9.40% were obtained, indicating the great potential of chalcogenides as CEs in DSCs.15 Among chalcogenides, tellurides have been generally used in solar cells to capture sunlight in the form of thin films of quantum dots. However no research has so far been carried out to apply tellurides as CEs in DSCs.Herein, using a composite-hydroxide-mediated (CHM) approach, we synthesized CoTe and NiTe2 nanostructures and for the first time applied them as prominent Pt-free CE materials in DSCs. Based on the eutectic mixture of NaOH and KOH in a certain proportion as solvent, Te powder and NiCl2·6H2O or CoSO4·7H2O were mixed to react at 200 °C for 48 h. The samples were obtained by washing, drying, and thermally treating the products at 400 °C for 1 h under a N2 atmosphere. Compared with some traditional synthetic approaches like the hydrothermal or solvothermal routes, no organic dispersant or surface capping agent was needed for the CHM, easy to realize mass-production. More importantly, CoTe and NiTe2-based CEs exhibited notable electrocatalytic activity and PCEs of 6.92% and 7.21% were achieved for DSCs, respectively, comparable to that of 7.04% achieved when using a Pt-based CE.Morphologies of CoTe and NiTe2 are illustrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images in Fig. 1. We observe that most of the CoTe particles feature the octahedral shape ranging from 300 nm to 600 nm. By contrast, NiTe2 looks like irregular plates with the dimensions ranging from 300 nm to 1.2 μm. Crystal phases of the two samples were determined by power X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, as shown in Fig. 2. XRD patterns indicate that the two tellurides synthesized by CHM at 200 °C for 48 h are well crystallized. These two compounds were identified as orthorhombic CoTe and NiTe2 since all diffraction peaks could be well indexed according to their JCPDS cards (No. 34-0420 and 08-0004) (Table S1, ESI†). In addition, in Fig. 1 no peaks of impurities were detected. Fig. 1  SEM patterns of the synthesized (a) CoTe and (b) NiTe2.  Fig. 2  XRD patterns of the synthesized NiTe2 and CoTe. To evaluate the electrocatalytic activity of the as-prepared CoTe and NiTe2 samples, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed in a three-electrode system and the results are shown in Fig. 3a. Each CV curve shows two pairs of redox peaks that have been reported in our previous work.16 In general, the left pair corresponds to the redox reaction of I3−/I−, whereas the right pair corresponds to the reaction of I2/I3−. According to the reaction of I3−/I−, the cathodic peak current density reflects the reduction of I3− while the anodic peak current density corresponds to the oxidation of the I−, respectively. Additionally, peak-to-peak separation (Epp) is associated with the reversibility of the redox reaction. As shown in Fig. 3a, the CV profile and the peak positions of CoTe and NiTe2 are similar to Pt, illustrating similar catalytic activities for I3− reduction. In detail, cathodic peak potentials of CoTe and NiTe2 CEs however locate at 0.25 V, larger than that of 0.12 V for Pt CE and suggesting that I3− was able to be reduced more easily on the telluride CEs. On the other hand, compared with the Pt CE, these two telluride CEs exhibit smaller Epp values (CoTe: 200 mV; NiTe2: 160 mV; Pt: 350 mV) and higher cathodic peak current density. Thus, in terms of I3−/I− redox reaction, it can be concluded that both the electrocatalytic activity and the reversibility of the telluride CEs are superior to the conventional Pt CE.

(c) Tafel polarization curves of the symmetrical cells. (d) J–V curves of the DSCs based on CoTe, NiTe2, and Pt CEs. To better understand the electrochemical characteristics of telluride CEs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) characterization was performed using symmetric cells fabricated with two identical electrodes under dark conditions. Fig. 3b demonstrates the Nyquist plots of EIS. The equivalent circuit model used to simulate the resultant EIS data of CEs is shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) while the simulated results are summarized in Table 1. As demonstrated in Fig. 3b, for every sample two semicircles are observed in the high-frequency (left) and low-frequency (right) regions, respectively. The serial resistance (Rs) can be determined by the high frequency intercept on the real axis. As listed in Table 1, Rs values of CoTe and NiTe2 are 26.10 Ω and 24.76 Ω, respectively, over twice that of the Pt CE (12.38 Ω). Larger Rs is usually caused by bulk resistance, conductivity of telluride and adhesion between telluride and the FTO substrate. According to the previous literature,17 high Rs could result in higher Voc, as proved by the J–V results listed in Table 1. The first semicircle, arising from the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at the CE–electrolyte interface and relevant double-layer capacitance (CPE), reflects the electrocatalytic activity of the CE.8 Differently from the tendency of Rs, Rct decreases in the order of Pt (6.7 Ω) > CoTe (4.25 Ω) > NiTe2 (1.04 Ω), indicating better electrocatalytic activities of telluride CEs for I3− reduction and advantageous for improving the photovoltaic performance of DSCs. This result is in good agreement with above CV measurements. Moreover, due to the porous-morphology-dependent large surface area, the two telluride CEs have larger CPE values when compared with the Pt CE. In the Nyquist plots, the right semicircle reflects the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the I3−/I− redox species within the electrolyte. Compared with that of Pt (5.1 Ω), the ZN of CoTe and NiTe2 are 0.45 Ω and 1.23 Ω, respectively, suggesting that I3− and I− ions can diffuse freely in the porous telluride CEs, which is quite advantageous for the circuit charge cycle of DSCs. On the other hand, the fact that ZN of CoTe is lower than NiTe2 must be relevant to the difference in their nanostructures and worthy of further investigations. Hence, it can be concluded that, compared with the Pt CE, CoTe and NiTe2 CEs possess larger Rs but smaller Rct and ZN values.

Fig. 3c demonstrates the Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells based on these three CEs used in EIS experiments and the logarithmic current density (logJ) as a function of the potential (U). From Fig. 3c we can observe that the anodic and cathodic branches of the telluride CEs at the middle potential range (Tafel zone) show a slightly larger tangent slope than that of Pt CE, thereby indicating a higher exchange current density (J0). (1) The relationship between J0 and Rct can be expressed as eqn (1), where R is the gas constant, F is Faraday's constant, T is the temperature, and n is the number of electrons involved in the reduction of I3− at the CE. Accordingly, the Tafel results indicate that the Rct values of telluride CEs were lower than the Pt CE, well consistent with the EIS measurements. (2) Furthermore, the limiting current density (Jlim) that arises at a relatively high potential (U > 0.2 V) in the Tafel curve could be used to calculate ionic diffusion coefficient D according to eqn (2), in which L is the spacer thickness and C is the I3− concentration. As demonstrated in Fig. 3c, Jlim values of telluride CEs are slightly higher than that of the Pt CE. Thus, compared with the Pt CE, D values of I3− in the case of CoTe and NiTe2 are larger, consistent with EIS analysis. Results obtained from CV, EIS and Tafel measurements demonstrate that, as CEs for DSCs, CoTe and NiTe2 are desired electrocatalysts for I3− reduction reaction due to their superior catalytic activities.Fig. 3d compares the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the DSCs assembled using various CEs. Photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding DSC devices are summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 3d, the short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) of the DSCs with the CoTe-based CE are 12.56 mA cm−2, 0.77 V and 0.71, respectively, finally yielding a PCE of 6.92%. Under the same fabrication conditions, however, NiTe2-based DSCs produced a PCE of 7.21% (Jsc = 14.13 mA cm−2, Voc =0.79 V, FF = 0.65), comparable to that of 7.04% obtained by DSCs using the conventional Pt CE. It should be noted that, for DSCs based on telluride CEs, higher Voc values could be ascribed to the relatively large Rs values revealed by the above EIS measurements.17 In addition, for NiTe2-based DSCs, it was the higher Voc rather than Jsc values that actually resulted in a comparable PCE to Pt-based DSCs. Based on the photovoltaic performance of DSCs, we believe that tellurides have great potential to serve as alternatives to the Pt CE.In summary, two transition metal tellurides CoTe and NiTe2 have been successfully synthesized using a novel CHM approach and have been used as CEs in DSCs for the first time. Electrochemical measurements proved that, for the heterogeneous electrocatalytic CE–electrolyte system, these two tellurides showed good activities to reduce I3− into I−. Moreover, DSCs based on telluride CEs exhibited comparable photovoltaic performances to those based on the conventional Pt CE. The results in this work suggest that, as CEs in DSCs, telluride-based catalysts have enormous potential. This discovery expands the range of utilization of tellurides and offers another strategy for preparing low-cost and highly efficient CEs for DSCs.This work was financially supported by the National High Technology Research and Development Program for Advanced Materials of China (grant 2009AA03Z220), National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 51273032), Doctoral Found of Ministry of Education of China (grant 2110041110003) and Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of Physical Chemical of Solid Surfaces, Xiamen University (grant 201210).
