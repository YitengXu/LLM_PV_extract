    , Accepted 12th October 2022First published on 13th October 2022AbstractDue to their remarkable performance and ease of processing in low temperature solutions, organometal hybrid perovskite solar cells (HPSCs) have recently become a hot topic. Current solution processes extensively use hazardous chemicals, such as chlorobenzene, in perovskite and hole-transport material deposition processes. Therefore, the invention of safe and economical solvent technologies is a prerequisite for commercial viability. Herein, ethyl lactate (biodegradable, non-hazardous, and inexpensive solvent) is utilized for the first time as a green solvent to enhance the quality of anti-solvent-assisted solution-engineered perovskite films. The obtained results show that the incorporation of a certain amount of ethyl lactate can produce a homogeneous and highly crystalline perovskite layer with enhanced optoelectronic properties. This method increases the efficiency of 2D/3D tripe-cation HPSCs to 21.78% (against 17.09% for the control cells) with a decreased hysteretic effect and improved moisture stability.
1. Introduction
Hybrid perovskite solar cells (HPSCs) have advanced rapidly since their introduction in 2009 and now have a verified efficiency (PCE) of 25.5%, which is close to those of economically marketed monocrystalline silicon photovoltaics (PVs).1–4 Perovskites are inexpensive and adaptable to solution-based processing, in addition to having a long charge-carrier diffusion length, high absorption ability, controllable optical bandgap, ambipolar charge transfer, and exceptional defect tolerance.5,6 However, a major challenge to the widespread use of 3D perovskite is the need to improve their low stability, which is caused by their decomposition when exposed to water, heat, and radiation. The quality of the perovskites and the perovskite/transport layer interface are critical to optimizing solar efficiency and device longevity.7,8 Grain boundaries (GBs), pinholes, and impurities present in bulk or at interfacial sites, in particular, can accelerate ion migration and operate as photocarrier recombination centers, resulting in energy loss and device deterioration.9–11
Researchers have looked at the problem of moisture sensitivity in 3D perovskites in a number of different ways. A HTL/perovskite interface modifier could effectively mitigate the mechanical or chemical deterioration of the interface.12 Recent attention has focused on 2D perovskites (as capping layers) because of their exceptional ability to resist moisture. In fact, utilizing them as passivating layers over 3D perovskites has arisen as a possible source of stability improvement in HPSCs with good HPSC efficiency.13–15 Typically, 2D perovskite films are fabricated by incorporating a large hydrophobic cation buffer into the perovskite crystalline structure, which efficiently prevents the penetration of humidity and improves the HPSC performance.16,17 Other research teams have preferred to prepare 2D perovskites over 3D perovskites in a layer-by-layer manner.15,18 Both methods demonstrate the superior stability of mixed hybrid perovskites over 3D-only perovskite devices.
Considering toxicity, it has been argued that the toxic effects of lead (Pb) in HPSCs may not have a significant influence on the environment thanks to the very low dosage employed (0.4 g Pb per m2 of HPSC panels).19 The toxicity not only of the Pb halide perovskite but also of the solvents used in the entire HPSC operational procedure has increasingly become a significant hurdle to the upscaling of the low-cost solution process. So, a solvent technique that is safe for the environment and people should be used to reduce the risk of air pollution and harm to people.20–23 There should be a thorough evaluation of all solvents utilized in the processing chain, not only the one used for dissolving the precursor components. For instance, organic p-type materials like Spiro-OMeTAD were commonly utilized as the HTL in HPSCs, but they were dissolved in the very toxic solvent chlorobenzene.24–26 Moreover, chlorobenzene solvent is widely used as an efficient anti-solvent to modulate the microstructure of the perovskite layer. The success of the anti-solvent technique in controlling crystal development to generate high quality films has been demonstrated by its use in achieving efficient and stable mixed cation HPSCs.27
Fangyv et al. used an additive engineering approach based on green fumaric acid to modify the triple-cation perovskite for high-performance HPSCs. It has been found that fumaric acid not only stabilizes the [PbI6]4− framework of the perovskite crystals and efficiently passivates the surface defects, but it also improves nucleation processes to endow the perovskites with large sized grains and few GBs.28 Pengyun et al. used a green and natural cellulose derivative containing hydrogen bonds into methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) precursors to serve as a bi-functional additive. Consequently, the compact and pinhole-less morphology of the cellulose-treated MAPbI3 film with large sized crystals and passivated GBs is realized. The best-performing HPSC yielded a PCE of 19.5% with negligible hysteresis.29 Giuliana and colleagues employed α-terpineol as a nontoxic additive into the solution-processed CH3NH3PbI3−xClx perovskite. The obtained results showed that the inclusion of a certain concentration of α-terpineol can induce good crystalline perovskites with enhanced device performance.30 Zhenghui and colleagues introduced emerald salt (ES) as a polymeric additive into a precursor solution of MA-free perovskite. This additive interacted with uncoordinated lead iodide (Pb2+) ions resulting in a reduction in defect density and suppressing non-radiative recombination, which could act as a charge transporter due to its conductive merit. The ES-processed MA-free device achieved a champion PCE of 23%.31
Considering the above discussion, we report a high-quality mixed-cation perovskite by utilizing a precursor solution containing green ethyl lactate as a solvent additive. It was shown that the inclusion of a precise concentration of ethyl lactate into the perovskite solution can result in the MAPbI3 perovskite with increased crystallinity, reduced roughness, and passivated grain boundaries. The obtained findings reveal that through solvent engineering, trap state density and nonradiative carrier recombination are remarkably suppressed. For mesoscopic 2D/3D mixed-dimensional HPSCs, a champion device performance of 21.78% was attained, together with enhanced stability and decreased hysteresis.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Solution preparation
To prepare the hole-blocking TiO2 (b-TiO2) solution, precursor solutions based on 0.3 mL of acetylacetone (99%, Merck) and 0.7 mL of titanium isopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (in isopropanol) were mixed in 9 mL of absolute ethanol at room temperature. We utilize TiO2 paste (Dyesol) added in ethanol to prepare a mesoporous TiO2 (ms-TiO2) proper solution. Before utilization, the resultant dispersion is vigorously stirred overnight. The mixture is kept under constant stirring.32 A triple-cation mixed-halide perovskite solution was synthesised according to a previously reported experiment.33 Traditionally, a precursor solution comprising formamidinium iodide (FAI, 1 M, GreatCell Solar), MA bromide (MABr, 0.2 M, Ossila), PbI2 (1.1 M, Sigma-Aldrich), and lead(II) bromide (PbBr2, 0.2 M, TCI) was formed in a volume of 1 mL using a 4:1 v/v combination of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The aforementioned precursor solution was then mixed with cesium iodide stock solution (CsI, 40 μL, Alfa Aesar) in DMSO (1.5 M) and stirred for 3 hours at 65 °C in a N2-filled glovebox to achieve the Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 perovskite. The additive was added into perovskite stock solutions at various doses, namely, 3, 6, and 9 mg mL−1. 4-Fluoro-phenethylammonium iodide (FPEAI, 99%, GreatCell Solar) solution was prepared by adding FPEAI salt in isopropanol at an optimized concentration of 4 mg mL−1.34 The HTL dispersion was formed as reported in our previous work.22
2.2 Solar cell fabrication
Ultra-sonication in soap, ethanol, and 2-propanol for 15 min each was used to clean F-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates (7 ohms sq-1, Pilkington), which were then dried under Ar-flow and stored at 100 °C for roughly 12 hours. Following this regular cleaning technique, the glasses were subjected to 40 minute UV-ozone irradiation to eliminate any contamination and enhance the wettability of the FTO surface. Then, the FTO glasses are placed on a hotplate and rapidly preheated to 400 °C for 30 minutes. The substrates were kept at 400 °C for 15 minutes before the spray pyrolysis technique was used to deposit a 40 nm thick b-TiO2 film. After spraying, the FTO substrates were kept at 450 °C for 20 minutes before being gradually cooled to room temperature.35 Then, 120 nm thick ms-TiO2 was spin-coated over FTO/b-TiO2 at 4000 rpm for 30 seconds, and the layer was dried at 110 °C for a few minutes, followed by sintering over a hotplate at 450 °C for 40 minutes. The hotplate was turned off to cool down to 120 °C, and the hot films were immediately transferred into an N2-filled glovebox. The perovskite precursor solution was deposited onto ms-TiO2 using a green anti-solvent spin-coating technique in a N2-filled glovebox, first at 1500 rpm for 15 seconds and subsequently at 4000 rpm for 45 seconds. After 25 seconds of spinning, 400 μL of ethyl acetate (EA) was dropped onto the substrate in the second step. The film was then heated at 110 °C on a hotplate for 50 minutes.36 To fabricate 2D/3D bi-layers, FPEAI solution was deposited by spin-coating at 5000 rpm for 25 s, and then annealing at 100 °C for 10 minutes. After that, 60 μL of the HTL solution was quickly poured into the center of the substrate while it was spun at 4000 rpm in order to deposit the Spiro-OMeTAD film on top of the 2D/3D perovskite. After pouring Spiro-OMeTAD, the film is left spinning for 30 seconds inside the N2-filled glovebox. Subsequently, the metal electrodes, which were made of 80 nm thick gold (Au) as the electrodes, were deposited through shadow masks at a pressure of 3 × 10−5 mbar. The evaporation mask employed in this study was made up of brass pieces with an active area of 0.1 cm2. The evaporation rate was tuned at 2 Å s−1 for Au electrodes.
2.3 Characterization
Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) visualization of perovskites was performed using a TESCAN-MIRA3 system installed with a typical field emission gun source. The electron beam acceleration was set to be 5 KV and an in-lens detector was used for image generation. The topography of perovskites was characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM, Digital Instruments Nanoscope III) in the tapping mode. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) profiles of films were investigated using a Bruker AXS-D8 diffractometer using CuKα excitation. The optical absorption of films was monitored with a UV-vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer Lambda 950). The energy bandgap (Eg) of perovskites was calculated from Tauc plotting between (αhν)2 and the energy of a photon (hν):37,38αhν = K(hν − Eg)½
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) analysis was performed using an Oceanoptics HR4000 spectrometer. The top sides of the PL films (perovskite surface) were excited with an LED emitter (λ = 365 nm), and the PL spectrum was obtained in the reflection mode using an optical cable attached to a software system. At an excitation wavelength of 532 nm, time-resolved PL (TRPL) spectra were recorded utilizing self-assembled apparatus configured with a Nd:YAG laser, a monochromator (SP2150, Princeton), a PMT (H10721-20), and an oscilloscope (DSO-X3054A, Agilent). The obtained data are fitted with the bi-exponential decay formula:39
The space-charge-limited current (SCLC) measurements were carried out to evaluate the trap density and voltage of the trap filled limit (VTFL) of electron-only devices with the FTO/b-TiO2/ms-TiO2/perovskite/FPEAI/PCBM/Au framework.  where e is the electron charge and ε, ε0, and L denote the perovskite permittivity, the vacuum permittivity, and the thickness of the perovskite, respectively.40 The key photoelectric parameters of perovskite-based photovoltaics were characterized by J–V measurements inside a glovebox using a computer-controlled Keithley-2400 equipped with a 100 W xenon lamp. A monochromatic light beam was generated using a white illuminator associated with an Oriel Cornerstone monochromator (Power Meter Model 2936-C) and suitable order selecting filters for incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) tests. A NIST-calibrated silicon photodiode was used to calibrate the monochromatic light.
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a schematically shows the stacked structure of HPSCs used in this work. We used the mesoscopic HPSC architecture, which is made up of a substrate covered with FTO, a sprayed layer of b-TiO2, and a spin-coated layer of ms-TiO2. On top, the mixed cation perovskite-containing ethyl lactate was deposited by the spin-coating method. Then, EA was added to the perovskite drop by drop at the right time, allowing the perovskite film nucleation and crystallization. After appropriate heat treatment, the 2D capping layer was deposited by spin-coating FPEAI onto a 3D perovskite. Finally, the HPSC structure was completed with spin-coated Spiro-OMeTAD and deposited Au electrodes. From Fig. 1b, the cross-sectional FE-SEM image of a typical HPSC under optimized conditions exhibited smooth interfaces, which would promote the transfer of carriers in the perovskite harvester film. Fig. 1c shows the light J–V characteristics of the best-performing devices based on the mesoscopic architecture, in which the photo-absorber film is processed with different solvent concentrations. The pristine (control) HPSCs showed a JSC of 22.96 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.037 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 71.81%, and achieved a PCE of 17.09%. Interestingly, after processing the perovskite with a concentration of 3 mg mL−1 additive, the efficiency increased to 19.19%; and at 6 mg mL−1, the efficiency further improved to 21.78%. However, in the case of 9 mg mL−1 perovskite processing, the JSC reduced from 24.84 to 23.45 mA cm−2, Voc dropped from 1.069 to 1.019 V, and FF decreased from 82.03 to 73.52% (see Table 1). Fig. 1d shows the IPCE profiles of the best-performing HPSCs with and without solvent treatment. Similarly, to the light J–V trend in Fig. 1c, this one shows that devices made with the ethyl lactate process have higher quantum efficiency than those made without a solvent additive. It is worth noting that the integrated JSC values measured from the IPCE results were 22.84 and 24.46 mA cm−1. All photovoltaic characteristics were improved in the solvent processed cells compared to the control cells. The decreased trapping state and suppressed recombination in the modified cells are responsible for the improved Voc seen in these cells. Reduced charge recombination, blocked direct shunting, and suppressed PbI2 surplus all contribute to the formation of high-quality 2D/3D perovskite, which in turn results in higher JSC and FF values of the modified cells.41

Moreover, the hysteresis index (HI (%) = ((PCEreverse − PCEforward)/PCEreverse) × 100%) of HPSCs was calculated from J–V measurements in reverse and forward scans.42 As shown in Fig. 1e–f, it was observed that the HI value of modified HPSCs decreased to 0.7% from 17.2% for the control HPSCs. The decreased HI in modified HPSCs may be a result of the boundary passivation of the perovskite, which inhibits recombination and promotes charge transfer kinetics at the perovskite/HTL.43,44 For convenience, Fig. 1g–j shows a summary and comparison of the statistical distributions of photovoltaic parameters that correspond to 2D/3D bi-layered HPSCs. For 10 devices with 2D/3D mixed perovskites, improved JSC, Voc, FF, and PCE values were observed, demonstrating the significance of the solvent treatment in passivating defects and boosting the photovoltaic performance. The measured photovoltaic parameters exhibiting acceptable reliability and reproducibility are summarized in Table 1.
After elucidating the impact of ethyl lactate on the perovskite precursor, the morphology of the resultant perovskite films treated with or without ethyl lactate was examined by FE-SEM and AFM. Fig. 2a and b depict the top-view FE-SEM images of the perovskite thin-film. As predicted from the anti-solvent solution-deposition technique, the pristine perovskite displayed relatively small crystals with apparent pinholes and grain boundaries (Fig. 2a), as shown in the top-view FE-SEM images. As discussed before, these gaps and grain boundaries can induce nonradiative recombination sites and shunting pathways, resulting in energy loss and a decrease in photovoltaic efficiency.45,46 The morphology of the solution-processed perovskite film was clearly enhanced by the incorporation of ethyl lactate, becoming more uniform and homogeneous with larger grains and no defects (Fig. 2b). As presented in Fig. 2c and d, the average grain size of the perovskite film was increased from 320 nm to 365 nm after being processed with ethyl lactate. This indicates that ethyl lactate can modulate the film crystallization process and dynamics to achieve a compact and pinhole-free layer by stimulating the formation of larger perovskite crystals and minimizing gaps between perovskite boundaries. According to Fig. 2e and f, the AFM measurements showed that the untreated film was rough (RMS = 27.61 nm), which is consistent with the published reports of roughness for a one-step deposition perovskite layer.47 In turn, the film deposited from an ethyl lactate-based solution showed superior surface coverage and decreased roughness (RMS = 19.49 nm). This is concurrent with the perovskite crystallizing more slowly and under controlled process thanks to the excess ethyl lactate during the heat treatment.

Peaks denoted with a star and dot originate from PbI2 and TiO2, respectively. 
Due to the distinctive bandgap absorption of perovskite as a photon harvester, the UV-vis absorbance spectra were collected for perovskite layers with and without a solvent additive and exhibited extremely comparable absorption patterns, as displayed in Fig. 2g. As compared to the control perovskite, the film formed with the solvent additive shows significantly higher absorbance over the whole area below 760 nm. Furthermore, both films had nearly identical absorption onsets (around 805 nm), indicating that the solvent tailoring had no effect on the bandgap (Eg) of the perovskites. The absorption pattern can be utilized to determine the relationship between (αhv)2 and photo energy (hv), which is shown graphically in Fig. 2h. Based on the Kubelka–Munk formula, the perovskite's Eg value is 1.54 eV, which is consistent with the previously measured value.48,49Fig. 2i shows the XRD profiles of multi-dimensional 2D/3D perovskites deposited onto ms-TiO2/b-TiO2/FTO. As indicated, the peak positions of both films were similar. This shows that the crystal structures of perovskite are the same in size and that the phase composition of the two films is comparable. Remarkably, the relative intensity of the 2θ = 14.02° peak is stronger in the modified film. This is representative of preferred growth in the (001) plane and can explain the better defined morphology of surface crystals shown in the ethyl lactate-engineered film.50 Besides, the suppression of excess PbI2 (2θ = 12.43°) implies that the normal solvent engineering technique resulted in full conversion to perovskite without any further degradation.40 By using FPEAI as a coating for the 3D perovskite, the XRD pattern showed noticeable reflexes at 2θ = 7.21°, which is in line with the key characteristic peak of 2D perovskite.51
The PL patterns are shown in Fig. 3a for both solvent-added and additive-free perovskite films. Both with and without the addition of a solvent, the films exhibited a characteristic luminescence response. There was a noticeable increase in the intensity of the PL peak of the film after solvent treatment, which could have been due to the enhanced crystallinity of the developed film. The enhanced crystallinity of the perovskite film decreased the overall defect level, which in turn reduced the number of electron traps in the film and blocked the non-radiative recombination channel, which would be beneficial for its application in the development of optoelectronic devices.52 The TRPL patterns of the as-prepared perovskites in Fig. 3b reveal the carrier transportation and recombination dynamics in the films. It was observed that the photoluminescence decay of the untreated perovskite film was dramatically faster than that of the solvent-treated film. Table 2 displays the obtained lifetimes from the bi-exponential decay formula. Longer electron lifetimes in the perovskite layer were attained after ethyl lactate was incorporated. The lifetimes associated with the recombination of free carriers in solvent-added and pure perovskites were determined to be 122.9 and 54.6 ns, respectively. Clearly, the 2-fold longer carrier longevity in the modified film suggests a reduced trapped state in the ethyl lactate-treated perovskite layer. Recombination of electrons occurred less often when electrons were moving through a film with few grain boundaries and crystal defects. As a result, electrons could be transferred effectively, which would be favorable for achieving remarkable performance.13,53

Fig. 3c displays the Nyquist curves of the dark-measured HPSCs with and without solvent treatment. The obtained EIS plots can be fitted well by utilizing an equivalent circuit model adapted to HPSCs (inset of Fig. 3c). Table 3 shows a summary of the results of fitting the experimental results: the inner series resistance (Rs), the charge transport resistance (Rtr), and the recombination resistance (Rrec). Treatments with ethyl lactate clearly increase Rrec when compared to the untreated HPSCs, while decreasing the Rtr values. A significant decrease in trap-assisted recombination in this ethyl lactate-engineered device is likely the result of its dual roles, which eliminate surplus PbI2 and simultaneously passivate surface defects.54 According to our findings, trap-assisted recombination could be alleviated by the elimination of unwanted PbI2 alone. In fact, such PbI2 residuals may impede charge transfer at that interface owing to the generation of charge transport barriers,55 and recent studies56,57 have even proposed that PbI2-terminated perovskites are recombination sites. As a result, decreasing the recombination processes and promoting the charge transport to the HTL can be achieved by removing the excessive PbI2. A lower Rtr value, a more efficient interfacial contact between the perovskite and the transport layers, suggests that solvent treatment can efficiently decrease the Rtr and facilitate charge transfer, leading to an increase in JSC.58

The trap state density of the perovskite light harvester was evaluated from the SLSC measurements of the electron-only cells with a framework of FTO/ETL/perovskite/FPEAI/PCBM/Au. As presented in Fig. 3d and e, at a lower bias voltage, the straight part of the graph indicates ohmic contact. When the bias voltage is increased beyond a certain point, a kink point appears, and the current increases nonlinearly from there. The kink point represents the completely filled trap state. It can be seen that the control device and the solvent-engineered device possess VTFL values of 0.96 and 0.81 V, respectively. Thus, the associated Nt values are 2.67 × 1016 cm−3 and 8.02 × 1015 cm−3. The reduced Nt value confirms the higher quality of perovskite film with a lower density of electron trapping. This also accounts for the HPSC's reduced hysteresis.59Fig. 3e shows the dark J–V profiles of the devices with and without ethyl lactate. The fact that the device with solvent engineering has a reduced dark current density in the reverse bias area than the untreated device is an indication that the leakage current is decreased by the inclusion of ethyl lactate, which results from enhanced photocarrier transport and reduced charge recombination rates.
To provide evidence for the mechanism of possible interactions between the solvent additive and perovskite, FTIR analysis was performed for pure and solvent-engineered perovskite layers collected immediately after spin-coating the corresponding solutions onto FTO-covered glasses without annealing. From Fig. 4a, the patterns exhibit similar characteristics, with the main peaks corresponding to the N–H stretching associated with the organic cations (3000–3250 cm−1), whereas the characteristic peaks at 1700–1400 cm−1 can be attributed to the symmetric and asymmetric bending N–H bonds. Other peaks, such as C–N stretching and rocking modes, can be recognized.60 Moreover, in the case of the solvent-added film, all bands related to the N–H bending and C–N stretching/rocking types ended up being pushed to a higher spectral range. The obtained changes obviously demonstrate that the additive has an interaction with the perovskite precursors since the two films were deposited and processed under the same conditions. The formation of hydrogen bonds between the organic cation in the perovskite and the O–H agent in ethyl lactate, which may result in the generation of an organic cation-additive complex, provides a more precise explanation for this alteration. As a result, the inclusion of cations in the crystal lattice would be reduced or delayed, changing the IR spectra visibly.61 In a previous report, additives containing OH groups have been shown to delay crystallization and increase crystallinity and grain size in perovskite films by similar methods of selective complexation of the organic cations.62

(b) Representation of the roles played by ethyl lactate in the development of the perovskite layer. 
In order to ensure the high purity of the perovskite, ethyl lactate is presumed to be fully eliminated from the sample by evaporation at the end of the thermal treatment step because its boiling point (151 °C) is comparable to those of other processing solvents generally utilized in HPSC preparation (e.g. DMSO and DMF). It is believed that the remaining ethyl lactate can help control the dissolution and crystallisation mechanisms during the annealing process, delaying the nucleation rate and facilitating the formation of better crystals because it can be maintained in the film due to its boiling point being very close to the DMF solvent. The enhanced crystallization may potentially be the result of chemical interactions between the solvent additive's OH groups and the organic cations in the perovskite (see Fig. 4b). It is widely known that additive-induced forces, such as hydrogen bonds, between the anions and cations of the perovskite precursor, play a significant part in the production of highly orientated crystals.63
For photovoltaic technology, the operational stability of the HPSCs is just as important as the device performance. First, we checked the long-term stability of both (non-encapsulated) devices upon storage in the dark with different moisture levels (30% to 70%), as shown in Fig. 5a. After 20 days, the solvent-engineered HPSCs displayed significantly improved resistance to moisture with almost no performance deterioration. In contrast to the cell based on untreated perovskite, the moisture stability of solvent-engineered HPSCs under 50% RH demonstrates a favorable tendency for excellent stability. After 40 days, the ethyl lactate-based devices still had their original PCE, but the PCE of the control cells gradually dropped to 82%. Additionally, with a high RH of 70%, accelerated aging monitoring was made possible using the unencapsulated devices. The engineered devices have noticeable stability throughout the test time, and they still operate at 92% of their initial PCE after 60 days, as opposed to the control cells, whose PCE sharply declined to 71% under the same conditions. The addition of ethyl lactate can enhance the film's quality and stabilize the perovskite structure under environmental conditions, leading to HPSCs that are stable over the long term. As reported by the researchers,64–66 GBs and pinholes in a perovskite layer play a critical role in the stability of HPSCs. A perovskite starts its decomposition in the moisture environment from the surface and then, through GBs and voids, diffuses into the whole perovskite. In our study, ethyl lactate significantly passivates the perovskite's GBs and pinholes (See Fig. 2a and b), hindering the moisture from penetrating into the device structure. We also investigated the photostability of the encapsulated cells while they were continuously illuminated at room temperature with simulated sunlight. When compared to the control HPSCs, the treated HPSCs showed much slower performance deterioration. After 70 hours of illumination, the engineered HPSCs maintained 93% of their original PCE, but the control HPSCs sustained only 80% of their initial performance (Fig. 5b).

The PCE of the cells was periodically recorded under simulated sunlight at ambient temperature. (b) The light-stability of sealed HPSCs measured under constant AM 1.5G illumination using MPP tracking in a N2-filled glovebox and devices were examined every 5 h for the duration. XRD profiles of fresh and ambient-aged (7, 15, and 30 days) perovskite in the dark with a RH of 30%. (c) Control perovskite film and (d) ethyl lactate-processed perovskite film deposited on an FTO substrate. 
The crystallinity stability of the perovskite film was evaluated using XRD. Fig. 5c and d shows that after 30 days, the PbI2 peak (*) intensity increased gradually in the control perovskite. The XRD profiles of the modified film showed that decomposition associated with the degradation of the crystalline perovskite phase into PbI2 did not exist for the ethyl lactate-processed perovskite film. When ethyl lactate was incorporated into the perovskite solution, the film's stability increased substantially; after 30 days, there was no significant degradation.
The achieved data clearly reveal that green additive engineering with ethyl lactate not only enhances the efficiency of the HPSC but also improves its stability. In particular, the improvement in HPSC performance is among the best yielded PCE in comparison with the state-of-the-art HPSCs based on EA anti-solvent treatment (see Table 4).

4. Conclusion
Herein, biodegradable, eco-friendly ethyl lactate was successfully used as a solvent modifier in the preparation of efficient mesoscopic HPSCs. This work shows the several functions of ethyl lactate in enhancing the photovoltaic properties and long-term stability of 2D/3D HPSCs containing triple cations. Ethyl lactate provides a better intermediate perovskite phase to delay the crystallization rate of perovskite crystals and can act as a growth-regulating agent to develop large-sized perovskite grains with fewer defect states. With the development of a stable and high-quality multidimensional perovskite, both structural and electronic characteristics were improved. The perovskite layer treated with this green solvent displayed increased PL features and improved charge transfer. As a consequence, we obtained a 21.78% cell performance with negligible hysteresis. Also, the HPSC based on ethyl lactate also showed a high level of long-term moisture stability. After 60 days of storage, the performance of the ethyl lactate-based device was much more stable than that based on untreated perovskite. Our results suggest that more regulated perovskite microstructures could be developed in order to systematically tackle both charge kinetics and degradation processes in accordance with the timely commercialization of perovskite optoelectronics.
