It is revealed that S-shaped current–voltage characters are generated due to the mismatch between the generation and transportation of photo-carriers, which can be eliminated by tuning the light intensity and CNT coverage on the Si surface, with the power conversion efficiency enhanced up to 121%.
The transportation of photo-carriers across the carbon nanotubes and silicon (CNT/Si) interface plays a critical role in CNT/Si based solar cells1–8 and photodetectors.9,10 To date, the p–n junction,2 heterojunction,7 Schottky junction (MS)6 and MIS junction8 models have been extensively developed to understand the transport behaviors of photo-carriers across the interface. Physically, the diode model can be used to interpret the transport characters of the CNT/Si interface under dark conditions. As illuminated, the photo-carriers are generated in Si, dissociated with the help of the built-in electric field, and then transported across the CNT/Si interface. Normally, the current–voltage (I–V) character of such an illuminated interface is a shift of the I–V character under dark conditions. However, the illuminated CNT/Si interface usually exhibits an S-shaped I–V character with degraded power conversion efficiency (Fig. 1b), which has been widely observed in recent related publications.1,3,11,12 The S-shaped I–V characters have been intensively studied in organic solar cells,13,14 where the interface dipole, reduced surface recombination are considered to be the main sources. For the CNT/Si based solar cells, Wadhwa et al.11 used an ionic liquid gate to reversibly generate and eliminate the S-shaped I–V characters, and claimed that the liquid gate modulated interface dipole within the CNT/Si interface should account for the S-shaped I–V characters. However, the ionic liquid gate is directly in contact with the Si surface, thus a pure CNT/Si interface should be adopted to study the transport behaviors of photo-carriers across the CNT/Si interface.

In this work, we investigated the transport of photo-carriers across the CNT/Si interface by using a pure CNT film directly drawn from the spinnable CNT array. By systematically decreasing (increasing) the light intensity and increasing (decreasing) the CNT coverage on the Si surface, the S-shaped I–V characters could be reversibly eliminated and generated, and up to 121% power conversion efficiency increment could be obtained if the generation and transportation of photo-carriers are finely matched. A phenomenological model was proposed that as the generation of photo-carriers in Si exceeded the transportation of the CNT/Si interface, the photo-carrier recombination would occur in the space charge region, which then led to the S-shaped transport characters.
Our experiments were conducted with the pure CNT film drawn from the spinnable CNT array (Fig. S1†),6 which is more appropriate than the solution processed CNT film15 due to inevitable contaminants during the fabrication procedure. Fig. 1a shows the CNT/Si interface structure with silver (Ag) and GaIn electrodes, both of which have ohmic contact with CNTs and Si, respectively. The CNTs are aligned in the form of bundles, with submicron interval at distance, and aligned in the drawing direction (Fig. S2a†),6 the film thus exhibits anisotropy conductivity in different direction (Fig. S2b†). The devices are then fabricated with a 1.3 mm (parallel) × 10 mm (vertical) area with the CNT film embedded in the Ag electrode, the fabrication process is described in detail elsewhere.16 Thermal gravimetric (TG) analysis indicates that the CNTs are free from catalysts (Fig. S3a†), and the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image shows that the CNTs are double-walled with diameter 5 nm (Fig. S3b†).

Fig. 2(a–e) show the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of 1 to 5 layer aligned CNT sheets on a Si substrate, respectively. As one layer CNT sheet was applied to the Si surface, the Si surface could not be fully covered (Fig. 2a). The coverage ratio was increased when more layer CNT sheets were applied (Fig. 2b–e). Fig. 2f reveals that the transmittance was linearly decreased from 88% to 55% as 1–5 layers CNT sheet were applied, and the series resistance (Rs) of the CNT/Si structure was also found to decrease but in a parabolic manner due to the overlapped CNT bundles. The decreased light transmittance and increased CNT coverage enable less generation of photo-carriers in Si and better transportation of photo-carriers across the CNT/Si interface, respectively. The photo-carrier generation rate follows: G = αN0e−αx(1)where N0 is the photon flux at the surface, α is the absorption coefficient, and x is the distance into the material. Eqn (1) clearly shows that the generation of photo-carriers is proportional to the light intensity and the highest generation occurs at the Si surface (CNT/Si interface).
 Fig. 2  (a–e) SEM images show the effect of 1–5 layers of CNT sheet on surface coverage on a Si substrate, respectively. (f) Variation of the transmittance (at 550 nm) and Rs of the CNT film with the sheet layers. 
To understand the transport of photo-carriers across the CNT/Si interface, generation and transportation of photo-carriers have been systematically tuned by controlling the light intensity and CNT coverage on the Si surface, respectively. First, the generation of photo-carriers was reduced by decreasing the light intensity from 100 mW cm−2 to 0.6 mW cm−2 for two layer CNT/Si cells (Fig. 3a), the second derivative curves of current to voltage (d2I/dV2) are plotted in Fig. 3c to elucidate the effect of light intensity variation, and the cell parameters extracted from each curve in Fig. 3a are listed in Table 1. Fig. 3a shows a dramatic, reversible and steady evolution behavior of the transport characters with decreased light intensity. At the light intensity of the 100 mW cm−2 condition, photo-carriers transporting across the CNT/Si interface exhibited a typical S-shaped character. As the light intensity was decreased, the S-shaped character was gradually weakened and finally eliminated at the light intensity of the 0.6 mW cm−2 condition, which is clearly indicated by a gradually disappeared peak in the d2I/dV2 curves (Fig. 3c). For the two layer CNT/Si based cells, high generation of photo-carriers in Si led to the S-shaped characters while low generation did not.

Normally, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a crystal Si solar cell would decrease as light intensity decreases. However, the PCE of such a CNT/Si based cell was steadily increased from 5.31% to 6.70% as light intensity was decreased from 100 mW cm2 to 9.33 mW cm−2. However, at the light intensity of 0.6 mW cm−2, the PCE was decreased to 5.68%, which should be ascribed to the relative low shunt resistance.17Table 1 shows that the maximum effect contributed by the gradually eliminated S-shaped characters is the fill factor (FF) of cells, which was dramatically increased from 44.7% to 61.6%.

Fig. 3b shows the evolution of the transport characters of 1–5 layer CNT/Si based cells under the fixed light intensity of 100 mW cm−2, the d2I/dV2 curves are plotted in Fig. 3d to elucidate the effect of CNT coverage on the Si surface, and the cell parameters extracted from Fig. 3b are reported in Table 2. Fig. 3b shows that as more layers CNT sheet were applied, the transport characters of photo-carriers varied in a different manner. This can be clearly observed in Fig. 3d, where the peak, marked by a dashed line, was shifted to larger voltage as more layers CNT sheet were introduced, and finally disappeared at the 5 layer CNT sheet. In comparison, the peak in Fig. 3c maintained at the same voltage during the light intensity variation process. Meanwhile, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of such a cell was increased from 0.38 V to 0.49 V as more layers CNT sheet were introduced (Table 2). Normally, the decreased light intensity, due to more layers CNT sheet were applied, would lead to decreased Voc. However, in our system, the transmittance was decreased from 88% to 55%, but the Voc was increased from 0.38 V to 0.49 V, which could be ascribed to the depressed photo-carrier recombination. Here, the FF was greatly increased from 28.5% to 69.1% as the S-shaped transport characters were eliminated, and then the PCE was increased from 3.14% to 6.94%, about 121% increment. For the 100 mW cm−2 illuminated condition, better CNT coverage on Si surface could completely remove the S-shaped characters.

From the above results, it can be found that for specific CNT layer sheet (two layers), the S-shaped transport characters could be eliminated when the light intensity was decreased to a threshold value (0.6 mW cm−2). Moreover, for a specific light intensity (100 mW cm−2), the S-shaped transport characters could also be eliminated when the CNT layers were increased to a threshold value (5 layers). We then studied the threshold light intensity for 1 to 4 layer CNT/Si based cells and plotted the results in Fig. 4. It can be seen that as more layers of CNT sheets were applied, the threshold light intensity was also increased, exhibiting a variation manner similar to the Rs variation shown in Fig. 2f.

Generation of photo-carriers in Si and their transportation across the CNT/Si interface is critical for high performance CNT/Si based cells or photodetectors. The CNT/Si interface, consisting of thousands of tiny nano junctions, sometimes is not appropriate to balance the generation and transportation of photo-carriers, especially when a single one layer CNT sheet was applied, where the CNT coverage on the Si surface is poor. Actually, the S-shaped transport characters were also observed in a single one layer or two layer graphene/Si based cell, when more layers of graphene sheets were applied, the S-shaped transport characters could also be eliminated, and the PCE of the graphene/Si based cells could be increased.18
The characterization of CNT/Si based cells is usually conducted at the 100 mW cm−2 condition (AM 1.5G), and the largest generation of photo-carriers occurs at the Si surface (CNT/Si interface), thus the effective transportation of photo-carriers is critical for high performance CNT/Si based cells. To explain the observed transport characters in different layers CNT/Si based cells, a phenomenological model was proposed (Fig. 5). At one layer CNT/Si based cells, the CNT coverage on the Si surface was poor, the transportation of photo-carriers could be hindered due to fewer transport paths, which led to carrier recombination, and then the S-shaped transport characters were generated. In comparison, as five layer CNT sheets were applied, photo-carries generated in Si could effectively transport across the CNT/Si interface, thus the carrier recombination was depressed and the S-shaped characters were eliminated.

Conclusions
In summary, pure CNT film drawn from the spinnable CNT array has been used to study the transport characters of photo-carriers across the CNT/Si interface. The mismatch between the generation of photo-carriers in Si and the transportation across the CNT/Si interface led to the S-shaped characters, the low CNT coverage on the Si surface and poor conductivity of CNTs are the main sources for the limited transportation capability. The performance of the CNT/Si based solar cell was largely improved when the S-shaped transport characters were eliminated by decreasing the light intensity or increasing the CNT coverage. Our findings bring to light new design considerations for nano-junction based hybrid solar cells for energy harvesting.
