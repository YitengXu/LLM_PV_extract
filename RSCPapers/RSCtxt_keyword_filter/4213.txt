Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are receiving widespread attention as a promising power device compared to the conventional silicon solar cells, due to their low production cost and relatively high conversion efficiency. The highest conversion efficiency of 12.3% has been reported for a DSC under AM 1.5G simulated sunlight.1 One area of DSC research has been focused on the development of flexible DSCs in which the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrates are replaced with Ti foils and conducting polymeric substrates, such as ITO-coated polyethylene terephthalate (ITO/PET) and polyethylene naphthalate (ITO/PEN) substrates. In particular, ITO/PET is commonly used as the flexible substrate for the DSCs, due to low cost, lightweight, suitability for roll-to-roll processes, and high-throughput for industrial mass production, compared to the normally used FTO-coated glass.2,3 However, one of the problems with the plastic substrates is that they can not withstand sintering treatment above 150 °C, leading to a lower efficiency.
Generally, a platinum film is employed as a counter electrode for the DSCs to catalyze the reduction (I3− to I−) of redox electrolyte to keep the low overvoltage at a reasonable photocurrent density, where the Pt layer acts as an electrocatalyst. So far, the most popular plastic Pt counter electrodes have been prepared through sputtering.4Sputtering can produce Pt catalysts with good adhesion to the substrates and high catalysis capacity, but requires an ultrahigh vacuum environment and wastes source materials during deposition. In addition, a large portion of such deposited Pt is located inside the film and does not fully perform its catalytic function, thus representing a waste of material.5 The high price of Pt and the high cost of magnetron sputtering technology undoubtedly limit its application for large-scale production of DSCs. Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop other materials for counter electrodes on conducting polymeric substrates.
With regard to the flexible DSCs, one of the key processes is the preparation of plastic counter electrodes at low temperature with low cost. It has been revealed that inexpensive carbon materials and organic conducting polymers are inert to the iodine-containing electrolyte and have been introduced as counter electrodes to replace platinum in the DSCs and related systems.6–8 However, carbon materials usually require thick porous films to obtain an acceptable catalytic effect, and the mechanical stability is still a matter of concern.6 To reduce the thickness and enhance the electrocatalytic activity, some Pt-based composites have been studied to be used as counter electrodes, such as Pt/graphene, Pt/carbon nanotubes, and Pt/acetylene black, and showed superior conversion efficiencies.9–11 However, there are few reports on composite counter electrodes composed of conducting polymers and Pt. Among various conducting polymers, polyaniline (PANI) as a classic conducting polymer is one of the most extensively studied conducting polymers due to its easy synthesis, high conductivity, good environmental stability, and interesting redox catalytic properties.12 On the one hand, it is reported that pristine PANI shows high photovoltaic conversion efficiencies.13–15 On the other hand, recent advances have shown that electronic conducting polymers can serves as porous supports to disperse the platinum catalyst, due to their excellent properties.16PANI is of particular interest due to the fact that its conductivity is controlled by both the redox state and the degree of protonation, both of which factors may be affected by the medium.12Platinum dispersion inside such a support, which leads to a decrease in the amount of noble metal used, allows improvement of the catalytic activity.16 Furthermore, optical transparency is an important benefit of DSCs for certain practical applications, like windows, roof panels, or various decorative installations. A transparent counter electrode is essential for the operation of plastic DSCs and for tandem solar cells.17 It is known that the spin-coating process can produce thin films. Therefore, it is envisaged that the spin-coated PANI films with well distributed Pt nanoparticles in them should be able to provide good conductivity as well as reasonable electro-catalytic activity for use as suitable transparent counter electrodes in DSCs.
In this work, a Pt/PANI composite film on a plastic ITO/PET substrate is fabricated by a simple spin-coating process and is used as a novel counter electrode for highly efficient flexible DSCs. As polyaniline can act as a reducing agent, it can react with K2PtCl4 spontaneously and the resulting Pt nanoparticles with a size of 1.5 nm are homogeneously dispersed in the PANI support without the need for stabilizers. The flexible DSC based on the Pt/PANI composite electrode shows higher efficiencies of 5.4% and 4.0% than that of the conventional sputtered Pt-based DSC under front and rear illumination measured at AM 1.5G simulated irradiation (100 mW cm−2).
The Pt/PANI composite film on the ITO/PET substrate was obtained by a spin-coating method from the Pt/PANI solution, which was fabricated by mixing a formic acid solution of PANI emeraldine base (EB, half-oxidised form) (1 wt%) and a formic acid solution of K2PtCl4 (10 mM) in equal volumes [see ESI†].18 The in situPt formation is driven by the reduction of K2PtCl4 with PANI polymer in the acidic media solution. In the spontaneous reaction, the PANI (ES, half-oxidised, protonated form) and K2PtCl4 act as an electron donor and an electron acceptor respectively, leading to the oxidation of PANI (ES) to the pernigraniline form and the reduction of K2PtCl4 to metallic Pt. In the meantime, the pernigraniline form can be reduced back to the ES form by formic acid, which further promotes the reduction of the Pt complex to metallic Pt. Furthermore, the resulting green solution demonstrates the ES form, indicating high conductivity. For comparisons of photoelectric properties of the Pt/PANI film, pristine PANI and Pt films are obtained by spin-coating and sputtering, respectively.

Fig. 1 shows the surface morphology and thickness of the Pt/PANI film on the ITO/PET substrate. As seen in Fig. 1(a), small Pt nanoparticles are homogeneously dispersed in the PANI matrix. To investigate the Pt size in detail, the high resolution transmission electronic microscope (HRTEM) image of the Pt/PANI is shown in Fig. 1(b). It is found that the Pt nanoparticles possess a narrow size distribution. The corresponding histogram for the size distribution, shown in Fig. 1(c), shows that these nanoparticles have an average size of 1.5 nm, which is much smaller than the sputtered Pt nanoparticles of a size of about 9 nm (see ESI, Fig. S1). Such nanosize can afford a high number density of catalytic sites.19 The EDS image in Fig. 1(d) demonstrates the existence of Pt nanoparticles. From the AFM observation of Fig. 1(e), the surface roughness factor of the obtained Pt/PANI film in Fig. 1(e) was 40 nm, which was enhanced in comparison with that of sputtered Pt (Ra = 35 nm) (see ESI, Fig. S2). The cross-sectional AFM image of Fig. 1(f) shows that the Pt/PANI film is uniform and the average thickness is determined to be about 25.1 nm. Therefore, it can be inferred from the surface morphology that the Pt/PANI film is expected to possess a high effective electrochemical surface area and large rough surface, which is crucial for high electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrodes.

To understand the electrocatalytic activity of the different electrodes, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammogram (CV) measurements were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 2(a,b). Two semicircles are observed in the measured frequency range 10−1–105 Hz for all devices in the Nyquist plots. It is known that the charge transfer resistance (Rct) (high-frequency semicircle) represents the catalytic performance for I3−reduction. After fitting EIS spectra, the Rct of the Pt/PANI electrode was found to be 1.12 Ω cm2, which is much lower than that of the pristine PANI electrode (3.51 Ω cm2). This indicates that Pt is still an important material because of its higher catalytic activity, compared to the conducting PANI electrode. Furthermore, the Pt/PANI electrode even has smaller Rct in comparison with the sputtered Pt electrode (1.83 Ω cm2), which is directly attributed to the formation of smaller Pt nanoparticles on the rough surface of PANI. The CV curves in Fig. 2(b) shows two well-defined reduction peaks and the corresponding oxidation peaks for each electrode. The second cathodic peak corresponds to the reaction: I3− + 2e− ⇌ 3I−, which takes place at the counter electrode of a DSC and is vital for its operation.20 Therefore, the magnitude of current density at such peak is directly proportional to the ability of the electrode to reduce the I3− species. It is conspicuously larger for the Pt/PANI composite electrodes compared to PANI and sputtered Pt, indicating a faster rate on the Pt/PANI electrode, in agreement with the EIS results. The above result indicates that the Pt/PANI film with a small grain particle size shows higher active surface area and it may exhibit much higher I3− ion electrochemical reduction ability. Therefore, the Pt/PANI composite electrode can be used as an efficient electrocatalytic counter electrode in DSCs.

Fig. 3(a) shows a schematic illustration of the DSC based on transparent Pt/PANI electrode irradiated through the front and rear sides. The J–V curves of the DSCs based on various counter electrodes of PANI, Pt/PANI, and sputtered Pt from the front and rear illuminations are demonstrated in Fig. 3(d) and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. It can be observed that the DSCs based on Pt/PANI with Pt loading of 1.1 μg cm−2 exhibit a relatively higher conversion efficiency of 5.4% than that of Pt-based DSCs with Pt loading of 6.8 μg cm−2. On the other hand, the DSCs based on the PANI electrode show a conversion efficiency of 3.1%, indicating the vitally superior catalytic role of Pt in the solar cell. Compared to the properties of the DSCs with sputtered Pt, the most pronounced change for the use of Pt/PANI is the fill factor (FF). This is mainly because the high specific surface area by depositing Pt nanoparticles in the PANI support provides them with high catalytic activity toward reduction of iodine.21 Furthermore, the Pt loading of the Pt/PANI is lower than that of the sputtered Pt electrode. This indicates that the highly dispersed Pt/PANI electrode with a low Pt loading provides the possibility of cost reduction in the DSCs manufacturing process. As the Pt/PANI film shows an excellent transparency range from 450 to 700 nm with a maximum transmittance of 70% at 480 nm (Fig. 3b), it is an important factor for the rear-side illumination of the flexible DSCs. When a word “NUS” is written on paper and is placed behind the Pt/PANI film, it can be observed that the word “NUS” appears clearly through the Pt/PANI film (Fig. 2c), due to the transparent nature of this composite film. When irradiated from the rear side, the DSC composed of such a Pt/PANI electrode exhibited an efficiency of 4.0%. This efficiency approaches 74% that of the front illumination and is a little higher than that of the Pt-based DSC under the same conditions. Compared to that from the front illumination, the lower efficiency from the rear illumination may be ascribed to the lower light intensity, which leads to the reduced Jsc and the corresponding FF. The reduced FF may be ascribed to the light reflection difference between the front and rear illumination. As the fabrication of DSCs is a multistage process, impurities or defects would act as recombination centers, which might increase the dark current so as to decrease the fill factor of the device. Furthermore, further study of the detailed relationships between the light intensity and the photoelectric properties of DSCs is under way.

In summary, we have developed a novel Pt/PANI counter electrode for high efficient flexible DSCs based on the ITO/PET substrate. With a spontaneous reaction of PANI with K2PtCl4 and then a simple spin-coating process, the resulting Pt nanoparticles with low Pt loading of 1.1 μg cm−2 and a size of 1.5 nm are dispersed homogeneously in the Pt/PANI film. CV and EIS analysis confirm the excellent catalytic activities of the obtained Pt/PANI composite, which is better that the conventional sputtered Pt electrode. Consequently, a much higher conversion efficiency of 5.4% under 1 sun illumination is achieved under the front illumination at AM 1.5 simulated irradiation (100 mW cm−2), which is higher than that of Pt-based DSCs. Due to the high transmittance, the Pt/PANI shows a conversion efficiency of 4.0% under the rear illumination, which approaches 74% that of the front illumination. Such high catalytic activity and transmittance intensity render the superior Pt/PANI counter electrode properties in DSCs. Therefore, the simple preparation at room temperature and the low Pt loading of the Pt/PANI counter electrodes may open up new avenues for flexible counter electrodes.
