    , Accepted 2nd May 2017First published on 5th May 2017AbstractTwo carbazole-substituted fullerene derivatives containing mono- and bi-C60 units, (9-butyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (Cz-C60) and (9-butyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-diyl)-bis(C61-butyric acid methyl ester) (Cz-2C60), were successfully synthesized and characterized by NMR, MS and FT-IR spectroscopy. The photophysical, electrochemical properties and thermal stabilities of the fullerene derivatives were systematically investigated. P3HT-based organic photovoltaic devices were fabricated using Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 as electron acceptors. The highest power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the devices fabricated with Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were 3.88 and 3.59%, respectively.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices (OPVS) have been considered as a promising and ideal alternative technique for producing inexpensive, clean and renewable energy sources because of their advantages such as low cost, light weight, good mechanical performance and flexibility, and the possibility of changing the chemical structure and fabricating effective devices in comparison with traditional inorganic semiconductor photovoltaics.1–3 Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells can increase efficient exciton dissociation in the donor–acceptor interfacial area, which have an active layer containing a p-type donor and an n-type acceptor to form an interpenetrating nanoscale network.4–6 In organic photovoltaic devices, the most-represented donor and acceptor materials were poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), respectively, and the BHJ solar cells based on P3HT/PC61BM showed a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 4–5% by solvent annealing and thermal annealing.7–9 However, due to the mismatch of the absorption spectra of the P3HT/PC61BM active layer with the solar spectrum and too big energy offset of the LUMO energy levels between the donor and the acceptor, the efficiency of the solar cells based on the P3HT/PC61BM system is difficult to further improve.
For increasing the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to developing new donor and acceptor materials for BHJ solar cells. For the donor materials, a variety of new donor materials possessing broader absorption, lower energy gap, higher hole mobility and suitable electronic energy levels have been developed. Among them, the representative donor materials include polythiophene derivatives,10,11 poly(thienylene vinylene) derivatives12,13 and the copolymers of benzodithiophene and thieno[3,4-b]thiophene.14,15 Equally important, the electron acceptors with excellent performance are essential to improving the power conversion of BHJ solar cells. The fullerene derivatives, such as [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), have been the most widely used electron acceptor materials in BHJ solar cells up to now due to their good solubility in aromatic solvents, strong electron accepting capability and excellent electron mobility.4,8,16–18 Recently, various new fullerene-based electron acceptors have been developed for use in BHJ solar cells, which include various PC61BM analogues with different ester alkyl chains19,20 or different aromatic groups,20–23 and indene-C60 or -C70 bisadduct (IC60BA or IC70BA).17,18,24 In addition, some non-fullerene-based organic small molecule electron acceptor materials have drawn much attention due to their many advantages such as the adjustable energy level, simple synthesis, excellent solubility and wide absorption in the visible spectrum for higher power conversion efficiency, including fluoranthene-fused imide derivatives,25,26 diketopyrrolopyrrole derivatives,27,28 benzothiadiazole derivatives,29,30 9,9′-bifluorenylidene (99′BF) derivatives,31,32etc.
In spite of the great achievement in electron acceptor materials, fullerene derivatives still occupy the main and important position in the electron acceptor materials in BHJ solar cells because of their high electron affinity and high mobility and remarkable properties in photoinduced electron transfer. Thus, it is worthwhile to develop new fullerene derivatives with good solubilities and higher LUMO energy levels and broader light-harvesting ability in comparison with PC61BM. In this paper, two new carbazole-substituted fullerene derivatives, (9-butyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (Cz-C60) and (9-butyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-diyl)-bis(C61-butyric acid methyl ester) (Cz-2C60), were successfully synthesized by reacting the tosylhydrazone derivatives with C60. The optical and electrochemical properties and thermal stabilities of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were investigated. Furthermore, the performance of photovoltaic devices using P3HT as the electron donor and Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 as the electron acceptors was also investigated. Compared to PC61BM, the introduction of an electron donating carbazole group could improve the LUMO energy level for modifying the Voc and for obtaining a better PCE. In addition, a bifunctional carbazole unit substituted in the 3- and 6-position can be grafted onto two C60 groups, and the prepared C60 derivative would increase the electron affinities and the electron mobility.
The synthetic routes of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 are shown in Scheme 1.

Results and discussion
It is well-known that the carbazole derivatives have excellent hole transporting ability, luminescence efficiency, thermal stability, versatile structural derivatization and unique ability to form amorphous films. Thus, the carbazole derivatives have been widely utilized as functional building blocks in the fabrication of organic photoconductors, non-linear optical materials, and photorefractive materials.

Scheme 1 illustrates the synthetic routes to the carbazole-substituted fullerene derivatives Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60. Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were all synthesized through the tosylhydrazone routes.33 9-Butyl-9H-carbazole was Friedel-crafts acylated to give methyl 5-(9-butyl-9H-carbazol-3-yl)-5-oxopentanoate (1) and dimethyl 5,5′-(9-butyl-9H-carbazole-3,6-diyl)bis(5-oxopentanoate) (2), which were subsequently transformed into carbazole tosylhydrazone derivatives 3 and 4. Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were synthesized by reacting the appropriate carbazole tosylhydrazone derivatives 3 and 4 with C60, in which three reaction procedures occurred. Firstly, the relatively unstable diazo compounds were produced in situ by the base-induced decomposition of tosylhydrazone derivatives (3 and 4), which were not necessarily purified prior to their addition to C60. Secondly, the diazo compounds were rapidly trapped by C60 to produce [5,6] isomers using the above one-pot reaction procedure. Finally, the conversion of [5,6] isomers to [6,6]-closed methanofullerenes (Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60) was accomplished by heating (at 180 °C).
Two new fullerene derivatives Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 showed good solubility in common organic solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform, toluene, chlorobenzene and 1,2-dichlorobenzene. The structures of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were characterized by using 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR and ESI-MS. In the 1H NMR spectra of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60, the two protons of –CH2– adjacent to the nitrogen atoms of the carbazole rings appear at 4.36 ppm and 4.42 ppm, respectively, as triplet peaks with a coupling constant of 6 Hz. The singlet proton peak of –OCH3 is observed at 3.64 ppm. In the ESI-MS spectra of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60, mass peaks corresponding to Cz-C60 (M+ = 1056.19) and Cz-2C60 (M+ = 1889.25) were observed. A strong characteristic absorption peak of C60 was found at around 526 cm−1 in the FT-IR spectra of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60. The specific absorption bands of 2956–2922 and 2857–2854 cm−1 were assigned to the stretching vibration of the –CH3 and –CH2–, respectively. The strong absorption band at 1732 cm−1 was attributed to the stretching vibrations of the ester carbonyl. The FT-IR spectra of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 exhibit medium-strong absorption bands at 1598 and 1491 (1490) cm−1 which are due to the aromatic CC stretching vibrations.

Fig. 1 shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 in toluene solutions (1 × 10−5 mol L−1). The absorption spectra of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were almost the same as that of PCBM, and there were four main absorption peaks at 261, 329, 430 and 493 nm. It was found that the absorption of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 was stronger than that of PCBM in all spectrum regions, and the absorption of Cz-2C60 was weaker than that of Cz-C60. Besides, a small peak approximately at 700 nm was observed in the absorption spectra of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60, which was assigned to the [6,6]-addition in C60.34 Two characteristic absorption peaks at 430 and 700 nm appeared in the absorption spectra of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60, suggested that 60 π electrons of C60 reduce to 58 π electrons.35

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out to investigate the electrochemical behavior of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60. Their HOMO energy levels were determined from the onset of the oxidation potentials of their cyclic voltammetry measurements, while their LUMO energy levels were deduced from their HOMO energy levels and optical band gaps determined from their extrapolated UV-vis absorption edges. We measured the cyclic voltammograms of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 in o-dichlorobenzene/chloroform (4:1, v/v) solution with Bu4NPF6 (0.1 mol L−1) as the electrolyte (Fig. 2). A platinum working electrode and a saturated Ag/AgCl reference electrode were used. Ferrocene was used for potential calibration. As shown in Fig. 2, the onset oxidation potentials of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were at ca. 1.26, 1.21 and 1.22 V versus Ag/Ag+, respectively. It indicates that the onset oxidation potentials of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 shift by −0.05 and −0.04 V as compared to PCBM. From the onset oxidation potentials, the HOMO energy levels of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were calculated according to the equation:36 HOMO = −e(Eox + 4.71), where Eox is the onset oxidation potential (V) versus Ag/Ag+. The HOMO energy levels of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were calculated to be −5.97, −5.92 and −5.93 eV, respectively. The optical band edges of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were estimated to be ca. 600 nm, which corresponds to 2.07 eV. Thus the LUMO energy levels of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 are calculated to be −3.90, −3.85 and −3.86 eV, respectively.

The thermal properties of PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were investigated by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere. The results of their TGA measurements are shown in Fig. 3. Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 displayed good thermal stability up to 350 °C, with increasing temperature, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 began to decompose at 386 °C accompanied by a sharp weight loss in their TGA curves. The TGA result of PCBM showed that PCBM was thermally stable up to 380 °C, and the thermal decomposition temperature was at about 390 °C. It is indicated that the thermal stability of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 was slightly lower than that of PCBM.

The bulk-heterojunction photovoltaic devices with the architecture of the ITO/PEDOT:PSS (40 nm)/P3HT:acceptor (1:x, w/w) (100 nm)/Ca (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) were fabricated by a solution-processable method, in which PCBM, Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were used as the acceptors and P3HT was used as the donor. The mixture solutions with different concentrations of the P3HT:acceptor (1:x, w/w) were used to fabricate the active layers (spin speed: 4000 rpm). For Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60, to determine the optimum device conditions, the blend ratios of donor to acceptor were chosen to be 1:0.4, 1:0.75 and 1:1, respectively.

Fig. 4 shows the J–V characteristics of the P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 devices under AM 1.5 G illumination with an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The performance of these devices is summarized in Table 1. As shown in Fig. 4, the devices fabricated from P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 showed the best results at the weight ratio of the donor to the acceptor of 1:0.75. It can be seen that the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 were 3.59% and 3.88%, respectively, while the reference device based on P3HT/PCBM exhibited the highest PCE of 3.71%. Under optimized conditions, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) values of the devices fabricated from P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 were 0.69 and 0.68 V, whereas the P3HT/PCBM device had a Voc of 0.64 V. The Voc values of the devices fabricated from P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 were slightly higher than that of the device based on P3HT/PCBM, which is attributed to the higher LUMO energy level of Cz-C60 (−3.85 V) and Cz-2C60 (−3.86 V) in contrast to PCBM (−3.90 V). The current density (Jsc) values of the P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 devices were 8.72 and 8.80 mA cm−2, respectively, which were notably lower than that of the P3HT/PCBM device (8.95 mA cm−2). Furthermore, although the Voc value of the P3HT/Cz-C60 device was slightly more than that of the P3HT/Cz-2C60 device, the Jsc value of the P3HT/Cz-C60 device was lower than that of the P3HT/Cz-2C60 device.

The P3HT/Cz-2C60 device showed a higher fill factor (FF) value (64.87%) than the P3HT/Cz-C60 device (59.66%), and it was even higher than that of the P3HT/PCBM device (64.69%). The difference in the FF values of the three devices could be explained by their measured shunt resistance (Rsh) and series resistance (Rs) values. The Rsh values of the devices fabricated from P3HT/Cz-C60, P3HT/Cz-2C60 and P3HT/PCBM were 679.40, 1281.71 and 1822.82 Ω cm2, respectively. The Rs value of the P3HT/Cz-2C60 device (7.93 Ω cm2) was smaller than that of the P3HT/Cz-C60 device (11.40 Ω cm2) and the P3HT/PCBM device (9.24 Ω cm2). The higher Rsh and lower Rs values caused the higher FF of the P3HT/Cz-2C60 device in contrast to the P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/PCBM devices.37

Fig. 5 shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 devices under optimized device conditions. The EQE values in the range of 400–650 nm are mainly due to the absorption by P3HT. The maximum EQEs of the P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 devices were 60.29% and 66.21% at 500 nm, respectively. The EQE value of the P3HT/Cz-2C60 device was higher than that of the P3HT/Cz-C60 device, which agreed well with the Jsc values obtained from their fabricated devices.
 Fig. 5  EQE curves of the devices based on P3HT/Cz-C60 and P3HT/Cz-2C60 with a weight ratio of 1:0.75. 
To evaluate the impact of film morphology on the device performance, the film morphologies of the P3HT:Cz-C60 (1:0.75, w/w) and P3HT:Cz-2C60 (1:0.75, w/w) blend films were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fig. 6 shows the AFM images of the films of these two photoactive layers after thermal annealing at 150 °C for 20 min. It can be seen that phase separations were observed in both photoactive layers and the P3HT:Cz-2C60 film was smoother than the P3HT:Cz-C60 film. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of the P3HT:Cz-C60 and the P3HT:Cz-2C60 films were 7.43 and 6.67 nm, respectively. The smoother morphology could lead to an increase in the D/A interfacial area, resulting in higher Jsc. This result was consistent with the observation that the Jsc value of the P3HT/Cz-C60 device was lower than that of the P3HT/Cz-2C60 device.

Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized two new carbazole-substituted fullerene derivatives containing mono- and di-fullerene moieties (Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60), and the photophysical and electrochemical properties and thermal stabilities of these fullerene derivatives were investigated. Their absorption spectra were similar to that of PCBM. The LUMO energy levels of Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were somewhat higher than that of PCBM. Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were used as electron acceptors, and the photovoltaic devices were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:acceptor (1:x, w/w)/Ca/Al. With a weight ratio of 1:0.75 between P3HT and the acceptor, the highest PCE values of the devices based on Cz-C60 and Cz-2C60 were 3.59% and 3.88%, respectively, compared to a value of 3.71% for PCBM. Compared to Cz-C60, the higher PCE value of the device based on Cz-2C60 likely resulted from its higher Jsc and FF due to its higher Rsh and lower Rs values. In addition, the phenyl ring in PCBM was substituted by the alkyl carbazole group in Cz-C60, and the larger alkyl carbazole substituent could increase the distance between the C60 balls and result in a decrease in the electron mobility. So the PCE value of the device based on Cz-C60 was lower than that of PCBM.
