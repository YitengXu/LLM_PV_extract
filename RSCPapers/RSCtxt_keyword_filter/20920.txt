    , Accepted 13th July 2007First published on 31st July 2007AbstractWe have constructed supramolecular solar cells composed of a series of porphyrin–peptide oligomers [porphyrin functionalized α-polypeptides, P(H2P)n or P(ZnP)n (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)], and fullerenes assembled on a nanostructured SnO2 electrode using an electrophoretic deposition method. Remarkable enhancement in the photoelectrochemical performance as well as the broader photoresponse in the visible and near-infrared regions is seen with increasing the number of porphyrin units in α-polypeptide structures. Formation of supramolecular clusters of porphyrins and fullerenes prepared in acetonitrile–toluene = 3 : 1 has been confirmed by transmission electron micrographs (TEM) and the absorption spectra. The highly colored composite clusters of porphyrin–peptide oligomers and fullerenes have been assembled as three-dimensional arrays onto nanostructured SnO2 films using an electrophoretic deposition method. A high power conversion efficiency (η) of ∼1.6% and the maximum incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE = 56%) were attained using composite clusters of free base and zinc porphyrin–peptide hexadecamers [P(H2P)16 and P(ZnP)16] with fullerenes, respectively. Femtosecond transient absorption and fluorescence measurements of porphyrin–fullerene composite films confirm improved electron-transfer properties with increasing number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit. The formation of molecular assemblies between porphyrins and fullerenes with a polypeptide structure controls the electron-transfer efficiency in the supramolecular complexes, meeting the criteria required for efficient light energy conversion.
Introduction
In recent years attention has been drawn to the development of inexpensive renewable energy sources. New approaches for the production of efficient and low-cost organic solar cells are necessary for future development of next generation devices.1–7 Progress is being made in the development of heterojunction organic solar cells, which possess an active layer of a conjugated donor polymer and an acceptor fullerenes. In these polymer blends, efficient photoinduced electron transfer occurs at the donor–acceptor interface, and intimate mixing of donor and acceptor is therefore beneficial for efficient charge separation.4–7 For efficient transport of the positive charge carriers through the donor phase and of electrons via the acceptor phase to the electrodes, a phase-segregated bicontinuous network is required.
One of the most promising strategies is the development of organic solar cells that mimic natural photosynthesis. In the natural photosynthetic system, the light-harvesting complexes are composed of chlorophylls (or bacteriochlorophylls) assembled in protein matrices that absorb light over a wide spectral range.8–10 The subsequent electron-transfer process in the reaction center is found to occur very rapidly from the special pair (BCh1 dimer) toward the quinones to produce the final charge-separated state which has a long lifetime (ca. 1 s) with nearly 100% quantum yield.11 Thus, light energy conversion of natural photosynthetic system based on supramolecular assembly in the protein matrix provides us with important information to construct artificial energy conversion systems.8a
The first candidate of such components is a porphyrin that is involved in a number of important biological electron transfer systems including the primary photochemical reactions of chlorophylls (porphyrin derivatives) in the photosynthetic reaction centers. Porphyrins contain an extensively conjugated two-dimensional π-system and thus are suitable for efficient electron transfer. The uptake or release of electrons results in minimal structural and solvation change upon electron transfer, resulting in a small reorganization energy of electron transfer.12 In addition, rich and extensive absorption features of porphyrinoid systems guarantee increased absorption cross-sections and an efficient use of the solar spectrum.13 The challenge of creating artificial mimics of these light-harvesting complexes has stimulated the development of routes to a diverse collection of multi-porphyrin arrays.14 In the natural system, bacteriochlorophylls are held by α-helical polypeptides.15 In this context, we have recently reported synthesis of porphyrin oligomers with polypeptidic backbones in which porphyrins are held in a favored spacing and orientation by fairly short helical polypeptides.16
With regard to electron acceptors, fullerene, which is an extensively conjugated three-dimensional π system, is an ideal electron acceptor because of the minimal changes of structure and solvation associated with the electron-transfer reduction.17 Thus, the combination of porphyrin and fullerene is regarded as an ideal donor–acceptor couple, since the combination results in a small reorganization energy, which accelerates photoinduced electron transfer and slows charge recombination, leading to the generation of a long-lived charge-separated state with a high quantum yield.17–22 Combination of porphyrins and fullerenes is also known to form supramolecular complexes, which contain closest contacts between one of the electron-rich 6:6 bonds of the guest fullerene and the geometric center of the host porphyrin.23–26 The porphyrin–fullerene interaction energies are reported to be in the range from −16 to −18 kcal mol−1.27 Such a strong interaction between porphyrins and fullerenes is likely to be a good driving force for the formation of supramolecular complexes between porphyrins and fullerenes. The association constants also depend on the type of metal ion in a porphyrin ring,24c and differences may make it possible to control electron transport properties, which is essential for photoenergy conversion.
We report herein the construction of a organic solar cell composed of porphyrin–peptide oligomers and fullerenes which are prepared by cluster formation on SnO2 electrodes (Scheme 1).28 We have investigated the effects of the number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit [P(H2P)n (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) and P(ZnP)n (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)] and of the types of porphyrins (H2P vs. ZnP) and fullerenes (C60vs. C60 derivatives) in Fig. 1 on the structures, spectroscopic, and photoelectrochemical properties of the porphyrin–C60 composite electrodes. In addition to the photoelectrochemical measurements, the detailed structural and photophysical information between porphyrin and fullerene using circular dichroism (CD), association constants based on absorption and fluorescence changes, fluorescence lifetimes and femtosecond transient absorption spectra are also discussed here.

Experimental
Materials
All solvents and chemicals were of reagent grade quality, obtained commercially and used without further purification unless otherwise noted (vide infra). The details of synthesis of porphyrin–peptide oligomers have been reported previously.16 Nanostructured SnO2 films were cast on an optically transparent electrode (OTE) by applying a 2% colloidal solution obtained from Alfa Chemicals. The air-dried films were annealed at 673 K. The details of the preparation of SnO2 films on conducting glass substrates were reported elsewhere.29 The nanostructured SnO2 film electrode is referred to as OTE/SnO2.
Electrophoretic deposition of cluster films
A known amount of porphyrin derivatives, C60 or mixed cluster solution in acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1 v/v, 2 mL) was transferred to a 1 cm cuvette in which two electrodes (viz., OTE/SnO2 and OTE) were kept at a distance of 6 mm using a Teflon spacer. A DC voltage (300 V) was applied between these two electrodes using a Fluke 415 power supply.30,31 The deposition of the film can be visibly seen as the solution becomes colorless with simultaneous brown coloration of the OTE/SnO2 electrode. The OTE/SnO2 electrode coated with mixed P(H2P)n [or P(ZnP)n] and C60 clusters is referred to as (P(H2P)n + C60)m or (P(ZnP)n + C60)m for simplicity.
The UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 3101 spectrophotometer. Transmission electron micrographs (TEM) of composite clusters of porphyrin and fullerene were recorded by applying a drop of the sample to a carbon-coated copper grid. Images were recorded using a Hitachi H600 transmission electron microscope. The morphology of the mesoporous electrodes was characterized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM; JEOL, JSM-6700FE). The SEM was operated with an accelerating voltage of 10 kV.
Photoelectrochemical measurements
Photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out in a standard two-compartment cell consisting of a working electrode and a Pt wire gauze counter electrode. A Princeton Applied Research (PAR) model 173 potentiostat and Model 175 universal programmer were used for recording I–V characteristics. All other photoelectrochemical measurements were carried out using a working electrode and a Pt gauze counter electrode in the same cell assembly using a Keithley model 617 programmable electrometer. The electrolyte was 0.5 M NaI and 0.01 M I2 in acetonitrile. A collimated light beam from a 150 W xenon lamp with a 400 nm cut-off filter was used for excitation of (P(H2P)n + C60)m [or (P(ZnP)n + C60)m] films deposited on SnO2 electrodes. A Bausch and Lomb high intensity grating monochromator was introduced into the path of the excitation beam for the selected wavelength.
Photodynamics measurements
Quenching experiments of the fluorescence of composite films was carried out on a Shimadzu spectrofluorophotometer (RF-5000). Fluorescence decays were measured by using femtosecond pulse laser excitation and a single photon counting system for fluorescence decay measurements.31 The laser system was a cavity-dumped femtosecond Ti : Sa laser pumped by a cw Nd : YAG laser (Spectra-Physics, Millennia). The full width at half-maximum of the instrument response function was 53 ps. The fluorescence decays were measured with magic angle emission polarization.
ESR measurements
A quartz ESR tube (internal diameter: 4.5 mm) containing a deaerated acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1 v/v) solution of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m was irradiated in the cavity of the ESR spectrometer with the focused light of a 1000 W high-pressure Hg lamp (Ushio-USH1005D) through an aqueous filter at low temperature. The ESR spectra in frozen acetonitrile–toluene were measured under non-saturating microwave power conditions using a JEOL X-band spectrometer (JES-RE1XE) with an attached variable temperature apparatus. The magnitude of modulation was chosen to optimize the resolution and the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio of the observed spectra when the maximum slope linewidth (ΔHmsl) of the ESR signals was unchanged with a larger modulation magnitude. The g values were calibrated with an Mn2+ marker.
Femtosecond laser flash photolysis
Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy experiments were conducted using a Clark-MXR 2010 laser system and an optical detection system provided by Ultrafast Systems (Helios). The source for the pump and probe pulses was derived from the fundamental output of the Clark laser system (775 nm, 1 mJ pulse−1 and fwhm = 150 fs) at a repetition rate of 1 kHz. A second harmonic generator introduced into the path of the laser beam provided 387 nm laser pulses for excitation. 95% of the fundamental output of the laser (775 nm) was used to generate the second harmonic, while 5% of the deflected output was used for white light generation. Prior to generating the probe continuum, the laser pulse was fed to a delay line that provided an experimental time window of 1.6 ns with a maximum step resolution of 7 fs. The pump beam was attenuated at 5 µJ pulse−1 with a spot size of 2 mm diameter at the sample cell where it was merged with the white probe pulse in a close angle (<10°). The probe beam after passing through the 2 mm sample cell was focused on a 200 µm fiber optic cable which was connected to a CCD spectrograph (Ocean Optics, S2000-UV-vis) for recording the time-resolved spectra (425–800 nm). Typically, 5000 excitation pulses were averaged to obtain the transient spectrum at a set delay time. Kinetic traces at appropriate wavelengths were assembled from the time-resolved spectral data. All measurements were conducted at room temperature, 298 K. When necessary a flow cell was used to circulate the solution through the sample cell.
Results and discussion
Molecular assembly of porphyrin–peptide oligomers and C60 in mixed solvents
Porphyrin–peptide oligomers [P(H2P)n or P(ZnP)n] form supramolecular complexes with fullerene molecules in toluene. In an acetonitrile–toluene mixed solvent system these supramolecular complexes aggregate to form clusters of diameter 100–200 nm. These clusters can be assembled on nanostructured SnO2 electrodes by an electrophoretic deposition method (500 V cm−1 for 1 minute) using the methodology described previously.30 The organization of porphyrin–peptide oligomers and C60 composite clusters [denoted as (P(H2P)n + C60)m or (P(ZnP)n + C60)m (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)] was performed by fast injecting a mixed toluene solution of P(H2P)n [P(ZnP)n] and C60 into acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1 v/v). Herein the concentration of one porphyrin unit in these composite clusters is taken as the same in the oligomers: [P(H2P)1] = [P(ZnP)1] = 0.19 mM, [P(H2P)2] = [P(ZnP)2] = 0.10 mM, [P(H2P)4] = [P(ZnP)4] = 0.048 mM, [P(H2P)8] = [P(ZnP)8] = 0.024 mM and [P(H2P)16] = [P(ZnP)16] = 0.012 mM in acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1, v/v), whereas the concentration of C60 (0.31 mM) is in excess of the concentration of one porphyrin unit in acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1 v/v). This procedure allows us to achieve the supramolecular complex formation between porphyrin–peptide oligomers and C60, and the cluster formation at the same time.

Fig. 2 shows the transmission electron micrograph (TEM) images of the composite clusters [A: (P(H2P)16 + C60)m, B: (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m, C: (P(ZnP)8 + C60)m and D: (P(ZnP)1 + C60)m]. As solvents evaporate on the copper grid, the clusters form well-defined shapes and sizes. Judging from the molecular scale of porphyrin and C60, one can conclude that porphyrin molecules are self-assembled with C60 molecules in the mixed solution to yield large donor–acceptor (D–A) nanoclusters with an interpenetrating network. Especially, in the case of the composite assemblies of porphyrin–peptide oligomers and C60 (Fig. 2A–C), the sizes and shapes are very controlled as compared with those of (P(ZnP)1 + C60)m (Fig. 2D). This demonstrates that the size and shapes are largely dependent on the structures of the multi-porphyrin arrays.

We have also measured absorption spectra of the composite clusters as shown in Fig. 3. The absorption spectra of (P(ZnP)n + C60)m (spectra a–c) in an acetonitrile–toluene 3 : 1 mixture become broad and red-shifted as compared with those of the monomeric forms in toluene (spectra d and e). This trend is enhanced with increasing the number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit, when the Soret band in (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m is red-shifted and the spectrum becomes broad compared with those of (P(ZnP)1 + C60)m and (P(ZnP)2 + C60)m. The broad absorption in the visible and near IR regions is characteristic of π-complexes formed between porphyrins and fullerenes.32,33 The broader spectrum of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m compared to that of (P(ZnP)1 + C60)m results from the charge-transfer (CT) type interaction of the π-complex between porphyrin and C60 in the long-wavelength absorption of the composite clusters. Similar CT interactions leading to an extended absorption have been observed for porphyrin–C60 dyads linked in close proximity.32–35 In the case of porphyrin–fullerene composite clusters, the higher CT absorption is clearly observed because of the strong interaction, although the scattering effect is also observed.28,31

Association constants between porphyrins and fullerenes
The UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectral changes give us useful information of supramolecular formation between porphyrins and fullerenes as shown in Fig. 4. The Soret band of P(H2P)16 in benzonitrile at 298 K is red-shifted with a clean isosbestic point by addition of C60, and the absorbance change exhibits saturation behavior with increasing C60 concentration (Fig. 4A and B). This indicates that C60 forms a 1 : 1 complex with the porphyrin moiety of P(H2P)16 as shown in eqn (1), where H2P is one porphyrin unit in P(H2P)16. According to eqn (1), (1)The K value in eqn (1) can be calculated from eqn (2),36 [H2P]0/(A0

The formation constant between P(H2P)16 and C60 in benzonitrile is determined as 1.4 × 104 M−1 from the slope of the plot in the inset of Fig. 4B.
 Fig. 4  (A) Absorption spectral changes of P(H2P)16 (3.5 × 10−6 M based on one porphyrin unit) in the presence of various concentrations of C60 (0 to 8.9 × 10−5 M) in PhCN at 298 K. (B) Plot of absorbance at 422 nm vs. [C60]. Inset: Plot of [C60]−1vs. [H2P]/(A0

As P(H2P)16 forms the supramolecular complex with C60, the fluorescence of P(H2P)16 may be quenched by intracomplex electron transfer from the singlet excited state of the porphyrin moiety to C60. The apparent formation constant determined from the fluorescence quenching (8.2 × 104 M−1) is significantly larger than that determined from the UV-vis spectral change. This indicates that the excited energy migration between the porphyrin units occurs efficiently prior to the electron transfer. The K values of various types of porphyrin–peptide oligomers [P(H2P)n or P(ZnP)n] and C60 derivatives are listed in Table 1. The association constant between porphyrins and C60 increases with increasing number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit. This indicates that the interaction between porphyrin and C60 becomes stronger with increasing number of porphyrins in the porphyrinic polypeptide. The large association constant in the P(H2P)n–C60 system relative to the P(ZnP)n–C60 system indicates that free base porphyrins in the polypeptidic structure can accommodate C60 molecules between two porphyrin rings more easily than zinc porphyrins as reported for the complex formation between a porphyrin and fullerene.31 When C60 is replaced by C60 derivatives bearing either imidazole or pyridine coordinating ligands (C60Im and C60Py), the association constants in the P(ZnP)16–C60Im and P(ZnP)16–C60Py systems become much larger than that of the P(ZnP)16–C60 system due to the π–π interaction between porphyrins and fullerenes plus axial coordination to zinc porphyrin in P(ZnP)16. Such differences in the association constants certainly affect the light energy conversion efficiencies (vide infra).

Circular dichroism (CD) measurements
We have measured the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of P(ZnP)16 in the presence of various concentrations of C60 to observe the structural change in P(ZnP)16. The CD spectrum of a benzonitrile solution of P(ZnP)16 (Fig. 5) shows a Cotton effect originating from the porphyrin Soret band at 428 nm. The intensity of the signal corresponding to the Soret band of P(H2P)16 decreases with increasing concentration of C60. This indicates that structures in P(ZnP)16 are less ordered due to the formation of the supramolecular complex between porphyrins and C60.

Electrophoretic deposition of P(H2P)n [P(ZnP)n] and C60 mixed clusters on OTE/SnO2 electrodes
Upon subjecting the resultant cluster suspension to a high DC voltage (500 V for 1 min), mixed porphyrin–peptide oligomers [P(H2P)n or P(ZnP)n] and C60 clusters [(P(H2P)n + C60)m or (P(ZnP)n + C60)m] were deposited onto an optically transparent electrode (OTE) of a nanostructured SnO2 electrode (OTE/SnO2), to give modified electrodes [denoted as (P(H2P)n + C60)m or (P(ZnP)n + C60)m (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16)]. The scanning electron micrograph (SEM) image of the (P(H2P)16 + C60)m deposited electrode reveals cluster aggregation with a regular size (Fig. 6A). The (P(H2P)16 + C60)m film on the electrode is composed of closely packed clusters of around 100 nm size. The cluster size in the SEM image is similar to that observed in the TEM image of the composite clusters prepared in acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1 v/v) (Fig. 2A).

The absorptivity of the porphyrin–peptide oligomers–C60 composite films on ITO/SnO2 electrodes (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m, (P(H2P)16 + C60)m and (P(H2P)8 + C60)m: spectra a–c in Fig. 6B) is greatly enhanced compared with that of the reference system containing porphyrin units alone [(P(H2P)8)m: spectrum d in Fig. 6B].30,31 These results ensure that incident light is absorbed intensively in the visible and near-infrared regions by (P(ZnP)n + C60)m and (P(H2P)n + C60)m due to the supramolecular π-complex formation between porphyrins and C60.33–35
Photocurrent generation properties
Photoelectrochemical measurements were performed with a standard two-electrode system consisting of a working electrode and a Pt wire gauze electrode in 0.5 M NaI and 0.01 M I2 in air-saturated acetonitrile. We have previously reported that the incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) increases with increasing C60 concentration (0 to 0.31 mM in acetonitrile–toluene) at a constant concentration of P(H2P)8 (0.024 mM).28 This indicates that efficient electron transfer from the excited state of porphyrin to C60 occurs, leading to efficient photocurrent generation.30,31

Fig. 7A shows the IPCE of the (P(H2P)n + C60)m (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) modified electrode at a constant concentration ratio of porphyrin to C60 (vide supra). The IPCE value of the (P(H2P)n + C60)m system exhibits a remarkable increase with increasing number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit. In particular, the (P(H2P)16 + C60)m system has the maximum IPCE value of 48% at 600 nm as well as a broad photoresponse, extending into the infrared region up to 1000 nm. Such an effective light energy conversion is ascribed to the polypeptide structure controlling the three-dimensional organization between porphyrins and C60. On the other hand, Fig. 7B shows the photocurrent action spectra of the (P(ZnP)n + C60)m (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) electrode at a constant concentration ratio of porphyrin to C60 (vide supra). The IPCE value of (P(ZnP)n + C60)m modified electrodes also exhibits a remarkable increase with increasing number of porphyrin moieties in a polypeptide unit. The maximum IPCE of the (P(ZnP)n + C60)m system also exhibits a remarkable increase with increasing number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit. The maximum IPCE of (P(ZnP)n + C60)m is determined as 56% at 480 nm.

See text for the employed concentrations of the individual species. 
Three important observations emerge from the comparison of IPCE photocurrent action spectra of (P(ZnP)n + C60)m and (P(H2P)n + C60)m modified electrodes. First, IPCE values increase with increasing number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit in both (P(H2P)n + C60)m and (P(ZnP)n + C60)m (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) systems. This increase is indicative of the fact that efficient photoinduced electron transfer occurs from the excited state of the porphyrin unit to C60 in the supramolecular complex with increasing number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit (vide supra). This trend is in good agreement with the results of association constants between porphyrins and C60 based on absorption and fluorescence spectral changes (vide supra). The second observation is that the maximum IPCE value of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m (56%) is greater than that of (P(H2P)16 + C60)m (48%). This may be ascribed to the driving force for photoinduced electron transfer or the energy level of the triplet excited state of porphyrin (see Scheme 2). The last observation concerns the action spectra of the (P(H2P)n + C60)m modified electrodes which cover the region up to 950 nm and this response is broader than those of (P(ZnP)n + C60)m modified electrodes. This is further indicative of the stronger association between porphyrins and C60 in a polypeptide structure in (P(H2P)n + C60)m.

We have also compared IPCE spectra of (P(ZnP)16 + C60Im)m and (P(ZnP)16 + C60Py)m modified electrodes with that of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m in order to examine the effect of the coordination bond of C60 derivatives on the IPCE as shown in Fig. 7C. The maximum IPCE values of (P(ZnP)16 + C60Py)m and (P(ZnP)16 + C60Im)m are 20% and 15%, respectively. These values are much smaller than that of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m (56%), whereas the binding constant of P(ZnP)16–C60 is smaller than those of P(ZnP)16–C60Im and P(ZnP)16–C60Py (vide supra). This suggests that stronger interaction between porphyrin and C60 derivatives does not necessary improve the IPCE values. There are two essential factors in efficient photocurrent generation. One is the charge separation between porphyrin and fullerene, and the other is the resulting hole and electron transport in the thin film. Taking into consideration the large association constants in all the investigated systems [P(ZnP)16–C60, P(ZnP)16–C60Im, and P(ZnP)16–C60Py], a key element for efficient photocurrent generation is mainly the hole and electron transport in the thin film rather than the charge separation between porphyrins and C60. The lower IPCE values of the P(ZnP)16–C60Im and P(ZnP)16–C60Py systems compared with that of P(ZnP)16–C60 system may result from the poor electron transport properties of C60 derivatives due to the steric hindrance of the ligand moiety (Fig. 7C).
Power conversion efficiency
In order to examine the power conversion efficiency of porphyrin–peptide oligomer/C60 composite films, we have measured current–voltage (I–V) characteristics (Fig. 8). Fig. 8A shows I–V characteristics of (a) (P(H2P)16 + C60)m, (b) (P(H2P)8 + C60)m and (c) (P(H2P)1 + C60)m modified electrodes under visible light irradiation (λ > 400 nm). The (P(H2P)16 + C60)m system has a larger fill factor (FF) of 0.47, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 320 mV, a short circuit current density (Isc) of 0.36 mA cm−2, and the overall power conversion efficiency (η) of 1.6% at input power (Win) of 3.4 mW cm−2.37 The corresponding η values of (P(H2P)8 + C60)m and (P(H2P)1 + C60)m modified electrodes are 1.3% and 0.043%, respectively.38 This order of increase in the η values largely agrees with the trend observed in IPCE experiments. The η value of the (P(H2P)16 + C60)m system is also remarkably enhanced (around 40 times) in comparison with the (P(H2P)1 + C60)m modified electrode (η = 0.043%) under the same experimental conditions. The η value of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m is also determined as 1.4% and this value is much larger than that of (P(ZnP)1 + C60)m (0.047%) as shown in Fig. 8B. These data of light energy conversion properties are summarized in Table 2.

Fluorescence spectra and fluorescence lifetime measurements on OTE/SnO2 surface
We have measured the fluorescence spectra on the OTE/SnO2 surface to examine the quenching efficiency of porphyrins by C60 in (P(H2P)n + C60)m systems. The fluorescence intensities of (P(H2P)16 + C60)m are much smaller than that of the single component system (P(H2P)16)m on the electrode surface. This clearly indicates that the excited state of porphyrin is strongly quenched by photoinduced electron transfer to C60 in the supramolecular complex (Fig. 9A).17–22
 Fig. 9  (A) Fluorescence spectra of (a) (P(H2P)16 + C60)m and (b) (P(H2P)16)m on an OTE/SnO2 surface. λex = 420 nm. (B) Fluorescence decay curves of (a) (P(H2P)16 + C60)m and (b) (P(H2P)16)m modified electrodes. The fluorescence decays are observed at 650 nm by the time-correlated single-photon counting method. The fluorescence intensities are normalized for comparison. The excitation wavelength is 420 nm and IRF (instrument response function) curves are presented for each decay. 
The fluorescence lifetimes on the OTE/SnO2 surface were also measured by the time-correlated single photon counting technique at emission wavelengths of 650 nm for (P(H2P)n)m modified electrodes with excitation of the porphyrin moiety at 420 nm as shown in Fig. 9B. The decay curves of the fluorescence intensity could be fitted as three exponentials.
The fluorescence of (P(H2P)n + C60)m (n = 1, 2, 4, 8, 16) electrodes is significantly quenched as compared to the corresponding (P(H2P)n)m without C60. This fluorescence quenching demonstrates the occurrence of ultrafast electron transfer from the singlet excited states of porphyrins to C60 in the supramolecular complex (vide infra).17–22
The fluorescence lifetimes are listed in Table 3. The fluorescence lifetimes of (P(H2P)n)m on the electrode surface decrease with increasing the number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit. This supports the increasing interaction between the porphyrin moieties in a polypeptide unit. The multiple and decrease of lifetime components on the films may be because of strong interactions between porphyrins or from porphyrin to SnO2 electrode in contrast with the single component and similar lifetime in toluene.28 The fluorescence lifetimes of major component (τ1) of (P(H2P)n + C60)m are clearly smaller than those of (P(H2P)n)m without C60 and decrease with increasing the number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit (Table 3), although the similar multiple components are observed. This trend may arise from the change in the driving force of electron transfer because of the strong supramolecular formation between porphyrins and C60, which leads to acceleration of the charge-separated state. This agrees with enhancement of the IPCE values with increasing the number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit (Fig. 7A). On the modified electrodes, the τ1 values of (P(ZnP)n + C60)m (n = 8, 16) are also smaller than those of (P(ZnP)n)m (n = 8, 16) without C60 as the case of the (P(H2P)n + C60)m. Additionally, the τ1 value of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m is much smaller than those of (P(ZnP)n + C60)m (n = 1, 8). Thus, the supramolecular complex formation between porphyrins and C60 becomes more favored with increasing the number of porphyrin in a polypeptide unit to facilitate photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of porphyrin to C60, leading to efficient photocurrent generation.

Electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement
The formation of the radical cation of P(ZnP)16 and the radical anion of C60 in (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m composite clusters upon photoexcitation was confirmed by electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements performed in frozen acetonitrile–toluene under photoirradiation. The resulting ESR spectrum of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m upon photoirradiation in acetonitrile–toluene at 123 K is shown in Fig. 10. The ESR signal (g = 2.002) is assigned to the overlap of two signals due to the porphyrin radical cation and C60˙−.39
 Fig. 10  ESR spectrum of photoirradiated (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m ([ZnP] = 0.012 mM; [C60] = 0.31 mM) in acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1 v/v) under photoirradiation with a high-pressure mercury lamp, measured at 123 K. 
Femtosecond transient absorption spectra of composite clusters
The photodynamics of the composite molecular clusters of zinc porphyrins with a polypeptide unit [P(ZnP)n] and C60 were examined by the femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption spectra. The time-resolved transient absorption spectra of (P(ZnP)1 + C60)m in acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1 v/v) are shown in Fig. 11A. Upon 387 nm laser pulse excitation we observe a broad absorption in the 450–510 nm as we populate the porphyrin singlet excited state. This transient quickly decays to form a triplet excited state. The singlet and triplet excited state of porphyrins have been characterized earlier.40 In addition, a strong transient bleaching (around 610 nm) arises from the fluorescence. Although the dominant triplet absorption of the porphyrin that overlaps with the absorption due to the charge-separated state has precluded the clear detection of the charge-separated state, fullerene radical anion generated by the photoinduced electron transfer is clearly detected in the nanosecond laser flash photolysis measurement (Fig. S2 in ESI†). The decay curve at 1070 nm due to C60˙− can be well fitted by first-order kinetics rather than bimolecular second-order kinetics and the apparent lifetime of the back electron transfer is determined as 79 µs at 298 K.
 Fig. 11  Time-resolved absorption spectra recorded following 387 nm laser pulse excitation of (A) (P(ZnP)1 + C60)m ([P(ZnP)1] = 0.19 mM; [C60] = 0.31 mM), (B) (P(ZnP)8 + C60)m ([P(ZnP)8] = 0.024 mM; [C60] = 0.31 mM), (C) (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m ([P(ZnP)16] = 0.012 mM; [C60] = 0.31 mM), (D) (P(H2P)16 + C60)m ([P(H2P)16] = 0.012 mM; [C60] = 0.31 mM). All samples were prepared in argon-saturated acetonitrile–toluene (3 : 1 v/v) and measurements were made at 298 K. 
In contrast to the (P(ZnP)1 + C60)m system, the strong absorption arising from singlet and triplet excited states of porphyrins (450–510 nm) is missing in the cases of (P(ZnP)8 + C60)m and (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m. Instead a broad absorption at around 650 nm appears after the laser pulse excitation as shown in Fig. 11B and C. The transient absorption spectra of (P(H2P)16 + C60)m exhibit a similar trend to those of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m; see Fig. 11D. Such broad absorption spectra are indicative of the formation of the porphyrin radical cation.41 It is also interesting to note that the bleaching originating from fluorescence (610 nm region) is absent in the transient spectra (Fig. 11B and C).
These spectral features indicate that electron transfer from the singlet excited state of porphyrins to C60 occurs in the stronger supramolecular complexes of (P(ZnP)8 + C60)m and (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m compared to the corresponding monomer system (vide supra). Thus, photoinduced electron transfer from the singlet excited state of P(ZnP)n to C60 occurs in the composite clusters of (P(ZnP)n + C60)m (n = 8, 16). Taking into consideration the same number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit, the difference in the excited state interaction results from the organization of porphyrins and fullerenes. This behavior demonstrates that the organized assembly within a polypeptide unit facilitates the photoinduced electron transfer by forming the supramolecular complex. This trend is also in good agreement with the association constant, fluorescence lifetime and IPCE results.
Photocurrent generation mechanism
Photocurrent generation in the present system is initiated by photoinduced charge separation from the singlet excited state of free base porphyrin (1H2P*/H2P˙+ = −0.7 V vs. NHE)30 or zinc porphyrin (1ZnP*/ZnP˙+ = −1.0 V vs. NHE)42 in the porphyrin–peptide oligomer to C60 (C60/C60˙− = −0.2 V vs. NHE)30 in the porphyrin–C60 complex rather than direct electron injection to the conduction band of SnO2 (0 V vs. NHE) system.30 The reduced C60 injects electrons into the SnO2 nanocrystallites, whereas the oxidized porphyrin (H2P/H2P˙+ = 1.2 V or ZnP/ZnP˙+ = 1.0 V vs. NHE)18b,30,31 undergoes the electron-transfer reduction with the iodide (I3−/I− = 0.5 V vs. NHE)30 in the electrolyte system. The driving force of electron transfer from 1ZnP* to C60 (0.8 eV) is significantly larger than that of electron transfer from 1H2P* to C60 (0.5 eV). The larger IPCE value of (P(ZnP)16 + C60)m (56%) than that of (P(H2P)16 + C60)m (48%) may be ascribed to the difference in the driving force of electron transfer. The increase in the number of porphyrin unit in porphyrin polypeptides results in the formation of well-organized clusters as shown in Fig. 2 (B vs. D). In such a case, electron injection following the charge separation occurs more effectively to a nanostructured SnO2 electrode, which may arise from the increase of the surface area of the composite clusters, as revealed by the photoelectrochemical measurements (Fig. 7).
Conclusions
We have successfully constructed novel organic photovoltaic systems using supramolecular complexes of porphyrin–peptide oligomers with fullerene clusters. The highly colored composite clusters of porphyrin–peptide oligomers and fullerenes were assembled as three-dimensional arrays onto nanostructured SnO2 films using an electrophoretic deposition method. The composite cluster OTE/SnO2 electrode prepared with an assembly of 16 porphyrin unit–polypeptide chain and C60, viz.(P(ZnP)16 + C60)m, exhibits an impressive incident photon-to-photocurrent efficiency (IPCE) with values reaching as high as 56%. The broad photocurrent action spectra (with photoresponse extending up to 1000 nm) show the ability of these composites to harvest photons in the visible and infrared. The power conversion efficiency (η) of (P(H2P)16 + C60)m modified electrode reaches 1.6%, which is 40 times higher than the value (0.043%) of the porphyrin monomer (P(H2P)1 + C60)m modified electrode. Thus, the organization approach between porphyrins and fullerenes with polypeptide structures is promising, and may make it possible to further improve the light energy conversion properties by using larger number of porphyrins in a polypeptide unit. Such an increase in the light energy conversion efficiency is ascribed to the enhancement of photoinduced electron transfer in the supramolecular assembly.

The η value of the OTE/SnO2/(P(H2P)16 + C60)m system is ∼0.7% at an input power (Win) of 100 mW cm−2 .
The prompt, steady and reproducible photocurrent and photovoltage responses upon excitation of the OTE/SnO2/(P(H2P)8 + C60)m electrode in the visible region (λ > 400 nm) are shown in Fig. S1A and S1B, respectively (see ESI†).
A strong interaction with porphyrins lowers the symmetry of C60˙−, resulting in an increase in the g value. This may be the reason why the two signals are overlapped; see:   S. Fukuzumi, H. Mori, T. Suenobu, H. Imahori, X. Gao and K. M. Kadish, J. Phys. Chem. A, 2000, 104, 10688 Search PubMed .
