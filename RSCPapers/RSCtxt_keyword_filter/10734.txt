    , Accepted 9th June 2017First published on 9th June 2017AbstractAn interpenetrating bulk-heterojunction structure with a domain size of 10–20 nm is the ideal morphology for carrier generation, separation and transportation in organic solar cells. However, depending on the blend composition, the phase-separation behavior of the crystalline small molecule blend system of donor 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and acceptor N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI) is quite different. When the weight ratio of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI is greater than 8:2 or smaller than 4:6, a large phase separation structure is observed induced by p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 or EP-PDI crystallization. When the ratio of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2:EP-PDI changes from 7:3 to 5:5, no obvious phase separation can be detected due to the interaction between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI. In order to obtain the interpenetrating bulk-heterojunction structure with a domain size of 10–20 nm, we proposed to tune the molecule diffusion of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI by different thermal annealing temperature to control the phase separation domain size and phase purity. When the annealing temperature is T < TmEP-PDI + Ta or T > Tcp-DTS(FBTTh2)2 − Tb (T is the thermal annealing temperature, Ta and Tb are constants), the molecule diffusion rate of both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI is too slow or too fast, resulting in no phase separation or large phase separation morphology. When T is between TmEP-PDI + Ta and Tcp-DTS(FBTTh2)2 − Tb, EP-PDI is in a melting state, but p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 self-assembles into crystals. As a result, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallized and formed a framework, which inhibited the massive crystallization of EP-PDI due to the spatial confinement of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallization framework, leading to the formation of a bi-continuous phase separation structure with suitable domain size and phase purity. Based on the above phase separation structure we got, a power conversion efficiency of 4.25% was obtained, which is relatively high in this system without any additives.
Introduction
Solution-processed bulk-heterojunction organic photovoltaics (BHJ OPVs) have attracted great attention and polymer-based BHJ OPVs have surpassed 10% power conversion efficiency.1–7 In contrast to functionalized fullerenes, which exhibit relatively low absorption coefficients within the terrestrial solar spectrum, low-cost non-fullerene acceptors possess strong light absorption and a tunable energy level, making them competitive alternatives to the fullerene acceptors.8,9
Similar to traditional fullerene-based blend systems, a bi-continuous phase separation structure with a domain size of 10–20 nm is the ideal morphology for carrier generation, separation and transportation in non-fullerene BHJ OPVs.10–12 Besides, an increase in solid state order has been correlated with an increase in the efficiency of charge generation.13,14 Hence, a better understanding of the guidelines to regulate the film morphology is required to construct ideal phase separation structures.
As we know, the low-cost commercial dye perylene diimide derivatives (PDIs) are one of the most widely used non-fullerene materials. However, the interaction between different kinds of donors and PDI acceptor materials is quite different. For the blend with poor miscibility between donor and PDIs, the films show large phase separation morphology induced by the formation of large scale PDI crystals.15 A large phase separation structure will seriously reduce the formation of a charge-transfer state, which only occurs at the interface of donor/acceptor.16,17 In addition, the formation of an intermolecular state with lower energy especially in H-aggregated PDI systems leads to difficult exciton separation.18 For the blend with good miscibility between donor and PDIs, the films exhibit a finely intermixed microstructure and this microstructure cannot provide the carrier transportation pathway after charge separation.19,20 Therefore, the film morphology of PDI-based systems is always far from satisfactory for nanostructures of optimal devices.
Many research studies have been done to control phase separation morphology of PDI-based systems. For the case of large phase separation, reducing the interaction of PDI molecules is an effective way to control the domain size. PDI dimers or trimers are synthesised to introduce torsion angles, inhibiting the π–π molecular interactions of PDI, which reduces the phase separation domain size.21–23 Furthermore, the two or three dimensional molecule structure also expands the transportation pathway (from one dimension to two or three dimension) for free charges. In the case of finely mixed PDI-based OPVs, the enhancement of crystallization and construction of bi-continuous pure crystalline domains are crucially important for carrier transportation. Incorporation of solvent additives,24,25 thermal annealing (TA)13,26 and solvent vapor annealing (SVA)27,28 have been applied to PDI-based systems to optimize the ordered microstructures. However, the phase separation behavior and the relation between crystallization and phase separation are not systematically explored, which therefore cannot provide straightforward guidelines for constructing interpenetrating networks with proper domain size and purity.
Herein, we depicted the phase diagram of the crystalline small molecule in the donor 7,7′-(4,4-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) and acceptor N,N′-bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI) blend system by thermal annealing. We constructed the relationship of film morphology with blend ratio and thermal annealing temperature. Meanwhile, we found that only when the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI ratio is between 7:3 and 5:5, the films exhibit homogeneous morphology due to the good miscibility of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI. Therefore, we utilized the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 to confine phase separation of the blend through tuning the relative molecule diffusion rate, constructing a nano-scale interpenetrating network phase separation structure. We found that the proper thermal annealing temperature is related to the intrinsic temperature of Tc and Tm of the crystalline molecules. When the annealing temperature is between TmEP-PDI + Ta < T < Tcp-DTS(FBTTh2)2 − Tb, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules self-assemble into an ordered structure, preferentially forming a crystalline net framework. Meanwhile, EP-PDI in the melting state is spatially confined by the crystalline net framework of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, inhibiting the formation of large scale crystals. According to the guidelines we obtained, a device performance of 4.25% is achieved based on the bi-continuous phase separation structure with proper phase purity, which is the highest PCE of the (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2):EP-PDI blend system without any additives.
Experimental
Materials

N,N′-Bis(1-ethylpropyl)-perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (EP-PDI) was purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc. 7,7′-(4,4-Bis(2-ethylhexyl)-4H-silolo[3,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(6-fluoro-4-(5′-hexyl-[2,2′-bithiophen]-5-yl)benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole) (p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) was obtained from 1-Material Inc. The chemical structures of two semiconducting materials mentioned above are shown in Scheme 1. Chlorobenzene (CB) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. All materials were used as received.

Phase separation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI and characterization

p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI (total concentration of 30 mg mL−1 with a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI weight ratio of 8:2, 7:3, 6:4, 5:5, 4:6 and 3:7) chlorobenzene solution was heated for 12 hours. Subsequently, the solution was spin-coated at 1500 rpm for 30 s at 80 °C to obtain films of different p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI ratios with thickness around 100 nm. Thus, we obtained films with different p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI ratios. The phase separation structure is crucially dependent on the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI ratios due to the different phase separation mechanism.
Thermal annealing treatment was applied to drive the phase separation process of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI blend films with a p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI weight ratio of 7:3, 6:4 and 5:5. The spin-coated films were heated from 60 °C to 150 °C with a temperature interval of 10 °C for 10 min to obtain the films with various phase separation structures. All the processes were operated in a N2-filled glove box.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed using a TA DSC Q2000 instrument under nitrogen at the heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1 in four heating/cooling cycles. The DSC plot of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI (1:1 w/w) was obtained from the powder sample collected from drop-cast films.
UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Lambda 750 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA). The fluorescence spectra of films were recorded using a Jobin Yvon LabRAM HR spectrometer (a 532 nm solid-state laser was chosen as the excitation light source).
The crystallinity of the film was analyzed using out-of-plane grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements. GIXD patterns were measured using a D8 Discover diffractometer (Bruker, Germany) (λ = 1.54 Å). The GIXD profiles were obtained by using a Bruker D8 Discover reflector with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. The measurements were achieved with a scanning interval of 2θ between 2° and 30°.
The morphology of the active layer was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). TEM images were obtained from a TEM-1011 (JEOL Co., Japan) with an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. AFM images were recorded by using a Veeco Instruments Nanoscope in tapping mode. A silicon microcantilever (spring constant 2 N m−1 and resonant frequency ≈70 kHz, Olympus, Japan) was used for scanning.
RSoXS transmission measurements were performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 at the ALS. Samples for RSoXS measurements were prepared on a PSS-modified Si substrate under the same conditions as those used for device fabrication, and then transferred by floating in water to a 1.5 mm × 1.5 mm, 100 nm thick Si3N4 membrane supported by a 5 mm × 5 mm, 200 μm thick Si frame (Norcada Inc.). The sample detector distance was calibrated from the diffraction peaks of a triblock copolymer poly(isoprene-b-styrene-b-2-vinyl pyridine), which has a known spacing of 391 Å. The beam size at the sample was ≈100 μm by 200 μm.
Device fabrication and testing
Organic solar cells were fabricated with the configuration of indium tin oxide on indium tin oxide (ITO)/ZnO/p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI/MoO3/Al. The cleaned ITO glass substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 25 min. Subsequently, a ZnO layer was spin-coated on the top of the ITO glass and dried at 200 °C for 60 min. The active layers were spin-coated on the substrate and then treated with different temperatures. Finally, a bilayer structure of MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) was deposited on top of the active layer by thermal evaporation in a vacuum of 2 × 10−4 Pa. Four solar cells, each with an active area of 7.2 mm2, were fabricated per ITO glass substrate.
Current density–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the organic solar cells were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 236 source meter under AM1.5G illumination from a calibrated solar simulator with an irradiation intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the OPV cells was measured using a QE-R3011 (Enli Technology Co., Ltd) with a lock-in amplifier at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz; the monochromatic light was obtained from a xenon lamp.
Results and discussion
Morphology including phase separation structure, domain size and phase purity plays a crucial role in carrier generation, separation and transportation in organic solar cells. To construct the bi-continuous nanostructure of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI blend system, we tuned the crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 to induce the film phase separation. The crystallization of EP-PDI molecules must be confined by the crystallization framework of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. The confinement is regulated by the molecule diffusion in the blend, which is related to the intrinsic temperature of Tc and Tm of the molecules. The phase diagram of the blend system was depicted to explain the film morphology formation mechanism. Based on the rules we got, we constructed a bi-continuous phase separation structure with proper domain size and phase purity, and thus a great improvement of device performance was obtained.
Phase separation structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI with different blend ratios
As we all know, the planer structure of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI would readily induce the π–π stacking interactions of the same kind of molecules respectively. However, the compatibility between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI would inhibit the formation of large scale aggregates of the same kind of molecules as previously reported. In order to further understand the molecule properties and confirm the molecule interactions, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was performed. As shown in Fig. 1(A), the DSC curves of both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 (donor) and EP-PDI (acceptor) represent sharp phase transition peaks with a large area. The results make it clear that the Tc (from the first cooling cycle) and Tm (from the second heating cycle) of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 are 184 °C and 209 °C, respectively. For pure EP-PDI, the Tc and Tm signals are observed at 68 °C and 73 °C. As regards the blends of weight ratio 1:1, the coexistence of two separated phase transition peaks for both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI can be seen. However, both the melting peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and the solid–solid phase transition peak of EP-PDI in the blends get significantly weakened. Meanwhile, the endothermic peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 shifts to lower temperature (appears at 206 °C during the second heating procedure). The good compatibility is considered to be responsible for the decrease of the phase transition temperature.13 To further demonstrate the effect of compatibility on phase separation, out-of-plane GIXD patterns of pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI as well as blend films with a D:A weight ratio of 6:4 were measured. As shown in Fig. 1(B), the diffraction peak of the (011) plane (2θ = 6.2°) is observed in the pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 film. However, the (011) peak shifts towards a smaller angle (2θ = 5.6°) and the diffraction density is sharply weakened. Furthermore, the diffraction peak of the (100) plane (2θ = 4.1°) gets weakened. Besides, the (200) diffraction density (2θ = 4.9°) of EP-PDI is sharply weakened. It is worth mentioning that the diffraction peak has become extremely weak at the D:A ratio ranging from 7:3 to 5:5 (Fig. S1, ESI†), which indicates that a large amount of amorphous intermixed phases was formed in these films. The weak crystallinity of both components further demonstrates the good compatibility between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI.

(B) 1D out-of-plane X-ray profiles of pure p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, pure EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI (6:4 wt/wt). In order to use log scale to enhance the visibility of weak intensity, all the presented X-ray intensity values were plus extra 200 to avoid negative values. 
The morphology of blend films with different D:A ratios is shown in Fig. 2. For the D:A ratio 8:2, fibrous crystals in a large scale can be found in the film. Similarly for the D:A ratio smaller than 4:6, the EP-PDI also formed large scale aggregates. This phenomenon indicates that strong π–π stacking interactions exist in both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI of the same kind of molecules. When the D:A ratio is in the range of 7:3 to 5:5, the films exhibit a homogeneous structure, which is attributed to the good compatibility of the donor and acceptor as mentioned above. As the morphologies show, the films will exhibit different phase separation structures based on different D:A ratios. In all, no matter what the D:A ratio is, the film cannot form a bi-continuous phase separation structure, and hence cannot achieve a good device performance.

Confining the diffusion of EP-PDI molecules by crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 to construct bi-continuous phase separation
Thermal annealing (TA) was applied to drive the phase separation behavior of the amorphous film (here, we took D:A 6:4 as an example). To get insight into the solid order structure of the film, UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded since the shape of the absorption spectrum of the blend is strongly dependent on the nature of the respective molecular packing. As seen in Fig. 3, the absorption peak appears at 678 nm and gets stronger with increasing annealing temperature, indicating the formation of ordered aggregates for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2.29,30 Meanwhile, the weakened absorption bands corresponding to 0–0, 0–1 and 0–2 transitions (at 536, 495 and 466 nm, respectively) of the EP-PDI molecules and the emergence of a low-energy absorption band at around 590 nm are observed upon annealing, which are assigned to the formation of well-ordered EP-PDI aggregates (the UV-vis absorption spectra of the pure component and films thermally annealed at other temperatures are shown in Fig. S2, ESI†).31,32
 Fig. 3  UV-vis absorption spectra of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI blend films at 6:4 without TA treatment and with TA treatment at 70 °C, 110 °C, and 140 °C for 10 min. 
To further investigate the variation of the crystalline structure of the films upon annealing, GIXD patterns of films subjected to different post-treatments were measured. As shown in Fig. 4(A), p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in the pristine film shows weak diffraction signals, indicating the amorphous state of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. However, the (100) peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 was enhanced remarkably with the increase of TA temperature. This phenomenon illuminates that TA enhanced the ordered packing of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. The variation of the (100) diffraction intensity of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is concluded in Fig. 4(B). We can see that only when the TA temperature reaches 90 °C, the crystallinity can be enhanced obviously. In addition, the (200) peak corresponding to EP-PDI gets enhanced and remains almost at the same diffraction intensity between the TA temperature 100 °C and 130 °C as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The results mean that TA can effectively enhance the crystallization of both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI in the blend film, and somehow the crystallization of EP-PDI is restricted by p-DTS(FBTTh2)2.

The (100) diffraction intensities of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 in blend films at 6:4 with thermal annealing at different temperatures (B). In order to use log scale to enhance the visibility of weak intensity, all the presented X-ray intensity values were plus extra 200 to avoid negative values. 
To further represent the extent of phase separation, the fluorescence spectra (Fig. 5) were measured. As shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), we can confirm that the fluorescence peak of EP-PDI is at around 620 nm and the fluorescence peak of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is at around 725 nm, which allows us to distinguish the different fluorescence peak assignment in the blend film easily. Herein, for pristine p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI blend films (Fig. 5(A)), the fluorescence appears to be significantly quenched, which is indicative of intimate mixing of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI at a molecular level. When the film is subjected to TA at different temperatures, an increase of fluorescence signals of both EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 components is observed simultaneously, indicating the formation of enhanced phase separation with a prominent EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystalline phase.

From the discrepancy of the EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 fluorescence peak, the transformation of the phase separation structure of EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 can be reflected by tracking the intensities of the EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 fluorescence peak. As we know, the signal intensity is positively related to domain size and phase purity. After fitting the signal intensities, the evolution of EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 fluorescence peak intensities versus TA temperature is plotted in Fig. 5(B). The plots of EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 can be divided into two regions according to increasing slope, respectively. For the EP-PDI component, the phase domain increases slowly until 90 °C. Thereafter there is a rapid increase at temperature beyond 90 °C. The turning point of EP-PDI molecule diffusion is shifted to higher temperature than its Tm, which can be ascribed to the interaction of EP-PDI with p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 inhibiting the movement of EP-PDI molecules. For the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 component, the slow increase of the slow phase domain size lasts until 130 °C. The phase domain size undergoes a rapid increase at temperature beyond 130 °C. The shift of the turning point of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecule diffusion to lower temperature than its Tc is explained as follows. Combining the domain size changing process, the molecule diffusion behavior can be divided into 3 districts: district I (below 90 °C), district II (100–130 °C), district III (over 140 °C), colored to guide the eye. In district I (blue region), the domain size of both EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 increases at a slow rate, which can be attributed to slow diffusion of both kinds of molecules below 90 °C. In district II (purple region), p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 slowly diffuses to self-assemble into ordered crystals, but EP-PDI reaches a rapid molecule diffusion stage. In this process, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallizes to form a connected framework, and the diffusion of EP-PDI molecules is confined by p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystals. In the cooling process, EP-PDI molecules self-assemble into nanocrystals filling in the framework of crystallized p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. Thus a bi-continuous phase separation structure is formed. In district III (yellow region), both molecules diffuse rapidly. Molecules aggregate at a rapid rate, and EP-PDI breaks through the confinement of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. The difference of molecule diffusion can be explained as the diffusion rate having a positive correlation with the diffusion coefficient D, which meets the Arrhenius equation (eqn (1)): D = Doexp(−Ea/RT)(1)where D is the diffusion coefficient, Do is a temperature independent frequency factor, R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature (in kelvin) and Ea is the activation energy. From the Arrhenius equation, we can speculate that, the molecule with similar molecular weight will diffuse more frequently in the liquid phase than in the solid phase due to Ea being much larger in the solid phase than in the liquid phase. In addition, for the same molecule in the same phase state, the diffusion coefficient is positive related to temperature. Thus the higher temperature is, the bigger is the diffusion coefficient. There is a great discrepancy between p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI in crystallization temperature and melting temperature. Furthermore, for both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI molecules, their diffusion coefficient will increase with the increase of thermal annealing temperature.
RSoXS is performed to get phase separation information, such as domain size and phase purity. A photon energy of 284.2 eV was selected to provide high contrast between EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, while decreasing mass-thickness contrast and avoiding high absorption above the absorption edges, which can cause beam damage and background fluorescence. The average scattering sector profiles of blends without and with 110 °C TA treatment are shown in Fig. 6. The blend film without annealing shows a peak at q = 0.144 nm−1 which is caused by the phase separation of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI. We estimated the phase separation length scale ξ of those referential binary blends using ξ = 2π/qmode. The length scale of 44 nm is found for the film without annealing. The treated film shows a peak at q = 0.033 nm−1, and the calculated length scale is 190 nm, which is greatly increased compared to the film without TA treatment. The enhancement of phase purity by TA treatment can be also obtained by calculating the total scattering intensity through the integration of the scattering profiles over the q range and taking film thickness into account.33–36 The untreated film with a purity of 0.75 and the 110 °C TA treated film with a purity of 1 were obtained. It should be noted that the purity of 110 °C TA treated film set to 100% here is only for comparison. The enlarged domain size and phase purity confirm that thermal annealing can drive the phase separation process and improve phase purity.

We speculate that there may be similar morphology evolutions with other D:A ratios. To test our speculation, the phase diagram is depicted for the blend system with varying blend ratios and TA temperature. As shown in Fig. 7 (taking the D:A ratio 6:4 as an example), the pristine film shows amorphous morphology as described before. At low TA temperature (below 90 °C), the film maintains a uniform structure without obvious phase separation. With the increase of TA temperature, the phase separation becomes more obvious and exhibits a bi-continuous phase separation structure until 130 °C. At TA temperature beyond 140 °C, the film presents a large phase separation structure. The observation is consistent with the XRD, UV-vis absorption and fluorescence spectra. The film morphology evolutions demonstrate that proper temperature TA treatment can assist the formation of a bi-continuous phase separation structure. For the whole phase diagram (the AFM images are shown in Fig. S5, ESI†), the bi-continuous structure can be constructed at the D:A ratio of 7:3, 6:4 and 5:5 at TA temperature 90–140 °C, 100–130 °C, 100–110 °C, respectively. For lower TA temperature (90 °C for 7:3, 100 °C for 6:4 and 100 °C for 5:5), the films exhibit uniform morphology without an obvious phase separation structure. For higher TA temperature (140 °C for 7:3, 130 °C for 6:4 and 110 °C for 5:5), the films exhibit large phase separation morphology. For other D:A ratios, the as-deposited films exhibit a large phase separation structure.

Here, we can conclude that the film morphology is crucially dependent on the phase transition, crystallization, and liquid–liquid or solid–liquid phase separation. In this crystalline–crystalline small molecule blend system, the phase separation structure is sensitive to the TA temperature, which regulates the molecule diffusion in the blend film. We summarize the phase separation mechanism as Scheme 2. When the D:A ratio is larger than 8:2, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 molecules self-assemble into fibrous crystals impelling the liquid–solid phase separation during the spin-coating process. Similarly, when the D:A ratio is smaller than 4:6, EP-PDI molecules self-assemble into massive crystals leading to liquid–solid phase separation during the spin-coating process. When the D:A ratio is between 7:3 and 5:5, the blending films exhibit no obvious phase separation structure due to the good compatibility between EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. When TA is below Tm(EP-PDI) + Ta, the homogeneous mixtures cannot overcome the energy barrier to nucleate a new phase, and thus the film still has a uniform structure. When the annealing temperature (T) is in the range of Tm(EP-PDI) + Ta < T < Tc(p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) − Tb, p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 crystallizes to form a continuous framework, leading to solid–liquid phase separation. Under this condition, EP-PDI is in the melting state (liquid state), but p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 is in the solid state. Thus the diffusion coefficient of EP-PDI will be much larger than the diffusion coefficient of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2. In this circumstance, the EP-PDI molecules in the melting state self-assemble into nanocrystals in the confinement of the p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 framework and connect with each other to form a continuous network during the cooling process. Thus we constructed a bi-continuous phase separation structure with proper domain size through the accurate control of the thermal annealing temperature. If the temperature is beyond Tc(p-DTS(FBTTh2)2) − Tb, the diffusion coefficient will further increase. As a result, EP-PDI will break through the framework of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, forming large scale aggregates. We summarize that the proper TA temperature for constructing a bi-continuous phase separation structure with proper phase purity is meeting the equation below:Tm(EP-PDI) + 30 °C < T(TA) < rEP-PDITm(EP-PDI) + rp-DTS(FBTTh2)2Tcp-DTS(FBTTh2)2 − 10 °CHere, r is the ratio of the components. The discrepancy between the crystallization temperature of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and intermediate TA temperature can be explained on two grounds. On the one hand, in the actual crystallization process, the crystallization temperature is always lower than the theoretical crystallization temperature, that is supercooling phenomenon. On the other hand, the existence of EP-PDI makes the balanced crystallization temperature downshifted as demonstrated in the DSC profile of Fig. 1(A). For the intermediate temperature, EP-PDI is in the melting state and diffuses more freely than p-DTS(FBTTh2)2, but the interaction between each other is very strong, which may also lower the temperature for p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 to crystallize. Under this condition, the melting EP-PDI acts as a lubricant in the blend. Similar rules may apply to other crystalline small molecule blends for the intrinsic molecule properties with significant discrepancy.

Photovoltaic performance for devices of films with different morphologies
We have found an interesting morphological evolution of EP-PDI and p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 blends from uniform morphology to a bi-continuous structure and large scale phase separation by raising TA temperature. Photovoltaic devices with those varying morphologies are prepared, with hugely different performance. The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of devices for all thermal annealing temperatures display an obvious trend of increase at first and then a decrease consistent with the morphology evolutions.

Fig. 8(A) displays the photocurrent–voltage (J–V) curves of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI BHJ OPV devices for as-deposited and TA treated films under simulated AM 1.5 Sun illumination (here we chose the D:A ratio 6:4 as an example, the performance with other ratios is shown in Fig. S6, ESI†). The as-deposited device exhibits extremely low photovoltaic performance with a VOC of 0.68 V, a JSC of 0.39 mA cm−2, a FF of 0.40, and a PCE of 0.11%. The low JSC and FF value can be attributed to the lack of enough exciton separation driving force and charge transport channels in structurally disordered BHJ morphology. The device performance is presented in Table 1. At low TA temperature, no obvious phase separation structure can be detected, and the device performance is at a low level. With increasing TA temperature, the films gradually form a bi-continuous structure with intermediate domain size, and the JSC value enhances remarkably to 9.05 mA cm−2 and the FF value reaches 0.59, resulting in an efficiency as high as 4.25%. The phase separation provides enough driving force to separate the excitons, and the free carriers can transport along the bi-continuous pathway, resulting in increased JSC and FF. All these processes are facilitated due to the improvement of film morphology. However, when the temperature is higher than 140 °C, the film undergoes large scale phase separation, and the device performance drops rapidly to 1.42%. This is because a huge number of excitons cannot transport to the interface and transit to the lower energy intermolecular state or recombine to the ground state. Intriguingly, even the bi-continuous morphology film device exhibited different device performance, which may originate from the phase purity as mentioned above.

The external quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements for devices based on as-deposited film and films subjected to TA treatment at different temperatures are displayed in Fig. 8(B). The relative magnitudes of the EQE spectra correlate well with the JSC values determined from the J–V curves. The EQE value of post-treated devices exhibits prominent improvement in the wavelength ranging from 450 nm to 700 nm, which overlaps with the optical absorption spectra of both p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI. The best device processed at 110 °C exhibits a maximum value of approximately 50% while the EQE of the device processed based on the pristine film never exceeds 7%.24 The significant enhancement of photon absorption efficiency can be attributed to the enhanced solid order of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI and the formation of a bi-continuous network.
Conclusion
In summary, we constructed the phase diagram according to different blend ratios and thermal annealing temperatures of the crystalline–crystalline small molecule blend system. When the weight ratio of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI is greater than 8:2 or smaller than 4:6, a large phase separation structure is observed due to solid–liquid phase separation induced by crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 or EP-PDI. When the ratio of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2/EP-PDI is between 7:3 and 5:5, a homogeneous film was obtained due to the strong molecule interaction of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 and EP-PDI. We constructed a bi-continuous phase separation morphology through the prior crystallization of p-DTS(FBTTh2)2 inducing phase separation, which spatially confined the molecule diffusion range of EP-PDI. Finally, based on the bi-continuous phase separation structure obtained, a power conversion efficiency of 4.25% was achieved. Importantly, we revealed the relationship between blend film morphologies and the intrinsic molecule properties. Similar rules may be applied to other crystalline small molecule blends.
