    , Accepted 31st August 2021First published on 18th September 2021AbstractHigh-quality electron transport layers (ETLs) are essential for stable and efficient perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Metal sulfides (MSs) are considered potential candidates for ETLs due to their high carrier mobility, low cost, and favorable chemical and physical stability. The quality of the MS films plays important role in the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. However, few reports focus on the relative preparation, characteristics, and corresponding mechanisms of MS-based ETLs. In this review, MS-based ETLs are summarized according to their preparation strategies and the mechanism. We hope that this review can help others understand the intrinsic phenomena of MS-based ETLs and motivate further investigations.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials have the ABX3 crystal structure, where A = MA+(CH3NH3+), FA+(NHCHNH3+) or Cs+, B = Pb2+ or Sn2+, C = I−, Br− or Cl−.1 Due to their outstanding photoelectric properties, such as adjustable bandgap,2 high molar absorption coefficient,3,4 long carrier diffusion distance,5,6 and the achievement of the record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.5%8 from 3.8%7 to in just over a decade, which is comparable with those of silicon-based solar cells, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are considered a “game-changer” in the photovoltaic field.9 PSCs usually are fabricated with classical sandwich structures, which consist of a transparent conductive oxide (TCO)/glass substrate, electrical transport layers (ETLs), perovskite absorption layers, hole transport layers (HTLs), and counter electrodes (CEs), as shown in Fig. 1. According to the charge transfer direction, PSCs can be classified as normal n–i–p and invert p–i–n architectures. When photons are incident on the perovskite, those with higher energy than the bandgap of the perovskite are absorbed, and excitons are produced. The excitons are further dissociated into photo-generated electrons (e−) and photo-generated holes (h+).10 Then, they are extracted by ETLs and HTLs and transported to the electrodes to generate a photocurrent.

As an essential part of PSCs, ETLs do not only play a role in the extraction and transport of the photo-generated electrons, but also act as a hole-blocking layer that inhibits hole–electron recombination.11–13 To achieve the above effects, ETLs should possess the following characteristics: (I) a suitable conduction band (CB) helps ETLs achieve favorable energy level alignment (ELA) with the perovskite layer; (II) a wide bandgap enables ETLs to be color-free and allows enough light absorption for the perovskite in the n–i–p architecture; (III) high electron mobility in ETLs is beneficial to fast charge transport;14 (IV) ETLs should establish good interfacial contact with the perovskite layer to avoid current leakage; (V) they need to be cost-effective and have chemical and physical stability.15
State-of-the-art metal oxides (MOs), fullerene and its derivatives (FDs), and metal sulfides (MSs) are employed as ETLs. TiO2,16 SnO2,17,18 and ZnO19 are the typical representatives of MO ETLs. Some of the ETLs are synthesized with high energy consuming;20 some of them faced low electron mobility;21–23 and the stability of some introduced unstable factors to the interfaces with perovskite.19,24,25 FDs are generally applied in invert p–i–n PSCs owing to their high electron mobility and conductivity.26 However, their poor moisture tolerance and high price limit the commercial applications of these PSCs.27
Because of their excellent photoelectric properties originating from the valence electron shell structure on the 3d orbital, MS-based ETLs have been widely applied in PSCs. Compared with FDs and MOs, MSs demonstrate great advantages. Firstly, the excellent electron transport mobility of MSs can facilitate charge extraction and transport, suppressing charge accumulation and recombination at the ETLs/perovskite interfaces.28 Secondly, most MS-based ETLs can be prepared by a low-temperature process, which is energy-efficient and compatible with flexible substrates.29,30 Thirdly, MSs are wide-bandgap materials without oxygen vacancies, thus facilitating the high optical stability of PSCs.29 Finally, because of the strong binding energy between MSs and perovskites, ionic migration in perovskites could be blocked or eliminated.31 The summary of the physical and optoelectronic parameters of different MSs have been shown in Table 1. Although a number of MS-based ETLs have been reported, no exclusive review has been published yet.

In this review, all MS-based ETLs in PSCs are systematically summarized, and the preparation techniques used for MS-based ETLs are classified based on the use of solvent and non-solvent systems. In addition, the characteristics of mono-MS ETLs and MS-modified ETLs have been discussed, respectively. Finally, the outlooks on MS-based ETLs are proposed. This work will facilitate further research and application of MS-based ETLs in PSCs and other related fields.
2. The ETL deposition techniques
The preparation techniques of MS-based ETLs are divided into solvent-based and non-solvent-based techniques. Solvent-based techniques, mainly including chemical bath deposition (CBD), spin-coating, spray-coating, and liquid-phase in situ growth, are usually considered convenient. In contrast to the solvent-based techniques, the non-solvent-based techniques prevent the substrate from damage induced by the solvent. In the following section, each deposition method is analyzed in detail, along with various relevant parameters that have effects on MS-based ETLs.
2.1. Solvent-based techniques

2.1.1. CBD technique. 
CBD is a typical solvent-based technique, which can be conducted at low temperatures (even room temperature) with simple reaction equipment, as shown in Fig. 2a. Thereby, the energy consumption is less and the experiment operation is simple. To fabricate MS-based ETLs by the CBD technique, the substrates should be immersed in the precursor solution containing metal cations, S2− anions, and a complexant. Several state-of-the-art MS-based ETLs have been synthesized by the CBD technique, including CdS,53 ZnS,54 In2S3,55 and Sb2S3.52 Despite the types of MS-based ETLs, their properties mainly depend on the raw materials, reaction time, and annealing temperature.

The concentration and raw material components contribute to the morphology and thickness of MS-based ETLs, which are crucial for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs.56,57 Wang et al. investigated the role of the concentration of urea as the complexant in the growth of CdS films.58 The result demonstrated that the grain size and uniformity of the films were affected by urea concentration, and they gained compact CdS thin films with good grain sizes with 1.5 M urea. This resulted in better coverage of perovskites on CdS and was beneficial to efficient charge separation and transport. Moreover, the devices retained about 70% of the initial PCE after 600 s under constant light illumination, while the counterpart retained a mere 16.6%. A thick MS-based film is averse to light absorption by the perovskite in normal n–i–p PSCs, while if it is too thin, the current leakage would increase because of the gaps. Kim et al. prepared ultra-thin CdS ETLs by using n-methylthiourea (NMT). They compared the differences between NMT and commonly utilized thiourea in the synthesis of ultrathin CdS.59 CdS ETLs with good coverage could be obtained with a thickness of 50 nm under 16 min reaction time by employing thiourea as the S source, while a further reduction in thickness led to terrible performance. However, NMT-based production achieved full perovskite coverage at the thickness of 30 nm under the same reaction time. The lower the thickness, the higher is the transmittance. The UV-vis absorption and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra indicated that the PSCs based on NMT-prepared CdS ETLs reduced the current leakage, resulting in higher Jsc.
The reaction time of CBD also influences the morphology and thickness of the MS-based ETLs. Tong et al. precisely controlled the thickness of CdS films deposited on FTO by changing the reaction time of CBD, leading to different transmittance, as shown in Fig. 2b.60 Peng et al. demonstrated that the thicker the CdS films are, the lower is the transmittance of the substrate. By balancing the quality and transmittance of the films, devices based on 60 nm CdS ETLs achieved a champion efficiency of 16.10%. Due to the decreased surface defects in CdS films, the relevant devices could retain about 92% of the initial PCE after 10 h of continuous UV illumination. Hou et al. also regulated the morphology of In2S3 films by the reaction time of CBD, as shown in Fig. 2c.55 They tracked the growth of In2S3 in detail and divided the growth into a primary nucleation reaction (within 0.5 h) and the post-growth of the crystal. They obtained a uniform In2S3 nanosheet array (thickness less than 20 nm) after 2 h reaction time. The device achieved an increased PCE of 18.22%. The extended time resulted in a curled and irregular morphology, which was not conducive to perovskite deposition. Such morphology could be attributed to the Ostwald ripening process-induced integration of the In2S3 nanosheets.
Generally, high-temperature annealing treatment helps the films achieve better crystallization. However, Abulikemu et al. demonstrated that CdS-based ETLs cracked after the high-temperature annealing treatment (Fig. 2d).56 The series resistance of the cracked CdS films was high at the CdS/perovskite interfaces, giving rise to decreased short-circuit current density (Jsc) and lower fill factors (FF) in PSCs.
Successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) is an extension of the CBD technique, as shown in Fig. 2e. Firstly, substrates are inserted into the precursor solution with metal cations; secondly, the weakly adsorbed ions and particles on the surface are washed by deionized water. Then, the substrates are immersed in a precursor solution containing the sulfur source, allowed to react and rinsed again with deionized water to complete a cycle.61 The thickness of the MS films can be varied by the number of cycles. The films deposited by this method usually possess poor crystallinity and abundant surface defects,62 which are not suitable for the direct deposition of ETLs on substrates. This method can be used for interfacial modification; a modifying layer is formed on the substrate by the reaction of the ions adsorbed on the rough or mesoporous surface.63,64 Since the adsorption process is indispensable, usually mesoporous TiO2 is used as the substrate to prepare MSs-based ETLs by the SILAR technique. Hwang et al. firstly employed the SILAR technique to deposit CdS on mesoporous TiO2 and obtained CdS/TiO2 ETLs. The thickness of the modifying layer illustrated a linear relationship with the SILAR cycles.65 The TEM image in Fig. 2f reveals that there was a CdS film (about 2 nm) on the surface of TiO2 with a core–shell structure.61 Givalou et al. investigated the relationship between the cycle number and PCE. They found that the PCE of PSCs enhanced with an increase in the number of cycles.66


2.1.2. Spin-coating technique. 
The spin-coating technique spreads the precursors on the substrates rapidly using centrifugal force, and then removes the excess precursors off the substrate to obtain a uniform film, as shown in Fig. 3a. According to h = kηβ/ωp (h is the thickness of the film, ω is the angular velocity, η is the dynamic viscosity of the solution, k is a constant, and exponents p and β are the fitting coefficients), the properties of films prepared by the spin-coating technique are mainly dependent on two factors: spin speed and precursors.67

Form the equation, ωp is inversely proportional to the thickness of films, and higher thickness leads to MS ETLs with poor transmittance. Dong et al. synthesized uniformly and stably dispersed CdS nanoparticles in toluene by the solvothermal reaction.68 Subsequently, CdS-based ETLs were prepared by the spin-coating technique. Fig. 3b shows the top-view SEM images of CdS-based ETLs obtained at different spin speeds. At lower spin speeds, the CdS precursors did not fully cover the substrates due to uneven distribution, resulting in direct contact between the perovskite and the FTO substrate. The uneven distribution could be avoided at higher spin speeds (6000 to 8000 rpm). In addition, the higher the spin speed, the thinner was the film thickness, and the higher was the transmittance of CdS ETLs. After optimization, the normal n–i–p PSCs prepared with spin-coated CdS ETLs got a champion PCE of 16.50%. Similarly, Jia et al. prepared CdS ETLs by spin-coating for planar PSCs with the invert p–i–n architecture and achieved a PCE of 13.36% after optimizing the spin speed.69 The relevant devices could maintain about 85% of the initial PCE after 144 h storage under ambient conditions. Huang et al. obtained dense and pinhole-free In2S3-based ETLs by optimizing the spin speed of the In2S3 precursors.49 High spin speeds (exceeding 3000 rpm) led to In2S3 ETLs of insufficient thickness, and the surface of the In2S3 ETLs was relatively rough and resulted in poor contact with the perovskite layer. Therefore, the inorganic PSCs without HTLs (FTO/In2S3/CsPbBr3/carbon) exhibited a champion PCE (5.83%) when the spin speed was under 3000 rpm.

 depends on the nature of the precursor, which can be influenced by its concentration. Yu et al. investigated the influence of the In2S3 precursor concentration on In2S3 ETLs deposited by the spin-coating technique.70 The results demonstrated that the higher the concentration of the precursors, the thicker were the In2S3 films, the worse was the transmittance. Fig. 3c shows that, with an increase in precursor concentration, the In2S3 films sharply lost transmittance in the range of 300–500 nm due to the narrow bandgap of In2S3, decreasing the Jsc of PSCs and exhibiting a PCE of 15.48%. In addition to preparing mono MS ETLs, it is possible to prepare MS-modified ETLs using doped precursors. Zheng et al. prepared core–shell ETLs with different ZnO/ZnS ratios by the spin-coating technique.51 As shown in Fig. 3d, the surface morphology of the ZnO/ZnS heterojunction was more uniform than that of pure ZnO, which was conducive to perovskite deposition. Thus, PCE (13.7%) of relevant PSCs was higher than its pure ZnO counterpart. Recently, Sanglee et al. reported the preparation of TiO2/CdS mixed ETLs by doping CdS QDs into the TiO2 precursor.71 The TEM images demonstrated obvious lattice fringes of the CdS (111) and (220) planes, which confirmed the formation of the CdS/TiO2 heterostructure. Because of the fast charge transport of CdS, the Jsc and PCE of the PSCs significantly improved.


2.1.3. Spray-coating technique. 
Spray-coating is a straightforward technique for film preparation (Fig. 4a). A simple pneumatic spray gun atomizes the precursor with a high-pressure carrier gas, and the droplets are further driven by the carrier gas to the substrate and dried to form the film.48 The main factors affecting the quality of spray-coated MS-based ETLs are substrate temperature and precursor volume.
 Fig. 4  (a) Schematic diagram of the spray-coating technique; (b) morphology of the MoS2 nanosheets prepared at different substrate temperatures.72 [Reproduced from ref. 72 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2020.] (c) Nyquist plots of PSCs based on WS2 ETLs of different thicknesses under light conditions.73 [Reproduced from ref. 73 with permission from Wiley-VCH, copyright 2020.] (d) Top-view SEM images of MoS2 nanosheet ETLs deposited on FTO substrates by spray-coating (left) and spin-coating (right).74 [Reproduced from ref. 74 with permission from Elsevier, copyright 2020.]. 
Abd Malek et al. prepared MoS2 ETLs via the spray-coating technique.72 As shown in Fig. 4b, the film quality significantly depended on the substrate temperature. They demonstrated that when the temperature was too low, the solvent did not fully evaporate, resulting in uneven crystallization. However, when the temperature was too high, the situation significantly changed. The solvent completely evaporated before reaching the substrate, generating nanoparticle by-products. Therefore, the fabrication of high-quality MS-based ETLs by the spray-coating technique required the substrate temperature to be controlled at an appropriate value. Subsequently, the same group investigated the effects of precursor volume on spray-coating.73 The results showed that the thickness of WS2 ETLs linearly depended on the precursor volume. If the volume of the precursor was less, the WS2 ETLs were too thin, which would lead to incomplete coverage and current leakage. However, when the WS2 ETLs were too thick, it gave rise to an increase in trap density and charge transport resistance (Fig. 4c), leading to loss of FF and Voc. Finally, PSCs based on WS2 ETLs prepared with 0.3 mL precursor solution exhibited the best PCE.
To demonstrate the difference between the spray-coating and spin-coating techniques, Mahmood et al. prepared two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 ETLs by the two techniques.74 As shown in Fig. 4d, spray-coated MoS2 ETLs demonstrated better coverage and layer-by-layer connection among the nanosheets than its spin-coated counterpart. Due to the uniform surface and excellent surface contact of spray-coated MoS2 ETLs, fast carrier extraction in the vertical direction was achieved. Therefore, the relevant PSCs displayed a high PCE of 16.17%, while its spin-coated counterpart showed 13.93%. The PSCs based on electrospray-deposited MoS2 ETLs could maintain 93% of the initial PCE after 700 h storage. Additionally, compared with the spin-coating technique, the spray-coating technique dramatically reduced material waste, hence lowering the cost.75 Meanwhile, because film deposition is not driven by centrifugal force, the spray-coating technique makes depositing large-scale films with uniform morphology easier, while this is difficult to achieve using the spin-coating technique.76,77


2.1.4. Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique. 
Langmuir–Blodgett (LB) technique is an effective and practical deposition technique for transferring monolayers of different materials from the gas–liquid interface to solid substrates (Fig. 5a).78,79 It is widely used to deposit thin films composed of organic molecules, polymers, nanosheets, and other materials.80 Zhao et al. deposited SnS2 films and controlled film thickness through the LB technique.45 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 5b) showed that the SnS2 film surface was highly smooth with a root mean square (RMS) roughness of only 0.31 nm, which was beneficial to perovskite layer deposition because of the reduced defect at the interface of ETLs and perovskite layer. The relevant device achieved a PCE of 20.12%, along with a high Jsc of 23.55 mA cm−2. Further, it retained 90% of its initial PCE after 600 h storage under room temperature with 30–40% RH, while its counterpart retained only 60%.

2.1.5. Liquid-phase in situ growth technique. 
Annealing treatment usually helps enhance the quality of MS-based ETLs fabricated by CBD, spin-coating, or spray-coating. However, annealing often damages the special morphological structures (such as nanowires and nanoflowers), lowering the electron transport performance of MS-based ETLs. Therefore, the liquid-phase in situ growth technique, as a morphology-controlling method, has been proposed. In situ grown MS crystals on the TCO substrate cannot only maintain their nanostructure, but also realize seamless contact with the TCO layer, diminishing the resistance of electrons moving from ETLs to TCO. The in situ growth technique can be divided into solvothermal (including hydrothermal) method and microwave method.
Gu et al. first synthesized CdS nanorods (CdS NRs) in situ on ITO substrates using a solvothermal method.82Fig. 6a illustrates the main steps of the solvothermal method. The TCO substrate is placed in the reactor, and the reaction is conducted under high temperature and/or pressure. Being similar to CBD, the morphology and thickness of MSs ETLs can be determined by the reaction time. Song et al. investigated the effect of reaction time on CdS NRs morphology.81 According to the SEM images in Fig. 6b, the hexagonal prism CdS NRs had greatly enhanced contact area with the perovskite layer, and the relevant device achieved a PCE of 12.46%. Our group employed a hydrothermal method to grow 2D SnS2 ETLs in situ on FTO substrates.46Fig. 6c shows that the surface morphology of SnS2 ETLs changed under different growth times. In the beginning, the SnS2 ETLs evolved from nuclei to small and irregular nanosheets. Homogeneous and compact SnS2 films were obtained after 4 h. Then, as the reaction time increased, the SnS2 film became progressively thicker, which was beneficial to block the holes and suppress carrier recombination (Fig. 6d). When the reaction time was over 6 h, the SnS2 nanosheets began to aggregate and displayed a spherical flower-like morphology. Such a morphology would limit the penetration of the MAPbI3 solution, inhibiting the formation of the perovskite. After the optimization of the reaction time (5.5 h), the device achieved the highest PCE of 13.63%.

Different from the solvothermal method, the microwave method powers the reaction system by microwave irrigation. Singh et al. synthesized uniform MoS2 ETLs in situ on the FTO substrate by the microwave method (Fig. 6e).34 Compared with TiO2 and SnO2, the MoS2 films obtained were highly transparent and vertically conductive, yielding a PCE of 13.1% with high Jsc (21.7 mA cm−2).

2.2. Non-solvent-based techniques
Non-solvent-based techniques mainly include thermal evaporation and atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. As shown in Fig. 7a, in the thermal evaporation technique, the target material evaporates directly onto the substrate by continuous heating in a vacuum. The thermal evaporation technique has two merits: one is that it is compatible with industrial-scale manufacturing of uniform films; the other is that the thickness of the films can be accurately recorded and regulated in real-time by integrating the deposition rate of the target material.83,84 The ALD technique has almost the same advantages as the thermal evaporation technique. However, the mechanism of ALD is different; the target materials are deposited by a chemical reaction in ALD, and the thickness of the film can be controlled at the Ångstrom or monolayer level.85
 Fig. 7  (a) Schematic diagram of thermal evaporation technique; (b) AFM image of a-Bi2S3 film.50 [Reproduced from ref. 50 with permission from American Chemical Society, copyright 2016.] (c) Schematic diagram of the deposition of the ZnS layer by the ALD technique.87 [Reproduced from ref. 87 with permission from Royal Society of Chemistry, copyright 2019.]. 
Li et al. employed the thermal evaporation technique to deposit Bi2S3 as ETLs in PSCs with an invert p–i–n architecture.50 The AFM result in Fig. 7b indicates that the Bi2S3 film was dense, flat, and pinhole-free. Although Bi2S3 transformed from large crystals into an amorphous film (a-Bi2S3) after thermal evaporation, it still exhibited extremely high carrier mobility and lower trap state density. However, Chu et al. obtained contrary results. They revealed that thermal evaporation did not change the crystal lattice and relevant parameters in the SnS2 film. The SnS2 film showed compact and uniform morphology after thermal evaporation, which was conducive to enhancing the performance of flexible PSCs.86
Chavan et al. deposited ZnS onto the TiO2 layer as an ETL via the ALD technique.87Fig. 7c depicts the schematic diagram of the ALD technique, in which Zn(C2H5)2 and H2S were utilized as precursors for ZnS deposition. The reaction, Zn(C2H5)2(g) + H2S → ZnS(s) + 2C2H6(g), was carried out in the ALD chamber. MS-based ETLs became denser and thicker with an increase in deposition cycles. The results indicated that the optimal ZnS layer thickness of 1.8 nm could promote charge extraction and suppress interfacial recombination, thus enhancing Voc and FF, and the device based on mesoporous (mp)-TiO2/ZnS achieved a PCE of 19.1%.
3. ETLs with mono-MSs
Due to the superior optical and electrical properties of MSs, PSCs based on mono-MSs achieve both high photovoltaic performance and stability. In this part, we divide mono-MSs into transition metal disulfides (TMDs) and non-transition metal disulfides (NTMDs) to discuss their characteristics. The detailed parameters of relevant devices based on mono-MSs ETLs are summarized in Table 2.

3.1. TMDs as ETLs
TMD materials are represented by the chemical formula MS2, where M is a transition metal (such as Mo and W).88 In recent years, the application of TMDs in PSCs is on the rise because of their high carrier mobility, unique optoelectronic properties, and excellent physical and chemical stability. TMDs demonstrate an excellent ultra-fast charge transfer and extraction process, thus realizing efficient photovoltaics.89 Most 2D TMDs possess bipolar characteristics, that is, both electron and hole transport. However, they can only exhibit n-type characteristics upon controlling the layer numbers or doping, which provides the possibility for TMDs as ETLs in PSCs.90 In this part, we discuss the application of various TMD ETLs.

3.1.1. MoS2. 
MoS2 films possess good transparency in the visible light region (400–900 nm), as well as high conductivity and charge mobility. Singh et al. first reported PSCs fabricated with MoS2 ETLs.34 Compared with TiO2 and SnO2 ETLs, the MoS2 ETLs demonstrated similar work function (WF) and better conductivity (Fig. 8a), resulting in effective charge transport and extraction. Thus, the corresponding device achieved a PCE of 13.14%. Mahmood et al. deposited vertical MoS2 nanosheet films on FTO substrates and utilized them as ETLs in PSCs. The MoS2 nanosheets illustrated uniform surface and full coverage, which was beneficial to perovskite deposition. Additionally, the vertical MoS2 nanosheets significantly enhanced the surface contact with the perovskite layer, thereby promoting vertical carrier extraction. The relevant device accomplished a PCE of 16.17%. The unique morphology and nanostructures of MoS2 could suppress the decay of perovskite, which aided the device in retaining above 93% of the initial PCE after 700 h storage under ambient conditions.74

3.1.2. WS2. 
WS2 nanosheets possess high carrier mobility, excellent conductivity, and tunable energy bandgap.91 Actually, WS2 is a native n-type semiconductor. Sobayel et al.92 and Kumar et al.93 confirmed the feasibility of WS2 ETLs in PSCs via numerical simulations. Their investigations indicated that the PCE of the relevant devices might reach up to 25.70% and 23.0%, respectively. Subsequently, Abd Malek et al. illustrated PSCs fabricated with WS2 ETLs. The WS2 ETLs did not only effectively promote the interfacial carrier transfer (Fig. 8b), but also suppressed recombination in both bulk and the interfaces of the PSCs.73 Therefore, these PSCs generated a PCE of 18.21%. The devices also presented good stability, retaining 96.87% of the initial performance after 33 days of storage under an N2 atmosphere.


3.1.3. TiS2. 
TiS2 is expected to be a good ETL candidate for PSCs due to its high mobility, excellent physical and chemical stability, and low-cost fabrication process. Yin et al. reported the application of 2D TiS2 ETLs in PSCs.38 The TiS2 ETLs demonstrated comparable electron transport and extraction ability to TiO2 ETLs. However, TiS2 possessed a suitable CB of −4.02 eV, which facilitated better ELA with the perovskite, leading to enhanced Voc. Therefore, PSCs based on TiS2 ETLs obtained a higher PCE (17.37%) than that using TiO2 ETLs (17.07%). More importantly, the TiS2 ETL-based PSCs illustrated higher UV stability than its TiO2 ETLs counterpart due to poor photocatalytic activity. After soaking under 10 mW cm−2 UV light for 50 h, the TiS2 ETL-based PSC retained 90% of its initial PCE. Huang et al. revealed that UV-Ozone treatment can induce a surprising increase in the PCE of PSCs based on TiS2 ETLs.40 The XPS results proved that the TiS2 surface was partially oxidized because of the UV-Ozone treatment, resulting in S vacancy passivation and a change in WF (Fig. 8c); thus, the PCE under optimal conditions was 18.79%. Meanwhile, due to the reduced S vacancies, the relevant device without encapsulation showed outstanding stability and could maintain above 95% of the initial PCE after 816 h storage under atmospheric conditions with 10% RH.


3.1.4. TaS2. 
Due to high electrical conductivity,94,95 suitable energy level position, and fewer defects, TaS2 nanosheets have been utilized in PSCs and exhibit good performance. Afzali et al. synthesized TaS2 and applied it as ETLs in PSCs.41 TaS2 is completely transparent in the visible light region and exhibits good electrical conductivity and WF. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay curve in Fig. 8d indicates that PSCs fabricated with TaS2 ETLs showed better charge transport at the ETL/perovskite interface than TiO2 and SnO2, resulting in a PCE of 15.23%. These PSCs based also showed excellent light stability and UV stability due to the elimination of oxygen defects. The corresponding device retained 90% of its initial PCE after 500 h of continuous light soaking.

3.2. NTMDs as ETLs
NTMDs are important inorganic semiconductor materials with unique optical and electrical properties. They are used as ETLs due to their wide bandgap, suitable conduction band, and excellent carrier mobility. In addition, NTMDs hold good stability and are low-cost. In this section, we will discuss the application of NTMD ETLs in PSCs.

3.2.1. CdS. 
CdS has attracted extensive attention in the PSC field due to its high carrier mobility, low surface defects, simple processing, and low cost.96–98 Compared with TiO2, CdS has better carrier extraction and less recombination at the CdS/perovskite interface (Fig. 9a).99 Juarez-Perez et al. first devised PSCs based on CdS ETLs, but they obtained a poor PCE of 1.53%.100 Gu et al. prepared CdS NRs as ETLs for PSCs.82 Their investigations illustrated that UV-Ozone treatment could reduce the surface roughness of CdS NRs, change WF from −3.70 eV to −3.89 eV, and fill the S vacancies with oxygen atoms, reducing the defects in CdS ETLs (Fig. 9b) and thereby enhancing charge transport at the CdS/perovskite interface. Therefore, the relevant PSCs attained an 8.36% PCE. Liu et al. fabricated carbon-based PSCs (C-PSCs) using CdS ETLs and modified the CdS/perovskite interfaces with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM).101 The results demonstrated that the PC61BM modification promoted carrier separation at the ETLs/perovskite interface and inhibited recombination, enhancing the FF of the device; thus, the PCE of the corresponding device improved to 14.28%. Dong et al. prepared CdS ETLs under low temperature for PSCs and obtained PCE over 16%. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra in Fig. 9c reveal that the high PCE can be attributed to the outstanding electron extraction and transportability of the CdS ETLs.68 In addition, the high-quality CdS ETLs obtained by the low-temperature process also provide an opportunity to build efficient flexible PSCs. Tong et al. prepared flexible PSCs based on CdS ETLs under low temperature, and the device obtained a PCE of 9.9%.60 Sivaprakasam et al. fabricated CdS films in a low-temperature process, and the relevant device achieved a PCE of 11.69%. Their results illustrated that increased microstrain, dislocation, and series resistance can influence the performance of PSCs.102

Different from TiO2 ETLs, CdS ETLs have no oxygen vacancies; thus, they well-resolve the stability problems induced by oxygen vacancies. According to the report of Hwang et al., PSCs with CdS ETLs possessed excellent optical stability. After continuous illumination for 12 h, the efficiency of the PSCs remained above 90% of the initial value, while that with TiO2 retained only 18% (Fig. 9d).99 Dunlap-Shohl et al. revealed that Cd might diffuse into MAPbI3 to form MA2CdI4 at the CdS/MAPbI3 interface during PSC operation, thus forming a carrier transport barrier and leading to performance loss.57 Amaya Suazo et al. deposited the inorganic double perovskite Cs2SnI6 on CdS ETLs and observed a similar phenomenon.53 Thus, it is necessary to develop strategies to inhibit the diffusion of Cd. However, Zhao et al. found that the introduction of CdS reduced the halide vacancy defects and passivated the grain boundary of the perovskite. The relevant device achieved an improved PCE of 21.62%, and the unencapsulated device maintained 87.5% of the initial PCE after 410 h of storage under an N2 atmosphere.103


3.2.2. SnS2. 
SnS2 is a 2D n-type semiconductor with high carrier mobility (50 cm2 V−1 S−1) and a suitable bandgap.104 Our group first applied SnS2 ETLs in PSCs.46 Due to the proportional light transmittance and good electronic conductivity of 2D SnS2 nanosheets, the SnS2-based devices obtained a champion PCE of 13.63% with a high Jsc of 23.70 mA cm−2. However, the large energy level difference (0.3 eV) between the SnS2 ETLs and perovskite led to terrible energy loss, and thus the Voc of the device was about 0.9 V. In order to minimize the energy loss, SnS, which a higher CB and larger carrier mobility, was introduced into SnS2 (Fig. 9e). Due to the favorable ELA between the SnS2/SnS ETLs and perovskite, the Voc of the device based on the SnS2/SnS ETLs increased by 14.9% compared with that of the SnS2-based device, resulting in a higher PCE (18.08%). Meanwhile, PSCs based on the SnS2:SnS ETLs demonstrated satisfactory stability due to the S–Pb interaction between the ETLs and perovskite. After storing in the air with 10% RH for 500 h, it maintained 85% of its initial PCE.47 To improve the performance of the C-PSCs, sulfur-based compounds were introduced into the perovskite layer and HTLs, which could decrease the trap states of the perovskite film and accelerate the charge transformation and extraction, giving rise to improved PCE (15.38%). Further, the relevant device maintained 80% of the initial PCE after 700 h of storage at 80 °C with an RH of 45% ± 10%.105 Besides, Zhao et al. revealed that 2D multilayer SnS2 films could initiate the heterogeneous nucleation of perovskite precursors, leading to uniform grain-sized perovskite crystals.45 In addition, the S–Pb interaction between SnS2 and the perovskite lattice could passivate the interfacial trap states, thus inhibiting charge recombination, promoting electron extraction, and achieving a balanced transport of photo-generated electrons and holes. Therefore, the PCE of the device exceeded 20%. In addition, stability monitoring illustrated that the S–Pb interaction also contributed to the enhancement of stability. After 600 h of storage at room temperature with an RH of 30–40%, the device based on SnS2 ETLs could still retain 90% of the initial PCE, whereas its SnO2 ETLs counterpart retained only 60%. Chu et al. were the first to apply SnS2 to prepare flexible PSCs.86 Due to the uniform surface morphology and better ELA, the SnS2/perovskite interface supported rapid electron extraction and transport, thus obtaining 13.2% PCE (Fig. 9f). Stability measurements indicated that PSCs based on SnS2 ETLs retained 93% of the initial PCE after 30 days in an environment with 40–50% RH, whereas the ZnO counterpart retained only 70%.


3.2.3. In2S3. 
In2S3 has a CB at about −4.0 eV with high carrier mobility (17.6 cm2 V−1 S−1) and a wide bandgap of 2.51 eV; therefore, it has attracted extensive attention in photovoltaics research. Hou et al. first applied In2S3 nanosheets as ETLs in PSCs. Due to the faster trap-filling process and lower trap state density in perovskite films, the related devices obtained high PCE with low hysteresis (18.22%).55 Xu et al. prepared In2S3 ETLs for PSCs by spray-coating.48 Compared with TiO2, In2S3 was compact, smooth, and pinhole-free. Therefore, the devices based on In2S3 ETLs demonstrated lower electron injection barrier, trap state density (Fig. 9g), series resistance, and charge recombination at the In2S3 ETLs/perovskite interfaces. They reached a PCE of 18.83%, which was higher than that of the TiO2-based device. In addition, there were no oxygen vacancies on the surface of In2S3 ETLs, which resulted in low photocatalytic activity. Thus, the devices based on In2S3 showed excellent UV stability. They retained 81% of the initial PCE after soaking for 50 h under a 10 mW cm−2 UV light, while the TiO2 counterpart retained only 54%. Yang et al. investigated the application of In2S3 ETLs in inorganic PSCs.106 The introduction of In2S3 was beneficial to the ETLs/perovskite interfaces in achieving better ELA, lowering resistance, and suppressing carrier recombination. The higher carrier mobility of In2S3 reduced carrier accumulation at the ETLs/perovskite interfaces, which in turn decreased hysteresis, and the device based on CsPbIBr2 obtained a high PCE of 5.59%. Huang et al. applied In2S3 in the preparation of C-PSCs based on CsPbBr3.49 The champion device achieved the highest PCE of 5.83% due to suitable ELA and low recombination of carriers at the ETLs/perovskite interfaces, whereas the PSCs based on the TiO2 ETL counterpart exhibited 4.99% PCE. The device with In2S3 ETLs exhibited excellent stability and retained 92% of the initial PCE after exposure to air at 60 °C for 720 h.


3.2.4. Bi2S3. 
Bi2S3, with inherent high mobility, high electron conductivity, and stability, was used as ETLs in PSCs by Li et al.50 An amorphous Bi2S3 film was deposited on top of the FTO/NiOx/MAPbI3 substrate to achieve the invert p–i–n architecture. This device displayed a PCE of 13%, which is comparable with its PC61BM competitor. Because the amorphous Bi2S3 could effectively block oxygen and moisture from the environment, the device retained 80% of its initial PCE after 30 days in an environment with 50–70% RH (Fig. 9h).

4. ETLs with MS modification
A large number of studies have proven that introducing MSs into commonly used ETLs can also improve their performance and stability. In this section, we discuss MS-modified ETLs in PSCs. The relevant device parameters are summarized in Table 3.

4.1. MS-modified TiO2
TiO2 ETLs are usually criticized for their deep CB. MS modification has been proven to be an effective strategy to solve this problem.109 Shaikh et al. successfully modified TiO2 by depositing ZnS on it.110 The results showed that ZnS induced a significant energy level change, which prevented electrons from the CB of TiO2 from transferring back to the perovskite (Fig. 10a), thus inhibiting charge recombination and enhancing the Voc and PCE of PSCs. An Sn-based perovskite generally possesses a higher CB than its Pb-based counterparts. Hence, the interfacial recombination in Sn-based PSCs employing mono-TiO2 ETLs worsen, which leads to terrible Voc loss.111 Since the CB of ZnS (−3.5 eV) is between those of FASnI3 (−3.3 eV) and TiO2 (−4.2 eV), Ke et al. proposed cascading TiO2-ZnS ETLs in FASnI3-based PSCs.112 After ZnS modification, the photo-generated electrons from FASnI3 could be smoothly transferred to the TiO2 ETLs due to improved ELA. Meanwhile, the energy barrier formed at the TiO2/ZnS interface could effectively prevent charge recombination, resulting in an enhanced Voc and improved the PCE of the relevant device to 5.27%.

Defects are also crucial contributors to efficiency loss in PSCs based on TiO2 ETLs.113 Kumar et al. confirmed that SnS deposition between TiO2 and MAPbI3 could effectively passivate the defects. Therefore, the device based on SnS-modified TiO2 ETLs exhibited suppressed charge recombination and faster photogenerated-electron extraction, resulting in an improved PCE of 13.6%. The relevant devices maintained about 85% of the original PCE after 4 weeks of storage under ambient conditions with 30% RH. Recently, Alias et al. deposited an atom-thick TiS2 film along the (100) crystal plane of TiO2, and the relevant device obtained an enhanced PCE of 18.73%.37 The improvement in PCE could be attributed to better electronic coupling, which decreased the trap state density by about 9% and increased the carrier mobility by three orders of magnitude. Besides, inorganic PSCs based on CsPbBr3 are famous for their ultra-high Voc, while the multiple defects of TiO2 ETLs would cause great energy loss. Thus, Zhou et al. modified the high-defect TiO2 ETLs with MoS2 QDs. The photo-generated electrons produced in MoS2 QDs could eliminate the electron traps in the TiO2 ETLs, resulting in enhanced conductivity and reduced electron trap states.114 Due to the improved electron extraction and suppressed recombination at the ETL/CsPbBr3 interface, the Voc of C-PSC based on CsPbBr3 was as high as 1.615 V. Recently, they further deposited WS2 on TiO2 ETLs. Due to the weak interaction between WS2 and the perovskite, the interface tensile strain was reduced, causing the perovskite lattice to shrink and trap state density reduction.115 Thus, the Voc of the relevant device further increased to 1.70 V, which is the current record value for single-junction PSCs. Moreover, the device based on WS2 maintained above 80% of the initial PCE after 120 days of storage under 25 °C with 80% RH.
In addition, MSs act as co-sensitizers with perovskites. Ali et al. demonstrated that mixing CdS QDs with TiO2 contributed to the enhancement of photoelectric current in PSCs.116 IPCE spectroscopy revealed that the CdS QDs promoted the conversion of incident photons to current in the visible to near-infrared range in PSCs (Fig. 10b). Givalou et al. further confirmed that this improvement was due to the co-sensitivity of CdS QDs with perovskites.66 Ahmed et al. found that TiO2/MoS2 ETLs could also enable MAPbI3 to collect photons better in the lower wavelength regions, improving the light absorption of the device and hence leading to a higher Jsc.117
The photocatalysis-related oxygen vacancies on the surface of TiO2 ETLs easily adsorb oxygen and produce superoxide under light illumination. The superoxides have a strong oxidizing property and can decompose the perovskite in PSCs, resulting in rapid PCE loss.118,119 However, the inferior photocatalytic activity of MSs can help stabilize PSCs based on TiO2 ETLs. Hwang et al. coated a uniform CdS film on TiO2 (Fig. 10c).61 After 12 hours of light irrigation, PSCs based on TiO2–CdS ETLs retained nearly 80% of the initial efficiency, while PSCs based on mono-TiO2 ETLs retained only 40%. In addition, Wessendorf et al. proved that MSs also effectively shield ionic migration at the ETLs/perovskite interface by comparing normal n–i–p PSCs with the ITO/CdS/TiO2 and ITO/TiO2/CdS architectures.108 The secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) results revealed that the diffusion of I− from perovskite to the TiO2 ETLs enhanced the electronic conductivity of TiO2 in the ITO/CdS/TiO2 architecture, resulting in PCE enhancement. However, such a phenomenon would also contribute to obvious hysteresis. In contrast, I− could not diffuse into TiO2 ETLs in the ITO/TiO2/CdS architecture because CdS was in direct contact with the perovskite layer, thereby suppressing hysteresis. Additionally, our research indicated that MS-modified TiO2 could suppress the phase segregation of inorganic CsPbIBr2 and eliminate the driving force of ion migration, thereby offering stable CsPbIBr2 PSCs.120 The device based on TiO2/Sb2S3 ETLs could maintain 90% of the initial performance after 30 h of storage under 80 °C and 65% RH, whereas the reference based on TiO2 lost almost all performance within 5 h.
4.2. MS-modified SnO2
PSCs with SnO2 ETLs usually exhibit low FF and high hysteresis due to the uncontrollable crystallization of SnO2.121 To solve this problem, Mohamadkhani et al. deposited a CdS layer on the surface of SnO2 and prepared PSCs in the air.122 CdS changed the electron affinity of SnO2 and promoted electron transport from perovskite to SnO2, reducing carrier accumulation at the interface between CdS and perovskite. Therefore, compared with PSCs based on SnO2 ETLs, the SnO2/CdS-based devices possessed lower hysteresis and FF. The PCE increased from 15.0% to 17.18%. Recently, Lv et al. developed a novel CdS QD-assisted SnO2 ETLs in a low-temperature fabrication process.123 The CdS QDs effectively modified the morphology of both SnO2 and the perovskite layer, improved the carrier mobility and conductivity of SnO2, and regulated the ELA between SnO2 and perovskite. Therefore, the champion device based on CdS QDs-SnO2 achieved a PCE of 20.78%. Due to the better morphology and crystallinity of the perovskite deposited on CdS-SnO2 ETLs, the relevant device exhibited improved stability. Huang et al. constructed high-performance PSCs by introducing the SnO2/TiS2 structure as an ETL.39 Due to the better ELA and lower electron trap state density of ETLs (Fig. 10d), the charge transport was more efficient, inducing a high PCE (21.73%). The Pb–O–S–Ti bond could reduce the trap density at the interface between ETLs and perovskite films, thus leading to negligible hysteresis.124 Furthermore, the device based on SnO2/2D TiS2 maintained 92% of the initial PCE after 800 h of storage under ambient conditions with 10% RH.
4.3. MS-modified ZnO
ZnO has attracted attention due to its direct wide bandgap, high electron mobility, and significant conductivity. However, in previous studies, ZnO ETLs have suffered from surface defects, such as hydroxyl and oxygen vacancies, inevitably leading to the severe degradation of PSCs.125–128 Chen et al. partly converted the ZnO surface into ZnS through a sulfidation reaction.54 The S–Pb interaction (Fig. 10e) induced by ZnS provided a new way for electron transport, resulting in accelerated electron transport and reduced interfacial charge recombination. Therefore, PSCs based on ZnO–ZnS ETLs achieved a PCE of 20.7% with negligible hysteresis. Meanwhile, ZnS could also act as a passivation layer. The modified PSCs maintained 88% of their initial PCE after 1000 h of storage in ambient environmental conditions and 87% of their initial PCE after 500 h under UV radiation. Zheng et al. prepared ZnO/ZnS composites by directly synthesizing ZnS in the ZnO nanoparticle solution.51 The CB of the ZnO/ZnS heterojunction was located between those of ZnO and perovskite, resulting in better ELA in PSCs. Zhang revealed the effects of vulcanization treatment on ZnO nanorods: (I) passivation of the defects on the surface of ZnO nanorods; (II) promotion of charge carriers by forming a ZnO/ZnS type-II ELA; (III) suppression of the dissociation of perovskite. Due to these advantages, PSCs based on ZnO/ZnS exhibited increased PCE with less hysteresis (Fig. 10f).127
4.4. MS-modified FDs
FDs, with their high electron mobility and conductivity, have attracted immense attention in PSCs. However, the limited absorption in the solar spectrum, poor morphology control, and unsatisfactory moisture stability of FDs adversely affect the performance and stability of their devices.26,129 Hanmandlu et al. used CdSe/ZnS and CdS/ZnS QDs to modify the interface between C60 and perovskite.130 The results showed that the trap state density of the perovskite dropped after the introduction of QDs, thereby increasing the carrier lifetime. After CdSe/ZnS QDs modification, the Voc and Jsc of the PSCs significantly enhanced, resulting in the rise of PCE from 17.06% to 19.89%. In addition, the relevant devices showed excellent stability. In the long-term stability test up to 2400 h and thermal stability (under an N2 atmosphere at 50 °C) test lasting 720 h, the PSCs retained nearly 80% and 75% of the initial PCE, respectively. Coskun et al. demonstrated the use of SnS instead of bathocuproine (BCP) in invert p–i–n PSCs.84 The introduction of SnS provided better air and moisture protection for the perovskite films. Thus, compared with the PC61BM/BCP, PSCs based on PC61BM/SnS illustrated a higher PCE (18.4%) and better stability (Fig. 10g). Chatzimanolis et al. further investigated the incorporation of 2D TaS2 flakes as a buffer layer for PC71BM in PSCs.131 Owing to passivated surface trap states and more suitable WF of the TaS2-modified PC71BM ETLs, the corresponding device indicated an improvement in PCE from 17.66% to 18.45%. Moreover, the TaS2 buffer layer contributed to effective isolation against volatile species and metal ion diffusion, alleviating degradation at different operational temperatures, giving rise to a longer device lifetime.
Besides the utilization of ETLs, MSs are also applied as components, additives, interfacial materials, and HTLs to promote performance, lower the cost, and enhance the stability of devices. We have already reviewed the corresponding roles and summarized them.135 In addition, MSs (such as low-bandgap PbS QDs) combine with high-bandgap perovskite as tandem absorbing layers. The relevant device obtained a champion PCE of 21.1%. Meanwhile, the perovskite/PbS QDs tandem device maintained the initial PCE after 70 days.136
5. Conclusion and outlook
This review presents and compares the preparation, characteristics, and corresponding mechanisms of MSs-based ETLs in PSCs. An important observation is that the S–Pb interaction passivates the interfacial trap state density, inhibits recombination, and promotes the transfer and extraction of electrons. It has been also demonstrated that MSs have great potential in improving the stability of PSCs by inhibiting ion migration and eliminating UV instability. Although the non-solvent-based techniques accomplish good repeatability and controllability that facilitate homogeneous deposition during large-scale fabrication of MSs-based ETLs, the expensive equipment and complex procedures are their major deterrents. Meanwhile, solvent-based techniques only need simple equipment and involve straightforward processes. CBD can be conducted at low temperatures (even room temperature) using simple reaction equipment, which lowers energy consumption, thus making them more suitable for the manufacture of large-scale perovskite solar modules. However, despite some significant strides achieved so far, a next-generation CBD technique, which supports continuous operation, provides good dispersion and uses recyclable solvents, needs to be further developed. The 2D n-type semiconductor SnS2 with proportional light transmittance, good electronic conductivity, suitable bandgap, and high carrier mobility may be the most promising MS-based ETL candidate.
Although multiple achievements in the MS-based ETLs domain, there are still obstacles that impede their commercialization. Therefore, at the end of this review, we provide brief suggestions for conquering these problems and promoting the performance of PSCs based on MSs ETLs: firstly, it is necessary to make attempts to develop online solvent-based techniques to precisely control the uniformity and thickness of MS-based ETLs, especially for the production of large-scale perovskite solar modules. For example, some surfactants can be added to prevent particles from aggregating in the CBD method, or an ultrasonic spray technology may be developed to precisely control the droplets in the spray-coating process. Secondly, strategies, such as doping and modification, should be developed to effectively regulate the energy level of ETLs (both mono-MS ETLs and ETLs with MS modifications). Finally, exploring new n-type MSs as ETLs or p-type MSs as HTLs to fabricate PSCs with all-MS charge transport layers would significantly enhance the stability of the devices.
