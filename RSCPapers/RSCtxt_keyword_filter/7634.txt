    , Accepted 20th March 2020First published on 20th March 2020AbstractThe environmental toxicity of lead may eventually hamper the wide applications of hybrid perovskite material-based solar cells despite their excellent power conversion efficiency. Here, we have used silver(I) and bismuth(III) to replace lead(II) and obtain two two-dimensional (2D) iodide-based double perovskites, (AMP)4[BiAgI8]2·H2O (1) and (APP)4[BiAgI8]·H2O (2), where AMP = 4-aminomethylpiperidine and APP = 4-aminopiperidine. Compared to our previously reported 1,4-cyclohexanediamine-based compound (C6H16N2)2[BiAgI8]·H2O with an indirect band gap, these two new 2D Ag–Bi double perovskites show direct band gaps (∼2.00 eV) due to the less distorted [AgI6] coordination geometry. Moreover, the photo-current response experiments showed a difference of more than 50 nA between light and dark conditions for both the compounds, indicating the potential application for light harvesting. 1 and 2 were also stable under heat and moisture. They showed high proton conductivity (∼10−4 S cm−1) at 95 °C and 90% RH. Thus, this work provides a new route for designing stable lead-free bimetallic iodide double perovskites with direct band gaps.
Although the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solar cells based on the prototype hybrid perovskite material (MA)PbX3 (MA = methylammonium) has increased from 3.6% to 25.2% within ten years,1 the material still suffers from poor air stability and high toxicity of lead.2–4 To address the long-term stability issue for practical applications, it can be observed from literature that scientists have paid much attention to improve the stability of perovskite compounds. Among them, Wu et al. showed that alloying Ba into the MAPbI3 perovskites is beneficial for the stability of materials and these materials have emerged as attractive materials for photovoltaic applications.5 Recently, Zheng et al. showed that two-dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic perovskites present a new route to obtain stable compounds with very promising properties in optoelectronic devices.6
In terms of the toxicity of lead, it is almost impossible to use environment-friendly divalent metal ions to replace Pb2+ because the ion sizes of Mg2+ and Ba2+ are too large to form a stable perovskite structure; the band gaps of the Ca2+ and Sr2+ compounds are too large due to the lack of lone pairs of electrons; and Sn2+ is simply oxidized to Sn4+.7–9 Thus, trivalent bismuth(III) ions having a lone pair of electrons in the 6s2 orbital and stable valence have become the most promising candidate,10,11 but the charge is not balanced if a perovskite structure is targeted. An effective method to solve this problem is to combine a monovalent cation such as K(I), Na(I), Ag(I) and Cu(I), which can balance the surplus charge of the trivalent metal ion during the formation of lead-free organic–inorganic hybrid structures. In this context, bimetallic double perovskites are very promising owing to their high stability and attractive optoelectronic properties.12–15
However, the fabrication of bimetallic hybrid perovskites is challenging. Since a few years, the method of incorporating trivalent (MIII) and monovalent (MI) cations into an organic–inorganic hybrid or inorganic material was started. In 2016, McClure et al. synthesized the first inorganic bimetallic lead-free double perovskite Cs2AgBiX6 (X = Br, Cl) with a band gap of 2.19 eV for XBr and 2.77 eV for XCl.16 Cs2AgBiBr6 has also been reported by Karunadasa et al. but with the band gap of 1.95 eV and a long photoluminescence lifetime of ca. 660 ns.17 Later, Zhang et al. also exploited the strategy of cation transmutation to transform two divalent Pb+2 ions into one monovalent M+ and one trivalent M3+ ion, synthesizing a novel class of quaternary halides within double perovskites (elpasolites) like Cs2InBiCl6 and Cs2AgSbI6. They further identified eleven non-toxic perovskites as promising absorbers to replace APbXVII3.18 In 2018, Karunadasa et al. first synthesized two Ag–Bi bromide hybrid double perovskites, namely, (BA)4AgBiBr8 and (BA)2AgBiBr7 [BA = CH3(CH2)3NH3+] with widened band gaps.19
Compared to bromide and chloride, metal iodides have been less studied for the construction of hybrid materials. In literature, only one two-dimensional (2D) Ag(I)–Bi(III) iodide double perovskite templated by a layer of bifunctionalized oligothiophene cations has been reported recently20 and several months ago, our group reported a second 2D perovskite compound (C6H16N2)2[BiAgI8]·H2O (AgBiI) [C6H14N2 = 1,4-cyclohexane-diamine].21 We found that AgBiI exhibited an indirect band gap. Here, we found that amines and structural distortions energetically played an important role to differentiate between direct and indirect band gaps. The two new compounds, namely, (AMP)4[BiAgI8]2·H2O 1 and (APP)4[BiAgI8]·H2O 2, where AMP = 4-aminomethylpiperidine and APP = 4-aminopiperidine, show direct band gaps of ∼2.00 eV, which have been corroborated by UV absorption and photoluminescence studies and ab initio calculations. In addition to the high solubility and film processable nature, 1 and 2 showed significant stability against moisture and temperature. This can be proved by the proton-conducting properties of 1 and 2 at a high temperature and high humidity. A conductivity of ∼10−4 S cm−1 was recorded at 95 °C and 90% RH.
Single crystals of 1 and 2 were grown through the hydrothermal method, in which stoichiometric amounts of AgI, BiI3, and AMP or APP in a concentrated hydroiodic acid solution were added and the mixture was kept at 120 °C for three days (see “Materials and sample preparation” in the ESI† for more details). Compound 1 crystallized in the monoclinic space group C21/c (see Table S1, ESI†). The inorganic moiety of 1 formed an [AgBiI8]n4n− double perovskite structure, which was separated by organic [(NH3+–CH2–C5NH10)2]4+ cations (Fig. 1a and Fig. S1a, ESI†). The [AgBiI8]n4n− layer was assembled through the Bi–I–Ag bridges to form vertex-sharing [BiI6] and [AgI6] octahedra (Fig. 2a). The bond distances of Bi–I ranged from 2.9849(10) Å to 3.2118(13) Å, and the Ieq–Bi–Ieq (eq means equatorial) and Iax–Bi–Iax (ax means axial) angles ranged from 86.85(3)° to 93.35(4)° and from 173.657(18)° to 176.643(19)°, respectively, indicating slightly distorted geometry from the ideal octahedron. The bond distances of Ag–I ranged from 2.667(11) Å to 3.786(10) Å, and the Ieq–Ag–Ieq and Iax–Agi–Iax angles ranged from 87.76(3)° to 93.41(3)° and from 170.24(6)° to 180°, respectively. These values were in good agreement with those of similar compounds.20,21

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that 2 crystallized in the space group C2/c (Table S1, ESI†). The silver atom is distorted over three sites with occupancies 0.1:0.8:0.1 by symmetries (Fig. S1b, ESI†). As shown in Fig. 1b and 2b, the crystal structure forms a typical organic–inorganic 2D double perovskite architecture by the vertex-sharing octahedra of Bi3+ and Ag+ cations. For the inorganic moieties of 2, each Bi3+ and Ag+ ion is surrounded by six I atoms, forming a distorted octahedral configuration with the Bi–I and Ag–I bond lengths varying from 3.0727(8) Å to 3.1054(10) Å and from 2.6928(12) Å to 3.229(9) Å, respectively. These distances are closer to the sum of the ionic radii of bismuth/silver and iodine ions (ri = 1.03 + 2.2 = 3.23 Å; ri = 1.15 + 2.2 = 3.35 Å) rather than to the sum of their covalent radii (re = 1.48 + 1.39 = 2.87 Å; re = 1.45 + 1.39 = 2.84 Å), indicating that these bonds have an ionic and slightly distorted character of the BiI6 and AgI6 octahedra.
Interestingly, 4-aminomethylpiperidine and 4-aminopiperidine play important roles in the construction of 2D perovskites due to their distorted geometry, which can support the inorganic layers firmly. Indeed, AMP and APP exhibit a regular spatial configuration with normal C–C and C–N distances ranging from 1.493(12) Å to 1.538(13) Å with the C–C–C and C–C–N angles ranging between 108.2(8)° and 113.5(8)° (see Tables S2 and S3, ESI†). Moreover, 1 and 2 exhibit many intermolecular hydrogen bonding contacts between the [(NH3+–CH2–C5NH10)2]4+ or [(C6H12N2)2]2+ cations, H2O and [AgBiI8]4− anions of the type N–H⋯I, O–H⋯N and O–H⋯I reported in Fig. 2c and d and Tables S4 and S5 in the ESI.†
The distortion degree of the BiI6 and AgI6 octahedra in 1 and 2 (Δd and σ2) can be quantitatively estimated by the following equations22,23 and compared to that of our reported AgBiI perovskite.21 Δd = (1/6)∑[dn − d/d]2(1) σ2 = ∑(θi − 90)2/11(2)
Here, “d” is the average distance of the six M–I (M = Bi or Ag) bonds forming the octahedron and “dn” refers to the six individual Bi–I or Ag–I bond lengths. Similarly, the bond angle variance (eqn (2), where “θi” is the individual X–M–X angle) of 90°, referring to the angle deviation of the non-distorted structure, was also calculated.
From Table 1, we can see that all the [AgI6] octahedra are distorted, in particular for AgBiI, as their bond distances and angles strongly deviate from the ideal values, as demonstrated by the distortion parameters Δd and σ2, which present the largest Δd and the smallest σ2 values.

The PXRD patterns of 1 and 2 match perfectly well with the simulated one based on the single-crystal structure, indicating a pure phase of our powder samples (Fig. S2(a and b), ESI†).
Interestingly, both 1 and 2 are highly soluble in DMF as 1 ml DMF can dissolve 1 g of solids. By the spin-coating method, 0.4 g ml−1 DMF solution of 1 and 2 was deposited on an ITO glass, followed by annealing on a hot plate at 70 °C for 10 minutes and cooling to room temperature. We obtained smooth and uniform thin films of 1 and 2 with less pin-holes (Fig. 3(a and d)) and grain sizes of 4 μm and 3 μm, respectively. The thickness of the films was obtained through the cross-section images shown in Fig. 3b and e; this revealed that the films had thicknesses of 1 μm and 1.2 μm for 1 and 2, respectively, which were in good agreement with those of other perovskite films.24,25 We successfully prepared uniform thin films to avoid pinholes and ensure interconnectivity between the crystallites with ∼1 μm thickness to have a high capacity of light absorption. Fig. 3c and f show that the XRD patterns of the films made from 1 and 2 are in good agreement with the patterns generated from single crystal data, indicating the phase purity of our thin film compounds. An important point is cited here: for the most studied halide perovskites, the inorganic layers grow parallel to the substrate surface.26 In this paper, the XRD patterns for the films of 1 and 2 show principal (202) and (200) reflection planes, respectively, which indicates the vertical growth of the compound on the substrate.

The diffuse reflectance spectrum was recorded using polycrystalline powder at room temperature and converted to an absorbance spectrum by Kubelka–Munk transformation.27,28 The compounds 1 and 2 have the absorption cutoff wavelengths of 620 nm (2.00 eV) and 604 nm (2.05 eV), respectively (Fig. 4a). These values are in good agreement with those observed for similar compounds.29,30

The Tauc plots obtained from their absorption spectra by assuming a direct band gap agree well with the absorbance values, which show Eg values of 2.07 eV and 2.12 eV for 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. 4a (upper inset)).
The absorption cutoff wavelengths of the thin films made from 1 and 2 at 298 K were also determined to be 588 nm (2.11 eV) and 566 nm (2.19 eV), respectively (Fig. S3, ESI†); both were slightly higher than those of the powder samples, which may be due to the scattering phenomena according to the Mie theory.31–33 We need to mention that the presence of this narrow band indicates high excitonic binding energy produced by the dielectric mismatch between organic and inorganic entities.
We analyzed the nature of the electronic states in the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) near the band gap using a projection of the total density of states (Fig. 4b and Fig. S4a–d, ESI†). The VB is mainly contributed by the I-p and Ag-d orbitals, while the electronic states at the CB are predominantly contributed by the Bi-p, I-p and Ag-s orbitals. This indicates that the optical properties of 1 near its band gap originate from the inorganic [AgBiI8]4− components.
Without SOC, both the VBM and CBM for 1 are located at the Z point, which should be leading to the direct feature of its band gap (Fig. 4c). The calculated energy of 1 was 2.37 eV, which was slightly larger than the value of the direct band gap obtained from the UV-Vis absorption spectrum (2.07 eV).34–37 When spin-orbital coupling (SOC) was taken into account, the band gap was reduced to 2.14 eV, and the band curvatures changed to near conduction band G (Fig. 4d). Note that a direct band gap was also observed for the 2D lead-free perovskite (BA)4AgBiBr8 but at 2.85 eV.19
However, our previously reported compound (AgBiI) has an indirect band gap (Fig. S4e, ESI†) and 1 and 2 have direct band gaps. To understand this difference, we analyzed the geometrical distortion of the [AgI6] octahedra in AgBiI, 1 and 2. For AgBiI, the [AgI6] octahedron is significantly distorted (see Table 1), forming a shorter Ag–I bond (2.684 Å) in the axial position and a much longer Ag–I bond ranging between 2.970 Å and 4.324 Å in the equatorial plane. For 1, the equatorial Ag–I distance is much shorter, ranging from 3.381 Å to 3.786 Å, and the axial distance is slightly longer, i.e., about 2.732 Å. For 2, this is similar, where the Ag–Ieq distance ranges between 3.212 Å and 3.229 Å. Indeed, this distortion in [AgI6] for AgBiI induces changes in orbital “d” at the Ag site, which alters the valence band (VB) dispersion. Therefore, the structural distortions energetically play an important role to differentiate the direct and indirect transitions. This finding suggests that the Ag–4d states are responsible for the band gap structure, where the long Ag–Iax bonds stabilize the antibonding VBM states of the Ag dz2 character and the short Ag–Ieq bonds destabilize those of the Ag dx2–y2 character (both situations are favorable for direct band gaps).
Under UV radiation at 450 nm, compounds 1 and 2 exhibited weak emission bands centered at 605 nm and 587 nm with the CIE chromaticity coordinates of (0.44, 0.52) and (0.49, 0.48), respectively, which were derived from the spatial localization/separation of the photoexcited holes and electrons in the vicinity of Ag and Bi, respectively (Fig. S5a and S5b, ESI†).21,38 The correlated color temperatures (CCT) are 3676 K and 2756 K for 1 and 2, respectively, corresponding to the yellowish-white (warm) light for indoor illumination. The broadband emission of 1 and 2 enabled them to have color rendering index (CRI) values of 40 and 58, respectively. Furthermore, the average lifetimes were recorded with double exponential according to τ = τ1α1 + τ2α2; τ1 is the fastest decay process related to the radiative recombination of excitons, τ2 is the slowest decay process corresponding to the trap states due to the perovskite crystal structure, and a1 and a2 indicate the occupancy of each decay time. The average lifetimes were calculated to be 5.97 ns and 6.23 ns for 1 and 2, respectively (Fig. S5c, ESI†). Thus, these two compounds showed longer average lifetime emission compared to MAPbI3 (τavr = 2.85 ns) and other reported perovskite compounds (Fig. 5 and Table S6, ESI†).39–42 This result can be assigned to the decrease in non-radiative recombination in the layered crystal structure.

To reveal the possibility for optoelectronic applications, we measured the photoconductivity of the two compounds using pressed pellet samples under 350 W xenon lamp irradiation. As shown in Fig. S6a and b (ESI†), at a positive bias voltage of 3 V, the photocurrent is enhanced from 5.64 nA (dark) to 79.31 nA (light) for 1 and from 2.80 nA (dark) to 56.01 nA (light) for 2, which shows an obvious switch of 14.06 nA and 20 nA (on/off) for 1 and 2, respectively (Table 2). A periodical switching (on and off) of light was recorded for 1 and 2 (Fig. S6c and S6d, ESI†), indicating the reproducibility and superior stability of 1 and 2. Note that these two perovskites showed an enhanced photocurrent response compared to our previously reported AgBiI compound, which may also be due to the direct band gap nature. Besides their interesting photodetection properties, (AMP)4[BiAgI8]2·H2O and (APP)4[BiAgI8]·H2O may exhibit promising thermal conductivity, as shown by Wu et al.; they synthesized 0D lead-free hybrid crystals of [Mn(C2H6OS)6]I4 with an ultra-low thermal conductivity of 0.15 ± 0.01 W m−1 K−1 at room temperature, which is among the lowest values reported for organic–inorganic hybrid materials.43 Measuring thermal conductivity is one of our next future research goals in order to improve the physical properties of our 2D double perovskites.

The presence of protonated piperidine amines and water molecules as proton carriers and hydrogen-bonding contacts as proton-conducting pathways can make 1 and 2 appropriate to be used in proton-conducting solid materials. Usually, the proton-conducting properties of materials are mainly influenced by the relative temperature and humidity. Herein, variable humidity (30–90%, relative humidity (RH))-dependent proton conductivity was obtained using pressed pellets and it was measured by alternating-current spectroscopy at 368 K. Amazingly, as shown in Fig. 6a–d, the proton conductivity of compound 1 increases from 1.06 × 10−5 S cm−1 to 2.27 × 10−4 S cm−1 on increasing RH (30–90%), while under the same conditions, the proton conductivity of compound 2 increases from 7.19 × 10−6 S cm−1 to 2.09 × 10−4 S cm−1.
 Fig. 6  Temperature-dependent Nyquist plots for 1 (a) and 2 (c) measured at 95 °C. Proton conduction of compounds 1 (b) and 2 (d) measured at 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80% and 90% RH at 95 °C. 
From the results mentioned above, it is suggested that water molecules are the main source of proton carriers in the crystalline solid to improve the proton conductivities of the compounds when higher RH is applied, while the high temperature provides activation energy to achieve ionization into H+, which results in higher proton conductivities.44,45 Interestingly, both compounds showed high stability during the measurements. The proton conductivity of 1 was better than that of 2 under the same conditions probably due to the bond strength between water molecules, H+ and metal cations and because the number of hydrogen bonds formed in compound 1 was more than that in 2. These results are very interesting compared to those of the hybrid organic–inorganic compounds and MOF proton conductors shown in Table S7 in the ESI.†
In addition to being stable under high humidity, as indicated above, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) revealed that both 1 and 2 were stable up to 290 °C and 285 °C, respectively (Fig. S7, ESI†). To further reveal the stability of these two compounds under moisture, the as-prepared powders and thin films of 1 and 2 were stored in the dark at 55% humidity for 7 and 30 days, respectively. As shown in Fig. S8 and S9 in the ESI,† the XRD powders and thin films of 1 and 2 are almost the same as those of the as-prepared sample and there is no peak related to the degradation products. Hence, these two materials are very stable to moisture and heat.
Conclusions
In summary, by using piperidine-based amines as templates, we successfully switched the indirect band gap of monolayer silver/bismuth iodine hybrid double perovskites to a direct band gap, which mainly occured due to the reduced distortion of the [AgI6] octahedron. This finding also indicated that the Ag-4d orbital determined the band gap structure of bimetallic double perovskites. Specifically, in these two compounds, the elongated Ag–Iax bonds stabilized the anti-bonding VBM states of the Ag dz2 character, while the shorter Ag–Ieq bonds destabilized those of the Ag dx2–y2 character. Both actions promoted the direct band gap features. Moreover, both compounds exhibited strong photocurrent responses when irradiated under a xenon lamp, proving the possibility of their application in optoelectronics and solar cells. In addition, these two compounds showed high proton conductivities at high temperatures and moisture; this indicates that they are very stable when exposed to air, rendering their futuristic applications in the real world.
