    , Accepted 25th May 2022First published on 31st May 2022AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) have progressed rapidly in recent years through the development of novel organic photoactive materials, especially non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs). Consequently, OSCs based on state-of-the-art NFAs have reached significant milestones, such as ∼19% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) and small energy losses (less than 0.5 eV). Despite these significant advances, understanding of the interplay between molecular structure and optoelectronic properties lags significantly behind. For example, despite the theoretical framework for describing the energetic disorder being well developed for the case of inorganic semiconductors, the question of the applicability of classical semiconductor theories in analyzing organic semiconductors is still under debate. A general observation in the inorganic field is that inorganic photovoltaic materials possessing a polycrystalline microstructure exhibit suppressed disorder properties and better charge carrier transport compared to their amorphous analogs. Accordingly, this principle extends to the organic semiconductor field as many organic photovoltaic materials are synthesized to pursue polycrystalline-like features. Yet, there appears to be sporadic examples that exhibit an opposite trend. However, full studies decoupling energetic disorder from aggregation effects have largely been left out. Hence, the potential role of the energetic disorder in OSCs has received little attention. Interestingly, recently reported state-of-the-art NFA-based devices could achieve a small energetic disorder and high PCE at the same time; and interest in this investigation related to the disorder properties in OSCs was revived. In this contribution, progress in terms of the correlation between molecular design and energetic disorder is reviewed together with their effects on the optoelectronic mechanism and photovoltaic performance. Finally, the specific challenges and possible solutions in reducing the energetic disorder of OSCs from the viewpoint of materials and devices are proposed.

Broader context
The need for sustainable renewable energy technologies is urgent due to increasing energy consumption, climate change, and depletion of fossil fuels. The utilization of solar energy through photovoltaic technologies is certainly one of the most promising ways to meet the world's growing energy demand. Organic solar cells (OSCs) represent an emerging solution for low-cost clean energy production, owing to their advantages of light weight, flexibility, and low toxicity. Despite the rapid development of OSCs in recent years, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are not high enough to compete against mature inorganic photovoltaic technologies. One reason for the relatively low PCEs comes from the lack of highly crystalline structure and amorphous nature of organic semiconductors. This nature endows OSCs with intense electronic state interactions, strong structural disorder, and thereby the presence of energetic disorder. The recently reported state-of-the-art small molecule acceptor-based devices possessing small energetic disorder can achieve a high power conversion efficiency. This particularly encouraging phenomenon inspires many recent investigations exploring the disorder properties in OSCs. Understanding the relation between molecular design and energetic disorder is essential within OSCs toward the goal of competing with inorganic photovoltaics.

Introduction
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have progressed quite significantly in the past decade, not only for academic interest, but also for their potential applications in the integrated PV markets, especially in building integrated photovoltaics (BIPV). This is in part explained by the unique advantages of organic materials such as their high mechanical flexibility, low fabrication cost (solution-processing), and the availability of absorbers with different colors.1–10 Focused research efforts on OSCs have pushed the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single junction solar cells to 19%.11 Nevertheless, high-efficiency solar cells don’t ensure the high performance of solar modules and create maximum power output. The efficiency of OSCs achieved so far is not yet competitive with commercially available inorganic solar cells e.g., crystalline silicon (C-Si), cadmium telluride (CdTe), or copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS).12–14 In this regard, further improving PCE is still a crucial task in OSCs for future commercialization.
In inorganic solar cells, following the absorption of incident photons with energies larger than their bandgap, parts of the photo-generated charge carriers (both electron and hole) were initially excited to high-energy sites above its conduction/valence band. Consequently, the excess energy from the photon is quickly dissipated as heat by a step-wise release of phonons.15 Studies related to the disorder properties in inorganic photovoltaics showed that both the photon absorbing process and the achievable voltage in their solar cell devices are associated with the degree of their static disorder. As for organic systems, this process leads to substantial energy loss through continuous thermalization of the photogenerated charge carriers in the disorder broadened density of states (DOS) of organic molecular orbitals, which was widely regarded as the main source of energy loss in photovoltaic devices.16–19 Energetic disorder in these materials is often defined as the Gaussian distributed scattering of the electronic energy states of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels in the D:A bulk heterojunction (BHJ) layer.20–22 For this Gaussian distribution of states and low carrier densities, the energy of the thermalized carrier distribution in the Boltzmann limit can be positioned at σ2/kBT below the center of the DOS.23 In general, the amorphous nature of organic semiconductors makes them susceptible to the formation of a large amount of localized states in their molecular orbital. The presence of these localized states and energy disorder in the materials forming the BHJ is found to cause a decisive influence on the mechanisms determining the charge carrier transport as well as the photovoltaic properties.24 Specifically, in the era of fullerene-based blends, the energetic disorder ranges from 100 to 200 meV.16,25 These large energetic disorders can be attributed to the small aggregate size of the fullerene acceptors combined with significant orientational and conformational disorder in their microdomains.26,27 In relation to this, fullerene-based devices display broad sub-gap features related to an energetically broadened charge transfer (CT) absorption. Such broadening of the CT state manifold has been identified as a major source of voltage losses because the occupation of low lying CT states fosters recombination and increases the voltage loss in the blends, thereby limiting the efficiency of fullerene-based solar cells.16,24,28,29
With the development of new photovoltaic materials, especially non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), the PCEs of OSCs have significantly improved.30–51 One potential reason accounting for the surge in PCE is that the energetic offset for generating free charge carriers in the OSCs is no longer a constraint in NFA-based devices.52,53 The increased CT state absorption is attributed to the strong interplayed LE-CT state.54 Thus, significant efforts have been devoted to designing novel NFAs for OSCs, and meanwhile, the general molecular design rules for minimizing energy losses have been presented in the literature.55 Besides the low driving force for efficient charge generation, the OSCs based on the high performance NFAs exhibit other distinct features that have not been widely recognized in traditional fullerene-based OSCs. For example, the recent emergence of A–DA′D–A type small molecule acceptors could achieve a low degree of energetic disorder less than 50 meV along with the Urbach energy (Eu) between 22–23 meV at room temperature.56–58 The reduced energetic disorder can be mainly attributed to the specific molecular geometry and the definite conformation of the A–DA′D–A acceptors, facilitating the ordered intermolecular face-on packing. This small energetic disorder and Eu was first found in high-performance solution processable organic semiconductors and is almost on a par with the hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite compounds.59
Since the new finding has established a correlation between the microscopic properties of photovoltaic materials and device performance, the extensive study of energetic disorder is of great importance for the future development of OSCs. In this review, we first discuss the role of the energetic disorder of organic photovoltaic materials. We then focus on the recent progress of the energetic disorder in solution-processed fullerene and non-fullerene-based OSCs. Finally, we also provide an overview of the specific challenges and possible solutions in reducing the energetic disorder of OSCs from the viewpoint of materials and devices, for further improving the photovoltaic efficiency.
The role of disorder
As mentioned before, imperfections and distortions in the crystal structure, initiated by either the intrinsic or extrinsic factors, can impair the crystal and break translational symmetry, and therefore, introduce disorder into the crystal. If the disorder gives rise to site energy fluctuation in the HOMO or LUMO energy levels of a semiconductor (Gaussian or exponential shape), it is then referred to as an energetic disorder. In inorganic semiconductors with an ordered crystalline structure, such as C–Si or Ge, crystals are formed by atoms with strong covalent bonds. Strong electronic interactions between the atomic orbitals produce well-defined band edges and hence a band gap. Consequently, the energetic disorder is absent in such perfectly-ordered semiconductors. In contrast, solution-processed organic semiconductors are not perfect conjugated systems and are typically disordered materials.60–62 The cohesion between the two organic molecules is only produced by relatively weak van der Waals forces, so that electron interactions between the orbitals of the adjacent lattice are weak and the resulting band edges are non-ideal, with a broadened DOS extending into bandgaps (Fig. 1a). Besides the weak intra- and inter-molecular interactions, the organic semiconductors are soft, their twist and kink chains, conformational diversity or chemical defects lead to a diverse thin film morphology, which also contributes to the DOS broadening and significant energetic disorder (Fig. 1b).63–65 Energetic disorder in organic systems is usually modeled by Gaussian distribution of energy with a standard deviation quantifying the extent of the disorder. The Gaussian disorder model (GDM) was first proposed by Bassler in 1993 to describe the hopping motion of charges inside an amorphous organic solid. In this model, the Gaussian function was applied to describe the Gaussian distributed transport site energies and separations:66 (1)where Nc is the total density of transport sites, σDOS is the width of the Gaussian distribution of the DOS and ξ is referred as to the center of the DOS. On the basis of the Monte Carlo simulations on charge-carrier mobility, charge hopping is thermally activated and field assisted. So the carrier mobility is temperature- (T) and field-dependent (F). Then, the GDM can be embodied in the following formation: (2) (3)where T is the absolute temperature, kB is the Boltzmann constant, μ∞ is the high temperature limit of the mobility, and C is 2.9 × 10−4 (cm V−1 s−1)1/2. σ is the energetic disorder describing the width of Gaussian distribution of the density of energy state for the carrier transport sites; Σ is the degree of positional disorder, which can be understood as the fluctuation in inter-site distance arising from structural or chemical defects. The significance of this relationship is that it correlates experimental observations from the temperature dependence of carrier mobility in organic semiconductors to the microscopic properties like the degree of disorder. Besides temperature-dependent transport characterization, optical spectroscopy-photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS) has also been extensively used to analyze electronic disorder in organic semiconductors.67,68 A PDS technique is based on the mirage effect and is realized through the detection of a deflected probe light due to heating of the sample surface induced from the absorption of photon energies. For organic semiconductors, PDS can be used to detect the absorption properties in the band tail region as characterized by Urbach energy (EU). The magnitude of EU is related to the energy spread of the localized tail states near the band edge of a semiconductor film. The near bandgap defects arise from several sources, e.g. thin-film processing, chemical impurities, imperfect crystal structure, defects, deep trap state, or charge transfer state, etc. Basically, the higher is the EU, the larger the electronic disorder in the semiconductor. Understanding the correlation between chemical structure and solid-state film morphologies of organic photovoltaic systems and energetic disorder, and in turn charge transport and recombination mechanisms within the OSCs device, can generate useful guidelines for future OSCs material design.

Energetic disorder in organic semiconductor materials
In this section, we review the energetic disorder studies in various OSC systems. Structure-property relationships obtained from this effort can generate guidelines for future material design with improved properties.
Energetic disorder in fullerene acceptors
During the two decades from 1995 to 2015, fullerene derivatives were the most widely used electron acceptors in OSCs. Their optical, electrical, and photovoltaic properties were well investigated. Reports related to energetic disorder in fullerene derivatives can be traced back to the early-stage charge transport studies of fullerene-based devices. In 2003, Blom et al. investigated current-voltage characteristics of methano fullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM).71 The electron current in this semiconductor is space-charge-limited, which allows for direct determination of electron mobility from the J–V measurement. Furthermore, they demonstrated that the observed field and temperature-dependence of the electron mobility of PCBM can be described with a Gaussian disorder model by the following eqn (4), and information about the energetic disorder and average transport-site is obtained: (4)where μ∞ is the mobility as the limit T to ∞, σ is the width of the Gaussian DOS, a is the intersite spacing, and kB is Boltzmann's constant. By combining the analysis of the experimental and simulation results, the width of the site energy distribution in pristine PCBM is obtained as σLUMO = 73 meV. Later on, Belmonte et al. studied DOS and recombination kinetics of BHJ OSCs consisting of the poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) donor and two different fullerene derivatives PCBM or 4,40-dihexyloxydiphenylmethano[60]fullerene (DPM6) acceptors (Fig. 2a).72 They demonstrated that the Voc in the BHJ OSCs with different fullerene acceptor materials is closely related to the amount and energy distribution of available electronic sites. A smaller intermediate DOS (IDOS) that lies below the upper LUMO manifold of the DPM6 fullerene acceptor leads to 125 mV larger Voc in DPM6 based OSCs. In contrast, the existence of larger IDOS in the case of PCBM has the detrimental consequence of keeping the Fermi level within the tail of the distribution and thereby limiting the Voc. The main difference between the DPM6 and PCBM fullerene acceptor is the crystalline nature of the latter. In general, less crystalline fullerenes DPM6 allow for a high rise of the Fermi level by reduction of the available number of electronic states. This work showed a direct correlation between the chemical structure, shape of DOS, and device parameters in fullerene derivative-based OSCs.

To gain an in-depth understanding of the energetic disorder in fullerene derivatives, Nelson et al. investigated the influence of structural and energetic disorder on electron transport in fullerene multi-adducts.73 They presented experimental charge transport data from field-effect transistor (FET) and time-of-light (TOF) measurements quantifying the difference in electron mobilities in PCBM, bis-PCBM and tris-PCBM and estimating energetic disorder by fitting the experimental data (Fig. 2c). Combing the analysis of kinetic Monte Carlo transport simulation, the influence of packing disorder (poor contact between fullerenes due to steric hindrance) was separated from the influence of energetic disorder (due to the varying acceptor energies of the isomers) on electron mobility. The low electron mobility observed in higher fullerene adducts is largely due to the energetic disorder arising from different isomers. Based on this result, they proposed a guideline for the fullerene based OSCs that single isomers of the fullerenes will have one order higher mobilities than PCBM, which in turn can achieve better PCEs than those of the PCBM counterpart. Brédas et al. used molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the effects of monoadducts, bis- and tris-adducts on the packing properties of PCBM and indene-C60.74 The packing results on the MD level then serve as input for density functional theory (DFT) calculations to examine the energetic disorder as a function of the number of fullerene adducts (Fig. 2b). Smaller fullerene adducts that result in limited adduct–adduct interaction can increase solubility without increasing the extent of disorder or compromising the electron transport pathways.
In another study, Nguyen and coworkers used a Kelvin probe to determine the energetic disorder of the donor HOMO and acceptor LUMO in various fullerene-based blends.75 To this end, the thickness-dependent work function of the active layer thickness was fitted by an analytical model assuming exponential disorder. This allowed the authors to separate the total energy loss into contributions from energetic disorder and from charge recombination. For the most disordered fullerene-based blend, the energy loss by disorder was 200 meV, accounting for ca. 30% of the total loss. For the other extreme, the blend of a small molecule donor with the acceptor polymer N2200, disorder-induced losses were nearly absent. This acceptor polymer was shown to exhibit a very small energetic disorder,76 related to its tendency to form large and uniformly oriented crystallites.77 This highlights the benefit of well-developed crystalline phases in the bulk-heterojunction blend for reduced energy losses and efficient charge extraction.
Energetic disorder in non-fullerene acceptors
Non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted much research interest since 2015. In contrast to the fullerene acceptors, one of the main advantages of NFAs is their structural flexibility and highly tunable electronic/optical properties. These properties have led to several research studies focusing on the influence of NFAs' structural evolution on the energetic disorder and their correlation with device performance.
Perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, as one kind of the most common NFAs before 2015, possess low manufacturing costs, high electron mobilities, and suitable energy levels (Fig. 3). Cho et al. presented the design of three PDI-based NFAs with different molecular geometry, namely a monomeric PDI (PDI1), a bay-linked PDI dimer (PDI2), and a bay-linked PDI tetramer with 9,9′-spirobifluorene core (PDI4).78 From density functional theory (DFT) calculations; in PDI4, the torsional angles between the PDI plane and the fluorene plane are about 56°, and the four bay-linked PDI subunits are oriented along with the four cardinal directions due to the orthogonal structure of the spirobifluorene core. The highly twisted and 3D coordinated molecular geometry of PDI4 could possess appropriate intermolecular connectivity without severe molecular aggregation, which in turn suppresses the energetic disorder and enhances the performance of OSCs. As a consequence, among the three PTB7-Th: PDI OSCs, the highest PCE of 6.44% was obtained by the PDI4-based OSC device followed by the PDI2-based (PCE = 5.32%) and PDI1-based (PCE = 2.48%) devices. Then, So and co-workers investigated the correlation between the number (n) of PDI moieties connected to the porphyrin core, and the electron transport as well as the photovoltaic performance of the OSCs. Three PDI derivatives, with one, two or four PDI moieties conjugated peripherally to the porphyrin core by the phenylene linker, denoted as nPDI-ZnP (n = 1, 2, 4) were studied.79 From the results of temperature dependent electron mobility measurements, it was found that the electron disorder σe decreases progressively from 123 meV to 105 meV in the PTB7-Th:2PDI-ZnP and PTB7-Th:1PDI-ZnP (respectively) based BHJ blend films and to 84 meV in the PTB7-Th:4PDI-ZnP based blend film. The Urbach energy, characterized by photothermal deflection spectroscopy, was found to be 38.1 meV in the 4PDI-ZnP based BHJ blend films, which is smaller than that in the PTB7-Th:2PDI-ZnP (42.7 meV) and PTB7-Th:1PDI-ZnP (49.1 meV) based blend films. These results suggest that the shallow defects near the band edge are passivated in the BHJs with the acceptor containing connected PDI moieties. Therefore, the passivated shallow defects contribute to reduced recombination and enhanced transport properties in the BHJ blend films, which in turn translates to the highest Voc (0.88V) and fill factor (64%) and also a champion device performance (8.40% PCE) in the 4PDI-ZnP based OSC.

A–D–A type small molecule acceptors (SMAs), as another family of NFAs, have achieved tremendous success in pushing the PCE of OSCs. The feature for the deep and shallow trap state in a typical NFA based BHJ blend of PBDB-T:ITIC was revealed by non-destructive and steady state based impedance spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the traps exist in both the surface and bulk forms of the ITIC-based organic BHJ system and they are also different in the trap density and energetic disorder characteristics. By changing the device configuration, the trap distribution and energetic landscape properties were found to be the inherent feature of the ITIC based blend regardless of active layer thickness and the interfacial transport layer.80 Through the analysis of the combination of MD simulations and DFT calculations, Brédas and co-workers demonstrated that the total disorder in these A–D–A type SMAs is only about two-thirds of that in the fullerene counterparts (Fig. 4a).81 The underlying reasons for the low energetic disorder in this kind of electron acceptor are their coplanar and rigid backbones and therefore, largely reduced static disorder. As for device applications, Zhang et al. investigated energetic disorder and the effects on the energy loss and photovoltaic properties on three OSCs based on the donor polymer PBDB-T blended with ITIC and its derivative with methyl electron-donating substituent (IT-M) along with PC71BM.82 The champion efficiency of 11.5% for the device based on PBDB-T:IT-M blends was associated with the least disorder. They highlight the importance of reducing the energetic disorder associated with the charge transport properties and charge transfer state, both essential for understanding the energy loss mechanism in OSCs. Several strategies can be applied for manipulating the energetic disorder from both molecular design and device engineering aspects. For example, the A–D–A type SMA IDIC-4F, the fluorinated analog of 2,2 0-((2Z,20Z)-((4,4,9,9-tetrahexyl-4,9-dihydro-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b0]dithiophene-2,7-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (IDIC), when paring with the same small molecule donor DRCN5T, the BHJ containing the fluorinated A–D A′D–A type SMAs possessed much smaller energetic disorder and suppressed recombination properties (Fig. 4c). As a consequence, the fluorination strategy improved the PCE of all small molecule OSCs from 6.80% to 9.25%.83 In addition, introducing the third component to form a ternary BHJ mixture has also proven to be an effective method to tune the charge transfer state and energetic disorder (Fig. 4b), and their correlation with morphological properties and device parameter is demonstrated.84

The recent emergent A–DA′D–A type SMAs have dramatically promoted the development of the efficiency of the OSCs field (Fig. 5). Despite these significant breakthroughs, it is worth noting that A–DA′D–A SMAs have also experienced 4 years of development from BZIC (the first A–DA′D–A type SMA)32 with a PCE of over 6% to now over 19%.50 This progress originates from continued exploration of the underlying relationship between the intrinsic properties of the molecules and device engineering. Among them, one way to further improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs is to lower the non-radiative recombination loss and energetic disorder. One of the most important design strategies to reduce energetic disorder and improve efficiency is the addition of side chains attached at the terminal β position of the fused central backbone (Fig. 4d). For example, Zou's group introduced two n-hexyl side chains into ladder-type fused ring-dithieno[3,2-b]pyrrolobenzotriazole (BZTP) of end-group fluorinated BZIC (Y25) to synthesize a new SMA Y26.32,85 The results showed that adding alkyl chains to the β site of thiophene is beneficial to achieving a highly unified conformation and thus reducing the DOS width, which indicates narrow energetic distribution in the LUMO orbital of Y26 (see Fig. 5). The suppressed energetic disorder obtained from the GDM analysis for Y26 based BHJ is consistent with the above observation of the improved electron mobilities and smaller recombination behaviour in the corresponding thin film, thus facilitating charge carrier transport and enabling higher Voc, Jsc and FF. This strategy has also been successfully applied to heptacyclic A–DA′D–A acceptors. Wu and Zou et al. investigated the properties of a A–DA′D–A type acceptor (Y11) with torsion-free molecular conformation to realize a very low energetic disorder, leading to efficient OSCs with a high PCE of 16.54% and reduced non-radiative recombination of only 0.17eV.56 By applying a sensitive EQE method, the as-cast PM6:Y11 film showed exceptionally low energetic disorder with an EU of 25.6 ± 0.3 meV. In contrast, an EU of 46.5 ± 1.1 meV for the PM6:PC71BM film was obtained. The Y11-based devices using different annealing temperatures also exhibited low EU values, with 26.5 ± 0.4 meV for 130 °C annealed and 26.7 ± 0.4 meV for 150 °C annealed, respectively. Similar results of Urbach energies have been obtained by Fourier-transform photocurrent spectroscopy (FTPS) measurements, demonstrating the great effect of low energy disorder on reducing the energy loss of OSCs. Generally, fine-tuning the molecular structures could effectively regulate the molecular packing behaviour and consequently play an important role in reducing the energetic disorder properties. In order to understand how the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of A–DA′D–A type acceptors can be influenced by alkyl side chains, Zou et al. investigated the effects of alkyl side chains on the physicochemical and photovoltaic properties of a series of A–DA′D–A type acceptors (Y3, Y11 and Y18) with the same backbone but without (Y3) or with different alkyl side chains (n-undecyl side chain for Y11 and n-hexyl side chain for Y18).45,86–88 When blended with the same polymer donor PM6, the OSCs based on alkyl substituted acceptors (Y11 and Y18) presented higher PCEs of 15.27% and 16.02%, respectively, while the Y3-based device could only give a PCE of 13.24%. By using temperature dependent J–V measurements, they found that the hole energetic disorder (σh) values of the three BHJ films are quite similar, ranging from 52 to 57 meV. However, the electron energetic disorder (σe) value of 71 meV in the Y3-based BHJ film is much higher than that of the other two alkyl chain substituted acceptor based BHJ films, revealing that the “wing”-containing molecules could achieve a favourable and ordered molecular orientation with low energetic disorder and therefore facilitate and balance charge carrier transport (Fig. 4d).

In parallel, Lin and co-workers designed a selenium-containing analog (Y6Se), by replacing the sulfur atom of the thiazole unit of Y6 with selenium atoms. The as-cast OSCs based on D18: Y6Se presented a high efficiency of 17.7%.57 By using FTPS-EQE measurements, a very low Urbach energy of 20.4 meV was obtained for the thin Y6Se film, benefiting from the improved molecular rigidity caused by the reduced aromaticity and increased quinoid character of the selenium-containing molecule. When compared to the blend films of D18: Y6 (24.8 meV), the D18: Y6Se blend films also showed a smaller Urbach energy of 21.8 meV, which is consistent with the reduced nonradiative energy loss of 0.215 eV for D18:Y6Se-based OSCs. So and Yuan et al. investigated the effects of the π-conjugation length of A–DA′D–A type acceptors on the energetic disorder and heat energy transfer, as well as the photovoltaic performance and stability. Three benzotriazole-based A–DA′D–A molecules with different π-conjugation lengths (five fused rings for BZ4F-5, six fused rings for BZ4F-6 and seven fused rings for BZ4F-7) were systematically investigated and discussed.89 With the extension of π-conjugation length, the EU values gradually decreased from 31.2 to 25.2, and 22.9 meV for BZ4F-5, BZ4F-6, and BZ4F-7 BHJ blend films. Interestingly, by using scanning photothermal deflection spectroscopy, they found that the thermal diffusivity (D) increases linearly upon increasing the acceptor central rings from five to seven, which is beneficial for improving the thermal stability of OSCs (Table 1). Huang et al. and Chen et al. proved that the terminal side chain engineering could be applied in non-covalently fused-ring electron acceptors as well.90,91 Alkylated (β position) NoCA-5 could reduce the energetic disorder and energy loss (due to enhanced molecular rigidity and intermolecular π–π stacking), thus improving the Voc, Jsc and FF, simultaneously. These findings demonstrate that the strategy of molecular-design could be an effective strategy to reduce the energetic disorder, thus leading to efficient organic solar cells.

Besides the view of molecular design strategies, device engineering also plays an important role to reduce energetic disorder in the blends. As mentioned before, due to the nature of organic semiconductors, the weak intra- and inter-molecular interactions, conformational diversity etc. will lead to a diverse morphology of OSCs, contributing to the DOS broadening and energetic disorder. The device fabrication technology and post-treatments of the active layer could be effective methods to finetune the energetic disorder in OSCs. Lots of studies have demonstrated that the morphological characteristics, including molecular packing and phase separation, of the active layer could be well addressed by the device processing methods and post-treatments. Lauter et al. revealed that the right amount of diiodooctane (DIO) promotes the enhancement of the mobility of holes and electrons by affecting the energetic disorder and electric field dependence of the mobility.92 Beiley et al. have investigated the thermal annealing treatment on the charge transport properties, molecular packing and energetic disorder of polymer PCDTBT.93 Moreover, the influence of a commonly used solvent additive, DIO, on the charge transport properties and energetic disorder of the PBDTTT-C-T:PC71BM system has been deeply investigated by Gao et al.94 By using DIO in their blends, the energetic disorder could be decreased. Wide-angle (WAXS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements suggest the origin of this reduced energetic disorder is due to increased aggregation and a larger average fullerene domain size together with purer phases upon the addition of DIO. Zhang et al. showed that the charge transport properties are correlated with the energetic disorder at the D-A interface, and the reduced energetic disorder in a non-fullerene blend can be mainly attributed to molecular ordering with preferential out-of-plane π–π stacking.82 Furthermore, different interactions or miscibility between the donor molecules and the acceptor molecules will lead to different morphological properties, including the domain size of phase separation, aggregation orientation and phase purity etc., thus leading to the different energetic disorders of the blend films. Kan and coworkers employed 1-fluoronaphthalene (FN) as an additive system to optimize the miscibility of the PM6:Y6 blend system. The results showed that the additive-induced miscibility and morphology control strategy could suppress both hole and electron energetic disorder in the BHJ blend, resulting in the enhanced Jsc and FF.95
On the device physics side, Shoaee and co-workers thoroughly investigated the effect of energetic disorder on mobility and recombination and thus overall performance.96 Blends of PM6:Y6 with the different energetic disorders of the free carriers were analysed in terms of mobility and recombination coefficient. Using a space charge limited current (SCLC) technique, it was found that by increasing the thickness of the active layer, the hole energetic disorder (of PM6) in the blend increased, resulting in reduced carrier mobility. Using bias assisted charge extraction to gain information on the recombination of the free carriers, it was further revealed that the recombination coefficient increased with the increased energetic disorder. Both of these negative effects are reflected in the FF and device performance. Consistently, it was shown that by engineering to reduce the energetic disorder of the active layer, the carrier mobility increased while the recombination coefficient of the free carriers became suppressed, which overall enhanced the FF and PCE. In this work, the change in disorder was related to the better crystallization of Y6 in the blend.
The interrelation between structural order, energetic disorder and device performance was highlighted in a recent study by Neher and co-workers.97 Here, the authors performed temperature-dependent charge transport, charge recombination and VOC studies on blends of PM6 with either Y6 or N4. Compared to Y6, N4 exhibits slightly longer side chains, with the result of better solubility, less strong aggregation, and stronger intermixing with the PM6 donor phase.98 As a result, the PM6:N4 blend has a significantly larger disorder, particularly of the donor HOMO. This was assigned to the broadening of the polymer HOMO in the presence of the dipolar N4 molecules. The larger disorder had a significant effect not only on the VOC at room temperature, but also the steepness of its temperature dependence. In turn, extrapolating VOCversus temperature yielded an unrealistically low CT energy. PM6:Y6 was shown to benefit from a narrower Gaussian-type density of state distribution, giving promise for the development of NFA-based solar cells with even smaller energy losses once the origin of the energetic disorder is properly understood.
Summary and outlook
Generally, to realize high efficiency OSCs, short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage and fill factor must be maximized as much as possible. Therefore, the improvement of charge transport properties and the decrease of energy losses have become very important challenges. Through the discussion above, one can conclude that the reduced energy disorder in the active layer can make a significant difference to the charge transport, and mean a higher potential for lower energy losses. Therefore, developing novel material design and/or device optimization strategies to reduce the energetic disorder will become one of the most effective strategies to design the next-generation high performance OSC devices.
In terms of material design strategy, the energetic disorder can be influenced by the structural features of organic materials, and designing new organic materials with torsion-free molecular conformations is critically important. Although the material design strategy to effectively lower the energetic disorder of OSCs is not yet perfectly clear, studies summarized in this review have shown that precise control of the structure of organic materials can be a direct and effective method. For instance, high crystallinity, good molecular rigidity and small reorganization energy seem essential for the realization of the above goal. In addition, with the rapid progress of OSCs, more in-depth research on the structure-property relationship has derived lots of molecular modification methods, which are worthy of further study to investigate the effects on the molecular conformation properties, as well as energetic disorder. Specifically, materials that contain conjugated macrocyclic units usually possess strong crystallinity. Rational introduction of non-covalent interaction, such as hydrogen bond, F⋯S interaction, and O⋯S interaction etc., could effectively finetune the molecular planarity and crystallinity properties. Besides, the steric effect is another important strategy to adjust the molecular packing and miscibility properties. Furthermore, recent studies have also shown that the molecular symmetry of organic materials seems to be a significant factor that affects the molecular packing behaviour.
Apart from the effects of chemical structure on the molecular skeleton, conformational diversity of the organic materials will generate diverse thin film morphologies, leading to the DOS broadening and increased energetic disorder. The film processing method of the active layer would have a great impact on the blend morphologies, such as molecular packing characteristics, molecular aggregation behaviour, phase separation and phase purity, which would affect the energetic disorder in OSCs. Recent studies have demonstrated the post-treatment, such as thermal annealing, solvent additive, and solvent vapor annealing treatment, have the ability to modulate the intermolecular (donor/acceptor (D/A) interface) and intramolecular (bulk) disorder in blends, which is beneficial for realizing a reduced energetic disorder. Except for adjusting the vertical phase separation, the layer-by-layer processing method has a certain role in reducing the disorder. The ternary blend strategy is another effective method to mitigate energetic disorder. With the addition of the third component (or solid additives) to the active layer, the molecular packing, the crystallinity and phase purity of the ternary active layer can be gradually enhanced. This leads to the reduced energetic disorder and decreased trap density and narrower DOS in BHJ OSCs, which then prevents charge carrier radiative below the bandgap and non-radiative recombination in photovoltaic devices, decreased energy loss, accompanied by the enhanced FF of the ternary devices. In addition, considering the great impact of the interactions or miscibility, which will lead to different molecular interactions, phase separation behaviors and phase purity, between the donor and the acceptor molecules on the morphological characteristics of the blend films, the match of the donor and acceptor materials should also be taken into account to realize reduced energetic disorder and photovoltaic performance.
Therefore, when aiming to realize higher performance OSCs, one should pay more attention to the mechanism and strategy from the viewpoint of materials and devices to reduce energetic disorder. Firstly, we could put forward new material design strategies to regulate the molecular packing properties. Specifically, the methods related to molecular conformation properties and intermolecular interaction, such as steric effect and non-covalent interaction, are highly needed. Meanwhile, the structure–property relationship between organic materials and energetic disorder should be deeply investigated. Secondly, the morphological properties of the BHJ films should be carefully regulated, and a new morphological processing method to mitigate the energetic disorder in blend films should be developed. Finally, designing specific third components (or solid additives) to regulate molecular packing is also of great importance. With all the integrated efforts mentioned above, we believe that the energetic disorder can be effectively decreased, and this will be one of the most important strategies to develop next-generation organic photovoltaic materials.

Broader context
The need for sustainable renewable energy technologies is urgent due to increasing energy consumption, climate change, and depletion of fossil fuels. The utilization of solar energy through photovoltaic technologies is certainly one of the most promising ways to meet the world's growing energy demand. Organic solar cells (OSCs) represent an emerging solution for low-cost clean energy production, owing to their advantages of light weight, flexibility, and low toxicity. Despite the rapid development of OSCs in recent years, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are not high enough to compete against mature inorganic photovoltaic technologies. One reason for the relatively low PCEs comes from the lack of highly crystalline structure and amorphous nature of organic semiconductors. This nature endows OSCs with intense electronic state interactions, strong structural disorder, and thereby the presence of energetic disorder. The recently reported state-of-the-art small molecule acceptor-based devices possessing small energetic disorder can achieve a high power conversion efficiency. This particularly encouraging phenomenon inspires many recent investigations exploring the disorder properties in OSCs. Understanding the relation between molecular design and energetic disorder is essential within OSCs toward the goal of competing with inorganic photovoltaics.
