    , Accepted 5th January 2011First published on 31st January 2011AbstractWe report the use of a solution-processed ZnO nanoparticle buffer layer in hybrid solar cells based on blends of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and CdSe quantum dots. Depending on the size of the CdSe nanocrystal, these devices exhibit 20–70% higher photocurrent output than similar devices without the ZnO nanoparticle layer, which is attributed to a combination of electronic and optical effects. With negligible change in open-circuit voltage and a small increase in the fill factor, the power conversion efficiency of these P3HT:CdSe hybrid solar cells was increased by 30–80% with incorporation of the ZnO nanoparticle layer. The presence of the ZnO nanoparticle layer also drastically improves the stability of these hybrid solar cells. Less than 40% loss in efficiency was observed for such devices after 70 days of exposure to the laboratory ambient without any type of encapsulation.
Organic-based photovoltaic (PV) devices have attracted great attentions because of their potentials for large-scale and low-cost solar energy conversion.1–5Inorganic nanoparticles have also been combined with conjugated polymers to form hybrid photovoltaic cells using solution processing, and maximum power conversion efficiencies in the range of 2–3% have been achieved.6,7 However, operation or storage of these hybrid devices in air, even with encapsulation, leads to material degradation due to penetration of oxygen and water molecules such as through the top electrodevia pinholes and grain boundaries.8,9Water and oxygen may lead to oxidation of the low work function layer in the cathode contact, and/or photo-oxidation of the active materials that can degrade the performance of photovoltaic cells by lowering the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and/or the fill factor (FF). In addition, Al atoms from the top electrode may diffuse into the active layer and act as quenching/recombination centers.10 Lee et al. reported11 that a titanium oxide layer between the Al cathode and the active layer in a polymer:fullerene PV device can mitigate such problems and significantly increase the lifetime, although their devices still showed a 50% loss of the power conversion efficiency (PCE, ηP) after only six days of storage in a dry N2 glovebox. Hau et al. reported that an inverted polymer:fullerene PV device retained >80% of the original PCE after 40 days in air, in which silver was used as the anode and ZnO nanoparticles coated on the indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent electrode was used as the cathode.12 In this work, we have studied the effects of incorporating a solution-processed ZnO nanoparticle layer on the performance of hybrid PV cells based on blends of the conjugated polymer poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and CdSe quantum dots (Qdots). We find that incorporation of the ZnO nanoparticle layer leads to a 30–80% enhancement in the device efficiency, and >60% of the original efficiency is retained even after exposing the unencapsulated device to the laboratory ambient for 70 days.

        ZnO
        nanoparticles (NPs) with diameters of 3–4 nm were synthesized using a sol–gel method.13 As-prepared ZnO NPs were soluble in polar solvents such as ethanol, but insoluble in non-polar solvents such as chlorobenzene which is used for the preparation of P3HT:CdSe blends. This allows for the fabrication of multi-layer PV structures as shown in Fig. 1a using solution processing with orthogonal solvents. As an n-type semiconductor, ZnO NP layers have much higher electron mobilities (6.6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1s−1) than amorphous TiOx thin film (1.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1s−1),14,15 and ZnO NPs have been used together with polymers to form hybrid heterojunction PV devices.16–19 Moreover, ZnO NPs strongly absorb the high energy, near ultraviolet (UV) photons which may otherwise cause photo-oxidation and degradation of polymer-based optoelectronic devices.
 Fig. 1  Schematic device structure (a) and energy level diagram (b) of hybrid P3HT:CdSe solar cells with a ZnO NP buffer layer between the cathode and the hybrid active layer. Energies in (b) are referenced from the vacuum level in eV. 
The energy level alignment in the hybrid PV devices studied here is schematically shown in Fig. 1b (the energies are referenced to the vacuum level).20,21 While P3HT and CdSe form a donor–acceptor heterojunction that facilitates the dissociation of photogenerated excitons (bound electron-hole pairs),6 the ∼1 eV lower conduction band edge of ZnO as compared to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of P3HT may also lead to dissociation of excitons in P3HTvia rapid electron transfer to ZnO. The similar electron affinities of ZnO and CdSe also suggest that there is a negligible barrier height for electron transport from CdSe towards the Al cathode. Furthermore, the very deep valence band of ZnO creates a large barrier height of 1–2 eV to block hole injection from the P3HT:CdSe active layer into ZnO.

Fig. 2a compares the current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of two hybrid P3HT:CdSe PV devices, with or without a 30 nm thick ZnO NP layer, under 1 sun (=100 mW cm−2) AM 1.5G solar illumination. The two devices are identical other than the presence or absence of the ZnO NP layer, and the CdSe Qdots in the hybrid active layer have a size of 5.0 ± 0.3 nm. Clearly, Fig. 2a shows that the photovoltaic response from the hybrid PV cells is drastically improved with the incorporation of the ZnO NP layer. The photovoltaic performance parameters (JSC, VOC, FF, and ηP) of these two devices are also summarized in Table 1. Here, the introduction of the ZnO NP layer leads to an approximately 70% increase in JSC from 2.6 to 4.4 mA cm−2 as shown in Fig. 2a, an increase of FF from 0.42 to 0.47, and a negligible reduction in VOC. Overall this leads to an increase of ηP from 0.83% to 1.48%, an improvement of approximately 80%, with the incorporation of the ZnO NP layer. The external quantum efficiencies (EQE) or the incident photon to current conversion efficiencies (IPCE) for these two devices are compared in Fig. 2b. The device with the ZnO NP layer clearly has a much higher EQE, especially for wavelengths longer than ∼450 nm. Integrating the EQE data with the standard one sun AM 1.5G solar spectrum yields JSC values within 5–10% of the experimental data.

(a) Current density–voltage characteristic of the devices under 1 sun AM 1.5G irradiation. (b) External quantum efficiency (EQE) as a function of the wavelength for these two devices. (c) and (d) Optical intensity profile in the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm for the devices without and with the ZnO layer, respectively. The respective materials in individual layers are indicated, and the colored intensity scales are shown to the right of (c) and (d). 
Previously we have shown that the efficiency of hybrid solar cells (without a ZnO NP layer) based on blends of P3HT and CdSe Qdots increases with increased size of the CdSe Qdots from 4 to 6.8 nm.21 As have been listed in Table 1, for the devices without a ZnO layer, the PCE nearly doubles when the CdSe Qdot size is increased from 5.0 ± 0.3 nm to 6.5 ± 0.6 nm, with the most significant contribution from the increase in JSC (CdSe Qdots with 8–10 nm in size cause significant aggregation in the mixed solvent of chlorobenzene and pyridine, leading to poor film quality and irreproducible photovoltaic performance).21 For devices based on the 6.5 nm CdSe Qdots, we also observed an increase in ηP from (1.7 ± 0.1)% to (2.2 ± 0.2)% when a ZnO NP layer was inserted between the hybrid active layer and the cathode. The highest PCE obtained for devices with a ZnO NP layer is ηP = 2.4%. The magnitude of the efficiency increase in this case, approximately 30%, is somewhat smaller than in the case of smaller CdSe Qdots, although the most significant contribution to the efficiency increase still comes from the increase in JSC (over 20%), accompanied by a small reduction in VOC and a small increase in FF.
The significant increase in JSC in these P3HT:CdSe hybrid solar cells after the incorporation of a ZnO NP layer can be attributed to a combination of electronic, optical, and morphological effects. First, inclusion of the ZnO NP buffer layer prevents the direct quenching of photogenerated excitons in the active layer by the Al cathode. It also prevents the diffusion of Al atoms into the active layer upon deposition or post-deposition annealing, which would otherwise lead to recombination sites for excitons and/or charge carriers. Based on the energy level diagram shown in Fig. 1b, the deep valence band of ZnO presents a large barrier height to prevent the leakage of photogenerated holes in the active layer to the cathode. Furthermore, the type-II heterojunction between P3HT and ZnO also facilitates the dissociation of excitons generated in P3HT, enhancing their contribution to the photocurrent.
We have also calculated the optical intensity profile in the devices with or without the ZnO layer based on a transfer matrix theory22 using optical constants obtained from ellipsometry measurements. As shown in Fig. 2c (without ZnO) and 2d (with ZnO), overall the ZnO NP layer acts as a transparent optical spacer that better positions the hybrid active layer in the region with high optical field to maximize the total absorption. This effect is more positive in the longer wavelength region (500 nm < λ < 650 nm), as the longer wavelength light tends to have a maximum optical intensity position further away from the Al cathode due to the interference effect.22 This agrees well with the comparison of the EQE spectra shown in Fig. 2b.

Fig. 3 shows the surface morphology of the hybrid active layer before and after the coating of the ZnO NP layer as characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The root-mean-square (rms) surface roughness is reduced from 9.7 nm to 3.8 nm with the ZnO NP layer. A smoother interface is expected to improve the electrical contact between the cathode and the active layer, leading to more efficient collection of photogenerated electrons.

The incorporation of the ZnO NPs layer also drastically improves the environmental stability of the P3HT:CdSe hybrid solar cells. Without the ZnO layer, these hybrid solar cells typically die within several hours of exposure to air. However, as shown in Fig. 4, the 6.5 nm CdSe device with a ZnO layer suffers a 30% reduction in JSC after 70 days of exposure to air, which combined with slight reductions in VOC and FF leads to a reduction of ηP from 2.4% to 1.5%, for a relative change of less than 40%. Although the exact mechanisms of degradation in these hybrid solar cells are unclear at this moment, it is generally believed that absorption of UV photons leads to bond breaking and/or photo-oxidation (e.g. in the presence of water and/or oxygen molecules) with a consequent degraded performance. In addition to assisting photo-oxidation, oxygen and water may react with the active CdSe/P3HT layer and/or the electrode materials, changing the interfacial barriers and conductivities. We speculate that the ZnO NP layer reduces the rate of oxygen and water molecules transport to the active layer, resulting in improved device stability in air. We have observed that devices with a thicker ZnO NP layer possess even better stability in air, although the thicker ZnO NP layer displaces the active layer outside the highest optical intensity region (refer to Fig. 2d) and results in lower device efficiency. Finally, the ZnO layer is more stable than low work function interfacial layers, such as Ca, Mg or Li2F, therefore improved lifetimes are expected.

In summary, hybrid PV devices with a CdSe Qdots/P3HT active layer and a ZnO nanoparticle-based buffer layer have been demonstrated. The ZnO NP layer serves to enhance the optical field inside the active region, blocks leakage of photogenerated holes towards the cathode, and improves the harvesting of photogenerated excitons in the active layer by reducing quenching caused by the cathode and by enhancing dissociation with a type-II heterojunction with P3HT. Depending on the size of the CdSe Qdots, a 20–70% improvement in JSC and a 30–80% improvement in ηP were obtained with the incorporation of the ZnO NP layer. Furthermore, the presence of the ZnO layer also drastically slows down the degradation of the hybrid solar cells, and 60–70% of the original power conversion efficiency for ZnO devices was retained after 70 days exposed to laboratory ambient without any device encapsulation, compared to only a few hours of lifetime for devices without the ZnO layer. The new device architecture described here, i.e. with a ZnO buffer layer between the active layer and the metal cathode, should also hold promise to increase the efficiency and stability of hybrid solar cells based on other materials, such as inorganic nanorods and near-infrared absorbing nanocrystals or polymers.6,25,26
Experimental
Synthesis

          ZnO
          nanoparticles were synthesized by a sol–gel process13 using Zn acetate and tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH). In a typical sol–gel process, nanoparticles were synthesized by dropwise addition of a stoichiometric amount of tetramethylammonium hydroxide dissolved in ethanol (0.55 M) to 30 ml of 0.1 M Zn acetate dihydrate dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) followed by stirring for an hour at room temperature. After washing at least two times in heptane:ethanol (v:v = 1:3), ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in pure ethanol with a concentration of ∼30 mg ml−1.

          CdSe Qdots were synthesized following the literature.23 CdO (0.5 mmol), oleic acid (10 mmol) and trioctylphosphine oxide (TOPO) (2.5 mmol) were heated to 280 °C under a nitrogen atmosphere in a three-neck, round bottom flask to form an optically transparent solution. In a separate airtight container, 0.5 mmol of Se was dissolved into 1.5 ml of trioctylphosphine (TOP) to form a TOP–Se solution. Subsequently, 1.5 ml of TOP–Se solution was swiftly injected into the three-neck flask using a syringe. After the injection, the temperature was maintained at 280–290 °C. The reaction was allowed to proceed for up to 5 min and then stopped by adding room temperature toluene. After being washed with toluene and precipitated in methanol more than three times, the Qdots were mixed overnight with pyridine for ligand exchange.
Devices preparation

          PV devices were fabricated on glass substrates commercially pre-coated with a layer of indium tin oxide (ITO) with a sheet resistance of ∼20 Ω sq−1. The substrates were cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol consecutively for 45 min, and then treated in an ultraviolet ozone generator for 15 min before being spin-coated with poly(3,4-ethylene dioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonic acid (PEDOT:PSS). After being baked in air at 150 °C for 15 min, the substrates were transferred to a glovebox for spin coating of the CdSe:P3HT active layer and the ZnO NP layer. Both of P3HT/CdSe (30 mg ml−1 in chlorobenzene:pyridine = 9:1 by volume) and ZnO NPs (30 mg ml−1, ethanol) solution were spin-coated at 1000 rpm and 4000 rpm for 30 s, respectively, followed by baking at 145 °C for 30 min in nitrogen in the glovebox. This results in thicknesses of approximately 80 nm for P3HT:CdSe and 30 nm for the ZnO NP layer. Samples were then loaded into a vacuum deposition chamber (background pressure ≈3 × 10−7 torr) to deposit the 100 nm thick aluminium cathode with a shadow mask (device area of 4 mm2).
Film and device characterization

          AFM images of the P3HT:CdSe hybrid films with or without a ZnO NP layer on top were taken on a Veeco multimode AFM with a Nanoscope controller in the tapping mode. The J–V characteristics of the hybrid solar cells were obtained in air using an Agilent 4155B semiconductor parameter analyzer, and an Oriel Xe-arc lamp coupled with an AM 1.5G filter was used to simulate sunlight. The light intensity was calibrated with a silicon reference cell with a KG5 filter following standard solar cell testing procedures.24 At least 20 devices for each configuration were fabricated and tested, from which an average performance was obtained.
