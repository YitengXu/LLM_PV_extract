    AbstractLimits and optimization of a solar energy conversion system consisting of a photochemical charge separating unit coupled to an energy storage state are explored by multi-objective genetic algorithms. Pareto fronts were evaluated to obtain information about the ideal parameter combinations, guaranteeing highest efficiency. The light absorbing and charge separating unit is described by a chain of chromophores and electron carriers, connected by Marcus type electron transfer processes. It is coupled to the thermal equilibrium of charge conduction and transport in an energy storage system according to the principle of detailed balance. In addition to our previous findings for an optimal charge separation unit, consisting of a minimum number of charge carriers with adapted recombination and reaction rates, the complete photochemical unit must fulfil further requirements. Low reorganization energies are found to be essential for the initial charge separation steps and can be realized by a low dielectric constant in the local environment. The identified optimal operation rates can be realized by antenna systems adapted to the illumination conditions. For standard solar illumination and a realistic parameter setting energy conversion efficiencies up to 26.8% are predicted, comparable to the limit (31.8%) of ideal single junction semiconductor solar cells.
Introduction
One of the main challenges for the future development of human society is the global energy supply by regenerative energy sources. The present extensive consumption of fossil energy carriers compel us to utilize all forms of regenerative energy, especially solar energy. Currently solar energy is used in large quantities by photosynthesis in bacteria, algae or plants via agricultural products. Promising candidates for the direct technical conversion of solar energy to electrical or chemical energy are semiconductor-based photovoltaic,1,2 dye sensitized solar cells (the Graetzel-cell)3 and photochemical (or artificial photosynthetic) energy conversion.4 Major challenges for photochemical energy conversion are the design of light harvesting and charge separating units which generate a long lived charged separated state and the coupling to an energy storage site.5 Solar energy converting units have to operate at high energy conversion efficiency which is achieved by covering the broad solar spectrum, efficient charge separation with high quantum yield and the storage of the charges at sufficiently high voltages. The general design of any quantum solar energy conversion device can be explained using a semiconductor-based solar cell as an example (see Fig. 1(a)): here light with photon energy hν above the band gap Eg (hν > Eg = hνg) absorbed in the inversion layer of a p–n-junction generates an electron–hole pair. The charges of opposite sign are separated in the inversion layer and transferred to the respective external contacts. Continuous illumination leads to a current I of photo-induced charges, which is used at a voltage U. The electrical power P = UI is available for external use or for energy storage e.g. in an electrochemical storage battery.
 Fig. 1  Comparison of charge separation processes in single junction photovoltaics (a) and bacterial reaction centers (RC) (b). The photo-processes taking place in the reaction center resembles those in a photodiode (for details see text). Within the reactive unit (RU) charge separation has to occur at high efficiency. 
For single band-gap semiconductor based energy conversion Shockley and Queisser derived the ideal solar energy conversion efficiency.1 They combined the solar irradiation—its irradiating power and its spectral distribution—with ideal light absorption and 100% charge separation efficiency. The temperature dependent current–voltage characteristics of the diode revealed an ideal energy efficiency of 31.8% of single gap devices at the optimum band gap energy of hνg = 1.3 eV at full solar irradiation. The main process limiting the conversion efficiency in a single gap junction is the loss of photon excess energy for hν > hνg. Due to the idealized system design of Shockley and Queisser further improvements in the efficiency can only be realized by changing the basic structure of the quantum energy conversion device. In third-generation solar cells the exploitation of the excess energy of generated charge carriers by Auger generation,6 the use of hot carrier cells7 or the minimization of the excess energy in multi-junction cells8,9 leads to an improvement of efficiency. Other third-generation devices benefit from concentrated illumination,10 or thermophotonics.11 An overview of efficiency limits of third-generation solar cells can be found in ref. 12. The limiting factors of dye-sensitized solar cells have been outlined.13
Solar energy conversion in bacterial photosynthesis contains the same basic elements as single junction photovoltaics (see Fig. 1(b)). Light absorption in the reaction centers (RC) (e.g. directly or via an antenna system) populates an excited electronic state, followed by charge separation and transfer along a chromophore chain with appropriately tuned redox potentials. The charges generated in this reactive unit (RU) induce a concentration gradient of molecular charge carriers across a membrane system. This electrochemical gradient is used within the energy storing system (ESS) to generate energy-rich compounds. Unlike in semiconductors, the absorption spectrum of the initially populated excited state does not cover the solar spectrum. Thus a light-harvesting unit is required to assure down-conversion of photons with higher energies than the gap energy hνg, making available a broad energy range of the solar spectrum. Additionally the photon flux within the RC is controlled via the antenna system. An optimized light-harvesting unit has to be able to balance the energy flux towards the RC. Under low light conditions the extended antenna leads to an increase of the overall cross section and can thus be considered as a gain factor Θ. At bright light conditions regulation mechanisms have to protect the RC by non-photochemical quenching, mediated by e.g. carotenoids.14
It is the aim of this publication to describe the energy conversion efficiency for photochemical systems inspired by bacterial photosynthesis using the boundary conditions imposed by thermodynamics. The thermodynamic limit of the monochromatic energy conversion efficiency in photosynthesis has been discussed in the early work of Knox and Parson.15,16 Here, we focus on the design of multi-step electron transfer units, which have been synthesized and studied.17–20 Within this ansatz we consider a photochemical unit (PU) which consists of a reactive unit (RU) and an energy storing system (ESS) (see Fig. 2). The RU is responsible for initial charge transfer and separation, subsequent long distance charge transport and energy storage occurs within the ESS. While the optimization of the quantum efficiency of the RU has been discussed recently,21–24 the combination with the energy storing and transport device (ESS) is still missing. For the description of the complete photochemical unit (PU) we couple the RU, driven by defined solar irradiation power, to the energy storing system (ESS) according to the principle of detailed balance. Finally, we will characterize the PU by the storage voltage U and the transport current I. We will derive an upper limit for the overall energy efficiency η of the PU, taking into account the impact of intrinsic antenna systems on the efficiency. We will show that a realistic chemical solar energy conversion system can reach efficiencies, which are comparable to the limits of an ideal single band gap semiconductor cell.
 Fig. 2  Model set-up: the processes in a photochemical unit (PU) are described by a model of m + 1 coupled electron carriers. The reactive unit (RU) is highlighted in grey. Here transfer rates are described by non-adiabatic electron transfer theory over n charge carriers (CC). The RU is thermodynamically coupled by a rate  to the energy storing system (ESS). The charges are generated at a rate ΓUtil and at a potential U. For details of the evaluation of the transfer rates see text. 
The paper is outlined as follows: In section 2 we present the structure of the photochemical energy conversion unit (PU) and its theoretical basis. The working equations describe the RU using Marcus type electron transfer theory as shown recently in ref. 24. We extend this model by considering non-ideal activated electron transfer and the dielectric constant of the surroundings. The principle of detailed balance is introduced to couple the RU with charge transfer and energy storing system (ESS) and to account for losses induced via back reactions over the RU. This concept allows a direct comparison between the efficiency of the PU and the results given by Shockley and Queisser for semiconductor systems. In section 3 the optimization procedure is described. We outline the used evolutionary algorithms and define the different optimization objectives. In section 4 results of the optimizations are presented. We focus on (i) the analysis of the evolutionary optimization yielding optimal quantum yield of the RU, (ii) deviations from the optimal, non-activated electron transfer scenario, (iii) comparison of the efficiency of the photochemical device (PU) with semiconductor systems and (iv) the influence of the antenna size and dimmed solar irradiation.
Model for electron transfer in photochemical reaction centers
The photochemical unit (PU) as a model for artificial energy converting systems consists of a photochemical reactive unit (RU) coupled to an energy storing system (ESS) (see Fig. 2). The electron transfer (ET) processes within the RU are mediated by a setup of electron carriers, which is closely related to the ET setup in bacterial RC. n chromophores/electron carriers are represented by an energy level of a delocalized π-state. These levels are connected by the forward and backward electron transfer rates () and to the initial electron donor 0 by a rate  of charge recombination. In natural RC the ET rates can be identified as follows:25 the rate  is the ET from the special pair P, as initial electron donor, to the accessory Bacteriochlorophyl B. The rate  corresponds to charge transfer from B to the Bacteriopheophytine H, and  belongs to the transfer from H to the quinone Q. During the charge separation process within the RU n intermediate radical pair states are formed (Fig. 2, grey) and an amount of energy ΔGRU is dissipated. We define a terminating reaction rate , which can be identified as rate of neutralization of the initial electron donor by external contacts, or in natural RC by cytochromes as internal electron donor. The efficiency of the initial charge separation processes is characterized by the quantum yield of charge separation ΦRU and the dissipated energy ΔGRU.
The coupling between the RU and the ESS is mediated by the rate . Within the ESS energy rich compounds are transferred away from the RU by charge conduction or diffusion processes on a μs to s timescale. This generates a concentration gradient, which can be further utilized. The back coupling between the ESS and the RU is realized by thermal repopulation of the RU intermediate radical pair states together with charge recombination at a rate Γm0 to assure a thermal equilibrium between both subunits of the PU. The potential gradient Uloss modulates Γm0 and defines the efficiency of the conduction process. The energy conversion of the PU is characterized by the transport current ΓUtile and the potential gradient U generated across a membrane system.
The time evolution of the system can be calculated from the master equation ansatz: (1)For a given set of transfer rates , Γm0 the quantum yield Φ of the energy conversion process can be calculated and the lifetimes τi of intermediate states can be extracted from the eigenvectors of the system.
Electron transfer (ET) rates in the reactive unit (RU)—Marcus theory
The ET rates from a donor i to an acceptor j are calculated according to Fermi`s golden rule: (2)
In the weak coupling limit (non-adiabatic electron transfer theory) the ET rates depend on two quantities, the electronic coupling matrix element Vij and the Franck–Condon Factors FCij (see Fig. 3). For the forward ET rates we consider the direct coupling between neighbouring chromophores.26 Under the assumption of maximal coupling V0 at van der Waals contact the size of Vij depends on the exponential decay parameter β and on a free variable, the tunnelling distance dij between chromophores (Fig. 3(b)).
 Fig. 3  Parameters of Marcus theory. (a) Marcus parabolas for electron transfer from donor D* to acceptor A. In a protein the reaction coordinate is given by the free energy function.29 (b) Exponential distance dependence of coupling VD*A from donor D* to acceptor A. 
For harmonic free energy surfaces in the high temperature limit the FCij can be calculated according to the Marcus equation:27,28 (3)with the free energy ΔGij, the activation energy ΔGij*, the reorganization energy λij, the Boltzmann constant kB and temperature T (all calculations are performed at room temperature T = 298 K). Although the initial ET steps in bacterial RC proceed nearly non-activated (ΔGij = −λij)29–31 we go beyond non-activated ET reactions in our model calculations.
It has been shown by Warshel et al.22 that the local dielectric plays an essential role for efficient charge separation over an isolating membrane and its tuning is still a demanding task for the design of artificial energy converting systems. Different continuum models exist to calculate the reorganization energies for intermolecular electron transfer reactions.32–34 In our investigations the reorganization energy λij is calculated for spherical cavities according to:33,34 (4)where e is the electron charge and ε0 is the optical dielectric constant of the external medium (usually taken as the square of the refractive index). W is the diameter of the electron carriers and dij is the tunnelling distance from donor i to the acceptor j. This model of the reorganization energy λij takes into account different values of the static dielectric permittivity εi at the position of the electron donor and in the vicinity of the acceptor (εj) and thus the dielectric heterogeneity of the local surroundings. The electron transfer cascade across an isolating membrane is used to generate a potential gradient across the barrier. The final charge separated state has to be stable outside the barrier in a high dielectric surrounding (e.g. in water a dielectric surrounding of the final electron acceptor of εj = 80 has to be reached). The static dielectric permittivity εi and εj as well as the free energy differences ΔGij enter the optimization procedure as variables and are optimized for high quantum yield ΦRU (see section 3).
The backward rate constants  are calculated from the forward rate constants  according to the principle of detailed balance (eqn (5)), which relates the probabilities of forward and backward processes. (5)
Two main loss channels limit the quantum yield ΦRU in the initial charge separation process. The internal conversion of the excited chromophore, taken into account as an intrinsic excited state lifetime τP* = 1/ of the initial donor, and charge recombination from the intermediate radical pair states , is calculated according to eqn (2). The electronic coupling of charge recombination Vi0 is calculated according to an extended super-exchange (SE) model: electron–hole recombination occurs by concerted tunneling through all barriers, which are located between chromophore i and the initial electron donor 0. The electronic coupling matrix element Vi0 is evaluated up to second order perturbation theory of the wave function.‡
Furthermore the charge recombination from intermediate radical pair states occurs in the inverted ET regime (ΔGi0 ≫ −λi0). In this regime coupling to intra-molecular modes of the super-molecule (e.g. the protein-matrix) has to be considered. The Franck–Condon factors FCi0 are evaluated in the high temperature limit using a multi-mode picture. The coupling of ET to the super-molecule is evaluated by an effective resonant mode ωH.35,36 (6)
The coupling-strength is determined by a single parameter SH, chosen for polar surrounding.35 The reorganization energy for charge recombination λi0 is approximated by the values of the forward ET reactions (λi0 = λi−1,i).
Using the ET-rates described above the quantum yield ΦRU of the initial charge separation process can be calculated with respect to the terminating rate  and a recombination rate  which characterize together with ΔGRU the efficiency of the RU. In natural RC the terminating rate  corresponds to the deactivation/re-reduction of the initial electron donor by cytochromes. An analogue can be found in dye-sensitized solar cells, where the oxidized dye is regenerated by an organic hole conductor.37
Current–voltage relation in the detailed balance limit
The ET cascade within the RU generates a reduced species at a chemical potential ΔGchem. Accordingly thermal repopulation of intermediate radical pair states together with charge recombination at a rate Γm0 is possible. The incorporation of Γm0 gives a proper description of the population of the high potential species and assures a thermal equilibrium between the RU and the ESS. For these steady state conditions we can compare photochemical units to single junction photovoltaics. In the following we will deduce the current–voltage (I–U) characteristic of such a photochemical energy converting system exposed to solar irradiation and incorporate the effect of varying illumination conditions.
We consider a equilibrium between generated charges at a rate Γgen and utilized or recombined charges at the rates ΓUtil and Γm0 (the thermal self-generation of electron–hole pairs at the initial electron donor 0 is neglected). The RU as the front-end device of the PU is able to generate electron–hole pairs at a generation rate Γgen per unit time: (7)
Here we consider, that the RU can only generate a charge-separated state if previous charge separation is completed at a rate . Secondary excitation of the primary electron donor has to be prevented by non-photochemical regulation mechanisms within the antenna system, which leads to a saturation of the generation rate Γgen. The rate of excitation by incident photons ΓEx is given by: ΓEx = PPhotonσRUΘ.(8)Pphoton corresponds to the usable photon flux (hν > hνg), in m−2 s−1 and is calculated from the incident power of the global AM1.5 spectrum (1000 W m−2). The effective absorption cross-section σRU of the reaction center RU (in m2) is determined by the initially excited chromophore e.g. chlorophylls. The gain Θ is introduced to describe the increase in absorption cross section due to an antenna system and to consider the variation of solar illumination relative to the AM1.5 situation (low vs. normal light exposure). The quantity, which enters the calculations is the effective rate ΓEx on the order of ≅ 101–105 s−1 (for details see results).
Electron hole recombination between the high potential state m and the initial donor 0 can occur at a rate Γm0 due to thermal repopulation of intermediate radical pair states according to the principle of detailed balance. In the semiconductor case, with only one defined band gap, thermal repopulation processes are described by the diode relation.1 The thermal recombination rate Γm0 of a photochemical system equals a system of multiple parallel diodes. All intermediate radical pairs states n contribute independently to the recombination process. (9)The rate Γm0 accounts for back reactions over the RU, with [i−m]/[im−] and [0+ ESS−]/[0 ESS] being the probabilities at temperature T to generate electron–hole pairs of intermediate charge carrier states. The differences in free energy follow the relation ΔGmi + Ulosse = ΔGi0 − Ue. In an optimized photochemical energy converting unit (PU)  constitutes the dominant loss channel and the system exhibits similar characteristics to semiconductor based photovoltaic devices (for details see results). The usable voltage U is available for subsequent processes such as the dark reaction, redox reactions to generate energy rich compounds, or an electric current. The dissipated potential Uloss describes the required driving force during the energy storing process. The rate ΓUtil available to drive these subsequent processes is given by ΓUtil = Γgen − Γm0,(10)with a resulting current IUtil = ΓUtile. The open circuit voltage Uoc is given by the condition ΓUtil = 0. The final current–voltage (I–U) relation of a photochemical energy-converting unit has the form: (11)and depends on the capability of the antenna/RU complex to generate electron–hole pairs and the usable voltage U supplied by the ESS. The overall quantum yield Φ of the energy converting system is given by: (12)which corresponds to the normalized current Inorm. The overall energy efficiency is given by: (13)with Pin being the incident light power (for details see below eqn (14) and following). With these definitions we have introduced the characteristic electrochemical quantities to photochemical energy conversion and are able to compare them with semiconductor-based photovoltaic energy conversion.
Algorithms and parameter regime
The major requirements of energy converting systems are maximum quantum yield Φ (eqn (12)) and/or highest energy efficiency η (eqn (13)). To fulfill both requirements an optimized ET cascade within the RU has to operate at highest quantum yield ΦRU and the subsequent thermodynamically driven energy storage process has to proceed at highest efficiency. We approach this multi-dimensional optimization problem by combining the underlying ET rate equation system with evolutionary algorithms (EA).
Optimization procedure and objectives
The optimization of ΦRU has been performed in a single objective formalism with the use of the covariance matrix evolutionary strategy (CMA-ES).38 The algorithm accumulates correlations by updating the covariance matrix of subsequent generations and local minima can be avoided. The major advantage of the CMA-ES is the use of small population sizes compared to common evolutionary algorithms (e.g. a genetic algorithm) and thus the reduced CPU requirement. The optimized quantum yield ΦRU, the optimized values of the free variables (namely the tunnelling distances dij and the differences in free energy ΔGij) and the lifetimes τi can be compared to the experimental findings. The search space of the variables is not restricted and thus the results serve as a reference for further optimizations. The corresponding variables ΔGij and dij are summarized in Table 1.

Further optimizations beyond the single objective formalism on ΦRU only address two questions: First the tolerated parameter space for the artificial RU to maintain an efficient ET cascade is explored. Second the optimum of the energy conversion efficiency η of photochemical systems is derived. These multi-dimensional optimizations are treated in a multi-objective formalism by use of the non-dominated sorting multi-objective genetic algorithm (NSGAII).39 In this formalism every solution is assigned to an objective vector, whose dimensionality is defined by the number of objectives. The decision which solution is superior to another is more complex than in conventional single objective genetic algorithms and is made by the sorting operator. Here the concept of Pareto-dominance plays a fundamental role. An objective vector prevails other vectors in one objective (of interest) if at least one component is superior than the corresponding components of all other vectors and no component is inferior. Such solutions are non-dominated (see Fig. 4, red solutions). Non-dominated solutions form a set of different objective vectors with varying impact of the individual objectives and build a Pareto front (see Fig. 4, red solutions). They represent the interdependency of several conflicting objectives.
 Fig. 4  Schematic of a typical Pareto front taken from ref. 46—all Pareto-optimal solutions are non-dominated (red). The converged population forms a Pareto front. 
The relevant objectives are subdivided into two groups and summarized in Table 1. The first group explores the tolerated parameter space for the artificial RU to enable high quantum yield ΦRU. Therefore the activation energy ΔGij* (defined in eqn (3)) of the first and second ET step together with ΦRU are chosen as conflicting objectives. This set of objectives leads to perturbations of optimal (non-activated) ET reactions. The converged multi-objective optimization provides a 3D-Pareto front, which obeys maximum quantum yield ΦRU for specific activation energies ΔGij*. The free variables are the tunnelling distances dij, the differences in free energy ΔGij and the static dielectric permittivity εi and εj at the position of electron donors i and acceptors j. The optimizations are performed at a fixed excitation energy hνg and constant ΔGRU, the parameters for the calculation of ET rates are given in Table 2, the search space of the variables is summarized in Table 1. As a result we obtain design criteria for the reorganization energy λij and the local dielectric in the vicinity of the charge carriers.

With the second group of objectives we are able to explore the parameter space for maximal energy conversion efficiency η of a PU. The objective η is a function of the overall quantum yield Φ (defined in eqn (12)), the usable voltage U (see eqn (9) and (11)), the band gap energy hνg of the initial electron donor 0 (see Fig. 1 and 2) and the ultimate efficiency u(hνg/kBTs).1 The efficiency η is calculated according to: (14)and describes the ratio of available power, supplied by the PU (Pout) to the power Pin, irradiated by the sun. The value of η can be compared to photovoltaic-based systems. The ultimate efficiency u(hνg/kBTs) is a function of the gap energy hνg and approximated for an absorbing black body at T = 298 K, irradiated by a black emitter at Ts = 6000 K according to:1 (15)It accounts for the fact that only photons with an energy hν ≥ hνg can be converted in a single band gap PU and has a maximum value of 44% at an excitation energy hνg of 1.09 eV (see Fig. 7, black line).
If the PU is irradiated with monochromatic light at the band gap energy hνg the monochromatic energy conversion efficiency ηmono characterizes the capability of the PU to convert the energy hνg into useable current IUtil and voltage U. The value of ηmono is given by: (16)and encoded as additional objective in the multi-objective formalism. ηmono can also be interpreted as the ratio of usable output power to the monochromatic power provided to the donor 0 and is then called Pnorm. To deduce the current–voltage characteristic of the PU under illumination conditions the normalized current Inorm = Φ (see eqn (12)) is optimized as third objective. These three objectives enable us to obtain additionally the associated current–voltage (I–U) characteristic of the PU in a single optimization run.
In addition to the free variables dij and ΔGij, the excitation energy hνg, the energy dissipated within the RU (ΔGRU), and the energy loss Uloss during transport and energy storage processes are encoded as free variables. Thus the optimal excitation energy hνg of the PU to work at highest efficiency η is adapted during the optimization procedure.§
Parameter regime
Different parameters enter the rate equations of the individual ET steps and act as boundary conditions on the PU. The parameters in the framework of non-adiabatic electron transfer theory (global parameters, summarized in Table 2) are the exponential decay parameter β,31,40 the optical dielectric permittivity ε0,41 the coupling strength SH of the electron motion and a high frequency mode ωH,35 the organism independent maximal electronic coupling V0 of chromophores at van der Waals contact42,43 and the internal reorganization energy λin of the redox cofactors.33 All of them are chosen to reflect the ET conditions in bacterial RC.
Parameters specific for the design of an artificial PU are the number n and the diameter W of the charge carriers. As shown recently24 and in agreement with the situation in bacterial RC42 the number of four redox centers (n = 4) is best suited to construct a RU which operates at high quantum yield ΦRU. The re-reduction of the initial electron donor 0, in bacterial RC by the cyctochrome c complex44 and in photochemical systems by external contacts mediated by e.g. an organic hole conductor like OMeTAD in the Graetzel cell37 enters the model as the terminating rate . The intrinsic rate of internal conversion  of the excited primary electron donor45 constitutes a major loss channel in bacterial RC and artificial PUs.
Results and discussion
The overall energy conversion process of a PU can be subdivided into two parts (see Fig. 2). The initial steps of charge separation on short timescales within the RU (from picoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds) have to generate a charge-separated state at a quantum yield ΦRU near to unity (see Fig. 2, grey box). During these initial steps direct charge recombination between radical pair states has to be prevented. Additionally energy dissipation (ΔGRU) has to be minimized to assure large energy efficiency. The thermal repopulation of intermediate radical pair states constitutes an additional loss channel at a rate Γm0, which depends on the generated potential U. First, we focus on the design of an optimized RU and its most sensitive ET steps, and second the efficiency limit of the PU is derived under steady state conditions.
Fast charge separation
Important for an artificial energy converting system is an optimized charge separation cascade in the RU. Therefore, we optimized at first the charge separation steps of a RU containing four electron carriers (Fig. 2, n = 4, grey box) under the assumption of non-activated ET reactions (ΔGij = −λij, eqn (1)–(5)) by the use of the CMA-ES algorithm. In Fig. 5 (top) the optimization curve of the best individual is depicted for the parameter regime of B. viridis (The parameters of ET reactions are summarized in Table 2). The best solution of ΦRU = 95.4% is asymptotically approached during the generations 24–100. The initial ET rates are  = 1/1.8 ps, followed by a faster second ET step of  = 1/0.9 ps, in good agreement with observed lifetimes in bacterial RC.45 The faster secondary ET step is a result of the shorter tunnelling distance d23, compared to d12, together with the optimized differences in free energy. The asymmetry of the lifetimes in the primary and secondary ET step and their tolerated limits for high ΦRU have been discussed previously.24 The third, irreversible ET step  is in the order of about 1/50–1/60 ps. To summarize, the key requirements for high quantum yield ΦRU are tunnelling distances below 4 Å in the first and second ET step, together with a nearly irreversible tertiary step.
 Fig. 5  Optimization curve of evolutionary optimization (CMA-ES) in the parameter regime of B. viridis. The quantum yield ΦRU together with the optimized variables are shown as a function of the optimization generation. 
From the optimization curve (Fig. 5, top) it can clearly be seen, that ΦRU < 80% can be achieved by various configurations of the chromophores. Only sufficient spatial separation between the initial donor and subsequent acceptors must be assured (see Fig. 5, generation 1–17). On the other hand when all three tunnelling distances are large ΦRU decreases (Fig. 5, generation 18). An increase in ΦRU up to 91% is realized by fast charge separation in the first and second charge transfer step together with optimization in the third step towards larger tunnelling distances (Fig. 5, generation 19–23). This strategy assures slow backward reactions for all charge carriers but keeps the initial charge separation sufficiently fast to reduce the initial recombination losses.
Scenario with activated ET reactions
The practical realization of non-activated ET steps is still challenging for artificial PU. In the following we discuss two perturbations of this optimal scenario, namely the activation energy ΔGij* (defined in eqn (3)) and the local dielectric εi in the vicinity of the different charge carriers. Therefore we calculated a 3D-Pareto front for the conflicting objectives quantum yield ΦRU and maximal deviation from the non-activated case (maximal ΔGij*) within the first and second ET step (see Fig. 6). The best quantum yield ΦRU is realized for small values ΔG12* = ΔG23* ≅ 0 meV, where the Pareto front reaches its maximum. The reorganization energy λij as additional degree of freedom cannot improve the quantum yield ΦRU. From the asymmetry of the Pareto front (note the different axis of the plot) it can be seen, that the first ET step has to proceed nearly optimal to assure an efficient charge separation cascade. Only activation energies ΔG12* < 40 meV are tolerated for ΦRU > 90%. In the secondary ET step a value of ΔG23* ≅ 120 meV is tolerated. The sensitivity in the first charge separation step has been demonstrated by Williams et al.48 who could show, that the quantum yield ΦRU decreases with increasing polarity of amino acids in the vicinity of the initial electron donor. A qualitative understanding of this behaviour results from the curvature of the Marcus parabolas. The first nearly iso-energetic ET step (ΔG12 = −20 to −50 meV, Fig. 5, green line) requires a small reorganization energy λ12 for an optimal ET reaction. Small λ12 lead to a large curvature of the corresponding Marcus parabola. The resulting ET rate quickly decreases with growing reorganization energies (log(kij) ∼ 1/λij). We can deduce that the initial ET reaction has to be subtly balanced with regard to both quantities, namely the change in the free energy ΔG12 and in the reorganization energy λ12.
 Fig. 6  3D-Pareto front for activated ET reactions: The objectives are quantum yield ΦRU, and activation energies ΔG12* and ΔG23*. 
In the activated ET scenario at room temperature tolerated differences |ΔGij + λij| are 40 meV for i = 1 and j = 2, and 86 meV for i = 2 and j = 3 to achieve values of ΦRU > 90%. The tolerated values for λ12 and λ23 are 90 meV and 225 meV, respectively. It has been shown previously that the overall quantum yield ΦRU is stable with respect to the tertiary ET step for lifetimes in the range of 50–500 ps49 and experimentally for driving forces ΔG34 in the range of −450 to −700 meV.23
The tolerable range of values identified for ΔGij* and λij has consequences for the design of PU with respect to the necessary local dielectric of the chromophores. In artificial and natural systems based on aqueous surroundings a final local dielectric of εfinal = 40–80 has to be reached. However, the first charge separation step has to proceed at low dielectric values of ε1 ≈ ε2 ≈ 2.5 to minimize the reorganization energy λ12 (see above). Thus a gradient in the local dielectric constant in the second ET step is needed to approach εfinal. A possible solution, ε1 = 2.50, ε2 = 4.00 and ε3 = 19.98, reaches a quantum yield ΦRU up to 94%. A comparable progression has been reported in natural RC.33 Thus the micro-surrounding of the ET carriers in an optimized photo-system has to be adjusted by polar/non-polar groups of the surrounding amino-acids.
Efficiency limit of photochemical energy converting units (PU)
An optimized RU, which satisfies the conditions for ΦRU > 90% is a prerequisite for artificial energy converting units, which operate at highest energy efficiency. To deduce the detailed balance limit of artificial photochemical energy conversion we extend the rate equation system to include the ESS unit (eqn (9) and (11)). We performed multi-objective optimizations with the three objectives energy efficiency η (eqn (14)), normalized power Pnorm (eqn (16)) and normalized current Inorm (eqn (12)). The loss channel via thermal population of intermediate radical pair states (see eqn (9)) is taken into account on a μs- to s-timescale. The excitation energy hνg is optimized during the optimization and the influence of different antenna sizes are tested by the use of different gain-factors Θ (eqn (8)). For the screening of the gain-factors Θ we assume the incident photon flux of the global AM1.5 spectrum. At an approximate gap energy hνg = 1.3 eV this corresponds to an approximate photon flux PPhoton = 3.01 × 1021 m−2 s−1. The reported molar extinction coefficient of the initial electron donor in bacterial RC is in the range of 26400–142600 M−1 cm−1.50,51 This corresponds to cross-sections σRU in the order of 1.01–5.45 × 10−21 m2, yielding a rate ΓEx,RU = 3–16 s−1. In our calculations we assume an excitation rate of the RU ΓEx,RU = PPhotonσRU = 10 s−1. The gain-factor Θ is tested in the range of 1–104. The results for the three objectives, obtained from the multi objective optimization are depicted in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. The energy efficiency η (Fig. 7) forms a Pareto front for every gain factor Θ and is depicted as a function of the excitation energy hνg.
 Fig. 7  NSGAII results: detailed balance limit of photochemical energy conversion. The energy efficiencies η form Pareto fronts up to their maximum value (hνg > |1.4 eV|) and are depicted as a function of the excitation energy hνg. Beyond the maxima (hνg < |1.4 eV|) selected η values are calculated for defined hνg values. In the detailed balance limit a complete photochemical unit (PU) with different gain factors Θ (Θ = 1—green stars, Θ = 102—red squares, Θ = 104—blue filled squares) can reach an efficiency up to η = 21.7–26.8%. The reactive unit alone (RU limit, magenta circles) reaches an efficiency of η = 33.5%. The ultimate efficiency u(hνg/kBTs) (black line) and the efficiency limit of semiconductors (p–n, cyan line) are calculated according to ref. 1. For excitation energies hνg > |2.5 eV| the decrease in the efficiency η reflects the reduced number of available photons at hνg. For details see text. 
 Fig. 8  NSGAII results: normalized output power Pnorm as a function of the usable voltage U (top). Current–voltage (I–U) characteristic of the photochemical unit (PU, bottom). 
The efficiency limit of the charge separation unit (RU) alone is 33.5% at an optimal excitation energy hνg = 1.45 eV (855 nm) (Fig. 7, magenta line). For antenna systems with a gain factor Θ = 102 a maximum energy efficiency η = 24.4% is possible (Fig. 7, red curve), the optimal excitation energy hνg of the primary electron donor 0 is 1.55 eV (800 nm). This efficiency of a PU is comparable to an hypothetical, ideal single junction based photodiode with 100% quantum efficiency for photon-to-charge conversion in the detailed balance limit (Fig. 7, cyan line, ηpn,max = 31.8%).1 The maximal published energy efficiency of silicon based solar cells is 25%.2 If no amplification by an antenna system is possible the optimal excitation energy hνg is found to be shifted 0.1 eV towards higher energies (Fig. 7, Θ = 1, green curve, hνg,max = 1.65 eV) and the PU still can realize an efficiency η = 21.7%. The decrease is caused by the increase in the dissipated potential Uloss required to compete with thermal recombination losses. In the regime of small excitation rates (low illumination and/or small antenna size) the carriers remain for longer times within the ESS and are subject for this long period to thermal recombination via the RU. This recombination must be compensated by the increase in Uloss. The results for low generation rates Γgen demonstrate the importance of antenna systems in photochemical energy conversion: the increase in the effective excitation rate ΓEx of the RU via large values of Θ, improves the efficiency of the energy-converting unit. For large antenna systems with high amplification on the order of Θ = 104 (Fig. 7, blue line) the energy efficiency can reach η = 26.8%. Still higher amplification factors Θ lead to a saturation of the generation rate Γgen (see. eqn (7) and (11)), and thus to a decrease in the efficiency η.
From the results depicted in Fig. 7 we can define the optimal gap energies for the corresponding values of Θ. This determines the required electronic structure of the initial electron donor and has consequences on the electrical parameters of the complete energy conversion unit. For the fixed gap energies we present in Fig. 8 the calculated values of the normalized output power Pnorm and the photon to current conversion efficiency Inorm as a function of the usable voltage U. Fig. 8, top allows to determine the optimal operating point of a complete PU.
The normalized output power Pnorm (eqn (16)) is depicted in Fig. 8, top as a function of the available potential U for the tested Θ values. The operating points are Pmax = 67.2% (Θ = 104) at a potential U = 1.08 V, Pmax = 61.9% (Θ = 102) at a voltage U = 1.05 V and Pmax = 57.4% (Θ = 1) at U = 1.01 V, respectively. The current–voltage (I–U) characteristic of the PU is calculated for the optimal gap energies hνg = 1.65–1.45 eV (751–855 nm, see above) of the PU and depicted in Fig. 8, bottom. Under steady-state conditions the PU supplies a normalized current Inorm = 92–95%. Under high amplification conditions (Fig. 8, blue symbols) saturation according to eqn (7) starts and leads to a weak reduction of the current Inorm, visible for small voltages U. The open-circuit voltage Uoc is with 1.07–1.19 V significantly higher than in silicon based photovoltaic (bias-limit = 0.9 V).1
The tested scenarios for the antenna gain factor Θ constitute two limiting cases with different dominant loss channels. In the case of high amplification, charge recombination within the RU unit is the only dominant loss channel and has to be suppressed by an optimized RU (see section fast charge separation). Here, the potential U can be approximated by U = hνg − ΔGRU, but the current conversion saturates (Inorm = 92%). Without amplification by the antenna the current conversion is improved (Inorm = 95%), as optimal Φ is required for an efficient PU. However, the efficient suppression of the thermal population of intermediate radical pair states (see eqn (9) and 11) requires an additional potential gradient Uloss = 260 meV, which decreases the total efficiency η of the PU.
At this point a comparison between the main loss channels in semiconductor based systems and photochemical reaction centers is of interest. The detailed balance limit of semiconductors was derived for the ideal situation, i.e. a perfectly absorbing cell with 100% photon-to-charge conversion efficiency.1 The reasonable estimation of unavoidable losses (namely an operation at ≅ 90% photon-to-charge conversion efficiency) decreases the efficiency to 26–27%. The incorporation of radiative recombination processes further reduces the efficiency, very close to the best observed efficiency of 25%.2 This indicates that the theoretical efficiency limit of single junction solar cells is already approached and that charge recombination only constitutes a minor loss channel as spatial separation of mobile charges in the inversion layer occurs in the μm range.
In (artificial) PU charge separation occurs on a molecular scale i.e. within a few nanometers and charge recombination between intermediate radical-pair states becomes unavoidable. They have to be minimized by fast charge separation, which is realized by appropriately tuned redox potentials and tunnelling distances. On the other hand charge separation on the nanometer scale improves the capabilities of light absorption by the use of specially designed chromophores and antenna systems with high cross sections, an ansatz also present in dye-sensitized solar cells. Especially for the case of low solar illumination large antenna systems are of imminent importance. Our quantitative calculations on the detailed balance limit of artificial PU take into account the loss channels of charge recombination and thermal repopulation and reveal strategies to suppress them. The terminating rate  has to be in the ns-μs range, a problem solved in bacterial RC by fast re-reduction of the initial electron donor by cytochromes.44 In artificial systems, re-reduction by an organic hole conductor (OMeTAD in the Graetzel cell)37 has been reported to occur within 40 ns, in agreement with the assumptions of the model calculations.
Conclusion
Artificial PUs have the possibility for direct storage of converted solar energy in energy rich compounds. The approach of photochemical energy conversion with optimized reaction centers can supply comparable energy conversion efficiencies as obtained by photovoltaic. The calculations are an outline for future artificial photosynthetic systems and inspiration for directed improvement of existing experimental approaches.17–20 We derived the theoretical efficiency limits of photochemical energy conversion under steady state conditions by a combination of evolutionary optimization and ET theory. The realistic model reproduces the ET lifetimes and quantum efficiency of bacterial RC with high precision and is the basis to reveal design strategies for artificial charge separating units. The calculations suggest, that special attention should be directed to the design of the initial ET steps where a low dielectric environment can assure a low reorganization energy λij and thus the efficiency of the PU. For an optimized charge separation process we demonstrate the influence of an antenna system on the energy conversion efficiency η. The optimized PU allows a theoretical upper limit of the energy conversion efficiency η in the range of 21.7–26.8%.
