The excellent low-light performance of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and low-bandgap CuIn(S,Se)2 cells and the high efficiency of novel NIR-transparent inverted perovskite cells with C60/bis-C60/ITO as electron transport layers, enabled stabilized two- and four-terminal tandem efficiencies up to 18.5% and 18.8%, respectively, which represent a new record for tandem devices with solution-processed chalcopyrite and perovskite absorbers.
Tandem solar cells present an exciting means for increasing the efficiency of solar modules, thereby reducing their balance of system cost (BOS) and potentially the cost per watt peak ($ per Wp) of a module. A conventional tandem solar cell is fabricated such that a p–n junction that employs a large bandgap absorber is above a p–n junction that employs a small bandgap absorber in order to improve the utilization of the solar spectrum and reduce the thermalization losses of photons.1,2 Under one sun irradiation, the theoretical maximum efficiency can be increased from 30% up to 42% from a single to a double junction.3 Highest efficiency tandem solar cells are typically based on III–V semiconductors and double junction devices have achieved up to 31.1% efficiency under one sun.4 However, the high material cost and expensive epitaxial layer growth of III–V semiconductors limit tandem devices to special markets such as concentrator photovoltaics or extra-terrestrial applications.
Tandem solar cells composed of Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS), CuIn(S,Se)2 (CIS) and hybrid-perovskite (HP) thin film solar cells could dramatically reduce the cost and approach electricity prices as low as those from coal and natural gas.5–8 Both technologies have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 20% with bandgaps that are just short of the theoretical maximum at 1.4 eV, i.e. 1.62 eV for HP and 1.15 eV for CIGS.9,10 The combination of both absorber types in a tandem device, however, could turn this shortcoming into an advantage. Simulations predict optimum bandgaps of 1.6–1.9 eV for top cells and 0.9–1.2 eV for bottom cells, which are accessible for HP and CIGS cells by changing the Br/(Br + I) and Ga/(Ga + In) and S/(S + Se) ratios, respectively.3,11,12 A further advantage of both technologies is the possibility of solution processing which provides the potential for a highly reduced manufacturing cost. The thin film nature of both cells allows for monolithic integration and a wide choice of rigid or flexible substrates which could further reduce the cost by enabling the possibility for high-throughput roll-to-roll processing.13–15
Tandem solar cells can be fabricated by either mechanically stacking cells or fabricating top cells directly on the bottom cell (see Fig. 1). Mechanically stacked devices (used in this study) are typically easier to fabricate in the laboratory as they allow independent processing of top and bottom cells and both parallel (four-terminal) or series connections (two-terminal) between the cells. In contrast, monolithically grown tandem cells are inherently connected in series and always require current matching between the top and the bottom cell. Process parameters and treatments of all consecutive layers need to be appropriately selected to be consistent with all previously deposited layers. These drawbacks, however, are offset by the cost savings in manufacturing (i.e. monolithic integration and omission of an additional substrate and electrode) and improved performance from reduced optical and resistive losses, making monolithic two-terminal tandem devices the economically advantageous choice.8,16,17
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of a mechanically stacked and (b) a monolithic tandem device. The large bandgap, semi-transparent perovskite top cell is placed (a) or deposited (b) on top of a low-bandgap Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 or CuIn(S,Se)2 bottom cell. The mechanically stacked architecture (used in this study) allows for operation in either a four-terminal or two-terminal (i.e. current-matched) configuration while the monolithic architecture is two-terminal only. The energy-level diagram of the perovskite top cell is depicted in Fig. S1.† 
Hybrid perovskites are ideally suited as top cells in tandem devices as they exhibit low sub-bandgap absorption and can be deposited at low temperatures, which is indispensable to avoid degradation of the CIGS bottom cell during processing.18–20 Device efficiencies up to 15.9% have been reported for HP devices with all employed processing temperatures below 150 °C.21 All layer solution-processed HP solar cells using temperatures below 120 °C resulted in up to 11.5% PCE.15 Theoretical bandgaps of perovskites range from 1.57–2.29 eV for MAPbX3 (X = Cl−, Br−, and I−) and 1.48–2.23 eV for FAPbX3 absorber compounds, with larger bandgaps and an improved morphology for increased Br and Cl content, respectively. While the perovskite bandgap is tunable over a wide range, highest device efficiencies have been obtained for bandgaps between 1.5 and 1.6 eV,10,22–25 which is an excellent fit with 1.0 eV bandgap CuInSe2 bottom cells in current-matched monolithic tandem devices.1,3,11,12,26 Furthermore, recent studies suggest that improved material properties and device stability could limit perovskites to intermediate bandgap compositions around 1.6 eV with low bromide content or tri-cation compositions with Cs, formamidinium (FA), and methylammonium (MA),10,27,28 which further amplifies the need for combination with low bandgap bottom cells. An additional requirement of HP cells in the tandem configuration is the replacement of opaque layers like metal contacts with transparent layers to allow NIR light transmission to the bottom cell. Promising results have already been obtained with MoO3/ITO, nanoparticles/ITO, MoO3/Al:ZnO, Ag nanowires, or thin metal layers.16,17,29–32
Several tandem devices with HP top cells and Si bottom cells have been reported to date with PCEs up to 25.2% for four-terminal and 21.2% for monolithic devices.32–34 But while these efficiencies are very exciting, the use of silicon for the bottom cell imposes restrictions due to silicon's relatively high bandgap of 1.14 eV, limitation to rigid substrates due to the use of monocrystalline Si wafers, and high fabrication cost of the latter. Recently, solution-processed HP/HP tandems have been reported with notable efficiencies up to 20.3% and 17.0% for four-terminal and two-terminal tandems, respectively.35 However, the large bandgap of the Sn-based bottom cell absorber of 1.2 eV might limit further improvements for current-matched devices. Tandem solar cells with HP top cells and co-evaporated CIGS bottom cells have achieved up to 20.5% for four-terminal devices.29,36 Using solution-deposited CIGS absorbers from hydrazine inks, Yang et al. and Todorov et al. presented four-terminal tandem devices up to 15.5% efficiency and two-terminal devices up to 15.9% for mechanically stacked and 10.9% efficiency for monolithic tandem devices, respectively.37,38 While these values are noteworthy, tandem devices were limited by low transmission or high resistance of the employed electrodes or reduced efficiencies of the small bandgap bottom cells.
Here, we present new record efficiencies for bandgap-matched tandem devices with solution-processed perovskite and chalcogenide absorbers. The bottom cells are low-bandgap CIGS (1.0 to 1.2 eV) formed from molecular inks with the non-toxic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).39 The top cells are optically NIR-transparent solution-processed lead halide-based perovskite cells with bandgaps from 1.5–1.7 eV.40 We show device results for mechanically-stacked two- and four-terminal configurations with stabilized AM 1.5 power conversion efficiencies of up to 18.5% and 18.8%, respectively. For the two-terminal case, we find that the optimal current matching is obtained for devices with 1.5–1.6 eV and 1.0 eV bandgaps. Furthermore, we present exceptional low-light performance from the solution-processed chalcogenide cells with a stable or increasing fill factor and efficiency at a reduced light intensity and with UV- and visible-filtered light (NIR only). The low-light performance of the bottom cell, the novel semi-transparent architecture of the top cell, and the improved conversion efficiencies of the combined tandem devices, highlight the potential of solution-processed perovskite and chalcogenide tandem cells.
In order to fabricate efficient tandem devices, a number of topics such as the high transparency of the top cell, current matching in two-terminal devices, and adequate processing parameters of top layers during monolithic fabrication have to be considered. An additional area, that is often overlooked, is the low light performance of the bottom cells. As light is passed through the top cell, both the total irradiance as well as the UV and visible portion of the AM 1.5G spectrum is reduced for the bottom cell. Typically, this has a negative influence on the performance due to the logarithmic dependence of Voc with irradiance and the increasing influence of the shunt resistance at low light intensities.41 The performance of Si and CIGS solar cells at 10% irradiance has been reported to decrease by 10% and 20%, respectively.41,42 This is a significant problem, considering that typical semi-transparent perovskite top cells allow a total transmission of around 30–50% of the solar spectrum to the bottom cell (see Fig. S2†).
To investigate the low light performance of our solution-processed Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and CuIn(S,Se)2 cells, we measured their J(V) characteristics under AM 1.5G light with various applied filters. Neutral density filters were varied from optical density (OD) 0, 0.1, 0.5, to 1 while a selection of consecutive long-pass (LP) filters was applied to achieve effective cut-off wavelengths at 440 nm, 530 nm, 650 nm, and 810 nm (see Fig. S3†). The corresponding transmission values of the respective filters were estimated from the short-circuit current of a Si diode. The results are summarized in Fig. 2. As expected, the Voc of both CIGS and CIS follows a linear trend with the optical density of the neutral density filters, being the negative decadic logarithm of the transmission. The current density decreases exponentially with optical density and linearly with transmission. The FF of CIGS cells exhibits a slight increase at OD 0.1 but then an overall decrease from 69% to 65% with lower transmission, which is in agreement with previous reports.42 In contrast, CIS cells (Fig. 2c and d) show a steady increase in the FF from 59% to 65% from OD 0 to OD 1. A closer look at the resistances (see Table S1†) shows that this behavior is due to a four to three-fold increase in the series resistance that is overcompensated, in the case of CIS, by a doubling and sextupling shunt resistance for CIGS and CIS, respectively. Overall, this leads to a slightly decreasing efficiency of CIGS (14.2% to 13.0%) and an increasing efficiency of CIS solar cells with reduced irradiance (11.4% to 13.6%). The behavior, however, is vastly different for spectrally filtered light (see Fig. 2b and d and S4†). Similar to the OD filters, Voc and Jsc decreases with decreasing transmission. But while the FF for CIGS is fairly stable at 68%, it drops sharply to less than half of its value from 58% to 27% for CIS cells. The lowest fill factor is seen at a cut-off wavelength of 530 nm, which is just slightly below the bandgap of CdS, i.e. 2.4 eV. For cut-off wavelengths above this value, the FF increases again following the trend from reduced irradiance with OD filters. The efficiency follows this change and drops from 11.4% down to 4.3% at a 530 nm cut-off wavelength.
 Fig. 2  Low-light performance of CIGS (a and b) and CIS devices with low S (c and d) and high S contents (e and f). The lack of the UV- and visible portion of the light leads to a pronounced FF loss in the case of the Ga-free samples with a low S content. Neutral density filters of OD 0.1, 0.5, and 1 (left column) and long pass filters of 440 nm, 530 nm, 650 nm, and 810 nm (right column) were employed to reduce the irradiance (see ESI† for the transmission data of filters). The OD 0 and cut-off at 300 nm correspond to unfiltered light. The transmission values of the used filters and the respective cell performance was estimated from the current of a Si diode. 
This drop in fill-factor may be explained by considering: (1) the barrier height of photo-generated electrons in the absorber layer to crossover into the buffer layer, commonly referred to as a positive conduction band offset or “spike,”43,44 and (2) the kinetic energy that the photo-generated electrons have as a result of acceleration from the built-in electric field in the absorber. Any increase in the height of the barrier or decrease in the electron kinetic energy due to a decrease in band bending may cause a serious loss in the fill factor. The barrier height in the conduction band going from a Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 material to CdS is the largest for gallium- and sulfur-free CuInSe2 due to its lower conduction band. This makes the transmission rate of the photo-generated electrons over the barrier especially sensitive to the band bending. It is also well known that due to the trapping and de-trapping dynamics from defects in CdS, high-energy photons (2.4 eV and higher) shift the Fermi-level in CdS higher and thus increase the band bending in the absorber layer.44,45 Under normal full-spectrum illumination this upward shift in the Fermi-level in the CdS (and increased band bending in the absorber) is typically enough to allow photo-generated electrons to cross the barrier. However, since the high energy portion of the light up to 800 nm – for a FAPbI3 perovskite – will be absorbed by the top cell, this is problematic for some CIS cells in tandem devices. However, not all of our CIS cells exhibited this sort of behavior. We noticed that certain CIS cells showed no significant changes in the FF under UV and visible filtered light (see Fig. 2e and f and Table S2†) and in fact displayed improved efficiencies from 13% to 16% when the high energy portion up to 810 nm was filtered out. The PCE of the champion CIS cell, that we also used for the remaining part of this paper and that even exceeded the PCEs of our CIGS cells under the lowest filtered light conditions, exhibited a slightly altered composition with a higher sulfur to selenium ratio (i.e. 0.06 instead of 0.01, see Table S3†) and the corresponding peak shifts in X-ray diffraction towards higher diffraction angles (see Fig. S5†). It showed a 30% lower series and 5% higher shunt resistance while the diode ideality factor was reduced from 2.5 to 1.85, as compared to the “low S” cell in Fig. 2c and d. This suggests that the improved performance of the champion CIS device is due to a reduction of the barrier in the conduction band by an increase in sulfur. In contrast to CIGS absorbers, where the sulfur addition mainly affects the valence band, small amounts of sulfur are reported to lift the conduction band in Ga-free CIS absorbers, thereby reducing the spike towards the buffer.46 This is consistent with the observed reduction in the diode ideality factor which suggests a transition from dominant recombination in the space-charge region (potentially tunneling enhanced) where the electron and hole populations are nearly equal, to an increasing contribution from recombination in the quasi-neutral region where electron and hole populations are vastly different and typically result in lower overall recombination.47
While we only report on mechanically stacked tandem cells in this paper, we designed the device architecture in such a way that it allows for the implementation in monolithic devices. Perovskite cells are typically fabricated in the p–i–n heterojunction configuration with the perovskite being sandwiched between a p-type hole transport layer (HTL) and n-type electron transport layer (ETL).The processing temperatures of the charge transporting layers and device integration determine the use of either a conventional architecture (substrate/cathode/ETL/HP/HTL/anode) or inverted structure (substrate/anode/HTL/HP/ETL/cathode).48 Highest efficiency devices to date, of up to 21.1% PCE, have been obtained in the conventional configuration with TiO2 as the ETL and PTAA or spiro-OMeTAD as the HTL.10,22,25,49 However, this electrode polarity is not suited for monolithic processing on typical chalcogenide cells in the substrate configuration with a metal anode and a TCO cathode (see Fig. 1). Moreover, TiO2 blocking or mesoporous layers typically require high temperature calcination steps between 450 and 550 °C for 30–60 min,22,29,49 which is incompatible with CIGS solar cells. Devices with an inverted architecture employing mostly C60 as the ETL have yielded up to 15.4% PCE.50 The bis-C60 surfactant is thereby used to ensure benign band alignment between C60 and the metal cathode.51 In a tandem device, however, the substitution of metal layers by transparent electrodes is required to allow light transmission to the bottom cell. Promising results have already been obtained with Ag nanowires or thin metal layers, but high transmission and conductivities cannot be typically obtained at the same time.16,29 Noteworthy results with ITO top electrodes were reported by Bush et al. and McMeekin et al. with stabilized PCEs up to 12.3% and 12.5% when ITO was sputtered on a nanoparticle buffer layer to reduce the sputter impact.31,32 ITO is a highly attractive and commonly used material due to its very high conductivity, high transparency, and appropriate work function.48,52 In this study, we deposited an ITO cathode directly on a bis-C60/C60 double layer. The bis-C60 surfactant layer was added between ITO and C60 to aid the band alignment (see Fig. S1†), while the problem of sputter damage was mitigated by employing a “soft” sputter process at a low power of 150 W and pressures under 3 mTorr of Ar. ITO is also less sensitive to degradation in moisture and was seen to prolong the lifetime of our HP devices. Copper-doped NiOx was used as the HTL in our device structure in combination with ITO to fabricate NIR-transparent devices (see Fig. 3a). Compared to PEDOT:PSS, Cu:NiOx has advantages of having a lower valence band maximum and higher air stability and can be deposited at low temperatures around 150 °C using the reported combustion method.53,54

Excellent current matching is obtained for Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and MAPbI2.4Br0.6 as well as for CuIn(S,Se)2 and MAPbI3, and CuIn(S,Se)2 and FAPbI3, respectively. 
To investigate the optimum utilization of the solar spectrum in a two junction tandem device, we fabricated semi-transparent perovskite devices with three different bandgaps of 1.51 eV, 1.59 eV, and 1.70 eV to combine them with our chalcogenide cells of bandgaps 0.99 eV and 1.15 eV (Fig. 3b and S6†). From the original MAPbI3 structure the bandgap was widened to 1.70 eV by the partial substitution of I− with Br− while the bandgap was decreased by replacing the organic cation MA with FA.40 The devices were fabricated by applying the ITO cathodes through a shadow mask with a 10 mm2 aperture area while mirror samples with similar transmission (see Fig. S2†) with unmasked ITO were used for the tandem experiments. To project the performance of both two- and four-terminal tandem devices we measured the J(V) characteristics of CIS and CIGS cells with various perovskite filters between the AM 1.5G light source and the chalcogenide device. The J(V) curves of all perovskite cells and the corresponding filtered chalcogenide devices are shown in Fig. 3c and d for the CIGS and CIS cells, respectively. As expected, the current densities of the filtered devices follow the increase in bandgaps from FAPbI3, to MAPbI3, to MAPbI2.4Br0.6. In agreement with theoretical predictions,3,11,12 excellent current matching between the perovskite cell and the filtered chalcogenide is observed for the combinations of CIGS with MAPbI2.4Br0.6, i.e. 1.15 eV and 1.70 eV, CIS with FAPbI3, i.e. 0.99 eV and 1.51 eV, and CIS with MAPbI3, i.e. 0.99 eV and 1.59 eV. The external quantum efficiency measurements (EQE) and calculated Jsc values from EQE of the perovskite and shaded chalcogenide cells confirm this finding (Fig. 3e and f).
The semi-transparent perovskite devices without an antireflection coating exhibited PCEs of up to 9.03%, 12.5%, and 11.3% for FAPbI3, MAPbI3, and MAPbI2.4Br0.6 with current densities of 17.2 mA cm−2, 15.8 mA cm−2, and 13.7 mA cm−2, respectively (see Table 1), that agree well with the calculated values from EQE (Fig. 3e and f and S7†). The perovskite cells exhibited stable performance under illumination, and in fact improved their efficiency to 9.03%, 13.6%, and 11.8% after holding the devices at the maximum power point for 600 s, which is amongst the highest PCEs for stabilized semi-transparent perovskite devices in an inverted architecture or with sputtered ITO electrodes.31,32,35,38 The used chalcogenide cells exhibited PCEs of 14.3% for CIGS and 13.0% for low-bandgap CIS absorbers, which is the highest reported PCE for a solution-processed solar cell with a bandgap of 1.0 eV.39 When we measured the performance of our chalcogenide devices with the above-described perovskite filters, reducing the irradiance and the UV- and visible portion of the light, the current density and efficiency (uncorrected for reduced irradiance) dropped roughly to a third due to the 31–37% total transmission of the perovskite filters. As expected from our previous experiments with ND and LP filters, the Voc decreased logarithmically with irradiance while the FF declined just marginally for these cells. By adding the efficiencies of the perovskite and filtered chalcogenide cells, four-terminal tandem efficiencies of up to 17.8% and 17.6% (18.8% and 18.7% with stabilized perovskites) were calculated for MAPbI3 top and CIGS and CIS bottom cells, respectively. To our knowledge, these values represent the highest reported four-terminal tandem efficiencies with solution-processed chalcogenide and perovskite absorbers, i.e. 10.8% by Lee et al. and 15.5% by Yang et al.,37,55 and even some reports with vacuum-deposited chalcogenide bottom cells, i.e. 18.6% efficiency by Bailie et al.29 While the record four-terminal device simply follows the champion efficiencies of the individual top and shaded bottom cells, the projection of two-terminal efficiency is a bit more complex.56,57 The current density of the two-terminal tandem device is limited by the minimum current of the individual cells. However, the maximum power in a two-terminal device is not necessarily at the maximum current since the FF increases with increasing current mismatch.57 Additionally, low shunt resistances of the individual cells can lead to leakage currents and further limit the current density. Considering all of the above, we projected the two-terminal performances of all chalcogenide and perovskite combinations and found the highest efficiency of 17.8% for the combination of the MAPbI3 cell and the low bandgap CIS device (Table 1 and Fig. S8†). It is noteworthy that for this combination, the projected two-terminal performance is even higher than for the four-terminal device, which highlights the effect of the FF improvements with the current mismatch. The projected two-terminal efficiency of stabilized cells exhibits a record value of 18.5% (see Table 1 and Fig. S9†), which is the highest reported value for a solution-processed two-terminal tandem device, exceeding those of HP/HP tandem devices of 17.0%,35 HP/polymer tandem devices of up to 16%,58 and HP/chalcogenide tandems up to 15.9%.38 The excellent current matching of our solution-processed low-bandgap CIS cell with our highly efficient, NIR-transparent MAPbI3 perovskite cells is accountable for this high two-terminal performance that exceeds even some recent reports of two-terminal devices with 1.1 eV bandgap silicon or 1.2 eV bandgap perovskite bottom cells.35,59
Table 1 Measured conversion efficiencies of perovskites, CI(G)S, and filtered CI(G)S cells. Both mechanically-stacked four- and two-terminal conversion efficiencies are calculated (see Fig. S8 and S9). The best bandgap matching is observed for a combination of the 1.0 eV and 1.6 eV bandgap cells to yield a projected two-terminal power conversion efficiency of 17.8% (18.5% stabilized). Four-terminal efficiencies up to 17.8% (18.8% stabilized) are obtained by a combination of 1.2 eV and 1.6 eV bandgap devices

Conclusions
Measurements of both CIS and CIGS solar cells at reduced irradiance and UV- and visible filtered light elucidate their suitability as bottom cells in tandem devices. We found excellent low-light performance for both absorber types with bandgaps of 1.15 eV and 0.99 eV. For Ga-free absorbers, however, elevated S/Se ratios around 0.06 were seen to be necessary to avoid the FF and performance losses that can be as high as 50%. NIR-transparent perovskite devices with up to 13.6% stabilized efficiency (without an antireflection coating) were fabricated with C60/bis-C60/ITO as the ETL in the inverted architecture using layers that can be deposited below 150 °C, allowing their use in monolithic tandem processing. Perovskite cells with bandgaps of 1.51 eV, 1.59 eV, and 1.70 eV were combined with chalcogenide bottom cells of 0.99 eV and 1.15 eV bandgaps in both mechanically-stacked four- and two-terminal tandem configurations. Stabilized four-terminal efficiencies up to 18.8% were obtained by combining CIGS and MAPbI3 cells in a tandem, which exhibits the highest PCE for a tandem device with solution-processed chalcogenide and perovskite absorbers exceeding even some reports with vacuum-processed CIGS bottom cells.29 For stabilized, two-terminal tandem devices we project up to 18.5% efficiency by combining a MAPbI3 top and CIS bottom cell for excellent bandgap matching. This presents the highest PCE for a two-terminal tandem with solution-processed absorbers and even some reports with Si or perovskite bottom cells, highlighting the excellent suitability of low bandgap CuIn(S,Se)2 absorbers for tandems with perovskites. Further performance improvements are expected by reducing reflection, absorption, and resistive losses in our tandem devices. The application of anti-reflection coatings on each side of the perovskite device can reduce the high reflection losses (see Fig. S2†) and is expected to increase the performance by more than 10%. Simulations can support the determination of optimal thicknesses of absorbers and TCOs for optimal current matching and carrier transport while the fabrication of monolithic devices will ultimately remove the losses in glass and the additional ITO layer. These encouraging tandem device results of solution-processed perovskite and chalcogenide absorbers and the thin film nature of both PV technologies might pave the road for future high-throughput, roll-to-roll printed, high efficiency monolithic tandem devices that could ultimately lead to ultra-low cost solar modules and dramatically reduce the cost of clean and sustainable electricity from the sun.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Schematic of a mechanically stacked and (b) a monolithic tandem device. The large bandgap, semi-transparent perovskite top cell is placed (a) or deposited (b) on top of a low-bandgap Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 or CuIn(S,Se)2 bottom cell. The mechanically stacked architecture (used in this study) allows for operation in either a four-terminal or two-terminal (i.e. current-matched) configuration while the monolithic architecture is two-terminal only. The energy-level diagram of the perovskite top cell is depicted in Fig. S1.†	 

 	Fig. 2  Low-light performance of CIGS (a and b) and CIS devices with low S (c and d) and high S contents (e and f). The lack of the UV- and visible portion of the light leads to a pronounced FF loss in the case of the Ga-free samples with a low S content. Neutral density filters of OD 0.1, 0.5, and 1 (left column) and long pass filters of 440 nm, 530 nm, 650 nm, and 810 nm (right column) were employed to reduce the irradiance (see ESI† for the transmission data of filters). The OD 0 and cut-off at 300 nm correspond to unfiltered light. The transmission values of the used filters and the respective cell performance was estimated from the current of a Si diode.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) Photograph of a semi-transparent perovskite solar cell. (b) Transmission and squared absorbance of perovskite filters used in Table 1. The bandgaps are extracted to 1.51 eV, 1.59 eV, and 1.70 eV for FAPbI3, MAPbI3, and MAPbI2.4Br0.6, respectively. (c and d) J(V) measurements of perovskite cells, CI(G)S devices, and CI(G)S devices with perovskite filters. (e and f) External quantum efficiency data of perovskites and shaded chalcogenide cells that yielded the highest two-terminal tandem PCEs in this paper (projected PCE). Excellent current matching is obtained for Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 and MAPbI2.4Br0.6 as well as for CuIn(S,Se)2 and MAPbI3, and CuIn(S,Se)2 and FAPbI3, respectively.
