    , Accepted 30th September 2021First published on 19th October 2021AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) have emerged as a promising semiconductor for the fabrication of efficient optoelectronic devices such as photodetectors (PDs). Among all the perovskite compositions, the mixed-halide MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 formulations have gained more attention for photodetection application thanks to their tunable optoelectronic properties and great stability. However, there is still a lack of sufficient understanding of the effect of Br doping on the stability and physical properties of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 based PDs. In this work, we prepare a series of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 (x = 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16) single crystals (SCs) and investigate the influence of the Br content on the crystal structure, charge transport, ion migration, and recombination phenomena. Moreover, self-powered PDs with a structure of Pt/MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SC/Pt have been developed, and their optoelectrical properties at different wavelengths of light sources (blue, green, red, and white) have been studied. We found that all the PDs exhibit the highest photoresponse under white light indicating their potential for broad spectrum detection applications. Particularly, the MAPb(Br0.16I0.84)3 SC PD exhibits the highest responsivity of 2.41 mA W−1 at white light intensity, while the highest detectivity of 15.41 × 1010 Jones was observed for the MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC PD due to the smaller amount of trap states and suppressed ion migration, as proved by impedance spectroscopy. Finally, the photostability and one-year shelf-life stability of the corresponding PDs are demonstrated.
1. Introduction
Over the last decade, organic–inorganic halide perovskites (OIHPs) have seen a surge in research attention with the aim to study their fundamental photophysical properties and practical application in miscellaneous optoelectronic devices.1 Significant achievements have been made in the thin-film photovoltaics (PVs) field, in which perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been demonstrated to have exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 25%.2–4 Beyond solar cells, OIHPs have also emerged as promising candidates for light emitting diodes (LEDs),5,6 field effect transistors (FETs),7 Li-ion batteries,8 X-ray imaging scintillators,9 photodetectors (PDs)10–12 and many other applications.13,14 This is due to their intriguing optoelectronic properties including tunable optical band gaps, low trap densities, reduced charge carrier recombination rates, and long charge carrier diffusion lengths and lifetimes.15,16 So far, most of the high efficiency OIHP-based optoelectronic devices are based on polycrystalline thin films, which suffer from severe instabilities arising from morphological defects concentrated at grain boundaries and surface degradation under ambient conditions.17–19 In turn, OIHPs in the form of single crystals (SCs) showed much better stability due to their higher carrier mobility (>100 cm2 V−1 s−1) and lower trap state density (∼1010 cm−3) compared with the polycrystalline thin films.20–22 Recently, large size and high-quality perovskite SCs have been employed for photodetection studies showing huge promise for the next-generation of optical communication, sensing, and imaging applications.23 It was demonstrated that self-powered PDs based on prototypical methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) SC show the advantages of high-responsivity and fast response speed at low driving voltage.24–26 Lian et al. fabricated a planar-type PD based on the MAPbI3 SC exhibiting higher responsivity and broader spectrum response than the devices based on the MAPbI3 polycrystalline film.27 In another work, Xie et al. improved the sensitivity of perovskite PDs using perovskite/organic-semiconductor vertical heterojunctions.28 However, further improvement in the photodetection performance is hindered due to the low long-term operational stability of MAPbI3 under ambient conditions and under continuous illumination.29,30 Moreover, MAPbI3-based optoelectronic devices have poor resistance against thermal cycling due to a reversible tetragonal to cubic phase transition at 56 °C.31,32 This crystal phase transition causes degradation.33,34 Another critical issue is ion migration in the MAPbI3 SC induced by electrical field, which may affect the stability of perovskite and generate high dark current, leading to more noise and low detectivity.35,36 These obstacles can be systematically controlled by compositional engineering of MAPbI3 single crystals upon A-site and/or halide doping.37–40
Recently, the mixed-halide SCs of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 have attracted more attention for photodetection studies due to its tunable optoelectronic properties and improved stability. For example, Zhang et al. reported on the use of SCs of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 to fabricate PDs exhibiting highly sensitive response to visible irradiation.41 The highest Ilight/Idark ratio was obtained for the PD containing high bromine content i.e. MAPb(Br0.78I0.22)3 under 460 nm light illumination. Doping of MAPbI3 SCs with bromine not only enhances the photoresponse properties at all of the wavelengths but also improves the device stability.42,43 However, the relationship between the perovskite crystal structure (tetragonal and cubic) and the charge transport properties (trap density and ion migration) is not still clear. Therefore, more efforts are required to further understand the photophysical properties of these crystals and explore their stability after Br doping.
In this work, we study the effect of Br doping on the crystal structure, charge transport, ion migration, and recombination phenomena of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs. MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs in forms of tetragonal and cubic phases were achieved by controlling the Br contents during the synthesis step. The effects of Br doping on the activation energy and ion migration were investigated using temperature-dependent impedance spectroscopy (IS) under dark conditions. We found that the SCs with an optimum amount of Br (x = 0.12) exhibit the highest activation energy for ion migration and improved long term stability. The dark I–V curve analysis reveals that the cubic phase of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs shows low trap density, excellent carrier transport properties, and high carrier mobility, indicating their potential for the fabrication of efficient self-powered PDs. The photocurrent and response of the resulting PDs increase by increasing the Br content in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs. Particularly, SC-based PDs with a high responsivity of 2.41 × 10−3 A W−1 and a detectivity of 15.41 × 1010 Jones at white light intensity (0.5 mW cm−2) have been achieved by tuning the Br content in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3. Finally, we monitor the photostability and one-year shelf-life stability of the corresponding PDs.
2. Results and discussion
Synthesis, characterization and stability of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs
In this study, MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs (where x = 0, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, and 0.16) were synthesized using the inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method (for more details see the Experimental section).44 In contrast to work of Zhang et al.,41 we have focused on a low Br doping percentage to find the minimum I/Br alloying structure exhibiting a cubic phase at room temperature. As the MAPbI3 perovskite with cubic phase shows a higher activation energy for ion migration,45,46 we expect that the cubic phase of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 demonstrates lower trap density, and ion migration suppression and resolves the concerns related to device degradation arising from phase transition. Moreover, doping with a low Br percentage should allow the formation of PDs with responsivity values in the broadband spectrum range of 350–800 nm.
The images of the SCs prepared via this method are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The relative ratio of the halide contents was determined by the energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis (Fig. S2, ESI†). To confirm the presence of Br on the surface and bulk of the SCs, elemental EDX mapping for the SC surface and crushed powder were performed (Fig. S3, ESI†). We examined several crystals for each composition and these results confirmed that the actual Br/I ratio inside the SCs matches with the nominal ratio in the solutions (Table S1, ESI†). X-Ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the freshly ground crystals are shown in Fig. 1a. All the perovskite compositions exhibit well-defined single-phase XRD peaks. Two closely peaks located at the 28.13°, 28.4° and an iconic peak at 23.46° are related to the (004), (220), and (211) facets, respectively, which confirms a tetragonal phase (I4/mcm) of MAPbI3.38 By increasing the concentration of Br (up to x = 0.12) in the perovskite structure, the gradual shift of XRD peak at around 40° towards higher diffraction angle is observed as shown in Fig. 1b. These results indicate the successful incorporation of Br ions into the MAPbI3 SC. The fractional substitution of the large I (2.2 Å) with the smaller Br ions (1.96 Å) improved the stability by increasing the tolerance factor of the crystals.37 For the case of SCs with x ≥ 0.12, there is not any iconic peak at located at 23.46° (corresponding to the (211) facet), and two close peaks for the (004) and (220) facets are merged into a single peak (Fig. S4a, ESI†). This indicates the phase transition from the tetragonal to the cubic (pmm) phase.38 However, for x = 0.16, the XRD peaks shift towards lower diffraction angle, suggesting the increase of the lattice constant in MAPb(Br0.16I0.84)3 SCs. The lattice constants of the tetragonal phase decrease with increasing Br content and a proper cubic phase is formed when x = 0.12. Further increase in Br content leads to an increase in the lattice constant of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs, which may promote the ion migration and consequently reduced the stability of SCs. The stability was investigated over time by monitoring changes in the XRD patterns. Fig. S4b (ESI†) shows the XRD patterns of the aged (365 days) grounded crystals stored in a dry box. The intensity drop of the XRD peak (Fig. S5, ESI†) and broadening of the full width at half maxima (FWHM) in the aged SCs (Fig. S6, ESI†) indicate a possible degradation of the crystal quality. We observed that the XRD pattern of MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC shows a relatively lower intensity reduction and less peak broadening over time among all investigated SCs, indicating its better stability (Fig. 1c).

The trap states and energy levels located within the bandgap of semiconducting materials play a critical role of an undesirable obstacle in all photophysical applications.47 To probe the energy states and defects in the investigated SCs, UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements were performed. Substitution of I with Br anions is expected to increase the bandgap of the MAPbI3.34,48 We also observed that both the absorption edges and steady-state PL peaks of the investigated SCs are shifted towards blue region by increasing the Br content. Fig. 2a shows the UV-vis spectra and Tauc plots of the MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs. The corresponding bandgaps increase from 1.52 eV to 1.61 eV for x = 0 and x = 0.16, respectively. The change in bandgap is attributed to the Pb–I bond stress change, which is caused by the structural distortion after Br incorporation.49 We also investigate the effect of Br doping on the charge separation and recombination dynamics in SCs. The blue shift of PL peak with increasing Br fraction is due to the increase in the bandgap (Fig. 2b). The PL intensity increases with Br doping up to x ≤ 12% and drops for x = 16% but it is still higher than the PL intensity of the MAPbI3 SC. These results indicate that the radiative and non-radiative recombination rates of the SCs are affected by Br doping.50,51 In fact, by increasing the Br content, the non-radiative recombination decreases and thus the crystal quality increases. These defects are the least for SCs with x = 0.12 and dramatically increase for x > 0.12. Furthermore, we monitored the evaluation of PL spectra of the resulted SCs at 0, 30, 60, 100, 200, 300, and 365 days after synthesis. The crystals were stored in a dry box to avoid the effect of moisture. The relative PL intensity for all the SCs is reduced as a function of time (Fig. 2c). These results may be related to the direct exciton recombination, trap states, and disorder inside the SCs. All the SCs show minor Stokes shifts of ∼25 nm over time, implying that the PL emission of MAPbI3 and MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs is associated with the direct exciton recombination.52 However, the non-radiative recombination rate increases with time for all the SCs. In the case of x = 0.12, the lowest PL intensity reduction was observed (Fig. 2c). Therefore, the non-radiative recombination rate of the aged MAPbI3 SCs is controlled by Br incorporation, and MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SCs shows the maximum obstacle to the evolution of non-radiative recombination channels over time.

Impedance spectroscopy of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs
Ion migration plays a vital role in the stability of the OIHP devices.53–56 To analyse the effect Br substitution in MAPbI3 SCs on the evolution of ion migration, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements as a function of temperature (303–363 K) in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz and under dark were performed. Here, a thin layer of silver was deposited on both sides of SCs. The dark Nyquist spectra collected at different temperatures for MAPbI3 and MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs are shown in Fig. 3a–e. We also measured the Nyquist plots as a function of decreasing temperature cycles to check the thermal stability of the resulted SCs (Fig. S7, ESI†). We observed that the rate of change in the real part of the impedance as a function of temperature is suppressed by increasing the Br content in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs. This result signifies that the thermal stability of the MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs is improved with increasing Br concentration. The semicircles of all Nyquist plots decrease upon increasing temperature due to the increase in conductivity. Similarly to our recent studies,36,40 the obtained Nyquist plot of the MAPbI3 SC exhibits a single semicircle. However, a second semicircle is growing at a lower frequency domain of the Nyquist plot by increasing the Br content. This is commonly reported as an excess capacitance increment.57 The origin and physical significance of this phenomenon is not well-understood and further investigation is required here. The attempts to escape frequencies (f0) lie in the range from 101 to 103 Hz for MAPbI3 and from 102 to 104 Hz for MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs in a temperature range of 30–90 °C. The corresponding time constants of all the SCs are in the range of few milliseconds, which is comparable with the low-frequency response of PSCs.40 The high values of time constants suggest that the Nyquist responses can be associated with ions inside the SCs.58 The activation energy was calculated from the apparent time constants for all the SCs as a function of increasing and decreasing temperature (Fig. 3f). These calculations should shed more light on the effect of Br incorporation in the MAPbI3 on the ion migration. The activation energies of 0.34 ± 0.007 and 0.51 ± 0.008 eV are calculated for the MAPbI3 SCs at the temperature ranges of 30–55 °C and 55–90 °C, respectively, which is consistent with our previous results.36,40 The activation energies at 30–55 °C and 55–90 °C temperature ranges are associated with the ion migration inside the tetragonal and cubic structure of the MAPbI3, respectively. A clear tetragonal to cubic phase transition of the MAPbI3 was noticed in the 50–55 °C temperature range. The radius of halide ions of OIHP can strongly influence the interaction between the central organic moiety and the inorganic metal halide octahedral units. The change of phase transition temperatures and ionic activation energies are related to interaction between central MA+ ions and inorganic cage.59 The activation energy corresponding to ion migration increases with increasing Br content (Table 1). On the other hand, the temperature for the tetragonal–cubic phase transition decreases by increasing the Br content, and the MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC achieved a stable cubic phase at room temperature, which has the most crucial benefits in terms of phase stability. For the case of x ≥ 0.12, the activation energy associated with the cubic phase is only calculated as the tetragonal to cubic phase transition is positioned below the room temperature. Thus, the influence of phase transition on the stability of MAPbI3 under thermal-cycling conditions is removed by Br incorporation.

To further confirm the reliability of activation energies derived from EIS measurements, the temperature-dependent dark conductivity of all SCs was measured (Fig. S8, ESI†). The activation energies are derived using the well-established Nernst–Einstein expression for a mixed conductor,  where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, and σ0 is a constant.40 The calculated activation energies for all the SCs are summarized in Table S2 (ESI†). The obtained activation energies are comparable to those of obtained by EIS measurements.
In the crystal structure of OIHPs, the iodide vacancies play a dominant role in the non-radiative recombination and charge tapping due to their deep energy levels.60,61 The ion migration is controlled by the interaction of ion with the perovskite lattice. As shown in Fig. 1b, the smaller Br atom decreases the lattice constant of the MAPbI3 SCs, which restricted the ion migration and improved the stability of the MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs. The maximum activation energy is found for MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 composition, which provides the maximum obstacle to the evolution of trap states and ion migration. The ion migration also relates to the I–V hysteresis behaviour of OIHPs.62,63 The I–V hysteresis for MAPbI3 and MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs at a scan rate of 100mV s−1 are shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). As expected, the degree of I–V hysteresis decreases upon increasing Br content and is minimized for the SC with x = 0.12. These results confirm the suppressed ion migration inside the cubic structure of the MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC.
The carrier transport properties of MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs were probed by the dark I–V measurements. Hole-only devices (Pt/SCs/Pt) were fabricated using all the SC compositions. To calculate the hole trap states in the MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs, a well-established space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method was used.36,64 All the dark I–V curves exhibit different slopes at different bias and three distinct regions are clearly marked as shown in Fig. 4a. In the low applied bias, a linear part is observed (Ohmic region) that causes a sharp rise (I ∝ Vn>3) at the high applied bias. This voltage is called the kink point or trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL).36 By considering a linear dependence between trap density (ηtrap) and VTFL, the hole (ηh) densities are calculated using the given expression:  where ε, L, ε0 and e are the dielectric constant, thickness of the crystals, vacuum permittivity and elementary charge (1.6 × 10−19 C), respectively. We calculated the relative dielectric constant of all the SCs from the capacitance–frequency measurements (Fig. S10, ESI†) and summarized it in Table 3. As shown in Fig. 4b, the hole (ηh) trap density decreases by increasing the Br content, and this value is minimized for x = 0.12. The value of ηh = 6.050 × 109 for MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC is lower than that of ηh = 7.495 × 109 found for MAPbI3 SC. The reduction of trap density for Br-doped SCs most likely is attributed to the more compact lattice formation and the passivation of surface defects via Br incorporation.65

The carrier mobility (μ) for holes in the MAPbI3 and MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs were also calculated from the trap-free SCLC regions of hole-only devices using the Mott–Gurney law:  Here, Jd and V are the dark current density and applied bias, respectively. The calculated carrier mobilities and trap densities for all the SCs are summarized in Table 1. The μh increases with increasing Br content in the MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs, reaching to a maximum value for x = 0.16 (Fig. 4b). This is related to the diffusion distance. The diffusion coefficient can be represented using the Einstein equation:  where q, μ, kB, and T are the amount of charge, carrier mobility, Boltzmann constant, and absolute temperature, respectively. The diffusion distance is proportional to the diffusion coefficient.66 Therefore, diffusion distance increases upon increasing Br content in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs and reaches a maximum value for x = 0.16 in hole-only devices.
Photodetectors based on MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs
Planar-type PDs based on MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs were fabricated to investigate the effect of Br incorporation on the photoelectrical properties of the SCs. The schematic diagram of the fabricated PDs is shown in Fig. 5. In order to fabricate the device, 40 nm-thick platinum (Pt) electrodes were deposited by thermal evaporation on the (100) facets of the SCs. We studied the spectral characterization of the SC-based PDs by collecting the I–V curves by switching the bias voltage from −3 V to +3 V under a white light pulse. The results given in Fig. S11a–e (ESI†) show the reach spectrum of the optoelectronic process and changes in photogenerated charges from band–band excitons with different applied biases. The plots obtained using linear sweep voltammetry (100 mV s−1 scan rate) confirm the energy-efficient and fast optoelectronic response of PDs. The SCs formed a Schottky barrier with Pt electrodes, and at Pt/SC interface ion movements and carrier trapping occur under an applied bias. This indicates the formation of an ohmic contact at the Pt/SC interface. The current increase with increasing Br content in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs for all the PDs, reaching a maximum value for x = 0.16. This can be related to the highest diffusion distance for MAPb(Br0.16I0.84)3 hole-only devices, which helps to extract photogenerated carriers efficiently before trapping.

Fig. S12 (ESI†) demonstrates the white light intensity-dependent characterization and durability of all the SC-based PDs. The photocurrent values varied as a linear function of the light intensity from 40 mW cm−1 to 0.5 mW cm−1. The photocurrent of PDs increases upon increasing the Br content in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs. In addition, a detailed comparison of the performance and stability of our SC PDs were carried out under different illuminations and different wavelength (λ = 460 (blue), 520 (green), and 630 (red) nm and white light) light sources (Fig. S13, ESI†). All the PDs exhibit the highest photoresponse under white light. Photocurrents under pulse illumination at different wavelengths are shown in Fig. 6a–d. As expected, MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SC-based PDs show superior charge-transport properties compared to the pristine MAPbI3 SC-based PDs. The photocurrent of PDs increases by increasing the Br content in MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs and reaches to a maximum value for x = 0.16 due to the enhancement in diffusion distance and superior hole mobility. Next, we calculated the performance metrics of all PDs including external quantum efficiency (EQE), responsivity (R), and specific detectivity (D*). These results are summarized in Fig. S14 (ESI†) and Fig. 6e–l. The responsivity (R), which represents the photoresponse to the incident light, is calculated as  where, Ilight, Idark, A, and Ipower are the current under illumination, dark current, active area and incident light power, respectively.67 Specific detectivity (D*), which represents the performance of the PDs can be calculated by D* = (R·A)/(2qIdark). The energy of a photon decreases with increasing wavelength. To have the same intensity, more number of photons have to be included in the higher wavelength light beams. Therefore, the performance of the PDs increases with increasing wavelengths. R and D* of the PDs decreases gradually with increasing illumination intensity. This strongly proves the existence of considerable loss in charge carriers due to the recombination and reduction of the number of photogenerated carriers, which are available for the extraction under high light intensity in the PDs.65 The PD based on the pristine MAPbI3 SC shows the responsivity of 1.18 mA W−1 and specific detectivity of 10.75 × 1010 Jones under white light. While MAPb(Br0.16I0.84)3 SC PD shows the highest responsivity under white light, the highest detectivity is observed for MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC PDs due to the presence of a smaller amount of traps, which reduces the recombination of charge carriers. The performance matrix of several reported MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) based planar PDs are summarized in Table 2.

The response time depends on the capacity of PDs to follow the rapidly changed optical signals. Rise-time (from 10% to 90% of the saturated values) and fall-time (from 90% to 10% of the saturated values) for all PDs were extracted from the normalized photoresponse characteristics (Fig. S15, ESI†). The rise-time and fall-time of the PDs are in the millisecond range and summarized in Table 3. The switching properties of a PD define by on/off ratio and rise/fall time. Our results conclude that the MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC PD exhibits the highest switching properties. The response time of the PDs is becoming faster by increasing the amount of Br and is comparable with the values obtained in the previously reported MAPbI3 based PDs.44,78,79 The response time of PDs could be related to the defects, charge impurity states inside the band gap and the presence of trap states inside the bulk materials.24 The response time is fastest in the MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC PDs due to the presence of the lowest trap density and suppressed ion migration.

Stability of the MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SC-based photodetectors
The stability of the PDs in various environments such as ambient is an essential requirement for the commercialization perspective.27,34,80 Therefore, the long term shelf-life stability (for one year) of the fabricated PDs without encapsulation is carried out and shown in Fig. 7a. After specific intervals, we measured the photocurrent under red light (630 nm) and white light at 10 mW cm−2 (Fig. S16, ESI†). All the PDs showed a similar reduction in the photocurrent over the aging time (Fig. 7b and Fig. S17, ESI†). The MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SC-based PD has the lowest photocurrent reduction retaining 46% of its initial photocurrent, while the photocurrent of the reference PD maintains only 19% of its initial photocurrent after 365 days. In addition, we explored the intrinsic light-induced degradation for all PDs under 30 mW cm−2 continuous white light pulse for 10 days without encapsulation. The summarized self-powered photocurrent responses of all PDs after specific intervals are shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†). The normalized photocurrent of all PDs is shown in Fig. 7c. The photoresponsivity of the PDs decreases with increasing the operational time and the best operational stability was observed for MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SCs based PDs. The responsivity was reduced by only 15.4% as compared to 37.5% reduction for MAPbI3 SC-based PD after 10 days and under continuous illumination.

3. Conclusions
In summary, the effect of Br doping of the MAPbI3 SC on the crystal structure, charge transport, ion migration and recombination has been investigated. Among all the investigated mixed-halide MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs, the MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 perovskite composition not only allows the formation of a stable cubic phase at room temperature but also shows much-improved crystal quality and stability as proved by its low trap density, high activation energy and high carrier mobility. The resulting MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs were used for the fabrication of planar self-powered PDs with a structure of Pt/MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SC/Pt and tested at different wavelengths of light sources. We found that all the PDs have high photoresponses, when the devices are illuminated by the white light. The PDs based on MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SCs showed the highest detectivity of white light (15.41 × 1010 Jones) and the fastest response time (85 ms). This can be attributed to the superior quality of the MAPb(Br0.12I0.88)3 SCs. Notably, this device maintained 46% of its initial photocurrent after one-year aging without encapsulation, which is more stable than the MAPbI3 based PD, retaining only 19% of its initial photocurrent value. Moreover, the responsivity was reduced by 15.4% compared to 37.5% reduction for the pristine MAPbI3 SC-based PD after 10 days of continuous illumination under white light (30 mW cm2) in air and without encapsulation. This study provides a basic insight into the relationship between the structural and charge transport properties of mixed-halide MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs and the performance and stability of the corresponding PDs.
4. Experimental section
Preparation of SCs
MAPbI3 and MAPb(BrxI1−x)3 SCs used in this study were synthesized using the inverse temperature crystallization (ITC) method.44 1 M MAPbI3 solution was prepared by dissolving the equimolar amounts of lead(II) iodide (PbI2) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) and stirred for 24 h while stirring at 60 °C. MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 (x = 0.4, 0.8, 0.12, 0.16) solutions were prepared by adjusting the portion of lead(II) bromide (PbBr2) and PbI2 in GBL at 60 °C. Next, all the solutions were filtered using a 0.24 μm PTFE filter. 2 mL of each filtered transparent solution is sealed in bottles and kept at 110 °C for 4 h in an oil bath, which resulted in the growth of large MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 SCs. The crystals were washed with acetone 2–3 times and then dried at 100 °C for 20 min. All the crystals were stored inside a glove box.
Fabrication of self-powered photodetectors
40 nm-thick platinum (Pt) was deposited by thermal evaporation on the (100) facets of the SCs with a channel of 500 μm length by 2 mm width. We used a designed mask, which is shown in Fig. 5.
Characterization of SCs and devices
All the SCs were ground, and powder X-ray diffraction (pXRD) patterns were recorded on a – Rigaku Ultima IV with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) over a 2θ range of 10° to 50° without rotating the sample at room temperature to study the crystal structure and stability. A compact NOVA Nano-SEM unit was used to observe the energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) of the crystal surface and ground powder crystals to know the relative ratio of the bromine incorporation on the surface and inside the singe crystals. The optical properties of SCs have been studied by UV-vis spectrometer (SHIMADZU UV-200). Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of MAPbI3 and MAPb(I1−xBrx)3 SCs were characterized by a PL spectroscopy laser excited at 532 nm using WITec alpha300 R. Temperature-dependent EIS measurements and current–voltage characteristics were obtained using a potentiostat Autolab (Metrohm Autolab) equipped with a frequency response analyzer. To perform temperature-dependent EIS measurements and current–voltage characteristics, thin layers of silver (Ag) were deposited on both sides of all the examined crystals, followed by thermal annealed for 10 min in an oven at 100 °C. To avoid the scattering in the data we used a thin layer silver paste (Acheson Silver. Product no: G 3692). Generally, we use isoamyl acetate as a thinner which does not react with the crystal. To maintain the reproducibility in the results, push contacts were used. The dark current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of all hole-only devices (Pt/SCs/Pt) were performed using a potentiostat Autolab (Metrohm Autolab). The photoresponse properties of the PDs were studies using a potentiostat Autolab (Metrohm Autolab) and an LCR meter with a series LED (λ = 460 (blue), 520 (green), and 630 (red) nm and white light) lights sources. The illumination power at each wavelength was optimized with the help of a Lux meter and controlling source current by the LCR meter. All the measurements were taken at room temperature under ambient conditions (50–90% relative humidity) without encapsulation. For photostability measurements, all the SC based PDs were exposed to 30 mW cm−2 white illumination in the open air. For the time-dependent photoresponse study, we have measured the photoresponse of the PODs at specific intervals (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 200, 300, and 365 days).
