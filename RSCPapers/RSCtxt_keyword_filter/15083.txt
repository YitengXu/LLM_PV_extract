    , Accepted 13th July 2018First published on 30th July 2018AbstractLi-TFSI is the most common p-dopant for the hole conductor spiro-MeOTAD in the normal structure (n–i–p) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which consistently yield the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) albeit at the risk of lower long-term operational stability. Here we successfully replace conventional Li-TFSI with Zn-TFSI2, which not only acts as a highly effective p-dopant but also enhances considerably both the photovoltaic performance and long-term stability. The incorporation of Zn-TFSI2 as a dopant for spiro-MeOTAD leads to an increase by one order in the hole mobility compared to Li-TFSI from 3.78 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 to 3.83 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1. Furthermore, the device with Zn-TFSI2 showed an 80 mV higher built-in voltage and a bigger recombination resistance than the one with Li-TFSI, which were responsible for the striking increase in both the open-circuit voltage and fill factor, leading to a stabilized PCE of 22.0% for the best cells. Remarkably, the device employing Zn-TFSI2 demonstrated superb photo-stability, showing even a 2% increase in the PCE after 600 h light soaking at the maximum power point (mpp) under full sun, while the PCE of the device with Li-TFSI decreased by 20% under the same conditions. Similarly, the device with Zn-TFSI2 showed better operational stability at 50 °C resulting in a 21% decrease in the PCE after 100 h aging at the mpp under full sun while the Li-TFSI based one showed a 55% decrease. Moreover, the Zn-TFSI2 based device was capable of effectively resisting humidity compared to the one based on Li-TFSI from shelf stability monitoring (R.H. ≥ 40%) in the dark.

Broader context
Organo-lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) recently achieved a superb efficiency exceeding 22% and have been considered as one of the most promising photovoltaics for the next generation. Nevertheless, the stability issue of PSCs has persistently raised doubts about device feasibility in the long term. It was found that the instability of high efficiency devices based on the normal structure (n-type metal oxide/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD) was mostly attributed to the spiro-MeOTAD layer employing Li-TFSI as a dopant. The dopant is indispensable in the case of spiro-MeOTAD because of its low hole mobility. Other dopants have been tried to improve the stability but they can hardly compete against Li-TFSI, resulting in lower performance in the end. Here we introduce a powerful new p-dopant, Zn-TFSI2, which not only outperforms Li-TFSI but also achieves outstanding long term stability.

Introduction
Since the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar cell (PSC) was introduced in 2012,1,2 organic–inorganic halide PSCs have attracted considerable interest and shown rapid progress, reaching 22.7% certificated efficiency.3 They exhibit outstanding optoelectronic properties such as ambipolar charge transport,4 a long balanced carrier diffusion length,5,6 large polaron formation7,8 and exceptional defect tolerance.9 The normal structure (n–i–p), employing compact TiO2 (cp-TiO2) and mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) as an electron transport material (ETM) and 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) as a hole transport material (HTM), was the initial device architecture introduced in 20121 and still remains the most representative structure of the PSCs achieving persistently the highest record efficiency. However, the poor device stability of conventional spiro-MeOTAD formulations, mainly due to the use of bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) as a p-dopant, raised doubts about the practical feasibility of such PSCs in the long term.10–12 A dopant is inevitable for spiro-MeOTAD owing to its low hole mobility. Various dopants, Ag-TFSI,13 cobalt complexes,14 and CuI,15 were adopted to replace conventional Li-TFSI to improve the stability. Nonetheless, these alternative dopants were still unable to compete against Li-TFSI and thus were unavoidably incorporated together with Li-TFSI for high efficiency.13,15 A dicationic salt of spiro-MeOTAD, spiro(TFSI)2, was also used to replace Li-TFSI to increase the conductivity of spiro-MeOTAD, yielding a PCE of around 10%.16 Recently, molybdenum tris(dithiolene)s successfully replaced Li-TFSI yielding an efficiency of 16.7% with improved thermal stability.17 Discovery of a new dopant for spiro-MeOTAD is appealing in consideration of a chance to utilize the well-established platform technology of the normal structure.
In our search for alternative dopants we maintained TFSI as an anion considering its remarkable stability and weak tendency to associate with organic cations due to the well delocalized charge over the whole TFSI anion.18,19 The trifluoromethylsulphonyl (CF3SO2−) group in TFSI is strongly electron-withdrawing and thus able to effectively distribute the negative charge on the nitrogen atom by delocalizing it toward CF3SO2−, leading to weak basicity and lower chemical reactivity.18,19 In this study, we examined a new dopant, Zn-TFSI2, to address the stability issue caused by the very mobile lithium ions which are prone to penetrate into the perovskite and TiO2 layers interfering with device operation. We reasoned that Zn ions due to their larger size and charge are less likely to move and influence on the device performance. Surprisingly, we find that apart from improving the stability, the efficiency of the conventional device was substantially enhanced. The beneficial effect of Zn-TFIS2 on photovoltaic performance was investigated in comparison with Li-TFSI and the science behind the improved long-term stability was elucidated by decoupling the origin of the photo- and the thermal-stability at the maximum power point (mpp).
Results and discussion

Fig. 1(a) shows the molecular structure of Li-TFSI, the conventional dopant for spiro-MeOTAD, and Zn-TFSI2, a challenging dopant in this study. Li-TFSI was found to dope spiro-MeOTAD in ambient air with the aid of oxygen, leading to oxidized spiro-MeOTAD coupled with the formation of lithium-peroxide complexes.20 The concentration of Zn-TFSI2 was set to half of Li-TFSI for a rational comparison in this study. Fig. 1(b) illustrates the expected molecular interaction between oxidized spiro-MeOTAD and the TFSI anion in the matrix.21

The molecular conformation was calculated using MM2 energy-minimization with Chem3D software. Grey, red, blue, yellow and green balls represent carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and fluorine, respectively. 
The hole mobility of spiro-MeOTAD was measured to clarify the effect of the dopant using the space charge limited current (SCLC) with the solution-processed thin film (shown in Fig. S1, ESI†) and the obtained results are shown in Table 1. During the hole mobility measurements, the composition of the HTM was equal to the one for photovoltaic devices where spiro-MeOTAD contained 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP), and either Zn-TFSI2 or Li-TFSI. Pristine spiro-MeOTAD without any additive showed a hole mobility of 2.69 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, which increased to 3.78 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 by adding Li-TFSI and tBP. When Li-TFSI was replaced by Zn-TFSI2, the hole mobility of spiro-MeOTAD was enhanced by one order of magnitude to 3.83 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1.

Photoluminescence (PL) spectra of perovskite films were measured to examine the hole separation at the interface with spiro-MeOTAD. The perovskite films used in this study were composed of mixed triple cations (formamidinium, methylammonium and cesium) and double halides (iodide and bromide) to assure high quality coupled with a stable phase.22 In Fig. 2, the perovskite film shows a clear PL peak at 775 nm (gray line) reflecting radiative recombination between photo-generated electrons and holes at the respective band edge. The strong PL intensity of the perovskite was substantially diminished by attaching the spiro-MeOTAD layer, affording hole injection from the perovskite to the HTM. Larger PL quenching was observed from spiro-MeOTAD with Zn-TFSI2 compared to the one with Li-TFSI, indicating that spiro-MeOTAD doped by Zn-TFSI2 facilitated more efficient hole separation at the interface with the perovskite. The replacement of Li-TFSI by Zn-TFSI2 was found to effectively improve both the hole separation and mobility. Therefore, the incorporation of Zn-TFSI2 as a dopant for spiro-MeOTAD was highly encouraging in terms of faster hole extraction in the photovoltaic device.

PSCs were prepared to investigate the effect of Zn-TFSI2 on the overall photovoltaic performance based on the normal structure where cp-TiO2 and mp-TiO2 were incorporated as an ETM. Cross-sectional images of the devices are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†) where the thickness of spiro-MeOTAD layers was estimated to be ca. 200 nm regardless of the dopant. We employed spiro-MeOTAD containing either of the dopants Li-TFSI or Zn-TFSI2 and tBP in the absence of other co-dopants, such as cobalt complexes, to examine solely the effect of the new dopant, Zn-TFSI2. Fig. 3(a) shows current (I)–voltage (V) curves of the devices for the different dopants and the numerical values of photovoltaic parameters are given in Table 2. The device with Zn-TFSI2 demonstrated a higher PCE of 21.52% in the reverse scan (RS) and 21.11% in the forward scan (FS). This was significantly higher compared to the devices with Li-TFSI, showing 19.48% in the RS and 18.83% in the FS. An obvious increase was observed in both the open-circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF) of the device with Zn-TFSI2 while its short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC) was comparable to the one obtained with Li-TFSI. It is also notable that the replacement of Li-TFSI with Zn-TFSI2 effectively relieved I–V hysteresis. Fig. 3(b) shows an overall high incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) above 85%, irrespective of the dopant, for the whole visible wavelength range where a steep breakdown was found around 775 nm, near the bandgap of the perovskite. Statistical results for the photovoltaic parameters with respect to the dopant can be found in Fig. S3 (ESI†), showing that the average PCEs for Li-TFSI and Zn-TFSI2 were 19.0 ± 0.33% and 21.21 ± 0.28%, respectively. The devices for the statistics were prepared at the same time and derived from the same batch.

The voltage delay time (Vd) at each applied bias voltage was 100 ms during the I–V scan.

The introduction of Zn-TFSI2 as a dopant for spiro-MeOTAD showed evident enhancement in the photovoltaic performance compared to conventional Li-TFSI though the HTM composition was optimized for the Li-TFSI system (TFSI−/spiro-MeOTAD = 0.5 mol mol−1). The concentration of Zn-TFSI2 was thus varied to find the optimal composition of the HTM as shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†). The best performance was obtained from a 0.30 molar ratio of Zn-TFSI2 to spiro-MeOTAD in the presence of the cobalt complex (tris[2-((1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide)], FK209). The incorporation of FK209 was found to facilitate charge extraction and thus further enhance the photovoltaic performance.23 The corresponding I–V curves are shown in Fig. 4(a), demonstrating 23.78 mA cm−2JSC, 1.162 V VOC, 0.788 FF and 22.0% PCE in the RS under 0.989 sun intensity. The FS voltage sweep under the same sun intensity produced 23.75 mA cm−2JSC, 1.153 V VOC, 0.729 FF and 20.17% PCE. The corresponding IPCE spectrum is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). It was uncertain to extract the stabilized PCE from the initial I–V curves due to the hysteresis which was dependent on the voltage delay time at each applied voltage. It is also difficult for the I–V curve to become completely free from the accumulated charge formed at the open-circuit condition before starting the measurement. Therefore, the stabilized power was monitored at the mpp as a function of time (Fig. 4(b)), showing the resulting power output of 22 mW cm−2. In the absence of FK209, a 21.0% stabilized PCE was recorded at the mpp (Fig. S6, ESI†). The tendency between Zn-TFSI2 and Li-TFSI was similar regardless of the inclusion of FK209, showing higher VOC, FF and PCE for the case of Zn-TFSI2, but better overall performance was obtained in the presence of FK209 mainly due to an increase in FF (Fig. S7, ESI†). The effect of FK209 seemed more prominent for the Li-TFSI based one.

Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were carried out under illumination to study charge recombination behavior related to the photovoltaic properties. At a certain applied bias voltage, two distinctive arcs were observed in the Nyquist plot (as shown in Fig. S8, ESI†). To date, various equivalent circuits were adopted for adequate interpretation of the charge-transfer mechanism in the perovskite solar cell. Nevertheless, a determination of the eligible equivalent circuit is still under debate owing to unusual phenomena related to ion migration.24–26 Here we used a simplified equivalent circuit, consisting of one resistance (R) and two parallel resistance (R)–capacitance (C) components in series where the latter R–C component, assigned to a low frequency range, was used to estimate the recombination resistance (Rrec).11,27Fig. 5 shows Rrec as a function of the applied voltage (Vapp, forward bias) from the short circuit condition to near the open-circuit condition. Little difference was found in Rrec at the short-circuit condition (Vapp = 0 V), which was in accordance with comparable JSC values for Li-TFSI and Zn-TFSI2. However, the difference in Rrec became larger with increasing Vapp from 0 V to 0.6 V due to the rapid decrease in Rrec of Li-TFSI, leading to roughly one order of magnitude larger Rrec for Zn-TFSI2 at 0.6 V. As Vapp further increased, the external bias voltage (Vapp) was applied across the device in the reverse direction of the internal electric field, where the carriers were prone to recombine, resulting in low Rrec. The substantial difference of Rrec between Zn-TFSI2 and Li-TFSI was maintained up to 0.9 V and then decreased on approaching VOC. The significant difference in Rrec near the mpp (∼0.9 V) was immediately reflected in the FF of devices and thus demonstrated higher FF for Zn-TFSI2.

It was found that the devices with Zn-TFSI2 showed overall higher VOC compared to the ones with Li-TFSI (Fig. 3 and Fig. S3, ESI†). This can be related to the shift of the Fermi level of spiro-MeOTAD by adding a dopant.28 The Mott–Schottky analysis was thus considered to understand the origin of the difference in VOC. For reliable data acquisition of the depletion layer capacitance (Cdl), the measurement frequency must be carefully selected to avoid being influenced by the huge accumulation capacitance (Cs) near the selective contact.29 Therefore, the frequency (13.4 kHz) was chosen from the clear capacitive plateau of the capacitance (C)–frequency (f) curve in the intermediate frequency range, corresponding to the dielectric response. In Fig. 6(a), three distinctive capacitive features, the geometric capacitance (Cg), Cdl and Cs, are clearly shown as a function of bias voltage (Vapp), which allowed us to extract Cdl and subsequently obtain the built-in potential (Vbi) according to the following equation Cdl−2 = 2(Vbi − V)/qεε0N(1)where q, ε, ε0 and N are the elementary charge, relative dielectric constant, vacuum permittivity and defect density, respectively.29,30Vbi of the device with Zn-TFSI2 was found to be 1.28 V which was 80 mV higher than the one with Li-TFSI (Vbi = 1.20 V). In the semiconductor heterojunction, the depletion layer is generated to compensate for the potential barrier by equalizing their Fermi levels.30 Consequently, the difference in Vbi indicates that the employment of Zn-TFSI2, in place of Li-TFSI, effectively shifted the Fermi level of spiro-MeOTAD downward by reaching a high p-doping level resulting in higher VOC, as shown in the schematic diagram in Fig. 6(b). It was noted that the full depletion layer across the perovskite film was expected up to about 0.6 V where Cg approached Cdl, which could be beneficial for charge collection at low Vapp in perovskite photovoltaics.

The capacitance was measured in the dark at the intermediate frequency (13.4 kHz). (b) Schematic energy level diagram of the device based on the dopant. 
The long-term stability measurements were carried out to reveal the effect of Zn-TFSI2. During the long-term measurements, the devices were kept at the mpp under continuous one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2) in an inert atmosphere (N2) at 25 °C. Fig. 7(a) shows the normalized PCE with respect to the dopant. Importantly, the device with Zn-TFSI2 demonstrated outstanding photo-stability, showing even a 2% increase in the beginning and stable performance for 600 h. On the contrary, the PCE of the device with Li-TFSI gradually decreased by 20% over 600 h, mainly due to the FF drop (Fig. S9(c), ESI†). The stability of each photovoltaic parameter can be seen in Fig. S9 (ESI†). The thermal stability under light was also measured at 50 °C as shown in Fig. 7(b). The performance of the device with Zn-TFSI2 decreased by 21% over 100 h while the one with Li-TFSI showed 55% reduction of the PCE in the same conditions. In addition, the shelf life of devices was monitored in the dark at room temperature as shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†). The performance difference was not so obvious when the devices were stored in dry air and the dark. However, the effect of the dopant was clearly seen in a humid environment (relative humidity ≥ 40%), leading to a 58% PCE decrease for Li-TFSI and a 17% PCE decrease for Zn-TFSI2. Therefore, it was assumed that the device based on Zn-TFSI2 is resistive to photons, bias voltage, temperature and humidity.

Black and red symbols represent Li-TFSI and Zn-TFSI2, respectively. PCE values were divided by the initial value (PCEi). The black horizontal dashed line of (a) is a guide line indicating 1.0. The devices were maintained at the mpp under one sun (100 mW cm−2) and a N2 atmosphere. 
The origin of the photo- and thermal-stability with respect to the dopant was further investigated. It was apparent that the employment of Zn-TFSI2 in place of Li-TFSI completely ensured high photo-stability with outstanding efficiency, which indicated that the poor photo-stability of the conventional normal structure (FTO/TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD/Au) dominantly originates from Li-TFSI apart from the other components. During the stability measurement at the mpp, lithium cations are likely prone to migrate across the device towards the perovskite layer to screen the photogenerated charges and eventually lead to degradation. Several publications suggested the possibility of lithium ion migration in spiro-MeOTAD.31,32 In the PSC, the lithium cation migrated from spiro-MeOTAD to the perovskite layer and even reached the TiO2 layer during device operation.31 In the case of solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells, the lithium cation was also found to migrate toward the TiO2 surface and directly influenced the Fermi level of TiO2.32 On the contrary, Zn-TFSI2 definitely suppressed this effect due to nonmigration of zinc ions in the HTM layer. Light-induced lattice expansion of the perovskite was recently found to passivate the trap states of the bulk perovskite and accordingly improve the photovoltaic performance.33 The stable Zn2+ behavior during mpp tracking under full sun enabled the photo-induced beneficial effect of the bulk perovskite to be readily reflected in the device performance, leading to a 2% increase. The observed difference correlates with the difference in the Li+ and Zn2+ charge and ionic radii. The electric-field strength (E) of the zinc ion is almost twice that of the lithium ion based on the equation E = q/R2(2)where q is the ionic charge and R is the ionic radius.34 The higher E of Zn2+ would induce a strong electrostatic interaction within the spiro-MeOTAD matrix, which would hence enable the zinc ions to be well stabilized in the matrix without being significantly affected by external bias under illumination. This was further probed in the devices used for the long-term measurements (600 h under illumination at 25 °C) to clarify the role of the dopant in the photo-stability. It was found that detecting the lithium or zinc distribution is very challenging in practice due to the very low atomic (at) concentration of lithium (<ca. 0.4 at% with the exclusion of hydrogen) and zinc (<ca. 0.2 at% with the exclusion of hydrogen), with an especially low atomic sensitivity factor (ASF) of Li 1s (ASF = 0.06) in the HTM layer.35 Accordingly, the devices were also examined by cross-sectional SEM (Fig. S11(a) and (b), ESI†) after the long-term stability measurements and show little difference from the device as prepared (Fig. S2, ESI†).
On the contrary, the poor thermal stability was mostly ascribed to the fragile morphology of spiro-MeOTAD in the presence of additives. The glass transition temperature (Tg) of spiro-MeOTAD was found to be significantly decreased from 154 °C to 91 °C by adding Li-TFSI, FK209 and tBP (shown in Fig. S12, ESI†), underlying that the deteriorated stability of the amorphous state can easily induce crystallization, particularly at elevated temperature.10,36 Spiro-MeOTAD with Zn-TFSI2, FK209 and tBP showed slightly higher Tg of 99 °C (Fig. S12, ESI†), implying the relatively improved morphological stability of spiro-MeOTAD with Zn-TFSI2 as compared to Li-TFSI. The performance drop however seems inevitable irrespective of the dopant at the moment. After the thermal stability measurement, the crystallization of spiro-MeOTAD was observed by a microscope for both Li-TFSI and Zn-TFSI2 as excepted (Fig. S13, ESI†). Nevertheless, the enhancement of the thermal stability by careful cation design of the ‘–TFSI−’ dopant remains promising, even to potentially replace other additives and thus lead to a more stable morphology. Besides, a possibility of Au or iodine migration at high temperature is known to be a major reason for the poor thermal-stability.37 However, the effect of Au or iodine migration was negligible in this study,10 where the Au layers remained intact, showing a clear interface of the Au layer even after the thermal stability measurements (Fig. S11(c) and (d), ESI†). Depth profiling with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was also carried out for the device with Li-TFSI after the thermal stability measurements (Fig. S14, ESI†), which confirmed well separated Au, HTM and perovskite layers.
Conclusion
In conclusion, Zn-TFSI2 was successfully employed in spiro-MeOTAD as an efficient dopant, leading to improved hole mobility and hole separation compared to the conventional dopant, Li-TFSI. The replacement of Li-TFSI with Zn-TFSI2 effectively shifted the Fermi level of spiro-MeOTAD downward which resulted in higher VOC of the photovoltaic device. The device with Zn-TFSI2 also demonstrated an improved FF based on about one order of magnitude higher recombination resistance than the one with Li-TFSI, particularly near the mpp. Consequently, the PSCs based on spiro-MeOTAD with Zn-TFSI2 achieved an outstanding stabilized PCE of 22%. Importantly, the long-term stability of the PSC at the mpp under full sun was remarkably enhanced by incorporating Zn-TFSI2, which suggested a strong interaction between Zn-TFSI2 and spiro-MeOTAD, while the migration of lithium cations was expected from Li-TFSI. The thermal stability of the device with Zn-TFSI2 was also improved in comparison with the one with Li-TFSI, owing to a higher Tg for spiro-MeOTAD employing Zn-TFSI2. In the shelf life measurement, the device based on Zn-TFSI2 was more resistive to humidity compared to the one with Li-TFSI. This study provides a basis for stabilizing the operation of high efficiency PSCs with spiro-MeOTAD through dopant design.
Experimental
Substrate preparation
Nippon sheet glass 10 Ω sq−1 was cleaned by sonication in 2% Hellmanex (Hellma GmbH) water solution for 20 minutes and further cleaned in ethanol and acetone for 15 min, respectively. After solvent cleaning, the substrates were cleaned with UV ozone treatment for 15 min. Then, a 30 nm-thick TiO2 compact layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis with a precursor solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (75 wt% in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich) in anhydrous ethanol (≥99.5%, Fischer Scientific) at 450 °C. After the spraying, the substrates were kept at 450 °C for 30 min and cooled down to room temperature. Then, a 150–200 nm-thick mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by the spin coating method at 4000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm s−1, using TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30 NR-D) diluted in ethanol. After the spin coating, the substrates were immediately dried at 120 °C for 10 min and then sintered at 500 °C for 30 min under dry air flow.
Preparation of the perovskite precursor solution
1.5 M PbI2 (99.99%, TCI) and 1.5 M PbBr2 (99.99%, TCI) were predissolved in a mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8%, Acros) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.7%, Acros) (DMF:DMSO = 4:1 v/v) as stock solutions. 1.5 M cesium iodide (99.998%, ABCR) was also pre-dissolved in DMSO as a stock solution. To make a perovskite precursor solution based on mixed triple cations and double halides, first 1.22 M FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 with 9 mol% excess lead were prepared by mixing 1.5 M lead stock solutions with formamidinium iodide (≥98%, FAI, Dyesol) and methylammonium bromide (98%, MABr, Dyesol), respectively. Then, to make triple cation perovskite solutions, CsI, FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 solutions were mixed with a 0.3:5:1 volume ratio.
Hole transporting layer
70 mM spiro-MeOTAD (99%, Merck) solution in chlorobenzene (99.8%, Acros) was doped with bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide lithium salt (Li-TFSI, 99.95%, Sigma-Aldrich) or bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide zinc salt (Zn-TFSI2, 99.5%, Solvionic), tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)-cobalt(III) tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, ≥99.5%, Dynamo) and 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBP, 96%, Sigma-Aldrich). The molar ratio of additives for spiro-MeOTAD was 0.5, 0.03 and 3.3 for Li-TFSI, FK209 and tBP, respectively. The molar ratio of additives for spiro-MeOTAD was x (x = 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30 or 0.35), 0.03 and 3.3 for Zn-TFSI2, FK209 and tBP, respectively.
Preparation of the device
Perovskite films were deposited by the anti-solvent (chlorobenzene, 99.8%, Acros) method in a N2 atmosphere glove box with triplication perovskite precursor solutions at 4000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm s−1. The anti-solvent was dropped at 5 s before the spin-end. The wet perovskite films immediately were annealed for 50 min–1 h at 100 °C. After the films were cooled down to room temperature, spiro-MeOTAD solutions were coated on the perovskite films at 4000 rpm for 20 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm s−1. To finalize the preparation of devices, a 80 nm-thick Au electrode was further deposited on the FTO/cp-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD films.
Measurement
The current (J)–voltage (V) property of the hole-only device (FTO/spiro-MeOTAD/Au) was measured in the dark to obtain the space charge limited current (SCLC). The hole mobility was calculated according to the following equation: J = 9/8εrε0μV2L−3 where J, εr, ε0, μ, V, and L denote the current, relative dielectric constant (εr = 3 was used here), vacuum permittivity, hole mobility, applied voltage, and film thickness, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were collected from high resolution SEM (ZEISS Merlin) with an in-lens detector. A Florolog 322 (Horiba Jobin Ybon Ltd) instrument was used to record the steady-state photoluminescence (PL). The samples were mounted at 60° and the emission was detected at 90° from the incident beam path. 450 nm was used as an excitation wavelength for the perovskite. Current density (I)–voltage (V) curves and the time-dependent power conversion efficiency of the devices were measured using a 450 W xenon light source (Oriel). A Schott K113 Tempax filter (Präzisions Glas & Optik GmbH) was used to reduce the mismatch of the spectrum between AM 1.5G and the simulated illumination. For calibration of the light intensity, a Si photodiode equipped with an IR-cutoff filter (KG3, Schott) was used during each measurement. I–V characteristics of the cells were obtained by applying an external voltage bias while measuring the current response with a digital source meter (Keithley 2400) without any device preconditioning on devices. A black metal mask (0.16 cm2) was used during the measurements to avoid overestimation by scattered light. Impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements were performed using a potentiostat (BioLogic, MPG2) equipped with an LED light source. 20 mV of sinusoidal AC perturbation, ranging from 1 MHz to 10 mHz, was put on the DC bias voltage from 0 V to 1 V. A black aperture mask (0.25 cm2) was also used for the IS measurement under the light. The obtained IS data were fit by using software (ZView2) where one resistance and two resistance (R)–capacitance (C) (R–C in parallel) components in series were used as an equivalent circuit. The capacitance was measured in the dark as a function of the bias voltage (forward bias) for the Mott–Schottky plots. Frequency scans were done before the C–V measurements to find out the optimal frequency where three distinctive capacitance regions were observed. Subsequently, a sinusoidal AC voltage (20 mV) of 13.4 kHz was applied on the DC bias voltage and the resultant capacitance was recorded. Stability measurements were performed with a Biologic MPG2 potentiostat under an AM 1.5 sun-equivalent white LED lamp. The devices with a metal aperture mask (0.16 cm2) were mounted in the sample holder flushed with nitrogen. The devices were measured with maximum power point (mpp) tracking under constant illumination. The mpp was updated every 10 s by a standard perturb and the resulting I–V curves were recorded every 60 min in order to track the evolution of individual I–V parameters. Glass transition temperatures (Tg) were obtained from differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) measurements. The samples were subjected to two consecutive heating cycles from room temperature to 300 °C at a scanning rate of 10 °C min−1 under a nitrogen atmosphere using a PerkinElmer DSC8000 differential scanning calorimeter. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were used to investigate the element composition with a PHI VersaProbe II scanning XPS microprobe (Physical Instruments AG, Germany). 2 kV Ar ion sputtering was used for depth analysis and data were collected at a rate of 7 nm min−1. The microscope images (×200 magnification) were obtained with an electronic microscope (Intel Play QX3 Microscope, Intel) with software (QXScope 1.0.5.). Incident-photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured using the Ariadne system (Cicci Research) with an aperture mask (0.16 cm2) for the device.

Broader context
Organo-lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) recently achieved a superb efficiency exceeding 22% and have been considered as one of the most promising photovoltaics for the next generation. Nevertheless, the stability issue of PSCs has persistently raised doubts about device feasibility in the long term. It was found that the instability of high efficiency devices based on the normal structure (n-type metal oxide/perovskite/spiro-MeOTAD) was mostly attributed to the spiro-MeOTAD layer employing Li-TFSI as a dopant. The dopant is indispensable in the case of spiro-MeOTAD because of its low hole mobility. Other dopants have been tried to improve the stability but they can hardly compete against Li-TFSI, resulting in lower performance in the end. Here we introduce a powerful new p-dopant, Zn-TFSI2, which not only outperforms Li-TFSI but also achieves outstanding long term stability.


 	Fig. 1  (a) Molecular structure of the dopants (Li-TFSI and Zn-TFSI2). (b) Diagram of the expected molecular complex between TFSI and spiro-MeOTAD. The molecular conformation was calculated using MM2 energy-minimization with Chem3D software. Grey, red, blue, yellow and green balls represent carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, and fluorine, respectively.	 

Pristine spiro-MeOTAD	2.69 × 10−5
