The sol–gel-derived ultraporous composite nanoarchitecture, which contains 1 to 8.5 wt% Au nanoparticles and titania in the anatase form, retains the high surface area and mesoporosity of unmodified TiO2 aerogels and maintains stable dispersion of the ∼5 nm Au guests. A broad surface plasmon resonance (SPR) feature centered at ∼550 nm is present for the Au–TiO2 aerogels, but not Au-free TiO2 aerogels, and spans a wide range of the visible spectrum. Gold-derived SPR in Au–TiO2 aerogels cast as films on transparent electrodes drives photoelectrochemical oxidation of aqueous hydroxide and extends the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 from the ultraviolet region to visible wavelengths exceeding 700 nm. Films of Au–TiO2 aerogels in which Au nanoparticles are deposited on pre-formed TiO2 aerogels by a deposition–precipitation method (DP Au/TiO2) also photoelectrochemically oxidize aqueous hydroxide, but less efficiently than 3D Au–TiO2, despite having an essentially identical Au nanoparticle weight fraction and size distribution. For example, 3D Au–TiO2 containing 1 wt% Au is as active as DP Au/TiO2 with 4 wt% Au. The higher photocatalytic activity of 3D Au–TiO2 derives only in part from its ability to retain the surface area and porosity of unmodified TiO2 aerogel. The magnitude of improvement indicates that in the 3D arrangement either a more accessible photoelectrochemical reaction interphase (three-phase boundary) exists or more efficient conversion of excited surface plasmons into charge carriers occurs, thereby amplifying reactivity over DP Au/TiO2. The difference in photocatalytic efficiency between the two forms of Au–TiO2 demonstrates the importance of defining the structure of Au‖TiO2 interfaces within catalytic Au–TiO2 nanoarchitectures.IntroductionModifying nanoscale wide-bandgap semiconductors such as titania (TiO2) and zinc oxide with plasmonic nanoparticles introduces visible-light activity, expanding the applicability of these aqueous-stable oxides for solar-driven technologies.1–22 A standard motif for efficient energy flow within any physicochemical system relies on either arranging vectorial energy transfer or wiring conduits for photonic, electronic, and ionic transport. By arranging plasmonically modified wide-bandgap oxides in three dimensions (3D), what performance improvements might be attained?In this study, we demonstrate visible-light-driven oxidation of water at high-surface-area, sol–gel-derived nanostructured TiO2 aerogels that contain highly dispersed ∼5-nm gold nanoparticles. Networking the plasmonic guest synthetically into the 3D titania network of the aerogel, as in 3D Au–TiO2, enhances visible-light photocatalytic activity over that obtained by deposition–precipitation of Au nanoparticles into the preformed titania nanoarchitecture (DP Au–TiO2).Titania is one of the most highly investigated semiconductors for photocatalytic water splitting, because its conduction and valence band energies bracket the reduction and oxidation potentials of water.23 The solar-driven applications of unmodified TiO2 are greatly limited, however, because the excitation energy required to generate electron–hole pairs (∼3–3.2 eV) requires UV light—which comprises only ∼5% of solar radiation. Extending the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 further into the visible portion of the solar spectrum necessitates modification strategies to affect the photophysics of the semiconductor. Sunlight-driven photocatalytic efficiency in TiO2 can be improved by lowering the threshold energy for activation either by bandgap narrowing or photosensitization.Bandgap narrowing by bulk substitutional doping of cations or anions can red-shift the absorption edge of TiO224–28 but often at the expense of photoefficiency because doping can decrease exciton lifetimes by producing recombination centers.1,2,25–27 Sensitization with dyes or noble metal plasmonic materials or quantum dots, unlike doping, confers a visible-light response without deleteriously modifying the electronic properties of the host TiO2. Dye-sensitized TiO2 has been extensively optimized for use in electrochemical solar cells29,30 and achieves high quantum efficiencies over much of the visible spectrum, but most oxide-linked dyes are too hydrolytically vulnerable for photocatalytic processes such as water splitting. Titania sensitized with noble metal plasmonic materials such as gold and silver is more stable under typical photocatalytic conditions.1,2 Gold has critical advantages over Ag as a sensitizer: it is more stable against oxidation3,31 and the Au surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spans a larger portion of the visible spectrum while the Ag SPR extends only modestly into the visible.32–35 Consequently, Au has been the metal of choice for plasmonic sensitization of TiO2, particularly for visible-light-driven photocatalytic water splitting4–8 and photoelectrochemical hydrogen generation.8–10Aerogels are appealing materials for catalytic applications because of their inherent physical features: high specific surface areas (∼100–1000 m2 g−1) and bicontinuous, nanoscale pore–solid networks.36–42 The high surface area multiplies reactive sites36,37,43,44 while the continuous mesoporous network enables rapid flux of reactants to and products from those sites.36–38,40 The covalently bonded oxide network minimizes particle growth and provides continuous solid-state electronic and ionic transport pathways to and from reactive zones.37,38,41,42,45,46 Additionally, materials with high surface areas absorb and internally scatter light very effectively,47 improving photon harvesting.48–53 We can now combine the favorable photocatalytic properties of titania aerogels with the plasmonic resonance of incorporated Au serving as a chemically robust sensitizer and investigate the effects on photoelectrochemical water splitting.In order to fully exploit the benefits of blending Au with mesoporous TiO2, the Au nanoparticulate guests must be size-controlled, stable against aggregation, and highly dispersed within the oxide without sacrificing the surface area and free volume of the oxide host. Control of Au nanoparticle size and dispersion is critical to photocatalytic activity, because sensitization efficiency depends strongly on Au size.1,8,10 Most Au–TiO2 composites described heretofore derive from pre-formed nanocrystalline TiO2 onto which gold is deposited.1,2,4,5,8,10–14,19,54–56 Deposition of Au on TiO2 often compromises TiO2 surface area and/or pore size12,56 and nanoscopic Au is generally not stable when there is only one line of contact between the metal and the oxide nanoparticle, as is the case when the size of the supporting oxide particles greatly exceeds the size of the deposited Au particle (by tenfold or more). This “flea on the boulder” arrangement permits the metal nanoparticles to migrate on the oxide surface and aggregate.10,13,15,55 Poor control of the size, shape, and dispersion of the nanoparticulate guest when varying the weight fraction of Au in Au/TiO2 can limit photoactivity8,10,13 and several recent reports emphasize the importance of controlling these factors independently of Au weight fraction.1,8,10,13,14Previous work by Rolison and co-workers demonstrated incorporation of uniformly dispersed metallic guests of controlled size into the 3D nanoscopic oxide networks characteristic of aerogels,47,57–59 including dispersing Au nanoparticulate guests into host aerogel TiO2 networks.36 These Au–TiO2 aerogels were synthesized by adding alkanethiolate-stabilized gold nanoparticles directly to a titania sol before gelation and processing the composite gel to a guest–host aerogel, enabling preparation of Au–TiO2 composites featuring highly dispersed Au over a wide range of Au weight fractions (1–10%).36 As previously verified by transmission electron microscopy, the Au guest (at 5–6 nm) is pinned by multiple strands of the TiO2 network such that each Au particle contacts multiple, comparably sized oxide particles (at 10–12 nm). This physical arrangement imparts three critical features: (i) locks the nanosized Au in place and limits aggregation even after high-temperature treatment to induce crystallization of the amorphous oxide, (ii) generally preserves the high surface area of the host oxide,36 and (iii) retains catalytic activity even after years-long storage. We can now contrast the photocatalytic efficacy of Au + TiO2 for visible-light-driven water splitting in which Au of the same size and shape is either pinned into TiO2 aerogel networks (3D Au–TiO2) or deposited on TiO2 aerogel networks (DP Au/TiO2).MethodsSynthesis of TiO2 aerogelsTitania was prepared in aerogel form using a sol–gel procedure described by Dagan and Tomkiewicz, where an ethanolic solution of titanium(IV) isopropoxide was added to a mixture of H2O, ethanol, and a catalytic amount of nitric acid.60 The sol undergoes gelation shortly after mixing; the gels were covered with Parafilm™, aged for a day and subsequently rinsed with acetone repeatedly to remove reaction byproducts and replace the pore fluid with acetone, which is miscible with liquid CO2. The wet gels were loaded under acetone into a supercritical dryer (Polaron E3100) and rinsed several times with liquid CO2 at 10 °C before raising the temperature of the dryer to 40 °C, above the critical temperature of CO2 (Tc = 31 °C, Pc = 7.4 MPa), and then slowly venting the dryer to atmospheric pressure. The amorphous as-prepared aerogels were calcined at 425 °C (ramp at 2 °C min−1, hold for 4 h, cool at 2 °C min−1) to yield 3D interconnected networks of ∼12 nm anatase nanoparticles.36Synthesis of ligand-stabilized Au nanoparticles and Au–TiO2 guest–host composite aerogelsThe Au–TiO2 composite aerogels were synthesized in a manner described by Pietron et al.36 and follow the same procedure as described above for TiO2 aerogels, but mixed alkanethiolate-stabilized Au nanoparticles were first dissolved in the ethanol used in the TiO2 gel synthesis. The nanoparticles were prepared in a manner first described by Brust et al. where a gold salt is reduced in the presence of alkanethiol61 to form 2–3 nm Au cores protected from aggregation by alkanethiolate monolayers. To improve solubility in the ethanolic solvent used in sol–gel chemistry, we stoichiometrically exchanged one-third of the as-prepared decanethiolate monolayer with mercaptoundecanoic acid to create mixed methyl/carboxy-terminated, monolayer-stabilized Au nanoparticles. The carboxy-terminated thiols participate in the sol–gel chemistry, attaching via condensation chemistry to the hydroxyls on the surfaces of colloidal TiO2 in the about-to-gel sol.36The as-prepared Au–TiO2 aerogels are amorphous and calcined at 425 °C to crystallize titania and to combust the alkanethiolate ligands, after which the 2–3 nm Au cores coarsen to ∼5 nm.36 The final weight percentage (wt%) of gold in the Au–TiO2 aerogels was controlled by the ratio of thiolate-capped Au nanoparticles to titania precursor in the solution, which was varied to obtain Au:TiO2 ratios of 1, 4.5, and 8.5 wt% (as confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, XPS, vide infra). These materials are designated as 3D-1%, 3D-4.5%, and 3D-8.5%, respectively. While the TiO2 aerogels are white, the Au–TiO2 composite aerogels range in color from light purple to dark purple with increasing Au content.Deposition of Au nanoparticles onto anatase TiO2 aerogels (DP Au–TiO2)A slightly modified version of the deposition–precipitation (DP) method described by Zanella et al.62 was used to deposit Au nanoparticles onto anatase TiO2 aerogels. For example, to create DP Au/TiO2 aerogel with 8.5 wt% of ∼5 nm Au nanoparticles, 100 mg of the calcined TiO2 aerogel was added with stirring to a 80 °C-thermostatted solution of 4.2 × 10−4 M HAuCl4 and 0.42 M urea; the reaction was stirred for 2 h (see Table 5 in ref. 62). The product was centrifuged and washed 4–5 times with 18 M Ω cm water (Barnstead Nanopure), dried under vacuum at 100 °C for 2 h, and then calcined by heating at 2 °C min−1, and held at 300 °C for 4 h before cooling to 25 °C at 2 °C min−1 in flowing air (30 mL min−1) to yield a deep purple solid. The crystalline phase of TiO2 in the DP-modified aerogels did not change, as verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD). To vary Au weight fractions in DP Au/TiO2, only the concentration of HAuCl4 was adjusted; all other parameters were held constant.Structural and optical characterizationCrystal-phase formation of the aerogels after calcination was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (Rigaku SmartLab, operated at 40 kV and 44 mA, 2 ° min−1 scan rate). The Scherrer equation was used to determine an average diameter of the Au particles from the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Au (200) reflection at 2θ = 44.3°. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution of the respective aerogels were determined from the desorption branch of the N2 physisorption isotherm (Fig. S1†, Micromeritics ASAP2020) by fitting the data with Micromeritics DFT Plus® software, using a density functional theory model for a cylindrical geometry and Halsey curve thickness. The reflectance data from diffuse reflectance UV-Visible spectra (Perkin-Elmer 750 spectrophotometer with an integrating sphere) were converted to absorption values using the Kubelka–Munk transformation. The optical bandgap was determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the Tauc plot (square root of absorption coefficient vs. photon energy) to the energy axis; this method assumes the Kubelka–Munk function is proportional to absorption coefficient.54,63The weight loading of gold in the composite aerogels was confirmed by XPS (Thermo Scientific K-Alpha, Al-Kα X-rays; using a flood gun to prevent charging of insulating samples). High-resolution spectra were recorded in the Au4f and Ti2p energy regions and the spectra were peak fitted (Avantage software) to determine peak position; Au:Ti atomic ratio was derived from the integrated intensity of these peaks (atom percentage was converted to weight percentage). The intensity ratio of the Au 4f7/2 peak to the Ti 2p3/2 peak scaled linearly with increasing Au wt% in the samples (Fig. S2†). The XPS analysis confirmed that the Au nanoparticles were consistent with the metallic chemical state seen for gold nanoparticles,64–66 in which the Au 4f7/2 binding energy shifts positive of bulk Au; our samples exhibited a ∼84.2 eV for the Au 4f7/2 peak.Transmission electron microscopyThe 3D-8.5% and DP-8.5% aerogels were analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEOL JEM2200FS TEM operating at 200 kV). The samples were mounted on holey-carbon-coated copper grids by drop casting from acetone containing crushed aerogel powders.67 Bright-field, high-resolution (HRTEM) images allow for structural determination through lattice plane spacing, as well as specific Au nanoparticle size and shape. To develop statistics, high-angle annular dark-field images taken in scanning mode (HAADF-STEM) provide better contrast between gold particles and titania compared to bright-field imaging and were used to quantify the average Au particle diameters and aspect ratios in the samples. Gold particles are identified with an automated threshold routine (subsequently checked and edited manually for consistency) and the particle size and shape distributions are then calculated for the resultant binary images. The average diameter (Fig. S3†) and aspect ratio (Fig. S4†) were determined by analyzing over 800 particles for both 3D Au–TiO2 and DP Au/TiO2.PhotoelectrochemistryTo quantify the degree of visible-light plasmonic sensitization in 3D Au–TiO2 and DP Au–TiO2, we measured incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) for photoelectrochemical oxidation of 0.1 M NaOH (aq.) using photoanodes in which aerogel films were cast onto transparent electrodes. The aerogel was ground into a powder with a mortar and pestle and mixed with water and Triton-X surfactant to form a paste,48 which was doctor-bladed onto fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated glass (8 Ω cm, Pilkington). The aerogel-coated FTO was heated to 425 °C to remove surfactant (2 °C min−1 heating and cooling rates, with a 4 h dwell time). Although grinding the aerogels creates particulate–particulate junctions that may introduce resistance to charge diffusion on length scales greater than the size of the ground particulates (on the order of micrometers),41,42 this photoelectrochemical evaluation allows direct comparison of photoactivty between the different aerogel samples and to photoanodes in the literature prepared with titania nanoparticles.Photoelectrochemical oxidation of 0.1 M NaOH (aq.) was measured in a two-electrode cell using an aerogel photoanode as the working electrode and a Pt-coated FTO electrode as the counter electrode. Short-circuit current (Isc, 0 V applied potential) was measured using a Gamry Reference 6000 or Autolab PG12 potentiostat. The photoanode was backlit using a 500 W Xe arc lamp (Newport-Oriel) fitted with a monochromater (Baush & Lomb High Intensity Monochromater, 10 nm FWHM) to select for narrow wavelength intervals. The lamp was fitted with a UV-cutoff filter (Newport longwave pass, cut-on 400 nm) under visible-light illumination to block the second harmonic of the visible wavelength; photocurrent was recorded at selected wavelengths between 350 and 780 nm. The irradiance (Wm−2) and photon flux (mol photons cm−2 s−1) were measured at each wavelength with a spectroradiometer (Ocean Optics USB2000).The IPCE was calculated at each wavelength as the ratio of photogenerated electrons (electrons s−1) per incident photons (photons s−1), eqn (1): (1)where I is the difference between dark and illuminated current measured in amperes (A), multiplied by 6.24 × 1018 electrons s−1 A−1 and the illuminated area of the electrode is 0.5 cm2. By integrating the IPCE values from 445–780 nm for the composite aerogels and dividing by the integrated IPCE values over the same wavelength interval for the TiO2 aerogel, we can quantify the overall improvement of visible-light driven photoefficiency in the wavelength interval spanned by the Au SPR.Using the same photoelectrochemical setup, open-circuit voltage (VOC) decay was measured for the Au–TiO2 aerogel photoanodes after illuminating at 580 nm. As described in detail by Zaban et al.,68 average electron lifetimes can be estimated by the fast component of photovoltage decay under open-circuit conditions. We measured the transient relaxation of Voc from the illuminated value (580 nm) to the dark equilibrium and approximated time constants (τ) from the fast component of the Voc decay.Results and discussionStructural characterizationThe oxide nanoparticles comprising the TiO2 network in 425 °C-calcined TiO2, 3D Au–TiO2, and DP Au–TiO2 aerogels are entirely anatase in crystal phase (Fig. 1). Characteristic anatase diffraction peaks appear at 2θ = 25.5°, 38.5°, 48°, and 54.5°. A weak Au diffraction peak was observed at 2θ = 44.3° for all aerogels containing Au, except for the sample with the lowest weight loading (1 wt%), where the signal fell below the detection limit of the diffractometer at the applied angular scan rate. All of the materials have nearly identical diffraction patterns, indicating that incorporating Au nanoparticles into titania aerogels does not appear to affect TiO2 crystallinity. Application of the Scherrer equation to the XRD data yields an average Au particle diameter of 4.2–4.7 nm in all composite aerogels (Table 1).

The spacing of the (101) lattice planes in the bright-field micrographs further confirm that the TiO2 is anatase. The HAADF-STEM images reveal that the Au nanoparticles in both DP-8.5% and 3D-8.5% aerogels are highly dispersed throughout the oxide nanoarchitecture (Fig. 2C and D). The average particle diameter is 4.7 ± 1.5 nm and 4.7 ± 1.9 nm for the DP-8.5% and 3D-8.5% samples, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S3†). Fig. 2  (A and B): High-resolution, bright-field transmission electron micrographs of (A) DP-8.5% and (B) 3D-8.5% Au–TiO2 aerogels. (C and D) Dark-field, scanning transmission electron micrographs of (C) DP-8.5% and (D) 3D-8.5% Au–TiO2 aerogels. At 4.7 nm, the Au in 3D Au–TiO2 is larger than the initial ∼2–3 nm diameter of the parent thiolate-capped Au because of coarsening during calcination, as previously established.36 Each Au nanoparticle in 3D-8.5% Au–TiO2 contacts multiple anatase crystallites, preventing further coarsening of the metal nanoparticles in operando or upon storage.36,69 The Au particles in DP Au/TiO2 and 3D Au–TiO2 are similarly shaped: they are mainly spherical, but slightly oblong, with an estimated average aspect ratio of 0.80 ± 0.13 and 0.80 ± 0.11 for DP Au/TiO2 and 3D Au–TiO2, respectively (Table 1 and Fig. S4†).The N2 physisorption data (Table 1, Fig. S1†) indicate that the high surface area and mesoporosity of the host titania aerogel are preserved when thiolate-capped Au nanoparticles are the Au precursor. The surface area and pore diameter of the 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels at all Au weight fractions (∼140 m2 g−1 and ∼22 nm, Table 1) are nearly identical to that of the native, Au-free TiO2 aerogel (139 m2 g−1 and 24 nm). In contrast, deposition of Au onto pre-formed TiO2 aerogel by the DP method significantly reduces surface area and average pore size to 112 m2 g−1 and 10 nm for 4.0 wt% Au and 97 m2 g−1 and 12 nm for 8.5 wt% Au (Table 1).As aerogel porosity is not monodisperse, pore size distribution plots are better representations of the nature of porosity in these materials rather than reporting an average pore diameter. The primary difference between 3D Au–TiO2 and DP Au/TiO2 aerogels (seen in Fig. 3A) is that DP-prepared materials lose substantial free volume in pores across the entire range probed by N2 porosimetry. A secondary difference can be noted by contrasting the pore size distribution of DP-8.5% and DP-4% Au/TiO2 with that of the parent titania aerogel used to prepare these specific materials. The fraction of free volume in pores <30 nm increases relative to the parent TiO2 nanoarchitecture because pores sized larger than 40 nm are lost during DP processing (Fig. 3B). Fig. 3  Incremental pore size distribution (Harkins and Jura analysis of N2 physisorption isotherm) (A) for TiO2 and 3D Au–TiO2 and (B) comparison of pore size distribution for DP-4.0% and DP-8.5% and parent TiO2 aerogel onto which Au was deposited. An advantage of nanogluing Au guests into the titania sol as it gels is that the highly dispersed thiolate-capped gold nanoparticles in the colloidal sol are incorporated directly into the nanoscale oxide network during gelation, thereby minimizing occlusion of pores and TiO2 surface area by the Au guests.36,69 Other methods of incorporating Au nanoparticles into sol–gel-derived TiO2 generally fail to preserve the surface area and porosity of the host oxide. For example, Ismail et al. prepared mesoporous Au–TiO2 composites by hydrolyzing titanium tetraisopropoxide in polymer solutions (with the polymer as a templating agent) and hydrogen tetrachloroaurate as the gold precursor.12 At 5 wt% Au, the surface area of the resulting composite was 90.8 m2 g−1—less than half of the surface area of Au-free titania prepared by the same method. Average pore size in the Au–TiO2 composite also decreased relative to that of Au-free TiO2, indicating occlusion of the pore structure by incorporated Au.12The mesoscale structure of the Au‖TiO2 interfaces in 3D Au–TiO2 and DP Au/TiO2 aerogels appears similar in the transmission electron micrographs (Fig. 2), but the 20–30% loss in surface area and the loss of two-thirds of the free volume in DP Au–TiO2 relative to the parent titania aerogel reinforce prior observations that depositing Au nanoparticles onto pre-formed mesoporous titania, including in its aerogel form, unavoidably restructures the porous material. In contrast, the N2 physisorption data a indicate that the pore–solid structure of titania aerogel is preserved when incorporating thiolate-capped Au directly into the sol–gel synthesis, thereby supporting the assignment of the Au guest as a component of the oxide network rather than a pore filler. The mesostructural difference between 3D Au–TiO2 and DP Au–TiO2 is depicted in Scheme 1. Scheme 1 UV-Visible absorption spectraTitania aerogel has a band edge at ∼390 nm (3.18 eV; Fig. 4), corresponding to the bandgap of anatase in its bulk and nanocrystalline forms. The TiO2 band edge is unaffected in the composite Au + TiO2 aerogels, but a broad surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is now present that covers a wide range of the visible spectrum and which arises from the sphere-like ∼4.7 nm gold particles. The broadness of this feature can be attributed to the modest dispersity in the size and shape of the plasmonic nanoparticles (Fig. S3 and S4†).33–35 In the 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels, the SPR is centered at 545–548 nm (Fig. 4, Table 1) and its intensity increases with increasing Au weight loading. Also present is an interband Au absorption at 400–450 nm, at lower energy than the TiO2 band edge, but at higher energy than the SPR; this absorbance also increases with increasing Au loading over the entire range examined here, from 1–8.5 wt% Au. Fig. 4  UV-Visible absorption spectra for TiO2, 3D Au–TiO2, and DP Au/TiO2 aerogels. The SPR in DP Au/TiO2 markedly red-shifts relative to that of 3D Au–TiO2 by 20–25 nm (Fig. 4, Table 1). For gold and other plasmonic materials, SPR depends on the size of the particle, its shape, and its local dielectric environment.33–35 Because the Au nanoparticles in 8.5 wt% 3D Au–TiO2 and 8.5 wt% DP Au/TiO2 have the same average particle diameter and aspect ratio (Table 1), the difference in their SPR maxima must arise from a difference in their respective local dielectric environment. According to Mie theory, an SPR red-shift for plasmonic particles of the same size and shape arises when the effective dielectric constant of the local environment around the plasmonic particle increases.33In nanoparticle-modified composite aerogels, the metal experiences a local environment weighted by two dielectric media: that of the oxide and that of the pore fluid (air). An ∼22 nm red-shifted SPR for DP Au/TiO2 implies that relative to Au in 3D Au–TiO2, Au in DP Au/TiO2 is contacted more by TiO2 (ε ∼ 6.25) than air (ε = 1). The physical interpretation of the effective medium in DP Au/TiO2 suggest that as Au nucleates and grows during the process of deposition–precipitation, the metal fills existing mesopores in the TiO2 nanoarchitecture, as seen in Scheme 1, and thereby experiences a TiO2-rich local environment.Photoelectrochemical water splittingIncident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) values were calculated for the aerogel-film photoanodes as a function of wavelength to determine photoefficiency for water oxidation under visible-light illumination. For electrochemical water-splitting, IPCE represents the fraction of incident photons of a given wavelength that is harvested and converted to charge carriers that then participate in water-splitting half reactions at the anode and cathode. In a two-electrode cell in basic electrolyte, the half reactions for water splitting at the anode (eqn (2)) and cathode (eqn (3)) are: 2OH− → H2O + ½O2 + 2e−(2) 2e− + H2O → OH− + ½H2(3)Photocurrent values are frequently reported in the literature, but these currents are not normalized to photon flux/light intensity and therefore are only qualitative evaluations. While IPCE is a convoluted function of multiple processes such as photon absorption, injection of charge carriers, and carrier recombination, it benchmarks photoelectrochemical water-splitting performance enabling comparison across different materials systems.38,70 Using a monochromatic source allows us to elucidate the wavelength dependence of plasmonic-driven photochemistry—information that is lost if IPCE values are determined from broadband light. When comparing the IPCE action spectra (IPCE as a function of wavelength; Fig. 5) and the diffuse-reflectance spectra (Fig. 4), we can clearly see evidence of SPR-mediated photochemistry. Fig. 5  Photocurrent action spectra for (a) 3D Au–TiO2 aerogel photoanodes and (b) DP Au/TiO2 aerogel photoanodes in 0.1 M NaOH (aq.). The shape of the photocurrent action spectra for TiO2 and 3D Au–TiO2 aerogel-film photoanodes with 1, 4.5 and 8.5 wt% Au (Fig. 5A) generally matches the respective UV-Visible absorption profile (Fig. 4A). The IPCE for TiO2 aerogel sharply drops off at wavelengths longer than that corresponding to the anatase band edge, and is essentially zero at wavelengths longer than 430 nm. The lack of photocatalytic activity under sub-bandgap illumination is typical for unmodified TiO2. In contrast, the photocatalytic activity of composite aerogels containing highly dispersed Au nanoparticles extends to >700 nm, i.e., to visible wavelengths well beyond the energy cutoff of the TiO2 bandgap. Peak photoactivity occurs between 520 and 580 nm for all 3D Au–TiO2 films, which matches the maxima of their respective SPR peaks (545–548 nm). The match between the IPCE action spectra and corresponding absorption spectra for 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels indicates that its enhanced visible-light photocatalytic activity derives from excitation of the plasmonic Au particles, therefore sufficient coupling exists between the metal nanoparticle and the oxide to sensitize the TiO2.While the IPCE action spectrum elucidates the wavelength dependence of SPR-mediated photochemistry (Fig. 5), the enhancement factor quantifies the overall improvement in visible light–driven activity relative to the unmodified TiO2 aerogel (Fig. 6). We have chosen to quantify enhancement by integrating IPCE values across the visible-wavelength region for all aerogels rather than taking the ratio of singular values, such as IPCE at a given wavelength for Au + TiO2 relative to TiO2. This approach is analogous to measuring improvement in IPCE or photocurrent using broadband light, as has been done in some publications.16,17 An integrated enhancement factor which is normalized to photon flux/intensity at each wavelength corrects for possible variation of IPCE or photocurrent that may be caused by uneven spectral intensity in the light source. For the 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels we see a 55-fold improvement in visible light activity at the maximum Au weight fraction used in this study (8.5 wt% Au). Fig. 6  Comparison of photoelectrochemical activity for water splitting at Au-modified and unmodified anatase TiO2 aerogels. Enhancement factor is indicated on the plot, which is the ratio of integrated IPCE values from 445–780 nm for each sample relative to unmodified TiO2. While photoelectrochemical measurements show that excitation of the Au SPR leads to generation of charge carriers in TiO2, the mechanism of plasmonic sensitization of heterogeneous photochemistry at semiconductor interfaces is still heavily debated. Two mechanisms describing the generation of electrons in the conduction band (CB) include: (1) direct electron transfer (DET) from the plasmonic nanoparticle to the semiconductor CB;1,2,6,8,10,11,19,31,71 and (2) excitation of an electron–hole pair in the semiconductor by local electromagnetic field-enhancement (LEMF) at the plasmonic nanoparticle‖semiconductor interface—without any charge transferred from the plasmonic nanoparticle.4,5,9,72,73 While the LEMF mechanism has been attributed to radiative energy transfer, Cushing et al. recently reported that SPR-driven excitation of electron–hole pairs can occur by nonradiative transfer of resonant energy (RET) through dipole–dipole interactions in the metal and semiconductor,72 so even field-driven mechanisms may occur via multiple pathways.Both DET1,2,6,8,10,11,19,31,71 and LEMF4,5,9 mechanisms have been invoked to describe visible light–driven photochemistry at Au–TiO2. Liu et al. found that visible-driven photoactivity was proportional to the predicted magnitude of the local field enhancement and noted that electron transfer from Au to the TiO2 CB is energetically unfavorable.5 A DET pathway was assigned by Kowalska et al. because visible-light sensitization was successful only when Au and TiO2 were in direct contact rather than when the Au was electronically insulated from TiO2 by a thiol group.2 Further complicating mechanistic assignment is the effect of Au particle size. Tanaka et al. report linear power-dependent photoactivity (nominally DET-like) for Au–TiO2 composites with 7 nm Au versus nonlinear power-dependent photoactivity (nominally LEMF-like) with 13 nm Au.74 Either mechanism (direct electron transfer or field-enhancement) could plausibly explain the plasmon-enhanced photoactivity of Au–TiO2 aerogels, so further studies are needed, including ultrafast spectroscopic studies, to elucidate the photochemical mechanism(s) operational in these 3D-wired nanoarchitectures.Effect of Au weight fraction in 3D Au–TiO2The photoactivity of 3D Au–TiO2 films increases over the entire visible-light range as the loading of ∼4.7 nm Au particles increases from 1 to 4.5 to 8.5 wt% (Fig. 5A and 6). This trend is likely due to increased photon harvesting at higher Au fractions (as observed in the diffuse-reflectance absorption spectra) while mostly retaining the sensitization efficiency at individual Au‖TiO2 junctions. This finding reflects the high quality of dispersion of the Au guests throughout the volume of the composite nanoarchitecture.In contrast, other investigators report optimum visible-light photoactivity at nanostructured Au/TiO2 at Au weight fractions much lower than 8.5 wt%, with photocatalytic activity decreasing at higher weight fractions,8,10,13,18 despite increasing SPR intensity.10 This opposing photoactivity–SPR intensity trend is attributed to aggregation of Au at high loadings; although larger particles are stronger visible-light absorbers, they were less efficient sensitizers.10,13 Silva et al. noted that for TiO2-nanoparticle-supported Au, the Au particle size, morphology, and surface coverage—all of which varied with Au loading—contributed to the activity of the composite photocatalyst and that the most active materials had the smallest Au particle sizes.8 Thus, control of Au size, shape, and dispersion as well as flexibility in choice of weight loading is critical to improving and optimizing plasmonic sensitization of wide band-gap semiconductors. The 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels prepared by nanogluing ligand-stabilized metal nanoparticles into a nanoscopic titania network are exceptional at accommodating highly dispersed, size-stabilized Au guests in the oxide framework over a wide range of weight fractions while increasing photocatalytic activity as the weight percentage of Au increases.The 3D-8.5% Au–TiO2 aerogel films feature plasmonic IPCE enhancement (relative to the Au-free aerogel films) for photoelectrochemical water splitting comparable to the highest reported values for other Au–TiO2 materials,5,16 although direct comparisons are difficult to make because of the different ways in which these materials are evaluated. Liu et al. reported a photocurrent ratio of up to 66× at 633 nm (Au–TiO2:TiO2) for ∼5 nm-thick Au islands deposited on TiO2 derived from anodized Ti foil.5 We observe IPCE enhancements of over 100× at comparable wavelengths (550 nm, Fig. S5†), but enhancement cannot be meaningfully calculated at these longer wavelengths because the IPCE for TiO2 aerogel decays to zero at those wavelengths. Zhang et al. reported a 50× improvement in current density under visible light (λ ≥ 420 nm) for 20 nm Au nanocrystals deposited onto TiO2 nanotube arrays overcoated with a light-scattering layer of photonic crystals,16 while we measure an enhancement factor of 55× over the wavelength range covered by the Au SPR (445–780 nm) for 3D-8.5% (Fig. 6).The relatively larger enhancement we observe for both 3D Au–TiO2 and DP Au/TiO2 could derive from more efficient sensitization in our Au–TiO2 nanoarchitectures, but may also arise from higher visible-light performance of the Au-free TiO2 standards used in the other works,5,16 which lowers their respective photocurrent/IPCE ratios. The anodic TiO2 films used by Liu et al. contained N- and F- impurities5 while the TiO2 nanotube arrays used by Zhang et al. contained a TiO2 photonic crystal layer,16 both of which increase visible-light activity of Au-free TiO2. In contrast, our Au-free TiO2 aerogels had negligible visible-light activity.Comparison of 3D and DP preparationIn order to gauge how visible-light sensitization is affected by the method of incorporating Au nanoparticles into titania aerogels, we compared the performance of 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels to an analogous form of TiO2-aerogel-supported Au nanoparticles (DP Au/TiO2) prepared by the DP method (Fig. 5B and 6). At 8.5 wt% Au, 3D Au–TiO2 and DP Au/TiO2 exhibit very different photoelectrochemical activity, despite the fact that they both: (i) derive from essentially identical anatase TiO2 aerogels; (ii) contain Au nanoparticles of the same size and shape; and (iii) absorb visible light strongly. Although the visible-light photocatalytic activity of DP Au/TiO2 is enhanced relative to that of TiO2 (which has no activity over the majority of the visible spectrum), the IPCE for DP Au/TiO2 is lower than for 3D Au–TiO2 at all wavelengths (Fig. 5). The 3D-4.5% Au–TiO2 is likewise substantially more photoelectrochemically active than DP-4.0%. As seen in Fig. 6, 1 wt% Au in the 3D form is as active as 4 wt% Au in the DP form.The superior amplification of photocatalytic activity obtained by arranging the Au‖TiO2 junctions in the manner of 3D Au–TiO2 highlights the importance of the method of Au incorporation on the performance of the composite aerogel, although the specific reasons for the higher IPCE values for 3D Au–TiO2 relative to DP Au/TiO2 are not entirely clear. Higher visible-light photocatalytic activity at 3D Au–TiO2 could derive in part from its ability to retain the surface area and porosity of Au-free TiO2 aerogel, which is not maintained in DP Au/TiO2. Photocatalytic water-oxidation rates, as are the rates of most heterogeneous reactions, benefit from increased surface area and porosity, but surface area alone cannot account for the superior reactivity of 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels. While the 3D-8.5% aerogel has 50% greater specific surface area than analogous DP-8.5% (141 vs. 97 m2 g−1, respectively, or a ratio of ∼1.5:1), its visible-light photoelectrochemical enhancement factor is 2.4× that of its DP analog (55× and 23×, respectively).Photovoltage measurements (steady-state and as a function of time) provide preliminary mechanistic insight into the photoactivity differences we observe between SPR-stimulated 3D and DP Au‖TiO2 interfaces. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) under illumination reflects the balance between electron excess (arising from photoelectrochemical oxidation of hydroxide, eqn (2)) and electron deficit (arising from consumption of photogenerated electrons at the anode by back reactions that reduce H2O or O2). Illumination at 580 nm under open-circuit conditions produces a VOC of ∼–0.12 V at the 3D Au–TiO2 photoanode; >2× the −0.05 VOC obtained for DP Au/TiO2. The more negative VOC expressed at 3D Au–TiO2 indicates that the forward reaction (electron build-up from photocatalytic water splitting) dominates the equilibrium to a greater extent when Au is sited within the TiO2 network (3D Au–TiO2) than when the plasmonic metal fills pores in the TiO2 nanoarchitecture (DP Au/TiO2).The rise to steady-state VOC under illumination (Fig. 7A) is more rapid for 3D Au–TiO2 (3.5 s) than DP Au/TiO2 (11 s), indicating a faster rate of photooxidation of hydroxide in the 3D formulation. What these data do not reveal is whether an increased rate of water-splitting arises from more efficient plasmonic sensitization of TiO2 when Au is in the oxide network (3D Au–TiO2) or whether the kinetics of OH− oxidation are faster at the physical arrangement of Au + TiO2 interfaces in 3D Au–TiO2 than DP Au/TiO2. Fig. 7  Photovoltage (A) decay and (B) rise curves for 3D Au–TiO2and DP Au–TiO2 aerogel photoanodes in 0.1 M NaOH. The excited electron lifetime is best monitored by following photovoltage decay. As described by Zaban et al., the fast component of the photovoltage decay can be used to approximate electron lifetimes.68 The decay for both Au + TiO2 aerogel photoanodes best fits a biexponential decay (Fig. 7B); the fast component at t < 40 s yields a relaxation lifetime (τ) of 11.1 s for excited-state electrons in 3D Au–TiO2 and 16.5 s in DP Au/TiO2. The more rapid discharge of excited electrons in 3D Au–TiO2 implies a faster dark reaction with solution-phase electron traps (the back reaction to reduce O2 and the direct reduction of water) that may derive from a stronger driving force (the more negative VOC) as well as from a generally more reactive Au‖TiO2 interface. Taken as a whole—steady-state VOC and its rise and decay with time—the 3D Au‖TiO2 interface is a more reactive interface, affecting faster photooxidation and dark reduction rates than the DP-derived interface, but more efficiently sensitizing TiO2 in keeping with the more negative VOC and the higher photocurrents obtained at 3D Au–TiO2 (Fig. 5).Wiring the plasmonic sensitizer into the oxide charge-carrying network, as in 3D Au–TiO2 provides a dual benefit. Firstly, with the Au nanoparticle exposed to molecular reactant in the flow-field of the pore network, rather than primarily exposed only at Au-filled pore mouths, one amplifies the number of three-phase boundary sites critical for reactivity—oxide‖metal‖molecule36,75 —thereby creating a more optimal photoelectrochemical reaction interphase. Secondly, differences in the energy coupling of Au and TiO2 in the two forms of TiO2-supported Au—evident by the red-shift of the SPR peak of DP Au/TiO2 relative to 3D Au–TiO2—more intriguingly indicate that conversion of excited surface plasmons in Au into charge carriers in TiO2 exhibits different efficiencies in the two materials. Further studies are needed, including ultrafast spectroscopic studies to elucidate the mechanism(s) of plasmonic-mediated excitation.ConclusionsWe have extended the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 aerogel films well into the visible spectrum by incorporating plasmonic Au nanoparticles. The highest photoactivity for water splitting at Au–TiO2 films under visible-light illumination (between 520 and 580 nm) occurs at wavelengths that coincide with the peak intensity of the solar radiation spectrum. Capturing a higher percentage of photons in the solar radiation spectrum and converting those photons into charge carriers is critical to improving the utility of TiO2 for solar-driven applications. Despite the nearly identical Au weight fractions, Au size distribution, and Au shape, the 3D-8.5% and DP-8.5% Au–TiO2 aerogels have differently positioned and shaped SPR features and photoelectrochemically oxidize water (as OH−) with different quantum efficiency.The 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels, made by nanogluing thiolate-capped Au directly into the oxide network that forms upon gelation, perform better as photocatalytic water-splitting anode materials than DP Au–TiO2 aerogels, prepared by subsequent deposition of Au onto pre-formed TiO2 aerogels. This difference underscores the importance of the nanoscale structure of the photocatalytic interface. The 3D Au–TiO2 synthetic route offers great flexibility for nanoscale photocatalyst design, enabling the incorporation of Au at high weight fractions without sacrificing surface area and porosity, or aggregating the Au into particles too large for effective photosensitization, as well as the potential to tune plasmonic response as a function of the Au size in the starting thiolate-capped nanoparticle. The proven ability of incorporated Au nanoparticles to sensitize water-splitting photoelectrochemical reactions at 3D Au–TiO2 aerogels at visible wavelengths extending to >700 nm, coupled with the design flexibility available to 3D Au–TiO2 in terms of surface area, porosity, and size of the oxide support and weight fractions of incorporated Au nanoparticles make it a powerful candidate with which to start unraveling the critical parameters for designing and improving visible-light-active water-splitting photocatalysts on the nanoscale.AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by the U.S. Office of Naval Research.
