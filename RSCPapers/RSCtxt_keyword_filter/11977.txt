    , Accepted 14th January 2019First published on 15th January 2019AbstractThe grain size and quality of hybrid organic–inorganic perovskite (HOIP) films greatly affect the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, dripping an anti-solvent during the spin coating process induces rapid nucleation and reduces the grain size. Here, a facile method is developed to engineer clusters in precursor solution and obtain high-quality perovskite films with an enlarged grain size. A cluster interfacial modifier, chlorobenzene (CB), is added to precursor solution. The modifier increases the interfacial energy between the precursor cluster and the solvent. The increased interfacial energy suppresses the nucleation and gives rise to HOIP films with large grains and high crystallinity. The efficiency of PSCs based on this method is greatly improved from 17.55% to 19.5%.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organic inorganic perovskite (HOIP) semiconductors are promising candidates for various electronic and optoelectronic applications, particularly solar cells. Advancing at an unprecedented rate, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 22% in less than 10 years.1–3 The photovoltaic performance of PSCs strongly depends on the quality of the perovskite films that are usually fabricated by coating perovskite precursor solution. Polar solvents such as dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and γ-butyrolactone (GBL) are popular solvents to dissolve HOIP precursors. The evolution from precursors in the solution to the final crystalline film is a complicated crystallization process. Great effort has been devoted to improve the quality of perovskite films by controlling the crystallization process. Solvent engineering as one of the most popular methods employs DMSO to form an intermediate complex due to the coordination of DMSO molecules with the perovskite precursors. The intermediate complex retards the direct transformation from precursors to HOIPs.4 Similarly, chemicals like 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO),5 1-chloronaphthalene (CN),6 hydrochloride,7 and methylammonium thiocyanate (MASCN)8 were added into precursor solution to slow down the crystallization because these additives can form coordinative complexes with the precursors as well.
Apart from the complex conformation of the perovskite precursors in solution, the crystallization during the film deposition plays a key role in the final perovskite film quality. Dripping an anti-solvent during the spin coating of precursor solution is an efficient way to achieve smooth and pinhole-free films. The anti-solvent can induce a rapid supersaturation of precursors in solution for the nuclei formation.4,9 Because of the formation of many nuclei in a short time, the grains of the HOIP films are small. Although large grains can benefit the charge transport from the perovskite films to the electrodes, they often give rise to pinholes and thus a large leakage current. An ideal HOIP film for high-performance PSCs should have large grains while being free of pinholes.
In this work, we developed a facile perovskite cluster interfacial modification method to achieve high-quality HOIP films and highly efficient PSCs. Chlorobenzene (CB), a cluster interfacial modifier, is added into perovskite precursor solutions before the film deposition. The addition of CB into the precursor solution does not remarkably affect the supersaturation, while it increases the interfacial energy between the perovskite cluster and the solvent. Therefore, it can give rise to HOIP films with large grains and free of pinholes because the interfacial energy affects the nucleation and growth of the perovskite crystallization. By this cluster interfacial modification method, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs can be improved to 19.5%.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials and chemicals
Patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates (15 ohm □−1) were obtained from the NSG group. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was received from Dyesol Ltd. Lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999% purity), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 99.9% purity), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, 99.8% purity), chlorobenzene (CB, 99.8% purity), toluene (99.8% purity), fullerene-C60 (99.5% purity) and bathocuproine (BCP, 99.99%) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich. Poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylhenyl)amine] (PTAA) was supplied by Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corp. All materials were used without further purification.
2.2 Characterization of materials
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were acquired using a Bruker D8 Advance XRD Instrument. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements were carried out using a Zetasizer Nano ZS from Malvern with a HeNe laser (633 nm) as the light source. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were acquired with a Zeiss Supra-40 SEM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images were obtained using a Veeco NanoScope IV Multi-mode AFM operated in the tapping mode. The lifetime of excitons was measured using time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL) with a pulse laser of 438 nm in wavelength, 100 kHz in frequency and 200 fs in duration. The scattered excitation light was eliminated with a 532 nm long pass filter. The emission of the samples was collected using an avalanche photon diode (Micro photon device from PicoQuant). The PL kinetics were measured using a time-correlated single photon counting module (TCSPC PicoHarp 300 from PicoQuant) with a time window of 260 ns.
2.3 Fabrication and characterization of PSCs
The PSCs were fabricated through the following process. ITO glass substrates were cleaned by sonication successively with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropanol. The sonication time was 15 min for each cleaning step. They were dried under a N2 flow and then transferred into a glove box filled with N2 to coat the PTAA and perovskite layers. The PTAA layer was deposited by spin coating 60 μL of 2 mg ml−1 PTAA solution in toluene, followed by thermal annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. The perovskite precursor solution for control devices was prepared by dissolving an equal molar ratio of MAI and PbI2 in DMF/DMSO (4:1 vol. ratio) to form a 1 M solution. Precursor solutions with CB added were prepared by dissolving precursors into mixture solvents with different volume percentages of CB. Before the deposition of the perovskite film, the substrate was pre-wetted by spin coating DMF at a spin rate of 5000 rpm for 10 s. The precursor solutions were coated at 2000 rpm for 10 s at the first stage and then at 5000 rpm for 50 s at the second stage. 150 μL of CB was dripped at 10 s after the start of the second stage. The as-coated films were then annealed under DMSO vapour in a Petri-dish at 100 °C for 15 min. The devices were completed by thermally depositing C60 (45 nm thick), BCP (8 nm thick), and Ag (100 nm thick) in a vacuum of <1 × 10−6 Torr. Each device had an active area of 0.11 cm2. The solar cells were encapsulated with a UV-curable epoxy and glass sheets in the glove box. The solar cells were tested under ambient conditions. The current–voltage curves of the devices were recorded using a computer-programmed Keithley 2400 source/meter unit. A Newport's Oriel class A solar simulator, which was calibrated using a standard Si photodiode detector, was used to simulate the AM1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2).
3. Results and discussion
To investigate the effect of the cluster interfacial modifier on the photovoltaic performance of PSCs, solar cells were fabricated. CB of 0, 5, 10, 20 or 30 vol% was added into the solution of methylammonium iodide (MAI) and lead iodide (PbI2). It is worth mentioning that the presence of CB in the precursor solution can increase the thickness of the HOIP films. To have a thickness of around 390 nm for the HOIP films, the MAPbI3 concentration should be 1 M in DMSO and DMF without CB (control film). It is adjusted to 1, 0.95, 0.88 and 0.81 M for the solutions with 5, 10, 20, and 30 vol% CB added, respectively. All the solutions are transparent without any precipitate (Fig. S1†). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the champion devices are shown in Fig. 1. The addition of CB in the precursor solution boosts the PCE from 17.55% for the control device to 19.50% when there is 10 vol% of CB in the precursor solution. Compared with the control device, the increase in the PCE by the CB addition is attributed mainly to the increase in short-circuit current density (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc). The photovoltaic performances obtained from 15 devices for each condition are shown in Fig. S2.† In general, the CB addition can enhance the photovoltaic efficiency of the devices when CB is 20 vol% or less. The PSCs employing 10 vol% and 20 vol% CB show a comparable performance. Their average PCEs are 18.08 ± 0.79% and 18.16 ± 0.40%, respectively. However, when CB is 30%, the efficiency significantly drops mainly due to the decrease of FF to 0.76. This may be caused by the dissolution of PTTA in CB when there is too much CB in the precursor solution.

To understand the reasons for the enhanced photovoltaic performance, the surface morphology of the perovskite films on PTTA was examined by SEM. The SEM images for the films prepared from solutions of 0, 5%, and 20% CB are shown in Fig. 2, and those of 10% and 30% CB are presented in Fig. S3.† Although all the perovskite films fabricated from the precursor solutions are dense and free of pinholes, the CB addition increases the grain size. As shown in the figures of size distributions (Fig. 2(d)–(f)), the grains of the pristine perovskite film are in the range of 200–900 nm, and the mean grain size is ∼400 nm. After the addition of CB, there are more grains of 600–900 nm, and some grains are even as large as 1100 nm. The mean grain sizes are also increased, and they are 490, 540, 555, and 570 nm for 5, 10, 20, and 30 vol% CB-perovskites. The size enlargement is consistent with the AFM images of the perovskite films (Fig. S4†). A larger grain size of perovskite films usually gives rise to better photovoltaic performance due to the improvement in the crystallinity and thus the reduction of charge recombination at the grain boundaries and the extension of the charge carrier diffusion length.10,11 In addition, the perovskite films become smoother after the addition of CB. The roughnesses are 25.9, 17.9, 18.8, 17.2 and 16.1 nm for the solutions with 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 vol% CB-perovskites, respectively.

Fig. S5† shows the XRD pattern of the perovskite films. As shown in Fig. S5(a),† there is no obvious difference in the XRD patterns for different perovskites, which indicates that all the perovskites possess the same crystal structure. Fig. S5(b)† shows the characteristic peak at 14.2°, which corresponds to the crystallographic plane (1 1 0).12,13 It is well understood that the width of the peak can reflect the crystallinity.14,15 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (1 1 0) peak is 0.153, 0.140, 0.121, 0.123 and 0.160 for the 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 vol% CB-perovskites, respectively. This indicates that CB of up to 20 vol% can help improve the crystallinity of the perovskite films. The enhanced crystallinity is consistent with the enhanced grain size observed from the SEM images.
To further understand the reasons for the enhancement in the photovoltaic performance, time-resolved PL measurements were conducted to investigate the photoconversion processes of the perovskite films on glass substrates for measurements (Fig. S6†). The decay time was analyzed using a bi-exponential equation (1)where A is the decay amplitude, τ is the decay time, and B is a constant for the baseline. The lifetimes obtained by fitting the decay curves are listed in Table S1.† Both τ1 and τ2 increase for the sample prepared from the precursor solution with 20 vol% CB in comparison with the control sample. τ2 is the radiative recombination lifetime, and it is determined by the grain size or crystallinity of the films.16 A longer τ2 can give rise to a higher Jsc.17τ1 corresponds to the non-radiative recombination due to defects.18,19 The increase in τ1 is attributed to the lower defect density due to the large grain size. The increase in both τ1 and τ2 is consistent with the increase of the grain size by CB in precursor solutions.
The grain enlargement indicates that CB can affect the nucleation and growth of perovskites. It was reported that in perovskite precursor solutions there are clusters made of lead polyhalide frameworks, such as iodoplumbates PbIn(n−2)−.20,21 We studied the precursor solutions by dynamic light scattering (DLS) (Fig. 3(a)). In the absence of CB, the mean cluster size is around 600 nm. The addition of CB increases the mean cluster size. It becomes 1100 nm in the presence of 30 vol% CB. Presumably, the addition of non-polar CB increases the interfacial energy between the clusters and the solvent. The clusters aggregate to minimize their interface with the solvents. With the help of dripping an anti-solvent to induce rapid supersaturation of the precursor solutions, the clusters are deposited on the substrate. The presence of CB in the precursor solution leads to fewer clusters but with a larger size. The large cluster size is further confirmed from the XRD pattern of the as-deposited films before annealing (Fig. S5(c)†). In the presence of 10 vol% or more CB in the precursor solution, the perovskite phase can be observed, while the perovskite phase is absent for the precursor solution with 0 vol% or 5 vol% CB. It has been reported that the grain size of the film is proportional to the size of the clusters in the precursor solutions.22–24 Thus, the larger grain size of the perovskite films can be attributed to the larger clusters in the precursor solution with CB added.
 Fig. 3  Size and component of clusters in perovskite precursor solutions with different CB percentages. (a) Cluster size distributions in perovskite precursor solutions by dynamic light scattering. (b) UV-visible absorption spectra of perovskite precursor solutions. 
To understand the nature of the clusters, UV-Visible absorption spectra of the precursor solutions were investigated (Fig. 3(b)). The absorption bands at around 285 nm originate from the perovskite precursors rather than the co-solvent, even though there are sharp absorption onsets located near this range for the absorption spectra of the corresponding co-solvents (Fig. S7†). The absorption bands of the precursor solutions at 285 and 325 nm are due to PbI2 and PbI3−, respectively.25 The relative intensity of PbI3− to PbI2 increases with the increase of CB. It should be noted that we used the diluted solution with a concentration of 3 × 10−4 M to avoid the signal saturation of the equipment, which greatly reduced the order n of all the iodoplumbates PbIn(n−2)−. In the solution used for the device fabrication, high order iodoplumbates including PbI64− exist.26 Therefore, in the presence of CB in the solutions, more iodoplumbates with higher n values can be observed. Hence, CB induces the transition from low-order to high-order iodoplumbates. The presence of high order iodoplumbates caused by the addition of CB is desired as it provides the correct environment for the formation of the perovskite phase and contributes to the enhanced crystallinity and reduced defects.19
The grain size of the perovskite film is closely related to the nucleation rate. In terms of thermal dynamics, the change of Gibbs free energy ΔG for the nucleation is given by eqn (2)27 (2)where γCL is the interfacial energy between the liquid and the cluster, VM is the molar volume of the nucleus, r is the radius of the spherical cluster and S is the supersaturation ratio defined as S = C/Cs with C being the solute concentration and Cs being the solubility limit (C > Cs). The energy barrier ΔG* and critical radius r* for the nucleation are defined when d(ΔG)/dr = 0. Their expressions can be obtained as shown in eqn (3) (3)
Two factors, interfacial energy γCL and the supersaturation ratio S, determine the energy barrier to be overcome for the nucleation. Dripping an anti-solvent during the spin-coating process induces a rapid increase in the supersaturation that is the driving force for the nucleation. To understand the effect of CB in precursor solution on the supersaturation, we measured the solubility of the precursors in the solutions with different CB volume percentages (Fig. 4). There is an S-shape dependence of the precursor solubility on the CB percentage. The solubility decreases only slightly when the volume percentage of CB is less than 40 vol%, while it becomes significantly low at a large percentage of CB. The supersaturation of the precursor appears during the CB dripping. At this stage, the remaining solvent from the precursor solution should be low. Since the solubility decreases to an extremely low value of less than 0.006 M when the CB is larger than 95 vol%, the original CB percentage in the precursor solution has negligible effects on the supersaturation of the wet film during anti-solvent dripping.

The dissolution of a salt in solvent is determined by the energy required for the ion dissociation and the solvation energy of the ions. A salt can be dissolved when the solvation energy is higher than the dissociation energy. The presence of CB in the perovskite precursor solution lowers the solvation energy because the dielectric constant of CB is much less than those of DMSO and DMF.28 The interfacial energy between a cluster and solution is related to the solvation of the cluster. The decrease in the solvation energy indicates the increase in the interfacial energy between the cluster and solution.
The presence of CB can increase the interfacial energy between the cluster and solvent. This elevates the energy barrier for the nucleation and thus reduces the nucleation rate. Even though it is hard to directly measure the interfacial energy, we can roughly understand the effect of CB on the interfacial energy by the contact angle measurement (Fig. 5). DMSO can easily dissolve MAPbI3 but we can still quickly observe the contact angle that is ∼1.90° which is much smaller than that (15.10°) for CB on a MAPbI3 film. The interfacial energy between the solid and liquid phases γSL can be estimated by γSL = γSG − γLGcosθ(4)where γLG is the liquid–vapor interfacial energy (i.e. the surface tension) and γSG is the solid–vapor interfacial energy. The surface tension γLG for CB and DMSO is 33.60 and 43.54 mN m−1, respectively.29 Hence, the interfacial energy between CB and MAPbI3 is larger than that between DMSO and MAPbI3 by 11.1 mN m−1.

The nucleation process can be described using the conventional LaMer model (Fig. S8†).30Cs is the solubility limit. With the evaporation of the solvent, the solution concentration increases to a critical concentration of Cc, which provides the driving force for the nucleation to start. The value of Cc thus is dependent on the energy barrier. The precipitation of the nuclei consumes the solute in the solution and decreases the concentration to a value below Cc at which the supersaturation is not sufficient to overcome the energy barrier, and then the nucleation stops. This model defines the time window between t2 and t3 for the nucleation. As discussed above, CB in the precursor solution elevates the interfacial energy and thus the energy barrier for nucleation. As a result, a higher critical concentration C′c is required, which shortens the duration of the nucleation. Hence, the nucleation is suppressed and the duration of growth is extended for the nuclei to grow large.
Apart from the suppressed nucleation, the growth of the grain is also critical for the formation of a fully covered film. The growth of grains can be described by Ostwald ripening,31,32 where the atoms at the surface of small particles tend to escape from small particles to the surrounding solution and migrate to large particles when the solution is oversaturated. The large particles will consequently grow while small particles will shrink. The clusters on the substrate are most likely to be the nuclei that can develop as grains. Therefore, the coarsening of the grains is related to the initial size of the clusters. Larger clusters may develop at the expense of consuming small ones and lead to the evolution of large grains. Therefore, the clusters enlarged by the interfacial modifier are beneficial for the grain coarsening process and result in the obvious enhancement in the grain size of the perovskite film.
Antisolvent dripping is usually adopted for the preparation of perovskite films by solution processing. However Jiao et al. reported that antisolvent dripping is not needed when CB is added into the DMF solution of MAPbBr3.33 They found that the presence of CB in the precursor solution can give rise to MAPbBr3 films with good coverage on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) and demonstrated good perovskite light-emitting diodes by this method. It is worth pointing out that our method is fundamentally different from theirs. As shown in Fig. S9,† when the antisolvent dripping step is missed, the MAPbI3 films cannot cover the underlying PTAA layer regardless of whether CB is present or absent from the precursor solution. The presence of CB does not remarkably increase the coverage of MAPbI3 on PTAA. The different CB effects on the perovskite coverage of this work from the work by Jiao et al. can be attributed to the underlying layer.33 PTAA used in this work is more hydrophobic than PEDOT:PSS used in the work by Jiao et al. A MAPbBr3 film with good coverage on PTAA can be obtained only when antisolvent dripping is performed. However the presence of CB in the precursor solution can increase the grain size of the MAPbI3 films.
4. Conclusions
In summary, a facile method to engineer perovskite clusters in solution is developed for achieving perovskite thin films with large grains and free of pinholes. A cluster interfacial modifier, CB, is added into the perovskite precursor solutions. The enlargement in the perovskite grain size can greatly improve the PCE of PSCs from 17.55% to 19.5% when there is 10 vol% CB in the precursor solution. The improvement in the PCE arises from the increased crystallinity, enlarged grain size, and suppressed non-radiative defects. The addition of CB can increase the interfacial energy between the perovskite cluster and solvent. Thus, it increases the energy barrier for the nuclei formation and the cluster size in solution. This is confirmed by DLS and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The large cluster size leads to a large grain size of the perovskite thin films and thus an enhanced photovoltaic performance of PSCs. This work provides a novel strategy of engineering the perovskite crystallization by affecting the interfacial energy between perovskite clusters and solvent.
