    , Accepted 16th March 2018First published on 17th March 2018AbstractBoth interfacial and photoactive layers play crucial roles in efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inverted PSCs with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.23% are achieved via the conjunct effect of a titanium(IV) oxide bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TOPD) electron collection layer and a perpendicular phase separated PBDB-T:ITIC-M photoactive layer. Careful studies on the energy level and optical and morphological properties of TOPD elucidate its outstanding electron-collecting and hole-blocking function besides its highly transparent properties. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), water contact angle (WCA) measurements and time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) jointly verify the vertical phase separated PBDB-T:ITIC-M photoactive layer and further present the concentration distribution of the donor and acceptor in the blend film, which ensures effective exciton dissociation and simultaneously offers independent pathways for charge transportation. The combination of their virtues facilitates the high enhancement of open circuit voltage (Voc) up to 0.21 V besides the increased short circuit density (Jsc) of 1.9 mA cm−2, leading to an encouraging PCE enhancement from 4.59% to 10.23% exceeding the traditional BHJ-PSCs with a PCE of 9.08%. Therefore, we may conclude that TOPD is a suitable electron collection layer to synergize with the vertical composition profile of photoactive blends for high performance i-PSCs.
1. Introduction
Bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells (PSCs) are being extensively promoted as one of the solutions to low-cost energy conversion from solar light to electricity.1–3 Nevertheless, the realization of highly efficient and stable devices is still challenging for typical BHJ-PSCs with the sandwich structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ composite/Ca/Al, where ITO is the transparent indium tin oxide electrode and PEDOT:PSS is poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate).4 The first reason involves the corrosion of acidic PEDOT:PSS to ITO.5–7 The second relates to the concentration distribution of the donor and acceptor in the photoactive layer for efficient exciton dissociation and transportation.8,9 Efforts have thus far focused on designing new device architectures with a more suitable interfacial material and photoactive blend film.10
Inverted PSCs (i-PSCs) have recently evoked much interest owing to their significantly enhanced device stability compared with traditional BHJ-PSCs.11 The advantages of the reversed device polarity for i-PSCs are as follows. Firstly, the ITO electrode modified with a high band gap n-type material serves as the cathode, avoiding the etching of ITO by acidic PEDOT:PSS.12–14 Meanwhile, the air stable hole collection layer (HCL) combined with high work function (WF) metals (such as Au and Ag) are employed as the anode, making the i-PSCs demonstrate superior long term environmental stability.15–17 Moreover, the eligible concentration distribution and phase separation of the donor-accepter blend film accelerate exciton dissociation and provide smooth and independent pathways for electron and hole transportation.9 Therefore, it is expected that the i-PSCs could show higher power conversion efficiency (PCE) and better long term stability than those of conventional BHJ-PSCs.18
The synergy of the electron collection layer (ECL) and vertical phase separated photoactive layer with an appropriate concentration distribution is crucial for high efficiency i-PSCs. As for the former, a number of remarkable improvements have been made by adopting suitable n-type ECLs such as titanium oxide (TiOx),19–21 zinc oxide (ZnO),22–24 and cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3),25 but their annealing temperatures are generally beyond 200 °C to form crystallized films,26 which is not suitable for the fabrication of flexible PSCs on polymer substrates. In addition, their optical, electrical and morphological features should be further explored.27,28 Our previous investigation found that the PCE of i-PSCs with a titanium chelate (TIPD) buffer layer could reach 7.4%,29 and the solution-processed TIPD tends to be titanium(IV) oxide bis(2,4-pentanedionate) (TOPD) after a lower temperature annealing treatment.30 Definitely, the alcohol-soluble TOPD is also a kind of titanium chelate. Therefore, it is reasonable to postulate that TOPD could be employed as the ECL in i-PSCs.
As far as the photoactive layer is concerned, great efforts have been devoted to exploring the low bandgap conjugated-polymer donor and the matching fullerene derivative acceptor during the past two decades,31–33 but the PCE has been restricted by the acceptor's narrow and weak absorption in the visible range in spite of its good electron transport ability. Fullerene-free π-conjugated electron acceptors with excellent charge transport capability are currently considered the most promising materials for efficient PSCs,34 and the PCE of single junction PSCs reaches up to 13% by adopting a ternary photoactive layer.3 ITIC-M (3,9-bis((Z)-1-(6-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-5,6-dihydro-6H-cyclopenta[b]thiophen-6-one-5-yl)ethylene)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)dithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-sindaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene) stands out from numerous acceptors due to its strong absorption in the visible range.35 However, there is still a dearth of records for realizing the perpendicular phase separated photoactive layer with an optimized concentration distribution of the donor and ITIC-M acceptor.
In this work we attempt to fabricate TOPD with outstanding features, realize the vertical phase separated (poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-co-(1,3-bis(5-thiophene-2-yl)-5,7-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1,2-c:4,5-c]dithiophene-4,8-dione)]) PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend film and explore their synergistic effect on i-PSCs. The results show that an encouraging increased PCE from 4.59% to 10.23% is achieved attributed to the conjunct effects of the perpendicular phase separated photoactive layer and the TOPD layer. The former provides a sufficient interface to facilitate the carrier separation and simultaneously offers independent charge transport pathways. The latter can selectively enhance the collection rate of electrons or holes in i-PSCs. The high relative increase of PCE up to 123% supports our claim that TOPD is a promising electron collection layer to synergize with the vertical composition profile of photoactive blends for high performance i-PSCs.
2. Experimental details
2.1 Materials
Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co., Ltd (Shenzhen, China). Both MoO3 (purity > 99.0%) and 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO, purity > 98.0%) were purchased from Sigma Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). PBDB-T and ITIC-M were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc (Beijing, China). All these commercially available materials were used as received without further purification.
2.2 Device fabrication
i-PSCs with TOPD as the ECL were fabricated. i-PSCs without TOPD, traditional BHJ-PSCs with a PEDOT:PSS layer and i-PSCs with a ZnO layer were fabricated as control devices. Their architectures are ITO/TOPD/PBDB-T:ITIC-M/MoO3/Al, ITO/PBDB-T:ITIC-M/MoO3/Al, ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBDB-T:ITIC-M/Ca/Al and ITO/ZnO/PBDB-T:ITIC-M/MoO3/Al, respectively.
All ITO substrates were sequentially cleaned with a detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic cleaner. For conventional BHJ-PSCs, the precleared ITO substrates were treated under UV-ozone (UVO) exposure for 15 min to improve the surface smoothness and WF.33 The PEDOT:PSS layer with 30 nm thickness was obtained via spin-coating its aqueous solution at 2000 rpm for 45 s and then baked at 150 °C for 10 min in air. But the pre-cleaned ITO substrates were free of UVO treatment to keep the WF unchanged for all i-PSCs.36 For devices with TOPD, the TOPD buffer layer was prepared by spin-coating the isopropanol solution with different concentrations of TOPD (1000 rpm min−1, 9–13 mg mL−1) on ITO and then baked at different temperatures for 5 min. The optimized conditions of TOPD in the device are 12 mg mL−1, 90 °C for 5 min. The PBDB-T:ITIC-M (1:1 weight ratio and a polymer concentration of 10 mg mL−1) in a 20 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene:DIO (99.5:0.5 volume ratio) solution was spin-coated onto the ITO/PEDOT:PSS, bare ITO, and ITO/TOPD substrates at optimized 1900 rpm for 60 s. Subsequently, the samples were annealed at 100 °C for 10 min to obtain a film thickness of ≈100 nm.37 Lastly, either Ca(10 nm)/Al(100 nm) or MoO3(24 nm)/Al(100 nm) was thermally evaporated in a vacuum on the photosensitive layer as the anode according to our previous optimized conditions.38
2.3 Measurements and characterization
The electrochemical behavior of the TOPD film with thermal treatment at 90 °C for 5 min in N2 was characterized using cyclic voltammetry (CV, Zahner IM6e Electrochemical Workstation) in the potential range from −2.5 to −3.5 V with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. A Pt plate coated with a thin TOPD film, a Pt wire and an Ag/Ag+ electrode were employed as the working electrode, counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively. The absorption and transmittance spectra of the bare ITO and ITO/TOPD film were recorded on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. The thicknesses for different films were measured using an Ambios Technology XP-2 surface profilometer. The surface morphologies of the ITO, ITO/TOPD, ITO/PBDB-T:ITIC-M and ITO/TOPD/PBDB-T:ITIC-M films were analyzed using a VEECO DICP-II atomic force microscopy (AFM) system operated in the tapping mode under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature.
Device characterization of current density–voltage (J–V) performance was conducted in a nitrogen-filled glove box using a Keithley 2400 Source Measure Unit under simulated AM1.5G solar irradiation with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (from SAN-EI LTD, AAA grade). The incident photon to electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) was determined using a QE-R system (Enli Tech., Kaohsiung, Taiwan) in air at room temperature. The intensity of each wavelength both in J–V and IPCE was calibrated with a standard single crystalline silicon photovoltaic device purchased from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Properties of the TOPD film
A TOPD film with excellent robustness was prepared by spin coating an isopropanol solution of TOPD with a post heating treatment. Fig. 1 presents the XPS spectra of the TOPD film before and after thermal annealing. The C 1s peak at 285.6 eV was chosen as the reference in order to analyse the spectra for the determination of the binding energy (BE) values of different elements. The BE positions of Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 for the TOPD film are at 459.4 and 465.2 eV, respectively, with a peak separation (D) of 5.8 eV (see Fig. 1b), which agree with the BE values of Ti4+ in a titanyl complex. The XPS spectra of the O 1s core level are shown in Fig. 1c. Before the TOPD film is annealed, the O 1s spectrum is resolved into two peaks at ca. 531.1 eV, corresponding to the oxygen in isopropoxy groups bonded to titanium and at ca. 532.5 eV, corresponding to the oxygen in the carbonyl group of the acetylacetonic ligand cycle. The C 1s peak at ca. 285.6 eV is assigned to the carbon in the C–H/C–C group, and at 287.4 eV, corresponds to the carbon in delocalized CO of the ligand cycle. The XPS measurements indicate that there is no chemical component change before and after thermal annealing at 90 °C for 5 min in N2.

Fig. 2 shows the optical properties and the electrochemical behavior of the TOPD film. As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the transmittance of ITO/TOPD approximates to that of bare ITO from 300 to 900 nm, demonstrating high transparency. It is noteworthy that ITO/TOPD exhibits a higher transparency than that of bare ITO from 350 to 510 nm, which provides additional contribution for light harvesting in the photoactive layer.39 Moreover, the totally opposite change trends of the absorption and transmittance spectra for the ITO/TOPD sample fully prove that the TOPD layer is highly transparent in the visible range.

Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry is an effective way to measure the molecular energy levels of polymers. The value of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) can be calculated according to eqn (1) and (2), respectively.40,41 LUMO = −e(Eonred + 4.71)(1) HOMO = −e(Eonoxi + 4.71)(2)where Eonred and Eonoxi are the onset reduction potential and onset oxidation potential. Fig. 2b shows the CV curve of the TOPD film on the platinum electrode after thermal annealing in N2 at 90 °C for 5 min in 0.1 mol L−1 Bu4NPF6, CH3CN solution at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. As can be seen from Fig. 2a, the onset reduction potential and onset oxidation potential are about −0.85 V and 2.1 eV vs. Ag/Ag+, respectively. Hence the LUMO and HOMO are −3.86 and −6.81 eV, respectively.

Fig. 3a illustrates the molecular structures of TOPD, PBDB-T and ITIC-M. Fig. 3b and c present the architecture of the device with TOPD and the LUMO and the HOMO energy levels of the materials involved the in i-PSCs. According to the operating principle of organic solar cells, the main function of the photosensitive layer is absorbing incident photons and producing plentiful excitons. The electron–hole pairs can be separated into individual electrons and holes when they encounter the junction between the PBDB-T and ITIC-M.42,43 Apparently, the LUMO energy level of TOPD (−3.86 eV) is even lower than that of the ITIC-M (−3.82 eV) acceptor, fulfilling an efficient electron transportation from the LUMO energy level of ITIC-M to that of the ITO cathode. Meanwhile, the 1.30 eV hole barrier between the HOMO level of TOPD (−6.81 eV) and that of ITIC-M (−5.51 eV) can effectively block the transportation of holes from PBDB-T to ITO, reducing carrier recombination losses at the interface. Consequently, a higher open-circuit voltage (Voc) can be expected. In addition, the transportation route from the HOMO level of PBDB-T to that of the Al anode for holes is clear. In a word, the energy level of TOPD can realize the selective collection of electrons and blocking of holes, satisfying the requirements of an ideal ECL.

3.2 The vertical phase separated photoactive layer
The carrier dissociation and transportation are greatly affected by the morphology and the phase of the bi-continuous networks between the electron donor and the electron acceptor in i-SCs. To illustrate and quantitatively compare the nanoscale morphologies of the acceptor, the donor and the photoactive blend film on bare ITO or ITO/TOPD, the AFM technique in tapping mode was applied in this work. The root mean square roughness (RMS) of the ITO is 2.12 nm (Fig. 4a and b), and it slightly increases to 2.86 nm (Fig. 4c and d) after incorporating the TOPD film. Clearly, the surface of the TOPD film remains as smooth and uniform as the bare ITO according to their phase images. The electron acceptor ITIC-M and electron donor PBDB-T deposited on ITO/TOPD present entirely different film formation characteristics. The pinholes are visible for the small molecular acceptor ITIC-M with a RMS of 0.83 nm (Fig. 4e and f) and there is no evident aggregation behaviour, while PBDB-T aggregates visibly and forms a compact film with a RMS of 2.10 nm (Fig. 4g and h). The RMS of 2.67 and 2.85 nm can be obtained for PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend films deposited on bare ITO and ITO/TOPD as shown in Fig. 4i and k, respectively. Both of the blend films are very similar to that of the pure PBDB-T film (2.10 nm) and inconsistent with that of the pure ITIC-M film (0.83 nm) as observed from both their topography and phase images in Fig. 4i–l. Furthermore, the RMS of the blend film increases from 2.67 to 2.85 nm after introducing TOPD between ITO and the photoactive layer, revealing that the TOPD layer increases the surface roughness of the photoactive layer. As summarized both from the topography and phase images of pure PBDB-T, pure ITIC-M and PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend films spin-coated on bare ITO or TOPD coated ITO substrates, two aspects should be highlighted. Above all, the surface morphologies of PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend films are dominated by that of PBDB-T, which suggests that the vertical phase-separation occurs between PBDB-T and ITIC-M within the blend film. Namely, there is more PBDB-T gathering on the top and more ITIC-M aggregating at the bottom of the blend film, ensuring efficient exciton separation and transportation, and thus boosting the performance of i-PSCs. Secondly, the surface morphologies of PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend films are influenced by the TOPD ECL. This means that the TOPD film increases the contact area and stronger interfacial adhesion between the photosensitive layer and the electrode, which is conductve to the electron collection ratio.44,45

Water contact angles (WCAs) were determined to verify the perpendicular phase-separation between PBDB-T and ITIC-M within the blend photoactive layer since different materials have different surface energies. Fig. 5 shows the pure ITIC-M, pure PBDB-T, and PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend films on bare ITO or TOPD coated ITO. As can be seen, the WCA for bare ITO (Fig. 5a) and TOPD (Fig. 5b) is 30.79° and 80.10°, respectively. The WCA for pure ITIC-M (Fig. 5c), pure PBDB-T (Fig. 5e) and PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend films (Fig. 5g) deposited on ITO are 92.02°, 100.57° and 100.99°, respectively. Obviously, the WCA of PBDB-T:ITIC-M is very close to that of the pure PBDB-T film, which clearly elucidate that the surface of blend films is governed by the PBDB-T film and the vertical phase-separation occurs between PBDB-T and ITIC-M within the blend film. The same trend and conclusion can be further confirmed from the WCA for the pure ITIC-M (Fig. 5d), pure PBDB-T (Fig. 5f) and PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend films (Fig. 5h) deposited on TOPD coated ITO. The WCA for the PBDB-T:ITIC-M blend film is more close to that of the pure PBDB-T (101.34°) and far away from pure ITIC-M (92.62°) on ITO/TOPD. Moreover, the WCA of the corresponding pure and blend films increases slightly upon introduction of the TOPD interfacial layer, pointing out that the topography of the photoactive layer is influenced by the ECL. This is in accordance with the AFM results and supports the proposed performance enhancement for i-PSCs because the vertical distribution of the acceptor–donor is helpful for charge separation and transportation.

Time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectroscopy (TOF-SIMS) was conducted to further ascertain the vertical phase separation in the blend film. As the molecular structures in Fig. 3a illustrate, the typical species for PBDB-T and ITIC-M are S2− and CN−, respectively. Hence, the concentration distribution of PBDB-T and ITIC-M in the blend film can be directly presented via the intensity variation of signals for S2− and CN−. Fig. 6 shows that the S2− intensity is prominently higher than that of CN− within the first 10 seconds, and then it declines linearly as the sputtering time increases; the CN− intensity increases as the sputtering time increases to 24 seconds and then declines slightly with further increasing sputtering time. This elucidates that PBDB-T is mainly distributed at the upper section and the ITIC-M gathers at the bottom of the blend film, and the former declines as the depth increases, while the latter enhances as the depth increases. This conclusion is more visually highlighted via the three dimensional (3-D) perpendicular concentration profile of the bend film in Fig. 6b and c, in which the green dots represent PBDB-T and red dots represent ITIC-M. Obviously, the PBDB-T and ITIC-M interpenetrate each other, and the upper section of the blend film distributes more PBDB-T and the bottom section gathers more ITIC-M. We speculate that the surface free energy of the TOPD layer affects the vertical component distribution of the PBDB-T:ITIC-M layer. However, the underlying mechanism is complicated, and further tests need to be done to allow us to elucidate it. These observations until now allow the conclusion that the vertical concentration distribution ensures the efficient carrier dissociation as well as the formation of an independent pathway for carrier transportation, foretelling higher short circuit density (Jsc).

Fig. 7 presents the J–V results and IPCE spectra of the i-PSCs with and without TOPD, the conventional device, and the i-PSCs with the ZnO layer. The device parameters under the illumination of AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2 (averaged over 12 individual devices) are compared in Table 1. As can be seen from Fig. 7a, the i-PSC with TOPD demonstrates superior performance to both control devices. The i-PSC without TOPD affords the lowest PCE of 4.59%, with a Voc of 0.704 V, a Jsc of 15.08 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 43.20%. While, the PCE distinctly increases to 10.23%, with a Voc of 0.918 V, a Jsc of 16.95 mA cm−2 and a FF of 65.75% for the i-PSC with TOPD. The high enhancement of Voc up to 0.21 V can be explained by the 1.30 eV hole barrier between the HOMO level of TOPD (6.81 eV) and ITIC-M (5.51 eV).46 Meanwhile, the 1.87 mA cm−2 enhancement of Jsc is attributed to the vertical phase separated blend film and the high transparent TOPD layer. In summary, the encouraging recovery of PCE as high as 5.64% is successfully obtained via the synergy of the vertical phase separated photoactive layer and the TOPD layer.

The device with the conventional BHJ structure gives a PCE of 9.08%, a Voc of 0.913 V, a Jsc of 14.80 mA cm−2 and a FF of 60.2%. The i-PSC with ZnO affords a PCE of 9.68%, with a Voc of 0.921 V, a Jsc of 16.25 mA cm−2 and a FF of 64.67%. Evidently, the parameters are inferior to those of the corresponding i-PSCs with TOPD. As observed from the aforementioned results, the increased Jsc as high as 2.15 mA cm−2 for the i-PSC is achieved in comparison to the traditional BHJ cell. The cause for this is certainly related to two aspects. The first involves the positive function for charge transportation and extraction of the TOPD layer besides its excellent optical properties.26 The second deals with the inverted device structure, which is more suitable for the perpendicular phase separation between the donor/acceptor in the photoactive layer.47 Correspondingly, their IPCE spectra are presented in Fig. 7b. It is clear that the device with TOPD presents an enhanced IPCE from 500 to 700 nm with a peak of 81% at 680 nm, indicating that TOPD improves the light response of i-PSCs.
A careful study about the influence of annealing temperatures and thicknesses of TOPD on the device performance was carried out, as shown in Fig. 8. The corresponding device parameters (averaged over 12 devices) are summarized in Table 2. As can be seen from Fig. 8a, the J–V curves change greatly as the annealing temperature of TOPD increases from 80 °C to 120 °C. The Jsc passes through a maximum value of 16.95 mA cm−2 with the best PCE of 10.23% when the annealing temperature is 90 °C. Further increasing the annealing temperature of the TOPD layer reduces the photovoltaic performance yet, and the PCE is only 6.07% with a Jsc of 15.26 mA cm−2 at 120 °C. While the Voc maintains a value of over 0.91 V when the temperature enhances from 80 °C to 100 °C, and then decreases evidently to 0.865 V maybe due to the weaker absorption of TOPD baked at 120 °C. Fig. 8b presents the corresponding IPCE spectra. Delightfully, all the devices show distinguished optical response performance except the device with TOPD baked at 120 °C, and the peak value of IPCE reaches up to 81%. Apparently, the annealing temperature of the TOPD layer plays an important role in device performance. Hence, further understanding its influence on the vertical component distribution is crucial for boosting device metrics, which is the area warranting our in-depth study.

Fig. 8c displays the J–V curves of i-PSCs with different TOPD thicknesses, which range from 7 to 20 nm. It appears clearly that the Jsc passes through the maximum of 16.95 mA cm−2 with a PCE of 10.23% when the thickness of TOPD is 14.0 nm. This can be explained by the trade-off between the effective suppression of the leakage current and minimizing the series resistance (Rs) of i-PSCs.48 Namely, a thicker ECL can efficiently suppress the leakage current caused by pinholes or other defects. Nevertheless, an excessive thickness of the TOPD interfacial layer boosts the Rs of the i-PSCs, resulting in the reduction of Jsc. Fig. 8d exhibits the corresponding IPCE spectra of the devices. The integrated Jsc are 15.01, 15.59, 16.14, 16.69, 16.07 and 15.86 mA cm−2, which are in accordance with the results of J–V and supports the above mentioned mechanism. Hence, the fundamental thickness compromise is necessary for the maximum device performance.
4. Conclusions
Here, we report an encouraging efficiency enhancement of i-PSCs with the synergy of a TOPD layer and a vertical phase separated photoactive layer. The TOPD buffer layer with an outstanding energy level and optical and morphological properties was prepared by spin-coating techniques with a lower temperature heating treatment. The unique vertical phase separated photoactive layer of PBDB-T:ITIC-M guarantees effective exciton dissociation and simultaneously ensures the formation of continuous and unhindered pathways for carrier transportation. Their conjunct effects both facilitate the selective carrier collection and reduce the carrier recombination, realizing a high enhancement of Voc up to 0.21 V besides a 1.87 mA cm−2 boosted short circuit current density. Consequently, an encouraging increased PCE from 4.59% to 10.23% is achieved for i-PSCs based on the PBDB-T:ITIC-M active layer, exceeding the traditional BHJ-PSCs with the efficiency of 9.08%. This general and facile strategy also highlights easy fabrication and may benefit highly efficient and stable all soluble-processed i-PSCs.
