    , Accepted 11th June 2018First published on 11th June 2018AbstractTin (Sn) based perovskites have drawn much attention for their narrower band gap and being more eco-friendly than other solar cell materials. However, general one-step processing methods lead to poor quality Sn-based perovskite films. Here, high quality low-bandgap mixed Sn–Pb perovskite films were achieved on a hydrophobic hole transport layer via a two-step processing method from Sn0.3Pb0.7I2 and FA0.7MA0.3I precursors in sequence. The obtained dense FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 film shows a low-bandgap of 1.26 eV, and larger grains compared with one-step processed film. Using the high-quality film prepared, we fabricated FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3-based inverted perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) with a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.6% with negligible current–voltage hysteresis, which is among the best PCEs for low-bandgap Sn-based PVSCs. The enhanced performance is attributed to reduced recombination and improved charge transportation caused by the vertically aligned larger grains and higher crystallinity in the perovskite film. The unencapsulated cells maintained 80% of their initial performance after being stored for 30 d in a glove-box. This work provides one simple path toward high quality film for high performance Sn-based perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal-halide perovskites have been attracting much attention as promising photovoltaic materials in recent years due to their unique optical and electronic properties.1,2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) has been remarkably boosted from 3.8% to 23.1%.3–11 Replacing the lead (Pb) in the most commonly employed perovskites fully or partially with tin (Sn) could make perovskites more environmentally friendly and also extend their light absorption into the near-infrared spectrum, which could enhance the current in single-junction solar cells or lead to applications in tandem solar cells;12,13 thus this type of low-bandgap mixed Sn–Pb halide perovskites has drawn much attention. For example, Jen and co-workers reported MASnxPb1−xI3−xClx (MA = methylammonium, x varies from 1 to 3) PVSCs with PCEs of 10% and 14.2% for 1.38 eV and 1.33 eV bandgap perovskites, respectively.14–16 Li et al. reported a PCE of up to 13.6% from an MASn0.5Pb0.5I3-based perovskite with a bandgap of 1.17 eV.17 Through mixing FASnI3 (FA = formamidinium) and MAPbI3 precursors, Yan et al. successfully fabricated 15.0% PCE PVSCs with a bandgap of ∼1.25 eV.18 McGehee and Snaith and co-workers demonstrated a PCE of 14.8% with 1.22 eV low-bandgap FA0.75Cs0.25Sn0.5Pb0.5I3 cells.12 Very recently, Yan et al. demonstrated efficient low-bandgap (∼1.25 eV) (FASnI3)0.6(MAPbI3)0.4 PVSCs with the highest PCE to date, over 17.6%, and a certified PCE of 17.01% with high external quantum efficiency at infrared wavelengths.19 This was due to a high quality thick perovskite film, with high crystallinity and long carrier lifetime, created via optimizing the precursor concentration. Further improving the perovskite film quality, with a large-grained dense microstructure, a flat surface and longer carrier lifetimes, may further enhance the device performance of low-bandgap mixed Sn–Pb PVSCs.20–24
Here, high quality low bandgap mixed Sn–Pb perovskite films were achieved via the direct intramolecular exchange of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) molecules intercalated in PbI2/SnI2 with FAI/MAI. The obtained dense FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 film shows a low bandgap of 1.26 eV, and larger grains were observed compared with film fabricated via one-step processing. The grain size can be further increased to ∼1 μm with vertically aligned grain boundaries through introducing poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as a hole-transporting layer (HTL). Using the high quality film prepared, we fabricated FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3-based inverted PVSCs with a maximum PCE of 13.6% with negligible current–voltage hysteresis, which are among the best low-bandgap perovskite solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
Unless stated otherwise, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) was purchased from Xi'an Polymer Light Technology Corporation. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxy-thiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) (Clevios P VP Al 4083) was purchased from H. C. Stark Company. CH3NH3I (MAI) and CH(NH2)2I (FAI) were purchased from Shanghai Materwin New Materials Co. Ltd. SnI2 (99.999%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. PC61BM was purchased from American Dyes Source, Inc. ZnO nanoparticles were synthesized via a sol–gel process using Zn acetate and tetramethylammonium hydroxide ethanol (TMAH).25 TMAH·5H2O (543.24 mg) dissolved in ethanol (5.45 mL) was added dropwise to Zn(Ac)2·2H2O (657.33 mg) dissolved in DMSO solvent, followed by stirring for an hour at room temperature. After washing at least two times in ethanol, ZnO nanoparticles were dispersed in pure isopropanol at a concentration of ∼10 mg mL−1. The ITO substrate was purchased from Hangzhou Hongshi Electronic Technology Co., Ltd, and its resistance is 8–10 Ω per γ.
Solution preparation
The one-step FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 precursor solution (1 M) was obtained via mixing stoichiometric amounts of FAPbI3 (1 M) and MASnI3 (1 M) precursors into a DMF and DMSO mixed solvent (molar ratio of 1:1) and stirring at 70 °C for 2 h. The two-step Sn0.3Pb0.7I2 precursor solution (1 M) was prepared via dissolving SnI2 (111.75 mg) and PbI2 (322.70 mg) into 1 mL of DMF and 71 μL of DMSO and stirring at 70 °C for 2 h. The FA0.7MA0.3I precursor solution (1 M) was prepared via dissolving FAI (39.39 mg) and MAI (15.61 mg) into 1 mL of isopropanol. PC61BM was dissolved in chlorobenzene at a concentration of 20 mg mL−1. PTAA was dissolved in toluene at a concentration of 5 mg mL−1.
Device fabrication
The ITO-coated glass substrates were cleaned via sonication using detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol sequentially for 20 min each, followed by 20 min of ultraviolet ozone (UV-ozone) treatment. Then a layer of 30 nm thick PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the cleaned ITO at 4000 rpm for 40 s, and baked in air at 140 °C for 15 min. The substrates were transferred into a glovebox (the O2 and H2O concentrations were kept below 0.01 and 0.02 ppm). A layer of 10–15 nm thick PTAA can be formed via spin-coating at 6000 rpm for 45 s in the glovebox. The one-step perovskite films were fabricated via spin-coating 30 μL of precursor solution at 5000 rpm for 45 s and quickly dripping 150 μL of chlorobenzene on this 6 s after the beginning. The films were placed on a hotplate at 120 °C for 4 min. The two-step mixed precursor solution was spun on the PEDOT:PSS or PTAA layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Then, the mixed FAI and MAI solution was spun on the substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Afterward, the obtained films were annealed at 130 °C or 160 °C for 10 min. A layer of 40 nm thick PC61BM was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 30 s. A 40 nm thick hole-blocking layer was deposited via spin-coating ZnO nanoparticles at 4000 rpm for 30 s on top of the PC61BM layer. Subsequently, samples were loaded into a vacuum deposition chamber (background pressure ≈ 5 × 10−4 Pa) to deposit a 100 nm thick Al cathode with a shadow mask, defining an active device area of 6.0 mm2.
Measurements and characterization
The J–V characteristics were measured in a glovebox under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G solar irradiation, and the steady-state photocurrents were measured at a bias voltage (0.58 V) near the maximum power point and at a stabilized power output for a period of 300 s. EQE spectra were measured using a Stanford Research System Model SR830 lock-in amplifier unit coupled with a monochromator and a 500 W xenon lamp, and a calibrated Si photodiode with a known spectral response was used as a reference. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were recorded at a scan rate of 5 deg min−1 using a Rigaku D/max-2550PC X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (1.5406 nm). The film morphologies were characterized using SEM (Quanta 400). UV-vis absorption spectra were obtained with a UV-vis spectrometer (Cary-5000). Steady-state PL spectra were obtained with an FLS920 fluorescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm.
Results and discussion
The perovskite films were fabricated via a one-step or two-step method on different substrates (Fig. S1†). In the one-step processing method, PbI2, SnI2, FAI and MAI were mixed together in dimethylformamide (DMF) and spin-coated, while in the two-step processing method, a PbI2/SnI2 layer was firstly deposited from DMF/MDSO mixed solvent and subsequently an FAI/MAI layer was deposited from isopropanol (IPA) solution. Poly(3,4-ethlyenedioxythiophene): poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) was used as a hole transport layer (HTL). The obtained films from both methods look uniform and reflective after annealing, which is necessary for the fabrication of planar devices. The morphologies and grain size distributions of the different films obtained via a one-step or two-step processing method were compared through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1(a) and (b) show plane view images of FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 films prepared via a one-step method and a two-step method on a PEDOT:PSS substrate, respectively. Fig. 1(d) and (e) are corresponding cross-sectional images of whole devices with similar thicknesses of 230–280 nm. It is obvious that the average grain sizes of perovskite crystals on the PEDOT:PSS substrate increase to 200–300 nm upon using a two-step method instead of a one-step method. Large grains of over 1 μm with vertically aligned grain boundaries were achieved on the PTAA substrate from the two-step method (Fig. 1(c) and (f)). Most of the grain boundaries were perpendicular to the PTAA substrate in the films to minimize the grain boundary energy. PTAA was demonstrated as an efficient HTL and can increase the grain size of the perovskite on top.26 Elemental mapping of I, Pb and Sn elements in the FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 perovskite film, acquired via energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), shows the film was uniform (Fig. S2†). Since the surface of PTAA film is non-wetting and more smooth compared to that of PEDOT:PSS film, PTAA film drastically reduces the surface tension dragging force on the perovskite layer and inhibits nucleation in small cavities, resulting in a higher grain boundary mobility, which allows larger grains to grow,27 as shown in Fig. 2.

In order to further characterize the optical properties of the perovskite films processed via various methods on different HTL substrates, we measured the UV-vis absorption spectra of the FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 films on quartz, as shown in Fig. 3(a). The Sn-based perovskite absorption edge is quite vague, which may be due to the oxidation of Sn2+ in air, caused by the formation of the sub-bandgap state, making it difficult to determine the optical bandgaps.28 Therefore, we used the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the same samples as a supplementary measurement to obtain bandgaps, as shown in Fig. 3(b). The bandgaps were calculated from the PL emission peaks to be 1.30, 1.28 and 1.26 eV for a one-step method on PEDOT:PSS, a two-step method on PEDOT:PSS and a two-step method on PTAA, respectively. We observed that the emission peak intensity was significantly enhanced and the optical absorption edge moved to longer wavelengths (lower energies) along with the PL peak position by about 30 nm, and the peak shapes became sharper, because of the larger crystallites.29 X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 perovskite films processed via various methods on different substrates are shown in Fig. 3(c). The spectrum from the perovskite film prepared via a two-step method on PTAA was especially strong and sharp, agreeing well with its bigger grains and better film crystallinity.

A schematic diagram of the device structure and the device performances of solar cells based on FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 perovskite films processed via different methods are shown in Fig. 4. The inverted device consists of ITO/HTL (PEDOT:PSS or PTAA)/perovskite/PC61BM/ZnO NPs/Al, as shown in Fig. 4(a). The devices were optimized by tuning FAI/MAI ratio as well as the concentration, annealing temperature and annealing time for the perovskite layer on PEDOT:PSS or PTAA. Fig. 4(b) shows current density–voltage (J–V) curves from the best devices based on perovskite films processed via various methods on different substrates. The corresponding photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. If we change the processing of the perovskite film from a one-step method on PEDOT:PSS to a two-step method on PEDOT:PSS and a two-step method on PTAA, VOC increases from 0.631 to 0.718 and to 0.782 V, JSC increases from 17.7 to 19.0 and to 23.6 mA cm−2, the fill factor (FF) increases from 0.644 to 0.721 and to 0.737, and the PCE increases from 7.1% to 9.7% and to 13.6%. These are among the best low-bandgap perovskite solar cells, especially using a two-step method on a PTAA substrate (Table S1†). The calculated JSC values from the external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves (Fig. 4(c)) are close to those from the J–V curves. The improved photovoltaic performance is attributed to the vertically aligned larger grains and higher crystallinity in the perovskite film processed via a two-step method on the PTAA substrate, which is demonstrated in the above analysis (Fig. 1 and 2). On one hand, the larger grain size and higher crystallinity reduces the grain boundaries, leading to a lower trap density, and thus reducing recombination and increasing VOC and JSC subsequently. The recombination kinetics were studied carefully through measuring VOC values at various light intensities. As shown in Fig. 5, VOC varies logarithmically (ln(I)) with light intensity. Under open-circuit conditions, the current is zero; all carriers recombine within the cell. Thus, recombination studies near the open circuit voltage are particularly sensitive to details regarding the recombination mechanism. The slopes for three types of device were 1.8, 2.0 and 1.2 kT e−1, respectively. The high slopes of nearly 2 kT e−1 for the one/two-step method on PEDOT:PSS-based devices indicate that monomolecular recombination (Shockley–Read–Hall) through a trap state or recombination center is dominant, even under open circuit conditions. The perovskite layer from a two-step method on PTAA has the lowest slope, close to 1 kT e−1, indicating a lower trap density in PTAA two-step method based film compared to the other two perovskite layers.30,31 On the other hand, the vertical and straight grain boundaries may facilitate charge transportation, and thus a higher FF.27 As indicated from the hole mobilities for different films measured via the space-charge-limited-current (SCLC) method (Fig. S3 and Table S2†), the perovskite film fabricated via a two-step processing method on PTAA shows the highest hole mobility. As a result, a high PCE of 13.6% is delivered, which is among the best values for low-bandgap perovskite solar cells so far.

Based on the above results, we further investigated the best PVSC, based on FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 perovskite film processed via a two-step method on the PTAA substrate. The champion device exhibited negligible current–voltage hysteresis, as shown in Fig. 6(a), with a maximum PCE of 13.6%, a VOC value of 0.782 V, a JSC value of 23.6 mA cm−2, and a FF of 73.7% from reverse scanning, and a PCE of 13.4%, a VOC value of 0.784 V, a JSC value of 23.8 mA cm−2, a FF of 72.8% from forward scanning. It is suggested that the larger grains in the perovskite film reduce the grain boundary area, and thus there is little current hysteresis (Fig. S4 and Table S3†) in the devices compared to PEDOT:PSS substrate devices.32 The dark J–V curve (Fig. S5†) suggests a relatively low dark current, indicating there is no significant “blocking” of charge transfer at either interface.33 In order to further confirm the reliability of our PCEs, the best device was examined under the applied bias voltage (0.58 V) at the maximum power output point. The steady-state photocurrent is ∼22.3 mA cm−2 within 300 s, with a stabilized power output of ∼13.0%, as shown in Fig. 6(b). A histogram of efficiencies for 35 devices is shown in Fig. 6(c). The average PCE was 11.7% ± 0.5%, with an average VOC value of 0.742 ± 0.013 V, an average JSC value of 23.3 ± 0.76 mA cm−2, and an average FF of 66.3% ± 3.1%. Besides the high reproducibility, the FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3-based device also had high stability. As shown in Fig. 6(d), 80% of its initial PCE was maintained after a period of 30 d storage in a nitrogen-filled glove-box.

Conclusions
In summary, low-bandgap (1.26 eV) FA0.7MA0.3Sn0.3Pb0.7I3 perovskite film with vertically aligned large grains and high crystallinity was fabricated via a two-step processing method on top of a hydrophobic PTAA HTL. We found that the combination of a hydrophobic surface and two-step processing in our case is the key to obtaining high quality perovskite films. Solar cells based on this perovskite film show a maximum PCE of 13.6% with negligible current–voltage hysteresis, which is among the best PCEs for low-bandgap Sn-based PVSCs reported so far. The enhanced performance is attributed to reduced recombination and improved charge transportation, caused by the vertically aligned larger grains and higher crystallinity in the perovskite film. Unencapsulated cells maintained 80% of their initial performance after being stored for 30 d in a glove-box. This work provides one simple path toward high quality film for high performance Sn-based perovskite solar cells.
