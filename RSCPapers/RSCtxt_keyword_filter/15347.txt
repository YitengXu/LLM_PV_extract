    , Accepted 3rd April 2018First published on 6th April 2018AbstractChalcopyrite thin film absorbers such as Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS) exhibit excellent solar energy conversion efficiency, particularly when coupled with CdS to form an excellent p–n junction. To advance CIGS towards an efficient photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a protective overlayer (typically TiO2) is needed to prevent the corrosion of CIGS and CdS in the electrolyte, and a HER catalyst (typically Pt) is required to promote the surface reaction. However, it is a great challenge to realize delicate spatial control of the HER catalyst on the surface of the protective overlayer using the traditional deposition method. The charge transport through the CdS/overlayer interface is also of vital importance but is rarely considered. Herein, through a new two-step platinization strategy, the dispersion and particle size of Pt nanoparticles are independently controlled to realize high HER catalytic activity. Moreover, defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface are passivated via an ultrathin Al2O3 insertion layer. Consequently, we have obtained a robust CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/Pt photocathode for PEC hydrogen evolution, which yields an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 6.6% in neutral electrolyte with a long-term stability up to 8 h (4.5% drop), and an unprecedented ABPE of 9.3% in acidic electrolyte that is the highest among chalcopyrite-based photocathodes. When paired with a BiVO4 photoanode to form a PEC tandem cell, an unbiased solar-to-hydrogen conversion efficiency of 1.01% is achieved.

Broader context
Climate change and the ever-increasing energy demand continue to drive the clean-energy momentum. By converting solar energy into energy stored in chemical bonds, solar water splitting provides a carbon-neutral alternative to address energy and environmental issues. In view of their excellent light absorption, tunable band gaps, and sufficient photovoltage, chalcopyrite/CdS based thin film junctions have drawn great attention as promising photocathodes to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of water splitting. An increasing number of investigations have focused on adopting protective layers and cocatalysts for chalcopyrite/CdS to improve its stability and surface reaction kinetics. However, satisfactory performance has not yet been obtained, primarily due to the uncontrollable deposition of surface HER cocatalysts as well as the considerable charge recombination at the interface between CdS and protective layers. Using Cu(In,Ga)Se2/CdS as a prototype, we have demonstrated a two-step platinization strategy to independently control the size and dispersion of Pt cocatalysts towards faster surface reaction. Moreover, the Al2O3 interlayer was adopted to passivate the defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface for improved charge transfer. The resultant photocathode achieved an efficiency of 9.3% in acidic electrolyte and realized unassisted water splitting with the BiVO4 photoanode. This paper presents new insights into controlling the surface and interfacial properties of heterojunction photoelectrodes.

1. Introduction
Being a clean, sustainable, and storable fuel, hydrogen produced by solar-driven water splitting has attracted enormous interest as a solution to our energy and environmental problems. Among the narrow bandgap p-type semiconductors, I–III–VI2 (I = Cu, Ag; III = In, Ga; VI = S, Se) chalcopyrite materials, including Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGS),1–3 CuInS2,4 and (Ag,Cu)GaSe2,5 have drawn great attention as promising photocathodes for the photoelectrochemical (PEC) hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Chalcopyrite films possess several unique advantages. Their bandgap values can be easily controlled by tuning the composition,6 offering great flexibility in forming tandem cells.3 Additionally, optical absorption coefficients of chalcopyrite films normally exceed 105 cm−1, which decreases the required thickness and therefore makes chalcopyrite suitable for flexible substrates to lower manufacturing costs.7
The n-type material that forms p–n junctions with chalcopyrite absorbers is the key to improving the photovoltage and electron–hole separation, both for PEC photocathodes and solar cells.8–11 Some wide bandgap n-type materials such as In2S3,12 ZnS,13 and Zn(O,S)14 offer high transparency for chalcopyrite to increase the current collection in the shorter wavelength region,15 but their large lattice mismatch and imperfect band offset with CIGS restrict the energy conversion efficiency. To date, CdS film obtained from chemical bath deposition (CBD) still stands out as the best n-type layer in CIGS-dominated chalcopyrite solar cells10 and photocathodes11 because of its suitable band offset and ideal lattice matching with the underlying absorber.
Nonetheless, the requirement of chalcopyrite/CdS photocathodes is much more demanding than that of the solar cell counterparts, mainly due to the difficulty of charge transfer and surface reaction at the electrode/electrolyte interface, as well as the instability of chalcopyrite/CdS electrodes in aqueous solutions.16 To extend the application of excellent chalcopyrite/CdS junctions to aqueous solutions for PEC hydrogen production, a protective overlayer with high carrier conductivity is necessary.17 Grätzel and colleagues used Al:ZnO (AZO) and TiO2 layers for the CuInS2/CdS junction to facilitate charge transfer and protect the electrode from deactivation.18 Ikeda and co-workers modified the porous CuInS2/CdS with a TiO2 layer to increase the photocurrent and onset potential.4 A large leap in maximum efficiency was achieved by Domen et al., where a surface-modified CIGS photocathode with Mo/Ti conductive layers showed an applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of 8.5%.1
On the surface of the protective overlayer, Pt is often used as an outstanding HER catalyst to promote hydrogen production.19,20 To realize high HER performance on electrodes, there needs to be a delicate control over the spatial dispersion and size of attached Pt nanoparticles (NPs) to gain maximum light transmission and large active areas. On the one hand, adequate light transmission ensures a high saturation photocurrent as determined by the underlying absorber.21 On the other hand, the large active areas of Pt NPs in contact with the electrolyte provide enough active areas for elevated HER activity.22 Photoelectrodeposition (PED) is an efficient and commonly used method for Pt deposition.23–25 Unfortunately, it is difficult to control the dispersion and size of Pt NPs in PED processes because the growth sites are always randomly distributed.26 As a result, the non-uniform Pt dispersion and undesired particle size reduce the active areas for the electrodes and limit their PEC performance.27,28 Therefore, how to finely control the spatial dispersion and particle size of Pt on photocathodes for remarkable PEC hydrogen production remains a great challenge.
Another rarely investigated but critical factor for chalcopyrite/CdS photocathodes is the CdS/overlayer interface, which largely affects their fill factor29 and the resultant photo-conversion efficiency. Though most photoelectrons could be transported from the chalcopyrite/CdS p–n junction to TiO2via the conduction band, the driving force for electron transfer at the CdS/TiO2 interface would be very limited owing to the small band bending at this interface (the conduction band offset between CdS and TiO2 is only 0.2 eV). Thus, a considerable amount of electrons would be trapped in defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface. These defects might come from dangling bonds30 or unfavourable vacancies31 at the interface, which cause electron–hole recombination. Hence, the elimination of defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface is urgently needed to optimize the electron transport pathway in pursuit of a higher fill factor and efficiency.
Herein, taking CIGS/CdS/TiO2 as a prototype, we propose an original two-step platinization method to independently control the spatial dispersion and particle size of Pt NPs to realize high active areas for HER, with light transmission nearly unaffected. At the same time, the defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface are passivated by an ultrathin Al2O3 layer, thus facilitating electron transport in the bulk of the electrode. As a consequence, we obtain a CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/Pt photocathode that exhibits an ABPE of 6.6% in neutral electrolyte (1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) with a long-term stability up to 8 h. When applied in acidic electrolyte (1 M HClO4, pH 0), this photocathode achieves an ABPE value of 9.3% with nearly no deactivation in a 2 h duration. This is the best PEC performance ever reported among chalcopyrite-based photocathodes.
2. Results and discussion
2.1 Construction of CIGS-based photocathodes for HER
The CIGS film was grown by co-evaporation on a molybdenum/glass back contact. A cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) view (Fig. S1b, ESI†) indicates that the as-prepared CIGS film consists of columnar grains with an average grain size nearly equal to the film thickness (∼2 μm). A compact and pinhole-free CdS layer with a thickness of approximately 50 nm was deposited onto CIGS using the CBD method (Fig. S1c and d, ESI†), constructing an efficient p–n junction due to the uniform coverage and optimal thickness of CdS.32 Afterwards, an amorphous TiO2 film with a thickness of 18 nm was deposited onto CdS by atomic layer deposition (ALD)33,34 at 150 °C. The dense and robust TiO2 layer not only prevents aqueous solution from contacting the underlying CdS, but also facilitates electron transfer from CIGS/CdS through the conduction band of TiO2, and simultaneously blocks hole diffusion outwards because of the deep valence-band maximum of TiO2.35–39
2.2 Two-step platinization to independently control the spatial dispersion and particle size of Pt for improved HER activity
When only the PED process is conducted on CIGS/CdS/TiO2, poorly dispersed Pt NPs with uneven particle size are observed (Fig. 1d), indicating the scarce Pt growth sites with non-uniform distribution on the surface of amorphous TiO2.40,41 As expected, this electrode (denoted as CIGS/CdS/TiO2/PED-Pt) shows nearly the same poor PEC performance as bare CIGS/CdS/TiO2, where the photocurrent sluggishly rises from an onset potential (Von) of 0.4 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and attains just 3.8 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE (Fig. S2 (ESI†), purple line). To solve this problem, we designed an original two-step platinization approach (Fig. 1a, e, and g). In the first step, well-dispersed small Pt NPs with a uniform size of ∼1.7 nm (Fig. 1f and Fig. S3a, ESI†) were deposited onto the TiO2 surface via direct current (DC) sputtering (denoted as CIGS/CdS/TiO2/Sputter-Pt). Afterwards, PED was conducted to further promote Pt growth on pre-sputtered Pt seeds while maintaining the uniform dispersion (Fig. 1h). In the second step, the particle size of Pt could be precisely controlled when growing on pre-sputtered seeds, and the optimal size after this two-step platinization was around 2.8 nm (Fig. S3b, ESI,† with the resultant electrode denoted as CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt). Although a small fraction of Pt might grow directly on TiO2 during the PED step, these scarce PED-Pt NPs exhibit little promotive effect on PEC performance as indicated by the similar J–V characteristics of the samples shown in Fig. 1a and d (Fig. S2, ESI†).

The Sputter-Pt is highly dispersed as growth seeds for PED-Pt, making possible the fine control of light transmittance. The influence of the Sputter-Pt amount on light transmittance was investigated by UV-vis spectroscopy. Soda lime glass (SLG) was used as the substrate because the Mo layer would completely block light transmission. When sputtering time was increased from 0 s to 15 s, the transmittance remained almost unchanged (Fig. S4a, ESI†). However, when the sputtering time was further increased to 30 s, the Pt NPs grew larger and coalesced into a continuous film (Fig. S4b, ESI†), thus decreasing the light transmittance (Fig. S4a, ESI†). Therefore, we chose 15 s as the optimized sputter time. The fill factor of the CIGS/CdS/TiO2/Sputter-Pt electrode was as low as 10% (the definition of fill factor can be found in the Experimental section), indicating the restrained HER reaction on the surface. This unsatisfactory PEC performance may come from the insufficient active areas of Pt NPs because the sputtered Pt NPs were partially embedded in the TiO2 layer during the high-energy atom bombardment.42
To further increase the active areas of Pt NPs, PED Pt was further grown on pre-sputtered Pt seeds (15 s sputter time), while maintaining the original uniform dispersion and adequate light transmission. PEC performance was used as the indicator to control the amount of electronic charge during the PED process (Fig. S5, ESI†), while the CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt electrode with the optimized PED amount was adopted in Fig. 2. Compared with CIGS/CdS/TiO2/Sputter-Pt (15 s sputter time), the CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt photocathode exhibited a significantly improved fill factor from 10% to 34.6% and a saturation photocurrent from 15 mA cm−2 to 26 mA cm−2 (Fig. 2a), indicating that S-P-Pt shows better HER activity than Sputter-Pt. The corresponding sizes of Pt NPs increased from ∼1.7 nm (Sputter-Pt, Fig. 1f and Fig. S3a, ESI†) to ∼2.8 nm (S-P-Pt, Fig. 1h and Fig. S3b, ESI†), while the Pt amount increased from ∼420 to ∼1000 ng cm−2. However, there was no improvement in photocurrent when we further increased the Sputter-Pt amount from ∼420 (15 s sputter time) to ∼1000 ng cm−2 (30 s sputter time), indicating no increase of the active areas by just extending the sputter time (Fig. 2a). The actual loading amount of Pt under different deposition conditions was verified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES). The enhanced fill factor and photocurrent together with the increased Pt NPs sizes illustrate the larger active areas of S-P-Pt compared to Sputter-Pt.

(d) Corresponding Tafel plots obtained from (c). Sample details: Sputter-Pt (30 s): CIGS/CdS/TiO2/Sputter-Pt (30 s sputtering, 1000 ng cm−2); Sputter-Pt (15 s): CIGS/CdS/TiO2/Sputter-Pt (15 s sputtering, 420 ng cm−2); S-P-Pt: CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt (15 s sputtering + PED, 1000 ng cm−2). 
To further elucidate the larger active areas of S-P-Pt over Sputter-Pt, we conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) for CIGS/CdS/TiO2/Sputter-Pt (30 s sputter time) and CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt electrodes (Fig. 2b), where the overall Pt mass loadings for these two electrodes were both 1000 ng cm−2 (confirmed by ICP-OES). In the Nyquist plots, the radius of each arc is related to the charge transfer behaviour at the electrode/electrolyte interface and a smaller radius implies a smaller charge transfer resistance (Rct).43,44 The fitted Rb (serial resistance) values of electrodes with Sputter-Pt and S-P-Pt were nearly the same, owing to the same CIGS/CdS/TiO2 film stack. In contrast, Rct was reduced from 89.97 to 44.95 ohm (Table S1, ESI†), indicating that S-P-Pt presented more active areas than Sputter-Pt with the same mass loading, which reduced charge transfer resistance thus enhancing the PEC water reduction performance.22,45
CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt showed a smaller HER overpotential (η) and a faster rise in cathodic current compared to CIGS/CdS/TiO2/Sputter-Pt (Fig. 2c) in dark conditions. From the corresponding Tafel plots (Fig. 2d), CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt exhibited a Tafel slope of 71 mV dec−1, which is about half the value of CIGS/CdS/TiO2/Sputter-Pt (30 s, 145 mV dec−1), in which the amounts of Pt loadings were both 1000 ng cm−2. The smaller Tafel slope for S-P-Pt illustrates the faster HER kinetics of S-P-Pt than Sputter-Pt, possibly because PED-Pt from the second platinization step could improve the coverage of adsorbed hydrogen on the Pt surface, thus changing the hydrogen evolution mechanism.22,45,46 This result implies that the well-dispersed S-P-Pt shows faster HER kinetics than Sputter-Pt, contributing to a better PEC hydrogen production performance.
The two-step platinization process realized the fine control of spatial dispersion and particle size of Pt islands, thus ensuring sufficient active areas of Pt NPs for hydrogen evolution, as well as maximum light transmittance. Sputter-Pt from the first step served as controllable growth seeds for PED-Pt to increase the active areas while maintaining uniform size and dispersion. With maximum light transmission, the high HER catalytic activity of Pt NPs resulting from the increased active areas eventually improved the fill factor from 10% to 34.6% (Fig. 2a). Pt sputtering has been realized on many semiconductors, while PED could be easily realized by photo-electrons under illumination. Therefore, this two-step platinization method offers the possibility to control the size and distribution of Pt NPs in many other photocathodes to improve their PEC performance.
2.3 Passivation of CdS/TiO2 interfacial defects by an Al2O3 layer
Even though well-controlled S-P-Pt catalysts provide increased active areas for better HER catalytic activity, CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt still exhibits a modest fill factor of 34.6% in neutral electrolyte. To date, the highest fill factor among CIGS/CdS/TiO2 based photocathodes for PEC water reduction is no higher than 40%, even in strongly acidic electrolytes.3 On the other hand, the typical carrier lifetime of CIGS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO solar cells is around 50 ns,47 whereas the lifetime of our CIGS/CdS/TiO2 electrode is only ∼29 ns, obtained from time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy (blue trace in Fig. 3a, Table 1). The smaller fill factor and shorter carrier lifetime of CIGS/CdS/TiO2 compared to its solar cell counterparts indicate the existence of defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface, which have been noticed in QDSCs,35,48 but are rarely considered in PEC cathodes.3,4 These interfacial defects would cause undesired recombination and limit the electron transport.49 Al2O3 has been demonstrated as an excellent passivation layer for photoelectrodes and solar cells to reduce defects at the electrode–electrolyte junction50,51 or p–n junction interfaces,36 where a significant band bending is established to facilitate electron transfer. Herein, we introduce an ALD-grown Al2O3 layer between CIGS/CdS p–n junction and the protective TiO2 layer to passivate the interfacial defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface where the conduction band offset is only 0.2 eV, without blocking electron transfer.

An ultrathin Al2O3 film (5 ALD cycles, 0.5 nm) was deposited on CIGS/CdS by ALD at 150 °C before TiO2 deposition. The thickness of CdS/TiO2 on CIGS remained ∼68 nm with or without the Al2O3 layer (Fig. S6, ESI†) because it was ultrathin (0.5 nm). The CdS/Al2O3/TiO2 structure was examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) (Fig. S7, ESI†). The ALD-grown Al2O3/TiO2 layer formed a compact coating on CdS with a thickness of 18 nm (Fig. S7g, ESI†). Ti and O were uniformly distributed outside Cd and S (Fig. S7b–e, ESI†), while the Al signal was sparsely scattered (Fig. S7f, ESI†) due to its small amount. From the line scan (Fig. S7h, ESI†), it was observed that the trace Al signal started to appear at the CdS/TiO2 interface along the scan route (arrow in the inset of Fig. S7h, ESI†). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further confirmed the coating of Al2O3 on CdS, where a peak at 74.4 eV was assigned to Al 2p of Al2O3 (Fig. S8b, ESI†).52
To verify the passivation effect of the Al2O3 layer, we conducted steady-state PL spectroscopy to characterize the degree of charge recombination.53 The PL peaks appeared at about 500 nm, which corresponds to the bandgap of CdS.54 When a thin Al2O3 layer (0.5 nm) was inserted between CdS and TiO2, the PL intensity was largely quenched, indicating the passivation of defects (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, time-resolved PL spectroscopy was conducted to examine the carrier lifetime of CIGS/CdS/TiO2 and CIGS/CdS/Al2O3 (0.5 nm)/TiO2 (Fig. 3a). Upon Al2O3 passivation, PL decay was slowed down, illustrating the efficient suppression of interfacial recombination. Table 1 summarizes the carrier lifetime fitting results of CIGS/CdS/TiO2 and CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2 by biexponential components: a fast decay lifetime τ1, a slow decay lifetime τ2, and the total lifetime τ.47 The carrier lifetime was prolonged from 29.58 ns to 36.55 ns after Al2O3 insertion, indicating the well-passivated interface by the Al2O3 layer.
We further investigated the effect of Al2O3 passivation on PEC performance by transient photocurrent tests for CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt and CIGS/CdS/Al2O3 (0.5 nm)/TiO2/S-P-Pt at a constant bias of 0 VRHE in a phosphate buffered electrolyte while illumination was turned on and off (Fig. 3c). When light reached the samples, photogenerated electrons accumulated at the interfacial defects, giving rise to cathodic current spikes.51,55,56 Al2O3 modification greatly diminished the transient current spikes, owing to the decrease in recombination at the interface.53 In addition, improved charge transport upon Al2O3 passivation was observed in solid-state J–V tests (Fig. 3d),57 where CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2 samples with 2 and 5 cycles of Al2O3 exhibited larger slopes than CIGS/CdS/TiO2. When the Al2O3 thickness is greater than the tunneling thickness, electrodes exhibit increasing resistance because of the high resistivity of Al2O3. Moreover, Al2O3 thickness-dependent properties are also reflected in PEC J–V curves (Fig. S9, ESI†), in which 0.5 nm Al2O3 (5 cycles) results in the optimum performance.
The band diagrams of our photocathodes with or without interface passivation also revealed the effect of the Al2O3 layer during the PEC water reduction process (Fig. S10, ESI†). For both electrodes, photogenerated electrons could transfer from the CIGS/CdS junction to the electrolyte via the conduction band of TiO2, whereas hole diffusion outwards would be blocked due to the large valence-band offset between CdS and TiO2.35 However, for a photocathode without the Al2O3 insertion layer (Fig. S10a, ESI†), a substantial portion of photo-generated charge carriers would recombine at the CdS/TiO2 interfacial defects. Upon the introduction of Al2O3, interfacial defects were eliminated by the passivation effect, while the hole-blocking effect of Al2O3 also eliminated interfacial charge recombination, both of which facilitate electron transport (Fig. S10b, ESI†).
2.4 PEC hydrogen evolution and unassisted water splitting by optimized CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt photocathode
After accelerating the surface reaction by the two-step platinization method and optimizing the CdS/TiO2 interface via Al2O3 passivation, we obtained an optimized CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt photocathode (Fig. 4a). With the same S-P-Pt loading amount, we compared the PEC performance of three CIGS/CdS/X/S-P-Pt electrodes, where X refers to no overlayer, TiO2 overlayer, or Al2O3/TiO2 overlayers (Fig. 4b). Comparing CIGS/CdS/S-P-Pt with CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt, the TiO2 overlayer improved Von from 0.5 to 0.6 VRHE and photocurrent from 14 to 26 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE in neutral electrolyte (1 M phosphate solution, pH 6.8), reaching a fill factor of 34.6%. Upon Al2O3 passivation, the electrode achieved a more positive onset potential of 0.63 VRHE and a higher fill factor of 40.5%. This is the highest fill factor for TiO2 coated chalcopyrite photocathodes (Table S2, ESI†). The corresponding ABPE after Al2O3 modification was promoted from 5.4% to 6.6% (Fig. 4c). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) was measured at 0 VRHE (Fig. S11a, ESI†), where CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt and CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt exhibited much higher IPCE values than CIGS/CdS/S-P-Pt, reaching nearly 90% at around 700 nm. By integrating the IPCE over the standard AM 1.5G spectrum (Fig. S12, ESI†), photocurrent densities of 28 and 30 mA cm−2 at 0 VRHE were obtained for CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt and CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt, respectively, which is consistent with the values obtained from PEC J–V measurements (Fig. 4b).

(b) J–V curves and (c) corresponding ABPE curves for CIGS/CdS/S-P-Pt, CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt, and CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt photocathodes.

The Al2O3 thickness is 0.5 nm (5 ALD cycles). 
The stability of the electrodes in operational conditions is another key parameter for PEC water spitting. The CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt exhibited a robust photocurrent density over an 8 h stability test with only a 4.5% drop (red trace in Fig. 4d) and the surface morphology of the electrode was nearly intact before and after the reaction (Fig. S13d and e, ESI†), while the photocurrent density of CIGS/CdS/TiO2/S-P-Pt electrode decreased by 14% after 8 h (orange trace in Fig. 4d). The introduction of an ALD-grown Al2O3 interlayer could serve as a bonding layer that facilitates the nucleation of TiO2 in the following ALD process, improving the uniformity of TiO236 and thus increasing the stability of the photocathode. In contrast, electrodes without the Al2O3/TiO2 layer showed a fast degradation of photocurrent (blue trace in Fig. 4d) and serious damage to the CdS layer (Fig. S13a and b, ESI†). Raman spectra before and after stability tests also verified the same stability improvement, where CIGS/CdS/S-P-Pt exhibited an obviously reduced CdS signal (Fig. S13c, ESI†), while CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt retained the similar CdS peak intensity (Fig. S13f, ESI†), illustrating the excellent protective effect of ALD-grown Al2O3/TiO2 layer.58 In addition, the gas production of the CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt electrode at 0 VRHE under AM 1.5G irradiation was analyzed (Fig. S11b, ESI†). The overall Faradaic efficiency for H2 within 2.5 h was higher than 95%, indicating that most of the photogenerated charges were consumed for HER. Additionally, the electrode exhibited a fast and robust H2 bubble evolution with facile bubble detachment, where bubble accumulation was not observed on the electrode surface (ESI†).
It is worth noting that in order to inhibit the formation of a pH gradient, a strongly acidic electrolyte is preferable for practical long-term water splitting.59,60 Hence, our optimized electrode was tested in an extremely acidic environment using 1 M HClO4 as the electrolyte (pH 0). The CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt photocathode showed a great fill factor of 54.7% (Fig. 5a and Table S2, ESI†), achieving an unprecedented ABPE value of 9.3% (Fig. 5b). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest ABPE among chalcopyrite-based photocathodes (Fig. S14 and Table S2, ESI†), and an outstanding performance among thin film photocathodes composed of other materials (Table S3, ESI†). With the protection of the ALD Al2O3/TiO2 layer, this CIGS photocathode exhibited a high stability for continuous 2 h operation in HClO4 with only a 6% photocurrent drop (Fig. 5c), outperforming previous chalcopyrite-based photocathodes in strongly acidic conditions (Fig. S14 and Table S2, ESI†).3,61

Finally, unassisted overall solar water splitting was demonstrated with a PEC tandem cell composed of the CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt photocathode and a BiVO4/NiOOH/FeOOH62 photoanode. The J–V curves of BiVO4 and CIGS (behind BiVO4) were conducted in a three-electrode configuration respectively, where a theoretical photocurrent of 1.05 mA cm−2 was expected from the intersection of the two J–V curves (Fig. 6a). The two electrodes were connected in series without external bias, while light was shone from the BiVO4 side (inset of Fig. 6b). An actual photocurrent of 0.82 mA cm−2 was obtained with the unbiased two-electrode configuration (Fig. 6b), which was smaller than the estimated value of 1.05 mA cm−2. This difference may come from polarization losses.63,64 The STH efficiency calculated from the unassisted two-electrode photocurrent was 1.01%. The decrease in the photocurrent is likely due to the mass transfer issue when two electrodes are working in the same PEC cell.59 A future outlook should be focused on the design of a PEC tandem cell that is free of mass transfer and polarization losses.

3. Conclusion
In conclusion, we demonstrated a CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt photocathode for efficient and robust PEC hydrogen production. An original two-step platinization approach was developed to realize fine control of spatial dispersion and particle size of Pt islands, thus enhancing HER catalytic activity while maintaining the maximum light transmittance. Furthermore, defects present at the CdS/TiO2 interface were passivated by an ultrathin Al2O3 insertion layer. The resultant photocathode achieved a high ABPE of 6.6% in neutral electrolyte and a record-breaking ABPE of 9.3% in strongly acidic electrolyte. More importantly, this photocathode showed a remarkably robust photocurrent duration of 8 h and 2 h in neutral and acid solution, respectively, standing out among the chalcopyrite-based electrodes. A CIGS-BiVO4 PEC tandem cell was constructed, achieving an STH conversion efficiency of 1.01% without external bias. The engineering of the surface reaction and interface optimization in this work provides new strategies for the fabrication of state-of-the-art photoelectrodes for efficient solar water splitting.
4. Experimental section
4.1 Materials
Cadmium acetate (Cd(CHCOO)2), thiourea (SC(NH2)2), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, ≥99.0%) and ammonium hydroxide (GR, 25.0%) were purchased from Tianjin Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. Sodium dihydrogen phosphate (NaH2PO4, ≥99.0%). Sodium phosphate dibasic (Na2HPO4, ≥99.5%), and sodium sulfate (NaSO4, ≥99.0%) were purchased from J&K scientific Ltd. Trimethylaluminum (TMA, 99.999%) and titanium(IV) i-propoxide (TTIP, 99.999%) were purchased from Suzhou Fornano Electronics Technology Co. Ltd. High purity water (18.25 MΩ cm) supplied by a UP Water Purification System was used in all the experimental processes.
4.2 CIGS layers
CIGS layers were grown by co-evaporation onto molybdenum back contact which was deposited on clean glass substrates by sputtering. The co-evaporation chamber was equipped with four separate cells for elemental Cu, In, Ga and Se. The substrate temperatures were 350 °C, 450 °C and 450 °C during three deposition stages, respectively.
4.3 Synthesis of CIGS/CdS junction
The CdS buffer layer was deposited by a chemical bath deposition method. The aqueous solution A containing 7.5 mM Cd(CHCOO)2, 0.375 M SC(NH2)2, and 2 M NH4OH was used as the bath solution. The aqueous solution B containing 7.5 mM Cd(CHCOO)2 and 2 M NH4OH was used as the Cd2+ partial-electrolytic treatment solution. Prior to CdS deposition, the CIGS thin film was soaked in solution B at 60 °C for 10 min. In this step, it was noted that the presence of ammonia in solution B bath enabled the cleaning of the absorber surface before CdS layer deposition.65 Then, the surface treated CIGS thin film was dipped in solution A at 60 °C for 6 min. After deposition, the film was rinsed with high purity water and dried under N2 flow.
4.4 Modification with the composite Al2O3/TiO2 overlayer
The composite Al2O3/TiO2 overlayer was deposited at 150 °C by atomic layer deposition. Firstly, Al2O3 was deposited onto the surface of CIGS/CdS using TMA and H2O as precursors, which were both held at 25 °C. One ALD cycle consists of TMA dosing for 0.05 s, N2 purge for 10 s, water dose for 0.1 s and N2 purge for 10 s. CIGS/CdS was coated with 2, 5, 10, 15 cycles of Al2O3, respectively. Afterwards, amorphous TiO2 was deposited onto CIGS/CdS/Al2O3 using TTIP and H2O as precursors, which were held at 50 °C and 25 °C, respectively. One ALD cycle consists of TTIP dose for 0.1 s, N2 purge for 8 s, water dose for 0.1 s and N2 purge for 8 s. CIGS/CdS/Al2O3 was coated with 700 cycles of TiO2. The ALD Al2O3 and ALD TiO2 growth on the Si(100) substrate was measured using a spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam M-2000).
4.5 Loading of Pt NPs
Pt cocatalyst was deposited via a two-step method. Firstly, Pt particles were deposited on CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2via DC magnetron sputtering with a working current of 10 mA for 15 s. During deposition, the samples were placed at the same distance from the Pt target in order to minimize the sample-to-sample variation in Pt particle size and coverage. After Pt sputtering, the electrodes were denoted as CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/Sputter-Pt. Then, a photo-assisted electrodeposition method was adopted to deposit larger Pt particles to increase the contact area between the cocatalyst and electrolyte. Basically, a three-electrode cell was used with CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/Sputter-Pt as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and Pt foil as the counter electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 1 mM H2PtCl6, and 0.1 M Na2SO4. Under light illumination, (simulated AM 1.5G), the electrode was conducted at a potential of −0.5 V versus Ag/AgCl until the saturation of photocurrent. Afterwards, the CIGS/CdS/Al2O3/TiO2/S-P-Pt photocathode was washed with high purity water and dried under N2 flow.
4.6 Characterization
The morphology and microstructure of the samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Hitachi S-4800, 5 kV) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2100F, 200 kV). For TEM characterization, the samples were scratched off from the substrates by a blade and ultrasonically dispersed in ethanol, dipped onto a copper grid with a lace carbon film and dried under ambient conditions. The transmission spectra of SLG/TiO2/Sputter-Pt samples were obtained on a SHIMADZU UV-2550 spectrophotometer. Raman spectra were recorded on a DXR Raman microscope with 532 nm as the excitation wavelength. PL spectra were obtained on a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Time-resolved PL spectroscopy was performed on a Fluorolog-3, HORIBA Jobin Yvon. The samples were excited at 400 nm, and the photoluminescence was monitored at 500 nm. The thickness of ALD Al2O3 and TiO2 were measured by the M-2000 spectroscopic ellipsometer (J. A. Woollam). XPS analysis of the samples was carried out on a Physical Electronics PHI 1600 ECSA system with an Al Kα X-ray source (E = 1486.6 eV). The binding energy was calibrated using the C 1s photoelectron peak at 284.6 eV as the reference.
To measure the light loss by the catalyst, the transmission spectra of SLG/20 nm TiO2/Sputter-Pt samples were obtained on a SHIMADZU UV-2550 spectrophotometer. To determine the mass of catalyst present on the sample, Pt was digested overnight in aqua regia solution and the resulting solution was diluted with high purity water, then the content was detected by ICP-OES (VISTA-MPX, Varian).
4.7 PEC measurements
PEC measurements were performed using a three-electrode configuration with a prepared electrode as the working electrode, saturated Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode, and a platinum foil (2 × 2 cm2) as the counter electrode. An aqueous solution containing 0.5 M Na2SO4, 1 M Na2HPO4 and 1 M NaH2PO4 (pH adjusted to 6.8 by NaOH adding) was employed as the electrolyte. The potentials obtained from each measurement were converted into values against the reversible hydrogen electrode, using the Nernst equation ERHE (V) = EAg/AgCl + 0.059 × pH + 0.197(1)
An electrochemical workstation (CompactStat.e20250, IVIUM) was used to measure the J–V curves, IPCE, EIS and chronoamperometry. J–V curves of samples were measured with a scan rate of 50 mV s−1 under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp (Beijing Perfectlight Technology Co. Ltd, LS-SXE300CUV) equipped with an AM 1.5G filter. The active geometric areas of the working electrode were calibrated using the Image J software.
The IPCE was measured under monochromatic irradiation from a 150 W Xe lamp (Zolix LSH-X150) equipped with a monochromator (Omni-λ 300) at 0 VRHE, according to the equation (2)where λ is the wavelength, I is the photocurrent density under monochromatic light, and P is the measured irradiance.
The applied bias photon-to-current efficiency (ABPE) of the photocathodes was calculated by using the J–V curves with an assumption of 100% Faradaic efficiency, according to the equation (3)where I is the photocurrent density (mA cm−2), Vb is the potential versus ideal counter electrode (V), and P is the incident illumination intensity (mW cm−2) (100 mW cm−2 in this work).
EIS measurement was conducted by applying an AC voltage amplitude of 10 mV within the frequency range from 10000 to 1 Hz in 1 M phosphate buffer electrolyte (pH 6.8) at 0 VRHE under simulated AM 1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2).
The fill factor (FF)29 is defined as the maximum power output (Jmp × Vmp) divided by the product of the open circuit voltage (Voc) and the short-circuit current density (Jsc). In this work, Voc is equal to Von, and Jsc is the photocurrent density at 0 VRHE. This value reflects the power output performance of an individual electrode. (4)
4.8 H2 measurement
H2 was collected and analyzed by an on-line gas chromatograph (GC2060, Shanghai RuiMin Electronics Group) with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) using He as the carrier gas. The Faradaic efficiency (FE) for the H2 product was calculated according to the equation

Broader context
Climate change and the ever-increasing energy demand continue to drive the clean-energy momentum. By converting solar energy into energy stored in chemical bonds, solar water splitting provides a carbon-neutral alternative to address energy and environmental issues. In view of their excellent light absorption, tunable band gaps, and sufficient photovoltage, chalcopyrite/CdS based thin film junctions have drawn great attention as promising photocathodes to drive the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of water splitting. An increasing number of investigations have focused on adopting protective layers and cocatalysts for chalcopyrite/CdS to improve its stability and surface reaction kinetics. However, satisfactory performance has not yet been obtained, primarily due to the uncontrollable deposition of surface HER cocatalysts as well as the considerable charge recombination at the interface between CdS and protective layers. Using Cu(In,Ga)Se2/CdS as a prototype, we have demonstrated a two-step platinization strategy to independently control the size and dispersion of Pt cocatalysts towards faster surface reaction. Moreover, the Al2O3 interlayer was adopted to passivate the defects at the CdS/TiO2 interface for improved charge transfer. The resultant photocathode achieved an efficiency of 9.3% in acidic electrolyte and realized unassisted water splitting with the BiVO4 photoanode. This paper presents new insights into controlling the surface and interfacial properties of heterojunction photoelectrodes.
