    , Accepted 6th January 2021First published on 6th January 2021AbstractMany materials have been explored as a counter electrode material to replace platinum electrode in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). In this work, CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy composites at two different compositions, namely, CNM10, CNM25 were synthesized via hydrothermal method. The XRD, FE-SEM, and EDX analysis of the samples confirmed the formation of CNM10 and CNM25 composites. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) study of CNM10 and CNM25 electrodes showed faster triiodide ion reduction at the electrode/electrolyte interface than the Pt electrode. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy studies of CNM10 and CNM25 electrodes showed lower RCT values for both CNM10 and CNM25 electrodes than that of a Pt electrode. Tafel polarization measurement showed a higher limiting current value of CNM25 followed by CNM10 and Pt electrodes. Based on these studies, DSSCs were fabricated using CNM10, CNM25, and Pt CE. CNM25 CE showed an enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) (7.8%) with VOC of 824 mV, and JSC of 15.7 mA cm−2, whereas, Pt CE showed PCE of 6.5% with VOC of 775 mV and JSC of 13.2 mA cm−2.
1. Introduction
In recent years, much attention has been paid to low-cost dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) following the initial study by Grätzel and O'Regan in 1991.1 DSSCs consist of the following components (i) TiO2 film as a photoanode, (ii) a dye that acts as a light sensitizer, (iii) a liquid electrolyte and (iv) a counter electrode (CE). The counter electrode participates in the reduction of triiodide ion into iodide ion (I3− + 2e− → 3I−) at the liquid electrolyte/CE interface by adsorption of one molecule of iodine (I2) producing two surface iodine atoms which then produce solvated iodide ions that help to regenerate the oxidized dye molecule.2 The role of the CEs in DSSC is to collect electrons from the external circuit to promote the reduction of triiodide ions. The significant criteria for efficient counter electrode materials are as follows: the energy levels of CE material should match with the potential of the liquid electrolyte, it should possess high electrocatalytic activity, high conductivity, high reflectivity, high surface area, porous nature, chemical, electrochemical stability, chemical corrosion resistance, good adhesivity to the Fluorine doped Tin Oxide (FTO) glass plate, and significantly low-cost.3–5 However, it is is difficult to satisfy all the above-mentioned criteria with one material. In the conventional DSSCs, the Pt electrode is a commonly used counter electrode due to its superior electrocatalytic property.6 However, the main disadvantage of Pt electrode as a counter electrode is its corrosiveness toward the iodine liquid electrolyte.4 So, it is important to replace the Pt electrode in DSSCs to make the device fabrication process simple and economical. Among the reported alternative materials to replace Pt electrodes, binary transition metal sulphides, such as CoS2, MoS2, NiS2, etc.,7–18 have been considered as promising electrode materials because they are abundant, low-cost, and possess a good electrocatalytic property. Moreover, the electrocatalytic property of the material can be improved by preparing composites of transition metal sulphides by introducing nanointerface and synergistic interactions between them.19 The search for alternative counter electrode materials further is extended by considering ternary transition metal sulphides as promising alternatives to Pt because of their excellent redox reversibility, higher electrical conductivity, and good capacitance than mono transition metal sulphides.20 The existence of two different cations in a single crystal structure gives way for enriching redox reactions which ensure that it is a promising electrode in DSSCs.21 In this regard, the bimetallic sulphide NiCo2S4 has gained much attention due to the co-existence of two metal ions in a single crystal structure which induces better electrocatalytic property and conductivity due to synergistic effect.22–26 This makes them ideal cost-effective counter electrode material to replace Pt electrode in DSSCs. Jiang et al. achieved the best power conversion efficiency of 9.49% by using NiCo2S4 bimetallic sulphide as a counter electrode.27 When two or more metal sulphides are in contact, the interfacial interaction between the materials is believed to improve the catalytic property of the material and in this way, one can achieve the better electrocatalytic property of the materials28 with relatively low-cost precursor materials. It is worth mentioning here that the preparation of pure phases of cobalt and nickel sulphides is a challenging task since they exhibit non-stoichiometric compositions.12,13,29–31 However, the different phases of cobalt sulphides such as CoS, CoS2, Co3S4, Co8S9 were successfully employed as counter electrode materials to replace the conventional Pt electrode in DSSCs. In the same way, the different phases of nickel sulphides including NiS2,13,19 NiS22 and Ni3S4 CEs29 showed comparable PCE to the Pt CE in DSSCs.
Based on these concepts, in this work, a one-step hydrothermal synthesis of mixed-phase CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy composites was attempted for use as a counter electrode material in dye-sensitized solar cells and compared with the performance of a Pt electrode. The non-stoichiometric ratio of precursors was employed following our previous work.29 The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy revealed the presence of CoS, NiCo2S4 phases along with CoS2, Ni3S4, MoS2 in the sample. In electrochemical investigations, the lower RCT values obtained from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) measurements and lower peak-to-peak potential values obtained from the cyclic voltammetry (CV) experiments confirmed better electrocatalytic properties of the mixed-phase CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy composites comparing to the conventional Pt electrode due to the existence of different phases of cobalt and nickel sulphides along with MoS2 which offers synergistic effect at their interfaces.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy composites
The synthetic procedure of CoS2/Ni3S4/MoS2 composites is described below. First, cobalt nitrate hexahydrate (15 mmol), nickel nitrate hexahydrate (10 wt%), and hexaammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (10 wt%) was dissolved in DI water and the solution was kept under stirring for 30 min. Afterward, thiourea (160 mmol) was added to the solution mixture and stirred for another 30 min to obtain a homogeneous solution. This solution mixture was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave and kept at 160 °C in a hot air oven for 24 h. Then, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature. The obtained product was collected, washed with deionized water and ethanol several times, and finally dried at room temperature overnight. The same procedure was repeated with 25 wt% of both nickel and molybdenum precursors. From now, the sample codes to be followed are CNM10 for 10 wt% Ni, Mo precursors, and CNM25 for 25 wt% Ni, Mo precursors. The detailed fabrication procedure of the counter electrodes and DSSCs are given in the ESI.†
3. Results and discussion
The CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy composites have been synthesized by a simple one-step hydrothermal method (the experimental details are given in the ESI†). The non-stoichiometric ratio of cobalt and nickel to thiourea precursors and non-stoichiometric nature of both cobalt and sulphides favour the existence of the other phases of cobalt and nickel along with CoS2, Ni3S4, MoS2, the following are considered as the possible reactions15,29,32 leading to the formation of products: SC(NH2)2 + 2H2O → 2NH3 + CO2 + H2S(1) 2SH− + OH− → S2− + H2O(2) Co2+ + 4NH3 → [Co(NH3)4]2+(3) Ni2+ + 6NH3 → [Ni(NH3)6]2+(4) (NH4)6Mo7O24 + 4H2O → 7MoO42− + 6NH4+ + 8H+(5) 4[Co(NH3)4]2+ + 4[Ni(NH3)6]2+ + MoO42− + 14S2− → CoS2 + CoS + Ni3S4 + NiCo2S4 + MoS2 + SO42− + 40NH3(6)
The crystal structure and phase purity of the as-synthesized mixed-phase CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy composites were analyzed by XRD. The XRD pattern of CNM10 sample showed the presence of various phases of CoS2, Ni3S4, and MoS2 (Fig. 1(a)). The peaks corresponding to 2θ values at 27.7°, 32.1°, 36°, 46.1° and 54.8° are attributed to the planes of (1 1 1), (2 0 0), (2 2 0), (3 1 1) of CoS2 (JCPDS card no. 65-3322), respectively. This represents the formation of CoS2 which belongs to the cubic crystal structure with the lattice parameters a = b = c = 5.53 Å and α = β = γ = 90°. The peaks at 26.7°, 38.2°, 47° correspond to the planes of (0 2 2), (0 0 4), (2 2 4) of Ni3S4 (JCPDS card no. 043-1469) with the cubic crystal system a = b = c = 9.47 Å. The peaks at 39.5° and 60.1° represent the (1 0 3), (0 0 8) planes of hexagonal crystal system of MoS2 with the lattice parameters a = b = 3.16 Å, c = 12.29 Å (JCPDS card no. 00-037-1492). In addition to this, the peaks at 30.8°, 35.3° are attributed to the planes of (1 0 0), (1 0 1), and represent the existence of the CoS phase in the sample. Further, the peaks observed at 31.5°, 50.3° represent the planes (3 1 1), (5 1 1) of the cubic system of NiCo2S4 with the lattice parameters a = b = c = 9.38 Å (JCPDS card no. 00-020-0782). The XRD pattern of CNM25 is depicted in Fig. 1(b) which also shows the presence of CoS2, Ni3S4, and MoS2 phases in the sample. The co-existence of the other phase of cobalt such as CoS has also been noticed. Besides, the presence of ternary phase of the nickel and cobalt sulphides NiCo2S4 (or it might be CoNi2S4 because the peaks at 31.42° and 50.46° in the XRD pattern can be assigned to NiCo2S4 (JCPDS card no. 00-020-0782) or CoNi2S4 (JCPDS card no. 00-024-0334) as both shows similar diffraction peaks and represent the cubic crystal system) can also be seen in the XRD pattern of CNM25. The existence of other phases is mainly due to the non-stoichiometric ratio of the metal to sulphur sources and the non-stoichiometric nature of both cobalt and nickel sulphides. Here, the presence of a particular phase of cobalt and nickel sulphides has been considered based on the XRD peak intensity. The presence of ternary sulphide in the sample can offer richer redox activity24 than the binary sulphides which are favourable in the triiodide reduction reaction.

The morphological studies of the synthesized materials were explored by FE-SEM analysis. Fig. 2(a) and (b) represent the FE-SEM images of CNM10. Fig. 2(a) looks flower-like morphology along with broken cubes. The 100 nm resolution of CNM10 shown in Fig. 2(b) represents the closer view of the flower-like morphology of the CNM10. The FE-SEM image of CNM10 has been compared with the FE-SEM images of pristine CoS2, MoS2, Ni3S4, at the same magnification (1 μm), which show that the morphological features are matching well with the individual metal sulphides (Fig. S1a–d, ESI†)29 further supporting the formation of the CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy composites. The FE-SEM image of CNM25 in Fig. 2(c) and its magnified 100 nm resolution image (Fig. 2(d)) show 3D flower-like morphology which illustrates that even at the higher concentration of Ni and Mo precursors, the morphology of the samples is retained. It is worth to note that the morphology of the samples highly depends upon the reaction time, solvent employed, reaction temperature, thiourea concentration used in the reaction mixture32 and the pH of the reaction mixture.33 In CNM10, the low concentration of both nickel and molybdenum in the reaction mixture helped somewhat to retain the morphology of the cobalt sulphide which is evidenced from the morphological studies. However, when the concentrations of nickel and molybdenum were increased under the same reaction conditions, the morphology of the sample resulted in a 3D flower-like morphology as shown in Fig. 2(c) and (d).

The morphology of the CNM10 and CNM25 was further characterized by TEM analysis. TEM image of CNM10 (Fig. 3(a)) looks like broken petals-like morphology which illustrates flower morphology seen under SEM image are broken during TEM sample preparation. Fig. 3(b) represents the HR-TEM of CNM10 showing the reflection of CoS2 with the plane (2 0 0), CoS with the plane (1 0 0) Ni3S4 with the plane (0 2 2), NiCo2S4 with the plane (3 1 1), and MoS2 with the plane (1 0 3). In the same way, the reflections belong to CoS2 with the plane (1 1 1), Ni3S4 with the plane (0 2 2), NiCo2S4 with the plane (5 1 1), CoS with the plane (1 0 1), and MoS2 with the plane (1 0 3) have been identified in CNM25 and it has been indexed in Fig. 4(b). The d spacing values obtained from the HR-TEM images of both CNM10 (Fig. 3(b)) and CNM25 (Fig. 4(b)) samples are in accordance with the XRD pattern of the respective samples. The EDX analysis of both CNM10 (Fig. 3(d)) and CNM25 (Fig. 4(d)) reveals the increase in the atomic% of both Ni and Mo elements in CNM25 than in the CNM10 sample. The calculated atomic ratio from the EDX did not match with the chemical composition of the CNM10 and CNM25. The difference in the metal(s) to sulphur ratio is mainly due to the existence of the mixed-phases of the cobalt, nickel, and molybdenum sulphides.34Fig. 4(a) shows the dense solid-like morphology of CNM25 and Fig. 4(e)–(h) represents the elemental mapping of the same which shows uniform distribution of the elements Co, Ni, Mo, S.

The SAED (Selected Area Electron Diffraction) is a powerful tool to determine the crystalline nature of the sample. Fig. 3(c) and 4(c) represent the diffraction pattern of the polycrystalline nature of the CNM10 and CNM25 resulted from the diffraction of the different crystal structures of CoS2, Ni3S4, CoS, NiCo2S4, MoS2 which is also highly supported by the XRD pattern of the respective samples. Fig. 3(e)–(h). Fig. 4(e)–(h) shows the elemental mapping distribution of the Co, Ni, Mo, and S.
As the XRD pattern of both CNM10 and CNM25 show mixed-phases of cobalt and nickel sulphides which involve various oxidation states of the corresponding metals, the surface electronic states of the elements present in the sample (CNM25) were analyzed by XPS technique, and the corresponding spectra are shown in Fig. 5. All the peaks corresponding to Co, Ni, Mo, S, C elements are shown in the survey spectrum of CNM25 (Fig. 5(a)). The peaks found at 778.1, 781.3 eV (Fig. 5(b)) are mainly due to the contribution of Co-S bond in Co9S8 phase.35 Further, the peaks at 797.4, 794.2 eV confirms the oxidation state +2 and +3 of cobalt present in the sample. The peaks 778.1, 781.3, 797.4, 794.2 eV are attributed to the Co 2p3/2 and Co 2p1/2 orbitals. The Ni 2p spectrum (Fig. 5(c)) shows peaks at 853.2, 854.4, 856.8 eV corresponding to the NiS, Ni3S4, NiS2,36 respectively, in the sample. Moreover, the observed peaks at 871.1, 874.7 eV are due to the presence of Ni2+37 in the sample. The Mo spectrum (Fig. 5(d)) shows the peaks at 228.7, 231.5, 232.6, 234.6 eV are attributed to the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 corresponds to the +4 oxidation state of Mo present in the sample. The peak at 226 eV suggests +2 oxidation state of Mo in the sample.38 Further, the peak present at 235.2 eV suggests +6 oxidation state of Mo due to the presence of Mo-O bond. Overall, the XPS study confirms the existence of cobalt in +2, +3 (Co2+/Co3+) oxidation states, nickel (Ni2+/Ni3+) in +2, +3 oxidation states, and molybdenum (Mo2+, Mo4+, Mo6+) in +2, +4, +6 oxidation states, strongly supporting the formation of mixed-phase of CNM sample. The S 2p spectrum (Fig. 5(e)) shows peaks at 161.7, 162.9 eV which are attributed to the S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively. The binding energy at 161.7 eV confirms the presence of the metal to sulphur bond in the sample. The peak at 168.7 eV suggests the presence of S-O bond in the S 2p spectrum.16

The electrocatalytic activity of the CEs plays a key role to reduce the I3− ion in the iodine/iodide liquid electrolyte. CV study is an excellent electrochemical tool to investigate the electrocatalytic property of the electrode material. The CVs of Pt, CNM10, and CNM25 electrodes are shown in Fig. 6(a). The ability of the electrode material to participate in the redox reaction to reduce the liquid electrolyte shows a pair of oxidation and reduction peaks. The Epp (peak-to-peak separation) value and the peak current value are the crucial parameters to determine the electrocatalytic activity of the electrodes The oxidized dye molecule gets regenerated during the oxidation of I− ions into I3− (3I− → I3− + 2e−, 2I3− → 3I2 + 2e−) and the I3− ion gets reduced by the counter electrode (3I2 + 2e− → 2I3−, I3− + 2e− → 3I−).
 Fig. 6  (a) CVs, (b) Nyquist plots (equivalent circuit inset), (c) Tafel plots, (d) Zoomed portion of Tafel plots of Pt, CNM10, CNM25 electrodes, respectively. 
From the CV plots of Pt, CNM10, and CNM25 (depicted in Fig. 6(a)), the Pt electrode shows the highest peak current density compared to CNM10 and CNM25 due to the high conductivity of the Pt metal. The overpotential of the reduction reaction (which is represented by the Epp values) follows the order of Pt (482 mV) > CNM10 (426 mV) > CNM25 (404 mV) suggesting the faster reduction of I3− ions in the liquid electrolyte by the CNM25 compared to other electrodes.
The EIS of dummy cells (electrode/electrolyte/electrode) was performed to further investigate the charge transfer kinetics at the electrode/electrolyte interface. The Nyquist plots of Pt, CNM10, and CNM25 electrodes are shown in Fig. 6(b) (the equivalent circuit of the same has been shown in the inset). In the equivalent circuit, R1 represents the series resistance RS, and R2 represents the charge transfer resistance RCT. The series resistance RS corresponds to the transport resistance of the conductive substrate that can be measured from the intercept on the real axis in the high-frequency region of the Nyquist plot. The RCT represents the diameter of the right circle (interface of electrode/electrolyte) of the Nyquist plot and the semicircle on the low-frequency region represents the Warburg diffusion impedance (Z). The values of electrochemical parameters RS, RCT, and Epp obtained from the EIS measurement are summarized in Table 1. The RS values of the electrode follow the order of Pt (4.98 Ω cm−2) < CNM10 (6.62 Ω cm−2) < CNM25 (16.36 Ω cm−2) suggesting the superior electrical conductivity of the Pt electrode which resulted in the slight increase in the photovoltaic parameter FF (fill factor) value of the Pt CE (0.54) compared to CNM10 (0.47) and CNM25 (0.51). The fabricated dummy cell with CNM10 shows a lower RCT value of 12.12 Ω cm−2 upon compared to CNM25 (35.9 Ω cm−2) and Pt (86.82 Ω cm−2) suggests it has better electrocatalytic activity toward the liquid iodide/triiodide electrolyte. The constant phase element (CPE) reflects the electron density according to the following equation39 (7)where e is the elementary charge, k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature and N is the electron density. The highest CPE value has been observed for the CNM25 electrode (36.72 μF) comparing to the CNM10 electrode (12.19 μF) and Pt electrode (9.43 μF). By using eqn (7), the corresponding electron density value can be estimated. As a result, the CNM25 electrode exhibits a higher N value of 5.92 × 1012 cm−3 when compared to the CNM10 (1.97 × 1012 cm−3) and the reference Pt (1.52 × 1012 cm−3) electrodes. This finding suggests lower recombination kinetics for the DSSC with CNM25 compared to the other CEs. It should be noted that reduced recombination processes within the device lead to an increase of the energy difference between the quasi-Fermi levels in the solar cell and, therefore, higher open-circuit voltage (VOC). Additionally, a higher N value indicates a larger amount of charge carriers accumulated in the device and, therefore, a higher value of the photocurrent.

The charge transfer kinetics of the electrolyte/electrode interface can be studied with the help of the Tafel plot (Fig. 6(c) and (d)). The I−/I3− ion transport at the high potential zone of the CNM25 electrode seems comparable with the Pt electrode. Moreover, a slight increase in the limiting current density (logJlim) has been observed for the CNM25 electrode which connects the catalytic activity of the electrodes. The tangent slope of both Pt and CNM10 electrodes are comparable. The correlation between this exchange current density and RCT is given by the equation40 (8)where R is gas constant (8.314 J mol−1 K−1), T is the temperature (298 K), F is Faraday constant (96500 C mol−1), n is the number of electrons exchanged in the electrochemical reaction at the electrolyte–electrode interface and RCT represents the charge transfer resistance. From this eqn (8), as the RCT value is inversely proportional to the J0 value, the exchange current density J0 for both CNM10 and CNM25 exhibit higher than the Pt electrode which resulted from the lower RCT values of both the electrodes (refer Table 1).
DSSCs were fabricated using Pt, CNM10 and CNM25 CEs adopting the device structure of FTO/TiO2/Dye (N3)/Liq. Electrolyte/Pt or CNM10 or CNM25. The photocurrent density as a function of the voltage for the fabricated devices has been recorded by FRA2 PGSTAT302N under 85 mW cm−2 sun illumination for a cell area of 0.25 cm2. Fig. 7(a) shows the J–V plots of the DSSCs fabricated with Pt, CNM10, and CNM25. Besides, the EIS analysis of the DSSCs fabricated with Pt, CNM10, and CNM25 was performed to study the kinetics of electron transfer between the TiO2 and the electrolyte. The EIS is carried out by applying a small modulated sine wave with a certain frequency range and the resulting current response is measured41 as a function of modulation frequency. From the recorded data, the Nyquist plot is plotted against the real impedance (Z′) vs imaginary impedance (−Z′′) in the complex plane and the Bode-Phase plot is plotted against the phase vs frequency. From the EIS study of the DSSC device, the resistive parameters at different interfaces such as CE/electrolyte, TiO2/dye/electrolyte can be estimated from the Nyquist plot and kinetic parameters can be estimated from the Bode-Phase plot. The EIS parameters of the DSSCs fabricated with Pt, CNM10, and CNM25 are given in Table 2 and the equivalent circuit is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the respective devices are given in Table 3.

In the Nyquist plot (Fig. 7(b)), RS represents the series resistance, RCT1 represents the charge transfer resistance at CE/electrolyte interface and RCT2 represents the recombination charge transfer resistance at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface respectively. The lower RS value of Pt CE (6.61 Ω cm−2) suggests the superior conductivity of the Pt CE compared to CNM10 and CNM25 CEs which showed 10.03 and 8.28 Ω cm−2 respectively. The efficiency of the conventional Pt CE shows PCE of 6.5% with VOC of 775 mV, JSC of 13.2 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.54. However, an increase in VOC values of CNM10 (820 mV) and CNM 25 (824 mV) have been observed mainly due to the suppressed dark current in the respective devices (Fig. S3, ESI†) compared to the Pt CE (775 mV). From Table 2, the CNM10 CE shows a higher RCT2 value of 22.94 Ω cm−2 due to reduced recombination of the electrons in TiO2 with the holes or positively charged species present in the electrolyte. The larger the RCT2 means higher the recombination resistance which resulted from the inhibited recombination reaction of the injected electron between the TiO2 and liquid electrolyte.42
The fast electron transport and reduction of triiodide ion in the device fabricated with CNM10 and CNM25 are resulted from the lower charge transfer resistance of the respective electrode due to the synergistic effect,43 improved interfacial contact44 of the existence of the CoS2, Ni3S4, and MoS2 along with CoS and NiCo2S4. An increase in electron lifetime of both the CNM10 (23.2 ms) and CNM25 (23.2 ms) further supports the reduced recombination reaction of electron and hole. This slow recombination reaction consequently increases the JSC of those CEs due to increased charge collection efficiency and the JSC follows the order Pt (13.2 mA cm−2) < CNM10 (15 mA cm−2) < CNM25 (15.7 mA cm−2). The counter electrode preparation processes significantly influence the catalytic property of the materials.6 Similarly, the preparation of the CE material and its deposition process is crucial for device performance. The high-temperature annealing process of the sample improves its crystallinity46 which also has an impact on the performance of the device. It is noteworthy to mention here that the preparation process involved high-temperature sulfurization or annealing of the sample under Ar atmosphere which has a significant impact on the performance of the CE.20,46 Likewise, the samples prepared by the simple hydrothermal approach and deposited by the drop-casting method show improved overall performance of the devices which resulted from the lower RCT and reduced Epp compared to the standard Pt electrode. This is also evidenced from Table 4 which shows the best photovoltaic performances of the composites MoS2/Co3S4,44 CoS/MoS2,45 NiS2/CoS2,20 MoS2 coated CoS2,16 Co3S4/MoS246 CEs due to the formation of synergistic effect at the interface obtained from the previous literature.

The frequency maxima obtained from the Bode-Phase plot is corresponding to the electron diffusion time constant at TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface. This characteristic diffusion time constant is related to the recombination electron lifetime which can be easily calculated using the formula τ = 1/2πf, where f represents the frequency maxima41 obtained from the Bode-phase plot of the device (Fig. 7(c)) measured under dark conditions. The electron lifetime of the devices fabricated with both Pt, CNM10, and CNM25 be 13.2, 23.2, and 23.2 ms, respectively. However, the device fabricated with both CNM10 and CNM25 CEs shows the enhanced photocurrent value of JSC with 15 and 15.7 mA cm−2 and overall efficiency performance of 6.8% and 7.8% comparing to Pt which shows JSC of 13.2 mA cm−2, PCE of 6.5% which is strongly supported by the electrochemical characterization of the respective electrodes. For comparison, the calculated integrated current density from the IPCE results for the CNM25 sample is found to be 15.7 mA cm−2 whereas the observed current density is also the same (15.7 mA cm−2). Similarly, for CNM10 and Pt electrodes the calculated (observed) current density is 15.2 (15) and 13.4 (13.2) mA cm−2 (Fig. S4, ESI†).
The relation between the VOC and the dark current density (Jdark) is given in the following equation43 (9)where γ is the ideality factor, JSC is short-circuited current and Jdark is the dark current density.
Furthermore, the external quantum efficiency (EQE – also referred to as the IPCE spectrum) of the devices are measured and depicted in Fig. 7(d). The details of the number of electrons generated in the external circuit by the incident light can be measured by EQE% spectrum and the formula16 is given by (10)
The increase in the photon-to-current conversion efficiency of the device is directly related to the EQE% value of the corresponding devices. The increase in EQE% has been witnessed for both CNM10 (32.5%) and CNM25 CE (36.2%) compared to Pt CE (29.6%), mainly due to the better photon to the electron conversion efficiency of the devices and the results are consistent with the overall performance of the corresponding devices.
4. Conclusions
In summary, mixed-phase CoxSy/NixSy/MoxSy composites were synthesized via a one-step hydrothermal process. CV, EIS, and Tafel polarization plots of the CNM10, and CNM25 electrode showed better electrocatalytic properties of CNM10 and CNM25 compared to that of Pt electrode on the reduction of I3− ions in the electrolyte. The overall best performance of the DSSCs fabricated with CNM25 CE showed the PCE of 7.8% with VOC of 824 mV, JSC of 15.7 mA cm−2, FF of 0.51 compared to Pt CE which showed PCE of 6.5% with VOC of 775 mV, JSC of 13.2 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.54. The enhanced performance of CNM25 CE compared to the CNM10 CE is due to the increase in VOC, JSC, and FF which resulted from the reduced recombination reaction and lower RS value of CNM25 CE. Further, the better photon-to-electron conversion efficiency of the CNM25 CE is well supported by an increase in EQE% of the corresponding device. Overall, this work has shown a simple yet effective route to utilize low-cost materials to prepare potential counter electrode material to replace the novel Pt metal CE in DSSCs.
