    , Accepted 25th March 2013First published on 26th March 2013AbstractA novel non-hydrazine precursor solution followed by dip-coating has been developed to produce Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) and Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) thin films. The precursor solution is based on an ethanol solution of metal–thioacetamide (TAA) complex with monoethanolamine (MEA) as the additive agent. By forming coordination complexes with TAA, metal cations are found to have good solubility in ethanol–MEA solvents, producing molecular-level blending in metal precursor solutions. All the materials are low-cost and environmentally friendly. The annealing treatments are conducted under vacuum and Se vapor to form CZTS and CZTSSe absorber films. A solar cell fabricated with the CZTSSe thin film exhibits power conversion efficiency of 5.36%, which is much higher than that (2.86%) of the cell using the CZTS thin film as absorber.
Introduction
Copper zinc tin sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) solar cells have recently emerged as attractive candidates,1–3 as they have similar structures and optical properties with copper indium gallium selenide (Cu(In,Ga)Se2, CIGS) cells. Moreover, Cu, Zn, Sn and S are some common elements that are naturally abundant, relatively cheap and environmentally benign. Currently, the major challenges are generally identified as controlling volatile species within the film and suppressing the formation of secondary phases.4 Conventional vacuum-based high-temperature approaches typically suffer from the high volatility of several elemental constituents as well as the narrow compositional stability window of the CZTS phase. Solution-based techniques traditionally have been associated with lower quality thin-film semiconductor devices. However, it has recently been shown that they can be competitive fabrication approaches, not only in terms of cost, but in terms of efficiency as well, as demonstrated at the early stage of development of kesterite Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) liquid-coating techniques.5
Recently, three approaches have yielded substantially higher efficiency from solution processes. In the first approach, a layer of inks containing CZTS nanocrystals is annealed in Se atmosphere to form CZTSSe.6 With optimization of the Cu/(Zn + Sn) and Zn/Sn ratios, this approach has yielded devices with 7.2% efficiency.7 Nanocrystal inks offer the advantage of dispersibility in organic solvents for coating, but their encapsulating organic ligands will leave behind carbon residues that hurt device performance.8 In the second approach, hydrazine-based slurries containing both soluble and particulate precursors have deposited the CZTSSe absorber directly, although binary chalcogenides must first be synthesized and then dispersed in hydrazine. This approach has yielded the highest efficiency of 10.1% for any CZTSSe fabrication process,9 and most recently this approach has set a new record up to 11%.10 However, the major drawback is the use of large amounts of hydrazine, which is explosive, hepatotoxic,11 and carcinogenic.12
In the third approach, a homogeneous solution was used to produce CZTSSe absorbers using fully dissolved CZTS precursor, followed by selenization treatment. Each of the elemental constituents can mix on a molecular scale in homogeneous solution. In contrast to nanocrystal inks and slurry-based process, the homogeneous solution precursors enable very precise stoichiometric control and eliminate the need for the long-range diffusion of precursors during the formation of the CZTS phase. At first, a pyridine-based solution was proposed for the synthesis of CZTS thin films, but pyridine is also a toxic solvent.13 Afterwards, CZTS thin films were synthesized by using dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-based and methanol-based solutions of Cu, Zn, Sn salts and thiourea.14,15 However, thiourea tends to form organic byproducts that are even present at relatively high annealing temperatures of 380 °C.16 In the methanol-based approach, the obtained film thickness is only around 450 nm,15 which is not suitable for using as the absorber layer of solar cells. More recently, a fully dissolved hydrazine-based precursor solution was used to process CZTSSe absorbers, which has yielded 8.08% efficient devices.17 This solution processing is based on a homogeneous CZTS precursor solution, similar to the hydrazine-based solution-processable precursors that have been demonstrated to produce high-quality CIGS films.18,19 This molecular-scale precursor solution has the unique advantages of (i) avoiding potential impurities such as C or O, (ii) precisely controlling the ratio of Cu/(Zn + Sn), and Zn/Sn, (iii) enhancing spatial uniformity in subsequently deposited films, (iv) forming homogeneous CZTS phase without the need for long-range diffusion between different precursor phases.17 However, there may still be obstacles in this method for practical applications because hydrazine is known to be a highly toxic and explosive chemical. And it is worth paying even more attention to the complexing agent hydrazinocarboxylic acid, used during the synthesis of zinc precursor, that was prepared by adding hydrazine to a vial containing excess solid-state carbon dioxide. This reaction between carbon dioxide and hydrazine is highly exothermic and the synthesized product has a corrosive effect on stainless steel. Therefore, this procedure must be highly cautious and can only be conducted in small scale.
Besides, our previous work has reported the synthesis of CZTS thin films by using an ethylene glycol-based transparent solution route.20 In spite of this, we still believe it is necessary to intensively develop and optimize CZTS-based technologies using non-toxic homogeneous solution routes. Here we present a novel solution-based dip-coating approach to process CZTS and CZTSSe absorbers using fully dissolved CZTS precursor complexes, in which each of the elemental constituents are mixed on a molecular scale. It is worth noting that ethanol is used as the solvent, which is non-toxic and would reduce carbon residue. Monoethanolamine (MEA) is adopted as the additive, known as a surfactant, which can improve the solubility and stability of inorganic salts in ethanol.21 Thioacetamide (TAA) is used as the sulfur source, which can decompose easily during the annealing treatment and minimize organic impurities of the material, which finally should lead to pure CZTS materials. The influence of vacuum and selenization annealing on the growth of CZTS and CZTSSe thin films was investigated. A schematic diagram of our solution-based routes for CZTS and CZTSSe thin films is shown in Fig. 1.

Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. The Mo-coated glass substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic water bath followed by an ultrasonic isopropanol bath, each for 20 min.
Synthesis of precursor complex solution
To form the copper precursor solution, CuCl2·2H2O (2.387 g, 14 m mol) and monoethanolamine (0.012 g, 0.2 mmol) were combined with ethanol (5 mL) at room temperature. Similarly, the zinc and tin precursor solutions were prepared in another two separate vessels, by mixing ZnCl2 (1.308 g, 9.6 mmol) and SnCl2·2H2O (1.805 g, 8 mmol) with monoethanolamine (0.012 g, 0.2 mmol) in ethanol (5 mL), respectively. When dropping zinc and tin precursor solution into copper precursor solution with constant stirring, the color of the ethanol solution changed from a deep green to milk-white. In the next step, thioacetamide (3.907 g, 0.052 mol) in ethanol (5 mL) was added to the above solution and stirred for 5 min. The color of the precursor solution changed from milk-white to transparent yellow. The ratio of Cu:Zn:Sn:S was kept in the appropriate range [Cu:(Zn + Sn):S = 0.8:1:3, and Zn:Sn = 1.2].
Synthesis of CZTS and CZTSSe thin films
CZTS and CZTSSe films were deposited via dip-coating from the as-prepared transparent precursor solution on Mo-coated soda-lime glass substrates. To reach the targeted thickness of the absorber layer, several successive layers were coated following an intermediate heat treatment at 130 °C in air for 10 min. A final annealing was conducted in a graphite box at 480 °C for 30 min under vacuum and Se vapor. After the heat treatment, the samples were cooled naturally to room temperature under inert atmosphere.
Device fabrication and characterization
The CZTS and CZTSSe absorber films were then processed into photovoltaic devices by chemical bath deposition of CdS (50 nm), RF magnetron sputtering of i-ZnO (50 nm), and indium-doped tin oxide (250 nm). A 110 nm thick MgF2 antireflection coating was deposited on top of the device by electron beam evaporation. Silver paint was applied to form the top contact. The area of CZTS and CZTSSe-based solar cell was 0.091 and 0.085 cm2, respectively. Photovoltaic devices were tested on a Karl Suss probe station and an Agilent 4156C parameter analyzer. J–V data and power conversion efficiencies were obtained using a Keithley 2400 General Purpose Sourcemeter and a xenon lamp solar simulator (Newport) with an AM 1.5 filter.
Materials characterization
The formation of TAA complex in the precursor solution was studied by using a Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer (Thermo, Nicolet 6700) and KBr disk method. The samples were made by dropping precursor solution onto the KBr disk under an infrared lamp. The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) profiles were measured with a German Bruker AXS D8 ADVANCE diffractometer (Cu Kα radiation, λ = 1.5405 Å). The Raman spectra were obtained by LabRam HR800, the wavelength of laser excitation for Raman measurements was 488 nm, and the laser power was ∼100 mW. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using an ESCALAB 250 XPS using an Al Kα (1486.6 eV) X-ray source. To exclude the influence from surface-absorbed oxygen and carbon, Ar+ ion (3 keV) etching for 3 min was performed before collecting the X-ray generated electrons. The morphologies and microstructures of the films were observed using a Hitach S4800 field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM). The composition ratio of the thin films was analyzed by energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) attached to the SEM. UV-Vis-NIR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-3101PC spectrophotometer at room temperature. Photovoltaic devices were tested on a Karl Suss probe station and an Agilent 4156C parameter analyzer. J–V data and power conversion efficiencies were obtained using a Keithley 2400 General Purpose Sourcemeter and a xenon lamp solar simulator (Newport) under AM1.5 (1000 W m−2) global illumination at 25 °C.
Results and discussion
CZTS thin film deposited by solution-based dip-coating route has been reported recently,15 in which methanol was used as the coating solvent. However, methanol is a polar solvent with low boiling point (64.7 °C), and is easily volatile and toxic. Most importantly, methanol has anesthetic effects and can hurt eyes, even causing blindness. Ethanol is another kind of polar solvent, which has good solubility of inorganic salts, a higher boiling point (78.5 °C) compared with methanol and low toxicity, and is stable and environmentally friendly. In our experiment, the tin, zinc and copper precursors are Sn(II), Zn(II) and Cu(II) chloride, respectively. Compared with other inorganic salts, such as sulfates, metal chlorides could be dissolved completely in ethanol. In the meantime, MEA, with a molecular formula of HOCH2CH2NH2, which is non-toxic, is adopted as the additive agent. On the one hand, MEA is known as a surfactant with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, which can improve the solubility and stability of inorganic salts in ethanol because of the coordination of –OH and –NH2 group with metal ions. It means that solvent of the same volume could dissolve a larger amount of the reactant, which is useful to increase the film thickness. In our study, a CZTS film with a thickness of around 1.45 μm is obtained by dip-coating four times from our ethanol coating solution. This is in contrast to CZTS films synthesized by using methanol as coating solvent,15 which are around 0.45 μm in thickness after dip coating for five times. On the other hand, MEA is an alkaline substance. It favors the decomposition of TAA into S2−, which is used as the sulfur source during the reaction (see eqn (1)): (1)
TAA is used as a sulfur source with the molecular formula of C2H5NS, which is also a coordinating agent. In the TAA molecule there are CS and –NH2 functional groups, which have a strong tendency to coordinate with inorganic cations. When mixing CuCl2, SnCl2 and ZnCl2 inorganic salts in ethanol, Cu2+ reacts with Sn2+ to form Cu+ and Sn4+. After adding TAA to the ethanol solution, Cu+, Sn4+ and Zn2+ can coordinate with TAA to form the precursor complex. It is worth noting that the structure of the ethanol-based precursor complex is not clear at present, we use [CuZnSn(TAA)n]m+ to represent the formation of the precursor complex in the ethanol solution. The possible formation mechanism of the ethanol-based CZTS precursor complex could be formulated as follows: (2) (3) (4) (5) [Cu(TAA)n]+ + [Zn(TAA)n]2+ + [Sn(TAA)n]4+ → [CuZnSn(TAA)n]m+(6)
The above formation mechanism of the ethanol-based CZTS precursor solution is proven by our experimental procedure. Precursor solutions were prepared from CuCl2 (Fig. 2a), ZnCl2 (Fig. 2b), SnCl2 (Fig. 2c) ethanol solution in the presence of MEA. After mixing the three ethanol solutions, a milk-white slurry system appeared (Fig. 2d). That is due to the fact that Sn2+ was oxidized to Sn4+ and Cu2+ was reduced to Cu+ in ethanol, corresponding to reaction (2). Note that the colors of Sn2+, Cu2+, Sn4+ and Cu+ ions in ethanol are colorless, bright green, white and colorless, respectively. When TAA was added to the above slurry system, the color of the precursor solution changed from milk-white to transparent yellow, as shown in Fig. 2e, which shows the formation of ethanol-based CZTS precursor complex solution, shown by eqn (6).

In our precursor solution system, TAA can coordinate with metal ions through not only the sulfur atom but also the nitrogen atom. FT-IR analysis of pure TAA, the three metal–TAA complexes and the precursor complex in the ethanol solvent were carried out. The band at 720 cm−1 in pure TAA solution (Fig. 3a) is assigned to CS stretching vibration. The bands at 1480 cm−1 and 1650 cm−1 should be related to coupled vibrations of C–N stretching and N–H bending, respectively. In the sample of Cu–TAA (Fig. 3b) and Sn–TAA (Fig. 3d) ethanol solution, those three bands undergo obvious red shifts. In the sample of Zn–TAA (Fig. 3c), the three bands shift a very small distance. The CS stretching band undergoes a red shift to 680 cm−1 in the spectrum of Cu–Zn–Sn–TAA precursor complex (Fig. 3e). It indicates that the bond order of CS in the precursor complex has been reduced. The other two bands of C–N stretching and N–H bending undergo a red shift and move to 1450 cm−1 and 1620 cm−1, respectively, in the spectrum of the Cu–Zn–Sn–TAA complex precursor. The shifts in the absorption bands indicate that TAA strongly interacts with metal ions through both the sulfur atom site and the nitrogen atom site. The FT-IR studies prove that the transparent precursor complex solution is formed by the interaction of metal ions with TAA via sulfur and nitrogen atoms.

The Mo-coated glass substrates were dip coated from the above transparent precursor solution, drying at 130 °C in air, resulting in shiny black films. During this drying process, the strong coordination bonds between the sulfur and nitrogen atoms and Cu+, Zn2+ and Sn4+ could weaken and further break the CS bond in the precursor complex. The appearance of a shiny black film indicated the formation of the CZTS precursor thin film. (Note: the CZTS precursor thin film will transform into the CZTS phase after annealing treatment. This CZTS precursor film may contain CuS, ZnS and some other metal sulfide, so we call it CZTS precursor film instead of CZTS phase here.) The obtained precursor films were then annealed under vacuum and Se vapor to form compacted CZTS and CZTSSe absorber films in a graphite box at 480 °C for 30 min. Moreover, a certain excess of TAA is necessary to compensate the loss of sulfur during pyrolysis in this experiment, which has been proven to be an effective method for the synthesis of chalcogenide compounds.13,22 In the precursor solution, the ratio of Cu:Zn:Sn:S was kept in the appropriate range [Cu:(Zn + Sn):S = 0.8:1:3, and Zn:Sn = 1.2].
The XRD patterns of the obtained CZTS precursor film after annealing under vacuum and a Se vapor environment at 480 °C for 30 min are shown in Fig. 4. The sample after annealing under vacuum (Fig. 4a) shows major diffraction peaks at 28.5°, 47.3° and 56.1°, which can be indexed to the (112), (220) and (312) of kesterite structure of Cu2ZnSnS4 (JCPDS no.26-0575), respectively. No noticeable impurities can be observed. The lattice parameters, a = b = 5.43 Å, c = 10.83 Å, calculated from the pattern, are in good agreement with the standard values for tetragonal CZTS. The average composition of the CZTS thin film is determined using energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) to be Cu:(Zn + Sn) = 0.82, and Zn:Sn = 1.28, suggesting that only a slight Sn loss occurred after the annealing treatment. This composition is within the range of compositions reported for CZTS films.23–26 In Fig. 4b, the three main diffraction peaks (2θ = 27.8°, 46.6°, 55.3°) of the sample after annealing under Se vapor move toward lower 2θ angles, which is attributed to the increased lattice spacing of the larger Se atoms (0.198 nm) substituted for smaller S atoms (0.184 nm) after selenization. That is, expansion in the unit cell volume with the replacement of S by Se leads to the shift.6 The average composition of the CZTSSe films by EDS test is Cu:(Zn + Sn) = 0.81, and Zn:Sn = 1.26. It is apparent that the composition of both the CZTS and CZTSSe films has experienced a slight change during the annealing process.

The XRD pattern alone is insufficient to identify the phase purity of the as-synthesized product, since some binary (such as cubic ZnS) and ternary (such as tetragonal Cu2SnS3) chalcogenides have very similar lattice parameters or analogous pattern features to CZTS phase.27 Thus, Raman scattering measurements on the film surfaces have been performed to detect the presence of secondary phases. Fig. 5 shows the Raman spectra for obtained CZTS and CZTSSe films. Both samples exhibit only pure CZTS or CZTSSe phases. The vacuum-annealed sample (Fig. 5a) shows a major peak at 338 cm−1, which is attributed to the CZTS A1 mode,27 along with two weak peaks at 287 cm−1 and 369 cm−1, which are consistent with previously reported CZTS values.17 The sample annealed under Se vapor (Fig. 5b) has the typical bi-modal behavior observed on CZTS1−xSex alloys.28 Considering the XRD results, the peaks found at 215 and 326 cm−1 can be associated with a CZTSSe phase, which is in agreement with some previous reports.17,18,29 No evidence of other possible binary phases (such as Cu2S, Cu2Se, ZnS, ZnSe) appears in the Raman spectra for films from vacuum and Se vapor annealing treatment.

The elemental information of the CZTSSe thin film was analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The binding energy (BE) values for Cu 2p3/2 and Cu 2p1/2 are 932.5 and 952.3 eV with a peak splitting of 19.8 eV (Fig. 6a). No satellite peaks were found at the higher binding energy direction. Therefore, it can be concluded that only monovalent copper exists in the sample, indicating that Cu2+ in the starting material has been reduced during the process. The peaks of Zn 2p appear at BE of 1021.3 and 1044.4 eV, with a peak splitting of 23.1 eV (Fig. 6b), consistent with the standard splitting exhibited by divalent Zn(II). The Sn(IV) is confirmed by a peak splitting of 8.4 eV of two peaks located at 486.5 and 494.9 eV, respectively (Fig. 6c). It also suggests that Sn2+ in the starting material has been oxidized to Sn4+ during the process. In Fig. 6d, two peaks appear at BE of 161.3 and 166.8 eV, respectively. The former can be assigned to the S 2p core (S(−II)), which is consistent with the 160–164 eV range expected for S in sulfide phases. The latter is assigned to Se 3p core (Se(−II)). The Se(−II) is also confirmed by the Se 3d peak located at a BE of 54.4 eV (Fig. 6e), which is often observed for Se in selenide phases. In Fig. 6f, the intensities of C 1s and O 1s peaks are compared with the Cu 2p3/2 peak. It indicates that the intensities of C 1s and O 1s are at least two orders lower than that of Cu 2p3/2, suggesting a low concentration of carbon and oxygen of less than 0.5 at%. The above results suggest that, compared with the nanocrystal-ink approach utilizing organic solvents and binders, which normally leaves behind a carbon-rich layer on the entirety of the final device, the precursor solution introduced here has the advantages of achieving a nearly oxygen-free and carbon-free CZTSSe film. However, metal chlorides were used in the process of preparing the precursor solution, so it must be admitted that the Cl residue in the resulting film is hard to avoid, which is also a common problem in solution-based processing except for hydrazine-based processing. The study of the effect of Cl residue in the absorber film on the device performance is the subject of upcoming work.

Fig. 7 shows representative cross-section and surface field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images of CZTS and CZTSSe films. The cross-sectional images of CZTS (Fig. 7a) and CZTSSe (Fig. 7c) thin films dipped four times show that the thicknesses are approximately 1.45 and 1.68 μm, respectively. It should be noticed that, compared with CZTS thin film, the resulting CZTSSe thin film is composed of larger densely packed grains. This implies that the incorporation of Se into CZTS is conducive to the crystal growth. The larger grain size is an important factor that can affect device performance, as fine grains with excess grain boundaries can lead to recombination and cause a reduction in the current that can be collected.

The optical absorptions of the thin films are measured using UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy. It indicates that the CZTS and CZTSSe films display photoabsorption properties mainly in the visible light region, and the band-edge absorption of the CZTSSe film exhibited a slight red shift toward a longer wavelength in comparison with the absorption value of the CZTS film. The band gap energies can be estimated by a related curve of (αhv)2versus photon energy (α = absorbance, h = Planck's constant, and v = frequency), and the results are shown in Fig. 8. From the extrapolated linear portion, it is apparent that the band gap of the CZTSSe film is about 1.25 eV, which is smaller than that of CZTS film (about 1.5 eV).

The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of CZTS-based and CZTSSe-based solar cells are presented in Fig. 9. The two device characteristics are compared as shown in Table 1. The CZTS-based cell exhibits an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 407 mV, which is higher than 381 mV for CZTSSe-based cell. Meanwhile, the Jsc (32.1 mA cm−2) of CZTSSe-based cell is significantly improved compared with CZTS-based cell (15.9 mA cm−2). The present CZTSSe cell has relatively low Voc and high Jsc, which is expected from its lower band gap (1.25 eV) as opposed to 1.50 eV for the CZTS. It is worthwhile to observe that the CZTSSe cell has a remarkably better efficiency performance (5.36%) compared with that of the CZTS cell (2.86%). The improved morphology from selenization, with larger grain size, and hence fewer grain boundaries and better electronic transport, benefits the conversion efficiency in the resulting CZTSSe cell. Although the device performance of the CZTSSe absorbers in this study is relatively lower compared with those produced by nanocrystal inks and hydrazine-based slurries, we believe that, with further optimization of the annealing procedure to form columnar-structured larger grains and device components, the CZTSSe solar cells based on the current solution approach could reach power conversion efficiencies close to 10%.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a technique for producing CZTS and CZTSSe thin filmsfrom non-hydrazine precursor solution followed by dip-coating, in which each of the elemental constituents are mixed on a molecular scale. Ethanol is used as the solvent, which should reduce carbon residue, similar to hydrazine but with low toxicity, stability, a cheap price, and environmentally friendly characteristics. TAA and MEA play important roles in forming the homogeneous CZTS precursor complex solution with a high concentration of the reactant species. The precursor solution blended at the molecular scale would help to precisely tune the stoichiometry of the starting materials, allowing films to fall within the relatively narrow window for the formation of the CZTS or CZTSSe phase with minimal secondary phases present. All employed precursor species can decompose and favorably form kesterite CZTS at low temperatures, which would minimize the residue impurities such as carbon and oxygen, and circumvent one of the challenges faced by vacuum-based approaches involving the loss of volatile components such as SnS. The homogeneous nature of this solution approach enables potentially scalable film production. Moreover, this synthetic route is robust, low-cost, and environmentally friendly and could be extended to the synthesis of other chalcogenide semiconductor thin films.
