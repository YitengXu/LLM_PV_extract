    , Accepted 7th November 2017First published on 8th November 2017AbstractThis review presents an overview of the recent developments in the area of vat dye chemistry for the preparation of π-conjugated molecules and polymers for organic electronic applications. Vat dyes are well-established molecules in the textile colouring and painting industry as they are inexpensive and highly stable. Their optical properties in the visible region are attributed to their highly conjugated sp2 carbon networks and the presence of functional groups, especially ketones that allow the formation of “leuco” species. In this review, we will show how the presence of functional groups on these highly conjugated scaffolds can be used to modify their electronic and optical properties to make them useful building blocks for semiconducting organic materials.
1. Introduction
Neutral organic dyes possessing a π-conjugated structure are drawing considerable attention as potential building blocks for the preparation of highly efficient semiconducting materials for various organic electronic applications. One of the biggest advantages of these dyes is their optical properties in the visible range, making them attractive for both organic solar cells (OSCs) and dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), and for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) applications. In addition, their large carbon-rich, rigid π-conjugated structure allows for excellent charge transport properties that could be exploited in organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) and battery applications. Other noteworthy advantages are their very low cost when bought in bulk owing to the few, inexpensive synthetic steps required to prepare them, their high environmental, thermal and chemical stability, and the possibility of performing chemical transformation to change their properties owing to the presence of functional groups such as ketones, halogens and amines.
Vat dyes are a particularly interesting class of building blocks for low-cost electronics since they are produced in large amounts – thousands of metric tons per year – for textile colouring. By definition, a vat dye is a molecule that can be reduced using an inorganic salt-like sodium dithionite, allowing the dye to become water-soluble. After the textile is soaked in the reduced dye solution, the vat dye is re-oxidized to its neutral, insoluble form, thus giving stable colouration to the textile. This process requires an easily accessible reduced “leuco” form, which is most of the time allowed by the presence of conjugated ketones within the dye structure.
Recently, many researchers have explored the chemistry of vat dyes to eventually introduce them as the active component in organic electronic applications. In fact, most of the vat dyes possess a large π-conjugated system that provides efficient light absorption in the low energy region of the visible spectrum, making them very interesting building blocks for the preparation of light-harvesting semiconductors for OSCs. Moreover, small molecules and polymers based on vat dyes packed very efficiently with a maximum π overlap in the thin-film state, which is highly beneficial to charge transport properties. This is particularly critical for the development of OFETs, whose efficiency strongly depends on the thin-film morphology. Finally, vat dye-based molecules can be made highly emissive by simple derivatization, which makes them interesting candidates for organic light-emitting diode (OLED) applications.
Because of the unique reactivity of vat dyes, reliable and efficient methodologies need to be developed in order to functionalize and introduce them as building blocks in π-conjugated materials. However, this is not a trivial task as most of the commercially available vat dyes are quite insoluble in common organic solvents and contain a non-negligible number of impurities. In this review, we discuss the recent developments in the synthetic strategies used to prepare vat dye-based π-conjugated materials for organic electronics. The vat dyes covered in this review are shown in Fig. 1. It is noteworthy that other dyes such as quinacridone,1 perylenediimide2 and diketopyrrolopyrrole3 are very important in the fields of organic chemistry and organic electronics. However, because they have been reviewed extensively in recent years and they are not considered vat dyes per se, we will not address them in this review. Likewise, indigo (vat blue 1) and isoindigo, which are very useful dyes for organic electronics, have not been reviewed here since several exhaustive reviews have been published on this topic.4,5

2. Anthanthrone
Anthanthrone (1, Fig. 1) was synthesized for the first time more than a century ago by Ludwig Kalb from the Chemical Laboratory of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Munich.6 Nowadays, anthanthrone derivatives are prepared commercially from naphtholactam 10, which is hydrolyzed, diazotized and dimerized (Fig. 2).7,8 Halogenation in 4 and 10 positions can be performed using molecular chlorine, bromine or iodine to provide dyes of different colours. 4,10-Dibromoanthanthrone, also named vat orange 3 (Fig. 1, compound 1b), is very popular in the dying industry as it exhibits a bright, intense orange colour.

Although anthanthrone 1a and 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone 1b have been used in electronic devices, their poor solubility in organic solvents makes them unsuitable for solution processing. Thus, different strategies to functionalize them have been developed with two purposes: (1) increase the solubility by introducing alkyl chains and (2) modulate their electronic properties by adding functional groups at the 4, 10, 6 and 12 positions. The presence of ketones and halogen atoms on 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone provides two useful handles that open up many possibilities for functionalization. In back-to-back reports in 2005 and 2006, Neckers and coworkers used 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone to prepare a series of soluble anthanthrene derivatives by performing Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with phenylboronic acid derivatives at the 4 and 10 positions, followed by functionalization at the 6 and 12 positions (Fig. 3).9,10 For the later derivatization, two strategies were employed: the reduction of ketones followed by dibromination and Suzuki–Miyaura coupling (path A, Fig. 3) or direct functionalization with phenyllithium derivatives followed by dehydration of the resulting alcohol with hydroiodic acid (path b, Fig. 3). Groups such as o-tolyl, biphenyl, naphthyl, p-tert-butylphenyl and p-trifluoromethylphenyl have been successfully introduced, and the resulting anthanthrene derivatives showing good fluorescence properties in the greenish-blue region in solution with fluorescence quantum yield values (ϕF) up to 33% have been tested as emitters in OLEDs. Highly stable OLED devices with a half-life of 3500 hours and a luminescence of ca. 600 cd m−2 have been obtained with these materials.

Different strategies for the functionalization of 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone with an aim to explore the potential and limits of this building block for organic electronics were reported in 2013 (Fig. 4).11 The 4 and 10 positions were reacted with different functional groups using palladium-catalysed reactions such as Stille (16), Castro–Stephens–Sonogashira (17) and Buchwald–Hartwig amination (18). Interestingly, the nature of the substitutions at the 4 and 10 positions has a significant impact on the electronic properties. For example, the presence of strong electron-donating diarylamine groups, which create a strong intramolecular donor–acceptor complex with ketones, red-shifted the absorption spectrum in solution by more than 120 nm compared with the dialkyne (17) analogue.
 Fig. 4  Overview of the functionalization reactions at the 4 and 10 positions (top) and 6 and 12 positions (bottom) of anthanthrone. 
The 6 and 12 positions can also be chemically transformed to replace the ketones by functional groups of different nature. For instance, the electron-withdrawing ketone groups can be transformed into electron-donating alkoxy groups in just one step using a reducing agent and alkyl halide (23). When thiophene units are located at the 4 and 10 positions, this transformation yields to a significant hypsochromic shift (ca. 75 nm) of the absorption spectrum and a much higher HOMO level. This example illustrates well how easy it is to modulate the electronic properties of anthanthrone-based molecules by simple chemical modifications. Other transformations, such as the Ramirez dihalo-olefination reaction to introduce gem-dichloroolefins and eventually bis(diarylethylene) (20),11 Knoevenagel condensation to connect dicyanovinylene (22),11 amine condensation (21)12 and nucleophilic substitution to connect substituted alkynes (19), all yield π-conjugated molecules with different electronic properties.13,14 With this simple set of transformation, materials with optical bandgap values varying from 1.43 to 2.64 eV have been obtained in few synthetic steps.
Anthanthrene- and anthanthrone-based devices showed promising results in OFETs and OSCs, although only few reports have been published on this topic in the past decade. In 2010, Sariciftci and coworkers published OFET performances of a series of dye-based semiconductors, including 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone (1b).15 Using a bottom-gate, top-contact device configuration, hole mobility values of up to μh = 1.9 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 were obtained with this molecule as the semiconductor (vacuum deposition). Interestingly, this molecule also exhibits electron transport ability, and OFETs with μe = 8.8 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 have been reported.16 Although these values are far from the best values reported for OFETs, these studies show that 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone is a potential candidate for the preparation of ambipolar semiconductors. The ambipolar character of 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone (1b) has been predicted recently in a theoretical study using density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) calculations.17 A few years after these initial reports, a hole transport mobility of up to μh = 7.8 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 for anthanthrene derivatives with phenyl- and thiophene-substituted anthanthrene derivatives was reported (Fig. 5).18

Because of their optical properties in the visible region, anthanthrene- and anthanthrone derivatives have been tested in OSC applications. In all the cases reported, these derivatives have been used as p-type materials in combination with PC61BM or PC71BM. In only one synthetic step, Briseno and coworkers prepared 6,12-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl)anthanthrene from anthanthrone 1a and tested it in solution-processed bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells (Fig. 6).19 Without any thermal treatment on the semiconductor film, they obtained a power conversion efficiency (PCE) value of 1.95% with a fill factor (FF) value of 0.45%. In a similar study, the anthanthrene derivatives shown in Fig. 5 (25–27) were tested in bulk heterojunction OSCs. In a simple ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC61BM/LiF/Al configuration, they obtained PCE values of up to 2.2% for compound 25 under AM 1.5G illumination. Under optimized conditions, all three compounds yielded PCE values above 1.0%, which is in the same range as other small molecules tested as p-type materials in OSCs.20 The results obtained in these studies are very encouraging considering that the anthanthrene derivatives tested absorb very little between 600 and 1000 nm, which represents the most important region of the solar spectrum for solar cell applications.21

Unsymmetrical anthanthrene derivatives have recently been prepared and tested in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) (Fig. 7).22 The donor and acceptor (anchoring) groups have been linked following the two possible paths of conjugation: the 4–10 and 6–12 axes. It has been shown in a separate report that these two axes are not equally efficient at extending the conjugation of the anthanthrene core.13 In general, the 6–12 axis provides better conjugation through the anthanthrene core when an alkyne is used as a spacer between the anthanthrene and π-conjugated units attached to it. Single-molecule conductance measurements of two acetynylpyridine–anthanthrene–acetynylpyridine triads using a mechanically controlled break junction setup corroborate this result. In fact, the triad with the acetynylpyridine units linked at the 6 and 12 positions provides conductance values more than 81 times higher than those measured for the triad linked at the 4 and 10 positions.23 Unexpectedly, the compounds 29–32 exhibit very similar λmax (∼460 nm) and bandgap values, regardless of the axis used for the donor–acceptor complex. Moreover, the λmax values are unusually low (high bandgap) for molecules possessing an intramolecular charge transfer complex. One hypothesis is the high dihedral angle between the π-conjugated units and the anthanthrene core, which prevents good electron delocalization within the molecules. Nonetheless, high PCE values (up to 5.27%) have been obtained, meaning that a molecular design that would allow optimal sunlight absorption in the low-energy region of the solar spectrum could provide even better efficiency.

Anthanthrene and anthanthrone building blocks have also been incorporated into the structure of π-conjugated polymers. To the best of our knowledge, the first reported example was published back in 1993 by Yi and coworkers who copolymerized 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone (1b) with di(2-thienyl)dimethylsilane using palladium-catalysed Negishi polymerization.24 The copolymer prepared exhibited a very low molecular weight (1400 g mol−1), resulting in an unusually low λmax value of 510 nm in THF, which corresponds to a red shift of only 25 nm compared with 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone (1b).
In an attempt to obtain anthanthrone-based copolymers with higher molecular weights, the anthanthrone unit was substituted with 3-hexylthiophene at the 4 and 10 positions prior to the polymerization reaction to increase the solubility of the resultant polymer, thus avoiding rapid precipitation in the reaction mixture (Fig. 8).25 This substitution also allows the introduction of a halogen atom on both ends of the unit, which is necessary for further palladium-catalysed cross-coupling reactions. Starting from compound 33, synthesized in three synthetic steps from 4,10-dibromoanthanthrone 1b, a series of five copolymers has been prepared via Stille coupling. Although copolymers with a high density of alkyl chains (ex. PTANTDPP) possess moderate Mn values (11600 g mol−1), most of the polymers with anthanthrone in the main chain possess relatively low Mn values due to rapid precipitation in the reaction mixture. Nonetheless, copolymers with broad absorption bands in the visible region (from 500 to 900 nm) and relatively low optical bandgaps (down to 1.39 eV in the solid state) have been prepared. These polymers exhibit very interesting chromism properties as they undergo fluoride-promoted photoinduced electron transfer to form a radical anion on the anthanthrone unit.26 The radical anion and the dianion forms are easily accessible through chemical doping in solution using sodium dithionite and the reduction processes are reversible upon exposure to air.

Park and coworkers reported the synthesis of similar π-conjugated polymers in which anthanthrone is replaced by its 6,12-dialkoxy analogue.27,28 This structural change ensures better solubility of the resulting polymers, although their redox properties are significantly changed since the quinoid form is not available anymore to undergo a two-electron reduction process. 4,10-Dibromo-6,12-bis(2-decyltetradecyloxy)anthanthrene was copolymerized with 2,2′-thiophenevinylenthiophene (PTVTC) and 2,2′-bithiophene (PTTC) via Stille coupling (Fig. 9).27,28 The presence of branched alkyl chains at the 6 and 12 positions provides much better solubility in common organic solvents, and Mn values of 52400 and 63200 g mol−1 were obtained for PTVTC and PTTC, respectively. Compared with the anthanthrone-based polymers, PTVTC and PTTC exhibit slightly higher optical bandgap values (∼1.8 eV) while absorbing light in the 350 to 550 nm region (λmax ∼ 400 nm). Both polymers have been tested in OFETs and BHJ OSCs. For OFETs, charge mobility values of μh ∼ 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (bottom-gate/top-contact device configuration) with an Ion/Ioff ratio of ∼104 were measured when the polymers were spin-coated on the substrate from a chloroform solution. The PTTC-based devices exhibit slightly better charge transport properties due to improvement in crystalline ordering and larger crystalline domains in the thin films.

In BHJ OSCs, PCE values of 3.04 and 1.35% were obtained for PTVTC and PTTC, respectively, when mixed with PC71BM. In contrast with OFETs, the best efficiency was obtained for PTVTC due to better phase separation with PC71BM, leading to a better morphology of the thin film. Slightly better results (PCE = 3.18%) were obtained for PTVTC when thermal annealing at 100 °C was performed, but not much difference was observed for PTTC. Interestingly, the latter polymer yielded to thermally stable solar cell devices as it retained 97% of its initial efficiency at an elevated temperature, proving the morphological stability of the PTTC:PC71BM blend.
One of the main disadvantages of anthanthrone as a building block for organic semiconductors is the steric hindrance at the 4, 6, 10 and 12 positions. In fact, all these positions possess at least one hydrogen atom at the peri position, forcing a large dihedral angle between the anthanthrone core and the neighbouring π-conjugated units. Thus, making low bandgap anthanthrone-based materials with good solid-state organization (with strong π–π interactions) at the molecular level is very challenging. One way to decrease the dihedral angle in π-conjugated molecules is to use functional groups capable of intramolecular hydrogen or heteroatom bonding between the units, providing conformational locks and some rigidity.29 This strategy has been explored in the case of anthanthrone by replacing the ketone groups at the 6 and 12 positions with a secondary amine (Fig. 10).12 When thieno[3,4-c]-pyrrole-4,6-dione (TPD) units are linked at the 4 and 10 positions, the dihedral angle goes from 52° for the Boc-protected (34) derivative to 33° for the unprotected derivative (35). This significant decrease of the dihedral angle is attributed to the formation of a weak hydrogen bond (2.52 Å) between the carbonyl group (H-bond acceptor) of the TPD unit and the secondary amine (H-bond donor) of the anthanthrone. Although 33° is still quite high compared with other planar π-conjugated systems, it is enough to decrease the optical bandgap from 2.43 eV for Boc-protected derivatives to 1.99 eV for the deprotected one. Moreover, planarization through H-bonding promotes molecular organization in the thin film state, as shown by X-ray diffraction recorded before and after deprotection of the amine (Fig. 10b).12

Although this strategy might seem potentially interesting for the preparation of low-bandgap, planar anthanthrone-based molecules, it is quite limiting in regard to the chemical diversity of the anthanthrone core since a very limited number of functional groups allow such intramolecular interactions. To overcome the presence of hydrogen atoms at the peri positions and allow the synthesis of planar molecules and polymers without the need to use orienting functional groups, linkage must be done at different positions. On the anthanthrone, the only positions without cumbersome peri hydrogen atoms are the 2 and 8 positions. As no 2,8-difunctionalized anthanthrone derivatives are commercially available, regioselective C–H activation reactions have to be used to introduce useful functional groups that will allow further cross-coupling reaction. Based on the previous work on phenacenes,30 Isobe and coworkers successfully performed an Ir-catalysed direct borylation reaction of the anthanthrene derivative 28 at the least hindered 2 and 8 positions (Fig. 11).31 The resulting diborylated molecule was used in Yamago Pt-catalysed macrocyclization to yield molecule 36.32 No optical characterization has been conducted on 36, and to the best of our knowledge, no small molecules or polymers have been prepared using the 2,8-functionalized anthanthrone derivative. Nonetheless, the authors reported that the energy gap between the planar and orthogonal conformers is about 2.24 kcal mol−1 for the dimer, which is very similar to the unsubstituted biphenyl.33 One can expect that connectivity at the 2 and 8 positions using a five-membered ring heterocycle such as thiophene, pyrrole or furan could lead to small dihedral angles and consequently to planar, low bandgap materials.

π-Conjugated molecules with a large carbon scaffold have also been used as building blocks for the preparation of supramolecular hosts, especially to encapsulate fullerenes and their derivatives through π–π and charge transfer interactions. Examples include porphyrins, coronenes and extended tetrathiafulvalenes (exTTFs). Because of its large π surface, anthanthrene is an ideal candidate for this purpose. Anthanthrene can be made electron-rich through functionalization, increasing its affinity for electron-poor fullerenes. In this line, a cavity-like host using anthanthrene with tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) moieties attached at the 6 and 12 positions named superextended TTF (sExTTF, Fig. 12) has been prepared.34 In addition to increasing the electron density, the TTF units induce a curvature to the anthanthrene core due to steric hindrance between the sulphur atoms of TTF and the hydrogen atoms in the peri positions (Fig. 12).34 This curvature allows optimal concave–convex geometrical matching between the host and the fullerene, increasing the association constant of the complexes. Using a titration experiment, association constants of up to 2.6 × 105 M−1 have been measured with 40. Interestingly, sExTTF derivatives can be oxidized back to the anthanthrone form through a fullerene-sensitized photooxidation reaction under air.

3. Indanthrone and flavanthrone
Indanthrone (2, vat blue 4) and flavanthrone (3, vat yellow 1) (Fig. 1) and their derivatives are vat dyes that contain nitrogen atoms embedded within their sp2 carbon skeleton. The former possesses two secondary amine moieties that can be functionalized with alkyl chains to increase the solubility of its derivatives, while the later has two imine groups that provide the PAH core with relatively strong electron-withdrawing properties. Interestingly, these two vat dyes can be prepared by thermal condensation of the same starting material, namely 2-aminoanthraquinone, under alkaline conditions at different temperatures.35
The low solubility of indanthrone can be exploited to prepare high-quality nanocrystals with very unique optical properties. In their seminal work, Sariciftci and coworkers used the Boc-protected indanthrone to prepare indanthrone nanocrystals using a “hot injection” method similar to that used for the synthesis of inorganic quantum dots.36 The basic idea is to use a soluble Boc-protected precursor that is deprotected thermally in a coordinating solvent in the presence of an organic ligand (for the stabilization of the nanocrytals), leading to the controlled precipitation of the dye molecules and the formation of nanocrystals (Fig. 13).36 The sizes and shapes of the nanocrystals can be controlled under growth conditions. From all the pigments used in this study, indanthrone is the one presenting the most significant shift in optical properties as the Boc-protected indanthrone absorbs light in the blue-green region (λmax = 475 nm) with an optical bandgap of ca. 2.26 eV while indanthrone nanocrytals absorb all over the visible range and exhibit a much lower optical bandgap value (ca. 1.38 eV) (Fig. 13b).36 Interestingly, indanthrone-based nanocrystals emit light in the near-infrared region (λemi = ca. 1020 nm), making them potentially interesting for biomedical applications.

Because of its low solubility in common organic solvents, indanthrone is often tetraalkylated in similar conditions to anthanthrone derivatives by reducing the carbonyl groups with sodium dithionite.37 In the process, the two secondary amines are transformed into imines, thus creating a PAH with an azaacene portion (a portion in blue, Fig. 14), which is known to induce high electron affinity and, consequently, good n-type semiconducting properties.38 The resulting extended phenazine 42 derivative showed a much lower band gap than the straight phenazine (1.89 vs. 2.91 eV), thus exhibiting an efficient green fluorescence in solution (ϕF = 56%).37,39 Guest–host-type OLEDs made from compound 42 and poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) showed a luminance of up to 250 cd m−2 and a luminous efficiency of 1.0 cd A−1.37 Later on, the same group reported that a reduction of the alkyl chain length from C8 to C4 allowed an increase in the electroluminescence efficiency with a measured luminance of 1670 cd m−2 in a PVK:42 matrix device.40
 Fig. 14  Synthesis of a tetraalkylated phenazine derivative from indanthrone.38 
Flavanthrone and its derivatives have been mainly studied as semiconductors in OFETs. In 2010, Sariciftci and coworkers measured an n-type mobility of μe = 0.012 cm2 V−1 s−1 when flavanthrone (3) was vacuum deposited on top of the alternating layers of guanine and adenine as gate dielectrics.15,41 By modifying the device geometry, they were able to slightly increase the mobility value to μe = 0.042 cm2 V−1 s−1.42
To modify the solid-state organization and electronic properties, Briseno and coworkers prepared a flavanthrene derivative in a single synthetic step by treating flavanthrone 3 with lithiated triisopropylsilylacetylene in THF to give compound 43 (Fig. 15a).43 Interestingly, single crystal transistors of this compound exhibit a relatively high mobility of μh = 0.14 cm2 V−1 s−1. This high mobility value compared with other TIPS-acetylene PAH tested in the same report can be attributed to the 1D slipped–stack motif with a close π–π distance (3.38 Å) and a π-surface overlap (18.3 Å2) (Fig. 15b and c).43

Similar to the work done with indanthrone, Pron and coworkers alkylated flavanthrone with alkyl chains of different lengths and tested the resultant green fluorescent compounds in combination with PVK in OLEDs.44 Similarly to what they obtained for indanthrone derivatives, they measured luminance values of up to 1860 cd m−2 and luminous efficiency values of 3.06 cd A−1. It is worth mentioning that alkylated flavanthrone derivatives exhibit much higher quantum yield values than indanthrone (ϕF = ca. 80% vs. ca. 60%).
4. Other vat dyes
Other vat dyes have been used as building blocks for the preparation of organic semiconductors, although to a much lesser extent than the ones described above. Similar to anthanthrone, pyranthrone (4, Fig. 1) possesses two conjugated ketone groups that could be functionalized to provide conjugated molecules with promising charge transport properties. In 2013, Briseno and coworkers prepared a dialkynylated pyranthrene derivative from pyranthrone using lithium TIPS-acetylide (Fig. 16).43 Because of its larger π conjugated network compared with the corresponding anthanthrene derivative, a lower optical bandgap (2.27 eV vs. 2.47 eV) was obtained. However, no appreciable hole mobility value has been measured for this molecule in OFETs. In the same article, they also reported the dialkynylation of other dyes, including isoviolanthrone (45) and 7,14-dibenzpyrenequinone (46 and 47) (Fig. 16) for which they measured hole mobility values of 6.7 × 10−3 and 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. TMS- and TIPS-acetylene-appended dibenzpyrenequinone also showed a promising light conversion efficiency (η value up to 2.25%) when used as a donor in a solution-processed BHJ solar cell configuration in combination with PCBM.45
 Fig. 16  Alkynylated vat dyes used as semiconductors in OFETs. 
Dibenzpyrenequinone has also been used to study the influence of crystal polymorphism on the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors.46 Depending on the conditions used for crystal formation, a 1D slipped stack or a 2D brickwork polymorph of compound 46 can be obtained, resulting in a very different charge transport ability. While the red polymorph led to a hole mobility of 0.028 cm2 V−1 s−1, the yellow one, adopting a more suitable molecular organizing for charge transport, exhibits mobility values up to 2.1 cm2 V−1 s−1, representing a 75-fold increase.
Violanthrone 7, or vat blue 20, and its derivatives have also been studied as semiconductors for organic electronics. In 2011, Chen and coworkers reported hole mobility values up to 4.44 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 for an O-alkylated derivative of 16,17-dihydroxyviolanthrone (8, Fig. 1) under optimized conditions.47 They showed that the addition of a bad solvent (hexanes) to the solution prior to solution processing enhanced the mobility value by one order of magnitude due to enhanced π interactions in the solid state. One year after their initial report, the same authors reported the photovoltaic properties of three O-alkylated violanthrone derivatives.48 In a BHJ configuration with PCBM as the n-type material, light conversion efficiency ranging from 0.093 for the 2-ethylhexyl-substituted derivatives to 0.54% for the hexyl-substituted one were obtained, which is quite low compared with other vat dye-based semiconductors.
One of the most intriguing dyes regarding the electronic and optical properties is vat brown 45 (9, Fig. 1). Structurally, this dye is very different from the others as it contains an anti-aromatic pentalene unit, providing the dye with very particular optical properties, especially in the low energy region. Because vat brown 45 is difficult to obtain through traditional chemical suppliers, very few scientific articles have been published on this dye and its functionalization. This might change soon as Chi and coworkers developed a synthetic route to provide the non-halogenated version of vat brown 45 (Fig. 17).49 Their strategy is based on Pd-catalysed dimerization of a properly functionalized phenyl-substituted alkyne (48) to give the dibenzopentalene diester 49, followed by a double AlCl3-catalysed intramolecular Friedel–Craft acylation to yield the pentaleno-bis(anthracenequinone) (50). This compound can be acetynylated under the conditions used for other vat dyes to yield 51, a pentaleno-acene dimer, with a low bandgap of 1.41 eV. Following the same synthetic strategy, a π-extended version of 51 can be obtained starting from a naphthalene derivative, providing compounds 52–54. The extension of conjugation leads to a significant decrease in the bandgap by 0.24 eV at 1.17 eV for 54, which is the lowest ever reported for a vat dye derivative. Compared with anthracene and tetracene derivatives, the pentalene-fused acenes show much better photostability. Moreover, 51 and 54 exhibit three quasi-reversible oxidation waves and two quasi-reversible reduction waves by cyclic voltammetry, indicating that they could be good ambipolar materials for OFET applications. Combined with the low bandgap value, these features make these derivatives very promising candidates for organic electronics.

5. Conclusions
This review article presents the recent developments in the area of vat dye chemistry for organic electronics. Many functionalization reactions have been developed for this specific class of molecules, allowing modulation of their optical and electronic properties. Several derivatives show very promising results in field-effect transistors and bulk heterojunction solar cells. Nonetheless, it is safe to say that research in this area is still in its infancy as a very small proportion of chemical transformation available in the chemist's toolbox has been applied to vat dyes. As for traditional organic semiconductors, chemical modifications leading to better morphological control and continuous fine-tuning of their electronic properties through proper designs are needed in order to make vat dyes a credible alternative to well-studied building blocks such as thiophene, carbazole and other heterocycles. Moreover, the proportion of the existing vat dyes studied for organic electronics is still very low. In fact, a large number of vat dyes remain unexplored, mainly due to the lack of academic literature on these molecules, which is traditionally associated with the chemical industry and low technological applications. Fig. 18 shows some potentially interesting vat dyes for organic electronics that have been explored yet. With an increase in pressure for the preparation of low-cost and efficient materials for electronic applications, there is a good chance that this will not be true for long and that chemists will see the tremendous potential hidden behind these molecules.
