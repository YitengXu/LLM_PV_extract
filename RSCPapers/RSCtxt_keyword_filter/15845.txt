Normally in the field, enantiomeric mixtures are separated through a standard process. The goal of this study was to determine if the mixture of BsubPc enantiomers could form a mixed alloyed composition in the solid state, which is very relevant to their potential application in the organic electronic field. We present the synthesis and physical characteristics of a selection of four chiral BsubPc mixtures. These BsubPcs are specifically trichlorinated and trifluorinated in the periphery, such as Cl-βF3BsubPc, Cl-αF3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc and Cl-αCl3BsubPc. The isomeric (C1/C3) ratios of each BsubPc were determined by NMR. Single-crystal XRD of all four BsubPc mixtures showed that the C1 and C3 isomers co-crystallized within their respective lattices forming solid-state mixed alloyed compositions. The structures of Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc crystallized in the same lattice as Cl-BsubPc, with some expansion of the unit cell volume, while the trichlorinated BsubPcs did not due to the large van der Waals radii of the chlorine atoms. This set of mixed alloyed BsubPcs was also integrated into organic solar cells/photovoltaics (OSCs/OPVs) as both non-fullerene electron acceptors and as electron donors. It was confirmed that these BsubPc isomers/enantiomers are applicable in OPVs as mixed alloyed compositions, with more promising functionality as non-fullerene electron acceptors given their significant contribution to the EQE spectra. Further molecular engineering of these materials will be made to enhance their OPV performance and to explore their bifunctional charge carrier mobility roles.

Design, System, Application
We specifically designed and engineered a mixed alloyed composition of organic-based macrocyclic compounds, boron subphthalocyanines (BsubPcs). The molecular design principle involved applying three halogen peripheral substitutions (fluorine or chlorine) either in the alpha or beta (α or β) position. This enabled a mixture of C3 and C1 stereoisomers forming the first example of a BsubPc mixed alloyed composition named as Cl-(α or β)X3BsubPcs (X = Cl or F) and was confirmed through single crystal growth and diffraction analysis. In the past a non-specifically engineered mixed alloyed composition of related macrocycles, boron subnaphthalocyanines (BsubNcs), had positive impact on organic solar cell (OSC) performance. We engineered the Cl-(α or β)X3BsubPcs alloyed compositions into OSCs as both electron donors and electron acceptors and have confirmed they have good light absorption capability and good electron conductivity. We also found the mixed Cl-(α or β)X3BsubPcs are better as electron acceptors than electron donors; the β substituted BsubPcs perform better as electron acceptors than the α counterparts; and the chlorinated BsubPcs are better performers than the fluorinated analogues. This then outlines further engineering considerations of alternative BsubPc mixed alloyed compositions to have an even higher positive impact on OSCs performance and ultimate lifetime stability.

Introduction
Boron subphthalocyanines (BsubPcs), a sub-member of the phthalocyanine (Pc) macrocyclic family, chelate a boron atom with three aza/imide-coupled isoindole units (Fig. 1a). Since the discovery of Cl-BsubPc in 1972,1 many new BsubPc derivatives have been synthesized and studied by substituting the axial chloride and peripheral hydrogens (Fig. 1a), and even by further modifying the bridging units of the BsubPc macrocycle and extending the aromatic core giving rise to new macrocyles.2–4 Besides the growing interest in the chemistry of these macrocycles at a molecular level, BsubPcs have been found to be active materials for application in organic solar cells,5 organic light emitting diodes,6 non-linear optics,7 fluorescence chemosensing,8 optical imaging and photodynamic therapy,9 among others.
 Fig. 1  (a) Structure of standard boron subphthalocyanine (Cl-BsubPc) with labelled peripheral and axial positions, (b) structures of trihalogenated BsubPcs (depicting the C1 and C3 isomers depending on the arrangement of the halogen on the isoindole unit) that will be discussed here. 
BsubPcs are synthesized via the reaction of a phthalonitrile with a boron trihalide (chloride or bromide10) at various temperatures through a templating effect.2 The mechanism of the macrocycle formation is not clear,11 but a theoretical model has been recently proposed.11,12
The same reaction is also used for the formation of a Pc with a wide range of metallic halides throughout the periodic table with varying degrees of Lewis acidity.13,14 For many Pcs the reaction of a phthalonitrile with a chloro-Lewis acid is known to generate random chlorination on the periphery of the Pc in addition to the target Pc.15–17 Random chlorination is another example where the mechanism is not clear, although during the process the addition of chlorine to the macrocycle can happen either via light-initiated radical18 or Friedel–Crafts cationic chlorine11 (Cl˙ or Cl+). For example, the mono-chloro substitution of the Pc macrocycle is a known side product when synthesizing CuPc.15,16 Also, when synthesizing ZnPc from zinc chloride with excess phthalonitrile (1:10 molar equivalency ratio), two side products have been observed in addition to the target hydrogenated ZnPc.17 The two byproducts were the peripherally mono- and bis-chloro substituted Pcs. The composition of the mixture was confirmed by mass spectrometry and X-ray photoemission spectroscopy and was shown to be influential on the performance metrics of an organic solar cell (OSC)/organic photovoltaics (OPVs).17 In each case the chlorination has random positioning.
Our group has also observed this chlorination phenomenon on structurally similar compounds to Pcs and BsubPcs with an extended π-conjugated system, namely chloro boron subnaphthalocyanines – Cl-BsubNcs.19 The chlorination process during the BsubNc formation is more unique than the random chlorination of Pcs. It was found that chlorination happened uniquely in the bay-position of the BsubNcs although at random frequency.19 We designated the materials as Cl–ClnBsubNcs where n reflects the frequency of the chlorination and to highlight this as a mixture of BsubNcs with varying amounts of chlorination. What makes this case even more unique is the fact that even though these were a set of mixtures, single crystals could be grown/formed and the relative composition of the mixtures remaining the same. The bay-position chlorination was then confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.19 Our group reported extensive studies on the chemical composition of the Cl–ClnBsubNcs and their application20,21 and showed that variations on the axial substituent of the ClnBsubNcs did not enable separation of the mixtures.22 To summarize, it was unique because a mixture of isomers/variants formed a single crystal, maintained the mixed composition and had a set of physical properties that were indicative of a pure compound. This mixture of what we call ‘mixed alloyed composition’ could not be separated. Another significant finding from that study, related to the physical and electronic properties, was the enhancement of the OSC performance when employing Cl–ClnBsubNcs with a higher level of the bay position chlorination.19 This material has also been incorporated into one of the highest performing planar heterojunction solar cells, with an 8.4% power conversion efficiency.23
In the BsubPc space, a series of trisubstituted ones (containing a single substituent on each isoindole unit) has already been known to be formed into a set of isomeric mixtures when reacting a 3- and 4-singly substituted phthalonitrile precursor with BCl3.4,24 These isomers have either C1 or C3 symmetries, and are inherently chiral meaning that each isomer is a racemic mixture of enantiomers (Fig. 1b and Scheme 1).4 Great work has been reported on their resolution by HPLC25 and their separation by column chromatography.26 A variety of substituents, such as tert-butyl,25 chlorosulfonyl,27 nitro,28 and iodo,29 have been explored in the periphery of these BsubPcs. Just to name a few studies: the tri-chlorosulfonyl-BsubPcs can become water soluble after refluxing in water and pyridine,27 while the triiodo-BsubPcs serve as building blocks30,31 for highly conjugated BsubPcs via Sonogashira cross-coupling reactions.

(a) The formation of Cl-αX3BsubPc C3 and C1 mixtures using 3-chlorophthalonitrile or 3-fluorophthalonitrile as the starting material. (b) The formation of Cl-βX3BsubPc C3 and C1 mixtures using 4-chlorophthalonitrile or 4-fluorophthalonitrile as the starting material. 
For this study, we are specifically interested in trisubstituted BsubPcs with chlorines and fluorines in the periphery targeting whether we could form an alloyed mixed composition (single crystals, unlike a typical non-alloyed mixture of various impurities which have broad properties and chemical composition due to the varying components within). This was done for two reasons. Chlorine was chosen to mock the random chlorination that has been observed in other macrocycles: BsubNcs,19 ZnPc,17 and CuPc.15,16 Fluorine was chosen as it is electronegative, has an influence on the physical properties of the BsubPcs32 and has a Van Der Waal radii close to that of the hydrogen atom and therefore has high potential to form an alloyed mixed composition. To date, only one trifluorinated BsubPc, specifically Cl-βF3BsubPc, has been isolated as a mixture and tested in OSCs/OPVs.33 Here, we outline the synthesis and basic physical property assessment of Cl-βF3BsubPc, Cl-αF3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc and Cl-αCl3BsubPc (Fig. 1b), where the last three compounds have no precedence in the literature. We also then consider their influence on basic OSC/OPV metrics.
Results & discussion
Synthesis, structural analysis and thermal characterization
The trifluorinated BsubPcs (Cl-αF3BsubPc, Cl-βF3BsubPc) were obtained via overnight refluxing of the corresponding commercially available (3-fluoro-/α-fluoro, 4-fluoro-/β-fluoro) phthalonitriles in the heptane solution of BCl3, as per the Cl-BsubPc standard operating procedure,34 at 43% and 44% yields, respectively (Scheme 1). Similarly, the trichlorinated BsubPcs (Cl-αCl3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc) were obtained from their corresponding phthalonitriles (3-chloro/α-chloro, 4-chloro/β-chloro) at 14% and 29% yields, respectively (Scheme 1). After synthesis, we used train sublimation for the ultimate purification of the mixtures of the α- and β-substituted BsubPcs. All characterization discussed below has been performed on sublimed samples.
The chlorinated phthalonitriles were not easily accessible hence we first synthesized them from their corresponding phthalic anhydrides (Scheme S1†). The phthalonitrile process from a phthalic anhydride is a well-established three-step process,35–37 although not reported for the mono-chloro substituted (neither 3-chloro nor 4-chloro) series. Firstly, the phthalic anhydride is converted into a phthalimide, which can then become the phthalic bisamide under mild conditions on reaction with ammonium hydroxide. Finally, the phthalonitrile is the dehydration product of the phthalic bisamide using a reactive intermediate generated from a mixture of dimethyl formamide and thionyl chloride. The experimental methods described here take into account yield and purity, after scoping molar equivalencies, new reagents, reaction times and work-up conditions (Table S1†). Although all these intermediates are known in the literature, this work presents for the first time a condensed method to make the phthalonitriles in three steps from commercially available phthalic anhydrides and in good yields.
Following the reaction of the corresponding phthalonitriles to form the corresponding BsubPcs (Scheme 1), we were able to quantify the isomeric mixtures of these BsubPcs using 1H and 19F NMR (Fig. 2 and 3). Both Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc have four 19F NMR signals indicating three signals for the asymmetric C1 isomer and 1 signal for the symmetric C3 isomer. The 19F NMR spectrum of Cl-αF3BsubPc (Fig. 2a) shows the four signals with an integration ratio of 1:1:1:2 which corresponds to a 1.5:1 mixture of C1:C3 isomers. The 19F NMR spectrum of Cl-βF3BsubPc (Fig. 2b) shows the four signals with an integration ratio of 1:1:1:1 which corresponds to a 3:1 mixture of C1:C3 isomers. We also observed a set of smaller 19F signals that most likely corresponds to the axially fluorinated derivatives, F-αF3BsubPc and F-βF3BsubPc in the range of 111.83 to 112.73 ppm and −107.06 to −107.30 ppm respectively (Fig. 2) as isomeric mixtures as well. The axial halide exchange process occurred at 5.82% in Cl-αF3BsubPc and 5.70% in Cl-βF3BsubPc (Table 1). These results are consistent with previous findings whereby we saw random halide exchange in the axial position (i.e. F–F6BsubPc and F–F12BsubPc) when using fluorinated phthalonitriles as precursors to make Cl–F6BsubPc and Cl–F12BsubPc, respectively.32 The presence of F-αF3BsubPc and F-βF3BsubPc, respectively, was also confirmed by HPLC and mass spectrometry (Fig. S1 and S2†).

Overall, our 19F NMR studies confirm the presence of C1 and C3 isomers at various distributions: Cl-αF3BsubPc (1.5:1, C1:C3) and Cl-βF3BsubPc (3:1, C1:C3) (Table 1). Our synthesis of Cl-βF3BsubPc yields the 3:1 statistical and experimentally acquired mixture of C1 and C3 isomers as reported33 in the literature. The statistical 3:1 mixture (C1:C3) probability has been proven experimentally with other β-trisubstituted BsubPcs bearing iodo,29 nitro,38 and tert-butyl38 functional groups. The synthesis of Cl-αF3BsubPc, on the other hand, yields half that rate for the C1 isomer, i.e. a 1.5:1 mixture (C1:C3). Previously synthesized24 α-trisubstituted BsubPcs have also shown different C1:C3 isomeric ratios from the statistical 3:1 ratio, however that has been attributed to the steric effects of peripheral substituents such as SO2C3H7, nitro and iodo functional groups.24 Our findings thus reveal that C1:C3 isomeric ratio of Cl-αF3BsubPc is governed by the electronic effects of the peripheral fluorines, as opposed to the sterics, since fluorine approximates hydrogen in atomic radius.
Regarding the trichlorinated BsubPcs, the isomeric content/composition for Cl-αCl3BsubPc was quantified using the splitting pattern of the proton nearest to the peripheral chlorine of one of macrocyclic BsubPc isoindole units. This proton (Hγ, Fig. 3a) is the furthest downfield due to electronegativity of chlorine and appears as one signal (8.89 ppm, doublet of doublets) for the C3 isomer and as two signals (one doublet of doublets, and one triplet of doublets) for the C1 isomer due to loss of symmetry. Based on the integration, we can conclude that the Cl-αCl3BsubPc is a 2:1 mixture of C1 and C3 isomers, respectively. The other two sets of protons (Hα, Hβ) are confirmed by COSY spectra (Fig. S3†). For Cl-βCl3BsubPc, one of the proton sets (Hβ, Fig. 3b) appears as a triplet for both isomers. Because both triplets have an integration of 1, the Cl-βCl3BsubPc is a 1:1 mixture of the C1 and C3 isomers, respectively. Overall, our 1H NMR studies confirm the presence of C1 and C3 isomers at various distributions: Cl-αCl3BsubPc (2:1, C1:C3), and Cl-βCl3BsubPc (1:1, C1:C3) (Table 1). The equimolar C1:C3 mixture for Cl-βCl3BsubPcs (as opposed to the statistical 3:1, C1:C3 ratio) and the increased C1 content in the Cl-αCl3BsubPc, as seen with other bulky substituents on the α-position,24 indicate that not only the steric shielding effects24 but also the electronic nature of the chlorine in the BsubPc periphery affects the arrangement of isoindole units within the macrocycle.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was used to assess the thermal stability of this selection of BsubPcs (Fig. S5†). Degradation temperature profiles were not affected greatly from the peripheral position (α vs. β) of the halogen on the BsubPc, but rather from the halogens themselves. Thermal decomposition temperatures of all four BsubPcs were 367 °C, 332 °C, 412 °C and 400 °C for Cl-αF3BsubPc, Cl-βF3BsubPc, Cl-αCl3BsubPc and Cl-βCl3BsubPc, respectively. These findings show the higher thermal stability of the α-substituted BsubPcs relative to the β-ones. Compared to F3BsubPcs, Cl3BsubPcs undergo an additional degradation at 470 °C and 453 °C, for Cl-αCl3BsubPc and Cl-βCl3BsubPc, respectively. This may indicate the further decomposition of the trichlorinated BsubPc macrocycle. Nonetheless, these TGA profiles clearly show the high thermal stability of these BsubPcs, and their suitability for vacuum deposition methods necessitated for various electronic applications.
The purified BsubPcs were evaluated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). No melting points below 325 °C were observed, meaning these BsubPcs do not feature any thermal phase transitions (Fig. S6†). This is also indicative of these materials having alloyed mixture compositions, as opposed to being a set of standard mixtures that would lead to broad properties and reductions in melting points of the mixed alloyed BsubPcs.
Solid-state arrangement analysis
X-ray diffractable single crystals of Cl-αF3BsubPc, Cl-βF3BsubPc and Cl-βCl3BsubPc were obtained by previously described39 train sublimation methods. Solvent crystallization methods, specifically slow vapour diffusion of hexanes into benzene, allowed growth and acquisition of single crystals of Cl-αCl3BsubPc suitable for X-ray diffraction. As per previous results,32 the axial fluoride materials (F-αF3BsubPc and F-βF3BsubPc) did not appear in the single crystals of Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc presumably due to their relatively low concentration. On XRD each crystal structure was found to be a mixed alloyed composition of the C3 and C1 isomers (Fig. 4). Each compound lies on a crystallographic mirror plane, as expected, with the enantiomers of each isomer. Co-crystallization of these isomers is very intriguing as this only happens for enantiomers, so we are presenting in this work the first report of intentional BsubPc co-crystal mixed alloyed mixtures. As mentioned above, our group has also reported co-crystallization of Br/Cl–Cl6BsubPc40 and peripherally chlorinated BsubNcs.19

Both Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc crystallized into the same lattice as the non-halogenated, fully hydrogenated Cl-BsubPc, which has already been characterized extensively by XRD.10,39,41,42 Small differences were observed in the B–Cl bond lengths, bowl depths relative to Cl-BsubPc, as well as slight shifts in intermolecular interactions. Both Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc exhibited expansion on the a and b unit cell lengths relative to Cl-BsubPc, with more pronounced changes observed in the β-substituted analog. The expansion of the overall unit cell volume relative to Cl-BsubPc is an expected consequence of peripheral substitution due to the slightly larger van der Waals radius of fluorine compared to hydrogen. Close intermolecular contacts are shown and labelled in Fig. 5 using Cl-αF3BsubPc as the representative structure. The trifluorinated derivatives exhibit similar π–π stacking and intermolecular interactions to Cl-BsubPc which allows direct comparison. Selected parameters, bond distances, and close intermolecular distances are summarized in Table 2 (CCDC deposition numbers included).

The possibility of halogen–π interaction was previously addressed for Cl-BsubPc and was determined to be present based on electrostatic potential surface, bond distance, and bond angle analyses.39 Through comparison of Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc with Cl-BsubPc, halogen–π bonding appears to be weaker for the fluorinated derivatives due to the more strained bond angles and increased bond distance for Cl-βF3BsubPc. Each BsubPc molecule interacts with two adjacent molecules through concave–concave π–π interactions between the isoindole groups. Closer concave–concave interactions were observed for Cl-αF3BsubPc where the centroid distances Cg(3)⋯Cg(4) and Cg(4)⋯Cg(4) were shortened. For Cl-βF3BsubPc, the packing is shifted such that the C6 rings of the isoindole groups overlap more directly, as reflected in the Cg(3)⋯Cg(4)⋯Cg(4) angle, and only the Cg(4)⋯Cg(4) distance was shortened (Table 2).
The solid-state crystal structure of Cl-βCl3BsubPc was also obtained from sublimed crystals yet deviated greatly from the Pnma lattice of Cl-βF3BsubPc, adopting instead a monoclinic P21/c lattice. This was expected as introducing chlorine with larger atomic radii to the periphery was likely to prevent the type of close π–π overlap that was observed in the previously discussed structures and the standard Cl-BsubPc. Cl-βCl3BsubPc molecules are arranged along the b-axis in convex-to-concave stacks, akin to “nested bowls.” The molecules are tilted in alternating directions relative to the b-axis. The axial B–Cl bond points towards the five-membered (C4N) pyrrole ring on the adjacent molecule (Fig. 6a). Within these stacks, the molecules are arranged with the isoindole units in staggered configuration for close packing. Selected unit cell parameters and close intermolecular distances for this structure are presented in Table 3 (CCDC deposition numbers included). We noticed an elongated bowl depth to roughly 2.7 Å compared to 2.4–2.5 Å for the other structures in this paper. We observed no close π–π interactions within this crystal structure. The nested bowl packing motif was also prevalent in the structure of Cl–Cl6BsubPc, a previously reported BsubPc40 which is fully chlorinated in the β-position. Cl–Cl6BsubPc crystallized in the P21/n space group, a closely related space group to P21/c. This structural similarity between Cl-βCl3BsubPc and the more substituted Cl–Cl6BsubPc in contrast to the trifluorinated and unhalogenated BsubPcs further demonstrates the sensitive relationship between peripheral functionalization and crystal structure.

Since the single crystals of Cl-αCl3BsubPc were obtained via diffusion of hexanes into benzene, the crystals have an additional variable which could affect packing and therefore points of comparison to Cl-αF3BsubPc, Cl-βF3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc, Cl–Cl6BsubPc, and Cl-BsubPc would be invalid. However, growth of the crystals still confirmed the mixed alloyed composition. We tried extensively by train sublimation, with significant variations, to obtain X-ray quality crystals of Cl-αCl3BsubPc and unfortunately no diffractable crystals could be obtained. It is likely due to the presence of chlorine in the α-periphery position, its relatively large atomic radius likely disrupted orderly packing; the integration of solvent then enabled crystal packing to occur. Cl-αCl3BsubPc was found to crystallize in a lower symmetry space group (Table 3). Its asymmetric unit contains two molecules with a total of 8 molecules per unit cell. We note the π–π stacking of the peripheral isoindole units, both convex–convex and concave–concave occur.
We also examined the structures of Cl-αF3BsubPc, Cl-βF3BsubPc, and Cl-βCl3BsubPc using Hirshfeld surface (HS) analysis.43 The dnorm and shape index maps are presented in Fig. 7. The dnorm map indicates the intermolecular contacts relative to the sum of the van der Waals radii of the atoms involved; the generated output shows red, white, or blue where the contact distance is shorter than, equal to, or longer than, respectively, the sum of the van der Waal radii. The shape index map is a qualitative indication of surface shape which presents complementary bumps and hollows where surfaces touch; regions of the same shape with opposite sign (i.e. red and blue) are where intermolecular contacts are present.
 Fig. 7  Generated HS maps for Cl-BsubPc (a), Cl-αF3BsubPc (b), Cl-βF3BsubPc (c), and Cl-βCl3BsubPc (d). The top row of each set are dnorm maps where red indicates regions where the intermolecular distances are shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of the atoms involved. For (a), red circles indicate where red regions are present indicating strong π–π overlap. Bottom row of each set are shape index maps where complementary shapes of opposite sign (i.e. red and blue) indicate points of contact. Key complementary regions are circled with black dashed lines and joined with a thin black line. 
The close convex–convex π–π interactions of Cl-αF3BsubPc are reflected in the red spots as indicated in the dnorm map (Fig. 7b) which were not observed for Cl-BsubPc (Fig. 7a). The dnorm map of Cl-βCl3BsubPc further confirms that close interactions are axial through the axis of the stack and peripheral between stacks (Fig. 7d). From the dnorm maps of all three trihalogenated compounds, it is evident that the influence of peripheral halogenation results in stronger intermolecular orbital overlap. Large red spots are localized at the peripherally fluorinated and chlorinated sites as well as sites they interact with.
HS maps generated in CrystalExplorer also allowed us to extract quantitative data of close bonding interactions, specifically the atoms involved and the frequency of these interactions, presented as fingerprint plots (dexternalvs. dinternal), which maps from blue (low frequency) to green to red (high frequency) (Fig. S7–S9†). The fingerprint plot of Cl-αF3BsubPc C⋯C interactions showed a high frequency of these interactions.
Photophysical and electrochemical analysis
UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence measurements were carried out on the trihalogenated BsubPcs in toluene solutions at room temperature (Fig. 8 and Table 4). Both α-substituted BsubPcs absorb at λmax = 574 nm, while the β-substituted BsubPcs are blue-shifted with a difference of 8 nm in their λmax peaks; 568 nm for Cl-βCl3BsubPc and 560 nm for Cl-βF3BsubPc. Similarly, a 11–13 nm difference was seen in the λmax for Cl-β(NO2)3BsubPc38 and Cl-α(NO2)3BsubPc24 (each measured in chloroform solutions). The β-NO2 substituted BsubPc was more redshifted than the α-NO2 substituted. This opposite trend may be explained by the increased solvent polarity (chloroform vs. toluene).

The Stokes shifts of the trihalogenated BsubPcs range between 7 and 10 nm (Table 4), and their photoluminescence quantum yields relative to pentafluorophenoxy-BsubPc (F5PhO-BsubPc) range between 53 to 67%, with the α-substituted BsubPcs on the lower end of fluorescence.
Additionally, differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were performed on trichlorinated and trifluorinated BsubPc mixtures (Fig. 9 and Table 5) to identify all of the reduction and oxidation potentials to gain more insights on the effects of the BsubPc mixed alloyed composition on electrochemical properties. These properties are of particular importance for electron transfer processes at the frontier orbitals of molecules. Oxidation is directly associated with the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO),44 while reduction with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).45 HOMO and LUMO levels are instrumental for organic electronic applications. Similar to the UV-vis and solid-state nanoscale arrangement discussion above, the fully hydrogenated Cl-BsubPc is incorporated in this discussion as a point of comparison. All trihalogenated BsubPcs exhibited higher oxidation potentials and lower reduction potentials when compared to Cl-BsubPc.

The CV trace of Cl-αF3BsubPc shows a reversible oxidation at 1.268 V and a reduction at −0.748 V (Fig. 9a). Judging by its DPV trace, two reduction peaks (−0.761 V and −0.849 V) can be seen 0.088 V apart (Fig. 9b). These reduction processes occur at very closely spaced reduction potentials for CV, which is why they could not be resolved despite our efforts to run shorter scans with different switching potentials (Fig. S10†). The shorter CV reduction scan does however depict the semi-reversible nature of the first reduction peak at −0.748 V judging by the current bump on the return wave in the corresponding CV trace upon switching the potential (Fig. 9a and S10†). Cl-βF3BsubPc oxidizes irreversibly at 1.270 V and exhibits two overlapping reduction peaks at −0.858 V and −0.953 V (Table 5). As the corresponding DPV depicts, Cl-βF3BsubPc requires 0.064 V more potential than Cl-αF3BsubPc to be reduced for the first time and an additional 0.084 V for a second time (Fig. 9b). Considering the presence of F–F3BsubPcs in these Cl–F3BsubPc mixtures, the resulting electrochemical properties could be also governed by the axial fluoride, as previously46 seen when comparing Cl-BsubPc and F-BsubPc.
Similar to Cl-βF3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc also undergoes an irreversible oxidation at 1.306 V (Fig. 9a). This anodic oxidation shift of 0.036 V (3 F vs. 3 Cl) is consistent with literature results46 when going from Cl–F6BsubPc to Cl–Cl6BsubPc (anodic oxidation shift of 0.070 V– 6 F vs. 6 Cl). The CV reduction profile of Cl-βCl3BsubPc also contains two overlapping peaks at −0.797 V and −0.927 V, which are more clearly seen on the DPV trace (Fig. 9b). Unlike the anodic reduction shift of 0.040 V when going from Cl–F6BsubPc to Cl–Cl6BsubPc (6 F vs. 6 Cl),46 going from Cl-βF3BsubPc to Cl-βCl3BsubPc is associated with an anodic shift of 0.061 V in the first reduction peak (3 F vs. 3 Cl). Moreover, in contrast to Cl-βF3BsubPc, the DPV reduction peaks of Cl-βCl3BsubPc are 0.104 V apart (Fig. 9b). Lastly, Cl-αCl3BsubPc, like Cl-αF3BsubPc, oxidizes reversibly at 1.283 V, and the first reduction peak may be considered as a semi-reversible peak based on the current spike of return wave of the shorter CV scan (black reduction trace, Fig. 9a). The two reduction peaks on the DPV trace are seen more clearly at −0.773 V and −0.865 V (Fig. 9b).
Overall, from the acquired CV data (Fig. 9a and S10†) the oxidation process is reversible only for α-substituted BsubPcs. As DPVs demonstrate, the F3BsubPcs (α vs. β) vary 80 mV in peak oxidation, while the oxidation behavior of Cl3BsubPcs is more similar with only a 32 mV difference between the two derivatives (Fig. 9b). The CV reduction profiles of the trihalogenated BsubPcs involve overlapping processes that might be explained by their mixed (C1 and C3 isomers) composition.
Complementing CV with DPV data helps us gain valuable insight into the two electron transfer processes that occur in the −0.76 V and −0.91 V range (Fig. 9b). The DPV traces show two reduction peaks for each trihalogenated BsubPc; they are 0.084–0.088 V apart for the F3BsubPcs and 0.092–0.104 V for the Cl3BsubPcs (Fig. 9b). In the case of Cl-β(NO2)3BsubPc, the C3 isomer reduces more easily than the C1 isomer (by 27 mV),47 so perhaps the first reduction for the trihalogenated BsubPcs presented here may be assigned to their C3 isomer. The electrochemical reduction behavior of Cl3BsubPcs (α vs. β) is a lot more similar to one another than the F3BsubPcs. In the latter case, the Cl-βF3BsubPc requires an additional 0.064 V of applied potential in comparison to the α-analogue to undergo the first reduction process (Fig. 9b).
It is important to note these C1:C3 isomeric mixtures influence the reduction ability of these BsubPcs resulting in two very closely spaced peak potentials, while the oxidation remains a single peak for all four BsubPc mixtures.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy analysis
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements were also taken on all four tri-substituted BsubPcs to further understand the impact of singular substitution of BsubPc isoindole units on the overall BsubPc electronic properties (Fig. 10a). UPS experiments are done on thermally evaporated vacuum-deposited films of organic materials to measure valence molecular orbital energies, specifically the HOMO levels. As they are in the solid state, they are the mixed alloyed compositions. The HOMO levels are found to be 5.83 eV for Cl-αF3BsubPc, 5.97 eV for Cl-βF3BsubPc, 5.91 eV for Cl-αCl3BsubPc and 5.97 eV for Cl-βCl3BsubPc (Table 5). According to UPS data, the α-analogues have shallower HOMO levels than their β-analogues. This is opposite to the trend we see from oxidation energies recorded via DPV (Fig. 9b and Table 5). This deviation might be related to the variation in physical states of these molecules during each experiment (solid state films for UPS vs. relatively dilute solutions for DPV). It's worthy to note the good correlation that exists between the UPS derived HOMO levels and the oxidation peaks measured by DPV (Fig. 10b).

Initial assessment for organic photovoltaic devices
The solid-state UV-vis absorbance spectra, formed by vacuum deposition of isomeric mixtures of Cl-αCl3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc, Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc (Fig. 11a), show a slight blue shift with fluorination vs. chlorination. As well, the α derivatives are slightly red shifted compared to β derivatives. These observations align with the solution based UV-vis absorption data (Fig. 8) and also with other BsubPcs, including the base Cl-BsubPc. Going to solid films, the spectra modestly redshifted likely due to the presence of intermolecular stacking and are also modestly broader (Fig. 11a).

For clarity, the α isomeric mixtures are graphed with a solid line, while β mixtures are graphed with a broken line. 
We therefore move on to consider the influence of the mixed alloyed compositions on OPV device metrics. The goal was not to consider ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE) but rather to look at the basic metric such as open circuit voltage (VOC), fill-factor (FF) and external quantum efficiency (EQE); EQE being a key performance indicator of material efficiency of light harvesting and electron transfer. To have direct points of comparison of OPV device metrics, a device architecture was kept consistent with a baseline device utilized multiple ways in our laboratory to consider materials functionality and applications. The OPV architecture and thickness of layers is as follows: ITO (145 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (45 nm)/α6T (α-sexithiophene, 50 nm)/isomeric BsubPc mixtures or baseline Cl-BsubPc (20 nm)/BCP (7 nm)/Ag (80 nm) (Fig. 11b). Device OPV current–voltage plot and EQE characteristics are shown in Fig. 11c and d. Device metrics/characteristics are outlined in Table 6.

All four of the isomeric mixtures performed relatively well in planar heterojunction (PHJ) OPV devices in comparison to the baseline based on Cl-BsubPc when paired with α-sexithiophene (α6T) as the electron donor material (Fig. 11c and d and Table 6). Isomeric mixtures of the chlorinated analogues (Cl-αCl3BsubPc and Cl-βCl3BsubPc) outperformed the fluorinated ones (Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc), with device PCE approaching that of the baseline device given their higher JSC. All of the mixtures exhibit a loss in VOC when compared to the baseline device, however, the chlorinated mixtures (Cl-αCl3BsubPc and Cl-βCl3BsubPc) reveal moderately higher JSC and FF values than the baseline, despite the known slight blue shift in the absorbance spectra which would enable slightly less photon harvesting. This trend is particularly interesting, because it suggests that mixed materials may be facilitating with charge transport through the films i.e. enhancing electron/charge transport of the BsubPcs. The fluorinated mixtures (Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc) are lower performing than their chlorinated counterparts, with JSC showing the largest difference/variation in value. In addition, the β analogues (Cl-βCl3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc) have outperformed their α counterparts, which is also evident in the EQE plot (Fig. 11d). The EQE spectra of both Cl-βCl3BsubPc and Cl-βCl3BsubPc show an imbalance in photocurrent contribution between the α6T and the BsubPc. This does imply that device optimization of film thicknesses can be considered. Contribution from the acceptor layer is significantly higher than the donor layer in Cl-βCl3BsubPc, while the opposite is true for Cl-βF3BsubPc. The observed imbalances in EQE suggests an even higher JSC value can be achieved with further optimization in layer thickness.
Another key metric change is the VOC, which was found to reduce by 0.1 V when switching from Cl-BsubPc to Cl-βF3BsubPc and by 0.2 V when switching from Cl-BsubPc to Cl-αCl3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc and Cl-αF3BsubPc. One of many factors that governs VOC is the alignment of the LUMO levels of the BsubPcs coupled to the HOMO of α6T. This implied that if the mixtures were to be used as electron donors/hole-conductors paired with C60 as the electron acceptor/electron-conductor the resulting VOC could increase and a higher VOC is generally a desired OPV metric.
LUMO level can be estimated based on coupling the UPS HOMO energy level determination (Fig. 10a) and the onset of the solid state absorption spectrum (Fig. 11a). Electrochemistry can also estimate the LUMO energy level (Fig. 9). However each approach can have a ± aspect due to the width of the absorption spectrum or the CV/DPV peak. Therefore, we did not move to estimate the LUMO energy level as OPV device metric outcomes are more indicative of relative LUMO energy levels of the trihalogenated BsubPc mixtures relevant to Cl-BsubPc.
To confirm this hypothesis, the device architecture was altered to use a fullerene C60 as an electron acceptor layer and the mixed alloyed BsubPc isomers as the electron donor layer. The layer thicknesses for these devices are ITO (145 nm)/PEDOT:PSS (45 nm)/MoOx (5 nm)/isomeric BsubPc derivative or baseline Cl-BsubPc (10 nm)/C60 (30 nm)/BCP (7 nm)/Ag (80 nm) (Fig. 12a).

(b) OPV 1 sun illuminated current–voltage plot and (c) and EQE spectrum of C60 as electron acceptor paired with Cl-αCl3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc, Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc donors compared with an established baseline of C60 paired with Cl-BsubPc. For clarity, the α isomeric mixtures are graphed with a broken line, while β mixtures are graphed with a solid line. 
We indeed found that the VOC did increase across the board by about 0.1 V over the Cl-BsubPc donor baseline (Fig. 12b and Table 7), confirming that the HOMO/LUMO energy levels for the isomeric mixtures are slightly deeper than for the Cl-BsubPc. However, this increase in VOC did not translate into improved PCE performance. The JSC and FF metrics fell significantly, which led to a significant drop in PCE for every BsubPc alloy mixture when used as electron donor. The performance trends indicate a unique combination of effects from the location (α vs. β) and element (Cl vs. F) of the peripheral halogenation. We find that the higher JSC, FF and PCE metrics resulting from the Cl-αCl3BsubPc and Cl-βCl3BsubPc mixtures when applied as electron acceptors are reversed when these BsubPcs act as OPV electron donors. These trichlorinated BsubPcs now show lower JSC, FF and PCE than their fluorinated counterparts. We also find the same trend for the β mixtures; when applied as electron acceptors, Cl-βCl3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc show higher JSC, FF and PCE, but when applied as electron donors, they show lower JSC, FF and PCE than the α-substituted mixtures. These results clearly demonstrate that there exists a large difference between hole and electron conductivity of the isomeric mixtures.

Comparing to the results of BsubPc mixed alloys as electron acceptors versus electron donors shows first that all the mixtures (Cl-αCl3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc, Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc) are better electron conductors than they are as hole conductors. Second, we find that the β-substituted mixtures (Cl-βCl3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc) are better electron conductors (and worse hole conductors) than the α-substituted mixtures. And third, we find that the trichlorinated mixtures (Cl-αCl3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc,) are poorer hole conductors (and better electron conductors) than their fluorinated analogues. These same performance trends can be seen in the EQE measurements (Fig. 12c). The best demonstration of device performance can be found in the range between 550–650 nm where the BsubPc absorption is strongest. In this range, we see a significant drop in EQE relative to the Cl-BsubPc baseline. Device EQE trends directly match JSC trends, indicating the isomeric mixtures are the limiting factor in the generation of current and consequently device performance. The EQE curves in the C60 absorption range (between 300–450 nm) do not show as clear trends as in the BsubPc absorption range. In this range, EQE is slightly lower across the isomeric material devices, however the lack of change in C60 architecture relative to the Cl-BsubPc baseline indicates that it is not the acceptor layer which is driving these results.
The results in Fig. 12b and c both point to the potential of a lack of hole conductivity as the main driver of device performance. Since we do not see any S-shaped kinks in the J–V curves, we can conclude that the formation of trap states is not a factor in these devices. Rather, these tests indicate that potential low hole conductivity and subsequent non-radiative recombination are the factors most influential on the performance of these materials as electron donors. Therefore, given the relative data compared against established Cl-BsubPc containing OPV baselines, it is our recommendation that these mixed alloyed compositions (Cl-αCl3BsubPc, Cl-βCl3BsubPc, Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc) be applied as electron acceptors and potentially be paired with a significant set of other known electron donors, outside of α6T, including polymeric versions for OPV applications.
Conclusions
We have synthesized and characterized a set of trihalogenated BsubPcs, with fluorines or chlorines at the α- and β-positions of the macrocycle, as mixtures of C1 and C3 isomers. The molecular design covered in this work is based on the ability to enable modest changes to the photophysical properties of these BsubPcs. They were obtained via the BCl3-enabled condensation of respective phthalonitriles, some of which (3-chloro and 4-chorophthalonitriles) were synthesized in-house from their corresponding phthalic anhydrides. While β-substituted BsubPcs blue-shift in maximum absorbance, the α-substituted BsubPcs have matching UV-vis absorbance spectra and have consistently lower relative quantum yields relative to their β-analogs. Regarding electrochemical properties, only α-substituted BsubPcs feature reversible oxidation potentials. All four BsubPcs exhibit two overlapping reduction peaks ascribed to the C1 and C3 isomers present in each mixture. The electrochemical oxidative and reductive profiles (α vs. β) vary a lot more for F3BsubPcs than Cl3BsubPcs. Additionally, the α-substituted BsubPcs are more thermally stable than the β-ones. We observed varying C1/C3 isomeric ratios of these mixtures by NMR: Cl-αF3BsubPc (1.5:1), Cl-βF3BsubPc (3:1), Cl-αCl3BsubPc (2:1), and Cl-βCl3BsubPc (1:1). These non-consistent isomeric ratios indicate that both steric shielding factors as well as the electronic nature of the halogens influence the arrangement of the isoindole units in the macrocycle. Crystal structures for all four compounds were determined which indicate co-crystallization of the C1 and C3 isomers as a solid-state solution. Cl-αF3BsubPc and Cl-βF3BsubPc were found to crystallize in the same Pnma lattice as Cl-BsubPc while Cl-βCl3BsubPc, studied using the same method, was found to crystallize in the monoclinic P21/c lattice. We concluded that the larger molecular dimensions of Cl-βCl3BsubPc could not be accommodated in the same lattice as Cl-BsubPc. These isomeric BsubPc mixtures were also tested as electron donors and electron acceptors in OPVs, and direct comparisons have been provided relevant to the pre-established Cl-BsubPc containing OPV architectures (baselines). The OPV trends revealed a unique combination of effects arising from the specific location (α vs. β) and halogen (Cl vs. F) on the BsubPc periphery. Overall, these isomeric mixtures are better electron acceptors (or electron conductors) than they are electron donors (or hole conductors), where trichlorinated BsubPcs take the lead. In addition, β analogues perform better as OPV electron acceptors than their α counterparts. Therefore, the ultimate outcome is to target the peripheral β position for substitution, can be chlorination or maybe other substituents and we can accommodate a mixed alloyed composition of the C1 and C3 isomers. Also moving forward, we may achieve mono-crystal growth to establish additional physical properties such as change transport value.
Experimental
General – synthesis and characterization
Solvents were purchased from Caledon Laboratories Ltd. (Ontario, Canada) and used as received. Reagents were purchased from a selection of suppliers: Oakwood Chemicals (3-fluorophthalonitrile, 4-fluorophthalonitrile, 4-chloropthalic anhydride, 3-chloropthalic anhydride); Sigma Aldrich (boron trichloride in 1 M heptane). High pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis was conducted using a Waters 2695 separation module with a Waters 2998 photodiode array fitted with a SunFire™ C18 3.5 μm 3.0 × 150 mm column. HPLC grade acetonitrile and distilled in glass N,N-dimethylformamide were used as the mobile phase eluted at 0.6 mL min−1 at a composition of 80:20 (v:v). HPLC was used to monitor each BsubPc reaction. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy was enabled by a PerkinElmer Lambda 1050 using PerkinElmer quartz cuvette with 10 mm path length. Photoluminescence spectra was measured using a PerkinElmer LS 55 in toluene at room temperature by excitation at the second shoulder absorbance in the 500 nm range (typically 8–15 nm blueshifted before the maximum peak of the BsubPc). The fluorescence quantum yields (Φ) were calculated using the formula:49Φ = ΦR(I/IR)(ODR/OD)(n2/nR2), where I is the integrated fluorescence intensity, OD is the optical density (i.e. absorbance) at the corresponding excitation wavelength, and n is the refractive index of the solvent, toluene for this study. The subscript R is the reference fluorophore, F5PhO-BsubPc, with a reported Φ = 0.42 (ref. 50) in toluene at room temperature. This is a standard operating procedure from literature49 and well established in our laboratory50–52 for a wide range of BsubPcs with various maximum absorbance shifts in energy. Low resolution mass spectra (LRMS) and high-resolution spectra (HRMS) were collected using Waters GC Premier and time-of-flight spectrometer with an electron ionization source (TOF-EI MS). Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were collected from a 600 MHz Agilent DD2 NMR Spectrometer and a 500 MHz Agilent DD2 NMR Spectrometer. 1H NMR spectra were referenced to the deuterated solvent peak (CDCl3, δH = 7.26 ppm) and 19F NMR spectra were shifted by that same ppm difference. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was run on TA Instrument Q50 under nitrogen and a heating rate of 5 °C min−1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was conducted on a TA Instrument Q1000 under nitrogen via the following temperature profile: (1) heating to 325 °C or 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, (2) cooling to 20 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1, (3) heating to 325 °C or 350 °C at a rate of 10 °C min−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) were carried out using a Bioanalytical Systems C3 electrochemical workstation. All samples were analyzed in nitrogen degassed dichloromethane solutions of 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate at scan rates of 100 mV s−1. Multiple cycles were ran for each molecule to ensure the CV traces presented here are a representation of the molecule once it has reached equilibrium. A conventional three-electrode system was used – 2 mm platinum disk as the working electrode, a 0.5 mm platinum wire as counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference electrode. The resulting BsubPc potentials were corrected to the half-wave reduction potential of decamethylferrocene (Me10Fc+/Me10Fc) (E1/2,red = −0.012 V vs. Ag/AgCl, previously reported53) used as an internal standard. All X-ray crystal structure data was collected using a Bruker Kappa APEX DUO CCD diffractometer. Bond lengths and other structural features were analyzed and measured using Mercury CSD 4.3. Hirshfeld surface analysis was performed using CrystalExplorer17.
The UV source in UPS is non-monochromatic He Kα with a radiation energy of 21.22 eV. The takeoff angles for UPS measurements is 88°. The UPS was performed in an ultrahigh vacuum environment with a base pressure of 10−9 Torr, brought to 10−7 Torr with He insertion during the measurement. The work function and valence band maximum of the films were combined to obtained ionization energy. The UPS samples were fabricated through physical vapor deposition on highly oriented pyrolitic graphite (HOPG) substrates to eliminate charging.
General – OPV methods (materials, device fabrication and characterization)
Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Heraeus), alpha-sexithiophene (α-6T, Lumtec), bathocuproine (BCP, Lumtec), silver (Ag, Angstrom), and molybdenum oxide (MoOx, Lumtec) were purchased and used as received. C60 (SES Research) was purchased and purified once by train sublimation before use. Chloro-boron subphthalocyanine (Cl-BsubPc) and related derivatives were synthesized in-house by previously reported methods and purified twice by train sublimation before use.
OPVs were fabricated on 25 mm × 25 mm glass substrates coated with pre-patterned ITO (Thin Film Devices, Inc.). Substrates underwent cleaning with Alconox solution and solvents, were coated with PEDOT:PSS, baked on a hot plate for 15 minutes, and then transferred to a custom-built thermal evaporation system attached to a glovebox for the remainder of device fabrication. All subsequent layers were thermally evaporated from boron nitride crucibles at a nominal rate of 1 Å s−1, at ∼10–7 Torr for organic layers and ∼10–6 Torr for silver. A shadow mask used for the deposition of silver defined a device area of 0.4 cm2.
To measure JV curves, devices were illuminated with a 100 W Xe arc lamp (Oriel) with an AM1.5G standard filter in place. Light intensity was calibrated to 1 sun using a certified 818-SL/DB silicon photodetector with an FSR-KG5 filter in place. The actual spectrum measured from this lamp in the Bender laboratory glovebox set up is captured in Fig. S11.†JV measurements of all devices were performed using a Keithley 2401 low voltage source meter. To measure EQEs, devices were illuminated with a 300 W Xe arc lamp (Oriel) with an in-line Cornerstone™ 260 1/4 m monochromator and wavelength scans were performed using a Newport 2938-R optical power meter. The corresponding currents were converted to EQEs using a reference wavelength scan of the calibrated 818-SL/DB silicon photodetector.

Design, System, Application
We specifically designed and engineered a mixed alloyed composition of organic-based macrocyclic compounds, boron subphthalocyanines (BsubPcs). The molecular design principle involved applying three halogen peripheral substitutions (fluorine or chlorine) either in the alpha or beta (α or β) position. This enabled a mixture of C3 and C1 stereoisomers forming the first example of a BsubPc mixed alloyed composition named as Cl-(α or β)X3BsubPcs (X = Cl or F) and was confirmed through single crystal growth and diffraction analysis. In the past a non-specifically engineered mixed alloyed composition of related macrocycles, boron subnaphthalocyanines (BsubNcs), had positive impact on organic solar cell (OSC) performance. We engineered the Cl-(α or β)X3BsubPcs alloyed compositions into OSCs as both electron donors and electron acceptors and have confirmed they have good light absorption capability and good electron conductivity. We also found the mixed Cl-(α or β)X3BsubPcs are better as electron acceptors than electron donors; the β substituted BsubPcs perform better as electron acceptors than the α counterparts; and the chlorinated BsubPcs are better performers than the fluorinated analogues. This then outlines further engineering considerations of alternative BsubPc mixed alloyed compositions to have an even higher positive impact on OSCs performance and ultimate lifetime stability.
