    , Accepted 7th June 2016First published on 17th June 2016AbstractLow-cost and high energy conversion efficiency are the crucial factors for large scale application of solar cells. In recent years, a promising high cost-performance photovoltaic technology, organometal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs), has attracted great attention. However, most of the reported high efficiencies were obtained on a small working area of about 0.1 cm2 with the material utilization ratio of only 1% during film deposition, which actually hinders the advancement in future application of PSCs. Here we present the soft-cover deposition (SCD) method where surface wettability, solution viscosity and thermal crystallization are the processing key factors for the deposition of uniform perovskite films with high material utilization ratios. Scaling-up, pinhole-free, large crystal grains and rough-border-free perovskite films were obtained over a large area of 51 cm2, which were processed continuously in ambient air with a significant enhancement in the material utilization ratio up to ∼80%. Highly reproducible power conversion efficiencies up to 17.6% were achieved in unit cells with a working area of 1 cm2, leading to a high overall cost-performance. We believe that the present SCD technology will benefit the low-cost fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells and open up a route for the deposition of other solution processed thin-films.

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells are a promising low-cost and highly efficient photovoltaic technology. However, there’s still a big challenge in forming large area and uniform perovskite films with a high material utilization ratio. Here we provide a novel continuous processing method, soft-cover deposition, to control the formation of perovskite films in ambient air. High quality films were successfully deposited with less structural defects and high material utilization ratios. Excellent photovoltaic performance was also achieved in a 1 cm2 unit solar cell, highly reproducible over a large area. The present deposition technology paves the way for future application of high cost-performance perovskite solar cells and the formation of solution processed thin-films.

1 Introduction
Hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been regarded as the most promising photovoltaic technology achieving high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) approaching the best silicon solar cells.1–10 It benefits from the light harvesting materials of organic–inorganic halide perovskites with the formula of ABX3 (A = Cs+, CH3NH3+, HC(NH2)2+; B = Pb2+, Sn2+; X = Cl−, Br−, I−, etc.), which exhibit excellent performance owing to their advantages of a large absorption coefficient, high carrier mobility, favourable direct band gap and ambipolar property, etc. However, there are still remaining challenges in the advancement of future application of PSCs, such as the poor device stability and the huge difficulty in forming large area uniform perovskite films with a high material utilization ratio. For the latter challenge, the deposition processing of perovskite films is of importance to overcome the difficulties in reducing the density of structural defects like nanoscale pinholes, crystal grain boundaries and broken smoothness at rough-borders that can seriously cut down the film quality and the device efficiency.11–16 To fabricate high quality perovskite films, various thin-film deposition technologies, including spin-coating,17–23 vapor assisted deposition,24–29 spray-deposition,13 doctor blading,11,16,30–32 slot-die coating12 and printing32,33–35 have been proposed with successful strategies for controllable crystal growth.
Among these deposition technologies, spin-coating is the most widely used technique in the laboratory research on PSCs with a reported device efficiency of over 20% on small size devices (∼0.1 cm2) and of ∼15.0% on larger ones (∼1 cm2).36 However, the material utilization ratio was always as low as 1% in spin-coating processing, which severely hinders the large scale application of PSCs. Non-spin-coating methods with high material utilization ratio, such as the doctor blade technique,11 slot-die coating,12 and printing methods,37–40 have been applied for the fabrication of perovskite films and PCEs of 10% to 15% have been reported, much less than that of the spin-coating device. It is probably owing to the great difficulty in depositing thin uniform perovskite films over a large area using a low-cost method. For example, the degree of curvature of FTO glass is about 50 μm m−1 and it increases to over 100 μm m−1 after thermal treatment, which will make it impossible to deposit μm-thick uniform perovskite films over a large area by a low-cost method like doctor blade coating. Therefore, it is highly desired to advance a cost-effective, scaling up, simple processing and air-operable film deposition technology for the growth of high quality perovskite films.
We herein report a novel solution processing method, soft-cover deposition (SCD), where we use a soft-cover with high surface wettability to spread perovskite precursor solution on a large area preheated substrate. The perovskite precursor solution was thermally stable at the boiling point because of the additional function of the soft-cover blocking the solvent evaporation into air. As a result, a pinhole-free, large grain size, and rough-border-free perovskite film is present with a large area smooth surface of 51 cm2 with a material utilization ratio of ∼80%. PSCs fabricated through a SCD route exhibit a device efficiency up to 17.6% with high reproducibility. To our best knowledge, PSCs are demonstrated for the first time with high efficiency and high material utilization ratio by a non-spin-coating, in-air solution processed, continuous deposition technology.
2 Results and discussion
The major steps of SCD are illustrated in Fig. 1A, operating with the assembly of a computer controlled mechanical hand and a heating bed. At first, we heated a substrate on a hotplate for 30 s at a displayed temperature of 210 °C (Fig. 1A-I), and then dropped a certain amount of perovskite precursor solution onto the substrate (Fig. 1A-II). After that we covered a piece of soft film on the liquid precursor (Fig. 1A-III). The precursor solution spread fast under the soft-cover when the surface has good wettability. In addition, the precursor solution was stable on the preheated substrate at a temperature at the solution’s boiling point because the soft-cover blocks the solvent evaporation from the thin liquid film into the air. Then after about 25 s the soft-cover was peeled off by the programmed mechanical hand, which clenched one end of the soft-cover and moved from one side to the other at a certain speed. Once the solution was exposed to the air, the solvent started evaporating and the crystallization of perovskite films occurred simultaneously (Fig. 1A-IV). The mechanical hand was set to move only on the x-axis (the horizontal line) steadily, and its speed can be controlled in the range of 5–500 mm s−1 using programs.

(I) preheat the substrate, (II) drop the precursor, (III) cover the polyimide film, and (IV) peel the polyimide film. (B) One droplet of perovskite precursor with half under the soft-cover. (C) The crystallized perovskite film after peeling off the soft-cover and (D) the profile along the red line in (C). 
The x–y plane flatness of the perovskite film in SCD depends strongly on the precursor spreading process. It is required that the soft-cover should have good wettability to facilitate the precursor spreading. Furthermore, the candidate soft-cover should have a good thermal tolerance at a relatively high temperature for the evaporation of an often used solvent like DMSO (Dimethylsulfoxide) or GBL (Gamma-butyrolactone) that has a high boiling point around 200 °C. We thus choose a polyimide film (PI) and a polytetrafluoroethylene film (PTFE) because they are known for high heat deflection temperature. The wettability on the soft-cover surface can be tested by measuring contact angles, and a smaller contact angle corresponds to better wettability. We tested the contact angles when the precursor (2 μl, 1 M in DMSO) was dropped onto the surfaces of the NiO/FTO substrate, PI, and PTFE at room temperature in ambient air. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the average contact angles on these surfaces were 38.9°, 4.6°, and 70.5°, respectively. The contact angle on the PI film is much smaller than that on the NiO/FTO substrate, which indicates that the PI film can facilitate the precursor spreading on the NiO/FTO substrate, even though the precursor shows worse wettability on the substrate surface alone. The PI film, exhibiting excellent wettability and high temperature tolerance up to ca. 360 °C, was therefore selected as the soft-cover in SCD.
To illustrate the effect of soft-cover on the formation of perovskite films, we investigated the crystallization of one droplet of perovskite precursor (2 μl, 1 M in DMSO) on a heating bed by a 3-D super depth of the field optical microscope, with the right half of the droplet covered by the soft-cover (Fig. 1B). The 3-D optical microscope can collect pictures from different heights and synthesize them to form a 3-D picture, and thus we can obtain the profile of the surface. For the left half exposed to air, the perovskite crystal was formed from the edge of the solution droplet to the centre with a large roughness, as profiled across the red dashed line (Fig. 1C and D). This rough surface is a common phenomenon in a crystallizing or drying process of a solution droplet, because the earlier crystallized or dried parts generated strong capillary force, resulting in the material accumulation around them.41 In contrast, for the right half of the droplet under the softcover, the precursor solution spread quickly over a large area and formed a thin liquid film. When the soft-cover was peeled off, the solvent started evaporating and the perovskite crystal formed in situ rapidly. The perovskite film surface was much smoother than that without the soft-cover. In addition, the thickness of the perovskite film was much smaller owing to the desirable solution spreading over a large area under the soft-cover. We note that the exact film thickness under the soft-cover cannot be elicited from the profile due to the limited precision, and a more precise thickness will be given later in this work. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the appearance of perovskite films deposited by spin-coating and SCD for 35 μl solution on a 51 cm2 substrate. The spin-coating film has worse coverage because of the poor wettability of precursor solution spreading difficultly over a large area substrate. In contrast, the SCD film is smooth and homogeneous on a large area.
We characterized SCD perovskite films by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and time-resolved photoluminescence. As the SEM images in Fig. 2A and B show, the SCD film is pinhole free and has a full coverage on the substrate. The crystal grains are in the range of 500 nm–1.2 μm with an average size of around 800 nm, which is much larger than that by spin-coating (Fig. S3, ESI†). Fig. 2C shows the photoluminescence (PL) decay curves of SCD and spin-coating perovskite films that were deposited on glass with a comparable thickness of 350 nm. The PL decay curves were fitted by a stretched exponential distribution with β about 0.74 and the lifetime was 135 ns for SCD perovskite films and 96 ns for spin-coating films, suggesting a longer charge diffusion length in SCD films. It is in good agreement with the large crystal grains in SCD films owing to the reduced density of grain boundaries. The XRD pattern of the SCD perovskite film shows sharp and intensive characteristic diffraction peaks locating at 14.12°, 20.12°, 28.46°, 31.85°, which are assigned to (110), (112), (220) and (310) respectively, suggesting an orthorhombic perovskite crystal structure with good crystallinity (Fig. 2D). The disappearance of the PbI2(001) peak at 12.67° indicates the full conversion of PbI2 to perovskite. Thus, these characterization techniques support potently that SCD is capable of preparing high quality perovskite films.

The solid lines in C are the fitted lines by stretched exponential distribution with β about 0.74. 
The SCD has a very different film formation mechanism from the typical spin-coating method. The latter generates a strong centrifugal force during the high speed rotation to remove most solvent of the liquid precursor to form a quasi-solid film. The quasi-solid film possesses huge viscosity to maintain the film’s shape during thermal evaporation of the remaining solvent. In SCD or other non-spin-coating processing, the solvent is removed mainly by thermal evaporation and the perovskite crystals formed directly from the liquid precursor instead of from the intermediate quasi-solid phase. The direct crystallization in the liquid phase benefits the crystal growth to a large size, deriving from the easier material transfer in the liquid phase than that in the quasi-solid phase. However, for non-spin-coating methods, there exists an inclination to form rough-borders like bulges or gaps between crystal domains owing to the liquid convection during thermal evaporation of the precursor solution.11,13,16,31,32 The high roughness and poor coverage can terribly impair the performance of thin-film photovoltaic devices. Generally, as high viscosity can suppress the convection, it is reasonable to conclude that solvents of high viscosity are conducive to smoothen the rough-borders in perovskite films. We compared the viscosities of commonly used solvents DMSO, GBL, DMF (dimethyl formamide) and DMCA (dimethylacetamide) (Table S1, ESI†). It shows that DMSO and GBL have high viscosity and are suitable as the solvent.
We tested the viscosity when the concentration of perovskite precursor solution varied from 0–1.5 M for DMSO and from 0–1.0 M for GBL at different temperatures (Fig. S4A and B, ESI†). The viscosity of the precursor solution increases with the concentration for both DMSO and GBL. We also compared the wettability of perovskite precursor solution on the surface of the soft-cover. It shows that a higher concentration yields poor wettability as the contact angle increases (Fig. S4C, ESI†). We note that DMSO solution has higher viscosity but lower wettability than those for GBL, and therefore we add GBL into DMSO to make a mixed solvent to balance the viscosity and wettability of the precursor solution.
Considering the complication of the effect of viscosity and wettability on the perovskite film morphology, we here provide preliminary results of the surface roughness formed with different solvent recipes. The molar ratio between GBL and DMSO in the perovskite precursors was set in the range from 1:11 to 11:1. The film morphology, measured by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), is shown in Fig. S5A–F and a–f (ESI†). The film with the ratio of 1:7 shows a smooth surface and a large grain size. At a higher ratio, the surface shows rough-borders or rings, while at a lower ratio the grain size turns small. To investigate the roughness of the films, we measured the surfaces by atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Fig. 3A–C). As shown in Fig. 3A, the film at the ratio of 2:1 has an overall surface roughness of 56.8 nm mainly owing to the obvious bulge border as that in Fig. S5D (ESI†). The profile along the white line across the border exhibits a height of 150 nm, which is large enough to make breaks in a tens of nanometer-thick film like a charge transporting layer that is overlaid on the perovskite film. Fig. 3B shows that the film with the ratio of GBL and DMSO at 11:1 has rings, as observed in Fig. S5F (ESI†). It was reported that the coffee-ring was formed when the solution concentration was lower than 0.56 M.31 The surface roughness is 47.2 nm and the profile of the rings along the white line presents 3 peaks, with an interval of 2–4 μm and heights of 79 nm to 110 nm. In comparison, the film with the ratio of 1:7 is smooth with no obvious rough-borders or rings, and the surface roughness is only 9.9 nm, which is probably owing to a good balance between the viscosity and wettability (Fig. S4D, ESI†).
 Fig. 3  The x–y plane perovskite film morphology measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The film was formed by precursor solution with a mixed solvent of GBL and DMSO at molar ratios of 2:1 (A), 11:1 (B) and 1:7 (C). The height profiles of the films were measured along the white line and fitted by the Gaussian function (red lines). 
The thickness of the perovskite film is very important for the light absorbance and the efficiency of PSCs. We controlled the z-axis thickness of SCD films by tuning the processing parameters like the precursor concentration (0.1 M to 0.9 M), heating bed temperature (150 °C to 270 °C) and peeling speed (5 mm s−1 to 200 mm s−1). Fig. 4A shows the UV-Visible light absorbance spectra of these perovskite films, with a steep cutoff at the wavelength about 780 nm in accordance with a MAPbI3 band gap of about 1.58 eV. To show the variation in light absorbance with the change of SCD processing parameters, we choose the UV-Visible light absorbance at the wavelength of 700 nm as an index, which is proportional to the film thickness according to the Beer–Lambert law. This is further confirmed by the SEM measurement of the film cross-section, where the thickness of the perovskite film varies in the range of 50 nm–2 μm by tuning the SCD parameters (Fig. 4B). When the solution concentration increased from 0.1 M to 0.9 M, the light absorbance increased almost linearly from 0.3 to 1.6 with the corresponding thickness of 50 nm to 1.3 ± 0.2 μm. The increase in the surface temperature resulted in an increase of the light absorbance from about 0.6 to 1.8 with the thickness of 150 nm to 1.8 ± 0.3 μm, which is possibly due to more solution accumulated by capillary attraction from the perovskite grains fast crystallized at high temperature. As the peeling speed increased from 5 mm s−1 to 75 mm s−1, the light absorbance decreased from 1.7 to 0.7. The large absorbance at a slow speed might be caused similarly by the accumulated solution around previously crystallized perovskite grains during the slow peeling process. The absorbance rose up to about 1.3 when the peeling speed increased from 75 mm s−1 to 200 mm s−1, which is likely due to more solution remaining on the hot substrate with less solution adhering to the fast peeled soft-cover.

The UV-Visible light absorbance spectra of perovskite films prepared at different precursor concentrations from 0.1 M to 0.9 M, heating bed temperatures from 150 °C to 270 °C, and peeling speeds of 5 mm s−1 to 200 mm s−1 (A). The UV-Visible light absorbance at 700 nm and the thicknesses derived from cross-section SEMs of the perovskite films for the corresponding parameters (B). 
A high material utilization ratio can enhance the overall cost-performance. We calculated the material utilization ratio in SCD where 35 μl, 0.5 M precursor solution was deposited over a 6 cm × 8.5 cm substrate (51 cm2) at a heating temperature of 210 °C and a peeling speed of 55 mm s−1. We obtained a 600 nm thick perovskite film with an overall material utilization ratio of 82%. For spin-coating, according to the general protocol, 60 μl of 1.45 M precursor is used for a 2 cm × 2 cm substrate to obtain a 350 nm thick film by tuning the spin speed, and then only 1% perovskite could be deposited on the substrate. It demonstrates that the material utilization ratio in SCD increases 80 times than in spin-coating. The SCD perovskite film crystallized quickly at a relatively high temperature, which will reduce the time cost for large scale fabrication of PSCs. To demonstrate the perovskite transformation degree in such a short period, we tested the crystal phases by XRD for films at different annealing times from 0 s to 120 s. In Fig. S6A (ESI†), the XRD patterns show the disappearance of the PbI2(001) peak at 12.67° when the annealing time equals 20 s. It suggests that such a short period of annealing is enough for a thorough perovskite transformation. Note that heating temperature is pretty high and the whole process was conducted in air; it’s not wise to heat for a much longer period. We also tested the SCD perovskite film prepared at a temperature of 130 °C (Fig. S6B, ESI†). It took 10 min of thermal annealing for a thorough conversion to perovskite. Long post-treatment for more than 10 min can lead to the decomposition of perovskites, since the PbI2 peak appeared again due to the MAI loss during long-time heating.42,43
We fabricated PSCs with the structure of FTO/NiO/MAPbI3/PCBM/BCP/Ag, as the SEM image of the cross-section shows in Fig. 5A, with a 20 nm thick NiO film as the hole transporting layer, a 50 nm thick PCBM film as the electron transporting layer, and a 10 nm thick BCP film as the hole blocking layer. The SCD perovskite film is ∼600 nm thick prepared with the precursor concentration of 0.5 M, the heating bed temperature of 210 °C and the peeling speed of 55 mm s−1. The PCBM and BCP layers were still prepared by spin-coating, which limited us to the fabrication of unit devices with a working area of ∼1 cm2. The performances of the champion device were measured by the current-density (J)–voltage (V) characterization shown in Fig. 5B. During forward scanning from 0 V to 1.2 V, it yielded a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 21.8 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.02 V, a fill factor (FF) of 0.787 and a PCE of 17.6%. During reverse scanning from 1.2 V to 0 V, the J–V curve shows very small hysteresis compared to forward scanning. In Fig. 5C, it shows the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device with a homogeneous light response in the whole UV-visible light range. The calculated JSC from the EQE spectrum is 21.2 mA cm−2, close to the JSC value from J–V characterization. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), we divided the perovskite film into 9 sub-areas and fabricated 36 cells in 4 batches to evaluate the uniformity of SCD films. The fluctuations in PCEs for cells from different sub-areas are very small, indicating a high reproducibility based on the large area uniform SCD perovskite films. The histogram of PCEs for all cells is given in Fig. 5D showing narrow deviation.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we introduced a novel soft-cover deposition (SCD) method to deposit high quality perovskite films in ambient air, which is a continuous deposition process with a high material utilization ratio 80 times higher than that of the widely used spin-coating method. Via SCD, we achieved uniform pinhole-free, large crystal grain size and rough-border free perovskite films over a large area of 51 cm2. Unit solar cells fabricated via SCD perovskite films obtained PCEs up to 17.6% in a working area of 1 cm2 with very small hysteresis and high reproducibility. More research studies are still needed to optimize the large area production of other nanoscale layers to further enlarge the device working area. We believe that the present SCD technique will benefit the low-cost fabrication of highly efficient perovskite solar cells, and it also provides a wider view of pursuing high quality perovskite films for other solution processes.
4 Experimental
Precursors for SCD
All reagents were used as received. PbI2 (99%) and DMSO (dehydrated) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and MAI (98%) and GBL (dehydrated) were from TCI. The precursors for SCD were 0.5 M PbI2 and MAI with a GBL/DMSO molar ratio of 1:7, that is 461 mg of PbI2 and 158.9 mg of MAI dissolved in 2 ml of solvents, which are composed of 0.25 ml of GBL and 1.75 ml of DMSO. For other mixture solvents, 461 mg of PbI2 and 158.9 mg of MAI were dissolved in 0.17 ml of GBL and 1.83 ml of DMSO (1:11), 0.67 ml of GBL and 1.33 ml of DMSO (1:2), 1.33 ml of GBL and 0.67 ml of DMSO (2:1), 1.75 ml of GBL and 0.25 ml of DMSO (7:1) and 1.83 ml of GBL and 0.17 ml of DMSO (11:1). The precursors were stored at 70 °C for 12 hours.
SCD process
The substrates were preheated at 150–270 °C for 30 s on a heating bed. For such a substrate, precursor solution was added at the centre of the substrate, and a piece of PI film was used as the soft-cover onto the precursor instantly. We also tried to put the soft-cover on the substrate and then dropped the solution at the edge of the soft-cover. For both cases, the precursor would spread on the whole substrate under the soft-cover. The peeling process was conducted using a moving mechanical hand clenching one end of the soft-cover. We note that the temperature of 210 °C was the display temperature of the hotplate but not the surface temperature of the substrate. Since the heat exchange is fast on the FTO surface while the glass has relatively low thermal conductivity, the FTO surface temperature is often lower than the display temperature of the hotplate. We tested roughly using an infrared thermometer (FLIR TG165) that when the display temperatures of the hotplate are 150 °C, 180 °C, 210 °C, 240 °C and 270 °C, the surface temperatures of FTO are about 55 °C, 65 °C, 75 °C, 85 °C, and 95 °C for preheating about 30 s–1 min. The hotplate we used was an IKA C-MAD HS 7. All the of the SCD process was conducted in air with humidity of about 50% with a fluctuation of 10%.
Device fabrication
Patterned FTO substrates (7–10 Ohm □−1, Pilkington Tec 8), were cleaned with a neutral detergent, and then sonicated in soap water, pure water, acetone and alcohol for 10 min orderly. The cleaned FTO was treated by UV light with a wavelength of about 180 nm for 30 min.
NiO films were prepared by spray pyrolysis in air. 20 ml of acetonitrile solution of nickel acetylacetonate (0.04 M) was sprayed using an air nozzle onto the clean FTO glasses, which were heated to 500 °C on a hot plate at first, at a distance of about 15 cm, using clean dry air as the carrier gas, and then the coated FTO glasses were kept at 500 °C for 10 min to promote NiO crystallization. The glasses were collected at a temperature higher than 100 °C.
The perovskite films were mainly prepared by SCD. For comparison with spin-coating, the perovskite films were also prepared via a modified 1-step method as described by N. J. Jeon et al.17 Briefly, a perovskite precursor solution in the mixed solvent of GBL:DMSO (7:3) was spin-coated onto the NiO/FTO substrates at 1000 rpm for 12 s and 5000 rpm for 30 s, and toluene drop-cast at the tenth second in the second high rotating speed step, followed by annealing at 100 °C for 10 min. These procedures were operated in a N2 filled glove box.
After cooling down, chlorobenzene solution of PCBM (20 mg ml−1) was spin-coated at 1800 rpm for 30 seconds, and then dried at 70 °C on a hot plate for 15 min. After cooling down, 150 μl of saturated methanol solution of bathocuproine (BCP) was dropped onto the top of PCBM during 6000 rpm spin-coating and dried again on a 70 °C hot plate for 15 min in a N2 filled glove box. 200 nm silver contacts were evaporated to form the back contact of the devices at a rate of 0.2 Å s−1 (pressure ca. 2.3 × 10−4 Pa) for the first 20 nm and <0.8 Å s−1 for the consecutive 180 nm.
Characterization
The current-density (J)–voltage (V) curves (J–V curves) were measured using a solar simulator (Newport, Oriel Class A, 91195A) with a source meter (Keithley 2400) at 100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5G illumination, and a calibrated Si-reference cell certified by the NREL. The J–V curves for all devices were measured by masking the active area with a metal mask of 1.02 cm2. The J–V curves were scanned by reverse (from 1.2 V to 0 V) and forward (from 0 V to 1.2 V) scans. The step voltage was fixed at 10 mV and the dwell time at 10 ms for each step, which is a set delay at each voltage step before measuring each current. Monochromatic incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured using a monochromatic incident light of 1 × 1016 photons cm−2 in direct current mode (CEP-2000BX, Bunko-Keiki). The top-view SEM morphology and cross-sectional SEMs of the perovskite films by SCD or spin-coating were obtained using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The absorption spectra were obtained using a UV/Vis spectrometer (SHIMADZU, UV-2450 UV/Vis Spectrophotometer). Structural and phase characterization of perovskite films were recorded using an X-ray diffractometer (Ultima IV) with Cu K radiation (=1.54 Å) at a speed of 2° min−1. The precursor viscosities were tested at room temperature and atmospheric pressure using a capillary viscometer, in which the capillary tube is 1 mm, and the viscometer constant is 0.07161 mm2 s−2. The time t of each object precursor passing the capillary tube was recorded, and the dynamic viscosities μ (Pa s) were calculated from the time t (s) and the density of the precursor ρ (mg cm−3) using the following equation μ = 07161tρ × 10−3(1) The top-view photo and profiles of the crystallized perovskite droplet with or without the soft-cover were obtained from the 3-D super depth of the field microscope VHX-1000E. The contact angles were recorded using the contact angle meter Dataphysics OCA50 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure with 2 μl of precursors. The time-resolved photoluminescence decay of the perovskite film was measured using a Horiba Fluorolog-3 Time Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) system with an excitation wavelength at 460 nm, and the charge carrier lifetimes were obtained by fitting the curves into a stretched exponential equation as follows, (2)

Broader context
Perovskite solar cells are a promising low-cost and highly efficient photovoltaic technology. However, there’s still a big challenge in forming large area and uniform perovskite films with a high material utilization ratio. Here we provide a novel continuous processing method, soft-cover deposition, to control the formation of perovskite films in ambient air. High quality films were successfully deposited with less structural defects and high material utilization ratios. Excellent photovoltaic performance was also achieved in a 1 cm2 unit solar cell, highly reproducible over a large area. The present deposition technology paves the way for future application of high cost-performance perovskite solar cells and the formation of solution processed thin-films.


 	Fig. 1  SCD illustration and the effect of soft-cover. (A) The schematic of the four steps in SCD under ambient conditions. (I) preheat the substrate, (II) drop the precursor, (III) cover the polyimide film, and (IV) peel the polyimide film. (B) One droplet of perovskite precursor with half under the soft-cover. (C) The crystallized perovskite film after peeling off the soft-cover and (D) the profile along the red line in (C).	 

 	Fig. 2  The top-view SEM images of perovskite film by spin-coating (A) and SCD (B), the TRPL curves of perovskite films by spin-coating and SCD with excitation wavelength at 460 nm (C), and the X-ray diffraction patterns of perovskite films by spin-coating and SCD (D). The solid lines in C are the fitted lines by stretched exponential distribution with β about 0.74.	 

 	Fig. 3  The x–y plane perovskite film morphology measured by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The film was formed by precursor solution with a mixed solvent of GBL and DMSO at molar ratios of 2:1 (A), 11:1 (B) and 1:7 (C). The height profiles of the films were measured along the white line and fitted by the Gaussian function (red lines).	 

 	Fig. 4  The z-axis thickness control in SCD. The UV-Visible light absorbance spectra of perovskite films prepared at different precursor concentrations from 0.1 M to 0.9 M, heating bed temperatures from 150 °C to 270 °C, and peeling speeds of 5 mm s−1 to 200 mm s−1 (A). The UV-Visible light absorbance at 700 nm and the thicknesses derived from cross-section SEMs of the perovskite films for the corresponding parameters (B).	 

 	Fig. 5  The cross-section SEM of the PSC device (A), the device performance (B), the external quantum efficiency spectrum (C) and the statistical analysis of PCEs of 4 batches of devices (9 cells per batch) (D).
