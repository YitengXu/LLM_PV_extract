The photovoltaic performance of P3HT-nanohybrids with C60 derivative PCBM was evaluated. The device made from 1:1 blends of P3HT-NPs:PCBM showed reasonably good photovoltaic performance with a power conversion efficiency of 2.5% under standard test conditions (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).Polymeric and oligomeric π-conjugated systems have gained tremendous scientific interest due to their unique electronic properties and have been widely applied in organic field effect transistors (OFETs), organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), and organic-based photovoltaics (OPVs).1 However, organic based thin-film devices such as bulk heterojunction solar cells are strongly dependent on the polymer morphology and their molecular interactions with the substrates and other components in the blends.2 Linear conjugated polymers (LCPs) exhibit very complex self-assembly behaviour due to their structural flexibility, longer chain length, and wide molecular weight distribution. It is essential to develop LCPs having both improved optoelectronic properties and organisable self-assembly properties. To improve the progress of organic-based devices, synthetic methods need to be developed to make well-defined three-dimensional structures with a controlled size, shape, and delicately organized self-assembly properties.Significant research efforts have been focused on incorporating LCPs onto a variety of nanoparticle surfaces to enhance not only their optical responses but also to improve guidable self-assembly properties.2b,3 Among such nanostructures, functionalized silicas, silsesquioxanes, and ormosils have provided rich platforms for the covalent attachment of polymers, macromolecules, and dendrimers for a variety of applications in microelectronics.4 For example, these organic–inorganic hybrid structures have been incorporated into organic light emitting materials to improve thermal and color stabilities, brightness, and quantum efficiencies.5 Except for a couple of reports,6,7 the application of donor and acceptor functionalized siloxane nanostructures for OPVs has not been explored. Herein, we demonstrate tailoring a semiconducting polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene), onto a siloxane core structure using direct hydrolysis and condensation of P3HT-trialkoxysilane. A synthetic method was developed to prepare P3HT-grafted siloxane nanoparticles (P3HT-NPs). Their photovoltaic performance was evaluated by blending with various compositions of the C60 derivative PCBM.Preparation of P3HT-NPs by direct hydrolysis and condensation of P3HT-trialkoxysilaneThe direct hydrolysis and condensation of ligand-functionalized organotrialkoxysilanes is found to be the most effective way to tailor higher loads of organic content onto an inorganic core. Recently, we developed a modified Stöber method to prepare perylenediimide-functionalized silsesquioxane nanoparticles, having controllable sizes ranging from 30 nm to 200 nm with a narrow polydispersity.7 The application of this modified Stöber method to prepare P3HT-functionalized siloxane nanoparticles is depicted in Scheme 1. The silane precursor of P3HT 3 was prepared via subsequent synthetic steps starting from 2,5-dibromo-3-hexylthiophene. Bromide-terminated P3HT was prepared by Grignard metathesis (GRIM) polymerization as described by McCullough and co-workers,8 (see ESI†) and followed by carboxylation of chain-end bromine to obtain carboxylic acid-terminated P3HT 1 (Mn = 10000 to 12500 g mol−1 deduced from 1H NMR data by integration of main signals to signals from the chain end group). Upon the esterification of compound 1 with 2-hydroxyethylacrylate, the silane precursor 3 was prepared by hydrosilylation of compound 2 with triethoxysilane in the presence of 2 mol% chloroplatinic acid (ESI†). In a typical procedure, P3HT-NPs were prepared by condensation of P3HT-silane 3 with ammonium hydroxide solution in the presence of 20–40% tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) in a solvent mixture of anhydrous ethanol and THF (4:1). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 24 hours. The P3HT-NPs obtained in this fashion were collected by centrifugation followed by washing with ethanol, then repeatedly centrifuged and filtered (see ESI†). The reaction conditions and the effect of base concentration on the particle size distribution were evaluated (ESI, Table 1†). The particle size was controlled by the amount of base; and smaller size particles were resulted at higher NH4OH concentration. Scheme 1  Preparation of P3HT-SSQ nanoparticles by the direct hydrolysis and condensation method. FTIR spectroscopy of P3HT-NPs exhibits features in the range of 1082–1100 cm−1 confirming the formation of Si–O–Si bonds. The characteristic peak at 1377 cm−1 suggests the retention of Si–C bonds during the hydrolysis and condensation. The presence of alkyl chains –CH (2842–2912 cm−1), aromatic C–C (1449–1511 cm−1), and carbonyl (1624 cm−1) stretching vibrations further support the successful incorporation of P3HT into the siloxane network. According to TGA analysis, the %weight of the polymer fraction attached to the siloxane core is in the range of 55% to 70%. 29Si NMR spectroscopy could be used to quantitatively measure the degree of condensation in hydrolysis of organotrialkoxysilanes.9 The previous studies9 show that the degree of condensation in typical base-catalysed polysilsesquioxanes is in the range of 80–90%. However, we were unable to measure the degree of condensation in P3HT-NPs due to larger particle size which led to solubility issues due to nanoparticle aggregation while performing 29Si NMR using a highly concentrated sample.Through our modified Stöber method, we were able to introduce a higher load of ligand into the siloxane network over conventional methods such as ligand functionalization from surface modified silica and organically modified silica particles. Recently, Senkovskyy et al.6 used a surface initiated GRIM method to graft P3HT onto the surface of silica particles and the grafted polymer density was ∼11% to 13%, which is very low incorporation of P3HT. In addition to low grafting density, the formation of free polymer concentration is also high via the typical surface initiated GRIM method.6The size and the shape of these nanoparticles were visualized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and are shown in Fig. 1. TEM images demonstrate the successful preparation of these P3HT grafted nanoparticles, which are mostly spherical to globular in shape. Fig. 1  Transmission electron microscopy images of P3HT-SSQ NPs (sizes: left ∼55 nm and right 120 nm; scale bars −100 nm in both images). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysisTo gain insight into the molecular orientation and packing of P3HT polymer chains within the siloxane core structure, we performed XRD-analysis of the P3HT-NPs. As shown in Fig. 2, the XRD pattern shows two different phases of polymer chain packing with two sets of very narrow and broader peaks. The broader diffraction signals show multiple orders of (00l) peaks, where l = 1, 2, 3…. The first (100) and third (300) Bragg peaks were easily detected but the second Bragg peak (200) was not observed. However, the out-of-plane (010) reflection due to π–π interchain stacking (3.81 Å) is strong. The inter-chain distance d[100] of the P3HT packing within the siloxane network is 15.9 Å, which is lower than the typical P3HT interchain packing distance for a lamella packing pattern (d[100] = 16.6 Å) reported in the literature.10 However, such a decrease of d[100] was reported in the P3HT film from 16.6 Å to 15.5 Å.10,11 The reduced d-spacing of the first Bragg peak indicates that P3HT is better packed along the interchain direction in siloxane nanoparticles. From these results, we conclude that P3HT polymer chains are packed in a lamella-packing pattern with a π–π interchain stacking distance of 3.8 Å. Fig. 2  XRD pattern of P3HT-NPs. The narrow peaks of the XRD pattern show multiple orders of diffraction patterns with different out-of-plane (010) reflection due to π–π interchain stackings. The π–π stacking distance with (010) reflecting a d-spacing of 6.3 Å and (020) reflecting a d-spacing of 3.2 Å is in agreement with previously reported data for aligned P3HT microwire films.11 The second out-of-plane (010) and (020) reflections with a d-spacing of 4.4 Å for (010) and 2.8 Å for (020) indicate a much closer packing of the P3HT chains. Overall, the π–π interchain stacking distance in the nanoparticle decreases from 6.3 Å to 3.8 Å through three different out-of-plane reflections, indicating that the P3HT chains are better packed along the interchain direction in the siloxane network.Photophysical properties and photovoltaic performancePhotophysical propertiesUV-visible and photo-luminescence of P3HT-NPs and their blends with PCBM in chloroform solution are presented in Fig. 3 and S7.† The absorption spectra of P3HT-NPs in solution exhibit one broad absorption band with λmax at 445 nm, which agrees with the spectral pattern of their silane monomer. P3HT-NP/PCBM blends show both PCBM absorbance (λmax at 328 nm) and P3HT-NPs absorbance (λmax at 452 nm). The peak below 400 nm reflects the transition from the PCBM ground state to higher singlet states.12 The PL behaviour under the same conditions was investigated upon excitation at 457 nm. The PL emission of P3HT-NPs in solution exhibits an emission maximum at 580 nm with a shoulder peak around 630 nm. The emission intensity decreased in the 2:3 P3HT/PCBM blend compared to the 2:1 P3HT/PCBM blend. This indicated that there was a strong fluorescence quenching by PCBM. Fig. 3  UV-visible (left) and PL emission (right) spectra of P3HT nanoparticles (∼50 nm size) and two selected blends of P3HT-NP/PCBM in chloroform solution. Thin film fluorescence emission spectra of P3HT-NPs, PCBM, and five different blends of P3HT-NP/PCBM were obtained by photoexcitation using the 457 nm output from an Ar ion laser and detection using an EMCCD camera. Representative spectra are shown in Fig. 4. The blend compositions used were 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 75% (w/w) of PCBM prepared from a 10 fold diluted solution of 0.2 mg mL−1 P3HT-NP solution in chlorobenzene. The emission spectra of all five blends mimic the solution phase emission of the P3HT-NPs. The emission from PCBM was not strong enough to detect. However, the emission maxima of the blends red shifted with increase of PCBM concentration.

Photovoltaic performance of P3HT-NPsA significant dependence of photovoltaic performance (PV) on the polymer morphology, regioregularity and molecular weight of P3HT was previously reported. However, incorporating P3HT onto different types of nanoparticle surfaces and their performance for bulk heterojunction photovoltaics have not been studied except for a few reports published recently.6,7 Senkovskyy et al. introduced the surface initiated GRIM method to graft P3HT onto silica nanoparticle surfaces and studied the effect of nano-P3HT structures on PV performance.6In the present work, our goal is to determine whether there is any adverse effect on PV performance on inclusion of the siloxane network. Bulk heterojunction solar cells with the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active-layer/LiF/Al were fabricated13 and device parameters were evaluated. After optimization of the composition of the active layer blends, we were able to obtain devices with a Voc of 0.80 V, a Jsc of 10.44 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.30 ± 0.02 at room temperature (Fig. 5). This optimal device performance was obtained for the device made from a 1:1 mixture of P3HT-NPs and PCBM. These results demonstrate that the siloxane core structure at least does not affect the optoelectronic properties of P3HTs. However, more studies are necessary to comprehensively establish the influence of interaction between polymer chains and the siloxane network on the PV performance. Future studies will focus on further optimization of the particle size, shape, and morphology in order to enhance the PV performance.

In summary, we have described the synthesis, photophysical properties, and photovoltaic performance of electronically active siloxane nanoparticles prepared by base catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation. We were able to achieve the power conversion efficiency of 2.5% for the best optimized test device using these P3HT-siloxane nanoparticles.AcknowledgementsFinancial support from the Department of Chemistry and Office of Research at Western Kentucky University and from the National Science Foundation (CHE-0955550 and EPS-0903787) is acknowledged.
