    , Accepted 21st May 2022First published on 23rd May 2022AbstractNarrow bandgap (NBG) block copolymers are promising materials to realize single-material organic solar cells (SMOSCs) that combine high performance with minimized fabrication procedures. Quite recently, the exploitation of polymerized small molecule acceptors (PSMAs) capable of harvesting infrared photons, in conjunction with visible-light absorbing donor polymers, has been demonstrated as an effective route to design efficient NBG block copolymers. In this work, two NBG copolymers, namely PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ, were designed and synthesized. By precisely controlling the regiospecificity of the PSMA segment, regioregularity has been successfully achieved over the block copolymer backbone. There are evident differences between the properties of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ due to different regioselectivity within the polymer backbone. Specifically, PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ exhibits increased light absorbance, dominant electron transport properties, and a more ordered solid film structure. Moreover, the regioregular block polymer exhibits an increased short-circuit current density (Jsc) approaching 20 mA cm−2, resulting in an improved power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.51% in solar cells, which is among the highest reported for SMOSCs, indicating the important role of regioselectivity in determining block copolymer properties.
1. Introduction
π-Conjugated polymeric organic semiconductors are promising candidates for efficient solution-processed photovoltaics with flexibility, semi-transparency and low manufacturing cost.1–7 A typical polymer solar cell (PSC) normally utilizes a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) blend of a p-type conjugated polymer donor (D) and n-type conjugated molecule or polymer acceptor (A) as the light-harvesting layer.8–11 During the past five years, the development of narrow optical bandgap non-fullerene electron acceptors (NFAs) such as Y6 further extends the solar response spectrum of PSCs, and a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of above 18% has been widely demonstrated.12–15 However, the state-of-the-art polymer–polymer (all-polymer) solar cells still lag significantly behind NFA based PSCs, which is mainly attributed to the challenge in constructing efficient all-polymer systems. Due to the rise of NFAs, a polymerized small molecule acceptor was first reported in 2017,16 showing strong near-infrared absorption and improved compatibility with donor polymers, now boosting the PCE up to 16% for all-polymer devices.17 However, for both systems, the optimal D/A BHJ blend morphology is essential to achieve preferable contact and molecular orientation for better charge dissociation and transport. Besides, the research development of PSCs has now reached the stage where processing conditions, stability, and cost need to be further considered for large-scale commercialization.18
To overcome these limitations in BHJ systems, single-material organic solar cells (SMOSCs) have been proposed and investigated in the past decade.19–26 π-Conjugated polymeric organic semiconductors with greater synthetic flexibility allows for the synthesis of block conjugated polymers27–29 and organic-fullerene molecular dyads,24,30,31 which chemically connect the donor and acceptor segments in a single molecular system. Under the circumstances, SMOSCs can minimize procedures for preparing ready-to-coat organic conductive ink and photoactive layers. Besides, SMOSCs exhibit remarkably stable film morphology and has proven to be a viable alternative to BHJ systems.32 In the past few years, Li et al. reported a series of “double-cable” conjugated polymers consisting of linear donor–acceptor conjugated backbones and electron deficient naphthalene diimide (NDI) side-chains.25 Through precisely controlling the molecular structure, miscibility and morphology, a record PCE of over 8% was reported for the first time for SMOSCs. Concurrently, Choi et al. reported a highly crystalline D–A block copolymer PBDT2T-b-N2200 that exhibits a broad complementary absorption behavior and significantly improved morphology stability, showing the highest PCE of 6.43%.29 Along this line of consideration, quite recently, we and Min et al. reported the design strategy of narrow-bandgap materials for high-performance SMOSCs adopting fused-rings, core-based NFAs such as Y6 due to their advantages such as strong absorption in the NIR region, high electron mobility, and a suitable energy level.32–34 Narrow bandgap block polymers PBDB-T-b-PTY6 were designed and successfully synthesized with a strong absorbance of up to ∼900 nm and a record high PCE approaching 9%, pointing out the further direction of molecular design toward more efficient SMOSCs.
Narrow bandgap D–A block copolymers are promising materials to realize high-efficiency SMOSCs. Unfortunately, in comparison with “double-cable” polymers, the exact composition of these block copolymers from the one-pot synthesis method could not be analyzed.29 Additionally, the terminal group in the Y6 based NFA (brominated 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone) is often formed as a mixture of two isomers with similar polarity, which is very difficult to separate.16 This further creates the challenge of uncertain reaction sites during polymerization. Previous reports have demonstrated that the regularity of polymer backbones has an impact on the molecular packing, energy disorder and synthetic repeatability, as well as eventually the enhancement of device performance.35–37 Inspired by the design of regioregular polymerized small molecule acceptors, herein, we first performed regioselectivity optimization of block polymers for SMOSCs with higher efficiency. Specifically, we designed and synthesized a block copolymer PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ by polymerizing the regular polymer PTY6 on one side and the p-type donor polymer PBDB-T on the other side. The regioselectivity control endows PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ with extended absorption and ordered packing, leading to a higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) together with the best PCE of 10.51%, indicating the importance of structural regularity in the block copolymer for achieving efficient SMOSCs.
2. Experimental
2.1 The synthesis of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ
Under an inert atmosphere, M1 (36.75 mg, 4.06 mmol, 1 eq.), M2 (31.15 mg, 4.06 mmol, 1 eq.) and Pd(PPh3)4 (3.5 mg) were first dissolved in anhydrous toluene/DMF (2.5/0.25 mL) in a 50 mL reaction flask. The temperature was gradually increased to 110 °C while stirring the reaction mixture to prepare the PBDB-T polymers. After 1 hour, the mixed toluene/DMF solution (2/0.2 mL) of Y6-Br and Y6-Br-γ (80.19 mg, 4.06 mmol, 1 eq.) and 2,5-bis(trimethylstannyl)thiophene (16.64 mg, 4.06 mmol, 1 eq.) was injected into the reaction flask where PBDB-T was prepared. The reaction mixture was kept under stirring at 110 °C for 24 h. The resulting solution was cooled and precipitated in acetone (100 mL). The residual oligomers and catalyst were removed through Soxhlet extraction with acetone (12 h) and hexane (12 h), and the final block polymer product was extracted using chloroform. The chloroform fraction was then precipitated in acetone (100 mL), and the precipitated products were dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 12 h to obtain PBDB-T-b-PTY6 as a dark solid (102 mg, 81.6%) GPC: Mn = 24.5 kg mol−1; PDI = 2.78 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ as a dark solid (97 mg, 77.6%) GPC: Mn = 25.3 kg mol−1; PDI = 2.84.
2.2 Device fabrication and measurements
The structure of SMOSCs was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag. The block copolymers PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ were dissolved in chloroform and stirred for 4 h at 40 °C. First, PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrate at 4500 rpm for 40 s, and then the substrates were baked at 150 °C for 10 min under ambient conditions. Subsequently, PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ (12 mg mL−1) solutions with varying CN additives were deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS layer for 40 s at a spin rate of 2500 rpm. After thermal annealing at different temperatures for 10 min in a glove box, 8 nm PNDIT-F3N was spin-coated onto the active layer. Finally, Ag at a speed of 2 Å s−1 (120 nm) was thermally evaporated to accomplish the device fabrication. J–V characterization was performed by using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter under simulated AM 1.5G solar irradiation at 100 mW cm−2. The device area is 0.0725 cm2, and the solar cell devices were measured in the forward scan (−1.0 V → 1.0 V, step 0.0125 V, and scan rate: 0.1 V s−1) without an illumination mask in the glovebox.
3. Results and discussion
The chemical structures and synthetic routes of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ are shown in Fig. 1. Through Stille polycondensation,38 we prepared the target (D1–A1)–(D2–A2) type block polymers by synthesizing the donor polymer PBDB-T first and further adding functional NFA monomers Y6-Br capable of forming a PSMA fragment in the same reaction flask. As is reported, the monomer Y6-Br is normally a mixture of IC-Br-γ and IC-Br-δ,37,39 yielding the regiorandom block copolymer PBDB-T-b-PTY6. Here, we obtained high-purity Y6-Br-γ through vigorous recrystallization using a reported method,40 and the structure is also confirmed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Fig. S1†). Based on the defined structure of Y6-Br-γ, the one-pot Stille polymerization afforded the regioregular block copolymer PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ. Both block copolymers exhibit good solubility in commonly used solvents such as chloroform and chlorobenzene after 24 h polymerization. PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ were purified through standard Soxhlet extraction41 using acetone and hexane to remove the monomers, catalysts, and low molecular weight portion, and finally extracted with chloroform. 1H NMR was performed for the two block polymers (Fig. S2†). The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of the intermediate PBDB-T block and the final PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) is 15.0, 24.5, and 25.3 kg mol−1, with PDIs of 1.75, 2.78, and 2.84, respectively. According to the GPC results and a recent report, there are di-block and tri-block copolymers existing in the final product, and it is hard to separate the di-block and tri-block copolymers using purification technology. Moreover, the exact ratio of di-block and tri-block copolymers could not be analyzed, while the molar ratio of PBDB-T and PTY6/PTY6-γ could be estimated to be around 1/1 in such a block copolymer based on our previous characterization.32 Thermal stability of both block copolymers was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), with the results shown in Fig. S3.† The thermal decomposition temperature (Td) at 5% weight-loss of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ is 365 and 370 °C, respectively, suggesting slightly enhanced thermal stability, which may be attributed to more tight intermolecular interactions in PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ.

To clarify the correlation between the molecular structure and block copolymer properties, a series of characterization studies were performed for both polymers. Fig. 2(a) displays the images of their solutions and solid films. The UV-vis absorption spectra of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ were first recorded for both the solution and solid thin-film. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the dilute chloroform solution of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 shows absorption peaks centered at 500 nm, 610 nm, and 765 nm, while red-shifted peaks of 515 nm, 620 nm, and 772 nm are observed in the case of PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ, suggesting stronger intermolecular interactions of PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ in the solution state. For the solid thin-film, both block copolymers exhibit red-shifted absorption relative to their solutions, indicating improved molecular ordering from the solution to the solid film state. Moreover, a more obvious absorption peak in the region of 450–550 nm suggests a stronger dipole moment in PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ, which is an indication of better backbone conjugation and more efficient charge delocalization.42 Besides, the stronger conjugation between the Y6 end group and thiophene bridge in PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ would lead to enhanced intramolecular charge transfer and intermolecular interactions. As a result, the corresponding optical bandgap (Eg) is further decreased from 1.38 eV (PBDB-T-b-PTY6) to 1.35 eV (PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ), determined from their absorption onsets. These enhancements from precise control of configuration are beneficial for better light harvesting and achieving higher Jsc for photovoltaic applications. Meanwhile, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS, see Fig. S4†) was employed to determine the position of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) levels of both block copolymers, and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level values were further calculated according to their Eg. As illustrated in Fig. 2(c), the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ are determined to be −5.27 eV/−3.89 eV and −5.26 eV/−3.91 eV, respectively. The results suggest that such regioselectivity control over the block polymer has negligible impact on their relevant energy levels, which will not significantly affect the Voc result in SMOSCs.

To gain more insight into the change of intermolecular interactions and polymer solid state ordering, we performed Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements.43 Two-dimensional (2D) scattering patterns for two pristine block copolymer films are shown in Fig. 3(a), with the line-cut profiles of both in-plane and out-of-plane directions shown in Fig. 3(b). Both block copolymers exhibit a face-on orientation, with a distinct π-stacking diffraction peak (010) in the out-of-plane direction.44 The calculated distances for the “π–π stacking” are 3.86 Å for both PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ, shown in Table S1.† It is worth noting that regioregular block copolymers show almost the same packing distances, although they have different backbone connections, which indicates the similar backbone coplanarity. Meanwhile, the corresponding (100) diffraction peaks of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ are more isotropic in nature; the alkyl-stacking distance was calculated to be 22.28 and 20.60 Å, respectively. Moreover, crystal correlation lengths (CCLs) were calculated from Gaussian fitting of the alkyl- and π-stacking diffraction peaks (Table S1†). Specifically, we observe that from the (100) peak in the in-plane direction, PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ (34.184 Å) shows a larger CCL than PBDB-T-b-PTY6 (31.416 Å), while the CCLs from the (010) peak in the out-of-plane direction are almost the same. These analyses provide insight into the structure of polymer solid state films and reveal that regioselectivity control over the block copolymer backbone can promote intermolecular interactions and the packing order.

To confirm the GIWAXS results and further study the charge transport properties, organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) were fabricated using a top-gate bottom-contact (TGBC) structure.45Fig. 3(c) shows the electron/hole mobility obtained at different post thermal annealing temperatures in the range from 50 °C to 250 °C. At a temperature of 50 °C, PBDB-T-b-PTY6 shows ambipolar transport properties with more balanced electron and hole mobilities, while PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ presents dominant n-type transport (Fig. S5 and S6†). When further increasing the annealing temperature, the hole mobility of PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ gradually increases, which demonstrates improved intermolecular packing through thermal annealing. In addition, the PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ copolymer is able to retain relatively sufficient electron mobility after a high annealing temperature of 250 °C, indicating efficient electron transport channels benefiting from the ordered PTY6 phase. In contrast, the hole mobility of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 slightly decreases when increasing the annealing temperature, and the electron mobility is slightly lower relative to that of PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ. These results obtained from OFETs are consistent with GIWAXS measurements, indicating that the adoption of the defined Y6-Br-γ affords stronger intermolecular interactions of PTY6 segments.
The photovoltaic performance of SMOSCs was then evaluated by fabricating solar cells with a conventional structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/block copolymer/PNDIT-F3N/Ag (Fig. 4(a)). Both block copolymers were dissolved in chloroform, with a solvent additive of 1-chloronaphthalene (CN) according to our recently reported fabrication conditions.32Fig. 4(b) presents the optimized J–V characteristics under AM 1.5G simulated solar light at 100 mW cm−2, with the detailed device parameters shown in Table 1. The PBDB-T-b-PTY6 based SOOSCs show the highest PCE of 9.18% with a Jsc of 18.05 mA cm−2. In contrast, the PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ based device delivers a champion PCE of 10.51% with an enhanced Jsc of 19.67 mA cm−2 and a FF of 0.59 relative to those of the PBDB-T-b-PTY6 based one.

To understand the difference in photovoltaic properties and further investigate the charge transfer process of SMOSCs using different block copolymers, steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy was first performed for PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ thin films (100 nm) using an excitation at 450 nm (Fig. 4(c)). Both PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ films show distinct PL emission around 820 nm, which is due to PTY6 emission. It should be noted that the PL intensity is significantly quenched in the PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ film, indicating more efficient charge transfer relative to that of the PBDB-T-b-PTY6 film.46 Furthermore, the dependence of Voc and Jsc on the light intensity was measured to evaluate the carrier recombination of the block copolymer devices.47 In Voc-light intensity measurements, if the slope is greater than 1 kT/q (where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and q is the elementary charge), it indicates the interfacial trap-assisted Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination.48 As shown in Fig. 4(d), the values of the slope were calculated to be 1.58 kT/q and 1.43 kT/q in PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ based devices, respectively. The lower slope in PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ based device suggests a reduction in trap-assisted recombination.49 In addition, as shown in the Jsc-light intensity measurements (Fig. S7†), there is negligible difference in the α value, implying that biomolecular recombination does not restrict the device performance. The carrier recombination was confirmed by the dark current J–V curves of the optimized device (Fig. S8†). The PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ based device exhibits lower leakage current under reverse bias compared to the PBDB-T-b-PTY6 based device, indicating reduced recombination. Meanwhile, we also investigated the charge generation and extraction processes through the dependence of photocurrent density (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 (Fig. S9†).50 Under low effective voltage (Veff <0.5 V), the photocurrent of the PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ based device increases dramatically and reaches a maximum value, suggesting that the charge carriers are extracted efficiently. In contrast, the slower growth of photocurrent in the PBDB-T-b-PTY6 based device indicates less efficient carrier extraction.
The exciton dissociation and charge transport processes are strongly affected by the active layer morphology in SMOSCs.51 Finally, to get insight into the effect of molecular structure regioselectivity on morphology, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were performed. As shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b), we first performed AFM to evaluate the topographical features of the block copolymer films. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of PBDB-T-b-PTY6 and PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ films are 1.51 and 1.35 nm, respectively. It can be observed that the domain size of the PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ film is slightly smaller with smoother topography. The 3D views of the surface roughness provide a more vivid perspective to understand the topography of the films. TEM was also used to gain greater insight into the phase separation (Fig. 5(c) and (d)). For both traditional BHJ blend and block copolymer films, the well-developed D/A interpenetrating polymer network structure is essential for efficient carrier separation and transport processes.8 In contrast, the larger diameter and more ordered fibers in the PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ film are more beneficial for exciton separation and charge transport. Coupling the device characterization and morphological results, the desired film morphology in the PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ film may lead to the decreased recombination, increased carrier mobility, and an overall increase in photovoltaic performance.

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, we have demonstrated the synthesis and characterization of two narrow bandgap block copolymers with the same (D1–A1)–(D2–A2) backbone architecture. Fine regioselectivity control over the polymer backbone was achieved by incorporating the different building blocks Y6-Br and Y6-Br-γ. Compared to the control PBDB-T-b-PTY6, the regioregular block copolymer PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ exhibits a decreased bandgap and enhanced solid film ordering. The correlation between polymer structures and solid-state ordering was systematically discussed using GIWAXS. When used in thin-film OFET devices, PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ demonstrated dominated electron transport properties. In SCOSC application, the regioregular PBDB-T-b-PTY6-γ again showed enhanced Jsc and a champion PCE of 10.51%, which is among the highest reported for SMOSCs. The correlation between polymer structures and device performance was systematically investigated by device and morphological characterization. Overall, these results indicate the important role of regioselectivity in determining narrow bandgap block copolymer properties, and our systematical study may provide an effective approach to precisely control the polymer regioselectivity and improve the device performance of SMOSCs.
