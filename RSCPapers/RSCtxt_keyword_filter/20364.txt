    , Accepted 22nd June 2020First published on 23rd June 2020AbstractFormamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite has drawn scientific interest in the field of optoelectronic devices. However, the presence of highly toxic lead restricts its application. We approach this problem by studying the role of Sn substitution and Pb vacancy (Pb-□) in reducing the lead concentration and enhancing the stability and solar cell efficiency by forming a composite CH(NH2)2Pb1−x−ySnx□yBr3 (FAPb1−x−ySnx□yBr3) perovskite. Using the state-of-the-art hybrid density functional theory, we have discussed the important role of spin orbit coupling (SOC) and an electron's self-interaction error. The co-existence of Sn substitution and Pb-□ have been found to be thermodynamically stable using ab initio atomistic thermodynamics. However, Pb-□ introduces trap states deep inside the forbidden gap, which leads to electron–hole recombination centers to reduce the solar cell efficiency. Therefore, the stable configurations with only Sn substitution (FAPb1−xSnxBr3) are considered for further optical study. As compared to the pristine, the mixed perovskites FAPb1−xSnxBr3 with 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5 are inferred to be promising candidates for solar cell applications because of their better optical properties, higher absorption coefficient and larger spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) values.
1 Introduction
In recent years, various technologies have been developed to transform renewable solar energy into electricity.1–5 Photovoltaic devices such as solar cells based on crystalline silicon and CdTe have been used to harvest solar energy.6,7 However, this application gets constrained due to the high cost of solar cell production.8 Hence, to make full use of available solar energy, we must search for suitable materials. Hybrid inorganic organic perovskites (HIOPs) have been found to be a promising class of materials for photovoltaic and optoelectronic applications.2,9–12 In the present solar cell and photovoltaic community, these materials are considered to be the best as they have various optoelectronic properties like direct band gap, strong absorption of light, long carrier diffusion length, high stability and are cheap to manufacture.4,13,14 HIOPs are diverse due to the wide range of compositional substitutions available at A, B and X sites that leads to different physical and optical properties.15–18 The increase in power conversion efficiency from 3.8%14 to 25.2%19,20 in the case of HIOPs, has established the material as a promising alternative in photovoltaics.
Several studies have been done to understand the properties of HIOPs as well as their performance in optoelectronic devices. Methylammonium (MA) based perovskites are widely studied hybrid perovskites in this field.21–25 Even though they have potential for a broad range of optoelectronic applications, the formamidinium (FA) based perovskites have better thermal stability than MA based perovskites.26 However, the optoelectronic properties of FA based perovskites have not been significantly studied. Recently, Long et al. have shown that the FAPbBr3 displays a longer carrier diffusion length than MAPbBr3 and CsPbBr3 perovskites.27 This factor of carrier diffusion length is of immense importance in the field of photovoltaics.
FAPbBr3 has attracted significant interest for the realization of perovskite solar cells.28 The presence of the larger FA cation provides several impressive properties like shifting of absorption edge in the near-infrared region, enhancement of the radiative carrier lifetime and stabilization of the cubic perovskite at room temperature.29–32 However, due to the presence of environmentally unfriendly Pb, its application in real life is hindered. Note that, the complete removal of Pb from the perovskite cage hugely hampers the solar cell performance and stability.33–37 It is, therefore, of profound interest to introduce a suitable dopant that will replace the hazardous Pb. The best alternatives are Sn and Ge because Pb, Sn and Ge all belong to the same group and have a similar ionic radius. Moreover, researchers have found that Sn based perovskites have an advantage over Ge based perovskites in terms of structural stability.38 Also, the existing literature reveals that Sn based perovksites show better absorption ability and efficiency over pure Pb based perovskites.39–44 Although several researchers have understood the physics with different Sn concentrations in perovskites, the possibility of Pb vacancy (Pb-□) formation along with the substitution of Sn-atoms has not been discussed, to the best of our knowledge.
This motivates us to understand the defect physics, i.e. Sn substitution and Pb-□, in regulating the stability of FAPb1−x−ySnx□yBr3. We have used state-of-the-art first-principles based methodology under the framework of density functional theory with hybrid functional. In this article, we provide an exhaustive study on the relative stability of different configurations. Initially, we have understood the stability by accurate estimation of the formation energy. Further, the quantitative analysis for the stability of different defect configurations with different numbers of Pb-□ and Sn substitutions has been done by comparing the contribution of bond making/breaking and charge carrier trapping energies. In addition, we have thoroughly studied the electronic density of states of different defect configurations. The optical absorption and spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) of the most stable configurations have also been explored.
2 Methodology
We have performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations45,46 with projector augmented wave (PAW)47 psuedopotential method using Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP).48 The optimized lattice constant of FAPbBr3 (viz. 6.01 Å with space group Pmm (no. 221)) agrees well with the experimental X-ray diffraction data.49,50 Generalized gradient approximation (PBE51 functional) has been employed for relaxing the structure using conjugate gradient minimization52,53 with 2 × 2 × 2 k-mesh. An energy tolerance of 0.01 meV, force tolerance of 0.0001 eV Å−1 and the cutoff energy of 600 eV have been used in the calculations. The 2 × 2 × 2 supercell of FAPbBr3, consisting of 96 atoms, is considered for the defect study. The formation energy of the defected system was calculated using hybrid exchange correlation (εxc) functional (HSE06)54,55 with a converged K-mesh (viz. 4 × 4 × 4 as per Monkhorst–Pack scheme). In the HSE06 functional the exchange potential is divided into short range and long range part. A fraction of non-local Hartree–Fock exchange potential mixed with the GGA exchange potential of PBE is described as the short range part [SR]. The long range part [LR] and the correlation potential are described by the PBE (DFT) functional: EHSE06xc = αEHF,SRx(ω) + (1 − α)EPBE,SRx(ω) + EPBE,LRx(ω) + EPBEx(1)where α is the mixing coefficient and ω is the screening length. In our case, α is varied from 0.25 to 0.50 and ω is 0.2 Å−1. The optical properties are calculated using HSE06 εxc functional, where the number of unoccupied bands (NBANDS) is set to 520. This number is typically three times the number of occupied orbitals in the system. Note that, due to the presence of heavy atoms, spin orbit coupling (SOC) is included, while performing the energy calculations with various εxc functionals.
3 Results
3.1 Functional validation
We have calculated the bandgap of FAPbBr3 with different εxc functionals to explore the dependence of the electronic properties on the chosen εxc functional. It is well-known that the PBE functional generally underestimates the bandgap. As our system includes Pb, which is a heavy element, the effect of SOC is incorporated. Inclusion of SOC results in splitting of the conduction band minimum (CBm) and a shift to a lower value. In Fig. 1(a) we have shown the position of the CBm and valence band maximum (VBM) of cubic FAPbBr3, estimated with different εxc functionals viz. PBE, PBE + SOC, HSE06 and HSE06 + SOC. We find that the bandgap of FAPbBr3 with PBE is 1.72 eV, whereas the experimental bandgap is 2.23 eV.56 The bandgap with PBE + SOC comes out to be 0.64 eV. On inclusion of an electron's self-interaction error, using the HSE06 functional (without SOC) the bandgap is overestimated to 2.50 eV, whereas upon consideration of the SOC effect, this turns out to be 1.40 eV. We see that the HSE06 with 50% of Hartree–Fock (HF) exact exchange plus SOC reproduces the bandgap very close to the experimental value of 2.20 eV.
 Fig. 1  (a) Band edge alignment using PBE, PBE + SOC, HSE06 and HSE06 + SOC, (b) calculated absorption spectra using HSE06 + SOC functional with different Hartree–Fock exact exchange (α = 0.25, 0.43 and 0.50). 
It should be noted here that SOC and an electron's self-interaction contributions counter each other25 but by unequal amounts. As a matter of fact, HSE06 + SOC (with default 25% HF exact exchange) is unable to reproduce the correct bandgap. We find that for a similar system viz. CH3NH3PbI3 the correct band gap for the tetragonal phase is reproduced with α = 0.43.57,58 This is why we checked if a similar extent of HF exact exchange works for FAPbBr3 to reproduce the bandgap. But this yields a bandgap of 1.93 eV corresponding to α = 0.43. Therefore, the amount of HF exact exchange needs to be increased up to 50% to correctly reproduce the experimental bandgap using HSE06 + SOC. In order to validate this, we have calculated the imaginary part of the dielectric function for three different values of α (α = 0.25, 0.43 and 0.50) (see Fig. 1(b)). The respective optical peaks are 1.40 eV, 1.93 eV and 2.20 eV. The optical peak of 2.20 eV that corresponds to the α = 0.50 is well in agreement with the experiment (2.23 eV).
Note that, the main aim of this study is the reduction of Pb concentration in FAPbBr3 by Sn substitution and Pb vacancies (Pb-□). The extent of Sn substitution and Pb-□ will affect the role of SOC in the composite system FAPb1−x−ySnx□yBr3, as it is solely a function of the amount of Pb in it. Thus, despite 50% of HF exact exchange giving the correct position of the VBM and CBm in the case of pristine FAPbBr3, it is not necessarily the case with mixed perovskites (FAPb1−x−ySnx□yBr3). Hence, we have used the default α = 0.25 for the formation energy calculations. For sure in the total energy expression, this may lead to some unprecedented error in the energetics due to over/underestimation of the combined effect of SOC and the electron's self-interaction error. However, to estimate formation energies of different conformers with and without defects, we take the difference of the total energies. Thus, the error due to over/underestimation of SOC and the self-interaction error, is assumed to be eliminated. Therefore, the rest of the calculations of the composite system are carried out with 25% of HF exact exchange of HSE06 + SOC.
3.2 Defect stability
We have compared the thermodynamic stability of the pristine FAPbBr3 and mixed perovskites, FAPb1−x−ySnx□yBr3, by calculating the respective formation energies. The precursors considered for the calculation of formation energy of the mixed perovskites FAPb1−x−ySnx□yBr3, are PbBr2, FABr, SnBr2 and Br2. The associated expression is: Ef(x,y) = E(FA8Pb8−x−ySnx□yBr24) − 8E(FABr) − xE(SnBr2) − (8 − x − y)E(PbBr2) − yE(Br2)(2)where x and y represent the number of Sn substitutions and Pb-□ in the 2 × 2 × 2 (96 atom) supercell of FAPbBr3 (FA8Pb8Br24). The coefficient of each term on the right hand side is chosen so that they stoichiometrically balance the number of constituent atoms in FA8Pb8−x−ySnx□yBr24.
In Fig. 2(a and b), we show the optimized crystal structure of pristine FAPbBr3 and defected FAPbBr3 (Sn substitutions and Pb-□). Also, in Fig. 2(c and d) we have plotted the formation energy [Ef(x,y)] as a function of x (0 ≤ x ≤ 4) and y (0 ≤ y ≤ 4). Note that a dark blue color represents higher stability as shown by the color bars adjacent to the plot. The defects are created using an iterative strategy.59 Initially, we identified the most stable vacancy (or substitution) site on the basis of energetics, in the pristine. Then, we have found the next most stable vacancy (or substitution) site by scanning all the other remaining 7 Pb sites. Further, to increase the number of defects in the pristine, we have repeated the process systematically. Note that, we have shown the thermodynamic stability for PBE and HSE06 + SOC in Fig. 2(c and d), respectively. We have found that the pristine system prefers no Pb-□ when there is no Sn substitution. As the number of Sn substitutions increases with 0 Pb-□, it gradually makes the system energetically stable. We observe, that the introduction of Sn favours single Pb-□. However, for x = 3 and 4, the system prefers 4 Pb-□. As per the plot, we note, FA8Sn4□4Br24, FA8Pb1Sn4□3Br24, FA8Pb1Sn3□4Br24, FA8Pb3Sn2□3Br24 and FA8Pb2Sn3□3Br24 are the most stable conformers among all the defect configurations. Although from the stability plot, it has been observed that the stability trend is almost the same for both PBE and HSE06 + SOC, the results of HSE06 + SOC are more reliable as it correctly determines the position of the defect levels. The thermodynamically stable phases as obtained from the HSE06 functional are also given in the ESI† (see Fig. S1) as a reference data set to understand the explicit role of SOC. Further, we have calculated the tolerance factor (t) and octahedral factor (μ) to investigate the structures of pristine and mixed conformers thoroughly. The concept of tolerance factor was first introduced by Goldschmidt. The tolerance factor (t) indicates the stability of the perovskite structure and is given by:60 (3)The octahedral factor (μ), introduced by Li et al. in 2008, defines the stability of BX6 octahedra and it is given by:61 (4)where rA, rB, and rx are the effective ionic radii of A and B cations, and X anion, respectively. It is suggested that for stable cubic perovskites, the range for the tolerance factor and octahedral factor should be 0.813 < t < 1.107 and 0.377 < μ < 0.895, respectively.62,63 The ionic radius of FA+, Pb2+, Br− and Sn2+ are 2.53 Å, 1.19 Å, 1.96 Å and 1.15 Å, respectively.15 The tolerance factor t and octahedral factor μ for all the thermodynamically stable conformers are given in the ESI† (Table S1). We have found that, in the mixed perovskites FA8Pb8−x−ySnx□yBr24, if the number of Pb-□ is >1, it has a tolerance factor greater than 1.107. Hence, these conformers do not possess structural stability. However, these perovskites hold octahedral stability (see Fig. S2 in the ESI†). Hence, we have provided an inset of the thermodynamic stability plot for only 0 and 1 Pb-□ with Sn substitution (0 ≤ x ≤ 4) using PBE and HSE06 + SOC (Fig. 2(c′ and d′)). We have found that Pb-□ with no Sn substitution is not stable at all. Sn substitution along with Pb-□ is the thermodynamically most stable configuration.

(c and d) Represent the formation energy [Ef(x,y)] of different FA8Pb8−x−ySnx□yBr24 configurations as a function of Sn substitution and Pb-□, using PBE and HSE06 + SOC, respectively. The red dashed box region is shown as the inset (c′) and (d′). Ef(x,y) scale is presented by the color-bar in eV. 
In order to better understand the co-existence of Pb-□ and Sn substitution we have critically analyzed the enhanced stability by decomposing the overall defect formation energy into two parts: (i) bond making/breaking energy (Δε), and (ii) charge carrier trapping energy (Δζ).64,65 The combined effect of these two energies will corroborate which one of the configurations is most stable.
The VBM of the pristine FA8Pb8Br24 is taken as a reference for calculating the charge carrier trapping energy. The charge carrier trapping energy i.e. Δζ is given by (see Fig. 3): Δζ = VBM(pristine) − VBM(defect)(5)
 Fig. 3  Band edge positions for different defect configurations of FAPbBr3viz. pristine, single Sn substitution, single Pb-□, and co-existing Pb-□ and Sn substitution. 
From Table 1, comparing the values of Δε and Δζ we see the sum of Δζ and Δε results in a more negative value for FA8Pb6Sn1□1Br24 as compared to a single Pb-□ or single Sn substitution. This further concludes that Pb-□ alone is not a favourable defect. However, single Sn substitution is favoured alongside the simultaneous co-existence of Pb-□ and Sn substitution. Note that the structural stability of different stable defect configurations are also checked at higher temperature using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD). We, henceforth, obtained the radial distribution function g(r) at T = 0 K and T = 300 K by an 8 ps long MD simulation run with NVT ensemble (Nose–Hoover thermostat). We observe that, the nature of the radial distribution function remains the same at room temperature for the nearest neighbours (see Fig. S3 in the ESI†). Therefore, we validate that the structure will remain stable at an operational temperature of 300 K.

3.3 Electronic properties
We have plotted the density of states (DOS) to better understand the role of Pb-□ and Sn substitution in enhancing the optoelectronic properties of FAPbBr3. We find that Pb-□ introduces trap states deep inside the forbidden gap (see Fig. S4 in ESI†). Thus, despite the configurations having Sn substitution along with Pb-□ being stable, trap states are formed that act as recombination centres. This results in degradation of the optoelectronic performance. Moreover, these defect configurations give an indirect bandgap. Hence, all these stable configurations with one Pb-□ are not suitable for photovoltaics. In view of this, in the following sections, only FA8Pb8−xSnxBr24 conformers (i.e. without any Pb-□) are taken for further optical studies.
HIOPs are found to be promising candidates for perovskite solar cells because of their high efficiency and high absorption. In order to understand the underlying reason for these properties, we have plotted the partial density of states (PDOS) for FA8Pb8−xSnxBr24 (see Fig. 4). The results show that, as the Sn concentration increases, the upper valence bands (VBs) are shifted away from the Fermi-level, whereas the VBM remains same. On the other hand, with an increase in Sn concentration, the CBm shifts toward the Fermi-level as shown in Fig. 4(a). The results from PDOS show that the VBM is primarily contributed by Br 4p orbitals with a small contribution from Pb 6s orbitals, whereas the CBm is mainly composed of unoccupied Pb 6p orbitals (Fig. 4(b–d)). Hence, there is strong s–p and p–p coupling, which reduces the bandgap. In fact the strong absorption in this class of materials is due to these direct p–p and s–p electronic transitions. Note that since Sn has the same electronic structure as that of Pb, they show a similar contribution in the DOS plot. Thus, in the case of Sn substitution in FAPbBr3, this inherent absorption property is expected to prevail.

3.4 Optical properties
A detailed study of the optical properties like dielectric function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient is indispensable in predicting the suitability of a particular material in optoelectronic applications. The linear optical properties are defined by the frequency dependent complex dielectric function, ε(ω) = Re(ε) + Im(ε), where Im(ε) is the imaginary part of the dielectric function that is obtained by calculating the interband matrix elements of the momentum operators and Re(ε) is the real part of the dielectric function as calculated by applying the Kramers–Kronig relation.66 Any optical properties like refractive index (η), extinction coefficient (κ) and absorption coefficient (α) can be evaluated using the Re(ε) and Im(ε) part of the dielectric function using the following formulae: (6) (7) (8)The dielectric function gives the response of materials to incident electromagnetic radiation and therefore, it is important to study this property for the optoelectronic device applications. Hence, the real and imaginary part of the dielectric function of the stable conformers have been studied. Note that for pristine FAPbBr3, HSE06 + SOC (with default α = 0.25) hugely underestimates the bandgap (the peak at 1.40 eV as in Fig. 1(b)). This is mainly because the conduction band is degenerate, which gets split upon inclusion of SOC, and the CBm gets shifted downward to underestimate the bandgap (see Fig. 1(a)). Now the entire optical analysis is very much dependent on the bandgap. Thus, if we include SOC, everything gets underestimated. To avoid this, we have computed it with HSE06 without SOC. We have checked by computing a few cases that on inclusion of SOC the trend remains the same.
The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a red-shift towards the infrared region as the Sn concentration increases from x = 0 to x = 4 in FA8Pb8−xSnxBr24 (see Fig. 5(a)). This happens due to gradual reduction in the bandgap with increasing Sn concentration (see ESI† in Table S2). Similarly, the real part of the dielectric function (dielectric constant) increases with an increase in Sn concentration. The high value of the dielectric constant is very important for the materials to be used in solar cells because the high dielectric constant reduces the amount of radiative recombination, which consequently enhances the entire device performance. From Fig. 5(b), it is clearly visible that the peaks shift towards the high dielectric constant value at ω = 0 with an increase in Sn substitution (x = 0–4). However, the fully substituted Sn in the system, is an exception to the above observed trend. In this case, the Im(ε) shows a blue shift and the Re(ε) shows a lowering in the dielectric function value which in turn degrades the device performance as shown in Fig. 5(a) and (b). The imaginary and real part of the dielectric function corresponding to the PBE functional is also provided in the ESI† (Fig. S6(a) and (b)) for reference purposes.

Further, using eqn (7) and (8), we have calculated the absorption coefficient for FA8Pb8−xSnxBr24 (x = 0–4). The optical absorption or absorption coefficient, is one of the most essential properties of a material in terms of its photovoltaic application. This is because the absorption coefficient depicts key information regarding the optimal solar energy conversion efficiency. We observe a red shift in the optical absorption, and the intensity of peaks is higher than that of undoped FAPbBr3 within the visible light region (see Fig. S5 in ESI†). However, the complete Sn substitution in FAPbBr3 shows a blue shift in the absorption spectrum. The absorption coefficient calculated using the PBE functional is provided in the ESI† (see Fig. S7(a)). Note that, these properties alone are not sufficient to understand the highest power conversion efficiency. Hence, we have calculated the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) for FA8Pb8−xSnxBr24 (x = 0–4).
The Shockley–Queisser (SQ) limit67 which is one of the selection methods used to identify solar cell materials on the basis of its bandgap (direct or indirect), does not consider material dependent properties like the absorption coefficient and thickness of the absorber material. Yu and Zunger68 introduced the SLME approach to overcome the shortcomings of the SQ limit, which incorporates the absorptivity and thickness of the system. The SLME depends on the material property-related inputs like the nature of the bandgap, the absorption coefficient, thickness of the absorber material and temperature.68,69 Using this approach, we have calculated the maximum efficiencies of FA8Pb8−xSnxBr24 (x = 0–4) as a function of thickness of the absorber layers with HSE06 as shown in Fig. 6. The efficiency plot and SLME corresponding to the PBE functional is provided in the ESI† (Fig. S7(b) and Table S3) for reference purposes. Here we assume the material thickness to be 500 nm and the temperature is set at 300 K. The curve shows that FA8Pb4Sn4Br24 has the maximum power conversion efficiency of 26.74% which is quite large in comparison to the pristine. The SLME values of different conformers FA8Pb8−xSnxBr24 (x = 0–4) are given below in Table 2.

Note that the efficiency is reasonably good in comparison to the pristine, as Sn concentration increases up to 50%. However, the efficiency degrades beyond 50% Sn concentration. Moreover, in the case of complete substitution of the Sn atom i.e., FASnBr3, the bandgap increases abruptly due to complete deformation of its structure,70 hence, reducing its efficiency to 6.21%. Therefore, it is recommended to dope up to 50% of the Sn atom, to enhance the efficiency of a solar cell.
4 Conclusions
We have systematically analyzed the structural, electronic and optical properties of FAPb1−x−ySnx□yBr3 perovskites using first-principles calculations. We have discussed the role of εxc and SOC in predicting the thermodynamic stability of FAPbBr3. The configurations with Sn substitution have shown more stability than that with the Pb-□. However, the Pb-□ co-exists with Sn substitution to have a favourable formation energy. The electronic structure reveals that Sn substitution with Pb-□ leads to the formation of trap states, which causes recombination and hence, the performance degrades. For FAPb1−xSnxBr3 configurations, the reason for strong absorption is that the direct p–p and s–p transition from the valence band is predominantly contributed to by Br 4p and Pb/Sn 6s orbitals to the conduction band of the Pb/Sn 6p orbital. The highest power conversion efficiency is achieved for 50% Sn substitution. Hence, favourable formation energy, direct bandgap, suitable optical absorption coefficient and maximum solar cell efficiency of the FAPb1−xSnxBr3 (0 ≤ x ≤ 0.5) makes it a promising HIOP candidate for solar cell applications.
