Here, we demonstrate the screening effect of polarization states on charge redistribution related to the photovoltaic performance of ferroelectric CH3NH3PbI3 thin films using atomic force microscopy. We show the interplay between polarization and injected charges to have significant effects on charge transfer which potentially influences photovoltaic performance. The obtained results reveal that the direction and the amount of charge transfer can be influenced by the screening of polarization states at the interface. These results could deliver fundamental information regarding the influence of ferroelectricity on CH3NH3PbX3 solar cells.
1. Introduction
Hybrid organometal halide materials, e.g. methyl ammonium lead halides, (CH3NH3PbX3, where X = Cl, Br or I) with a perovskite crystal structure have been a subject of special interest for next generation photovoltaic materials due to their high light absorption coefficient, long absorption wavelength, and excellent electron/hole diffusion length.1–7 Moreover, the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) from these materials has recently achieved 20.2%.8
The representative CH3NH3PbI3 (methyl ammonium lead iodide; MALI), among the organometal halide perovskite materials, possesses a tetragonal crystal structure (I4/mcm space group) with the polarizable organic cation CH3NH3+ in a 12-fold cuboctahedral coordination at room temperature.9,10 Intriguingly, a couple of recent studies reported that these lattice and organic molecular shapes can be formed as ferroelectric domains and reversible switching by application of the poling voltage can be observed through piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM).9,11–13 Some other recent reports further demonstrated that switching can occur within a short time because of the short retention time of CH3NH3PbI3.14 Thus, various studies have been performed to investigate its ferroelectricity.
It was reported that ferroelectric polarization can significantly affect the photovoltaic performance of oxide ferroelectric systems.15,16 In addition, ferroelectric polarization states can even affect the typical voltage–current behavior.17 In fact, a couple of recent reports show the influence of ferroelectricity on the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells.18,19 All these effects in ferroelectric materials can be strongly correlated with charge distribution at the interface or surface of the ferroelectric layer, i.e. screening at the interface or surface of the surface. In general, the term ‘screening’ in ferroelectric materials describes a phenomenon that polarization charges are compensated by intrinsic and/or extrinsic charges.20 In this context, the screening can be potentially used for modulating the efficient charge collection at the perovskite/metal interface.21 Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report on the fundamental study of screening phenomena in CH3NH3PbI3 thin films.
Herein, we explore the screening effect of polarization states on the photovoltaic performance of ferroelectric MALI perovskite thin films (PTFs) using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Fundamental physical information, such as ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties, was obtained by PFM measurements. On the basis of the fundamental physical information, the interplay between polarization and injected charges is demonstrated. Furthermore, the screening effect on the photovoltaic performance is explored by a combination of PFM and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM).
2. Experimental
Fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 thin films
A TiO2 compact layer (50 nm) was deposited by spin coating a titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution (in 1-butanol, 0.15 M) on a fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate, and then dried at 120 °C for 10 min. A 0.3 M diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) solution was then coated at 3000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The substrate was annealed at 500 °C for 15 min. After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were treated with an aqueous TiCl4 solution (0.05 M) for 30 min at 70 °C. The substrate was rinsed in deionized water several times, dried by nitrogen blowing and annealed at 500 °C for 15 min.
The CH3NH3PbI3 PTF layer (approximately 150–200 nm thick) was deposited by the sequential deposition of PbI2 and methylammonium iodide (MAI, CH3NH3I). MAI was synthesized according to a reported procedure.1 The prepared TiO2 compact layer/FTO substrate was first coated with a PbI2 solution (1.0 M, in N,N-dimethylformamide), and then annealed at 70 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the sample was dipped in MAI solution in 2-propanol (10 mg ml−1) for 90 s, rinsed with 2-propanol, and annealed at 70 °C for 30 min.
AFM measurements
AFM measurements, including PFM and KPFM, were performed using a commercial AFM (NX-10, Park Systems) with a platinum coated conductive probe (Multi75E-G, BudgetSensors). To acquire the PFM phase and amplitude images, a commercial lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research Systems) was equipped to the AFM. An ac modulation voltage of 1.5 Vrms at 17 kHz was applied to the conductive probe, which acts as a top electrode, and the bottom electrode, i.e. FTO, was grounded. For the determination of the piezoelectric coefficient (d33), the ac bias was gradually increased with a maximum of 2 Vrms at 17 kHz, which caused periodic expansion and contraction of the surface, and the response was measured using the lock-in amplifier. For the piezoresponse hysteresis loop measurements, a function generator (PXIe-1062Q, National Instruments) controlled by using LabVIEW/MATLAB software was additionally equipped to the AFM for generating band excitation (BE).22 The hysteresis loops were acquired for a range of −7 to 7 Vdc and the BE waveform of ∼290–390 kHz and 2 Vpp. To acquire surface potential images using KPFM measurements, an ac modulation voltage of 2.0 Vrms at 17 kHz and dc feedback bias were applied to the conductive probe. All AFM images were obtained at 256 × 256 pixels.
To illuminate red light, a commercial red LED with 650 nm wavelength was used and light was illuminated to the MALI PTF side, i.e. the top side of the sample. In this work, the power of red light was about 1.22 mW (distance: 1.5 cm, angle: 45°) which was measured by a commercial power meter (1918-C, Newport). The power of light as a function of distance and angle is presented in Fig. S2.†
3. Results and discussion
The screening can be understood when there is sufficient information on the material properties, such as the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. However, very limited information on these material properties is available. Hence, prior to examination of the screening in MALI PTFs, the fundamental ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the MALI PTFs were firstly explored. We note that conductivity of the prepared sample was sufficiently low, indicating that there is no potential issue related to conductivity for the AFM measurements (see Fig. S3†). A topography image of the MALI PTFs is shown in Fig. 1a. It shows large and dense grains (∼400 nm) which are comparable with the thickness of films. The PFM phase and amplitude images, which were simultaneously acquired for the same region shown in Fig. 1a, are presented in Fig. 1b and c. They were found to be slightly dependent on the topographic features. The grain boundary showed a slightly lower amplitude, as shown in Fig. 1b. The histogram of phase contrast in Fig. 1d shows a well-aligned phase response at around 90°. If there is no distinct polarization, the phase response is somewhat uniformly distributed over all the phase values. However, the histogram presented in Fig. 1d indicates that MALI PTFs have well-aligned polarization states along the vertical direction.

(e) Average amplitude of piezoresponse in MALI PTFs as a function of the magnitude of Vac, averaged over 25 measurements. The solid line was fitted by the least square method. All images (a–c) were obtained for the same area. Scale bar is 600 nm. 
The piezoelectric coefficient of the MALI PTFs was also investigated by measuring the amplitude of the piezoresponse as a function of the magnitude of Vac. The slope of the graph, i.e. linear coefficient, was interpreted as the piezoelectric coefficient.23 Since it displayed a linear relationship, this indicates the ample evidence for the existence of piezoelectricity in the MALI PTFs. The average value of the piezoelectric coefficient was calculated to be −5.67 pm V−1 (the negative sign is discussed in Fig. 2). The obtained absolute value is similar to that reported in work published by Mariona et al., where they reported that the piezoelectric coefficient of MALI PTFs is 6 pm V−1 at room temperature.14

The circles in (a) represent the vertical directions of polarization. (b and d) Corresponding histograms of phase contrast in red and blue areas. The poling bias was applied during the scanning of the surface with a scan speed of 0.5 Hz. Scale bar is 2 μm. 
In order to examine the switchability of the MALI PTFs, the films were poled by negative and positive voltages, as box patterns. In the case of Fig. 2a, the outer box (red dotted area) over an area of 5 × 5 μm2 was first poled by an application of −7 Vdc, then the inner box (blue dotted area) over an area of 3 × 3 μm2 was poled by an application of 7 Vdc. The PFM measurements were then performed over an area of 10 × 10 μm2. In the case of Fig. 2c, the signs of the voltage applied were opposite to those applied to the sample in Fig. 2a. The as-grown domains show preferentially bright contrast, i.e. imprint behavior, which may originate from the built-in electric field related to the interfacial states between the MALI PTFs and TiO2 layer.24,25 The influence of the built-in field at the interface on the domains is well known in the ferroelectric materials including organic ferroelectrics.26 Because of this, the switching of the polarization by an application of a positive voltage does not achieve complete switching over the scanned area, as can be seen in the blue area in Fig. 2a. Since the imprint of polarization can be modulated by interface control in conventional oxide ferroelectrics, it is expected that the imprint of the MALI PTFs also can be controlled by a similar factor.24 Although the PFM phase images showed partial switching behavior, the results obtained clearly showed reversible polarization switching, indicating the presence of ferroelectric polarization. We note that poled states were retained for above 1 h (see Fig. S4†) and the surface can frequently be deformed under voltages higher than 7 V because of the organic nature of the MALI PTFs (not shown here). Thus, it is difficult to observe fully switched states over the entire scanned area.
Interestingly, the contrast in the PFM phase images was observed to be reversed compared to conventional inorganic ferroelectrics such as Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) under the same sign of applied voltage (see Fig. S5†). This opposite contrast was also reported for organic ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) thin films of which the piezoelectric coefficient was negative.26,27 In other words, the directions of surface expansion and contraction are opposite to the PZT thin films for which the piezoelectric coefficient is positive. Thus, it can be concluded that the piezoelectric coefficient of MALI PTFs has a negative sign, similar to other organic ferroelectric materials. On the basis of our observations, the bright (dark) contrast domains were assigned as upward (downward) polarizations. Therefore, even though the linear slope in the plotted graph has a positive value, like other organic ferroelectrics represented by P(VDF-TrFE),26,28 the sign of its piezoelectric coefficient can be determined as negative.
In order to further explore the reversible polarization switching, the piezoresponse hysteresis loops were measured, as shown in Fig. 3. The representative amplitude and phase spectra in Fig. 3a show an apparent switching behavior. Since the amplitude and phase represent the magnitude and direction of the piezoresponse, respectively, ferroelectric switching is clearly visible as straight vertical lines where the amplitude is periodically varied and the phase changes by 180°.29 As shown in Fig. 3b, the clear butterfly shape of the amplitude loop and switching of the phase demonstrate the existence of switchable ferroelectric polarizations in the MALI PTFs. The piezoresponse hysteresis loop in Fig. 3c was acquired by multiplying the amplitude and phase loops in Fig. 3b, and showed clear loop opening. The positive and negative coercive voltages (fields) in the hysteresis loop were about 3 (200 kV cm−1) and −1 V (65 kV cm−1), respectively. This indicates asymmetric switching with imprints. The positive shift of the coercive voltage means that the polarization was readily switched in the upward direction. In other words, the upward polarizations were more preferred and stable. These results are consistent with the above PFM results in Fig. 2. Interestingly, the coercive field was much smaller than that of P(VDF-TrFE) thin films, for which the coercive field is about 1 MV cm−1.30 Though the MALI PTFs have already been used for solar cell applications, this indicates that they may have potential application in other areas as well, such as flexible devices in which the P(VDF-TrFE) has commonly been used.

Average (b) amplitude and phase loops, and (c) the corresponding piezoresponse (PR) hysteresis loop. These values were obtained from the average value of 100 measurements. 
Finally, to explore charge separation in the MALI PTFs, KPFM was employed, as it can be used for imaging the surface potential induced by charge dynamics.31,32Fig. 4 shows the surface potential before/after illumination of the MALI PTFs with red light, in which the left-hand and right-hand dotted areas were poled by applying the voltages of 7 Vdc and −7 Vdc, respectively. The as-grown surface in Fig. 4a showed the positive surface potential of approximately 380–410 mV. After applications of the positive and negative biases to the left-hand and right-hand dotted areas, respectively, a slight change in the surface potential was observed as shown in Fig. 4b due to polarization switching and injected charges.33 The surface potential of the positively poled area was increased as 400–420 mV, whereas that of negatively poled area showed a slightly decreased value. To have a further understanding of the effect of ferroelectric polarization on the photovoltaic performance, the surface potential was measured in the same region under illumination with red light (Fig. 4c). Surprisingly, under illumination with a red light, the surface potential of the as-grown MALI PTFs dramatically decreased as 280–300 mV because of generated charges. In the positively poled area, the excess positive charges were readily compensated by the electrons generated on the MALI PTF surface under illumination. However, in the negatively poled area, the surface potential under the illumination showed a slightly higher surface potential (∼330–360 mV). The surface potential of the MALI PTFs was recovered to similar levels or slightly higher levels than that of the as-grown state after the illumination was switched off, and the poling effect on the surface potential disappeared, as shown in Fig. 4d. We note that, since the grounded AFM tip goes to the bottom of the image (as a default position) after finishing desired scans for the poling procedures then stay there for a while, the surface potential at the bottom of the image is affected by the grounded tip effect. Thus, the bottom of the images shows somewhat different signals.33–35

(e) Corresponding line profile for each potential image: (red) as-grown state, (orange) as-poled state, (yellow) under illumination and (green) after illumination. (d) was obtained just after switching off the light. The poling bias was applied during the scanning of the surface with a scan speed of 0.5 Hz. Scale bar is 6 μm. 
To quantitatively understand the behavior of charge transfer, the corresponding surface charge density at each state is calculated through the equation of a simple parallel capacitor model:33,36 (1)where σ, εo, εr, V and d are surface charge density, dielectric permittivity, relative dielectric constant, surface potential and thickness (∼150 nm), respectively. Here, the relative dielectric constant of the MALI PTFs is assumed as 25.37,38 The surface potential and corresponding surface charge density in each state are summarized in Table 1 and detailed discussion will be provided in Fig. 5.

 Fig. 5  Schematics of charge distribution: (a) as-grown, (b) as-poled, (c) illuminated states, and (d) after illumination. The positively and negatively poled areas are indicated in blue and red, respectively. The rectangular and circular charges show, respectively, polarization and surface screening charges. The number of polarization charges is assumed as nine. On the basis of the PFM results, the positively poled area is considered as a partially switched situation. 
For further understanding the change in the surface potential, schematic diagrams were drawn as illustrated in Fig. 5. In the as-grown state (Fig. 4a and 5a), since the as-grown MALI PTFs displayed upward polarizations as shown in Fig. 1 and 2, the observed surface potential may have originated from incomplete surface screening, similar to the previous reports.33 When a voltage was applied to the ferroelectric surface through the conductive probe (Fig. 4b and 5b), the polarization could be switched when the voltage was higher than the coercive voltage and, at the same time, charges from the conductive probe could be injected into the surface of the sample.33 Since polarization was not fully switched in the downward direction under the positive voltage as previously shown in Fig. 2, the positively poled area is considered as a partially switched situation as schematically presented in Fig. 5b. The positively poled area (see region A in Fig. 4 and the left-hand side in Fig. 5b) then experiences a higher surface potential because the amount of the injected positive charges was larger than that of the polarization charges on the MALI PTF surface with downward polarization. Thus, even though polarization switching occurs in the positively poled area, the surface potential is increased by injected charges. On the other hand, a significant change in the surface potential of the negatively poled area is not observed (see region B in Fig. 4 and right-hand side in Fig. 5b). This might be due to the insufficient amount of injected charges.33 Under illumination, it is known that charge separation of electrons and holes can generally occur, after which the electrons in the solar cells are transferred toward the TiO2 layer. However, surprisingly, the observations herein showed the opposite behavior (Fig. 4c and 5c). In other words, the electrons were transferred to the surface, which could be determined by the decrease in the surface potential. The difference of surface charge density between the as-grown state (Fig. 4a) and under illumination state (Fig. 4c) is calculated to be 0.016 μC cm−2 (see Table 1), indicating that electrons of about 1.00 × 1011 cm−2 are transferred to the sample surface under the illumination. Then, the amount of surface charge density is increased by 0.018 μC cm−2 when illumination is switched off. As discussed above, the polarization charge on the MALI PTF surface is not completely screened, indicating that the charge balance is not achieved on the MALI PTF surface. Thus, the excess positive charges on the MALI PTF surface can act as a driving force to attract the electrons generated by the illumination. In fact, the driving force, i.e. attractive electrostatic force, caused by excess positive charges is calculated to be 2.09 × 10−13 N through a single charged plate model (see Fig. S6†). Due to the electron movement toward the MALI PTF surface (Fig. 5c), the surface potential becomes lower as shown in Fig. 4c. Although the change in the surface potential was observed in the positively poled area as shown in Fig. 4b, the overall behavior followed a similar pattern to the as-grown surface because of the incomplete switching of the positively poled area. Nonetheless, somewhat different behavior in the positively and negatively poled areas could still be observed (Fig. 4c). Since there was a slightly higher amount of negative charges present on the MALI surface due to the application of a negative voltage, the number of positive charges in the negatively poled area was smaller than that in the positively poled area because of charge compensation. This induces less attractive force on the electrons generated by illumination. Consequently, the negatively poled area has a relatively higher surface potential than the positively poled area. In this case, electrons of 4.38 × 1010 cm−2 are transferred to the surface. That is, the amount of transferred electrons is decreased by about 56%. Thus, it can be concluded that the interplay between polarization and screening charges can be a significant parameter for the charge transfer and its efficiency. After illumination, the surface potential returned to a similar or slightly higher value than that of the as-grown state because of having sufficient time for recombination/transport of generated electrons (Fig. 4d and 5d). Furthermore, due to the charge redistribution during the illumination, the poling effect on the surface potential disappeared. However, since the polarization is intact even after the illumination, the polarization states still can affect the charge transfer.17
Therefore, the observed results indicated that polarization and screening charges can significantly affect charge redistribution on the MALI PTF surface, and demonstrated that the modulation of the screening on the MALI PTFs acts as a crucial factor for the photovoltaic performance. In other words, the screening can affect the direction and the amount of charge transfer.
4. Conclusions
In summary, we explored the interplay between polarization and injected charges to have significant effects on the charge transfer in the MALI PTFs using PFM and KPFM. The switchable ferroelectric polarizations, as well as the piezoelectric coefficient, were observed by the PFM techniques. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the interplay between polarization and injected charges significantly affects the charge redistribution which potentially influences photovoltaic performance. In particular, we directly showed that the screening can affect the direction and the amount of charge transfer in the MALI PFTs. Even though the change in the screening charges is not significantly large, this observed phenomenon can give a clue for interpreting screening charge or polarization charge induced phenomena and potentially modulating photovoltaic performance because the amount of the change can be readily modulated by the magnitude of applied voltage or polarization charge. These results could deliver fundamental information on the ferro/piezoelectricity as well as the screening effect of perovskite materials, and their influence on photovoltaic performance. Furthermore, the results obtained could provide a new design rule regarding the ferro/piezoelectric effect for photovoltaic performance.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  (a) Topography and corresponding (b) amplitude as well as (c) phase images of PFM in MALI PTFs. (d) Histogram of phase contrast in (c). (e) Average amplitude of piezoresponse in MALI PTFs as a function of the magnitude of Vac, averaged over 25 measurements. The solid line was fitted by the least square method. All images (a–c) were obtained for the same area. Scale bar is 600 nm.	 

 	Fig. 2  (a and c) PFM phase images of box patterned domains. Red and blue dotted areas were poled by the applied voltages of −7 Vdc and 7 Vdc, respectively. The circles in (a) represent the vertical directions of polarization. (b and d) Corresponding histograms of phase contrast in red and blue areas. The poling bias was applied during the scanning of the surface with a scan speed of 0.5 Hz. Scale bar is 2 μm.	 

 	Fig. 3  (a) (top) Applied waveform as a function of time and the corresponding PFM, (middle) amplitude, and (bottom) phase spectra. Average (b) amplitude and phase loops, and (c) the corresponding piezoresponse (PR) hysteresis loop. These values were obtained from the average value of 100 measurements.	 

 	Fig. 4  (a–d) KPFM surface potential images: (a) as-grown state, (b) as-poled state, (c) under illumination of red light, and (d) after illumination. The 6 × 6 μm2 left-hand and right-hand dotted areas were poled by the applied voltages of 7 Vdc and −7 Vdc, respectively. (e) Corresponding line profile for each potential image: (red) as-grown state, (orange) as-poled state, (yellow) under illumination and (green) after illumination. (d) was obtained just after switching off the light. The poling bias was applied during the scanning of the surface with a scan speed of 0.5 Hz. Scale bar is 6 μm.

 	Fig. 5  Schematics of charge distribution: (a) as-grown, (b) as-poled, (c) illuminated states, and (d) after illumination. The positively and negatively poled areas are indicated in blue and red, respectively. The rectangular and circular charges show, respectively, polarization and surface screening charges. The number of polarization charges is assumed as nine. On the basis of the PFM results, the positively poled area is considered as a partially switched situation.
