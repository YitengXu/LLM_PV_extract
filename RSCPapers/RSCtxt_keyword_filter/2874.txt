    , Accepted 19th November 2014First published on 21st November 2014AbstractTwo novel double branched D–π–A organic dyes (DB dyes) are synthesized to investigate the influence of the linkage location in DB dyes on the performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), where phenothiazine is introduced as a donor, thiophene–benzotriazole unit as the π-bridge and cyanoacrylic acid as the electron-acceptor. The photophysical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of the dyes are systematically investigated. The results show that the location of the linkage unit has a small effect on the physical and electrochemical properties of the dyes. However, when the dyes are applied in DSSCs, an obvious decline of short-circuit current (Jsc) and open-circuit voltage (Voc) is found by moving the linkage unit from the donor part to the π-bridge part. The DSSC based on the dye DB-D with the linkage unit in the donor obtains an overall power conversion efficiency of 6.13%, which is about 68% higher than that (3.65%) of the DSSC based on the dye DB-B with the linkage unit in the π-bridge. The DB-B based device exhibits a lower efficiency due to its serious aggregation and short electron lifetime. The results indicate that the linkage location of the dyes has a big effect on the performance of the DSSCs.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) currently attract worldwide scientific research attention owing to their easy fabrication and low cost as compared to the traditional silicon-based photovoltaic devices.1 The sensitizer, one of the most important components in DSSC devices, absorbs sunlight and injects electrons into the TiO2 semiconductor. Recently the TiO2 nanowire array based photoelectrode has shown significant efficiency for DSSCs.2–5 To date, some cells with ruthenium complexes as sensitizers have achieved high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 10–11%.2,6–8 Moreover, the zinc-porphyrin sensitized DSSCs have reached the efficiency of over 12%.9–11 However, concerning the cost and limited ruthenium resources and the purification difficulty for the zinc-porphyrin dyes, metal-free organic dyes have gained more and more attention due to their advantages of high molar extinction coefficients, relatively low cost, ease of structure tuning and environmental friendliness.12–15 The metal-free organic sensitizers always contain a donor–π–bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) configuration for facilitating photo-induced charge separation. To date, sensitizers with D–π–A configuration have been extensively explored for DSSCs with promising performances.16–21
It is generally believed that increasing the light harvesting ability of the sensitizer is of great importance to obtain better overall power conversion efficiency. This can be achieved through increasing the molar extinction coefficient, enlarging the absorption region and increasing the loading amount of the dyes on TiO2 films.22 Recently, some groups have introduced the electron-withdrawing unit benzotriazole as the π-bridge to induce a red-shift of the charge transfer absorption band, improve the photo-to-electricity conversion efficiency and enhance the photo-stability of the solar cell devices.23–25 Also, our group has developed a series of double D–π–A branched organic dyes (DB dyes) with a non-conjugated alkyl linkage to connect the two separate D–π–A segments.26–28 It was found that the double D–π–A branched dye has a larger adsorption amount of the D–π–A segment on the TiO2 film compared to the single D–π–A dye. Thus the double D–π–A branched dye based cells exhibited better short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and PCE. Wang and co-workers synthesized a novel thiophene-bridged double D–π–A dye for efficient DSSCs.29 It is easy to understand that the structure modification of the organic dyes can greatly influence the performance of the sensitizer based DSSCs.30–32 In order to better understand the structure–performance relationship of DB dyes, it is necessary to study the effect of the linkage location on the performance of the DSSCs. It is expected that the linkage location of DB dyes might influence the geometrical configuration of the dyes on the TiO2 films, affecting the performance of the device.
According to the above analysis, we aimed to construct two novel DB dyes (DB-D and DB-B) with benzotriazole as the π-bridge and hexylene chain as the linkage which was linked in the donor part and in the π-bridge part, respectively. In addition, two octyl chains were incorporated at the N-position of the dyes, which not only improve the solubility of the dyes, but also reduce the intermolecular aggregation and restrain the charge recombination on the TiO2 surface. The corresponding single D–π–A branched dye SB-B was also synthesized for comparison. The chemical structures of the three dyes are shown in Fig. 1. Their photophysical, electrochemical and solar cell performances were systematically investigated.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of the materials
The synthesis procedure of SB-B, DB-D and DB-B is outlined in Scheme 1. 3-Bromo-10-octyl-10H-phenothiazine,33 3-bromo-10H-phenothiazine,34 4,7-dibromo-2-octyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole,35 and 1,6-bis(2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-2-yl)hexane36 were synthesized according to the references. 2 was synthesized according to the traditional method: N-alkylation, while the two phenothiazine borates 1 and 3 were synthesized through a Suzuki–Miyaura coupling reaction. The Suzuki coupling reaction of 4,7-dibromo-2-octyl-2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole with thiophen-2-ylboronic acid gave 4. Aldehyde 5 was prepared from 4 by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction and then converted to 6 through bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). In the next step, Suzuki coupling of 6 with compounds 1 and 3 gave aldehydes 7 and 8, respectively. Knoevenagel condensation reactions of 7 and 8 with tert-butyl 2-cyanoacetate afforded cyanoacetates, and then the cyanoacetates were hydrolyzed by trifluoroacetic acid to give SB-B and DB-D, respectively. The synthesis of dye DB-B with the hexyl chain linked in the π-spacer was started from 1,6-bis(2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-2-yl)hexane. The bromination of 1,6-bis(2H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazol-2-yl)hexane with bromine gave 9, in which the Suzuki coupling reaction of 9 with thiophen-2-ylboronic acid afforded 10 in a good yield. Next, 10 was converted to its cyanoacetate derivative 11 through a Vilsmeier–Haack reaction and a Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The bromination of 11 with NBS gave 12, and then the Suzuki coupling reaction of 12 with borate 1 afforded 13. Finally, the final acid DB-B was achieved via hydrolysis in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid. All the new compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR and HRMS.

Photophysical properties
The UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra of SB-B, DB-D and DB-B both in CH2Cl2/THF (1:1) solutions and on TiO2 films are shown in Fig. 2, and the characteristic data are recorded in Table 1. In the solution UV-Vis spectra, two distinct bands can be found for the three dyes. The first band at a shorter wavelength is attributed to the π–π* electron transition of the conjugated skeleton, and the other at a longer wavelength is ascribed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from the donor to acceptor.37 The λmax (absorption maximum wavelength) of SB-B, DB-D and DB-B are 488 (molar extinction coefficient (ε) = 41185 M−1 cm−1), 492 (ε = 88790 M−1 cm−1) and 492 nm (ε = 79225 M−1 cm−1), respectively. The λmax of the three dyes are almost the same to each other due to the alike D–π–A conjugated skeleton. The molar extinction coefficients of the three dyes (4.1 × 104 to 8.9 × 104 M−1 cm−1) are higher than the well-known sensitizer N719 (1.4 × 104 M−1 cm−1), indicating a better ability of light harvesting of these three metal-free organic dyes than that of N719.38 Owing to the double D–π–A structure, the ε of the double branched dyes DB-D and DB-B is nearly twice as high as that of SB-B. Fig. 2b shows the normalized absorption spectra of SB-B, DB-D and DB-B on 16 μm thick TiO2 films. Upon adsorption on the TiO2 surface, the λmax of SB-B, DB-D and DB-B are blue shifted 34, 25 and 39 nm, respectively, as compared to those in solution (Table 1). This is ascribed to the deprotonation of the dyes or formation of H-aggregation on the TiO2 films.39,40

In order to understand the aggregation of the three dyes on TiO2 films, a set of deprotonation experiments were conducted on three dyes in solution (CH2Cl2/THF, v/v = 1:1) by addition of an excess amount of triethylamine (TEA). As shown in Fig. 3, the maximum wavelengths of charge transfer (CT) absorption bands of the three dyes are blue-shifted to similar 467 nm in comparison with those in solution without TEA, which are induced by the deprotonation effect of TEA. Obviously, the λmax of DB-D with TEA in the solution is similar to that on the TiO2 film. That is to say, the blue-shift in the CT absorption band of DB-D during the adsorption process on TiO2 should be predominated by the deprotonation effect of the –COOH group rather than the intermolecular aggregation.41 However, the λmax of DB-B on the TiO2 film shows still blue-shift about 14 nm with respect to that with TEA in the solution. This result means that the blue-shift in the CT absorption band of DB-B during the adsorption process on TiO2 should be ascribed to both the deprotonation effect of the –COOH group and the aggregation effect of dye molecules.41 In fact, DB-B is a relative rigid molecule in comparison with DB-D, resulting in easier aggregation (see below).

Electrochemical properties
To investigate the possibility of electron injection from the excited state of the organic dyes to the conduction band (CB) of TiO2 and the regeneration of the dyes, the redox behavior was studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV) (Fig. 4, Table 1). The first oxidation versus normal hydrogen electrode (vs. NHE) was calibrated by Fc/Fc+ (0.63 V vs. NHE) corresponding to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level of the dye. As shown in Table 1, the HOMO levels of SB-B, DB-D and DB-B are 0.89, 0.90 and 0.90 V, respectively. They are more positive than the redox potential of I−/I3− (0.4 V vs. NHE),13 which means that the oxidized dyes can be regenerated effectively. The energy gaps (E0–0) between the HOMO and LUMO level calculated from the intersection points of normalized absorption and emission spectra for SB-B, DB-D and DB-B are 2.23, 2.20 and 2.21 V, respectively. The estimated excited state potentials corresponding to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level of the dyes are −1.34 V for SB-B, −1.30 V for DB-D and −1.31 V for DB-B calculated from HOMO − E0–0. The LUMO levels of the three dyes are more negative than the conduction band of TiO2 (−0.5 V vs. NHE),42 demonstrating that the three dyes have sufficient driving force for electron transfer from the excited dye molecule to the TiO2 surface. By combining the information from the photophysical and electrochemical measurements, we thereby summarize that the position of the linkage unit in the double branched dyes has a less pronounced effect on the physical and electrochemical properties.

Molecular orbital calculations
To gain further insight into the electron distribution of the dyes, the three dyes were optimized by density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G* level with the Gaussian 03W program package. Optimized structures and the electronic distribution in HOMO and LUMO levels are listed in Table 2. The electron distributions in the HOMOs of the three dyes are largely distributed along the phenothiazine–thiophene–benzotriazole system and the LUMOs are mainly concentrated at the benzotriazole–thiophene–cyanoacrylic acid system. The well overlapped HOMO and LUMO orbits on the benzotriazole unit suggest that the benzotriazole serves as an electron-trap in facilitating electron transfer from the donor to the acceptor/anchor.23 The HOMO and LUMO electronic states allow the effective electron injection from the dyes to the TiO2 surface excited after the photoexcitation.

Adsorption amount
The dye loading amounts of the three dyes on TiO2 films (16 μm) were obtained by dipping them into 0.1 M aqueous solution of NaOH and THF (1:1) and measuring the absorbance of the desorbed dye solutions.28 As listed in Table 3, the dye loading amounts of SB-B, DB-D and DB-B are 3.83 × 10−7, 2.58 × 10−7 and 3.02 × 10−7 mol cm−2, respectively. As we all know, the dye adsorption amounts are directly related to the molecular size of the dyes. The dye SB-B containing the D–π–A structure exhibits the highest loading on the TiO2 film due to its smallest size. However, the number of light-harvesting units of the double D–π–A branched dyes is higher than the single D–π–A branched molecules (for example, 2 × 2.58 × 10−7 for DB-D). In comparison with dyes DB-D and DB-B, it can be found that the dye with the alkyl chain linkage in the π-spacer shows a higher adsorption amount than the dye with the alkyl chain connected in the donor part. This phenomenon suggests that the non-conjugation connector linking at different places of double branched dyes may show different configuration on the TiO2 film, which will influence the adsorption amounts of dyes. Fig. 5 presents the plausible schematic illustration of the steric demands of DB-D and DB-B adsorbed on the TiO2 films. The connector hexylene linked on the π-bridge makes the whole DB-B molecule some relatively rigid, like “H” type, requiring smaller space of the surface of the TiO2 film. DB-D with hexylene linked on the donor position shows less rigid configuration, like “∩” type, requiring more space of the surface of the TiO2 film. In addition, according to the pioneering work,43 a large configuration moiety near the acceptor decreases the adsorbed amount of dyes on the TiO2 film when compared to the other dyes with a less steric demanding moiety near the acceptor. Thus, in comparison with DB-B, the two octyl chains on DB-D near the acceptor demand more TiO2 surface. The two factors above may cause the higher dye loading amount of DB-B than DB-D.

Photovoltaic performance of DSSCs
The light harvesting efficiency of the DSSCs sensitized by the three dyes was evaluated by the incident photo-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, as shown in Fig. 6. It can be found that all the three dyes can efficiently convert visible light into photocurrent in the region from 400 to 700 nm. It is easy to find that DB-D shows a higher IPCE value than the other two dyes. Specifically, the IPCE value for the DSSC sensitized by DB-D is more than 60% in the region of 430–590 nm and with a maximum IPCE value of 67% at 490 nm, while the IPCE values of SB-B and DB-B reach a maximum 61% at 470 nm and 58% at 470 nm. This result is in good accordance with the Jsc variation tendency obtained in J–V (current–voltage) measurements. IPCE is a product of the electron injection efficiency, light-harvesting efficiency and charge collection efficiency. For a dye-loaded film with a thickness over 10 μm, light-harvesting efficiency can be considered to be 100%.19 Since DB-D and DB-B have similar HOMO and LUMO energy levels, the different IPCE values for the two dyes may result from their different charge injection efficiencies. Dye DB-B with the connector linked in the π-bridge shows serious intermolecular aggregation, leading to lower charge injection efficiency,44 resulting in a lower IPCE value than DB-D. On the basis of aforementioned photo-physical property analysis, DB-B adsorbed on TiO2 shows larger blue-shift appearance than DB-D by comparison of λmax of two dyes in the solution.
 Fig. 6  IPCE spectra of the DSSCs based on SB-B, DB-D and DB-B. 
The detailed photovoltaic parameters of short-circuit photocurrent (Jsc), open-circuit photovoltage (Voc), fill factor (FF) and overall conversion efficiency (η) are listed in Fig. 7 and Table 3. The DSSC sensitized by DB-D exhibits the highest η of 6.13% with a Jsc of 14.39 mA cm−2, a Voc of 718 mV and a FF of 0.59. The other two devices based on sensitizers SB-B and DB-B show efficiencies of 4.32% and 3.65%, respectively. Apparently, the dye DB-D yields the highest conversion efficiency due to its highest Jsc and Voc. In comparison with single D–π–A branched dye SB-B, the efficiency of double D–π–A branched dye DB-D increases 42% due to its larger amount of light-harvesting units and nearly no aggregation on the TiO2 film. However, it is worth noting that the efficiency of the double D–π–A branched dye DB-B with the flexible alkyl chain connected in the π-spacer is even lower than SB-B. In particular, the low Jsc for DB-B can be mainly correlated to the serious aggregation. This aggregation has a deleterious effect on electron transfer from the donor to the TiO2 film, leading to lower electron injection efficiency.45
 Fig. 7  
J–V curves of the DSSCs based on SB-B, DB-D and DB-B. 
On the other hand, the lowest value of Voc of DB-B can be attributed to the recombination of the injected electron with I−/I3− in the electrolyte on the TiO2 surface and the larger extent of aggregation. These results may suggest that the connector alkyl chain should be linked in the donor part when used in the construction of non-conjugated double D–π–A branched dyes.
It has been verified that the transparent organic compound CDCA (chenodeoxycholic acid) can hinder the formation of dye aggregates, then enhance the performance of the DSSCs.46,47 Thus, the performances of the DSSCs in the presence of CDCA with various concentrations were studied. The results are summarized in Table 4, and the corresponding J–V curves are shown in Fig. 8. A concentration of 1 mM CDCA did not efficiently improve the performance of the device based on DB-D. However, when the concentration increased to 10 mM, the power conversion efficiency decreased. A possible explanation is that the amount of dye adsorbed on the TiO2 film was reduced by the co-adsorption of CDCA, resulting in a loss of active light-harvesting.26 However, upon co-adsorption with CDCA, the Jsc and Voc values of the devices based on SB-B and DB-B were improved remarkably, which can be attributed to the reduction of dye aggregation. These results indicate that DB-D with the alkyl chain linked in the donor part nearly did not aggregate on the TiO2 surface. However, the connector alkyl chain linking at the π-spacer position of DB-B causes serious aggregation. A reason is that the configuration of DB-B on the film of TiO2 shows some relatively rigid like “H” type, leading to easier aggregation. Another reason is that the long alkyl chain introduced in the donor part cannot prevent aggregation effectively.48 Thus, in comparison with DB-D, the serious aggregation of DB-B might be attributed to both effects of octyl chain linking in the donor part and the hexylene connector linking in the π-bridge part.

To further understand the electron recombination in DSSCs, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out in the dark. The Nyquist plots for the DSSCs based on the dyes without CDCA are displayed in Fig. 9, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 5. The first semicircle (Rce) is assigned to charge transfer at the counter electrode/electrolyte interface, while the second semicircle (Rrec) is accorded to charge transfer at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface.49 The Rce values of the three dyes are similar to each other due to the use of the same counter electrode and electrolyte. The Rrec values are 138.8, 115.5 and 143.1 Ω cm−2, respectively. The corresponding electron lifetimes for SB-B, DB-D and DB-B are 122, 147 and 116 ms, respectively, which are calculated by fitting the equation τr = Rrec × CPE2 (CPE2, chemical capacitance).50 The electron lifetime trend in order of DB-B < SB-B < DB-D is in good accordance with the Voc results above. This result suggests that the recombination of the injected electron with I−/I3− in the electrolyte can be more effectively suppressed by introducing the connector on the donor position in the double D–π–A branched dyes.

Conclusions
In summary, two novel benzotriazole based double D–π–A branched organic dyes (DB-D and DB-B) with the hexylene connector linked in the donor and the π-spacer position, respectively, were synthesized and applied in DSSCs. The results indicate that the linkage location of DB-D and DB-B has a small effect on the physical and electrochemical properties, but a significant impact on the dye adsorption amount, dye aggregation degree and light harvesting ability, thus leading to distinctive photovoltaic performance. In comparison with the PCE (4.32%) of the DSSC based on the single D–π–A branched analogue dye SB-B, the PCE (6.13%) of the DSSC with DB-D is enhanced to about 42%. However, the PCE (3.65%) of the DSSC with DB-B is dropped to about 16%. The hexylene chain connector linking at the π-spacer shows serious intermolecular aggregation, leading to lower electron injection efficiency and short electron lifetime. However, the hexylene chain connector linking at the donor-position can significantly restrain intermolecular aggregation and suppress the charge recombination, and thus efficiently improve the short-circuit photocurrent and the open-circuit photovoltage, leading to a higher photoelectric conversion efficiency of the DSSC. The work will pave a way for further improvement of the double D–π–A branched based organic sensitizers in the future.

THF, dioxane and toluene were distilled over sodium. 1,2-Dichloroethane and DMF were dried over a 4Å molecular sieve before use. Other solvents and reagents were of analytical grade and used without further purification. All reactions were performed under an argon atmosphere and monitored by TLC. Chromatographic separations were carried out on silica gel (200–300 or 300–400 mesh).

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker 400 MHz instrument in CDCl3, DMSO-d6 and THF-d8. HRMS spectra were recorded on an Agilent Technologies 1290 Infinity mass spectrophotometer. The melting point was measured on a SGW X-4B microscopic melting point apparatus. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectra of the dyes in solution were recorded on a Shimadzu UV-2450 spectrophotometer. The PL spectra were recorded on a Fluorolog III photoluminescence spectrometer. The absorption spectra of the dyes adsorbed on TiO2 films were recorded on a UV-3010 spectrophotometer. Electrochemical redox potentials were obtained by cyclic voltammetry (CV) using a three electrode cell on an electrochemistry workstation (e-corder (ED 401) potentiostat) at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. The dye adsorbed TiO2 films were used as working electrodes. Ag/AgCl (3 M in KCl) was used as a reference electrode and a platinum wire was utilized as the counter electrode. Tetrabutylammoniumhexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6, 0.1 M in dry acetonitrile) was used as the supporting electrolyte. The ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple acted as an internal potential reference. The electrochemical redox potentials of dyes versus NHE were calibrated by the addition of 0.63 V to the potentials versus (Fc/Fc+). The incident monochromatic photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra were recorded on a Spectral Products DK240 monochromator from the 400 to 800 nm region. The current–voltage characteristics were recorded on a Keithley 2400 source meter under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mV cm−2) illumination with a standard solar light simulator (Oriel, Model: 91192). The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were recorded on a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation under dark conditions.

Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
The TiO2 films (∼16 μm in thickness) were fabricated according to a previous procedure.51 The TiO2 electrodes were immersed in a solution of the dyes for 24 h in the dark (0.5 mM dye in DCM/THF (1:1)). The dye-adsorbed TiO2 films were washed with THF and dried. The dye-sensitized TiO2/FTO glass films were assembled into a sandwiched type together with the Pt/FTO counter electrode. The electrolyte (0.6 M 1-metyl-3-propylimidazoliumiodide (PMII), 0.05 M LiI, 0.10 M guanidiniumthiocyanate, 0.03 M I2 and 0.5 M tert-butylpridine) in acetonitrile/valeronitrile (85:15) was injected from a hole made on the counter electrode into the space between the sandwiched cells. The active area of the dye coated TiO2 was 0.16 cm2.
