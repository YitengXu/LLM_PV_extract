    , Accepted 1st February 2019First published on 1st February 2019AbstractThe past few years have witnessed an impressive development of all-inorganic halide perovskite nanocrystals. In this report, a series of CsPbBrxI3−x nanocrystal/carbon nanotube (CsPbBrxI3−x NC/CNT, x = 3, 2, 1.5, 1) hybrid photoelectrodes have been fabricated and further employed in photoelectrochemical cells. Benefiting from the high conductivity of CNTs, the hybrid samples show accelerated charge separation and transfer actions after photoexcitation. Moreover, increasing the I/Br ratio in CsPbBrxI3−x nanocrystals accounts for a wider adsorption range but inferior phase stability, which calls for a delicate balance. As a result, the highest photocurrent density of 420 μA cm−2 is finally achieved by CsPbBr1.5I1.5 NC/CNT (200), which corresponds to a 7.7-fold improvement over the prototype CsPbBr3. This report offers an in-depth understanding of the charge transfer behavior along with photoelectrochemical performance of CsPbBrxI3−x nanocrystal/CNT, which can surely stimulate metal halide perovskite nanocrystal-based hybrid materials for promising optoelectronic, photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical applications.
Introduction
As an attractive research topic over the past few years, metal halide perovskites have been demonstrated with remarkable properties (e.g., high light extinction coefficient, tuneable band structure and facile charge transfer) and thus have been applied to a wide range of optoelectronic devices including solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), photodetectors, etc.1–5 Notably, a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7% has been delivered in the state-of-the-art perovskite solar cell device,6 as well as an external quantum efficiency exceeding 20% in LEDs,7,8 which conceivably will be continuously updated.
Motivated by the impressive advances achieved in optoelectronic applications, very recently the employment of metal halide perovskites for photochemical applications has attracted intense interest. For instance, our group has for the first time reported the photocatalytic CO2 reduction by CsPbBr3 nanocrystal in nonaqueous solutions,9 or in gaseous phase,10 which has inspired a number of studies on photocatalytic CO2 conversion11–15 and other light-driven organic synthesis such as 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) polymerization,16 selective oxidation of benzylic alcohols17,18 α-alkylation of aldehydes19 by metal halide perovskite materials. Besides, MAPbI3 microcrystal powders have also been reported to afford a photocatalytic HI splitting reaction for H2 evolution, exhibiting a promising solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency.20–23
Other than the aforementioned particulate photocatalytic systems, fabricating semiconductor materials into photoelectrodes to perform photoelectrocatalysis is known to exhibit numerous attractive advantages.24–27 For example, the applied external bias is beneficial for the photo-induced charge separation and transfer, thereby availing the charge collection efficiency.28,29 Moreover, the applied external bias also increases the redox potential of the electrons or holes, hence contributing their injection across the semiconductor-liquid junction towards high-rate chemical reactions.30,31 Thus, recently researchers have encapsulated the solar cell devices into water-proof materials to conduct the water splitting under light illumination and external bias.32–35
In this work, CsPbBrxI3−x NCs with superior stability have been selected as archetypes to explore their photoelectrochemical applications. In addition, CsPbBrxI3−x NC/carbon nanotube hybrid electrodes have also been assembled. Electrochemical and transient spectroscopic methods have been used to investigate the effect of introducing CNT and I dopant on photoelectrochemical performance. The results revealed that the charge transfer and light absorption capability are significantly enhanced by CNT incorporation and ion doping, respectively, and a multiple improved photocurrent density is achieved on an optimized CsPbBr1.5I1.5 NC/CNT (200) based photoelectrode. This work provides a simple but effective method to shed light on the photoelectrochemical properties of metal halide perovskite materials, along with guiding significance on its potential application in the future.
Experimental
Chemicals and materials
Octadecene (ODE, 90%) and oleic acid (OA, 90%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Lead bromide (PbBr2, 99.0%), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.0%), caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 99.9%), oleylamine (OLA, 80–90%), carbon nanotube (CNT, multi-walled, >70%), benzoquinone (99%) and ethyl acetate were purchased from Aladdin. Toluene, dichloromethane, acetone, ethanol and hydrochloric acid (HCl, 36–38%) were purchased from Chemical Reagents Factory of Guangzhou. 4A molecular sieves were added in solvents to remove any remaining water before use.
Purification of CNT
The commercial CNTs were purified via an acid treatment beforehand. In detail, the CNTs were dispersed into concentrated HCl, followed with an ultrasonic washing treatment for 8 h at room temperature. Afterwards, the CNTs were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 3 min, and further washed by deionized water and ethanol 3 times to remove the acid. Finally, the CNTs were re-dispersed into toluene to afford a uniform colloid solution (0.5 mg mL−1).
Synthesis of the CsPbBrxI3−x NC
CsPbBrxI3−x (x = 0, 1, 1.5, 2) NC was prepared by a hot-injection method according to a previous report.36 Typically, an Cs-oleate precursor was prepared firstly by dissolving the Cs2CO3 (0.814 g) into ODE (40 mL) with OA (2.5 mL) at 120 °C under vacuum for 1 h, and at 150 °C in a N2 atmosphere until all the Cs2CO3 was completely dissolved. Particularly, the Cs-oleate precursor must be preheated to 150 °C before the subsequent hot injection synthesis procedure since it would precipitate at room temperature.
To synthesize the CsPbBrxI3−x nanocrystals, ODE (5 mL) and PbX2 (0.188 mmol, X = I, Br or their mixture) were added into a 25-mL 2-neck flask and dried at 120 °C under vacuum for 1 h with continuous stirring. OA (0.5 mL) and OAm (0.5 mL) were then injected and the whole system was refilled with N2 and heated to 180 °C. Subsequently Cs-oleate precursor solution (0.4 mL) was quickly injected into the 2-neck flask under a N2 flow and 5 s later the reaction was inhibited by a fast ice bath cooling process. The CsPbBrxI3−x nanocrystals products were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and then dispersed in dry toluene (5 mL). The dispersion was further centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 3 min, after which the precipitate was reserved for subsequent rinsing with ethyl acetate. Finally, the purified precipitate was collected and re-dispersed in anhydrous toluene (1000, 900, 800 and 600 μL) to form CsPbBrxI3−x NC solution with a different concentration.
Preparation of CsPbBrxI3−x NC/CNT composite based photoelectrode
Firstly, CsPbBrxI3−x NC colloidal solution was mixed with CNT dispersion solution. In order to optimize the amount of the CNT, the concentration of CsPbBrxI3−x NC was maintained the same by mixing NC colloidal solution with different amounts of CNT dispersion (0, 100, 200 and 400 μL) giving a total volume of 1 mL, as presented in Table S1.† A centrifugal–deposition method was utilized to deposit the CsPbBrxI3−x and CsPbBrxI3−x NC/CNT thin-film onto the FTO conducting glass substrate. The FTO glasses (1 cm × 2.5 cm) were thoroughly cleaned via sequential sonicating in deionized water, alcohol and acetone. Before centrifugation, the CsPbBrxI3−x NC or CsPbBrxI3−x NC/CNT toluene/ethyl acetate suspension (2 mL) was added into a 10 mL centrifuge tube, and then an FTO glass was subsequently laid inside it with the conducting side facing down. The deposition process was conducted at 6000 rpm for 2 min, and the as-fabricated films were dried at 70 °C for 30 min under vacuum to remove residual solvents.
Characterization
Powder XRD patterns were obtained on a Rigaku MiniFlex X-ray diffractometer. The morphology and nanostructure were recorded by FE-SEM (SU8010) and TEM (Tecnai G2 F30). The UV-vis absorption spectra were acquired on a UV-vis spectrometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). The photoluminescence (PL) spectra and the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) decay spectra were characterized on a photoluminescence spectrometer (FLS980, Edinburgh Instruments Ltd.) with a laser excitation of 369.6 nm. A triexponential decay kinetic was used to fit the data of the TRPL decay curves, and the formula of the average PL life times (τaverage) is listed below:  τaverage = (A1τ12 + A2τ22 + A3τ32)/(A1τ1 + A2τ2 + A3τ3)
Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS)
A regeneratively amplified Ti:sapphire laser source (Coherent Legend, 800 nm, 150 fs, 5 mJ per pulse, and 1 kHz repetition rate) and Helios (Ultrafast Systems LLC) spectrometers were equipped for transient absorption tests. The pump light was generated by frequency-doubling the 75% of 800 nm output in a BaB2O4 (BBO) crystal and was focused at the sample with a beam waist of about ∼360 μm. Meanwhile the white light continuum (420–780 nm) probe light was produced by concentrating the remaining 800 nm output into a sapphire window. The pump repetition frequency was synchronized to 500 Hz by a mechanical chopper, while the probe and reference beams which were split from the white light continuum were sent into a fibre optics-coupled multichannel spectrometer by complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor sensors with a frequency of 1 kHz.
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterizations
The photoelectrochemical tests were measured on a Zennium electrochemical workstation (Zahner) under a 3-electrode configuration in which a Pt mesh served as counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) as the reference electrode and the prepared CsPbBrxI3−x or CsPbBrxI3−x NC/CNT film as working electrode.
The electrolyte was prepared by dissolving TBAPF6 (0.1 M) and benzoquinone (4 mM) into dry dichloromethane. An Xe lamp (LSXS-150, ZOLIX Instruments, 150 W) with an AM 1.5G filter was equipped to offer simulated solar illumination, and the light intensity was calibrated to 150 mW cm−2 with an NREL-Si solar cell.
Results and discussion
A commonly used hot-injection method was adopted to synthesize the CsPbBrxI3−x NC. As shown in Fig. 1a, the archetype CsPbBr3 NC prepared by the hot injection method had a good dispersibility in the toluene solvent, and XRD patterns indicated that the as-prepared NC possessed a cubic phase (Fig. 1b). Accordingly, a cubic morphology with an average size of 7.7 nm was observed in the TEM image (Fig. S1a†), in addition, the corresponding high-resolution TEM image further confirmed its high crystallinity (Fig. S1b†). To prepare the CsPbBr3 NC/CNT composites, the CsPbBr3 NC colloidal solution was well-mixed with the CNT dispersion solution by sonication. It is noteworthy that the commercial CNT was treated by an acid-treatment before use to remove impurities (e.g., metal oxide). Obviously, a much smoother surface was displayed in the purified sample as well as a univocal XRD pattern which was indexed to individual CNT (as illustrated in Fig. S2 and S3†). After incorporating CNTs, the colour of CsPbBr3 NC solution turned from light green to dark olive and the resultant composite still possessed high dispersibility in toluene solvent. As demonstrated in Fig. 1c, the TEM measurements further claimed that the NCs were densely and closely stacked onto the surface of CNTs. Subsequently, depositing the CsPbBr3 NC or CsPbBr3 NC/CNT composite onto the FTO glass substrate was performed by a centrifugal–cast method. The photoluminescence intensity of the pristine CsPbBr3 NC thin film was gradually quenched under ultraviolet radiation (365 nm) as the CNT amount increased (Fig. 1d). The cross-sectional SEM images demonstrated that the CsPbBr3 NCs stacked onto the FTO electrode to form a thin-film with a thickness of ∼1.1 μm (Fig. 1e). Interestingly, the film thicknesses were little changed when introducing the CNTs (Fig. 1f–h). Moreover, the CNTs clearly penetrated in the film, forming a 3D cross network. The absorption behaviour of the CsPbBr3 NC and CsPbBr3 NC/CNT (100, 200 and 400) thin films were further tested. As illustrated in Fig. 2, CsPbBr3 NC is featured with a light absorption edge at ∼518 nm, corresponding to a bandgap of 2.39 eV. It can be clearly observed that the absorbance of the CsPbBr3 NC/CNT composite film was significantly increased compared with the pristine CsPbBr3 NC due to the interband absorption of CNT.37

The photoelectrochemical (PEC) characterizations were subsequently conducted in a 3-electrode configuration under AM 1.5G illumination (150 mW cm−2). It is worth noting that the PEC method is a powerful tool to probe the physical and chemical properties of metal perovskite material. Routine PEC tests including cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), spectroelectrochemistry have been successfully adopted to detect the band structure and the charge transfer behaviour of metal halide perovskites, providing significant guidance towards novel material design and device optimization.38–41 In this work the electrolyte was prepared by dissolving 0.1 M TBAPF6, 4 mM benzoquinone into anhydrous dichloromethane, where TBAPF6 served as the supporting electrolyte for enhancing the conductivity while benzoquinone acted as a redox couple to capture the photoelectrons of CsPbBr3. As shown in Fig. 3a, the amperometric I–t curves plotted at −0.4 V Ag/AgCl demonstrated the photocurrent responses were highly reproducible upon several light on/off cycles. Importantly, compared with the individual CsPbBr3 NC photoelectrode, CsPbBr3 NC/CNTs hybrid ones efficiently boosted the photocurrent densities (both transient and steady values, as shown in Table S2†), and particularly the highest 2.6-fold enhancement was observed in the optimized CsPbBr3 NC/CNT (200) sample (206 μA cm−2). Furthermore, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to detect the charge transfer process. Similarly, a large arc in the testing frequency range was observed in all samples, and it was fitted by a simple RC circuit subsequently (Fig. 3b). As a result, the charge transfer resistance was calculated as 18271 Ω for CsPbBr3 NC, and 13943 Ω, 9153 Ω, 5138 Ω for CsPbBr3 NC/CNT (100, 200 and 400), respectively. Evidently, the transfer resistance was significantly reduced after cooperating with CNT,42 implying a more facilitated charge separation and transfer process which can be ascribed to the superior conductivity of CNT. To confirm this deduction, photoluminescence (PL) spectra were measured with an excitation wavelength of 369.6 nm. As shown in Fig. 3c, all the samples exhibited a coincident PL emission peak at 513 nm originating from CsPbBr3 NC. However, the PL emission intensity was quenched by comparing pristine CsPbBr3 NC with CsPbBr3 NC/CNT composites, which continuously declined with gradually increasing the CNT amount. Especially, the decrement of PL intensity was measured to be as high as 88% for the CsPbBr3 NC/CNT (400) sample. Furthermore, the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) tests further indicated that the PL decay kinetics were clearly accelerated in the CsPbBr3/CNT hybrids (Fig. 3d). Accordingly, the decay curves were fitted with a tri-exponential decay kinetic and the resultant average PL lifetimes (τaverage) are listed in Table 1. The τaverage dropped from 43.33 ns to 32.00 ns as the CNT amount increased from 0 to 400 μL. Based on the PL and TRPL tests, it can be concluded that CNTs can accelerate the separation of the photo-generated electron–hole pair in CsPbBr3 NC and thereby suppress the potential charge carrier recombination, which further contributes to a higher photocurrent response. However, it is noteworthy that the optimal photocurrent density occurred in the CsPbBr3 NC/200 μL sample but not the CsPbBr3 NC/400 μL sample with the most facile charge transport. This phenomenon can be explained as excessive black CNT would shield the light absorption of CsPbBr3 NC (Fig. 2), thus prejudicing the stimulation of CsPbBr3 NC.

To elucidate the impact of the CNT on the ultrafast carrier dynamics of CsPbBr3 NC such as charge separation, transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was performed. As shown in Fig. 4a, a main peak emerged at around 510 nm, which can be attributed to the recovery of ground-state bleaching (GSB). Furthermore, the corresponding decay kinetics were fitted, and the parameters are listed in Table S3.† Compared with the CsPbBr3 NC, both the fast and slow time component process of CsPbBr3 NC/CNT (100, 200 and 400) were accelerated simultaneously, which can be interpreted as an efficient charge carrier extraction from the excited-state state of CsPbBr3 NC to the CNT.43,44 Therefore, electrochemical and optical characterizations conjointly verified that CNT was beneficial to the fast charge transfer process, while the optimum CNT amount is 200 μL.

In order to further promote photoelectrochemical performances, we also alloyed CsPbBr3 NC with iodide composition to prepare mixed-halide CsPbBrxI3−x NC with a wider absorption range. The TEM and HRTEM images showed that the domain size of the CsPbBrxI3−x NCs were similar to that of CsPbBr3 NC (Fig. S4†). The XRD patterns revealed that CsPbBrxI3−x (x = 2, 1.5, 1, 0) NC samples were indexed to the pure cubic phase (Fig. S5†), which can be well-preserved after cooperation with CNTs. Similar to the CsPbBr3 NC/CNT nanostructure, CsPbBrxI3−x NC were closely packed onto the surface of CNT as verified by the corresponding TEM images (Fig. S6†). Forward spectroscopic analysis revealed that enlarging the I/Br ratio in CsPbBrxI3−x NC advantageously broadened the UV-vis absorption range, which can be further corroborated by a significant red-shift of the PL peak. Moreover, in the cases of the CsPbBrxI3−x NC/CNT hybrids, the PL decayed faster than those without CNTs as expected (Fig. S7, Table S5†). Subsequently, we assembled all the samples into thin-films to perform the photoelectrochemical tests (Fig. S8a†). It is noteworthy that during the photoelectrode preparation process, phase transition occurred in the CsPbBrI2 NC sample as can be seen from its pristine colour change from dark red to yellow when exposed to the ambient environment (Fig. S8b–d†). Such poor stability was further confirmed in the XRD tests. Therefore, much care should be taken during the photoelectrochemical tests. In addition, CsPbI3 NC possessed an even poorer phase stability, which made it challenging to endure the photoelectrochemical tests, therefore it was absent in the following tests. To make a fair comparison, the thickness of the thin-films was adjusted to about 1.1 μm (Fig. S9†). As shown in Fig. 5a and Table S4,† the photocurrent density increased from 88.7 μA cm−2 to 118 μA cm−2 when varying the Br/I ratio from 2 to 1, benefiting from the expanded light absorption range. However, further decreasing the Br/I ratio to 0.5 was detrimental to the performance, due to the aforementioned phase transition. The photocurrent responses were further enhanced after mixing the CsPbBrxI3−x NC with the CNTs, and the highest photocurrent density of 417 μA cm−2 was achieved by the CsPbBr1.5I1.5 NC/CNT sample (Fig. 5b). In accordance with the CsPbBr3/CNT hybrid, such photocurrent increments were also ascribed to the ameliorative charge transfer, as confirmed by the TRPL and EIS measurements (Fig. S10, Table S6†).

Conclusions
In summary, our study implements the CsPbBr3 NC into a prototypical photoelectrochemical reduction of benzoquinone. Moreover, the introduction of conductive CNT facilitates the photo-generated electron–hole pair separation, which significantly improves the photocurrent density. In particular, it is found that the loading amount should be carefully optimized since excessive CNT will compete with perovskite NC in light absorption. In addition, alloying iodide to prepare CsPbBrxI3−x NC could broaden the visible-light-absorption range and further boost the PEC performance. As a result, the highest photocurrent density of 417 μA cm−2 was attained on the CsPbBr1.5I1.5 NC/CNT (200) sample, corresponding to a 2.6-fold increment compared to its individual CsPbBr1.5I1.5 NC, or 7.7-fold increment compared with the starting CsPbBr3 NC. This method offers an efficient and facile way for material screening towards the fabrication of high-performance metal halide perovskite thin-films, and their further applications in photoelectrochemical synthetic cells for solar-fuel production or light-driven organic synthesis.
