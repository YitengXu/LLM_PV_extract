    , Accepted 20th March 2019First published on 20th March 2019AbstractThe fabrication of organic photovoltaic devices from aqueous solar nanoparticle (ASNP) inks or solar paints is challenging, driven by the often competing requirements of maintaining emulsion stability whilst simultaneously facilitating surface wettability. In this paper, we have investigated multiple pathways for successfully coating ASNP inks across a range of fabrication scales. Initial attempts at roll-to-roll (R2R) printing of ASNP inks focussed simply on optimising film quality by altering the free-SDS concentration in the ASNP inks. Although high quality films were produced, the prepared R2R printed devices exhibited low performance, driven by the high SDS content of the printed films. Consequently, a detailed study of the effect of surface ozone treatments on ASNP film formation was undertaken. The work function, contact angle, surface composition and surface morphology were investigated as a function of surface ozone treatment for a range of PEDOT:PSS hole-transport layer (HTL) electrodes on small-scale devices. Optimised ozone surface treatments yielded nanoparticle organic photovoltaic (NP-OPV) device efficiencies of 1.5%, with the surface characterisation revealing that the ozone treatment of the HTL films predominantly results in increased PSS surface concentration. Transferring these results to R2R scale devices showed that surface ozone treatments can be used to successfully coat medium SDS content ASNP films of good quality resulting in large area devices with an efficiency of 0.45%; highlighting the role of surface energy control in determining device performance of R2R OPV devices fabricated from solar paints.
1. Introduction
Driven by the potential for large-scale fabrication (on account of their flexible, lightweight nature and intrinsically cost-effective manufacture), organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have been one of the most researched alternative energy sources over the past few decades.1,2 Moreover, several life cycle analyses have shown that, in comparison with conventional inorganic solar cells, OPVs offer reduced cumulative energy demand, energy payback time and greenhouse gas emissions.3,4 The photoactive layers of these solar cells are typically based on blends of organic electronic electron-donating semiconducting polymers with electron-accepting macromolecules (such as fullerene derivatives) deposited from solution onto hole transporting electrode layers. To date, research has been primarily focussed on laboratory scale solution processing techniques (such as spin-coating) to fabricate and optimise small-scale OPV devices; delivering power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in excess of 13%.5,6
More recently, a few groups around the world have started to explore upscaling OPV device fabrication using roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing; encompassing a range of coating and printing techniques such as slot-die coating, flexographic printing and screen printing.7 These processes can be used to produce hundreds of metres of stacked multilayers (typically consisting of electrode, photoactive layer and hole and electron transport layers) printed or coated onto flexible plastic substrates.7–9 However, R2R processing of conventional photoactive layers faces considerable challenges related to the detrimental environmental and human health impacts caused by the toxic and hazardous organic solvents that are typically needed to dissolve the associated organic electronic materials.10
To address these issues, a variety of alternative “green chemistry” approaches have been attempted. For example, deposition of the active layer from water/alcohol has been achieved through employing side-chain modifications of semiconducting polymers,11,12 which may in turn have negative effects on the electrical properties of the polymer, as well as non-optimal phase-separation between the donor and acceptor components. An alternative approach involves precipitation of surfactant-free nanoparticles in alcohol, with devices fabricated from P3HT:ICBA nanoparticles reaching an efficiency of 4%.13 However, these materials are inappropriate for R2R processing due to the instability of the produced emulsions, with major aggregation observed within hours.14
To avoid such issues, a number of researchers have been investigating nanoparticle dispersions of electron donor and acceptor organic electronic materials in water via a surfactant using the mini-emulsion method thus formulating aqueous solar nanoparticle (ASNP) inks.15,16 Early efforts have proven the versatility of these ASNP inks synthesised from a wide range of electron acceptors and donors, with the performance of spin-coated inverted nanoparticle organic photovoltaic (NP-OPV) devices increasing in recent years from 1.9 to 3.8%17,18 with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) as surfactant and simple dialysis for purification whereas an efficiency up to 7.5% have been achieved for a high performing donor:acceptor system with Pluronic F127 as surfactant and the utilization of complex thermal cycling during purification to remove larger quantities of surfactant.19 The fabrication of NP-OPV devices requires control of the content of free and surface-bonded surfactant in the ASNP inks to avoid both nanoparticle aggregation and dewetting during deposition.20 Optimisation studies have demonstrated that the free surfactant concentration is critical in determining the wetting properties of the produced ASNP inks; inks with an optimum SDS concentration have previously been shown to have a surface tension around 48 mN m−1.21 The wetting properties of ASNP inks can also be improved by ozone treating the surface onto which the ASNP ink is cast as shown by Bag et al.22 and Xie et al.,23 who used UV-ozone (UVO) and plasma treatment respectively. While some work has been conducted on small scale NP-OPV devices prepared from these inks, the key factors involved in R2R processing of large-scale NP-OPVs from the ASNP inks remain to be clarified. Practically, the main challenge of R2R processing of ASNP inks is related to the wetting issues that are encountered during coating.24 To date, successful R2R coated NP-OPV devices have only been fabricated through the addition of a non-ionic fluorosurfactant to improve the wetting properties of ASNP inks.24
In this paper, the role of surface energy control, using both free surfactant concentration and ozone surface treatment, in the fabrication of NP-OPV devices is investigated across a range of fabrication scales. The ASNP inks were based on blends of low-cost poly(3-hexylthiophene) electron donors and indene-C60 multiadduct electron accepting (P3HT:ICxA) pairs, since these inks have previously been optimized for large scale synthesis and OPV fabrication via spin-coating.25 Detailed characterisation of ozone surface treatments on a range of hole transport layers (HTLs) is used to determine the optimal balance between free surfactant concentration and ozone treatment as well as the mechanisms that underpin surface energy control in laboratory scale devices. Consequently, it is shown that these learnings can be transferred to R2R fabrication of NP-OPV devices at large scale; highlighting the importance of surface energy control in determining performance in nanoparticle based solar inks/paints.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Materials
Poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Mn 20 kDa) and indene-C60 multiadducts (ICxA) were synthesised in house as previously published.25 The synthesised ICxA is a mixture of 36% indene-C60 monoadduct (ICMA), 51% indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA), and 13% indene-C60 trisadduct (ICTA).25–27 Chloroform (CF), calcium (purity ∼99.999%), aluminium (purity ∼99.999%), sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS, purity ∼98%), zinc acetate dihydrate, potassium hydroxide, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetic acid, methanol, and acetone were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. For OPV fabrication, patterned-ITO coated glass substrates (12.5 × 17.5 × 0.7 mm) with a surface resistance of 15 Ω square−1 and PET films (125 μm × 305 mm × 100 m) were widely used for small and large-scale devices, and purchased from Xin Yan Technology Limited and Vic Plastics, respectively. Silver ink, used to formulate charge collecting silver grids onto PET films, were supplied by Novacentrix. Three types of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) were used as hole transport layers or electrodes; PEDOT:PSS (Clevios P VP AI 4083), PEDOT:PSS (Clevios HTL Solar), and PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000) were supplied from Heraeus.
2.2 Preparation of aqueous solar nanoparticle inks
The preparation method of upscaling aqueous solar nanoparticle inks (100 mL) from P3HT:ICxA was reported in our previous work21,28 and is principally conducted via the mini-emulsion method with crossflow ultrafiltration process for purification.15,16 The sequential steps of this method are preparing organic and aqueous phase solutions, macro-emulsions, mini-emulsions, a solvent evaporation, and crossflow ultrafiltration. P3HT:ICxA nanoparticles were prepared with a (1:0.8) ratio of donor:acceptor pairs. First of all, the soluble P3HT:ICxA in chloroform with a concentration of 30 mg mL−1 formed the organic phase (300 g), and the aqueous phase (566 g) was prepared from the soluble SDS surfactant in Milli-Q water with a concentration of ∼12 mg mL−1. The organic and aqueous phases were combined to form a macro-emulsion (865 g). The produced macro-emulsion was then converted to a mini-emulsion (863 g) using a Hielscher ultrasound type UIP1000hdT (1000 W, 20 kHz) with a 22 mm diameter sonotrode, and the parameters of ultrasonic treatment were 10 min, 60% amplitude and 450–500 W. Then, the organic solvent was removed by evaporation achieved through continuously heating at 65 °C for 4 h and stirring. The nanoparticle suspension (540 g) was then purified by crossflow ultrafiltration – setup with a Vivaflow 200 crossflow cassette (supplied by Sartorius) connected to a pump with 1.25 bar pressure and equipped with a PES membrane with a cut-off at 10 kDa (MWCO). The purification of ASNP inks from free-SDS was controlled by a dilution factor for each ultrafiltration step, one dilution factor is determined by one run-through of the ultrafiltration process as the following 100 g of ASNP ink is diluted to 500 g which is subjected to ultrafiltration to eliminate 400 mL of water/SDS mixture to end up with 100 g of ASNP ink. The ratio between the diluted ASNP ink to concentrated ink represents dilution factor of 51 (DF1). Three 100 g batches of ASNP inks were prepared, with dilution factors ranging from low (LDF, 55, or DF5) to medium (MDF, 58, or DF8) to high (HDF, 512, or DF12). In addition, 15 batches of ASNP inks with various dilution factors of DF1 to DF15 (515) were produced with volumes of 6 g each.
2.3 Device fabrication

2.3.1 Small-scale NP-OPV devices. 
Small-scale NP-OPV devices were fabricated with a layer structure of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ASNP layer/Ca/Al. The sequence of steps for device fabrication started with pre-clearing the patterned ITO substrates with water, acetone and IPA in a sonication bath for 5 min each. The OPV substrates were dried with nitrogen and subsequently exposed to UVO for 20 min to remove other contaminations and improve the wetting properties of the PEDOT:PSS inks. The PEDOT:PSS layers were then formed onto the pre-cleaned OPV substrates by spin-coating with 5000 rpm for 60 s, yielding films with a thickness of 35 ± 5 nm. The PEDOT:PSS films were dried for 20 min at 150 °C in a fume hood, and exposed to UVO for various times (0–30 min). The ASNP inks with HDF (512) were used to formulate the active layer with a thickness of 68 ± 3 nm by spin-coating for 60 s at 2000 rpm onto the PEDOT:PSS layers. The ASNP films were dried at 110 °C for 5 min in the fume-hood, prior to being dried again with the same conditions but under a nitrogen atmosphere in a glove-box. The thermal deposition of calcium/aluminium (Ca/Al) was performed at a chamber pressure of 2 × 10−6 Torr, with thicknesses of 30 nm for Ca and 100 nm for Al achieved.


2.3.2 Large-scale NP-OPV devices. 
Large-area OPV devices were fabricated with a conventional OPV architecture (PET/silver grid/PH1000/ASNP/ZnO/Al). All wet-processing layers were deposited on a solar-1 coating line from Grafisk Maskinfabrik either by flexographic printing (silver only), or by slot-die coating using a coating head developed by DTU Energy conversion. The Al electrodes were deposited by R2R sputter coater (Semicore equipment, Inc). Silver grids were flexographically printed onto PET substrates using an anilox roller with an ink loading of 1.5 cm3 m−2 using a web speed of 20 m min−1 and drying ovens of 2 × 2 metres at 140 °C. The PEDOT:PSS inks were based on 1 L of PH1000 with 265 mL IPA and 65 mL DMSO sonicated for 60 s and followed by the addition of 0.1 wt% of FSO-surfactant. The ink was slot-die coated with a dry thickness of ∼200 nm with coating conditions of 1.5 m min−1 and thermal annealing at 140 °C. Initial assessment of ASNP films was achieved by slot-die coating the various dilution factor ASNP inks using a R2R (small) slot-die coating head with a single stripe onto PH1000 films which were treated with corona treatments for various intensities (0–100 W m2 min−1). Large scale assessment of LDF, MDF and HDF ASNP inks was achieved by slot-die coating films using a 16 stripe head and a syringe pump for ink flow with a web speed of ∼0.4 m min−1, flow rate ∼0.4 mL min−1 and thermal annealing at 140 °C. The dry thicknesses of the ASNP films were theoretically determined to ∼340 nm for LDF and MDF inks. Under this coating condition, the ASNP inks with HDF were additionally slot-die coated onto corona-treated PH1000 films. ZnO nanoparticles dispersed in acetone with a concentration of 10 mg mL−1 were slot-die coated on top of the ASNP films using a web speed of 2 m min−1, a pump rate of 2 mL min−1, and thermal annealing at 80 °C and 140 °C for the first and second ovens on the print line, respectively. Dry thicknesses of the produced ZnO films were ∼15 nm. The stacked multilayers were cut into a sheet of an OPV module which was comprised of 16 stripes with length and width of (130 × 15 mm) of each stripe. We sputter deposited the Al electrodes with a thickness of 100 nm through a shadow mask at a pressure of 10−6 Torr as previously described.29 The NP-OPV devices used in this work had an area of 1 × 1 cm2, and were connected to copper tape prior to encapsulation. A small amount of UV curable epoxy (Seayu UV3316) was spread onto the Al electrode face of the devices before being sandwiched between two pieces of PET substrate, with both substrate sides subjected to UV curing for 1 min each.

2.4 Current density–voltage testing
Current density–voltage (J–V) measurements were performed for small-scale NP-OPV devices under illumination from a Newport Class AAA solar simulator with an AM 1.5 spectrum filter using a computer-controlled Keithley 2400 sourcemeter. The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW cm−2 using a silicon reference solar cell (FHG-ISE). Masked devices with an area of 0.04 cm2 were tested under a nitrogen atmosphere in glovebox after annealing at 140 °C for 4 min. For large area devices (area of 1.0 cm2), the Keithley 2400 sourcemeter was once again employed for J–V measurements but illumination was supplied by a sulphur plasma lamp with intensity calibrated via a silicon reference solar cell with a KG5 filter.
2.5 Characterisation
The surface morphology of PEDOT:PSS films and ASNP films were investigated by an Asylum Research Cypher atomic force microscope (AFM) in alternative contact (AC) mode. The AFM images were conducted on the PEDOT:PSS films spin-coated on ITO/glass substrates and the ASNP films spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS films exposed to UVO for times ranging from 0 to 30 min (5 minute intervals). The AFM samples were prepared under the same conditions used for fabricating the NP-OPV devices. Optical microscopy of the ASNP films was performed using the AFM camera setup. Film thickness measurements were obtained with a Bruker Dektak XT surface profilometer on glass substrates. The work function of pristine and UVO-treated PEDOT:PSS films were monitored by a photoelectron spectroscopy in air (PESA) model AC-2 from Riken Keiki. The contact angle of the ASNP inks with high dilution factor were investigated by the pendent drop method using an Attension Theta optical tensiometer from Biolin Scientific.
3. Results and discussion
3.1 A direct R2R coating transfer of ASNP inks with various dilution factors
Our previous work on the development of ASNP inks focussed on the large-scale synthesis of NP materials.28 This work showed that surface energy (and therefore wetting of the inks) could be directly controlled by surfactant concentration and that optimising the surfactant concentration for small-scale devices resulted in a maximum power conversion efficiency of 0.67%. The results of R2R printing the inks optimised for small scale devices are illustrated in Fig. 1. The image shows that although a continuous NP film forms across the stripe, the majority of the ink is deposited in a dark central region due to dewetting at the stripe edges.

This result is perhaps unsurprising given the significant differences in electrode materials and architecture used in the R2R printed devices (Ag grid/PH1000 PEDOT:PSS) compared to the small scale devices (ITO/HTL Solar PEDOT:PSS). Consequently, the intrinsic surfactant concentration was systematically increased (from DF7 to DF1) in order to determine the optimal ink formulation for R2R printing. These inks were coated by a single-stripe coating head (Fig. 2A) onto a Ag grid/PEDOT:PSS electrode to compare their film forming properties. Fig. 2B shows optical images of the coated ASNP films, and based on these images DF5 was identified as the optimal ink formulation with little to no defects in the film. Films prepared with DF7 have a clear thickness variation across the printed stripe, with a thicker line just off-set from the centre. DF6 films do not appear to have a similar thicker area; however, they do have two lines of thinner material running along the edges of the printed films. No such defects are observed for the film printed with DF5.

The table refers to the corresponding OPV parameters (PCE, VOC, FF and JSC). 
Having found the optimal ink formulation, fully R2R printed and coated OPVs were fabricated using a conventional OPV architecture (PET/Ag grid/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/ZnO/Sputtered Al) as described previously.27 The optimised ink was slot-die coated onto PH1000 electrodes using a R2R slot-die coater with 16 stripes, with the ink forming high quality films as shown in Fig. 2C. Fig. 2D plots the J–V curves of the produced non-encapsulated and encapsulated NP-OPV devices. The encapsulated NP-OPV devices show a low performance with a PCE, FF, VOC and JSC of 0.02%, 0.36, 0.430 V and 0.14 mA cm−2, respectively. This result is consistent with previous observations of the poor performance of small-scale NP-OPV devices fabricated from high surfactant concentration ASNP inks.21 As such, it is clear that while increasing the free surfactant concentration in the ASNP ink improves film formation, it is also highly detrimental to device performance and hence an alternative approach is required.
3.2 Enhancing ASNP inks film formation via ozone treatment
It is clear that improving the performance of NP-OPV devices requires using ASNP inks with a higher dilution factor than DF5. However, reducing the free surfactant concentration results in insufficient wetting and poor film formation. An alternative approach to modifying the interfacial surface energy is to use ozone-based surface treatments to change the surface chemistry of the substrate, with the ozone most commonly generated using corona discharge30 and UV radiation.31 The use of ozone to enable wetting of aqueous based inks is an established technique in organic electronics and printing; generating hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on organic surfaces that aid wetting of aqueous based layers.32 However, to date, there has been no systematic study of the effect of ozone treatment upon organic photovoltaic interfacial layers.
In order to optimise the film formation of ASNP inks with low free surfactant concentration, a systematic study of the effects of UV-ozone treatment on HTLs using small scale spin-coated devices was undertaken. Three types of PEDOT:PSS HTL were used with and without ozone to understand the impact of the surface treatment on the ASNP film quality. In particular, the effects of ozone treatment on the topography and work-function of PEDOT:PSS films were measured. Subsequently, the contact angles and topography of the ASNP films deposited onto the PEDOT:PSS HTLs and the device performance of the prepared NP-OPV devices were characterised.

3.2.1 Influence of ozone treatment on PEDOT:PSS films surfaces. 
The three common types of PEDOT:PSS material investigated for application in NP-OPV devices were: (a) Al4083, which is commonly applied for OPV as a standard low conductivity HTL, (b) Clevios HTL solar (medium conductivity type), and (c) PH1000 (high conductivity), typically used for R2R printing. AFM and PESA measurements were used to characterise the topography and work function, respectively, for Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 films with varying ozone treatment length (0–30 min). Fig. 3 shows that the ozone surface treatment has little effect on film topography except for treatments of 20 minutes or more on Al4083, whereupon small (≤100 nm) aggregates are observed to form.
 Fig. 3  Atomic force microscopy images of Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 PEDOT:PSS films treated with UVO for between 0 and 30 minutes. 

Fig. 4(A–C) shows the work function of Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 as a function of UVO treatment time. The work function of the treated Al4083 changes markedly from between 15 and 20 minutes of exposure; increasing from 5.42 eV to 5.77 eV after 30 min of UVO treatment. By contrast, there is an immediate change in the work function of HTL Solar (5.22 eV to 5.41 eV) and PH1000 (5.20 eV to 5.43 eV) upon 5 min of ozone treatment. Subsequent treatment time introduces a smaller systematic change, resulting in work functions of 5.55 eV and 5.51 eV after 30 min of ozone treatment for HTL Solar and PH1000 respectively. Fig. 4(D–F) presents the contact angles of ASNP HDF inks on Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 films spin-coated onto ITO-glass substrates as a function of ozone treatment time. The contact angle of the ASNP drop reaches an asymptotic limit over a period of 5–10 seconds. For the pristine Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000, contact angles of 16°, 18° and 29° are observed. In all three cases, ozone treatment reduces these contact angles to values of 3°, 12° and 12° respectively, with the most dramatic change in contact angle following the initial 5 min of treatment time.
 Fig. 4  PESA measurements (A, B and C) of PEDOT:PSS Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000, respectively, treated with UVO for 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes. Measured contact angle as a function of time (D, E and F) for ASNP inks coated on Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 surfaces, respectively, treated with UVO for 0, 5, 10 15, 20 and 30 minutes. 
A key difference in the three HTL formulations is the manufactured PEDOT:PSS ratio, which is 1:6, 1:2.5 and 1:2.5 for the Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 respectively (Table 1). This decrease in PSS fraction is responsible for the increase in conductivity from Al4083 to HTL Solar. As such, the additional increase in conductivity from HTL Solar to PH1000 (which have identical PEDOT:PSS ratios) must arise from the solvent additives present in PH1000.33 It is clear that the work function and contact angle measurements are probing different aspects of the surface chemistry as it relates to the PEDOT:PSS formulation. In particular, the work function variation correlates strongly with the PSS fraction, for both the untreated and treated HTL surfaces. By contrast, the contact angle of the pristine HTL layers is more strongly affected by the presence of solvent additives in the formulation, with the PH1000 surface showing a distinctly higher value than that of the Al4083 and HTL Solar surfaces. As such, solvent additives in PH1000 do not strongly influence the measured work function, but do alter the surface energy. Ozone treatment of the three HTL layers results in a strong correlation between the contact angle value and PSS fraction indicating that the effect of the additives has been reduced and the PSS fraction now dominates the surface chemistry. Our thoughts on the mechanism is that the additives in PH1000 causes a different phase separation between the hydrophobic PEDOT and the more hydrophilic PSS than is observed for HTL Solar, the phase separation in PH1000 results in a higher concentration of PEDOT in the first couple of nm at the interface between PH1000 and air.

3.2.2 Topography of ASNP films. 

Fig. 5 shows the AFM images of the ASNP films deposited on ozone treated Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 surfaces. The topography of the ASNP films prepared on pristine Al4083 had large pinholes and surface asperities. Interestingly, after a short (5 min) ozone treatment, the topography of the overlying ASNP films changed significantly to a smooth and uniform surface. This change is also evident as a reduction of the surface roughness of the ASNP films, namely a change from ∼9.5 nm for a pristine Al4083 film to ∼4.2 nm for those with ozone treatment times up to 10 min. For longer ozone treatments, the ASNP film surface exhibited a small further reduction in its roughness to ∼3.4–3.8 nm. By comparison, ASNP films deposited on pristine HTL Solar and PH1000 layers show little change in morphology and surface roughness after 5 min of ozone treatment. However, longer treatments result in increasing surface roughness and the formation of larger aggregates. Optical microscopy of the films (Fig. S1†) confirm that inhomogeneous films form when the ozone treatment persists for longer than 5 min. It is evident that both ozone treatment time and PEDOT:PSS formulation have a significant impact on the surface structure of the prepared ASNP films. The difference in topography of the ASNP films after more than 5 min UVO treatment of the PEDOT:PSS layer between ASNP layer deposited on Al4083 and HTL Solar and PH1000 is ascribed to the ratio differences between PEDOT and PSS as seen in Table 1, leading to the belief that poor wetting of ASNP inks on HTL Solar and PH1000 after 10 min of UVO is caused by UVO interactions with PEDOT.

3.2.3 XPS analysis of PEDOT:PSS before and after ozone treatment. 
The work function and contact angle measurements indicate that there are significant changes in surface chemistry that occur upon ozone treatment. To further investigate these changes, XPS analysis was undertaken on a subset of the untreated and treated HTL films. In particular, treatment times that delivered the largest change in surface properties without substantially altering surface morphology were chosen. As such, XPS spectra were collected for pristine Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 films, as well as films that were ozone treated for 10, 5 and 5 min, respectively.
As shown in the survey spectra for each PEDOT:PSS film (Fig. S2†), the principle peaks observed arise due to the presence of carbon, sodium, oxygen and sulphur. High resolution scans (Fig. S3†) were collected to determine the relative atomic concentrations of these elements, as shown in Fig. 6A. It is evident that the concentration of carbon, sodium and sulphur at the film surface decreases upon ozone treatment for all PEDOT:PSS formulations, whereas the oxygen content increases. This observation is consistent with previous report of formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl species at polymer surfaces upon ozone treatment.32 In this study, we believe the likely species to be carboxylic groups based on fitting of the carbon peak shown in Table S2.† Where an increase from 0.1 to 4.0% is observed in the concentration of carboxylic groups of the total carbon content, whereas the contribution from the peak at 286.5 eV decreases from 23.8 to 18.6%. Within this peak, the signal from hydroxyl groups can be found together with carbon–sulphur and ether bonds, complicating the confirmation of whether or not hydroxyl groups form during ozone treatment.

(B) Percentage atomic concentrations of PEDOT, PSS, sulphite and DMSO components of the AL4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 layers with no ozone treatment, and following optimal ozone treatment. 
The relative atomic concentrations corresponding to sulphur bonding environments in PEDOT and PSS were determined by peak fitting the S2p high resolution spectra according to the models established by Greczynski et al. and Duvail et al.34,35 (Fig. 6B). Table 2 compares the PEDOT:PSS ratios extracted from the peak fitting both before and after ozone treatment with the nominal formulation ratio. It is clear that the measured PEDOT:PSS ratios for the untreated films are in excellent agreement (compositional variance of less than 5%) with the expected formulation ratio. Upon ozone treatment, the ratio of PSS to PEDOT approximately doubles for the Al4083 film whereas for the HTL Solar and PH1000 films it increases only slightly. The XPS data clearly shows that the change in surface chemistry associated with ozone treatment of the HTL films is dominated by the PSS surface concentration increasing.

3.2.4 Performance NP-OPV devices. 
The preceding AFM, work function, contact angle and XPS studies indicate that optimal film formation on ozone treated PEDOT:PSS films occurs for treatment times of 10, 5 and 5 minutes for Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 respectively. In particular, these treatment lengths define the optimal trade-off between maximising the surface chemistry change (required to facilitate wetting), and minimising disruptions to surface morphology (needed to ensure uniform film formation). However, in order to establish that these optimal conditions correlate with optimal device performance, a comprehensive study of NP-OPV devices employing a device architecture of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/ASNP layer/Ca/Al as a function of ozone treatment time and PEDOT:PSS formulation was undertaken.
The devices incorporating the three HTL materials (Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000) were fabricated with the PEDOT:PSS subjected to various ozone treatment times (0–15 min). To ensure a good comparison between different HTL layers with various conductivities, all J–V measurements were conducted on masked devices to avoid the charge leakage issues that occur with high conductivity HTL layers. The results are shown in Fig. 7, where A–C is the J–V curves of the hero-device for each PEDOT:PSS at different UVO treatments (0 min (pristine), 5 min, 10 min and 15 min (Al4083 only)). In D–G, the trend of PCE, FF, JSC and VOC for the different PEDOT:PSS as a function of UVO treatments have been presented. The OPV parameters are summarized in Table 3. The results evidently show that without UVO treatment, the NP devices prepared with all PEDOT:PSS layers exhibit a lower performance. Upon a short (5 min) ozone treatment, the Al4083 device showed a strong enhancement of average PCE with 3.74 times higher than the pristine devices while the PH1000 and HTL Solar devices enhanced 2.07 and 1.19 times, respectively. Increasing the UVO treatment length to 10 min caused a decrease in performance for both PH1000 and HTL Solar devices whereas Al4083 devices continued to increase up to 5 times the performance of pristine device. However, upon longer treatment times a drop in performance was observed. The observed device optimizations as a function of UVO treatment length is ascribed to improvements in the wetting properties as the optimal UVO length aligns perfectly with the wetting angle results found in Fig. 4(D–F). Given that the optimal UV ozone treatment for each type of PEDOT:PSS have different work functions, it is not likely that the work function is the dominant parameter that influences the power conversion efficiency. Indeed, there does not appear to be any correlation between work function and the power conversion efficiency as shown in Fig. 8A.

 Fig. 8  The PCE (A) and VOC (B) of the NP devices versus the work-function of the three PEDOT:PSS's treated with UVO for various amounts of time: 0 min (black dash), 5 min (red dash), 10 min (blue solid), and 15 min (green dash line). (C) The VOCversus ln(ISC) of these devices. 
The open-circuit voltage is determined by the quasi-Fermi level difference of the holes and electrons, and has a strong dependence on the difference between the HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor, EDA:36  where e is the charge of an electron, kB Boltzmann's constant, T temperature and I0 a device property.
It has been reported that, in some cases, the VOC scales with the work function of the electrodes.37VOC is therefore a good parameter to test if the work function has a significant effect on device performance. If the work function of the PEDOT:PSS layer would have a significant effect on the performance, the VOC would be directly proportional to the work function of PEDOT:PSS. However, no such relationship is seen in Fig. 8B.
On the other hand, VOC is seen (Fig. 8C) to scale roughly linearly with ln(ISC), which shows that the trend in VOC is simply determined by the generated current in the devices as opposed to changes in the work function. Hence, the current–voltage characteristics provide further evidence that the surface properties are the dominant cause of changes in the performance.

3.3 R2R processing of ASNP inks
The preceding discussion has highlighted that for small lab devices it is possible to overcome the poor wetting properties of high dilution factor (low free-SDS concentration) ASNP inks on different HTL layers through the use of tailored surface ozone treatments. In the case of R2R printed films, ozone surface treatment is achieved through corona discharge, the conditions for which were initially optimised by coating medium dilution factor ANSP inks using a single stripe slot-die head onto PH1000 electrodes treated with corona intensities from 0 to 100 W m−2 min−1. Across each stripe, the corona intensity was abruptly changed in intervals within the possible intensity range (0, 20, 60, 100 W m−2 min−1) and the ASNP printed surface between each electrode treated region was imaged. In this way, differences in surface quality between the ASNP printed regions could be more readily discerned. The top panel of Fig. 9A shows a series of these printed stripes for corona intensity of 0, 20, 60 and 100 W m−2 min−1. Visual inspection of the single stripe printed films revealed that the ozone treatments improve the quality of the ASNP films for corona intensities up to 100 W m−2 min−1. While a low amount of ozone rectifies wetting issues across the film, higher amounts of ozone treatment appear to be a necessity to achieve homogeneous ink deposition along the stripe.

(B) J–V curves of large scale NP-OPVs fabricated using PH1000 electrodes treated with various ozone treatments (20, 60 and 100 W m−2 min−1). Table: photovoltaic characteristics of large-scale NP-OPV devices fabricated using PH1000 electrodes with various ozone treatments. 
NP-OPV devices were prepared from PH1000 electrodes with different level of ozone-treatment (20, 60 and 100 W m−2 min−1). PH1000 was chosen as PEDOT:PSS electrode over the addition of Al4083 and HTL Solar as HTL layer due to previous conducted studies showing that device efficiencies dropped after the addition of Al4083 and HTL Solar as interface layer (Fig. S6†). The J–V curves are shown in Fig. 9B with the detailed photovoltaic characteristics summarized in the included table. The devices treated with 20 W m−2 min−1 corona achieved an average VOC of 0.045 V, a JSC of 0.51 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.22%, resulting in a PCE of 0.01%. By contrast, treating the PH1000 electrode with 100 W m−2 min−1 produced devices with an average VOC of 0.43 V, a JSC of 2.03 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.35%; resulting in a PCE of 0.31%.
These results confirm the conclusions of the small device studies, showing that NP-OPV devices can be R2R printed from low surfactant concentration ASNP inks without the use of additional additives, in contrast to previous reports.24 The studies presented here reveal that ozone surface modification of the HTL electrode is key to enhancing the wetting properties of the printed ASNP inks and thereby the performance for NP-OPV devices fabricated from water-based solar inks.
4. Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated a pathway for printing large area OPV devices on a R2R scale from ASNP inks. The development of this pathway was facilitated through small scale optimizations of surface ozone treatments of three HTL electrode films. The ozone treatments resulted in significant improvement of the wetting properties of ASNP inks on all three formulations of PEDOT:PSS, which in turn allowed for deposition of smoother ASNP films and the fabrication of OPV devices with significantly improved efficiencies. In particular, the PCEs were improved from 0.23% up to 1.36%, from 0.96% up to 1.14%, and from 0.44% up to 0.91% for Al4083, HTL Solar and PH1000 devices, respectively. This ozone surface treatment approach was extended to R2R scale ozone treatment of PH1000 electrodes; enabling the deposition of ASNP inks with lower free-SDS concentrations and producing R2R printed NP-OPV devices with PCEs of up to 0.45%. This work demonstrates a pathway for R2R processing of ASNP inks into ITO-free flexible organic photovoltaics.
