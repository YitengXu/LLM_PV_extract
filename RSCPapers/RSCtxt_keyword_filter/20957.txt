    , Accepted 23rd March 2018First published on 26th March 2018AbstractIn order to investigate the inherent differences between spirofluorenes, two typical spirocycle models, spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) and spirobiflourene (SBF), were chosen to construct four spiro-terfluorenes (DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF) to investigate the effect of spirocycle substitution on photophysical and stimulated emission properties. The terfluorenes have similar absorption and photoluminescence properties. While the DOSFX-SBF film displays the best ASE properties with a threshold of 1.81 μJ cm−2, the lasing threshold of the 1-D DFB laser based on DOSFX-SBF is lowered to 0.85 μJ cm−2. These results indicate that the type of spirofluorene has a dramatic influence on stimulated emission properties and spiro terfluorenes have potential applications in organic lasers.
Introduction
Over recent years organic π-conjugated materials have shown great potential in applications such as photonic and electronic devices including light-emitting diodes,1–3 photovoltaic cells,4–6 and lasers.7–10 These materials are also employed as the optical gain media in organic solid-state lasers with the advantages of simple fabrication via low-cost processing and easy integration.11–13 In addition, a high degree of emission-wavelength tunability could be obtained by controlling the molecular structure.14 The wide spectrum tunability and large stimulated emission cross-sections make organic lasers attractive for applications in sensing, optical data communication and on-chip spectroscopy.12,15–19
The gain medium as an important component of lasers restricts laser development, especially in the field of organic lasers. Numerous materials display a low lasing threshold by optical pumping,20–22 but the development of electrical pumping organic lasers is still an urgent problem which may be solved with the breakthrough of organic gain media. Thus, a clearer understanding of the structure–property relationship of organic gain materials is needed, and the substituent effect is one of the popular research topics. The photophysics, packing motif and density, refractive index, charge transport and film morphology can be tuned by changing the side and conjugated chains.23–28 The current research mainly focuses on the electronic structures and effective conjugation length of conjugated backbones. The Huang, Ribierre, and Adachi groups have investigated the effect of the number of fluorene monomers on the stimulated emission properties, and found that the longer the conjugated backbone the lower the laser threshold.20,28–30 Through the regulation of substituents on acceptor materials of solar cells, asymmetric alkyl-substituted indacenodithiophene derivatives gave a high power conversion efficiency of 10.12%.31 Moreover, various devices with better performance were fabricated in organic field-effect transistors based on the optimization of alkyl chains.32–35 Less attention has been paid to the lateral substitution effect in gain media in organic lasers. Gain media based on different substitution groups demonstrated great differences in ASE.36–40 Therefore, the substituent effect can provide guidance for the synthesis of novel optoelectric materials. Spirocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are a promising building block for emitting materials and charge separation and transporting materials in organic semiconductors.41–44 Spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] (SFX) is a family of building blocks that can be synthesized via a low-cost one pot protocol with regard to spirobiflourene (SBF).45–49 Herein, in order to discover the inherent differences between spirofluorenes and the spiro-substitution effect on the ASE and lasing performance, four deep blue-emitting spiro-substituted terfluorenes were designed and synthesized. In these compounds, (DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF, see Fig. 1), the difference in the ASE and optical gain shows an obvious structure–property relationship, and the good DFB lasing performance of the compound with SBF as the core was demonstrated. The results provide an idea of the rational design of low-threshold organic gain media.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and crystal structures
As shown in Fig. 1, four different spiro-terfluorenes, DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF, were designed and synthesized to investigate the effect of spiro skeletons and linked modes on the photophysical properties, ASE and lasing behaviours. During this process, octoxy groups were introduced into SFX (OSFX), which were used to improve solubility and make the compounds capable of solution processing. The synthetic routes of the spiro-terfluorenes are listed in Fig. S1 (ESI†), and spirofluorene mono-/bibronic acid ester were coupled with 3′,6′-bis(octyloxy)spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] mono-/dibromide with a high yield of over 75% via a Suzuki reaction. The chemical structure of the spiro-terfluorenes was confirmed via1H and 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy. After many attempts, we obtained the single crystals of DOSFX-SBF and DSBF-OSFX from dichloromethane–ethanol and chloroform–ethanol solutions, respectively, while for the two others this failed. The single crystals of DOSFX-SBF and DSBF-OSFX belong to monoclinic and triclinic crystal systems with a space group of C2/C and P, respectively. Surprisingly, unlike the trans–trans conformation in the reported terfluorene,50,51 DOSFX-SBF and DSBF-OSFX adopt cis–cis and cis–trans conformations, respectively, indicating that oligofluorenes have rich conformation behaviors in the aggregate state. As indicated in Fig. 1, the torsional angles between the adjacent fluorenes are 42.1° and −22.4° in DOSFX-SBF, and 144.1° and −34.2° in DSBF-OSFX, so the largely twisted conformation can block close packing between conjugated backbones, and enhance the fluorescence quantum efficiency and morphological stability of the amorphous films, which are of importance to low threshold organic lasers.
Photophysical properties

Fig. 2 shows the normalized absorption, photoluminescence (PL) and ASE spectra of four oligomer films. Due to the similar conjugated backbones, the absorption spectra of DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF exhibit uniform maxima values at 357 nm, with a different maximum absorption coefficient (αmax) of 0.82 × 105 cm−1, 1.33 × 105 cm−1, 0.81 × 105 cm−1 and 0.99 × 105 cm−1, respectively (Table 1). Except for DOSFX-SBF, the other spiro-terfluorenes display well-structured emission profiles, and the maximum emission peaks are at about 425 nm (0–1 vibronic transition). The maximum emission of DOSFX-SBF peaks at 418 nm with a shoulder peak at 440 nm. The photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) values are 62% for DSFX-OSFX, 44% for DSBF-OSFX, 58% for DOSFX-SFX and 66% for DOSFX-SBF (Table 1), which are among the higher PLQE values for blue emission oligomers. The average lifetime values are 0.54 ns for DSFX-OSFX, 0.47 ns for DSBF-OSFX, 0.61 ns for DOSFX-SFX and 0.57 ns for DOSFX-SBF, indicating a short PL decay time for all of the materials (see Table 1 and Fig. S11, ESI†).

Amplified spontaneous emission properties
In order to obtain the optimal ASE performance of spiro-terfluorenes, the thickness of the spin-coating film was optimized and the optimal films were 84 ± 4 nm, which were assigned to the ASE measurement. The ASE spectrum peaked at 425 nm for the DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX and DOSFX-SFX film, whilst it shifted slightly at 426 nm for the DOSFX-SBF film, corresponding to a 0–1 vibronic transition of the films (Fig. 2). The full width at half maximum (FWHM, left axis) of the output spectrum and the emitted light intensity from the waveguide edge (right axis) as a function of pump energy density of the film for each material are shown in Fig. 3. All the compounds show that ASE occurs when the FWHM drops from >40 nm to 4–5 nm combined with a sharp increase in the output intensity when the pump energy density is enhanced to a certain level. This is the result of spontaneously emitted photons that are exponentially amplified by stimulated emission in the film waveguide. We can observe the ASE threshold with the value of 6.06 μJ cm−2 (133.3 nJ per pulse) and 3.72 μJ cm−2 (81.8 nJ per pulse) from the DSFX-OSFX and DSBF-OSFX waveguide. The value of the ASE threshold is 1.92 μJ cm−2 (42.2 nJ per pulse) for the DOSFX-SFX film and the best one is DOSFX-SBF with a value of 1.81 μJ cm−2 (39.8 nJ per pulse). By comparing DOSFX-SFX and DSFX-OSFX with DSBF-OSFX and DOSFX-SBF, it is clear that the SBF group is better than the SFX group as the substituent group in terms of improving the ASE performance. In addition, the mono-substitution of SBF and SFX also has a lower ASE threshold than the di-substitution in terfluorenes. The ASE photostability of these compounds was measured at a pump density of 3 × IASEth under an ambient atmosphere (see Fig. S17, ESI†). The photostability lifetime (tASE1/2) was defined as the time that the ASE intensity decayed to half of its initial value. The tASE1/2 values are 6.6 × 103, 4 × 103, 1.1 × 104 and 1.3 × 104 pump pulses for the DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF films, respectively, indicating that DOSFX-SBF has the highest photostability.

The gain characteristics of the films are shown in Fig. 4. Using the variable stripe length method, the net gain value of different pump energies was achieved. The maximum net gain coefficients (gmax) of 57 cm−1 and 73 cm−1 for DSFX-OSFX and DSBF-OSFX and the maximum net gain coefficients of 84 cm−1 and 91 cm−1 for DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF were obtained (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Again, the SBF-substituted terfluorenes have a higher gmax than the corresponding SFX-substituted films. We also measured the loss coefficients of the waveguide. Fig. 4(b) shows that the output intensity of the edge emission changes with the length of the unpumped region (stripe position). As indicated in Fig. 4 and Table 1, the spiro-terfluorenes have low loss coefficients (α) of 8.9 cm−1, 8.6 cm−1, 8.4 cm−1 and 8.2 cm−1 for the DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF film waveguide, respectively.

(b) The dependence of the emission intensity on the distance between the edge of the pump stripe and the edge of the waveguide for the DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF films. 
According to the PLQE and τ values, we calculated a radiative decay rate (Kr = PLQE/τ) constant of 1.14, 0.94, 0.95 and 1.16 ns−1 for DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF (see Table 1), respectively. The larger Kr leads to a lower ASE threshold and a higher ASE gain,52,53 which results in the best ASE threshold and gain of DOSFX-SBF in these compounds. The Kr demonstrates the intrinsic nature of the medium and its influence on the ASE properties, but the film quality also plays a significant role in ASE and lasing measurement. As indicated in Fig. S12 (ESI†), DSFX-OSFX exhibits poor film-forming ability with a root mean square roughness of 1.54 nm that increases the optical loss of the film. Thus, larger optical loss weakens the light amplification that causes the poor ASE performance of the DSFX-OSFX film. Furthermore, the molecular orientation of the thin film might be different and that will affect the ASE threshold.54 The factors influencing ASE performance need further investigation.
The above results for the threshold and gain and loss coefficients indicate that although both SBF and SFX have a similar rigid perpendicular configuration, they display dramatic differences in stimulated emission properties, which is mainly due to the asymmetric structure of the SFX group, and the vibration of the xanthene moiety will promote energy losses and the non-radiative constant under a high-energy laser, therefore SBF is a better candidate for lasing media. In addition, the linked modes of the spiro moieties also have a dramatic influence on the photophysical properties. As a consequence, the chemical structure of the gain media for organic lasers needs to be carefully tailored and optimized.
Lasing properties
Due to the low ASE threshold and loss coefficient, and excellent gain property of DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF, the lasing characteristics of 1-D DFB lasers were measured at a range of film thicknesses to investigate their potential applications in organic solid-state lasers. The grating period (Λ) was fixed at 290 nm (50% fill factor). Fig. 5 shows the laser output as a function of the pump energy density. Above the threshold, we observed a linear increase in the laser output with pump energy density. The 1-D DFB laser of the DOSFX-SFX film exhibits a threshold value of 2.67 μJ cm−2 (6.6 nJ per pulse) at a wavelength of 419.3 nm with 90 nm for the film thickness (see Fig. S18, ESI†). The lowest laser threshold value of 2.1 nJ per pulse, corresponding to 0.85 μJ cm−2 at a wavelength of 419.2 nm with a FWHM less than 0.3 nm, was obtained for the 1-D DFB laser of a 62 nm thick DOSFX-SBF film. Consequently, we further confirmed that SBF-substituted terfluorene has a lower lasing threshold than SFX-substituted terfluorene. Fig. S19 (ESI†) shows the laser emission spectra at various wavelengths observed with a pump energy density well above the threshold. The different laser output wavelengths were obtained with various film thicknesses of the gain material. We achieved a laser output in the range of 419–441 nm (a spectral window of 22 nm) for DOSFX-SFX via changing the film thickness of the gain medium layer from 55 to 110 nm, while the range of 420–430 nm (a spectral window of 10 nm) was obtained for DOSFX-SBF at a film thickness of 45–80 nm. In addition, soluble and rigid OSFX may be a promising spirofluorene moiety for organic semiconductors.

Conclusions
In summary, we have reported a detailed investigation of the photophysical and ASE properties of four spiro-substituted terfluorenes (DSFX-OSFX, DSBF-OSFX, DOSFX-SFX and DOSFX-SBF). Among them, SBF-containing spiro-terfluorenes have a higher gain coefficient and lower ASE threshold than the corresponding SFX analogs. As a result, DOSFX-SBF demonstrated the best performance with values of 1.81 μJ cm−2 for the ASE threshold and 91 cm−1 for the net gain coefficient, and the 1-D DFB laser exhibited the lowest threshold of 0.81 μJ cm−2 with a wavelength tuning range of ∼10 nm in the blue spectral region, which is promising for a low threshold organic blue emission solid-state laser. Our results suggest that SBF is a superior backbone to SFX and a clearly thought out molecular design has been demonstrated. 
Experimental
The synthesis of spiro-terfluorene derivatives is shown in detail in the ESI.† The films with 50–150 nm thicknesses were fabricated by spin-coating from toluene solutions onto pre-cleaned Spectosil B substrates. A Shimadzu UV-3150 and RF-5300PC spectrometer were used to perform UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy, respectively. The fluorescence lifetime was measured using an Edinburgh FLSP920 fluorescence spectrophotometer with a 379 nm laser (typical pulse width: 55 ps; pulse repetition frequencies: 20 MHz); the PLQE was measured using an integration sphere with a xenon lamp as the excitation light source. The Asylum Research MFP-3D AFM in AC mode with an NSC115/AIBS Si cantilever (resonant frequency ∼325 kHz from μ-macsh) was employed to measure the surface morphology and RMS roughness of the films.
For the ASE study, the samples were optically pumped at 355 nm (matching the maximum absorption wavelength) with a Q-switched, neodymium ion doped yttrium aluminium garnate [Nd3+:YAG] laser (Continum Surelite II-10) pumped type-II β-BaB204[BBO] optical parametric oscillator (Panther EX) that delivered 5 ns pulses at a repetition rate of 10 Hz. The pump beam was focused with a cylindrical lens to create a narrow stripe of 4 mm × 550 μm on the sample surface in the perpendicular direction. The DFB laser was optically pumped with the same source and a spherical lens was applied to generate an elliptical spot with a minor axis of 280 μm and an area of 2.46 × 10−3 cm2. The DFB laser was fabricated by spin coating a film of three polymers on top of pre-etched silica one-dimensional gratings, respectively. The grating had a 290 nm period and 50% fill factor (i.e. parallel 145 nm width etched stripes each separated by 145 nm). Output signals were collected with a fiber-coupled grating spectrometer (Andor Co.) equipped with a charge coupled device (CCD) detector (Newton Co.). The gain measurements of the waveguides were completed with the variable stripe method. In loss experiments, the fixed length of the pump stripe (2 mm) was gradually moved away from the sample edge, then the emission intensity from the edge of the sample was measured as a function of the unpumped region.55,56
