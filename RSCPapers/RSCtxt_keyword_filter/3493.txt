    , Accepted 23rd March 2021First published on 6th April 2021AbstractInverted device architectures in perovskite research were promising for faster commercialization given the simple processing routes and choice of hole transport materials such as PEDOT:PSS. However, the crystallization of perovskite on the PEDOT:PSS surface led to large domains with several grain boundaries and defects, especially when multi cation systems are involved. Defects formed on the surface of the perovskite are significant reasons for non-radiative recombination, which then limits the performance of the device. Surface passivation of the perovskites through the introduction of large cations was shown as a viable option to minimize the defects and promote better charge carrier extraction. In this regard, recent research was mostly limited to planar architectures and on perovskites prepared on mesoporous TiO2 films. In this work, we report the deposition of guanidinium iodide (GUAI) on the triple cation FAMAC perovskite prepared on a PEDOT:PSS surface in an inverted architecture as a means to induce passivation and suppress non-radiative recombination. We examine the effects of adding different concentrations of GUAI dissolved in isopropyl alcohol as a post-treatment process on triple cation perovskites. The passivation effect led to an increase in open-circuit voltages from 0.89 V to over 0.96 V, which resulted in high efficiency of 16.03% for a GUAI loaded device compared to 12.92% for the control device. The stability was also found to be improved for GUAI passivated devices compared to a control device when tested over 600 hours of storage in ambient conditions.
1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted a lot of attention since they first came out in 2009.1 Owing to some unique properties such as strong absorption,2 tunable bandgap,3 excellent charge carrier mobility, long diffusion lengths,4 and small exciton binding energies,5 PSCs saw significant development. A record high 25.5% power conversion efficiency (PCE) was reported to date,6 comparable to what is achieved by most conventional solar industry technologies. Further increase in the efficiencies is expected through improvements in open-circuit voltages (VOC) and fill-factor (FF) since the short-circuit density (JSC) has almost reached its limit with a recent record ∼28 mA cm−2 reported.7
The VOC of the devices is regarded as a strong function of defects in bulk or on the perovskite's surface.8–11 Perovskite materials are considered highly polycrystalline and have a structural disorder associated with grain boundary and crystallographic defects.12 The commonly reported composition – CH3NH3PbI3 or MAPbI3, where MA is methylammonium, has reached efficiency bottlenecks, and stability cannot be improved further.13 Triple cation perovskites have received more attention due to the stabilized black phase (from Cs addition) and lattice structure, leading to the highest efficiency of record.13 MAPbI3 is known to have shallow trap states on the surface, which could be potential recombination centers and contribute to voltage losses.14,15 A multi-cation system with dual,16,17 and triple cations18 along with MA would also lead to several defects on the surface due to the competing nature of crystallization. The solution processing methodology, a commonly used fabrication route in research on PSCs, is known to induce several defects on the surface.19,20 The solution route gives rise to dangling bonds and unreacted PbI2 on the surface for any given composition, which need to be passivated. Several groups have addressed this through the introduction of halide compounds such as diammonium iodide,21 quaternary ammonium halides,19 potassium halide,22 and iodopentafluorobenzene.23 Other passivation methods include deliberately inducing the PbI2 phase into the perovskite for a type-I band alignment and suppressing charge carrier recombination.24,25 Several groups investigated grain boundary passivation through excess Pb in the precursors to promote stability and efficiency.26–31 The introduction of large cation groups such as phenyl ethyl ammonium iodide (PEAI)16 into the perovskite resulted in excellent improvements to the device's efficiency and stability through passivation mechanisms. However, fewer reports investigated the effect of introducing large cations into triple cation perovskite compositions – Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)Pb(I0.83Br0.17)32 and double cation compositions – (FAPbI3)0.85(CH3NH3PbI3)0.15 (ref. 17) and FA0.8Cs0.2PbI2.7Br0.3 (ref. 33). Guanidinium iodide (GUAI) is another type of large cation group that has been recently investigated as an ‘A’ site cation.34–36 GUAI was also recently reported as a post-treatment in perovskite devices.37,38 While these studies have improved single and dual cation perovskites' performance and stability, further investigation is needed for post-treatment procedures of triple cation perovskite compositions prepared in inverted architectures.
A planar-inverted architecture is known to have lower processing temperature and more straightforward fabrication routes, making them faster to commercialization than mesoporous architecture,39–41 especially for flexible solar cells. Of the various hole transport layer (HTL) materials used in an inverted configuration, polyethylene dioxythiophene:poly (styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) has been widely used due to good processability, high mechanical flexibility, good thermal stability, adequate transparency, and energy levels42–49 and also extend their applicability to inverted device architectures. Crystallization of perovskites on a PEDOT:PSS surface is quite different from that of other materials, with Reza et al. demonstrating that post-treated PEDOT:PSS improved the contact angle hence grain sizes of MAPbI3.50 Triple cation perovskite in an inverted configuration with PEDOT:PSS and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester as the electron transport layer (ETL) has been explored. Ji et al., primarily to prevent degradation of Sn-based perovskites by salt doped HTL such as Spiro-OMeTAD.51 In this regard, there is a need to explore the crystallization and morphology of triple and dual cation perovskites on a PEDOT:PSS surface. Research on triple cation perovskites in an inverted configuration is also necessary to facilitate simpler processing and fast commercialization, especially for future flexible solar cells.
In this work, we explore the effect of post-treatment of triple cation perovskites with guanidinium iodide (GUAI). We study the structural and optical properties of adding different concentrations of GUAI on a triple cation perovskite prepared on a PEDOT:PSS surface. Further, the device performances in an inverted configuration with PEDOT:PSS and PCBM as the HTL and ETL, respectively, were investigated. We find that the post-treatment with GUAI yields better morphology and demonstrates improved VOC's from 0.89 V for a control sample to 0.96 V for GUAI loaded sample and a subsequent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.03%. We propose a passivation effect that plays in suppressing recombination and the reason behind the improved VOC.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Precursor solutions
GUAI (99.99%), methylammonium bromide, MABr (99.99%), formamidinium iodide, FAI (99.99%) were purchased from GreatCell Solar. Lead iodide, PbI2 (99%), lead bromide, PbBr2 (99.99%), and cesium iodide (CsI) were purchased from TCI America. All the chemicals were used as received without any further processing. PbI2 and PbBr2 were prepared to 1.5 M as a stock solution in a 4:1 v/v mixture of dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). The solutions were heated to 180 °C for 10 min to facilitate dissolution. Both these solutions were used within a week of preparation. CsI solution was prepared to 1.5 M in DMSO and heated to 150 °C for 10 min and cooled to room temperature before use. FAI and MABr were dissolved in PbI2 and PbBr2 solutions, respectively, to a concentration of 1.2 M to prepare FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3. These were mixed in the ratio 5:1 of FAPbI3 and MAPbBr3 to form the FAMA precursor solution. CsI (5% vol.) was then added to the FAMA perovskite to obtain the FAMACs triple cation perovskite. GUAI was dissolved to different concentrations of 1 mg ml−1, 2 mg ml−1, and 3 mg ml−1 in isopropyl alcohol (IPA) with stirring for a few min. PEDOT:PSS (purchased from Xi'an polymer light corporation) filtered through a 0.45 μm filter was used as the hole transport layer. Phenyl-C61-butyric-acid methyl ester (PCBM) (purchased from Sigma Aldrich) was dissolved in chlorobenzene (20 mg ml−1) for use as the electron transport layer.
2.2 Device fabrication
For the device fabrication, a 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 patterned indium doped tin oxide on glass (ITO/glass) was used as the substrate. These substrates were thoroughly cleaned in soap water, followed by ultrasonication in deionized water, acetone, and IPA for 10 min each. They were further treated to UV-ozone for 12 min to remove organic contaminants. Substrates were then transferred to a nitrogen filled glovebox for device fabrication. PEDOT:PSS was spin-coated for 30 s at 4000 rpm, followed by annealing at 130 °C. This was followed by the perovskite deposition with anhydrous ethyl acetate, EA (Sigma), as the antisolvent through a one-step method. 120 μL of perovskite was dropped on the substrate and spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 35 s. 10 s from the start, 300 μL of EA was dropped within 3 s, resulting in dark brown color. Substrates were then annealed at 100 °C for 1 hour. Different GUAI solutions were then spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s to give G1, G2, and G3 for 1 mg ml−1, 2 mg ml−1, and 3 mg ml−1, respectively, with G0 assigned as the control sample. This step was followed by spin coating PCBM at 1000 rpm for 30 s with no post-annealing. Finally, 80 nm of Al was deposited by thermal evaporation using a shadow mask. The final device area was measured to be 0.2 cm2.
2.3 Characterization details
The prepared samples were characterized using different techniques to understand various properties further. X-ray diffraction was performed using a diffractometer with Cu-Kα radiation with a corresponding beam current of 45 mA and anode tension of 45 kV. A scanning electron microscope (SEM XL-30 Environmental FEG) was used to study the morphology and film formation. Absorbance spectra were recorded using Cary 5000 UV-vis spectrometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurements were carried out on the perovskite samples using a Reinshaw InVia spectroscopy with an ×100 objective lens and 460 nm excitation wavelength. The samples were excited from the front side for all PL measurements. The lifetime of minority carriers was estimated using a Picosecond Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) spectrofluorometer. Decay was monitored at 765 nm when the samples were excited at 460 nm using a white light laser (Fianium) with 6 ps pulses. The films were prepared on glass without the presence of any charge transporting layer. The excitation density was approximated to be 1 μJ cm−2. Current–voltage measurements (J–V) of the devices were carried under simulated AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) radiation using a xenon lamp (Spectra-Physics, Oriel Instruments, USA).
3. Results and discussion

Fig. 1a shows the schematic of the passivation effect of adding GUAI on triple cation perovskite. The XRD spectra of the samples were collected with different GUAI loading conditions for investigating new phases and the relative intensity of the perovskite and PbI2 peaks. Fig. 1b shows the XRD spectra with the theoretical composition FA0.85MA0.10Cs0.05Pb(I0.7Br0.3)3, prepared on a PEDOT/ITO/glass substrate. The observed peaks at 14.10°, 19.8°, 24.4°, 28.1°, 31.55°, and 34.67° correspond to (110), (012), (003), (220) and (123) planes, respectively of the triple cation perovskite.52,53 The peak at 12.67° (also indicated by the dashed red line) corresponds to PbI2.54 Many groups investigated PEAI as a surface modifier, and additional diffraction peaks were not observed compared to control samples.16,33 The spectra from Fig. 1a also indicate a similar trend with GUAI potentially residing in the grain boundaries and on the surface. No additional 2D phases were noticeable from the XRD spectra, while the perovskite intensity was found to be similar across all the samples. The choice of triple cation perovskite in our case could have led to unreacted PbI2 forming on the surface, which explains the origin of the peak at 12.6° in the control sample. We observe that the intensity of the PbI2 peak around 12.6° almost disappears with GUAI loading. Given the large GUA cation size, the incorporation into the perovskite itself can be impeded as per previous reports.55 No discernible peaks were observed, indicating the formation of GUAPbI3 at 8.5° or GUA2PbI4 at 6.7°. The broad peaks can be attributed to the amorphous nature of the substrate. Since GUAI was added as a capping layer without any post treatment on the perovskite, the nature of this layer would be predominantly in the form of GUAI salt. These results suggest that GUAI acted as a passivating agent in suppressing the excess PbI2 on the surface and does not necessarily react. No apparent shift in the peak position or change in intensity of the perovskite indicates that GUA is not incorporated into the lattice resulting in GUA–FAMACs composition. The XRD spectra of triple cation perovskite on only ITO/glass are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†) to validate the morphology's reproducibility further. We find that the general intensity of the perovskite prepared on ITO decreased a little compared to that of PEDOT/ITO/glass, and a similar trend was observed with the PbI2 peak at 12.6° decreases with increasing GUAI loading. The surface modification of adding GUAI will be further explored in the next section.

SEM analysis was conducted to observe the morphology from the post-treatment of the perovskite with GUAI. The images with different loading conditions of GUAI, prepared on PEDOT/ITO/glass, are shown in Fig. 2. All the samples which have the triple cation composition exhibit a uniform morphology with little to no pin-holes and similar grain sizes. The surface appears to be modified for GUAI based samples compared to the control sample. Several bright spots (indicated by yellow circles) that appear in the control sample are most likely unreacted PbI2 crystals and have been minimized with increasing GUAI loading. Further, a more compact morphology with smoother surfaces and almost no bright spots was observed for G3, the highest concentration. A passivation effect is likely induced due to GUAI depositing at grain boundaries, as evidenced in the XRD spectra. However, unlike the passivation induced by adding GUA to precursor through the formation of 1D δ-FAPbI3 and 2D FAGAPbI4,32 in this case, it is from post-treatment of the perovskite with GUAI. Higher concentrations of GUAI would yield thicker layers on top of the perovskite, thereby increasing passivation, although this effect is not apparent in the morphology images. Charge transport across the passivated perovskite layers would be significant and will be discussed in the next sections. The SEM was also carried on samples prepared on an ITO/glass surface and shown in Fig. S2.† We find that the triple cation perovskite crystallizes as a large number of grains on the PEDOT:PSS with slightly smaller sizes than on PEDOT/ITO/glass, as also evidenced by the XRD spectra. Nonetheless, this also leads to the appearance of bright spots that were found to be minimized and disappear with increasing GUAI concentration in post-treatment. A smoother morphology that is pin-hole free and homogenous across the surface was realized post GUAI treatment for all concentrations. This morphology is essential in forming a good interface with PCBM to minimize shunt pathways and losses during operation.

The optical properties can be explained by the UV-vis absorption and steady-state photoluminescence (PL) results in Fig. 3 and 4. A slight reduction in absorbance is observed for the G3 sample, which has a higher concentration of GUAI (3 mg ml−1). Other than this, the absorbance is similar for all the samples relative to the control sample without GUAI. No notable difference in the absorption spectrum also indicates no change in the bandgap of the perovskite. The steady-state PL spectra suggest that the PL intensity improves for all loading conditions of GUA, which is a sign of suppressed non-radiative recombination. Further, a lack of a significant shift confirms the UV-vis absorption results regarding the bandgap. The suppressed recombination due to a surface treatment using a large cation salt is similar to the results observed by Jiang et al.16 However, higher loading of GUAI does not seem beneficial with the PL intensity dropping for G3 (3 mg ml−1). Although additional peaks of a specific 2D phase are not observed in XRD results, higher concentrations of GUAI likely induce a weak form of 1D phase on the surface, which could be playing a role in suppressing non-radiative recombination.

Time-resolved PL studies were carried out on the samples with different GUA loading for observing the minority carrier lifetimes, and the corresponding decay curves are shown in Fig. 5. The films were prepared on glass without any charge transporting layer. The excitation density was approximated to be 1 μJ cm−2. The data was plotted on a log-scale and a bi-exponential decay function defined by I(t) = A1e1−(t/τ1) + A2e2−(t/τ2) was used to fit the parameters and shown in Table 1. The fast decay component, τ1, represents defects from non-radiative recombination, while the slow component, τ2, relates to radiative recombination.56–58τPL which can be defined as the average lifetime, was determined by the equation, τPL = α1τ1 + α2τ2, where α1 = A1/(A1 + A2) and α2 = A2/(A1 + A2). We find that the average lifetime, τPL, which considers both the components, increases for all GUA loading conditions compared to the control perovskite. Specifically, the value increases from 89.90 ns for a control sample to 119.76 ns for G1. Similar values were observed for G2, but the lifetime of carriers in G3 goes down relative to G1 and G2. The increase in lifetime values can be attributed to the passivating affect of GUAI through suppression of recombination mechanisms. The lower lifetime for G3 (3 mg ml−1) can be explained due to the higher concentration of GUAI, relative to G1 and G2, thereby inhibiting charge transport. The nature of charge transport as related to the device performance is discussed in the following section.

Current–voltage characteristics were performed on devices prepared in an inverted configuration with PEDOT:PSS and PCBM as the hole and electron transport layers, respectively, and shown in Fig. 6 with the corresponding device parameters in Table 2. While the control device demonstrated a PCE of 12.92%, G1 and G2 demonstrated 16.03% and 14.15%, respectively. Ji et al. demonstrated a PCE of 9.69% for a forward scan in a triple cation perovskite device with PEDOT:PSS and PCBM as the HTL and ETL, respectively. They found that adding an optimized Sn as a partial replacement to Pb would more suitably align the band levels and give a higher PCE. In our case, the VOC was improved for GUAI loaded samples, which is the reason behind the boost in PCE. The primary reason behind the improved VOC can be attributed to the surface passivation of defects on the perovskite. JSC was observed to decrease for GUA-based devices compared to control with G1 and G2, showing 21.98 mA cm−2 and 19.14 mA cm−2, respectively, compared to 22.28 mA cm−2 for G0. Previous reports indicated GUAI capping leads to a shift in the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band maximum (CBM),37 which affects the charge transport across the interface. Additionally, GUAPbI3 has a wide bandgap,55 and its formation at any level affects the perovskite/PCBM interface, leading to lower JSC values. G3 device is noted to have significantly lower JSC values, likely due to a strong combined effect of the shift in the positions of CBM and the insulating nature of GUAI, leading to a PCE of only 9.74%.

The reproducibility of the effect of adding GUAI is investigated in the box plots of PCE in Fig. 7, which are the results of 8 devices fabricated with the same conditions. The corresponding plots of VOC, JSC, and FF are shown in ESI Fig. S3–S5,† respectively. We observe a similar trend in the values as the main data in the box plots with small distributions indicating good reproducibility.

We assessed the stability of the devices prepared with different loading conditions and plotted the normalized device parameters of them tested over 600 hours in Fig. 8. The samples were stored in darkness at 25 °C and 25% RH between measurements. We find that both G1 and G2 devices demonstrate superior stability in PCE and only degraded by approximately 20%, compared to the control device, which decomposed by more than 40%, as shown in Fig. S3, † however, degrades a little more (35%) relative to G1 and G2 but still proves to be more stable than the control device. Other device parameters are shown in Fig. S6–S8.† We find that the JSC values follow a similar trend in degradation and FF, but the VOC is shown to be retained over extended periods instead of decay of nearly 90% for the control device. The higher stability can be attributed to the passivation effect induced by the addition of GUAI on the perovskite.

4. Conclusion
To summarize, we demonstrated the effect of adding different concentrations of GUAI in IPA to triple cation perovskite and explored the change in different properties. In this regard, three different concentrations of GUAI on perovskite were investigated. Although a higher crystallization was not observed, a passivation effect is understood to be induced on the surface, especially on unreacted PbI2. Analysis of the steady-state PL spectra shows improved intensity and lifetime on all GUAI loaded samples compared to the control sample. The fitted parameters for the lifetime values indicate suppressed carrier recombination, and an overall reduced defect density for the GUAI loaded samples. Device performance was then evaluated with respect to the control sample, and both 1 mg ml−1 (G1) and 2 mg ml−1 (G2) demonstrate superior performance with improved VOC's resulting in 16.03% and 14.15% PCE. JSC was found to be low at higher concentrations, likely due to the insulating nature of GUAI, minimizing charge transport across the interface between the perovskite and charge transport layers. Further studies on stability evaluated over a period of 600 hours demonstrate retaining of VOC for GUA based devices with only a loss of 20% PCE observed, compared to the control device.
