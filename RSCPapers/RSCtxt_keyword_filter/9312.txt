    , Accepted 1st September 2017First published on 1st September 2017AbstractPush–pull conjugated polymers have shown high performance in organic photovoltaic devices and yet, there have been fewer studies of the fundamental structure–property relationship in this class of materials compared to prototypical conjugated homopolymers MEH-PPV and P3HT. Here we report a single molecule study of a push–pull polymer poly[N-(1-octylnonyl)-2,7-carbazole]-alt-5,5-[4′,7′-di(thien-2-yl)-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole] (PCDTBT) to understand the origin of the substantial band gap narrowing and the sensitivity of peak position to chain length even for long polymer chains. In bulk solution, the peak of the emission spectrum was observed to shift from a higher energy emission state to a lower energy state above a critical molecular weight. This same trend was observed at the single molecule level where there were two clear emission species. At low MW the single molecules showed emission predominately from the higher energy state. Above the critical molecular weight, the single molecules changed and showed emission from the low energy species. At the transition MW, a mixture was observed with molecules emitting from one or the other of the two species. The transition from the high energy to low energy state at a particular molecular weight is likely the result of substantial intermolecular self-interactions between chain segments that leads to excitation delocalization. This is made possible at even higher molecular weight and lengths where there are more energy transfer pathways for the already long polymer chains.
Introduction
There has been an emerging interest in push–pull polymers (also known as donor–acceptor copolymers) as the donor polymeric material for applications in polymer solar cells ever since the pioneering work of the bithiophene-acceptor based materials1 and the introduction of 2,7-carbazole-based push–pull polymers.2,3 Push–pull polymers consist of alternating electron-rich and electron-deficient moieties. This architecture drastically reduces the energy gaps of donor polymers and thus allows for efficient harvesting of solar radiation and improved photovoltaic performance.4–8 The narrow energy gap is a result of molecular orbital mixing of the neighboring donor and the acceptor moieties, which ultimately raises the level of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowers that of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). In addition, the individual HOMO and LUMO levels and the resulting HOMO–LUMO gap of the push–pull polymers can be readily tuned by choice of donor or acceptor. The ability to tune the HOMO–LUMO gap is important as it determines the minimum optical absorption energy the material requires and its efficiency of harvesting solar radiation. As with other donor materials, the molecular structure of push–pull polymers plays an important role in their photophysics and ultimately device performance.9–12 However, compared to prototypical homopolymers based on polythiophenes and poly(phenylene vinylene)s, there has been fewer systematic studies of the fundamental photophysics of push–pull polymers.
It is vital to gain a better understanding of the structure–property relationship of these polymers to facilitate the enhancement of their performance. The push–pull polymer monomers have significantly more atoms compared to the monomer repeat unit of typical conjugated polymers homopolymers. The complex nature of the repeat unit of the material makes it largely disordered and noncrystalline. Due to the complexity of the bulk film and the intricate and intertwined structural factors between polymer chains, it is beneficial to interrogate these polymers at the single molecule level. Single chains are inherently less heterogeneous than the bulk film and this isolation allows us to examine the connections between the intrinsic single polymer chain conformation and its photophysical property. There have been every few single molecule studies of donor–acceptor co-polymers. A recent exception is the single molecule study of poly[[4,8-bis[(2-ethylhexyl)oxy]benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl][3-fluoro-2-[(2-ethylhexy)carbonyl]thieno[3,4-b]thiophenediyl]] (PTB7).13 This study demonstrated that the large red-shift in the absorption in this material is not present at the single molecule level but instead arises only from intermolecular interactions upon aggregation13 as other studies14 had suggested. Such experiments demonstrate the need for further single molecule characterization of this class of materials.
Poly[N-(1-octylnonyl)-2,7-carbazole]-alt-5,5-[4′,7′-di(thien-2-yl)-2′,1′,3′-benzothiadiazole] (PCDTBT) was first synthesized by Leclerc and colleagues.3 Its structure is shown in Fig. 1. It has shown high device performance with a power conversion efficiency exceeding 6% and a lifetime of seven years.2,15–17 There have been great interests in understanding the charge-transfer character of PCDTBT with solvatochromism studies and ultrafast spectroscopy in the bulk system. However, there has not been any systematic study on the effect of polymer chain length on its molecular structure and associated photophysics.18–22 Its spectral range makes PCDTBT an interesting functional material for single molecule studies compared with other push–pull polymer systems that can only be accessed in the near-infrared region.

In this report, we will examine the photophysics of PCDTBT as a function of chain length in chloroform solution as well as at a single chain level. More specifically, we will explain the origin of the redshift in spectra with increasing PCDTBT molecular weight.
Experimental
Materials
PCDTBT polymers (64 kDa, PDI = 2.4) were purchased from 1-Material Inc. The polymers were further fractionated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), (GPCmax VE-2001, Viscotek) to achieve desired molecular weights (Mn) and a polydispersity (PDI) less than 1.5. Tetrahydrofuran (THF, Acros Organics) was used as the mobile phase. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Mn = 45 kDa, PDI = 2.2) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Extra dry chloroform solvent was purchased from Acros Organics. Glass coverslips were cleaned in an acid piranha solution (1:3 v/v hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid) and thoroughly rinsed with nanopure water (resistivity = 18.2 MΩ cm) before use.
Solution optical characterization
The fractionated PCDTBT samples in THF were dried with N2 and redissolved in extra chloroform for solution optical characterizations. The UV-vis absorption was recorded with a monobeam UV spectrophotometer (Agilent Technologies Inc.). For fluorescence measurement, all solutions had absorbance <0.1 at peak wavelength of the low energy band to minimize self-absorption among the polymers. Fluorescence spectra were acquired with a Fluorolog-3 (Jobin-Yvon) spectrofluorometer.
Single molecule excitation polarization spectroscopy
Single molecule samples were prepared by spin-casting an ultra-dilute solution of polymer out of 2 wt% PMMA/chloroform to achieve a sample density of ∼80 molecules per illumination area of 40 × 40 μm2. Fluorescence excitation polarization spectroscopy was performed on a wide-field optical microscope (Zeiss Axiovert) with a 1.25 NA objective lens (Zeiss, Achrostigmat, 100×, oil immersion) operating at the 488 nm line of an Ar ion laser (Melles Griot, model 35-IMA-040-208). The illumination intensity was ∼1.5 W cm−2. The excitation beam was modulated through a combination of an electro-optical modulator (Fastpulse Technology, model 3079-4) and a quarter waveplate (Tower Optical Corporation) to achieve a rotating linearly polarized beam. The fluorescence signal was collected through the same objective, filtered with a 496 nm edge filter and a notch filter. The fluorescence images were recorded on an EMCCD detector (Andor, model iXon+ DU-897E). By fitting the emission intensity of each single molecule, I, as a function of the rotating angle, θI(θ) ∝ 1 + Mcos2(θ − ϕ)where ϕ is the angle of the maximum emission. The modulation depth, M, can be extracted where M is a projection of the molecular absorption tensor onto the sample plane. The value of M reflects the morphological order of polymer chains. Polymers with values of M close to one adopt an ordered conformation while polymers with M values close to zero suggest an isotropic conformation. A distribution of M values for each polymer is plotted and shown in histograms. Here only the fluorescence excitation modulation is measured rather than a more extensive 2-D measure of excitation and emission.23,24 Some molecules exhibited fluorescence intermittency or blinking. For each molecule eight modulation cycles were synchronously averaged to yield single modulation traces. A small fraction of molecules (∼5%) exhibited fluorescence intermittency or blinking. These molecules were included in the analysis as long as the blinking occurred in no more than three out of the eight cycles.
Single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy
The experiment was performed on the same optical microscope under a confocal mode where the laser beam was focused to a diffraction-limited spot on the sample plane. Fluorescence emission spectra were acquired with an excitation power of ∼30 W cm−2. The emitted light was filtered with a 496 nm blocking edge long-pass filter (Semrock) and delivered to a spectrograph (Princeton Instruments Acton SP-150) that was coupled to a liquid N2-cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments). A single molecule spectrum was obtained by averaging 3 consecutive spectra collected with an integration time of 15 s each.
Results and discussion
Comparative steady state absorption and fluorescence emission measurements
Here, a series of PCDTBT with a range of molecular weights from 8 kDa to 107 kDa (Mn, n = 7–142) are investigated and their absorption spectra in chloroform are shown in Fig. 2A. PCDTBT polymers are known to show a high energy band (HEB) at 380–400 nm originating from the absorption of carbazole with adjacent thiophene rings and a broad low energy band (LEB) from benzothiadiazole at 530–580 nm.20 A substantial redshift of ∼123 meV in the LEB is observed with an increase of molecular weight. This shift to lower energy continues slightly (∼19 meV) as the molecular weight increases further with the energy staying constant above 50 kDa. The HEB shows a similar trend where a redshift of ∼114 meV occurs as the MW increases at the lower end of the range. The HEB no longer shifts to lower energy once the MW reaches 24 kDa (Fig. 2B).
 Fig. 2  (A) Steady state absorption spectra of a series of dilute PCDTBT polymers in chloroform (<0.1 mg mL−1) normalized to the peak of the LEB (B) peak energy shifts of the HEB and LEB in corresponding to a change in molecular weight of the polymers. 
The fluorescence emission spectrum, consists of only one broad peak at ∼700 nm. (Fig. 3) The shape and spectral position of the fluorescence emission spectrum does not depend on the excitation wavelength due to an energy transfer from the HEB of the N-(1-octylnonyl)-2,7-di(thien-2-yl)carbazole (BTC) unit to the LEB with a charge transfer character formed by BTC and its adjacent benzothiadiazole.20 Interestingly, a similar molecular weight dependence on the peak emission wavelength is observed in the fluorescence emission spectrum. As is seen in Fig. 3B, there is again a substantial redshift (∼66 meV) from the lowest molecular weight up to 24 kDa. However, unlike the absorption spectra, the two lowest molecular weights are nearly identical and there is a discrete jump to a new emission wavelength above 24 kDa (Fig. 3B).

One possible explanation for the observed redshift is an increase in the conjugation length of the polymer as the molecular weight is increased. The energy shifts up to a molecular weight of 24 kDa. This polymer size corresponds to approximately 33 monomer repeat units. This would be a dramatically large conjugation length especially given the size of the monomer unit. The monomer size of a PCDTBT alone is much larger than prototypical homopolymers such as poly(phenylene–vinylene)s (∼3 times) and polythiophenes (∼9 times). This is equivalent to ∼99 repeat units for MEH-PPV, whose conjugation lengths are believed to only be ∼8 repeat units. It is unlikely conjugation can sustain such long distance as structural factors such as curvatures and kinks in the polymer chain would disrupt conjugation. From a molecular dynamics study, PCDTBT in solution tends to have a wide range of dihedral angles, suggesting planar structures are not thermodynamically favored.25 The broad and featureless absorption peaks in Fig. 2A are a result of the conformational disorders of the segments on the polymer backbone. It is unlikely that there is an ultra-long conjugation length of PCDTBT in solution. Additionally, an increase in conjugation length is typically accompanied by a continuous shift, not a sudden jump as is observed in the emission spectra.
If the substantial redshift is not due to an increase in conjugation length that simply results from having more monomer units, it must have another origin. It could arise from a change in the physical conformation of the polymer above a particular molecular weight. Below this molecular weight the polymers adopt an array of conformations many of which have higher energy absorptions. However, as the molecular weight increases, the polymer chain can fold to interact with itself between chain segments. This conformational change could lead to one of two possibilities where either would result in the observed redshift, or smaller energy gap of the material. Either it is the overlapping of the π orbitals across chain segments that leads to a longer conjugation length. Or the excitations are more delocalized across the polymer units leading to a lower energy transition.
Single molecule correlated structure–property relationship study
Solution measurements indicate a potential existence of various structures for the polymer chains. In order to study the local conformation of individual polymer chains and their effects on photophysical properties, we employed single molecule spectroscopy. We first characterized the anisotropy of the structures the single polymer chain adopted using the excitation polarization technique described in “Experimental”. By examining a sample set of >300 individual PCDTBTs for each molecular weight, a modulation depth distribution histogram of each different molecular weight polymer is obtained. The closer M is to 0, the more isotropic the conformation of the polymer is. On the contrary, a higher M value close to 1 indicates a highly ordered or anisotropic conformation. The average M for each molecular weight of PCDTBT is less than 0.45 (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is significantly lower than those of typical homopolymers such as MEH-PPV and rr-P3HT.26–30 Yet, a slowly rising population with higher M can be seen evolving with a decrease in molecular weight. A direct comparison of M distributions between the lowest and highest molecular weight polymer examined (8 kDa and 107 kDa) is illustrated in Fig. 4, where a rising population with higher M values (more anisotropic structures) is clearly seen in the case of the shorter polymer.

The overall low conformational order of PCDTBT single polymer chains, indicated by the average M < 0.45, could result from the twisted backbone conformation in the ground state.31 The increased degrees of freedom in the polymer as an increase in chain length further lowers the structural order within a polymer chain, which is analogous to aggregated chains of MEH-PPV.32 This suggests that the length of polymer backbone of PCDTBT indeed plays a role in individual polymer conformation.
The conformation characterization is followed by a scrutiny of individual polymer chain spectrum in order to identify the impacts polymer chain conformations have on their photophysical properties. An ensemble of single molecule fluorescence emission spectra of four molecular weights are compiled and shown in Fig. 5. The spectrum of 8 kDa peaks at ∼635 nm whereas the peak position of the 16 kDa and other higher MW polymers occur at ∼690 nm. In addition, there is a decrease in the high-energy shoulder (∼635 nm) of the higher MW polymer spectra. We believe the two transitions observed (at ∼635 nm and ∼690 nm) are due to the existence of two emitting species of PCDTBT in the solid state. In order to verify our speculation, we plotted the energy distributions of the individual single molecule spectra. Because most of the single molecule spectra do not contain pronounced vibronic structures, the energy of the origin of the transition (E0–0) cannot be unambiguously assigned. Therefore, we plotted the energy at half height of Emax on the blue edge of the spectrum as a proxy for the origin energy (Fig. 6A). It shows that the 8 kDa polymers are made up from most of the high-energy species and that the 107 kDa polymers are comprised of mainly the low-energy species (Fig. 6B). The 16 kDa polymer has a broad bi-modal distribution of both low and high energies. Several conjugated polymers are known to show a conformational transformation from a phase consisting of disordered non-interacting chains to a phase that is dominant by interacting chains. These have been shown extensively in low temperature solution studies with homopolymers as well as another push–pull polymer poly{4,4-dialkyl-4H-cyclopenta[2,1-b;3,4-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl-alt-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl} (PCPDTBT).33–36 We propose that our observed high-energy species originate from the non-interacting segments on the PCDTBT polymer chain. At these molecular weights, the polymer chain is mostly extended and is less likely to be interacting with itself. On the other hand, the more isotropic low-energy species has interacting segments once the size of the polymer has reached 30 monomer units. While the persistence length of PCDTBT has not been reported experimentally, we suspect it to be on the order of ∼5–10 monomer units (well less than 30) based on the abrupt redshift observed in both solution and single molecule spectra. A recent theoretical calculation, however, suggested a persistence length of PCDTBT merely equivalent to 0.6 monomer unit.37 We believe this might be an underestimation as such short persistence lengths would lead to the polymers having significantly more isotropic structures at all of the molecular weights probed. Our polarization data, on the other hand, has shown a clear molecular weight dependence on the polarization of the polymers. The more disordered high molecular weight polymer chain is not likely to support excitation delocalization along the chain without breaking the conjugation, but it is possible to induce interactions within itself with such conformation. This interaction either creates a few segments with π orbitals overlapped across (i.e., longer conjugation length) or allows for further excitation delocalization among the donor–acceptor constituents across the chains.

Since most of the spectra lack normal vibronic progressions, we were interested to see whether there is a correlation between those show clear vibronic progressions and one of the species observed. A similar plot to Fig. 6B is generated for those spectra with vibronic structures shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). Those polymer chains appear to be mainly responsible for the higher energy ends of the species. The more pronounced vibronic features of these polymer chains can be attributed to a lack of interactions between polymer chain segments in the high-energy species.
Conclusion
With a combination of steady state absorption and fluorescence emission spectroscopy and single molecule spectroscopy, two distinctive PCDTBT species were found to exist at room temperature at the lower and the higher molecular weight regime, respectively. A similar “two species” phenomenon has been previously observed in homopolymers such as MEH-PPV. However for these materials the differences have only been detected at low temperatures (<77 K). Low temperature studies have also revealed two types of emitting species in another push–pull polymer PCPDTBT. In the current system of PCDTBT, the difference in the high energy and the low energy emitters is clear even at room temperature. Moreover, there is a distinct correlation between the type of emitting species and the molecular weight of the polymer. In the ensemble this appears as a shift in the peak absorption and emission wavelength. The single molecule studies reveal a bi-modal distribution of peak emission wavelengths that changes with increasing molecular weight. At sizes where the polymer chains are at most a few persistence lengths, the emission is from the higher energy of the two species. Once the polymer is sufficiently long that it could start interacting with itself, beyond the critical molecular weight of ∼24 kDa (∼33 repeat units), and the emission shifts to lower energy by approximately 100 meV. The shift may result from an increase in conjugated length of the polymer. It, however, would not result directly from the polymer increasing in length but from the polymer interacting with itself. This cross-over at a critical molecular weight could be a general phenomena in push–pull polymers and suggests the importance of understanding molecular weight in probing photophysics. This presence of new states that are more delocalized could have important implications for energy and charge generation in OPV applications.

Table Content:

 	Fig. 1  Polymer structure of PCDTBT.	 
I(θ) ∝ 1 + Mcos2(θ − ϕ)

 	Fig. 2  (A) Steady state absorption spectra of a series of dilute PCDTBT polymers in chloroform (<0.1 mg mL−1) normalized to the peak of the LEB (B) peak energy shifts of the HEB and LEB in corresponding to a change in molecular weight of the polymers.	 

 	Fig. 3  (A) Fluorescence emission spectra of PCDTBT in chloroform, excitation at LEB (B) peak emission wavelengths with varying PCDTBT molecular weights.	 

 	Fig. 4  Overlaid modulation depths histograms of PCDTBT of 8 kDa and 107 kDa. A rising population in the higher M regime can be clearly seen for 8 kDa. Bin size 0.2.	 

 	Fig. 5  Ensemble single molecule spectra of PCDTBT of four molecular weights excited at 488 nm (8 kDa, 16 kDa, 32 kDa and 107 kDa). ∼80 molecules were examined for each polymer sample.	 

 	Fig. 6  (A) A single molecule spectrum of 8 kDa PCDTBT. The energy at half height of Emax on the blue edge of the spectrum is used as a proxy for the origin energy. (B) Energy distribution of E at half height Emax on the blue edge of individual single molecule spectrum.
