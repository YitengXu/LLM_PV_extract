    First published on 15th March 2011AbstractSignificant progress has been achieved in the preparation of semiconducting polymers over the past two decades, and successful commercial devices based on them are slowly beginning to enter the market. However, most of the conjugated polymers are hole transporting, or p-type, semiconductors that have seen a dramatic rise in performance over the last decade. Much less attention has been devoted to electron transporting, or n-type, materials that have lagged behind their p-type counterparts. Organic electron transporting materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p–n junctions, organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), n-channel organic field-effect transistors (OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) and complementary logic circuits. In this critical review we focus upon recent developments in several classes of electron transporting semiconducting polymers used in OLEDs, OFETs and OPVs, and survey and analyze what is currently known concerning electron transporting semiconductor architecture, electronic structure, and device performance relationships (87 references).

Introduction
In 1976, Heeger, MacDiarmid and Shirakawa discovered conducting polymers and the ability to dope these polyacetylenes over the full range from insulator to metal.1 This important discovery initiated an extensive and systematic research referring to aspects of the chemistry and physics of conjugated polymers. Conjugated polymers are composed of alternating single and double bonds between covalently bound carbon atoms, leading to one unpaired electron (the π electron) per carbon atom. In addition, the carbon orbitals in π bonding are in the sp2pz configuration and overlap along the backbone, leading to electron delocalization along the backbone of the polymer. This electronic delocalization provides the pathway for charge transport along the polymer main chain. As a result, such polymers can exhibit semiconducting or even conducting properties.2
Over the past three decades, dramatic progress has been made in the synthesis of conjugated polymers and their applications for optoelectronic device. Due to low-cost, light-weight, and flexibility advantages, optoelectronic devices based on conjugated polymers are a promising cost-effective alternative to inorganic materials-based microelectronics. Moreover, these devices can be fabricated by high-throughput processing methodologies, such as spin coating, inkjet printing, gravure and flexographic printing onto flexible substrates. Nowadays, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) and organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on conjugated polymers are slowly beginning to enter the market, driven by academic and industrial research teams.3

Conjugated polymers can be classified as hole or electron transporting (HT or ET) or ambipolar materials according to the type of orderly transferring charge carriers, under a given set of conditions, stemming from removal of electrons from the filled molecular orbitals or from the addition of electrons to empty orbitals, respectively.4 Organic HT and ET materials are different from classical inorganic p- and n-type semiconductors which are generally undoped, and so very few charge carriers are present except under an applied field. Charge carriers can be injected from electrodes or from other adjacent organic materials, or can be generated through photoexcitation. Charge transport in conjugated polymers is a series of successive electron-transfers between neutral and charged repeat units of the polymers.5 The transport speed of the holes (electrons) under an applied electric field is described by the hole (electron) mobility, μ, of the material. μ has units of velocity per unit field and normally depends on both the electric field and temperature. Ambipolar materials have similar hole and electron mobilities, and can be used as either HT or ET materials.
Significant evolution has been achieved in the preparation of HT (p-type) conjugated polymers over the past two decades; some p-type polymers show extremely high hole mobility (>1 cm2 V−1 s−1), similar to that of amorphous silicon. Much less attention has been devoted to ET (n-type) materials that have lagged behind their p-type counterparts. Organic ET materials are essential for the fabrication of organic p–n junctions, OPVs, n-channel OFETs, OLEDs and complementary logic circuits. Therefore, ET semiconductors are one of the bottlenecks in organic electronics. Most reviews on organic semiconductors mainly focused on p-type materials, some of which dealt a little with n-type materials.6–9 Several reviews have summarized synthesis of ET semiconductors and their applications in OLEDs, OFETs and OPVs.5,10–15 Most of these reviews mainly focused on n-type small molecules, but paid much less attention to n-type conjugated polymers. In this critical review we focus upon the representative ET semiconducting polymers and their applications in OLEDs, OFETs and OPVs.
Since the optimal ET material itself is device application and system specific, it is unlikely that a rigid set of guidelines can be provided for the development of a “universal” ET material that can be used in OLEDs, OPVs, and OFETs. The basic requirements for an ideal ET polymer include:
(i) Good solution processability. From the technological point of view, solution processability of ET conjugated polymers is highly important since this property facilitates the device fabrication through common solution-based printing and patterning techniques easily adaptable to large-area substrates. Generally, introduction of flexible, alkyl type side groups, which should not influence the π–π stacking, to the conjugated main chain may render the polymers soluble in common organic solvents.
(ii) Suitable HOMO/LUMO energies. The applicability of ET conjugated polymers in a given electronic device is determined by the positions of their highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels relative to the vacuum level. The energy-levels alignment at organic–metal and organic–organic interfaces is important for device performance. Ionization potential (IP) is the minimum energy required to eject an electron out of a neutral molecule in its ground state, while electron affinity (EA) is the energy released when an electron is added to the neutral molecule to form a negative ion. The IP of a molecule can be approximated as the energy of the HOMO level, while the EA as the energy of the LUMO level. However, the IP and EA are characteristics of the whole molecule, while the HOMO and LUMO refer to electron levels. To achieve acceptable performance, ET conjugated polymers must have high EA to facilitate electron injection from contacting electrodes in OFETs or OLEDs or to facilitate exciton separation in conjunction with typical HT materials for OPV applications.
(iii) High electron mobility. Strong electronic coupling between molecules, which is associated with excellent overlap between the π-systems on adjacent molecules, is an essential requirement for ensuring high mobilities. Electronic coupling was determined not only by the spatial overlap of orbitals, but also by the phase relationships between the orbitals of each molecule.16,17
(iv) Good air stability. In most cases, air instability is not due to degradation of chemically unstable neutral materials, but due to the susceptibility of the corresponding radical anions to H2O or O2 in air. This susceptibility of the charge carriers to trapping under ambient conditions can seriously suppress ET processes. To enhance ambient stability, mobile electrons in ET polymers should be kinetically or thermodynamically resistant to trapping. It has also been experimentally found that for air stable transistors the LUMO level of semiconductors should be below −4.0 eV with respect to the vacuum level.18
Electron transporting semiconducting polymers for OLEDs
Electroluminescence (EL) is the emission of light when conjugated polymers are excited by the flow of an electric current.19 In a simple OLED, an EL layer is sandwiched between two electrodes. OLEDs are double charge injection devices, requiring the simultaneous supply of both electrons and holes to the EL material. It is well known that one of the crucial requirements for efficient OLEDs is balanced charge injection from both electrodes and comparable transport ability of both holes and electrons within the emissive layer. Most luminescent conjugated polymers, such as poly(phenylenevinylene) and polyfluorene derivatives, are p-type materials, which predominantly accept and transport holes due to their relatively high HOMOs. This results in an imbalance in injection rates between electrons and holes. Hole injection predominates and charge recombination occurs near the polymer/cathode interface, leading to a poor EL efficiency due to quenching of excitons by the metal electrode. To improve EL efficiency, several methods have been developed including using a low work function metal, such as calcium, as the cathode to facilitate electron injection owing to a lower energy barrier. However, such metals are highly sensitive to air and moisture. Another promising approach is adding a separate electron injection and transport layer between the luminescent layer and the cathode or using a blend of an ET material and an emissive material. The introduction of an ET layer in p-type emitter-based OLEDs not only lowers the barrier for electron injection but also blocks holes. The essential criteria for ideal ET materials include:
(i) Suitable HOMO/LUMO levels relative to the p-type emitter, thereby minimizing the barrier for electron injection, reducing turn-on/operating voltage, and effectively blocking holes.
(ii) High electron mobility (μe) to move the charge recombination zone away from near the cathode and improve the exciton generation rate.
(iii) Good thermal stability to endure inevitable Joule heating encountered during OLED operation, especially at higher electric fields and current densities.
(iv) Good solution processability to form uniform, pinhole-free, thin films by spin casting, printing, and related techniques.
(v) High glass-transition temperatures (Tg) to obtain amorphous morphology and prevent light scattering and crystallization-induced device degradation.
In this section, we focus on representative ET polymers used to control charge injection, transport, and recombination in OLEDs. The molecular architecture, electronic structure (HOMO/LUMO), charge carrier mobility, and OLED performance of diverse ET polymers are discussed. Most ET polymers are based on electron-deficient, nitrogen-containing, aromatic heterocycles, such as derivatives of poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole), poly(pyridine), poly(quinoline), poly(quinoxaline), etc.
Poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole) derivatives

        1,3,4-Oxadiazole-containing polymers have attracted considerable attention as ET and/or hole-blocking materials due to their electron-deficient nature, high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield, and good thermal and chemical stabilities. However, like other rigid aromatic polymers, most of the earlier fully aromatic poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole)s, e.g.P1 (Fig. 1), were not soluble in any organic solvents and could only be processed using strong acids (sulfuric acid or methanesulfonic acid).20
 Fig. 1  Chemical structures of some oxadiazole-based ET polymers for OLEDs. 
To improve solubility of polyoxadiazole derivatives in organic solvents, a promising approach is introduction of flexible tetraphenylsilane or hexafluoroisopropylidene units into the main chain.21Polymer P2 (Fig. 1) was soluble in chloroform. Its reduction potential was similar to that of polymer P1. External quantum efficiency (EQE, the ratio of number of photons ejected to the number of charges injected into the devices) of 0.006% was obtained from single-layer OLEDs based on P2.21Polymer P3 (Fig. 1) was readily soluble in THF, DMF, and chlorinated hydrocarbons.22 The EQE of the single-layer OLEDs based on poly(2,5-bischolestanoxy-1,4-phenylenevinylene) (BCHA-PPV) using Al as cathode was only 0.03%, while using P3 as the ET layer, the EQE increased by a factor of 10 due to balanced electron and hole injections (Table 1). The device ITO/BCHA-PPV/P3/Al remained operative after 1 year of storage in air, without encapsulation.

Another strategy to improve solubility of polyoxadiazole derivatives is introduction of solubilizing side chains such as alkyl or alkoxy groups. Polymer P4 (Fig. 1) is the first conjugated polymer using 2-(4-biphenyl)-5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole (PBD) as a repeat unit.23Tg of P4 was 196 °C and the polymer was stable up to 370 °C. The bilayer OLEDs ITO/PEDOT/MEH-PPV/P4/Al using P4 as an ET layer showed an EQE of 0.26% and brightness of 800 cd m−2, which improved by factors of 25 and 50, respectively, relative to the single-layer OLEDs based on poly[2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-1,4-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV).
Operating lifetime is the main problem that limits the use of OLEDs. Polyoxadiazole derivatives are generally amorphous with high glass-transition temperatures. Therefore, polyoxadiazole derivatives were used as the ET layer to improve the stability of OLEDs. For example, due to the high Tg (176 °C), an OLED based on poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) prepared with P5 (Fig. 1) as the ET layer exhibited a 30-fold improvement in stability.24Polymer P6 (Fig. 1) had a Tg of 220 °C and high thermal stability with a decomposition temperature of 415 °C. A bilayer device ITO/PPV/P6/Al demonstrated a 10-fold increase in EQE (0.01%, 12.5 V, 8 mA cm−2) compared to the single-layer device based on PPV (0.001%, 8 V, 100 mA cm−2). In comparison with heterolayer OLEDs based on PBD in a polymer matrix, the device also demonstrated an improvement in stability and operating time, which was 150 h under ambient conditions without encapsulation.25
To improve electron injection and electron transport properties of luminescent polymers, oxadiazole is also incorporated as a side chain. To attain balanced charge injection and transport, to reduce the interactions within and between the backbones of fluorene-thiophene copolymers, and to tune the optical properties of the target copolymers, oxadiazole with a bulky and waist-attaching mesogen-jacketed structure was attached to the main chain as pendent groups.26 A brightness of 5558 cd m−2 and EQE of 0.224% was obtained from a single-layer, blue-emitting OLED ITO/PEDOT/P7/Ca/Al (Table 1). Shu et al. reported a fluorene-based copolymer, P8 (Fig. 1), which possesses bipolar charge transporting functionalities, through the incorporation of electron-rich triphenylamine into the polymer backbone and electron-deficient oxadiazole pendent groups onto the C9 position of fluorene.27 The propeller-shaped triphenylamine units in the main chain and the rigid cardo-type oxadiazole side chains endow P8 with a very high Tg (306 °C). OLEDs using P8 as the emitting layer exhibit a voltage-independent and stable blue emission; the maximum brightness was 7128 cd m−2 and the maximum EQE was 1.59%. In addition, doping P8 as a host material with 2.6 wt% of a red-emitting phosphorescent dye, Os(fppz), led to a maximum brightness of 28440 cd m−2 and a maximum EQE of 9.30%.
Polypyridine, polyquinoline and polyquinoxaline derivatives
Due to the π-electron deficient nature of the pyridine ring containing the electron-withdrawing imine nitrogen, polypyridines and their derivatives have reversible n-doping properties.28 Polypyridine P9 (Fig. 2) exhibited an electron affinity (EA) of 3.4 eV and an ionization potential (IP) of 6.3 eV (Table 2).29 The rigid polymer backbones and strong intermolecular interactions in P9 resulted in ready excimer formation in thin films.30 Due to efficient excimer formation, single-layer OLEDs based on polymer P9 showed very low efficiencies with blue-green EL (∼500 nm).30 However, with P9 as the ET layer and PPV as the emissive layer, the bilayer OLEDs showed a brightness of 900 cd m−2 and EQE of 0.25%; the EQE was 60 times greater than that of the single-layer PPV device.29 Poly(pyridinevinylene) P10 (Fig. 2) exhibited even higher EA (4.3 eV) and higher IP (6.7 eV) values relative to polypyridine P9;31 the EA was estimated as the difference between the IP (from UV photoelectron spectroscopy) and the optical band gap rather than from cyclic voltammetry. The single-layer OLED based on P10 exhibited yellow-orange EL (585 nm) with a maximum EQE of 0.0065%, while a bilayer device ITO/PPV/P10/Al, using P10 as the ET layer and PPV as the emissive layer, exhibited a maximum EQE of 0.08%.31 Some other soluble pyridine-containing copolymers with arylene vinylenes were also fairly emissive with increased ET properties and were used to achieve voltage-tunable EL colors.32

Polyquinoline (PQ) derivatives possess excellent thermal and oxidative stability, and their films display attractive mechanical properties. Typically, polyquinolines have a high Tg above 250 °C and initial weight loss occurring above 500 °C.33 In addition, the π-electron deficient nature of the quinoline ring endows the polyquinolines with a low LUMO.34 Therefore, the polyquinolines could be used as ET materials in OLEDs. Jenekhe et al. found that the EAs and IPs of polyquinolines can be varied by changing the co-units in the main chains.35 For examples, replacing the co-unit thiophene (P11, Fig. 2) with phenyl (P12) or biphenyl (P13) leads to a 0.2 eV increase in IP (Table 2). Provided that the alignment of the LUMO levels at the interface favors electron transfer (ΔEA < 0) for a given bilayer PPV/PQ, then the largest energy barrier to hole transfer gives the best EL performance. PPV/P13 with ΔIP of 0.38 eV exhibits the highest efficiencies (2.99%) and brightness (826 cd m−2), while PPV/P11 with the smallest ΔIP of 0.16 eV exhibits the lowest efficiencies (0.08%) and the lowest brightness (52 cd m−2) among P11–P13.
Typical polyquinolines have poor solubility in common organic solvents. A useful way to improve solution processability of polyquinolines is copolymerization of quinoline with other solubilizing building blocks. An alternating copolymer containing bis(phenylquinoline) and dialkylbithiophene units in the main chain (P14, Fig. 2) was soluble in organic solvents (chloroform, THF and toluene).36Polymer P14 had an EA of 3.4 eV and IP of 5.9 eV. The bilayer OLED using MEH-PPV as the emissive layer and P14 as the ET layer showed bright orange-red EL emission with a turn-on voltage of 8.5 V and a luminance of 2311 cd m−2 at 15 V and an EQE of 0.68%, a factor of 34 increase compared to the single-layer MEH-PPV device. The EL devices ITO/PEDOT/P14:MEH-PPV(28:72, w/w)/Al made from P14 and MEH-PPV blends showed a turn-on voltage of 6 V, a luminance of 1484 cd m−2 at 14 V and an EQE of 0.64%.36
Introduction of dialkylfluorenes into a polyquinolines backbone also improved their solubility in organic solvents.34,37–39Polymer P15 (Fig. 2) had Tg of 214 °C and good thermal stability with an initial decomposition temperature of >388 °C.37 Bilayer devices ITO/MEH-PPV/P15/Al using MEH-PPV as the emissive layer and P15 as the ET layer showed strong emission with a luminance of 167 μW cm−2 and an EQE of 0.035%, a factor of 86 and 35 increase, respectively, compared to the single-layer MEH-PPV OLEDs.38
Jenekhe et al. reported a series of poly(4-alkylquinoline-2,6-diyl)s, having 100% head-to-tail regioregularity.40 These polymers showed good solubility in common organic solvents (chloroform and THF) and reversible electrochemical reduction with an electron affinity (2.6 eV) comparable to those of P11–P13, which was independent of alkyl chain length. The regioregularity of these polymers resulted in highly ordered self-organized lamellar structures in solution-cast thin films with an interchain π-stacking distance of 3.9–4.1 Å and linear correlation of the interlayer d-spacing to the alkyl chain length, showing higher electron mobilities than the poly(phenylquinoline)s.40 When these polymers were used as the ET layer in bilayer MEH-PPV-based OLEDs, poly(4-hexylquinoline-2,6-diyl) (P16, Fig. 2) gave the highest EQE (3.0%) and the highest brightness (700 cd m−2) (Table 2).40
Compared to quinoline, quinoxaline with two imine nitrogens in the ring seems to be more suitable for ET materials in OLEDs because of its higher electron-accepting ability while retaining the excellent thermal and environmental stability of quinoline-based materials. For example, polyquinoxaline P17 (Fig. 2) has wonderful electrochemical reduction with an EA (3.24 eV) and IP (5.94 eV) higher than that of polyquinoline P16.41P17 shows excellent thermal stability (Tg > 250 °C) and solubility in organic solvents (chloroform). Using P17 as the ET layer leads to an about 2-fold enhancement in EQE of PPV-based OLEDs.42 Using P18 (Fig. 2) as an ET layer in poly(2,5-dialkoxy-p-phenylene vinylene)-based OLEDs showed a brightness of 250 cd m−2 and an EQE of 0.35%, a 10-fold increase relative to the corresponding single-layer device.43Polymer P19, which possesses an EA of 3.0 eV and IP of 5.54 eV, was used as the ET layer in PPV-based OLEDs, showing a brightness of over 700 cd m−2 and an EQE of 0.4%, a 40-fold increase compared to the single-layer diodes.44 Thus, polyquinoxaline derivatives with better electron injection and transport properties are more suitable ET materials for PPV-based OLEDs than polypyridines and some polyquinolines.

Cyano-substituted poly(p-phenylene vinylene) derivatives

Cyano-substituted poly(p-phenylene vinylene)s (CN-PPVs) have reversible reductions with typical EA values of ∼3.0 eV, which are higher than that of PPV (∼2.7 eV), leading to better electron injection/transport characteristics than PPV due to introduction of the cyano groups.45–48 CN-PPVs have a low band gap and emit red or near-infrared luminescence; the band gap can be regulated by judicious choice of the monomer units or the solubilising groups. Holmes et al. pioneered the synthesis and use of CN-PPVs in OLEDs.45 A bilayer OLED, using polymer P20 (Fig. 3) as the ET and emissive layer, PPV as the HT layer, and an air-stable Al cathode, emitted red EL with a high internal quantum efficiency (the ratio of number of photons generated to the number of charges injected into the devices) of 4% (Table 3).45 Single-layer OLEDs based on P21 (Fig. 3) have an EQE of 0.025%, which increases to 0.062% for bilayer devices using PPV as the HT layer, indicating that in P21 electron injection/transport is better than hole injection/transport.46

Zhan et al. reported a series of ET copolymers based on the phenylene cyanovinylene unit.47 These polymers exhibited low-lying LUMO and HOMO levels and blue emission. For example, a copolymer of fluorene and CN-PPV (P22, Fig. 3) has high Tg (114 °C), high EA (3.08 eV) and high IP (6.13 eV). Single-layer OLEDs based on P22 using Al as the cathode exhibit a narrow and blue emission (466 nm) with an EQE of 0.006%.
Karasz et al. reported a polymer based on the dicyanophenylene vinylene unit (P23, Fig. 3).48 Single-layer OLEDs ITO/P23/Ca emit orange EL (610 nm) with a luminance of 800 cd m−2, while a brightness of 3000 cd m−2 at 20 V was achieved with PPV as the HT layer. However, the very low Tg of P23 (44.6 °C) might lead to poor device stability.
Other miscellaneous ET conjugated polymers
Owing to higher EA values than 1,3,4-oxadiazoles, 1,3,5-triazines have thus been explored as building blocks for ET materials in OLEDs. Schmidt et al. incorporated 4,4′-hexafluoroisopropylidenebisphenol in the poly(1,3,5-triazine ether) main chain to render them soluble in organic solvents.49 Poly(1,3,5-triazine ether)s have high Tgs (186–247 °C) and high decomposition temperatures (431–486 °C). Cyclic voltammograms reveal at least a reversible electrochemical reduction with an EA higher than 2.7 eV and an IP higher than 6.0 eV, suggesting that these polymers could have good electron injecting/transporting and hole blocking properties. Using P24 (Fig. 4) as the ET layer and PPV as the emissive layer, a bilayer OLED exhibits a 50-fold increase in brightness compared to the single-layer PPV device.49 Despite the high EA of these polymers, the poor performance of these polymers as ET materials for OLEDs suggests that electron mobilities of these polymers were probably rather low.

Rodlike aromatic heterocyclic polybenzobisthiazoles and polybenzobisoxazoles exhibited excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability with Tg > 400 °C and decomposition temperatures above 600 °C in air.50 Polybenzobisthiazoles showed excellent reversible electrochemical reductions and irreversible oxidations, suggesting that they were easily n-doped.51 They possessed EA of 2.4–3.0 eV depending on the arylene linkage, which are appropriate for ET materials in OLEDs. Polymer P25 (Fig. 4) was explored as the ET layer in bilayer MEH-PPV-based electroluminescent devices.52 The ITO/PEDOT/MEH-PPV/P25/Al diode showed the best performance with a low turn-on voltage (2.8 V), high brightness (1400 cd m−2 at 5 V), and high EQE (2.5%). The bilayer device was stable under repeated testing over a period of 9–10 months storage in air. The field-effect electron mobility of a polymer P25 thin film was ∼2 × 10−7 cm2 V−1 s−1, which was on the same order of magnitude as the hole mobility in MEH-PPV (10−7–10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), indicating good prospects of balanced charge transport in ITO/PEDOT/MEH-PPV/P25/Al. The polybenzobisazoles seem to be better ET materials for PPV-based OLEDs compared to the above discussed poly(1,3,4-oxadiazole) and poly(triazine) derivatives. The superior performance of the polybenzobisazoles as ET and hole-blocking materials in OLEDs is due to their high Tg, environmental resistance, and photochemical/electrochemical stability. Replacing P25 with polybenzobisoxazole P26 (Fig. 4) in the bilayer MEH-PPV-based OLED leads to a performance decrease (Table 4).52

The benzothiadiazole ring is an electron-deficient and classical n-type building block for designing ET materials for OLEDs. Due to the electron deficient nature of the benzothiadiazole ring, poly(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl) showed reversible electrochemical reduction.53 However, its poor solubility in organic solvents limited its use in OLEDs. Incorporation of fluorescent moieties such as fluorene in the benzothiadiazole polymer main chain could greatly improve their solubility. The alternating copolymer P27 (Fig. 4) of benzothiadiazole with 9,9-dioctylfluorene has an EA of 3.2 eV and IP of 5.9 eV.54 Highly dispersive electron transport was observed in P27 with an electron mobility of the order of 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 5 × 105 V cm−1, being of the same order of magnitude as the hole mobility in poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (10−4–10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 5 × 105 V cm−1).54 Therefore, P27 could be a promising ET material for OLEDs. Bilayer OLEDs, using a fluorene-triphenylamine copolymer as the HT layer and P27 as the emissive and ET layers, showed green emission with high brightness (∼10000 cd m−2 at 0.84 mA mm−2) and a large EQE (3.86%) (Table 4), which was much higher than that reported for other polymer LEDs.55 Due to improved thermal management, even higher brightness (153000 cd m−2) was achieved in very small area (50 μm diameter) OLEDs based on the blend consisting of 95% poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) with 5% P27.56
Great progress has been achieved in the synthesis and application of ET semiconducting polymers to enhance OLED performance through improved electron injection and transport. Many different classes of ET materials have been explored. Most ET conjugated polymers contain electron-deficient aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The electronic structure (EA/IP and band gap), electron mobility, thermal and electrochemical stability are important to ET polymers for OLEDs. It is hard to identify the best ET polymers since performance of OLED depends on many factors such as device geometry, electrode choice, the p-type emissive layer, and device testing conditions. To improve the stability and durability of the devices, ET polymers for OLEDs should have high Tg, preferably higher than 150 °C. High electron mobilities (ideally >10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) are desirable for ET polymers particularly for OLEDs targeted for high brightness display and lighting applications. Therefore, one of the important research directions in OLEDs should be the development of ET polymers that combine high electron mobility, high Tg, and suitable EA/IP and band gap.14
Electron transporting conjugated polymers for OFETs
When an OFET device has a drain-source bias (Vd) applied, the current flow between source and drain electrodes (Id) can be modulated by the bias applied between gate and source electrodes (Vg). When Vg = 0 V, Id is minimal and the device is in the “off” state. When Vg ≠ 0 V is applied (Vg > 0 V for n-channel transistors) the device turns “on”, and charge carriers are accumulated at the semiconductor–dielectric interface, resulting in a gate-controlled Id. Key FET figures-of-merit include: field-effect mobility (μ), current on-to-off ratio (Ion/Ioff), threshold voltage (Vth) defining average charge carrier drift velocity, drain-source current ratio between “on” and “off” states, and the gate voltage at which the injected charge carriers are mobile.5
Most organic-based semiconductors show hole transporting (p-type) behavior in transistors. Development of high-performance (stable, high-mobility) organic ET materials for OFETs has lagged behind their p-type counterparts for various reasons: (a) ET materials in OFETs should have a low LUMO (ideally <−4 eV) suitable for electron injection from the electrode; most organic materials are beyond this scope; (b) n-type semiconductors generally contain polar groups reducing their solution processability; (c) n-channel transistors are generally susceptible to oxygen or water when operating in ambient conditions, which can destabilize or trap electrons in the channel. However, in order to fabricate organic complementary logic circuits, developing reliable organic n-channel transistors is necessary to integrate with p-channel transistors. In recent years, the interest to build complementary circuits has stimulated intensive research into n-channel and also ambipolar transistors. Very limited progress has been made in developing polymer n-type FET relative to their small molecule counterparts.4,5,10–12,15 The essential criteria for ideal ET polymers used in OFETs include: (i) low LUMO levels; (ii) highly ordered structure; (iii) high electron mobility; (iv) good air stability; (v) high purity and good solution processability.
In this section, we focus on representative ET polymers used to control electron injection and transport in n-channel and ambipolar OFETs. The molecular architecture, LUMO level, and electron mobility of some ET polymers are discussed. Most ET polymers are based on electron-deficient, nitrogen-containing, fused heterocycles, such as rylene diimide polymers.
Poly(benzobisimidazobenzophenanthroline) (BBL, P28, Fig. 5), a ladder-type polymer solubilized via complexation or protonation, was the first n-channel FET-active polymer with high mobility.57 Due to the very strong intermolecular π–π stacking of the rigid ladder polymer main chain, P28 possesses high Tg (>500 °C). P28 exhibits reversible n-type doping with a high electron affinity of 4.0 eV. OFETs based on P28 fabricated from methanesulfonic acid showed an electron mobility (μe) of 0.03 cm2 V−1 s−1 and current on-off ratio (Ion/Ioff) of 5 × 105 after annealing at 105 °C (Table 5). Electron diffraction suggested that P28 thin films prepared from methanesulfonic acid were semicrystalline.57 Recently, anisotropic one dimensional belt-like nanostructures from P28, showing a very high aspect ratio, have been reported.58 In these nanobelts, the polymer chains are oriented parallel to the long axis of each nanobelt, which stemmed from extraordinary strong intermolecular π–π interactions in the polymer chains with the very rigid and planar molecular backbone. An n-channel transistor based on a single nanobelt showed an μe of 7 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, Ion/Ioff of ∼1 × 104 and a threshold voltage (Vth) of 11.2 V. A mobility of 4 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1, an on/off current ratio of ∼1 × 104 and a threshold voltage of 11.9 V were obtained for n-channel transistors from a network of P28 nanobelts. The nanobelt network transistors are the most stable n-channel polymer transistors to date, showing good stability and repeatability in air for more than 6 months, arising from the favorable electronic and molecular structure of the polymer as well as the morphology of the oriented polymer chains.58 However, the drawback of BBL is its poor solubility in common organic solvents, films have to be fabricated from hazardous methanesulfonic acid.

Aromatic imide-based materials are a robust, versatile class of polycyclic aromatic ET materials and possess excellent thermal and oxidative stability, high electron affinities, and, in many cases, high electron mobilities.5,59 In recent years, a few high performance n-type polymers based on aromatic imides have been reported. Zhan et al. pioneered the synthesis of soluble, fully conjugated polymers based on aromatic imides.60 A fully conjugated alternating copolymer (P29, Fig. 5) of perylene diimide (PDI) and dithienothiophene (DTT), in which the PDI cores are π-conjugated bridged by DTT units, rather than polymers in which PDI are connected through the imide groups, exhibited good solution processability, excellent thermal stability, and high electron affinity (3.9 eV).60 Introduction of fused thiophenes into the polymer main chain favors the chain planarity and promotes highly ordered π-stacked structures. Bottom-gate OFETs based on P29 showed a saturation electron mobility of 1.3 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a low threshold voltage of 4 V in nitrogen.60 Very recently, top-gate OFETs, fabricated by lamination using polyacrylonitrile (PAN)/polystyrene (PS) as the dielectric layer, exhibited an μe of 6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1, Ion/Ioff of 104 and Vth of 7 V in air (Table 5).61 The mobility of top-gate devices can maintain at 0.03–0.05 cm2 V−1 s−1 for 2–7 days and typical device characteristics can still be observed even after three months in air, with a mobility of 0.005 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on/off ratio of 104. These results clearly demonstrated the superior stability of top-gate OFETs based on P29. A PDI-dithienopyrrole (DTP) copolymer (P30, Fig. 5) exhibited an electron mobility of 7.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 under an inert atmosphere; annealing at 100 °C led to a higher μe (1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1).62 The lower mobility observed for P30 may be related to dilution of the PDI ET units by the additional N-substituents of the DTP donors or to the disruption of PDI–PDI interactions caused by these groups. Later, Facchetti et al. reported a PDI-bithiophene copolymer (P31, Fig. 5).63P31 has a similar structure to P29, but exhibits a lower electron mobility (2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1) in a similar device geometry, indicating that fused ring DTT is probably better than bithiophene to enhance electron transport.
Facchetti et al. also reported a copolymer of naphthalene diimide (NDI) and bithiophene (P32, Fig. 5).63P32 shows an electron mobility of 0.06 cm2 V−1 s−1, when measured in the bottom gate, top contact configuration under vacuum, a factor of 30 enhancement compared to the PDI analog measured under the same conditions. The reason for this may be related to the fact that the NDI dibromide is readily synthesized as the pure 2,6-dibromo isomer, enabling the synthesis of a regioregular polymeric backbone. However, isolation of PDI dibromide regioisomers is difficult, leading to that the PDI monomer exists as two isomers (1,6 and 1,7-dibromo). Owing to higher regioregularity, the resulting NDI copolymers possess enhanced π-delocalization and π-stacking, consequently, better charge transport relative to PDI counterparts. Furthermore, the NDI-based devices have good ambient stability and perform well under ambient conditions for at least four weeks after fabrication (μe ≈ 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1). Interestingly, despite comparable LUMOs around −4 eV, the mobility of the PDI-based devices drops sharply to 2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 within one week, maybe due to the regioisomers in the PDI.63
Later, Facchetti et al. fabricated top-gate, bottom-contact transistors with polymeric dielectrics using P32 as the semiconductor, which exhibited electron mobilities of 0.10–0.85 cm2 V−1 s−1 under ambient conditions with on/off ratios >105.64 This improvement in performance may be due to decreased electron trapping in the top gate organic dielectric over the bottom gate octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) passivated silicon dioxide dielectric, or to morphology differences introduced by the different device processing history at the two different interfaces.64 Furthermore, P32 can be processed using gravure, flexographic, and inkjet printing, as well as by spin-coating, suggesting great processing versatility. Moreover, the first all-printed polymeric semiconductor complementary inverters on PET substrates with large gains (>25–60) and operating in ambient conditions were achieved.64
Luscombe et al. synthesized a series of copolymers of NDI and thiophene, bithiophene, and terthiophene.65 The HOMO and LUMO of the polymers increase with increasing the number of thiophene units. Increasing the number of the thiophene units effectively enhances polymer crystallinity and ordering, and finally electron mobility. Therefore, top-contact, bottom-gate transistors based on P33 (Fig. 5) exhibited the best electron mobility (0.076 cm2 V−1 s−1) under vacuum after annealing at 150 °C (Table 5).

        2,2′-Bithiophene-3,3′-dicarboximide (BTI) with π-core planarity, antiparallel BTI packing, a short cofacial π–π distance of 3.43 Å, and a favorable solubilizing group orientation is a promising building block in n-type polymers.66BTI homopolymer P34 (Fig. 5) exhibited good solubility and good thermal stability with onset decomposition at 401 °C. The P34 films exhibited multiple reversible electrochemical reduction waves with a LUMO of −3.47 eV and extremely high crystallinity. After an annealing process at 240 °C, n-channel FET, with films casting from CHCl3 solutions, exhibited the highest μe (1.1 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1), Ion/Ioff (2 × 107) and a high Vth (75 V) in vacuum.
Ambipolar semiconductors can transport both holes and electrons. Therefore, OFETs based on ambipolar semiconductors can operate in pure p-type or n-type mode or in a mode where hole and electron accumulations coexist. Due to this dual nature of ambipolar materials, the complementary integrated circuits could be fabricated using a single organic semiconductor. Vacuum deposited, single-component ambipolar FETs based on pentacene exhibited remarkable hole (0.5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and electron mobilities (0.2 cm2 V−1 s−1).12 Solution-processed, single-component ambipolar FETs based on small-molecular semiconductors have reached mobilities of 0.01 cm2 V−1 s−1.12 However, solution-processed, single-component ambipolar FETs based on polymeric semiconductors lag behind in terms of electrical performance.
Winnewisser et al. reported a low-bandgap ambipolar copolymer based on 2,5-dihydro-pyrrolo[3,4]pyrrole-1,4-dione (P35, Fig. 5).67P35 exhibited an IP of 5.5 eV, EA of 4.0 eV, and band gap of 1.5 eV. Ambipolar OFETs based on P35 exhibited maximum hole and electron mobilities of 0.1 and 0.09 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, in nitrogen. When driven under appropriate bias conditions the ambipolar transistors emitted near-infrared light. Facchetti et al. reported a low-bandgap ambipolar copolymer based on indenofluorenebis(dicyanovinylene) (P36, Fig. 5).68P36 exhibited an IP of 5.51 eV, EA of 4.15 eV, and band gap of 1.36 eV. P36-based OFETs are ambipolar in ambient conditions and exhibit similar electron and hole mobilities (∼2 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1) and Ion/Ioff ratios (∼104) with Vth values of ca. +5 V (n-channel) and ca. −10 V (p-channel). Although these mobilities are moderate, this was the first example of an air-stable ambipolar semiconducting polymer.68 Marder, Reynolds et al. reported a new soluble, spray-processable, donor–acceptor polymer based on dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]pyrrole and benzo[1,2-c;4,5-c′]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole (P37, Fig. 5).69P37 shows a solid state IP of ca. 5.0–5.1 eV, EA of ca. 4.4–4.2 eV, and a very low optical bandgap of 0.5–0.6 eV. These values suggest the possibility of facile injection of both holes and electrons from commonly used electrodes, and, therefore, of ambipolar charge transport. Ambipolar OFETs based on P37 exhibit hole and electron mobilities of 1.2 × 10−3 and 5.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, in nitrogen.69
Semiconductors for n-channel OFETs start to compete in the domain of organic electronics with p-type materials. Though ET polymers exhibit better solution processability compared to their small molecule counterparts, they show somewhat lower electron mobilities. To obtain high mobility, the control of the polymer organization in thin films is highly required, which frequently determines the electron transport properties in OFETs. The best transistor performance is achieved when the active layer is highly ordered or exhibits morphologies favoring the electron transport. This underlines the importance of the chain regioregularity of ET conjugated polymers which should be strictly controlled. To date, a great challenge to materials chemists is to design solution-processable air-stable ET polymeric semiconductors that have better performance in OFETs than amorphous silicon. To this end, a major breakthrough towards all-polymer complementary circuit technologies with greater circuit speeds, lower power dissipation, and more stable operation would be made.5
Electron transporting semiconducting polymers for OPVs
In an OPV device, the light passing through the transparent contact (ITO) is absorbed by the photosensitive layer to form excitons (hole–electron pairs) which dissociate into free holes and electrons at the interface between the donor and the acceptor layer. Holes and electrons transport in the donor and acceptor phases, respectively, and are collected at the electrodes, resulting in the generation of electrical power. Key figures-of-merit for OPV include the power conversion efficiency (PCE), short-circuit current (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), and fill factor (FF), defining the ratio between the output device electrical energy versus the input solar energy, the device current when no reverse bias is applied, the device voltage when no current flows through the cell, and the ratio between maximum power of the device and Jsc × Voc, respectively.5 Yu et al.70 and Halls et al.71 pioneered the introduction of the concept “bulk heterojunction” (BHJ), which is the best OPV device architecture so far. BHJ is a blend of bicontinuous and interpenetrating donor and acceptor components in a bulk volume. Such a nanoscale network exhibits a donor–acceptor phase separation in the tens of nm length scale, which is within a distance less than the exciton diffusion length. BHJ significantly increases the donor–acceptor interfacial area, leading to enhanced efficiency. Moreover, BHJ devices can be fabricated by high-throughput processing methodologies, such as spin coating, inkjet printing, gravure and flexographic printing.

Fullerenes, particularly the solution-processable one known as PCBM, owing to their excellent electron accepting and transporting properties, are the most widely used acceptors in BHJ solar cells. However, the primary disadvantage of fullerene derivatives is their weak absorption in the visible region. To improve the light absorption of photovoltaic cells, an effective approach is introduction of a conjugated polymer acceptor to form all-polymer blend BHJ. However, due to severe phase separation between two different conjugated polymers, invention of a conjugated polymer acceptor with enhanced light absorption and electron accepting and transporting properties similar to those of PCBM is a great challenge. To date, employment of conjugated polymer acceptors in polymer solar cells has met with limited success.7
The basic requirements for an ideal acceptor polymer material include: (a) good solubility and film-forming properties; (b) strong and broad bandwidth absorption; (c) high electron mobility; (d) suitable HOMO/LUMO energy levels relative to the p-type electron donor; the LUMO gap between the donor and acceptor should be large enough (>0.3 eV) to guarantee photoinduced electron transfer between them; the difference between the LUMO of the acceptor and the HOMO of the donor should be as large as possible to increase the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of solar cells; and (e) high purity and molecular weight.
In this section, we focus on representative ET polymers used to accept and transport electrons in polymer solar cells (PSCs). The molecular architecture, electronic structure (HOMO/LUMO and bandgap), electron mobility, and photovoltaic performance of diverse ET polymers are discussed. Most polymer acceptors are PDI and CN-PPV derivatives.
Conjugated PDI copolymer acceptors
Recently, perylene diimide (PDI) small molecules and polymers with large absorptivities, high electron mobilities, and electron affinities comparable to those of fullerenes are the object of interest as alternative acceptor materials. BHJ solar cells incorporating PDI-based acceptor polymers are among the most efficient all-polymer solar cells to be reported. The PDI-based polymer acceptor (P29, Fig. 5) synthesized by Zhan et al. and discussed in the previous section was also used as an acceptor in OPVs.60 This copolymer shows broad absorption (300–850 nm), stemming from a strong intramolecular charge transfer of the donor–acceptor arrangement of the main chain, low bandgap (1.7 eV) and high electron mobility (1–6 × 10−2 cm2 V−1 s−1). An average power conversion efficiency (PCE) over 1% was obtained at AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2 for all-polymer solar cells based on the blend of P29 as the electron acceptor and a bis(thienylenevinylene)-substituted polythiophene (2TV-PT) as the electron donor (1:1, w/w). Zhan et al. also synthesized a series of copolymers of PDI and dithienothiophene (DTT) with 1–3 DTT units and investigated the effect of the DTT number.62 The maximum absorption peak red shifts from 630 to 678 nm and the bandgap decreases from 1.7 to 1.5 eV with increasing number of DTT units (Table 6). LUMOs of these polymers are essentially unaffected, while the HOMO increases from −5.8 to −5.4 eV by increasing the conjugation length of oligo(DTT). All-polymer solar cells based on a blend of donor tris(thienylenevinylene)-substituted polythiophene (3TV-PT) and acceptor P38 (Fig. 6) give a little higher PCE than P29 and P39 (Fig. 6). Even higher PCE (1.48%) was achieved at AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2 from the blend of P38/3TV-PT by optimizing the donor/acceptor ratio (Table 6).72

Later, Hou et al. reported a similar PDI copolymer (P40, Fig. 6) containing cyclopenta[2,1-b:3,4-b′]dithiophene.73 The polymer exhibited similar HOMO/LUMO levels and Eg to the PDI-DTT polymers. A PSC device with P40 as the electron acceptor and poly{4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl)} as the electron donor exhibited a PCE of 0.43% (Table 6). Hashimoto et al. used a PDI-DTP copolymer (P41, Fig. 6), which is similar to P30 (Fig. 5), as an acceptor in PSCs.74 A PCE of 0.93% was achieved in the PSC device based on the blend of P41 and 3TV-PT. Replacing DTP in P41 with fluorene (P42, Fig. 6) leads to a blue shift in the absorption maximum, larger bandgap, higher LUMO, lower HOMO and lower PCE (Table 6).74 Introducing a thiophene unit as a spacer between PDI and DTP or fluorene in P41 or P42 leads to poor solubility, a red shift in the absorption maximum, lower bandgap, lower LUMO, higher HOMO and much lower PCE (0.13%).74

Copolymers of PDI with bithiophene or terthiophene (P43, Fig. 6) were also used as acceptors in PSCs.75 All-polymer solar cells based on the blend of P43 and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) showed a PCE of 0.8% (Table 6). Replacing terthiophene in P43 with bithiophene leads to a blue shift in the absorption maximum and lower PCE (0.4%).75 With an alternating PDI-phenylenevinylene copolymer (P44) as an acceptor and poly(3-phenylhydrazone thiophene) as an electron donor in PSCs, a PCE of 2.3% under white-light illumination calibrated to an AM1.5 intensity of 30 mW cm−2 was realized after annealing at 80 °C for 10 min.76 A bilayer PSC using the ladder polymer P28 (Fig. 5) as an acceptor in conjunction with a PPV donor exhibits a PCE of 1.5% at AM1.5, 80 mW cm−2.77
Other conjugated polymer acceptors

Cyano-substituted PPVs (CN-PPVs) possess relatively high electron affinities and excellent electron-transport properties due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the cyano group. Initially, CN-PPVs were used as electron injection and transport materials in OLEDs (see previous section). Recently, CN-PPVs were also used as a promising electron acceptor in all-polymer solar cells in either bilayer or BHJ configurations. A bilayer device based on P45 (Fig. 7) as acceptor and poly[3-(4-n-octyl)-phenylthiophene] (POPT) as donor fabricated by a lamination technique, showed a PCE of 1.9% at AM 1.5, 77 mW cm−2.78 Very recently, a PCE of 2%, the highest reported to date for an all-polymer OPV device, was achieved in a bilayer device with P45 as an acceptor and regioregular POPT as a donor fabricated by spin coating.79

A polymer blend device using poly[2,5-dimethoxy-1,4-phenylene-1,2-ethenylene-2-methoxy-5-(2-ethylhexyloxy)-(1,4-phenylenevinylene-1,2-ethenylene)] (M3EH-PPV) as the donor and poly[oxa-1,4-phenylene-1,2-(1-cyano)ethenylene-2,5-dioctyloxy-1,4-phenylene-1,2-(2-cyano)ethenylene-1,4-phenylene] (P46, Fig. 7) as the acceptor showed a PCE of 1% at AM1.5, 80 mW cm−2.80 Later, a higher PCE (1.7%) was reported in all-polymer solar cells using a blend of M3EH-PPV and P46 under illumination of 100 mW cm−2 as a result of the formation of a vertically composition graded other than homogeneous blend during spin coating,81 stemming from the much lower solubility of M3EH-PPV in chlorobenzene compared to P46. The vertically composition graded structure can facilitate both exciton separation and efficient transport of the separated charges to the electrodes. A series of bilayer devices using CN-PPV acceptors with varying LUMO levels and M3EH-PPV were investigated.82 It was observed that the open-circuit voltage increases and the quantum efficiency decreases with up-shifting the LUMO level of the acceptor.
A polymer/polymer BHJ solar cell based on a blend of poly[2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene] (MDMO-PPV) as the donor and an alternating copolymer poly{9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl-alt-1,4-bis[2-(5-thienyl)-1-cyanovinyl]-2-methoxy-5-(3,7-dimethyl-octyloxy)benzene} (P47, Fig. 7) as the acceptor was fabricated.83 The device exhibited a maximum external quantum efficiency of 52% at 530 nm and a PCE of 1.5% on an active area of 0.36 cm2. Poly(1,4-dioctyloxyl-2,5-dicyano-p-phenylenevinylene) (P48, Fig. 7), which has a CN group on the benzene ring instead of on the vinyl group, has a similar HOMO level to P45 (Table 7). A PCE of 0.8% was achieved from all-polymer solar cells using P48 as the acceptor and poly[3-(10-n-octyl-3-phenothiazinevinylene)thiophene-co-2,5-thiophene] (PV-PT) as the donor after thermal annealing at 120 °C.84

An ambipolar polymer, poly{(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl)-alt-[4,7-bis(3-hexylthien-5-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-2,2′-diyl]}(P49, Fig. 7), was explored as an electron acceptor in blends with donor P3HT.85 The optimized P49/P3HT device showed a PCE of 1.8% under simulated sunlight.
To simultaneously combine the expected benefits of polymers and the electron acceptor properties of fullerene, a main-chain C60 polymer, poly{(1,4-fullerene)-alt-[1,4-dimethylene-2,5-bis(cyclohexylmethyl ether)phenylene]} (P50, Fig. 7), was synthesized by atom transfer radical addition.86 A blend of P3HT:P50 was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) to yield nanoclusters (ca. 20 nm) favorable to exciton capture. Even without optimization of the chemical structure or the device, this device showed a promising PCE of 1.6%.
Although some polymer acceptors, e.g.PDI-DTT polymers, exhibit high mobilities and broad optical absorption, the performance of all-polymer solar cells does not yet compete with that of fullerene-based systems. The reasons remain unclear at present, but an ideal morphology and appropriate electronic coupling with the polymer donor are key issues that warrant further study. Compared to the spherical or ellipsoidal molecular shapes of fullerenes, the planar shapes of ET polymers may lead to enhanced π-stacking and more quasi one-dimensional exciton and electron transport. As a result, if polymer acceptor-rich phases do not have good long-range order, π-stacked acceptor phases may have multiple orientations and defects, which could trap a large amount of charge carriers and act as charge recombination centers. In contrast, the roughly spherical shapes of the fullerenes may facilitate three-dimensional exciton and electron transport and extend pathways for the efficient exciton diffusion and electron transport.5
Another possible origin for relatively lower PCE in all-polymer solar cells is large-scale phase separation in these systems. It is well known that a blend of polymers has an intrinsic tendency to phase separate due to the low entropy mixing. These phase-separated domains in polymer/polymer blends are usually hundreds of nm and are thus too large as compared to exciton diffusion length limitations in PSCs. While in the case of polymer/PCBM systems, the phase separation is only tens of nm. Thus the donor/acceptor interfacial area for charge separation in the polymer/PCBM systems is much larger than that in the polymer/polymer system. Given the fact that the typical exciton diffusion length in the disordered blend layer is about 10 nm, the large scale phase separation in the polymer/polymer system is not favorable for efficient exciton dissociation, leading to lower efficiencies. Very recently, Shuai et al. carried out dynamic Monte Carlo simulations for the all-polymer solar cells based on P29/2TV-PT blend. It was found that a 5% PCE could be achieved with an optimum combination of charge mobility and morphology (the featured phase separation size is around 10 nm).87
Conclusions and outlook
Great progress has been made in the synthesis and application of ET conjugated polymers to improve OLED performance through improved electron injection/transport and balanced charge injection/transport, to fabricate high-performance n-channel OFETs towards all-polymer complementary circuits, and to improve efficiency of polymer solar cells through improved absorption. Many different classes of ET polymers have been explored. Due to limited scope we just reviewed some representative ET conjugated polymers. Continued development of ET polymers will require a far better understanding of the relationships between molecular architecture, electronic structure, materials microstructure, and device performance. Based upon the studies surveyed in this review, we suggest that the following aspects may deserve further attention:
(i) To improve the efficiency, stability and durability of the polymer light-emitting diodes targeted for high brightness display and lighting applications, ET polymers having high Tg (>150 °C), high electron mobilities (>10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1), and suitable EA/IP aligned with that of the p-type emitter should be developed.
(ii) To realize printed, high-performance, all-polymer complementary circuits, solution-processable, air-stable, ET polymers that have higher mobility than amorphous silicon are highly desirable. ET polymers having a low LUMO (<−4 eV) and high chain regioregularity should be developed.
(iii) Developing a deeper understanding about why coplanar ET polymers with high mobility and broad absorption exhibit relatively low performance in PSCs. Well controlled morphology with highly ordered and tens of nm phase separation domains and appropriate electronic coupling with the polymer donor are important.
