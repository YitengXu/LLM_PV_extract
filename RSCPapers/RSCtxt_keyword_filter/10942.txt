    , Accepted 2nd February 2018First published on 2nd February 2018AbstractIn this study, we report that bimetallic iron–nickel sulfide nanowall arrays supported on nickel foam (Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam) via wet-chemistry conversion from its LDH precursor could perform the function of a high-performance and versatile catalyst toward both overall water and urea electrolysis in a base. Its efficiency for overall water splitting is superior to those of most newly reported transition metal-based bifunctional catalysts, with small cell voltage of 1.60 V needed to gain 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, this electrode also performs well toward the UOR, requiring very small potentials of 0.284 and 0.372 V (vs. SCE) to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. After replacing the anodic OER with the UOR that has a much lower thermodynamic voltage, this urea-mediated water-electrolysis device could sustain an overall current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low voltage of only 1.46 V (140 mV less than that for its urea-free counterpart) for over 20 h. Also, battery- and solar energy-assisted overall water and urea electrolysis devices were built to explore the viability of future less-energy-intensive and large-scale hydrogen generation.
Growing concerns about the deterioration of the environment and consumption of vast amounts of limited fossil fuels in recent decades have been motivating us to explore green and renewable energy resources.1,2 Among them, hydrogen fuel has always been recognized as an ideal alternative.3 And considering the high-energy heat input and CO2 emission within the mode of production of traditional steam methane reforming,4 its generation through water electrolysis has been paid much attention as an environmentally friendly and high-efficiency energy-conversion technique for sustainable energy supplies.5 Till now, the leading barrier to commercial application of water-splitting devices for large-scale production of hydrogen has been the sluggish four-proton-coupled reaction kinetics of the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER),6 which needs a large theoretical minimum thermodynamic potential of 1.23 V, leading to a low-efficiency overall water electrolysis and thereby large actual operating voltages up to about 1.8–2.0 V to drive this system.7 In this regard, two common and effective strategies have been developed to address this challenge: (1) designing highly active and low-cost anodic catalysts to expedite the kinetics and thus reduce the energy output for hydrogen production from electrolysis, and (2) substitution of the OER with other anodic oxidation reactions toward some more readily oxidizable molecules like hydrazine, urea, ethanol and glycerol to gain a combined energy-effective hydrogen-production system.
For the former, first-row transition metal- and carbon material-based superior OER catalysts have been developed, resulting in significant advances for the improvement of efficiency and cost-down of water electrolysis to replace traditional noble metal-based ones.8,9 Among them, it has been well-established that the combination of iron and nickel elements in the design of catalysts could provide an enhanced and ultrahigh OER performance on account of the synergistic metal–metal interactions.10,11 The forms of iron–nickel (FeNi) based anodic catalysts mainly include the corresponding oxides,10 layered double hydroxides (LDHs),11–14 metal–organic frameworks (MOFs),15 chalcogenides,8,16–19 phosphides,20–23 and nitrides.24–26 All these catalysts present superior OER catalytic activity, and some of them, such as NiFe-LDHs, NiFe–MOFs, and NiFe-based nitrides, could even be directly used as bifunctional catalysts to drive the overall water splitting. Nevertheless, the overall efficiencies of these devices are still relatively low with over 1.65 V needed to drive 10 mA cm−2, due to their relatively poor HER activities. Thus, for NiFe-based catalytic materials, simultaneously accelerating the HER/OER kinetic processes by regulating the composition and electronic structure as well as precisely designing the synthetic scheme to gain a high overall water-splitting efficiency (≤1.60 V at 10 mA cm−2) is a key point for commercial application of this kind of catalysts. Besides, catalysts in the form of powders should always be cast as an extraneous layer onto the electrode substrate surface using electrical insulation and inactive binding agents like Nafion, leading to possible mechanical shedding and catalyst degradation.9,10 Also, the nature of low conductivity of NiFe-based LDHs and MOFs is another limiting factor for their electrocatalytic performances.11,15,19,20,27 In view of these points, developing conductive and self-supported NiFe-based MOFs and corresponding MOF-converted catalysts, as well as LDH-converted chalcogenides, phosphides, and nitrides in the form of films or arrays is a widely recognized and highly viable scheme to enhance the catalytic activity toward the HER/OER.
For the latter, in contrast to the large thermodynamic cell voltage for water electrolysis, electrocatalysis of some more readily oxidizable molecules, such as urea, hydrazine, ethanol, glycerol, and so on, always needs a much lower theoretical voltage.28,29 Among these readily oxidized species, the cheap and non-toxic urea has been paid much attention because of its electrolysis needing an extremely low thermodynamic voltage of only 0.37 V under standard conditions30–32 and its oxidized products being only non-toxic CO2 and N2, making the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) an ideal candidate for less energy-intensive hydrogen production. In addition, urea generated from both fertilizer and animal excreta is always a dominant part of eutrophic wastewater;32–35 thus its electrolysis is promising for the integration of energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production systems with effective degradation of urea itself in urea-rich wastewater. Moreover, till now, transition-metal oxide-, phosphide-, and nitride-based catalytic materials in the form of ultrathin nanosheets or self-supported nanoarrays for alkaline whole urea electrolysis have already been intensively studied.29,31,32,35,36 These catalysts exhibit excellent catalytic activity toward both the HER and UOR, and thus could offer a high-efficiency hydrogen production system (commonly ≤1.50 V at 10 mA cm−2). By contrast, transition-metal chalcogenides, which have been widely reported for their role as high-performance bifunctional catalysts for water electrolysis on account of their superior conductivity and catalytic activity, have been rarely explored for urea electrolysis. It is worthy of note that although the cobalt sulfide phase has recently been reported for urea-assisted water electrolysis, its overall efficiency is relatively low with a large voltage of 1.59 V needed to afford 10 mA cm−2.37
Encouraged by the above two aspects, herein we introduce our recent finding that bimetallic iron–nickel sulfide nanowall arrays supported on nickel foam (Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam) by wet-chemistry conversion from its LDH precursor could act as a versatile and high-performance catalytic electrode for simultaneously catalyzing both the overall water splitting and urea electrolysis in a base. The fabrication process and utilization of this catalytic material as both anode and cathode for the overall water splitting and urea electrolysis are illustrated in Scheme 1. Its efficiency for overall water splitting is superior to those of most reported one-component transition metal-based catalysts, with a cell voltage of only 1.60 V needed to afford 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, when urea is integrated into this alkaline electrolysis system, the whole electrolysis efficiency could be significantly improved and thus the electrolytic hydrogen production becomes more energy-efficient, with sustaining an overall current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a voltage of only 1.46 V for at least 20 h (140 mV less than that for its urea-free counterpart), the reduced voltage of which should be ascribed to the more favorable thermodynamics of the UOR compared with the relatively sluggish OER. Note that the two-electrode systems for full water splitting and overall urea electrolysis with Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam as both the cathode and anode could also be well driven by a 1.5 V battery and a 2.0 V solar cell in 1.0 M KOH without or with 0.33 M urea.
 Scheme 1  Schematic illustration of the preparation process of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam via the combination of facile hydrothermal deposition and subsequent wet-chemistry anion-exchange methods. 
Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam was synthesized through the following procedures as shown in Scheme 1 (the detailed synthetic method is described in the Experimental section). (1) Ni foam with a macroporous zig-zag skeleton was chosen as the current collector, which could promote electrolyte penetration and ion diffusion, as well as expose a larger active area of the loaded catalyst;38 (2) NiFe LDH nanoarrays were hydrothermally grown on Ni foam; (3) highly ordered Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam was further obtained by a wet-chemistry topotactic conversion from its NiFe LDH precursor. The change of optical characteristics from dark yellow to black demonstrates the successful conversion of NiFe LDH/Ni foam to Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam (Fig. S1†). Fig. 1a shows the typical low-magnification scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of NiFe LDH on the skeleton of open-cell Ni foam, suggesting the complete coverage of the NiFe LDH phase on Ni foam in the form of highly oriented nanoarrays. A closer view of this nanoarray configuration (Fig. 1b) shows the smooth nanowall array structure of NiFe LDH with the thickness of this nanowall being approximately 90 nm (inset). After sulfuration conversion, the vertical nanoarray structure of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam was well-sustained (Fig. 1c), and both the lateral size of nanowalls and the distance between adjacent layers are around hundreds of nanometres (Fig. 1d). Note that each unit turns out to be more rough (inset in Fig. 1d), which could undoubtedly greatly enlarge the active surface area. The energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrum (Fig. 1e) and the corresponding elemental mapping images (Fig. 1f) demonstrate the presence and uniform distribution of Ni, Fe, and S elements on the Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam. Furthermore, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam (Fig. 1g) shows that other than three strong peaks at 44.5°, 51.8°, and 76.4° (marked with “”) indexed to the (111), (200), and (220) planes of Ni from Ni foam (JCPDS no. 87-0712), the diffraction peak positions and intensities of all other peaks accord well with those of the standard pattern of Ni3S2 (JCPDS no. 44-1418),17 indicative of its high crystallinity and the doping state of Fe element in this sample. The transmission electron microscope (TEM) image (Fig. 1h) of the Fe11.1%–Ni3S2 phase scratched from the Ni foam further shows a well-defined rough nanowall morphology. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image (Fig. 1i) reveals that this configuration has well-resolved lattice fringes with inter-planar distances of about 1.836 Å and 2.050 Å, which could be in general indexed to the (113) and (202) planes of Ni3S2, respectively. Note that both of these two values are slightly larger than the standard spacings of the above planes (1.8318 Å and 2.0417 Å), which might be ascribed to the low-level substitution of Fe for Ni.

(e) EDX elemental mapping images of Ni, Fe, and S elements and (f) the corresponding spectrum of the Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam. (g) XRD pattern, and (h) TEM and (i) HRTEM images of the Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam. 
The surface elemental compositions and valence states of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam were supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. The survey XPS spectrum proves the existence of Fe, Ni, and S elements in the Fe11.1%–Ni3S2 phase after wet-chemistry sulfuration conversion (Fig. S3a†), which is in good agreement with the EDX result. In the high-resolution Ni 2p region spectrum (Fig. S3b†), the two main peaks located at 855.7 and 873.4 eV could be ascribed to Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2, respectively, which are both characteristic of Ni2+ in Ni3S2.39,40 Meanwhile, the satellite peaks at 861.4 and 879.4 eV could be assigned to shakeup type peaks of Ni. In the Fe 2p region (Fig. S3c†), the two peaks at 713.4 and 725.1 eV could be attributed to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively, indicating that the valence state of Fe inside the material is +3.41,42 The S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 peaks located at 161.8 and 163.1 eV, respectively, should be assigned to S2− in the Ni3S2 phase (Fig. S3d†).17,18 Besides, the relatively large peak at 168.6 eV in Fig. S3d† should be attributed to surface impurities of typical Ni–O–S species, which is due to the surface oxidation of the catalyst exposed to air for a long time.43,44 The above results confirm the incorporation of Fe3+ into the Ni3S2 lattice. It is noteworthy that the peaks for Ni 2p in Fe11.1%–Ni3S2 are shifted toward lower binding energy compared with the ones in the commonly reported Ni3S2 phase, manifesting strong electron interactions after Fe doping.45–47
To evaluate the electrocatalytic performance of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam toward water splitting, this obtained material was directly used as a monolithic working electrode in a typical three-electrode configuration in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte at a relatively slow scan rate of 2 mV s−1 to minimize capacitive current.48 For comparison, the catalytic activities of NiFe LDH/Ni foam and bare Ni foam toward water electrolysis were also tested. Note that, in 1.0 M KOH, iR compensation was performed after each test using the equation Ecorrected = Euncorrected − Ecorrection = Euncorrected − iR,49 where E is the potential, i is the current flowing through the system, and R is the resistance. The value of R could be directly read out from the leftmost intersection between the Nyquist curve and the x-axis at high frequencies. In 1.0 M KOH, R = 2.84 Ω for Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam, R = 2.91 Ω for NiFe LDH/Ni foam, and R = 3.22 Ω for Ni foam. By contrast, all the electrochemical data tested in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea were recorded without iR compensation. Besides, after each test, potentials vs. the mercury/mercury oxide electrode (MOE) in each dataset were calibrated with respect to the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for the water-splitting test and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) for subsequent urea-electrolysis measurements, and currents in all tests were normalized to the geometrical area to be presented as current densities (in units of mA cm−2). Fig. 2a and b, S4 and S5† show the linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs) of HER and OER catalysis of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam, NiFe LDH/Ni foam, and bare Ni foam. As expected, for both HER and OER, both bare Ni foam and NiFe LDH/Ni foam exhibit inferior catalytic activities in the corresponding examined potential windows, whereas the catalytic performance of NiFe LDH/Ni foam toward both half-reactions is greatly improved after sulfuration conversion. In comparison, Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam presents the highest catalytic activity with a HER overpotential of 203 mV required to afford 50 mA cm−2 and OER overpotentials of 252 and 297 mV to achieve 100 and 500 mA cm−2, respectively, which are much smaller than those of the control samples (Fig. 2a and b). A closer inspection of the HER and OER LSVs shown in Fig. S4 and S5† reveals that Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam requires a small HER overpotential of only 126 mV to afford 10 mA cm−2 and an OER overpotential of 234 mV to drive 50 mA cm−2. These overpotential values for Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam (ηHER(10 mA cm−2) = 126 mV, ηHER(50 mA cm−2) = 203 mV, ηOER(50 mA cm−2) = 234 mV, and ηOER(100 mA cm−2) = 252 mV) also compare favorably with the behaviors of other state-of-the-art transition-metal oxides, chalcogenides, phosphides, nitrides, and LDHs (Tables S1 and S2†). It should be emphasized that commercial water electrolyzers always require long-term stable operations at overpotentials <300 mV to deliver an oxidative current density above 500 mA cm−2,6,50 indicating that this Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam electrode could be competent enough to be successfully applied to industrial water electrolysis. In addition, to simultaneously investigate the effect of different Fe contents on the HER and OER activities of Fex–Ni3S2/Ni foam, another two samples with Fe contents of 9.0% and 14.3% (denoted as Fe9.0%–Ni3S2/Ni foam and Fe14.3%–Ni3S2/Ni foam) were also prepared. Both Fe9.0%–Ni3S2/Ni foam and Fe14.3%–Ni3S2/Ni foam electrodes exhibit slightly inferior HER and OER activities compared to Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam (Fig. S6a and b†). Fig. 2c presents the Tafel plots for the HER and OER. The linear portions of the Tafel plots are fitted to the Tafel equation (η = blogj + a, where j is the current density, b is the Tafel slope, and a is the intercept relative to the exchange current density j0),51 yielding HER Tafel slopes of 89.0, 95.7, and 123.9 mV dec−1 and OER Tafel slopes of 61.7, 65.4, and 166.8 mV dec−1 for Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam, NiFe LDH/Ni foam, and bare Ni foam, respectively. Obviously, Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam presents the lowest Tafel slopes for both HER and OER, demonstrating its relatively faster kinetics toward both the electrode reactions and thereby higher catalytic activity.52

(d) Polarization curves of overall water electrolysis for Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam and NiFe LDH/Ni foam recorded in a two-electrode configuration with a scan rate of 2 mV s−1 in the reverse scan direction in 1.0 M KOH. (e) The comparison of voltage required at 10 mA cm−2 with other recently reported superior bifunctional electrocatalysts. (f) Chronopotentiometric curve of water electrolysis for Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam in a two-electrode configuration at a constant current density of 20 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH. 
Besides, durability is also a key concern for electrocatalysts. Fig. S7a and b† show the multistep chronopotentiometric curves of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam with the cathodic and anodic current densities increasing from 10 to 110 mA cm−2 (10 mA cm−2 per 500 s). The potentials immediately level off at the initial current value and remain constant for over 500 s, and the other subsequent steps show similar results, demonstrating the superior conductivity, mechanical robustness, and mass transportation of this catalyst.50,53 Also note that in Fig. S8 and S9,† when current density changes from one step to another, the HER and OER response times are less than 0.001 and 2 s, respectively, which also demonstrates the rapid mass and electron transfer.53 This result of the response time of the HER being far shorter than that of the OER is well consistent with the fact of a more sluggish reaction kinetics of the OER in contrast to that of the HER. Considering the superior and durable catalytic performance of this Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam electrode toward both the HER and OER, we further assembled a two-electrode single cell by using Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam as both the anode and cathode in 1.0 M KOH. This system demonstrates high electrolysis efficiency and could deliver overall current densities of 10 and 20 mA cm−2 at voltages of only 1.60 and 1.66 V (Fig. 2d), respectively, which are about 100 mV smaller than those for NiFe LDH/Ni foam and benchmark precious metal-based Pt/C(−)∥IrO2(+) and Pt/C(−)∥RuO2(+) pairs.15,54,55 Also, this performance at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 surpasses those of most recently reported bifunctional catalysts for overall alkaline water electrolysis (Fig. 2e, and the corresponding references are shown in Table S3†). Note that the overall electrolysis efficiencies in both water-splitting and subsequent urea-electrolysis systems were determined from the LSV curves in the reverse scan direction to avoid the effects of capacitive/oxidation currents, which otherwise would lead to an inflated high efficiency.56,57 Besides, in the long-term durability test conducted by continuous electrolysis at a static current density of 20 mA cm−2, a stable voltage of about 1.66 V could be well sustained for over 42 h with negligible degradation (Fig. 2f). The SEM images (Fig. S20a–f†) reveal that the overall nanowall morphology of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam after the stability test could be well retained. These results manifest the superior electrocatalytic stability of this Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam in a base. The H2 and O2 generated at the surface of the cathode and anode, respectively, were measured quantitatively with a calibrated pressure sensor to monitor the pressure change in the two compartments of the H-type electrolytic cell.58 The faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for the HER and OER were determined by comparing the amount of experimentally quantified gas with theoretically calculated gas (assuming 100% FE).28 The agreement of both values suggests near 100% FEs (Fig. S10†).
Although this overall water-splitting system driven by bifunctional Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam electrodes in a base only requires 1.60 V to yield 10 mA cm−2, a widely used figure of merit equivalent to ∼12% solar to hydrogen efficiency,16 the intrinsic sluggish reaction kinetics and large thermodynamic voltage of the OER remain the major bottlenecks for further improving the electrolytic hydrogen-evolution efficiency. As mentioned earlier, although the UOR has an intrinsically slower reaction kinetics involving a six-electron transfer process and complicated gas evolution (N2 and CO2) compared to the OER with four-electron transfer steps and single-component gas evolution of O2,36 the UOR itself requires a much lower thermodynamic voltage of 0.37 V than that for water electrolysis (1.23 V), offering us an appropriate anodic alternative to efficiently reduce the energy output for hydrogen generation.31
The catalytic activity of this Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam electrode toward the UOR has been studied using LSVs in 1.0 M KOH in the absence and presence of 0.33 M urea. As observed in Fig. 3a and S11,† this Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam shows an excellent UOR performance, with low potentials of 0.284 and 0.372 V (vs. SCE) needed to afford 10 and 100 mA cm−2, greatly surpassing that of the NiFe LDH/Ni foam precursor (0.407 V vs. SCE at 100 mA cm−2) and Ni foam (Fig. 3b) and almost all recently reported non-noble metal-based catalysts in the form of phosphides, oxides, hydroxides, chalcogenides, and nitrides (Table S4†). It is worthy of note that, apparently, the OER occurs at a high onset potential of about 0.4 V vs. SCE (Fig. 3a), revealing that this Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam anode is prone to catalyze the UOR rather than the OER in the potential window of 0.28–0.4 V. Fig. 3c exhibits the multi-step chronopotentiometric analysis results of this electrode in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. A staircase current density is applied from 10 mA cm−2 up to 110 mA cm−2 with an increment of 10 mA cm−2 per 500 s. At the starting current value, the potential immediately levels off and remains stable for the remaining 500 s, especially at higher current densities. A chronopotentiometric response time of 5 s (Fig. S12†) coincides with the fact of the inherent more sluggish kinetics of the UOR compared with that of the OER. The SEM images (Fig. S20g–i†) reveal that the overall nanowall morphology of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam after a long-term UOR test could also be preserved with a more rough surface. All of these results suggest the excellent mass and electron transfer kinetics and mechanical robustness of this catalyst toward the UOR. Besides, the gas bubbles generated at the anode (at a voltage of 1.46 V, shown in Fig. 4) were identified as N2 by gas chromatography (Fig. S13†). At the voltage of 1.46 V, there is almost no water-splitting current response in 1.0 M KOH (Fig. 2d and 3e), which means that almost no O2 gas will be generated at the anode. Besides, at 1.46 V in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea, the overall current density of 10 mA cm−2 is so small that the very small amount of CO2 generated would be completely dissolved in the electrolyte.59 We also compared the HER performance of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam in 1.0 M KOH with and without 0.33 M urea (Fig. S14†). There is no apparent difference of these two HER LSVs, showing that urea has little effect on the HER. Also, as expected, Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam shows much higher catalytic activity in contrast to NiFe LDH/Ni foam and bare Ni foam (Fig. S15†) and excellent catalytic durability toward the HER (Fig. S16†).

 Fig. 4  Optical photographs of whole water splitting (a–e) and overall urea electrolysis (f–j) devices powered by a 1.5 V battery or a 2.0 V solar cell with Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam as both the cathode and anode in 1.0 M KOH without or with 0.33 M urea. 
Moreover, to verify the feasibility of urea-mediated energy-saving electrolytic hydrogen production, we fabricated a two-electrode electrolyzer using Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam as both anode and cathode in a single cell with 1.0 M KOH and 0.33 M urea as the mixed electrolyte (Fig. 3d). This Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam pair requires a cell voltage of merely 1.46 V to reach 10 mA cm−2, 140 mV lower than that in 1.0 M KOH without urea (Fig. 3e). This value is comparable to those reported for Ni3N/CC∥Ni3N/CC (1.44 V)35 and MnO2/NF∥CoPx/NF (1.41 V),31 and compares favorably with those of MnO2/MnCo2O4/NF∥MnO2/MnCo2O4/NF (1.55 V),36 CoS2/Tim∥CoS2/Tim (1.59 V),37 Pt/C∥RuO2 (1.63 V)37 and Pt/C∥IrO2 (1.72 V)31 pairs. Beyond that, the long-term durability test of this electrolyzer was performed by continuous electrolysis at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 (Fig. 3f) with an inconspicuous damping of the voltage of 1.46 V after over 20 h of electrolysis.
The high water and urea electrolysis efficiencies of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam could be explained from experimental and theoretical aspects. Corresponding electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and double layer capacitance tests, as well as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, were performed. The Nyquist curves shown in Fig. S17† demonstrate that Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam has a smaller charge transfer resistance compared with NiFe LDH/Ni foam, proving a more rapid electron transfer rate of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam.60 In addition, the double layer capacitances at the solid/liquid interfaces of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam and NiFe LDH/Ni foam were tested to compare their active surface areas. Typical cyclic voltammograms of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam and NiFe LDH/Ni foam in the potential window of 0.1–0.2 V at different scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s−1 (vs. SCE) are shown in Fig. S18a and b,† in which the redox reactions do not occur and the cyclic voltammetric response is ascribed to the double layer charging alone. The capacitances for Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam and NiFe LDH/Ni foam were estimated to be 48.8 and 2.4 mF cm−2, respectively, from the fitting curves of current density differences at 0.15 V (vs. SCE) against the scan rates (Fig. S18c†), indicative of a much higher active surface area of Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam. The optimized structural representations of (a) Fe–Ni3S2 and (b) Ni3S2 and (c) the calculated charge density differences of Fe–Ni3S2 are provided in Fig. S19.† The charge density difference is obtained by subtracting the charge density of the isolated Ni3S2 surface from that of the Fe–Ni3S2 interfaces. The Ni, Fe, and S atoms are marked in grey blue, dark blue, and orange, respectively. The light blue and yellow regions represent charge loss and charge accumulation, respectively. These data indicate that the doped Fe could exert a partial-charge-transfer activation effect on Ni and thereby alter the intrinsic catalytic activity of the Ni3S2 phase.61,62
Furthermore, to study the active sites of this catalyst toward the HER/OER/UOR, SEM, XRD, and XPS data obtained after long-term electrolysis (10 mA cm−2 for 5 h) were analyzed here. The SEM images after long-term HER, OER, and UOR electrolysis (Fig. S20†) show that after the OER test, ultrasmall nanosheets were derived from the surface of these nanowalls, while after the UOR test, the overall nanowall structure turns out to be more rough and some nanoparticles were also derived. The derived nanoparticles or nanosheets should be parts of the real active sites. The XRD results shown in Fig. S21a† demonstrate that the crystal Ni3S2 phase is retained after these reactions, but the changes of peak intensity after the OER and UOR indicate that there are amorphous substances derived on the surface of the Fe–Ni3S2 nanowall, which is consistent with the SEM results. XPS analysis in the Ni 2p and Fe 2p regions (Fig. S21b and c†) indicates that no obvious change occurs in both the relative intensity and position of peaks in Ni 2p and Fe 2p regions after the HER test. But after the OER, a small peak at about 858 eV could be found, assigned to Ni3+ in NiOOH.63 Interestingly, after the UOR, the peaks in both Ni 2p and Fe 2p regions shift to a higher binding energy, where the peak at about 858 eV in the Ni 2p region could be assigned to NiOOH, and the peak at about 716 eV in the Fe 2p region might be assigned to a higher valence state of +4 for Fe species, which has been observed by Mössbauer spectroscopy in a NiFe–hydroxide based OER catalyst by Jin et al.64 The reason for the shift in the peaks in the Fe 2p region in UOR electrolysis and the nature of Fe species at a higher binding energy will be further studied in our follow-up work. Here, we could speculate the active sites and the form and effect of Fe species in this catalyst. (1) For the HER, the active site is Fe–Ni3S2, where the doped ferric iron could affect the electronic structure and enhance the overall conductivity. (2) For the OER, the active site is Fe–NiOOH/Fe–Ni3S2, where the doped ferric iron could enhance the conductivity and alter the electronic structure of both NiOOH and Ni3S2. (3) For the UOR, the active site might be Fe–NiOOH/Fe species with a higher valence state.
Water-electrolysis systems driven by the voltage derived from commercial battery and direct solar energy have always been valid matches to make electrolysis devices portable and lower the overall energy output.54,65–69 Accordingly, Fig. 4a and f show the optical images of 1.5 V battery-assisted overall water and urea electrolysis systems, respectively, and the corresponding short videos are shown in Movies S1 and S2.† A closer examination of these two systems (Fig. 4b and g) reveals clear evolution of both cathodic H2 and anodic O2 or N2/CO2 bubbles. It is noteworthy that the bubbles generated in battery-driven urea electrolysis (Fig. 4g) are bigger and flow faster than those in battery-driven overall water splitting, which further demonstrates that a much higher hydrogen-evolution efficiency at the same voltage could be gained by replacing the anodic OER with the UOR. Moreover, the photos of the 2.0 V solar panel-powered overall alkaline water and urea electrolysis devices are shown in Fig. 4c and h, respectively. To be specific, the anodic and cathodic Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam in the electrolysis configuration were linked to the positive and negative terminals of the solar panel, respectively. The voltages applied to the electrolyzers from the solar panel were monitored using a digital multimeter, which was also connected in parallel to the terminals of the solar panel.68 On account of the high open-circuit voltage and current density of the GaAs-based thin film solar cell, tunable voltages close to 1.60 and 1.46 V could be readily gained depending on the irradiation intensity of sunlight. From the enlarged photos with different angles in Fig. 4d, e, i, and j, the bubbles of cathodic H2 and anodic O2 or N2/CO2 generated on the surface of electrodes could be easily observed. We could also observe the continuous H2 and O2 evolution at about 1.61 V for the overall water splitting (10 mA cm−2) as well as H2 and N2/CO2 generation at 1.46 V for the whole urea electrolysis (10 mA cm−2) from Movies S3 and S4.† Such solar power-mediated overall water-splitting or urea-electrolysis devices have great prospects for application in portable, less-energy-intensive, and large-scale solar-to-hydrogen generation in future distributed energy storage technologies.67–69
In summary, bimetallic iron–nickel sulfide nanowall arrays supported on nickel foam (Fe11.1%–Ni3S2/Ni foam) via wet-chemistry conversion from its LDH precursor could perform the function of a high-performance and versatile catalyst toward both overall water and urea electrolysis in a base. Its efficiency of overall water splitting is superior to those of most newly reported transition metal-based bifunctional catalysts with a small cell voltage of 1.60 V needed to gain 10 mA cm−2. Moreover, this electrode also performs well toward the UOR with very small potentials of 0.284 and 0.372 V (vs. SCE) to achieve 10 and 100 mA cm−2 in 1.0 M KOH with 0.33 M urea. After replacing the anodic OER with the UOR, which has a much lower thermodynamic voltage, this urea-mediated water-electrolysis device could sustain an overall current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low voltage of only 1.46 V (140 mV less than that for its urea-free counterpart) for over 20 h. Also, battery- and solar energy-assisted overall water and urea electrolysis devices were built to explore the viability of future less-energy-intensive and large-scale hydrogen generation. This work not only introduces a NiFe-based catalyst with high efficiency toward both half reactions in water splitting, but offers a non-noble metal-based anodic material for efficient urea oxidation as well as providing new opportunities for utilizing bimetallic sulfide nanoarrays for simultaneous realization of energy-saving urea-assisted electrolytic production of hydrogen fuels and purification of urea-rich wastewater for various applications.
