    , Accepted 11th January 2017First published on 11th January 2017AbstractLead halide perovskite solar cells show poor stability due to their ionic material character. Here, we introduce a dipping method to modify the perovskite layer with 3-hydroxypyridine molecules. The long-term stability of solar cells is greatly enhanced and shows no obvious decay after 90 hour steady-state measurements.
Organic–inorganic halide perovskite materials have a common structure with the ABX3 formula, typically composed of a large cation, A = (methylammonium (MA) CH3NH3+; formamidinium (FA) CH3(NH2)2+; Cs+),1–3 a divalent metal ion, B = (Pb2+, Sn2+),4 and a halogen anion X = (I−, Br−, Cl−).5–7 They achieve remarkable materials properties, such as high absorption in the visible range,4 long carrier diffusion length,8–10 and a tunable band gap from 1.1 to 2.3 eV by substituting the cations and/or anions partially.11–14 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the most significant parameter in photovoltaic devices, has risen from 3.1% to the current record of 22.1%15 since Miyasaka et al. used CH3NH3PbX3 (X = Br, I) as a sensitizer in dye-sensitized solar cells for the first time in 2009.16 Although the PCE of PSCs soared to a high value close to silicon based solar cells, PSCs are still very challenging for commercial applications due to their instability.17 In the past, the steady-state test at the maximum power point (MPP) was usually reported over a few hundred seconds.18–20 Nowadays, intensive attention has been focused on this problem and some achievements have been made. For example, Back et al. achieved a long-term stability of over 20000 s via ion neutralization.21 Li et al. found that employing a defective TiO2 film as an electron transport layer can dramatically improve the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells.22
Like most ionic materials,23 the perovskite crystal has a reasonable quantity of non-coordinated ions, especially at the surfaces and grain boundaries. As is known to all, defects always act as a non-radiative recombination in the perovskite layer, which would impair the quality of devices, mainly in their PCE. It has been proved by previous work done by Noel et al.18 that through spin-coating a layer of a Lewis base (pyridine or thiophene) to the perovskite surface, the PL lifetime of perovskite films can be extended by one order of magnitude. On the other hand, ion migration has been regarded as the major cause of not only photocurrent hysteresis but also material degradation.24–27 Due to rather low activation energy, ions, especially I− anions, can migrate rather easily in a crystal, even between different crystals, as confirmed earlier in several experiments.28,29 Inhibiting the ion migration will improve the long-term stability of PSCs in this sense.
In this study, we introduce an easy and effective method to significantly improve the long-term stability of PSCs. A 3-hydroxypyridine (3-HP) dipping method is developed to extend device stability. An average PCE of more than 15% has been achieved. Even after several tens of hours of continuous operation at a fixed voltage bias (MPP), the output power conversion efficiency decayed by less than 12%. The prolonged PL lifetime indicates that 3-HP has a passivating effect on perovskite films, which has profound significance in the structural stability of the material and then in the long-term stability of the device.
The whole process of 3-HP dipping treatment is exhibited in Fig. 1a. When the perovskite film was prepared, the substrate was dipped into the 3-HP solution. After 5 minute immersion (different immersion times were applied and the optimization results are shown in Fig. S1, ESI†), a considerable quantity of 3-HP molecules was absorbed on the surface as detected by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shown below. Here, 3-HP was selected as the Lewis base to modify the perovskite film. On the basis of the molecular structure shown in Fig. 1b, 3-HP possesses three lone pairs of electrons, one pair from atom N and two pairs from atom O, making it easy to form a Lewis adduct with a Lewis acid.

Lead acetate trihydrate (PbAc2·3H2O) and methylammonium iodide (MAI) were applied to create a precursor solution in this study. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra of the perovskite thin films before and after dipping are shown in Fig. 2a and b and Fig. S2 (ESI†). From Fig. 2a and b, the perovskite grain size reached approximately 750 nm on average. The top-view images demonstrate full coverage of the film on the substrate in the absence of pin-holes, and this is essential for achieving high quality devices. According to the XRD spectra (Fig. 2c), it is evident that the perovskite material we prepared through the one-step spin-coating method shows an orthorhombic crystal structure. The films exhibit clear diffraction peaks at 14.16°, 28.48°, and 31.92°, which we assigned to the (110), (220) and (310) planes, respectively.30 In the meanwhile, no signature of a peak at about 12.65° (the (001) diffraction peak for PbI2) was detected, indicating a high purity of the perovskite material without PbI2. There is no difference between before and after dipping in both SEM images and XRD spectra. It demonstrates that the 3-HP dipping method has no influence on the morphology and the structure of the perovskite material.

Oxygen is the characteristic element for the molecule 3-HP. To detect the existence of 3-HP molecules on the surface of the perovskite film, we performed XPS measurements. Fig. 3a shows the two main peaks of Pb, Pb 4f7/2 and Pb 4f5/2. Signals of O 1s are shown in Fig. 3b. The area ratio of the different peaks is proportional to the amounts of different elements. We estimate the value of the O/Pb ratio to be 0.071 and 0.036 for the sample with 3-HP and the control sample, respectively. In other words, the content of O has doubled after 3-HP treatment. This strongly supports the existence of 3-HP absorbed on the surface of the perovskite film. For the control sample, a small quantity of oxygen was also detected, because the film absorbs the molecules of oxygen gas and moisture from the air unavoidably. It is noteworthy that there are two small peaks located at around 136.4 eV and 141.3 eV for the control sample in Fig. 3a. We attribute them to the presence of metallic Pb.31 The metallic lead species in the film may be the non-radiative recombination centers,32 which is harmful to the solar cell devices. In contrast, for the sample after 3-HP treatment, these two peaks disappeared. It implies that there is a substantial reduction in the content of metallic lead, which benefits the photovoltaic performance of solar cell devices.

(c) Time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) of perovskite films with and without 3-HP treatment. (d) Schematic diagram of a Lewis adduct constructed from 3-HP molecules and the perovskite. 
To investigate the fundamental effect of 3-HP molecules on perovskite films, we measured the time-resolved photoluminescence (PL). The PL decay curves were fitted by a single exponential equation. As demonstrated in Fig. 3c, the lifetime for the 3-HP sample was 198.5 ns compared with 13.3 ns for the control one. It suggests that the number of recombination centers has sharply decreased. On the one hand, it is in good agreement with the Lewis acid and base theory: 3-HP, as a Lewis base, donates a pair of electrons to the I− ion vacancy on the perovskite surface, which, as a Lewis acid, could accept the pair of electrons. Due to the formation of a Lewis adduct, the surface of film was passivated effectively (Fig. 3d). In the meantime, according to XPS analysis, the reduction of metallic lead could also make a contribution to the enhancement of the charge-carrier lifetime.
The long-term steady efficiency was measured and the results are shown in Fig. 4. In our study, we simulated the real working conditions of a solar cell in daily life. The solar cells were working at a constant voltage bias (MPP) under continuous AM 1.5 light illumination. After each continuous operation, we set a 10 hour rest, and in this period, the device was placed in the dark to simulate the conditions of night. The total testing process, including working and dark conditions, was conducted in a nitrogen glovebox. As shown in Fig. 4a, the long-term stability of the PSC has significantly improved after 3-HP dipping. The PCE was maintained at approximately 90% of the initial value after around a 90 hour test. The three current–voltage curves in Fig. 4b correspond to the three time points as we have marked in Fig. 4a in different colors, respectively. We only observed a small decrease in the maximum power conversion efficiency from 15.2% to 13.5%. No obvious degradation was discovered at these three curves, indicating a stable working state of the solar cells. In contrast, the sample without 3-HP dipping treatment shows a total difference in stability. The control sample could not give a steady output for more than half an hour (Fig. 4c). To rule out the influence of crystallized water from PbAc2·3H2O, we performed control experiments. PbCl2 was chosen as the lead source in precursor solution and similar results were obtained (Fig. S3, ESI†). The interaction between a Lewis acid and a Lewis base is a dative bond. Here, we consider that the bonding effect between the 3-HP molecule and the perovskite (evidenced by NMR measurements, Fig. S4, ESI†) makes a great contribution to passivating the defects. During the annealing process of MAPbI3, I− anions can be lost from the crystal easily, resulting in I− vacancies both on the surface and at the grain boundaries. The defects can accept lone pairs of electrons from Lewis bases such as 3-HP molecules here. On the other hand, degradation of the material usually occurs where there are plenty of active defects. The bonding effect lowers the activity of these defects, so the interaction between the 3-HP molecule and the I− vacancy can suppress the degradation of the material. Thus, the structure of the perovskite material can be stabilized due to this effect. Ion migration usually occurs with the help of defects. Thus, we speculate that the coordinate bond formed between 3-HP and perovskite could suppress ion migration to some extent, although more work is needed to get direct evidence. Hence, through this method, an excellent performance from the device can be easily achieved.

In summary, we have demonstrated that the long-term stability of perovskite solar cells was significantly improved after 3-hydroxypyridine dipping treatment. Using this method, the devices can easily undergo tens of hours of continuous working test at maximum power point without obvious decay (less than 12% for about 90 hour measurements). According to the time-resolved photoluminescence results, the lifetime was prolonged due to the passivating effect on the defects. This simple method provides a strategy for enhancing the stability of the perovskite material, and is very promising in practical applications of PSCs.
