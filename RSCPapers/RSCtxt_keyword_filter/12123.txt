    , Accepted 26th February 2016First published on 9th March 2016AbstractPolymeric tandem solar cells and modules with commercially available absorber materials are investigated. The optimized tandem cells with nanoparticle-based ZnO recombination layer show good performance with PCDTBT and Si-PCPDTBT as two complementary absorber polymers. Power conversion efficiencies of up to 6.9% are achieved with spin coated reference cells. All layers of the tandem stack (except for the electrodes) are deposited from solution. Furthermore, we could prepare efficient tandem cells with efficiencies up to 6.3% by doctor blading in ambient atmosphere, demonstrating an industrially relevant deposition technique more suitable than the commonly used spin coating. First tandem modules consisting of 3 or 5 cells stripes and interconnected in series have been prepared. Encouraging module efficiencies of 5.2% (1.3 cm2 active area) and 4.7% (2.1 cm2 active area) are demonstrated with nearly no losses in open circuit voltage compared to the individual tandem cells. Hence, the described device architecture as well as the serial interconnection indicates the high potential for an industrial fabrication of polymer tandem modules.
Introduction
The performance of organic solar cells has increased rapidly in the last years. However, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) are still too low for broad commercialization. Tandem and multi-junction structures are regarded as the most promising way to enhance the efficiency.1–5 In 2013, solution-processed tandem bulk heterojunction polymer solar cells surpassed the 10% PCE threshold for the first time,6 demonstrating the high potential of the tandem architecture.7,8 In the meantime, 10% for single,9–11 11% for tandem12,13 and >11.5% for triple14,15 structures have been reached.
Tandem cells combine two stacked subcells which are generally connected in series. This structure reduces thermalization losses and enhances the usage of the solar spectrum by combining two absorber layers with appropriate absorption ranges. The recombination layer (RCL) which separates the two subcells and connects them is crucial for the performance of the devices. An electrically sufficiently conductive RCL enables three-terminal devices and offers the possibility to measure the two subcells individually for devices either connected in parallel16,17 or in series configuration.18,19 From an industrial point of view, solution-processed RCLs like TiOx/PEDOT:PSS20 or PEDOT:PSS/PEIE21 are beneficial. Recently, most of the best results were obtained with ZnO-based RCLs in two-terminal standard22 or inverted architectures.6,23–26
For a potential commercialization of organic solar cells, an up-scaling of the active area without too much loss in efficiency is a necessary condition.27,28 Furthermore a cost-effective deposition method at ambient atmosphere and an efficient interconnection of the cells to large-area modules is needed. Efficient modules with single junction cells with 7.5% PCE were realized by using slot-die coating and doctor blading.29
Li et al. demonstrated doctor bladed tandem cells at environmental conditions with 6–7% PCE.30 Fully roll-to-roll coated tandem cells with a semitransparent Ag-nanowires/ZnO electrode fabricated by Krebs and co-workers achieved an efficiency of 2.66%.31 However, up to now, only few examples of solution-processed tandem modules exist.32–35
A fully printed tandem module on flexible substrate was already demonstrated with a rather low, but certified efficiency of 1.76% for an active area of 2.2 cm2.32 In contrast, on very small area (10 mm2), higher module efficiencies up to 5.7% were demonstrated for three tandem cells connected in series.34,35 For a larger module consisting of 10 tandem cells and a medium area of 1.1 cm2 3.3% PCE have been obtained.34
Here, we present efficient two-terminal polymer tandem cells as well as serially connected modules using commercially available polymers, namely poly[[9-(1-octylnonyl)-9h-carbazole-2,7-diyl]-2,5-thiophenediyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole-4,7-diyl-2,5-thiophenediyl] (PCDTBT) and poly[(4,4′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole)-2,6-diyl-alt-(2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)-4,7-diyl] (Si-PCPDTBT, also known as PSBTBT), each blended with the fullerene [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butric acid methyl ester (PCBM[70]) as absorbers (Fig. 1). As RCL ZnO nanoparticles in combination with pH-neutral PEDOT:PSS and an ultrathin Nafion-layer was used. Furthermore, we could also demonstrate the deposition of all layers from solution (except for the outer electrodes) not only by spin coating but also by doctor blading in ambient atmosphere – an important step towards an industrially compatible process.

Experimental
The tandem cells and modules were prepared in a flowbox in ambient atmosphere on textured ITO-coated glass substrates (VisionTek Systems Ltd., 14 Ω sq−1). The substrates were plasma-etched with argon (Diener electronic, Pico) before coating them with a thin layer of diluted poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, Clevios P VP AI 4083, Heraeus). Afterwards, the coated substrates were annealed for 10 min at 200 °C on a hot plate. Subsequently, the absorber layer was deposited from a blend of PCDTBT (7 mg, from Konarka, now BELECTRIC OPV) and PCBM[70] (28 mg, from Solenne) dissolved in dichlorobenzene with 35 mg ml−1 (ratio of 1:4). In-house synthesized ZnO nanoparticles36,37 dispersed in acetone (layer thickness of 25–30 nm), the pH-neutral PEDOT:PSS Orgacon (Agfa, diluted 1:1 with DI-water)38 (25–30 nm for spin-coated and 45–60 nm for doctor bladed layers) and a very thin layer of Nafion (Sigma-Aldrich, diluted 1:200 with ethanol)39 of a few nanometers (not quantifiable with SEM) were applied as the RCL. The Nafion layer recovers the reduced work function of the Orgacon layer39 and protects the layers underneath, especially the first absorber layer, during the deposition of the second absorber layer consisting of a blend of Si-PCPDTBT (Konarka) and PCBM[70] in dichlorobenzene with a ratio of 1:1.75 (29 mg ml−1). All solution-based layers were deposited either by spin-coating or doctor blading. Finally, a LiF/Al back contact was deposited by thermal evaporation in a vacuum better than 1 × 10−5 mbar. The reference single cells were prepared similarly (unless otherwise noted) with ITO/PEDOT:PSS and LiF/Al as the electrodes. For the tandem modules, on two edges of the ITO substrate a 0.5 cm wide strip of ITO was removed with warm (50 °C) HCl to avoid short circuits when contacting the front electrode. All layers were deposited by doctor blading with the same parameters as used for the individual tandem cells. The monolithical series interconnection was done by locally removing deposited material in patterning lines P1, P2, and P3 after different deposition stages at a line distance of 0.1 mm. The P1-patterning of ITO as well as the P2-patterning of the tandem stack before deposition of the LiF/Al contact was done by laser scribing with a diode pumped Nd:YAG-laser at 1064 nm and a pulse duration of 25–30 ns. Afterwards, mechanical structuring with a stylus was used for the final P3-patterning. Current–voltage analyses were carried out with a 2-lamp WACOM solar simulator (class AAA, AM1.5G, 100 mW cm−2) and a Keithley 2400 current source measuring unit. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were done without bias light using a set-up by Optosolar. Dark lock-in thermography (DLIT) measurements were carried out on a system from Thermosensorik GmbH.
Results and discussion
First of all we investigated different commercially available absorber polymers and identified PCDTBT and Si-PCPDTBT as adequate materials for tandem devices. The absorption spectra of these polymers show some overlap but Si-PCPDTBT (Egap = 1.45 eV) has a considerably broader absorption range (see ESI Fig. S1†) than PCDTBT (Egap = 1.9 eV) ensuring a high current in a tandem device when used as the second subcell. PCDTBT is a suitable material for the first subcell because of its wide band gap and a very high open-circuit voltage Voc of ≈900 mV. The highest PCEs of up to 5.9% (Voc = 918 mV, jsc = 10.2 mA cm−2, FF = 63.2%) in single cells are achieved for thin absorber layers (≈70 nm) and a blend ratio of 1:3. However, current matching in tandem devices requires a thicker absorber layer in the first subcell in order to compensate for a reduced current due to the lack of an adjacent reflecting metallic electrode compared to a single cell. Cells with thicker (130–140 nm) PCDTBT absorber and a blend ratio of 1:4 have unavoidable losses in FF but still show an acceptable performance of 4.2% (Voc = 882 mV, jsc = 8.6 mA cm−2, FF = 55.3%) for the best spin coated devices and 4.3% (Voc = 897 mV, jsc = 8.3 mA cm−2, FF = 57.7%) for the best doctor bladed devices. This thicker PCDTBT absorber with a blend ratio of 1:4 was used for the tandem devices as with these parameters the best results were achieved.
For Si-PCPDTBT-based cells a maximum PCE of 5.6% (Voc = 583 mV, jsc = 14.8 mA cm−2, FF = 64.8%) for the spin-coated device and 5.6% PCE (Voc = 631 mV, jsc = 13.8 mA cm−2, FF = 64.0%) for the doctor bladed devices were obtained for 80–85 nm thick absorber layers. It can be seen that for doctor blading very similar performances of the absorbers compared to spin-coating could be achieved. Small differences in Voc, jsc and FF are probably caused by a different drying of the absorber layer depending on the deposition method. Tandem cells with the structure ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PCDTBT:PCBM[70] (125–140 nm)/ZnO/PEDOT:PSS/Nafion/Si-PCPDTBT:PCBM[70] (75–105 nm)/LiF/Al (see Fig. 1) have been prepared by spin-coating and doctor blading. Tandem cells based on this structure were reproduced in more than 40 experiments with PCEs of ≥6%.
The highest PCEs were achieved with the combination of spin-coating (PCDTBT absorber) and doctor blading (Si-PCPDTBT absorber), leading to a record cell with a PCE of 6.9% (Voc = 1482 mV, jsc = 8.3 mA cm−2, FF = 56.1%, Fig. 2) and an average efficiency of 6.3%. It should be noted that there is always a trade-off between FF and jsc. A slight increase of the absorber layer thickness (especially the PCDTBT subcell) increases the jsc a little, but the simultaneous losses of the FF result in a lower PCE.

As mentioned above, from an industrial point of view, the spin-coating technique is not very suitable because of the high material loss and the incompatibility with a roll-to-roll production. Here we could demonstrate a highly efficient organic tandem cell with a maximum PCE of 6.3% (Voc = 1502 mV, jsc = 7.8 mA cm−2, FF = 53.1%) that was fully deposited by doctor blading (except for the two electrodes). Our recent results reveal a slight increase in Voc but also small losses in FF and jsc compared to the spin-coated devices (Fig. 2). These small but significant differences are most likely caused by different drying conditions of the two deposition methods. In addition for our best doctor bladed cells the thickness of the PEDOT:PSS layer was considerably thicker. Therefore further investigation and optimization of the layer thicknesses and deposition parameters, especially for the PCDTBT absorber, is necessary but should enable doctor bladed devices to perform as well as spin-coated ones.
The high Voc demonstrates the good quality of the series connection by the ZnO/PEDOT:PSS/Nafion RCL. Compared to single reference cells made with the deposition parameters that have been optimized for tandem devices, the voltage of the tandem cells correspond to the sum of the equivalent reference single cells, as it is expected for high quality devices (see Table 1 in the ESI†).
Next, the tandem cells were connected to modules. We chose serial interconnection as this type seems to have higher potential compared to parallel interconnection.40 The tandem structure as described above in Fig. 1 was used. The substrate sizes of the modules were 30 × 30 or 30 × 50 mm2, respectively. Schematically, the tandem structure of the modules with the 3 patterning lines P1, P2 and P3 for series interconnection is shown in Fig. 3(a).
 Fig. 3  (a) Tandem module interconnection with 3 patterning lines, (b) I–V-curves of a tandem module with 5 cell stripes connected in series. The voltage of each tandem cell is added up by measuring the cells 1–5 together (active area 2.12 cm2). 
In Fig. 3(b) the I–V-curves of a tandem module with 5 cell stripes are shown. Each cell stripe has a Voc of 1.46–1.50 V which sums up to 7.39 V for the Voc of the module. The efficiency (active area) of this module was 4.7% (active area = 2.12 cm2) with a current of 2.76 mA and a FF of 49.1%. By reducing the cell area and the number of cells, we could obtain mini-modules with no losses in Voc. The champion tandem module with an active area of 1.28 cm2 (1.33 cm2 absolute) and 3 cell stripes exhibits for the active area a module efficiency of 5.24%, a Voc of 4.5 V, a current of 2.85 mA and a FF of 52.3% (Fig. 4(b)). The stripes have a width of 5 mm and a loss of 0.25 mm caused by the structuring of P1, P2 and P3 resulting in an active cell width of 4.75 mm, in a geometric fill factor of 95% and in an efficiency of 5.0% absolute. Each of the cell stripes has a Voc of 1.50 V which is the same as we have obtained for the best individual tandem cell described above. We conclude that on one hand our serial interconnection works very well and on the other hand that we have no defects within the module, because the DLIT image shows a homogenously distributed signal across the three individual cells (bright areas) with no indication of local shunting or defect paths (Fig. 4(a)).

Conclusions
In summary, we have presented efficient solution-processed tandem solar cells and modules with PCDTBT:PCBM[70] as the first and Si-PCPDTBT:PCBM[70] as the second absorber. Except for the electrodes, all layers are deposited from solution. For the spin-coated tandem cells a PCE of 6.9% was achieved. We could successfully demonstrate that the industrially more relevant deposition method of doctor blading is possible for all solution-processed layers leading to a PCE of 6.3%. There is still room for improvement of the FF and jsc by fine tuning the layer thicknesses and deposition parameters, but the high Voc of 1.5 V illustrates the good series connection of the subcells. Encouraged by these results, we prepared our first serially connected doctor bladed tandem modules with 3 or 5 tandem cells, respectively. Module efficiencies (active area) of 4.7% (5 cells) and 5.2% (3 cells) could be demonstrated with only small or no losses in Voc. Therefore, our work represents a further step towards an industrial production of highly efficient polymer tandem modules.
