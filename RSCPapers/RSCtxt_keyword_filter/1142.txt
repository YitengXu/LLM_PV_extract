    , Accepted 19th February 2023First published on 20th February 2023AbstractAll-inorganic perovskites have been widely explored for high-performance photodetectors (PDs), owing to their high carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, and excellent visible light absorption, etc. However, the poor film quality of solution-prepared all-inorganic perovskites inevitably limits the development of PDs. Here, we present the successful incorporation of lanthanide ions (Ln3+ = Pr3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Eu3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, and Yb3+) into all-inorganic CsPbI2Br films to significantly improve the film quality and largely enhance the performance of PDs. Arising from the enlarged grain size and enhanced crystallinity of perovskite films upon Ln3+ doping, the detectivity (D*) and stability of PDs are significantly improved. In particular, PDs with Yb3+ doping achieve the best performance, and display an effective response range of 300–700 nm and quick response time (640 ns) with a D* of 4.6 × 1012 Jones in contrast to 3.7 × 109 Jones for pristine PDs. These findings offer new insights into the development of high quality perovskite films and highly sensitive and stable PDs.
Introduction
Photodetectors (PDs) possess the ability to covert optical signals to electrical signals, and have extensive applications in many fields, such as optical communication, environmental monitoring, biosensing and military security.1–5 Solution-processed halide perovskites have become a star material for PDs because of their tunable optical bandgap, large absorption coefficient, long carrier diffusion length, simple preparation, low cost, etc.6 Rapid and impressive progress in perovskite PDs has been achieved based on organic–inorganic perovskites and inorganic perovskites.7,8 Among them, all-inorganic perovskites have relatively high stability, high carrier mobility and long carrier lifetime, and are recognized as promising candidates to push PDs toward commercial applications.9,10 However, the poor film quality of all-inorganic perovskites with high trap density and crystal defects leads to the nonradiative charge recombination, bringing about poor performance of PDs. A number of strategies have been carried out to improve their film quality, such as the use of organic additives, passivators, quantum dots, ion doping, etc., resulting in the enhanced performance of these devices.11–15
Lanthanide (Ln3+) ions have a similar ionic radius to lead (Pb2+), and are recognized as an ideal doping candidate to substitute Pb2+, thereby obtaining high performance of perovskite materials and devices. For instance, various Ln3+ ions, such as europium ions (Eu3+),16 ytterbium ions (Yb3+),17 cerium ions (Ce3+),18 samarium ions (Sm3+),19 and erbium ions (Er3+),20 have been doped into perovskite nanocrystals or single crystals (CsPbI3) to significantly boost the optical performance. Ce3+, Nd3+ and Eu3+ were incorporated into inorganic–organic hybrid/all inorganic (MAPbI3, CsPbBr3) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to highly enhance the power conversion efficiency and stability.21,22 Chun-hua Yan et al. achieved PSCs with long-term stability by using the Eu3+–Eu2+ ion pair. These improvements can be ascribed to the better crystal quality, the decrease of defects, and/or the “redox shuttle” that selectively oxidized Pb0 and reduced I0 defects, etc.22 However, there are few reports on PDs obtained through the engineering of Ln3+ doping.
In this work, various Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Pr3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Eu3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, and Yb3+) ions were doped into the inorganic CsPbI2Br films by a modified one step-coating method. After doping, the quality of CsPbI2Br films is significantly improved with better crystallinity and enlarged grain size, bringing about a reduced number of defects and carrier recombination and ameliorating the charge transport performance. By optimizing the stoichiometric ratio and species of Ln3+, the PDs based on CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ films achieve a D* of 4.6 × 1012 Jones with a detection range of 300–700 nm. Compared with the pristine CsPbI2Br PDs, they exhibit reduced noise current and increased D* by 3 orders of magnitude, and better stability.
Results and discussion
The pristine CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Pr3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Eu3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, and Yb3+) perovskite films were prepared through a modified one step-coating method (see Method, ESI†). As displayed in Fig. 1a, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of pristine CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ films demonstrate that a small grain size with many holes is identified in CsPbI2Br. Clearly, the grain size becomes larger and holes become fewer after incorporating various Ln3+ into CsPbI2Br. The average size of CsPbI2Br is ∼110 nm, which considerably increases to ∼130–450 nm (Fig. S1, ESI†). It could be attributed to the altered surface energy during crystallization and more orientated crystalline domains by Ln3+ doping,23 thereby beneficial for larger grain size and better crystallization for CsPbI2Br:Ln3+. They can reduce the recombination of charge and defects.24

(f) Time-resolved PL decay curves of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ films. 
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of as-obtained CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ films were examined, as shown in Fig. 1b. All the samples present similar diffraction peaks without any additional impurity peaks, indicating that these perovskite films belong to the same crystal structure of perovskite. The amplified [200] diffraction peaks are significantly narrower than the sharpest peaks in CsPbI2Br:Yb3+. They gradually shift to larger angles in CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ with the increase of Ln3+ ions atomic numbers, obeying the order Pr3+ < Nd3+ < Eu3+ <Gd3+ < Ho3+ < Tm3+ < Yb3+. The improved crystallinity give rise to the narrowing of diffraction peaks, and the smaller ion radius of Ln3+ (0.858–1.013 Å) partially substitutes of larger ions radius of Pb2+ (1.190 Å), bringing about the lattice contraction and the shift of diffraction peaks. The smallest ion radius difference between Yb3+ and Pb2+ contributes to the smallest shift. Then, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique was further used to measure the binding energy of different elements in CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ before and after doping, as displayed in Fig. 1c and Fig. S2 (ESI†). Taking the CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ as an example, two additional peaks in CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ are identified, stemming from the characteristic peaks of Yb 4d, proving the existence of Yb3+ in CsPbI2Br. Meanwhile, the binding energy of Pb 4f and I/Br 3d in CsPbI2Br moves to the higher energy side by 0.1 eV, 0.4 eV and 0.3 eV after Yb3+ doping, while remaining unchanged for Cs 3d. It suggests that Yb3+ is successfully incorporated into CsPbI2Br and may replace the Pb2+ sites. The atomic interaction between Yb and I/Br would be stronger than that of Pb and I/Br, conducive to improve the stability of perovskite films.25
Then, the effect of Ln3+ doping on the optical properties of films was further investigated. The absorption spectra of CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ in Fig. S3 (ESI†) display the obvious absorption band, assigned to the excitation absorption.26 As presented in Fig. 1d, the optical bandgaps of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ films extracted from the Tauc plot extrapolation show that the host bandgap gradually increases from 1.76 eV (undoped film) to 1.87 eV (Yb3+), as shown in Table S1 (ESI†). It stems from the lattice contraction induced by Ln3+ doping. Fig. 1e reveals the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Pr3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Eu3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, and Yb3+) films under the excitation of 365 nm. It clearly shows that, compared with the undoped film, the PL intensity after doping is significantly improved. According to the results in Fig. 1e, the PL intensity of CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ is the highest. Fig. 1f exhibits the time-resolved PL spectra, and the lifetimes of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ are significantly prolonged. The average lifetimes of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Pr3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Eu3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, and Yb3+) extracted from the corresponding time-resolved PL spectra are calculated to be 3.62 ns, 8.64 ns, 4.66 ns, 9.98 ns, 3.98 ns, 10.79 ns, 4.11 ns and 14.82 ns, respectively. The improved PL intensity and prolonged lifetimes in CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ are attributed to the improved crystallinity and enlarged grain size after doping.27
Next, the electrical properties of the films in CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ before and after doping were evaluated using the device structure of FTO/CsPbI2Br:Ln3+/Ag (Fig. S4, ESI†). Fig. 2a shows the I–V tests of the CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ films. The conductivity of the films can be expressed as σ, defined as σ = d/AR(1)where A represents the active area of the devices (0.2 × 0.5 cm = 0.1 cm2), d stands for the thickness of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ (d = 500 nm), and R is the resistance of the films. According to eqn (1), the conductivity of the pure CsPbI2Br film is determined to be 5.64 × 10−4 S cm−1, while it increases to 7.81 × 10−4 S cm−1 for CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ (Table S2, ESI†). Fig. 2b displays the Nyquist plots of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and the corresponding equivalent circuit. It can be seen that the carrier recombination resistance (Rrec) after Ln3+ doping gradually becomes larger28 (Table S2, ESI†). They prove that the carrier recombination of the doped film is suppressed, leading to the enhanced charge extraction efficiency. To test our hypothesis, the photo-dark currents in CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ films were obtained under different wavelengths (400 nm, 500 nm, and 600 nm) (Fig. 2c). Benefitting from the improved crystallinity and electrical properties, the photocurrents are obviously enhanced.

(c) Photo-dark current at different wavelengths of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ films. (d and e) J–V curves under dark conditions for the hole-only and electron-only devices of CsPbI2Br:Ln3+. (f) Photocurrent curves of the device before and after doping in the room environment. 
To further estimate the defect density of electrons and holes, the J–V curves based on the hole-only devices with the structure of FTO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbI2Br:Ln3+/TCTA/Ag and electron-only devices with the structure of FTO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br:Ln3+/PC61BM/Ag were measured, respectively (Fig. 2d and e). The trap-state density can be calculated through the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) using eqn (2), described as (2)where Ndefects is the trap-state density, e equals the elementary charge (e = 1.60 × 10−19 C), L is the thickness of perovskite films (∼550 nm), ε represents the relative dielectric constant of perovskite (ε = 35), and ε0 equals the vacuum permittivity (ε0 = 8.85 × 10−12 F m−1).29 According to the VTFL in Fig. 2d and e, the defect-state densities of electrons and holes in the CsPbI2Br film are calculated to be 5.835 × 1015 cm−3 and 1.548 × 1016 cm−3, respectively. They reduce to be 4.059 × 1015 cm−3 and 0.774 × 1016 cm−3 for CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ (Table S2, ESI†). In addition, the devices’ stability based on CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ films were assessed in Fig. 2f. It clearly shows that the stability of photocurrent in CsPbI2Br:Ln3+ after doping significantly improved, compared with the pristine CsPbI2Br film. It should be noted that the photocurrent in CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ is maintained at 92% for at least 15 days in air, while it decreases to 20% of the level for fresh devices for CsPbI2Br film. All of these results show that Ln3+ doping in CsPbI2Br can obviously improve the film quality with good crystallinity and enlarged grain size, and reduce defects and carrier recombination, thereby ameliorating the charge transport performance and making it suitable for optoelectronic devices.
Considering the optimal doping of Yb3+, the effects of different Yb3+ concentrations in CsPbI2Br on the structure, quality, and optoelectronic properties of the films were studied. Fig. 3a–e and Fig. S5 (ESI†) display the SEM images of as-prepared CsPbI2Br:xYb3+ (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3%) films. The average grain size of CsPbI2Br film is 110 nm, which obviously increases to 170 nm, 250 nm and 380 nm accompanied by reduced holes in CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ as the doping concentration of Yb3+ increases from 0.5%, 1% to 2%. With further increasing the doping concentration of Yb3+ (3%), the average grain size shows a slight increase (390 nm). Fig. 3f exhibits the XRD patterns of CsPbI2Br:xYb3+ (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3%) films. All the films exhibit the same cubic phase with CsPbI2Br, and the diffraction peaks gradually shift to larger angles with increasing doping concentration. Such a change is because of the lattice contraction caused by the partial substitution of Pb2+ by Yb3+.30 With the introduction of different concentrations of Yb3+, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of diffraction peaks also changes, and initially becomes narrower, then broader (Table S3, ESI†). Thus, the optimum doping concentration of Yb3+ is 2%. The excessive Yb3+ doping would deteriorate the crystallinity of films.31

(h) PL spectra of CsPbI2Br:xYb3+ films. (i) Time-resolved PL decay curves of CsPbI2Br:xYb3+ (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3%) films. (j) PL spectra of CsPbI2Br:xYb3+ films in air after 5 days. 
The UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of CsPbI2Br:xYb3+ (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 3%) films are presented in Fig. 3g and h. It can be seen that with the increase of Yb3+ doping concentration, the absorption peaks gradually blue-shift from 654 nm to 637 nm. The emission band of CsPbI2Br locates at 668 nm and moves to 647 nm. This can be ascribed to the lattice shrinking after replacing Pb2+ with Yb3+.32 It should be noted that, when the doping concentration increases from 0.5% to 2%, the PL intensity and absorbance intensity of CsPbI2Br:xYb3+ increase continuously. While the doping concentration is 3%, the absorption and PL intensity decrease instead. This is attributed to the changed crystallinity of the film. Fig. 3i exhibits the time-resolved PL lifetimes of CsPbI2Br:xYb3+ (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3%) films. The average lifetimes are 3.62 ns, 6.69 ns, 7.98 ns, 14.82 ns and 3.18 ns. The prolonged lifetimes are attributed to the improved crystallinity, while the reduced lifetimes are due to the decreased crystallinity. To test the stability, the CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ films are exposed to air for seven days and their PL spectra were recorded. And the doped film maintains the same optical properties as before, but the undoped one's declines obviously. Fig S6 (ESI†) proves that both Yb3+ and Yb2+ exist in the doped film, consistent with the previous reports.21,22 Thus, the high stability of doped CsPbI2Br could result from the improved crystallinity and the redox reaction ability of Yb2+–Yb3+ pairs which may continuously oxidize Pb defects and reduce I defects.
Owing to the excellent optical and electrical properties, the CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ films were employed to develop the photodetector. Fig. 4a and Fig. S7 (ESI†) show a 3D schematic diagram and cross-sectional SEM image of the photodetector with the structure of FTO/SnO2/CsPbI2Br:Yb3+/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag (the device effective area is 0.1 cm2). Fig. 4b displays the current–voltage curves of the devices based on CsPbI2Br and CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ films under standard sunlight (air mass 1.5 G illumination) and dark conditions. When the bias voltage c changes from −1 to 1 V, the dark current of the device after Yb3+ doping is smaller. At the 0 V bias, the dark current density of the CsPbI2Br device is 2.4 μA cm−2, which decreases to 1.2 μA cm−2 in the CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ device, attributed to the fewer defect states of the doped perovskite film. Meanwhile, the photocurrent density in the CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ device becomes larger, increasing from 0.22 mA cm−2 to 1 mA cm−2 at 0 bias, which benefits from the enhanced light absorption and carrier charge extraction efficiency (Fig. 1d and 2b). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the photodetectors fabricated by the pristine and the Yb3+-doped CsPbI2Br films is illustrated in Fig. 4c (the light frequency is 70 Hz and the bias is 0 V). It can be seen that both devices achieve a response range from 300 nm to 700 nm. The EQE of the doped device was significantly higher than the undoped device at the wavelength of 350–700 nm. The responsivity (R*) of the device before and after doping was estimated according to EQE, as described in the following formula: (3)where Jph and Ilight stand for the photocurrent density and incident light intensity, respectively.33 As displayed in Fig. S8 (ESI†), the highest R* at 400–650 nm before doping is only 0.08 A W−1, while the Yb3+ doped devices have an average R* of more than 0.1 A W−1, close to commercial silicon photodetectors (0.2 A W−1). We also performed I–V tests on the photodetector under different wavelengths of light at an optical power density of 0.5 mW cm−2, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). It was found that the photocurrents of the doped devices were larger than those before doping when the wavelength is from 400 to 650 nm.

(c) EQE curves of Yb-doped device and undoped device. (d) The noise current curves at different frequency of devices before and after doping. (e) D* of devices before and after doping. (f) Photocurrent curves of the device before and after doping in the room environment. 
Then, we tested the noise current of the device at different frequencies before and after doping, as observed in Fig. 4d. The noise current after doping was much smaller than that after doping at frequencies from 0–2000 Hz. When the frequency is 70 Hz, the original device noise current is 2.8 × 10−11 A Hz−1/2, while the noise current of the doped device is only 4.15 × 10−14 A Hz−1/2 with a reduction of three orders of magnitude. Then, another important parameter of the detector, detectivity (D*), was estimated: (4) (5)where A is the active layer area, in is the noise current, B is the bandwidth, and NEP is the noise equivalent power. As presented in Fig. 4d, compared with the original device, the D* of the doped device enhances by about three orders of magnitude in the wavelength range of 300–700 nm, increasing from the original maximum 3.7 × 109 Jones to 4.6 × 1012 Jones around 440 nm. As shown in Fig. S10 and S11 (ESI†), the response times of the devices before and after doping were obtained, extracting the rise time (trise, the photocurrent increases from 10% to 90% of the peak) and the fall time (tdrop, the photocurrent decreases from 90% to 10% of the peak). The trise and tdrop before and after doping reduce from 729 ns, 1.3 μs to 640 ns, 870 ns, which is close to the two-dimensional perovskite photodetector.34,35 Fig. S12 and S13 (ESI†) further reveal that the performance of the detector after doping is better than that of undoped device under different optical power densities. Compared with inorganic perovskite photodetectors in Table 1, our photodetector based on CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ has higher detectivity and faster response time. Finally, we tested the stability of the devices before and after doping, storing both devices in the atmospheric environment for 15 days, as shown in Fig. 4f. The results show that the performance of the undoped Yb3+ device decreases to 20% of the original performance after 15 days, while maintaining 90% of the original performance after 15 days after Yb3+ doping.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully introduced various Ln3+ (Ln3+ = Pr3+, Gd3+, Nd3+, Eu3+, Tm3+, Ho3+, and Yb3+) ions into the lattices of all-inorganic CsPbI2Br films. After Ln3+ doping, the grain size and crystallinity of perovskite films were dramatically enlarged, resulting in reduced defects, improved charge carrier mobility and air-stability. The highest D* and lowest noise current with excellent air-stability are obtained in CsPbI2Br:Yb3+ based PDs. The D* of 4.6 × 1012 Jones improves by 3 orders of magnitude, and the noise current reduces by 3 orders of magnitude, compared with pristine PDs. This highest performance of PDs after Yb3+ doping arises from the improved film quality and special Yb3+/Yb2+ redox pair. The results demonstrate that Ln3+ doping into the perovskite PDs is one of the most effective strategies to improve device performance and will simulate applications in the fields of optical communication, safety monitoring, and biological sensing.
