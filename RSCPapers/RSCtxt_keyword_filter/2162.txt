    , Accepted 31st October 2014First published on 31st October 2014AbstractHere we report two novel amphiphilic Ru(II) heteroleptic bipyridyl complexes, HD-14 and HD-15, compared to previously reported NCSU-10. We have combined the strong electron donor characteristics of carbazole and the hydrophobic nature of different long alkyl chains, C7, C18 and C2 (NCSU-10), tethered to N-carbazole to study their influence on photocurrent, photovoltage and long term stability for dye-sensitized solar cells. Photon harvesting efficiency and electron donating characteristics of carbazole-based ancillary ligands were found to be unaffected by different alkyl chain lengths. However, a slight drop in the Voc of HD-14 and HD-15 was observed compared to that of NCSU-10. It was found by nanosecond flash photolysis transient absorption (TA) measurements that the faster the dye regeneration the higher the photocurrent density response, and the dye regeneration time was found to be 2.6, 3.6, and 3.7 μs for HD-14, HD-15, and N719 dyes, respectively. The difference in the amplitude of the transient absorption (TA) signal of the oxidized dye as measured by femtosecond TA studies is in excellent agreement with the photocurrent generated, which was in the following order HD-14 > HD-15 > N719. Under 1000 h light soaking conditions, HD-15 maintained up to 98% (only 2% loss) of the initial power conversion efficiency compared to 8% loss for HD-14 and 22% loss in the power conversion efficiency for NCSU-10. HD-15 was strikingly stable to light soaking conditions when employed in the presence of an ionic liquid electrolyte, which paves the way for widespread applications of dye-sensitized solar cells with long term stability. The total power conversion efficiency (η) was 9.27% for HD-14 and 9.17% for HD-15 compared to 8.92% for N719.
1. Introduction
It is unfortunate that to date, most of the current energy demands are met by fossil fuels. To realize the dream of a low carbon society, and ensure the widespread application of renewable energy sources such as solar energy, photovoltaic devices should be highly efficient, cheap and stable for a long time. Solar energy has been recognized as one of the cleanest, most reliable and abundantly available renewable energy sources on the planet Earth.1 Compared to silicon-based single layer p–n junction photovoltaic devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) are promising candidates for an alternative form of solar cells owing to their unique features of being flexible and efficient under year around conditions.2–5 Since the breakthrough report by O'Regan and Grätzel,6 immense research has been carried out to better understand, and improve the fundamental science of this technology. As a result, DSCs with efficiency as high as 13% (η)7 were achieved by a Zn–porphyrin complex. Additionally, perovskite-sensitized solid state dye solar cells have reached a record high efficiency of 15.9%,8 and efficiencies of 17.9% (ref. 9) and 19.3% (ref. 10) were reported recently. However, perovskite solar cells contain Pb and are far behind in long term stability compared to DSCs.10
Owing to the unique nature of DSCs where electron injection, charge transport, and hole carrier are achieved by different components, achieving higher efficiency is dependent on the optimization of the components of the device including a dye (sensitizer), TiO2 and an electrolyte. A sensitizer is one of the most critical components within a DSC; it determines not only the light harvesting efficiency, but also mediates the interaction between the redox shuttle and TiO2.11,12 Thus the chemical nature of the sensitizer not only determines the operational efficiency of DSCs but also sets the standards for long term stability as reported for Ru(II) sensitizers Z-907 (ref. 13) (Fig. 1), Z-907 showed strikingly good long term stability owing to long alkyl chains and a polymer gel electrolyte as a redox shuttle. Z-907 resulted in slightly less (6%) power conversion efficiency owing to the lack of any electron donor group. The lack in efficiency of Z-907 was circumvented by the introduction of electron rich groups such as thiophene for C-103 (ref. 14) and C-104.15 Several groups have reported Ru(II) sensitizers based on carbazole such as CYC-B6L and CYC-B6S,16 JK-142,17 CYC-B13 (ref. 18) (Fig. 1), which showed promising efficiency and long term stability. However, the reported carbazole-based bipyridyl ancillary ligands were complex and synthesized via multistep synthetic routes.
 Fig. 1  Molecular structures of complexes Z-907, JK-142 and CYC-B13. 
Recently, our group reported a very simple yet highly efficient sensitizer NCSU-10 (ref. 19) based on the carbazole bipyridyl ancillary ligand. The corresponding bipyridyl ancillary ligand was synthesized by a one step Knoevenagel type condensation reaction.19–22 The sensitizer employing this ancillary ligand was coded as NCSU-10 and is shown in Fig. 2. Thus carbazole ancillary ligands and long alkyl chains are well known precursors for designing high efficiency Ru(II) sensitizers. However, there are no studies which have reported the effect of long alkyl chains tethered directly to the nitrogen of carbazole on the photophysical, photovoltaic and long term stability properties of Ru(II) sensitizers.

In this study, we have reported a systematic study of combining the strong electron donor characteristics of carbazole and charge recombination suppressing properties of different alkyl chain lengths and their effect on long term stability of DSCs. The main objective was to design sensitizers which are simple to synthesize, highly efficient and show unprecedented long term stability. Impedance spectroscopy was employed to investigate the charges at the interface of the proposed sensitizers while anchored to TiO2. Photovoltaic characterization (I–V curve and IPCE) was carried out on solar cells with and without TBP (tert-butylpyridine) and DCA (deoxycholic acid) as additives to determine the best working conditions for HD-14 and HD-15. The decay of the transient absorption (TA) signal in the nanosecond laser flash photolysis experiment is correlated with dye regeneration, whereas the dynamics of the TA signal for an oxidized dye in femtosecond TA studies is associated with electron injection dynamics. The strategy of tethering a long alkyl chain to N-carbazole resulted in highly efficient sensitizers which outperformed the benchmark N719 in photocurrent density (Jsc), power conversion efficiency and long term stability. A comparison of the effect of the different alkyl chain lengths of C7 (HD-14) and C18 (HD-15) on photocurrent, photophysics, interface properties with TiO2 and long term stability was carried out, and HD-15 was found to be strikingly stable to light soaking conditions when employed in the presence of an ionic liquid electrolyte.
2. Results and discussion
For the synthesis of proposed sensitizers, HD-14 and HD-15, the corresponding N-substituted carbazoles were first synthesized according to the procedure given in the literature.23 Then, the formylation reaction of respective N-substituted carbazole was carried out under Vilsmeier–Hack reaction conditions,24 which resulted in 9-heptyl-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde and 9-octadecyl-9H-carbazole-3-carbaldehyde. The corresponding aromatic aldehydes and 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridyl were reacted in a pressure tube in the presence of excess of chlorotrimethylsilane to produce the corresponding bis-stilbazole in the Knoevenagel condensation type reaction.20 The exact synthetic procedures for the ligands and complexes can be found in the ESI.†
The proposed Ru(II) sensitizers were then synthesized in the typical one pot three step synthetic scheme as given in the ESI.† The yield of the crude products was in the range of 90–95%, which were purified through the Sephadex LH-20 column for three times to get the highly pure product in 50–57% yield. The pure product was then characterized by 1H-NMR, and high resolution mass spectrometry (ESI−). The chemical structures of HD-14, HD-15, NCSU-10 and N719 are depicted in Fig. 2.
2.1. Photophysical measurements
A comparison among the UV-Vis absorption and emission spectra of HD-14, HD-15 and N719, measured in DMF using a concentration of 2 × 10−5 M, is given in Fig. 3 and the results are summarized in Table 1.

Intense MLCT absorption peaks were found for HD-14 and HD-15 at 539 nm with extinction coefficients of 19450 M−1 cm−1 and 23950 M−1 cm−1, respectively, compared to N719 at 529 nm (12800 M−1 cm−1). The introduction of strong electron donating carbazole ancillary ligands resulted in higher molar extinction coefficients of HD-14 and HD-15 compared to N719. Additionally, λmax of the low energy MLCT was also red shifted by up to 10 nm as compared to N719. This effect can be attributed to the extended π-conjugation and a stronger electron donating carbazole ligand, which resulted in the destabilization of the metal-based HOMO (t2g), and that translated into red shifted absorption spectra due to the decreased HOMO–LUMO gap for HD-14–15 compared to that of N719, as shown schematically in the energy level diagram of Fig. 4. Additionally, the incorporation of stronger ancillary ligands for HD-14 and HD-15 resulted in stronger emission than N719 as being previously reported for NCSU-10 and MH11.19,25 Hence, it is expected that under similar conditions and concentration, HD-14 and HD-15 are less prone to radiation-less energy losses through internal conversion and/or intersystem crossing compared to N719.

2.2. Electrochemical measurements
The ground state oxidation potentials (GSOP) of HD-14, HD-15 and NCSU-10 were measured by cyclic voltammetry (CV) in solution and the results are summarized in Table 2. CV voltammograms were used to calculate the oxidation onset which is equivalent to the GSOP (ground state oxidation potential) or the HOMO level of the dye. Additionally, E0–0 was calculated from the onset of the absorption spectrum. The values of E0–0 and the GSOP were used to calculate the ESOP (excited state oxidation potential), the values in volts (V) against NHE were converted to electron volt (eV) by the addition of 4.7 as given in eqn (1). ESOP = [(GSOP (V) + 4.7) − E0–0] eV(1)
The difference in the energy of the ESOP to TiO2 CB has been rationalized as electron injection free energy and the difference in the energy of the GSOP from the redox potential of I3−/I− is the dye regeneration free energy. This interrelationship between the GSOP, ESOP, electron injection and dye regeneration for HD-14, HD-15 and N-719 is summarized in Fig. 4. The GSOP values of −5.45 and −5.48 eV for HD-14, and HD-15, respectively, confirmed that the HOMO level of these dyes is below the I3−/I− redox couple (−5.2 eV),26 and there is enough thermodynamic driving force for efficient dye regeneration. Additionally, the ESOP values of HD-14 and HD-15 were −3.57 and −3.65 eV, respectively, which lay above the conduction band edge of nanocrystalline TiO2 (−4.2 eV).27 Hence, owing to energetically favorable excited states, the efficient electron injection into the CB edge of TiO2 and dye regeneration was achieved using sensitizers HD-14, and HD-15.

2.3. Photovoltaic device characterizations
The photovoltaic performance of complexes HD-14 and HD-15 on the nanocrystalline TiO2 electrode was studied under standard AM 1.5 irradiation (100 mW cm−2) one sun illumination using an electrolyte with the composition of 0.6 M dimethylpropyl-imidazolium iodide (DMPII), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI in acetonitrile. Fig. 5 shows the incident-photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the cells fabricated with complexes HD-14, HD-15 and N719, where the incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) values are plotted as a function of wavelength. NCSU-10 results were reported previously.19

The strong photon harvesting features of the carbazole ancillary ligand translated into impressive quantum efficiency for HD-14 and HD-15. Up to 80% of quantum efficiency was achieved in the plateau region. Higher molar extinction coefficients of HD-14 and HD-15 translated into superior IPCE compared to N719 both in the visible and NIR regions which resulted in higher photocurrent density as given in the I–V curve of Fig. 6. IPCE curves for DSCs employing HD-14 and HD-15 prepared in the presence of 0.5 M TBP and DCA 20 mM are shown in Fig. S15a and b of the ESI.†

The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factors (ff) and overall cell efficiencies (η) are summarized in Table 3. HD-14 and HD-15 showed impressively higher photocurrent density compared to N719 due to extended conjugation, strong electron donating carbazole ancillary ligands, and thermodynamically more favorable ground and excited state properties. I–V results for NCSU-10 were reported previously where El-Shafei et al.19 recognized the carbazole-based ancillary ligand with an ethyl group tethered to N-carbazole being highly efficient for DSCs. By comparing the photocurrent of NCSU-10 (C2), HD-14(C7) and HD-15 (C18), it can be seen that the presence of alkyl chains of different lengths does not considerably affect the photon harvesting efficiency of the carbazole-based ancillary ligands. However, a drop in the Voc values of HD-14 and HD-15 compared to NCSU-10 was observed, which can be attributed to the repellent effect of the long alkyl chain between the HOMO of the dye and the electrolyte, which could hinder the dye regeneration. Furthermore, no improvement in the Voc values of HD-14 and HD-15 was observed despite the large spacing between TiO2 and the electrolyte created by the hydrophobic nature of long alkyl chains, nevertheless improvement in long term stability was anticipated. HD-14 (C7) and HD-15 (C18) showed similar Voc, which contradicts the previous report of collapsed C18.29

In order to determine the best working conditions for HD-14 and HD-15, a systematic study was designed to study the effect of TBP (tert-butylpyridine) and DCA (deoxycholic acid). TBP is well known for its effect on suppressing the recombinations of injected electrons with I3− in the electrolyte. TBP causes a negative increase in the conduction band edge of TiO2, due to its basicity.30–32 Similarly DCA as a coadsorber can be added to the dye solution upon dye adsorption to achieve TiO2 surface passivation in order to suppress the recombination reactions (dark current). Coadsorbers are believed to assist in the favorable packing of the dye by covering the spaces between dye molecules. However, coadsorbers have been reported to decrease the dye loading up to 60% (ref. 33) which can significantly lower the photocurrent density, such a decrease in dye loading in the presence of DCA (20 mM) was not observed for HD-14 and HD-15 based on the IPCE response as given in Fig. S15 (ESI†).
The effect of TBP and DCA alone and in combination on photovoltaic characteristics of HD-14 and HD-15 is summarized in Table 3 and shown in Fig. S15 and S16 (ESI†) for IPCE and I–V results.
The effect of TBP alone is more prominent on HD-15 as compared to HD-14, upon decreasing Jsc. Since the LUMO of HD-15 is at −3.65 eV compared to −3.57 eV (more free energy) for HD-14 (Fig. 4), the drop in Jsc of HD-15 following the addition of TBA is due to the small electron injection free energy of HD-15 compared to that of HD-14. In contrast, Jsc of HD-14 increased by 0.04 mA cm−2 upon the addition of DCA and that of HD-15 decreases by 0.81 mA cm−2. Similarly, the presence of both TBP (0.5 M) and DCA (20 mM) in dye solution during the adsorption onto TiO2 resulted in an increase in Voc from 0.586 V to 0.687 V for HD-14, with a considerable increase in η% from 8.02 to 9.27. For HD-15, Voc increased from 0.557 V to 0.679 V, upon increasing η% from 7.27 to 9.17. Comparatively, a greater change was observed in Jsc as compared to Voc in the presence of both TBP and DCA. For HD-14, it decreased from 20.62 mA cm−2 to 18.71 mA cm−2 with a total decrease of 1.91 mA cm−2. Under similar conditions, the total decrease was 2.38 mA cm−2 for HD-15 from 20.88 mA cm−2 to 18.50 mA cm−2. The reasons for this decrease are the same as discussed above.
2.4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization
EIS is a powerful tool for characterizing the interfacial charge transfer process at TiO2/electrolyte and pt/electrolyte in DSCs. A combination of charge tranfer resistance and chemical capacitance gives rise to a semicirle at the complex plan. In a typical EIS experiment, the first semicircle at high frequency corresponds to the cathode in a DSC, the middle semicircle corresponds to charge transfer resistance at the interface of dye/TiO2 combined with the chemical capacitance of electrons in TiO2 (eTiO2), and the third semicircle corresponds to the finite Warburg impedance element.34 In the Nyquist plot (Fig. 7), the middle frequency semicirles were in the following order of increased charge recombination resistance N719 > NCSU-10 > HD-14 > HD-15, which was in the order of the actual photovoltage obtained from the corresponding solar devices. Thus, the higher the charge recombination resistance in the Nyquist plot, the higher the photovoltage obtained from solar cells owing to a slower charge recobination of electrons in TiO2 (eTiO2) and electron acceptors in the electrolyte, resulting in higher eTiO2 lifetime.35–37
 Fig. 7  EIS Nyquist plots for DSCs sensitized with HD-14, HD-15, N719 and NCSU-10. 
In Fig. 8, the frequency response in the range of 1–100 Hz indicates the recombination of eTiO2 with the electrolyte as the function of eTiO2 lifetime. The injected electron lifetime eTiO2 can be determined by using the relation (τCB = 1/(2πf)), where τ is the lifetime of electrons in TiO2 and f is the mid-frequency peak in the Bode plots. eTiO2 depends on the density of charge traps, which is ultimately related to Voc. In other words, the Bode plot results complement the Nyquist plot. The frequency peaks of the DSCs in the range of 1–100 Hz based on HD-14, HD-15, NCSU-10 and N719 were at 35 Hz, 35 Hz, 31 Hz and 20 Hz, corresponding to eTiO2 of 4.5 ms, 4.5 ms, 5.0 ms and 8 ms, respectively, thus resulting in lower Voc for HD-14 and HD-15 compared to N719 and NCSU-10, which correlates well with the actual Voc reported for the solar cells (Table 3). A similar trend was also observed in the Nyquist plots (Fig. 7).
 Fig. 8  EIS Bode plots for DSCs sensitized with HD-14, HD-15, N719 and NCSU-10. 
A long alkyl chain can suppress the dye aggregation on the TiO2 film during the dye uptake process and can improve the device efficiency. Such an improvement is mainly observed in the planar structures e.g., organic dyes. In the case of Ru-based (octahedral) small size dyes, like N719, dye aggregation is not so strong and a compact monolayer on the TiO2 film can form easily, resulting in a long electron lifetime. One possible reason for the short lifetime of HD-14 and HD-15 based DSCs can be attributed to the bulkiness of the dye molecule, thus hindering the diffusion of the dye into the narrow pores of the mesoporous TiO2 film leading to incomplete monolayer formation, which increases the recombination of conduction band electrons back to the electrolyte.
2.5. Long-term stability testing
A prolonged exposure of solar cells to light is inevitable, thus in order for DSCs to be practically viable, long term stability to irradiation is a must have feature. Usually DSCs are declared to pass such a stability test if they retain up to 90% of their initial values after the test.38–41 The long term stability of a DSC greatly depends on the sensitizer, the type of electrolyte and the sealing method. Over an extended period of time, several kinds of mechanisms can lead to the degradation of solar cells, such mechanisms have been discussed in detail somewhere else.41–44 According to Grätzel,42 for a sensitizer to be stable for 20 years, it should be stable for one hundred million turnovers. Sensitizer Z-907 (ref. 13) is widely known for its long term stability owing to the incorporation of long hydrophobic alkyl chains.
In a long term stability test, 1-methylbenzimidazole (MBI) was used instead of 4-terbutyl pyridine, since the latter has been identified to increase the rate of replacement reactions of NCS,45,46 whereas 3-methodxypropionitrile (MPN) as a solvent has been found to be stable with N719 and Z-907 for such long term stability tests.47 Thus, by minimizing the catalytic factors for sensitizer degradation, the intrinsic stability of the complexes to irradiation can be estimated.
The long term stability test of HD-14, HD-15, and NCSU-10 based DSCs was carried out under 1 sun light soaking conditions using a 420 nm cut-off filter for 1000 h and the normalized results are shown in Fig. 9. At time zero, the HD-14 based solar device with an ionic liquid electrolyte resulted in Jsc of 16.1 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.69 V, FF of 0.72, and η of 7.9%. A slight increase in Jsc and η of the devices was observed after one week, which can be attributed13 to the self-assembly of long alkyl chains or more efficient dye regeneration due to the penetration of the electrolyte into the hidden cavities of HD-15 and HD-14, whereas such a change was marginal in the case of NCSU-10.

A 420 nm cut-off filter was applied during illumination. Ionic-liquid electrolyte: 0.15 M I2, 0.1 M GuSCN, 0.5 M MBI, and 1 M PMII in MPN at 25 °C. 
The device based on HD-15 (C18) outperformed HD-14 (C7) and NCSU-10 (C2) in terms of photostability. HD-15 was extraordinarily stable in Jsc as it maintained up to 100% of its initial value, compared to 4–5% loss in Jsc for HD-14 and up to 20% loss in Jsc for NCSU-10. HD-15 and HD-14 maintained Voc up to 98% of the initial value with slightly more loss in Voc for NCSU-10. The loss in FF was less than 3% for all the sensitizers. HD-15 maintained 98% of the initial conversion efficiency value compared to 92% of HD-14 and 78% of NCSU-10. Thus the long alkyl chains help keeping the sensitizer intact even after 1000 h light soaking. We attribute the stabilizing effect of long alkyl chains to the formation of a compact molecular monolayer on the TiO2 surface which prevents desorption of the dye. Similarly this monolayer also prevents moisture and other impurities to influence the operation of DSCs at the TiO2 surface.
2.6. Nanosecond laser flash photolysis and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy
Nanosecond laser flash photolysis spectroscopy was employed to study the dye regeneration. In this experiment, we studied the decay of transient absorption spectra of HD-14, HD-15 and N719 dye-sensitized TiO2 and the results are shown in Fig. 10(a) without an electrolyte and Fig. 10(b) with an electrolyte. In the absence of an electrolyte, the decay of the absorption signal reflects the dynamics of the recombination of injected electrons with the oxidized dye. The decay profiles were fitted by a stretched exponential and the recombination time for injected electrons was found to be 11.3, 9.1 and 6.9 μs for N719, HD-14 and HD-15, respectively. Moser and Grätzel48 have reported that recombination kinetics between TiO2 injected electrons and the oxidative dye is therefore expected to lie in the Marcus inverted region (which dictates the back electron transfer in organic photovoltaic devices) where electron transfer is thermally activated and an increase in the driving force should lead to a decrease in the transfer rate constant. Here, we showed that increasing recombination kinetics rates 11.3, 9.1 and 6.9 μs for N719, HD-14 and HD-15, respectively, were not exactly affected by differences in the driving force (see Fig. 4) such as N719 has a lower driving force but still a lower recombination kinetic rate.
 Fig. 10  Transient decay profiles of HD-14, HD-15, and N719 while anchored onto TiO2 (a) without the electrolyte and (b) with the electrolyte. 
In a separate investigation, Meyer et al.49 showed that the driving forces for similar types of dyes hardly affect the recombination kinetics, and it was proposed that the kinetics were determined by diffusion-limited encounters between electrons in TiO2 and oxidized dye molecules.
In the presence of an electrolyte, the decay profile represents the dye regeneration through the oxidation of I−. The fitting of the decay profiles observed for the transient absorption signal in the presence of an electrolyte resulted in regeneration times equal to 2.6, 3.6, and 3.7 μs for HD-14, HD-15, and N719 dyes, respectively. Kinetically, dye regeneration is faster than the recombination of injected electrons with an oxidized dye (without an electrolyte) if we ignore the effect of an electrolyte on the recombination of injected electrons to the oxidized dye. The rate for dye regeneration (HD-14 > HD-15 > N719) was found to be in the same order of photocurrent density generated from devices employing HD-14, HD-15 and N719 as was reported previously50 for Ru(II) sensitizers.
To understand how the alkyl chain length on the carbazole ligand affects the charge injection, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) was performed on HD-14 and HD-15 and the results were compared with the benchmark dye N719 under similar experimental conditions. TAS graphs for HD-14, HD-15 and N719 are shown in Fig. 11 and 12. The spectra of all three dyes (Fig. 11) show ground state bleaching (GSB) spectral features at a wavelength of less than 600 nm (>2 eV), which has increased transmission, as well as a photo-induced absorption (PIA) band greater than 600 nm, which has decreased transmission. The PIA band is responsive to the charge separation dynamics as it probes the oxidized dye (dye+), the excited state dye (dye*), and the injected electrons in the conduction band of TiO2 (eTiO2), as reported previously.51–58

 Fig. 12  Transient absorption spectra at τ = 0 ps and τ = 500 ps of HD-14 (a) and HD-15 (b) with the electrolyte. 

Fig. 12, shows the transient absorption signal for HD-14 and HD-15 individually with delay times of 0 ps and 500 ps and it clearly shows the absorption features of GSB (<600 nm) and PIA for dye* (660 nm) and dye+ (760) similar to that shown in Fig. 11.
We compared the charge injection by monitoring the amplitude of the TA signal at 760 nm which corresponds to the absorption of the oxidized dye (dye+) after excitation at 530 nm. Fig. 13 shows the oxidized dye (dye+) dynamics of the three samples in the TiO2/dye/electrolyte DSC structure. The dynamics of the three samples without the electrolyte is given in Fig. S18 (ESI†). In Fig. 13, the comparison of the kinetics at 760 nm between the three dyes clearly shows a difference in charge injection. The dynamics in all three DSC structures exhibits a sharp, fast component (<1 ps) due to singlet injection. However, N719 shows a second slow rise component which can be attributed to triplet injection, whereas HD-15 remains flat after ∼1 ps and HD-14 has a slight decay. The dynamics at 760 nm became flat after 500 ps in all three DSCs. We compared the amplitude of the TA signal after 1000 ps and found that HD-14 and HD-15 based DSCs have the signals ∼1.71 and ∼1.59 times higher than that of N719. On the other hand, photocurrent densities obtained from cells (Table 3) for HD-14 and HD-15 are ∼1.12 and ∼1.10 times higher than that of N719. We found that the amplitude of the TA signal of the oxidized dye, which corresponds to the injection efficiency, correlates well with the photocurrent density and as a result to the solar cell total conversion efficiency.

3. Conclusions
It can be concluded on the basis of this study that carbazole-based ancillary ligands have a great potential to be employed using a simple molecular design strategy based on different alkyl chain lengths to enhance the long term stability and photon harvesting efficiency of the sensitizers, which ultimately translates into a higher molar extinction coefficient and overall greater photocurrent response of the solar device. Cyclic voltammetry results showed that the novel sensitizers HD-14 and HD-15 offer more thermodynamic free energy for electron injection into TiO2 as compared to N719. This fine tuning of optical and photophysical properties resulted in up to 20% higher photocurrent response for HD-14 and HD-15 compared to N719. The strategy for tethering long alkyl chains to N-carbazole resulted in a solar-to-power conversion efficiency (η%) of 9.27 for HD-14 and 9.17 for HD-15 against 8.92 of N719 and enhanced long term stability, under similar conditions. HD-15 showed strikingly good long term light soaking stability and maintained up to 98% of its initial value compared to 92% for HD-14 and 78% for NCSU-10. Thus, it can be concluded that longer alkyl chains such as C18 in the case of HD-15 can be utilized efficiently without hampering the electron injection and dye regeneration as shown by femtosecond and laser flash photolysis spectroscopy. It was found from laser flash photolysis transient absorption spectroscopy experiments for dye regeneration that the dye regeneration of HD-15 (3.6 μs) is slower than that of HD-14 (2.6 μs) likely due to the spatial effect generated by C18 chains between the dye and the electrolyte. Thus a slightly lower Voc of HD-15 compared to that of HD-14 can be rationalized on the basis of slower dye regeneration and shorter eTiO2 as found by impedance measurements. This work clearly shows the benefit of having long alkyl chains in the heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizer on strong electron donor carbazole groups in terms of long term stability, paving the way for the widespread application of highly efficient and durable DSCs.
