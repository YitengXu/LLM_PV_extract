    , Accepted 1st December 2014First published on 23rd December 2014AbstractHybrid organic/inorganic perovskite solar cells are among the most competitive emerging photovoltaic technologies. Here, we report on NiO-based inverted structure perovskite solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency of 10.68%, which is achieved by adding a small percentage (1.5 wt%) of high molecular weight polystyrene (PS) into the PCBM electron transport layer (ETL). The addition of PS facilitates the formation of a highly smooth and uniform PCBM ETL that is more effective in preventing undesirable electron–hole recombination between the perovskite layer and the top electrode. As a result, the VOC of the PCBM:PS-based cells is increased from 0.97 V to 1.07 V, which leads to significantly enhanced power conversion efficiencies of the solar cells. Our study provides a simple and low-cost approach to improving the ETL film quality and the performance of inverted perovskite solar cells.
Hybrid organic/inorganic halide perovskite solar cells have attracted much research attention due to their superb and rapidly improving performance.1–5 The power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of these lead halide perovskite photovoltaic cells have increased to above 15% for both planar and hetero-junction cells,6,7 with a high PCE of 17.9% for hetero-junction cells certified by Newport8 and a PCE of 19.3% reported for planar junction cells recently.9 The general formula of perovskites used in our study is described as ABX3, in which X is an anion (such as Cl−, Br− and I−) and A and B are CH3NH3 and Pb respectively.10–12 Perovskite solar cells offer several attractions such as strong absorption coefficients, easy fabrication, appropriate direct band gaps, high carrier mobilities, and exceptionally long charge carrier diffusion lengths.13–15
Perovskite solar cells consist of a halide perovskite absorber layer sandwiched between the electron and hole transport layers that are in contact with their corresponding electrodes.16 There are two types of perovskite solar cell structures (conventional or inverted structure) depending upon the relative positions of the electron and hole transport layers. While the conventional structure can be obtained by coating the electron transport layer onto the bottom transparent conducting glass followed by the successive coating of the perovskite and hole transport layers, the inverted structure is obtained by simply inverting the positions of the electron and hole transport layers.17–20 Although the conventional structure has produced the highest PCEs, there is tremendous interest in developing inverted structure perovskite solar cells for both fundamental and practical reasons including the need to use such a structure for constructing tandem cells.21,22
In inverted structure perovskite solar cells, PEDOT:PSS or p-type NiO are commonly used for the hole transport layer, while phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) is often used as the electron transport layer. Recently, we reported an inverted planar perovskite solar cell using a relatively rough NiO nanocrystal layer as the hole transport layer and a typical PCBM as the electron transport layer.23 The relatively rough nature of the NiO layer is found to be beneficial for hole extraction and for perovskite film formation. Regarding the electron transport layer, it is important to obtain a uniform and pin-hole free PCBM layer that can minimize film defects and thus undesirable electron–hole recombination between the perovskite layer and the current collecting electrode. For this reason, there have been efforts to improve the processing techniques of the PCBM layer such as optimizing spin-coating speeds and solvents. Yet it is still challenging to form a high quality PCBM thin film on the relatively rough perovskite surface, in part because the small molecule PCBM solution for spin-coating is not sufficiently viscous and thus lacks the robust film forming property of polymer solutions.
In this paper, we improve the film forming property of PCBM by adding a small percentage (1.5 wt% by weight) of polystyrene (PS)24 into the PCBM solution. It is found that the addition of PS not only improves the ETL film uniformity, but also decreases the recombination of electron–hole pairs in the ETL layer. These positive effects lead to improved perovskite solar cell performance with the PCE being increased from 9.56% to 10.68%.
The photovoltaic device with a typical p–i–n sandwich structure is depicted in Fig. 1A, and the energy levels of all layers in a cell are shown in Fig. 1B. From the energy diagram, there is little potential difference between the conduction band (CB) edge of the perovskite layer and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PCBM layer, with both values being −3.9 eV. The valence band (VB) edge (−5.5 eV) and the Fermi level (Ef) (−5.36 eV) of NiO are also very close to the VB edge of CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx. A reasonably good match between the energy levels of the hole and electron transport layers and the VB and CB edges of the perovskite layer is important to minimizing open circuit voltage (VOC) loss. The energy levels of the PCBM ETL are not changed by the addition of the insulating polymer (polystyrene), which has been confirmed by the similar peaks in the UV-Vis absorption spectra (Fig. S2†) and cyclic voltammograms (Fig. S3†) of the PCBM films with or without PS. Fig. 1C shows a representative scanning electron microscopy (SEM) cross-sectional image of the solar cell device. The NiO NC layer was synthesized through a sol–gel process within a nickel(II) acetylacetonate precursor. The well-crystallized mixed halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx) film was prepared via a spin-coating process from a precursor solution of CH3NH3I and PbCl2 (3:1 molar ratio) in DMF and then heated on a hotplate at 100 °C for ∼1 h. The detailed chemical reaction mechanism has been discussed in our recent paper.25 Next, a thick perovskite (CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx) film (∼400 nm) was deposited on the NiO NC layer (∼40 nm), followed by the deposition of a ∼50 nm thick PCBM:PS blend film. The total thickness of the cell is ∼900 nm including a 300 nm thick F:SnO2 conducting layer. A top-section SEM image (Fig. S1†) shows that the PCBM:PS blend solution forms a highly uniform and smooth ETL on the surface of the perovskite layer. The PS additive clearly has beneficial effects including improved ETL film coverage onto perovskite – with lower roughness and less photocurrent leakage – and thus lower extent of charge carrier recombination, which will be discussed below.

The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) characteristics (under AM 1.5G irradiation at 100 mW cm−2) of the cells with and without PS additives are shown in Fig. 2A. The detailed performance parameters of these perovskite solar cells are summarized in Table 1. Without the small amount of PS additives, that is, with pure PCBM as the electron transport layer, the cell achieved about 9.56% power conversion efficiency (PCE), with a short-circuit photocurrent (JSC) of 15.91 mA cm−2, an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.97 V and a fill factor (FF) of 0.62. As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2, the addition of 1.5 wt% PS increased the VOC to 1.07 V and the FF to 0.64, and led to a PCE of 10.68%, which represents a significant 11% increase in PCEs over the pure PCBM-based cell. This efficiency increase can be mainly attributed to the increase of the VOC. We also examined the device performance statistics (PCE and VOC) for cells with and without the PS additive. The respective PCE and VOC distributions are shown in Fig. 2C–F. According to our statistics, the average efficiency of pure PCBM-based cells is 6.8%, which increased to 7.9% for the PCBM:PS-based based cells. The average of VOC increased from 0.91 V to 1.02 V upon the addition of 1.5% PS into PCBM. The VOC and PCE improvements can be attributed to the better coverage of the PCBM:PS film onto the perovskite film. Although PS is an insulating polymer, the addition of a very low weight percentage of PS appears to improve perovskite cell performance without negatively affecting the electron transport property of PCBM. However, when the amount of PS additive is increased from 1.5 wt% to 6 wt% (weight percentage versus the weight of PCBM), both VOC and JSC decrease dramatically to 0.86 V and 10.90 mA cm−2, respectively. As a result, the efficiency of perovskite cells based on the 6 wt% PS additive is only 5.72%. These results are reasonable because the additive is a high molecular weight (MW ∼ 1 M) insulating polymer. An excessive amount of PS additive would detrimentally affect the electron transport ability of the ETL, and thus reduce all performance parameters including VOC, JSC and FF. The incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra in Fig. 2B show an onset of around 800 nm, and appear to be dominated by the CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx absorption. The JSC obtained by integration of the IPCE spectra agrees well with the JSC obtained from the J–V measurement, (Fig. 2B), which attests to the consistency of our solar cell measurements.

To gain more insights into the PCBM:PS films, we used atomic force microscopy (AFM) to examine the impact of the PS additive on the film property of the PCBM layer. The 10 μm × 10 μm AFM images of PCBM films (with or without PS) coated on the CH3NH3PbCl3−xIx perovskite film are shown in Fig. 3. By comparing the images of pure PCBM (Fig. 3A1), PCBM:1.5 wt% PS (Fig. 3B1) and PCBM:6 wt% PS (Fig. 3C1), it can be seen that the spin-coated film of pure PCBM exhibits a much rougher surface than PCBM:PS films. Small pinholes could be observed in the pure PCBM layer. These pinholes are formed during the spin-coating process of small molecular weight PCBM, the solution of which has low viscosity and thus makes it difficult to form a smooth surface. Upon the addition of a high molecular weight polymer, it becomes easier for PCBM to form a high quality and smooth film. The differences in film roughness can be clearly seen from the cross-section line profiles shown in Fig. 3A2–C2. Compared with the pure PCBM film (Fig. 3A2), the PCBM:PS films exhibit smaller peak to valley modulations. The height difference between the highest and lowest point in the pure PCBM film is about 8 nm, however, only about 1 nm to 2 nm for the PCBM:1.5 and 6 wt% PS films (Fig. 3B2). The smoother films indicate that the addition of PS increases the viscosity of PCBM solution and helps to form a homogeneous film. The improvement of VOC from 0.97 V to 1.07 V can be explained by the better coverage of PCBM films and the resulting enhanced hole blocking ability and decreased leakage current at the interfaces between the perovskite, PCBM layer and the top electrode. When the ratio of PCBM:PS increased to 6 wt%, however, the VOC and JSC dropped dramatically, which is due to the significantly reduced electron transport ability of the PCBM:PS stemming from the excessive addition of the insulating PS (Fig. S4 and Table S1†).

To understand the electron recombination characteristics of the cells, open-circuit photovoltage decay characteristics of various cells with or without PS were also measured. Here, the cell open-circuit photovoltage was monitored as a function of time starting from the illuminated steady-state equilibrium to the dark equilibrium. Due to the recombination of the excess electrons, the open-circuit photovoltage would decay, providing information about the electron lifetime in the cell. In Fig. 4A, the time profiles of VOC for cells with PCBM or PCBM:PS ETLs show a significantly slower photovoltage decay for the cell with PCBM:PS ETL than the pure PCBM cell. Comparing the cells with different amounts of PS additive, the 1.5 wt% PS additive has a slower decay rate than the 6 wt% PS additive. Furthermore, we calculated the electron lifetime τr, which can be derived from Fig. 4A. Here the electron lifetime τr can be calculated from the following equation: (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, e is the electron charge, and dVOC/dt is the derivative of the open-circuit photovoltage transient. The electron lifetimes extracted from the open-circuit photovoltage decay data are presented in Fig. 4B as a function of open-circuit photovoltage. Although the PCBM:6 wt% PS-based cell exhibits a longer electron life time than the cell based on pure PCBM, the excessive addition of PS increases the series resistance and decreases the electron mobility of the ETL (Table S1†), which then led to decreased FF and JSC (Table 1), Overall, an approximate exponential increase in the electron lifetime can be recognized with decreasing photovoltage. Most importantly, the increase of electron lifetime for cells with the PS additive indicates a lower charge recombination rate and higher charge collection efficiency compared to the cells without the PS additive. These results can be explained by the best quality of PCBM:PS films on the halide perovskite layer.

In summary, a small percentage (1.5 wt%) of high molecular weight polystyrene is added into the PCBM electron transport layer of an inverted perovskite solar cell, which led to significant improvements of VOC (from 0.97 to 1.07 V) and thus PCE from 9.56% to 10.68%. The AFM images show that the PCBM:PS layer provides better ETL coverage onto the perovskite, which results in a lower charge carrier recombination rate and longer electron lifetime as revealed by our photovoltage decay measurement. This study provides a simple and effective approach to improve the performance of perovskite solar cells based on small molecular weight electron or hole transport layers such as PCBM or spiro-OMeTAD.
