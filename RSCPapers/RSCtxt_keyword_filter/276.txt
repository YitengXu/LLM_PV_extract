    , Accepted 25th April 2023First published on 27th April 2023AbstractTwo-dimensional (2D) Dion–Jacobson (DJ) halide perovskites are being intensively investigated owing to their superior stability compared with 2D Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) perovskites. Although various organic cations have been reported to form 2D DJ perovskites, their structure–property relationships are rarely studied. In this work, two novel organic cations MDAN (4,4′-methylenedianilinium) and EDAN (4,4′-ethylenedianilinium) were applied to form quasi-2D DJ perovskites with nominal layer number n = 6. An (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl based inverted solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2%, outperforms the 9.6% PCE achieved by a (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl based device. The formation of quasi-2D perovskites with high-n values was observed for both compounds, while the superior performance is demonstrated by the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl based device, which could be attributed to its better film morphology and lower defect density. Intriguingly, we found that EDAN based quasi-2D perovskites were evenly distributed in the film while MDAN based quasi-2D perovskites concentrated near the film surface, accounting for an unfavorable electronic band alignment of the latter. Both (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films remained unchanged in air with 50% relative humidity for 20 days. This work not only presents a decent device performance, but also explores understanding of tuning morphology towards high-efficiency quasi-2D Dion–Jacobson perovskite solar cells.
1 Introduction
Since the early part of this century, research on organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) has entered a stage of astonishing growth in photovoltaic applications, owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties including a suitable bandgap, long carrier diffusion length, high carrier mobility, and low exciton binding energy.1–4 In recent years, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OIHP based solar cells have exceeded 25%, which is comparable to those of state-of-the-art silicon solar cells.5,6 Despite the great success achieved by perovskite solar cells, their inherent instability to moisture, heat and light hinders commercialization progress.7,8
Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites emerged as an alternative light-absorbing material which possesses much higher ambient stability compared to conventional three-dimensional (3D) perovskites. Structurally speaking, 2D perovskite formation can be regarded as the intercalation of large organic cations into a 3D perovskite lattice, forming periodic organic–inorganic stacks and multiple quantum well structures. Benefitting from the hydrophobic organic moiety, 2D perovskites are protected from the intrusion of water and oxygen at the molecular level.9 The organic moiety could also passivate surface defect sites and block the ion migration process, further enhancing the stability of 2D perovskite solar cells.
Currently, 2D perovskites that are used in solar cells could be classified into three categories: the Ruddlesden–Popper (RP) type,10–12 Dion–Jacobson (DJ) type,13–15 and rare alternating cations in the interlayer space (ACI) type.16,17 2D DJ perovskites have a chemical formula of (A′) An−1PbnI3n+1 (A′ is a divalent organic cation and n defines the layer number of the perovskite sheets). We consider n = 1 as pure 2D perovskites, n > 1 as quasi-2D perovskites and n = ∞ as 3D perovskites.18,19 We also define n = 2–5 as low-n quasi-2D perovskites and n ≥ 6 as high-n quasi-2D perovskites.20,21 2D DJ perovskites are considered to be stabler than 2D RP perovskites due to their rigid crystal structure and the elimination of the van der Waals gap between monoammonium cations. There are already plentiful reports demonstrating the high stability of DJ type perovskite solar cells.14,22 Can Li et al. compared 1,3-propanediamine (PDA) based 2D DJ perovskites with propylamine (PA) based 2D RP perovskites, and found remarkable air, thermal and light stability of the former.23 In another case, Yonghua Chen et al. fabricated 1,4-butanediamine (BDA) and butylamine (BA) based 2D perovskites; the BDA based DJ perovskite achieved higher PCE and showed improved ambient stability over its butylamine (BA) based RP counterpart.24
At present, considerable PCEs have been achieved by 2D DJ perovskite solar cells;14 however they are still lagging behind those of state-of-the-art 3D perovskite solar cells.25 Besides the lower theoretical Shockley–Queisser limit determined using the higher bandgap,26 the insulating nature of organic spacers leads to anisotropic charge transport and low charge conductivity vertical to the inorganic sheets.27 A straightforward strategy is to reduce the ratio of the organic cations by forming quasi-2D perovskites with large layer number n. 2D perovskites with higher n values have smaller exciton binding energy, higher charge mobility and smaller bandgaps which are beneficial for the performance of devices, but at the cost of harming stability.28,29
Controlling the morphology and crystallographic orientation of perovskite films is another effective way to achieve better charge transport and less defect induced loss, given that 2D perovskite films generally have small grain sizes with large defect density. For example, researchers used multiple types of additives such as NH4Cl, methylammonium chloride (MACl) and NH4SCN to assist highly oriented crystallization of perovskite films, which can effectively reduce film defects and improve the charge transfer performance of perovskite films.30–33
Although varied organic spacers were used to fabricate 2D DJ perovskites, studies on the influence of their structures on device performance are still rare. Among the few reports, Mercouri G. Kanatzidis et al.34 applied two organic cations 3AMPY (3-(aminomethyl)pyridinium)/4AMPY (4-(aminomethyl)pyridinium) to 2D DJ perovskites. (3AMPY)(MA)3Pb4I13 exhibited smaller interlayer spacing, which could decrease the dielectric mismatch between the inorganic layer and the organic spacer, contributing to its higher power conversion efficiency of 9.20%. Ziqi Liang et al.35 also compared a series of cations in which the ammonium groups take different o, m, and p-positions and found that asymmetric cations could compress inorganic octahedra with small interlayer spacing which decreased the exciton binding energy and increased the carrier transporting ability. Furthermore, the importance of quasi-2D phase distribution in polycrystalline films in determining their photoelectronic properties was also underexplored.
In our work, two novel organic cations namely MDAN (4,4′-methylenedianilinium) and EDAN (4,4′-ethylenedianilinium) (chemical structures are displayed in Scheme S1†) were applied to form quasi-2D DJ perovskites with a nominal n value of 6. The highest PCEs of 9.65% and 13.2% were achieved by (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl based devices respectively. Despite that low-n quasi-2D perovskites were not observed in both films and the MDAN based perovskite film possessed higher crystallinity with large grain size, the better morphology and lower defect density of the EDAN based film account for its better device performance. In addition, the depth profile of (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl revealed deviated quasi-2D perovskite distributions in films. The quasi-2D perovskites were distributed evenly in the EDAN based film, while concentrated near the surface in the MDAN based film which introduced unfavorable electronic band alignment for charge transport and extraction. The higher formation energy of (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19 obtained by theoretical calculations may lead to different crystallization dynamics accounting for such a deviation. Lastly, the high ambient stability of both quasi-2D DJ perovskites was evidenced by the unchanged film in air with 50% relative humidity for 20 days.
2 Results and discussion
In order to test the performance of MDAN/EDAN as an organic spacer for quasi-2D DJ perovskite solar cells, devices with inverted architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/quasi-2D perovskite/PC61BM/bathocuproine (BCP)/Ag were fabricated as shown in Fig. 1a. We chose a relatively high nominal layer number n of 6 to achieve the highest power conversion efficiency while maintaining a high stability comparable with lower-n quasi-2D perovskites. We also used methylammonium chloride (MACl) as an additive to optimize the crystallographic orientation and morphology of perovskite films as suggested by previous reports.31,33 The optimized device performance was achieved when 15 wt% of MACl was added for both (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 based devices. The current density versus voltage (J–V) curves and the device parameters of the devices with different MACl contents are shown in Fig. S1, Tables S1 and S2,† respectively. Under simulated AM 1.5G solar radiation, the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl champion device demonstrated a PCE of 9.65%, with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.02 V, a current density (JSC) of 18.92 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 49.9%. The (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl champion device exhibited a superior PCE of 13.2%, with a VOC of 1.09 V, a JSC of 20.56 mA cm−2 and an FF of 58.7%. The J–V curves of these champion devices are shown in Fig. 1b. The integrated current densities of the (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl devices were further verified by their external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) as shown in Fig. S2.†Fig. 1c shows the JSC and output efficiencies measured at the maximum power point, which remained stable in a time interval of 200 s. The statistical PCE distribution violin plots of (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl devices are displayed in Fig. 1d, showing the reproducibility of the devices.

The cross-sectional SEM images of the quasi-2D DJ perovskite solar cells are shown in Fig. 2a. The perovskite layers exhibited layer thicknesses of ∼390 nm and ∼400 nm for (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl respectively and demonstrated more compact and uniform grains for the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film.

The successful incorporation of MDAN and EDAN molecules was first evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. 2b, new characteristic N 1s peaks emerged at ∼399 eV for both (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films alongside the peaks at ∼402 eV for pristine perovskites, showing the existence of additional aniline groups. The binding energies of Pb 4f and I 3d peaks shifted to lower values (Fig. S3a and b†), which suggests that the incorporation of MDAN and EDAN increased the electron density on Pb and I atoms probably through formation of quasi-2D phases. It is worth noticing that the Pb0 4f peaks were observed for the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film but absent for the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film, suggesting more defect sites of iodide or cationic vacancies in the former one.36 In addition, the signal corresponding to the Cl element in the film was not detected in (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films (Fig. S3c†), indicating that excess MACl volatilized in the process of thermal annealing.37
To prove that quasi-2D perovskite phases were formed by adding MDAN/EDAN, the as cast (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) experiments and are compared in Fig. 2c. The two characteristic peaks with 2θ values of 14.2° and 28.4° for both (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl are very similar to the diffraction peaks of (111) and (202) crystal planes in 3D MAPbI3,38 indicating the formation of inorganic layers of quasi-2D/3D perovskites. In the small angle region, the diffraction peaks with 2θ of 6.8° and 4.4° for (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl were assigned to the (010) crystallographic planes from the organic spacers of quasi-2D perovskites, corresponding to a d-spacing of 13.1 Å and 19.8 Å respectively. The existence of (010) diffraction peaks and the similar d-spacings in the calculation results (discussed later) clearly evidenced the formation of quasi-2D DJ perovskites.14 The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the (111) peak for (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl is smaller than that of (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl (Fig. 2d), which indicates higher crystallinity or larger grain size of (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl in the film according to the Scherrer formula.39 The much lower PXRD peaks of the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film suggest that the (111) and (202) crystallographic planes are dominant due to the more regular-oriented polycrystals when compared with the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film. In addition, the decreased (010) peak intensities (normalized by the corresponding (111) peaks) upon MACl addition for both (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 films (Fig. S4†) implied that quasi-2D perovskites with low-n values may have been partially converted to high-n quasi-2D/3D perovskites in the film. The attempt to grow quasi-2D DJ perovskite single crystals failed; instead 1D (MDAN/EDAN)PbI3 single crystals were obtained (Fig. S5a and b†). The simulated PXRD pattern of these 1D structures does not match that of the (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films, suggesting that 1D compounds were not formed under the film fabrication conditions (Fig. S5a and b†). Diamines are favorable for the formation of 1D perovskite single crystals due to their high formation energy, as mentioned in previous reports.34,40
According to the ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra (Fig. S6a and b†), the optical bandgaps of (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films were calculated to be 1.58 eV and 1.60 eV respectively (Fig. S6c and d†), corresponding to 3D MAPbI3 perovskites or quasi-2D perovskites with n > 5.41 With lower MACl content (0 wt%, 5 wt%, and 10 wt%), two excitonic absorption peaks at 550 nm and 600 nm were observed for (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 based films, which could be assigned to n = 2 and n = 3 quasi-2D phases, respectively (Fig. S6b†).42 Further increasing the MACl content resulted in the disappearance of both peaks, which also demonstrated that MACl doping could convert low-n quasi-2D perovskites to high-n quasi-2D/3D perovskites. In contrast, the characteristic low-n quasi-2D peak was not observed for (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19 films (Fig. S6a†), which implies that the formation of quasi-2D perovskites with high-n values should be more favorable, which is supported by the theoretical calculation results (discussed later). In addition, adding MACl could intensify the absorption of both films as suggested by previous reports,33 benefiting the light-absorbing ability of solar cell devices. To provide more information about the film composition, transient absorption spectroscopy was also utilized (Fig. S7†). There are no signals in the region below 700 nm, which means that the low-n quasi-2D phase is absent in both (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films. One photobleaching peak appeared at around 740 nm and reached maximum within 0.33 ps for both films, which gradually red-shifted to 755 nm in a time interval of 1.99 ns. The red-shift of the photobleaching peak may be the result of fast (ns scale) energy transfer from high-n quasi-2D perovskites to 3D perovskites, which further evidences the existence of high-n quasi-2D phases.43
Although MDAN based perovskite films possess higher crystallinity and do not contain low-n quasi-2D phases, their corresponding device performances are still inferior to those of the EDAN based ones. One important factor could be their different film morphology, which was revealed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) images. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, a larger grain size of 200–400 nm for the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film was observed as compared with the 100–200 nm gain size of the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film, which is consistent with its smaller FWHM in the XRD spectra. However, pinholes and grain boundaries are more obvious for the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film, which could lead to higher defect density and leakage current in solar cell devices. Indeed, the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl based device exhibited higher leakage current in the dark (Fig. S8†). The inferior film morphology of (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19 compared with (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 is more prominent without MACl addition as shown in Fig. S9,† in which more cracks and pinholes were observed. Therefore, we believe that the MACl additive could improve the morphology of perovskite films.44 Again, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) results prove that MACl is negligible in (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films (Fig. S10, Tables S5 and S6†), which is consistent with the XPS results. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) also revealed a smoother film surface of (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl with a root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3.23 nm, compared with a RMS roughness of 4.99 nm for the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film (Fig. 3c and d). The better film morphology of (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl could lead to higher charge separation efficiency and fewer non-radiative losses, accounting for its higher device parameters.

Since defects play an important role in the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells, the defects of (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films were further characterized by steady-state and time-resolved photoluminescence (PL and TRPL) spectroscopy (Fig. 3e and f). With the same excitation intensity and similar film thickness, (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl exhibited significantly higher PL intensity than (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl. In addition, their PL decay curves were fitted using bi-exponential fitting, suggesting a fast and a slow decay component of 7.4 ns and 32 ns respectively, for the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film. In contrast, the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film exhibited a much longer PL lifetime with a fast and a slow decay component of 21 ns and 89 ns, respectively (Table S7†). These results indicate that defect-mediated non-radiative recombination was suppressed in the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film compared with the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film. In addition, the PL spectra excited from the glass side give emission peaks at 500 nm, 560 nm and 640 nm, which suggests low-n quasi-2D phases could form on glass substrates (Fig. S11†).
The defect densities of the two films were evaluated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. Hole-only devices with device architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/quasi-2D perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au were fabricated. The dark J–V curves were logarithmically plotted in which a low-voltage ohmic region with a slope of 1 and a trap-filled-limited (TFL) region with a slope >2 were observed (Fig. 3g).45 The voltages (VTFL) of the crossing points between the tangent of the ohmic region and TFL region were used to calculate the trap densities (Ntrap) using the following formula:46  in which ε0 represents the vacuum permittivity, εr represents the relative permittivity (εr = 25),47VTFL represents the trap-filled limit voltage, and L and q represent the perovskite film thickness and the elementary charge, respectively. The calculated Ntrap values for (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films are 3.7 × 1015 cm−3 and 3.3 × 1015 cm−3, respectively. The higher defect density of the former film is consistent with the previous SEM and PL results. On the other hand, electrochemical impendence spectroscopy (EIS) was conducted to extract the internal charge recombination resistance (Rrec) (Fig. 3h).48 The Rrec is higher for the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl based device, proving more efficient charge carrier transport and suppressed charge recombination.49 All the above characterization studies lead to the conclusion that the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl based devices are superior in film morphology, resulting in fewer defects thus less non-radiative recombination loss, accounting for their better device performance.
Other than the defect density, the crystallographic orientation of the quasi-2D perovskites is another important factor determining the charge transport efficiency and the device performance. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) characterization was performed for both (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films. As shown in Fig. 3i, low-angle diffraction rings appeared at q = 0.48 Å−1 and 0.30 Å−1, corresponding to d-spacings of 13.1 Å and 20.9 Å for the (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films respectively. The calculated d-spacings from GIWAXS and XRD spectra are similar, further validating the existence of quasi-2D phases. Nevertheless, diffraction rings instead of diffraction spots were observed, implying that the quasi-2D perovskites take random orientations relative to the substrate in both films. Similar results were obtained with different X-ray incident angles, suggesting the random orientation of quasi-2D perovskites at different detection depths (Fig. S12†). As is well known, the in-plane orientation of quasi-2D perovskite is undesirable for perovskite solar cells because the charge transport from perovskite to electrodes through insulating organic layers is hindered. Unlike 2D RP perovskites with n > 4 that tend to orient vertically to the substrate,50 these nominal n = 6 quasi-2D DJ perovskites do not have an obviously preferred orientation, which should be further optimized.
We also noticed that the intensity of the (010) diffraction peak is lower for (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl when compared with that of (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl both in the GIWAXS (Fig. 3j) and XRD spectra. Given that the same precursor composition and same fabrication conditions were used, we suspect that the quasi-2D perovskites may have different distributions in the films forming deviated surface compositions.
Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) is a powerful tool to determine the depth profile of multiple components in samples. The distributions of MA+, Pb2+, MDAN2+/EDAN2+ ions in the (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films are shown in Fig. 4a and b. The depths were determined assuming that the perovskite layers are between the surface and where Si4+ saturates, and the noisy surface response due to surface absorption was erased for clarity. It is obvious that MDAN is more concentrated in the upper part of the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film, while in contrast, EDAN is relatively evenly distributed in the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film. Considering that the concentration of MDAN/EDAN could be a reflection of the concentration of quasi-2D perovskites, the 3D distribution image as shown in Fig. 4c could qualitatively indicate the quasi-2D rich area in these films. The compositional inhomogeneity of the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl device should result in distinct photoelectronic properties from those of the (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl based one. It's worth noting that the distribution of the quasi-2D phases extracted from the PL spectra of both sides seems to contradict the TOF-SIMS results. Considering that the PL intensity may be affected by multiple factors such as defects, local emissive species, quantum efficiency etc., the phase distribution extracted from TOF-SIMS should be more reliable.

The quasi-2D perovskite distribution should lead to different energy alignments for both devices. The energy levels of the films are characterized by ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). As shown in Fig. 4d, the work functions (WFs) are calculated to be 4.15 eV and 4.72 eV for (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films respectively, using the equation WF = 21.22 eV − ECutoff. The valence band maximum (VBM) of (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films is estimated to be −4.97 eV and −5.67 eV respectively, using the equation VBM = −WF − EFemi (Fig. 4e). Furthermore, the corresponding conduction band minimum (CBM) (CBM = VBM + Eg) was obtained to be −3.39 eV and −4.07 eV for the (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films respectively, as shown in Fig. 4f. Since UPS only characterizes the energy levels of the perovskite surface, the high CB of (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl results in an energy mismatch between the perovskite layer and the electron transporting layer, thus a high VOC loss for the device. On the other hand, the evenly distributed quasi-2D phases in (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl may expose more high-n quasi-2D/3D perovskites on the surface, lowering the CB to properly match with the electron transporting layer. In addition, the deviation of the surface energy levels of the two films indicates that the quasi-2D rich surface of the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl film may have higher energy levels than the quasi-2D deficient area near the bottom. Such energy band bending in an inverted device architecture is devastating for the hole/electron extraction by the corresponding transporting layers, which could partially explain the inferior device performance based on (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl.
To gain more insight into the electronic properties of the quasi-2D perovskites, the density functional theory (DFT) was employed to calculate the ground state structures and the bandgaps of (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19. The simulated crystal structures of (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 are shown in Fig. 4g and h, in which both MDAN and EDAN molecules interact with the inorganic slabs on both sides with anilinium groups to form quasi-2D DJ perovskites. The d-spacings of the organic layer (the distance between opposite Pb–I planes) were estimated to be 14.7 Å and 17.7 Å respectively, which match the experimental results. In contrast with the near linear EDAN molecule that fit perfectly with the perovskite lattice, the nonlinear MDAN molecule forms an asymmetric interaction pattern with the perovskite instead, slightly distorting the crystal lattice. Along the c-axis, the crystal structure of (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 exhibits perfect arrangement (0 displacement), whereas (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19 exhibits slightly imperfect arrangement of the inorganic slabs due to the non-linear structure of the MDAN cation (Fig. S13†). This may indicate better electronic interaction between inorganic slabs for (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 and partially explain its higher device performance.40 Intriguingly, the binding energies of MDAN/EDAN are calculated to be −9.67 eV and −9.20 eV respectively, and the formation energies of the (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 quasi-2D perovskites are estimated to be −13.06 eV and −12.47 eV respectively, highlighting the stronger interaction between MDAN and the perovskite and may explain the absence of low-n phases in the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19 film. The higher formation energy of (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19 may result in prior crystallization at the early stage of spin-coating, leading to a quasi-2D rich area near the surface of the film. The calculated bandgaps are 1.59 eV and 1.64 eV for (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19 respectively, which are close to the experimental optical bandgaps, validating the DFT calculation results (Fig. 4i and j). To summarize, a schematic illustration of the fabrication process is displayed in Fig. 5, illustrating the nominal n = 6 quasi-2D perovskite structures and the possible distribution of the complex compositions in real films.

Lastly, the stability of the (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl devices was evaluated. As shown in Fig. 6a, both unencapsulated devices could maintain over 90% of the initial PCE after being stored in nitrogen for 1000 h. The control device based on MAPbI3 only maintained 50% of its initial PCE under the same conditions. The thermal stabilities of the unencapsulated devices were estimated at 80 °C in a N2-filled glovebox as shown in Fig. S15.† The (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl devices maintained 68% of their original PCEs after 300 h, whereas the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl device revealed a fast degradation and maintained only 33% of its initial PCEs after 300 h. To exclude the instability introduced by hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS and the easily oxidized silver electrode, the stability of mere (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films is characterized by XRD. As shown in Fig. 6b, a very obvious diffraction peak at 12.7° belonging to the degradation product PbI2 was observed after storing the MAPbI3 film in air with 50% RH at room temperature for 20 days. Impressively, the (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl films remained unchanged after 20 days under the above air conditions (Fig. 6c and d). The high hydrophobicity of (MDAN/EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl was evidenced by the water contact angle measurement (Fig. S16†), providing protection for water invasion. The quasi-2D perovskites have dramatically improved stability compared to the 3D perovskite, even with a high nominal layer number n = 6, highlighting the merits of quasi-2D DJ perovskites.

3 Conclusion
In summary, two novel organic spacers MDAN and EDAN were used to develop nominal n = 6 quasi-2D DJ perovskites and the corresponding inverted solar cell devices. The MACl additive was evidenced to enhance the absorption of the films, improve film morphology and convert low-n to high-n quasi-2D perovskites. The champion (EDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl device achieved a PCE of 13.2%, which is higher than that of the (MDAN)MA5Pb6I19:0.15MACl device. Although the MDAN based films were observed to have larger grain size than the EDAN based ones, their poorer morphology and larger defect density harmed their device performance. In addition, unlike the relatively even distribution of quasi-2D perovskites in the EDAN based film, the inhomogeneity of the MDAN based film results in an unfavorable energy alignment for an inverted solar cell device, accounting for its inferior performance. Nevertheless, the high formation energy and high stability of MDAN based quasi-2D perovskites suggest that non-linear organic cations are within the scope of material development for quasi-2D DJ perovskites. Our work also emphasizes the importance of compositional distribution in achieving highly efficient quasi-2D perovskite solar cells.

The product was filtered, washed with diethyl ether and recrystallized with ethanol twice. The 1H NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. S8a.†
Synthesis of EDANI2 (4,4′-ethylenedianilinium diiodide)
The synthetic procedures are the same as the above, except for changing methylenedianiline to ethylenedianiline. The 1H NMR spectrum is shown in Fig. S8b.†
Synthesis of (MDAN/EDAN)PbI3 single crystals
PbI2 and MDANI2 (2:1 by molar, 0.25 mol) were dissolved in HI (45 wt%–50 wt% in water, 1.5% H3PO2) (8 mL) and H3PO2 (800 μL). PbI2 and EDANI2 (2:1 by molar, 0.25 mol) were dissolved in HI (45 wt%–50 wt% in water, 1.5% H3PO2) (8 mL) and H3PO2 (200 μL). The precursor solutions were stirred at 130 °C for 30 min and then slowly cooled to room temperature. Finally, needle-shaped yellowish single crystals are formed and filtered.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cell devices
Subsequently, (Pb2+) the perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by mixing PbI2 (1 mol L−1), MAI and MDANI2/EDANI2 at a molar ratio of 1:0.83:0.17 (n = 6) in a mixed solvent of DMF–DMSO (VDMF:VDMSO = 95:5). MACl was added in perovskite precursor solutions with small weight ratios (mMACl:mMAI = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20). The precursor solutions were stirred at 70 °C for 4 h before use. ITO conductive glass substrates were ultrasonically cleaned for 15 min using detergent, ultrapure water and isopropanol, sequentially. They are then UV ozone (Novascan) cleaned for 20 min. A layer of PEDOT:PSS (1.3–1.7%, solid content) was spun-coated on the cleaned ITO at 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 150 °C for 15 min. The perovskite precursor solution was spun-coated at 500 rpm for 5 seconds and at 4000 rpm for 60 seconds sequentially. 200 μL of chlorobenzene was dropped during the spin-coating process 45 seconds before the end. The film was then annealed at 100 °C for 20–30 min. Solutions of PC61BM (in chlorobenzene) and BCP (in isopropanol) were spun-coated on the perovskite layer at 2000 rpm for 60 s and at 4000 rpm for 30 s, sequentially. Finally, the 80 nm silver electrodes were vapor deposited at a rate of 1 Å s−1.
Characterization
The J–V curves were measured under ambient conditions using a Keithley Model 2400 with a solar light simulator (SS-F5-3A, Enlitech, Taiwan). All solar cells were tested in reverse scan from 1.2 to −0.2 V; the scanning step was 0.02 V and the scan rate was 0.2 V s−1. The EQE spectra were obtained using a QE-R 3011 system (Enlitech, Taiwan) in the range of 300–1000 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were performed (2θ = 3–40°) on D8-Advances. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were recorded with a TESCAN MIRA LMS. AFM images were recorded on a Brucker Icon. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) were measured by using an Edinburgh FLSP920 spectrophotometer with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm. The UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a U-3501 spectrophotometer (Hitachi). GIWAXS measurements were performed at the Synchrotron & Printable Electronic Lab, Hoffmann Institute of Advanced Materials, Shenzhen Polytechnic with SAXSFocus 3.0 equipped with a Cu X-ray Source (8.05 keV, 1.54 Å) and an EIGER 2R 500K detector. The incidence angle is 0.5°. The UPS measurement was performed on a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on a PAPSTAT MC. TOF-SIMS measurements were performed on a TOF-SIMS 5 iontof, PHI NanoTOFII. All the calculations (DFT) were implemented using the VASP code. The GGA–PBE functional is selected for the exchange and correlation potential. Weak van der Waals interactions were considered for the DFT-D3 functional. The cut off energy for the plane-wave is 400 eV. The Gamma point in the Brillouin-zone is chosen for integration. Total energies of the systems converge to 10−5 eV in the iteration solution of the Kohn–Sham equation. The force on each atom reduces to 0.05 eV Å−1 after geometry optimization.
