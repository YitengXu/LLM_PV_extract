    , Accepted 25th August 2015First published on 26th August 2015AbstractThree spiro-acridine-fluorene based hole transporting materials (HTMs), namely CW3, CW4 and CW5, are employed in the fabrication of organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells. The corresponding mesoscopic TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM devices are investigated and compared with that made with commercial spiro-OMeTAD. The best conversion efficiency of 16.56% is achieved for CW4 in the presence of tBp and Li-TFSI as additives and without a cobalt dopant. The performances of CW4 are further examined in terms of conductivity, mobility, morphology, and stability to show its potential as an alternative HTM.
Solid state organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have been extensively studied and they achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19%.1–3 Superior characteristics such as ambipolar transport with long carrier diffusion length, small exciton binding energy, and broad light harvesting capability in the visible region have contributed to the remarkable performances of PSCs. Organic hole transport materials (HTMs) played an important role as selective contacts for charge separation and extraction. Spiro-OMeTAD is the material commonly employed as the HTM for highly efficient solid-state dye-sensitized solar cells (ss-DSCs) and PSCs. Recently, many HTMs have been incorporated into perovskite with impressive solar energy conversion efficiency.1,3–8 Basically, the p-type contact materials for perovskite solar cells can be categorized according to their constituents, e.g. inorganic HTMs, polymeric HTMs and small molecular HTMs. Generally speaking, PSCs employing inorganic HTMs (i.e., NiO, CuI, CuSCN, and graphene oxide) have attracted much attention due to their higher mobility, high transparency in the visible region and good chemical stability.4,9–11 Moreover, organic HTMs are low-cost alternatives capable of low-temperature device processing. They are advantageous in providing diversified physical and optical properties to match the band gaps of various perovskites by modifying their structures. Thirdly, PSCs made using polymeric HTMs, such as oligothiophene,12,13 polyTPD,14,15 PDPPDBTE,16 PCPDTBT,17 PCDTBT,17 PTAA,17,18 and P3HT,17,19,20 have shown decent PCE. In contrast to polymeric HTMs with good stability and processibility, small molecular HTMs are easy to purify and suitable for forming crystalline thin films. Various small-molecule HTMs, such as arylamine functionalized pyrenes,21 functional thiophene and bithiophenes,6,22 perylene,23 BuPyIm-TFSI,24 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene,25,26 triphenylamine,27 triarylamine,28 2TPA-n-DP (n = 1–4),29,30 carbazole,5 DATPA,31 tetrathiafulvalene,32 star-shaped triphenylamine,33 spiro-OMeTAD,7 and TPB based HTMs,34 have been developed to show decent efficiencies between 11 and 16%. Encouraged by these discoveries, we developed a series of new HTMs with spiro-arranged acridine and fluorene moieties, which can be readily prepared using a large-scale reaction and in high yield versus the widely used spiro-OMeTAD.
From the viewpoint of structural design, the di(p-methoxyphenyl)amine moiety of spiro-OMeTAD provides the higher lying HOMO for hole transport. The spiro-architecture ensured good thermal stability with increased steric interaction that prevents it from crystallization, which is advantageous for infiltration into the mesoscopic network structure. However, difficulty in purification and higher costs for production limited its potential for applications in low-cost solar cells. In this work, we report the novel alternative HTMs, namely CW3, CW4, and CW5, among which PSCs incorporated with CW4 achieve an efficiency of 16.56%. The synthesis procedures of CW3, CW4, and CW5 are outlined in Scheme 1. Firstly, 4,4′-dimethoxydiphenylamine was treated with 2,7-dibromo-9H-fluoren-9-one using Buchwald–Hartwig coupling to afford the amine-substituted fluorenone in 85% yield. This fluorenone intermediate was next treated with a lithium derivative of functional triphenylamine, which was in situ generated by the addition of n-BuLi to the corresponding p-substituted 2-bromotriphenylamine.35 Without further purification, the obtained alcohols were converted to the spiro-acridine-fluorene compounds CW3–CW5 via a Friedel–Crafts intramolecular ring-closure reaction in high yield (>60%). Among all compounds CW3–CW5 synthesized, half of the structure possesses the key feature of spiro-OMeTAD to maintain the suitable HOMO energy level (i.e. −4.9 V) for hole transport, while the other half contains the functional acridine unit, for which the HOMO energy level should be slightly different, due to the distinctive molecular structure. Therefore, these compounds should possess several occupied molecular orbitals with minor differences in energy, which may be advantageous for efficient hole transport. Their high rigidity is also evident by the higher thermal decomposition temperatures (Td, corresponding to 5% weight loss in the TG analysis) of 234–254 °C and glass-transition temperatures (Tg) of 127–148 °C. The lower molecular weights also ensure better pore filling ability versus spiro-OMeTAD under typical conditions. Electrochemical and thermal characteristics of spiro-OMeTAD, CW3, CW4, and CW5 are summarized in Table 1.

The device architecture shown in Fig. 1(a) is based on the configuration of an n–i–p mesoscopic heterojunction perovskite solar cell which is composed of FTO/compact (cp) TiO2/mesoporous (mp) TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3/HTM/Au. A dense cp-TiO2 blocking layer is first deposited on the FTO substrate by spray pyrolysis, while a mesoporous n-type mp-TiO2 layer is formed by spin-coating of diluted TiO2 paste. The light harvesting CH3NH3PbI3 layer was then applied to the porous network using solvent engineering reported by Seok to form a uniform and densely packed perovskite layer.36 Experimentally, perovskite solution is prepared by dissolving 50 wt% of CH3NH3PbI3 in the mixed DMSO/GBL. The HTM is applied to the top of the CH3NH3PbI3 layer by spin-coating. Finally, an Au counter electrode is deposited by thermal evaporation. Fig. 1(b) shows the cross-sectional SEM image of fabricated mesoporous perovskite solar cells that employ spiro-OMeTAD as a HTM. Notably, the thickness of the capping layer of perovskite film is estimated to be ∼400 nm, which allowed saturated light absorption and IPCE in the red-light range (see Fig. 2(b)).

It is well known that the performance of solar cells can be improved significantly when 4-tert-butylpyridine (tBp) and lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) are added to the spiro-OMeTAD layer. Furthermore, certain cobalt or iridium metal complexes can be added as chemical dopants for improving the device performance.21,37,38 Thus, many studied PSCs were doped with tBp and Li-TFSI6,13,16,17,21,30,33,34,38 or with tBp, Li-TFSI and cobalt dopant FK102.39 Their conductivity and mobility were measured with a flat junction configuration where the spin-coated HTM is sandwiched between the FTO substrate and thermally evaporated gold electrode. The hole conductivity values of CW3, CW4, and CW5 are measured to be 5.92, 3.54 and 3.09 × 10−6 S cm−1, respectively. By fitting the J–V curves with the Mott–Gurney equation, the hole mobility values of HTMs are estimated to be 1.2, 0.58 and 0.87 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 S−1, respectively. Although the change in electrical properties is minimal, its variation can still be correlated with the associated molecular size and observed Tg. Fig. 2(a) shows current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the solar cells using spiro-OMeTAD, CW3, CW4, and CW5 with tBp and Li-TFSI as additives, while their numeric data are summarized in Table 1. The CW4-based device gives a JSC of 21.75 mA cm−2, VOC of 1050 mV, and FF of 72%, with a PCE of 16.56% under AM 1.5 G illumination. Under similar fabrication conditions, the CW3- and CW5-based PSCs show a JSC of 16.49 and 15.39 mA cm−2, VOC of 989 and 1005 mV, FF of 67% and 70%, and PCE of 10.94% and 10.76%, respectively. To check the reproducibility of the performance of the CW4-based device, statistic histograms are performed as presented in Fig. S1 (ESI†). Eventually, the CW4-based perovskite solar cell displays a JSC of 20.55 ± 1.31 mA cm−2, VOC of 1046 ± 17 mV, FF of 66 ± 4%, and PCE of 14.14 ± 1.47%. The stability of encapsulated (under ambient conditions) PSCs employing CW4 and spiro-OMeTAD is monitored as displayed in Fig. S2(a) (ESI†). The normalized PCE significantly decreases with an exposure time over 10 h. The results might be attributed to the instability of MAPbI3.40 Furthermore, residual humidity inside the sealed device would penetrate along the pinholes of HTMs to damage the devices (as seen in Fig. S3, ESI†). The long-term stability of spiro-OMeTAD and CW4 is monitored with a flat p–n junction configuration composed of FTO/cp-TiO2/HTM/Au. Fig. S2(b) and (c) (ESI†) present the evolution of their J–V curves under light soaking. A similar trend of J–V curves is observed before 174 h as displayed in Fig. S2(d) (ESI†).
PSCs employing CW4 present the highest JSC and PCE, which are superior to those of the reference device employing spiro-OMeTAD. The conductivity of all these HTMs appeared to be dependent on the hole hoping distances.41 The CW3 has no alkyl substituents, so that the smallest intermolecular separation reduces the hole hoping barrier between the molecules. This is revealed by the conductivity measurements where the CW3 has the highest conductivity than the others. However, in the device application where the kinetic interfacial charge transfer has to be taken into account. The small molecular size of CW3 probably leads to an inferior morphological coverage over the perovskite layer, leading to inferior hole extraction and lower photocurrent. On the contrary, as the size of substituents is increased for CW4, the increased steric interaction may lead to a conformal coating on top of perovskite, resulting in better photocurrent. As for CW5, the three bulky t-butyl substituents wrapping around the acridine fragment may restrain the inter-molecular carrier hopping, as shown in its lowest conductivity and, hence, the lowest current. The interplay between the steric interaction and morphological coverage is very complex and required further investigation to fully understand their impacts to the photovoltaic performances.
The photocurrent action spectra of four PSC devices are presented in Fig. 2(b). Notably, the CW4 device exhibits an IPCE of ∼80% which is superior to that displayed by spiro-OMeTAD. The surface morphology SEM images of spiro-OMeTAD and CW4 spin-coated on perovskite film are analyzed as shown in Fig. S3 (ESI†). The results indicate that the CW4 HTM layer displayed a uniform coverage over perovskite thin film. It is believed that better coverage of CW4 on the perovskite film is beneficial to the IPCE response. Addition of cobalt dopant FK102 was also attempted for further optimization of devices. Fig. 2(c) displays the J–V curves of devices with different doping concentrations of FK102 in CW4, while the detailed performance parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). Surprisingly, these devices failed to show any improvement over the undoped devices. This can be partially attributed to the extremely thin layer of the HTM that has very limited influences on charge transport despite the increased conductivity. Another contribution has probably resulted from the lowered inherent electron mobility of TiO2. Thus, unbalanced charge transport may result in higher recombination in the PSC with a highly doped HTM.42
Generally speaking, the HTM forms a flat junction on top of the perovskite layer without infiltration into the mesoscopic cavity in PSCs. This situation is unlike the ss-DSCs where the carrier would travel for a distance of ∼2 μm in the mesoscopic TiO2, so that the enhanced conductivity of the doped HTM would have exhibited a significant impact on the charge transport and especially the fill factor (FF) of the device.39 A similar effect on the photovoltaic performance has been reported in recent literature, although the mechanism was not yet clarified.32,43 Moreover, the PCE seems to be more sensitive to the HTM layer thickness, i.e. the conc. of HTM solution. This is revealed by the J–V curves and performance parameters of devices with a fixed conc. of FK102 of 9 mM and varied conc. of CW4, as shown in Fig. 2(d) and Table S2 (ESI†), respectively. The results show that the device utilizing 60 mM of CW4 presents the highest efficiency of 13.62% which is slightly lower than that of the best device without the added FK102 (e.g. 16.56%). With progressively increasing the HTM concentration, the increased thickness of the HTM results in the reduced carrier transport, versus the device prepared using the lowest conc. of 60 mM, at which the series resistance of the HTM is minimal. Thus, the thickness of the HTM above the perovskite layer is crucial for achieving descent efficiency.
Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) measurement is applied to investigate the charge carrier recombination behavior in bulk perovskite and at the perovskite/HTM interface, as shown in Fig. 3. A considerable decrease in PL intensity was observed for the perovskite film in contact with both doped spiro-OMeTAD and CW4. The enhanced quenching indicates effective charge extraction, which is in good agreement with the remarkable performance displayed by both HTMs.

In summary, spiro-arranged acridine and fluorene based HTMs were synthesized and applied in the fabrication of CH3NH3PbI3 based perovskite solar cells, among which the host CW4 showed the highest PCE of 16.56% in the absence of a cobalt dopant. The recorded performance characteristic is comparable to that of the standard PSC fabricated using commercial spiro-OMeTAD under identical architecture (14.32%). Moreover, electronic properties, surface morphology and stability of CW4 are analyzed to present a compatible performance as compared to spiro-OMeTAD. These results show that, after optimization of the structure, CW4 can be a promising and cost-effective HTM for perovskite solar cells.
