1. Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid lead halide perovskites attracted the attention of many researchers during the 1970s and 1990s,1–4 especially for their unique semiconducting and conducting properties.5–7 In 2009, research efforts to apply lead perovskite as light absorbers into solar cells were deployed: Miyasaka et al. incorporated CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) and CH3NH3PbBr3 (MAPbBr3) as sensitizers into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), delivering 3.8% and 3.1% power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), respectively.8 In light of the major source of clean and sustainable energy on earth, researchers have long sought to convert solar flux into electricity through the photovoltaic effect of light-absorbing semiconductors. The earlier generation of photovoltaics utilized inorganic crystalline semiconductors, such as silicon, cadmium telluride (CdTe) and copper indium gallium selenide/sulfide (CIGS), as absorbers, which although they can be efficient and stable, usually require high energy-input manufacture, involving high-temperature and high-vacuum processes.
The current generation of emerging organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) represent one of the transformative technologies of today, because they, like organic solar cells (OSCs)9,10 and DSSCs,11 potentially can be transited into lightweight, flexible and low-cost power sources through high-throughput solution fabrication.12 PVSCs have therefore attracted intensive research efforts from both academia and industry. The maximum PCE of PVSCs has rapidly improved from 3.8% to 22.1% in just 7 years,13 now rivalling the efficiency of silicon solar cells. The PCE essentially benefits from the exceptional optoelectrical properties of semiconducting organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, such as the strong optical absorption coefficient, a direct bandgap, long carrier lifetime and diffusion length14–17 and high electron/hole mobility in the crystalline state.18,19 More importantly, organic–inorganic lead halide perovskites generate loosely bonded excitons with a really small bonding energy, which facilitates the generation of free charge carriers within the perovskite at the cost of only a minimal driving force.20,21 As a result, the rapid advancement of a single junction PVSC has reached the level close to its theoretical efficiency ceiling, through combined innovations on the elemental composition, crystalline film formation, interface and device architecture, etc.22–35
Although magnificent progress has been made for PVSCs, a number of barriers, ranging from the fundamental to the practical, still remain and need to be further overcome to validate their commercial relevance, as much as that of traditional silicon solar cells. For instance, concerns on the operational stability of PVSC and the search for an environmentally benign perovskite composition need to be further addressed for pushing PVSC technology on a large scale.36,37 It is known that the MAPbI3 perovskite is liable to degrade under exposure to moisture, heat and prolonged illumination in air.38 Therefore, the prototype PVSC currently possesses a relatively short operational lifetime upon exposure to humidity, heat and light. One prerequisite for market consideration is to extend the lifespan of PVSCs to decades in outdoor conditions. On the other hand, lead-based perovskites contain water soluble Pb salt as a degradation product, which is toxic upon human exposure.
Although these challenges pose barriers to PVSC advancement, a number of encouraging discoveries have been achieved in the past 2–3 years for PVSCs. Undoubtedly, issues around achieving high-efficiency and stable devices as well as environmentally benign perovskites are the critical, yet challenging aspects of PVSC research needed to be overcome to support their larger scale commercialization. Herein, we focus on the recent advances of PVSCs in the related subjects. In the following parts of this review article, we first introduce the approaches that enable the development of high-efficiency PVSCs through processing of the perovskite films, as well as through approaches focused on their composition engineering, interfacial layer and tandem architecture. Then, the material and device stabilities, and the development of lead-free perovskite will be discussed. In the last section, we outline a number of conclusions along with brief perspectives on further advancing PVSCs towards application in efficient and stable solar-to-electricity technologies.
2. High-efficiency perovskite solar cells
High efficiency is one of the central criteria for validating the practical relevance of solar cells. The primary endeavour devoted to PVSC research is perhaps to obtain highly efficient devices. The PCE of a solar cell is defined by the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF). These three parameters closely interplay with the quality of the perovskite film and perovskite composition39–42 and the interfacial contact43–46 as well as the device architecture.47–49 Basically, the Voc correlates to the quasi-Fermi level of photo-excited perovskite and the electrode work function. To obtain a high Jsc, a perovskite absorber needs to harvest incident photos completely, while maintaining efficient charge generation, transport and extraction with minimal recombination. FF relates to the parasitic series resistance (Rs) and shunt resistance (Rp) of devices,50,51 depending on the bulk conductivity of each of the layers, and the contact resistance in between them. In this section, we introduce recent approaches that have led to high-efficiency PVSCs, including perovskite film processing, composition and interface engineering, as well as the device architecture.
First, it is to be noted that the widely used single junction PVSC architecture can be catalogued into mesoscopic and planar heterojunction structures (Fig. 1). In the mesoscopic structure, a mesoporous metal oxide scaffold, such as titanium oxide (TiO2) or aluminium oxide, (Al2O3) is applied, into which the perovskite is infiltrated.24 On the other hand, benefitting from the high ambipolar mobilities of perovskite, PVSCs can also afford a planar heterojunction configuration instead, avoiding the harsh processing of mesoporous TiO2. The planar devices include regular (n–i–p)52 and inverted (p–i–n)53 devices, depending on which selective contact is used atop of the transparent electrode. It is worth noting that the current best performing devices usually reported involve mesoscopic devices; albeit, recently, the efficiencies of planar devices have also improved over 20%, and also the fabrication of planer devices is relatively easier compared to that of TiO2-based mesoporous devices.

2.1 Processing of perovskite films
The evolution of device efficiencies requires the continuous improvement of the film quality of crystalline perovskite layers, so that they are uniform, smooth and pin-hole free etc. Here, we exemplify several effective methodologies to access high-quality thin film. The vapour-deposition method was introduced by Liu et al. and achieved an efficiency of over 15% in planar heterojunction PVSCs (Fig. 2a).54 This method produces good uniformity of the perovskite films over a range of length scales, subsequently resulting in good performance. It also shows the advantage of preparing multi-stack thin films over large areas.55 Solution fabrication is attractive for solar cell technology due to the merit of low energy consumption at the massive manufacturing scale. However, one challenge is that perovskites are hard to form compact and flat films due to the strong tendency of anisotropic crystallization during solvent evaporation. Thus, fabrication strategies to control the rapid crystallization of such perovskites are necessary. Generally, controlling the kinetics between nucleation and crystal grain growth is an effective way to obtain high-quality perovskite films with excellent optoelectronic properties.

Jeon et al. first reported the anti-solvent (solvent engineering) method to obtain high-quality perovskite film and figured out that DMSO is able to form an intermediate MAI–PbI2–DMSO to retard the crystal growth of perovskites, which has since been extensively adopted by various research groups.56–59 Chen et al. also developed a fast crystallization method involving spin-coating of a DMF solution of MAPbI3 followed by immediate exposure to chlorobenzene to promote perovskite film formation (Fig. 2b). Later, a gas-assisted solution-processing technique was developed, which delivers uniform perovskite films consisting of densely packed single crystalline grains.60
Two-step deposition has also proven to be efficient for achieving excellent films. Burschka et al. first developed a two-step method, in which PbI2 was introduced onto a porous TiO2 film and subsequently converted into the perovskite by exposing it to MAI solution, which yielded a perovskite film with an improved film quality and an increased efficiency of 15% in mesoporous devices.61 Afterwards, an interdiffusion method was introduced by Xiao et al., which combined a sequence spin-coating of PbI2 and MAI, then conversion into perovskite film (Fig. 2c), which yielded a 15.4% PCE in a planar device.62 By further combining with DMF solvent annealing, the quality of the perovskite films from the interdiffusion method can be further improved to reach a high efficiency with a thickness of 630 nm in planar devices.63 Very recently, Bi et al. demonstrated PMMA can template the nucleation and crystal growth of perovskite films with fewer defects and larger oriented grains, enabling perovskite solar cells to achieve a certified PCE of 21.02%.64
Although the highest certified PCE of PVSCs has surpassed 22%, approaching the record PCEs of commercialized thin-film technologies based on CIGS or CdTe, there is still a far distance to these PCEs having practical relevance since most of these high PCEs of PVSCs were recorded on small areas, typically around 0.1 cm2. The PCEs of large-area PVSCs still lag behind those of small area devices. One of the key challenges for up-scaling PVSCs is the fabrication of pinhole-free, uniform perovskite films on large areas with high reproducibility.65 Deng et al. used a scalable doctor-blade coating to fabricate MA0.6FA0.4PbI3 PVSCs, obtaining a high efficiency of 18.3% (Fig. 3a).66 This offered control of the freedom for film formation (e.g. temperature, precursor stoichiometry) to obtain high-quality perovskite films, which could also be complementary to the spin-coating method. Gu et al. applied roll-to-roll (R2R) coating to fabricate a MAPbI3−xClx film on SAM-modified PEDOT:PSS and obtained an efficiency of 5.1% for the semi-R2R solar cell.67 Schmidt et al. used slot-die coating to make MAPbI3 on flexible PET/ITO. Combined with a printed back electrode, such a fully roll processing flexible perovskite solar cell had an efficiency of 4.9%.68 A vacuum flash-assisted solution process (VASP) (Fig. 3b) was recently developed for high-efficiency large-area PVSCs. With shiny, smooth and crystalline perovskite films of high electronic quality over large areas, solar cells with an aperture area exceeding 1 cm2 showing a maximum efficiency of 20.5% and a certified PCE of 19.6% were achieved.42 Conings et al. invented the universal complex-assisted gas quenching (CAGQ) method, which introduces a nitrogen gas flow to take away residue solvent to form an intermediate DMSO-complex, and they applied this method to many perovskite materials. Through this method, an efficiency of 18.0% was obtained (Fig. 3c).69 Ye et al. developed a soft-cover deposition (SCD) method (Fig. 3d) to obtain pinhole-free, large crystal grains and rough-border-free MAPbI3 perovskite films with a large area up to 51 cm2. This SCD method also improved the material utilization efficiency to ∼80%, much higher than spin-coating (only 1%). A reproducible PCE of 17.6% was achieved for 1 cm2 solar cells.70

Thanks to the sophisticated fabrication methods developed so far, the progress in device efficiencies is approaching its theoretical limit in single junction PVSCs with a small area. To push PVSCs into real applications, continuous efforts are needed to fabricate high-quality crystalline perovskite film in large areas with good reproducibility.
2.2 Composition engineering
Regarding the general formula of ABX3, perovskites for solar cell applications usually contain A as a monovalent cation, a divalent cation B and a monovalent anion X.73 The choice of component ions not only determines the crystal unit structure, but also tunes the optoelectrical properties of the resultant perovskites. To form a stable three-dimensional (3D) structure, the selection of component ions can be predicted by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, t:  where RA, RB and RX are the radius of A, B and X ions. It was revealed that a cubic perovskite is formed when 0.9 ≤ t ≤ 1, while a hexagonal or tetragonal structure is formed with t >1 and an orthorhombic or rhombohedral structure is formed with 0.71 ≤ t ≤ 0.9.74,75 In the early stage, the most common organic cations used in lead-based perovskites were methylammonium (CH3NH3+/MA). However, a bandgap of 1.55 eV (MAPbI3) is not enough for panchromatic absorption due to the relatively short absorption limited to 800 nm. Indeed, the delicate tuning of a perovskite composition is found to have a large impact on the optoelectrical properties of the resultant perovskite materials. For instance, replacement of MA with formamidinium (FA) was found to reduce the bandgap by about 0.07 eV, from 1.55 eV to 1.48 eV, giving rise to an extension of the absorption wavelength by about 40 nm.76 The replacement of partial Pb2+ with Sn2+ leads the bandgap to decrease from 1.55 eV to 1.27 eV.77 It was also observed that the change of halide can result in bandgap variation.78 The direct impact from composition engineering is changes in the perovskite properties, which thus affect the correspondent PVSC performance. In this section, we introduce the recent progresses of high-performance PVSCs achieved with the composition engineering of perovskites. The appropriate content for perovskite stability derived from composition engineering will be discussed in the stability section.
The large size of the FA cation (compared to that of MA) led to FAPbI3 having a high tolerance factor t >1, which resulted in a hexagonal yellow non-perovskite δ-phase at room temperature. It thus needs careful investigation to improve the phase stability of black perovskite trigonal α-FAPbI3 for practical solar cells. Jeon and Seok et al. investigated the performance of mixed perovskites, (FAPbI3)1−x(MAPbBr3)x and demonstrated that the incorporation of MAPbBr3 into FAPbI3 not only stabilizes the perovskite phase of FAPbI3, but also improves the PVSC PCE beyond 18%.41 Recently, Jacobsson and Hagfeldt et al. studied 49 different perovskite compositions that were obtained by independently varying the MA/FA and the I/Br-ratio in the mixed perovskites (Fig. 4a).40 They revealed that small changes in the perovskite composition have a large impact on the material properties (bandgap, energy level and morphology etc.) and on the resultant device performance. For example, an increased amount of bromide increases the bandgap, whereas an increased amount of FA, decreases the bandgap but to a smaller extent; whereas a larger amount of bromide in the perovskite was found to cause intense sub-bandgap photoemission with detrimental results for the device performance. A sound explanation could be a phase separation with the formation of a minority phase with a lower bandgap (i.e. an iodide-rich perovskite) and the majority phase. The photo-excited charge carriers could easily be trapped in this secondary minority phase, as illustrated in Fig. 4c–e. As a result, cell efficiencies improved from a few per cent up to 20.7% with the composition of FA4/6MA2/6PbBr0.5I2.5.

Furthermore, inorganic cations, like caesium can be introduced to triple cation perovskite compositions (Cs/MA/FA), which can produce new perovskites with improved thermal stability. Meanwhile, it gives a purer α-FAPbI3 phase that is less sensitive to processing conditions. The ideal ratio of Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 enables reproducible device performances to reach a stabilized power output of 21.1% and ∼18% after 250 h under operational conditions.79 As shown in Table 1, we summarize the highest PCEs reported for efficient perovskites with different compositions. It is interesting to observe that a number of multi-compositional perovskites have device efficiencies near or over 20%, representing nowadays highly efficient PVSCs with mesoporous structure and/or planar structure.

As a brief conclusion, material composition engineering is essential to generate a variety of perovskites with designed optoelectronic properties, some of which enable PVSCs with efficiencies over 20%. Further studies are needed to clarify the design rule of the perovskite composition, since a complicated precursor composition would likely make the film formation kinetics more difficult. Therefore, the desired composition should be the outcome of a fine balance among a number of aspects, such as device efficiency, processing and stability, etc. Apart from the high efficiency related to PVSCs, it has been previously shown that the J–V hysteresis behaviour also makes determination of the actual efficiency of PVSCs difficult. The efficiency obtained from reverse scans is usually inconsistent with that obtained from forward scans, and also a higher scan rate would result in higher efficiency.80–82 The origin of J–V hysteresis has been discussed, and is ascribed to reasons such as ferroelectric polarization of the perovskite,83 the trap states of the perovskite materials,84 ion migration,85 ionization-enhanced migration of hydrogen impurities etc. Although the definitive conclusion has not been pinned-down yet, the recent progress in PVSCs generally shows a high performance with mitigated hysteresis.
2.3 Interfacial layers
In addition to the quality of perovskite absorbers, the electrical and electronic contact between the photoactive layer and electrode is of critical importance to determine the performance of solar cells.43–46,90–94 Basically, it requires an interfacial layer comprising a hole-transporting material (HTM) or electron-transporting material (ETM), which selectively extract photo-generated charge from the perovskite film and transport it to the corresponding electrode. To deal with organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites, recent studies also revealed that interfacial materials can have additional effects, like the passivation of trap states,95 as a barrier for moisture96 and as a template for perovskite crystal growth,97etc. In particular, hysteresis in PVSCs, as mentioned above, can also be healed with the proper interface engineering. All these features are the available knobs that potentially boost up device performance and stability, as well as mitigate hysteresis. Essentially, it is important to develop novel interfacial materials for PVSCs.
Spiro-OMeTAD is a commonly used HTM in mesoporous PVSC and can give remarkable efficiency. Due to the low conductivity of pristine spiro-OMeTAD, the PVSCs also usually require additive doping for efficient hole extraction and transport; however, this results in complicated device processing and a deterioration in device stability, which are major drawbacks for current PVSCs.98,99 Therefore, dopant-free and easily fabricated hole-transport materials are necessary for PVSCs.100–102 Xu et al. developed an easily synthesized spiro-structured HTM X60, which utilized low-cost spiro[fluorene-9,9′-xanthene] core to replace spirofluorene, and obtained an efficiency of 19.84%.103 Malinauskas et al. synthesized a new small-molecule HTM V826 based on OMeTAD-substituted fluorene fragments, obtaining an efficiency near 20%.104 Saliba et al. designed an HTM FDT with a simple dissymmetric fluorene–dithiophene core. The low-cost FDT-based mesoporous PVSC could deliver an impressive efficiency as high as 20.2%.105 Nishimura et al. developed Azulene 1 HTM by using an azulene core and four quasiplanar arylamines, giving a PCE of 16.5%.106 Nevertheless, the above-mentioned HTMs still need the addition of a dopant to ensure outstanding performances in mesoporous devices.
Alternatively, a planar heterojunction device, i.e. a p–i–n structure, affords the use of a thin and flat HTM layer underneath the perovskite layer, so the stringent requirements on HTM conductivity can be alleviated. Dopant-free HTMs have been designed for such structures, showing comparable efficiencies to those of mesoporous devices. Among these, polymeric HTM, poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) is widely used, but it has adverse effects due to its hydroscopicity and acidity. To ensure the wetting ability to the perovskite precursor solution, Xue et al. synthesized a polymer HTM HSL2 with a sodium sulfonate terminal group on the side chain, which was inserted between PEDOT:PSS and the perovskite film, and a high PCE of 16.6% was achieved with negligible hysteresis.107 Lee et al. also introduced the sodium sulfonate group to the side chain of a polymer with a backbone of benzene and thiophene (PhNa-1T).108 The flexible inverted device based on PhNa-1T exhibited a PCE of 14.7% with high hole-extraction and suppressed charge recombination.
Another classic polymeric HTM, poly(bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine) (PTAA) and its analogs have been routinely used in planar devices.109,110 Bi et al. demonstrated that a non-wetting HTM is beneficial to fabricating large perovskite grain sizes with reduced charge trap density, achieving an enhanced and stabilized efficiency of 18.1% from the PTAA-based planar devices,97 compared with a device based on hydrophilic PEDOT:PSS. Small-molecule HTMs are also promising for this application, where they have good structure tunabilities. Huang et al. reported a truxene-based dopant-free HTM Trux-OMeTAD. The planar and symmetrical truxene core promoted ordered molecular packing in a solid, which facilitated a high hole mobility up to 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 and enabled an efficiency of 18.6% for the p–i–n planar PVSCs.111
Besides organic HTMs, lots of interest has also been shown to inorganic materials, especially nickel oxide.112–114 Jung et al. reported a solution-processable Cu-doped NiOx HTM for PVSC. Due to the enhanced crystallinity and conductivity brought about by Cu, the resulting device showed an impressive PCE of 17.8%.115 Zhang et al. demonstrated an n–i–p planar PVSC employing solution-processed CuGaO2 as the HTM.116 The dense CuGaO2 layer with its high mobility can enhance the PCE to 18.51% and also improve the device's long-term stability significantly by avoiding the need for an organic dopant. Yu et al. fabricated a p–i–n planar PVSC based on a solution-processed CuOx HTM, which showed a PCE of 17.4% with good reproducibility and stability.117
As for ETMs, metal oxides (like TiO2 and SnO2) as well as C60 fullerene and its derivatives (like phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester, PC61BM), are commonly used for PVSCs.91,118–125 The desired ETM should exhibit suitable energetics and a wide optical bandgap, to maximize the photon absorption by the perovskite layer and to selectively extract electrons while blocking holes at the cathode side to alleviate charge recombination at the device interface. Zhou et al. utilized yttrium-doped TiO2 (Y-TiO2) as an ETM to construct a planar PVSC. A high PCE of 19.3% was achieved through careful control of the device interface and the formation of a perovskite film.126 Recently, SnO2 has attracted interest as an ETM due to its wide bandgap, high transparency and high mobility.127 Baena et al. demonstrated a 15 nm SnO2 layer with a mixed perovskite film to give a PCE of 18.4% with an outstanding high Voc of 1.19 V.128 Zuo et al. modified ZnO HTM in p–i–n devices with 3-aminopropanioc acid (C3-SAM) to direct the crystalline process and improve the crystal quality.129 The resulting devices could output an efficiency of 15.67%. However, the usual development of a metal oxide, i.e. TiO2, required high temperature sintering and showed performance degradation upon UV exposure. Regarding this, organic-based ETMs exhibit advantages, such as mild solution-processing and good tunabilities.
New fullerene derivatives have been extensively studied. Regarding the metal oxide defects, a fullerene self-assembled monolayer can passivate the charge traps of metal oxide130–132 and a fullerene unit towards perovskite by reducing the nonradiative recombination channels at the interface, which significantly improves the photovoltaic performance with low hysteresis.119,133,134 Fullerene derivatives, such as fullerene with ammonium salts,96,135–139 fullerene with a fluorinated chain124 or oligoether side group chain,140,141 or crown-ether142 or cyanoacetate moieties100 have been developed to facilitate the fabrication of stable and efficient PVSCs. It was previously revealed that the in situ anion-induced electron transfer (AIET) between certain anions of ammonium salts and fullerene, as well as other n-type materials, facilitate the intrinsic n-type doping to improve the charge transport and work function tunabilities of organic ETM layers.143–146 Li et al. demonstrated that the intramolecular charge-transfer characteristics of triphenylamine-functionalized fullerene TPA-PCBM could improve the molecular polarization, carrier density and charge-transport capability, leading to a 13% enhancement in Jsc compared with PC61BM.147
In the meantime, non-fullerene organic ETMs have merits of good structural tunabilities with low cost, but remain less explored.148–151 Sun et al. reported a polymer ETM PFN-2TNDI containing naphthalene diimide and an amine end-capped side chain.149 It could achieve a high PCE of 16.7% for PVSC, since ETM itself is conductive, while adjusting the electrode work function and passivating the perovskite surface defects. Zhang et al. developed a small molecule, HATNASOC7-CS, and used it as an ETM to construct p–i–n devices, which showed a superior PCE of 17.6%.150 Recently, a discotic coronene diimide (CDI) core-based ETM, CDIN, was developed. The large, extended π-conjugated CDI plane was favourable for strong π–π stacking to enhance charge mobility, resulting in a high efficiency of over 17% in n–i–p devices.151
As a brief conclusion, a good number of interfacial materials have been developed with a variety of functionalities, which largely enrich both the planner and mesoporous PVSCs to over 18% PCE and up to 22.1% PCE to date. In Fig. 5, we provides the molecular structures of some efficient HTM and ETM. For the perspectives, some controlling features would be desired for the further exploration of new HTMs and ETMs, such as the capabilities to guide perovskite crystal growth, to passivate the defeats and to protect the perovskite from moisture and UV-light degradation, in addition to the conventional considerations of charge mobility, energy level and work-function tunabilities of the interfacial layers.
2.4 Tandem solar cells
In addition to the extensive studies into single junction PVSCs, the exploration of multiple junction devices, like tandem and parallel solar cells,152–155 is believed to be an effective strategy for reaching higher efficiencies and overcoming the Shockley–Queisser limit in single junction devices. In tandem devices, high and low energy photons can be selectively harvested by the front and rear cells with different bandgaps, which are electrically collected through a transparent internal electrode.152–154 Due to the tunable bandgaps between 1.17 and 2.3 eV,156,157 low-cost perovskites are particularly attractive for constructing tandem devices by themselves, or in interfacing with a variety of solar cells, such as silicon, copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS) and OSCs. Theoretical predictions suggest that the peak efficiency for the mechanically stacked tandem is 37.2% and 35.7% for a monolithic tandem when combed with a 1.6 eV perovskite solar cell and a Si solar cell with a theoretical peak efficiency of 29.4%.158,159
Perovskites containing tandem solar cells are mainly fabricated in two types of configuration: mechanically stacked 4-terminal tandems and monolithic 2-terminal tandems. The structures are shown in Fig. 6. In 4-terminal tandems, the two cells are fabricated independently and are then mechanically stacked on top of each other, while the monolithic tandems electrically connect two subcells through a transparent internal electrode. The presence of an extra transparent electrode in 4-terminal devices results in additional absorption losses and device cost. The challenges associated with the 2-terminal perovskite tandem solar cells include the development of a charge recombination layer and the complicated multi-layer fabrication, as well as the delicate optimization of the sub-cell thickness to ensure the current match in between. Table 2 presents the current status of various types of perovskite tandem devices reported in the literature.

Silicon is the most widely investigated small-bandgap material as a rear cell for perovskite tandems. McMeekin and Snaith et al. combined Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 with an optimized optical bandgap of 1.75 eV with a 19%-efficiency silicon cell and demonstrated the feasibility of achieving >25% PCE 4-terminal tandem solar cells.160 The small-bandgap materials can also be perovskites. Yang and Jen et al. developed MA0.5FA0.5Pb0.75Sn0.25I3 with a low bandgap of 1.33 eV as a rear cell, and when it was combined with MAPbI3 as a front cell, a 4-terminal tandem device with an efficiency up to 19.08% could be achieved.161 Eperon and Snaith et al. developed an infrared absorbing 1.2 eV bandgap perovskite, Cs0.25FA0.75Pb0.5Sn0.5I3, as a rear cell. By combining it with a wider bandgap Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.5Br0.5)3, with a bandgap of 1.6 eV, they reached monolithic 2-terminal tandem efficiencies of 17.0% and obtained 4-terminal tandem cells with 20.3% efficiency.39
As mentioned above, perovskite-based tandem solar cells are mainly a combination of wide bandgap PVSCs with other highly efficient small-bandgap solar cells, like silicon or CIGS. Since the bandgap of perovskite materials can be easily tuned, fully perovskite tandem solar cells have also been developed. Low bandgap perovskites, including the unstable Sn2+, temporally show adverse influence on a device's long-term stability. Therefore, at the current stage, the combination of wide bandgap and efficient PVSCs with other state-of-the-art low bandgap silicon or CIGS solar cells may be a bright choice for further development.
3. Perovskite materials and device stability
The efficiency of common MAPbI3- and FAPbI3-based PVSCs is fairly high. However, the long-term operational stability is still a big challenge for PVSCs. The origin of the instability of devices can be mainly ascribed to unstable perovskite materials, which tend to decompose under environmental stresses, such as humidity, heat and prolonged light illumination in air. The possible decomposition mechanism of MAPbI3 under humidity and light is suggested as following eqn (1) to (6); whereby MAPbI3 first decomposes into solid PbI2 and CH3NH3I. Then, CH3NH3I further decomposes into aqueous CH3NH2 and HI.36 Likewise, HI could convert into iodine upon oxidation or photon excitation (eqn (1)–(4)). MAPbI3 also decomposes into CH3NH2 gas and HI gas under light illumination (eqn (5)–(8)).36 (1) CH3NH3I(aq.) ⇌ CH3NH2(aq.) + HI(aq.)(2) 4HI(aq.) + O2 ⇌ 2I2 + 2H2O(3) (4) (5) (6) (7) I− + I2 + 3H+ + 2e− ⇌ 3HI↑(8)
To improve the stability of PVSCs, both stable perovskite materials and devices should be considered. Still, composition engineering is effective to obtain an intrinsically stable perovskite with good properties. For the device stability, proper protection means are also necessary to ensure the robustness of PVSCs. In this section, we introduce some approaches developed so far to address the stability issue of PVSCs, including two main aspects: material and device.
3.1 Stable perovskite materials
The prototypical MAPbI3 is known to suffer a phase transition from cubic to tetragonal at about 55 °C, which has an adverse effect on its performance.175,176 To improve the thermal stability of perovskite, some strategies involve the usage of polymers like polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) to stabilize the cubic MAPbI3 perovskite;177 however, this cannot solve the problem totally. Besides, MAPbI3 is easy to decompose into PbI2 under humidity, heat, light and oxygen.36,178–186 Intriguingly, it is revealed that MAPbI3 may form a hydrate intermediate MAPbI3·H2O before further decomposing into PbI2.183 Some DFT results suggest that the water absorption of MAPbI3 is dramatically influenced by the orientation of the MA cations near the surface.187 For a stable PVSC, a high-quality perovskite film is a primary requirement. Some additives are reported to improve the efficiency and stability of PVSCs simultaneously by improving the perovskite film quality, such as chloride ions and PCBM.188,189
Looking at the cations, FAPbI3, is more thermally stable than MAPbI3 (Fig. 7a), but undergoes a phase transition from black perovskite trigonal α-FAPbI3 to yellow hexagonal δ-FAPbI3 phase in the presence of moisture, due to a large tolerant factor from FA.76,190,193 Fortunately, it turns out that compositional engineering is effective and promising to tackle this problem. MA–FA mixed perovskite shows higher structural stability than pure FA perovskite.194,195 Concerned about the instability of organic cations, a fully inorganic perovskite CsPbBrxI3−x was explored and showed good stability (Fig. 7b).179,196–199 Swarnkar et al. successfully fabricated phase-stable α-CsPbI3 quantum dots solar cells in ambient air and achieved a high efficiency of 10.77%,200 though the α-CsPbI3 was reported only to be stable at high temperature. Moreover, partial substitution of FA with inorganic cation Cs in FA-based perovskites has also been demonstrated to improve the photo and thermal stability of perovskite materials, which was ascribed to the enhanced interaction between FA+ and I− as a result of the contraction of the cubo-octahedral volume (Fig. 7c).191

KGaA. 
As indicated in the decomposition routes, the instability of MAPbI3 perovskite involves the release of the side-product HI due to the decomposition of MAI. Some works showed that replacing part of the iodide with bromide in perovskites allows an improvement in material stability and in tuning the bandgaps of the perovskites.76,151,201,202 Combining the advantages of the FA cation and bromide anion, Jeon and Seok et al. first reported the multi-compositional (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite, exhibiting both good efficiency and good structural stability.41 It became a prototype for high-efficiency perovskite materials.88,192,203 Later, inorganic cations were also incorporated into multiple cation perovskites, such as Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (ref. 89) and Rb0.05[Cs0.05(MA0.17FA0.83)0.95]0.95Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3,75 to improve material and device stability.
The use of a pseudohalogen to partially replace halide has also been explored. Jiang et al. first introduced thiocyanate anions (SCN−), which have a similar radius to iodide, to partially substitute iodide in MAPbI3. The resulting perovskite MAPb(SCN)2I showed comparable efficiency to MAPbI3 but a higher moisture stability due to the stronger interaction between SCN− and Pb2+ (Fig. 7d and e).204 Others suggested that a 2D layered perovskite MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 would be formed instead of a 3D structure, and that it is thermodynamically stable.205–207 Umeyama et al. indicated that MA2Pb(SCN)2I2 is likely to decompose into MAPbI3 under high humidity or annealing conditions, in which case it is more like an intermediate.208 The thiocyanate additive was also found to promote the formation of α-FAPbI3.92
Recently, the development of two-dimensional (2D) perovskites also exhibited a good tendency to improve material stability. For instance, the usage of a large ammonium cation with a hydrophobic group favours the formation of a stable 2D perovskite, but at the sacrifice of efficiency. Smith et al. first introduced C6H5(CH2)2NH3+ (PEA) to make a layered perovskite (PEA)2(MA)2[Pb3I10],209 which was stable under moisture due to the hydrophobic nature of the benzene group. However, the efficiency (4.73%) for layered perovskites was much lower compared to 3D PVSCs (over 20%).
The combination of large ammonium cations, like PEA and CH3(CH2)3NH3+ (BA), with common MA were later found to form mixed-dimensional (quasi-2D) perovskite (RA)2(MA)n−1PbnI3n+1 (RA: PEA or BA), which exhibited improved stability (Fig. 8a). Moreover, the number of inorganic lead iodide sub-layers (n in the chemical formula) in each layer could be easily tuned by simply adjusting the perovskite precursor, as well as their bandgaps.215,216 DFT results implied that a larger n corresponds to a lower formation energy, but makes it easier to decompose into the precursor (Fig. 8b and c).210 Tsai et al. developed a 2D Ruddlesden–Popper perovskite (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 with near-single-crystalline quality, whose preferential growth orientation was perpendicular to the substrate, facilitating the charge transport and therefore dramatically improving the efficiency to 12.52% and retaining high photo and humid stability (Fig. 8d–h).211

Recent strategies, such as multi-compositional perovskites and 2D perovskites, shed light on how to achieve stable materials and devices. Through encouraging, it can be envisioned that tremendous efforts are still needed to generate intrinsically stable perovskites, with possibilities to extend the lifespan of PVSCs into decades.
3.2 Device operational stability
In addition to the material stabilities, a long device lifetime of PVSCs is the ultimate goal. This requires proper means to prevent the water, air and high energy photons getting into the device and destroying the perovskite, and to prevent the degradation of the electrode, thus improving the device stability. First, the application of barrier layers directly onto perovskites and devices has been employed and has shown a positive effect in improving device stability under environmental stresses. Yang et al. introduced hydrophobic ammonium ions as a water-resisting layer to modify the perovskite surface to improve the humidity stability of perovskite materials.217 Bi et al. incorporated an amphiphilic 1,1,1-trifluoro-ethyl ammonium iodide (FEAI) to modify the perovskite surface, which functioned as a moisture-resistant layer due to the hydrophobic CF3 groups (Fig. 9a and b).212 Zhao et al. utilized PEG, a water absorption polymer to prevent water from penetrating into the perovskite, and also to retain the MAI, which showed a self-healing behaviour for perovskite whereby the retained MAI reacts with PbI2 again (Fig. 9d and e).214 Wang et al. used a hydrophobic fluoro-silane layer to protect the underneath perovskite film, making the perovskite film much more stable in water (Fig. 9c).213

KGaA, from ref. 214 Copyright 2016 Nature Publishing Group. 
Interestingly, Bella et al. coated a hydrophobic fluoropolymer as a barrier layer on both the front side and back side of the device to block the permeation of water.218 With the further assistance of luminescent downshifting a fluorescent dye into the front barrier layer, the studied PVSCs showed an improvement in efficiency and light stability, due to the fluorescent dye harvesting ultraviolet light and re-emitting into the visible range, while the fluoropolymer barrier blocks water and air. The PVSCs exhibited high efficiency near 19% and high stability, whereby they could retain 98% of their original efficiency after 6 months of photo and environmental stresses in an ageing test (Fig. 10).

(d) Ageing test on the front/back-coated devices on an outdoor terrace in Italy.218 Adapted with permission from ref. 218 Copyright 2016 American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
Also, it was recently revealed that the erosion of the metal electrode (Ag, Au and Al) upon the reaction with I− and/or HI facilitates the degradation of PVSCs. To address this issue, stable electrodes were introduced. Deng et al. demonstrated that the Cu electrode is stable in efficient PVSCs (Fig. 11a–c).66,86 Domanski et al. intercalated a metal Cr interlayer between HTL and a gold electrode to block the migration of gold into perovskite films, obtaining stable solar cells.219 Back et al. introduced an amine-mediated metal oxide interlayer between PC61BM and silver to prevent the migration of iodide to the electrode, therefore stabilizing the silver electrode.220 Interestingly, Mei et al. reported a fully printable PVSC with a carbon electrode (Fig. 11d).221 It is reported that the carbon electrode not only effectively blocked humidity in the ambient air, but also retained its own stability, eventually leading to stable devices (Fig. 11f). Fully printable PVSC modules were also fabricated,222 which performed well outdoors (Fig. 11e).223

KGaA. 
In this section, we survey recent research related to device stabilities. Some approaches, such as incorporating blocking layers atop of the perovskite, proper device encapsulation and the choice of electrodes, have been developed, in which the principle is to essentially prevent the perovskite from exposure to environmental moisture and UV light.
4. Lead-free perovskite solar cells
It is known that the soluble lead salts in perovskite are toxic upon exposure to humans, and their release in the environment causes pollution.224–226 Although lead is currently allowed in photovoltaic modules, it would be desirable to find alternatives to replace lead halide perovskites in the long run.227 Hence, research into lead-free perovskite is motived. Theoretical studies suggest that the Pb2+ cation plays a significant role in determining the electronic structure of Pb-based perovskites and participates in forming the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) of perovskites, especially the lone pair electrons 6s2 in the Pb2+ ion.228,229 Also, the role of the organic cation in MAPbI3 is to stabilize the perovskite structure and change the lattice constant.230,231
Therefore, it remains a big challenge to find a perfect replacement to the Pb2+ ion without reducing the performance of PVSCs. Lots of effort have been made to screen other common nontoxic divalent metal cations and those cations with a lone pair of electrons in the outer s orbitals like Bi3+. Another solution is to develop new derivatives with potential competence for Pb-based perovskites. In this section, we review the recent progress made in lead-free perovskites.
4.1 Tin-based perovskite
Sn is the most extensively explored substituent to Pb because it is in the same periodic group and has outer lone pair electrons. The Pb in MAPbI3 can be fully replaced by Sn to form MASnI3. However, Sn2+ has poor chemical stability and is easily oxidized to Sn4+. Compared to MAPbI3, MASnI3 has a broader absorption to 950 nm,232 corresponding to a narrower bandgap. Noel et al. achieved the highest efficiency of 6.4% for MASnI3-based mesoporous PVSCs,233 which is behind that of Pb-based PVSCs.234,235 Given the instability of Sn, Sn-based PVSCs usually have poor performance and reproducibility. In order to alleviate the oxidization of MASnI3, Hoshi et al. introduced HOOC(CH2)4NH3I (5-AVAI) into MASnI3 to alleviate the oxidization of Sn2+ in order to improve the device stability.236 Koh et al. incorporated SnF2 into FASnI3 to improve the film morphology as well as to retard the oxidization of Sn2+.237 SnF2 additive can also reduce the defect concentrations in CsSnI3 for a high photocurrent.238 Lee et al. used SnF2–pyrazine complex to further improve the morphology of FASnI3. Consequently, they achieved an efficiency of 4.8% and the capsulated device also showed improved stability.239
Sn-Based perovskite can be easily tuned by adjusting the perovskite composition. For instance, the bandgap of MASnBrxI3−x gradually increases as the content of bromide increases. Also no obvious correlation was found between the ion radius and bandgap for ASnI3 (A: Cs, MA, FA), while the bandgap of APbI3 decreases as the radius of A increases.240 Although inorganic CsSnI3 is reported to be more stable, its efficiency is only 3.56% and still includes the chemically unstable Sn2+, which presents obstacle for its real applications.232,241,242 The Cs2SnX6 perovskite (X: I, Br, Cl) has also been scrutinized, and has a discrete [SnI6]2− octahedral with a Sn4+ centre, while half of the Sn ions in MASnI3 are missing (Fig. 12a). Cs2SnX6 has a direct bandgap of ∼1.3 eV and is much more stable than MASnI3, because Sn4+ is chemically stable. Nevertheless, it is an n-type semiconductor, which may be more suitable as an ETM for solar cells.243

Since the pure Sn-based perovskite is instable, mixed Sn–Pb perovskites would be a better choice. Zuo et al. reported mixed MASn1−xPbxI3 PVSCs and achieved a highest efficiency of 10.1% when the content of Sn was 15%.244 Notably, the bandgap of MASn1−xPbxI3 perovskite is narrower than both pristine MASnI3 and MAPbI3 perovskites (Fig. 12b).156 The TD-DFT calculation indicates that the bandgap of MASn1−xPbxI3 should decrease as x (x < 0.5) increases because of the stronger spin–orbit coupling of Pb, while the bandgap of MASn1−xPbxI3 should increase as x (x > 0.5) increases owing to the phase transition from P4mm to I4cm at x >0.5. These opposite trends give the MASn1−xPbxI3 perovskite an abnormal bandgap behaviour.245 Moreover, Im et al. also found that the electronic structures of MASn1−xPbxI3 would be more similar to MASnI3 rather than MAPbI3 in cases where x is smaller than 0.875.245
4.2 Bismuth-based perovskite
Recently, Bi-based perovskites have also drawn great attention, and have the chemical formula of A3Bi3I9 (A: MA, Cs).246–250 The perovskite form discrete two face-sharing octahedra Bi3I93− with the cation A+ occupying the space between them, which actually makes it a zero-dimension (0D) perovskite (Fig. 13a and b). Hoye et al. demonstrated that MA3Bi3I9 (MBI) is more stable than MAPbI3 (Fig. 13c).251 In contrast to that of MAPbI3, MBI did not degrade to BiI3 in humid air by forming a surface layer that did not increase the recombination rate. Park et al. first reported the application of Bi-based perovskite materials in solar cells and obtained efficiencies of 0.12% and 1.09% for MBI and Cs3Bi3I9, respectively.252 Zhang et al. fabricated MBI on an ITO/planar TiO2/mesoporous TiO2 substrate and achieved an efficiency of 0.42%.253 All the Bi-based PVSCs have a small Jsc, which may be ascribed to the lack of a continuous structural network. Other Bi-based perovskites A3Bi3I9 (A: K, Rh, NH4+) were investigated as well, which, unlike MBI, have a 2D structure.248,249 However, no application in PVSCs for these 2D materials has been reported yet.

KGaA. 
Other derivatives, such as halide double perovskites Cs2AgBiX6 (X: Br, Cl)254–257 and (MA)2KBiCl6,258 have also been developed, whose structure is similar to elpasolites (Fig. 13d). Both Cs2AgBiBr6 and Cs2AgBiCl6 are indirect bandgap semiconductors, with bandgaps of 2.19 eV and 2.77 eV, respectively.254 (MA)2KBiCl6, however, has a large bandgap of 3.04 eV, which cannot be applied in solar cells. Some DFT calculations implied that (MA)2TlBiI6 is a potential lead-free perovskite material due to its similar property to MAPbI3.259 However, Tl is also very toxic, which is against the original intention for substituting lead. Kim et al. reported bimetal iodide AgBi2I7,255 whose structure was a combination of AgI6 octahedra and BiI8 hexahedra (Fig. 13e–g). This material could form a film with good morphology and its highest efficiency was 1.22%. Besides, it showed excellent stability under an ambient environment. Fabian et al. recently reported another bismuth-iodide-based perovskite HDABiI5 (HDA: 1,6-hexanediammonium), with higher thermal stability, which also had poor efficiency (0.027%).260
4.3 Other metals
Apart from the extensive investigation of Sn and Bi, some other metal cations have also been explored, mainly in IIA, IV and V groups. Krishnamoorthy et al. used DFT calculations to map all divalent cations of the form AMX3 (A: K, Rb, Cs; X: Cl, Br, I; M: 40 kinds of divalent cations) to scrutinize their bandgap and thermodynamic stability.261 The results showed that only RbSnBr3, CsSnBr3 and CsGeI3 were suitable to apply in solar cells, and of these, CsGeI3 had the most ideal bandgap of 1.6 eV. Unfortunately, solar cells based on CsGeI3 have a poor efficiency of 0.20% with a low Voc. Körbel et al. studied 32000 potential perovskites by screening the whole periodic table and found a similar result, namely that only group IV halides are promising for photovoltaics.262 For the organic–inorganic perovskite AGeI3, its bandgap increases as the radius of A+ increases. Among MAGeX3 (X: Cl, Br, I), MAGeI3 has the most potential due to it having similar properties to MAPbI3.263 However, Ge2+ is even more sensitive to oxygen than Sn2+, which is not practical for its application. Similar to bismuth, antimony-based perovskite Cs3Sb3I9 was also investigated, which, different from MBI, is a 2D layer perovskite rather than a 0D perovskite (Fig. 14a and b).264 This material is a red powder with a bandgap of 2.05 eV. Although the DFT results imply that the VBM and CBM of Cs3Sb3I9 are similar to MAPbI3, it possesses deep trap states, thus rendering a bad performance of its devices.

The divalent cations Sr2+ and Ca2+ in the IIA group can also form perovskites, which should be much more chemically stable than Sn2+ and Ge2+. However, both CH3NH3SrI3 and CH3NH3CaI3 have a large bandgap above 3.5 eV.265,266 The DFT calculations imply that the lack of lone pair electrons in the outer s orbital in the case of Sr2+ and Ca2+ makes their electronic structure and bandgap be dramatically different from MAPbI3.265,266
Another kind of lead-free perovskite reported is the Cu-based perovskite (RNH3)2CuX4 (X: Br, Cl). According to the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, Cu-based perovskite can only form a 2D perovskite owing to the smaller radius of the Cu2+ cation. Besides, due to the redox reaction between Cu2+ and I−, no cupric iodide perovskite can be formed. Cui et al.267 reported two 2D perovskites, (p-F-C6H5C2H4-NH3)2CuBr4 and (CH3(CH2)3NH3)2-CuBr4, and obtained efficiencies of 0.51% and 0.63% for solar cells based on them. Cortecchia et al.268 fabricated a solar cell based on MA2CuClxBr4−x with an efficiency of 0.017%. Also, they found that the octahedra CuX6 would distort because of the Jahn–Teller effect, resulting in a worse performance (Fig. 14c). Moreover, the reduction of Cu2+ may also be a problem. Even though incorporating a small amount of CuBr2 into MAPbI3 was proved to be able to improve the morphology and efficiency, whether Cu2+ could actually substitute part of Pb2+ is unclear.269
The recent studies of lead-free perovskite materials have implied that the performance of PVSCs is very sensitive to the presence of Pb2+ ions, such that with the simple substitution of lead by other metal cations, new perovskites generally show a significant decline in device efficiency. Only mixed Pb–Sn perovskites can retain a fairly high efficiency. A perovskite with mixed metal cations and halide double perovskites with a 3D structure should have good performance in terms of charge transport, but more research is needed. Overall, there are many identified and more unidentified challenges to be addressed on the development of lead-free materials with a competitive performance to those of Pb-based perovskites.
5. Conclusions and perspectives
In conclusion, rapid progress in PVSCs has been achieved, resulting in the improved PCEs from 3.8% to 22.1% in just 7 years, which is a feat not witnessed with other solar cell technologies. A great number of research efforts have been devoted to address a variety of issues for advancing PVSCs. Due to the limited space of this review article, we have focused on mainly three aspects of the recent progress made for PVSCs, namely: high efficiency, stability and lead-free issues. Currently, the high efficiency levels of PVSCs have reached the level required to validate its practical relevance in solar-to-electricity conversion, but still device operational stability and scale-up strategies remain as challenges to be overcome. On the other hand, the use of environmentally benign materials would be desirable to replace lead halide perovskites with materials with comparable performance in the long run. We suggest that more efforts need to be made on the integrative exploration of the above issues in order to accomplish high-performance, stable and low-cost PVSCs.
As for the PVSC efficiency, this is the outcome of the fine tuning of the perovskite itself, film formation and the interface as well as the device architecture. Currently, although the highest certified PCE of PVSCs surpasses 22% in small areas, continuous efforts are needed in order to fabricate a large-area high-quality perovskite film with good reproducibility, and to clarify the design rule for efficient perovskite composition. In the meanwhile, multifunctional interfacial materials are also desired, especially for those that can interplay with the perovskite crystal growth and ensure defects passivation, as well as providing the function of acting as protection barriers for the perovskites. Tandem devices that combine cost-effective PVSCs with low-bandgap silicon or CIGS solar cells may be suitable for further improving the current efficiency ceilings, as well as an option for deploying PVSCs into communities to work complementary with the established solar cell technologies.
The concerns on efficiency have been alleviated now, but stability and the toxicity of lead remain big challenges. The chemical and structural instability of perovskite materials are the main culprits for the vulnerability of the device operational stabilities. The compositional engineering of perovskites showed that encouraging progress has been made to address such issues. Although some materials are fairly stable within a few months, there is still a way to go to fabricate them and the related devices to keep them stable for potentially decades under environmental stresses. Can suitable ion substituents and/or 2D perovskites enhance the stability of materials without sacrificing efficiency? More delicate studies are needed. Device approaches, such as blocking layers and encapsulation, are also needed to tackle these issues. With optimism in mind, the stabilities of PVSCs may eventually allow reaching the prerequisites for practical application.
Currently, studies of lead-free perovskites have implied that the simple substitution of lead by other metal cations in new perovskites usually lead to a decline in device efficiency. Although Sn–Pb-based perovskites promise a fairly high efficiency, Sn faces unstable issues and some reports indicate that Sn even has a larger impact on humans and the environment than Pb.224,225 Alternatively, Bi-based halide double perovskite would be worth paying more attention to, because it has a 3D structure with good stability, as well as Bi displays a similar electronic structure to Pb. To address the environmental issues of PVSCs, attention can also be directed to developing excellent encapsulation and recycling of PVSCs for avoiding the leakage of lead. So as can be seen, to develop lead-free perovskites with high efficiency, there remain significant challenges.
Overall, it is very encouraging to reveal that significant progress has already been achieved for PVSCs, especially in the aspects of developing high-efficiency devices and stable materials. More efforts are still needed on the integrative exploration combining innovative materials, devices and scale-up strategies to further advance PVSCs, in order to accomplish stable and practical solar-to-electricity conversion with perovskites.
