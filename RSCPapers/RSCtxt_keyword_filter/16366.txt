    , Accepted 6th June 2017First published on 6th June 2017AbstractIn this study, tris-heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers denoted as SD-15 and SD-16 with a 4,4′,5,5′-tetramethyl-1H,1′H-2,2′-bis-imidazole moiety as the ancillary ligand were designed, synthesized and characterized using FTIR-ATR, 1H-NMR and UV-vis spectrophotometry. Structural modulations resulted in a red shift in the low-energy metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption peak. The novel bis-imidazole based Ru(II) sensitizer was adsorbed on a TiO2 surface via –COOH anchoring groups. The band gap, and the ground and excited state oxidation potentials were measured. The photovoltaic performance of the as-fabricated solar cells was measured and showed that the presence of bis-imidazole provided more negative free energy for dye regeneration (−ΔGregeneration) and less driving force for electron injection (−ΔGinjection) into the conduction band edge of TiO2. Therefore, the use of SD-15 and SD-16 resulted in lower JSC values of 10.20 and 3.52 mA cm−2, respectively, than N719. The open-circuit photovoltage (VOC) of SD-15 and SD-16 was 0.58 and 0.52 V, respectively, less than N719 under the same experimental conditions due to the decreased eTiO2 lifetime of 0.71 ms compared to 8.8 ms of N719 for the injected electrons that was calculated using impedance measurements. Our efforts in this research program led to the development of more stable Ru(II) complexes compared to N719 NCS-based complexes; however, the conversion efficiency was lower. Hence, the fine-tuning of bi-imidazole is needed to identify more efficient NCS-free Ru(II) sensitizers for higher efficiency DSSCs.
1. Introduction
In recent years, efforts have been made to explore efficient ways to harness sunlight. Solar energy is getting exceptional attention, which indicates quick advancement, particularly in the field of photovoltaics, opening up new horizons in research and innovation for utilizing renewable energy sources.1 One of the major advancements in the photovoltaics field is dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), introduced by O'Regan and Grätzel in 1991.2 They have gained considerable attention because of their low-cost fabrication processes and the fact that they can work at more extensive edges and under low light conditions.3 The sensitizer (dye molecules) is a key component of DSSCs, as it absorbs light from the visible region and then initiates the movement of electrons from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the dyes.4
Although DSSCs show moderate to good efficiencies, the long-term stability of solar devices is not promising.5 Sensitizers can undergo degradation quickly owing to the presence of the thiocyanate (–NCS) moiety, thus lowering the lifetime of the solar devices.6 A number of sensitizers have been tested, including N719, N3 and black dye,7,8 but they are also very unstable due to the labile nature of the thiocyanate moiety present in the as-reported sensitizers.9,10 To enhance the long-term stability of solar devices, a number of attempts have been made to prepare thiocyanate (–NCS) free sensitizers.11,12 Such sensitizers offer extended and enhanced structural stability to devices; for example, pyrid-2-yl pyrazolate or triazolate,13,14 pyridyl-azolate,15 pyrid-2-yltetrazolate,16 8-oxyquinolate,17,18 and dianionic bipyrazolate19 based solar devices showed moderate to good efficiencies (1.3 to 9.6%), thus they pave the way to explore and design better and efficient thiocyanate free sensitizers.
Recently, H. Cheema et al. reported a thiocyanate-free ruthenium dye (HD-11) with the addition of 3-trifluoromethyl pyrazole10 that showed a %η value of up to 5.2%. Similarly, C. P. Berlinguette and co-workers tested phenylpyridine (ppy)20 as a thiocyanate-free sensitizer in a DSSC and the molecular structures of both of the dyes are shown in Fig. 1. In this work, we report bi-imidazole based thiocyanate free ruthenium sensitizers, as shown in Fig. 2, and, to the best of our knowledge, these have not been investigated in the literature for DSSC applications.

The as-prepared SD-15 and SD-16 compounds were characterized using FTIR and 1H-NMR spectroscopy. The photophysical and electrochemical characterizations were carried using UV-visible spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry. Impedance spectroscopy was used to study the charge recombination resistance and electron lifetime at the dye/TiO2 interface. The IPCE and I–V graphs for the solar cells sensitized with SD-15 and SD-16 were measured under 1 sun illumination with similar conditions.
2. Experimental
2.1. Materials and equipment
All of the chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fisher Scientific or TCI-America and were used as received. Silica (230–400 mesh, Grade 60) for the purification of the dyes was purchased from Fischer Scientific. FT-IR (ATR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet Nexus 470 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and UV-visible spectra were measured using a Cary 300 spectrophotometer. The mass spectrometry analysis was carried out using a high-resolution mass spectrometer – the Thermo Fisher Scientific Executive Plus MS, a bench top full-scan Orbitrap™ mass spectrometer using electro-spray ionization (ESI). The samples were dissolved in methanol, sonicated for 15 minutes, and then diluted in a 1:1 ratio with 20 mM ammonium acetate and analyzed via syringe injection into the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 10 μL min−1. 1H-NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker 500 MHz spectrometer. A Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon Inc.) was used to measure the fluorescence at room temperature.
2.2. Synthesis of the thiocyanate-free tris-heteroleptic Ru(II) sensitizers
The synthesis of both of the ancillary ligands was carried out according to the procedure reported in the literature using a Knoevenagel condensation type reaction. The detailed synthetic procedures for the proposed thiocyanate-free tris-heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complexes SD-15 & SD-16 can be found in the ESI.† A typical three step one pot procedure was employed to synthesize the proposed sensitizers according to the reported literature.10 The yields of the crude products were in the range 65–70%, and the products were purified through a silica column two times to get a highly pure product in 45–50% yield. The pure product was then characterized using FTIR and 1H-NMR.

2.3. Time correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) measurements
Fluorescence spectra were recorded in a 1 cm path length quartz cell using 2 × 10−5 M solutions on a Fluorolog-311. The emitted light was detected in the steady state mode using a Hamamatsu R2658 detector. The emission was measured in the steady state mode by exciting at the MLCT λmax value for each dye with exit and entrance slits set at 11 nm with 0.1 s of integration time.
2.4. Ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) and excited state oxidation potential (ESOP) measurements
The experimental HOMO and E0–0 energy values for SD-15 and SD-16 were measured using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and the absorption onset, respectively. The CV was carried out in DMF with 0.1 M [TBA][PF6]− as an electrolyte at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1. Glassy carbon was used as the working electrode (WE), Pt wire was used as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ in acetonitrile was used as the reference electrode. Fc/Fc+ was used as an internal reference, and the voltage that was measured was converted to NHE by the addition of 0.63 V. Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†) show the CV graphs of all of the sensitizers.
2.5. TiO2 electrode preparation and device fabrication
The photo-anodes composed of nanocrystalline TiO2 and counter electrodes were prepared using procedures in the literature.21 Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glasses (2.2 mm thickness and a sheet resistance of 8 Ω cm−2, TEC 8, Pilkington) were washed with detergent, deionized water, dry acetone and absolute ethanol, sequentially. After this, the FTO glass plates were immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed with water and ethanol. A thin layer (8–12 mm thick) of TiO2 (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was deposited (active area, 0.18 cm2) on transparent conducting glass by squeegee printing. After drying the electrodes at 500 °C for 30 min, a scattering layer (5 mm thick) of TiO2 particles (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide R/SP) was printed. The TiO2 electrodes were heated under an airflow at 350 °C for 10 min, followed by heating at 500 °C for 30 min. After cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 electrodes were treated with a 40 mM aqueous solution of TiCl4 at 70 °C for 30 min and then washed with water and ethanol. The electrodes were heated again at 500 °C for 30 min and left to cool to 80 °C before dipping into the dye solution. The dye solutions (0.3 mM) were prepared in 1:1:1 acetonitrile, tert-butyl alcohol and DMSO. Deoxycholic acid was added to the dye solution as a coadsorbate at a concentration of 20 mM. The electrodes were immersed in the dye solutions with the active area facing up and were then kept at 25 °C for 20 h to adsorb the dye onto the TiO2 surface.
For preparing the counter electrode, pre-cut TCO glasses were washed with water followed by 0.1 M HCl in EtOH, and sonication was performed in an acetone bath for 10 min. These washed TCO glasses were then dried at 400 °C for 15 min. A thin layer of Pt-paste (Solaronix, Platisol T/SP) was printed on the TCO glasses and the printed electrodes were then cured at 450 °C for 10 min. The dye sensitized TiO2 electrodes were sandwiched with Pt counter electrodes and the electrolyte (Solaronix, Iodolyte AN-50) was then injected into the cell, while the two electrodes were held together with clips.
2.6. Photo-electrochemical measurements
The photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs were measured using a Keithley 2400 source meter under an illumination of AM 1.5G solar light from a solar simulator (SOL3A, Oriel) equipped with a 450 W xenon lamp (91160, Oriel). The incident light intensity was calibrated using a reference Si solar cell (Newport Oriel, 91150V) set to 1 sun (100 mW cm−2). The measurement was fully controlled using Oriel IV Test Station software. IPCE (incident monochromatic photon to current conversion efficiency) experiments were carried out using a system (QEX10, PV NO Measurements, USA) equipped with a 75 W short arc xenon lamp (UXL-75XE, USHIO, Japan) as the light source connected to a monochromator. The calibration of the incident light was performed before taking the measurements using a silicone photodiode (IF035, PV Measurements). All of the measurements were carried out without the use of an anti-reflecting film.
2.7. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
The electrochemical impedance spectra were measured using an impedance analyzer potentiostat (Bio-Logic SP-150) under illumination using a solar simulator (SOL3A, Oriel) equipped with a 450 W-xenon lamp (91160, Oriel). The EIS spectra were recorded over a frequency range of 100 mHz–200 kHz at room temperature. The applied bias voltage was set at the VOC value of the DSSCs, with the AC amplitude set at 10 mV. The electrical impedance spectra were fitted using Z-Fit software (Bio-Logic).
3. Results & discussion
The synthesis of the proposed tris-heteroleptic ruthenium(II) complexes was carried out according to an already reported procedure10 in a typical three step one pot method.

The structural modification of N719 by the replacement of NCS with bi-imidazole along with carbazole and triphenyl amino ancillary ligands resulted in the red shifted absorption spectra of SD-15 and SD-16, respectively. The red shift in the absorption spectra was caused by the stabilizing effect of bi-imidazole on both the HOMO and LUMO. The HOMO destabilization was expected with the introduction of strong electron donating carbazole and triphenyl amino groups as the ancillary ligands.22,23 The tuning of the ground state oxidation potential is depicted in Fig. 4. The dominant role of bi-imidazole in stabilizing the ground state can be attributed to the substantial delocalization of the HOMO on the NCS part as found previously using DFT calculations.

3.2. Electrochemical measurements
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to measure and compare the ground state oxidation potential (GSOP) of SD-15 and SD-16 in solution. A CV graph (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI†) was used to calculate the oxidation onset, which is equivalent to the GSOP (ground state oxidation potential). Additionally, E0–0 was calculated from the onset of the absorption. The values of E0–0 and GSOP were used to calculate the ESOP (excited state oxidation potential), and the values in volts (V) against NHE were converted to electron volts (eV) according to eqn (1). ESOP = [(GSOP (V) + 4.7) − E0−0 eV](1)The GSOP and ESOP for SD-15, SD-16 and N719 are compared in Fig. 4 and Table 2. The GSOP potential of SD-15 (−5.8 eV) was lower in energy compared to the I3/I− redox couple (−5.2 eV or −0.5 V vs. NHE),24 thus providing an ample driving force for efficient dye regeneration. The ESOP of SD-15, SD-16 and N719 was 0.31, 0.40 and 0.43 eV higher in energy, respectively, than the conduction band edge of semiconductor nanocrystalline TiO2 (−4.2 eV),25 which is expected to result in efficient electron injection for N719. It was found that the electron injection free energy for SD-15 and SD-16 was 0.31 and 0.4 eV, respectively, since the lowest energy difference between the ESOP and the TiO2 conduction band for efficient electron injection is not precisely determined, but is usually expected to be more than 0.15 eV.26 Hence, the electron injection free energies of both of the tris-heteroleptic Ru(II) complexes were thermodynamically favorable.

3.3. Photovoltaic device characterizations
Photovoltaic characterizations were carried out in order to establish the structure–property relationship with the replacement of NCS and the influence of the change in the energy levels of SD-15 and SD-16 on the solar cells; the photocurrent action spectra for SD-15 and SD-16 are shown in Fig. 5 and the details about the solar cell preparation and assembly are given in the ESI.† A higher IPCE response was recorded for SD-15 than SD-16 due to the presence of the strong electron donating carbazole moiety. An incident photon to current conversion efficiency (IPCE) response of higher than 40% from 400 nm to 600 nm was exhibited by SD-15. SD-15 showed higher molar absorptivity in solution, however the absorbed photons were not translated to the photocurrent, which can be attributed to a lower thermodynamic free energy of the electron injection. However, it can be concluded based on the IPCE results that the electron injection free energy should be higher than 0.15 eV in order to get efficient electron injection.26
 Fig. 5  IPCE spectra obtained with dyes SD-15 and SD-16 anchored on nanocrystalline TiO2 film. 
The I–V characteristics of the solar devices prepared from SD-15 and SD-16 are shown in Fig. 6. The better IPCE response of SD-15 corresponded to a higher JSC of 10.20 mA cm−2 compared to 3.52 mA cm−2 for SD-16. A lower JSC for both SD-15 and SD-16 than N719 is attributed to a low free energy for electron injection into the conduction band of TiO2.
 Fig. 6  Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of DSSCs sensitized with Ru-complexes SD-15 and SD-16. 
Solar cells with SD-15 gave an overall power conversion efficiency (%η) of 3.3 with a VOC of 0.58 V and an ff of 0.56, and solar cells with SD-16 gave a %η of 1.0 with a VOC of 0.52 V and an ff of 0.58 compared to a %η of 7.7 for N719 (VOC = 0.77 V and ff = 0.71). The fundamental energy loss or loss of potential in a solar cell can be calculated by following the relation as discussed previously:27Potential loss in a solar cell = Energy of charge generating photon − VOC obtained from solar cell.The energy of the charge generating photons can be calculated from the onset of the IPCE spectra, which was 1.57 eV for N719 and 1.70 and 1.97 eV for SD-15 and SD-16, respectively. The potential loss for the SD-15 and SD-16 based solar cells was 1.12 and 1.45 V, respectively, compared to 0.80 V for N719. Hence, though both of the ruthenium(II) complexes have much better UV/vis absorption properties (Fig. 3), their ground and excited state energy levels are not favorably positioned to result in efficient electron injection and dye regeneration as is evident from Fig. 4 and 5 and the potential loss calculations in the solar cells.
The photovoltaic parameters including the short-circuit photo-current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC), fill factors (ffs) and overall cell efficiencies (%η) are summarized in Table 3.

3.4. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy characterization
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) successfully models the charge transfer and chemical capacitance at the interface of TiO2/dye/electrolyte and Pt/electrolyte in DSSCs under operational conditions.10,28–31 Typical EIS measurements result in Nyquist and Bode plots.
In Nyquist plots, a high frequency semicircle can be correlated with charge transfer at the counter electrode and the intermediate frequency is related to the electron transport through mesoporous TiO2 and back electron transfer from TiO2 to the electrolyte.28–32 Grätzel et al. discussed the sizes of these semicircles, saying that the bigger the radius of the middle semicircle, the higher the charge recombination resistance (Rct) from TiO2 to the electrolyte corresponding to Nernst impedance, whereas the radius of the same semicircle corresponds to the resistance of charge diffusion (Rd) under Gerischer impedance.28,33 In the EIS Nyquist plots (Fig. 7), two semicircles were observed. The small semicircle at lower frequency models the cathode charge transfer resistance, which is directly related to the ff. In an efficient solar cell, the Nernst impedance or Rct is greater than Rd as observed for N719,28 whereas Rd is greater than Rct for the SD-15 based solar cell and SD-16 has only one semicircle. The intermediate impedance semicircle for SD-15 can be assigned to Gerischer impedance due to the fact that the VOC obtained by employing SD-15 was less than that of N719, whereas a higher Rct results in a higher VOC, as observed previously.31
 Fig. 7  EIS Nyquist plots for DSSCs sensitized with SD-15 and SD-16. 
In the Bode frequency plot (Fig. 8), the lifetime for the injected electrons into the TiO2 conduction band can be determined using the formula , where τ is the lifetime of the electrons in TiO2 and f is the mid frequency peak in the Bode plots. The frequency peak of the DSSCs based on SD-15 and SD-16 was 224 Hz whereas it was only 18 Hz for N719, corresponding to an eTiO2 of 0.71 ms and 8.8 ms, respectively, and thus resulting in a lower VOC for both SD-15 and SD-16 (shorter eTiO2) compared to N719, which correlates well with the actual VOC reported for the solar cells, respectively. A higher Rd and a shorter eTiO2 for SD-15 and SD-16 can be attributed to a lower free energy of electron injection resulting in shorter diffusion compared to N719 and the strong electron withdrawing nature of the HOMO due to the presence of the bi-imidazole moiety.

4. Conclusions
Two novel tris-heteroleptic thiocyanate-free Ru(II) complexes based on the bi-imidazole moiety along with carbazole in SD-15 and the triphenyl amino group in SD-16 were successfully synthesized and characterized for DSSCs. The presence of the strong electron-donating carbazole and triphenyl with bi-imidazole in the ruthenium(II) sensitizers resulted in a red shift of the low energy MLCT and higher molar absorptivity compared to that of N719. The different ligands in the complexes changed the overall characteristics of the ruthenium complexes. SD-15 gave the highest solar-to-power conversion efficiency of 3.32% under AM1.5 irradiation and the efficiency performance is in good agreement with the molar absorptivity data. This study suggests that the bi-imidazole chromophore opens up an alternative route to afford a good class of NCS-free Ru(II) complexes for DSSC research based on ruthenium metal. More research needs to be done to fine-tune the molecular structure of bi-imidazole for the development of higher efficiency sensitizers.
