    , Accepted 1st September 2010First published on 30th September 2010AbstractA strategic side-chain engineering approach leads to the two orders of magnitude enhancement of charge carrier mobility in phenanthrene based fused aromatic thienopyrazine polymers. Hole carrier mobility up to 0.012 cm2/Vs can be obtained in thin film transistor devices. Polymers were also utilized to fabricate bulk heterojunction photovoltaic devices and the maximum PCE obtained in these OPV's was 1.15%. Most importantly, performances of the devices were correlated with thin morphological analysis performed by atomic force microscopy and grazing incidence X-ray scattering.
1. Introduction

Polymer semiconducting materials are being investigated thoroughly for several electronics applications, such as organic photovoltaics (OPV), organic thin-film transistors (OTFT),1–7 and others.8–12 Different classes of low band gap polymers, including donor–acceptor copolymers are studied in this regard. Although materials for OPV1,13 and OTFT6,14–16 devices demand different design rules considering polymer structure and device performance, some polymers, for example poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT)14,17–19 and poly(2,5-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-2yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (pBTTT),20,21 have been successful in both applications. These polymers have relatively simple structures and thus detailed understanding of the molecular packing followed by device optimization was feasible. However, molecular packing of most of the conjugated polymers, such as donor–acceptor polymers,22–26 is more complex and thus the improvement of the device performance is usually accomplished via numerous cycles of device optimization. The use of long alkyl side-chains has been a common approach to improve the solubility of conjugated polymers in organic solvents, which is a requirement for solution processing of these materials. The type of alkyl chains impacts on the optoelectronic properties of the polymers.27 The linear alkyl chains usually promote the crystallinity of the polymers and help to improve the charge carrier mobility in OTFT applications.20,27 Although high charge carrier mobility is desirable for a solar cell, high crystallinity of the polymers sometimes promotes large-scale or macro-phase separation between the polymer and acceptor materials such as [6,6]-phenyl C61butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) which are blended together to form the photoactive layer. Such gross phase segregation reduces the efficiency of solar cells.28
Recently, we have reported electron-deficient fused aromatic thienopyrazine (TP) units for donor–acceptor type conjugated polymers.27,29 The fused TP unit provides a planar π-face that enhances π–π stacking between the polymeric chains.30,31 It was shown that field-effect mobility as high as 0.2 cm2/Vs can be achieved using acenaphthyl thienopyrazine type copolymers with linear alkyl chains (dodecyl).27 However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) was limited to only 0.39% for that polymer. The PCE was improved to 1.4% with the identical polymer backbone by introducing branched alkyl chains (2-ethylhexyl). Later, the band-gap of the polymer was significantly reduced (1.4 eV) by replacing the fused aromatic unit from acenaphthyl to phenanthrene in the TP unit to achieve higher absorption in the near IR region of the solar spectrum. However, performance of the polymer was poor in both OPV and OTFT devices.
In this paper, we report strategic side-chain engineering of the phenanthrene based low band gap polymer (EHPH-EHF)29 to improve the charge carrier mobility in thin film transistor devices. First, 2-ethylhexyl side-chains are moved away from thiophene units of the polymer main chain to promote the planarity of the backbone. Further those branched alkyl chains are replaced by linear alkyl chains (Chart 1). The synthesis of such polymers and their performance in OTFT devices are discussed.

3,6-Dibromophenanthrene-9,10-dione (9.0 g, 24.6 mmol) was dissolved in 200 mL of dry 1,2-dichlorobenzene. 25 mL of dry ethylene glycol and pyridinium p-toluenesulfonate (2.5 g, 10 mmol) were added and refluxed for 12–15 h under inert atm. Cooling down the reaction mixture in a refrigerator resulted a white precipitate, which was filtered out and washed with water to remove any residual sulfonate and ethylene glycol.

3. Results and discussion
3.1 Synthesis of monomers and polymers

3,6-Dibromophenanthrene-9,10-dione (3) was synthesized following a procedure reported earlier. The ketone groups of compound 3 were protected with ethylene glycol to form 7,10-dibromo-2,3-dihydro-4a,12b-(epoxyethanoxy)phenanthro[9,10-b]-1,4-dioxin (4). Grignard alkylation catalyzed by Pd(dppf)Cl2 followed by deprotection of ketones yielded 3,6-dialkylphenanthrene-9,10-dione (6a and 6b), Scheme 1. 2,5-Bis-5-bromothiophene-2-yl-thiophene-3,4-diamine (7) was synthesized according to a reported procedure. Condensation between diamine 7 and diones (6a or 6b) yields 10,12-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-3,6-di(2-ethylhexyl)dibenzo[f,h]thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline (1) and 10,12-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-3,6-didodecyldibenzo[f,h]thieno[3,4-b]quinoxaline (2), respectively, Scheme 2. Polymer EHPH-EHF is reported earlier and considered here for comparison. PHEH-EHF and PHD-DF were synthesized from compounds 1 and 2, respectively, via Suzuki polycondensation reaction as shown in Scheme 3 and purified by precipitation in methanol followed by washing with acetone and hexane (see experimental section for details). These polymers were end-capped with phenyl groups.

3.2 Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical and electrochemical properties of the polymers were investigated in ODCB and in thin films as summarized in Table 1. The absorption spectra of the thin films of the EHPH-EHF, PHEH-EHF, and PHD-DF are compared in Fig. 1. The optical gap (absorption onset) and the absorption coefficients are not significantly affected by the position of the alkyl chains or the type of alkyl chains. Electrochemical HOMO–LUMO gaps, as determined from the cyclic voltammetry experiments, are also almost constant (1.34–1.40 eV). Absorption coefficients are ∼3.5 × 104 cm−1 in the thin films of these phenanthrene-based FLcopolymers. However, the HOMO and LUMO energies become deeper by moving the alkyl side chains from the polymer backbone, which is desired to achieve higher open circuit voltages (Voc) in polymer/PCBM based solar cells. In the solution, HOMO energies of PHEH-EHF and PHD-DF are deeper by ∼0.1 eV compared to EHPH-EHF. The corresponding value is ∼0.2–0.3 eV in the thin films, indicating significant impact on the twisting angle in thin films depending on the position of the alkyl chains. However, the absorption spectra did not change in the thin films compared to the solution. The band gap in such polymers can be further reduced (Eg∼1.3 eV) by introducing benzodithiophene units, the thiophene analogs of phenanthrene.33

These polymers have good thermal stability and the decomposition temperatures are >400 °C as measured using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). No thermal transition was observed in the range from 0 °C to 350 °C in the Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) measurements, although these polymers form crystalline domains in the thin film (vide infra). However, the absence any features in DSC might be due to poor ordering.
3.3 Field-effect transistor characterization
The mobility of charge carriers (holes and electrons) in semiconducting polymers determines their applicability in transistors and other electronic devices. High charge-carrier mobilities can lead to increased on-currents and faster switching speeds in transistors. In solar cell architectures, polymers with higher charge carrier mobilities carry photogenerated holes more efficiently and can enhance the photocurrent that leads to a higher power conversion efficiency provided the electron-carrying material also has a high charge carrier (electron) mobility. Top-contact OTFTs were fabricated to measure the field-effect mobilities of these polymers. Polymer solutions in toluene were drop-cast onto octadecyltrimethoxysilane (OTS)-treated, heavily-doped, n-type SiO2 (300 nm)/Si wafers. The average thicknesses of the dropcast polymer films were ∼30 nm. The thin films were annealed at different temperatures and gold electrodes (40 nm) were deposited through shadow masks. Electrical performance was tested under dry N2 atmosphere (glovebox) and under ambient conditions. The results from optimized OTFTs for each polymer are summarized in Table 2. Representative current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of OTFT devices fabricated from PHD-DF are shown in Fig. 2.

Polymer
EHPH-EHF had the charge carrier (hole) mobility in the order of 10−4 cm2/Vs. In order to enhance the planarity of the polymer backbone and thus to enhance the charge carrier mobility, 2-ethylhexyl side chains were moved to the phenanthrene part of the polymer in PHEH-EHF. This increases the charge carrier mobility by one order of magnitude in polymer PHEH-EHF (2 × 10−3 cm2/Vs) compared to EHPH-EHF. Charge carrier mobility can be further improved by another order of magnitude by replacing the branched alkyl chains with the linear alkyl chains (dodecyl) in polymer PHD-DF, where a maximum hole carrier mobility up to 1.24 × 10−2 cm2/Vs can be obtained. A mobility of 7.32 × 10−3 cm2/Vs with moderate on/off ratio (1.94 × 104) and low threshold voltage (−3.5 V) was measured for PHD-DF in the inert-gas atmosphere. Under ambient conditions, the mobility was increased to 1.24 × 10−2 cm2/Vs with a threshold voltage shift to 28 V. This might be an effect of doping of the semiconductor layer by ambient oxygen or photochemically formed ozone from the environment.34,35 It is important to note that this strategic side chain engineering leads to two orders of magnitude enhancement in charge carrier mobility and can be used for other related polymeric structures.
Next, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was employed to investigate the morphology of the polymer thin films. The polymer with linear alkyl chains on the aromatic unit (PHD-DF) produces well defined features in the thin films on SiO2 or OTS-Y substrates (Fig. 3a-b) and yields transistors with improved electrical characteristics. Such features disappear entirely when branched side-chains are introduced at the same positions, as can be seen in thin films of PHEH-EHF (Fig. 3c) which appeared smooth and amorphous under the AFM. Interestingly, thin films of the polymer with branched side chains attached directly to the backbone (EHPH-EHF) looked a little more textured.29 Although the origin of higher mobility of PHEH-EHF compared to EHPH-EHF is not clear from this study, is likely that the planarization of the polymer backbone by the removal of branched side-chains from the backbone to the aromatic unit facilitating a better polymer-polymer overlap for charge transport.

Next we performed further structural analyses using grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) to investigate the packing of these polymers, mainly PHEH-EHF and PHD-DF. GIXS images of these films are presented in Fig. 4, and the extracted interlayer lamellar d(100) spacings and π–π stacking distances shown as insets. We found that the interlayer d(100) spacing of PHD-DF is 28.5 Å, which is 11.5 Å larger than PHEH-EHF, mainly due longer alkyl chains of the former (dodecylvs.2-ethylhexyl). Interestingly, scattering from the lamellar spacing is preferentially oriented along the Qxy direction in case of PHD-DF, whereas it is relatively isotropic (present for all azimuthal angles) for PHEH-EHF films even after annealing up to 200 °C. The π–π stacking distance of PHD-DF is 3.6 Å in the as-cast film, which reduced to 3.5 Å with a stronger scattering feature after annealing at 180 °C. The scattering from the π–π interaction is preferentially oriented along the Qz direction, consistent with the presence of the lamellar peaks along Qxy. This indicates that the polymer backbone plane is oriented parallel to the substrate surface. Interestingly, this π–π spacing is smaller than for P3HT (3.81 Å) and other related polymers reported earlier (∼4 Å).33 There is no diffraction due to π–π interaction in case of PHEH-EHF, which supports the AFM observation that this polymer forms relatively poorly ordered films. In summary, PHD-DF has a well oriented morphology (π-face parallel to the substrate and the layers are perpendicular to the substrate) and PHEH-EHF does not show significant π–π scattering and has an isotropic layer orientation.

Interestingly, polymer PHEH-EHF also showed n-channel behavior when measured under a nitrogen atmosphere, although the threshold voltage for this type of transport is rather high (>100V). Importantly, the average hole (9.7 × 10−4 cm2/Vs) and electron (3.2 × 10−3 cm2/Vs) mobilities for this material are quite balanced.36 The threshold voltage could be potentially reduced by surface modification of the substrate, or the contacts; which are beyond the scope of this paper. So far, only a few ambipolar molecular semiconductors are known and fewer ambipolar polymers are reported.36–40 Previously reported ambipolar polymers usually had hole and electron mobilities of about 5 × 10−3 cm2/Vs.39 Recently, an ambipolar field-effect transistor with relatively higher mobility (∼0.1 cm2/Vs) was developed using a dipyrrole based polymer.40 Our group also recently reported polymer with relatively high hole and electron carrier mobilities of 0.07 cm2/Vs and 0.05 cm2/Vs, respectively.29
These polymers are not ideal for high efficiency solar cells due to their low absorption coefficient in the vis/NIR region of the solar spectrum. However, few donor materials have been reported with high charge carrier mobility that can absorb up to 900 nm.22,23 In order to investigate their photovoltaic effect, bulk heterojunction solar cell devices were fabricated using blend of these polymers and PCBM with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT-PSS/polymer:PCBM/Al.
Power conversion efficiency of 1.15% (Jsc = 4.5 mA/cm2, Voc = 0.595 V, FF = 0.43) under AM1.5 illumination was obtained from the solar cell fabricated from PHEH-EHF and PCBM (1:4 blend ratio). Solar cell devices respond well in the visible to NIR region up to 875 nm, with a maximum external quantum efficiency of ∼14% at 713 nm and 38% at ∼450 nm (Fig. 5). Polymer with linear alkyl chains (PHD-DF) showed poor power conversion efficiency (0.43%, Table S2) compared to the polymer with branched alkyl chains (PHEH-EHF) under similar fabrication conditions, even though the charge carrier mobility of the former is higher. Similar behaviour was observed in case of acenaphthyl based fused aromatic thienopyrazine polymers.27,29 Linear alkyl chains promote polymer film crystallinity and improve charge carrier mobility in thin-film transistors. Although high charge carrier mobility is desirable for efficient charge dissociation in solar cells, high polymer film crystallinity promotes phase separation (100–200 nm scale) from PCBM reducing the photocurrent generation, as observed from the AFM images shown in Fig. 6.

A thorough optimization of these polymer solar cells might improve the power conversion efficiency, but their low absorption coefficients (<4 × 104 cm−1) will ultimately limit the efficiency. We recently reported an approach to enhance absorption coefficients in donor–acceptor type low band gap polymers.41 The optimization of polymer bulk heterojunction solar cells requires balancing of optical, electrochemical and electrical characteristics of materials. Further investigation is underway to attain better control of all these properties and to achieve higher efficiency.
4. Conclusions
In conclusion, a strategic side-chain engineering approach has been employed in the phenanthrene based fused aromatic thienopyrazine polymers to control the charge carrier mobility in thin film transistor devices. 2-Ethylhexyl side-chains are moved away from the polymer backbone to promote the planarity of conjugated core of the semiconducting polymer, which resulted an order of magnitude higher charge carrier mobility. Further replacement of branched alkyl chains with linear alkyl chains yielded well oriented crystalline thin films and charge carrier mobility up to 0.012 cm2/Vs. The performance of these devices correlated well with that expected from the electrical and structural analysis performed using AFM and Grazing incidence X-ray scattering. These polymers were also utilized to produce functional OPVs, where power conversion efficiency of 1.15% was obtained under preliminary investigation.
