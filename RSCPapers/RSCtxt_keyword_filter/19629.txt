Solar energy conversion has been recognized as one of the most urgent and promising technologies for replacing fossil fuels as the priority energy source responsible for sustaining life. Toward this goal, many types of silicon-based solar cells have been developed, with single-crystal, multi-crystal, and amorphous structures; compound semiconductive materials (e.g., CIGS, GaAs, and CdTe), or organic thin layer-based materials.1 However, all of these solar cells have a critical disadvantage, in that the photoreceptors cannot absorb the entire photo-band of sunlight, which leads to inefficient energy conversion. This issue is more critical in relatively low energy conversion systems such as amorphous silicon-based and organic thin layer-based solar cells.2
Because not only the light-conversion efficiency in a UV region is significantly lower than in a visible region (for example, even plants cannot use a UV region for photosynthesis)3 but also strong UV light causes the a-Si cell to gradually deteriorate, one reasonable solution in overcoming this challenge is to pursue spectral conversion from visible bands rather than UV. Spectral conversion films (SCFs) are the best known candidates for this task. Therefore, several types of SCFs have been developed, which contain various fluorescent materials, including monomeric and polymeric dyes,4 organo-metal complexes,5 and quantum dots.6 However, SCFs still have several disadvantages, such as low conversion efficiency, high fabrication cost, and poor durability.
In this communication, we propose a new strategy for fabricating SCFs. Our approach can be defined as molecular gel-mediated nano-fabrication and consequent excimer formation in a polymer film. This method has several advantages: (1) the produced polymer film is transparent because our molecular gelator does not generate macro-scale domains in the film, which cause light scattering, but instead forms molecularly-ordered nano-fibrils (see Fig. 1). (2) This aggregation is accompanied by molecular orientation of a fluorescent group, which leads to UV absorption and compensated excimer emission. (3) The structural flexibility of the film increases the tunability of the spectral band. For the purpose of fabricating these SCFs, we chose the L-glutamide-based molecular gelators,7 as they have good dispersity in a variety of solvents, sufficient miscibility with polymeric materials,8 and considerably low critical aggregation concentrations (e.g., within 0.1 mM in benzene).7c Furthermore, their fluorescence behaviours have been well investigated by doping fluorescent groups such as pyrene,9thiophene,10spiropyran,11 and porphyrin,9a,12 into the L-glutamide derivatives.

        SCFs were prepared according to a simple procedure, as follows. The pyrene-functionalized L-glutamide (gg-Pyr)† as an organogelator was dissolved in hot benzene solution together with polystyrene (PS) to make a clear solution. When this solution was cast on a quartz plate at 25 °C and dried for 1 h at 25 °C, a clear solid film was obtained. When gg-Pyr and PS in the solution were concentrated at 0.5 mM and 0.5 wt/vol%, respectively, the thickness of the film was in the range of 40–50 μm.
Although no gelation was visually observed for the solution with 0.5 mM gg-Pyr, it was spectrophotometrically confirmed that gg-Pyr formed ordered aggregates in this solution. gg-Pyr not only showed extremely large Cotton effects ([θ]355 = 1.1 × 105 deg cm2 dmol−1) around the absorption band (300–370 nm) of a pyrenyl group (Fig. 2a) but also exhibited typical excimer emission around 400–550 nm when it was excited at 360 nm.† Since neither effect was observed in a monomeric dispersion state at 60 °C (red line in Fig. 2a) in a good solvent such as chloroform, it is estimated that gg-Pyr disperses to form chirally ordered structures even in a 0.5 mM solution at 25 °C. In support of this estimation, the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis confirmed the formation of nano-fibrillar aggregates at 0.5 mM.† We found that macroscopic gelation could be obtained by simply increasing the concentration. For example, the 4 mM benzene solution at 25 °C was in a gel, and its xerogel,7c which was prepared by freeze-drying, showed a clear three-dimensional nano-fibrillar network formation. This lyotropic sol-to-gel transition behaviour is characteristic of low-molecular mass gels.13

The gg-Pyr-doped PS-mixed solid film also showed large Cotton effects ([θ]355 = 110 mdeg, as shown in Fig. 2b) and excimer emission (λmax = 450 nm in Fig. 3). These spectral patterns are very close to those observed in solution form, which strongly supports the proposal that gg-Pyr in the polymer film forms highly ordered structures that are likely in the solution. Moreover, it should be emphasized that almost no monomeric emission was observed but only the excimer emission was observed by polymer blending. This indicates that the bulk polymer can work to promote the molecular orientation around a pyrene group.

The film was prepared from a 0.5 mM gg-Pyr and 0.5 wt/vol% PS mixed benzene solution. Excited wavelength is 350 nm. The inset pictures are photo-images of the gg-Pyr-doped PS film. 
The UV-Vis-NIR spectrum of the gg-Pyr-doped PS film (Fig. 3) shows high absorption in the UV region (300–400 nm) due to the pyrenyl group of gg-Pyr but almost no absorption at 400–900 nm, indicating that the polymer film is colourless and transparent (Fig. 3, inset). The combination of high transparency and similar turbidity also indicates that gg-Pyr does not form macro-scale aggregates that cause light scattering but instead assembles as nano-scale aggregates such as one-dimensional fibrils.
With the aim of investigating the spectral conversion efficiency on a solar cell, the SCF-coated solar cell was prepared by the casting method on a commercially available amorphous silicon solar cell (a-Si).† Power-conversion efficiency was calculated from current–voltage curves.†Table 1 and Table S1 (ESI†) summarize the increase rate of conversion efficiency (η) with the short circuit current (ISC), open voltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) in the gg-Pyr/PS-coated cell, as well as in the bare, PS-coated, and gg-free pyrene/PS-coated cells. The highest power-conversion efficiency was observed in the gg-Pyr/PS-coated cell with Δη = 5.35% based on the bare cell. It was found that only ISC—one of the essences of conversion efficiency—showed significant increase (ΔISC = 6.91%), while all other factors remained relatively unchanged. This finding strongly supports the presumption that the increase of power-conversion efficiency was due to a spectral conversion effect from UV to visible light.

On the other hand, the modified cell with gg-free pyrene-doped PS showed a slight increase in power-conversion efficiency with Δη = 1.75%, while the PS-coated cell showed a decrease with Δη = −0.11%. These results indicate that the modification with PS does cause a slight optical loss, but a monomeric emission around 400 nm due to pyrene is effective to some degree. However, it is obvious that the excimer-emitting SCF (ggPyr-PS) has significantly high spectral conversion ability for the a-Si cell.
In addition to enhancing its spectral conversion, we also sought to further improve the light-conversion efficiency of the a-Si solar cell. By simply changing the thickness of the SCF, we found that we could control both the absorption and fluorescence of the cell. Fig. 4a shows the film-thickness-dependent absorption spectra of the gg-Pyr/PS film, which reveal a directly proportional relationship between absorption and film thickness. Fluorescence spectra of the gg-Pyr/PS films also exhibit a similar relationship to film thickness (Fig. 4b), allowing for the possibility of further improvements in the light-conversion efficiency of a-Si solar cells.

In conclusion, we have established a novel method for spectral conversion mediated by molecular gelation, which allows for the improvement of light-conversion efficiency of amorphous silicon solar cells. The obtained conversion efficiency is the highest standard in various SCFs which are constructed by pure organic materials. In addition, it should be emphasized that such an excellent result was obtained regardless of essential optical loss due to light scattering and optical confinement. The key factors that are responsible for this success are the colourless transparency as a result of nano-size doping and the molecular ordering of a pyrene moiety leading to excimer emission, both of which can be regarded as the fundamental functions of the L-glutamide molecular gel. Further enhancement of the power-conversion efficiency would be made possible by careful optimization of the experimental conditions in the coating process, especially in regards to film thickness, roughness, dye concentration, solvent, and temperature. Such results could yield very promising and exciting advancements in the pursuit of alternative sources of energy.
