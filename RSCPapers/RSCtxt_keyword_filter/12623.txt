    , Accepted 17th September 2018First published on 17th September 2018AbstractThis review focuses on the synthesis, properties and selected applications of heavy pnictogen chalcohalides, i.e. compounds of the MQX stoichiometry, where M = As, Sb, and Bi; Q = O, S, Se, and Te; and X = F, Cl, Br and I. The first section focuses on their synthesis and crystal structures, and the second section discusses the electronic structure on the basis of quantum chemical modelling and selected experimental data. Finally, the third section discusses their electrical, photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties and applications. In contrast to perovskites, chalcopyrites and kesterites, chalcohalides have attracted relatively less attention, but their structure and properties are well suited for numerous applications.
Introduction
Wide band gap semiconductors find numerous novel applications in electronics and optoelectronics, photovoltaics, photocatalysis, and biomedical analytics. There are only a few elemental semiconductors among which silicon and germanium are the most commonly used materials. Most of the modern electronic devices are based on these materials. Compound semiconductors are also present in modern technologies: they allow wide band radio frequency communication in the gigahertz range, fabrication of energy efficient light sources and highly efficient solar cells and emerging photocatalytical applications, including self-cleaning and self-sterilizing surfaces, water purification and air deodoration. Titanium dioxide is a leading example of such a successfully applied material. Interestingly, most of the modern semiconductor technologies are dominated by p-block semiconductors: Si, Ge, GaAs and GaN.1,2 In contrast, photocatalysis,3 photovoltaics4 and emerging electronic technologies5–8 usually try to explore binary d-block semiconductors (e.g. transition metal oxides and sulphides, and their alloys and molecular modifications). There is also an interesting group of ternary semiconductors, which were heavily explored in the second half of the 20th century, and have recently been rediscovered, as they exhibit numerous useful properties (Fig. 1).
 Fig. 1  A fragment of the periodic table of elements indicating the most common elemental semiconductors (green), elements forming the most ubiquitous compound semiconductors (blue) and elements forming heavy pnictogen chalcohalides (shaded in yellow and red). 
The rich and versatile chemistry of the elements from the 15th, 16th and 17th main groups of the periodic table of elements yields thousands of possible structures and can be a subject of numerous review papers. In general, if elements other than those indicated in Fig. 1 are included (especially hydrogen, carbon and nitrogen), a manifold of molecular and ionic compounds with the M–Q–X bonding frame can be obtained. These compounds belong, however, to the element–organic species category, whereas purely inorganic species, limited only to selected elements, provide a structurally and stoichiometrically uniform platform on which new materials with tunable properties should be searched for.
A significant drawback of elemental and compound binary semiconductors is the lack of tailorability. These materials have virtually fixed band gaps, band edge potentials, and charge carrier mobilities. Bulk doping is usually used to modulate the charge carrier concentration, whereas surface modification is specifically important in the case of nano- and micromaterials and can be applied to change their band edge potentials and photosensitivity range, parameters essential for photocatalytic and photovoltaic applications. On the other hand, precise band gap engineering of semiconductors and semiconducting nanostructures is essential for tailoring the optical properties of materials, and their integration into functional devices.
Binary semiconductors can be tuned to some extent via preparation of semiconductor alloys, but the applicability of this technique is limited by Vegard's law9 and band gap bowing. The band gap of alloy semiconductors A and B is usually described by Van Vechten–Bergstresser's rule (eqn (1)):10 Eg = xEAg + (1 − x)EBg − bx(1 − x)(1)where Eg is the band gap of an alloy, EAg and EBg are the band gaps of the components, x is the molar fraction of component A and b is the bowing factor. The bowing factor, according to Van Vechten and Bergstresser, describes the deviation from the linear behaviour of Vegard's law resulting from the aperiodic variation of the crystal potential in substitutional alloys; however, other explanations can also be found.11 This short range disorder (at a length scale comparable to the size of the unit cell) is also reflected in anomalous changes in the absorption coefficients of semiconducting alloys due to Anderson's localization, which influences the polaritonic transport phenomenon.12 The band gap tuning via alloying is limited by discontinuous deviations from Vegard's law and Van Vechten–Bergstresser's rule, the strict requirement of the similarity of the atomic radii of the components of substitutional alloys, crystal lattice instabilities and the formation of multiphase materials.
Therefore, new materials have been intensively searched for and a few new families of semiconducting materials have been extensively explored. They include perovskites,13 chalcopyrites,14 kesterites15 and chalcohalides.16 Oxide perovskites have been applied as ferroelectric, piezoelectric and high-k materials and high temperature superconductors. Lead and bismuth iodide perovskites are explored mainly as solar cell materials. They offer high energy conversion efficiencies; however, devices based on them suffer from relatively high air and humidity sensitivity and problems with appropriate band alignment at interfaces. Kesterites and chalcopyrites are much more difficult to prepare and therefore tuning of their properties is relatively complex. Furthermore, they show some lattice instabilities and their performance is compromised due to the precipitation of secondary phases. Chalcohalides reported up to now seem to be devoid of all these drawbacks. Their synthesis is relatively simple, and they are stable and their crystal and electronic structures can be easily tuned to provide very good performance. They are, however, much less extensively studied as compared to other multielement compound semiconductors.
Pnictogen chalcohalides were intensively studied in the 1960s due to their promising glass-forming abilities, and optical properties in the infrared region and ferroelectric properties. The renaissance of pnictogen chalcohalides originates primarily from their prospective applications as solar cell materials. Recently, they demonstrated their potential as materials for nanoelectronics due to their chain-like structure, which facilitates the formation of 1D structures. Interestingly, 1D chalcohalides exhibit much better electrical properties than their bulk counterparts.17
Chalcohalide semiconductors are well-suited for substitutional tuning due to the possibility of low temperature synthesis, which greatly supresses halogen volatility, which, in turn, provides good control over materials’ stoichiometry. Importantly, they give an opportunity of continuous tunability and phase stability and are based on Earth-abundant materials.18 Furthermore, due to the presence of high-Z ns2 levels of d10s2p0 electron configurations, they exhibit good charge carrier transport properties. Peculiar electronic structures, originating from the anti-bonding character of the top of the valence band (hybridized cation s-orbitals with anion p-orbitals) extended p-states at the bottom of the conduction band, lead to a highly dispersive character of both bands. This in turn favours high charge carrier mobility and defect tolerance. Cross-band gap hybridization gives rise to higher dielectric constants, thus screening the point defects, which is beneficial for transport properties.19 Therefore the low performance of devices based on these materials should be mainly attributed to band misalignment. Performance improvement requires fine-tuning of semiconductor and contact properties. Therefore, pnictogen chalcohalides can be considered as materials of choice for further studies and numerous emerging applications. This review presents a collection of data on synthesis methodology, crystal and electronic structures, transport properties and some selected applications in photocatalysis and photocurrent generation.
Synthesis
The purpose of this section is to summarize and briefly describe methods used to synthesize V–VI–VII compounds. The most widely described methods are crystallization from melts (sometimes termed the growth from melt and self-flux method) either with or without any temperature gradient, the Bridgman method, chemical and physical vapour transport, growth from vapour (vacuum fusion) and chemical methods, such as sonochemical synthesis, and solvo- and hydrothermal methods.
Growth from melts
The most widely used synthesis method is annealing at high temperatures. This method has been used to synthesize BiSeCl,20 BiSeI,21–24 BiTeCl,25,26 BiTeI, BiTeCl,25 BiTeI,27–29 BiTeBr,28 BiTeBr,28 AsSI,30,31 AsSeI,30–33 AsTeI,31 SbSeI,34 SbTeI,35 and AsTeI.31
Typically, a mixture of pure elements (or MV–XVII metal halides with MV–QVI type compounds, where M = As, Sb, Bi; Q = S, Se, Te; X = Cl, Br, I) in a stoichiometric ratio with a slight excess of the halide is placed in either a glass or quartz ampoule and sealed at low pressure (of the order of or below 1 Pa). An excessive amount of halide, especially I2, due to its volatility, is necessary when the stoichiometric crystal structures are desired.21 Such a sealed ampoule is then placed in the furnace and heated above the melting temperature of compounds in the mixture. The temperature is maintained for some period of time, typically ranging from few hours to even weeks. Then, the sample is slowly cooled down. These conditions may differ significantly from one synthesis to another one. Kanchana and Arivuoli heated the mixture to 720–820 K (20 K above the melting temperature) and kept it at this temperature for 4 hours to obtain BiSeI.21 Significantly lower temperature was used by Moroz et al. (∼500 K); however, the crystallization time was extended to 250 hours.23 Braun and co-workers used a higher temperature (873 K) and crystallization time of 1 week.22 Similar temperature was used by Rosenthal et al., but with a crystallization time of 15 h.24 All of the described syntheses led to crystalline products. It has been shown that reducing the cool down phase duration may lead to amorphous products. Cooling AsSeI melt from 723 K at a rate of 10 K min−1 or quenching it with icy water resulted in the formation of amorphous, semiconducting glasses.31,32 It has also been shown that with this method one can synthesize non-stoichiometric compounds simply by varying the molar ratio of precursors in the initial mixture.21,23,31
The crystallization from melt method was also used with a temperature gradient to synthesize more complex compounds, such as Bi11Se12Cl9 crystals.36 The ampoule, prepared similarly to that in the regular method, was placed in a temperature gradient of 70 K (1319 K in the hot zone, 1249 K in the cold zone). The crystallization occurs in the colder part of the ampoule. The Bi11Se12Cl9 crystals obtained by this method grew up to 5 mm. The growth from melt method allows obtaining polycrystalline intercalated compounds as well, such as CuxBiTe1−yI1+y37 or In2Bi3Se7I and InBi2Se4I phases.24
Gas phase growth
Growth from vapour techniques were also applied to synthesize V–VI–VII compounds. Mainly two distinct types of this technique are distinguished: chemical vapour transport (CVT), which is sometimes termed chemical transport reaction (CTR), and physical vapour transport (PVT). Both methods are widely applicable and allow obtaining high-purity single crystals.
The CVT method, additionally, makes it possible to obtain crystals that cannot be synthesized by Czochralski or Bridgman–Stockbarger techniques, such as compounds decomposing prior to melting or reacting with solutions. Basically, CVT relies on a chemical reaction between the starting compound and the transporting agent in the hotter part of the vessel, resulting in a volatile product, which is then transferred into the colder part of the vessel, where the back reaction occurs. The transporting agent is released and the parent solid grows into a crystalline form.38 This method was used to synthesize BiTeI27,39,40 and BiOCl.41 The disadvantage of CVT is the possibility of a minor contamination of crystals with transporting agent molecules. Sankar et al. synthesized BiTeI single crystals with three methods (growth from melt, the Bridgman technique and CVT) and achieved the highest quality crystals with the Bridgman technique approach (Fig. 2).27 The CVT approach was also used to synthesize antimony oxyhalides: SbOF and SbOCl.42 SbCl3 in the gaseous state was passed under slow flow and pressure reduced to 0.5 Torr over heated Ag2O (503 K) and NaF (823 K).27

The PVT method is identical in principle to the CVT; however, it does not utilize the transport agent. The starting crystal is heated to its sublimation temperature and transferred with an inert gas (such as Ar) flow into the cold zone, where the crystal is formed.43 With this technique, BiTeI44 and BiSeI45 crystals were synthesized.
The growth from vacuum technique is in principle related to the CVT and PVT methods. Here, the mixed precursors of the target compound are subjected to sublimation and react in the gaseous phase, and crystal growth occurs from the vapour.46 Various materials, including BiSeI,46 BiTeI,47 BiSI and SbSI,48 were prepared this way from mixtures of pure elements. With this technique, Arivuoli and coworkers observed BiSeI crystallizing into a platelet form for the first time.49 The growth from vacuum method allows also obtaining relatively large high purity crystals (e.g. BiSeI of dimensions 2 × 2 × 10 mm3).50
Wet chemical methods
V–VI–VII compounds can be synthesized with chemical methods as well. Kunioku et al. presented a route to obtain BiSI and BiSeI from BiOI and BiSeBr1−xIx from BiOBr1−xIx by low-temperature treatment with diluted H2S and H2Se, respectively.18 This method requires temperatures significantly lower than Bridgman and vacuum transport techniques (423 K compared to ∼680 K), takes less time and provides control over the band gap. Hu et al. applied an electrochemical method to prepare porous BiOBr thin films on a Bi substrate.51 The precipitation from solution method is also used to synthesize bismuth oxyhalides. BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI exhibiting enhanced photocatalytic properties (in comparison with TiO2) were obtained by precipitation from Bi(NO3)3 solution in water/ethanol solvent with KCl, KBr and KI, respectively.52,53 BiOF/B2O3 nanoparticles were precipitated from Bi(NO3)3 and NaF solution in ethylene glycol.54 A BiOI thin film might be obtained through the hydrolysis of HBiI4, a compound formed when Bi2O3 is dissolved in an excess of hydroiodic acid.55
Both solvo- and hydrothermal methods are also commonly utilized. Zhu et al. obtained micrometer-sized BiSeI and BiSeCl crystals with autoclave synthesis in water/ethanol mixtures.56 Varying the pH of the solution in hydrothermal synthesis was shown to affect the stoichiometry of the resulting compound. A Bi5O7Br photocatalyst was obtained in hydrothermal synthesis in alkaline solution at pH = 13, while BiOBr is obtained at neutral pH.57 The size and shape of the final product can be controlled by either the reaction conditions or starting reagents. BiTeI hollow microspheres of submicrometer size were obtained from initial Bi2Te3 and I2 solution in a 1:6 molar ratio.58 Fa et al. obtained BiOI nanolamellae and BiSI nanowires by performing competitive growth of these compounds and tuning the growth conditions with the quantity of thiourea in the solution.59 With increase of thiourea concentration, the rod-like morphology becomes favoured. Similar shape-tuning with citric acid was shown for BiOCl sub-microcrystals in the precipitation method, exhibiting morphological changes from nanoflakes to hollow microspheres.60
Sonochemistry
A sonochemical synthesis is a process using ultrasonic radiation to facilitate the chemical reactions. An acoustic wave is used to create and sustain the cavitation process – a large difference in the pressure created by the acoustic irradiation breaks molecular and van der Waals interactions. Immediate collapse of the bubble leads to the generation of localized hotspots (the theoretical temperatures could reach up to 25000 K)63 and pressures up to 1700 atm.64 Those conditions are favourable for the formation of 1D nanostructures. This method can be successfully applied under ambient temperature and pressure.
The sonochemical method is preferentially used in the synthesis of antimony sulphoiodide (SbSI)64 and antimony selenoiodide (SbSeI).64 Pure elements in a stoichiometric ratio (antimony, sulfur/selenium and iodine) are placed in a flask. Common solvents used for this process are mostly alcohols (ethanol, methanol, isopropanol), whereas water is rarely used. Subsequently, the flask is immersed in an ultrasonic bath. The required time may be varied depending on the conditions and used reagents. It is usually assumed that the process is finished when the colour stops changing as a function of time (Fig. 3). The synthesis can be carried out at various temperatures but usually takes place at 323 K.64

Bridgman technique
The Bridgman method is utilized for the synthesis of monocrystals. Pure elements in a stoichiometric ratio is placed in a quartz ampoule with a conical tip. Upon sealing in a vacuum, the sample is put into a furnace with a temperature gradient. Upon melting, the ampoule is moved slowly towards a low temperature zone. Temperatures within the range from 763 K to 873 K are usually sufficient to obtain good quality crystals.
Materials usually obtained with this method after proper adjustment are BiTeBr, BiTeI,65 BiTeCl,66 SbSI, BiSI, BiSeI and SbSeI.67
Crystallography
In this work we focus on the MV–QVI–XVII family of compounds, where M is As, Bi, or Sb; Q is O, Se, Te, or S; and X is F, Cl, Br or I. The composition and local and long range structure determine the physical and electronic properties of the materials. The most obvious example is the change in the band gaps of chalcohalides, which decreases in the series F → Cl → Br → I. The orientation of the crystal on the substrate is important in photovoltaics and photocatalysis. The vertical orientation of the BiSI and BiSeI chains on the substrate promotes carrier transport along the covalently bonded fragments and the enforced vertically aligned grain boundaries may occur parallel to the chains and minimize charge carrier recombination.68
Crystal structures of AsQX
Ternary chalcohalides containing As, O, S, Se and halogen atoms were mostly investigated in the 70s and 80s. Arsenic chalcohalides tend to form glass structures with short range order and the majority of the works consider the glass phase formation and its properties.31 All confirmed that stable crystalline phases are in the monoclinic system and form chain-like motifs. There are known glasses containing Cl or Br atoms; however, no single crystal structure has been obtained so far. Moreover, As–O–X (X – any halide) systems do not form any crystal phases, except for AsOCl3, which forms dimers in the P21/c space group and must be handled at low temperature (−233 K) and in a dry environment due to its facile hydrolysis (Fig. 4).69 AsOF3 was also mentioned in the literature.70 As–S–Cl or As–S–Br systems form glasses and their crystal structures have not been obtained so far.71–74
 Fig. 4  The crystal structure of AsOCl3 viewed along the b axis direction (a), and coordination around As atoms in the dimer (b). 
Although systems composed of As, S and I atoms usually form glasses,31,73,75–80 a stable crystalline AsSI structure has been determined from X-ray powder data. AsSI crystalizes in the monoclinic space group P21. The similarity between V–VI–VII type chalcogenides allows assuming a chain-like structure of As–S–As with the iodine atom bonded to the arsenic atoms.30,81–83 AsSeCl ternary chalcogenides cannot be found in the literature, even among glasses, whereas AsSeBr can form the glass phase.72,77
Both the glass31,32 and crystal75,84 phases of AsSeI have been examined. AsSeI exist in two phases: stable α and metastable β.84,85 α-AsSeI crystalizes in the monoclinic system and the P21 space group. β-AsSeI is cubic and belongs to the F4132 space group. The stable α form consists of trigonal pyramids with the arsenic atom located at the apex of the triangle and selenium atoms connecting the triangles (Fig. 5a).
 Fig. 5  The crystal structures of AsSeI (a) and As5Te7I (b). 
Besides the glass phases,72,77,86,87 the As–Te–I system forms four crystal structures: As4Te5I2, As5Te7I, α-AsTeI and β-AsTeI.75,81,88 α-AsTeI crystalizes in the monoclinic system and the P21 space group. It forms a double-chain structure where the tellurium atom bonds three arsenic atoms – similar arrangement can be found in SbSI. The cubic (Fm3m) β-AsTeI is metastable and transforms into α-AsTeI after annealing. The monoclinic As5Te7I crystalizes as grey needle-like crystals in the C2/m space group. The As5Te7I structure has two types of As atoms: one is octahedrally coordinated, and the other As atom coordinates seven Se atoms and forms a composite polyhedron – the combination of the tetragonal pyramid and the prism (Fig. 5b).88
Crystal structures of SbQX
Antimony oxyhalides were investigated mostly in the 70s and have not attracted much attention since then. SbOF belongs to the Pnma space group and has a ladder-like arrangement of Sb and O atoms (Fig. 6a).89
 Fig. 6  The crystal structures of SbOF (a) and Sb3O2F5 (b). 
Sb3O2F5 crystalizes in the P2/c space group.90 Both structures have four coordinated O or F atoms and a stereochemically active lone pair on the Sb(III) centre (Fig. 6). In the Sb–O–F system of hygroscopic compounds SbOF3 and SbO2F were also reported.70
Antimony oxychlorides SbOCl, Sb4O5Cl2 and Sb8O11Cl2 crystalize in the P21/a, P21/c and C2/m space groups respectively.91–93 Sb4O5Cl2 has a ladder-like structure, which can be often found in the Sb–O–X family. The structure of Sb8O11Cl2 is isomorphic with Sb8O11Br2.91 Several structures in the Sb–O–I system can be found. Sb5O7I exists in two different phases: the ferroelastic monoclinic phase α-Sb5O7I (P21/c) stable and at low temperature and the hexagonal β-Sb5O7I (P63/m) one stable at high temperature (Fig. 7).94 Sb3O4I undergoes thermal degradation first to Sb8O11I2 next to Sb5O7I then finally to Sb2O3.95

The SbSeX family has two 1:1 structures (SbSeI and SbSeBr) that both crystalize in the Pnam space group. SbSeI, in which each Sb atom is five coordinated by three Se atoms and two iodine atoms (Fig. 8a), has attracted the most interest.96,97 The five atoms (two I, two Se and Sb) form the base of a square pyramid with the third Se atom on the apex. Unusual structures can be found in the Sb–Se–F system. The crystal structures of Se10(SbF6)2, (Se4)2(Sb4F17)(SbF6)3, and (Se4)(Sb2F4)(Sb2F5)(SbF6)5 contain the square-planar chalcogen cation Se42+ (or boat-shape Se102+, Fig. 9).98–100

 Fig. 9  Crystal structures of (Se4)2(Sb4F17)(SbF6)3 (view along the b axis) (a), S4(Sb2F4)(Sb2F5)(SbF6)5 (view along the a axis) (b), and (Te4)(SbF6)2 (view along the a axis) (c). 
The compounds SbSBr and SbSI are known for their ferroelectric properties and belong to the Pnma and Pna21 space groups in the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phase respectively.16,101,102 These orthorhombic structures consist of pleated double chains arranged along the c axis (Fig. 8b). Several other structures in the Sb–S–X system have been obtained. The trigonal pyramids with the Se atom at the apex and connected by the sulfur atom form the structure of Sb4S5Cl2.103
All three structures of S19(SbF6)2, S8(Sb3F14)(SbF6) and S4(Sb2F4)(Sb2F5)(SbF6)5 contain sulfur cations S192+, S82+ or S42+ (Fig. 9b).104 The crystal structure of SbTeI is triclinic and belongs to the P1 space group although the monoclinic structure (C2/m) was also determined (Fig. 8c).35,97 Similarly to the Sb–S–F family, the Sb–Te–F system has compounds that contain the chalcogen cation M42+. The planar-square Te42+ cations in (Te4)(SbF6)2 are balanced with SbF6− anions (Fig. 9c).100
Crystal structures of BiQX
Bismuth oxyhalochalcogenides with 1:1:1 BiOX (X = F, Cl, Br, I) stoichiometry belong to the tetragonal space group P4/nmm.55,105,106 All four BiOX share the layered structure in which a positive charge of [Bi2O2]2+ is compensated for with halogen ions (Fig. 10a). Each Bi atom is surrounded by four O atoms and four halogen atoms, forming an asymmetric decahedron connected in the [X–Bi–O–Bi–O–X] motifs, held together by van der Waals forces (Fig. 10).
 Fig. 10  The crystal structure of BiOBr (a) and the coordination of the Bi atom (b). 
This decahedral structure distinguishes BiOX from other ABX halochalcogenides with Q = S, Se or Te in which the coordination polyhedra are octahedra or 7-coordination polyhedra.105 In the series F → Cl → Br → I the lattice parameter c grows from 6.23 Å to 9.15 Å (about 46%) due to the growth of the ionic radius of the halogen atom, while the lattice parameter a expands from 3.75 Å to 4.09 Å (only 9%). Besides the well-known BiOX (1:1) compounds, several other compositions in the Bi–O–X system can be found. Usually the thermal decomposition of BiOI leads to the formation of the monoclinic Bi4O5I2 (2.5:1 ratio, homologous with Bi4O5Br2).107,108 In these structures the [Bi4O5]2− layers are separated from each other by I− (or Br−) layers (Fig. 11).

Other closely related structures are Bi24O31Cl10 and Bi24O31Br10,109 Bi5O7Br and α-Bi5O7I, and Bi3O4Br and Bi3O4Br compounds.110,111 β-Bi5O7I, Bi7O9I3, Bi12O17Cl2, Bi12O17Br2, Bi12O16Cl4, and Bi7O5F11, which share more irregular (less layered) structures, also belong to the Bi–O–X system.110,112,113
In the family of BiTeX (X = Cl, Br, I) halochalcogenides the common feature is the formation of [BiTe]+ layers (Fig. 12a).28 BiTeCl has a hexagonal structure and the P63mc space group. The crystal consists of Bi, Te and Cl atom layers and has an almost twice as large c parameter as the BiTeBr and BiTeI structures.115 BiTeBr (the Pm1 space group) has a two-layer structure: one layer is made of Bi atoms and the other layer is made of statistically distributed Te and Br atoms.28,116 BiTeI crystalizes in the trigonal space group P3m1. Each Bi atom is six-coordinated by three I atoms and three Te atoms in the form of an asymmetric octahedron (Fig. 12c).105 The Bi–Te–I system, besides the 1:1 structures, contains two other ternary compounds: Bi2TeI and Bi4TeI1.25.114,117 Bi2TeI crystalizes in the monoclinic system (the C/2m space group) and contains a double layer of bismuth stacked between two iodide layers. The arrangement Te–Bi–I–Bi–Bi–I–Bi–Te is presented in Fig. 12b and d.114 Interesting structures with polymeric Te cations can be found in the Bi–Te–Cl system. The structures of Te8[Bi4Cl14] and (Te4)(Te10)[BiCl16] belong to the orthorhombic P212121 and the triclinic P space groups respectively. In these structures the polymeric cations ((Te82+)n, (Te102+)n, and (Te42+)n) were found.118,119

The Bi–Se–X system with a 1:1:1 ratio includes the BiSeCl, BiSeBr and BiSeI structures.20,22,28 BiSeCl and BiSeBr belong to the Pnam space group. BiSeI crystalizes in the Pbnm space group. The common feature of these structures is the formation of chain-like structures in which neighboring Bi atoms are bridged by three Se atoms and two halogen atoms (vide infra).22,49,120 Outside the 1:1 ratio compounds, in the Bi–Se–Cl system, the compound Bi11Se12Cl9 that belongs to the monoclinic C2/m space group has been found.121
BiSCl crystalizes in the orthorhombic space group Pnma, while the BiSBr and BiSI structures were solved in the Pnam space group.122–124 BiSX systems consist of parallel [X(Bi2S2)X] rods and, similarly to BiSeI, form chain-like structures (vide infra). BiSX ternary systems also include the isomorphic Bi19S27Cl3, Bi19S27Br3, and Bi19S27l3 structures belonging to the P63/m space group.125–129 Recently, the structure with the formula Bi19S27l3 has been redetermined as Bi13S18I2; therefore the other two isomorphic structures are likely to be redetermined in the near future.130 The Bi13S18I2 structure has subvalent Bi24+ dimers and a ribbon-like structure (Bi4S6)∞ (Fig. 13).
 Fig. 13  Averaged cell representation of the P63 structure of Bi13S18I2 viewed along the c axis. Inset: Normal to the c-axis to highlight bismuth (disordered/averaged dimer) sites, in hatched red. Adapted from ref. 130 with the permission of American Chemical Society. 
The common feature among 1:1:1 halochalcogenides is well illustrated in Fig. 14. In the most chalcohalides (excluding oxyhalides) a double chain-like structure forms along one of the axes (Fig. 15). The chain consists of two atoms of A connected with two atoms of B in one rectangle. The rectangles share one edge and are additionally connected via halide atoms. The exception is AsSeI, in which the chain degenerates into a single one, probably due to the smaller radius of the arsenic atom, leading to its weaker Lewis acceptor properties.131

 Fig. 15  The chain like structure of AsSeI (a) and the double chain-like structure of BiSI (b). 
The closest nonbonding distances between iodide and atom AV or BVI or another iodide atom are collated in Table 1. Interactions inside the crystal structures of these halochalcogenides seem to be complex, but several regularities are noticeable. The first order interactions in the structures (A–B in Table 1) follow an obvious trend in which the bonding distance increases with radii of the atoms involved in the bonding. The second order interactions (A⋯X and X⋯X in Table 1), on the other hand, do not follow this trend that strictly: e.g. the smallest distances between Se⋯I and S⋯I are 3.61 Å and 3.62 Å, respectively. The I⋯I distances are quite large, and after the analysis of Hirshfeld surfaces, I⋯I is not recognized as an interaction, while A⋯X and B⋯X seem to be the most important intermolecular interactions in the crystal structure (Fig. 16). Table 2 contains combined crystal data for V–VI–VII systems of elements from groups 15, 16 and 17.

Electronic structure and optical properties from computations
Parameters that emerge from fundamental electronic structure properties and are taken into account when designing optoelectronic devices include optical band gap energy, the optical absorption coefficient and carrier diffusion lengths, determined by the minority-carrier lifetime (τ) and mobility (μ). Transport related factors, τ and μ, are not easily accessible from experiment nor from first-principles calculations. However, it is possible to gain some information indirectly with well-established computational density functional theory (DFT) methods via parameters like the dielectric constant, band bonding character, band dispersion, and effective mass (Table S1, ESI†). High dielectric constants suggest long carrier lifetimes, large diffusion lengths, and effective screening of charged defects. The band bonding character has an implication on the band dispersion relation and on the charge carrier effective masses. Usually, the lower/higher effective mass means higher/lower migration capability and a low/high recombination probability of carriers within semiconductor materials.
The partially oxidized post-transition metal cations Bi3+ and Sb3+ with ns2np0 and chalcogen (O, S, Se, Te) and halogen (X = F, Cl, Br, I) anions with np6 constitute V–VI–VII type chalcohalide compounds. During the formation of bonds, charge transfer occurs from the cation p to anion p states, resulting in an s lone-pair on the cation. This ns2 configuration is closely related to the success of these compounds as optoelectronic materials. The valence band (VB) is formed as a result of the overlap of the anion-p with cation-s orbitals with the antibonding maximum (VBM), as depicted in Fig. 17. It is the relative energy of these orbitals that determines the extent of s contribution to the top of the valence band – energetically closer orbitals result in greater s contribution and thus in a stronger lone pair, resulting in a significant stabilisation effect.68,168 As such, the stabilities of these compounds increase up the chalcogen or the halide group, connected with the increasing lone pair effect and ionic character.169 Hybridization of these antibonding states with cation p states produces an asymmetric electron density responsible for the distortion of the pseudo-octahedra.170 The antibonding states at the top of the VB also greatly improve defect tolerance171 – it was recently demonstrated that the antibonding character of the valence band maximum (VBM), which leads to shallow intrinsic defects and no surface states.172 The conduction band (CB) of these compounds is dominated by the spatially extended cation p states with a tendency to cross gap hybridization with the anion p states of the valence band.

The representative electron density of states (DOS), total and projected onto atoms and orbitals, is shown in Fig. 18. The valence band of BiOF173 consists of well separated bands. The crystal's upper valence band consists of Bi-6p, O-2p, F-4p and some Bi-6s hybridized orbitals, while the lowest energy band originates mainly from the s orbitals of each atomic component. This is typical for group 15 chalcohalides. DOS have been reported for crystals of SbOX,169 Sb–S,Se–X,173–178 SbTeX,177,179 BiOX,169,180–186 Bi–S,Se–X50,68,169,187–191 and BiTeX.156,179,192–194
 Fig. 18  Representative partial density of states for a V–Vi–VII semiconductor (here for BiOF as presented in Khan et al.).173 The s orbitals are separated (in terms of energy) in the conduction band, whereas the p orbitals interact with each other, enhancing cation–anion bond covalency. 
The value of the gap can be engineered by a choice of chalcogen or halide: smaller band gaps are found for heavier chalcogenide and halide compositions (Fig. 19 and Table 3).50,68,156,169,173–175,177,179,180,182–186,188–190,192–210 It was suggested that despite possessing indirect band gaps, these semiconductors can achieve a fair optoelectronic performance as the differences between the direct and indirect band gaps are small.68 The presence of filled ns2 orbitals have also been associated with the dispersive valence and conduction bands, and therefore low effective masses.168 Indeed, the calculated effective masses of electrons and holes in these compounds are in many cases lower than or around the rest mass of electrons (me).169 The presence of a heavy cation, and thus large relativistic effects, results in an increase of the conduction band width through a significant lowering of the conduction band minimum (CBM).171 The relativistic renormalisation of the conduction band of BiSI and BiSeI was found to be over 0.6 eV, highlighting the importance of including spin orbit effects in modelling these systems.68 The shape of the bands and the electron and hole effective masses are generally insensitive to the level of theory.169,211

Recently, Butler et al.198 provided a quantitative electronic structure description within the relativistic quasi-particle GW (QSGW) approximation including spin orbit coupling (SOC) of SbSI, SbSBr, and SbSeI. This truly ab initio method showed unusual band dispersion with high degeneracy and several electron and hole basins close to the band extrema. In comparison with the local density approximation (LDA) dispersion relation, the quasi-particle corrections increased the magnitude of the band gap, but did not alter the dispersion. The isotropic electron and hole effective masses were all calculated to be below 0.65me, but larger effective masses were found for higher lying second extrema. The band gaps were consistently overestimated and compared to screened hybrid functional (HSE06) values.
The smallest indirect bad gap of 2 eV was calculated for SbSeI. The ionization potentials (IP) and electron affinities (EA) were also predicted, which are essential for proper band alignment in functional devices (Table 4). In another study, using, however, GGA-DFT, with relativistic effects and SOC included, SbSI was shown to have the smallest effective masses of electrons (0.07me) and holes (0.098me) and greater mobility than SbSeI and SbSBr. The p-type nature of all the compounds was suggested.173 The bulk-to-1D transition of SbSeI, SbSI, and SbSBr materials was investigated.17 A quantum confinement results in dramatic changes in band gap, effective masses, and static dielectric constant. Moreover, a small uniaxial strain causes transformation from indirect into direct band gap character.

The cross-gap hybridization indicates covalency in the otherwise ionic materials and a large Born effective charge, leading to strong lattice polarization and anomalously large static dielectric constants.168,169,171 Sb-based V–VI–VII materials combine near visible range absorption with polar instabilities.198 The electronic structures of SbSI, SbSBr, and SbSeI were reviewed in terms of photoferroic properties exhibited by these compounds in the non-centrosymmetric phase (Pna21, C2v).211 The phase behaviour is associated with the stereochemically active s2 lone pair electrons on the cation that can exhibit second-order Jahn–Teller instability associated with the change from a symmetric to asymmetric coordination environment.212 The small enthalpy difference was calculated between the non-polar and polar phases of SbSI and SbSBr. The Berry phase analysis indicated that all possess significant spontaneous electric dipole moments.211 A number of theoretical studies have been devoted to the dynamics of a phase transition of (Sb, Bi)–(S, Se)–(Cl, Br, I).213–217 It was shown that the Bi atoms are too large and the anharmonicity is too small to induce a ferroelectric phase transition in Bi chalcohalides.68,213 The phonon–phonon interaction has been proven to be the origin of the ferroelectric phase transition of SbSI and SbSBr.214,218
The vibrational thermodynamic functions in the harmonic approximation with full potential DFT were studied to show the temperature dependence of the phase stability and to determine the theoretical phase transition temperature of SbSI219 and SbSBr.190 The effects of electron–phonon interaction and the characteristics of anomalous behavior in the phase transition region were further addressed for the SbSBr cluster with the Hartree–Fock method.220 The theoretical calculation revealed that the ferroelectric phase transition changes the bond orders and shift valence bands in SbSI and SbSBr.215,221 The averaged total density of states distribution that included the effects of atomic oscillations of both phases of SbSBr was qualitatively compared to the X-ray photoemission spectra (XPS).215 In a similar manner, a comparison to XPS was made for SbSI,222 SbSeI,176 BiSCl,189 BiSBr,191 BiSI,223 BiSeBr191 and BiSeI224 clusters.
Huang et al. demonstrated improvement in the band gap energies by including the first Bi 5d183 and later also Bi 5f184 states while investigating BiOX compounds. The band gap of BiOF is direct according to the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) DFT method184 but indirect according to the hybrid DFT method.225 The other species of this family exhibit indirect gaps,180,226 with similar transition positions and increasing flatness of the CB bottoms with increase in X atomic number.183,184,225 The VB width expands remarkably, while the CB width descends from BiOCl to BiOI.184 The smallest hole effective masses were found for BiOCl and BiOBr.206,225,227 The smallest electron effective masses can be observed in the direction across the [X–Bi–O–Bi–X] sheets in the structure. Ganose et al.225 emphasized that the contribution of the halide p states to the VBM increases, ultimately dominating the VBM in BiOI, and therefore the band gap reduction (as well as the ionization potential) down the halogen family is in line with the binding energy of the halide p orbitals. As such, alloys between these compounds offer the desired band gap, photocatalyic activity181 and electronic band alignment.225 The Bi-6s lone pair makes only a small contribution to the top of the valence band and is not stereoactive, meaning that the Bi is perfectly octahedral within the BiOX structure.
Bader population analyses reveal that the atomic populations of Bi increase, while those of X decrease from BiOF to BiOI, showing the reduction in oxidative capability.183,184 Recent works have shown the effects of compressive and tensile strains on the structural, electronic and optical properties of bulk bismuth oxyhalides.182,206,228 Out of the four BiOX systems, the BiOBr bulk phase was found to be one of the best photocatalysts with a moderate band gap, good optical conductivity and favorable separation of photo-excited charge carriers. Various crystal facets of BiOX were also studied in this regard.228,229 The (001) BiOI monolayer showed good structural stability, a decreased band gap, a smaller electron effective mass and a red-shift of absorption edges under tensile strain. The one layer of an X terminated (001) facet is superior as a photocatalyst, due to its extremely high thermodynamic stability, proper sunlight absorption, and low electron–hole recombination rate.
Ganose et al. demonstrated that BiSI and BiSeI have the electronic characteristics required for solar energy applications, paying attention to the selection of appropriate contact materials due to the large electron affinities of these materials (>4.9 eV, cf.Table 3). The stereoactivity of the cation s antibonding states was investigated and the energy band formation mechanism was investigated with the Crystal Orbital Hamilton Population (COHP) analysis. BiSI and BiSeI were found to possess relatively diffused and thus weakly stereoactive lone pairs. It is due to the scalar-relativistic contraction of the Bi-6s shell, which results in a small pseudo-octahedral distortion in the lattice.68 Low effective masses have been calculated in the direction along the Bi–(S, Se)–I chains and high dielectric constants were determined.68,169
BiTeX compounds exhibit the ionic nature of the chemical bonds;230,231 thus the upper valence band and the lower conduction band are derived from the Bi, Te, and I p orbitals. The valence bands are dominated by Te-5p and X outmost p orbitals, while the conduction bands are predominantly composed of Bi-p orbitals. The inclusion of SOC leads to a huge reduction in the band gap energy.29,156,179,195,202,204,232,233 The characteristic feature of the band structure of these compounds is the slight shift of the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum from the high symmetry points of the Brillouin zone (BZ). The most accurate computations of the band structures and bang gaps were performed by Rusinov et al., who employed the GW approximation.207 Due to the non-centrosymmetric crystal structure and strong SOC, this family exhibits a so-called Rashba-type spin splitting. In non-magnetic systems with the inversion symmetry of the bulk crystal potential, the SOC results in a situation where every electron's spin is locked perpendicularly to its momentum. The Rashba spin splitting caused by SOC is manifested as the modification of the energy band structure near the Fermi level by removing the band degeneracy and modifying the band edges depending on their spin states. The effect is inversely proportional to the band gap energy, so the largest effect is observed for BiTeI and the smallest for BiTeCl.209 The origin of the bulk Rashba splitting was discussed by Bahramy et al.202 and Zhang et al.234 Many unique quantum phenomena emerge from this effect, e.g. exotic inter- and intra-band optical transitions, enhanced magneto-optical response, spin Hall and Edelstein effects, non-centrosymmetric superconductivity, and the formation of topological insulating phases. For a recent review on bulk Rashba semiconductors and their related quantum phenomena and applications, we refer the reader to references 235 and 236 and references therein.
A recent, comprehensive study of the optoelectronic properties of bismuth and antimony-based oxyhalides and chalcohalides provided by Ran et al.,169 who reported the DFT calculations of the thermodynamic stability, electronic structure, effective masses of electrons/holes, and optical absorption. Previously, in a series of publications concerning SbSBr,200 SbSI237,238 and SbSeI,175 Akkus et al. computed the linear and non-linear responses to the electric field vector using DFT pseudopotential methods and the SCISSORS approximation239 to account for the self-energy effects. This study provided detailed optical characteristics of the paraelectric phase, and also the ferroelectric phase in the case of SbSBr and SbSI, including the absorption coefficient, refractive index, energy-loss spectrum, reflectivity, optical conductivity, effective number of valence electrons, and effective optical dielectric constant.
Similar linear optical characteristics of the bismuth family (BiSeI,50 BiSI,188 BiSCl,190 BiSBr and BiSeBr240) were reported by Audzijonis et al., who employed GGA-DFT with the full potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) method. Koc et al.179 used the projected augmented wave (PAW) method and PBE functional to calculate the dielectric functions of SbTeI, BiSI, BiTeCl, BiTeBr, and BiTeI. Secuk et al.241 investigated the optical properties of BiTeBr using the LDA approximation without SOC. The first principles optical characteristics of Sb–Se, Te–I178 and BiOX186 are also available. The optical properties were analysed and the origins of the peaks in the spectra were discussed in terms of the calculated density of states: the intra- and inter-band transitions of theoretical dielectric functions, the role of the p-states in the absorption and reflectivity constants, the energy regions of anisotropy of optical constants, and the energy of the volume plasmon. The density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) based on the linear response regime was used to calculate optically active (Raman and IR active) phonon modes for SbSBr and SbSI crystals.242 The exotic optical properties specific to the Rashba interaction have been investigated on the example of BiTeI.243,244 With the help of the first-principles calculations, clear intraband and interband transitions have been identified and the intrinsic character of these excitations have been unveiled, including the Burstein shift, the singular behaviour of the joint density of states and the nature of intraband transitions near the crossing point of Rashba-split bands.
Spectroscopic data
Depending on the system (both the composition of cationic and anionic sublattices), the optical properties of the fifth group chalcohalides vary over a wide range (Table 5 and Fig. 20). There are several representatives of this family which are considered to be suitable candidates for applications in photovoltaics and photocatalysis, and numerous reports may be found on their spectroscopic characteristics (particularly for bismuth-based systems). On the other hand, glasses and amorphous solids (especially those containing arsenic) are underrepresented in this context and only a few authors provide data on their optical properties.

 Fig. 20  The summary of band gap values for various pnictogen chalcohalides. 
The first articles dealing with arsenic chalcohalides may be traced back to the works by Rodot et al.32 (for AsSeI) and Koperles et al.80 (for AsSeI, AsSI and AsS0.5Se0.5I). It was presented in the latter that the exchange of chalcogenides may lead to a slight shift in the band gap width – from 1.78/1.91 eV for AsSeI to 2.1 eV for AsSI. Some overviews of optical properties collected for various glasses (including arsenic-based ones) were also provided by Sanghera et al.72 and Fenner et al.125 Overall, the authors usually focused more on the physical, structural and chemical aspects of arsenic chalcohalides (and there are a significant number of reports on this topic) rather than the optical properties of these systems.
With regard to chalcohalide compounds containing antimony, the situation is similar to compounds containing arsenic – less emphasis is put on optical studies in favour of other structural and physicochemical studies, especially in the case of SbTeX (X = Cl, Br, I).
The first work on the optical properties of SbSeI crystals (of the size between 40 and 250 μm, grown by the Bridgman method) was carried out by Žičkus et al.,245 where the exponential absorption tail was determined from transmission spectra. Li et al.246 determined the reflectance and absorption coefficients for SbSI as a function of small temperature modulations (∼0.02 K) through the null ellipsometry technique with a thermoelectric sample mount. The absorption edge was measured to be around 600 nm (2.07 eV) for crystals grown with the Bridgman technique. Modifications of the SbSI and SbSeI energy band gaps through cationic doping were explored by two groups – Jeon et al.247 and Dong-Woon et al.67 The first group determined the optical band gaps and investigated the effect of cobalt doping on their values. For pure SbSI and SbSeI single crystals, the determined values of the optical band gaps of indirect nature were given as 1.87 eV and 1.62 eV (values estimated from absorption spectra and Tauc plots). Similarly, the second group explored the effect of nickel doping and established the optical band gap width through Tauc plot analysis for single crystal nanoplates (50 nm in length and 10 nm in diameter) to be 1.963 eV for SbSI and 1.674 eV for SbSeI.
An excellent work was done by Nowak et al.,248 comparing 12 different techniques for determining the energy gap of SbSI nanowires using optical spectroscopy – the obtained results ranged from 1.76 eV to 2.34 eV. The authors stated that the multiabsorption fitting of the Kubelka–Munk reemission function technique is the best for the determination of the band gap (in the case of indirect, forbidden character, giving 1.81 eV) and other parameters (e.g. Urbach energy, which was determined to be 0.571 eV). Starczewska et al.142 explored the substitution of the solvent (methanol instead of ethanol) on the sonochemical growth of SbSI nanowires. The change of the employed solvent influenced the lateral dimensions of crystals, which ranged from 10 to 300 nm for methanol and 10 to 50 nm for ethanol. The technique mentioned above was used to determine the band gaps and Urbach energies of both samples. A slight shift in the energy gap and Urbach energy was observed between two samples (the first prepared in methanol and the second in ethanol) – 1.854 eV to 1.829 eV for band gaps and 0.1470 eV to 0.1031 eV for Urbach energies. Cho and co-authors synthesised one-dimensional SbSI crystals (from ∼200 nm to 10 μm thick, from few microns to 0.5 mm long) via a hydrothermal route. The optical band gap value was determined to be 1.84 eV.249 Rod-like crystals (3–4 mm in length, 8–10 mm in diameter) with studded pyramids were obtained by Yang et al.250 with a band gap of approximately 2.14 eV. The unusual morphology of crystals may affect their physicochemical properties – hence a slightly different energy gap compared to those of other reports.
Nowak and co-authors were the first to determine the temperature dependence of the optical band gap for pure SbSI nanowires.251 Subsequent research was conducted by Jesionek et al.252 The authors presented spectral characteristics at different temperatures and the absorption and scattering coefficients at 274 K for SbSI and SbSeI encapsulated in carbon nanotubes (CNT). The temperature dependence of the optical band gap was determined for SbSI@CNT and SbSeI@CNT: at room temperature (293 K) the indirect forbidden optical energy gaps were 1.84 eV and 1.61 eV respectively. Tasviri et al.253 used antimony sulfoiodide nanowires encapsulated in carbon nanotubes as a photocatalyst for organic pollutant degradation. The SbSI@CNT system formed shows better results due to the larger surface area and better electrical conductivity introduced by the CNT, but with no influence on the optical band gap (compared to pure SbSI).
In regard to optical spectroscopy measurements, the optical band gap (1.91 eV) and Urbach energy (0.042 eV) were determined in our work (Kwolek et al.)254 for SbSI nanofibers (30 nm long). The authors also recorded photoluminescence spectra in deuterium oxide (for higher luminescence intensities) to determine the emission band for deeper analysis of their electronic structure. Analysis of the mechanism of photocurrent generation along with photocurrent action spectra recorded suggests their potential in the construction of optoelectronic logic gates (PEPS effect).
For photovoltaic applications, Nie et al.255 presented a solar cell based on SbSI as a light harvester. The optical band gap was determined to be 2.15 eV for SbSI prepared through several cycles of spin-coating of an SbI3 solution on an Sb2S3 layer followed by thermal annealing. The system exhibited photocurrents around 9 mA under standard illumination conditions with a power conversion efficiency of 3.05%.
Wibowo and co-authors143 determined the band gap for SbSeI to be 1.7 eV. The authors employed crystals grown by the Bridgman technique to obtain a single crystal ingot with a needle like morphology. The authors also measured the photoconductivity to determine the mobility–lifetime products for electrons and holes to check the validity of the use of SbSeI as an ionizing radiation detector.
Based on the above reports, it can be noticed that the exchange of chalcogen with the one with a bigger ionic radius decreases the optical band gap of a compound (approximately 1.9 eV for SbSI and 1.65 eV for SbSeI). This reasoning can be supplemented with the theoretical value of the energy gap of SbTeI, which is around 1.256 eV.177
The situation is completely different for materials containing bismuth. To begin with, bismuth oxyfluoride has been recently rediscovered as a good candidate for applications in photocatalysis. In a report by Su et al.256 the authors described the preparation and presented some spectroscopic data on BiOF with the band gap width determined as 3.64 eV. They also compared the photocatalytic activities of several samples with TiO2 (P25) in the process of phenol degradation. Recently, similar attempts – of using BiOF-based systems in photocatalysis – have been made by other groups which applied various modifications. Hu et al. showed nanocomposites made of BiOF/Bi2O3 with the addition of reduced graphene oxide, which exhibited a decrease in the band gap width (to approx. 1.12 eV).54 Vadivel et al. proved that upon modification with Ag nanoparticles and graphitic carbon nitride BiOF also shows an enhanced photocatalytic activity.257 The freshly published articles have covered also the change in fluoride content181,258 and the selection of a preparation method in the context of further improvement of the bismuth oxyfluoride photocatalytic performance.259
The optical and photocatalytic properties of bismuth oxychloride nano- and microstructures have been discussed by several authors. Probably the first systematic report on this material can be attributed to Zhang and co-workers, who investigated the formation of BiOCl micro- and nanoplates, calculated the optical band gap width and compared the photocatalytic activity of this material with that of the TiO2 (P25) reference against methyl orange.260 The authors determined the Eg value to be 3.46 eV and claimed that the fundamental transition is of indirect nature.
The topic was further investigated by An et al., who reported the optical band gap widths for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI microplates – 3.44, 2.76 and 1.85 eV, respectively – and demonstrated that bismuth oxybromide and oxychloride may be efficiently used in photocatalysis (based on the process of rhodamine B degradation and oxygen generation from water). Interestingly, the structures containing iodide did not exhibit any photocatalytic activity.149
Deng and co-authors compared the optical band gaps for several different morphologies of BiOCl and BiOBr obtaining values between 3.5 and 3.3 eV for the former system and between 2.3 and 2.1 eV for the latter.148 The same authors also reported the photoluminescence of bismuth oxychloride single-crystal nanoplates. They obtained crystalline structures approximately 20 nm in height and 200–500 nm in diameter with the band gap width equal to 3.40 eV and a strong emission peak centred at 455 nm recorded at room temperature.261
There are several other reports on the optical band gap tuning achieved through the changes in morphology. Zhang et al. demonstrated how the concentration of citric acid affects the Eg value of BiOCl, getting results in the range between 3.11 and 3.27 eV, discussing also the photocatalytic properties of this system and its photoluminescence. Significantly, they suggested that the transition is of direct nature (contrary to previously mentioned articles).60
Finally, there is a recently published paper comparing the optical properties and the photocatalytic activity of nanosheets composed of bismuth oxyhalides by Lv et al. The authors provide the band gap width values of 3.22, 2.64 and 1.77 eV for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively (Fig. 21).227

At the same time, bismuth oxyhalides have been present in various hybrid materials and nonstoichiometric structures. One of the nanocomposites is described by Shamaila and co-workers with tungsten oxide as the modifier. The authors determined the band gap width to be 3.46 eV for unmodified BiOCl, and a significant absorption below that value for samples containing WO3 was observed. The authors also provided experimental data suggesting that the addition of tungsten oxide to BiOCl enhances the photocatalytic activity towards rhodamine B over the level obtained for pure semiconductors (BiOCl, WO3 and the reference sample of TiO2 (P25)).147
Henle and Kaskel demonstrated the incorporation of BiOCl and BiOI nanoparticles into a polymeric matrix as a convenient way of photochromic composite preparation. The results obtained in the presence of a photoinitiator (Lucirin TPO) were particularly promising for the samples containing bismuth oxyiodide.262 Choi and co-workers showed how CoFe2O4 can be used as a photosensitiser for bismuth oxyhalides263 (with the emphasis put on the photocatalytic performance of the hybrids), Hou et al. discussed how the modification with silver nanoparticles enhances the absorption coefficient264 and Chou and co-authors suggested the modification method with the use of graphene oxide for tuning the optical properties of BiOxIy-based photocatalysts covering a significantly wide range of band gap widths of 0.21–2.19 eV.265
Another study on hybrid materials dealing with SiO2/bismuth oxyhalide systems was presented by Shen et al., with band gap widths of 3.20, 2.75 and 1.76 eV for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively.266 Zhou and co-workers showed an interesting case of a core–shell system with Cd0.2Zn0.8S microspheres as a core material and different bismuth oxyhalides as outer layers. The authors determined the energy of indirect transition to be 3.12, 2.58 and 1.92 eV for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively. They also claimed an enhanced stability and photoactivity of such hybrids (Fig. 22).267

An alternative approach towards modification of bismuth oxyhalides is based on the use of various structures containing bismuth. Duo et al. presented the optical properties of the BiPO4/BiOCl composite, which varied depending on the content of bismuth phosphate, yielding a shift in the absorption edge from 3.12 eV for pure BiOCl to 3.23 eV for the 50% content of BiPO4.53 Similar heterostructures, this time with bismuth sulphide combined with bismuth oxychloride, were discussed by Xu et al. In a recently published article the authors demonstrated the impact of the Bi2S3 content on the optical properties of the hybrid and its photocatalytic performance. Based on the UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, they managed to calculate Eg values to be 3.49, 1.27 and 2.95 eV for unmodified BiOCl, Bi2S3 and Bi2S3–BiOCl composites, respectively.268
Hu et al. presented the electrochemical method for the bismuth oxybromide film preparation with the simultaneous formation of Bi nanopowder. The band gap width reported by the authors for BiOBr was 2.60 eV.51 Jiang and co-workers obtained a composite made of BiOBr and BiOF and observed only a slight change in the optical band gap width but also a significant increase in the photocatalytic efficiency.269
Wang and co-authors proposed a hybrid material composed of bismuth oxybromide grown on bismuth oxide nanocrystals to increase the photocatalytic activity and stability of the system. They also managed to reduce the band gap width from 2.75 eV for pure BiOBr to approximately 2.57 eV for the composite.270 Zuo et al. combined BiOCl with bismuth molybdate, observing for the BiOCl/Bi2MoO6 system a significant decrease in the band gap width.271
Peng and co-workers realised the optical band gap tuning through the formation of heterostructures with bromide-deficient Bi12O17Br2 and Bi24O31Br10 exhibiting Eg at a level of 2.59 eV for the former one and the indirect transition.272 At the same time, Su et al. presented another Br-deficient, hydrothermally prepared nanostructure – Bi5O7Br – which showed an increased band gap width of approximately 3.13 eV.57 Bai and co-authors demonstrated two bismuth-rich nanosystems – Bi4O5Br2 and Bi4O5I2 – with increased photocatalytic efficiency towards hydrogen production and the indirect optical transitions with Eg values of 2.32 and 2.03 eV, respectively.273
A very similar structure (i.e. Bi4O5Br2) was presented by Mao et al. – here the authors claimed that the band gap width was approximately 2.0 eV.274 Also Li and co-workers presented a Bi-rich system with a stoichiometry of Bi5O7I combined with BiOBrxI1−x. Here, both the photocatalytic activity towards methyl orange and the optical band gap have been successfully tuned and the authors obtained Eg values equal to 2.95, 2.84, 2.15 and 1.98 eV for Bi5O7I, BiOBr, BiOBrxI1−x and Bi5O7I/BiOBrxI1−x, respectively.275
The story about the research on the optical properties of bismuth sulfohalides starts with the publication by Xu et al., in which the authors use reflectance ellipsometry in order to measure their differential polarizabilities and determine their refractive indices. They also found the band gap width of BiSI to be 1.56 eV.276 Then, after ca. twenty years, a paper by Su et al. emerged in which the authors provided a Eg value of 1.8 eV for bismuth sulfoiodide microneedles.154 Hahn and co-workers presented the preparation method and comprehensive characterisation of BiSI microrods in the context of possible application in photovoltaics. The UV-Vis measurements revealed the indirect transition with a band gap width of 1.57 eV.277
The use of BiSI nanostructures has been also discussed by Aguiar et al. for ionizing radiation detection, but little new data on their optical properties were given here.278 A quite convenient synthesis method for BiSI, BiSeI and BiSBr1−xIx solid solutions was proposed by Kunioku et al. The authors were able to tune the indirect band gap in the range of 1.71–1.51 eV, lowering the band gap value with increasing content of iodide (the limiting values are 1.71 and 1.51 for BiSBr and BiSI, respectively). This system has been found to obey Vegard's law with a linear dependence of the band gap on the molar fraction of iodine.279 The band gap widths for bismuth sulfoiodides are also given by Groom and co-workers – 1.55 eV for BiSI and 0.82 eV for iodide-deficient Bi13S18I2, which also exhibits significant absorption below that value.130 The same group continued the research on BiSI and presented the results of bismuth substitution with antimony. They proved that this method is sufficient to tune the band gap width, with the limiting values of 1.55 eV for pure BiSI and 1.86 eV for pure SbSI.280
Although other halide ions are definitely underrepresented here, there are several reports on the optical properties of bismuth sulfobromide. Jin and co-workers published an article on BiSBr where they calculated the energy gap width associated with the indirect transition to be 2.01 eV.137 Later, Deng et al. presented Bi19S27Br3 superstructures in which the energy gap was lowered to 1.42 eV and the data analysis shown in the article indicates the direct nature of the transition.128
The first reports on bismuth selenohalides may be traced back to 1984 when Zickus and Audzijonis discussed the optical properties of SbSeI and BiSeI. Among others, they calculated the Urbach parameters.281 Dong-Woon et al. obtained the band gap width value of 1.28 eV for BiSeI single crystals obtained with the use of the Bridgman technique,67 and Lee and co-workers confirmed this result, determining the indirect type energy gap width to be 1.28 eV for single crystals prepared with the same method.282
The literature is also rather rich with theoretical works in which different parameters – including some optical properties – are calculated based on various numerical approaches. Nonetheless, this topic is covered in the preceding section of this review and will be not discussed here.
Due to the fact that BiTeX (X = Cl, Br, I) compounds exhibit the Rashba effect, a great deal of research has been done in the characterisation of those systems. Lee et al.243 determined the band gap experimental values ranging from approximately 0.35 eV to 0.6 eV depending on the carrier concentration of prepared samples of BiTeI. That effect coincides well with the fitted curves based on the Burstein–Moss shift. A Fourier-transform spectrometer and a grating-type spectrometer were used to perform optical measurements. The authors also recorded several intra-band transitions related to the Rashba effect. In two works, Makhnev et al.283,284 measured optical transitions in BiTeX using the optical ellipsometry method. For each material, the energy band gaps associated with γ-transitions were determined to be 0.72 eV, 0.59 eV and 0.33 eV for BiTeCl, BiTeBr and BiTeI, respectively. These results corroborate the BiTeI (0.38 eV)285 and BiTeCl (0.8 eV)286 band gaps established through the angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurement. Additionally, the band gap of BiTeBr was established by Martin et al.287 through infrared optical reflectance spectroscopy to be approximately 0.6 eV.
Furthermore, the values obtained for BiTeI and BiTeBr are consistent with the energy gap values obtained through several other measurement methods.288 In their work, Kulbachinskii et al. presents collected band gap values ranging from 0.37 eV to 0.48 eV for BiTeI and from 0.472 eV to 0.59 eV for BiTeBr depending on the temperature, the technique used or the character of the transition.
Xi et al.286 explored the pressure-induced closing of the band gap in BiTeI. Based on the XRD analysis of the a/c ratio (where a and c are lattice parameters), metallic states were recorded for pressures in the range 2.0–2.9 GPa. Due to the low magnitude of the band gap of BiTeI, infrared spectroscopy was employed to further specify the point of transition, which was found to be 2.2 GPa. Rusinov and co-authors289 determined the absorption and refractive indexes through spectral ellipsometry for BiTeCl and BiTeI compounds. The experimental results coincided well with the theoretical calculations.
Electrical properties
Definitely less attention in comparison to the other physicochemical properties of pnictogen chalcohalides has been paid to the electrochemical and electrical characterization of this class of compounds. This is mainly due to the difficulties in the Hall effect measurements related to the low carrier mobility and high resistivity of chalcohalide compounds. The electrical characterization of several compounds including mainly studies of the Hall effect (Hall mobility), the thermoelectric effect (the Seebeck coefficient) and the conductivity measurements.
AsSX (X = I, Br) systems
In the literature there are only a few short reports concerning the electrical properties of AsSI and AsSBr. Glasses from the AsSI system are insulators of high resistivity, measured at room temperature, exceeding 1013 Ω cm.291 A dozen years later Turyanitsa et al. reported that the resistivity in the AsSI system changes from 1016 to 1012 Ω cm with an increase of iodine content.292 Perason et al. investigated the electrical properties of glasses containing more than 60 at% of sulphur and 3–9 at% of bromine. The reported resistivities exceed 3 × 1014 Ω cm.293 Sanghera et al. reported that the DC electrical conductivity in the AsSBr system measured at 293 K changes from 10−15 to 10−12 Ω−1 cm−1 and depends on the stoichiometry of the material. Based on the presented data, it is also visible that the conductivity increases with a decrease of the glass transition temperature as well as with halide content. They reported that both the liquid and solid phases exhibit properties typical for the semiconducting state and the melt conductivity ranges from 10−5 to 10−6 Ω−1 cm−1.72
AsSeX (X = Br) system
In the literature there is very little information concerning the electrical properties of the AsSeBr system. Data presented by Sanghera et al. indicate that the conductivities of the compounds in the system range from 10−13 to 10−11 Ω−1 cm−1 and increase with bromine content.72
AsTeX (X = I, Br, Cl) systems
Arsenium based chalcohalides exist in both the vitreous and crystalline forms.32 The vitreous semiconductors as well as crystalline forms exhibit the Hall effect and photoelectrical and thermoelectric properties. Furthermore, under certain conditions, these kinds of materials show sudden change in their conductivity values.86
The Hall effect measurements on chalcogenide glasses were reported for the first time by Nazarova and Kolomiets in 1960. The measurements were performed at room temperature with the alternated current (AC) technique. The observed Hall mobility was independent of the glass composition.294 In 1964 Peck and Dewald reported the Hall effect measurements on the As–Te–Br and As–Te–I systems in the temperature range from 293 to 363 K. They applied the direct current (DC) technique with strong magnetic fields, up to 70 kOe.295 They reported the Hall mobility (μH) in the As–Te–I system from 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature to 0.12 cm2 V−1 s−1 at 363 K. Similar measurements were performed in the As–Te–Br system and observed μH values of 0.01 and 0.10 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature and 363 K, respectively.295 All performed measurements confirm the sign anomaly of the charge carriers. The Hall effect measurements indicate n-type conductivity, while thermoelectric measurements indicate p-type conductivity. Mott,296 Gubanov,297 and Cohen et al.298 suppose that the band structures of classical semiconducting materials are well described, but there are some exceptions, especially when the curves of density states form tails inside the forbidden gap.298,299 Thus from a theoretical viewpoint the conduction mechanism of chalcogenide compounds is not clear.
The As–Te–I system was investigated for the first time by Eaton.86 Eaton observed in this system a conductivity switching effect, which is related to the thermal breakdown of the material, which in turn is related to its semiconducting properties.86 In subsequent years this system was investigated with regard to its electrical properties by Prasad and Hilborn87 and Pearson et al.300 Seager et al.301 reported results concerning the analysis of electronic transport measurements in As50Te50−xIx (x = 0, 2, 20) glasses. The observed Hall mobility changes exponentially with temperature, which indicates that the analyzed compounds exhibit n-type conductivity, whereas the analysis of thermoelectric power indicated opposite p-type similarly to that reported by Dewald and Peck.295 The observed phenomenon was explained by the small polaron hopping model. μH observed by the authors ranged from 10−2 to 10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1. Peck and Dewald also observed that electronic conduction in this system varies from ca. 10−3 Ω−1 cm−1 (low iodine content) to 10−8 Ω−1 cm−1 (high iodine content).295 Seager et al. described observed effects based on the small-polaron hopping motion of holes, resulting from the existence of As2Te3 two-dimensional ribbons incorporated into a glassy matrix. The authors believe that carrier transport control in these compounds is mainly related to the presence of the As2Te3 moieties.301 Analyses of the carrier mobilities of similar chalcogenide glasses performed by Roilos lead to similar conclusions concerning the transport nature in AsTeI compounds.299 Results reported by Seager et al.301 as well as Johnson and Quinn302 for low iodine compounds show similar conductivity to that observed by Brodsky and Weiser for amorphous arsenic telluride (As2Te3) films.303 It should be underlined that the μH values are also in good agreement with values observed by Dewald and Peck at room temperature for As53Te43I4 glass (μ ≈ 0.08 cm2 V−1 s−1).295,304 All reported AsTeI samples, except for those containing 2% of iodine, exhibit the same carrier activation energy of ca. 0.06 eV, which is close to those reported by Roilos (ca. 0.05 eV).299 The carrier activation energies were determined by Seager et al. using the measured Seebeck coefficient of 0.19 μV K−1.301,304 Barders et al. investigated the influence of annealing on the electrical properties of As50Te50−xIx (x = 0, 2, 5, 20). The authors reported that the conductivity of the surface layer is almost temperature independent and the value of activation energy is ca. 10−2 eV. An effect of the annealing process resulting in an increase of material conductivity was more visible for compounds with low iodine concentration, i.e. x = 0, 2.305
SbSX (X = I, Br, Cl) systems
The dielectric properties of SbSI – the first ferroelectric material which is also photoconductive – were investigated by Fatuzzo et al. The measured dielectric constant–temperature dependence indicated the ferroelectric character of the material.306 Audzijonis et al. reported that SbSI has three phases: ferroelectric (T < 295 K), antiferroelectric (T < 410 K) and paraelectric (T > 410 K).307 The reported conductivities of SbSI glasses depending on their compositions range from 10−10 to 10−7 Ω−1 cm−1.72 The charge carrier mobilities of these materials change from 50 to 100 cm2 V−1 s−1.308 SbSBr similarly to SbSI exhibits semiconducting ferroelectric properties.309 Depending on the state, the electrical conductivity value was 10−7 Ω−1 cm−1 for crystals and 10−10 Ω−1 cm−1 for the glass phase. Differences in composition may change the conductivity for few orders of magnitude for both crystal and metallic phases.72 Theoretical investigations performed by Kvedaravicius et al. indicated that the SbSCl compound is of non-ferroelectric nature.213
SbSeX (X = I, Br) systems
Wibowo et al. analyzed the direct-current (DC) conductivity of SbSeI. The authors determined the Seebeck coefficient at room temperature and the resistivity–temperature dependence starting from room temperature up to 500 K under vacuum conditions. The reported room temperature resistivity value was 108 Ω cm143 and was close to that reported by Chepur et al.310 The temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient indicates an n-type conductivity of the compound.143 Audzijonis et al. reported that SbSeI depending on temperature can exist as antiferroelectric (T < 410 K) and paraelectric (T > 410 K) phases.307 The electrical conductivity of SbSeBr reported by Pikka et al. is 10–7 Ω−1 cm−1 and is very close to that reported for SbSeI.311 The SbSeCl compound is of non-ferroelectric nature and more complex experimental analyses have not been reported in the literature.213
SbTeX (X = I) system
The electrical properties of SbTeI have been investigated by Bubey et al.; however, these data seem to be unreliable.312
BiOX (X = I, Br, Cl) systems
Bismuth oxychloride is a very interesting semiconducting compound mainly due to its photoconductivity313 and possibilities of thermal modulation of the conductivity.45 In the literature, however, there are only a few reports concerning the electrical conductivity of BiOCl. The electrical conductivity of the material was studied for the first time by Shtilikha et al. Measurements were performed in the temperature range 90–300 K. The reported results indicated the insulating character of BiOCl manifested by the negligible electronic component of the heat conductivity and low conductivity ranging from 10−10 to 10−13 Ω−1 cm−1.314 Banerjee et al. investigated the electrical conductivity of p-type bismuth oxychloride drop-cast nanosheets. The authors found that the conductivity activation energy in the material was 862 mV in the temperature range from 300 to 420 K. The recorded I–V characteristics also indicated that the conductivity of this p-type semiconducting material decreases with decrease of oxygen partial pressure (Fig. 23).315
 Fig. 23  Arrhenius plots of conductivity versus reciprocal temperature yield the activation energy Ea = 862 meV and 810 meV, respectively (p1 = 1000 mbar and p2 = 3 mbar) (a). Plots of conductivity versus oxygen partial pressure (in a logarithmic scale) of the BiOCl nanosheet electrode at 425 K under a applied bias of 30 V (b). Reproduced from ref. 315 with permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry. 
Another BiOCl form was characterized by Wang et al. The authors analyzed the properties of single-crystalline microplates. They observed that for a sample with a diameter of 10 μm the resistivity initially increases with lowering temperature and drops at temperatures below 8.52 K. Nonlinear behaviour was also observed in the resistivity – excitation current dependences.316 Recently, the electrical properties of BiOCl, BiOI and BiOBr single crystals have been studied by Lontyk et al. in the temperature range from 2 to 300 K. The Seebeck coefficients were determined to be 115, 97.4 and 63.1 μV K−1 for BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI, respectively. The characterized crystals exhibit relatively high anisotropy in the activation energy, especially in the case of BiOI. Below 250 K the electrical conductivities of these compounds are smaller than 10−15 Ω−1 cm−1. Based on the experimental values assuming T = 10 K and an electron to hole mobility ratio of 0.2, the authors stated that independently of the present halogen BiOX (Cl, Br, I) are p-type semiconductors.317 On the other hand, Cai et al. reported that in the case of BiOI iodine vacancies appearing at a slightly lower temperature than that corresponding to phase transition may result in a change in the semiconductor behavior from p-type to n-type.318 Kwolek et al. reported BiOI preparations showing n-type conductivity on the basis of photocurrent and surface photovoltage measurements.254,319
BiSX (X = I, Br, Cl) systems
Needle-like structures of n-type BiSI have been investigated for the first time with regard to their electrical properties by Horak and Cernak. The reported BiSI exhibits high resistivity ranging from 108 to 109 Ω cm. An increase of temperature up to 200 °C in an inert atmosphere results in an increase of the electrical conductivity.320 In 2012, Hahn et al. analyzed BiSI and BiSeI with regard to their potential photovoltaic applications, confirming their n-type conductivity.321 BiSBr exhibits semiconducting ferroelectric properties, but no complex investigation concerning its electrical properties has been reported in the literature.309 The electrical resistivity of BiSBr ranging from 103 to 104 Ω cm308 is significantly lower than that reported for BiSI, while BiSCl has been reported to be paraelectric.124
BiSeX (X = I) system
BiSeI exhibits piezoelectric, ferrolectric322 and photoelectric323 properties. Additionally, depending on the preparation technique these materials can show n- or p-type conductivity. Genesha et al. studied the dielectric properties of BiSeI crystalline platelets. The measurements were carried out perpendicular to the (110) plane in the temperature range from 308 to 426 K (Fig. 24). Through measurement of the capacitance of the crystal placed between Ag electrodes, the authors determined the dielectric permittivities at fixed frequencies of 1, 10 and 100 kHz.45,120 Up to now, in the literature, there has been no information concerning the characterization of BiSeBr as well as BiSeCl compounds regarding their electrical properties.

BiTeX (X = I, Br, Cl) systems
BiTeI is a ferroelectric semiconductor with a highly anisotropic layered structure.324 The thermoelectric properties of both BiTeBr and BiTeI single crystals grown by the Bridgman method were investigated by Kulbachinskii et al.288 The temperature dependence of the conductivity as well as the Seebeck coefficient analyzed in the temperature range from 5 K to 300 K indicated that these compounds show n-type conductivity. The electron concentration and mobility were determined at 77 and 300 K. The Hall effect was studied under magnetic field induction of 0.3 T. It was observed that the electron concentration is independent of temperature and is 4.6 × 1019 cm−3 for BiTeI and 1.3–1.4 × 1019 cm−3 for BiTeBr, whereas the charge carrier mobility is strongly temperature dependent. An increase of temperature from 77 to 300 K results in a drop of electron mobility in both cases – from 528 to 242 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BiTeI and from 1450 to 310 cm2 V−1 s−1 for BiTeBr. At room temperature the electron mobility of BiTeBr is 2.7 times higher than that of BiTeI.65 Ishizaka et al. on the basis of the in-plane electrical resistivity measurements of single crystal BiTeI concluded that this compound exhibits metallic behavior down to 2 K. The authors similarly to Kulbachinskii et al. observed that the Hall coefficient is practically temperature independent. The reported electron concentration of 4.54 × 1019 cm−3 is very close to the value reported previously.285 Lostak et al. on the basis of the optical measurements estimated the concentration of electrons in BiTeI compounds to be 4.7 × 1019 cm−3, which is very close to those determined later by Ishizaka and Kulbachinskii et al. The values obtained by Lostak et al. from the optical measurements are in agreement with those obtained based on the determined Hall constant.325 BiTeCl has been recently found to be a superconductive material under high pressure conditions. Ying et al. reported that the superconductivity in this compound emerges when the charge density wave or the resistivity maximum is suppressed by the applied pressure. The authors investigated the properties of BiTeCl single crystals grown by the self-flux method. The resistivity was analyzed not only at different pressures but also at different values of the magnetic field induction vector (Fig. 25). The resistivities measured at pressures below 4 GPa indicated metallic behavior and are close to that observed under ambient pressure even though this material was thought to be a Rashba semiconductor.326 Similar behaviors were reported previously for BiTeI by Ideue et al.327 and for BiTeBr and BiTeCl by Akrap et al.328 It should also be underlined that BiTeCl is the first ever observed topological superconductor.116 All the data reported in this section are collated in Table S3 (ESI†).

Photoelectrochemistry and photocatalysis
The presence of an internal electric field in semiconducting oxo- and chalcohalides makes them ideal candidates for photocatalysis. Despite their application potential, in the literature there are only limited studies about the surface photochemistry and photocatalytic performance of these ferroelectric materials. The most distinctive members of the V–VI–VII group are bismuth oxyhalides. BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I) compounds exhibit promising photocatalytic properties under both UV and visible light irradiation.184,226,256,260,329–338 A very good photocatalytic activity is a result of the open and layered crystalline structure with predominately exposed (001) facets (Fig. 26).151,260,339
 Fig. 26  Schematic picture of the face-dependent photoreactivity of BiOCl single crystalline nanosheets. Reproduced from ref. 366 with permission of American Chemical Society. 
The reports concerning the photocatalytic performance of BiOX are focused on the decomposition of organic pollutants, CO2 reduction and selective organic transformations. In 2006 Zhang and co-workers260 reported a notably high catalytic activity of BiOCl in methyl orange degradation under UV irradiation. This activity even exceeds the efficiency of commercially used TiO2 (P25). Since then, the interests of scientists have focused on BiOX (X = Cl, Br, I) and their photocatalytic performance.60,331,337,340–375 Moreover, it is noted that with increasing atomic number of the halogen atom, the band gap of BiOX decreases: BiOF (∼3.6 eV256), BiOCl (∼3.2 eV331), BiOBr (∼2.8 eV331) and BiOI (∼1.7 eV331), vide supra. This effect allows tuning their redox properties and thus photocatalytic activity.374
It has been proved that dimensionality is a very important factor that affects the photocatalytic properties. Nanomaterials tend to improve the photocatalytic efficiency due to their high surface area to volume ratios and higher concentrations of active sites. 1D nanostructures (nanorods/wires) are objects with thicknesses and widths in the nanoscale range, but their lengths can be several micrometres or even longer.374,376 From this viewpoint, 1D semiconductor catalysts are attractive because of the presence of the preferred direction of charge carrier flow (vide supra). Due to the highly anisotropic layered crystal structures of BiOX compounds, they tend to grow into two dimensional (2D) nanostructures (nanoplates/sheets). 2D systems due to their lamellar (graphite-like) structures are built with interlamellar van der Waals weak interactions or electrostatic forces, which enhance the photocatalytic activity of BiOX.260 The high surface area to volume ratio for this class of materials facilitates fast separation of the photoinduced electrons and holes, which favours the efficiency of photocatalytic reactions.374
Jiang et al.366 synthesized BiOCl single-crystalline nanosheets with exposed (001) and (010) facets via a simple hydrothermal route. It is interesting to note that nanosheets with exposed (001) facets show more effective photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange in the UV range, while (010) facets exhibit a higher degradation activity under visible light. It means that the photoactivity of BiOCl nanosheets is highly dependent on the face exposure. The facet effect of BiOX was reported for the first time in 2011.377 Recently, Zhang's group investigated in detail the facet effect of BiOCl.340,366,378 The (001) facet-dominant BiOCl nanosheets show efficient photodegradation of pollutants under UV light, which results from the inner electric field, facilitating charge carrier separation. The (010) facet-dominant BiOCl nanosheets exhibit higher activity in methyl orange degradation under visible light because of their larger surface area and open channel characteristics, which contribute to the increased contact between the photocatalyst and dye molecules. Due to this fact, the (010) BiOCl nanosheets enhance the adsorption capacity of methyl orange molecules and thus facilitate interfacial charge transfer, resulting in the oxidation of the dye. Fig. 26 presents a schematic illustration of the face-dependent photoreactivity of BiOCl single crystalline nanosheets.366
Some preliminary data on facet effects for BiOBr337 and BiOI353,368,379 are also available. BiOBr as nanosheets with thicknesses from 9 to 31 nm was synthesized by Zhang et al.337 The visible-light-driven photocatalytic efficiency of BiOBr in rhodamine B degradation improves from ca. 83% to 94% when the thickness is decreased. It is worth mentioning that BiOBr nanosheets show significantly worse capabilities for methyl orange and methylene blue degradation in comparison to rhodamine B degradation. This photocatalytic selectivity in removing the organic pollutants results from the preferential binding of rhodamine B to the oxygen atom that terminates (001) facets.337
Nevertheless, the most attractive photocatalytic nanostructures are 3D architectures. They are characterized by enhanced light harvesting, shortened diffusion pathways, the presence of numerous reactive sites and fast interfacial charge transfer.374 Moreover, their chemical composition plays an important role considering catalytic features. Zhang and co-workers331 described the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange solution under visible light. They found that the BiOI architecture exhibits better efficiency towards the photocatalytic degradation of methyl orange than BiOBr and BiOCl. Although BiOI shows higher photocatalytic activity than BiOBr and BiOCl for methyl orange decomposition under visible light,331 BiOBr with a band gap of 2.8 eV shows the best oxidation and reduction properties under full light spectrum irradiation among all bismuth oxohalides.380 The BiOBr properties are a result of the hybridization of O 2p and Bi 6s orbitals, which results in band gap narrowing and enabling efficient conversion of visible light.334
In summary, BiOX are promising photocatalysts. Numerous papers about BiOX refer to the processes of the degradation of organic pollutants, especially dye pollutants in wastewater. Moreover, BiOX have promising potential applications for photocatalytic indoor-gas purification, water splitting, organic synthesis, and selective oxidation of alcohols.338,339,346,381,382 One of them is BiOI, which exhibits high photocatalytic activity under both visible light344,345,349,351,360,383 and near-IR,384 whereas BiOBr and BiOCl present very good photocatalytic activity under the full sunlight spectrum.380 Due to this fact, BiOBr and BiOCl are frequently studied as photocatalysts in various systems. BiOBr can remove more types of organic pollutants (including dyes,294,342,358,361,364,365,374 phenol,342,359 toluene369 and tetrabromobisphenol A355) than other BiOX photocatalysts. Furthermore, BiOBr was used to photo-degrade biological substances. Fang et al. demonstrated that BiOBr can degrade microcystin-LR in water under visible light irradiation, while Yu and co-workers demonstrated that hierarchical BiOBr microspheres can be used to remove Micrococcus lylae from water under fluorescent light irradiation.352
The photocatalytic properties of less known BiOF have been reported in 2010.256 BiOF materials show high UV light384 photocatalytic performance in the degradation of many organic pollutants such as phenol, methyl orange, rhodamine B and salicylic acid in aqueous media. This system was able to induce photooxidation of benzene vapour in air.256 A lot of studies have been carried out to investigate the photocatalytic activity of BiOCl nanomaterials. Jin et al.385 demonstrated that ultrathin BiOCl nanosheets can be used for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CH4. However, due to its wide band gap, unmodified BiOCl shows photocatalytic activity only under UV light irradiation.226 Zhang and co-workers reported the synthesis of flower-like BiOI hierarchical structures, which present higher (as compared with BiOI nanoplates)349 photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation towards organic pollutants. The morphology and properties of the obtained product usually depend on the synthesis technique. Detailed data describing the catalytic properties of various BiOX preparations are collated in Table S2 (ESI†).
1D structure growth is caused by stacking ribbon-like structures along the atomic chain direction.249,386 Additionally, the formation of a lower number of dangling bonds at the surface and cross-band hybridization between the n s2 (Sb3+) cation and I− ion promote highly efficient degradation of organic pollutants.386,387 The literature review indicates the BiOX and SbSI compounds among other chalcohalides with prospective applications in photovoltaics, photocatalysis and optoelectronics. The UV-Vis adsorption edges of BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI are located at 370 nm, 440 nm and 670 nm, respectively, i.e. in the near-UV and visible light regions.331,377 Their catalytic efficiencies, however, in the case of sunlight irradiation are still unsatisfactory and limit their practical utility (cf.Fig. 21).388
In the case of BiOI we have previously presented the mechanism of photocurrent generation. Bismuth oxyiodide has been extensively studied with regard to the photocatalytic decomposition of organic pollutants from wastewater345,389 and photovoltaic applications.390,391 The increase of interest in this material is caused by the relatively narrow value of the band gap (the narrowest among the other bismuth oxyhalides),183 low toxicity and stability in water.345 Generally, for high performance, a photocatalyst requires a high oxidation potential of the holes in the valence band (VB) and an enough reduction potential of the electrons in the conduction band (CB),390 which could be offered by wide-band-gap semiconductors.392
Bulk BiOI has a band gap energy in the range of 1.85–1.94 eV, whereas BiOI nanoparticles have a band gap energy of about 2.95 eV and nonstoichiometric phase Bi4O5I2 has a band gap of 2.03 eV (Table 5). BiOI generates anodic photocurrents in a wide potential window (Fig. 27); nevertheless, the intensity of the photocurrent dramatically decreases when the material is exposed to light for a long time due to the irreversible photocorrosion processes. Moreover, BiOI shows the so-called Photoelectrochemical Photocurrent Switching (PEPS) Effect,393–396 as described by Kwolek et al.319 PEPS is an effect related to the change in the photocurrent polarity (anodic to cathodic transition or vice versa) resulting from the changes in the electrode potential or the wavelength of the incident light. Fig. 28 presents the photocurrent profile recorded for the BiOI material. The shape of the photocurrent pulses is a rectangular envelope, which indicates the rapid setting of the steady-state conditions, indicating that photogenerated charge carriers are efficiently collected by the conductive support and the recombination processes as well as other side processes (e.g. surface charging due to the high impedance of the semiconductor/conductor interface) are insignificant.319 These effects make BiOI a potential candidate for unconventional optoelectronic devices and chemosensors.397

Bulk BiOBr has an optical band gap of 2.84 eV. The edge potentials of the valence (VB) and conduction bands (CB) are −4.24 eV and −1.4 eV respectively.398 However, the band gap of the BiOCl nanosheets was found to be 3.34 eV with the conduction and valence band edges at −3.63 eV and −6.97 eV with respect to vacuum, respectively.315 An oxygen vacancy is formed in situ on the (001) facets of BiOCl under UV irradiation. Although the formed oxygen vacancy significantly enhances the absorption of BiOCl in the visible range, it plays a negative role in the dye degradation processes. The oxygen vacancy could effectively trap photoexcited electrons, thus inducing the photocorrosion of the photocatalyst. This results in a decrease of the reaction yields and may also block the degradation pathways involving O2− radicals.399
Among the V–VI–VII compounds, antimony sulfoiodide (SbSI) has attracted attention due to its considerable photocatalytic activities.253,254,386 SbSI nanowires exhibit promising stable photocatalytic activity under visible light that comes from their one dimensional (1D) structure, large static dielectric constant and high stability in aqueous medium.253,254,386 Although SbSI was synthesized earlier than BiOX,306,400 its photoelectrochemical properties have not been widely explored yet. From all various synthesis techniques of SbSI (sonochemical method,401 sol–gel technique,402 pulsed laser deposition403 or melt fluctuation growth404), the sonochemical method presented by Nowak et al.401 is the most attractive technique due to its simplicity, low cost, high speed and high efficiency. Moreover, this method allows easily synthesizing 1D materials with relatively high surface area-to-volume ratios. Due to SbSI's 1D structure, large static dielectric constant (ε = ∼50000)306 and exceptionally high stability in aqueous solutions, this form exhibits appropriate properties for application as visible light photocatalysts.253,254,386Fig. 29 shows the mechanism of the photocurrent generation of antimony sulfoiodide. The anodic photocurrent is generated by the straightforward oxidation reaction of the iodide in the electrolyte with the hole coming from the valence band. The cathodic photocurrent occurs when the conduction band edge of the semiconductor is higher than the reduction potential of molecular oxygen dissolved in the electrolyte (−0.16 V vs. SHE394).254

The review of the literature revealed that mixed-halogen materials exhibit even higher photocatalytic efficiencies than BiOCl and BiOI individually.405 Furthermore, doping is an efficient method to improve photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic performances. BiOCl, BiOBr and BiOI present similar layer structures, atom arrangements and chemical compositions, which allow introducing other halogen atoms into their atomic lattice. Therefore, many bismuth nanomaterials with bismuth oxides, such as BiOClxBr1−x, BiOClxI1−x and BiOIxBr1−x, have been successfully synthesized by means of wet chemistry.335,405–409 On the other hand, in the case of BiOI doping with atoms of foreign elements is not as effective as it is in the case of halogen atom doping.410,411 It is related to the very high symmetry of its layered structure, which leads to a low thermodynamic solubility of heteroatoms in the bismuth oxyhalide lattice.412
Conclusions
Pnictogen chalcohalides constitute a versatile family of compounds. Usually they are wide bad gap semiconductors with similar layered or chain-like structures. They are stable and relatively easily prepared. In contrast to other groups of compound semiconductors, their electronic structures as well as electrical and optical properties can be easily tuned via halogen or chalcogen exchange and thus their properties can be varied within a large window.
The variety of elemental compositions and crystal structures is characteristic of halochalcogenides presented in this review. Most of the presented structures have a 3D arrangement of chain like or ladder like 1D structures connected in various manners. Bismuth compounds, on the other hand, have a tendency to form 2D planes. Among the very different structures, a few common tendencies can be found. The trend in which the cell parameters change with the size of halogen is observed in BiOX compounds. Due to the arrangement of the halogen atoms on one side of the Bi atom, the BiOX structures change mostly with respect to the c parameter of the cell. The isomorphism of Sb8O11Cl2 and Sb8O11Br2, and Bi19S27Cl3, Bi19S27Br3, and Bi19S27l3 structures is also a direct result of the changes in the halogen atom, which induce small changes in the cell parameters.
As for the spectroscopic properties of the investigated compounds, several trends can be easily noticed. First of all, the arsenic and antimony compounds are not very sensitive to chalcogenide substitution. In the case of bismuth compounds the exchange of either chalcogen or halogen ions with elements from higher periods leads to a significant decrease in the band gap width. Interestingly, this effect is not fully explainable based solely on the changes in the electronegativity values – it is clearly visible in the case of the Eg values for BiOI, BiSI and BiSeI – surely other factors have to be taken into consideration here. Another conclusion may be drawn on the tuning of the Eg value – this may be done over a relatively wide range through the changes in stoichiometry. Taking into account both the abovementioned observations, the discussed family of semiconductors appears to be a versatile platform for the implementation of interactions with light.
In the undoped state they all are of a very high specific resistivity (1010–1015 Ω cm), which decreases with doping to ca. 103–104 Ω cm, irrespective of their composition. The lowest electron mobility is observed in the case of arsenic compounds (10−2–10−1 cm2 V−1 s−1), which slightly increases for antimony analogues (100–102 cm2 V−1 s−1), whereas in the case of bismuth compounds it is the highest and in the case of BiTeBr (1450 cm2 V−1 s−1) slightly outbalances the value recorded for crystalline silicon (1400 cm2 V−1 s−1).
These features determine the potential applications of pnicnide chalcohalides: bismuth oxyhalides mainly as photocatalysts and heavier bismuth analogues for various emerging semiconducting technologies. Moreover, they are well suited for the fabrication of 1D structures. Due to the collaborative interactions between various anions within their lattice, they exhibit properties not easily available for other materials, e.g. high tolerance for defects. Therefore, they seem to be promising materials of choice for future electronic and catalytic applications.

 	Fig. 17  The schematic orbital interaction in typical bismuth or antimony chalcohalide. The valence band maximum is constituted by the antibonding orbitals (from the s of the metal and the p of the halogen).	 

 	Fig. 18  Representative partial density of states for a V–Vi–VII semiconductor (here for BiOF as presented in Khan et al.).173 The s orbitals are separated (in terms of energy) in the conduction band, whereas the p orbitals interact with each other, enhancing cation–anion bond covalency.	 

 	Fig. 19  The comparison between the direct and indirect band gaps of antimony (a) and bismuth (b) chalcohalides.
