Well-aligned pyrite nanorod arrays were successfully grown on a transparent and conductive glass substrate of fluorine-doped tin oxide using a template-directed method. ZnO nanorod arrays were used as the initial template to produce Fe(OH)3 nanotube arrays and then the Fe(OH)3 nanotube arrays were used as a template to produce pyrite nanorod arrays.

The prepared pyrite nanorod films showed outstanding light absorption and enhanced photocurrents compared with nanoparticle FeS2 films. The excellent optical and photoelectrical performance of FeS2 nanorod films is attributed to the unique one-dimensional ordered architecture, which has large surface areas for light harvest and provides a direct and short pathway for charge transport, reducing the combination loss of photoelectrons. The method offers a new strategy for designing nanostructured materials with one-dimensional ordered architectures for high-performance photovoltaic devices.
1 Introduction
Pyrite (iron sulphide, FeS2) has recently been seen as a promising candidate for photovoltaic applications and has been receiving much attention due to its many excellent properties. An extremely high light absorption coefficient (>105 cm−1 for hv > 1.3 eV), an appropriate band gap (Eg = 0.95 eV) and, most importantly, the advantage of high abundance (Fe is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust), non-toxicity and low cost make pyrite the most important photovoltaic candidate among 23 types of existing semiconducting photovoltaic systems1 that could potentially lead to lower-cost products compared with conventional silicon solar cells. In addition, pyrite is currently used as an attractive thin-layer absorber in photovoltaic2,3 and photoelectrochemical4,5 applications. Work has been carried out previously on the preparation and photoelectronic properties of high-purity pyrite with different nanostructures, such as nanocrystal inks,6,7 nanocubes,8,9 and nanowires/nanorods.10–13 Some of the methods developed, such as the control of the chemical potential of sulfur,13 the hot-injection route14,15 and the introduction of metal oxide layers,16 provide great potential for the low-cost, large-area, solution-based processing of pyrite thin films for photovoltaic applications. Despite its attractive properties, the great limitation to pyrite's widespread application in photovoltaic devices is its low solar conversion efficiency, which has remained below 3% (ref. 17) for pyrite-based solar devices. The main reason for this is attributed to the phase impurity or sulfur vacancies in the bulk material or at the surface, or both, which generate electronic states within the band gap.18 Many efforts based on the synthesis,19–22 surface passivation23 and structural and photoelectronic characterization24–26 of pyrite films have been devoted to enhancing the photovoltaic performance and efficiency of pyrite cells. However, the results have not significantly improved the solar conversion efficiency. The preparation of phase-pure and high-efficiency FeS2 film is still a huge challenge. As the problem of low efficiency cannot be easily overcome with present technologies, conquering it from another direction, namely by designing the material morphology to enhance photoelectric conversion, may be one possibility. Furthermore, successful studies of nanostructures from other semiconductors such as Si,27–34 CdTe,35 and CdS/Cu2S36 suggest that one-dimensional nanostructures have various unique properties over planar geometries for solar applications.33,37
Sufficient light absorption is a prerequisite for any semiconductor material to be a candidate for photovoltaic applications. Although it is mainly determined by the band gap of the semiconductor, it can be significantly enhanced through other approaches. The most efficient way is to enlarge the surface area available for light harvest by structural design. Aligned one-dimensional nanostructure arrays would be the preferred choice, due to their unique structural features such as extremely large surface area as well as a high number of junction areas and direct pathways for charge transport, giving them superior optical absorption properties compared with nanoparticle thin films. For example, the photocurrent in ZnO nanowire array films has been shown to be 50–75% higher than that in ZnO nanoparticle films.38 The mobility of electrons in one-dimensional nanostructures, such as carbon nanotubes39 and Ge40 and Si41 nanowires, is typically several orders of magnitude higher than that in their respective nanoparticle films. If pyrite can be prepared as forest-like aligned arrays, this will remarkably increase the surface area available for receiving sunlight illumination and the sufficient absorption of photons, leading to enhanced photoelectric properties.
Until now, the preparation of well-aligned one-dimensional FeS2 arrays, specifically on a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) transparent and conductive glass substrate, has been simply an idea. Such a configuration, with the arrays grown on an FTO substrate, could be used directly as a photoanode in solar cells, allowing the complete transmission of sunlight. We report here the development of a new strategy for the design of a nanostructure architecture of pyrite. Vertically aligned FeS2 nanorods were successfully grown on an FTO substrate based on a template-directed synthesis using ZnO nanorod arrays (ZNAs) as the template and subsequent low-temperature sulfidation. The aligned FeS2 nanorods show much better photoelectric properties than the FeS2 nanoparticles.
2 Results
The phase evolution during synthesis was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). ZNAs with [1000] as the preferential direction were obtained and used as the initial template (Fig. 1a). After the ZnO template had been immersed in Fe3+ solution for 30 min, the crystallinity of the ZnO nanorods decreased (Fig. 1b). The crystallinity of the ZnO nanorods continuously decreased with increasing immersion time and the ZnO diffraction peaks almost disappeared completely at an immersion time of 1 h (Fig. 1c and d). No peak related to Fe(OH)3 appears in the XRD pattern, indicating that the Fe(OH)3 is amorphous; this is commonly observed in wet chemical reactions.42,43 After the immersion stage, the resulting Fe(OH)3 film was annealed with sublimed sulfur powder at 350 °C for 3 h. The XRD results confirm that the final product, FeS2, was obtained successfully (Fig. 1e).

The final FeS2 films were obtained via three main processes: hydrothermal growth of the ZnO template; immersion of the template in Fe3+ solution; and sulfurization of the solution-immersed films. The morphologies of the products obtained after each process were investigated by SEM. Uniform, dense and well-oriented ZNAs were successfully grown on the FTO substrate (Fig. 2). The ordered ZnO nanorods were uniform, with diameters ranging from 50 to 80 nm and with lengths up to 3 μm. According to the XRD results (Fig. 1) and previous work,44,45 the ZnO nanorods grow with their c-axis perpendicular to the substrate.
 Fig. 2  SEM images of the as-prepared ZNAs: (a) top view; and (b) cross-sectional view. 
The morphology of the product immersed in Fe3+ solution for 1 h is shown in Fig. 3. The original ordered array structure is well preserved. The single-crystalline ZnO nanorods are transformed into Fe(OH)3 nanorods made of multi-particles. Some Fe(OH)3 nanorods have a hollow structure, which indicates that the nanorods should be nanotubes with their tips closed. The outer diameters of the nanotubes range from 80 to 120 nm and the inner diameters range from 30 to 50 nm. The chemical composition of the Fe(OH)3 nanotube film was characterized by EDS. The EDS spectrum shows the presence of Fe, O and trace amounts of Zn, which means that the ZnO template is entirely acid-etched and almost completely replaced by Fe(OH)3. The signal of elemental C comes mainly from surface adsorption and contamination. The signal of Pt comes from the sputter coating of Pt during SEM sample preparation. The coating treatment aims to gain better conductivity and clear observation during SEM. The remaining elements, Si, Sn and Ca, are from the FTO glass substrate. The relative contents of Zn, Fe and O in the samples immersed in Fe3+ solution for different times were calculated and are shown in Fig. 3c. The relative content of Zn decreases quickly initially and then slowly, whereas the relative content of Fe increases quickly initially and then slowly. The increase in the relative content of O during the initial period is because the three oxygen atoms combine with an Fe atom in Fe(OH)3. It should be pointed out that some of the signal from O may come from the FTO substrate.

The morphology of the FeS2 arrays obtained by sulfurizing the Fe(OH)3 nanotube arrays is shown in Fig. 4. The FeS2 nanorods orientate normal to the FTO substrate and the original one-dimensional ordered arrays are still preserved. The diameter of the FeS2 nanorods ranges from 120 to 140 nm, with lengths from 500 to 800 nm. The aspect ratio of the FeS2 nanorods is reduced compared with that of the ZnO nanorods.

The microstructure of the FeS2 nanorod arrays was further investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 5). The rod morphology is still visible, although the sample was dispersed ultrasonically for 15 min (Fig. 5a). However, the rods seem loose compared with those in the SEM images (Fig. 4). The select area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns show several sharp rings, which are well correlated with the (200), (211), (220), (221) and (311) planes of pyrite (Fig. 5b). The corresponding dark-field image clearly shows that the rods consist of FeS2 crystals (Fig. 5c). The high crystallinity of FeS2 is further directly confirmed by the high-resolution TEM image (Fig. 5d). The regular arrangement of atoms is clearly observed and little lattice defect is found in the grain.

XPS was performed to investigate the surface components of the FeS2 nanorod films. From the survey scan (Fig. 6a), it is clearly seen that the sample consists mainly of Fe and S. The signals corresponding to O and C originate from surface adsorption and contamination. Fig. 6b shows the Fe 2p spectrum of the FeS2 nanorods. Two peaks located at 707.2 and 720.1 eV (ref. 46 and 47) are attributed to the Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 binding energies in pyrite, respectively. Fig. 6c presents the S 2p spectrum of the FeS2 nanorods. Two photoelectron signals observed at 162.6 and 163.7 eV,13,48 corresponding to S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2, respectively, are also consistent with the sulfur binding energy in pyrite (FeS2). It is suggested that there should be a trace amount of FeS because an additional small S peak at 161.4 eV (ref. 49) is detected. The reason why the FeS phase does not appear in the XRD pattern (Fig. 1) is probably due to the low content of FeS, which may be below the detection limit of XRD. According to the XPS analysis, the atomic ratio of Fe to S on the film surface is 1:1.7, which deviates from the theoretical ratio (Fe:S = 1:2). The preparation of pyrite (FeS2) with high-purity, single-phase and stoichiometric FeS2 arrays is still a challenge.

The Raman spectrum of the FeS2 nanorods is shown in Fig. 7. Two strong peaks located at 335 and 368 cm−1, as well as a weak vibration band at 422 cm−1, are clearly observed in Fig. 7a. These peaks are the characteristic active modes for pyrite corresponding to the stretching of S2 dumb-bells (Ag), the vibration of the S atom perpendicular to the dumb-bell axes (Eg), and coupled vibration and stretch (triply degenerate, specifically Tg(3)) modes,50 respectively. There are five Raman active modes (Ag + Eg + 3Tg) in total for pyrite (FeS2) due to its symmetrical structure of space group Pa3.51 The frequency of the Tg mode is very close to that of the Ag mode. Here, only one Tg mode was observed at 422 cm−1; the other two modes may be hidden in the Ag mode at 368 cm−1. Although FeS was detected in the earlier XPS characterizations, we were not able to distinguish FeS from FeS2 by Raman spectrometry due to their structural symmetry.51

Table 1 summarizes the specific Raman data of pyrite with different morphologies and characterization dimensions.17 An obvious red shift of the Raman peaks is found for pyrite as the crystal size reduces from micrometers to nanometers (Fig. 7b). The reason for the observed red shift may be related to the characterization dimension of the nanostructure. It is found that this red shift becomes more obvious as the dimension of the nanostructure becomes smaller. Interestingly, a more evident peak shift for the Ag mode compared with the Eg mode is observed, which reflects the weaker bond strength for S–S compared with Fe–S.

Pyrite is regarded as a promising material in solar cells, largely due to its favorable optical properties. Fig. 8 shows the optical absorption spectrum of the FeS2 nanorods. Both the absorption coefficient (α) and the optical band gap (Eg) are determined from transmittance and reflectance measurements using a UV-visible spectrophotometer. The FeS2 nanorods show a high absorption coefficient with α > 105 cm−1 in the visible range (Fig. 8a). A wide absorption peak in the range 500–800 nm is observed for the FeS2 nanorods, which suggests that they are candidate materials for photovoltaic devices. Moreover, in the high absorption energy regions, the absorption coefficients reach approximately stable values. The dependence of the absorption coefficient on the photon energy near the absorption edge suggests that the band gap is indirect, as expected from theoretical calculations.52 The optical band gap can be estimated by the conventional Tauc equation:53 αhv = A(hv − Eg)n(1)where hv is the photon energy, A is the constant, n = 2 for an indirectly allowed transition and n = 1/2 for a directly allowed transition. By fitting the absorption coefficient to the general formula for indirectly allowed transitions, the value of the band gap energy is obtained. Fig. 8b shows the graph of (αhv)1/2versus photon energy (hv) for FeS2 nanorods. When the linear dependence of (αhv)1/2 on hv is extrapolated to zero, it gives an optical band gap of 0.89 eV for FeS2 nanorods.

The photocurrent–potential (I–V) behavior of the FeS2 nanorod electrode was measured under irradiation with a xenon lamp at an intensity of 500 mW cm−2 in a three-electrode photoelectrolysis cell with 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution as the electrolyte, an FTO substrate with an FeS2 nanorod film as the working electrode, Pt foil as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode (Hg/Hg2Cl2/sat. KCl) as the reference electrode, separated by glass frits. Contact with the working electrode was with a Cu clip wire above the electrolyte. During the whole experimental process, the three-electrode cell was kept still and tests under light and dark conditions were achieved by controlling the on/off state of the xenon lamp. Fig. 9 shows the plot of photocurrent versus potential for the FTO substrate, FeS2 nanorods and FeS2 nanoparticles in the dark and with simulated sunlight. The current for the FTO substrate is not detected under either dark or light conditions between −1.0 and 1.0 V. The I–V curve under darkness almost entirely overlaps with that under illumination, which suggests that the bare FTO substrate has no photoelectric response. In the case of the natural pyrite electrode, it is difficult to observe a photocurrent.47 However, after the growth of pyrite (FeS2) nanorods on the FTO substrate, a significant photocurrent is observed and the current steadily increases as the potential increases from 0.4 to 1.0 V on both the positive and negative sides. It is reasonable that the anodic photocurrent generated increases with increasing applied potential, as FeS2 is a typical n-type semiconductor. Compared with the FeS2 nanorods, a much weaker photoresponse was observed for FeS2 nanoparticles with the same potential under dark and illuminated conditions. It is clear that the FeS2 nanorods have a prominent photocurrent that is much higher than that of FeS2 nanoparticles. Hence it can be concluded that one-dimensional nanostructures have an excellent performance and that they have promising potential in photovoltaic applications.54,55

The anode was irradiated using a xenon lamp at an intensity of 500 mW cm−2 in a three-electrode system in 0.5 M sodium sulfate solution. 
Stability is also an important concern for pyrite (FeS2) nanomaterials due to their susceptibility to oxidation and decomposition. The stability of pyrite (FeS2) is determined to some extent by the preparation methods. For solution-processable pyrite (FeS2) nanocrystals, the nanocrystal solution shows complete decomposition within a few weeks of storage in air,14 forming a yellow precipitate and clear supernatant. Surfactants such as TOPO,56 P3HT57 and PCBM58 are regularly applied to cap the nanocrystals in solution preparations to inhibit the rapid degradation of pyrite (FeS2) nanocrystals, which is accelerated by nano effects. Pyrite nanocrystal thin films without post-heat treatment are observed to change color within a few weeks in air and to show impurity peaks in the XRD pattern on exposure to air for 3 months.15 For pyrite (FeS2) films which have undergone sintering treatment, the polycrystalline pyrite films are stable for at least 1 month in air without discoloration or the appearance of new phases in the XRD patterns.14 The stability of the pyrite FeS2 nanorod films prepared by our template-directed method combined with subsequent sulfidation are stable for at least 1 year in a vacuum drier, with no discoloration and no apparent change in the XRD patterns (Fig. S3†). Stability in air and detailed analysis of the mechanism of decomposition still require further work.
3 Discussion
3.1 Growth of FeS2 nanorod arrays
The growth of the FeS2 nanorod arrays is illustrated in Scheme 1. A well-aligned ZNA template is first grown on a ZnO-coated FTO substrate via a hydrothermal method (Fig. 2). The ZNAs obtained are then used as an initial template and are immersed in Fe(NO3)3 aqueous solution. Fe3+ begins to hydrolyze and produces an Fe(OH)3 colloid and H+. The hydrolysis occurs preferentially around the ZnO nanorods, which also serve as a “patterned” substrate to support the Fe(OH)3 colloid. Simultaneously, the ZnO nanorods are etched by H+. This consumption of H+ accelerates the hydrolysis reaction of Fe3+, leading to enhanced hydrolysis in the vicinity of the ZnO nanorods. As a result, a precipitate of Fe(OH)3 emerges on the ZnO nanorod scaffold, forming an early rigid base of nanotubes. Progressive hydrolysis and template dissolution eventually result in well-oriented Fe(OH)3 nanotubes (Fig. 3). The two chemical reactions of hydrolysis and acid etching that occur in the immersion process are as follows:42 Fe3+ + 3H2O → Fe(OH)3 + 3H+(2) ZnO + 2H+ → Zn2+ + H2O(3)
 Scheme 1  Schematic diagram for the fabrication of FeS2 nanorod arrays. 
The prepared Fe(OH)3 nanotube arrays also serve as a template and react with sulfur powder in a sealed quartz ampoule. The sulfur atoms diffuse continuously into the Fe(OH)3 nanotube and react with Fe(OH)3. The detailed reaction is as follows: 4Fe(OH)3 + 11S → 4FeS2 + 6H2O + 3SO2(4)
In the template-directed synthesis, the ZnO template has two functions: first, it is a removable/sacrificial template for the formation of Fe(OH)3 nanotubes; and, secondly, the in situ dissolution exerts an acceleration effect on the precipitation of hydroxide. During the solution-immersion stage, the Fe(OH)3 colloids produced prefer to deposit on the outer wall of the ZnO nanorod and gradually form an Fe(OH)3 layer along the radial direction in an outward direction. The final Fe(OH)3 nanotube morphology can be obtained by removing the ZnO nanorod template, which is determined by the crystal structure of wurtzite (ZnO). Compared with the non-polar planes parallel to the c axis, two polar planes, the (0001) and (000) planes, have a higher surface energy and are metastable. In addition, it is proposed that more defects were formed in the inner part of the ZnO nanorod.59 Hence the etching will preferentially occur in the (0001) planes along the c axis by H+ derived from the hydrolysis of Fe3+ and the etching rate is much faster than that of the non-polar planes. As a result, the ZnO nanorods are completely removed and Fe(OH)3 nanotube arrays are obtained. In designing hollow structures, galvanic replacement, applied to the fabrication of metals60 and metallic oxides61 with hollow structures, has been regarded as a simple and versatile route to produce tunable morphologies and controllable compositions. By coupling our template-directed synthesis with galvanic replacement, it is possible, and promising, to obtain more complex and innovative structures, which will provide unique properties and enhanced performance in particular applications.
3.2 Photoelectric properties of FeS2 nanorod arrays
The major barrier to the structure and photoefficiency of nanoparticle films for application in solar cells is the convoluted internal interface and high degree of structural disorder. The most efficient strategy to solve these two problems is to introduce well-aligned one-dimensional nanostructures. Hence replacing the disordered nanoparticle architecture with ordered nanostructure arrays of optimum dimensions is a promising approach to boosting the carrier collection yield and power conversion efficiency of nanostructured solar cells.
The photoelectric properties of FeS2 films are, to a large extent, determined by the structure of the films, which has a great influence on the surface area available for light harvesting and electron transport. Scheme 2 illustrates the difference in light harvesting and electron transport for films with FeS2 one-dimensional nanostructures and nanoparticles. Compared with FeS2 nanoparticle films, one-dimensional FeS2 nanorod arrays have a larger surface area for the absorption of sunlight and therefore for the capture of sufficient incident photons. A hopping mechanism,62 which occurs between trap states on neighboring particles, has been proposed for photoelectron transport in nanoparticle films. An electron is estimated to cross 103 to 106 particles62 when traveling in the photoelectrode film and is usually trapped by isolated nanoparticles, surface states, or defect states. Although the FeS2 nanorods prepared in this study are also composed of many nanoparticles (see Fig. 4 and 5), the electron transport in the FeS2 nanorods is different from that of FeS2 nanoparticles. Owing to the unique one-dimensional structure, the electrons are confined in the one-dimensional nanorod channel and transport along the axial direction from the point of electron injection to the substrate of the collection electrode, which largely reduces the scattering and combination loss of electrons. This differs from the case of nanoparticle films in a solar cell configuration, where electrons, during their travels, take a random walk among the nanoparticles and undergo numerous collisions at grain boundaries. Hence one-dimensional nanorod array structures, as well as nanotubes, nanowires and nanobelts, offer significant opportunities to improve the efficiencies of solar cells by facilitating photo-absorption, electron transport and electron collection.

4 Conclusions
In summary, a novel facile strategy has been put forward for the fabrication of one-dimensional pyrite (FeS2) nanorod arrays. Large-area FeS2 nanorods with well-oriented alignments were produced on an FTO substrate using ZNAs as the template. The prepared FeS2 nanorod films showed outstanding light absorption and enhanced photocurrents compared with nanoparticle FeS2 films. The excellent optical and photoelectrical performance of FeS2 nanorod films is attributed to the unique one-dimensional ordered architecture, which has a large surface area for light harvesting, provides a direct and short pathway for charge transport and reduces the combination loss of photoelectrons. The method offers a new strategy for designing nanostructured materials with one-dimensional ordered architecture for high-performance photovoltaic devices.
5 Experimental section
Chemicals
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, AR), hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) (C6H12N4, AR), zinc acetate dehydrate (Zn(CHCOO)2·2H2O, AR), ethanolamine (MEA) (NH2CH2CH2OH, AR), 2-methoxyethanol (CH3OCH2CH2OH, AR), acetyl acetone (C5H8O2, AR), iron nitrate nonahydrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O) and sulfur were used as received without any treatment. FTO glass with dimensions of 50 × 15 × 2 mm was used as the substrate and was ultrasonically cleaned in acetone, ethanol and de-ionized water for 15 min each.
Synthesis of ZNAs
A seed solution with a concentration of 1 M was prepared by the sol–gel method. Zinc acetate dehydrate and MEA of equivalent molarity were dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol at ambient temperature. The mixture was magnetically stirred at 60 °C for 30 min to obtain a transparent and homogeneous solution. The substrates were dipped into the seed solution and pulled up at a rate of 200 mm min−1 and then the coated substrates were dried at 80 °C in an oven. This procedure was repeated three times. Finally, the substrates were heat-treated at 300 °C for 10 min and then heated to 550 °C at a rate of 2 °C min−1 for 1 h to obtain uniform and dense ZnO seed layers on the substrates.
A precursor solution for the growth of ZNAs was prepared by dissolving zinc nitrate hydrate (Zn(NO3)2·6H2O) with a concentration of 0.025 M and HMTA in de-ionized water. The molar ratio of Zn2+ to HMTA was 1:1. The precursor solution was then put into a 25 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and the seed-coated substrates were put face down in the solution. The autoclave was sealed and heated at 90 °C for 6 h. After the heat treatment, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature and the substrates were removed from solution, rinsed 2–3 times with de-ionized water and then dried in air.
Synthesis of FeS2 nanorod films
The as-synthesized ZNAs used as templates were first placed into an aqueous solution with Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (0.27 g per 50 mL) and kept still at room temperature for a certain time. After immersion, they were taken out and dried in air. The solution-immersed films and sublimed sulfur powder (an amount calculated to produce 80 kPa sulfur pressure at the annealing temperature) were sealed in quartz ampoules. The ampoules were filled with pure Ar and evacuated repeatedly five times before sealing. To produce the FeS2 nanorod films, the sealed samples were isothermally annealed at 350 °C for 3 h.
Characterization
Structural characterization of the film was determined by XRD (X'Pert PRO) using Cu Kα radiation. The morphologies of the samples were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi SU-70). TEM was carried out using a Philips CM200 instrument operated at 200 kV. The FeS2 nanorod thin film was scraped from the FTO and dispersed in ethanol with ultrasonic dispersion for 15 min. Several drops of the turbid liquid were then transferred onto the Cu grid for TEM. UV-visible optical absorption measurements were performed on a Hitachi U-4100 spectrophotometer. The ionic characteristics and surface composition were studied by XPS (Escalab 250Xi). A Renishaw inVia confocal Raman microscope with 532 nm laser excitation was used for the Raman measurements. The photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted in an electrochemical workstation (CHI-660D) with a xenon lamp at an intensity of 500 mW cm−2 in a three-electrode configuration photoelectrolysis cell. A 0.5 M Na2SO4 solution was used as the supporting electrolyte and the active area of the sample was 1.0 × 1.0 cm.
