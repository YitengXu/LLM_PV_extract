    , Accepted 16th June 2014First published on 17th June 2014AbstractCharge generation and recombination processes occurring in ternary photoactive copolymer:copolymer:fullerene blends consisting of different mixing ratios between entirely amorphous and semi-crystalline PPE-PPV copolymers are investigated by transient absorption pump–probe and pump–push photocurrent spectroscopy. The experiments reveal that an excess of semi-crystalline polymer facilitates exciton dissociation into free charge carriers, slows down geminate recombination, and suppresses non-geminate recombination leading to increased short-circuit currents and high fill factors. In contrast, blends utilizing solely the amorphous polymer for their donor phase suffer from a large fraction of sub-nanosecond geminate recombination of interfacially bound charge-transfer states and also from fast non-geminate recombination of free charges, resulting in a significantly reduced photovoltaic performance. However, small fractions of the amorphous polymer blended into the semi-crystalline polymer increase the open-circuit voltage and the fill factor, while keeping the charge generation and recombination parameters largely unaltered in turn leading to an optimized device performance for the ternary PPE-PPV copolymer:copolymer:fullerene blends.
1. Introduction
The morphology of the photoactive layer of any bulk heterojunction polymer:fullerene solar cell is crucial for the photovoltaic device performance.1–5 Morphology control and optimization is required on different length-scales, starting from interfacial organization of donors and acceptors on the sub-nanometer scale, determining the initial step of the electron transfer process,6–11 increasing to 2–20 nanometers at which phase separation controls the size of individual blend component domains relevant for exciton diffusion and charge relaxation,12,13 up to several hundred nanometers, the length scale governing charge carrier percolation/transport and extraction.14
In the case of the heavily-researched donor polymer regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene), rr-P3HT, blended with fullerenes, structural ordering, namely crystallization of the polymer, is vital for the photovoltaic performance.15–17 Well-ordered regions of both donors and acceptors are known to yield superior percolation and thus charge transport properties.18,19 Several methods for pre-aggregating P3HT in solution20–22 prior to spin-casting as well as post-processing annealing methods, such as thermal annealing,15,23 mechanical rubbing24 or slow drying,25 were developed to induce and improve crystallinity and therefore device performance. Interestingly, the best device performance was obtained from samples that contained both ordered polymer fibers and less-ordered P3HT domains.21,22 This can be understood in terms of an enhanced driving force of long-range charge separation created by the mixed system containing both amorphous and disordered as well as crystalline and ordered regions of donors and/or acceptors as recently shown by Durrant and coworkers26,27 and by Heeger and coworkers.13 Therefore, it appears that the ideal blend should not only contain disordered regions to facilitate exciton dissociation but also ordered regions to promote charge transport.28,29 It was also demonstrated that polymer crystallization is beneficial for charge generation.30
One possible route to create both amorphous and crystalline regions in a more controlled manner than empirically changing the processing conditions and applying post-deposition annealing is the blending of three components, i.e. two (co)polymers of different (semi)-crystallinity mixed with PCBM as an acceptor. This has been done, for instance, in the case of P3HT, i.e. for a mixture of regioregular and regiorandom P3HT with PCBM.31 Khlyabich et al. demonstrated that a ternary blend of two different P3HT analogues mixed with PCBM achieved a considerable performance enhancement.32
In the following we investigate ternary blends with varying mixing ratios of amorphous and semi-crystalline anthracene-containing poly(p-phenylene-ethynylene)-alt-poly-(p-phenylene-vinylene) (PPE-PPV) copolymers (AnE-PVs) mixed with PCBM as an acceptor. The structures of the two copolymers are depicted in Scheme 1.
 Scheme 1  Chemical structures of the investigated copolymers, namely AnE-PVab and AnE-PVba. Note the different side chain substitution patterns of the two copolymers. 
The backbones of both donor copolymers are the same, however, they differ in their side chain substitution patterns, which facilitates semi-crystallinity (AnE-PVab) in one case, and leads to a completely amorphous (AnE-PVba) material in the other case.33 Different blending ratios of semi-crystalline to amorphous polymers were investigated as reported in a preceding publication34 to understand the relation between morphology, structural properties, steady-state photophysical processes and solar cell performance. Indeed, for largely unknown reasons the optimum performance was found for small (10%) contents of the amorphous polymer,34 requiring a closer look at the photophysical properties by transient optical spectroscopy. Here, the results of five different samples are presented, containing 0, 10, 50, 90, and 100% of amorphous AnE-PVba as a second blend component, respectively.

Table 1 summarizes the composition of the samples and their solar cell performance. Fluctuations occurred in all photovoltaic parameters but in general a better performance was found for the more semi-crystalline samples. In fact, the completely amorphous sample (100% ba) showed the lowest performance and values for all figures of merit. The largest short-circuit currents and fill factors were obtained for the samples containing 0% and 10% of the amorphous polymer. The open-circuit voltage (VOC) increased progressively with increasing concentration of the amorphous polymer until a maximum was reached for the sample containing 50%, while at larger concentrations VOC decreased again. The power conversion efficiency dropped from 4% for the blend containing 10% of the amorphous polymer to 0.4% for the sample consisting solely of the amorphous polymer. Regarding the photoactive layer morphology it is important to note that the amorphous sample exhibited very small scale component demixing, while the domain sizes were considerably larger in the mainly semi-crystalline samples, as observed by atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray diffraction (GIWAXS).34 Here, we report the charge generation and recombination properties and elucidate the impact of semi-crystalline and amorphous polymer regions on the free charge carrier generation efficiency. We demonstrate that while polymer exciton quenching is efficient in all five samples, the more amorphous samples, with 90% and 100% of AnE-PVba, exhibit both a larger fraction and faster geminate recombination and significantly increased non-geminate recombination, leading to a deteriorated device performance.

2. Experimental results
2.1 Sub-nanosecond exciton quenching and charge generation
In order to compare the exciton quenching efficiency and sub-nanosecond charge generation and recombination of the different samples, transient absorption experiments covering the pico- to nanosecond timescale (1 ps to 3 ns) were carried out. The samples were excited at an excitation wavelength of 400 nm, i.e. in a wavelength region where the absorbance of all samples was similar. We note that in this spectral region both polymer and PCBM absorb and contribute to the photocurrent generation. This can lead to a diffusion-limited charge generation process, if PCBM excitons have to diffuse to the interface to undergo dissociation. However, the dynamics of the charge-transfer (CT) states formed upon exciton dissociation are independent of the excitation of either the donor or the acceptor as was recently shown for several polymer:fullerene blends.35

Fig. 1 compares the pico- to nanosecond TA spectra of all five samples. All spectra show positive TA signals at short wavelengths, corresponding to the ground state bleach (GSB) of the polymer coinciding with the steady-state absorption spectrum, followed by photo-induced absorption at longer wavelengths extending into the NIR spectral region. The GSB of the samples with mainly semi-crystalline polymer content exhibits vibronic features, while the mainly amorphous samples show a broad and entirely featureless GSB. The GSB of the samples containing ≥50% of the amorphous polymer experiences a significant red-shift with delay time. The red-shift is most evident for the sample consisting solely of the amorphous polymer AnE-PVba blended with PCBM. Here, the GSB maximum red-shifts from 530 nm to 560 nm in the first 3 ns. We note that the relaxation is more pronounced in the samples containing ≥50% of the amorphous polymer implying that the change in energy of excited states at early times appears to increase with increasing amorphous content. At longer wavelengths the TA spectra of all samples are dominated by a broad photo-induced absorption (PIA) of excited states such as excitons, free charges (SSA) and charge-transfer states. However, it appears that the TA signal in the PIA region of the samples containing a fraction of 0 and 10% of the amorphous polymer, respectively, is a superposition of the PIA and a broad but distinct feature due to stimulated emission (SE) peaking at around 680 nm, which coincides with the steady-state fluorescence maximum of the pristine polymer film. As the ESA is strong also in the region in which SE can be expected, a net negative TA signal is observed. This SE feature is also apparent in the sample with 50% of each copolymer, but it is entirely absent in the samples containing larger fractions of the amorphous polymer. The stimulated emission decays entirely within about 10 ps in all samples. Hence, we conclude that exciton quenching in all blends is efficient and close to unity, as the SE of excitons is quenched in less than 1 ps for the amorphous samples and in less than 10 ps for the more crystalline samples. The observation of stimulated emission in the case of the highest semi-crystalline polymer (AnE-PVab) concentrations (0% and 10% ba) is in excellent agreement with the morphology indicated by AFM and GIWAXS measurements.34 For dominantly semi-crystalline polymer containing samples the domains are generally larger, which requires exciton diffusion over larger distances to the interface with the acceptor where quenching by electron transfer takes place. Increasing concentrations of the amorphous polymer decrease the presence of larger and polymer-rich domains and thus result in more molecularly-mixed blends. Therefore, exciton quenching takes place on the sub-picosecond timescale for dominantly amorphous donor materials, as the majority of excitons are photo-generated close to an interface with PCBM.
 Fig. 1  Picosecond to nanosecond transient absorption spectra of all 5 polymer:polymer:fullerene blends with increasing content of the amorphous polymer (% ba) after excitation at 400 nm. The black line corresponds to the averaged spectra between 1–1.5 ps, the red line at 10–15 ps and the blue line at 1–1.5 ns. The data around 800 nm are omitted as they are overlaid by the second order reflection of the excitation pulse. Note that the signal remains largely constant for 0% and 20% AnE-PVba content, while it decays significantly for AnE-PVba concentrations over 50%. Excitation at 4.4 μJ cm−2 (0% and 10%), 12 μJ cm−2 (50% and 100%) and 14 μJ cm−2 (90%). 
2.2 Sub-nanosecond geminate charge pair recombination
The ground-state bleach and the broad photo-induced absorption show very little signal loss over the entire time-range up to 3 ns in samples with high fractions of semi-crystalline copolymers indicating that the excited-state population stays largely constant on this timescale. This is in contrast to the more amorphous samples, which exhibit a considerable loss of both ground-state bleach and photo-induced absorption signals.

Fig. 2a shows the comparison of the decay dynamics of the PIA signals integrated between 875 and 925 nm and measured at similar excitation intensities for all five samples. The data are normalized to 10 ps when exciton quenching is expected to be complete. The residual signal after 2 ns clearly differs for all samples. In the case of the samples with mainly semi-crystalline copolymer content about 90% of the initial PIA signal remains, in the sample with 50% of each copolymer the signal decays to about 70%, and in the mainly amorphous samples the PIA signal is reduced much more significantly to about 50% and 30% after 2 ns for 90% ba and 100% ba, respectively.
 Fig. 2  Panel (a) shows the dynamics of the PIA signal (875–925 nm) of all five samples in the first 2 ns after excitation at 400 nm. The fluence was chosen in a way to ensure similar ΔT/T (and therefore excited state density) of around 2.5 × 10−3. The initial signal was chosen to be low enough to avoid nongeminate recombination during the first two nanoseconds, and exciton-charge annihilation at early time for the 0% sample. Fluences were 4.4 μJ cm−2 (0% and 10%), 7.6 μJ cm−2 (50%), 9.3 μJ cm−2 (90%), 11.9 μJ cm−2 (100%). Panel (b) shows the signal decay at multiple fluences in the region of the ground-state bleach (540–560 nm, red lines) and two regions in the PIA (green and blue lines) for 100% AnE-PVba. As a guide to the eye a black line shows a monoexponential decay with a time-constant of 2.1 ns. The excitation fluences were 2, 7 and 19 μJ cm−2. This illustrates the significant geminate recombination in this sample. 

Fig. 2b shows the intensity dependence of the loss of the ground-state bleach and PIA of sample 5. The signal decay is significant, but not excitation intensity dependent. This points to a geminate recombination process reducing the total number of charge carriers on the nanosecond timescale. It appears that while excitons are efficiently quenched at the interface, a significant fraction of the excitons creates coulombically-bound geminate charge pairs (GCPs) rather than splitting into free and mobile charges. The GCP states then recombine geminately on a nanosecond timescale. Visual comparison with a single exponential decay indicates a lifetime of the GCP states of approximately 2 ns. This decay rate is very similar to decay rates observed in regiorandom or as-cast regioregular P3HT:PCBM blends,36,37 and PCDTBT:PCBM blends,38 indicating that GCP state recombination on the nanosecond timescale is a rather ubiquitous phenomenon in polymer:fullerene blends.
The GCP dynamics investigated above contain both the dynamics of interfacial charge-transfer (CT) states as well as recombination dynamics of separated electrons and holes which due to an unfavorable morphology do not escape entirely from the polymer–fullerene interface and eventually experience geminate recombination. To investigate the effect of polymer nano-morphology on the dynamics of the interfacial CT states only, we performed pump–push photocurrent (PPP) experiments on photovoltaic devices under working conditions.10

Fig. 3a compares the kinetics of CT state recombination and Fig. 3b shows the relative amount of such states in the device. It can be clearly seen that the lifetime of the CT states (summarized in Table 2) shortens dramatically with the decrease of polymer crystallinity – from >2 ns for 100% semi-crystalline AnE-PVab to ∼300 ps for 100% amorphous AnE-PVba.

This can be explained by the weaker electron–hole coupling in the samples containing the crystalline donor phase, as polymer crystallization likely enhances the delocalization of the hole. The observed trend is similar to the TA measurements. However, the recombination times deduced from the PPP experiments are always shorter. This indicates that the two techniques probe slightly different sub-ensembles of charges, with TA being sensitive to a wider range of weakly and strongly bound geminate charge pairs. Interestingly, the relative amount of initially generated interfacial CT states (Fig. 3b) seems to increase with enlargement of the amorphous donor concentration. This indicates that the aggregated polymer provides a channel for the hole to escape from the interface, while in the amorphous material this channel appears to be inactive. However, we note that changing the copolymer ratio most certainly also has an additional impact on the aggregation of the acceptor, as fullerene molecules likely get expelled from aggregated and polymer-rich regions thereby forming larger clusters. This in turn can further aid the charge separation process at the interface.
Even though the early time charge carrier loss, originating from the recombination of GCP states, can explain a large part of the quantum efficiency loss observed in devices, we expect further charge carrier recombination at later, namely ns–μs times, as the measured quantum efficiency of the devices is still lower than the total signal loss on the early timescale accounted for. The additional loss processes on the ns–μs timescale will be described in the next section.
2.3 Charge recombination on the ns–μs timescale
Transient absorption experiments on the ns–μs timescale were carried out in addition to the above-mentioned ps–ns experiments.

Fig. 4a shows a comparison of the transient absorption spectra of all samples obtained at various delay times after excitation at 532 nm. In good agreement with the ps–ns experiments all TA spectra exhibit a ground-state bleach in the wavelength region up to 620 nm, and a broad photo-induced absorption extending further into the near infrared. Comparing the signal intensity at 1–2 ns to that at 10–20 ns reveals a huge loss evident for all samples. Surprisingly this loss is even more pronounced for the more crystalline samples containing 0–50% ba, which show better solar cell performance. The spectral signature of the bleach and PIA also varies between the samples indicating that the amorphous content has an impact on the nature of the ground and excited-state transitions and on the way they are affected by the presence of excited states such as charges. In the following we analyze the dynamics of the photo-induced absorption more quantitatively by fitting the intensity dependent recombination to our previously reported two-pool model,36 where the kinetics of two independent pools of charge-transfer states and free charges formed on the sub-100 fs time scale are given by dCCT/dt = −kCCT and dCFC/dt = −γCFCλ+1, where CCT and CFC are the concentrations of charge-transfer states and free charges, k is the lifetime of the charge-transfer states, γ is the bimolecular recombination coefficient, and λ + 1 is the order of the recombination.

All samples exhibit a significant signal loss in the first 20 ns. (b) Normalized decay dynamics (ns–μs time-range) of the charge-induced absorption between 700 and 900 nm for pump fluences ranging from 4.5 to 80 μJ cm−2. The experimental data are shown as coloured dots. At higher fluences the decay is faster due to accelerated non-geminate recombination of free charge carriers. The solid lines represent fits to our analytical model of charge recombination as described in the text. 

Fig. 4b shows an overview of the dynamics of the photo-induced absorption integrated between 700 and 900 nm for all five samples at various excitation intensities ranging from 4.5 to 80 μJ cm−2. Clearly, all samples exhibit intensity-dependent recombination dynamics indicating non-geminate recombination is the main charge carrier loss channel on the nanosecond to microsecond timescale. The solid black lines represent fits to the above-mentioned model of concomitant recombination of coulombically-bound charge pairs and spatially-separated (free) charge carriers. The applicability of this model has previously been shown for various other polymer:fullerene systems, for instance P3HT:PCBM,36 PCDTBT:PCBM38 and PCPDTBT:PCBM blends.39 Briefly, the model assumes that after 1 ns, i.e. at the earliest times observed in the ns–μs TA experiment, the charge carrier population consists of two pools: geminate charge pairs (GCP) and free (mobile) charge carriers. The former recombine exclusively via geminate recombination to the ground state (GS) as there is no additional driving force for their separation, while the spatially-separated (free) charge carriers recombine non-geminately. In the model interconversion between the two pools, specifically the dissociation of GCPs into free charges, is excluded deliberately, since after 1 ns the initial (primary) photo-generated excitons have either fully separated into free charges or collapsed into GCPs that cannot dissociate anymore under the measurement conditions applied in the TA experiment. We note, however, that we do not exclude the formation of electron–hole encounter complexes during the non-geminate recombination of free charges and emphasize that we have very recently demonstrated their relevance in PCDTBT:PCBM blends.40 The analytical model parameterizes the experimental recombination data and allows us to extract values for (i) the branching ratio of geminate versus non-geminate recombination f (which is equal to the branching ratio between the geminate charge pair state and the free charge carrier), (ii) the geminate recombination rate constant kCT→GS, (iii) the non-geminate recombination coefficient γ, and (iv) the order of the non-geminate recombination process λ + 1. A further limitation of the model is that we have to assume that geminate charge pair states and free charge carriers have equal absorption cross-sections in the wavelength region used to monitor the dynamics. However, this assumption is applicable in the present case, as the spectral shape did not change during the entire ns–μs measurement.
The recombination dynamics were globally fit across the TA experiments for all five samples. Except for the initial excitation density, all parameters were shared among the different intensities for each sample. As we can see in Fig. 4b the experimental data are well described by the fit.

Table 3 presents the fitting parameters along with their standard deviations as extracted from the global fit to the experimental data. For a better comparison, the effective (bimolecular) Langevin recombination coefficient, i.e. γ for which λ + 1 = 2 at a charge carrier density roughly corresponding to an illumination density of one sun (n = 5 × 1015 cm−3) was calculated. Solving γeff × n2 = γfit × nλ+1 for γeff we obtain γeff = γfit × nλ−1 and with this equation we extract the effective solar cell recombination coefficients, which are also listed in Table 3.

For the quality of the fits see Fig. 4b. The parameters were shared for all excitation intensities of each sample. f is the fraction of non-geminate recombination, γ is the non-geminate decay constant, λ + 1 is the order of the non-geminate recombination, k is the geminate recombination rate, and γeff is the effective (λ + 1 = 2) bimolecular recombination constant at a charge density of 5 × 1015 cm−3

3. Discussion and implications for device performance
We begin the discussion with the least efficient sample, which contains only the amorphous AnE-PVba copolymer as a donor material mixed with PCBM. The fraction f of non-geminate recombination is highest for this sample with a value of approximately two thirds. This is a direct consequence of the fast (sub-)nanosecond CT state decay leading to the situation that most of the interfacial CT states have already decayed within the instrument response time of our ns–μs TA setup and are thus not observed on this timescale anymore. Moreover, in solar cell devices using only the amorphous polymer, non-geminate recombination is expected to further reduce the photocurrent, in addition to the significant fraction of geminate recombination, as a comparably large value of 2 × 10−11 cm3 s−1 for the effective Langevin recombination coefficient is observed. This is in line with the low fill factor (only about 0.3) found for devices using the amorphous polymer (as it is unlikely that CT states recombining on the sub-nanosecond timescale can be split by the weak internal electric field of the solar cell, the low fill factor can probably not be explained by a bias dependence of free charge generation). Hence, the field dependence of the photocurrent can be explained by the competition between extraction of free charge carriers and their non-geminate recombination.
In the case of the samples containing a higher amount of the semi-crystalline polymer, we observe that the fraction of geminate recombination, extracted from fitting the experimental data to the two-pool model, is increased. However, virtually no GSB and PIA signal decay on the sub-nanosecond timescale was observed in the TA experiments. Therefore, we conclude that both interfacial CT states and geminate charge pairs are longer-lived than in the more amorphous samples. This is also confirmed by a smaller rate of geminate recombination, with k = 1.7 × 108 s−1, which equals an inverse rate or lifetime of 6 ns. The effective Langevin recombination coefficient is about two orders of magnitude smaller than in the amorphous samples, approximately 1 × 10−13 cm3 s−1. This indicates an effective suppression of non-geminate recombination of free charge carriers which in turn shifts the competition between recombination and extraction in favor of the latter in an operating solar cell device. This is also in line with the large fill factors (around 0.7) observed for these devices, indicating that the free carriers are swept out efficiently even at rather weak internal fields in a device.
The nongeminate recombination coefficients (effective Langevin coefficients) determined for the semi-crystalline and amorphous samples compare well with values previously determined for as-cast (and thus amorphous) and annealed (and thus semi-crystalline) P3HT:PCBM films.36 For the annealed P3HT:PCBM sample γeff was determined to be 2.2 × 10−13 cm3 s−1, which is one order of magnitude smaller than γeff = 1.5 × 10−12 cm3 s−1 determined for as-cast P3HT:PCBM.
The smaller effective Langevin recombination coefficients of the semi-crystalline samples could be explained by the additional thermodynamic driving force created between the amorphous and crystalline polymer domains. The higher HOMO energy of the latter aids the separation of charge carriers at the interface and facilitates their transport from the interface towards the more crystalline bulk polymer as previously discussed for other polymer:fullerene blends.29 In the more amorphous samples the larger disorder reduces the energetic difference between the interface and the bulk or even cancels it. Therefore charge carriers can approach the interface more easily thereby also recombining faster.
The analysis of the ns–μs recombination dynamics indicates that a larger fraction of free charge carriers is left in the samples with a higher content of amorphous polymer, however, their extraction appears to be severely limited by the large Langevin recombination coefficient, i.e. the comparably fast non-geminate recombination is strongly competing with extraction. In the samples consisting of mainly semi-crystalline polymer, geminate charge pairs decay on a timescale of 3–10 ns, resulting in a greater overall signal loss as compared to the amorphous samples on the same intermediate timescale. However, free charge carriers can be extracted more efficiently due to the smaller Langevin recombination coefficient, i.e. the slower non-geminate recombination.
The experiments demonstrate that geminate recombination is a highly relevant charge carrier loss mechanism on the sub-nanosecond and nanosecond timescales depending on the blend's composition. One can further estimate the total geminate charge carrier loss by adding the losses occurring on both timescales and then compare the total fraction of geminate recombination to the quantum efficiencies of the different samples. As a rough estimate, we determine the charge carrier loss on the sub-1 ns timescale from the height of the ΔT/T signal remaining after 1 ns in the short delay measurement (see Fig. 2a). The geminate charge pairs that recombine on the sub-nanosecond timescale are strongly-bound and thus do not contribute to the extracted photocurrent in an organic solar cell device. The obtained value accounts for the total amount of charge carriers (both bound and free) left after 1 ns. This value is then multiplied with f, the fraction of non-geminate recombination that was extracted by fitting the ns–μs dynamics to the two-pool model, to get the total fraction of free charge carriers. The obtained number is a measure of the amount of excitons separating into free charge carriers that can potentially be extracted, that is, it is a measure of the internal quantum efficiency excluding non-geminate recombination processes on the ns–μs timescale.

Table 4 summarizes the obtained values and compares them with the maximum EQE value for all samples, which was measured under bias illumination with an intensity corresponding to one sun. To illustrate the comparison, the values are also shown graphically in Fig. 5.
Table 4 Comparison of the ratio of free charge carrier formation and the maximum external quantum efficiency. The ΔT/T value after 1 ns is extracted from the PIA kinetics of the short delay measurement shown in Fig. 2a. This value accounts for the geminate recombination of geminate charge pairs on the sub-nanosecond timescale, which is not resolved in the ns–μs TA measurement due to the limited instrument response. The fraction of free charge carriers on the long timescale (f) is obtained from the fit described in the preceding section. Both values are multiplied to obtain the total amount of free charge carriers and compared to the maximum EQE values (see ref. 34)

 Fig. 5  The ratio of free charge carriers is calculated from the combined PIA kinetics of the short and long delay measurements and shown on the left-hand axis (in black). The maximum EQE of the samples (measured with background illumination of 1 sun) is shown on the right-hand axis (in red). Note that the values are very similar, indicating that geminate charge pair recombination is the dominant loss mechanism. For AnE-PVba concentrations of 90% and 100% non-geminate recombination of free charge carriers adds an additional loss channel at solar illumination intensities. 
The EQE values clearly follow qualitatively the fraction of free charge carrier formation in all samples. We therefore conclude that geminate charge pair recombination is the main and dominant quantum efficiency loss mechanism in these samples. The amount of geminate charge pair recombination depends on the blending ratio of the two polymers and clearly increases with increasing fraction of the amorphous polymer. However, the estimated fraction of free charge carriers is distinctly higher than the EQE values in the case of samples containing the highest fractions of the amorphous polymer (90% and 100% ba) and is accompanied by a significantly lower fill factor of these devices. Hence, we conclude that in these samples non-geminate recombination of free charge carriers adds an additional loss channel further reducing the quantum efficiency at solar illumination intensities. This is a likely explanation due to the comparably larger effective Langevin recombination coefficients for higher concentrations of the amorphous polymer as already discussed above, which shift the competition between non-geminate recombination and extraction in favor of the former.
4. Conclusions
The efficiency of the investigated AnE-PV copolymer:copolymer:fullerene ternary blends is largely determined by their photoactive layer morphology. Blends containing mainly the amorphous polymer exhibit ultrafast exciton dissociation, but also a large fraction of sub-nanosecond geminate recombination of interfacial charge-transfer states and bound geminate charge pairs, as charges are not fully separated. This suggests that high amorphous content in organic solar cells does not in general lead to the energy cascade morphologies favorable for charge separation.41 Furthermore, fast non-geminate recombination of free carriers is observed as demonstrated by our transient absorption experiments, which competes with charge carrier extraction in a solar cell. Both effects reduce the power conversion efficiency due to a decreased short-circuit current and fill factor. In samples that contain larger amounts of semi-crystalline polymer we observe diffusion-limited polymer exciton dissociation due to large polymer-rich domains and an increased fraction of free charge generation plus significantly reduced non-geminate recombination in turn leading to a higher power conversion efficiency when compared to the more amorphous blends. The results demonstrate that polymer crystallinity is an important parameter that determines the device performance. Intriguingly, best device efficiencies are obtained if small amounts of amorphous polymer are blended into the semi-crystalline polymer, which increases the open-circuit voltage while keeping the charge generation and recombination parameters similar to those obtained for a purely semi-crystalline polymer:fullerene blend.
5. Experimental section
Transient absorption spectroscopy
Transient absorption (TA) measurements were performed using a home-built pump–probe setup. To measure in the time range of 1 ps to 4 ns with a resolution of ∼100 fs, the output of a commercial titanium:sapphire amplifier (Coherent LIBRA HE, 3.5 mJ, 1 kHz, 100 fs) was split into two beams. One beam was used to pump an optical parametric amplifier (Coherent OPerA Solo) to generate a 1300 nm seed pulse for white-light generation with a sapphire window in the visible. The other beam was frequency doubled and used as an excitation pulse (400 nm). The variable delay of up to 4 ns between the pump and the probe was introduced using a broadband retroreflector mounted on a mechanical delay stage. Only reflective elements were used to guide the probe beam to the sample to minimize chirp. The excitation pulse was chopped at 500 Hz, while the white light pulses were dispersed onto a linear photodiode array which was read out at 1 kHz. Adjacent diode readings corresponding to the transmission of the sample after an excitation pulse and without an excitation pulse were used to calculate ΔT/T. For measuring in the time range of 1 ns to 1 μs with a resolution of 600 ps, the excitation pulse was provided using an actively Q-switched Nd:YVO4 laser (AOT Ltd MOPA) at 532 nm. The delay between the pump and the probe in this case was controlled using an electronic delay generator (Stanford Research Systems DG535). TA measurements were performed at room temperature under dynamic vacuum at pressures lower than 10−5 mbar. For sample preparation thin films of the binary and ternary blends were spin cast on quartz glass slides.
Pump–push photocurrent spectroscopy
A regenerative 1 kHz Ti:Sapphire amplifier system (Coherent, Legend Elite Duo) was used to pump a broadband non-collinear optical amplifier (Clark) and a 3-stage home-built optical parametric amplifier (OPA) to generate visible pump pulses (∼540 nm central wavelength, ±20 nm bandwidth) and infrared push pulses (2000 ± 100 nm), respectively. ∼1 nJ pump and ∼1 μJ push pulses were focused onto a ∼1 mm2 spot on the device. The reference photocurrent from a photodiode was detected at a pump repetition frequency of 1 kHz using a lock-in amplifier. The push beam was mechanically chopped at ∼370 Hz, and its effect on the photocurrent was also detected using a lock-in amplifier.

The black line corresponds to the averaged spectra between 1–1.5 ps, the red line at 10–15 ps and the blue line at 1–1.5 ns. The data around 800 nm are omitted as they are overlaid by the second order reflection of the excitation pulse. Note that the signal remains largely constant for 0% and 20% AnE-PVba content, while it decays significantly for AnE-PVba concentrations over 50%. Excitation at 4.4 μJ cm−2 (0% and 10%), 12 μJ cm−2 (50% and 100%) and 14 μJ cm−2 (90%).	 

 	Fig. 2  Panel (a) shows the dynamics of the PIA signal (875–925 nm) of all five samples in the first 2 ns after excitation at 400 nm. The fluence was chosen in a way to ensure similar ΔT/T (and therefore excited state density) of around 2.5 × 10−3. The initial signal was chosen to be low enough to avoid nongeminate recombination during the first two nanoseconds, and exciton-charge annihilation at early time for the 0% sample. Fluences were 4.4 μJ cm−2 (0% and 10%), 7.6 μJ cm−2 (50%), 9.3 μJ cm−2 (90%), 11.9 μJ cm−2 (100%). Panel (b) shows the signal decay at multiple fluences in the region of the ground-state bleach (540–560 nm, red lines) and two regions in the PIA (green and blue lines) for 100% AnE-PVba. As a guide to the eye a black line shows a monoexponential decay with a time-constant of 2.1 ns. The excitation fluences were 2, 7 and 19 μJ cm−2. This illustrates the significant geminate recombination in this sample.
