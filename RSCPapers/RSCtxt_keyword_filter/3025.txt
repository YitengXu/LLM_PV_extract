    , Accepted 19th April 2013First published on 19th April 2013AbstractNano-scaled tungsten oxides and carbides are synthesized using a simple one-step chemical method. They are subsequently introduced into dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) as counter electrode (CE) catalysts to replace the expensive Pt. The catalytic mechanism is investigated by measurements of cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel-polarization curve for the as-prepared catalysts. The DSCs using WC/W2C, W2C and WO2 as CE catalysts yield high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 6.23%, 6.68%, and 6.88%, respectively, comparable to that of the DSC using Pt CE. The results demonstrate that tungsten oxides and carbides are the potential alternative to the expensive Pt CE for reducing the cost of DSCs.
1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have attracted widespread attention in academic research and commercial applications owing to the following advantages: simple fabrication procedure, good plasticity and transparency, making them credible alternatives to conventional photovoltaic devices.1,2 In general, a DSC possesses three primary components: a dye sensitized oxide semiconductor (usually TiO2), an electrolyte containing a redox couple (triiodide/iodide) and a counter electrode (CE). As a crucial component, the CE is generally a conductive fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass deposited with Pt as catalyst, where the triiodide is reduced to iodide by the electrons flowing through the external circuit. However, the high price and limited reserves of Pt restrict the mass production of DSCs. To resolve this issue, several low cost materials have been proposed to replace Pt, such as carbon materials,3,4 conductive polymers5,6 and composite materials.7,8 Recently, CoS,9,10 TiN,11 TiN/carbon nanotube,12 V2O5,13 and NiN14 were applied in DSCs system as CE catalysts, resulting in decent results. Therefore, it is prospective to develop economical new inorganic catalysts for triiodide reduction in DSCs system.
As versatile materials, early transition metal carbides (TMCs) and nitrides (TMNs) combine the merits from the extreme hardness of covalent solid, the high melting temperature of ionic crystals and the electric and thermal conductivity of transition metals to the superior electrochemical catalytic activity of noble metal.15 In 1973, the “platinum-like behavior of tungsten carbide (WC) in surface catalysis” had been reported.16 And the mechanism of the Pt-like catalytic behavior for WC was reported subsequently.17–19 Since then, other early TMCs and TMNs have been applied in space communication,20 hydrodesulfurization of dibenzothiophene,21 hydrogen oxidation in fuel cells,22 alkene metathesis,23 and methanol oxidation,24 due to the Pt-like electrochemical catalytic activities. In our previous research, bulky tungsten carbides were successfully introduced to DSCs system as CE catalyst which showed good electrochemical catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the DSCs based WC CE reached 67.8% of the PCE of the DSC based on Pt CE. The relatively lower PCE can be attributed to the large size of the WC particles.25 Recently, transition metal oxides (TMOs) were introduced into DSCs as CE catalysts.26 In general, electrochemical catalytic activity can be improved by increasing the specific surface area which means the catalysts must be prepared with nano-scaled dimension. Commonly, TMCs TMNs and TMOs without dimensional requirement can be simply prepared through magnetron sputtering deposition, pulsed-laser deposition, and hydrothermal method.27–29 However, the preparation of TMCs nanostructures via chemical method is rife with formidable challenges rising from particle aggregation and impurities.
In this work, nano-scaled tungsten carbides (W2C, WC) and oxides (WO3, WO2) were simply synthesized using one pot chemical method. Specifically, WCl6 were used as metal chloride, ethanol was used as an oxygen source, and urea was used as carbon source by changing the urea/metal chloride molar ratio. All of the as-prepared carbides and oxides showed great electrochemical catalytic activity for reducing triiodide to iodide. And the DSCs based on nano-scaled tungsten carbides yielded a PCE of 6.68% (W2C) and 6.23% (WC/W2C), which reached 87.3% and 81.4% of that of the DSC based on Pt CE. What deserves special mention here is that the DSC using the unexpected product (WO2) as CE yields the highest PCE of 6.88% which can match the performance of the DSC using Pt CE and this is good agreement with our previous work.30 We believe that exploring the early transition metal carbides and oxides for the alternatives to the expensive Pt paves a promising way to reduce the cost of DSCs further.
2 Experimental
2.1 Material preparation
Nano-scaled tungsten oxides and carbides were synthesized as follows. Tungsten chloride (3.97 g, WCl6) was added to 10 mL ethanol while stirring for 30 mins. The solution immediately turned brown, producing W-orthoester. Next, proper amounts (0, 1, 3, 5, 7 equivalent) of urea were added to the obtained W-orthoester and stirred until the urea was completely dissolved. Subsequently, the viscous solution was dried at 130 °C to get rid of the residual solvent. After being sintered at 800 °C for 4 h under N2 atmosphere, the objective products were obtained.
2.2 Cells assembly
Counter electrodes fabrication: Pt CE was obtained according to a previous work.31 The other CEs were prepared with spray coating technique. As an example of WO2 electrode, a mixture of 500 mg WO2 powder and 4 g zirconium dioxide pearl was dispersed in 3 mL absolute alcohol inside an agate pot. The mixture was milled for 4 h. Then it was ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min. The WO2 paste was prepared. The WO2 paste was sprayed on FTO glass (Asahi Glass, type U, 13 Ω □−1, Japan) at room temperature with an airbrush (TD-128, Tiandi Co., Ltd.) connected to an air compressor (TC-118, Aihui Co., Ltd.). The prepared WO2 film was sintered at 500 °C in N2 for 30 min, and the WO2 CE was obtained. Photoanode fabrication: a 5 layers of TiO2 (Solaronix D, Switzerland) nanocrystalline film sensitized with N719 dye (Solaronix, Switzerland) was used as photoanode. In detail, a thin layer TiO2 was coated on FTO conductive glass with screen printing technique. Then the TiO2 film was sinter at 200 °C for 15 min. Repeating the process above-mentioned four times and 5 layers of TiO2 film was obtained. After sintered at 500 °C for 10 min, cooling to room temperature, the TiO2 film was treated with 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution, and then washed with distilled water. Sintered at 500 °C for 30 min, the mesoporous nanocrystalline TiO2 film was completely fabricated. The thickness of the nanocrystalline TiO2 film was 12 μm. Then, the TiO2 film was pre-heated to 80 °C and immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye in acetonitrile/tert-butyl alcohol (1:1 volume ration) for 20 h and the photoanode was obtained. The electrolyte contains 0.06 M of LiI, 0.6 M 1-propyl-3-methylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine, and 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate in acetonitrile. Cells fabrication: DSCs was assembled with a photoanode and a CE clipping the electrolyte and sealed by hot-melt surlyn film. A symmetrical cell was assembled with two identical CEs. The active area of the DSCs is 0.16 cm2. The active area of the symmetrical cells is 0.56 cm2. The DSCs were used for the photocurrent–voltage test, and the symmetrical cells were used for the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel-polarization curve test.
2.3 Measurements
XRD measurements were conducted using an automatic X-ray powder diffractometer (D/Max 2400, RIGAKU). The surface morphologies of the oxide films were achieved by scanning electron microscopy (FEI, HITACHI, S-4800). The photovoltaic performance of the DSCs was tested in simulated AM 1.5 illumination (I = 100 mW cm−2, PEC-L15, Peccell, Japan) with a digital source meter (Keithley 2601, USA). EIS experiments were characterized with symmetrical cells using a computer-controlled potentiostat (Zennium Zahner, Germany). The measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz. The amplitude of the alternating current was set at 10 mV, and the bias was −0.75 V. The spectra were fitted by Zview software. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out in a three-electrode system in an argon-purged acetonitrile solution, which contained 0.1 M LiClO4, 10 mM LiI, and 1 mM I2 at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 using a BAS 100B/W electrochemical analyzer. Pt worked as a counter electrode, and Ag/Ag+ worked as a reference electrode. Tafel-polarization curve measurements were carried out with an electrochemical workstation system (LK-9805, Tianjin Lanli Inc.) in a symmetrical dummy cell. The scan rate was set at 10 mV s−1.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Materials preparation and characterization
Urea–metal chloride route is a burgeoning method to synthesize early transition metal compounds, such as oxides, nitrides and carbides.32 According to the aforementioned method, tungsten oxides (WO2, WO3) and carbides (WC, W2C) were synthesized smoothly, with WCl6 as metal source, ethanol as oxygen source and urea as carbon source. As depicted in the experimental section, first, proper amount of WCl6 was added to absolute ethanol to form W-orthoester (brown solution). In this step, fresh WCl6 is crucial, because WCl6 can deteriorate easily. Next, 0, 1, 3, 5, 7 equivalent of urea were added to the W-orthoester solutions and the precursors were obtained after removing the residual ethanol solvent. Finally, sintering the precursors at 800 °C for 4 h under N2 atmosphere, the tungsten oxides and carbides were achieved. In the sinter step, sufficient N2 is required and the rate of temperature increase (3 °C min−1) needs strict control to guarantee high purity of the products.
In Fig. 1a, as the urea/metal chloride (WCl6) molar ratio increased from 1 to 7 (represented by W-R1, R3, R5, and R7, respectively), the precursor transformed to WO2 (W-R1), to W2C (W-R5), and then to WC/W2C (W-R7). In the case of W-R1, pure WO2 is obtained and the diffraction peaks can be assigned to the planes of [011], [002], [301], [220], [013], [231], [413], and [233] for WO2 (32-1393, PDF 2 database). As for W-R3, we obtained a composite of W/W2C, where W is dominant. The peaks at 40.3°, 58.2° and 73.2° can be assigned to the planes of [110], [200] and [211] for W (04-0806, PDF 2 database). Given that the urea/metal chloride molar ratio is up to 5, pure W2C with good crystallinity is obtained and the peaks can be assigned to the planes of [100], [002], [101], [102], [110], [103], [112] and [201] for W2C (35-0776, PDF 2 database). In W-R7 sample, W2C is partly converted to WC. Different from the results of a previous report, WO2 is obtained with low urea content rather than the expected W2N.33 In previous research, the metal chloride is the expensive WCl4. In contrast, WCl4 is replaced with low cost WCl6 in our work.

In this study, the carbon source and oxygen source is either the urea or the ethanol which is used as solvent as well. To investigate this issue, we repeated the experiment without adding urea (represented by W-R0), and tungsten oxides were obtained instead of carbides. This result confirms that the carbon source is the urea, and the oxide source is the ethanol. The peaks of W-R0 at 23.6° and 33.7° can be assigned to the planes of [002] and [202], respectively, for WO3 (43-1035, PDF 2 database); the other peaks can be assigned to WO2. Fig. 1b–f shows the various surface morphologies of the nano-scaled products by SEM images. WO3 and WO2 show the form of a prism, while the WC/W2C has that of a pyramid with a relatively large size. The W2C shows the form of a spindle. The W/W2C exists as a spherical object, however, we can not differentiate W2C and W in the composite of W2C/W. The diameter of the spherical object is about 17.6 nm. As discussed above, the nano-sized oxides and carbides have been successfully synthesized.
3.2 Application of tungsten oxides and carbides in DSCs as CEs
Subsequently, we tried to use the prepared carbides and oxides to assemble DSCs as CEs. Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of these DSCs, and the photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The tungsten oxides and carbides all showed impressive catalytic activity. The DSCs using tungsten carbides as CEs achieve high PCE of 6.68% (W2C) and 6.23% (WC/W2C). The DSC based on the composite CE of WO3/WO2 shows a PCE of 6.07%, and the DSC using W/W2C composite CE (although W is dominant) also shows a high PCE of 5.47%. In our previous work, the PCE of the DSC using large scaled tungsten carbide as CE catalyst was 5.35%, reaching 67.8% of the PCE originated from the DSC with Pt CE.25 In this work, the PCE of the DSCs using nano-scaled WC/W2C and W2C as CE catalysts reached 81.4% and 87.3% of the PCE originated from the DSC with Pt CE as we anticipated. Thus, the nano-scaled tungsten carbides perform better than the large sized one evidently. What deserves special mention here is that the DSC based on WO2 CE achieves the highest PCE of 6.88%, which is comparable to the performance of the DSCs using conventional Pt CE (7.65%). This is consistent with our previous research.30 In a preliminary summary, the nano-scaled carbides (W2C, WC/W2C) and oxides (WO2) all show high catalytic activities in DSCs as CE catalysts.

3.3 Electrochemical process of the tungsten oxides and carbides by CV, EIS, and Tafel-polarization curve tests
To evaluate the catalytic activity of the synthesized materials, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out for W2C, WC/W2C, WO2 and Pt electrodes in a three-electrode system. Fig. 3 shows the cyclic voltammograms of these electrodes. In the case of Pt, a typical curve with two pairs of redox peaks were obtained as reported in the previous work.34 The cathodic peak at 0.54 V can be assigned to the reaction of eqn (1), while the cathodic peak at −0.08 V can be assigned to the reaction of eqn (2). I3− + 2e− ⇄ 3I−(1) 3I2 + 2e− ⇄ 2I3−(2)
 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammograms of the as-prepared WC/W2C, W2C, WO2 and Pt electrodes. 
Two cathodic peaks were observed for W2C (0.49 V, −0.03 V) WC/W2C (0.56 V, −0.13 V) and WO2 (0.50 V, −0.09 V) electrodes indicating a higher catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide as similar to Pt. In detail, WO2 exhibits a larger current density than the other two tungsten carbides, resulting in the highest catalytic activity. For the carbides, the current density of W2C is higher than WC/W2C. On the other hand, the ΔEP (peak–peak separation) of W2C is lower than WC/W2C, indicating a better reversibility and a large charge transfer rate which are both beneficial for achieving a high catalytic activity.35,36 These materials all show high catalytic activity for triiodide reduction and they indeed perform well in the DSC systems as expected.
To evaluate the catalytic activities of the synthesized carbides and oxides for triiodide reduction, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were carried out with symmetrical cells fabricated by two identical electrodes. Fig. 4 shows the typical Nyquist plots. The detailed parameters are listed in Table 1. In the case of Pt, the series resistance (Rs) can be assigned to the impedance at high frequency where the phase is zero. The left semicircle at high frequency is assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) in the electrode/electrolyte interface and the corresponding double layer capacitance (Cμ); the right semicircle at low frequency is assigned to the Nernst diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couples in the electrolyte.
 Fig. 4  Nyquist plots the symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes. 
The values of the EIS parameters were obtained by fitting the EIS plots with an equivalent circuit.9 The Rct of WO2, W2C, and WC/W2C electrode are 18.4, 20.8 and 24.7 Ω, respectively. These Rct values are larger that of the Pt (7.0 Ω), demonstrating that these materials show lower activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide as compared to Pt. Besides, the Cμ of the these electrodes are all much larger than that of the Pt electrode, indicating that WO2, W2C and WC/W2C electrodes have a large surface area.11 On the other hand, the values of the ZN for the these electrodes mentioned above are all larger than that of the Pt electrode, which is corresponding to a slower diffusion velocity of the redox species in the electrolyte.12 The large Rct and ZN value are the major cause behind the slightly lower PCE of the DSCs using the these CEs as compared to the Pt based DSC. Although W is dominant, the composite of W/W2C electrode has a relatively small Rct value of 36.5 Ω rising from the combined actions of W2C as an excellent catalyst and W as a superior conductor of electricity. This can be a new strategy combining good catalytic activity of one material and good electrical conductivity of another material into one material to achieve a superior catalyst.12 Moreover, the Rct value of the composite of WO3/WO2 electrode is larger than that of the pure WO2 electrode.
As a powerful characterization method, Tafel-polarization curve measurement was used in this experiment to evaluate the catalytic activities of the novel carbide and oxide electrodes. Fig. 5 shows the Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells that are similar to the ones used in EIS measurements; they show logarithmic J as a function of U. In theory, the Tafel curve can be divided into three zones. The curve at low potential (|U| <120 mV) is attributed to the polarization zone, the curve at the middle potential (with a sharp slop) is attributed to the Tafel zone, and the curve at high potential (horizontal part) is attributed to the diffusion zone. The latter two has a close relationship with the catalytic activity of the catalysts.
 Fig. 5  Tafel curves of the symmetrical cells fabricated with two identical electrodes. 
In the Tafel zone, the curves of the WO2, W2C, and WC/W2C electrodes show a large slope, illustrating that there is a large exchange current density (J0) on the surfaces of these electrodes as compared to that of the Pt electrode. This means that these materials have superior catalytic activity for triiodide reduction. Meanwhile, the curve of WO3/WO2 shows a gentle slop, demonstrating that it cannot catalyze triiodide reduction as effectively as Pt. In addition, J0 varies inversely with Rct (eqn (3)). With the EIS results, the change tendency of J0 of various electrodes is generally in accordance with those presented in the Tafel-curve plots. (3)where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, F is Faraday's constant, n is the electron number involving in the reaction, and Rct is the charge transfer resistance.
In the diffusion zone, the WO2, W2C and WC/W2C all show higher limiting diffusion current density (Jlim), indicating a small ZN and a large diffusion coefficient.9 In contrast, the WO3/WO2 composite shows a low Jlim. Based on eqn (4), the Jlim results illustrate that the diffusion character of the redox couples in the electrolyte is generally in agreement with the EIS results.37 (4)where D is the diffusion coefficient of the triiodide, l is the spacer thickness, C is the triiodide concentration, and n, F have their usual meanings.
4 Conclusion
In summary, to obtain high catalytic activity, WO2, W2C, and WC/W2C with small sizes have been successfully synthesized through a simple method just by regulating the ratio of the starting materials. The prepared materials showed various surface morphologies, and each material had high catalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide to iodide in DSCs system. Using the low cost and high efficiency Pt-free CEs is a feasible path to reduce the cost of DSCs which is constructive to realize DSCs industrialization.
