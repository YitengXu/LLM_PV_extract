    , Accepted 26th July 2012First published on 26th July 2012AbstractWe have used a stepwise approach for cosensitization of a thiocyanate-free Ru(II) sensitizer with an organic dye (TDPP) for dye sensitized solar cells. The cosensitized SPS-01 + TDPP device showed enhanced Voc and Jsc relative to the individual dye sensitized solar cells. Upon the optimization, the device made of SPS-01 + TDPP dye yielded Jsc = 13.7 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.70 V, FF = 0.72 and power conversion efficiency (PCE) = 6.90%. This performance is superior to that of either individual DSSC made from SPS-01 (PCE = 5.47%) and TDPP (PCE = 4.82%), fabricated under the same conditions.
Dye sensitized solar cells represent one of the most promising environmentally friendly photovoltaic devices because of their low material cost, flexibility, easy manufacturing processes and high efficiency,1 since Grätzel and O'Regan reported ruthenium (Ru) based sensitizers in 1991.1a In DSSCs the photoelectric conversion is achieved by the ultra-fast injection of an electron from a photo-excited dye into the conduction band of a wide band gap metal oxide semiconductor and subsequent completion of dye regeneration and hole transportation to the counter electrode. DSSCs based on ruthenium sensitizers (N3, N719 and black dyes) have been reported to give high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) up to 11.7% under AM 1.5 irradiation.1d,2 DSSCs based on Ru complex dyes generally yield optimum efficiency with the use of a thick TiO2 film (>15 nm) because of the maximum molar extinction coefficients being much lower than 20000 M−1 cm−1 due to the metal to ligand charge transfer molecular excitation. Compared to these Ru complex dyes, organic dyes generally have larger molar extinction coefficients and enable thin films to be made that minimize the charge transport losses and achieve better pore filling for organic hole transport materials.3 One of the drawbacks of metal-free organic dyes is their relatively narrow absorption spectra that seriously weaken the light harvesting capabilities. The optimal organic sensitizers for DSSCs applications should possess a broadly extended absorption spectrum ranging to the near IR region in order to attain good overlap with the solar spectrum and to produce a large photocurrent. Therefore, the panchromatic approach was applied by co-adsorbing two different sensitizers on the TiO2 surface for complementary light absorption covering the whole solar spectrum. The high molar extinction coefficient of organic dyes in the visible region compensates for the weak absorbing ability of the metal based dyes.4 Several research groups have investigated the combination of two or more dyes as sensitizers for DSSCs, and found that the PCE of the DSSCs had been improved with respect to the individual sensitizers.5 Recently, Ko et al. reported a PCE of 10.2% for DSSCs based on the cosensitization using a Ru complex dye and metal-free organic dye.6 Ogura et al. from Sony research team reported a PCE of 11% using a combination of black dye with metal-free dye.7 These findings prompted us to investigate the effect of mixed dye adsorbed on TiO2 surface that allows the formation of a single monolayer on it, considering that the use of multiple dyes gives a lower coverage of each. Therefore, sensitizers with higher absorption coefficients require a smaller amount of adsorbed dye to yield a sufficient optical density with a thin TiO2 film, thereby providing sufficient space on TiO2 for the attachment of other sensitizers yielding a complementary absorption spectrum.8
In this study a thiocyanate-free Ru(II) sensitizer, incorporating phenylethenyl moiety into the anchoring bipyridine, represented as SPS-01 and metal-free dye represented as TDPP were used as sensitizers. The synthesis, optical and electrochemical properties of SPS-01 and TDPP have been reported by us in our earlier communications.9,10 In this communication, we report the improvement of the PCE of the SPS-01 based DSSC using a TDPP metal-free dye as cosensitizer. The improvement in PCE is mainly due the enhancement in Jsc, which is due to the increase in the light harvesting efficiency and reduction in the suppression of the SPS-01 aggregation at the TiO2 surface. PCE was further improved up to 8.1% by addition of DCA as a coadsorbent in SPS-01 + TDPP dye solution.
Experimental details
The thiocyanate-free ruthenium based dye SPS-01 and metal-free dye TDPP were synthesized as reported in our earlier communications.9,10 The chemical structures of SPS-01 and TDPP are shown in Fig. 1. Fluorine doped tin oxide (FTO) coated glass substrate was used for the deposition of the TiO2 layer. The photoanode was prepared as reported previously.11 The thickness and porosity of the TiO2 layer are 14 μm and 0.32, respectively. The dye solutions were prepared as follows: 2 mM SPS-01 in 1:1 acetonitrile and tert-butyl alcohol and 1 mM of TDPP dye in THF. The TiO2 electrode was immersed in solution containing SPS-01 at room temperature for 4 h. Afterwards, this SPS-01 sensitized film was washed, dried in air, and immersed in a solution containing TDPP dye in THF and kept at room temperature for 4 h. The Pt counter electrodes were prepared by spin casting drops of H2PtCl6 solution on FTO glass and heating at 350 °C for 15 min. To prevent a short circuit, two electrodes were assembled into a sandwich type cell with a spacer of 20 μm thickness. One drop of electrolyte solution (LiI (0.05 M), I2 (0.5 M), dimethyl-propyl-benzimidiazole iodide (DPMII) (0.6 M), 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) (0.5 M) in acetonitrile solution) was deposited onto the surface of the dye sensitized TiO2 electrode and penetrated the TiO2via capillary action. The Pt coated FTO electrode was then clipped onto the top of the TiO2 working electrode to form the complete DSSC. The effective area of the DSSC is around 0.25 cm2. The current–voltage characteristics (J–V) of the devices in dark and under illumination were measured by a Keithley source meter. A xenon light source coupled with optical filter was used to give an irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (equivalent to one sun at AM 1.5) at the surface of the device. The incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra of the devices were measured using a monochromator and the resultant photocurrents were measured with a Keithley electrometer (model 6514) which was interfaced to a computer by LABVIEW software. The electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) measurements were carried out by applying bias equivalent to the Voc of the device and recorded over a frequency of 1 mHz to 105 Hz with an AC amplitude of 10 mV, under illumination and in the dark. The above measurements were carried out using a potentiostat (PGSTAT 30 Autolab, Eco-Chemie) in both the dark as well as under illumination, equipped with frequency response analyzer (FRA). We have also fabricated the DSSCs based on individual dyes i.e.SPS-01 and TDPP for comparison of the device data.

Cyclic voltammetry was also performed to ensure that the LUMO level of SPS-01 is suited for injecting electrons into the conduction band of TiO2 and to verify whether the HOMO level matches the redox potential of the electrolyte. The onset oxidation potential and onset reduction potential of SPS-01 are 0.90 V (vs. NHE) and −0.93 V (vs. NHE).9 The oxidation potential and reduction potential of TDPP are 0.80 V (vs. NHE) and −1.06 V (vs. NHE), respectively.10 These values indicated that the oxidation potential and reduction potentials are suitable for dye regeneration and electron injection, respectively.11
Results and discussion

Fig. 2a and b show the absorption spectra of SPS-01 and TDPP in solution and adsorbed on to the TiO2 surface. SPS-01 exhibits two absorptions in solution, at 418 nm and 532 nm attributable to the metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) band mixed with a small amount of ligand to ligand charge transfer contribution. Adsorbing each SPS-01 and TDPP dye onto the TiO2 film, the optical absorption shows a redshift in the absorption peaks. Upon cosensitization with SPS-01 and TDPP on the TiO2 film, the absorption spectrum shows a broad absorption from 400 nm to 700 nm and the absorption peaks corresponds to the individual dyes SPS-01 and TDPP, also redshifted relative to their absorption bands in solution. This observation indicates that J-type aggregation occurs for SPS-01 + TDPP adsorbed onto TiO2. The absorption spectrum of TDPP complements that of SPS-01 for the cosensitized film, showing the panchromatic feature to render an optimal light harvesting effect in the region of 400–700 nm. Fig. 3 shows the current–voltage characteristics of the DSSCs fabricated with SPS-01, TDPP and SPS-01 + TDPP under the same experimental conditions. The photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. The results clearly show that upon cosensitization, the PCE of the DSSC based on SPS-01 + TDPP was improved to 6.9% which is higher than the DSSCs based on either SPS-01 (PCE = 5.47%) or TDPP (PCE = 4.82%). This enhancement is mainly attributed to the large increase in Jsc value (from 12.2 mA cm−2 and 10.4 mA cm−2 for SPS-01 and TDPP, respectively, to 13.7 mA cm−2). In order to identify the amount of dye adsorbed on the surface of the TiO2, which plays a vital role in the device performance, desorption of the dyes from the TiO2 surface was done using a 0.1 M NaOH in THF/acetonitrile:tert-butyl alcohol (1:1) mixture and then measuring their absorption spectra. We have measured the amount of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface and found that this is 4.5 × 10−6, 5.6 × 10−6 and 6.8 × 10−6 mol cm−2 for TDPP, SPS-01 and SPS-01 + TDDP systems, respectively. The increase in the amount of dye adsorbed for the DSSC with SPS-01 + TDPP is the main reason for the improvement of the Jsc value. As can be seen from Fig. 2b, the absorption spectrum of SPS-01 + TDPP is broader as compared to either SPS-01 or TDPP. It means the light harvesting efficiency has been improved by the cosensitization of dyes having complementary absorption bands. The improvement in PCE of the DSSC based on SPS-01 + TDPP is mainly attributed to the increase in the total amount of dye adsorption. In addition, the suppression of SPS-01 dye aggregation at the TiO2 surface also contributed to the solar cell performance to some extent.

Fig. 4 shows the IPCE spectra as a function of the wavelength for the DSSCs sensitized with different dye systems. There are three characteristic peaks around 420 nm, 540 nm and 680 nm, that are clearly observed in the IPCE spectrum of the DSSC based on cosensitization, which proved that the two dyes, i.e.SPS-01 and TDPP, are effectively co-adsorbed onto the surface of the TiO2, resulting in an increase in the Jsc compared to DSSCs based on individual dyes. The broader IPCE spectrum of DSSCs with cosensitized dyes over the whole visible region might contribute to a higher photocurrent, which can also be confirmed by the amount of dye adsorbed onto the TiO2 films.

The Voc value of a DSSC is related to the energy level of the TiO2 conduction band and conduction band electron density (n) in the TiO2 film. The Voc can be described as follows:Voc = (kT/q)ln(n/no)where k is the Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature (K), q is the electronic charge, no can be estimated under vacuum conditions as follows:no = Ncexp(Ecb − Eredox/kT)where Nc is the density of state in the conduction band of TiO2, Eredox is the potential of redox species (I−/I−3) in the electrolyte. From the above equations, we can deduce that a shift of Ecb or change of electron lifetime in TiO2 will influence the Voc because the electron density is correlated to the electron lifetime. As we have shown from the EIS measurements that the electron lifetime is higher for the cosensitized DSSC than either SPS-01 or TDPP sensitized DSSC. Therefore, we attributed the increase in Voc to the increase in electron lifetime, which is related to the charge recombination. This result suggests that the adsorption of TDPP onto the free area of the TiO2 surface exposed to the redox electrolyte has resulted in the formation of a compact monolayer that could effectively suppress the recombination of electrons into TiO2 film with I−3, with a resultant improvement of Voc. Since the molecular size of TDPP is smaller than SPS-01, it makes this suitable for compact layer formation through covering the bare TiO2 surface during the dye uptake process. The compact layer reduces recombination of injected electrons with I−3 ions and increases both the Jsc and Voc values, resulting in a higher PCE. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used to complete the analysis of injection of electrons from the excited state of the dye into the conduction band of the TiO2 and to gain an insight into the transport and charge losses characteristics of the DSSCs with different dyes.12 We have recorded the EIS data of the DSSCs in the dark under a forward bias voltage of −0.65 V. The Nyquist plots of EIS of the DSSCs with different dyes, in the dark are shown in Fig. 5a. Two semicircles including a small one at higher frequency (103–105 Hz) and a large semicircle at lower frequency are observed in the Nyquist plots. The small and large semicircles respectively indicated in the high and middle frequency regions are assigned to the charge transfer at Pt/electrolyte and TiO2/dye/electrolyte interfaces, respectively. Another small semicircle, which should have appeared at the low frequency region is overlapped by the middle frequency large semicircle. The larger semicircle at low frequency is ascribed to the recombination resistance and chemical capacitance across the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface in the DSSC. The charge recombination resistance (Rrec) at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface can be deduced by fitting curves from the range of the middle frequency using Z-view software. Rrec is related to the charge recombination rate between injected electron and the electron acceptor I−3 ion in the electrolyte, estimated by the large semicircle width. The value of Rrec for the SPS-01 + TDPP (96 Ω) based DSSC is higher than that for either SPS-01 (78 Ω) or TDPP (54 Ω) based DSSCs. In the Bode plots (Fig. 5b), the peaks at higher frequencies correspond to the charge transfer at the counter electrode and the peaks at the lower frequencies are related to the charge recombination rate and its reciprocal is regarded as electron lifetime.13 The peak maximum is shifted to lower frequencies from TDPP to SPS-01 + TDPP in the same sequence as that observed for the PCE. The electron lifetime values derived from the curve fitting for the DSSCs based on TDPP, SPS-01 and SPS-01 + TDPP are 14.2, 22.0 and 26.3 ms, respectively.

Thus the SPS-01 + TDPP cosensitized DSSC has the longest electron lifetime, indicative of a more effective suppression of the back reaction between the injected electrons and the electrolyte, resulting in the improvement of the Voc due to the reduced charge recombination rate.14
The PCE for the DSSC based on cosensitized SPS-01 + TDPP is still low due to the dye aggregation at the TiO2 surface, resulting in a low Jsc. When the dye is adsorbed onto the TiO2 surface, π–π stacking of organic dye molecules usually occurs because of the strong intermolecular interaction. Prohibition of π–π stacking with additives in the dye solution is a typical way to improve the PCE of DSSCs suffering from the π–π stacking problem. We have investigated the effect of deoxycholic acid (DCA) coadsorption on the photovoltaic performance of the DSSC based on SPS-01 + TDPP dyes. The current–voltage characteristics of the DSSC based on SPS-01 + TDPP with 20 mM DCA coadsorbent is also shown in Fig. 3 and photovoltaic parameters are complied in Table 1. The PCE has been improved from 6.9% to 8.1%, with the addition of DCA as coadsorbent in the dye solution. It can be seen from Table 1 that the increase in PCE is mainly due to the improvement in Jsc with the addition of DCA coadsorbent.
Since the adsorption of DCA leaves protons on the TiO2 surface and hence they charge the surface positively, the conduction band edge of TiO2 may be positively shifted by the coadsorption of DCA. The positive shift of conduction band edge enlarges the driving force for electron injection, which results in the enhancement of Jsc.15 In addition, coadsorbent also breaks up dye aggregation, and the non-aggregated dye molecules are favorable for electron injection.
We have also measured the EIS spectra of DSSC based on SPS-01 + TDPP dyes with DCA coadsorbent and found that similar plots are observed for the DSSC with SPS-01 + TDPP but the semicircle corresponding to the middle frequency range has a higher diameter, indicating the higher value of Rrec. The frequency peak observed in the Bode plot also shifts towards the lower frequency region, for SPS-01 + TDPP with DCA. These results indicate that the recombination of injected electrons with the electrolyte has been further improved when DCA was added to the dye solution during the sensitization.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we have used a cosensitized SPS-01 and TDPP dye for the fabrication of DSSCs and found that this device exhibits a significant improvement not only in Jsc but also of Voc, yielding an overall PCE of 6.9%, greater than the DSSC containing only the SPS-01 (5.47%) and TDPP (4.82%) individual dyes. The Jsc is enhanced because of the combined light harvesting effect of the two dyes that have complementary absorption spectra, and Voc is enhanced because of the retarded charge recombination with electrolyte. The PCE of the DSSC has been improved up to 8.1%, when DCA as coadsorbent is added to the dye solution. These are the preliminary data on the cosensitization of dyes, we are planning to investigate the effect of the percentage of the two dyes, and time of sensitization on the PCE of DSSCs. The work is in progress and will be communicated once completed.
