    , Accepted 19th December 2016First published on 20th December 2016AbstractNovel polymers comprising a 3-fluoro-5-alkylthiophenyl benzodithiophene donor unit and a 5-fluoro-6-alkoxy (or alkylthio)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) acceptor unit were synthesized. Both POF and PSF possess low HOMO and LUMO energy levels due to the incorporation of fluorine atoms. Additionally, alkoxy and alkylthio substitution on the BT unit also had a great influence on the molecular packing and the energy level of the resulting polymers. The introduction of the alkylthio side chains on the BT unit of PSF led to a significant downshift of the HOMO energy level in comparison to that of POF with an alkoxy substituent due to the weaker electron-donating properties of the sulfur atom than that of oxygen. However, the steric hindrance caused by the large sulfur atoms resulted in reduced planarity of the backbone of PSF, which might influence the charge transport and the morphology of the blend film. As a result, POF based NF-PSCs exhibited a PCE of 7.28%, with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.47, while a low PCE of 1.55% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 5.6 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.29 was obtained for PSF based non-fullerene polymer solar cells (NF-PSCs). Therefore, the side chain engineering of the donor polymer is crucial for maximizing both Jsc and Voc values to achieve high performance polymer solar cells.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with a bulk heterojunction structure have attracted extensive attention due to their unique characteristics such as light weight, low cost and flexibility.1–3 Generally, a p-type donor material (conjugated polymers or small molecules) and an n-type acceptor material (fullerene derivatives, conjugated polymers or small molecules) were blended as the active layer to harvest light.4 Over the past decade, thousands of new conjugated polymers have sprung up for application in fullerene polymer solar cells (F-PSCs).5–10 A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 11% for single junction F-PSCs has been achieved.11,12 Recently, the PCE of non-fullerene PSCs (NF-PSCs) has surpassed that of F-PSCs.13 Some outstanding non-fullerene acceptors, such as 2,2′-[[6,6,12,12-tetrakis(4-hexylphenyl)-6,12-dihydrodithieno[2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]dithiophene-2,8-diyl]bis[methylidyne(3-oxo-1H-indene-2,1(3H)-diylidene)]]bis[propane dinitrile] (ITIC),14 naphthalene diimide (NDI) derivatives,15,16 perylene diimide (PDI) derivatives, etc.,17–28 have been widely employed to blend with polymer donors due to their strong and broad absorption and high electron mobility. Using ITIC as the electron acceptor and a limited number of conjugated polymers such as PTB7, J61, PBDD4T-2F, PBDTS-DTBTO, HD-PBDT2FT, PDCBT and PDBT-T as the electron donors, PCEs of NF-PSCs have reached 7–12%.4,14,29–32 As the core component of the photoactive layer, the development of novel and high efficiency donor materials that are suitable for NF-PSCs is still in high demand.
Both the alkyl side chains and the fluoro substitution on the polymer backbone can significantly influence the performance of PSCs.7,33 On one hand, side chains can affect the solubility and molecular packing of conjugated polymers, the charge mobility, the energy levels, the blend morphology and the device performance.34–39 On the other hand, the introduction of fluorine atoms on the polymer backbone can lower the HOMO and LUMO energy levels and enhance the intermolecular interaction as well as packing due to their strong electron withdrawing ability.30,40–43
Inspired by this idea, two novel donor–acceptor (D–A) alternative polymers (POF and PSF) utilizing 3-fluoro-5-alkylthiophenyl substituted BDT as a donor unit and 5-fluoro-6-alkoxybenzothiadiazole or 5-fluoro-6-alkylthio-benzothiadiazole as an acceptor unit were synthesized (Scheme 1). The results indicate that both polymers POF and PSF possess low HOMO and LUMO energy levels due to the incorporation of fluorine atoms. Additionally, the introduction of the alkylthio side chains on the BT unit of PSF led to a significant downshift of the HOMO energy level in comparison to POF with an alkoxy substituent. The lower HOMO level of PSF (−5.66 eV) than that of POF (−5.49 eV) can be ascribed to the weaker electron-donating properties of the sulfur atom than those of oxygen.44,45 Therefore, a higher Voc of 0.95 V was obtained for PSF:ITIC based NF-PSCs, while a Voc of only 0.86 V was obtained for POF:ITIC based NF-PSCs. The offset of the LUMO energy levels (ΔELUMO) between POF and ITIC is 0.19 eV, which can be expected to provide enough driving force for exciton dissociation. However, 0.03 eV for ΔELUMO between PSF and ITIC might be disadvantageous for overcoming the binding energy for exciton dissociation. Additionally, the steric hindrance caused by the large sulfur atoms resulted in a reduced planarity of the backbone for PSF, which might influence the charge transport and the morphology of the blend film. As a result, the comprehensive effect led to worse photovoltaic properties of PSF based NF-PSCs even though a higher Voc can be achieved. POF based NF-PSCs exhibited a PCE of 7.28%, with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.47, while a low PCE of 1.55% with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 5.6 mA cm−2, and an FF of 0.29 was obtained for PSF based NF-PSCs. Therefore, the side chain engineering of the donor polymer is crucial for maximizing both Jsc and Voc values to achieve high performance polymer solar cells.

Results and discussion
Materials synthesis and characterization
As shown in Scheme 1, PSF and POF polymers were synthesized by the Stille polycondensation of M1 with M2 and M3, respectively. The molecular weights and molecular weight distributions of these two polymers were determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using chlorobenzene (CB) as an eluent at 80 °C calibrated with polystyrene standards, and the results are summarized in Table 1. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the two polymers show good thermal stability with the 5% decomposition temperature up to 352 °C for POF and 375 °C for PSF (Fig. S1, ESI†). The influence of different substitutions at the BT unit on the molecular packing of polymer chains was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD). As shown in Fig. 1, the diffraction peaks in the wide angle region located at 2θ of 23.68° for POF and 22.17° for PSF indicated that the π–π stacking distances are 3.76 Å for POF and 4.01 Å for PSF. These results showed that POF polymer chains could be more closely packed than those of PSF, which is beneficial for hole transportation.

In addition, the computational modelling studies also demonstrated that POF with an alkoxy substituent on the BT unit exhibited a nearly coplanar conformation with a dihedral angle of 4.0° between thiophene and BT (as shown in Fig. 2); whereas the alkylthio substituent group at the BT unit caused a larger torsion between thiophene and BT with a dihedral angle of 9.6°. The reduced planarity was caused by the steric hindrance of the larger sulfur atom.

Optical and electrochemical properties
The optical properties of POF and PSF were investigated by UV visible absorption spectroscopy. As shown in Fig. 3a, POF both in a dilute DCB solution and as a thin film exhibited similar structured absorption spectra with three peaks located at 422, 572 and 622 nm, respectively. After heating the dilute DCB solution to 150 °C, the long wavelength peak at 622 nm disappeared as shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†), indicating that POF already formed a strong π–π interaction in dilute DCB solution at room temperature. As for PSF, it displayed two absorption peaks (406 and 535 nm) in dilute DCB solution. On going from solution to film, the two absorption peaks are red-shifted to 413 and 570 nm, respectively. The lack of a long wavelength peak indicated that PSF formed only an amorphous film. This is consistent with the XRD experiment result. As listed in Table 2, the film absorption edges of POF and PSF are located at 693 and 696 nm, corresponding to the optical band gaps of 1.79 and 1.78 eV, respectively.

Cyclic voltammetry was performed to evaluate the LUMO and HOMO energy levels of POF and PSF. As shown in Fig. 3b, the onset oxidative potentials were determined to be 0.89 V for POF and 0.96 V for PSF, corresponding to the HOMO levels of −5.49 eV and −5.66 eV, respectively. The deeper HOMO energy level of PSF probably originated from the weaker electron-donating ability of the sulfur atom than that of the oxygen atom on the BT unit.45 The LUMO levels were therefore calculated to be −3.70 eV for POF and −3.88 eV for PSF using the equation: ELUMO = EHOMO + Eg,opt. The LUMO level of POF is 0.19 eV higher than that of ITIC; whereas the LUMO of PSF is close to that of ITIC (Fig. 4).32

Photovoltaic properties
To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of POF and PSF as the donors for NF-PSCs, ITIC was chosen as the electron acceptor and photovoltaic cells with a reverse device structure of ITO/ZnO/polymer:ITIC/MoO3/Ag were fabricated. With an optimized D–A ratio of 1:2, a PCE of 6.49% with a Voc of 0.88 V, a Jsc of 13.6 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.54 was achieved for POF (Table 3). After thermal annealing at 180 °C for 5 minutes, the PCE was further enhanced to 7.28% with the Jsc and FF improved to 14.9 mA cm−2 and 0.57, respectively. For PSF based devices, a high Voc of 0.95 V was obtained as expected, but a very low PCE of 1.15% with a low Jsc of 4.4 mA cm−2 and a low FF of 0.27 was acquired under optimized conditions. Similarly, the PCE was increased from 1.15% to 1.55% with a slightly improved Jsc of 5.6 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.29 after thermal annealing at 180 °C for 5 minutes (Fig. 5). In comparison with POF, a higher Voc of PSF based NF-PSCs was derived from its deeper HOMO energy level. The lower Jsc and FF might have originated from lower hole mobility, unmatched energy levels and poor morphology.

To better understand the photovoltaic properties of PSF and POF, the electron and hole mobilities of active layers were measured by a space-charge limited current (SCLC) method in device configurations of ITO/PEDOT/polymer:ITIC/Au and FTO/polymer:ITIC/Al (as shown in Fig. S4, ESI†), respectively. The active layers were fabricated under optimized conditions. The hole and electron mobilities of POF:ITIC blend films were calculated to be 1.97 × 10−5 and 1.90 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The balanced electron and hole mobility (μe/μh = 1.04) is beneficial for achieving a high PCE for devices. Compared with POF, PSF:ITIC blend films exhibited much lower electron and hole mobilities with a μh of 1.73 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1 and a μe of 9.69 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Such an unbalanced electron and hole mobility (μe/μh = 5.6) would result in lower Jsc and FF for PSF based devices.
Morphologies
The film morphology of blend films, which is crucial to the photovoltaic performance, was investigated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). POF:ITIC and PSF:ITIC blend films used for TEM investigations were fabricated under optimized conditions with thermal annealing at 180 °C for 5 minutes as shown in Fig. 6 (SEM images are shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). Both POF:ITIC and PSF:ITIC blend films exhibited apparent phase separation. The size of aggregates of POF:ITIC blend films is obviously smaller than that of PSF:ITIC blend films. Generally, small molecule ITIC exhibits better crystallinity than polymers and can easily form large aggregates, which are not beneficial to charge separation.46 The large aggregates were formed by the crystallization of ITIC and these aggregates can be easily removed by washing the blend film with acetone, which is a good solvent for ITIC but a bad solvent for the polymer. As shown in Fig. 6c and d, the blend films became much smoother after washing with acetone. The formation of smaller size aggregates of ITIC when blending with POF is beneficial for achieving high performance PSCs. The stronger intermolecular interaction of POF may be responsible for the formation of smaller ITIC aggregates.

Conclusion
Two new polymers POF and PSF with similar backbones and different side chains were synthesized and applied in NF-PSCs. The influence of side chains on the photophysical properties of polymers was investigated and the results demonstrated that the alkylthio substituted BT based PSF exhibited a lower HOMO level (−5.66 eV) than the alkoxy substituted BT based POF (−5.49 eV). Compared with PSF, POF exhibited a stronger intermolecular interaction with a closer π–π stacking distance for the polymer backbones. As a result of the better planarity, matching energy levels, high hole mobility and high-quality film, POF:ITIC based solar cells achieved a PCE of 7.28% with a Voc of 0.86 V, a Jsc of 14.9 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.47. For the PSF:ITIC based PSCs, a PCE of only 1.55% was obtained with a Voc of 0.95 V, a Jsc of 5.6 mA cm−2 and an FF of 0.29. Our results have demonstrated that for the nonfullerene polymer solar cells, the exchange of the oxygen atom with the sulfur atom on the side chain for polymers has a great influence on the performance of the devices. And the result also demonstrated that side chain engineering could be an effective way to enhance the performance of nonfullerene polymer solar cells.
