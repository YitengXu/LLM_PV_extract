    , Accepted 19th June 2013First published on 19th June 2013AbstractThe incorporation of electron-withdrawing groups in carbene based ruthenium complexes significantly affected their light-harvesting capabilities. The remarkable increase in the conversion efficiency was exhibited by the primary amide substituted sensitizer, CI103 (9.32%), compared to that of CI101 (5.44%) and the N719 dye (8.43%). The finding gives an efficient approach to enhance the photocurrent density and the power conversion efficiency of the solar cell.
Owing to their flexibility and economical manufacturing, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have emerged as an effective photovoltaic technology in the past years.1–3 A standard DSSC is generally composed of four main components: a TiO2 nanoparticle electrode, a light harvesting dye, a redox electrolyte, and a counter electrode.4–6 The sensitizer is an important element in the DSSC that initiates the device operation upon solar light absorption and injects the exited electrons into the TiO2 conduction band.7 Therefore, many efforts have been focused on the design and synthesis of various photosensitizers, such as ruthenium complexes,7,8 non-ruthenium metal dyes,9–11 and metal free organic sensitizers.12–15 Among them, ruthenium(II) complexes were intensively investigated as potential sensitizing candidates with efficient DSSC performance, because of their intense metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) absorption bands in the visible region and their easily tunable redox properties.16–18 Various molecular engineering strategies were employed on the anchoring and ancillary ligands in the ruthenium sensitizers to improve the solar-to-electricity conversion efficiencies of DSSCs.7 In the sensitization process, the anchoring groups are utilized to attach the dyes onto the TiO2 nanoparticle film and promote the injection of the photo-induced electrons into the Fermi level of the semiconductor electrode. Various kinds of groups, such as phosphate19,20 or boronic acid,21 were reported, but the carboxylic acid remained the most common and efficient anchoring group.22,23 Tremendous efforts were also made to enhance the device performance by structural modification of the ancillary ligands.7 Several efficient ruthenium sensitizers have been reported using extended π-conjugated ancillary groups, which were elongated with light-harvesting chromophores such as thiophene,24–26 triphenylamine,27–29 carbazole,30–32 or other substituents.33–35 Despite enormous efforts towards the exploration of new ruthenium sensitizers for the efficiency enhancement, there is still a need for efficient sensitizers with mass production to promote the commercialization of DSSCs.
In our previous work, we demonstrated that the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC)–pyridine ruthenium complexes were promising sensitizers to improve the efficiencies of DSSCs.36 The structural modification in the imidazole part of the ancillary ligand with different N-substituents significantly affected the light-harvesting capability of sensitizers.37 After examining the X-ray structure of our previously reported dyes, we were motivated to introduce an electron withdrawing (EW) group at the position opposite to the NCS ligand, which might help to direct the electron flow from NCS to Ru-metal and then to the anchoring groups to enhance the conversion efficiency.37 To the best of our knowledge, ruthenium sensitizers in which the bipyridine ancillary ligand is directly attached by a strong polar substituent, such as cyano and primary amide groups, have not been reported. We believe that the primary amide group, with its moderate EW capability and its ability of hydrogen bonding, could be capable of increasing the photo-current density and also help the sensitizer to bind to the TiO2 surface. For comparison, we also include the electron-donating (ED) group as the substituent and study its impact on the photophysical properties of NHC–pyridine ruthenium sensitizers. Due to the unique electronic properties of carbene,38,39 the introduction of EW or ED groups on the NHC–pyridine ligands might alter the electron lifetime or electron transport in the device. Following the above strategies, we prepared a series of ruthenium NHC complexes (Scheme 1) with ED or EW functional groups: methyl group [CI101 (1)], cyano group [CI102 (2)], and amide group [CI103 (3)]. A DSSC sensitized with CI103 (3) showed the best performance among the devices, with higher power conversion efficiency than that of the N719 dye under identical conditions of cell fabrication and measurement.
 Scheme 1  Structures of NHC–pyridine-based ruthenium sensitizers: CI101 (1), CI102 (2), and CI103 (3). 
In this communication, we report three novel sensitizers, in which electron donating/withdrawing groups are attached to the pyridine ring of the NHC–pyridine ancillary ligand. The structures of these dyes were confirmed by NMR and mass spectroscopy (see Scheme S1 in the ESI†). Preparation of these ruthenium complexes was accomplished by simple and practical synthetic protocols and inexpensive purification techniques without using LH20. The UV-vis absorption spectra of these new NHC–pyridine ruthenium sensitizers, CI101 (1), CI102 (2), and CI103 (3), in solutions and on films are displayed in Fig. 1a. The UV-vis spectra of these dyes in solution exhibited broad and strong absorption in the range from 350 to 750 nm. The intermediate energy absorption bands in the region of 350–475 nm can be attributed to the intraligand π–π* transitions of dcbpy ligand and carbene–pyridine ligand as well as to some contributions from the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) transitions. The lower energy absorption bands in the region of 500–580 nm and indistinct shoulders from 620 nm to 780 nm are characteristics of the MLCT transitions. The MLCT transition is one of the dominant factors for determining the efficiency of a photosensitizer.40,41 A gradual hypsochromic shift of the lower energy MLCT bands occurred as the substituent changed from the ED methyl group (CI101) to the EW cyano group (CI102) and the amide moiety (CI103). It should be noted that the lower MLTC energy bands of CI102 and CI103 exhibited higher extinction coefficients than that of CI101 and dyes with EW groups (CI102 and CI103) are expected to show better cell performance. Fig. 1b depicts the transient absorption spectra for all three dyes anchored to nanocrystalline TiO2 thin films immersed in a CH3CN–t-BuOH (1:1) solution. In solution (Fig. 1a), the absorption maximum of CI103 (3) in the MLCT region (520 nm, ε = 0.815 × 104 M−1 cm−1) showed lower extinction coefficient than that (520 nm, ε = 0.915 × 104 M−1 cm−1) of CI102 (2), whereas the spectra of CI102 and CI103 on films (Fig. 1b) exhibited the same absorption plateau. The equivalence in the absorption properties of CI102 and CI103 on TiO2 films (Fig. 1b) could be possible only when the amount of CI103 adsorbed was higher than that of CI102 under the same conditions, which may be attributed to variation in the influence of the amide and cyano groups. All above observations clearly demonstrate that the electronic transitions of these NHC–pyridine ruthenium complexes have been tuned by the choice of the substituent.

The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels are essential parameters of the sensitizer to evaluate the possibility of an electron transfer process in the DSSCs.42 The location of the HOMO energy level should be sufficiently negative for photo-oxidized dye regeneration and the LUMO should well match the TiO2 conduction band edge for efficient electron injection. The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of all ruthenium complexes were calculated by the cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis absorption spectra (Table 1). The oxidation potentials of CI101 (1), CI102 (2), and CI103 (3) were determined to be 0.27, 0.36, and 0.32 eV, respectively. These results were reflected in the variation of the HOMO energy levels. Compared to N719, the HOMOs of sensitizers CI102 and CI103 were decreased by the influence of EW groups attached to the NHC–pyridine ligand; however the methyl substituted dye (CI101) showed a slightly higher HOMO energy level. Furthermore, the LUMO+1 energy level of CI103 (Fig. S1, ESI†) was delocalized between the anchoring and the ancillary amide pyridine ligands which might favor the effective charge injection into the TiO2 conduction band.43 However, the strong pulling effect of the cyano group in CI102 resulted in the localization of the LUMO+1 energy level in the ancillary ligand, which might hamper the charge injection. The LUMOs of these substituted NHC–pyridine ruthenium sensitizers exhibited a behavior similar to that of N719. The calculated energy gaps were found to be in the range of 1.62–1.71 eV for all three complexes. These features indicate that these carbene dye molecules are energetically favorable for electron injection and dye regeneration.

The photovoltaic performance of DSSCs using CI101 (1), CI102 (2), and CI103 (3) was studied under the same fabrication conditions and compared to that of the device anchored with N719. Fig. 2 shows the photocurrent density–voltage curves and IPCE spectra of DSSCs sensitized with these dyes. The open-circuit voltages (Voc), short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc), fill factors (FF), and overall cell efficiencies (η) are summarized in Table 1. Under the standard AM 1.5 solar conditions, the Voc value of the CI101 (1) based cell showed the lowest value, but the devices sensitized with CI102 (2) and CI103 (3) displayed a value identical to that of the cell anchored with N719. These results indicate that the sensitizers (CI102 and CI103) bearing EW groups have an effect similar to that of the N719 dye on the Fermi level of TiO2 when they anchored onto the surface of the TiO2 electrode.44 Short-circuit photocurrent densities (Jsc) of the DSSCs based on CI101 (1), CI102 (2), and CI103 (3) sensitizers were 10.39, 14.76, and 18.42 mA cm−2, respectively. The higher Jsc value for the device sensitized by CI103 (3) can be ascribed to the ability of the primary amide group to chelate with I3− present in the redox couple.45 Also, the DSSC sensitized with CI103 (3) exhibited a higher Jsc value than that of the cell anchored with the N719 dye (16.36 mA cm−2). Accordingly, the power conversion efficiency of the CI101 sensitized cell was 5.44% and the η values of the cells were enhanced with EW groups (cyano and amide) in the ancillary ligands of the sensitizers (7.85% and 9.32%). The efficiency of the cell based on dye CI103 was also superior to that of the cell with the N719 dye (8.43%). The IPCE spectrum of the DSSC sensitized with CI103 showed higher IPCE values than those of CI101, CI102, and N719, which were consistent with the power conversion efficiencies. The IPCE spectrum of CI103 (3) covered the entire visible region (from 350 to 800 nm), reached the maxima of 75% at 520 nm, and showed a performance over 70% in the range from 440 to 560 nm. The above results reveal that the tuning of the NHC–pyridine ligand in the carbene based ruthenium sensitizers with withdrawing groups to reach the push and pull effect significantly enhances their IPCE thresholds as well as device performances.

In conclusion, the integration of the NHC–pyridine ligand with different functional groups in the ancillary ligand resulted in a new avenue of asymmetric ruthenium complex based DSSCs. We demonstrated that substituents like methyl, nitrile, and amide groups in the carbene ancillary ligand substantially affect the cell performances. Compared to CI101 and CI102, the CI103-sensitized film exhibited excellent light-harvesting capacity through the enrichment of spectral response due to the presence of a primary amide group in the ancillary ligand. The sensitizer CI103 (3) anchored cell also showed higher solar-to-electricity conversion efficiency than that of N719, which was consistent with the maximum IPCE value. The above benefits reveal that the fine tuning of the NHC–pyridine ligand functionalized with a polar moderate EW group might improve the Jsc value as well as the efficiency. This strategy provides an alternative method towards improving the efficiencies of DSSCs, instead of using the common approach of extension in the conjugation. Further development of carbene based NHC–pyridine ruthenium sensitizers with higher IPCE values and enhanced DSSC efficiencies is the next step in our investigation.
