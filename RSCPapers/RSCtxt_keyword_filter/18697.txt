    , Accepted 25th November 2022First published on 30th November 2022AbstractOrganic solar cells (OSCs) are considered promising wearable optoelectronic devices due to their environmental friendliness, light mass and inherent flexibility of the active layer. To achieve flexible devices, many efforts have been made to develop suitable flexible transparent and opaque electrodes. In this review, we systematically analyze the properties of flexible transparent electrodes used in flexible OSCs, including conducting oxides, conducting polymers, carbon nanomaterials, and metal nanostructures, and summarize the corresponding improvement strategies and device performance. Flexible opaque electrodes made of metals and carbon are also evaluated. Fiber and fabric shapes are the implementation forms of OSCs on wearable devices. These two devices' most recent developments in terms of their parts and processing strategies are outlined and examined. Also discussed are the challenges and prospects for wearing OSCs in the future.
1. Introduction
Lightweight, flexible, and efficient power supply systems are needed to meet the increasing demand for wearable and portable electronic devices. This view sees organic solar cells (OSCs) as a possible next-generation power source due to their benefits such as solid-state, light mass, and environmental friendliness.1 The most important aspect of OSCs, in particular, is the flexible active layer, which makes them ideal for construction into flexible devices.2 The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has gradually improved, and recently single-section devices have exceeded 19%, which can meet the demand of the photovoltaic market.3–6 However, efficient OSCs are mostly based on rigid substrates, which are not suitable for wearable environments. In recent years, flexible and even wearable OSCs have received increasing attention.
A flexible transparent electrode (FTE), a photoactive layer made up of a donor and an acceptor, two interface layers that transport electrons and holes, and another electrode are the main parts of flexible OSCs, as well as of textile-shaped wearable OSCs. The devices can be further subdivided into “conventional” and “inverted” configurations depending on how electron and hole extraction is performed. The emerging high-performance photovoltaic materials (e.g., polymer donor PTB7-Th,7,8 PM6,9,10 non-fullerene acceptor IT-4F,11,12 IEICO-4F,13,14 Y6,15,16etc.) are inherently flexible and light weight. Solution processing methods such as layer-by-layer also realize large-scale coating of the active layer, and the device exhibits high PCE.17,18 Therefore, another key point in developing flexible and lightweight OSCs is to find excellent transparent electrodes and top electrodes.
In Section 2, we review transparent electrode materials that can be applied to flexible substrates, including transparent conducting oxides (TCOs),19 transparent conducting polymers (TCPs),20,21 carbon nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes22 and graphene23,24) and metal nanostructures (metal nanowires,25 metal meshes,26 and ultrathin metal films27). We thoroughly contrast various FTEs in terms of mechanical qualities (flexibility and resilience), optoelectronic properties (optical transparency and conductivity), and simplicity of manufacture. We also include their restrictions for usage as transparent electrodes in flexible OSCs. Additionally, sophisticated manufacturing techniques and the corresponding modification techniques, including additive and interfacial modification, are covered. In Section 3, we discuss and evaluate pairs of opaque electrodes (bottom electrode of the top illumination device) that may be used with flexible OSCs. These electrodes can be made of conductive carbon or metallic materials.
The mechanical flexibility of thin-film OSCs based on flexible plastic substrates is not very satisfactory from the perspective of wearable applications. Therefore, fiber-shaped and fabric-based OSCs are developed, which are more compatible with comfortable everyday clothing. In Section 4, we review fiber-shaped organic solar cell monolithic devices with single and dual fiber structures. The advantages of fiber-shaped devices and the problems with improving their efficiency are introduced. In Section 5, we review fabric-based organic solar cell monolithic devices. One approach is to integrate OSCs fabricated on flexible substrates onto textiles, and the other is to fabricate flexible OSCs directly on conductive textiles. Also discussed are the challenges and prospects for wearing textile-shaped OSCs in the future.
2. Flexible transparent electrodes applied to OSCs
The following characteristics are required for flexible transparent electrodes for flexible OSCs: great transparency to allow light to travel through and be absorbed by the organic active layer, high conductivity to lower the device's resistance, an appropriate work function to ensure effective charge extraction, low surface roughness to prevent leakage, and excellent mechanical flexibility to maintain performance after being bent and bent repeatedly. Furthermore, flexible transparent electrodes with high chemical stability and a low-cost preparation process are required to produce long-term stable and cost-effective OSCs. Over the past nearly two decades, various FTEs have been developed and used for flexible OSCs, including transparent conductive oxides,28 transparent conductive polymers,29 transparent carbon nanomaterials,30,31 and metal-based transparent materials.27,32 Each of the four materials is described in this section, as well as their hybrid materials.
In addition, it should be pointed out that a transparent plastic substrate is also an important part of a flexible transparent electrode. The more commonly used are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films, polyethylene naphthalate (PEN) films, polyethersulfone (PES) films, colorless polyimide (CPI), and so on. Their properties are explained when giving specific application examples, as special manufacturing processes are required to incorporate the transparent electrodes they make.
2.1 Transparent conductive oxide
Materials made of transparent conductive oxide (TCO) in the past included tin-doped indium oxide (ITO), fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO), zinc-doped indium oxide (IZO), aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO), tungsten-doped indium oxide (IWO), etc.33,34 ITO films are now the most commonly used transparent electrodes due to their low thin-layer resistance, high light transmission, suitable work function and low-temperature manufacturing process.35 However, the most expensive component in OSCs is ITO, which prevents mass manufacturing because of the lack of indium and the high cost of vacuum deposition methods including sputtering, evaporation, and electroplating.36,37 In addition, the high surface roughness of ITO films can lead to current leakage and poor flexibility.38 The complexity of the manufacturing process is not suitable for large-scale roll-to-roll production processes.39 The most important factor that makes ITO far from ideal for flexible OSC applications is its lack of flexibility due to its ceramic nature.40 In 2008, the mechanical stability of ITO-based OSCs was examined by Na et al.41 They discovered that the effectiveness of the OSCs dropped by 40% after five consecutive bending cycles with an 8 mm radius, and nearly disappeared after an additional 75 bending cycles. They demonstrated that the development and growth of ITO fractures were the primary causes of the device's performance loss. This resulted in a significantly higher thin-layer resistance of ITO and, in turn, a significantly higher series resistance of the device. The top metal electrode and the photosensitive layer, which are both in the upper layer and may likewise experience cracks as a result of ITO cracks, are also mentioned. This finding was supported by Savagatrup et al.42
The mechanical properties of ITO films can be slightly improved by controlling the proportion of indium or doping with other elements.44 In 2012, Sio et al.45 reported aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) as a transparent electrode. High transmittance (85%) was achieved by optimizing the thickness of the AZO layer while maintaining a low Rsh (20 Ω sq−1). Kevin et al.46 developed Ga-doped ZnO (ZnO:Ga) transparent electrodes with low sheet resistance (15 Ω sq−1) and high transmittance (85%) using a similar doping method. In 2014, Zhou et al.28 used pulsed laser deposition at room temperature to create amorphous Zn0.3In1.4Sn0.3O3 (a-ZITO) by replacing 30% of the In in ITO with Zn and Sn. On polyester substrates that are accessible in stores, this a-ZITO may be grown to create flexible, transparent electrodes (Fig. 1a), fulfilling the criteria for mechanical flexibility (2.5 mm bending radius), sheet resistance (replaced with Rsh in the following) (20 Ω sq−1), and transmittance (>80%). After 10 bending cycles with a radius of 5 mm, a flexible OSC with an active layer of PTB7:PC71BM maintains 85% of the original PCE (6.42%). Other TCO electrodes have also been investigated for flexible OSC applications. In 2013, Kim et al.47 fabricated transparent In–Si–O (ISO) electrodes by depositing Si-doped In2O3 on colorless polyimide (CPI) substrates. The ISO films showed great flexibility after 1000 bending cycles. They also displayed 51.91 Ω sq−1 of sheet resistance and 81.51% of transmittance. The flexible device with an ISO-based architecture and P3HT:PCBM has a PCE of 2.78%. Compared to traditional ITO, these metal oxides have better mechanical characteristics, but they are still insufficient for use in flexible electronics.

Laminating ITO onto flexible substrate films is also a viable way to enhance its mechanical properties. For deposition on polymer substrates, common techniques include lamination of premade ITO films transferred to polymer substrates or direct current or radio frequency magnetron sputtering processes.1,48 In 2009, Kim et al.49 used a roll-to-roll sputtering process to deposit ITO on a PET substrate to obtain a flexible transparent electrode with a sheet resistance of 47.4 Ω sq−1 and transmittance of 83.46% at 500–550 nm. The PCE of a flexible OSC fabricated with P3HT:PCBM on this substrate was 1.88%. Additionally, PET substrates treated with Ar ions may significantly increase their mechanical flexibility. In 2015, Kim et al.19 proposed the transfer method and laminated ITO on a CPI substrate (Fig. 1b) to obtain CPI/ITO electrodes exhibiting a Rsh of 25.65 Ω sq−1 and transmittance of 83.8%. The PCE of a flexible OSC fabricated on this substrate with P3HT:PCBM and P3HT:ICBA as the active layers was 3.08% and 5.04%, respectively. In addition, the addition of a modification layer to the polymer/ITO substrate plays an important role in improving efficiency. Zhao et al.50 used poly [(9,9-bis(3′-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl)-2,7-fluorene)-alt-2,7-(9,9-dioctylfluorene)] (PFN) to coat the PET/ITO electrode to reduce the root mean square (RMS) roughness from 7.04 nm to 3.67 nm on a 5 μm × 5 μm surface, resulting in a smoother surface morphology that can effectively avoid electrical short circuits during device bending. In 2019, Xiong et al.43 introduced polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE, Fig. 1c) as an interfacial layer between PET/ITO and the photoactive layer, and used a strategy to blunt the chemical interaction between PEIE and NF receptors by increasing PEIE protonation. The OSC of PET/ITO/PEIE/PCE-10:IEICO-4F/MoO3/Ag exhibited 12.5% PCE. The initial efficiency of 90% was maintained after 2000 cycles of bending tests with a radius of 5 mm. Table 1 lists some of the parameters of the OSCs using TCO/flexible substrate composite transparent electrodes. In summary, improved flexibility and stability are important for TCO applications in flexible OSCs.

2.2 Transparent conductive polymer
Transparent conducting polymer (TCP) films are considered another promising option for FTEs. Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, see Fig. 2a for structure) is the most promising alternative to conventional ITO among conducting polymers as a flexible transparent electrode material in optoelectronic devices due to its high transparency in the visible region; high earth abundance of the basic elements; excellent flexibility; adjustable work function (Φ) (4.8–5.4 eV);53 low surface roughness; solution processable nature, suitability for roll to roll production processes.54

Conjugated positively charged conductive PEDOT and negatively charged insulating PSS make up the polymer electrolyte PEDOT:PSS. While the insulating PSS makes it easier for PEDOT to disperse in water, PEDOT is a highly conductive material that is insoluble in water. Initially, PEDOT:PSS was mostly applied as a hole transport layer in OSCs (e.g. Clevios PVP AI 4083 with a PEDOT to PSS ratio of 1:6) as a new conductive polymer. Because of the relatively low conductivity of its intrinsic state, it is not suitable for application to electrodes.56 However, due to its unique advantages, how to improve its conductivity and apply it to transparent electrodes has also attracted the consideration of researchers. In 2002, Zhang et al.57 significantly reduced the Rsh of PEDOT:PSS electrodes using glycerol and sorbitol treatment in an attempt to use it as a transparent electrode for OSCs. In 2005, Bradley et al.58 systematically explored the effects of thermal annealing, doping, and post-treatment on the physical characteristics of PEDOT:PSS films. In 2014, Kim et al.29 reported that a concentrated H2SO4 treatment successfully raised the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS to 4380 S cm−1. The ability of concentrated H2SO4 to cause a significant structural rearrangement of PEDOT, followed by the creation of crystalline nanofibers, was used to explain this. The obtained films have a Rsh of 46.1 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 90% at 550 nm. In 2020, Wan et al.59 doped PEDOT:PSS by spraying HClO4 with a Rsh of 29.4 Ω sq−1 and transmittance of 90.4% at 550 nm. This also induces an energy level tuning effect by polarizing the PEDOT molecule, leading to a work function of up to 5.39 eV. The device with the structure of PET/HClO4 doped PH1000/PVP Al4083/PM6:Y6/PDINN/Ag exhibits an average PCE of 16.44%. However, the strong oxidation properties of concentrated H2SO4 and HClO4 make it impossible to prepare flexible transparent electrodes directly on plastic substrates, although Kim et al.54 proposed a transfer printing method to transfer electrodes fabricated under harsh conditions such as concentrated H2SO4 to PEN plastic substrates (Fig. 2b). PEN has a similar chemical structure to PET, except that PEN in the molecular chain is replaced by a more rigid naphthalene ring instead of the benzene ring in PET. The naphthalene ring structure makes PEN have higher physical and mechanical properties, gas barrier properties, chemical stability, heat resistance, ultraviolet resistance and radiation resistance than PET. However, transfer printing requires rather complicated handling, facing the huge challenge of needing to precisely control the interfacial adhesion and the impact of low yields. An alternative route is to use a milder acid to avoid damage to the substrate. In 2011, Ouyang et al.60 coated PEDOT:PSS films with methanol and methane sulfonic acid to create flexible transparent electrodes with 3560 S cm−1 and 43 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 89.5% on PET. With a PCE of 3.92%, the flexible OSCs based on P3HT:PCBM maintain roughly 80% of their starting value after 100 cycles of significant amplitude bending. In 2015, Meng et al.61 treated PEDOT:PSS films with phosphoric acid (H3PO4) to increase the conductivity to 1460 S cm−1. In 2018, Ge et al.62 proposed a simple way to optimize PEDOT:PSS films using methane sulfonic acid treatment at room temperature, and the resulting electrodes exhibited a high conductivity of 2860 S cm−1 and 90% transmittance at 420–900 nm. To increase the conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS film, Fan et al.63 subjected it to several immersion treatments with methane sulfonic acid or phosphoric acid. The RMS of the film's flat surface is 2.14 nm. In addition, the work function (−4.91 eV) of this film matches well with that of the PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PVP AI4083) buffer layer (−5.05 eV). It is very favorable for cavity transport and extraction. Transfer and printing of films from glass substrates onto polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates were performed.
The treatment with neutral chemicals and simple techniques is more suitable for the fabrication of flexible OSCs than acid treatment and complex film transfer methods. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated PEDOT:PSS (in this case it refers to PH500) sheets coated on PET were employed as electrodes for flexible OSCs by Na et al. in 2008.41 They demonstrated that the conductivity, morphology, surface composition, and work function (Φ) of PEDOT:PSS films could be efficiently controlled by adding DMSO to the aqueous PEDOT:PSS solution. In 2012, Chu et al.64 demonstrated that the conductivity of monolayer PEDOT:PSS films increased from 0.3 to 1362 S cm−1 using a simple method of methanol treatment while maintaining 85% transmittance. The OSC with P3HT:PCBM exhibited a PCE of 3.27%. Bao et al.65 improved the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS (PH1000) films by binary additive treatment with DMSO and fluorinated surfactant Zonyl-FS300, which enabled the conductive polymer films to be easily deposited on various flexible substrates. Flexible OSCs with P3HT:PCBM exhibit photovoltaic performance comparable to that of devices based on ITO electrodes. In 2020, Song et al.55 prepared flexible PEDOT:PSS electrodes by two steps of polyhydroxy compound xylitol doping and acid treatment. The flexible OSC based on the PM6:Y6 active layer showed an efficiency of up to 14.20%. The treated PEDOT:PSS films generated intermolecular forces with the underlying PET plastic substrate, mainly due to the presence of the xylitol component in the films. The intermolecular forces are hydrogen and van der Waals bonds, mainly generated by the interaction between the hydroxylated surface of the xylitol component in D-PEDOT:PSS and the carbonyl group of the PET substrate (Fig. 2c). The presence of hydrogen and van der Waals bonds at the interface provides strong adhesion between the electrode and the substrate, which is advantageous for bending and folding applications of flexible OSCs. This OSC also shows good mechanical stability after bending and folding, maintaining more than 80% of the initial PCE after 1000 folding cycles. In addition, Li et al.66 found that after modification with polyetherimide (PEI), dipoles were formed on the surface of PEDOT:PSS electrodes, which reduced their work function from 5.06 eV to 4.08 eV, making them more suitable for electron harvesting. Table 2 provides the properties of the PEDOT:PSS films after finishing with different reagents and the parameters of the composed OSCs.

The performance of transparent conductive polymers PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH500, PH510 and PH1000, with a PEDOT to PSS ratio of 1:2.5) has demonstrated their potential for application as transparent electrodes in flexible OSCs. The significant advantages of PEDOT:PSS-based transparent electrodes are their solution-processability and mechanical flexibility. However, because of the electrical instability of PEDOT:PSS when exposed to humidity, UV and high temperature conditions may limit their further application in OSCs.
2.3 Carbon nanomaterials
The abundance of elemental carbon in carbon nanomaterials (such as carbon nanotubes and graphene) makes them potential replacements for ITO electrodes in OSCs. They also have good intrinsic electrical properties, outstanding chemical and environmental robustness, and extreme flexibility, and are simple to process as solutions at room temperature. Transparent carbon nanomaterials have excellent optical and electrical properties and exhibit excellent performance in OSCs. A summary of representative recent reports on flexible OSCs using transparent carbon nanomaterial electrodes is provided in Table 3.

2.3.1 Carbon nanotubes. 
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) consist mainly of single- or multi-layered circular tube-shaped nanostructures of hexagonally oriented carbon atoms,78 as shown in Fig. 3. The charge transfer capacity of carbon nanotubes depends on their length, diameter, ratio of the metal to semiconductor carbon nanotubes (M/S ratio), synthesis method and purity.79 Although CNTs may be effective electrical conductors on their own, CNT networks often have conductivity values that are less than 4% of their intrinsic conductivity.80 The high contact resistance between individual CNTs is often to blame for this.81 The density of the nanotubes must be higher than the cutoff for the formation of a conductive permeation network in order for CNT thin films to be suitable for BTE applications. Higher density CNT thin films will result in reduced permeability while simultaneously having lower thin layer resistance. Typically, CNT-based electrodes exhibit relatively high surface resistance even at 85% transparency in the visible region, resulting in a relatively low PCE.82 In 2005, Chhowalla et al.83 reported the application of SWCNTs as FTEs in OSCs with a PCE of 0.99%. In 2006, Grüner et al.68 transferred a more transparent and highly conductive SWCNT film to a PET substrate to fabricate a FTE showing a transmittance of 85% and Rsh of 200 Ω sq−1, based on a P3HT:PCBM based flexible OSC exhibiting 2.5% PCE. In the same year, Kymakis et al.84 spin-coated SWCNTs to produce transparent electrodes, demonstrating a PCE of 1.2%. The efficiency is low, but the spin-coating method used has the great advantage of low cost processability and large size applicability. In 2010, Kim et al.85 also reported OSCs based on solution-treated SWCNT transparent electrodes (Fig. 3b), which exhibited a 2.3% PCE. In 2011, Hersam et al.86 dip-coated aqueous SWCNT solution containing a surfactant and then immersed it in HNO3 to remove the residue and minimize the roughness of the SWCNT films. In addition, they compared the CNT compositions of different compositions and concluded that SWCNTs with a 100% metallic nature are the best choice for transparent electrodes in OSCs. In 2015, Matsuo et al.69 used MoOx-doped (x being between 2 and 3) CNT films as transparent electrodes and further enhanced their performance by overcoating them with PEDOT:PSS. The OSCs on a glass substrate showed 6.04% PCE, slightly lower than 7.48% for an ITO-based device. The devices based on PET and PEI substrates showed 3.9% and 3.4% PCE, respectively, and were able to withstand several cycles of bending tests. In 2018, Jeon et al.87 used high molecular weight polymeric (Nafion®)doped carbon nanotube transparent films to obtain a square resistance of 75 Ω sq−1 and a light transmittance of 80% (λ = 550 nm). The device with PBTZT-stat-BDTT-8:PC71BM exhibits 8.0% PCE. However, the process is performed on a glass substrate, and its suitability for flexible substrates still needs to be verified. Future research directions need to significantly reduce the thin layer resistance and surface roughness of CNTs while maintaining high optical transparency.

2.3.2 Graphene. 
Transparent electrodes made of graphene are compatible with OSCs depending on their surface characteristics, work function, and electrical conductivity. Large hole injection barriers exist between graphene and the active layer material because pristine graphene produced by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) has a much lower conductivity than ITO and a work function that is incompatible with the highest occupied molecular orbital (5.0 eV) of many donor materials.81 Therefore, p-type doping in graphene is necessary for the application of graphene as a transparent anode. In addition, direct coating of organic films on graphene is not easy due to its hydrophobic surface.
Graphene fabrication for FTEs typically involves two steps: synthesis of graphene on a substrate (such as Si, Cu), followed by transfer of the synthesized graphene to the target substrate using a support film such as polyimide. In 2008, Wang et al.88 applied transparent graphene films (TGFs) to OSCs with Ag/P3HT:PCBM/TGF/Glass, but only yielded 0.29% PCE, which is lower than the 1.17% of the ITO structure. This is attributed to the high Rsh (18 kΩ sq−1) of the prepared TGF. In 2009, Wang et al.89 used pyrene butyrate succinimide ester (PBASE) to non-covalently modify layer less CVD graphene through π–π interactions to improve the work function. As PBASE's aromatic ring has a high affinity for electrons, it can pull electrons from graphene to induce p-type doping. With a work function set between 4.2 and 4.7 eV, near to the HOMO energy level of PEDOT, the modified graphene sheet permits effective hole collection. Additionally, graphene's hydrophilicity has improved. Compared to that of the device based on unmodified graphene (0.21%), the PCE of the OSC with graphene/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al increased to 1.71%. In order to create a homogeneous PEDOT:PSS coating, in 2010, Park et al.90 discovered that depositing AuCl3 on layer-less graphene might increase electrical conductivity, modify the work function, and affect the surface wetting qualities. Following AuCl3 doping, the PCE of OSCs with graphene/PEDOT:PSS/CuPc/C60/BCP/Ag rose from 0.57% to 1.63%. In order to increase the electrical conductivity of the individual graphene layers, in 2011, Wang et al.91 developed multilayer graphene films by transferring them layer by layer. The four-layer HCl-doped graphene sheets had a suitable Rsh of 80 Ω sq−1 and a good transmittance of 90%. A MoO3 sheet with a thickness of ∼2 nm was then vaporized on the graphene layer to adjust its power function and hydrophilicity. Both the increase in the power function from 4.36 eV to 5.47 eV and the homogeneous deposition of PEDOT:PSS on graphene are advantageous for transport from holes. The OSC with graphene/MoO3/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/LiF/Al exhibited a PCE of 2.5%. After being applied on glass substrates, many researchers are trying to transfer TGFs to flexible substrates to prepare flexible OSCs. In 2010, Gomez et al.71 fabricated flexible OSCs with a PCE of around 1.18% by synthesizing CVD graphene and transferring it to a flexible PET substrate. After hundreds of bending cycles, the conductivity of the flexible graphene electrodes was likewise very stable. The performance of the flexible devices is unaffected by extreme bending angles of up to 138°. In 2012, Lee et al.92 applied multilayer graphene to PET and doped graphene with HNO3 and SOCl to produce flexible OSCs with a PCE of around 2.5%. The transfer process inevitably leads to contamination of the graphene surface, which is detrimental to the maintenance of its excellent properties.93,94 In addition, under sustained mechanical stress, the weaker van der Waals contacts between graphene and the substrate fail to maintain close contact, resulting in the detachment of graphene films from the substrate.95 Several ways have been suggested to address these issues, including the use of dry transfer methods to generate cleaner surfaces and the insertion of extra interlayers to enhance adhesion between graphene and the substrate.96,97 In 2020, Koo et al.24 reported a different method to integrate colorless polyimide (CPI) with dual functionalities directly on CVD-grown graphene, which is schematically shown in Fig. 3c. In this scenario, PI serves as both an electrode substrate and a graphene carrier sheet. Due to its exceptional thermal durability over 400 °C, the CPI created by the acylation process of polyamide acid (PAA) also resists damage during high-temperature annealing.98 CPI/graphene has a highly clean surface which improves the firmness of the substrate. Consequently, the three-layer stacked graphene electrodes produced on flexible CPI substrates showed a low Rsh of 83 Ω sq−1 and remarkable mechanical endurance up to 104 bending cycles. In addition to its excellent light transmission of more than 92%, the flexible OSC has a PCE of 15.2%. Therefore, the key to the application of graphene to high-performance transparent electrodes is to obtain a clean, breakage-free and residue-free graphene layer.


2.3.3 Reduced graphene oxide. 
Due to its cheap cost and simplicity of production, solution-processable reduced graphene oxide (rGO) has also been tried to make transparent electrodes for OSCs.88 Conductive rGO films may be formed by dip-coating, spin-coating, or even scratch-coating processes. There are several efficient methods for enhancing the dispersion and electrical properties of rGO films, including chemical doping and combining with other conductive materials. In 2008, Wu et al.99 prepared rGO transparent conductive films with 85–95% transmittance by hydrazine reduction and thermal annealing processes and used the rGO films as anodes for OSCs with the structure of rGO/CuPc/C60/BCP/Ag. However, the PCE is only about 0.4%, which is much lower than that of ITO-based OSCs, due to the Rsh of rGO films being up to 100–500 kΩ sq−1. To improve the electrical properties of rGO films, in 2009, Su et al.100 modified the rGO surface using pyrene-1-sulfonic acid sodium salt (PyS) and 3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic acid diimide bis (benzenesulfonic acid) as an electron donor and acceptor, respectively. The electrical conductivity of the modified rGO was about one hundred percent greater than that of the unmodified rGO. Then, using glass substrates, OSCs with a PCE of 1.12% were fabricated. In 2010, Yin et al.77 produced rGO films on PET substrates by spin coating, and employed them as transparent electrodes in flexible OSCs with rGO/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/TiO2/Al (Fig. 3d). Since the conductivity and transparency of the rGO film are not ideal (1.6 kΩ sq−1 and 55%, 3.2 kΩ sq−1 and 65%), the PCEs of the devices are only 0.78% and 0.77%, which are much less than those of usual OSCs with ITO electrodes. In 2013, Kymakis et al.76 prepared OSCs with similar device structures on flexible substrates and showed a maximum PCE of 1.1%. However, the poor conductivity of graphene oxide film limits its application to transparent electrodes.
Carbon nanomaterials have better stability and flexibility than ITO, but transparent electrodes based on carbon nanomaterials usually exhibit lower electrical performance. This is due to the high resistance of carbon nanomaterials and the rougher films formed. Proper doping will improve this problem. Also, the adhesion of carbon nanomaterial films to the substrate needs to be further improved, for example, by adopting a mosaic and adhesion strategy.

2.4 Metallic nanostructures
Transparent conductive electrodes made of conductive polymers and carbon nanomaterials have obvious advantages in terms of process cost, mechanical flexibility and roll-to-roll fabrication potential, but still suffer from the disadvantage of poor electrical conductivity. Despite the fact that several modification procedures have been used to enhance their electrical characteristics, their conductivity is still generally inferior to that of metallic electrodes.102–104 Metal nanostructures such as ultrathin metal films, nanowires, and meshes are also strong candidates for flexible transparent electrodes in OSCs considering their excellent conductivity, adjustable transmittance, and engineering flexibility.105,106 A summary of representative recent reports on flexible OSCs using transparent metal electrodes is provided in Table 4.

2.4.1 Ultrathin metal films. 
Metallic films exhibit good electrical conductivity and mechanical flexibility. When the thickness of the metal film is in the range of ten to tens of nanometers, it allows incident light to flow through, so it can maintain the electrical conductivity while having good optical transparency, at which time it becomes suitable for use as a TE in photovoltaic devices.103 In ultrathin metal films, silver and copper are the most often utilized materials for flexible transparent electrodes. Physical vapor deposition processes are often employed to produce ultrathin metal films that are uniform and continuous. The ultrathin metal films obtained by PVD follow the Volmer–Weber pattern, which is an island growth pattern.117 Metal atoms on a non-wettable substrate initially aggregate into isolated metal clusters/islands, and when the thickness reaches a critical value (defined as the percolation threshold), the metal islands interconnect and form a continuous metal film, creating an electrical pathway in the longitudinal plane.118,119 In general, the resistivity decays exponentially with increasing thickness when the thickness is within the permeation threshold. After the thickness reaches the permeation threshold, the resistivity decays linearly with increasing thickness if it is below the electron mean free range. That is, further deposition of the metal at the permeation threshold is required to significantly reduce the thin layer resistance. However, the increase in thickness provides a greater opportunity for photons to interact with the free electrons in the metal, and therefore the optical transmittance decreases sharply. In addition, a rough surface leads to a further increase in light scattering.120 Especially when depositing metal films on plastic substrates, the evaporated metal droplets migrate and aggregate with higher disorder. For example, Ag films were deposited by thermal evaporation on PEN films by Yambem et al.108 The maximum value of transmittance was 64% at a thickness of about 19–23 nm and a Rsh of 3–13.6 Ω sq−1. An OSC device with the structure of PEN/Ag/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/Al was assembled and the PCE was only 2.3%. Therefore, lowering the permeation threshold and reducing film roughness are key to obtaining ultrathin metal films with both high light transmission and high electrical conductivity. Researchers proposed two strategies: the addition of metal nucleation inducers (MNIs) between the substrate and the metal film and the co-deposition of a small amount of other metals by doping.
Prior to PVD of the metal films, nucleation inducers are placed on the substrate surface. These inducers provide a compact nucleation point for metal deposition and prevent the formation of huge metal islands during PVD. The induced materials include metals,121–123 dielectrics,124–126 polymers,127–129 and organic monomolecular layers.130–132 The ability to scale up UMEs via high-throughput roll-to-roll processing without the use of vapor deposition or annealing techniques makes polymers and organic monomolecular MNIs among these particularly advantageous for the creation of large-area flexible films. For example, in 2020, Kim et al.107 pre-coated polyethyleneimine (PEI) on a PEN substrate and then thermally evaporated the deposited Ag film. The amine functional group in the PEI chain supplied the deposited silver atoms with an unshared electron pair, hence preventing the formation of silver islands. As a consequence, the silver atoms placed on PEI create a uniformly dense coating of about 9 nm in thickness. The electrodes exhibit excellent performance, including a transmittance of >80% at 550 nm and a Rsh of 10 Ω sq−1. In 2017, Jeong et al.128 demonstrated that the interaction of MNI coated on the PEN substrate with the evaporating metal influenced the formation of silver films, and demonstrated that polymers with –NH3 groups facilitated the formation of electrodes with better performance (Fig. 4a). Doping is achieved by co-deposition of a few dopants and metals in the PVD process. For example, Guo et al.124 doped a small amount of aluminum (10% of the total mass of Ag and Al) into Ag by a co-sputtering process, which suppressed the island formation of Ag. This decreased the threshold for silver penetration from 20 nm to 6 nm. Aluminum-doped silver films with a thickness of 7 nm exhibited a Rsh of 28 Ω sq−1 and light transmittance of 80% (550 nm). The mechanical flexibility and endurance of the films placed on PET substrates were better than those of ITO films. In addition, the surface morphology of the aluminum-doped silver film is smooth (RMS < 1 nm). Aluminum and silver have the same atomic radius and crystal structure (1.44 Å for silver and 1.40 Å for aluminum) (face-centered cubic). Therefore, the addition of minute quantities of aluminum to silver films has no appreciable effect on their electrical and optical characteristics. Excessive aluminum doping produces film flaws that may result in optical losses. Guo's team133 also reported the use of the same co-deposition method (Fig. 4b) to obtain 7 nm thick Cu-doped Ag films, exhibiting a Rsh of 12.33 Ω sq−1 and a transmittance of 80.74% in the visible area. A combination of doping and crystal seeding strategies can further lower the permeation threshold. Zhao et al.124 first deposited 10 nm-thick Ta2O5 on a PET substrate and then co-deposited aluminum-doped silver films, resulting in a continuous and smooth film (4 nm thin and 0.76 nm of RMS). The OSC with Ta2O5/aluminum-doped silver electrodes and PBDTTT-CT:PCBM showed a PCE of more than 7%, which is similar to that of the ITO-based device, but has a much superior bending capability to the ITO-based device.

Another crucial problem with ultra-thin metal films is exposure to the atmosphere, exposure to other chemicals, and instability under electrical or thermal strain.135 In response to this problem, oxide/metal/oxide (OMO) structures, which are multilayer structures consisting of two transparent oxide films and an ultra-thin metal film in between, were developed. The oxide can act as a chemical barrier to avoid deterioration of the metal layer by contact with the environment and the photosensitive layer. The oxide layer connected to the substrate also serves as a crystal seed layer to induce continuous growth of the metal film. The oxide layer attached to the photosensitive layer can be used as a hole or electron transport layer by adjusting the work function through selection or doping.136 Wide band gap oxide materials are available in a wide range of options and have excellent compatibility with different materials.137 In 2016, Maniyara et al.137 designed a transparent OMO electrode consisting of a TiO2 base coating and an ultrathin Ag- and Al-doped ZnO outer coating with both low sheet resistance (5.75 Ω sq−1) and high transmittance (98%). In 2018, Zhao et al.27 designed transparent electrodes with structures of ZnO/Ag/ZnO and ZnO/Ag/Ge/ZnO and used them for OSCs on flexible polymer substrates. In 2020, Ji et al.134 designed and optimized a ZnO/Cu-doped Ag/Al2O3 multilayer structure on a PET substrate (Fig. 4c) and even obtained a higher transmittance (88.4%) than the PET substrate (88.1%). Technologically, OMO electrodes may be manufactured at low temperatures and hence on polymer substrates, allowing the roll-to-roll method to be used.138 Oxide layers may already be manufactured utilizing sophisticated but inexpensive chemical processes, such as atmospheric pressure space atomic layer deposition (AP-SALD).139 However, the fabrication of ultrathin metal films still relies on sputtering techniques. Thus, the challenge for ultrathin metal films for flexible transparent electrode applications is to develop new techniques for deposition to reduce costs, and the method must be able to function at low temperatures, atmospheric atmospheres, and high yields.


2.4.2 Metal nanowires. 
Metal nanowire (MNW)-based transparent electrodes are composed of randomly oriented and linked MNWs placed on a substrate, which may be glass, polymers, or textiles.140 MNWs have a high aspect ratio (nanoscale diameter and unlimited length). Several types of MNWs, such as Ag, Cu, Au, and Ni NWs, have been reported for the fabrication of FTEs in OSCs.141 Silver nanowires (Ag NWs) have garnered the greatest scientific interest owing to their excellent photovoltaic characteristics and affordable cost.112,142 And, the strong haze created by Ag NWs' light scattering enhances solar cell light collection.143,144 MNWs are primarily synthesized using polyol processes, but other methods (e.g., hydrothermal synthesis and template techniques) may also be preferred.145–147 MNWs may be readily deposited using typical solution-based techniques for film production (e.g., spin coating,148 spraying,149 scraping and slit coating150), which are suitable for roll-to-roll production techniques, and facilitate the realization of flexible substrates on large scale manufacturing processes.
There are two key issues to be addressed for the optimization of the optical and electrical properties of MNW films. The first is the trade-off between light transmission and electrical conductivity. Improving the dispersion of the MNW suspension can effectively lower the permeation threshold of the film. In 2019, Sun et al.113 obtained homogeneous Ag NW suspensions using a poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSSNa) dispersion, which relies on electrostatic charge repulsion between Ag NWs adsorbed with PSS− anions. The obtained transparent electrodes exhibited a thin layer resistance of 10 Ω sq−1 and a light transmission of about 92%. Different kinds of donors and acceptors were tested, and their performance was equivalent to that of systems based on commercially available rigid electrodes. The second issue is reducing the inter-wire resistance. The majority of the Rsh of MNW films is caused by the contact resistance between silver wires.151 This can be attributed to the non-effective contact between the MNWs and the residual impurities at the contact points, similar to the CNT films. However, MNWs can increase the metal contact area between nanowires by thermal annealing, mechanical pressing, plasma welding, or photo-irradiation sintering (Fig. 5a–d), thus reducing the contact resistance.152–155 When applying flexible OSCs, it is necessary to choose methods that do not adversely affect the polymer or textile substrates. In 2015, Lu et al.156 proposed a simple alcohol-based solution method for soldering close silver nanowires by growing silver “solder” at the junction of the nanowires to form silver nanonetwork FTEs with raised conductivity for use in flexible organic solar cells. In 2017, Liu et al.157 achieved capillary force-induced soldering by applying moisture to Ag NW films, and Fig. 5e shows a schematic of the experimental process of moisture treatment. As the moisture evaporates to a certain level during drying, bent-moon shaped capillary bridges are formed between the nanowires, creating an attractive force to connect the separated nanowires (Fig. 5f).

The effective integration of flexible electrodes in OSCs depends not only on their inherent transparency and conductivity, but also on surface smoothness, adhesion to the substrate, and stability. MNW films with their own roughness are prone to short circuiting through the functional layer in very thin OSCs.158 MNWs have low adhesion to polymer substrates and peel off easily during bending.159 The large surface area of MNWs makes them susceptible to chemical, thermal, and electrical influences.160 Mechanical pressing can reduce the surface roughness of MNWs. Surface treatment of substrates can significantly improve the adhesion of MNW electrodes. For example, Akter161 demonstrated that coating PDMS with polydopamine improved the adhesion of Ag NWs to PDMS (Fig. 5g). In addition, the composite of MNWs with other materials is an effective way to improve these problems.


2.4.3 Metal meshes. 
Unlike randomly arranged MNWs, metal meshes and nets have clear geometric patterns that can be accurately controlled throughout the production process. The transmittance of a metallic mesh may be estimated by the percentage of space between the metal wires and is readily modifiable by adjusting the grid's geometric characteristics (e.g., wire width w and spacing p). Also, the metallic grid conductivity is related to the height (h) of the metal lines (Fig. 6a). Thus, the transparency-conductivity trade-off of metal meshes can be directly controlled by their geometrical parameters.135 Grids made of various metals (including Ag,163 Cu,164 Au,165 Pt166 or Ni,167 as well as mixed materials) have been developed for the fabrication of FTEs. Due to their low cost, silver and copper are the most commonly utilized metals. A variety of methods (e.g., embossing,168 photolithography,164,169 laser patterning/sintering,170,171 or printing172) have been investigated to produce transparent electrodes based on metal grids on rigid or flexible substrates. The manufacturing process largely affects the aspect ratio of the metal grid and thus the optoelectronic properties. In 2013, Yu et al.173 developed a process that combines roll-to-roll thermal embossing with the scraper method to create embedded Ag mesh with a roughness of approximately 20 nm. This technology produces a silver mesh TE with 80.35% transmittance and a thin layer resistance of 6.85 Ω sq−1. Moreover, it uses water-based nano-silver paste like traditional printing methods, which is fully compatible with the roll-to-roll process. In 2015, Song et al.26 used nanoimprint lithography and transfer printing to fabricate Ag mesh electrodes with a transmittance of 88% and Rsh of 15 Ω sq−1 on a flexible substrate without an intermediate polymer. The PCE of the flexible inverted organic solar cell using this electrode was about 7.15%. In 2016, Khan et al.174 fabricated an embedded metal mesh transparent electrode (EMTE) with a copper grid on a cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) film by photolithography, electrodeposition, and imprint transfer processes, and Fig. 6b illustrates the fabrication process. The COC substrate was selected for its low water absorption, low surface energy, high chemical resistance, and optical transparency extending into the near-UV range. This electrode exhibits transmittance higher than 90%, a sheet resistance lower than 1 Ω sq−1, and excellent surface smoothness. In 2016, Schneider et al.165 obtained gold and silver nanogrids (width: 80 to 500 nm) by means of current body power jet printing and controlled the thickness of the mesh by overprinting times (Fig. 6c). In 2020, Zhang et al.175 used the same technique to print microscale 3D metal meshes with higher aspect ratios on polyester films using Ag nanoparticles with a Rsh of 3 Ω sq−1 and T of 96%. However, the EHD technique usually does not provide good control of the surface roughness of the metal mesh films. In addition, normal metal meshes may be manufactured according to symmetries other than rectangles, such as triangles,176 hexagons,177 and nanopore arrays.178 Lithography, stencil electrodeposition and transfer techniques can produce finely patterned and smooth metal grids, but their complex procedures and high prices make them difficult to afford in large-scale applications.

In summary, for transparent electrodes with metallic nanostructures, conductivity is an obvious advantage, but poor optical transparency limits the entry of incident light into the interior of the OSC. Ultra-thin metal films achieve the necessary transparency at the expense of some conductivity.145 The roughness of the films composed of metal nanowires needs to be dealt with. Metal grids face high processing costs. In addition, all metal-based transparent electrodes exhibit poor chemical and structural stability.

2.5 Composite transparent electrodes
The above materials have obvious defects when applied separately, such as the easy oxidation of metal nanomaterials, the low conductivity of conductive polymer films, and the low light transmittance of carbon nanomaterial films. Although various treatment methods have been developed, these defects are still difficult to completely resolve. Another possible strategy is to take a composite approach. Composite materials, by maintaining the advantages of each component's material qualities through the correlation and complementarity of each component's qualities, can make up for the shortcomings of a single component material. A summary of representative recent reports on flexible OSCs using composite transparent electrodes is provided in Table 5.

In 2013, Liu et al.179 fabricated flexible OSCs on polyimide (PI) substrates with Au NP and PEDOT:PSS doped multilayer graphene. The doping of PEDOT:PSS and Au NPs significantly reduced the Rsh of graphene (from 320 Ω sq−1 to 92 Ω sq−1). In addition, graphene exerts an encapsulation effect on the device, which can significantly improve its robustness in an air atmosphere. The OSC with the structure of PMMA/graphene:AuNPs/PEDOT:PSS/P3HT:PCBM/ZnO/Ag/PI (Fig. 7a) shows a PCE of 3.2%.The device has excellent bending stability, with a PCE decrease of only 8% after 1000 bending cycles at a bending radius of about 3 mm. In 2016, Kim et al.180 introduced PEDOT polymers into Ag-mesh on PET (process shown in Fig. 7b) to obtain a hybrid transparent electrode of Ag-mesh/PEDOT:PSS (Rsh = 10 Ω sq−1 and T = 74%). The OSC with PTB7:PCBM has 67.11% FF and the PCE reaches 6.94%, which is similar to that of a device with ITO electrodes. However, the electrode roughness of up to 19.3 nm may lead to electrical short circuits despite the availability of PEDOT:PSS film coating for smoothing the Ag grid surface. In 2018, Gaetano et al.181 integrated Ag NWs and electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EG) into solution processable transparent anodes. The addition of EG significantly reduced the thin layer resistance of Ag NWs by 83% and the roughness (RMS) from 16.4 to 4.6 nm, as shown in Fig. 7c. In addition, the EG layer maintained the Ag NW networks stable under mechanical stress and prevented their oxygen degradation. Using PTB7:PCBM as the active material, the OSC of glass and PEN substrates exhibited 6.57% and 6.18% PCE, respectively. In 2019, Zeng et al.182 doped 20% Ag NWs into PEDOT:PSS PH1000 and then spin-coated them onto a PET/Ag mesh substrate to obtain a PET/Ag mesh/PEDOT:PSS/Ag NWs composite electrode with 6 Ω sq−1 of Rsh and 86% of transmission. The OSC with PM6:IT-4F achieved a PCE of 12.07%.

Several researchers have tried to dope Ag NWs with ZnO to obtain high transmittance, good interfacial properties, and low-temperature solution processability.112,183 ZnO can fill the AgNW network and solder the junctions, resulting in a lower junction resistance of Ag NWs.184 To further improve the electrical conductivity and transmittance, junctionless Ag nanonets (Ag NNs) were dry etched.115 Later, Chen et al.185 proposed a so-called “soldering” concept to tightly bond the upper electrode to the lower substrate (shown in Fig. 7d). The device exhibited low thin-layer resistance (Rsh ≈ 18 Ω sq−1) and 95% light transmission at 550 nm. The OSC with the Em-Ag:Ag NWs:AZO-SG electrode exhibited a PCE of 15.21%, and the PCE remained at 93.7% and 90.5% of its initial value for 1200 successive outward and inward bends at a radius of 4 mm, respectively. This also indicates that the FTE has good compatibility with the active layer material.
3. Flexible opaque electrodes
Typically, organic solar cells consist of transparent electrodes and electrodes made of thermally evaporated metals. The metal electrodes serve to extract charge from adjacent functional layers and reflect light that is not absorbed by the active layer to improve efficiency. But the thermal deposition of these metals on the device surface is an expensive and complex process. Alternative materials with suitable work functions and improved charge collection would be important in low-cost flexible OSCs for wearable devices. Efforts have been made to find new materials to replace hot-deposited metal electrodes for easy machining.
3.1 Metal films
Because of their high conductivity, metal films are the most popular top electrode material in OSCs.188 Evaporation at a high temperature is the method of choice for producing the majority of metal films, including those made of silver, copper, and aluminum. Because of their uniformly thick shape, metal films can effectively come into contact with the charge transport layer. However, the thermal deposition of these metals on the functional layer surface under high vacuum is a complex and expensive process and is a major obstacle to the fabrication of OSCs in large quantities at low cost. In addition, the poor bending and stretching properties of metal films limit their application in flexible OSC devices.
3.2 Carbon materials
Carbon materials are inexpensive, chemically stable, and have excellent mechanical flexibility, making it possible to replace metal films as opaque electrodes. However, insufficient contact between carbon electrodes and adjacent functional layers results in high resistance. The soft organic active layer may be damaged if carbon films are mounted on top of OSCs using lamination methods. Current researchers usually use solvents to improve the interface between the top carbon electrode and the adjacent functional layer. However, pouring a nonpolar solvent on the carbon electrode can damage the active layer and using a polar solvent can damage the hole transport layer.188 Given these facts, Jeon et al.189 proposed a structure using a ZnO electron transport layer and a MoO3 hole transport layer so that the metal electrode is replaced by a SWCNT film, as shown schematically in Fig. 8a. This work was performed on a glass substrate, but also demonstrated the potential of carbon electrodes for applications in flexible OSCs.

(c) Semitransparent OSC using a graphene top electrode and J–V characteristics from both sides.195 Copyright 2012, American Chemical Society. 
The work function of graphene and carbon nanotubes (>4.7 eV) is higher than the LUMO level of commonly used organic acceptors, limiting the charge transport.190–192 Ali et al.193 synthesized highly aligned MWCNT sheets (Rsh = 149 Ω sq−1) by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method directly onto the surface of flexible OSCs as top electrodes. The appearance of the obtained cell is shown in Fig. 8b. The short-circuit current density of the device (7.53 mA cm−2) was 78% of that of the device with a thermally deposited silver electrode (Jsc = 9.69 mA cm−2), and the PCE decreased by 35%. Shin et al.194 deposited ZnO films on Gr/PEN substrates by the mist pyrolysis CVD method at 160 °C. The flexible OSC with a Gr/ZnO electrode and P3HT:PCBM active layer exhibited 1.55% PCE. Park et al.186 found that without the assistance of stabilizers or surfactants, zinc acetate dissolved in methanol may be spin-coated in a homogeneous manner on graphene to create a layer that blocks holes.
In addition, it should be noted that replacing the opaque metal top electrode with a carbon material can not only achieve good mechanical flexibility, but also achieve semitransparent cell devices. Liu et al.195 prepared semi-transparent organic solar cells with P3HT:PCBM using monolayer graphene as the top electrode and ITO as the bottom electrode. A maximum efficiency of 2.7% was observed in a device with an area of 20 mm2. Semitransparent solar cells are useful in special applications such as folding curtains, buildings and colored power clothes. However, semi-transparent solar cells are relatively inefficient because the electrical properties of the semi-transparent carbon electrode are much lower than those of the metal material, and light absorption is lower than that of standard metal-electrode equipment.
4. Fiber-shaped OSCs
Fiber-shaped OSCs have unique wearable advantages over conventional planar structures and have recently attracted increasing interest.196 In addition, compared with planar OSCs that could absorb light only from one side, fiber-shaped OSCs could potentially harvest sunlight from all directions due to their cylindrical structure. Benefiting from the development of planar OSCs based on solution treatment, fiber OSCs have achieved great progress in recent years. Fiber-shaped OSCs can be implemented with both single and dual fibers. The composition and photovoltaic parameters of OSCs in fiber shaped devices reported in the past are listed in Table 6.

4.1 Dual fibers
Dual-fiber OSCs are formed by twisting two fiber electrodes, one of which is coated with a photoactive material.207 The dual-fiber form of dye-sensitized solar cells is widely explored, but the liquid electrolyte is prone to leakage.205 OSCs use a solid active layer for better stability and safety in practical applications. However, the ineffective interface created between the electrodes in fiber form does not provide effective charge separation and transport, which is a challenge for dual-fiber OSCs.204
Fiber-shaped OSCs need to carry current over long distances, and metals have a natural advantage in this regard. Lee et al.204 coated a thin photovoltaic layer on a metal wire and used a wire coated with a silver film as a counter electrode. The two wires are twisted and both were wrapped in a transparent polymer cladding. The device structure is shown in Fig. 9a. Although the fiber-shaped device is supposed to be designed for 3D light harvesting, the photosensitive layer can be completely obscured at certain angles, thus preventing effective light absorption. By combining larger cladding layers with a high refractive index, the authors managed to increase the absorption by 18%. The efficiency values range from 2.79% to 3.27%. Metal wires are usually sensitive to chemicals and difficult to tightly twist. Chen et al.205 chose MWCNT fibers as an electrode to be twisted with titanium wires grown with a TiO2 layer and coated with an organic active layer material. Due to the high tensile strength and flexibility of CNT fibers, the two fiber electrodes can be tightly twisted and have good surface contact. The authors also analyzed the effect of the MWCNT fiber diameter and winding pitch on the device efficiency. Thicker MWCNT wires hinder the light absorption of the active layer, but finer fibers produce a larger resistance, which affects the Jsc. A shorter pitch produces an increased shading effect, which also increases the distance of charge carrier transport and the tension of the device. The long pitch is not conducive to the formation of sufficient contact between the two electrodes for charge collection. The relatively low efficiency of the P3HT/PCBM-based device with only 0.15% PCE may be attributed to the low contact efficiency of the vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube-modified Ti wires with the photoactive material. Zhang et al.206 used the same structure and enhanced the adsorption and charge transport of the photoactive material using TiO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 9b), and the device efficiency was increased to 1.78%. The textiles made from the resulting solar fibers were highly flexible and maintained an energy conversion efficiency of ≈80% after 1000 cycles of bending. Although CNT fibers are more flexible and prove to be promising fiber substrates, their electrical conductivity needs to be further improved. The formation of composite fibers is considered an effective route.208 Additional large numbers of high-performance polymers and small molecules, as well as many promising small bandgap derivatives and non-fullerene receptor alternatives, have been developed and more general approaches can be implemented to improve efficiency.209

(e) Schematic illustration of a single-fiber OSC with a graphene transparent electrode.199 Copyright 2013, The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
In addition to twisting, the contact between two fiber electrodes can also be achieved using interleaved structures on the warp and weft. Liu et al.203 chose titanium yarn with a diameter of about 100 μm and deposited ZnO, PTB7:PCBM and PEDOT:PSS by a dip-coating process to prepare modified cathode fibers. A silver-plated nylon yarn was chosen as the anode and the solar cell textile was designed by designing the interleaved structure of the cathode and anode fibers (Fig. 9d), exhibiting a PCE of about 1.6%. Holes generated in the active layer under solar irradiation were transferred to the anode fibers and electrons were transferred to the cathode fibers. This interleaved structure results in the modified cathode fibers being connected in series along the weft direction and the anode fibers in parallel along the warp direction. By weaving variable numbers of modified cathode and anode threads, the textile OSC's output voltage and current may be controlled.
4.2 Single fiber
Compared to the twisted configuration, single-fiber structured OSCs are realized by coating the active layer and transparent electrodes layer by layer on the conducting fibers. Similar to planar devices, the photoactive material can come into close contact with both electrodes, and the design in its ideal state is expected to achieve high energy conversion efficiency.
Bedeloglu et al.198 used PP fibers coated with PEDOT:PSS as the anode, followed by an active layer, and finally a translucent cathode consisting of a lithium fluoride/aluminum (LiF/Al) layer of about 10 nm, as shown in Fig. 7c. However, the device exhibited only 0.02% PCE, which was caused by the low conductivity of PEDOT:PSS and the low light transmission of the LiF/Al layer. Liu et al.199 used a single layer of graphene as the transparent electrode, and the advantages of high conductivity and excellent light transmission enabled the device to exhibit 2.53% PCE by thickness optimization and gold doping (Fig. 9e). In addition to achieving high conductivity and flexible contacts, the interface with adjacent layers was carefully treated to ensure uniform deposition. And, the work function of the electrodes needs to be adjusted in order to improve the transfer efficiency of electrons and holes. The realization of novel all-carbon-based fiber-shaped OSCs is justified given the high performance and versatility of the carbon-based materials used for fiber integration. However, instability under strain can significantly affect the efficiency of the device.42
Despite the great achievements in recent years, fiber-shaped OSCs still face many challenges. One reason why the efficiency remains much lower than that of their conventional planar format counterparts is that the resistance of the fiber electrodes increases linearly with length. Then there is the difficulty of coating thin and uniform photosensitive and electrode layers on fiber electrodes, especially on a large scale. In addition, the two fibre electrodes of a dual fibre OSC are difficult to twist together in a stable manner. The winding distance is difficult to adjust and control.
5. Fabric-shaped OSCs
Although fiber-shaped OSCs have recently been extensively studied for wearable applications, weaving fiber-shaped solar cells into textiles and even garments still faces many difficulties, such as the inherent incompatibility of the components with the textile industry's present processes and equipment, and achieving large-scale production of solar textiles using fiber solar cells is difficult. The ideal wearable OSCs should be like a piece of textile that can be integrated into a garment and even have the basic properties of regular textiles, such as stretchability and washability.210,211 Planar fabric-shaped OSCs have easier processing on a prepared textile substrate, compared to fiber-shaped OSCs. The composition and photovoltaic parameters of OSC devices in the form of fabrics reported in the past are listed in Table 7.

5.1 Conventional fabric substrate
The most intuitive demonstration of fabric-shaped OSCs (FaSOSCs) is the integration of an OSC fabricated on a rigid or flexible substrate onto a piece of textile by stitching or bonding, etc. Lee et al.219 stitched an OSC platform consisting of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCBM/MoO3 and metal electrodes to a textile substrate to form a fabric shaped OSC with a PCE of 1.8%. Xu et al.213 fabricated flexible OSCs with the structure ITO/ZnOx/PBDTTT-OFT:PCBM/PEDOT:PSS/Ag on transparent polyimide substrates with 10% PCE. The device was then adhered to a PTFE/poly(parylene) textile by means of a polyurethane melt film (Fig. 10a). It is important to note in particular that the donor polymer PBDTTT-OFT used in this work has a better thermal stability and thus does not degrade in performance during hot melt bonding at 120 °C.

(d) Illustration of the OSC manufacturing process on a woven cloth using a schematic.221 Copyright 2017, The Royal Society of Chemistry. 
To fabricate OSC devices based on conventional fabric substrates, there is another strategy to eliminate the transfer process and make OSCs directly on the fabric layer by layer. However, due to the topology, hygroscopicity, roughness of conventional fabrics, it is necessary to make them waterproof and finish them flat. Printable UV-curable resins are one of the ideal materials for flat treatment of fabrics. Arumugam et al.217 screen-printed UV-curable fabric coated commercially available polyester/cotton woven fabrics to obtain a flat surface. Then on this substrate, an electrode, a transport layer and an active layer are deposited sequentially by spraying and scraper coating, and OSCs in the form of fabrics are obtained. Seok et al.218 planarized PEN woven fabric by laminating PU/Al2O3/PVA/Al2O3 multilayers and then fabricated top-illuminated, inverted PSCs (Ag/PFN/PTB7-Th:PC71BM/MoO3/Ag/MoO3) on this fabric. Fig. 10b schematically represents the fabrication procedure. Fabric-shaped OSCs with stretchable properties can be obtained by laminating OSCs fabricated on a pre-stretch elastomer (e.g., PDMS) substrate to textiles or by laminating OSCs fabricated on an ultrathin polymer film substrate to pre-stretch elastomers.222,223 Jinno et al.212 coated both sides of fabric-shaped OSCs with elastomers, allowing them to further obtain waterproof properties.
5.2 Conductive fabric substrate
The second way is to fabricate a planar solar cell on a piece of conductive fabric substrate. Kylberg et al.211 demonstrated a polymer solar cell based on highly flexible transparent textile electrodes woven into a mesh of metals and polymer fibers. The fibers are filled with a transparent polymer and cured by UV irradiation. Depending on the composition of the solar fabric, the PCE varies from 2.2% to 3.2%. Wu et al.220 prepared an ultralight wearable polymer solar textile using a transparent conductive fabric prepared from fibers composed of PE/Ag NWs/graphene, as shown in Fig. 10c. The PCE was about 2.27% under optimal conditions. In addition, the fabric form OSC has good flexibility and the PCE decreased by about 13% and 23% after 400 curling and folding cycles, respectively. Zhen et al.221 pioneered a unique wet-transfer method to fabricate foldable polymer solar cells on fabric by the process shown in Fig. 10d. The first step was to directly deposit a silver electrode onto the fabric using the polymer-assisted metal deposition technique in chemical deposition solution. The metal film did not alter the texture of the fabric in any way.224–226 Then, a separate active layer was transferred to the woven fabric electrode in water together with the top electrode using the wet transfer method. In the end, an interfacially modified layer was created by diffusing a diluted solution of the interfacially modified material in between the woven electrode and the active layer to produce the desired results.
It should be noted that both methods have the effect of eliminating air permeability, which can have a negative impact on the comfort of the resulting textile. Fabric OSCs with excellent wearability can be achieved by designing the layout of the OSCs on the garment fabric, e.g., by spacing them out, by good packaging and by connecting the devices in series.
6. Conclusion and outlook
The past few years have witnessed the rapid development of flexible organic solar cells. In this review, we first discuss the properties of flexible transparent electrodes used in FOSCs, including TCOs, TCPs, carbon nanomaterials, metallic materials and composite materials, and the performance of related OSC devices. Then, flexible opaque electrodes including metallic thin films and opaque carbon materials are evaluated. Finally, two strategies for the application of OSCs to wearable applications are also discussed, with devices available in fiber and fabric shapes.
High quality flexible transparent electrodes should have high conductivity, transmittance, low surface roughness, excellent mechanical flexibility and long-term stability. ITO films remain the most used and efficient electrodes for advanced flexible OSCs. However, the high cost and brittleness of ITO electrodes prevent them from being used on a large scale. Conductive polymers PEDOT:PSS exhibit excellent mechanical flexibility and good transmittance properties, but have issues with complex doping treatment and poor chemical stability. Transparent electrodes constructed from carbon nanomaterials on flexible substrates have excellent mechanical properties, but are not as optically transparent or conductive as conventional ITO. Moreover, the surface smoothness of carbon- and metal-based transparent electrodes is not as good as desired. By compounding, the disadvantages exhibited by the above single components can be greatly reduced. However, flexible transparent electrodes with high electrical conductivity, high optical transparency, smooth surface and high stability still need to be further explored, which is essential for obtaining high-performance flexible OSCs. Therefore, new materials, new processes, new structures and their combinations are the future development direction of flexible electrodes. In addition, low-cost and mass-produced technologies will facilitate the integration of flexible OSCs with commercial products.
For flexible opaque or semi-transparent electrodes, metal films or foil are effective in achieving efficient flexible OSCs but have problems in long-term stability and large-scale fabrication. And pieces of metal foil are not suitable for the flexibility required by wearable OSCs. In contrast, although carbon material electrodes have excellent environmental stability and mechanical flexibility, high resistance and poor interface contact with adjacent functional layers lead to less efficient devices compared to metal electrodes. Further development of carbon-based electrodes should be directed towards improved conductivity and convenient solution handling.
Textile OSCs can be fabricated in two ways: as fiber-shaped OSCs that are interlaced together or as planar fabric-shaped OSCs that are fabricated directly on a fabric substrate. The main problems faced by fiber-shaped OSCs are the linear increase in resistance of the fiber electrodes with length and the difficulty of coating the functional layer uniformly on the fiber surface. Fabric-shaped OSCs should maintain the flexible nature of textiles while still achieving excellent efficiency. Stretchability is also important for some applications, such as sportswear. Further improvement of flexible electrodes and packing technology will facilitate the commercialization of wearable flexible OSCs.
Fiber-shaped and planar fabric-shaped OSCs represent one of the most intriguing developments in terms of technology for the subsequent generation of wearable devices, as they power smart textiles. However, the practical application of these fibrous and planar fabric-shaped OSCs is still in its infancy and requires more research and development. In the coming years, researchers will need to work closely with industry and focus their attention on security, packaging, and the development of robust textile OSCs. It is predicted that textile OSCs will open up a new avenue of wearable energy devices.
