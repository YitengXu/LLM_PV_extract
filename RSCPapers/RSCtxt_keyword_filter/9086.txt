    , Accepted 16th April 2019First published on 17th April 2019AbstractThe chalcogenide Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) solar cell is very promising because it exhibits one of the highest efficiencies among all thin-film solar cells. However, the expensive and complicated fabrication of these solar cells should be overcome for their successful commercialization. Herein, we investigated a novel fabrication technique that combined both vacuum and non-vacuum processes to minimize the production costs and increase the energy conversion efficiency. A carbon-free CuS nanoparticle precursor was used in the non-vacuum process to save Cu materials and the thermal budget. An (In,Ga)2Se3 precursor was formed via vacuum co-evaporation, which provided control over the stoichiometry. The CIGSSe films were fabricated using two different approaches: (1) CuS was deposited on a Mo film, with subsequent co-evaporation of the (In,Ga)2Se3 film (hybrid staking A – HSA) and (2) (In,Ga)2Se3 was deposited on a Mo film, and then, CuS was formed on top of this with selenization (hybrid stacking B – HSB). The HSA solar cells had a higher quality structure and composition when compared with the HSB cells. The HSA CIGSSe solar cell exhibited the superior energy conversion efficiency of 13.6%. Our novel fabrication technique will contribute to the widespread commercialization of CIGSSe solar cells while minimizing material consumption.
Introduction
Chalcogenide thin-film solar cells, such as Cu(In,Ga)Se2 (CIGSe), have gained extensive interest due to their high efficiencies among thin-film solar cells. Improved fabrication methods have resulted in record-breaking efficiencies of up to 23% of polycrystalline thin film CIGSe solar cells fabricated using a three-stage vacuum-based process.1,2 As a newcomer to the CIGSe solar cells, the Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGSSe) solar cells have attracted significant interest because of unique advantages3 of their thin films with efficiencies exceeding 22% based on the vacuum process.4 However, this method is complicated and expensive; thus, it is not suitable for commercial fabrication. Thus, a simple and low-cost process that yields cells with high efficiency is required.
To realize industrial manufacturing of CIGSSe solar cells, research on two-stage processes has received significant attention because these processes promise lower capital expenditure and simple processing when compared with three-stage process.5–14 Typically, a two-stage process is classified by a vacuum process and a non-vacuum process.8 At first, the vacuum two-stage process involves the deposition of a metal precursor using sputtering or evaporation, with subsequent selenization.9,15 This method results in the formation of devices with high efficiency since the CIGSSe films that are produced via this method are of high purity, exhibit large grain growth and have good adhesion to the Mo back contact.10 In addition, the elemental composition can be easily controlled.8 However, these vacuum processes still have the hurdle of the inherently high material cost as well as expensive vacuum equipment.15–18 On the other hand, the non-vacuum process consists of particle- and solution-based processes followed by selenization.19 It can achieve high material-efficient utilization, having the potential for cost reduction.16 Despite these advantages, the non-vacuum processes can limit the device efficiency since it can be difficult to control the elemental composition of the final layer and film contamination, especially carbon-layer contamination, originating from the solutions can occur.20
To ensure the commercial success of CIGSSe solar cells, novel two-stage fabrication methods are required to overcome the disadvantages of the abovementioned vacuum and non-vacuum processes.6,14,15,19 Previously reported hybrid methods that combine different fabrication processes, including electrodeposition–evaporation6 or sputtering–evaporation,14 are still complicated and costly.
As a differentiated strategy from the previous hybrid methods,6,14,19 herein, a new hybrid commercialization technique that takes advantage of both the non-vacuum and the vacuum processes has been proposed. Among all the elements required in the CIGSSe solar cells, Cu requires highest evaporation temperature to achieve the required stoichiometry.2 Therefore, Cu deposition via evaporation method requires large amounts of power and is wasteful of the Cu source at the same time.7,10,16,18 To overcome this issue, a carbon-free CuS nanoparticle precursor was used as a Cu source during the non-vacuum process,20 which allowed a simple spin-coating deposition when compared with the case of the high-vacuum process.16 An (In,Ga)2Se3 precursor was fabricated using vacuum co-evaporation at low temperatures. Since uniform distribution of the elemental composition and control of the Se vapors are critical for obtaining high-efficiency devices,9,10 In, Ga, and Se have been deposited by vacuum evaporation, and the energy required to evaporate Cu has been minimized.
In this study, we fabricated the CIGSSe solar cells using two different methods. The first method involved the use of a CuS nanoparticle precursor that was deposited on a Mo film, which subsequently underwent a vacuum process (hybrid staking A – HSA). The second method involved the deposition of the (In,Ga)2Se3 precursor on the Mo film; then, the CuS nanoparticle was formed on top of this, and the stack was subjected to selenization (hybrid stacking B – HSB). We investigated the structural and compositional characteristics of the CIGSSe film deposited by the new hybrid-stacking process. The CIGSSe films and the solar cells that incorporated these films were fabricated, and the performance of the resulting device was examined. This led us to propose a formation mechanism for the CIGSSe film deposition. Our novel technique allowed us to fabricate high-efficiency chalcogenide solar cells while minimizing material wastage. Moreover, this technique will help towards the commercialization of the CIGSSe solar cell industry.
Results and discussion
A schematic illustrating the fabrication of the CIGSSe solar cells is shown in Fig. 1. The non-vacuum process (spin coating of the CuS nanoparticles) and the vacuum process ((In,Ga)2Se3 co-evaporation) were performed in different orders. HSA involved the formation of an (In,Ga)2Se3/CuS/Mo stack (Fig. 1(a)), whereas HSB involved the formation of a CuS/(In,Ga)2Se3/Mo stack that was subjected to selenization (Fig. 1(b)). The HSA and HSB film fabrication techniques were based on a conventional two-stage process used to fabricate the CIGSSe solar cells. The fabrication of the HSA film involved coating of CuS on the Mo film followed by vacuum deposition of the (In,Ga)2Se3 film; this allowed the Se annealing to be performed in the same evaporation system. In contrast, the fabrication of the HSB film involved co-evaporation of the initial (In,Ga)2Se3 film onto the Mo film followed by spin-coating of the CuS nanoparticle solution, which was then subjected to a separate selenization step. We have compared the two different fabrication techniques by investigating the geometric, structural, and photovoltaic properties of the different films and solar cells fabricated using these films.
 Fig. 1  Schematic showing the fabrication of the structures (a) HSA and (b) HSB. 
The morphology of the HSA and HSB films on the Mo substrates was examined using SEM surface and cross-sectional images (Fig. 2). The images of the HSA (CuS/Mo) and HSB (CuS/(In,Ga)2Se3/Mo) films are shown in Fig. 2(a) and (c), respectively. The CuS layer in the HSA film was well-formed, as evidenced by the thin film on the Mo film (Fig. 2(a)). In contrast, the CuS layer in the HSB film formed distinct island sites on the (In,Ga)2Se3 layer (Fig. 2(c)). The images of the HSA and HSB films after undergoing the next step are shown in Fig. 2(b) and (d), respectively. The images of the HSA film showed a dense surface that contained large grains (∼1 μm) on the surface and cross-section (Fig. 2(b)), whereas the HSB film contained granular structures of varying sizes due to insufficient grain growth with thick and dense pores. Moreover, the uniformity of the HSA film in both horizontal and vertical directions was superior to that of the HSB film. Importantly, the HSA film exhibits a uniform film growth, which is an essential factor for realizing high-efficiency devices.2,3,21 However, the different-sized and porous grains in the HSB film led to the formation of an interface that limited the photo-carrier transport; this lowered the device efficiency due to a high resistance or barrier.21,22 EDS analysis of the two films (Table 1) determined the global spatial homogeneity of the metal composition ratios (CGI = [Cu]/([In] + [Ga]) and GGI = [Ga]/([In] + [Ga])). The Cu ratio of the HSA film was similar to that of the highly efficient CIGSSe solar cells.1,2,21 On the contrary, the Cu ratio of the HSB film seemed to be low; this was likely caused by poor adhesion between CuS and the surface of (In,Ga)2Se3 (Fig. 2(c)).

Structural analysis of the HSA and HSB films was performed using XRD with both a coupled scan and a 2θ scan with the initial theta value of 2° (Fig. 3). As the 2θ scan is more surface-sensitive when compared with the coupled scan, a comparison of the two scans can yield information about structural uniformity. The XRD pattern obtained from the coupled scans included a peak that corresponded to the Mo (JCPDS 42-1120) substrate at 40.44° for both the HSA and the HSB films. The sharp peaks in both the coupled and the 2θ scans originating from the HSA film clearly showed that the major orientation of the CIGSSe films was along the (112), (220/204), and (312/116) planes (JCPDS 35-1102); this indicated the formation of uniform and well-crystallized CIGSSe films via the HSA process (Fig. 3(a)). Moreover, a slightly small Cu2−xSe (JCPDS 65-2982 and 06-0680) peak was obtained for the HSA film. Conversely, the XRD patterns obtained from the coupled and 2θ scans of the HSB film showed notable differences, which were consistent with the insufficient grain growth that was observed in the SEM images (Fig. 2(c) and (d)). The XRD data obtained for the HSB film was not consistent with that of the CIGSSe phase, but was consistent with that of an (In,Ga)Se (JCPDS 34-1431) phase originating from the precursor; a range of other phases was observed in the broad peaks, which was attributed to poor crystallization or the presence of residual nanoparticles in the HSB film (i.e., In2Se3 (JCPDS 72-1470), β-In2Se3 (JCPDS), InSe (JCPDS 44-1007), CuInSe2 (JCPDS 87-2265 and 23-0208), Cu3Ga (JCPDS 44-1117), CuS (JCPDS 06-0464) and Cu2−xSe, as shown in Fig. 3(b)). Confirmation of specific compounds is difficult using only XRD analysis as the Cu2−xSe peak overlaps with several other peaks including those of CuInSe2, In2Se3, CuS or CIGSSe phases. Therefore, further verification using composition analysis was required.
 Fig. 3  XRD patterns of the (a) HSA and (b) HSB film on the Mo substrate obtained from the coupled scans (black line) and 2θ scans (blue line). 
To elucidate the structural properties of the films, they were examined using Raman spectroscopy (Fig. 4). Consistent with the XRD analysis, the Raman spectrum of the HSA film contained both the CIGSSe peaks (174, 213, 227 and 293 cm−1) and the Cu2−xSe peak (258 cm−1).3,5,11 The reason for the appearance of the remarkable Cu2−xSe peak is that the band gap of Cu2−xSe (1.7–2 eV) is resonant with the laser excitation wavelength (633 nm). Although the XRD analysis of both thin films showed that the Cu2−xSe phase was present, the proportion of Cu2−xSe phase in these films seemed to be small. The Raman spectrum obtained for the HSB film was dominated by an intense peak (151 cm−1) that was consistent with the main peak originating from the (In1−yGay)2Se3 phase. This peak exhibits a single shoulder, which has been observed in Ga-containing materials, whereas Ga-free materials are reported to exhibit symmetrical shoulders on both sides.23 The In2Se3 (151 cm−1) phase resulted from a Ga-poor stoichiometry, which was consistent with a low GGI (0.19) ratio determined via the EDS analysis of the HSB film (Table 1). Moreover, other secondary phases were observed (i.e., CuIn3Se8 (109 cm−1) and InSe (225 cm−1)).10,24 Contrary to the Raman spectrum of the HSA film, a CuS peak3,25 was found in the range from 400 to 600 cm−1 in the Raman spectrum of the HSB film; this indicated that the precursor CuS would probably remain as a residue on the surface of the HSB film.
 Fig. 4  Raman spectra of the (a) HSA and (b) HSB films. 
The SIMS profiles that present the elemental intensity distribution of the HSA and HSB films are shown in Fig. 5. This data is complementary to that of both the XRD and Raman analyses. The HSA film showed a uniform distribution of intensity in most parts; this was consistent with the formation of the CIGSSe film, as indicated by the XRD and Raman data. The SIMS profile of the HSA film was similar to that of conventional CIGSSe films. Thus, further improvements in this process are required to realize high-quality CIGSSe films.2,3 Exceptionally, low intensity of the S atoms on the surface was slightly indicated. In the SIMS profile of the HSB film, the Cu composition exhibited a non-uniform distribution. Compared to the Cu intensity on the surface, Cu-poor areas existed in the mid-region, which represented the Cu-poor phase identified via the XRD and Raman results; the reason for non-uniform Cu distribution was the presence of a residue of the CuS precursor; similar to the CuS Raman peak of the HSB film, the intensity of the S atoms also revealed the presence of residues of the CuS precursor. In addition, In atoms diffused to the surface due to a preferential reaction of In with Se atoms;21 this caused relatively high Cu composition at the bottom of the film. The different intensity of Cu and S elements were present at different depths for the HSA and HSB films due to their different grain growth conditions and mechanisms. The diffusion of these elements has been comprehensively described hereinafter.19
 Fig. 5  SIMS data for the (a) HSA and (b) HSB films. 
Using the geometric, structural and compositional characteristics of the HSA and HSB films, we suggested possible mechanisms of film formation for each process (Fig. 6). The film quality was affected by both the atomic diffusivity and the stoichiometry. In the HSA process, during the deposition of (In,Ga)2Se on the CuS film, the S atoms from the CuS film were replaced with the Se atoms; this resulted in Cu–Se liquid phase-assisted CIGSSe grain growth, which led to well-recrystallization similar to the case of a common three-stage evaporation process.2 Eventually, a uniform CIGSSe layer that consisted of large grains formed. However, a small amount of Cu–Se and CIGSe phases was indicated on the surface. The Cu–Se phase was examined via the XRD and Raman results (Fig. 3(a) and 4(a)), respectively, and the existence of the CIGSe phase was verified from an insufficient S atom intensity on the surface in the SIMS profile (Fig. 5(a)). The formation of the Cu–Se and CIGSe phases was caused by excess of Se atoms during the additional Se annealing process. We think that the removal of a very small amount of these phases from the surface will be helpful to improve the efficiency. On the contrary, the HSB process involved selenization after the deposition of (In,Ga)2Se3 and CuS. On the surface, although CuS underwent substitution to replace the S atom with the Se atom by a Se annealing process, both the CuS precursor and the Cu–Se phase remained due to the insufficient replacement of the S atom by Se.26 In addition, the Cu atoms from CuS could diffuse towards the bottom of the film (Se primary reaction). This resulted in mixed phases, including a Cu–In–Se, In–Se and Ga–Se compound, because of the inadequate Cu and Se atom stoichiometry in the HSB film (Fig. 6(b)).
 Fig. 6  Schematic showing the proposed mechanisms for the formation of the (a) HSA and (b) HSB films. 
Finally, the CIGSSe solar cells were fabricated using the HSA and HSB films, and the performance of the resulting devices was examined. The J–V curves and incident-photon conversion-efficiency (IPCE) data obtained for these devices are shown in Fig. 7, and the related device data is presented in Table 2. The performance of the solar cell that contained the HSA film was significantly better than that of the solar cell that contained the HSB film; this was due to the presence of the uniform CIGS phase in the HSA film. The efficiency of the HSA cell was 13.6%, with the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF) of 0.58 V, 35.8 mA cm−2, and 65.5%, respectively. Conversely, the efficiency of the cell that contained the HSB film was only 1.20%, as shown in Table 2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curve also exhibited the same aspect as the efficiency of both cells (Fig. 7(b)). The poor device results were likely caused by the formation of secondary and mixture phases and the non-uniform composition of the HSB film.

Conclusions
Herein, we investigated novel processes, which combined a nanoparticle-based, non-vacuum process and a co-evaporation vacuum process, for the fast and cost-effective fabrication of CIGSSe thin films. Films were fabricated using these processes in two different orders: hybrid stacking A and hybrid stacking B. Geometric and structural analysis of both the HSA and the HSB films showed that the HSA film was more uniform, had better crystallinity and contained larger grain sizes than the HSB film; via examination and comparison of the properties of the HSA and HSB films, the mechanisms of formation of the CIGSSe films were proposed, which were related to the diffusion of atoms and the stoichiometry. Solar cells were fabricated using these films, and the devices that contained the HSA film exhibited superior device performance with the efficiency of 13.6% when compared with that of the HSB cell (1.20%). The uniform composition of the HSA film and the existence of mixed phases in the HSB film significantly affected the performance of the resulting devices. This novel, hybrid stacking fabrication process can provide an alternative device fabrication technique with not only high material-utilization but also high device efficiency, which is critical for CIGSSe solar cell fabrication. We believe that this technique will contribute to the widespread commercialization of CIGSSe solar cells in industry.
Experimental
Preparation of the CuS precursor
Typical synthetic methods were used to fabricate the colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) as reported in the literature.19,27 In a nitrogen-filled glove box, CuI (2 mmol) and Na2S (1 mmol) were dissolved in pyridine (30 mL) and methanol (20 mL), respectively, and then stirred for 10 min. The CuI (yellowish) and Na2S (clear) solutions were mixed together in a 100 mL glass bottle in a fume hood to yield a colloidal solution that was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min. The upper liquid-layer was decanted, and the isolated colloids were dispersed in pyridine. The centrifugation and isolation procedure were repeated several times for purification. The as-prepared CuS NP precursor solution was spin-coated onto the Mo-sputtered substrates using a coater (ACE-200, Dong Ah Tech.) at 1000 rpm for 20 s. This step was repeated 7 times on each substrate to ensure that the precursor films were uniform. The coatings were dried at 300 °C for 3 min in air on a hot plate repeatedly.
Deposition of the (In,Ga)2Se3 precursor and selenization
The (In,Ga)2Se3 precursor was fabricated by the simultaneous evaporation of In, Ga and Se in a vacuum chamber. The chamber was lowered to a base pressure of 8 × 10−7 Torr before starting the deposition. The temperature and rotational speed of the substrate holder were 500 °C and 6 rpm, respectively. The evaporation rates for In, Ga and Se were 3.5, 1.5, and 7 Å s−1, respectively. The selenization process was performed in the same vacuum chamber with the substrate temperature of 500 °C and the evaporation rate of 7 Å s−1 for 1 hour.19
Fabrication of the CIGSSe solar cell
A Mo back contact with the thickness of 1.1–1.2 μm was grown on a soda-lime glass (SLG) substrate from a 99.95% pure Mo target using a pulsed DC magnetron sputtering system. The CIGSSe absorber layers were prepared from the CuS NPs and the (In,Ga)2Se3 precursor. The CIGSSe solar cells were fabricated using a CdS buffer layer (∼50 nm) that was deposited onto the CIGS films using a chemical bath deposition. After depositing the buffer layer, the intrinsic ZnO (∼50 nm) and ITO (∼150 nm) window layers were deposited by radio frequency (RF) sputtering. Al electrodes were deposited using e-beam evaporation. The solar cells had MgF2 (∼120 nm) antireflection coating by e-beam evaporation, and the active area of the device was 0.44 cm2.
Characterization of the solar cells
The crystalline structure of the films was examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku, D/MAX-2500) with Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 200 mA. Raman spectroscopy was performed using a quasi-back scattering geometry with the excitation wavelength of 633 nm from an Ar ion laser. The scattered light was filtered using a holographic edge filter, dispersed using the TRIAX 320 spectrometer, and detected using a liquid-nitrogen-cooled, back-illuminated charge-coupled-device (CCD) detector array. Depth-dependent elemental distribution profiles were analyzed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS, CAMECA IMS 7f) using O2+ as the primary ion with the impact energy of 5 keV. The pressure in the analysis chamber was lowered to 1.97 × 10−9 Torr before analysis. The morphology and microstructure were examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Hitachi S4700) in conjunction with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS); the average of the composition ratio was measured repeatedly over 5 times in the adjacent area. The current–voltage characteristics of the devices were measured using a sourcemeter (K2450, Keithley) under irradiation of simulated AM 1.5 sunlight, referred by a standard mono-Si solar cell (PVM 524, PV Measurement Inc, USA), which was certified by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL, USA). An incident-photon conversion-efficiency (IPCE) measurement unit (Soma Optics, Japan) was used for EQE.
