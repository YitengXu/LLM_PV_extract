    , Accepted 22nd June 2020First published on 22nd June 2020AbstractCsPbIBr2 is promising for all-inorganic, carbon-based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), owing to its quite balanced bandgap and stability characteristics. However, the serious self-doping phenomenon in one-step solution-processed CsPbIBr2 films that causes decreased built-in potentials (Vbis) and intensified carrier recombination hinders further performance optimization of the resulting PSCs. Herein, we demonstrate that such an obstacle can be overcome through rationally tailoring CsPbIBr2 precursor stoichiometry. Experimental results consistently show that a PbBr2-rich precursor tends to reinforce self-doping in the CsPbIBr2 film, while a CsI-rich one helps to weaken it. Thus, CsPbIBr2 films with a much lower self-doping level are achieved based on the CsI-rich precursor with an optimized CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratio of 1.1:1.0. The films possess a pure phase, much fewer compositional defects, and increased work function, resulting in suppressed carrier recombination and extended Vbi of the final PSCs. Consequently, their average efficiency is boosted to (9.92 ± 0.56)%, far exceeding those of films fabricated with a stoichiometric precursor with the value of (8.32 ± 0.61)%. Particularly, the champion CsPbIBr2 PSC delivers a superior efficiency of 10.48% and an outstanding photovoltage of 1.32 V. This work represents a major leap for CsPbIBr2 PSCs and paves the way for their further exploration to achieve better performance.
1. Introduction
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs), a promising photovoltaic technology for solar energy conversion, have advanced rapidly in the past decade.1–3 The highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of state of the art PSCs has reached up to 25.2%.4 However, their commercialization pace seems to be retarded by their poor operational stability and reliability.5,6 Such obstacles are mainly caused by the chemical instability and decomposability of hybrid halide perovskite films, as well as the interface degradation of hole-transporting-layers (HTLs)/metal electrodes under practical operational conditions, in particular high-temperature/humidity and intense ultraviolet light.7–9 In this case, alternative all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs are proposed, in which the fragile hybrid perovskites are replaced by more stable inorganic perovskites, and the HTLs as well as metal electrodes are substituted by cheap and inert carbon electrodes.10,11 In this manner, the all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs are endowed with a series of spectacular merits, including superb thermal stability (>300 °C), excellent ambient stability, cost-effectiveness, and simple fabrication, which make them promising for various practical optoelectronic applications.12–19
At present, some typical inorganic perovskite materials, including CsPbI3,12,18,20,21 CsPbI2Br,22,23 CsPbIBr2,15,24–27 and CsPbBr3 (ref. 19 and 28–30) that have optical bandgaps (Egs) ranging from ∼1.73 to ∼2.30 eV, have been studied extensively for all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs. Among them, CsPbIBr2 with a bandgap of ∼2.05 eV can stay stable up to 460 °C in an ambient atmosphere,27,31–35 exhibiting quite balanced bandgap and phase stability features, which ensure both relatively wide light absorption and excellent stability of the final PSCs. Thus, it seems to be a very promising choice for all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs.
Recently, great efforts have been devoted to all-inorganic, carbon-based CsPbIBr2 PSCs.2,26,27,35–39 However, their champion PCE is still far behind the theoretical value, even for the ones based on I–Br mixed hybrid perovskites with a similar bandgap.2,36,38 The reason for such disparity turns out to be the large energy loss (Eloss) in CsPbIBr2 PSCs, which is basically caused by the serious non-radiative recombination and unfavorable band energy alignment.3,24,36,40 Primarily, these issues can be attributed to the severe self-doping phenomenon in solution-processed CsPbIBr2 films.13,34,36,41–45 To be specific, most of the current CsPbIBr2 films were prepared via a one-step spin-coating route, wherein the precursor solution was prepared by dissolving equimolar PbBr2 and CsI in common solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). However, PbBr2 and CsI precursor materials intrinsically have much different solubilities in these solvents, which cause the nonsynchronous precipitation of the precursor materials during the spin-coating process, finally resulting in CsPbIBr2 films containing abundant compositional defects with shallow energy levels, including interstitials and vacancies. These defects become the main source of unintentional self-dopants in CsPbIBr2 films, which not only act as non-radiative recombination centers, but also cause a rise in the Fermi levels of the films. As such, the one-step spin-coated CsPbIBr2 films generally exhibit an n-type nature, as reported previously.13,34,36,40,42,43 Such drawbacks easily cause decreased built-in potentials (Vbis) and increased back-flow probability of photo-generated electrons from electron transporting layers (ETLs) to CsPbIBr2 films in the final PSCs. Therefore, a plausible way to moderate the unintentional self-doping in solution-processed CsPbIBr2 films is highly desired for further advancement of all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs.
Herein, we demonstrate for the first time that the undesirable self-doping phenomenon in one-step spin-coated CsPbIBr2 films can be effectively cured through simple control of their precursor stoichiometry. It is found that CsPbIBr2 films with a weak self-doping level can be obtained by the innovative use of a non-stoichiometric CsPbIBr2 precursor with an appropriate CsI-rich component. The resultant films possess a pure phase, strikingly decreased compositional defects, and increased work function, which render suppressed non-radiative recombination of carriers and enlarged Vbi of the resultant all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs. Consequently, the average PCE of the corresponding PSCs is boosted to (9.92 ± 0.56)%, which is substantially higher than those based on stoichiometric precursors with the value of (8.32 ± 0.61)%. And, the best-performing one produces a PCE of 10.48% and an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.32 V, both of which are among the highest values of CsPbIBr2-based PSCs reported earlier.
2. Results and discussion
To establish our discussion, three types of CsPbIBr2 films were prepared via a one-step spin-coating route, for which typical PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors with CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratios of 0.9:1.0, 1.0:1.0, and 1.1:1.0 were adopted, respectively. For simplicity, the as-obtained CsPbIBr2 films along with the all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs are labeled “PbBr2-rich”, “stoichiometric”, and “CsI-rich” hereinafter. The specified preparation recipes of the films are provided in the Section 4.
Electronic properties of CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors were investigated by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) tests. The results in Fig. 1(a–c) show that all the films have uniformly distributed surface potentials, revealing their homogeneous electronic features. Meanwhile, it is observed that the surface potential decreases gradually for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, wherein the average contact potential difference (CPD) values were estimated to be 719, 605, and 325 meV for them, respectively. In general, a smaller CPD is suggestive of a higher work function of the tested sample.46,47 It is thus inferred that work function increases for CsPbIBr2 films based on PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors in that order. Furthermore, such inference is supported by the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) results presented in Fig. 1(d). By linearly fitting the cutoff energies (Ecutoffs) of UPS spectra,13 the work function values can be evaluated to be 4.04, 4.13, and 4.44 eV for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, respectively.

On the other hand, the valence band maximum (VBM) of as-prepared CsPbIBr2 films was determined to be 5.53 eV after linearly fitting the onset energies (Eonsets) of UPS spectra,13 while the conduction band minimum (CBM) rose to 3.40 eV by setting the bandgap of CsPbIBr2 films to 2.13 eV. In this way, energy diagrams of the concerned CsPbIBr2 films were constructed, as provided in Fig. 1(e). We are aware that the CsPbIBr2 film obtained with the stoichiometric precursor has a Fermi level (EF) of 0.335 eV above its middle bandgap, indicating n-doping of the film.41,47,48 When the PbBr2-rich precursor was used, the EF of the resultant CsPbIBr2 film moves toward its CBM, resulting in higher n-doping. On the other hand, the CsI-rich precursor can produce a CsPbIBr2 film with EF of 0.025 eV above the middle bandgap and close to that of intrinsic CsPbIBr2, thus indicating its weak n-type feature and extremely low doping level. The KPFM and UPS results reveal that the doping level of the CsPbIBr2 film is largely associated with its precursor stoichiometry. In summary, the common CsPbIBr2 film prepared with the stoichiometric precursor has an n-type nature, while such undesired character is eliminated successfully by the use of a CsI-rich precursor.
The dependencies of the work function and n-type doping level of CsPbIBr2 films on their precursor stoichiometry may be ascribed to the different amounts of self-dopants in them, as a result of varied compositions.12,41,48–51 To validate our standpoint, the actual relative amounts of compositional elements in the as-obtained CsPbIBr2 films were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fig. 2(a–e) present core-level C 1s, Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d XPS spectra of CsPbIBr2 films obtained with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, respectively, for which the survey XPS are provided in Fig. S1.† To exclude possible surface charging effects, the core-level C 1s peak of amorphous carbon (284.8 eV) was used as a reference to calibrate the energy positions of all the spectra, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). One can see from Fig. 2(b–e) that the binding energies of Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d peaks tend to decrease for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, while their Cs 3d peaks change in the opposite manner. These results indicate the presence of an increased electron cloud along with the shielding effect for Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d, and a decreased electron cloud for Cs 3d of the corresponding samples. Primarily, such a phenomenon can be ascribed to the varied compositional stoichiometric ratios among the studied CsPbIBr2 films.12,27,40,43,50 To clarify this point, the relative amounts of compositional atoms for the related CsPbIBr2 films were estimated by processing their core-level Cs 3d, Pb 4f, I 3d, and Br 3d XPS spectra with XPSPEAK software and Casa XPS program. Fig. 2(f) summarizes the obtained relative atomic ratios of [Pb + Br]/[Cs + I]. The value is much beyond 1.5 for the CsPbIBr2 film prepared with the PbBr2-rich precursor, signifying its PbBr2-rich composition. In terms of the CsPbIBr2 film obtained with the stoichiometric precursor, its (Pb + Br)/(Cs + I) atomic ratio is still larger than 1.5. However, the value becomes close to 1.5 for the one prepared with the CsI-rich precursor, suggesting that it has a more stoichiometric composition, compared with the other two. It is generally accepted that the excess lead salt species in a lead halide perovskite film would generate a large number of halide vacancies.41 These vacancies usually create shallow levels of electrons from the unsaturated lead halide octahedron ([PbX6]4−, X = I, Br, or their mixtures), thus resulting in n-doping.52 Similar cases have been demonstrated frequently in hybrid halide perovskites.44,47,48,50 Since the excess PbBr2 species, namely self-dopants, diminish for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors in that order, their work function increases and the n-type doping level declines in the same order.

Next, the morphological, crystalline, and optical/electrical properties of CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors were studied. Fig. 3(a1–c1) give their scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, while the related atomic force microscopy (AFM) images are provided in Fig. 3(a2–c2). All the films are characterized by a uniform flat surface and tightly packed grains, which help avoid possible shuttling paths in ultimate PSCs. Meanwhile, their grains possess a similar average size of ∼500 nm. These results indicate that precursor stoichiometry has an insignificant influence on the major morphological features of the CsPbIBr2 film. However, there are some clear impurity phases in the adjacent grains of the CsPbIBr2 film prepared with the PbBr2-rich precursor, because they exhibit quite bright contrast, as marked in Fig. 3(a1), possibly because of their less-conductive nature.53 By comparison, the impurity phases decline notably in the one obtained with the stoichiometric precursor and disappear in that prepared with the CsI-rich precursor. Herein, the observed impurity phases can be assigned to PbBr2 species because of the facts given below. To be specific, it is found that similar impurity phase species increase substantially in the CsPbIBr2 film prepared with a more PbBr2-rich precursor with a CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratio of 0.8:1.0, as shown in Fig. S2(a).† Moreover, the additional diffraction peak at 2θ = 28.7° that corresponds to PbBr2 can be identified from its X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Fig. S2(b)†).28,30 Note that the appearance of the PbBr2 impurity phase in CsPbIBr2 films prepared with both PbBr2-rich and stoichiometric precursors, and the absence of that phase in the one obtained with the CsI-rich precursor are consistent with their XPS results.

All the scale bars in panels (a1–c1) and (a2–c2) stand for 1 μm. 

Fig. 3(d) presents XRD patterns of the as-obtained CsPbIBr2 films. Obvious diffraction peaks at ∼15.0°, 21.3°, 30.2°, and 30.3° were detected, which can be assigned to the (100), (110), (200), and (210) crystalline faces of CsPbIBr2 materials with the perovskite cubic phase.24,25 By contrast, the main (200) diffraction peak intensifies and its full width at half maximum (FWHM) decreases for the samples prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors in the same order. Moreover, the positions of (100) and (200) diffraction peaks shift toward higher angles by following the same order, as indicated in Fig. 3(e) and Table S1.† These results reveal the improved crystallinity and reduced crystalline imperfections of CsPbIBr2 films obtained with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, probably benefiting from the decreased impurity phase and self-dopants in them in the same order, as a result of improved compositional stoichiometry.

Fig. 4(a) gives UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors. Sequential absorbance improvement for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors is observed, which can be ascribed to the diminished impurity phase and self-doping level in them following the same order.2,49 In addition, a similar absorption onset wavelength of ∼582 nm is identified for all the CsPbIBr2 films, which corresponds to a bandgap of 2.13 eV (Fig. 4(b)), in line with previous studies.24,25,34Fig. 4(c) gives normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the studied CsPbIBr2 films.

(d) SCLC analyses of dark J–V curves for electron-transport-only devices based on the concerned CsPbIBr2 films. The inset in panel (d) illustrates the configuration of the electron-transport-only devices. 
The major PL peaks at ∼580, ∼575, and ∼572 nm were identified for the films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, respectively. These PL peaks are assigned to the band-to-band recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes, because their energies basically conform to the bandgap of CsPbIBr2 films. Note that the relative blue-shifts of the PL peaks mainly relate to the reduced compositional defects in the corresponding CsPbIBr2 films, as a result of suppressed self-doping. In addition, a shoulder PL peak is observed for each CsPbIBr2 film, which primarily results from the light-induced halide phase segregation, as repeatedly reported for I–Br mixed perovskites.13,35,42,54,55 By contrast, the halide phase segregation tends to weaken for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors in the same order. Such a phenomenon can be attributed to the reduced self-dopants in relevant CsPbIBr2 films in the same order, benefiting from the decreased compositional imperfections, correspondingly.54
To confirm the sequentially declined self-doping level in CsPbIBr2 films achieved with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) analyses of electron-transport-only devices based on them were carried out, as displayed in Fig. 4(d). The configuration of such devices is schematically shown in the inset of Fig. 4(d). In this manner, the trap density (Nt) can be correlated with the trap-filled limit voltage (VTFL) by following the equation Nt = 2VTFLεrε0/eL2,27,53 in which L is the thickness of the CsPbIBr2 film, ε0 stands for vacuum permittivity, and εr represents the relative dielectric constant of CsPbIBr2. The VTFLs were fitted to 1.65, 1.46, and 1.32 V for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, respectively. Since a larger VTFL means a higher Nt and hence a heavier self-doping in the present case, we can infer that the self-doping level and trap density reduce, in that order, for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors.
All the above investigations demonstrate that in terms of CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, they have similar morphological features, but their work function, crystallinity, and absorbance increase in the order of the precursors given above, while their impurity phase, n-doping level, and trap density change in the opposite manner. These sequentially modified characteristics can be assigned to the decreased self-doping level of CsPbIBr2 films in the same order. To further probe the influence of the self-doping level of the CsPbIBr2 film on its photovoltaic performance, all-inorganic, carbon-based CsPbIBr2 PSCs were fabricated based on various PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors that have CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratios of 0.8:1.0, 0.9:1.0, 1.0:1.0, 1.1:1.0, and 1.2:1.0, respectively. Fig. 5(a) presents the cross-sectional SEM image of an all-inorganic, carbon-based CsPbIBr2 PSC, wherein all the functional layers, including the FTO substrate, TiO2 ETL, CsPbIBr2 absorber, and carbon electrode, can be identified clearly. In particular, the thickness of the CsPbIBr2 film was estimated to be ∼410 nm, which can ensure sufficient absorption of incident light for the PSC.32Fig. 5(b) gives statistical PCEs of all the fabricated PSCs. When a stoichiometric CsPbIBr2 precursor was used, the resultant PSCs yield an average PCE of (8.32 ± 0.61)%, which is comparative to those of pervious CsPbIBr2 PSCs.2,24,27,36,39 By comparison, one can see that the PbBr2-rich CsPbIBr2 precursors are harmful to the performance of the all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs. For example, the one with the CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratio of 0.8:1.0 finally produces PSCs with a much inferior average PCE of (5.92 ± 0.58)%. However, an appropriate CsI-rich precursor can improve the performance of the corresponding PSC. To be specific, the one with the CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratio of 1.1:1.0 could endow the PSCs with a noticeably superior average PCE of (9.92 ± 0.56)%, while the one with the higher stoichiometric ratio of 1.2:1.0 causes decreased average PCE of (7.64 ± 0.57)%. Note that the abrupt drop of average PCE for the latter one is mainly caused by the incompletely dissolved precursor species. Therefore, we can conclude that the CsI-rich precursor with a CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratio of 1.1:1.0 is relatively optimal to achieve high-performance all-inorganic, carbon-based CsPbIBr2 PSCs.

(b) Statistical PCEs of CsPbIBr2 PSCs prepared with various PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors with the CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratios of 0.8:1.0, 0.9:1.0, 1.0:1.0, 1.1:1.0, and 1.2:1.0, respectively. (c) J–V and (d) EQE results for the optimized CsPbIBr2 PSCs based on the typical PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, respectively. 
Next, PSCs fabricated with the typical PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors that have CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratios of 0.9:1.0, 1.0:1.0, and 1.1:1.0 are used as model samples to illustrate the influence of the self-doping level of CsPbIBr2 film on the performance of all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs. Fig. 5(c) provides the light J–V curves of the resulting champion PSCs, which were tested under a simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination and reverse scan (RS) of voltages from 1.5 to −0.2 V. The CsPbIBr2 PSC fabricated with the stoichiometric precursor shows a PCE of 8.93%, coupled with a Voc of 1.26 V, a Jsc of 11.31 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.63. These photovoltaic parameters drop to 7.78%, 1.20 V, 10.96 mA cm−2, and 0.59, respectively, for the similar PSCs prepared with the PbBr2-rich precursor. Regarding the CsPbIBr2 PSC fabricated with the CsI-rich precursor, its PCE, Voc, Jsc, and FF are improved to 10.48%, 1.32 V, 11.58 mA cm−2 and 0.69, respectively. Note that both PCE and Voc achieved herein rank among the highest values reported for CsPbIBr2-based PSCs, as presented in Table S2.† In addition, the J–V curves measured under forward scan (FS) of voltages in Fig. S3† well support the performance differences among the as-investigated CsPbIBr2 PSCs, wherein the common J–V hysteresis appears in all of them, as with the previous CsPbIBr2 PSCs.32,34,42,43 As such, we can realize that the CsPbIBr2 precursor with a slightly CsI-richer component can promote a lower self-doping level of the CsPbIBr2 film and thus a better performance of the all-inorganic, carbon-based PSC. At the same time, external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the as-fabricated CsPbIBr2 PSCs were investigated. As shown Fig. 5(d), they exhibit an identical photocurrent onset wavelength of ∼580 nm, in line with the absorption edge of CsPbIBr2 films. In contrast, the EQEs increase sequentially for PSCs prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, verifying again the improved photoelectric conversion capacity of the corresponding PSCs in the same order.
Overall, the above investigations reveal that the self-doping level weakens in the sequence given below and the performance of PSCs improves correspondingly for CsPbIBr2 films prepared with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors. To understand this intrinsic dependence relationship, carrier dynamics for the as-obtained CsPbIBr2 PSCs were studied as follows. Fig. 6(a) presents the dark J–V curves of the as-obtained CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The unsymmetrical feature of all the J–V plots under forward and reverse voltages reveals the formation of built-in fields in the CsPbIBr2 PSCs. Meanwhile, one can see that leakage current decreases for CsPbIBr2 PSCs fabricated with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors in that sequence. Thus, it is inferred that the carrier recombination weakens in them in the same order, since a smaller leakage current is mostly coupled with a weaker carrier recombination.2,13,24,26,43Fig. 6(b) displays time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra. They were fitted using a bi-exponential decay function of time (τ): , where Ai is a prefactor and τi is the time constant, and the average carrier lifetime (tave) can be estimated according to the equation  Thus, the τave values were estimated to be 4.89, 1.72, and 1.08 ns for CsPbIBr2 PSCs based on PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, respectively, indicating that the carrier extraction is boosted in that order for them.27,30,36

Together, the dark J–V and TRPL results reveal that the superior performance of the CsPbIBr2 PSC fabricated with the CsI-rich precursor largely comes from the suppressed carrier recombination and promoted carrier extraction in it. To further probe the carrier recombination/extraction features in the concerned CsPbIBr2 PSCs, transient photocurrent/photovoltage (TPC/TPV) tests were performed. As shown in Fig. 6(c), the TPV becomes slower for CsPbIBr2 PSCs fabricated with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors in the same order, wherein the τave values of TPV were evaluated to be 0.62, 0.75, and 1.12 ms, respectively. Instead, the TPV becomes faster sequentially for them, wherein the τave values of TPC were estimated to be 5.32, 3.73, and 1.42 μs, respectively. A slower TPV generally indicates a weaker carrier recombination of the solar cell, while a faster TPC means a more energetic carrier extraction in it.13,24,26,43,53 Therefore, the TPV and TPC results verify the reduced carrier recombination and promoted carrier extraction in CsPbIBr2 PSCs fabricated with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors in that sequence.
In addition, electrochemical measurements were carried out on the as-fabricated CsPbIBr2 PSCs. Fig. 6(e) presents their Nyquist plots derived from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) spectra tested under a forward bias of 1.2 V and in the dark. There is an obvious semicircle in each of the Nyquist plots, which is predominantly dominated by the carrier recombination and characterized by the recombination resistance (Rrec), based on the one RC-element equivalent circuit model.13,24,26,27,43,53 The Rrec increases in the order given for CsPbIBr2 PSCs fabricated with PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, which indicates the suppressed carrier recombination in them in the same order, in accordance with the dark J–V and TPV results provided above. Fig. 6(f) shows Mott–Schottky (M–S) analysis results of the related CsPbIBr2 PSCs. The Vbis were fitted to 1.13, 1.32, and 1.53 V for CsPbIBr2 PSCs based on PbBr2-rich, stoichiometric, and CsI-rich precursors, respectively. In addition, one can identify that the slope factor of the linear portions of replotted M–S curves increases in the above given sequence for them, which reveals the decreased doping concentration of the corresponding CsPbIBr2 films in the same order, in line with the variation of their self-doping level.36 In general, a larger Vbi makes for a boosted driving force to separate photogenerated carriers along with an extended depletion region to efficiently suppress electron–hole recombination.13,24–27,36,43,53 Moreover, the decreased doping concentration is conducive to eliminating scattering centers, thus promoting the transportation of carriers. Therefore, the CsPbIBr2 PSC fabricated with an appropriate CsI-rich precursor yields the weakest carrier recombination and most effective carrier extraction among all the investigated ones. Primarily, all these desired features can be ascribed to the declined self-doping level in the CsPbIBr2 film prepared with a CsI-rich precursor, which contributes to the amplified work function, pure phase, and decreased compositional imperfections in it. The former one gives rise to an enlarged Vbi and the latter two result in decreased defects.
3. Conclusions
In summary, we report an effective strategy to alleviate the detrimental self-doping in conventional one-step deposited CsPbIBr2 films by tailoring its precursor stoichiometry. It is demonstrated that a PbBr2-rich precursor aggravates self-doping in the CsPbIBr2 film, while the CsI-rich one contributes to suppressing such an unfavorable phenomenon. In this manner, optimized CsPbIBr2 films with a weak self-doping level are achieved successfully by the use of a precursor with a CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratio of 1.1:1.0. The films have a pure phase, much fewer compositional defects, and increased work function. The former two vital features are conducive to suppressing the non-radiative recombination of carriers, while the latter one helps to extend the Vbi of the resultant all-inorganic, carbon-based PSCs. Therefore, the average PCE of the CsPbIBr2 PSC is improved to (9.92 ± 0.56)%, which is significantly better than that fabricated with a stoichiometric precursor with the value of (8.32 ± 0.61)%. In particular, the champion CsPbIBr2 PSC delivers a superior PCE of 10.48% and an outstanding Voc of 1.32 V, both of which are comparable to the record values of pure CsPbIBr2-based PSCs. Therefore, the rational elimination of intrinsic self-doping in CsPbIBr2 films by precursor stoichiometry engineering will be a valuable strategy to promote further developments of CsPbIBr2 PSCs and even other related optoelectronic devices.
4. Experimental section
Preparation of CsPbIBr2 films and PSCs
Firstly, an etched FTO substrate was pre-cleaned ultrasonically in a detergent, acetone, and isopropanol, followed by an additional ultraviolet–ozone treatment for 15 min. Then, a TiO2 ETL (∼60 nm) was deposited onto the FTO substrate by spin-coating of TiO2 sol at 3500 rpm for 30 s and annealing at 480 °C for 60 min in ambient air. The TiO2 sol was prepared according to the work of Wang et al.56 without any dilution. Next, the CsPbIBr2 film was deposited onto the FTO/TiO2 sample by spin-coating of 1 M CsPbIBr2 precursor at 1500 rpm for 30 s and 5000 rpm for 60 s, after which the sample was heated at 50 °C for 5 min and further annealed at 280 °C for 15 min. The normal CsPbIBr2 precursor was obtained by dissolving 367 mg of PbBr2 and 260 mg of CsI in 1 mL DMSO. In order to obtain CsPbIBr2 films with different self-doping levels, PbBr2-rich and CsI-rich CsPbIBr2 precursors with varied CsI/PbBr2 stoichiometric ratios of 0.8:1.0, 0.9:1.0, 1.1:1.0, and 1.2:1.0 were used, respectively. Finally, the carbon electrode with a specific area of 0.09 cm2 was coated onto CsPbIBr2 film by the screen-printing method, after which the sample was heated at 125 °C for 15 min in ambient air to evaporate the remaining solvent and solidify the carbon paste. Thus, the all-inorganic, carbon-based CsPbIBr2 PSC was obtained after cooling down to room-temperature.
Characterization
KPFM/AFM tests were performed on a Nanoscope V Dimension Icon AFM system (Bruker, Santa Barbara, CA). XPS/UPS spectra were tested using an ESCALAB 250Xi XPS system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an Al-Kα X-ray source (hν = 1486.6 eV) and a non-monochromatized He-Iα radiation (hν = 21.2 eV) discharge lamp. SEM characterization was performed on a Zeiss Supra-40 field-emission SEM. XRD tests were carried out on a Rigaku Ultima III X-ray diffractometer system. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer. Steady-state PL spectra were measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (Hitachi F-7000) with a 460 nm excitation. Light J–V curves of PSCs were measured using a Keithley 2450 source measurement unit under a simulated AM 1.5G illumination (Crowntech Inc., EASISOLAR-50-3A). EQE results were obtained using an Enlitech QE-3011 system. Dark J–V curves were tested with a Keithley 2636B source meter in an electrically shielded dark box. TRPL results were acquired by the use of a FluoTime 300 spectrometer (PicoQuant, Germany). A picosecond pulsed diode laser (406.8 nm) with a pulse width of 64.2 ps was used as the excitation source. The maximum average power is 5 mW with a duration of 50 ns. TPC and TPV signals were measured using a digital oscilloscope (Tektronix, D4105) on a self-built system with the modulated 532 and 405 nm pulse lasers as the excitation sources, respectively. EIS and M–S curves were obtained with an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660B). During the EIS tests, a 1 V bias voltage was supplied, and the frequency was swept from 1 MHz to 100 Hz. The M–S measurements were performed with an AC excitation amplitude of 30 mV at a frequency of 5 kHz. All the measurements of CsPbIBr2 PSCs were carried out in ambient air and without any encapsulation treatment.
