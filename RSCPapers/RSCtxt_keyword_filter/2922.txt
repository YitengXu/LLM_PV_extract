    , Accepted 23rd May 2013First published on 24th May 2013AbstractA series of small molecules (DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT) with 2,7-carbazole as a center core donor, benzothiadiazole as acceptor units and oligothiophenes as end-capping units were synthesized and characterized. Their thermal, optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties were examined. With increasing the number of the terminal thiophene units and conjugation length, these molecules exhibit red-shifted absorption (529–594 nm), up-shifted HOMO levels (−5.27 to −5.08 eV), and reduced optical band gaps (2.04 to 1.80 eV). Solution processed organic solar cells (OSCs) based on DTCz-TBT/PC71BM exhibit a power conversion efficiency of 2.26% with a high open-circuit voltage up to 1.02 V, while the OSCs based on DTCz-2TBT/PC71BM and DTCz-3TBT/PC71BM exhibit power conversion efficiencies of 3.44% and 3.90% without any post-treatment.
Introduction
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for renewable energy sources for their advantages of low cost, light weight, and large-area fabrication on flexible substrates.1–6 Especially, considerable effort has been focused on the development of OSCs based on conjugated polymers, and power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 10% have been reached.7–11 On the other hand, small molecule donors have also attracted increasing attention very recently, due to their advantages over polymer donors, such as a well-defined structure, definite molecular weight, simple synthesis, and reproducible photovoltaic performance.12 A variety of small molecules containing triphenylamine,13–16 oligothiophenes,17–19 dithieno[3,2-b:2′,3′-d]silole,20–22 benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene,23,24 diketopyrrolopyrrole,25–27 benzothiadiazole (BT),14,15,28–30 thiazolothiazole31 and merocyanine dyes32 have been investigated for solution-processed OSCs. Despite the rapid development of OSCs based on small molecular donors,20,21,24 their PCEs are still below those of their polymer counterparts, and many π-conjugated building blocks have not been explored for the construction of small molecular donors.
Carbazole has been regarded as a promising π-conjugated unit for organic semiconductor materials due to its good hole-transporting and electron-donating capabilities.33 Polymer donors based on 2,7-carbazole exhibited very promising performance.34–36 In general, 2,7-carbazole based polymer donors have a deep highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, which leads to higher values (0.8–1 V) for open-circuit voltage (Voc) in the device of these donors. For example, in their initial report of the synthesis and device performance of poly[N-9′-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4,7-di-2-thienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), Mario Leclerc and colleagues demonstrated a PCE of 3.6% from a bulk heterojunction (BHJ) cell with the Voc value approaching 0.9 V.34 By further device optimization, PCE of 7.1% was achieved.37 Although there are a large number of OSCs with 2,7-carbazole based polymers as donors, to our knowledge, there have been no reports on 2,7-carbazole based small molecules for solution-processed OSCs.
Here we report a series of small molecules with 2,7-carbazole as a center core donor, BT as the acceptor unit and oligothiophenes as end-capping units (DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT, Fig. 1). Because these molecules have a similar π-conjugation skeleton to PCDTBT, deep HOMO energy levels and high Voc are expected. The effect of the terminal oligothiophene length on their optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties was also investigated. A high Voc (up to 1.02 V) for solution-processed OSCs based on a blend of DTCz-TBT/phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) was achieved while OSCs based on DTCz-3TBT/PC71BM exhibited a PCE of 3.90% without any post-treatment.

Experimental section
Materials
Unless otherwise specified, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Toluene and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were distilled over sodium/benzophenone ketyl prior to use.
Characterization
The 1H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance 300M or 400M NMR spectrometer, and chemical shifts were recorded in ppm with tetramethylsilane as the interval standard. Mass spectra were obtained with a LDI-1700 MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a Perkin-Elmer series 7 analysis systems under N2 at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1. UV-vis absorption spectra were measured by a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a Chi660b electrochemical analyzer with a three-electrode cell in 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (Bu4NClO4) in dry CH2Cl2 solution under an argon atmosphere at a scan rate of 100 mV s−1 and using ferrocene as the standard. A glass carbon disk (2 mm diameter) was used as the working electrode with a Pt wire as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of the thin films (on a PEDOT:PSS/glass substrate) were recorded on a SPA300HV with a SPI3800N controller (Seiko Instruments, Inc., Japan) in tapping mode.
Theoretical calculations
Geometry optimizations were computed by the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level.38 All the calculations were performed using the Gaussian 03 program. To simplify the calculation, alkyl chains were replaced by CH3 groups.
Fabrication of organic solar cells (OSCs)
BHJ solar cell devices were fabricated with a structure of ITO/PEDTO:PSS/donor:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The ITO glass was pre-cleaned and modified by a 30 nm PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P4083) layer which was spin-coated from a PEDOT:PSS aqueous solution on the ITO substrate, and was dried subsequently at 120 °C for 30 min. Then a chlorobenzene solution of a blend of donor/PC71BM was spin-coated on the surface of the PEDOT:PSS layer to form a photosensitive layer. The LiF (∼1 nm)/Al (∼100 nm) cathode was deposited at a vacuum level of 4 × 10−4 Pa. The active area of each device was 0.12 cm2. The current–voltage (J–V) measurement of the devices was conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp (500 W) was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was 100 mW cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectrum was measured using a Model SR830 DSP Lock-in Amplifier coupled with a SBP500 monochromator, a DSC102 data acquisition system and a Model SR540 chopper controller. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si photodiode.

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT are outlined in Scheme 1. Compounds DTCz-TBT and DTCz-2TBT were synthesized from Suzuki coupling reaction, while DTCz-3TBT was synthesized via Stille coupling reaction because bromination of compound 5 was a failure. Their structures were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrum. All these small molecules were soluble in common organic solvents including dichloromethane, chloroform and chlorobenzene. Thermal properties of these small molecule donors were investigated with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a nitrogen atmosphere (Fig. 2). The results reveal that these compounds have excellent thermal stabilities with thermal decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) over 400 °C, which indicates that they are quite thermally stable and can be used for device fabrication.

Optical properties
UV-vis absorption spectra of these (2,7-carbazole)-based small molecules in dichloromethane solutions and in solid films are shown in Fig. 3 and the corresponding optical data are collected in Table 1. DTCz-TBT in diluted dichloromethane solution shows an absorption peak at 498 nm with a molar extinction coefficient of 6.13 × 104 M−1 cm−1. Upon increasing the terminal thiophene number, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT solutions present bathochromic absorption peaks at 530 nm and 538 nm with higher molar extinction coefficients of 7.31 × 104 and 1.05 × 105 M−1 cm−1, which were attributed to the increase in their conjugation lengths. Similarly, DTCz-TBT exhibits an absorption maximum of 529 nm, while DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT show red-shift absorption maxima of 559 nm and 594 nm in thin films. At the same time, their absorption onsets were red-shifted from 615 to 660 and 703 nm as well. In comparison with their absorption spectra in solution, the absorption spectra for DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT in thin films were significantly red-shifted, indicating that strong intermolecular interactions exist in the solid state. Their optical band gaps corresponding to their absorption onsets decrease from 2.02 to 1.88 and 1.76 eV with increasing terminal thiophene number, suggesting more efficient light harvesting and higher short-circuit current (Jsc) for OSCs based on DTCz-3TBT.

Electrochemical properties
In order to investigate the electrochemical energy levels of DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT, cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed. Related electrochemical data are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 1. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) level were estimated from the onset oxidation potential and the onset reduction potential relative to the reference energy level of Fc/Fc+ (4.80 eV below vacuum).17DTCz-TBT exhibits a fairly low-lying HOMO level of −5.27 eV, which guaranteed the high open-circuit voltage (Voc) of OSCs.
 Fig. 4  Cyclic voltammograms of compounds DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT in a dichloromethane solution of 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 with a scan rate of 100 mV s−1. 
With increase in the terminal thiophene number, the HOMO level up-shifts to −5.15 eV for DTCz-2TBT and −5.08 eV for DTCz-3TBT. The LUMO level of DTCz-TBT was determined to be −3.23 eV while DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT exhibit slightly lower LUMO levels of −3.27 eV and −3.28 eV. Thus, the electrochemical bandgaps decrease from 2.04 eV to 1.88 eV and 1.80 eV with increase in the terminal thiophene number, which are consistent with the optical bandgaps.
Theoretical calculation
To obtain further insights into the electronic structure of compounds DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT, the geometry of these compounds was optimized by density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. As shown in Fig. 5, their HOMO orbitals are delocalized throughout the whole molecule, while their LUMO orbitals are mainly localized on the electron-deficient BT groups. By increasing the terminal thiophene number, the HOMO energy levels were up-shifted and the LUMO energy levels remained almost stable, resulting in the gradually decreased bandgaps. The theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental data.

Photovoltaic properties
To demonstrate the potential application of 2,7-carbazole based small molecules in OSCs, compounds DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT were used as electron donors to fabricate bulk heterojunction OSCs with a device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor:PC71BM/LiF/Al. All these three compounds exhibit the same optimized D/A weight ratio of 1:2 while the optimized film thickness of devices based on these three compounds is 70–80 nm. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves under optimized conditions are shown in Fig. 6 and the corresponding photovoltaic performance is summarized in Table 2.

As we expected, OSCs based on these small molecules afforded relatively large Voc (>0.85 V), which was attributed to their low-lying HOMO levels. Encouragingly, OSCs based on DTCz-TBT exhibited a high Voc up to 1.02 V. With the increasing terminal oligothiophene length, OSCs based on DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT showed lower Voc of 0.92 V and 0.86 V, respectively. These results were consistent with their HOMO levels.43 Simultaneously, OSCs based on DTCz-TBT, DTCz-2TBT and DTCz-3TBT provided a gradually enhanced Jsc of 6.38 mA cm−2, 8.52 mA cm−2 and 9.80 mA cm−2, respectively, which were also consistent with the trend in their absorption spectra and optical band gaps. The fill factors (FFs) of these devices were in the region of 35% to 46%. A low FF indicates strong recombination in the OSCs,44 presumably because of the inferior carrier mobilities of the active layers. Finally, the PCE increased from 2.26% for DTCz-TBT to 3.44% for DTCz-2TBT and 3.90% for DTCz-3TBT. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of their devices were measured as well. As shown in Fig. 6, all devices based on these small molecules exhibited significant photo-to-current responses in the range of 350–700 nm with the maximum EQE of 46%, 57% and 61% at around 480 nm, respectively. By increasing the terminal thiophene number, the EQE spectra become broader and higher, which is attributed to the stronger and red-shifted absorption. The calculated photocurrent densities from EQE spectra were consistent with those obtained from J–V measurements.
The active layer morphologies were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM) using tapping mode. As shown in Fig. 7, the AFM images of all the three blend films exhibit a similar smooth surface without large aggregated domains. The interpenetrating network can be observed on the surface of the blend films of these small molecules and PC71BM, which should be beneficial to charge separation and transportation in the OSC devices.

When the solar cells are to be used outdoors in full sunlight, the devices must be able to withstand temperatures as high as 75 °C.45 The thermal stability of OSCs based on these small molecules was also studied (see the ESI†). The results revealed moderate thermal stabilities. Devices based on DTCz-3TBT exhibit the best thermal stability with only 25% decrease in PCE after annealing at 80 °C for 12 h. On the other hand, devices based on DTCz-TBT and DTCz-2TBT show 35% and 36% decrease in PCE after annealing at 80 °C for 12 h.
Conclusions
We demonstrate the first attempt to introduce 2,7-carbazole into solution-processed small molecules for organic solar cells. A series of linear small molecules with 2,7-carbazole as a center core donor, benzothiadiazole as the acceptor unit and oligothiophenes as end-capping units were synthesized. These molecules exhibit excellent thermal stability, broad absorption and relatively low HOMO levels. The absorption maximum red-shifts, the optical bandgap decreases, and the HOMO level up-shifts with increasing the number of the terminal thiophene units from one (DTCz-TBT), two (DTCz-2TBT) to three (DTCz-3TBT). The OSC based on DTCz-TBT shows a high Voc up to 1.02 V, while the OSC based on DTCz-3TBT exhibits a PCE of 3.90%. This work demonstrates that 2,7-carbazole based small molecules are promising donor materials for solution processed organic solar cells.
