    , Accepted 25th June 2016First published on 27th June 2016AbstractTwo new A–D–A structured organic molecules with bithienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) as the core and donor unit, indenedione (ID) as the end group and acceptor unit, 3,3′′-dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3T(3-Hex)) or 4,4′′-dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3T(4-Hex)) as the π bridge, BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID, were designed and synthesized. The two compounds with the alkyl side chains at different positions in the π bridge backbone which are applied in solution-processable organic solar cells (OSCs) as donor materials have the same molecular weight and a similar structure, but exhibit different optical and photovoltaic properties. The BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID film shows a broad absorption band from 400 nm to 750 nm with an absorption peak about 20 nm red-shifted compared to that of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID in solution, benefitting from the outward alkyl side chain in its structure. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the solution-processed OSC based on a blend of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID and PC71BM (1.25:1, w/w) reached 6.55% with a Jsc of 10.54 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V and a FF of 71.4%, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. In comparison, the PCE of the OSC based on BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID as the donor is 1.06% under the same experimental conditions.
Introduction
Bulk heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) based on solution-processable organic molecule photovoltaic materials have drawn much attention and research interest in recent years.1–26 The advantages of solution-processable organic molecule OSCs include ease of fabrication, light weight, flexibility, low cost and the definite molecular weight which can avoid the difference from bath to bath in comparison with polymers. Among soluble organic photovoltaic molecules, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) structured materials have been the focus of research for their broad absorption in the visible region and their lower HOMO levels.10–26 For example, Chen et al. published a series of A–D–A small molecular donor materials based on oligothiophenes and rhodanine derivatives which have similar backbones but different conjugation lengths (DRCN4T–DRCN9T). The OPV devices based on all of the compounds DRCN5T–DRCN9T exhibit good photovoltaic performances with PCEs over 6%, especially, DRCN5T shows a notable PCE of 10.10%.20,21
More and more studies have demonstrated that the length of the π bridge and the number, length, branching and position of the side alkyl chains can have significant influence on the optical, crystal, electronic properties and device performance of the photovoltaic materials.27–37 For example, Prof. Wong's group published a range of studies on the effect of various side chains on the photovoltaic properties; the photovoltaic properties of the materials change drastically even with a small change from the oxygen atom to sulphur atom in the side chain.38–44 In previous work, we reported four A–D–A molecules based on bithienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) and indenedione (ID) units. The highest PCE of OSCs achieved based on these molecules (D1, D2, DO1, DO2) is 6.75%, which is among the high values of OSCs based on solution-processed organic small molecules.13 In this work, we design and synthesize two new molecules based on BDT as the donor unit, ID as the acceptor unit, 3,3′′-dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3T(3-Hex)) or 4,4′′-dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3T(4-Hex)) as the π bridge, BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID, as shown in Scheme 1. Compared with D1 which involves bi-thiophene as the π bridge, there is terthiophene with two hexyl side chains as the longer π bridge to extend the π conjugation length in the two new materials. The difference in the molecular structure of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID is just the substituent position of the side chains in the shoulder of the terthiophene. For BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID, the alkyl side chains concentrated in the central part of the terthiophene backbone to form an inward configuration, and for BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID, the chains are distributed in the peripheral part of the backbone to form an outward configuration. This is the first report to investigate the influence of the side chain position in the π conjugated backbone on the OSC device performance of the corresponding molecular materials. Bulk heterojunction OSCs were obtained by spin-coating the blend solution of the compounds as the donor material and PC71BM as the acceptor material. The best photovoltaic performance of OSC devices based on a blend of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID and PC71BM (1.25:1, w/w) is a PCE of 6.55% with a short circuit current density (Jsc) of 10.54 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.87 V and a fill factor (FF) of 71.4%, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. The PCE of 6.55% is comparable with the value of 6.75% using D1.13 But the PCE of the OSC device based on the blend of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and PC71BM (1.5:1, w/w) is just 1.06%, which confirms that even a tiny change in the position of the side alkyl chains may have a tremendous impact on photovoltaic device performance.33
 Scheme 1  Structures and synthetic routes of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID: (I) Pd2(dba)3, [(CH3)3C]3PHBF4, K3PO4 (2 mol L−1), and toluene, under N2, 80 °C for 24 h; (II) 1,3-indanedione and toluene, under N2, 90 °C or 110 °C for 12 h. 
Experimental details
General
Tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium [Pd2(dba)3], tri-tert-butylphosphonium tetrafluoroborate [(CH3)3C]3PHBF4, potassium phosphate (K3PO4), and 1,3-indanedione were obtained from Acros Organics. Toluene was dried over Na/benzophenone and freshly distilled prior to use. Other chemicals were of commercial grade and were used as received.
Experimental
MALDI-TOF spectra were recorded on a Bruker BIFLEX III. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Bruker DMX-400 spectrometer. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements were performed on a NETZSCH-TG-209F1 apparatus, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments were performed on a DSC8500. Absorption spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U-3010 UV-vis spectrophotometer. The film on quartz used for UV measurements was prepared by spin-coating with chloroform solution. The electrochemical cyclic voltammogram was obtained using a Zahner IM6e electrochemical workstation in a 0.1 mol L−1 tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (Bu4NPF6) acetonitrile solution. A Pt electrode coated with the sample film was used as the working electrode; a Pt wire and Ag/AgCl (0.01 M AgCl in acetonitrile) were used as the counter and reference electrodes, respectively.
OSCs were fabricated in the configuration of the traditional sandwich structure with an ITO positive electrode and a metal negative electrode. Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 30 Ω □−1 was purchased from CSG Holding Co., Ltd (China). The ITO glass was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath of acetone and isopropanol and treated by UVO (ultraviolet ozone cleaner, Jelight Company, USA). Then a thin layer (30 nm) of PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate)) (Baytron PVP A1 4083, Germany) was spin-coated on the ITO glass. Then, the photoactive layer was prepared by spin-coating the blend solution of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID, BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID and PC71BM (different weight ratio) on the top of the PEDOT:PSS layer and baked at 80 °C for 0.5 h, respectively. The concentration of the solution was 10 mg mL−1 in chloroform. Finally, a metal electrode layer of Al was vacuum evaporated on the photoactive layer under a shadow mask in a vacuum of ca. 10−4 Pa. The current–voltage (I–V) measurements of the devices were conducted on a computer-controlled Keithley 236 Source Measure Unit. A xenon lamp coupled with AM 1.5 solar spectrum filters was used as the light source, and the optical power at the sample was ca. 100 mW cm−2.

Results and discussion
Synthesis
In Scheme 1, the structures and the synthetic routes of the new compounds BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID are shown. Monomers 1, 2 and 3 were obtained according to the literature.45–47 Compounds 4 and 5 were synthesized from monomers 1, 2 and 3 through the Suzuki reaction with a yield of 41.3% and 52.3%, respectively. Finally, BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID were prepared by Knoevenagel condensation of 1,3-indenedione with the corresponding aldehyde derivatives. Both BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID are soluble in common organic solvents, such as chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and toluene. But BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID shows better solubility compared with BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID.
Thermal stability
To make sure that BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID are stable enough for applications in photovoltaic solar cells, TGA investigations were carried out under nitrogen. As shown in Fig. 1, 5% weight loss for BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID occurs at 320 °C and 270 °C, respectively, which indicates that these two compounds are stable for device applications. Both BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID exhibit no apparent DSC peaks (ESI Fig. S1†), which demonstrates that the materials do not show any crystallization behavior.

Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID in solutions and solid films are shown in Fig. 2. The absorption spectrum of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID solution shows two absorption peaks at 420 and 536 nm, respectively, covering a broad wavelength range from 350 nm to 650 nm, which benefits from the A–D–A molecular structure. The maximum visible absorption peak is attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer transition between the BDT unit and ID unit. The absorption spectrum of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID solution shows similar properties. The molar absorbance is 1.01 × 105 for BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and 1.16 × 105 for BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID, which are among the high molar absorbances of photovoltaic materials. The absorption spectra of the BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID films cover a broad wavelength range from 400 nm to 750 nm and both are red shifted compared with the solution absorbance, which result from the aggregation of the molecules in the film state. The absorption edge of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID films is at ca. 790 nm and ca. 750 nm, corresponding to the band gap of 1.53 eV and 1.61 eV, respectively. The detailed optical data of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID are listed in Table 1. Compared with that of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID, the absorption peak of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID is red-shifted by ca. 20 nm in solution, the absorption edge of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID is blue-shifted by ca. 40 nm in films, and the molar absorbance of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID is a little higher, owing to the different substituent positions of the side alkyl chains in the molecular structure. These results indicate that the alkyl side chains concentrated in the central part of the terthiophene backbone (BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID) are beneficial for the aggregation of the molecules in the film state, and the chains distributed in the peripheral part of the terthiophene backbone (BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID) are good for the intramolecular charge transfer transition.

HOMO and LUMO energy levels
Electrochemical cyclic voltammetry of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID films on the Pt electrode was carried out and the results are shown in Fig. 3(a). The onset oxidation and reduction potentials (Eoxonset, Eredonset) of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID were measured to be 0.95 and −0.67 V vs. Ag/AgCl. The HOMO energy level (EHOMO), the LUMO energy level (ELUMO) and the electrochemical band gap (Eg) of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID were calculated to be −5.35, −3.73 and 1.62 eV, respectively, according to the following equations:48EHOMO = −e(Eoxonset + 4.40) (eV), ELUMO = −e(Eredonset + 4.40) (eV) and Eg = ELUMO − EHOMO. For BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID, the Eoxonset and Eredonset were measured to be 0.85 and −0.75 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Thus EHOMO, ELUMO and Eg of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID were estimated to be −5.25, −3.62 and 1.63 eV, respectively. The electrochemical band gaps of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID are coincident with the optical measurements with a reasonable margin of error. Compared with the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of PC71BM,49 the two compounds are appropriate to be used as photovoltaic donor materials. From the energy levels of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID (Fig. 3(b)), it can be seen that the different substituent positions of the side alkyl chains also affect the electrochemical properties of the compounds. The results indicate that the inward configuration of the alkyl side chains in BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID is advantageous for lowering the HOMO energy level, which may lead to a higher Voc. However in the photovoltaic device, the lower HOMO energy didn't result in an expected larger Voc. Probably, the rougher film morphology of the photoactive layer, hole mobility of the material, or higher energy loss26 influenced the Voc. The Eoxonset, Eredonset, ELUMO and EHOMO values of the compounds are also listed in Table 1.

Photovoltaic properties of OSCs
Bulk-heterojunction OSCs with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer/Al structure were fabricated by using BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID or BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID as the donor material, PC71BM as the acceptor50–52 with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1.5:1, w/w, and Al as the negative electrode. The typical current–voltage curves of the OSCs in the dark and under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4. The photovoltaic performance data of the OSCs are summarized in Table 2. The OSC device based on BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID demonstrated a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 8.82 mA cm−2, and a FF of 68.9%, corresponding to a PCE of 5.30%, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2. At the same time, the photovoltaic performance of the OSC based on BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID showed a Voc of 0.75 V, a Jsc of 4.0 mA cm−2, and a FF of 35.3%, corresponding to a PCE of 1.06%, under the same experimental conditions. Obviously, the peripherally distributed side chains in BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID play an important role in the much better photovoltaic performance. Upon optimization of the OSC device by changing the donor/acceptor weight ratio from 1.5:1 to 1.25:1, the device based on BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID shows similar results, but the device based on BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID shows better results: a Voc of 0.87 V, a Jsc of 10.54 mA cm−2, and a FF of 71.4%, corresponding to a PCE of 6.55%, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2.

Morphology
To investigate the evidence of the big difference in photovoltaic properties between BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID, we utilize an atomic force microscope (AFM) to investigate the morphology of blend films composed of the molecular material and PC71BM (the weight ratio is the same as that of the best device). For the photovoltaic performance of OSCs, the morphology of the photoactive layer is very significant.53,54 All of the AFM images of the blend films are shown in Fig. 5. Both of the films exhibit a typical amorphous morphology without any crystalline domains. We can see intuitively that the surface of the blend film of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID/PC71BM is more neat, which will be beneficial for the charge separation and charge transport in the OSC devices. However, the blend film of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID/PC71BM exhibits a rougher morphology and big aggregates, which could negatively influence the charge separation and the charge transport.
 Fig. 5  Atomic force microscopy images of molecules: PC71BM films spin-coated from the blend solutions: (A) BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID/PC71BM (1.5:1, w/w) and (B) BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID/PC71BM (1.25:1, w/w). The scan size for all images is 2 μm × 2 μm. 
Conclusions
Two new A–D–A molecules with bithienyl-substituted benzodithiophene (BDT) as the core and donor unit, indenedione (ID) as the end group and acceptor unit, 3,3′′-dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3T(3-Hex)) or 4,4′′-dihexyl-2,2′:5′,2′′-terthiophene (3T(4-Hex)) as the π bridge, BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID, were designed and synthesized. Compared with that of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID, the absorption peak of the BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID is red shifted by ca. 20 nm in solution, the molar absorbance is higher and the AFM image shows a better morphology, benefitting from the outward alkyl side chain. All these superior properties contribute to the outstanding PCE of the OSC based on the blend of BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID and PC71BM (1.25:1, w/w), reaching 6.55% with a Jsc of 10.54 mA cm−2 and a Voc of 0.87 V, under the illumination of AM 1.5, 100 mW cm−2, while the PCE of the OSC based on BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID as the donor material is 1.06% under the similar experimental conditions. There is just a tiny change in the substituent position of the side alkyl chains in the molecular structure of BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID, but the BDT-3T(3-Hex)-ID and BDT-3T(4-Hex)-ID show a great difference in the absorption properties, the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, especially the performance of the OSC device and the AFM images. Distributing alkyl side chains in the peripheral part of the π bridge backbone to form an outward configuration is a profitable strategy to achieve a competitive OSC performance in the BDT-ID system. This work contributes to a better understanding of the structure–property relationship in organic photovoltaic materials.
