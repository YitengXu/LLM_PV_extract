    , Accepted 9th June 2014First published on 10th June 2014AbstractA simple reduction method without the need for high-temperature annealing is proposed for highly conductive and dispersible graphene sheets. This method consists of the grafting of graphene oxide (GO) with 1-pyrenecarboxylic acid (PCA) and the exothermic reduction of the PCA-grafted GO, followed by an endothermic decarboxylation with refluxing hot water. The PCA-grafted reduced graphene oxide (PCA-rGO) has a high conductivity of ∼1.52 × 105 S m−1. Upon incorporating the rGO-PCA in active and electron transport layers of organic solar cells, compared to P3HT-only devices (0.18%) a 16-fold increase in the power conversion efficiency (2.85%) is obtained, attributed to a substantial increase in the short-circuit current density from 0.017 to 12.09 mA cm−2.
Production of highly dispersible and conductive graphene sheets is crucial for practical device applications. Various methods such as mechanical cleavage,1 liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE),2 chemical vapor deposition,3,4 thermal de-oxygenation,5 and solution-based chemical reduction (SCR)6 are reported for the production of graphene. Among them, LPE and SCR are considered to be the most promising methods for large-scale production of graphene. However, the LPE method suffers from low conductivity and aggregation due to the hydrophilic nature and strong intersheet van der Waals forces which minimize the surface free energy. To overcome the solubility problem, stabilizers including surfactants, polymers, π–π stacking molecules and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are generally used.7–11 However, such study still lacks a comprehensive study in terms of both electrical conductivity and solubility. In the SCR method the starting material is graphene oxide (GO) produced by the Hummers method,12 which retains many defects and functional groups such as epoxy and hydroxyl groups on the basal planes and carboxylic acid groups at the edges.13,14 Thus the SCR includes deoxygenation and dehydration, but it also suffers from low conductivity and solubility. Furthermore, in order to restore the π-grafted structure and attain high conductivity, high temperature annealing at ∼1000 °C is required after chemical reduction.12,13 Hence, the improvement of electrical conductivity while retaining its fundamental molecular frames, the chemical modification of GO is necessary to remove the functional groups and to heal the C-sp3 hybrid to C-sp2. In such a context, many groups have reported the reduction of GO by alkaline solution,13 hydrazine or dimethylhydrazine,15,16 vitamin-C,17 and hydroxylamine,18 but still suffer from agglomeration and simultaneous dispersion and conductivity problems.
Recently, several research groups reported utilization of reduced graphene or its derivatives in P3HT-based organic solar cells,19–28 but the device efficiency is still low. Furthermore, the energy level difference of the donor and acceptor materials of the graphene-based system does not match well as in the other carbon-based materials. A comprehensive study on the design of graphene-based materials in P3HT-based organic solar cells is still needed with manipulating band gaps and optimizing active and electron transport layers to enhance charge separation and conduction.
In this work, for highly conductive and dispersible graphene sheets we propose a simple low-temperature reduction method of PCA-grafted graphene oxide (PCA-GO) without high-temperature annealing (Scheme S1 in ESI†). This method consists of the direct functionalization of the GO with PCA and the reduction of the PCA-GO with a minimal quantity of hydrazine (N2H4) and the decarboxylation and decarbonylation by NaOH with refluxing hot water (100 °C). This low-temperature process yields highly soluble graphene sheets having a highest conductivity of ∼1.52 × 105 S m−1. The reduced PCA-GO (i.e., PCA-rGO) has been further examined for better performance of P3HT-based solar cells by incorporating it into the active layer and electron transport layer.
In order to elucidate the effects of chemistry and thermal treatment upon removal of functional groups, four different reduction schemes have been examined (see Table S1 in ESI†); the reduction of PCA-GO with N2H4 (125 μL) at RT for 24 h, followed by NaOH (20 mg) treatment at RT for 1 h and refluxing at 100 °C for 1 h (S1, we call this scheme ‘standard’), the reduction of GO with N2H4 (125 μL) at RT for 24 h, followed by NaOH (20 mg) treatment at RT for 1 h and refluxing at 100 °C for 1 h (S2), the reduction of PCA-GO with N2H4 (125 μL) at RT for 24 h, followed by refluxing at 100 °C for 1 h (S3), and the reduction of PCA-GO with N2H4 (125 μL) at RT for 24 h, followed by NaOH (20 mg) treatment at RT for 1 h without refluxing (S4). Details of the experiment and characterization are described in the Experimental in ESI.†
Raman spectra from the samples of rGO, examined by the four different reduction schemes, showed that reduction schemes S1 and S3 show the lowest ratio of I(D)/I(G), but S2 and S4 exhibit a considerably high ratio of I(D)/I(G) (Fig. S1(a) and (b) in ESI†). This result concludes that the PCA grafting and refluxing are remarkably effective for removing the functional groups and healing the graphene layers. Furthermore, from the 2D-band spectra the scheme S4 shows the lowest intensity compared to schemes S1–S3, indicating that refluxing is important for controlling the number of layers or decoupling the effects of layers from each layer. The surface chemistry of the S1–S4 samples analyzed by XPS (Fig. S1(c) and (d) in ESI†) shows that the C 1s XPS spectra of all the samples exhibit the same oxygen functionalities, i.e., C–O (286.6 eV), CO (288.0 eV) and O–CO (294.2 eV) groups. The XPS analysis reveals that the deoxygenation with NaOH under refluxing is effective to eliminate hydroxyl and carboxyl groups. The C 1s peak of the CC bond in Fig. S1(d) (ESI†) has the highest intensity in the standard scheme S1 (i.e., with PCA grafting) compared to the broad and low intensity peak in scheme S2 (i.e., without PCA grafting). It concludes that PCA grafting has a key role to restore the conjugated structure of graphene sheets. This remarkable effect is connected to the dipole nature of the PCA molecule (see Discussion in ESI†).

Fig. 1 shows the solubility of rGO/PCA, produced by the standard scheme S1 (top). The dispersion stability maintained for several weeks, indicating that the proposed reduction method is superior to other known methods. Fig. 1 also displays the TEM and high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the rGO for the cases without (a and b) and with (c and d) PCA grafting. The TEM image of rGO without PCA grafting presents a three layer stack of graphene sheets (i.e., white (1L), grey (2L) and dark grey (3L) corresponding to different numbers of layers of sheet, a). The HRTEM image of rGO taken from the wrinkle in the selected area of 3L (red square) shows an interlayer spacing of 0.36 nm (b). The SAED pattern in (b) clearly indicates the graphitic crystalline structure. Interestingly, the relative intensity of the inner and outer rings consisting of six circle spots is the same, but each spot commands three dots indicating 3 layers of graphene. The TEM (c) and HRTEM (d) images of PCA-rGO reveal that the graphene sheets are folded and/or superimposed and the π-grafted surface of PCA makes the interlayer spacing of rGO wider (0.43 nm) than that of the rGO without PCA grafting (i.e., 0.36 nm). PCA is considered as a miniaturized GO structure having a carboxylic group as shown in the inset of Fig. 1(c). The π–π interaction between the planar surfaces of PCA and graphene increases the surface affinity and reduces the surface energy of dispersion.

The insets of (b) and (d) show the corresponding SAED patterns taken from the selected areas (red squares) in (a) and (c), respectively. 

Fig. 2 shows Raman and XPS spectra of PCA-rGO samples with different PCA loadings. The amount of PCA adsorbed on rGO (5 mg) was varied from 2.5 to 10 mg PCA. The ratio of I(D)/I(G) of resulting PCA-rGO decreases substantially upon increasing the loading of PCA (inset in Fig. 2, top). It is also observed that a blue shift of ∼19 cm−1 in the G-band is induced with more loading of PCA, which is attributed to weakening of the double bonds by PCA grafting. Furthermore, in the 2D band a blue shift was also observed from 2709 to 2646 cm−1, which reflects the high dispersion of resultant graphene sheets. The PCA molecules are adsorbed on a π-electron network and form hydrogen bonds through its carboxyl groups with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups on GO. The hydrogen bonding was confirmed trough FTIR spectra with observation of a shift in the absorption peak related to O–H, CO bonds to lower wavelengths after PCA grafting (see Fig. S2 in ESI†). The dipole nature of the molecules also draws and immobilizes the cloud of resonance π-electrons on the GO sheet. Hence, PCA helps the electrons to be available for p-orbital bonding of π-bonds to transfer from C-sp3 to C-sp2 hybridizations. The incorporation of PCA and restoration of CC bonds is confirmed by the XPS spectra of the rGO produced by scheme S2 and the PCA-rGO by the standard scheme S1 (Fig. 2, bottom). The rGO shows three separated peaks due to oxygen functionalities, i.e. sp2 C at 284.9 eV and small peaks at 286.7 and 288.3 eV attributed to the O-sp2 C and O-sp3 C bonds, respectively, originating from functional groups and/or defects. After the standard reduction scheme S1, the CC bonds dominate with diminishing of the C–OH and CO bonds with grafting but gradual increase of the peak of –COOH at 292.85 eV due to increasing the loading of PCA.

Fig. 3 shows comparative plots of lnJ (J, current density) vs. E as a function of PCA loading and temperature. Compared to the current density of pristine GO (∼0.04 mA cm−2), the PCA-rGO sample exhibits a significant increase in current density (i.e., ∼87 mA cm−2) at 10 V (a). The conductivity of PCA-rGO increases linearly with the loading of PCA from 56.9 S m−1 with GO to 1.52 × 105 S m−1 with rGO(5 mg)/PCA(10 mg) (Fig. 3(b), also see Fig. S3 in ESI†). This linear increase in conductivity confirms that the restoring of the π-conjugated system is attributed to the incorporation of PCA. The conductivities of the products of each reduction step are also measured and are summarized in Scheme S1 in ESI.† The conductivities obtained are 56.9 S m−1 for GO, 468.5 S m−1 for PCA-grafted GO, 1.0 × 104 S m−1 after hydrazine reduction and 1.52 × 105 S m−1 after NaOH treatment with refluxing hot water. The conductivity of the final product (1.52 × 105 S m−1) is four orders of magnitude higher than that of the original GO, reflecting the efficient restoration of the well-connected conjugated system assisted by the PCA grafting. The effect of temperature on the electrical conductivity of rGO(5 mg)/PCA(5 mg) was examined in the range of 25–200 °C and showed a linear relationship (Fig. 3(c)). The linear variation of lnJ0 (J0, saturation current density) with 1/T (T in K) yielded an activation energy of ∼0.71 eV (inset of c). Table S2 in ESI† summarizes the comparison of conductivity between the previously reported and the as-obtained in this work. The present work shows the best result overall in terms of high conductivity (1.52 × 105 S m−1), low temperature (i.e., 100 °C) and reduction under mild conditions.

In order to examine the potential of as-obtained PCA-rGO photovoltaic devices, we fabricated five inverted solar cells incorporating the PCA-rGO in the active and/or electron transport layer (ETL). In addition, to design the energy-band diagrams, the work functions of GO, PCA-rGO and ZnO/PCA-rGO films were measured to be 4.6, 4.3 and 4.4 eV, respectively (see Fig. S4 in ESI†). Table 1 summarizes the device structures and the photovoltaic properties of five different cells (D1 to D5) in which rGO and PCA-rGO are incorporated in the cells. Compared to the control cell of P3HT only (D1), device D2 and D3 incorporate rGO and PCA-rGO, respectively, in the active layer of P3HT-based solar cells. To examine the potential of GO as the hole transport layer (HTL), the PEDOT:PSS layer in D3 is replaced with GO (D4). Furthermore, in addition to the D4 structure to improve electron transport we employed the PCA-rGO layer over ZnO for ETL (D5). Fig. 4 shows the inverted solar cell structure of D5 (a) and its energy level diagram (b), and the J–V plots of devices D1 to D5 (c). The ZnO/PCA-rGO substantially improves the interaction with the active layer of P3HT:PCA-rGO in device D5 because they have PCA-rGO in common. Compared to the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the P3HT-only device D1 (0.18%), much better performances were obtained with P3HT:rGO (0.7%, D2) and P3HT:PCA-rGO (1.17%, D3). The superior performance with the P3HT:PCA-rGO hybrid suggests that the PCA-rGO facilitates a fast separation of excitons and thus suppresses the recombination, attributed to its high conductivity of ∼1.52 × 105 S m−1. Furthermore, the replacement of HTL of PEDOT:PSS with GO (i.e., D4) results in an increase in PCE from 1.17% to 1.35%. This is attributed to a lower work function of GO (4.6 eV) than PEDOT:PSS (5.2 eV) and thus could form a good ohmic contact with Ag (4.2 eV). More importantly, a remarkable increase in PCE from 1.35% to 2.85% was obtained by applying the ZnO/PCA-rGO and GO for the ETL and HTL, respectively, in device D5. Compared to the P3HT-only device D1, the device D5 showed a substantial increase in Jsc from 0.017 to 12.09 mA cm−2 and thus in PCE from 0.18 to 2.85% (about 16-fold increase over D1), which is higher than that of the previously reported which incorporated covalently-doped graphene in the active layer.29–31 It is known that the PCE of polymer solar cells is quite dependent on the morphology of the active layer.32 The surface and interface morphologies of ITO/ZnO/P3HT:PCA-rGO/GO have been examined with FESEM images (see Fig. S5 in ESI†). The FESEM images show a smooth and uniform distribution of PCA-rGO in P3HT (inset) and a well-defined interface between GO and P3HT/PCA-rGO and ZnO layers without showing any vertical segregation and/or phase separation. These results indicate that the substantial increase in Jsc with P3HT/PCA-rGO is attributed to the incorporation of PCA-rGO in the active layer and the better alignment of electron bands revealed by work function study (see Fig. 4(b) and Fig. S4, ESI†). Hence, it is concluded that the highly conductive PCA-rGO in the active layer not only provides more conductive pathways for electron transfer but also facilitates fast separation of excitons.

In conclusion, for highly conductive and dispersible graphene sheets we developed a simple low-temperature reduction method of GO grafted by PCA. The reduction of PCA-grafted GO produced high quality graphene sheets with high solubility and conductivity (∼1.52 × 105 S m−1), confirming an efficient restoration of the conjugated system by PCA grafting. In the P3HT-based solar cells the work-function-tuned GO and ZnO/PCA-rGO were used to improve hole extraction and to effectively collect electrons at the cathode, respectively. Compared to the P3HT-only device D1, the device D5 showed a substantial increase in Jsc from 0.017 to 12.09 mA cm−2 and thus in PCE from 0.18 to 2.85%.
