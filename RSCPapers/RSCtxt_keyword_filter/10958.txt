    , Accepted 9th October 2021First published on 14th October 2021AbstractThe emergence of inorganic antimony (Sb)-based perovskite-inspired solar cells simultaneously overcomes the poor stability and toxicity of lead (Pb)-based perovskite solar cells. However, in addition to reducing the toxicity of the device itself, further reducing the toxicity in the preparation process is also a necessary condition for commercialization. Herein, different anti-solvents have been used to precisely regulate the nucleation process and improve the quality of the films. Among them, the film with green anisole as a novel anti-solvent shows a dense surface morphology with good crystallinity and presents better light absorption. As a reward, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the champion device can reach 2.07% with low-cost carbon electrodes, which is improved by 470% in comparison with 0.44% for the control device without anti-solvent, and it is one of the top values for inorganic antimony (Sb)-based perovskite-inspired solar cells. In addition, the device exhibits good thermal and air stability without humidity control. This work will provide a new way to prepare highly efficient lead-free antimony-based perovskite-inspired solar cells.
Introduction
In recent years, perovskite solar cells have received widespread attention due to their low cost, simple fabrication process and excellent performance. The champion PCE has increased from 3.8% to more than 25.2% now.1–3 However, most high-efficient perovskite solar cells have organic cations, which will result in relatively poor thermal stability. In addition, the toxicity of Pb in perovskite solar cells can cause environmental pollution and hinder the commercialization process of perovskite solar cells.4–8 Therefore, research on inorganic lead-free perovskite solar cells is very urgently required.
Some lead-free perovskite materials have already been studied. The divalent tin cation (Sn2+) has similarity with the divalent lead cation (Pb2+) in terms of size and valence shell,9 so Sn can be used to fabricate perovskite films instead of Pb. But Sn2+ can be easily oxidized to Sn4+ in an atmospheric environment. This will result in increased film defects and decreased device efficiency.10 Except for metastable Sn2+, trivalent antimony and bismuth cations (Sb3+ and Bi3+) also have similar electronic configurations to Pb2+ and are not easily oxidized in an atmospheric environment.11,12 Therefore, substitution of Pb-based perovskites with inorganic Sb-based or Bi-based perovskite-inspired materials may be a better choice to overcome the poor stability and toxicity of Pb-based perovskite solar cells.
It is known that Sb-based perovskite derivatives will form two different structures (0D and 2D structures) under different preparation conditions.13,14 Regarding the A–Sb–XS structure, the perovskite-inspired materials formed by combining Sb2X93− and Cs+ will form a 2D structure through treatment at a temperature of ≥230 °C.15 Compared to 0D structural inorganic perovskite-inspired materials, the 2D structure of the perovskite-inspired materials has a smaller optical band gap and a lower exciton binding energy, and the photovoltaic performance of the corresponding device is better.14,15 Peng et al.16 explored the comparative experiment of 2D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x and 0D-Cs3Sb2I9, and found that 2D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x has a smaller direct optical band gap (2.05 eV). Besides, chloride incorporation promotes larger grain growth, and passivates deep level electronic defects within the grains.17 After 2D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x is integrated into the device, the photovoltaic performance is also greatly increased. Mei et al.11 explored the comparative experiment of 2D-Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x and 2D-Rb3Sb2I9. The direct optical band gap of 2D-Rb3Sb2I9 was obtained as 2.24 eV, which is closer to the direct optical band gap14 of 0D-Cs3Sb2I9. In addition, the inorganic structure has thermodynamic advantages compared to 2D-MA3Sb2ClxI9−x.19
At present, the performance of Sb-based perovskite-inspired solar cells is relatively limited.20 It is well known that the preparation of high-quality perovskite films is important to achieve high-performance perovskite solar cells. The anti-solvent assisted crystallization method is one of the methods that improve the quality of the film. The anti-solvent crystallization technology was originally widely used in the pharmaceutical industry.21 The solute in the original solvent becomes relatively insoluble by adding an anti-solvent, thereby precipitating the drug. Similarly, when the anti-solvent is added to the perovskite layer, the solubility of the precursor solution is reduced, so that the solute is quickly separated from the solution to form a high coverage and a smooth dense film. Therefore, the anti-solvent-assisted crystallization method is explored to prepare high-quality films.22–25 The suitable choice of anti-solvent is very important to determine whether a highly uniform, pinhole-free perovskite film can be produced. So far, anti-solvent engineering has been widely used in the preparation of Pb-based perovskite solar cells. For instance, Zheng et al.26 used toluene as an anti-solvent to fabricate Pb-based perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 8.29%. Jin et al.27 used a mixed anti-solvent of phthalocyanine nickel and chlorobenzene to prepare Pb-based perovskite solar cells and achieved a PCE of 19.18%. Liu et al.28 used o-dichlorobenzene (o-PhCl2) as an anti-solvent to prepare Pb-based perovskite solar cells with a PCE of 20.72%.
Several attempts have also been made towards anti-solvents in inorganic antimony-based perovskite-inspired solar cells and some achievements have been achieved. Umar et al.29 used isopropyl alcohol as an anti-solvent to prepare Sb-based inorganic perovskite-inspired solar cells with a structure of FTO/TiO2/Cs3Sb2I9/Au and achieved a PCE of 1.21%. Peng et al.15 used toluene as an anti-solvent to fabricate antimony-based inorganic perovskite-inspired solar cells with a structure of FTO/TiO2/Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x/LZ-HTL-1-1/Au, and achieved a PCE of 2.15%. However, some anti-solvents such as toluene and chlorobenzene have certain toxicity, especially chlorobenzene, which does serious harm to the soil, atmosphere and drinking water.30–34 Besides, Sb-based perovskite derivatives already offer a concrete opportunity for commercialization as absorbers for indoor photovoltaics, and this situation requires the research community to urgently address the toxicity issues associated with their preparation processing.16 With the application of green anti-solvents, the impact of the preparation method on the environmental pollution will be minimized.35,36
Here, we report a facile strategy to improve the quality of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x perovskite-inspired films using a green anti-solvent assisted method. And given the remaining toxicity in the precursor solution, such as dimethylformamide, further work is still underway to completely solve the toxicity in the whole solution preparation process. Compared to the film with chlorobenzene or isopropyl alcohol as an anti-solvent, the film with green anisole as an anti-solvent shows a denser surface morphology with better crystallinity and presents better light absorption. In order to decrease the consumption of the whole device preparation process, low-cost carbon-based devices were assembled with a structure of FTO/Nb2O5/Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x/P3HT/carbon. The champion device with anisole as a green anti-solvent has a relatively high PCE of 2.07%. This is much superior to Sb-based perovskite-inspired solar cells prepared with chlorobenzene or isopropyl alcohol as an anti-solvent. This inorganic Sb-based device also shows good stability under long-term storage and heating conditions.
Results and discussion
As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), the situation about adding the anti-solvent at different times has been taken into account and the optimized drop-time has been obtained. The process of fabricating an Sb-based perovskite-inspired film with an anti-solvent is shown in Fig. 1. The anti-solvent assisted method can efficiently improve the nuclear process and heighten the final film surface. The method of High Temperature Vapor Annealing (HTVA) is introduced in the annealing step.18 The melting point of SbI3 is relatively low (170 °C at atmospheric pressure), and its gas pressure is considerable at temperatures above 200 °C.37,38 Therefore, SbI3 in the gas phase (≥200 °C) can prevent the Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film from losing SbI3.18,39 In order to further explore the effects of the various anti-solvents on the morphologies of the perovskite-inspired films, the surface morphologies of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x perovskite-inspired films with anisole, isopropyl alcohol and chlorobenzene as anti-solvents were studied. SEM images of the corresponding films before annealing are shown in Fig. 2(a–c). Except for the film made by anisole, the films made by other anti-solvents have shown various degrees of voids before annealing. After annealing, the same phenomenon can also be observed, and the film prepared using anisole shows the best film quality with better crystallinity and compact surface (as shown in Fig. 2(e–g)).40,41 Micron-sized voids are formed on the surface of the film without adding an anti-solvent, which severely reduces the carrier transport ability (as shown in Fig. 2(d) and (h)).

XRD patterns were measured to study the crystal structures of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films prepared using different anti-solvents. The main peaks of the films fabricated with several different anti-solvents were at around 25.8°, 30.0° and 42.7° (as shown in Fig. 3(a)), which correspond to the (201), (022) and (220) planes of the 2D Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x perovskite-inspired structure.15 The XRD peak of the (201) plane in the Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film with anisole is much greater than that of isopropyl alcohol or chlorobenzene. This result suggests that the use of anisole can effectively increase the crystalline of the Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film and offer more efficient charge collection in the final device. PL spectra were further recorded to study the photogenerated carrier recombination process in Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x films with different anti-solvents. The Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film fabricated using anisole shows the best PL intensity, which indicates that the film has the least non-radiative recombination and the best film quality (as shown in Fig. 3(b)).11,42 The PL spectrum of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x prepared using anisole is deconvolved into three Gaussian bands (as shown in Fig. 3(c)). The three emission peaks are respectively at 1.40 eV, 1.72 eV and 1.99 eV. The three peaks respectively correspond to defect-assisted emission, STE Emission and band edge emission. STE emission dominates the PL spectra. The band edge emission and defect-assisted emission are auxiliary pathways. Different recombination pathways for excitons are shown in Fig. 3(d).43,44 The absorption spectra of perovskite-inspired films prepared using different anti-solvents are also presented in Fig. 3(e). It can be observed that the Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film with anisole as the anti-solvent has the highest absorption intensity, which can improve the light utilization rate. Therefore, the short current density (JSC) of the devices made using anisole will also increase. In addition, the initial absorption wavelength of all films is about 600 nm with a calculated bandgap of 2.07 eV (as seen in Fig. 3(f)). The band gap value is close to the value reported by the relevant literature (2.05 eV).15 The slight difference in band gap values may be attributed to the different contents of chlorine in the Cs3Sb2I9−xClx film, as reported by Paul et al.17 Moreover, the best bandgap of semiconductor materials suitable for indoor light collection is around 1.9 eV, which indicates the potential of Sb-based perovskite-inspired materials in indoor photovoltaic applications.16,45

The schematic structure and cross-sectional SEM image of perovskite-inspired solar cells are respectively shown in Fig. 4(a) and Fig. S2 (ESI†). The champion J–V curves and characteristics of perovskite-inspired solar cells prepared using different anti-solvents are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 4(b). The Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x solar cell without an anti-solvent has a relatively low PCE of 0.44% with an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.77 V, a JSC of 1.14 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 0.51 (as shown in Table 1). When a Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film was fabricated using chlorobenzene as the anti-solvent, the JSC of the device significantly increases to 3.18 mA cm−2 and the PCE increases to 0.44%. When the anti-solvent is replaced with isopropyl alcohol, the JSC and PCE can increase to 3.92 mA cm−2 and 1.48%, respectively. Furthermore, the device with anisole as an anti-solvent could result in the highest VOC value of 0.84 and the FF has also increased to 0.55, presumably due to the enhanced film quality of the anisole treated Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film. In addition, a comparative experiment with DMF and DMSO as solvents was also carried out, and the measurement results are shown in Table S1 (ESI†). The results have proved that the performance of the devices prepared using DMF as the solvent is better. The J–V curves and statistical characteristics are respectively shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†). Therefore, a relatively high PCE of 2.07% can be achieved. Compared with a champion PCE of Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x solar cells reported by Peng et al.16 (2.15%) and Paul et al.17 (2.2%), our result shows a little PCE loss due to the minimum JSC, as seen in Table 2. The JSC loss can be mainly attributed to the decreased optical reflection when a low-cost carbon electrode was used to replace the metal electrode. Thus, further work still needs to be carried out to improve the PCE of carbon based Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x solar cells by increasing the optical reflection between the light-absorber layer and the carbon electrode.

Shunt conductance (G) is an important parameter for measuring the absorber layer film quality in solar cells. The corresponding G can be calculated according to the relationship between the output current (J) and output voltage (V) of thin-film solar cells:46  where the leakage current density and diode ideal factor are respectively represented by J0 and A; JL represents the photocurrent density; the series resistance and parallel resistance are represented by R and 1/G, respectively; q represents the amount of charge of the electron; k and T are respectively represented by a Boltzmann constant and thermodynamic temperature. Fig. S5 (ESI†) shows the value of G and the device with anisole as an anti-solvent shows the lowest G value, indicating superior device performance. The IPCE spectra of the devices with different anti-solvents are shown in Fig. 4(c). The device fabricated using anisole exhibits a higher integrated current density than devices prepared using other anti-solvents, which is in accordance with J–V results. In order to evaluate the reproducibility, the statistical characteristics of the devices of the perovskite-inspired absorber layer prepared using different anti-solvents were measured and are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4(d). The devices using anisole as the anti-solvent film showed significantly improved J–V parameters with an average PCE of 1.91%, which is much higher than the devices fabricated using other anti-solvents. J–V curves of forward and reverse scans are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†). The device exhibits a measure of hysteresis, which may be due to the unbalanced carrier extraction in a planar device structure.
The Nyquist spectrum of the device is shown in Fig. 5(a). The semi-circular shape shown in the figure is reported as a typical p–n junction.45 It can be seen from Table 3 that the Rrec value of the device prepared with anisole is the highest, followed by isopropyl alcohol, and that of chlorobenzene is the lowest. A higher Rrec value indicates less recombination across the circuit. The use of anisole greatly reduces the carrier recombination ability, and therefore the PCE of the device was greatly improved. Fig. 5(b) shows the long-term stability measured at room temperature without controlling the environmental humidity. The PCE of the device fabricated without anti-solvents decreased quickly while the PCE of the device fabricated with anisole only decreased by 25% in the past 240 hours, which showed good air stability on the contrary. The thermal stability of the corresponding device has also been tested by heating for 7 hours at 100 °C continuously. As shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†), the efficiency of the device prepared using anisole can be maintained above 93%, which also shows good thermal stability.

Conclusions
In summary, we have conducted a detailed strategy to control the fabrication process of a Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film and improve the corresponding device performance. In order to improve the quality of the film, the influence of different anti-solvents on film formation was explored. Compared with other commonly used anti-solvents, the film prepared using anisole has better crystalline quality, denser surface morphology and inhibited recombination possibility, which improve the carrier transport ability and the final PCE of the perovskite-inspired solar cell. With low-cost carbon as the electrode, a champion PCE of 2.07% can be obtained with good device air/thermal stability. In conclusion, this work proposed a simple, green and repeatable method for the fabrication of Pb-free perovskite or perovskite-inspired films, and their photovoltaic devices.
Experimental
Materials
All chemicals were used as received without further purification. CsI (99.9%), SbI3 (98%) and SbCl3 (99.95%) were bought from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) (99.8%) was purchased from Alfa Aesar. Anisole (99%), isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (99.5%) and chlorobenzene (99%) were purchased from MACKLIN. P3HT (Mw 100000) and carbon paste (MTW-CE-C-003) were respectively brought from Sigma-Aldrich and Shanghai MaterWin New Materials Co., Ltd.
Cs3Sb2ClxI9−x film deposition
Firstly, CsI (0.75 M), SbI3 (0.25 M) and SbCl3 (0.3125 M) were mixed in DMF and stirred at 70 °C for 3 hours then filtered. Next, the precursor solution was dripped onto a substrate and spin-coated for 30 s at 3000 rpm. About 8 seconds after the start of spin coating, 65 μL of chlorobenzene, isopropyl alcohol and anisole were dispensed on the substrates. Then, the samples were moved to a closed glass jar containing 10 μL of SbI3 DMF solution and annealed for 10 minutes at 240 °C.
Solar cell device fabrication
Firstly, a glass substrate with FTO was sonicated in deionized water, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, ethanol and deionized water for 15 minutes. Then, the substrate was treated with UV-ozone for 10 minutes. Next, Nb2O5 films were sputtered from a Nb2O5 ceramic target (Jiangxi Ketai Advanced Materials, 99%) with 5 × 10−4 Pa base pressure. A radio frequency magnetron sputtering system (Beijing Technol Science, JCP-450) was used for deposition with 150 W RF power and 0.2 Pa work pressure.47 Next, the prepared substrates were annealed at 500 °C for 30 min. After the substrates were cooled down, the substrates were treated with UV-ozone for 10 minutes. The substrates were transferred to a nitrogen-filled glove box to deposit perovskite-inspired films. Then, the hole transport layer was prepared by using the configured P3HT solution (6 mg mL−1 chlorobenzene solution) on the sample at 3000 rpm for 60 s. Finally, carbon paste was screen printed and annealed on a heating stage at 120 °C for 15 min. The active area of the fabricated device is 0.09 cm2.
Characterization
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the perovskite-inspired films fabricated using different anti-solvents were recorded with CuKα radiation using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance). The optical properties of the films in the wavelength range of 300–800 nm were measured using an ultraviolet-visible-near infrared spectrophotometer (Cary5000). The photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the films was recorded using a fluorescence spectrophotometer (LabRAM HR 800 UV) with an excitation source of 532 nm. The electron microscopy image of the films was obtained using a field emission scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-4800). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of photovoltaic devices were measured under AM 1.5G simulated solar illumination (100 mW cm−2) using a Keithley 2400 digital source meter. The J–V measurement speed is 100 mV s−1, and the scanning direction is reverse. Considering the uncertainty of the experimental apparatus, the measured VOC, JSC, and PCE values may have a certain error. Therefore, performance parameters from the calibrated solar cells are given in Table S2 (ESI†) to reflect the possible uncertainty. The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) system (TLS1509, Zolix) was used to acquire the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of various perovskite-inspired solar cells in AC mode. The electrochemical impedance spectra were recorded using an electrochemical workstation (EC-lab, Bio-Logic VMP3) with AC perturbation at 0.8 V under dark conditions.
