    , Accepted 17th July 2017First published on 17th July 2017AbstractIn this paper, systematic investigations on the fabrication and characterization of high performance TiO2 nanorod array perovskite solar cells (NAPSCs) are reported. The TiO2 nanorods, of length around 350–400 nm, were grown by solvothermal technique directly on glass/FTO substrates. From the scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) we demonstrate that excellent crystallinity for the TiO2 nanorods can be produced using the solvothermal technique. Precursor consisting of a mixture of PbI2, CH3NH3I (MAI) and CH3NH3Cl (MACl) was used for the growth of perovskite thin films on the glass/FTO/TiO2 nanorod array (TiO2-NA) substrates. It is found that the morphology and quality of the perovskite layer depend strongly on the concentration of MACl in the precursor. Experimental studies on femtosecond transient absorption (fs-TA) indicate that the incorporation of TiO2-NA greatly enhances the collection efficiency of the photo-generated carriers due to substantial increase of interfacial area between the perovskite and TiO2-NA, leading to a reduction in carrier diffusion distance. It is shown to be the key factor that the proposed technique facilitates the use of a thicker perovskite absorber layer (∼500 nm) without compromising on the series resistance. Detailed J–V characterization shows that the NAPSCs exhibit negligible hysteresis with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) >19% for the champion device.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic metal halide perovskites have attracted worldwide attention for their potential applications in optoelectronics and particularly in photovoltaics (PV). Within a short period, since the first report on the utilization of perovskite nanodots as sensitizers in a photoelectrochemical cell, perovskite-based solar cells (PSCs) have shown a dramatic increase in the PCE that exceeded 22%.1,2 Such dramatic rise in the PCE is attributed to the extraordinary chemical and physical properties of the material such as an easily adjustable bandgap,3 high absorption coefficients,4 high charge carrier mobilities, long diffusion lengths,5 and small exciton binding energies.6
To date, three main configurations of PSCs have been studied extensively, namely, the planar structure (including the “inverted” configuration),7,8 mesoporous structure,9,10 and device structure based on vertically aligned nanorod arrays (NA).11,12 NAs have significant advantages for device performance, including a wide space for effective pore filling, a large surface area for carrier extraction, and a stabilized spatial distribution of straightforward nanochannels for electron transport.12–14 These factors will be beneficial to enhancing the extraction efficiency of photogenerated electrons and reducing the series resistance of the device. In addition, light scattering occurred amongst the NA15 is favorable to improving the photon absorption efficiency of the perovskite layer. This is a particularly important issue for CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPI)-based planar devices which typically exhibit lower extraction efficiencies compared to the mesoporous or NA based devices as the photo-generated carriers must diffuse across the entire thickness of the MAPI absorber to be collected by the electron transport layer (ETL).16,17 Furthermore, a thick absorber layer will result in a reduction in the fill factor (FF) due to the enhanced resistance of the device. Both these factors limit the thickness of the absorber and, thereby, resulting in a reduction in the short circuit current (Jsc).18–21 On the other hand, for the mesoporous devices, there are issues of the difficulty in pore filling and the convoluted charge transport pathways.22
Based on these considerations, it is believed that conflict between charge extraction and pore filling can be solved by using vertically aligned NA. However, the main problem that underlies the NA-based PSCs (NAPSCs) is the difficulty in growing high quality perovskite films on NA.23–29 The morphology of the perovskite films will be changed due to the substrate effects. Some of the narrow gaps between the nanorods will hinder the infiltration of the precursor solution during the spin-coating process, resulting in poor film morphology. Therefore, under the same film formation conditions, it is more difficult to grow high quality perovskite films on NA than on planar or mesoporous structures. It has been reported that perovskite crystallization could be slowed down through chloride ion (Cl−) introduction, and it is believed that Cl− incorporation plays a key role in the enhancement of the electronic properties at the substrate/perovskite interface.30–35
To date, there are few reports on the Cl-assisted approach to improve the quality of perovskite film for NAPSCs. There are two ways to introduce Cl− to the precursor system, one is from PbCl2, and the other is from MACl. Work by Li et al.27 demonstrated a device with a PCE of 11.8% fabricated by a typical MAI and PbCl2 precursor with a molar ratio of 3:1. The relatively low PCE indicates that optimization of the growth process is needed for enhancing the performance of the NAPSCs.
In this paper, we demonstrate a simple but effective technique to fabricate highly efficient NAPSCs. Our strategy includes the synthesis of compact layer-free TiO2-NAs at low temperature, the replacement of MAI–PbI2 precursor system by the MACl–PbI2 system in DMSO solvent and utilizing toluene dripping technique during the film formation process. High quality perovskite films were obtained on TiO2-NA substrates, exhibiting a uniform and pinhole-free morphology with substantially reduced trap states and density of grain boundaries as a result of significantly increased crystal size up to several micrometers. By employing the optimized perovskite film, a PCE of >19%, under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2), has been achieved, demonstrating the great potential of TiO2-NA as the ETL compared to their planar and mesoporous counterparts for application in PSCs.
Results and discussion
TiO2-NA/perovskite sample
SEM image (Fig. 1a) shows that the TiO2-NA is vertically aligned on the FTO substrate with a length of ca. 350–400 nm, a diameter of ca. 40–50 nm, and the number density of TiO2-NA, as shown in Fig. 1b, is ca. 2 × 102/μm−2. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) peaks of TiO2-NA (Fig. S1†) match well with rutile TiO2 (JCPDS 86-0147), belonging to the tetragonal crystal system (a = b = 4.594 Å, c = 2.959 Å, and α = β = γ = 90°). The high-resolution STEM (Fig. 1c) demonstrates that TiO2-nanorods grown by solvothermal method are single-crystalline with the interplanar distances of d1 = 0.295 nm and d2 = 0.324 nm which match well with the interplanar separations for the crystal planes along the (001) and (110) directions for rutile TiO2 respectively. The (001) lattice fringes planes are perpendicular to the growth direction, confirming that TiO2-NA grow preferentially along [001] direction.36

The TiO2-NA/perovskite samples were formed by spin-coating the perovskite precursors onto the TiO2-NA substrates, followed by the annealing treatment to obtain fully crystallized perovskite films. In this work, we have systematically investigated the impact of the MACl/MAI ratio on the morphology and PV performances of the devices. We have studied 5 different ratios: 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 and the resultant perovskite films will be identified as types P0, P0.5, P1, P1.5 and P2 films respectively thereafter. Typical XRD patterns of the perovskite films are shown in Fig. 2a. Perovskite films grown from the P0 precursor exhibit typical diffraction peaks of MAPI with a tetragonal structure indicating a polycrystalline structure with weak preferential growth (Fig. S2†). In contrast, the crystallinities for the P0.5, P1, P1.5 and P2 samples enhance significantly with a preferred orientation along the (110) direction. Moreover, the data indicate that the crystallinity improves with the MACl concentration in the precursor. The P1.5 sample exhibits the best crystallinity. However, further increase in the MACl concentration does not lead to a corresponding improvement in the crystallinity. We examined the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for the (110) peak for each sample (inset of Fig. 2a). It is found that the FWHM values are 0.263°, 0.246°, 0.223°, 0.216°, and 0.215° for the P0, P0.5, P1, P1.5, and P2 sample respectively, exhibiting a gradual decrease in the FWHM value with MACl concentration in the precursor. The data stipulate enhanced crystallinity with an increase in the MACl composition in the precursor demonstrating that MACl is beneficial to the perovskite crystal growth on TiO2-NA substrate. The UV-vis spectra of TiO2-NA and TiO2-NA/perovskite samples are shown in Fig. 2b. The as-prepared TiO2-NA structure only absorbs ultraviolet light, and exhibits a bandgap (Eg) absorption edge at 385 nm (3.2 eV), in agreement with previous reports.37 The absorption spectrum for the P0 sample shows typical bandgap absorption of MAPI, similar to that with MAPI on ZnO nanorod arrays.23 From the Tauc plot the bandgap size obtained for the P0 film Eg = 1.60 eV which is consistent with previous reports.38–42

In order to obtain high quality perovskite films on TiO2-NA, DMSO with molar ratio of 1:1 to PbI2 was employed for all of the precursors to form the Lewis acid–base adduct MAI·PbI2·DMSO.43–45 Moreover, the precursors were treated by toluene as the anti-solvent during the spin-coating process, as toluene is more non-polar than other solvents, such as chlorobenzene and dichloromethane, which means that toluene has a larger driving force for the precursors to nucleate by reducing the Gibbs energy.46Fig. 3a–e show the top view SEM images of TiO2-NA/perovskite samples. The type P0 sample shows a smooth morphology with the crystal sizes in a range of 100 to 300 nm. However, large pinholes are found, and this is attributed to the fast crystallization of the perovskite precursor. In our case, it is difficult to prepare the P0 film on TiO2-NA without pinholes. For the precursor without MACl, the as-spun film changes color when toluene is dropped onto the sample and the film crystallizes immediately at room temperature before taking out from the spin coater, resulting in perovskite film with pinholes after annealing on the hotplate. Therefore, we have to optimize the composition of the precursor so that the crystallization process can be slowed down. Compared to P0 type sample, remarkable changes in the morphology can be clearly seen when MACl is introduced into the precursor for perovskite growth, as shown in Fig. 3b–e. First, the crystal sizes of Cl-doped films have increased substantially from hundreds of nanometers to micrometer scale, indicating an enhanced crystallinity, which is consistent with the analyses from the XRD patterns (Fig. 2a). Second, the density of the grain boundaries decreases significantly and become more inconspicuous with the addition of MACl. As the photogenerated charge carriers could be easily trapped at the grain boundaries by the defect states,47,48 dramatic reduction in the grain boundaries favors the suppression of carrier recombination. This effect is important in thick perovskite films to greatly facilitate the collection of photogenerated carriers.49 For precursors with low concentration of MACl, it can be seen that pinholes are still present in the film as in P0.5 (Fig. 3b) and P1 (Fig. 3c) films. By increasing the molar ratio of MACl/MAI to 1.5, the film exhibits full coverage and long range crystallized morphology on TiO2-NA. Increasing the MACl/MAI ratio to 2 leads to no observable change in the morphology, as shown in Fig. 3d and e. This suggests that the amount of MACl for high quality film growth is optimized in P1.5 film. It is noteworthy that the time that needs for crystallization was found to increase gradually from P0 to P2 films in our experiments, suggesting that the presence of MACl in the precursor slows down the crystallization process. It is suggested that the phenomenon arises from the generation of an intermediate chloride-rich phase, probably CH3NH3PbCl3, as the dominant component,31 which acts as a preceding structural template for the final perovskite phase.50 In general, it is found that a chlorine-rich intermediate phase requires a longer annealing time for a complete transformation51 which is probably driven by the release of gaseous MACl as the result of the decomposition of CH3NH3PbCl3 under an annealing treatment.31,32 We believe that a slower crystallization process due to the incorporation of MACl will provide a longer time for perovskite crystal to growth, resulting in a larger perovskite grain size and better crystallinity of film. Furthermore, the work of Chen et al.52 shows that both MA and Cl are responsible for controlling the crystallographic orientation of the perovskite film. From the cross-sectional SEM image (Fig. 3f), it is clear that P0 is composed of crystals with grain size within 300 nm and with a highly porous morphology. This results in a reduced absorption and an ineffective charge transfer from P0 to TiO2-NA. With the addition of MACl in the precursor, remarkable changes are observed in the P1.5 film (Fig. 3g) which exhibits a highly compact morphology without any voids. The improved contact between the perovskite film and the TiO2-NA is much more favorable to the charge transfer process.

To investigate the effects of DMSO, we use the precursor with a 1.5 MACl/MAI molar ratio without DMSO and the spin-coated precursor was treated with anti-solvent dripping. Compared to standard P1.5 film (Fig. 3d), the perovskite film formed without DMSO (Fig. S3a†) shows the same crystal size in micrometer scale but exhibits large pinholes on the TiO2-NA substrate. This will lead to a short circuit condition as a result of direct contact between TiO2-NA and the hole transport layer (HTL). In contrast, the perovskite film formed using the precursor with DMSO (MACl/MAI = 1.5) but without anti-solvent dripping exhibits micrometer scale grain size (Fig. S3b†) with an elongated shape and a small coverage of the total TiO2-NA substrate area. These results show that this morphology is inferior to that shown in Fig. S3a.† Therefore, DMSO and anti-solvent dripping are indispensable for obtaining a good morphology of the perovskite films.
We have conducted detailed characterizations of the photothermal deflection spectroscopy (PDS), which is a highly sensitive absorption measurement technique with sensitivity down to 10−4 on the perovskite films to secure further insights into the quality of the perovskite film. The measurement is realized through the detection of a deflected probe light due to the heating of the sample surface induced from the non-radiative relaxation of photoexcited carriers, which makes it immune to optical effects, e.g., interference, reflection, and scattering.53 The PDS technique has been extensively used to analyze bandgap states in amorphous silicon54,55 and organic semiconductors.56 For perovskites, PDS can be used to detect the energetic disorders as the exponential decay of the sub-bandgap absorption as characterized by the Urbach energy (Eu).57–59 The Urbach energy reflects the steepness of the band tail states at the conduction band edge. A smaller Eu stands for a lower density of shallow trap states.58,60 Our PDS results are shown in Fig. 4, in which all of the samples were grown on quartz to avoid the substrate absorption. The Eu values are 23.2 meV, 20.9 meV, 20.7 meV, 20.5 meV, and 20.8 meV for the perovskite P0, P0.5, P1, P1.5, and P2 films respectively. Compared to the P0 film, the introduction of MACl significantly reduces Eu, suggesting that MACl is not only favorable to morphology improvement, but also suppresses the shallow trap states effectively. The data show that the reduction in Eu is much slower for P0.5 to P2 as a function of MACl concentration. Also, the value of Eu reaches a minimum at the molar ratio of MACl/MAI = 1.5, followed by a slight increase with further increase in the ratio. This implies that P1.5 has the lowest degree of energetic disorders and excessive MACl would introduce again some shallow trap states to the perovskite film. Detailed examination of the PDS spectra for energy range far below the bandgap illustrates a slight reduction in deep trap states for the P0.5 to P2 films compared to the P0 film particularly in the range of 0.6 to 1.1 eV and P1.5 is found to exhibit the lowest level. Further increase in MACl content (i.e. P2) leads to enhanced absorption, suggesting an increase in the deep trap states. These trap states will impose a local modulation in the energy band at the TiO2/perovskite interface and thereby creating an electrostatic barrier for electron transfer across the interface.61 Therefore, the decrease of the trap states resulting from MACl introduction is believed to be advantageous to the charge transfer process between perovskites and TiO2.

It is noted that the measurement of the time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) is performed on the control P0 and the optimal P1.5 samples and the obtained results are shown in Fig. S4.† It is found that the carrier lifetime of P1.5 sample are significantly longer than that of the P0 sample, indicative of less carrier recombination caused by the defects for the P1.5 sample, which are also corroborated by results of PDS. Furthermore, our TRPL results agree well with the work of Xie et al.,51 in which a comprehensive investigation on PL lifetimes of perovskite with incorporation of different concentration of MACl was reported. From the SEM, PDS and TRPL results, it is concluded that DMSO, appropriate MACl content, and the anti-solvent dripping are the indispensable elements in our technique, and by optimizing their synergistic effects, high quality perovskite films can be obtained on TiO2-NA substrates.

For P0 device, an averaged PCE of 11.8% was achieved, which is consistent with the previous reports.23–27,62 For P0.5 to P1.5 devices, the improvement in the PV performance is attributed to the increase in the short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). However, further increase in MACl content (P2) leads to a reduction in the PCE, due to a marked decrease in open circuit voltage (Voc) and a slight drop in Jsc and FF. Type P1.5 device exhibits the best performance with an averaged PCE of 18.3%, which is much better than the type P0 device. Moreover, type P1.5 device exhibits good stability upon light exposure and biased at the maximum power point. A steady state PCE of 18.4% is obtained, as shown in Fig. S5.† The champion device (P1.5 type) has a high efficiency (Fig. 5a) of 19.02% with little hysteresis. To the best of our knowledge, it is the highest reported efficiency among the NAPSCs. Fig. 5b illustrates the EQE of the champion device, demonstrating an excellent result of >90% over a wide range of wavelengths. From the EQE spectrum, the integrated Jsc of 22.8 mA cm−2 is in good accordance with the experimental Jsc.

Fig. 6a–e show the typical J–V curves for P0 to P2 devices, exhibiting the efficiencies of 12.86%, 14.61%, 17.53%, 18.43%, and 17.86%, respectively. It is clear that, apart from improving the PCE, MACl addition can also lead to reduction in the hysteresis as well, which is seen to scale inversely with the amount of MACl added into the precursor. However, further increase in the molar ratio of MACl/MAI beyond 1.5 did not lead to significant change. Accordingly, the device performance depends heavily on the quality of perovskite film in NAPSCs, which is realized through the optimization of MACl content in perovskite precursors.

Different proposed mechanisms of enhanced device performance due to the incorporation of Cl have been reported widely. Yin et al.63 had demonstrated theoretically that Cl can spontaneously segregate into the perovskite grain boundaries and passivate the trap states. Their findings agree well with our PDS results as discussed above. A number of groups have pointed out that incorporation of Cl can affect the morphological evolution of perovskite growth, resulting in preferential crystallographic orientations for better charge transfer.32,52,64–66 This phenomenon is also corroborated by our XRD data, for which a stronger cryptographic orientation is obtained with increased concentration of MACl in the precursor solution. Furthermore, Chen et al.67 successfully decoupled the morphological factor and found that the incorporation of Cl can facilitate the carrier transport across the heterojunction interfaces between the perovskite and carrier transport layers. Therefore, we believed that the excellent performance of devices arises from two aspects: (i) the use of a precursor containing optimized concentration of MACl results in highly uniform perovskite film with high crystallinity and substantial reduction of grain boundaries and trap states; (ii) high quality TiO2-NA is incorporated in the device structure. The following studies were carried out to systematically examine the impact of these two aspects on the properties of the devices.
It is interesting to note that the device Voc decreases slightly from type P0 to P2 devices, as shown in Table 1 and Fig. 6a–e. Given that the Voc depends largely on the energy band structure in the PSCs,12,39,68–70 the ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) studies (Fig. 6f) were carried out to determine the position of energy levels of perovskite layers. The work function (WF) is obtained by subtracting the cutoff energy (Ecutoff) in high binding energy region from the He(I) energy (21.22 eV), and the ionization energy (IE) is the summation of WF and the valence band maximum (VBM). Fig. 6g exhibits the energy diagram of the different types of perovskite films derived from the UPS spectra and all energies are referenced to a common Fermi level. From the energy diagram, it is clear that the value of IE decreases with the increase in the MACl content in the precursors. This is in accordance with the findings reported by Chang et al.,39 who found that the increase of MA+ in the precursor, relative to Pb2+ concentration, would push the valence band up to higher levels. The Voc correlates closely with the split between the quasi-Fermi levels of the electrons and holes under illumination, which is strongly affected by the occupation of electronic states in the perovskite and charge transport layers.12,69 The rise in valence band subjected to MACl addition would inevitably raise the quasi-Fermi level of the holes in the perovskite layer and reduces the difference between quasi-Fermi levels between electrons in the TiO2-NA and holes in the perovskite layer, leading to a reduction in Voc. The higher the valence band is, the smaller the Voc appears in our NAPSCs.
We have conducted electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements to elucidate on the differences in the device performance resulting from different types of perovskite films. The technique allows the separation of internal electrical processes with different characteristic time scales by means of appropriate fitting models.71–73 This technique has been successfully used to study the charge transport dynamics in PSCs recently.62,74–78 The EIS spectra were recorded in the dark at different biases over the frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. Fig. 7a presents the Nyquist plot of a typical cell at a bias of 1.0 V in the dark. The inset to Fig. 7a is the equivalent circuit that is capable of producing a good fit to the experimental data. The Rsc-CPEsc element in the high frequency region is related to the carrier transport in selective contacts at either the ETL/perovskite or perovskite/HTL interface, and the Rrec-CPEμ element in the low frequency region is associated with the recombination process correlated closely with the perovskite absorber.77,79 The single resistor (Rs) denotes the series resistance mainly from the electrodes, which is rather small and is found to be close to zero for all the different types of devices. Fig. 7b and c exhibit the fitted selective contact resistance (Rsc) and the recombination resistance (Rrec) as a function of the applied voltage, respectively. The Rsc is markedly reduced with the addition of MACl, which is favorable to the charge carrier transfer at the interface. For type P2 device, a slight increase in Rsc is observed, which is probably due to the deterioration in the quality of perovskite film as a result of excessive MACl in the precursor. As shown in Fig. 7c, the dependence of Rrec on MACl content is found to increase significantly, for the applied voltage from 0.5 V to 1.0 V, with MACl addition. This suggests that recombination is effectively suppressed with the increase of MACl content. It is noteworthy that excessive MACl in the type P2 device leads to a decrease in the Rrec value which is attributed to the introduction of additional trap states within the perovskite film. It is evident that the slope of Rrec is higher for type P1.5 device compared with type P0 device, indicating a lower diode ideality factor for type P1.5 device.71,80 This phenomenon is believed to originate from the higher conductivity of the perovskite film as a result of reduced trap states80 in the material. Therefore, the smaller Rsc and larger Rrec benefit the charge carrier transport, leading to a much improved FF in the NAPSCs.

Femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy (fs-TA) studies were performed to obtain further insights into the charge transfer dynamics in the TiO2-NA/perovskite junction. The fs-TA spectra were measured by employing a standard pump-probe technique using 400 nm light as pump beam and a white light continuum of 350–800 nm as a probe pulse. By means of these ultrafast transient absorption measurements, one can obtain the extraction time (τ) at the interfaces between the perovskite and a typical TiO2-NA. Fig. 8a and b exhibit the fs-TA spectra for types P0 and P1.5 samples respectively and the spectra for types P0.5, P1, and P2 samples are shown in Fig. S6.† In Fig. 8a, a positive band in the range of 500–700 nm represents the photoinduced absorption from excited states in type P0 sample. The sharp negative band is composed of two peaks with the peak at ∼745 nm being attributed to transient photobleaching of the band edge transition81–84 and the other at around 760 nm being attributed to laser induced fluorescence.82,85 The fs-TA spectra display significant changes for the type P1.5 sample compared to the P0 sample, as shown in Fig. 8b. The photoinduced absorption decreases remarkably, suggesting a dramatic reduction in the population of the excited species, which demonstrates that the charge transfer at the type P1.5 sample is much more effective than that of the type P0 sample. In addition, the fluorescence peak is largely decreased in intensity as well, indicating that the recombination is suppressed notably for the type P1.5 sample. This is attributed to a better interfacial property between the TiO2-NA and the type P1.5 perovskite interface as a result of the improved perovskite film qualities. The decay of the excited states in perovskites can be reflected by the ground state recovery dynamics,81–83 so the kinetics of the band edge bleaching were investigated based on the results shown in Fig. 8c and S6 and the fitted parameters are summarized in Table S1.†

(c) Normalized transient band edge bleach kinetics (dots) and fittings (lines) of TiO2–P0 and TiO2–P1.5 samples. (d) Fitted extraction time constants against the molar ratio of MACl/MAI. Inset shows the illustration of improvement of charge extraction due to enhanced quality of perovskite film (P1.5) as compared with the control one (P0). 

Fig. 8d presents the dependence of the extraction time as a function of the MACl/MAI molar ratio. Increasing the ratio from 0 to 1.5 found that the extraction time decreases dramatically from 813 ps to 317 ps, and a further increase in MACl/MAI molar ratio up to 2 does not change the extraction time significantly. As mentioned above, type P1.5 perovskite film has a lower grain boundary and trap density (inset to Fig. 8d) compared to the control (type P0) and the presence of Cl also exhibits a beneficial effect on preferential orientation for charge transport resulting in a significant reduction in the probability of the electron trapping by either the grain boundaries or the bulk traps, and thus the charge transfer process is expedited, leading to an enhanced photocurrent. Accordingly, a smaller τ suggests a higher electron extraction efficiency as a result of better interfacial properties between the perovskite and TiO2-NA and a further lowering of the probability of trapping by the defect states in the perovskite material, which is achieved concomitantly by optimizing the qualities of the perovskite film.
We also conducted the fs-TA experiment on the type P1.5 perovskite film grown on a TiO2 compact layer (CL-P1.5) as a control experiment. The corresponding spectrum and kinetic curves are shown in Fig. 9a and b. Compared to the type P1.5 sample, the type CL-P1.5 sample exhibits a little stronger fluorescence, indicating that the TiO2 compact layer is less effective than TiO2-NA to quench the photoluminescence of the perovskite layer. This is attributed to the larger interfacial area between the P1.5 perovskite and TiO2-NA as well as the penetration of the TiO2-NA deep into perovskite layer and thereby significantly enhancing the collection of the photo-carriers through the reduction of their diffusion distance. This model is corroborated by the longer extraction time of the type CL-P1.5 junction (τ = 436 ps) compared to the standard type P1.5 (τ = 317 ps) junction. Furthermore, the single crystal nature of the TiO2 nanorod, in contrast to the polycrystalline compact layer, also facilitates the enhancement of the electrical properties of the PSC. Fig. 9c compares the typical J–V performance of the types CL-P1.5 and type P1.5 NAPSCs. The main differences are that the CL-P1.5 device exhibits a smaller Jsc and a larger hysteresis compared to the type P1.5 NAPSCs. As there is little difference in the morphology of the P1.5 film grown on TiO2-NA or TiO2 CL (inset to Fig. 9c), it is thought that the higher electron extraction efficiency in the type P1.5 NAPSCs is the predominant factor in the enhancement in Jsc and the reduction in the hysteresis as compared with the CL-P1.5 devices.

Experimental
Synthesis of TiO2-NA
Patterned FTO (OPV-TECH Co., 7–10 Ω □−1) coated glass substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication sequentially in acetone, 2-propanol, and deionized water. The substrates were dried by nitrogen gas and exposed to UV-ozone for 30 min. TiO2-NA were prepared by solvothermal reaction method. Typically, 20 mL of deionized water was mixed with 20 mL hydrochloric acid (37%, Sigma Aldrich) in a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, in which the patterned FTO substrate had been suspended in advance. Then, 0.6 mL titanium isopropoxide (TTIP, Sigma Aldrich) was added into the autoclave, followed by an ultrasonic treatment for 5 min. The solvothermal synthesis was conducted at 180 °C for 50 min. After the autoclave was cooled to room temperature, the FTO substrates was taken out, rinsed extensively with deionized water, and dried with nitrogen gas.
Device fabrication
The perovskite precursors were prepared by adding 1 M PbI2 (Alfa Aesar), 1 M MAI (Dyesol), and MACl (PLT Corp.) with different molar values to MAI in DMF (Sigma Aldrich), where the molar ratio of DMSO/PbI2 was fixed to be 1. The precursors were spin-coated onto the TiO2-NA substrates at 1500 rpm for 30 s. At the 15 s point of spin-coating process, the substrate was treated with 0.5 mL toluene. For comparison, the P1.5 precursor was spin-coated onto the TiO2 CL under the same conditions as that for TiO2-NA sample. The TiO2 CL was prepared by spin coating in a mildly acidic diluted TTIP solution (1.25 mL) in ethanol (25 mL) at 3000 rpm followed by sintering at 450 °C for 2 h. The hole transporting layer (HTL) was prepared by spin-coating a solution of spiro-MeOTAD (80 mg mL−1) dissolved in chlorobenzene with the additives of LiTFSI (17.5 μL from a stock solution of 520 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile) and 29 μL of tBP at 3000 rpm for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm Au was evaporated on the spiro-MeOTAD HTL through a shadow mask which defines the active area of 0.03 cm2 for each device and the devices with different MACl/MAI ratio perovskites are denoted as the P0, P0.5, P1, P1.5 and P2 devices in accordance to their perovskite film type.
Instruments and characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained from a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer, and the Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed by using Hitachi S-4800 field emission scanning electron microscope. Scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) was carried out on a Jeol JEM-2100F microscope under an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. UV-visible (UV-vis) spectroscopy was performed by a UV-2550 Shimadzu UV-vis spectrophotometer for the TiO2-NA and TiO2-NA/perovskite sample. The J–V characteristics of the devices were measured using a B1500 A semiconductor parameter analyzer under the calibrated AAA class Oriel Sol3A solar simulator equipped with standard AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) illumination. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was determined by a QE system from Newport. For PDS measurement, the perovskite film was grown on a quartz substrate and immersed in an inert liquid (FC-72). The film was illuminated by a monochromatic light beam, chopped at 13 Hz, and a laser beam was made to graze the sample surface. Non-radiative recombination taking place within the perovskite material will result in the local heating of the material and thereby resulting in the periodic deflection of the laser beam. A position sensor, connected to a lock-in amplifier, was used to detect the deflection of the laser beam from which the defect density was determined. The UPS characterizations were performed on the TiO2-NA/perovskite samples using a photoelectron spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Axis Ultra DLD) with He(I) excitation at 21.22 eV. The EIS was recorded on a Zahner Zennium electrochemical workstation at applied voltages ranging from 0.5 V to 1.0 V with frequency ranging from 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The fs-TA spectroscopy experiments were performed with a femtosecond Ti/sapphire regenerative amplifier laser system (Mai Tai, Spitfire-Pro, Spectra-Physics) and an automated data acquisition system (Ultrafast, Helios). The input to the amplifier is connected to the laser output from the oscillator (Mai Tai, Spectra-Physics) and generates a 120 fs pulse at 800 nm with a repetition rate of 1 kHz. The samples were excited by a 400 nm pump beam, and a white-light continuum ranging from 350–800 nm was generated in a sapphire crystal. The pump and probe beams were strictly controlled by the polarizer or half-wave plate to attain both a temporal and spatial overlap at the sample. Time resolved photoluminescence signals of perovskite film on quartz were determined by using an Edinburgh FLSP920 spectrophotometer installed with the excitation source of 485 nm picosecond pulsed diode laser in the average power of 0.15 mW.
Conclusion
We have developed a deposition technique to grow high quality perovskite films on TiO2-NA by using appropriate MACl/MAI ratio together with the addition of DMSO in the precursor solution and applying anti-solvent dripping method during the spin-coating process. We have also demonstrated that the incorporation of TiO2-NA in the PSCs can greatly facilitate the collection of photo-generated carriers in the devices due to the larger interfacial area between the perovskite and the TiO2-NA. By using the proposed techniques, a PCE of 19.02% with negligible hysteresis can be achieved for the device without the high temperature processing TiO2 CL, which is a record performance for the NAPSCs. This demonstrates the superiority of TiO2-NA as an ETL compared to their planar and mesoporous counterparts for applications in PSCs.
