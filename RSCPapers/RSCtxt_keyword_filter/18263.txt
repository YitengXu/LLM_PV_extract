    , Accepted 13th October 2019First published on 14th October 2019AbstractA new small molecular hole-transporting material, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-N′-(9,9′-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-amino]pyrene (TFAP) was synthesized and applied in CH3NH3PbI3-perovskite solar cells. A best power conversion efficiency of 19.7% with a photovoltage of 1.11 V has been achieved.
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted worldwide attention owing to their low production costs and high efficiencies.1 So far, a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.2% has been achieved.2 In a typical PSC, hole-transporting materials (HTMs) play an important role in extracting and transporting the photo-induced holes from the perovskite film to the back electrode.3 The most commonly used small-molecular HTM in PSCs is 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N′-di-p-methoxyphenylamino)-9,9′-spiro-bifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD).4 The potential for practical applications of spiro-OMeTAD is inhibited by its complicated multistep synthesis and high synthetic cost.5 Intensive research interest has therefore been devoted to the development of new HTM candidates with low cost and good performance.
Although many organic small molecular HTMs have been reported, including those with a triphenylamine,6 carbazole,7 thiophene,8 triazatruxene,9 or spiro-bisfluorene framework,10 there is still an urgent demand for low-cost and highly efficient alternatives. As a fused conjugated aromatic ring, pyrene has good charge-transport ability due to its strong electron delocalization.11 Pyrene derivatives with different substituents have been successfully used in organic light-emitting diodes and solar cells.12 Seok and co-workers reported a pyrene-based HTM, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[N,N′-di(p-methoxyphenyl)amino]pyrene (Py-C; Fig. 1a left) with a best PCE (PCEbest) of 12.4% being achieved in CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) based devices.13 Cui and Chen et al. disclosed a PCE of 19.28% with a pyrene HTM comprising four triarylamine substituents.14 The photovoltaic performance of PSC was further improved over 20% in Cs-doped ternary PSCs by incorporating thiophene bridging units into the 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetraamine HTM.15 In addition, pyrene-cored HTMs with two or four triphenylamine or carbazole substituents have been reported.16 These studies demonstrate that pyrene is a promising molecular framework for designing HTMs with simple synthesis, low cost and excellent performance.

In this contribution, a new pyrene-cored HTM, 1,3,6,8-tetrakis[N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-N′-(9,9′-dimethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-amino]pyrene (TFAP, Fig. 1a right) has been synthesized and applied in PSCs. The only difference between TFAP and the previously reported Py-C13 is the replacement of the N,N′-di(p-methoxyphenyl)amino segment of Py-C with N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-N′-(9,9′-dimethylfluoren-2-yl)amino substituents. The introduction of the fluorene groups in the terminal substituent was found to significantly improve the hole mobility of HTM and the photovoltaic performance in PSCs. A PCEbest value of 19.7% was achieved with TFAP under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mA cm−2).

TFAP was synthesized by one-pot four-fold C–N coupling reactions between 1,3,6,8-tetrabromopyrene and N-(p-methoxyphenyl)-N′-(9,9′-dimethylfluoren-2-yl)amine in 39.7% yield (Fig. 1b; see details in the ESI†). The synthesis of TFAP is much simpler and cheaper with respect to that of spiro-OMeTAD. The lab synthesis cost of TFAP is estimated to be around 46 US$ per g (Table S1, ESI†), which is about half of that of spiro-OMeTAD (91.67 US$ per g).17
The cyclic voltammetry (CV) of TFAP displays a reversible anodic wave at +0.59 V vs. Ag/AgCl in CH2Cl2 (Fig. 2a), which is 0.16 V and 0.05 V more positive with respect to the first anodic wave of Py-C and spiro-OMeTAD, respectively. Considering that spiro-OMeTAD has a HOMO level of −5.22 eV vs. vacuum, the HOMO levels of TFAP and Py-C were estimated to be −5.27 and −5.11 eV, respectively. The perovskite we used in this work is MAPbI3, which has a valence band of −5.43 eV. This suggests that TFAP would be favourable for the hole transfer from perovskite. DFT calculations show that the highest-occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of TFAP is delocalized over the molecular framework (Fig. S1, ESI†), which is believed to be beneficial for the hole transport in PSCs. The UV-visible absorption spectra of TFAP in CH2Cl2 solution and thin film states are shown in Fig. 2b. The absorption bands between 380 and 550 nm are attributed to intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) transitions from the amine moieties to the pyrene core, as supported by the TDDFT results shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The optical band gap (Eg) of TFAP was calculated to be 2.36 eV from the absorption onset wavelength. The LUMO level of TFAP is thus determined to be −2.91 eV. The significantly higher LUMO level of TFAP relative to the conduction band of perovskite (−3.93 eV) can efficiently block the electron transfer from perovskite to the Au counter electrode. The HOMO and LUMO levels of TFAP are both distinctly stabilized with respect to those of Py-C (Fig. 2c), as a result of the replacement of one methoxyphenyl unit of the amine substituent with the dimethylfluorene group. In the film state, the maximum absorption peak positions of TFAP are only slightly red-shifted with respect to those in solution, suggesting that no obvious aggregation occurs in thin films. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectrum displays a maximum emission peak at 540 nm for TFAP (Fig. 2b). In addition, the decomposition temperature of TFAP is slightly higher with respect to that of Py-C (458 vs. 417 °C, Fig. S2, ESI†).

The hole mobility of Py-C and TFAP was measured and compared by the space charge limited current (SCLC) method with a hole-only device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/HTM/Au in the dark (Fig. 2d).18 Under the same conditions, the hole mobility of doped TFAP and Py-C was estimated to be 4.5 × 10−3 and 6.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, indicating that the incorporation of the fluorene unit in TFAP could significantly improve the hole mobility. The mobility of TFAP is also higher than that of spiro-OMeTAD recorded using the same measurement method (Table 1).15

In order to investigate the photovoltaic performance of TFAP as a HTM for PSCs, we fabricated MAPbI3-based devices with the configuration of ITO/SnO2/MAPbI3/HTM/Au (Fig. 3a). For the purpose of comparison, devices were also made with Py-C and spiro-OMeTAD as the HTM under the same conditions and by identical fabrication processes. The perovskite film coated with TFAP or spiro-OMeTAD shows a smooth and uniform surface morphology as investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. In contrast, possibly due to its relatively low solubility, the perovskite surface coated with Py-C shows an ununiform and patchy morphology (Fig. S3, ESI†). The photovoltaic characteristics of the PCSs were measured under AM 1.5 G conditions. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves are presented in Fig. 3b and the photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2.

The spiro-OMeTAD-based PSCs exhibit a PCEbest of 19.95%, with a short-circuit density (Jsc) of 23.38 mA cm−2, an open circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.09 V, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.73. Under the same conditions, the champion devices based on TFAP showed a comparable PCEbest of 19.74% (Jsc = 22.63 mA cm−2, Voc = 1.11 V, and FF = 74.05%), which is significantly improved compared to that with Py-C (PCEbest = 11.01%, Jsc = 20.87 mA cm−2, Voc = 0.99 V, and FF = 56.12%). Notably, the device with TFAP shows a higher Voc value than those with either Py-C or spiro-OMeTAD, which is attributed to the closer alignment of the HOMO level of TFAP to the valence band of perovskite. The J–V curves of the device based on TFAP exhibit small hysteresis at forward and reverse scans (Fig. S4, ESI†). The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectrum of PSCs with different HTMs is displayed in Fig. 3c. The integrated photocurrent densitities of the devices based on Py-C, TFAP and spiro-OMeTAD are 18.33, 22.04, and 22.06 mA cm−2, respectively, which are consistent with the Jsc values found from the J–V measurements of the respective PSC devices.

Fig. 3d shows the statistical distribution of the PCEs of 20 devices with different HTMs. The average efficiency (PCEavg) of the devices based on Py-C, TFAP and spiro-OMeTAD is 9.14%, 18.60% and 18.67%, respectively. It is noteworthy that the PSCs based on TFAP gave a comparable efficiency compared to the control device using spiro-OMeTAD. Fig. 3e shows the stabilized efficiency while maintaining the PSCs at the maximum power output point. The TFAP-based device shows a stable PCE response within 120 s of exposure under the maximum power output. Moreover, the box charts of the statistical data show a small data distribution of the PSCs prepared from TFAP, suggestive of good reproducibility of the device performance (Fig. S5, ESI†). The PCE of the device with TFAP decreased around 20% after storing for 6 days without encapsulation under ambient conditions, which is slightly inferior to that with spiro-OMeTAD yet superior to that with Py-C (Fig. S6, ESI†).
In order to further evaluate the charge separation and collection processes at the perovskite/HTM interface, steady PL and time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements have been investigated. After the deposition of the hole-transporting layer on the top of the perovskite, the PL intensity decreased significantly as a result of the quenching of the photogenerated charge carriers. As presented in Fig. 4a, TFAP and spiro-OMeTAD show much higher quenching efficiency than Py-C, suggesting the strong hole extraction capability of TFAP and spiro-OMeTAD at the perovskite/HTM interface. This is consistent with the above PSC performance with different HTMs, in which those with TFAP display a much increased Jsc compared to Py-C. Fig. 4b shows the PL decay profile of the perovskite films coated with and without HTMs. A shorter decay time indicates a faster photo-generated hole extraction in the perovskite film.19 By fitting the spectra using a bi-exponential mode, carrier lifetimes (τ) are estimated with τ1 and τ2 of 13.0 and 230.5 ns for the bare perovskite, 11.5 and 147.0 ns for the perovskite/Py-C film, 9.8 and 74.7 ns for the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD film, and 8.4 and 139.8 ns for the perovskite/TFAP film, respectively (Table S2, ESI†). It is again suggested that TFAP has better hole extraction capability than Py-C.

The reason for the performance improvement by incorporation of the fluorene unit into the HTM structure could be multifaceted. The replacement of one p-methoxyphenyl unit of the amine substituent with the 9,9′-dimethylfluorene group distinctly improves the solubility of the compound, resulting in better film quality of TFAP compared to Py-C as was demonstrated in the SEM analysis. The fluorene unit is slightly less electron-donating with respect to the p-methoxyphenyl unit, leading to the stabilized HOMO level of TFAP and thus higher hole extraction capability relative to Py-C. In addition, the fluorene unit has a larger conjugation structure than the phenyl group, which may facilitate carrier transportation between neighbouring molecules.
A new pyrene-cored hole transporting material TFAP with fluorene-terminated moieties has been prepared and applied in PSCs. The incoporation of the fluorene units results in high hole extraction and transporting capability. A competitive power conversion efficiency of 19.7% with a photovoltage of 1.11 V has been achieved by using this HTM in MAPbI3 PSCs. The simple and low-cost synthesis of TFAP, together with its high performance in devices, makes it attractive for the future practical production of PSCs. The appealing features of the fluorene terminal unit demonstrated in this work provide important information for the future design of new molecular HTMs.
