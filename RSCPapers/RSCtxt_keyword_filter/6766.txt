    , Accepted 25th May 2022First published on 7th June 2022AbstractHighly efficient photocatalysts based on van der Waals 2D type heterojunctions were fabricated by horizontal loading of ultrathin hexagonal SnS2 nanosheets on the surface of a g-CN film via spin coating followed by annealing treatment. As evidenced by micrographs and further confirmed by the first-principles calculations, a large contact area was realized in the heterojunction interface by synthesizing sheet-like structures consisting of these two semiconductors, facilitating considerably enhanced charge separation under visible light illumination. In particular, the g-CN/SnS2 heterojunction annealed at 400 °C favors the bonding of Sn–N and C–S resulting in reduction of the bandgap by lowering the conduction band edge and in turn yields ideal electronic structures for photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Such a heterojunction exhibits significantly improved photoinduced current density in sharp contrast to its isolated parent parts, namely g-CN and SnS2, by a factor of 5 and 4, respectively. The photocurrent response, together with Mott–Schottky plots and photoluminescence spectroscopy, demonstrates the photo synergetic effect of the g-CN/SnS2 heterojunction which strongly boosts the photoinduced interfacial charge transfer, enhancing the charge separation during the reaction and lowering the recombination rate.
1 Introduction
One of the effective ways to convert solar energy into chemical energy is by means of photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting which stores energy in the form of hydrogen (H2). Previously, many semiconductor-based photoelectrodes like Fe2O3,1 CdS,2 ZnO,3 CuInS2,4 WO3 (ref. 5) and TiO2 (ref. 6 and 7) were extensively investigated in the conversion of solar energy to fuel. As the most clean, abundant and renewable energy, solar energy has a global capacity of providing up to 105 TW of energy by converting raw sources like water and CO2 into useful energy sources like H2, CO and hydrocarbons.8 Recently, newly designed photosynthesis has been proposed to produce energy-rich chemical fuels such as hydrogen or hydrocarbons by the process of water splitting since the speedy industrial development and over utilization of fossil fuels have led to the contamination of environment and energy crisis. Hence, as an environment-friendly combustion energy product, hydrogen is considered to be a prospective substitute for traditional fossil fuels.9,10
Nowadays, the semiconductor-based photocatalytic PEC process is widely employed as a promising technology for H2 production.11,12 To utilize solar energy more efficiently, a rising number of carbon-based semiconductors are proposed and investigated as next generation photocatalysts owing to their visible-light responsive, environment-friendly and chemically stable character.13,14 Since Wang et al. fabricated a high-competence noble-metal free photocatalyst in 2009, graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) has been gaining interest as it offers low-cost and sustainable H2 production for PEC cells.15 This type of carbon-based product has stimulated much interest in the field of solar-to-fuel conversion.16,17 Pure g-CN is chemically stable with a narrow bandgap (∼2.7 eV) due to π-conjugated graphitic planes assembled by sp2 hybridized carbon and nitrogen. The electron coupling among the planes is prohibited by weak van der Waals gaps. Furthermore, using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, g-CN has also been demonstrated to be a good photocatalyst, having a suitable bandgap and appropriate potential. Still, inefficient photocatalytic activity is confirmed either due to its narrow absorption band, poor electric conductivity, low quantum yield and fast charge recombination rate.18–20 To overcome the issue of fast recombination rate, a variety of strategies like deposition of a metal (Au) onto g-CN nanorods21 or non-metal, textural design and constructing semiconductor-based heterojunctions22–25 have been raised to enhance the PEC performance. It was also demonstrated that g-CN based nanocomposites can enhance their photocatalytic performance by expanding the visible-light response and boosting the charge separation efficiency. As such, a set of semiconductors with different nano-shapes (i.e. nanorods, nanosheets and nanospheres) have been used to couple with g-CN to improve their photocatalytic character20,26 The possible types of g-CN-based heterostructures can be “0D/2D”, “1D/2D”, and “2D/2D” composites.27 The Shi group considered different types of heterojunctions with g-CN by establishing 0D/3D S-scheme heterojunctions by coupling onion-ring g-CN with Bi3TaO4 quantum dots enhancing H2 production28 or Z-scheme heterojunctions with sigma-Bi2O3 providing abundant active sites29 or type II heterojunction photocatalysts by employing 3D hierarchical hollow tubular g-CN with ZnIn2S4 nanosheets30 but still yielding low photocurrent density.31,32 Among the possible types of g-CN-based heterostructures, the highest charge mobility and charge separation are produced by the 2D/2D g-CN-based heterojunction33–35 because it reasonably offers the largest face-to-face interfacial area with respect to the point-to-face interface in the 0D/2D case and the line-to-face contact in the 1D/2D case. Lately, all studies on heterojunctions between g-CN and SnS2 have stated that the photocurrent density, charge separation and stability of the photoelectrode need to be enhanced.
Apart from the above known semiconductor structures, in this work, 2D metal sulphide was selected as the cap layer to couple with the 2D g-CN thin film due to its hexagonal layered structure, suitable band gap of ∼2.48 eV and appropriate band potential making it favourable for boosting the water splitting reaction.36–39 Accordingly, van der Waals 2D heterojunction based photocatalysts were constructed for the first time by linking 2D g-CN structure thin films having good adhesion with a substrate with ultrathin hexagonal SnS2 nanosheets taking advantage of a facile spin coating method. The g-CN and SnS2 nanosheets possess similar band potentials which facilitate the horizontal loading of ultrathin SnS2 nanosheets onto the g-CN film. The resulting nanocomposite allows enhanced photoinduced interfacial charge transfer thereby making the intimate face contact useful. On illumination by visible light and comparing with pure g-CN and SnS2 nanosheets, such a heterojunction demonstrates a significant improvement on PEC performance for the first time, where the boost in PEC performance is debated in terms of the highly efficient charge separation based on the regime of photosynergetic action, as further confirmed by the i–t curve, Mott–Schottky and Nyquist plots.
2 Experimental
2.1 Fabrication of the g-C3N4/SnS2 heterojunction
In the first step, we synthesized hexagonal SnS2 nanosheets via a hydrothermal method, by mixing 0.12 mmol of SnCl4·5H2O with 1 mmol of thiourea in 40 mL of deionized (DI) water. The solution was moved into a Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with 50 mL capacity after being stirred for 30 min. Consequently, the autoclave was placed in an electric oven at 160 °C for 12 h. The autoclave was cooled down to room temperature after the hydrothermal reaction. The yellow precipitate obtained was filtered, washed with DI water and ethanol several times, and dried in an oven at 80 °C for 6 h, giving the ultrathin hexagonal SnS2 nanosheets as the final product. The graphitic carbon nitride (g-CN) film was synthesized by the most facile and previously reported thermal vapor condensation (TVC) method.40–42 In the TVC method, a fine polished crucible (25 mL) with melamine (10 g) inside and a section of FTO glass (50 mm × 50 mm × 3.2 mm, Sigma-Aldrich) on top of the crucible is placed into a Carbolite which is heated to 600 °C with a heating rate of 3 °C min−1 for 3 h. The FTO glasses were prewashed with acetone, ethanol, and DI water solution with a volume ratio of 1:1:1 for 30 min.
The g-CN/SnS2 heterojunction was synthesized by horizontal loading of ultrathin hexagonal SnS2 nanosheets on the g-CN thin film by a spin coating method. The ultrathin hexagonal SnS2 nanosheets were dispersed in 10 mL ethanol via an ultrasonic process for 1 h. Then 1 mL solution of SnS2 was spin coated onto the surface of g-CN. Finally, the as-fabricated films were annealed at different temperatures (300 °C, 400 °C and 500 °C). The g-CN/SnS2 heterojunctions were denoted as g-CN/SnS2-X, where X is the annealing temperature. In our present work, g-CN/SnS2-300 °C, g-C3N4/SnS2-400 °C and g-CN/SnS2-500 °C were synthesized to explore the use of these ideal heterojunctions as photoanodes for optimal PEC performance. The pure g-CN thin film and SnS2 nanosheets were also fabricated as the control samples.
2.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-fabricated heterojunctions were recorded with a Smart lab X-ray diffractometer (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data were measured from a PHI Model 5802 spectrometer with Al Kα radiation, and the peak spots were standardized by the C 1s peak at 284.6 eV. For the morphology and surface topography of the samples, scanning electron microscopy (SEM; JEOL JSM-670F scanning electron microscope) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (VEECO Multimode V) were used for characterization. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy as connected with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study the composition of the products. The UV-vis spectra were monitored on a Varian Cary 50 spectrophotometer. Steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the samples were recorded at room temperature on a Varian fluorescence spectrometer.
2.3 Photoelectrochemical measurements
A three-electrode electrochemical workstation (CHI 760E, Shanghai Chenhua Limited, China) was used to characterize the PEC performance of the film, with fabricated films as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl) as the reference electrode and platinum foil as the counter electrode. The active contact area of the film with electrolyte was kept constant using epoxy. The solution of 0.2 M sodium sulfate (Na2SO4, 99%, Sigma-Aldrich) buffer with pH = 7 was used as an electrolyte. The Nernst equation in eqn (1) was used to convert the potential of Ag/AgCl into the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) with  = 0.197 V at room temperature.42 (1)PEC measurements were conducted under illumination of an air mass 1.5 global (AM 1.5 G) solar simulator (NewBet HSX-F300) with an adjusted power density of 120 mW cm−2.43 The incident light has two possible directions: from the substrate to electrode (SE illumination) and from the electrolyte to electrode (EE illumination). In this work, EE illumination was used during measurements of PEC performance. For Nyquist plots, an open circuit voltage with a frequency range from 0.1 Hz to 100 kHz and 0.01 V AC voltage was used. Mott–Schottky plots were obtained using a sinusoidal modulation with 1 kHz frequency. Such plots are used to quantify the space charge layer capacitances (Csc) of as-fabricated films with an applied voltage according to: (2)where εr, ε0, e and A stand for the relative permittivity of the semiconductor, the vacuum permittivity, the charge of an electron and the effective surface area of the semiconductor, respectively; ND is the free carrier density; E represents the applied potential and Efb is the flat band potential; k denotes the Boltzmann constant; and T is the absolute temperature.
2.4 Computation methods
First-principles calculations were performed based on the density functional theory as implemented in the VASP code.44 The lattice geometries and electronic band structures of the g-C3N4 and SnS2 thin films as well as their heterojunctions were treated with the GGA functional. PAW pseudopotentials45 for C, N, Sn and S were used with a plane-wave basis-set cutoff energy of 400 eV. A 7 × 7 × 1 Monkhorst–Pack mesh was used for the k-point sampling of the system in the Brillouin zone. The climbing-hill nudged elastic band (CNEB) method46 was employed to examine the interfacial atom transitions. To obtain the lattice geometry, all the atoms in the system were allowed to relax until the calculated Hellmann–Feynman forces became less than 1 × 10−3 eV Å−1.
3 Results and discussion
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements of the as-synthesized products are illustrated in Fig. 1. For pure g-CN, the distinctive peak appearing at 27.4° can be indexed to the (002) diffraction planes of the planar tri-s-triazine graphite-like carbon nitride.47,48 For the isolated SnS2 nanosheets, the XRD pattern can be assigned to 2T-type hexagonal berndtite SnS2 (JCPDS, no. 23-677). For the XRD patterns of g-CN/SnS2 heterojunctions annealed at different temperatures, the diffraction peak at 27.4° dominates the characteristic peak of the g-CN thin film while the other peaks correspond to the SnS2 nanosheets as shown in Fig. S1,† signifying the successful loading of SnS2 nanosheets on g-CN nanosheets by spin coating.
 Fig. 1  XRD spectra of the as-fabricated pure SnS2, pure g-CN and their heterojunctions. 
The XRD study of sample g-CN/SnS2-400 °C shows an explicit variation in the phase composition after annealing (Fig. 1); to be precise, the reflections of (120), (021), (131), (210), (211), (122), (042) and (251) planes were all detected to have close relations with SnS, revealing a thermally-induced phase conversion from hexagonal SnS2 to orthorhombic SnS. Ultimately, the sample annealed at 400 °C shows indications of the pure SnS phase (with lattice parameters a = 4.3137 Å, b = 11.2583 Å and c = 3.9958 Å) along with the (002) reflection of the g-CN thin film. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Fig. 2 were used to observe the morphologies and microstructures of g-CN/SnS2 heterojunction nanosheets along with SnS2 and g-C3N4 nanosheets for the purpose of comparison. It is clear that g-CN has a porous structure with a quite smooth surface (Fig. 2A and D) while SnS2 nanosheets have a hexagonal structure and are aggregated which lowers their surface area (Fig. 2B and E). However, after loading SnS2 nanosheets onto g-CN and annealing at different temperatures, the SnS2 nanosheets are uniformly and smoothly lying on the g-CN thin film confirmed by the TEM images (Fig. 2C and F) which indicates that the g-CN thin film might lower the surface energy of SnS2. Fig. S2† displays the AFM images of pure g-CN and those with the surfaces coated with SnS2 that affects the surface roughness of the films. The surface roughness of the films is decreased after loading of SnS2 nanoparticles followed by annealing, as shown in Table S1.†

The XPS spectra of the g-CN/SnS2 heterostructures annealed at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 3. The survey spectrum of the g-CN/SnS2-X heterojunctions shows the prominent peaks related to Sn, S, C, N and O. The presence of O impurity might be subject to the defects formed upon sample decomposition and phase transformation. The high-resolution spectra of C 1s, Sn 3d, S 2p and N 1s enable us to precisely understand the binding nature of the elements in the heterojunction in terms of their binding energies. As observed in Fig. 3a, the three major peaks of the C1s core-level of the g-CN thin film at 284 eV, 285 eV and 287.4 eV, correspond to the sp2 non-oxygenated C–C bond, sp3-coordinated bonds of carbon and sp2 hybridized N–CN bond, respectively, in the s-triazine rings.48–50 The same peaks were also spotted on the spectra of the g-CN/SnS2-400 °C nanocomposite with peaks shifted towards higher binding energy. Additionally, a new peak near 287.2 eV appears which is reasonably associated with the C–S bond between the interface of g-CN and SnS2 films.51 Besides, no significant peak was observed at a lower binding energy (283.1 eV) indicating no C–Sn direct bonding.52

Fig. 3b presents the high-resolution spectra of N 1s of g-CN/SnS2-400 °C in comparison with isolated g-CN nanosheets. From the graph, it can be noted that the characteristic peaks of N 1s in the g-CN thin film appearing at 397.8 eV (sp2 bonded N in C–NC), 399.1 eV (tertiary nitrogen in N–C3), and 400.5 eV (amino groups C–N–H)48–50 all shift upwards to higher energies. More remarkably, a new peak located at 400.9 eV appears in the heterojunction spectra which can be attributed to the Sn–N bond.53,54 Moreover, the characteristic peaks of Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 located at 486.1 eV and 494.5 eV (ref. 38 and 55) typified in isolated SnS2 nanosheets are shifted towards lower binding energy after being coupled with the g-CN bottom layer in the heterojunction structure, as evidenced in Fig. S3(a–d).† Also, the Sn 3d core-level spectra of the heterostructure depicted in Fig. 3c display an additional peak at 496 eV which corresponds to the Sn–N bonds,53,54 revealing the possibility of Sn–N bonding behaviour in the heterojunction. Furthermore, no peak was detected at 486.3 eV which excludes the presence of Sn–C direct bonding.46 The S 2p spectra of SnS2 nanosheets show evidence of S2–.56–58 Peaks at 160.8 eV and 161.9 eV confirm the presence of S2− in forming the Sn–S bond which is in good agreement with the literature.56,57 Moreover, the formation of S–C bonds in the heterostructure was detected as typified by two obvious peaks at 163.2 eV and 164.7 eV.59 From the literature, such shifts in the binding energy can be understood in terms of the electron allocation between the g-CN and SnS2 films since they have different electron concentrations as shown in Fig. S3.†60,61 The bonding peaks for Sn–S are almost vanished in the heterojunction at high temperatures because S will diffuse and even vaporize as long as the annealing temperature is sufficiently high, in line with the atomic concentration measurement shown in Table S1,† given that no S can be observed at temperatures above 500 °C. More importantly, as the temperature increases, the nitrogen content also decreases, implying the formation of nitrogen vacancies, which is well supported by the decrease of the peak at 287.5 eV in C 1s spectra.
To further understand the underlying mechanism for the interfacial bonding behaviour in the g-CN/SnS2 heterostructure, we then performed density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Indeed, from the calculations we observed that some atoms at the SnS2/g-C3N4 interface tend to transfer across the SnS2/g-C3N4 interface, in particular, the S atom. The calculations were performed on the basis of the fact that the N vacancy is a common native defect in the g-CN film; and then we examined the transition behaviour of the interfacial atoms in terms of the transition barrier and migration path, as shown in Fig. 4. From the results, we can infer that i) the total energy of the heterostructure will be reduced by ∼0.8 eV as the S atom is transferred from the SnS2 side to g-C3N4, indicating that the heterostructure becomes more stable upon interfacial atom transition, in line with the XPS results which give the signature of several newly created bonds typified by C–S and Sn–S coordination; ii) there should be a moderately high potential barrier (∼0.6 eV) along the interfacial atom transition path, which explains why an annealing treatment with a certain temperature of ∼400 °C is crucial for such a heterojunction structure as well as the resulting improvement of PEC performance (as will be discussed later). The ideal structure of layered SnS2 consists of a Sn atom at the centre site surrounded by six S atoms which in turn forms a six-fold Oh-like coordination, and the transition of S atoms at the interface will reasonably reduce the coordination number of Sn–S which offers the possibility for the interfacial Sn atoms to bind with N as elucidated in XPS measurement. From another point of view, the interfacial atom transition spontaneously introduces self-doping at the g-CN/SnS2 interface, which is beneficial to the PEC performance in accordance to the charge transfer doping model proposed in a previous study.62 However, as the temperature is further increased, the S atom may leave the interface and vaporize into the environment. Therefore, a suitable annealing temperature is supposed to be critical for the PEC performance.

To gain insight into the improved PEC process from a physiochemical perspective, the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra were used to study the optical performance of the isolated SnS2 and g-CN thin films as well as their heterojunctions annealed at different temperatures, as shown in Fig. S4.† The absorption edge of the g-CN film occurs typically at 420 nm which corresponds to a bandgap of ∼2.95 eV, in line with former experimental measurements48–50 and also agrees with the calculated bandgap of 2.72 eV, showing a light absorption region approximately in the spectrum of visible light. The heterojunction annealed at 400 °C shows an enhancement in the visible light absorption and photon harvesting capability in comparison with that of the g-CN film alone, which can be ascribed to the enhanced interfacial interaction between g-CN and SnS2 at certain temperatures. Such an interface model plays a key role in improving the separation of photogenerated carriers and in turn boosting the photoelectrochemical performance.
For relating the band alignment with water redox potentials and observing the photocatalytic activity, the band order for pure SnS2, pure g-CN and g-CN/SnS2-400 °C is described. Accordingly, the reason underlying the bandgap reduction turns out to be the lowering of the CB edge rather than the upward shift of the VB edge. The slightly lowered VB edge of the photoelectrodes would improve the overpotential enhancing the OER in water, as depicted in Fig. 5(a). The photocatalytic reactions are activated when the photocatalyst (g-CN/SnS2) absorbs photons, forming an electron–hole pair which migrates to the working electrode surface inducing oxidation and reduction reactions. This regime is further supported by our DFT calculations. The calculated band structure of the g-C3N4/SnS2 heterostructure shows that the VBM of the system is dominated by the g-C3N4 states, whereas the CBM of the system is dominated by the SnS2 states, as shown in Fig. 5(b). That is, upon the formation of such a heterostructure, the CBM of g-C3N4 will be overlapped by the SnS2 state, which is lower in energy, thus giving rise to a lower CBM which in turn reduces the bandgap. By illuminating such a heterojunction, photoexcited electrons from the CB of g-CN transfer to the CB of SnS2 and likewise for holes thereby forming a type II heterojunction, contributing to the charge separation and the lowered recombination rate thus taking part in photocatalytic activity. Photoexcited electrons in the CB of SnS2 take part in direct hydrogen production from the electrolyte (reducing water to hydrogen) while the OER occurs at the counter electrode.63

For successful adhesion of the SnS2 film onto the surface of g-CN, we examined the PEC performance of pristine g-CN and SnS2 in comparison with their heterojunctions as photoanodes at varying annealing temperatures in the atmosphere of nitrogen detailing the effect of g-CN/SnS2 nanocomposites on PEC activities. The three-electrode configuration was used with 0.2 M Na2SO4 as the electrolyte to determine the PEC performance. Fig. 6(a) displays the photocurrent response from g-CN, SnS2 and its nanocomposites with several cycles of on–off. The g-CN/SnS2-400 °C composite shows the highest photocurrent density among all the samples, again confirming the fact that the g-CN/SnS2-400 °C heterojunction can release more photogenerated carriers and lower the charge recombination rate in sharp contrast to the isolated g-CN, SnS2 and g-CN/SnS2 composites annealed at temperatures other than 400 °C. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) was carried out under 1.5G illumination as shown in Fig. 6(b), g-CN/SnS2-400 °C boosts the photocurrent density to 125 μA cm−2,43 and the photoinduced current density of g-CN/SnS2-500 °C turned down to 25 μA cm−2 (ref. 43) at 1.23 V vs. RHE. At 400 °C annealing temperature, the photocurrent of the g-CN/SnS2-400 °C film is intensified by a factor of 5 and 4 times in comparison with pure g-CN and SnS2. The enhanced PEC performance indicates improved charge transport and favorable charge separation in nanocomposites depending on the optimized annealing temperature.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was then carried out to further evidence the assisted charge migration activity in heterojunctions. The equivalent Randles–Ershler (R–E) circuit model was used for the simulation of the PEC process. In the Nyquist plots, the effective charge separation is indicated by the smallest arc diameter of the semicircle.64 The faster charge relocation process at the interface is also determined by the smaller arc diameter of the semicircle in the Nyquist plots. In Fig. 7, the smaller diameter of the semicircle, as typified by the g-CN/SnS2-400 °C nanocomposite, supports the fact that the interface between g-CN and SnS2 annealed at 400 °C suppresses the resistance between the working electrode and electrolyte for the charge transfer, again demonstrating the influence of annealing on the separation of photoinduced excitons.

To gain insight into the electronic structures of pure SnS2, g-CN and their nanocomposites, it is important to resolve the band structure and band alignment of the heterojunctions via PEC measurement based on the Mott–Schottky (MS) plots. The influence of the heterostructure on the flat band potential and free carrier density can be obtained by the interpretation of MS plots.65 As shown in Fig. 8, all the samples exhibit an n-type characteristic as revealed by their positive slopes. The steepest slope of g-CN/SnS2-500 °C symbolises the lowest free carrier density. By tuning the annealing temperature of the heterojunctions, the free carrier density can be increased simultaneously. Usually, the enhanced charge carrier density guarantees increased bulk electrical conductivity. The intercept of the slope shifts after loading SnS2 on g-CN and afterwards annealing at various temperatures, indicating a substantial band bending in the space charge zone. Such an increase in the band bending not only improves the separation of charge carriers but also slows down the charge recombination rate at the interface of the electrode and electrolyte which agrees with the Nyquist plot. The values of the CBM of the samples derived from the MS method agree with the estimated values of the XPS data, with the CB edge lowered slightly by forming a heterojunction.

The PL spectra are used to understand the photoinduced interfacial charge process. Both SnS2 and g-CN were then measured by using an excitation wavelength of 325 nm, as shown in Fig. S6(a).† The pristine g-CN film exhibits an intense emission peak at ∼450 nm. However, when the SnS2 solution was spin coated on the surface of g-CN followed by annealing treatment at 400 °C, the intensity of this emission peak declined significantly. This implies that the interfacial charge transfer between g-CN and SnS2 films to a large extent prohibits the recombination of photoinduced charge carriers, and therefore lowers the charge carrier recombination rate of g-CN/SnS2-400 °C.
The photostability for long-lasting PEC applications was also characterized as shown in Fig. S6(b);† the heterojunction shows approximately good photostability by maintaining 90% of its initial photocurrent illuminated for 1 h. This remarkably high photostability of the nanocomposite film is largely due to the strong extraction of photogenerated holes and electrons at the interface of a junction. In a structure of the isolated g-CN, carbon and nitrogen are not as thermally stable as those stabilized by a layer of SnS2 at a certain temperature. With respect to C–N bonds, the superficial Sn–N and C–S bonds are not easily broken by oxidizing species which ensures better long-term stability. After the PEC test, the increase in the surface roughness of bare g-CN and SnS2 films versus g-CN/SnS2 (from AFM) strongly indicates that the former two samples degrade more rapidly than their heterojunctions, which explains the reason why such nanocomposite structures offer better photostability.
4 Conclusions
In conclusion, g-CN/SnS2 heterojunctions have been fabricated by TVC and spin coating methods followed by annealing in a N2 atmosphere with different temperatures. The ultrathin hexagonal SnS2 films loaded horizontally on the thin film of g-CN present significantly boosted photocatalytic performance due to the lower charge recombination rate and efficient separation of photoinduced electron–hole pairs at the interface, as compared to pure g-CN and SnS2 films. Such heterojunctions demonstrate the significance of long wavelength photon harvesting, charge transfer activities and amplification of photocurrent density by 3.5 times with considerably better photostability compared to that of pristine g-CN films. The experimental studies combined with the density functional theory calculations revealed that such heterostructures could reduce the bandgap by lowering the CB and VB positions and prolong the charge carrier lifetime by varying orbital distributions. This work provides an insight for heterojunction based photocatalysts with effective charge separation and enhanced photocatalytic activity for improved PEC performance.
