    , Accepted 26th October 2015First published on 27th October 2015AbstractAlthough the one-step deposition method has intensively been studied because of the simple and easy fabrication of perovskite films, uncontrolled crystallization of perovskite during one-step deposition often results in films with small crystallites and low surface coverage, leading to low photovoltaic performance. In this study, we have proposed the optimum processing conditions to afford a favorable crystal morphology of perovskite films for achieving high power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. Two different morphologies, tree-like and flower-like morphologies, are developed depending upon the spin-coating time and post-heat treatment temperature. When the perovskite is crystallized from the liquid film after a short spin-coating time, the flower-like morphology is developed, whereas the tree-like morphology is developed when the perovskite is crystallized for a long spin-coating time. When the morphology evolution is monitored using in situ optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction to investigate the origin of the difference between tree-like and flower-like morphologies, it reveals that the CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complex is formed to develop the tree-like morphology before CH3NH3PbI3 crystals are formed, whereas the flower-like morphology is developed when the CH3NH3PbI3 crystals are formed directly from the liquid film without the formation of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complex. The film with a flower-like morphology, as prepared from DMSO solution, has large-sized crystallites, and the crystallites are highly orientated along (112) and (200) directions, resulting in a high PCE of 13.85%, whereas the film with a tree-like morphology has small-sized crystallites with random crystal orientation, exhibiting very low PCEs.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic perovskites such as CH3NH3PbI3, CH3NH3Pb(IxBr1−x)3 and HC(NH2)2PbI3 are promising light absorbers because they have superior properties including broad light absorption from UV to near-IR range,1,2 high extinction coefficient,3,4 long diffusion length of free charge carriers,5,6 low exciton binding energy7–9 and excellent charge carrier transport.10,11 Since perovskite-based photovoltaics were introduced in 2009 by Kojima et al.,12 a dramatic enhancement of device performance has been achieved.13
Although the use of mesoporous scaffolds such as TiO2 or Al2O3 for perovskite solar cells has achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 11%,14–17 bilayer structures have recently attracted more interest because of their simple structure and high PCEs comparable to those of meso-structured solar cells.18–22 In particular, organic photovoltaic (OPV)-type planar devices (TCO/PEDOT:PSS/perovskite/PCBM/Al) have recently been studied because of their unique advantage of low-temperature processing compared to dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)-type planar devices (TCO/compact-TiO2 (c-TiO2)/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/Au) in which the c-TiO2 layer requires high temperature sintering (>450 °C).
In OPV-type planar devices, the morphology control of perovskite films plays a crucial role, and the requirements for the suitable morphology of perovskite films to achieve high photovoltaic performance have been proposed: first, good surface coverage of perovskite films reduces the shunting path and also improves light absorption.14 Second, perovskite films with a large crystal size facilitates the transport of photo-generated charge carriers.15 Third, low defect density mitigates the hysteresis in the photocurrent (J)–voltage (V) curve by suppressing the charge trapping.16–18
Until now, the most used method to fabricate perovskite films is one-step deposition due to its cost-effectiveness, simplicity and easy fabrication, although other fabrication methods such as sequential deposition (two-step deposition)19 and vacuum deposition20 have been proposed. However, uncontrolled solidification of perovskite precursor solution during one-step deposition often results in films with low surface coverage20 and therefore intensive efforts have been focused on improving the surface coverage of perovskite films by one-step deposition. Recently, several methods have been reported to control the morphology of perovskite films for the active layer of solar cells: the choice of processing solvent,21–23 the addition of solvent additives,24–28 anti-solvent washing,29,30 and fast deposition-crystallization.15 Consequently, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) over 12% have recently been achieved by one-step deposition.
Herein, we report a simple method to fabricate high quality CH3NH3PbI3 films to afford high efficiency perovskite solar cells and also elucidate the different film formation mechanisms depending upon the processing conditions. Finally we propose the optimum processing conditions to obtain high quality perovskite films. The tree-like morphology with many pinholes is developed when the film is fabricated by the conventional one-step deposition, where the solidification due to solvent evaporation is accompanied by crystallization during spin-coating. However, when the spin-coating time is shortened so as to avoid the solidification during spin-coating, CH3NH3PbI3 is not crystallized during spin-coating. The liquid film is then crystallized by post heat-treatment at high temperature (110 °C), resulting in a flower-like morphology covering the substrate fully without pinholes. In particular, when a perovskite film is fabricated from DMSO solution by spin-coating for a short time followed by heat-treatment, the film exhibits a flower-like morphology with a large crystal size of tens of micrometers and highly preferred crystal orientation to the substrate. The devices with a tree-like morphology exhibit low PCEs due to the formation of shunting pathway through pinholes, while those with a flower-like morphology show remarkably improved PCEs.
Results and discussion
Photovoltaic properties
It has been reported that the perovskite films processed by one-step deposition have low surface coverage with many pinholes due to uncontrolled solidification during the spin-coating process.20 To overcome this problem in this work, the spin-coating time is controlled when the perovskite films are fabricated by one-step deposition of precursor solution (CH3NH3I:PbI2 = 1:1 molar ratio) using two different solvents, DMF and DMSO. When the current density–voltage (J–V) curves are measured with an OPV-type device configuration of glass/ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CH3NH3PbI3/PC61BM/Ca/Al under AM 1.5G illumination, the open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current (JSC) and fill factor (FF) are largely improved as the spin-coating time is decreased (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of devices fabricated from DMF solution increases from 0.55% to 6.95% as the spin-coating time is decreased from 30 s to 3 s, and the PCE of devices fabricated from DMSO solution also increases from 0.22% to 13.85% as the spin-coating time is decreased from 90 s to 15 s, indicating that the device performance becomes better as the spin-coating time is decreased. It should be noted here that all devices are heat-treated at 110 °C for 30 s after spin-coating. Furthermore, the PCEs of the devices fabricated from the best processing conditions exhibit a small standard deviation less than 0.4%, indicating that highly efficient perovskite solar cells can be obtained reproducibly by simply reducing the spin-coating time (Table 1 and Fig. S7†). Also, it is interesting to observe that J–V curves of our devices are hysteresis-less (Fig. S1†).

Morphological control
To identify the reason why the devices show performance difference depending upon the spin-coating time, we monitored the change of film state with the spin-coating time. It should be mentioned here that the effect of the substrate on the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 film is excluded because the PEDOT:PSS layer is coated on the substrate before CH3NH3PbI3 is deposited during the device fabrication process. As shown in Fig. 2, the liquid film from DMF solution starts to solidify between 5 and 10 s after spin-coating. The color of the liquid film before solidification is yellow (<5 s), which is the same color as the color of DMF bulk solution, and after solidification (≥10 s) the color changes from yellow to white and subsequently to brown. The color change by solidification is also observed in the film processed by DMSO solution. The color of the film spin-coated from DMSO solution remains yellow until 60 s of spin-coating time after which the color is changed to white due to solidification. It should be noted here that the liquid film from DMSO solution requires a longer spin-coating time to solidify than DMF solution due to its higher boiling temperature (189 °C) and lower vapor pressure (0.42 mmHg) than those of DMF (153 °C, 2.7 mmHg). Considering that the solidification during spin-coating is closely related to the device performance, it is concluded that the device performance becomes better when the spin-coating time is short so as to prevent solidification of the liquid film during spin-coating.
 Fig. 2  The change of film state with different spin-coating times using DMF and DMSO solutions before heat treatment. Dashed lines denote the point at which the liquid film starts to solidify. 
When the films spin-coated for various spin-coating times are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s to complete the formation of the CH3NH3PbI3 solid film, the films show different morphologies depending upon the spin-coating time, as shown in the optical microscopy (OM) images of Fig. 3. Independent of the processing solvent, heat-treatment of liquid films develops the flower-like morphology with a circular domain shape (Fig. 3a and e–g), while the heat-treatment of films after solidification during spin-coating develops a film morphology containing many pinholes (Fig. 3b–d and h).
 Fig. 3  OM images of CH3NH3PbI3 films formed from different solvents and various spin-coating times. The films are fabricated from (a–d) DMF and (e–h) DMSO solution for different spin-coating times. All films are spin-coated at 3000 rpm and are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s immediately after spin-coating. 
The microscopic morphologies of perovskite films as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) also show that the films spin-coated for a short time, which is not enough to solidify the liquid film, exhibit the flower-like morphology after heat-treatment (Fig. 4a and b) while the films spin-coated for longer times exhibit a tree-like morphology containing many pinholes (Fig. 4c and d). Magnification of SEM images reveals that the crystal domains in all films are not composed of a single crystal but many micro-crystals (insets of Fig. 4). Another important feature is that the size of individual CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites grown from DMSO solution is much larger than that grown from DMF solution. In particular, the film with a flower-like morphology as developed from DMSO solution consists of large crystallites with the scale of tens of micrometers and good surface coverage. When the crystal morphologies of films are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), as shown in Fig. 5, the HRTEM image of the film with a flower-like morphology, as developed from DMSO solution, reveals a large crystal plane with the lattice fringe indexed only to the (004) plane, whereas the image of the film with a flower-like morphology fabricated from DMF solution shows multiple crystal planes such as (201) and (410). The multiple crystal planes indicate that the film fabricated from DMF solution is composed of smaller CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites with different crystal orientations (Fig. 5a), while the HRTEM image of the film from DMSO solution exhibits only one crystal plane (Fig. 5b). This is direct evidence that the crystallites in the film fabricated from DMSO solution are much larger in crystal size than the crystallites in the film fabricated from DMF solution, although the two films show a flower-like morphology.

 Fig. 5  HRTEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 films with a flower-like morphology. The films are spin-coated at 3000 rpm and are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s immediately after spin-coating. 
The above observation leads us to conclude that a long spin-coating time enough to solidify the liquid film develops a tree-like morphology with many pinholes which may provide shunting pathways and thus reduce the solar cell efficiency, while a short spin-coating time not enough to solidify during spin-coating develops a flower-like morphology with good film coverage which affords high photovoltaic performance. Specifically, when the film with a flower-like morphology, as spin-coated for a short time (15 s) from DMSO solution, is used as the active layer, the device exhibits a much higher PCE (13.85%) than the device (PCE = 0.22%) fabricated by spin-coating of DMSO solution for a long time (90 s). The higher efficiency of the device fabricated from short-time spin-coating of DMSO solution may arise from a larger crystal size and preferred crystal orientation in the film (which will be discussed in the next Section), which facilitates the charge transport and reduces defect density. To reveal the reason for high efficiency of the device with a flower-like morphology, we measured bulk recombination times of devices using an impedance analyzer.18 Devices with a flower-like morphology show a longer bulk recombination time (which may afford higher efficiency) than devices with a tree-like morphology (Fig. S8†) probably due to the larger crystal size of the flower-like morphology, indicating that the charge recombination in the bulk film is closely related to the film morphology.
To reveal the origin of the difference between tree-like and flower-like morphologies, the development of morphology in liquid films, prepared by controlling the spin-coating time (3 s for DMF solution and 30 s for DMSO solution) to prevent solidification, is monitored by in situ OM, as shown in Fig. 6 (see also video files in ESI†). When the liquid film from DMF solution is dried at room temperature, colorless crystals start to grow at 60 s of standing and grow slowly for the next 20 s. When the dried film was heat-treated at 110 °C, the color of crystals changed from colorless to dark brown, retaining the tree-like morphology. The same phenomenon is also observed in the film spin-coated from DMSO solution at room temperature, indicating that the tree-like morphology is developed by the growth of colorless crystals (Fig. 6a). However, when liquid films spin-coated from both DMF and DMSO solutions are heat-treated at 110 °C immediately after short spin-coating times, the color of nuclei is dark brown and the crystals rapidly grow in a circular shape (Fig. 6b).
 Fig. 6  
In situ OM images of crystal growth in liquid films (a) at room temperature and (b) at 110 °C. The liquid films prepared from DMF and DMSO solutions are spin-coated for 3 s and 30 s, respectively. 
When the crystal structure of colorless crystals in the film dried at room temperature was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 7, the XRD pattern of the dried film from DMSO solution exhibits several primary peaks between 5 and 10°, which are the same as the diffraction peaks of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO complex,29 indicating that the colorless crystals are formed from the CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO complex. However, the crystal structure of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMF complex has not been reported, although it was reported that a DMF molecule coordinates to Pb in PbI2 to form the PbI2–DMF complex31 and the XRD pattern of the PbI2–DMF complex crystal was also reported.32 Since the XRD pattern of the film dried from DMF is different from the reported XRD pattern of the PbI2–DMF complex crystal, the colorless crystals formed from DMF solution should not be the crystals of the PbI2–DMF complex. Fourier transform infrared spectra (Fig. S9†) provide another evidence of complex formation of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent: vibration peaks of CO of DMF and SO of DMSO in the spectra of PbI2–solvent complexes are shifted to a shorter wavenumber as compared with the corresponding peaks of pure DMF and DMSO due to the interaction between PbI2 and the solvent molecule, and the vibration peaks in the spectra of CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complexes are further shifted because both CH3NH3I and PbI2 interact with the solvent molecule.33 Hence it is reasonable to assume that the colorless crystals are the crystals of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMF complex. When the crystals of CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complexes are heated at 110 °C, the (110) peak of CH3NH3PbI3 at 14.2° grows while the diffraction peaks of complex crystals between 5 and 10° disappear accompanied by the color change from colorless to dark brown in in situ OM images (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, formation of the complex crystals can also be identified in XRD patterns of the films as solidified during spin-coating (compare Fig. 7 with Fig. S3†), indicating that the crystals of CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complexes are formed by solidification during spin-coating. Therefore, it can be concluded that the crystals of CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complexes are formed when the solidification occurs during spin-coating or when the liquid films after short spin-coating time are placed at room temperature for a long time and that the crystals of the complexes grow in a one-dimensional direction, leading to the tree-like morphology of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals.
 Fig. 7  XRD patterns of films fabricated from DMF and DMSO solution. Liquid films are solidified by standing the films at room temperature for >20 s (DMF) or >60 s (DMSO). The solidified films are thermally treated at 110 °C until the peaks of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complex disappear. 
The color change of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complex crystal during heat treatment at 110 °C is due to the evaporation of solvent molecules which participated in the complex formation. However, when the liquid films after a short spin-coating time are heat-treated at 110 °C, CH3NH3PbI3 crystals (flower-like morphology) are directly formed without the formation of complex crystals, because solvent molecules are evaporated before the complex crystals are formed. When the liquid film is annealed at different temperatures, a tree-like morphology is developed by annealing at 60 °C, and a flower-like morphology is developed at 100 °C. A mixed morphology of tree-like and flower-like morphologies is developed at 80 °C probably due to the competition between the formation of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complex crystal and solvent evaporation without the formation of the complex crystal (Fig. S4†).
CH3NH3PbI3 crystal orientation
The above observation tells us that the crystal formation of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complex is closely related to the film morphology and the orientation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites. Considering the fact that the same crystal structure, corresponding to the tetragonal structure of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite, is observed in the powder XRD patterns of all films (Fig. S5†), the difference between thin-film XRD patterns (Fig. 8) indicates that CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites have different orientations depending on the film morphology. The XRD patterns of films with a tree-like morphology show strong (002) and (110) peaks dominantly while the patterns of films with a flower-like morphology exhibit strong (112) and (200) peaks.
 Fig. 8  XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 films with flower-like and tree-like morphologies as prepared from DMF and DMSO solution. All films are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s immediately after spin-coating. 
The crystal orientation in CH3NH3PbI3 films can clearly be identified by 2D grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) and its azimuthal angle (χ) scans (Fig. 9). The CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites in the films with tree-like morphologies, as-prepared from DMF and DMSO solutions, do not show preferential orientation (Fig. 9a and b) while the crystallites in the films with a flower-like morphology are preferentially oriented along (112) or (200) directions to the substrate (Fig. 9c and d). In particular, the film from DMSO solution exhibits spot-like reflections with strong intensity, indicating that the CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites are highly oriented. Since the edges of the PbI6 octahedron in the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal contact with the substrate (see Fig. 10), indicating that CH3NH3PbI3 crystallites are oriented along (112) or (200) directions, the crystals with a flower-like morphology are oriented in such a way that edges of the PbI6 octahedron contact with the substrate. This result leads us to conclude that the orientation of CH3NH3PbI3 crystals is strongly dependent on the film morphology, which can be easily controlled by varying the spin-coating conditions. Considering that preferential orientation of perovskite crystals affords high PCEs, the crystal orientation must be one of the important factors determining the solar cell performance, although the effect of crystal orientation on photovoltaic properties of CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite has not been fully understood and therefore further studies should be needed to reveal the orientation effect.

Conclusions
We have investigated the effect of solidification during spin-coating in one-step deposition on the morphology of the CH3NH3PbI3 film and its photovoltaic performance. In situ OM and XRD studies reveal that the solidification during spin-coating is accompanied by the formation of CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complex crystals, which induces the crystal growth in a one-dimensional direction. The crystal growth in a one-dimensional direction yields a tree-like morphology with many pinholes in the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite film, resulting in very low PCEs of solar cell devices. However, when the solidification during spin-coating is suppressed by shortening the spin-coating time and thereafter CH3NH3PbI3 is crystallized directly from the liquid film after spin-coating by post heat-treatment, a flower-like morphology is developed in the film with a high surface coverage and large crystal size. Specifically, the film from DMSO solution showing a flower-like morphology has large-sized crystallites on the length scale of tens of micrometers and the crystallites in the film are highly orientated along (112) and (200) directions, resulting in a high PCE of 13.85%. This observation demonstrates that the solidification accompanied by complex formation during spin-coating should be avoided for high performance perovskite solar cells. Hence, the direct crystallization from the liquid film without the formation of the complex crystal is a promising method for achieving high performance perovskite solar cells.
Experimental
Substrate preparation
ITO (10 Ω per sq., KETI) coated glass was cleaned by stepwise sonication in acetone and IPA for 30 min each. After complete drying, the ITO coated glass was treated with UV-ozone for 15 min. PEDOT:PSS (Heraeus Clevios P VP AI 4083) was spin-coated on the ITO with 40 nm in thickness and the substrate was annealed at 150 °C for 20 min under ambient conditions.
Fabrication of perovskite solar cells
CH3NH3PbI3 and PC61BM layers were deposited in a N2-filled glovebox. DMF and DMSO precursor solutions were spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS at 3000 rpm. The substrate spin-coated with precursor solution was immediately transferred to a hot plate and heated at 110 °C for 30 s. PC61BM was then spin-coated on the CH3NH3PbI3 layer at 3000 rpm. Finally, a calcium (25 nm) and aluminum (100 nm) cathode was thermally evaporated under vacuum (<10−6 Torr) on the PC61BM layer through a shadow mask to obtain a device area of 0.1 cm2.
Characterization

In situ OM images were obtained by using a Leica MPS 30 microscope and SEM images were obtained by using a JSM-6700F (JEOL). XRD patterns of powder and films were obtained by using a X-ray diffractometer (D8 Advance, Bruker) using Cu-Kα1,2 radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å) at a scan rate of 2° min−1. GIXD measurements were performed at 6D C&S UNIST-PAL beam-line of Pohang Accelerator Laboratory in Korea. The X-rays coming from the in-vacuum undulator are monochromated (wavelength, λ = 1.2398 Å) using a Si(111) double-crystal monochromator and focused horizontally and vertically (300 (H) × 30 (V) μm2 in FWHM@sample position) using a K-B type mirror system. The GIXD sample stage is equipped with a 7-axis motorized stage for the fine alignment of the sample and the incidence angle of X-ray beam was set to 0.2°. GIXD patterns were recorded with a 2D CCD detector and the X-ray irradiation time was 120 second. Diffraction angles were calibrated by using a pre-calibrated sucrose (monoclinic, P21, a = 10.8631 Å, b = 8.7044 Å, c = 7.7624 Å, and b = 102.938°) and the sample-to-detector distance was about 235.5 mm. J–V curves of photovoltaic cells were obtained using a computer-controlled Keithley 4200 source measurement unit under AM 1.5G (100 mW cm−2) simulated by an Oriel solar simulator (Oriel 91160A). The light intensity was calibrated using a NREL-certified photodiode prior to each measurement. The EQE was measured using a Polaronix K3100 IPCE measurement system (McScience). The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystal Si cell. JASCO FT-IR-660 plus was used to collect FT-IR spectra. The spectra of DMF and DMSO were measured in liquid phase and the spectra of PbI2–DMF, CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMF, PbI2–DMSO and CH3NH3I–PbI2–DMSO were measured in powder samples using KBr pellets. Impedance spectroscopic measurements were carried out using an impedance analyzer (Bio-Logic VMP3) with various potentials from 0 to 0.8 V in the dark. AC 10 mV perturbation was applied with a frequency from 1 MHz to 100 Hz. The obtained spectra were fitted with EC-Lab software.

 	Fig. 2  The change of film state with different spin-coating times using DMF and DMSO solutions before heat treatment. Dashed lines denote the point at which the liquid film starts to solidify.	 

 	Fig. 3  OM images of CH3NH3PbI3 films formed from different solvents and various spin-coating times. The films are fabricated from (a–d) DMF and (e–h) DMSO solution for different spin-coating times. All films are spin-coated at 3000 rpm and are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s immediately after spin-coating.	 

 	Fig. 4  SEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 films with (a and b) flower-like and (c and d) tree-like morphologies fabricated from (a and c) DMF and (b and d) DMSO solution. All films are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s immediately after spin-coating.	 

 	Fig. 5  HRTEM images of CH3NH3PbI3 films with a flower-like morphology. The films are spin-coated at 3000 rpm and are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s immediately after spin-coating.	 

 	Fig. 6  
In situ OM images of crystal growth in liquid films (a) at room temperature and (b) at 110 °C. The liquid films prepared from DMF and DMSO solutions are spin-coated for 3 s and 30 s, respectively.	 

 	Fig. 7  XRD patterns of films fabricated from DMF and DMSO solution. Liquid films are solidified by standing the films at room temperature for >20 s (DMF) or >60 s (DMSO). The solidified films are thermally treated at 110 °C until the peaks of the CH3NH3I–PbI2–solvent complex disappear.	 

 	Fig. 8  XRD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 films with flower-like and tree-like morphologies as prepared from DMF and DMSO solution. All films are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s immediately after spin-coating.	 

 	Fig. 9  2D GIXD patterns of CH3NH3PbI3 films with (a and b) tree-like and (c and d) flower-like morphologies fabricated from (a and c) DMF and (b and d) DMSO solution. All films are thermally treated at 110 °C for 30 s after spin-coating.	 

 	Fig. 10  Unit cell of the tetragonal CH3NH3PbI3 crystal. The C, N, I and Pb atoms are represented as brown, light blue, purple and black spheres, respectively, and black octahedrons represent PbI6 units. Solid lines indicate (a) (002), (b) (110), (c) (112) and (d) (200) planes.
