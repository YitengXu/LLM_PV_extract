    , Accepted 6th June 2016First published on 7th June 2016AbstractIn this work, molybdenum carbide microspheres (Mo2C-Ms) and nanorods (Mo2C-Nr) are synthesized for use as counter electrode (CE) catalysts in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), specifically towards the regeneration of iodide-free redox couples of T2/T− and Co3+/2+. In the T2/T− based DSSCs, the prepared Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr both show high catalytic behavior, and the devices generate power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of 5.50% (Mo2C-Ms) and 4.86% (Mo2C-Nr), respectively, much higher than the Pt CE based counterpart (3.73%). Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and Tafel polarization curve measurements reveal that Mo2C-Ms also show higher catalytic activity for the Co3+/2+ redox couple that is competitive with the traditional Pt CE. The device using a Mo2C-Ms CE achieves a high PCE of 8.70%, indicating great potential to replace the expensive Pt CE.
Introduction
As photoelectric conversion devices, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have garnered considerable interest due to their merits of environmental friendliness, simplicity of the fabrication process, and applicability to Building Integrated Photovoltaics.1,2 Reaching commercial viability, however, requires that power conversion efficiency (PCE) be further enhanced and fabrication cost be reduced. The traditional pathway to enhance the PCE is to design dyes and mesoporous semiconductor films to achieve more efficient light absorption.3,4 To lower the cost of DSSCs, much effort has been made to exploit the alternatives to replace the expensive Pt counter electrode (CE). To date, several Pt-free CE catalysts have indeed been developed, such as carbon materials, polymers, and metal compounds.5–14
Among these Pt-free materials, metal carbides have performed particularly as CEs due to their advantages of high catalytic activity, stability, and corrosion resistance. Lee et al. prepared a WC CE for DSSCs which produced a PCE of 7.01%.15 The Ma group introduced large-scale commercial Mo2C as a CE for iodide-electrolyte-based DSSCs, producing a PCE of 5.70%.16 They further prepared nano-scale Mo2C and found that the PCE rose to 5.83%.17 In addition, the researchers found that there exists an interaction between the CE and the redox couple, as the CE functions as a catalyst to regenerate the redox couple. For the conventional I3−/I− redox couple, Pt remains a suitable CE, but it is not effective for iodide-free redox couples.18,19 These findings imply that optimizing the CE for a given redox couple is a feasible means to both improve the PCE and reduce the cost of DSSCs. The CE catalyst and the redox couple therefore demand investigation on par with the more extensively-studied dye and semiconductor components.
In this work, we have designed and synthesized Mo2C microspheres (Mo2C-Ms) and nanorods (Mo2C-Nr) using facile methods. Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr were then used as CE catalysts in DSSCs. The catalytic activity of Mo2C-Ms in the regeneration of redox couples, e.g. polysulfide (T2/T−) and cobalt complex (Co3+/2+), was evaluated. We characterized the morphology and the inner structure of Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD). The electrochemical behaviours were evaluated by using cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Tafel polarization curves. Finally, the photovoltaic performance of T2/T− and Co3+/2+ electrolyte-based-DSSCs was studied using photocurrent density–voltage curves.
Experimental
1. Preparation of Mo2C nanorods (Mo2C-Nr)
2.73 g of MoCl5 was added to 8 mL ethanol under stirring for 30 min to form a Mo-orthoester. Next, 7.20 g of urea was added to the obtained Mo-orthoester solution and stirred until the urea was completely dissolved. Subsequently, the viscous solution was dried at 120 °C to get rid of the residual solvent and a urea-metal precursor was obtained. After sintering the precursor at 800 °C for 4 h under a N2 atmosphere, Mo2C-Nr were collected.
2. Preparation of Mo2C microspheres (Mo2C-Ms)
Resorcinol (0.3 g) was first dissolved in 50 ml water with stirring at 25 °C, followed by the addition of formaldehyde (37 wt%, 0.4 ml), producing a clear solution. Next, ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate (0.6 g) was added to the above-prepared solution, and the clear solution became a white emulsion. After several minutes of stirring, the resultant emulsion was transferred into an autoclave hydrothermally aged for 10 h at 160 °C. A polymer product was obtained after purifying several times with water by centrifugation and drying in an oven at 60 °C for 10 h. Finally, Mo2C-Ms were achieved by pyrolysis of the polymer product at 1100 °C for 3 h in a N2 atmosphere.
3. Cell fabrication
The Mo2C CE was prepared using the spray coating technique. In detail, 200 mg of Mo2C (microspheres or nanorods) was dispersed in 5 mL of isopropanol, ultrasonically dispersed for 30 min, and the Mo2C suspension was achieved. The prepared suspension was then sprayed onto FTO glass and the thickness of Mo2C films was controlled around 30 μm. In this step, the carrier gas was air; spray pressure was set at 0.2 MPa, the spray distance from the spray equipment to the FTO glass substrate was controlled at 8 cm. Subsequently, the FTO glass coated with Mo2C films was sintered under a N2 atmosphere at 450 °C for 30 min and the Mo2C CE was obtained.
The Pt electrode on FTO glass was fabricated by thermal decomposition as follows: isopropanol solution containing chloroplatinic acid (0.5 wt%) was sprayed on FTO glass for 5 s. The resulting FTO glass coated with chloroplatinic acid was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min, and the Pt electrode was obtained.
As for the photoanode, a pre-cleaned FTO glass was immersed into a 40 mM aqueous TiCl4 solution for 20 min, then, washed with distilled water, and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min to form a blocking layer. The obtained FTO glass with a blocking layer was further coated with a 5.0 μm-thick or a 12 μm-thick second layer of TiO2 nanoparticles followed by sintering at 500 °C for 30 min to achieve the mesoporous TiO2 films. The prepared 12 μm-thick TiO2 film was pre-heated to 80 °C and immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of N719 dye in acetonitrile/tert-butylalcohol (1:1 volume ration) for 16 h and the N719 sensitized photoanode was achieved for the T2/T− electrolyte based DSSCs. The prepared 5 μm-thick TiO2 film was pre-heated to 80 °C and immersed in a 2 × 10−4 M solution of the YD2-o-C8 dye in ethanol for 20 h and the YD2-o-C8 sensitized photoanode was achieved for Co3+/2+ electrolyte based DSSCs. Two types of redox electrolytes were used in this work: a sulfide electrolyte containing 0.4 M Na+ T−, 0.4 M di-5-(1-methyltetrazole) disulfide (T2), 0.05 M LiClO4, and 0.5 M TBP in 6:4 (v/v) acetonitrile/ethylene carbonate; a cobalt electrolyte composed of 0.25 M Co(II) tris(bipyridyl) tetracyanoborate, 0.05 M Co(III) tris(bipyridyl) tetracyanoborate, 0.5 M TBP and 0.1 M LiTFSI in acetonitrile.
The DSSCs consist of a photoanode, a CE, and an electrolyte. The active area of the DSC was 0.16 cm2. The symmetrical cell was fabricated with two identical CEs clipping the electrolyte for EIS and Tafel polarization tests.
4. Measurements
XRD measurements were carried out using an automatic X-ray powder diffractometer (D8 advance, Bruke Corporation). XPS measurements were conducted using an XPS spectrometer (ESCALAB250, Thermo, USA). The morphologies of Mo2C were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM, H-7650, Hitachi, Japan). N2 adsorption–desorption experiments were carried out isothermally at 77 K on a NOVA4000e Automated Surface Area Analyzer (Quantachrome, USA), and the surface area was calculated using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method. The square resistance of the carbides was obtained using a multifunction digital four-probe tester (ST-2258C, Suzhou Jingge Electronic Co., Ltd). EIS experiments were performed using symmetrical cells with an electrochemical workstation system (CHI 660E, Chenhua, Shanghai). The measured frequency ranged from 100 mHz to 1 MHz. The amplitude of the alternating current was set at 10 mV. Tafel polarization curve measurements were tested with an electrochemical workstation system in a symmetrical dummy cell. The scan rate was 10 mV s−1. CV measurements were carried out in a three-electrode system in an argon-purged electrolyte solution at a scan rate of 20 mV s−1 using an electrochemical workstation system. Pt wire served as the counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode. The Co3+/2+ electrolyte is composed of 0.01 M Co2+, 0.001 M Co3+, 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile. The current density–voltage performance of the DSSCs was investigated under simulated AM 1.5 illumination (I = 100 mW cm−2, PEC-L01, Peccell, Yokohama, Japan).
Results and discussion
1. Material synthesis and characterization
We designed Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr to catalyze the regeneration of the iodide-free redox couples of T2/T− (Fig. S1, ESI†) and Co3+/2+ (Fig. S2, ESI†). Mo2C-Ms are synthesized as shown in Fig. 1. In brief, molybdatetetrahydrate and phenolic resin were used as metal and carbon sources, respectively (see Experimental section for details). The XRD pattern of our Mo2C-Ms is reproduced in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks at 34.58, 37.86, 39.58, 52.42, 61.82, 69.72, 75.06, and 75.92 degrees can be assigned to the crystal planes of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (112), and (201), respectively, for Mo2C (no. 11-0680, PDF-2 Database). At the same time, Mo2C-Nr were synthesized through the common urea-metal route reported by our previous work.17 From the XRD patterns, we can see that Mo2C-Nr have a higher crystallinity than Mo2C-Ms.

To confirm the formation of Mo2C-Ms, XPS as a powerful surface-sensitive technique for identifying the chemical state of materials is carried out. In Fig. 3a, two peaks at 18.1 eV and 282.7 eV suggest the presence of a molybdenum carbide component, corresponding to the binding energy of C (1s) and C (2s).20Fig. 3b gives a close-up of the fitted XPS spectra of Mo (3d) and the peaks centred at 233.4 eV and 230.5 eV correspond to Mo (3d3/2) and Mo (3d5/2). The peaks appearing at 397.2 eV and 413.0 eV correspond to the Mo (3p3/2) and Mo (3p1/2) orbitals. Fig. 3c represents a close-up of the fitted XPS spectra of Mo (4p) which splits into two peaks at 38.3 eV and 40.9 eV corresponding to Mo (4p3/2) and Mo (4p1/2). Finally, a weak peak at 63.8 eV corresponds to the binding energy of Mo (4s). Both XRD and XPS verify that Mo2C-Ms were successfully synthesized.

Fig. 4 shows the SEM and TEM images of the morphologies of the precursor and Mo2C compounds. In Fig. 4a, the precursor of Mo2C-Ms appears as a sphere with 5–7 μm diameter and a regular honeycomb pattern covers the sphere surface. From Fig. 4b and c, it is clear that Mo2C-Ms are monodisperse, with a solid spherical profile. The sphere diameters range from 2–3 μm. Fig. 4d describes that Mo2C-Nr assume a typical rod shape with strong aggregation, of which the lateral diameter is approximately 15–25 nm and the longitudinal diameter is 45–55 nm. The BET surface area of Mo2C-Ms is 29.6 m2 g−1, higher than that of Mo2C-Nr (16.8 m2 g−1). The XRD, SEM, and TEM measurements proved that the Mo2C-Nr and Mo2C-Ms have been synthesized successfully. To compare the conductivity of the two carbides, square resistance of the carbides was checked, Mo2C-Ms (10.36 Ω □−1), Mo2C-Ms (10.70 Ω □−1). There was no significant difference in conductivity between Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr.

2. Catalytic behaviour of Mo2C for T2/T− and Co3+/2+ redox systems
Although I3−/I− is the most commonly used redox couple and Mo2C indeed shows a satisfactory catalytic activity in the I3−/I− reaction,15,16 the iodide electrolyte has drawbacks of high corrosivity and short-wavelength light absorption.21 We therefore studied the catalytic performance of Mo2C for the iodide-free redox couples of T2/T− and Co3+/2+. Beginning with T2/T−, Fig. 5 depicts the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves of the DSSCs using Mo2C-Ms, Mo2C-Nr, and Pt CEs. The resulting photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table S1 (ESI†). The PCE of Pt CE based DSSCs is only 3.73%. As we know, in quantum-dot sensitized solar cells, Pt or other noble metal always show poor catalytic activity for the polysulfide redox couple (Sx2−/S2−), caused by the catalyst poisoning. We can not help but imagine that in the DSSCs system, Pt may be poisoned by the T2/T− redox couple, leading to a poor catalytic activity and a subsequent poor performance of the DSSCs. When the Pt CE is replaced with Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr we find that the PCE values are enhanced to 5.50% and 4.86%. These results indicate that the Mo2C CEs are more suitable than Pt for the T2/T− redox couple regeneration. Obviously, the catalytic efficiency of Mo2C-Ms is superior to that of Mo2C-Nr. However, the PCE values of the T2/T− based DSSCs are generally lower than those for I3−/I− based DSSCs, due to their lower Voc caused by the narrow gap between the quasi-Fermi level of TiO2 and the redox potential of the T2/T− electrolyte; or by poor recombination of the photoelectron with T2, leading to charge leakage.22 The authors suggest that even though performance of T2/T− based DSSCs using Mo2C CEs is poorer than the iodide electrolyte based device, previously reported CV and EIS experiments still demonstrate that Mo2C is an excellent catalyst for the regeneration of T2/T−.23 Tuning the redox potential of the organic sulfide redox couple by modifying the substituent group in the tetrazole and suppressing the recombination of the photoelectron by modifying the photoanode semiconductor film are promising paths to pursue high efficiency polysulfide redox couple based devices.

The low performance of T2/T− based DSSCs shifted attention towards Co3+/2+.24,25 Although the Pt CE has a high catalytic activity for the Co3+/2+ redox couple, the high cost and limited reserves of Pt still motivate exploration of Pt-free CE catalysts. Herein, we introduced the prepared Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr into the Co3+/2+ system as replacement of Pt. Fig. 6 is the J–V curves of the Co3+/2+ based DSSCs using Pt and Mo2C CEs and a zinc-porphyrin dye (YD2-o-C8, Fig. S3, ESI†). The resulting photovoltaic parameters are summarized in Table 1. With the Mo2C-Nr as a CE, the corresponding device gives a relatively low PCE of 6.97% with a low FF of 0.59. While the Mo2C-Ms CE yields a high catalytic activity and the PCE of the device reaches 8.70% with Voc = 853 mV, Jsc = 15.23 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.67. That is 92.5% of the performance of the Pt CE based DSSCs (9.41%). Mo2C-Ms present a better performance in any aspects than Mo2C-Nr. Besides, the Co3+/2+ based DSSCs perform much better than the T2/T− based DSSCs, benefiting from an improved FF and Jsc, which are caused by the low consumption of the high driving force (Eox/red − EHOMO:dye).26

To evaluate the catalytic activity of Mo2C CE catalysts in the Co3+/2+ redox couple, CV was carried out as reported in previous work.27 In Fig. 7, all of the Mo2C and Pt electrodes show typical cyclic voltammograms with one pair of redox peaks corresponding to the Co3+/2+ redox reaction. The Pt or Mo2C electrode works as a catalyst, where Co3+ is regenerated to Co2+ which is the key step for the regeneration of the redox couple.28 The CV profiles of Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr are similar to Pt, indicating a competitive catalytic activity in the regeneration of Co3+/2+. On one hand, the current density order is Pt > Mo2C-Ms > Mo2C-Nr. On the other hand, the cathodic potential of the redox peaks of Mo2C-Ms is approximately 0.079 V, while the anodic potential is 0.322 V. The peak-to-peak separation (ΔEP) is 0.243 V, very close to the ΔEP of Pt. Moreover, as ΔEP varies inversely with the charge transfer rate (ks), the Mo2C-Ms electrode exhibits large ks compared to Pt, indicating a high fast reaction velocity of Co3+/2+ on the Mo2C-Ms electrode.29 The CV results reveal that Mo2C-Ms are promising CE catalysts for the regeneration of Co3+/2+. As for Mo2C-Nr, the cathodic potential of the redox peaks is approximately 0.067 V, while anodic potentials are 0.346 V. Thus, the ΔEP of Mo2C-Nr is 0.279 V, indicating a lower catalytic activity compared to Mo2C-Ms.
 Fig. 7  Cyclic voltammograms of Mo2C-Ms, Mo2C-Nr, and Pt electrodes for the Co3+/2+ redox electrolyte. 
EIS is an effective method for investigating the charge transfer process of the redox couple at the electrode/electrolyte interface.30Fig. 8a depicts the typical Nyquist plots; the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 1. In a typical Nyquist plot, the intercept on the real axis can generally be assigned to the series resistance (Rs). The left arch can be assigned to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) of the electrode/electrolyte interface. The right arch can be assigned to the diffusion impedance (ZN) of the redox couple (Co3+/2+) transport in the electrolyte.
 Fig. 8  (a) Nyquist plots and (b) Tafel curves of the Mo2C-Ms, Mo2C-Nr, and Pt electrodes for the Co3+/2+ electrolyte. 
There is no obvious difference in Rs between the three electrodes. The Rct of Mo2C-Ms is 2.39 Ω cm2, higher than Pt (1.32 Ω cm2), demonstrating a smoother redox reaction of Co3+/2+ on the Pt electrodes than the Mo2C-Ms electrode. If the regeneration of the redox couple is determined only by the charge transfer process, we can deduce that the catalytic activity of Mo2C-Ms is much lower than Pt. We observe however that the catalytic activity of Mo2C-Ms is very close to Pt. We attribute this inconsistency to the diffusion-limitation of the redox couple. The Mo2C-Ms present much lower ZN value, 1.78 Ω cm2, compared to Pt (10.38 Ω cm2). Mass transport of Co3+/2+ on the Mo2C-Ms electrode is smooth because of the spacious diffusion channel, as revealed in the SEM and TEM analysis above mentioned. This improved mass diffusion compensates for inferior charge transfer to give Mo2C-Ms comparable catalytic performance to Pt.
For the two Mo2C electrodes, the Rct of Mo2C-Nr is 6.70 Ω cm2, much higher than that of Mo2C-Ms, indicating a smooth redox reaction of Co2+/3+ on the Mo2C-Ms, rather than on the Mo2C-Nr electrode. This may be caused by the bad aggregation of the Mo2C-Nr, decreasing the active surface where the redox reaction takes place. In addition, Mo2C-Nr show a much higher ZN value (8.35 Ω cm2), demonstrating a higher diffusion resistance and a slower mass transport of Co2+/3+ for the Mo2C-Nr, as compared to Mo2C-Ms. In a word, the regeneration rate of the redox couples on the catalytic-active planes of the carbide electrodes, the amount of the active planes, and the diffusion rate of the redox couples should be responsible for the different performance of the two Mo2C catalysts.
Finally, Tafel polarization curve measurements were performed to confirm catalytic activities. As shown in Fig. 8b, Mo2C-Ms show relatively low exchange current densities (J0) compared to Pt. According to eqn (1), Rct is inversely proportional to J0. We can deduce that the Rct of Mo2C-Ms is therefore larger than Pt, in agreement with the EIS results. Furthermore, the limiting diffusion current density (Jlim) of Mo2C-Ms is larger than that of Pt. According to eqn (2), under the same potential, a larger Jlim indicates a larger diffusion coefficient (D), implying a larger mass transport rate of the redox couple and producing a lower ZN value as confirmed by EIS. Both the EIS and Tafel curve results demonstrate that the Mo2C-Ms can catalyse the regeneration of the cobalt redox couple as effectively as Pt. In addition, the Mo2C-Nr present lower Jlim and J0 as compared with Mo2C-Ms, indicating a relatively low catalytic activity, which is in good agreement with the results of EIS and J–V measurements. (1)where R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the electron number involved in the reaction of Co3+/2+, and F is the Faraday's constant. (2)where l is the spacer thickness, C is the concentration of the redox couple; F and n retain their established meanings.
Conclusions
Replacing the expensive Pt CE with a low-cost Pt-free CE catalyst is a promising route for reducing the fabrication cost of DSSCs. In this work, we show that Mo2C-Ms and Mo2C-Nr CEs outperform Pt for the regeneration of the T2/T− redox couple. In a cobalt redox system, the Mo2C-Ms CE based device yielded a high PCE of 8.70%, practically enabling the replacement of Pt.
