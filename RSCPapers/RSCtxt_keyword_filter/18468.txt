    , Accepted 4th July 2019First published on 5th July 2019AbstractOwing to their high cost and safety hazards, and the low abundance of Li in natural resources, the future of Li-ion batteries is becoming difficult. To replace Li-ion batteries, aqueous multivalent ion batteries are considered to be a worthwhile choice. In particular, aqueous zinc ion batteries are becoming an attractive option due to the natural abundance and unique properties of zinc. However, as for the Li-ion battery, the Zn-ion battery also has its own inadequacies in terms of cathodes. Finding a suitable cathode material for Zn-ion batteries with adequate structural stability and high capacity is an uphill task for researchers.

1. Introduction
As the consumption of energy increases worldwide and more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, there is a huge demand for the development of new energy technologies, to secure clean energy supplies for the future. To utilize today's energy resources more efficiently, there is a significant demand for storing electric power, not only for mobile electronic devices but also for effectively exploiting renewable resources such as solar and wind power.1,2 To store green energies, batteries are regarded as one of the greatest inventions. Research on battery technologies such as the Pb-acid battery, Ni–Cd battery, Na–S battery and Li-ion battery (LIB) has been going on for decades. Even though battery technology has attained many breakthroughs, their performance is still not satisfactory for the ever-growing globalization. Among the above-mentioned technologies, LIB is considered as one of the important milestones in the energy storage field. The extensive research on this excellent technology has led to the important development of smartphones, personal computers and smart grids. However, the future of LIBs in large-scale applications is hindered by some important factors, such as cost, lifetime, and safety issues. On the other hand, aqueous batteries with water-based electrolyte hold a natural advantage for the aforementioned factors, when compared to the expensive and flammable non-aqueous LIBs. Another benefit of aqueous batteries is the lower fabrication cost, as they do not require strict oxygen- and water-controlled manufacturing environments. The progress of aqueous battery systems has been going at a rapid pace in recent years, which include monovalent Li+, Na+ and K+ and divalent Mg2+ and Zn2+ systems.3–9
Owing to their low cost and high operational safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries are considered to be a promising class of batteries for grid-scale electrochemical energy storage. In addition to that, compared to non-aqueous electrolytes, aqueous electrolytes offer much higher ionic conductivities, which favour high rate capabilities. Of late, rechargeable multivalent ion batteries such as zinc ion batteries (ZIBs), aluminium ion batteries (AIBs), and magnesium ion batteries (MIBs) have attracted the attention of many researchers as they deliver high volumetric energy density (based on the metal anode: Zn, 5851 mA h mL−1; Al, 8046 mA h mL−1; Mg, 3833 mA h mL−1).10–15 In general, energy density of multivalent ion batteries tends to increase due to the presence of high-capacity multivalent metals as the anode. When compared, after the intercalation process, if the occupied intercalation sites are the same between a Li-ion system and a multivalent ion battery system, the attained capacity will be higher for the multivalent ion battery than the LIB. This is due to the fact that multivalent ions can transfer two or three electrons per ion.16 Though multivalent ion batteries possess some advantages over LIB systems, they are not endowed with suitable intercalation cathode materials as those of LIBs. However, in recent times this particular area has gained attention and the results are promising, but the available literature is still insufficient. Fig. 1 shows Ragone plots comparing the performances of various ZIB, AIB and MIB materials.
 Fig. 1  Ragone plots comparing the performances of various ZIB (ref. 7, 8, 51, 61, 74, 76, 80, 85, 86, 89, 119, 139, 141 and 142), AIB (ref. 11, 14, 143–148) and MIB (ref. 149–162) materials published elsewhere. 
Among the multivalent ion batteries, the MIB system is the most explored. In rechargeable batteries, magnesium metal is considered as an ideal anode material due to its low reduction potential (−2.37 V), high volumetric capacity (3833 mA h cm−3), and low price, and also to its being the eighth most abundant element in the earth's crust.17,18 The ionic radius of Mg2+ ions is 0.72 Å which is very close to the ionic radius of Li+ ions (0.76 Å). However, the high electric density of Mg2+ ions will result in a strong polarization effect and sluggish diffusion process in cathode materials.17,19 This sluggish kinetics is attributed to the stronger electrostatic interaction between the divalent Mg2+ ions and the host material ending up in low or even no Mg2+ intercalation in many cathodes.19,20 This electrostatic interaction might arise from the repulsion between the charges of Mg2+ ions and positive charges within the transition metal compounds. Besides, a positively charged surface can be created by the surface-adsorbed Mg2+ ions which leads to the inversion of surface charge, which may further limit the access of Mg2+ ions from bulk electrolyte to the surface of the host material.21
Due to the high abundance, high gravimetric density, lower reactivity and easier handling of aluminium, the AIB is also considered to be a good option for rechargeable batteries. In contrast to Li- and Na-ion batteries, AIB involves three-electron redox processes during the electrochemical charging and discharging cycles leading to high capacity.22–24 Comparing with lithium, aluminium has four times higher volumetric capacity (8.04 A h cm−3), which is also higher than that of many other metals. However, restrictions on suitable cathode materials, electrolytes, insufficient cycle life, degradation of cathode materials, and declining capacity rate hinder its usages. Besides, AIBs suffer from corrosion in aqueous electrolytes, which leads to the formation of a passive surface layer on the electrode and thereby reducing the cell voltage and efficiency.22,25
On the other hand, aqueous ZIBs based on Zn2+ intercalation chemistry are gaining a lot of attention among researchers due to zinc's high capacity (820 mA h g−1), high abundance and low cost, low redox potential (−0.76 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) and impressive electrochemical stability in water due to a high overpotential for hydrogen evolution.9,16,26 Furthermore, issues of dendritic zinc in alkaline zinc cells can be overcome by replacing alkaline electrolyte with a mild neutral pH (or slightly acidic) solution, which in turn reduces the environmental impact and operational cost.27 With the problem of anode and electrolyte being almost resolved, the lack of appropriate intercalation cathodes hampers the practical application of aqueous ZIBs. Table 1 gives a comparison of some important properties of Zn2+ ions versus other available charge carriers. Though the radii of Zn2+ ions (0.74 Å) and Li+ ions (0.76 Å) are similar, the larger atomic mass and high positive polarity hamper the transport kinetics and solid-state solubility in a bulk electrode. Hence, electrode materials suitable for Li+ ion insertion/extraction may not work out for aqueous ZIBs. Despite this, many works have been published and various cathode materials for ZIBs have been proposed due to the large-scale application potential of this system. However, the high rate performance and cycling sustainability of these materials are still unsatisfactory. This is probably due to the dissolution of elements, self-aggregation and phase change during the insertion of Zn2+. Hence, novel approaches to design new nanostructures to provide better structural integrity and fast and short Zn2+ migration channels are desired. Fig. 2a illustrates a scheme of the first ever aqueous ZIB designed with MnO2 cathode, zinc anode and a mild ZnSO4 electrolyte. Here, the anodic zinc dissolves as Zn2+ ions during the discharge process, which then rapidly diffuse and intercalate into an α-MnO2 cathode to engender an electron current flow in the electrical loop.28 In ZIBs, aqueous electrolytes are preferred over organic electrolytes since aqueous electrolytes are safer, cheaper and easier to handle during the fabrication process. Furthermore, the high reduction potential and lower energy densities of Zn-based batteries make nonaqueous electrolytes unheeded. Apart from that, generally aqueous electrolytes possess high ionic conductivity which is useful in getting high rate performance and also the cost of the overall battery becomes lower, since aqueous ZIBs do not require meticulous atmosphere control, such as dry room and glovebox. So far, many works have been devoted to ZIBs in order to explore their potential as a rechargeable battery system. Fig. 3 depicts the various important strategies evolved over the years for enhancing the performances of ZIBs.

Due to the increasing number of publications and rapid developments happening in ZIBs, a few good reviews were published on ZIBs discussing the new designs and development of zinc anodes, cathodes and various electrolytes of ZIBs.29–31 Additionally, there are some review articles discussing the progress of flexible Zn-based batteries and Zn–air batteries.32,33 However, this review is solely focused on the most recent developments of cathode materials used for aqueous ZIBs. Further, this review also gives an in-depth view on challenges of existing cathode materials and strategies developed recently to tackle them. As this new battery system has attracted the attention of many researchers of late, we believe this review article might help upcoming and existing researchers who work on ZIBs.
2. Storage mechanism of ZIBs
For alkali ion storage systems based on Li, Na, Mg and Al, the alkali-ion insertion/de-insertion could occur based on three important mechanisms, namely intercalation, alloying and conversion. Among the three mechanisms, intercalation is well understood and the most adopted mechanism by researchers. The intercalation mechanism has merit in the great development of LIBs. Whereas, the alloying mechanism is usually accompanied by a large volume expansion thereby affecting the capacity of the cell. Lastly is the conversion mechanism in which at least two separate phases will be formed and decomposed via conversion reactions.34 Though ZIBs are a very hot field among researchers recently, the reaction mechanisms involved in the storage process have been a topic of debate since the reaction mechanisms in aqueous ZIBs are complex and immature. However, based on the available literature, reaction mechanisms of aqueous ZIBs can be classified into three categories which are insertion/extraction of Zn2+, co-insertion/extraction of H+/Zn2+ and chemical conversion reaction.7,9,28,35–37 The schematic diagram in Fig. 4 shows a typical example of Zn2+ intercalation/de-intercalation process in a Na2V6O16·nH2O cathode. Here, upon discharge, Zn2+ intercalates into the layered structure of Na2V6O16·nH2O; however while charging, the de-intercalation process occurs.9 Based on the above mentioned reaction mechanisms many cathode materials for aqueous ZIBs have been proposed so far. To date, derivatives of manganese oxides, vanadium and vanadium metal oxides, Prussian blue analogues, polyanion compounds and Chevrel phase compounds have been reported as high-performance aqueous ZIB cathodes.29,38–40Table 2 provides information of various ZIB cathode materials, such as operating voltage, discharge specific capacity with respective current densities and the electrolyte used. The storage mechanism, challenges and advancements of these cathode materials are summarized and discussed in the following section.

3. Cathode materials and their mechanisms
The cathode is one of the important components of a battery system; during discharge, positive ions from the anode migrate into the cathode and thereby generate electrons. Hence, cathodes are crucial in obtaining an efficient battery system. As discussed above, although most of the shortcomings have been addressed in the anodes and electrolytes of aqueous ZIBs for grid-scale renewable energy storage systems, the lack of appropriate intercalation cathodes compared to LIBs has always been a hindrance for commercialization of ZIBs. Unfortunately, electrode materials suitable for Li+ ion insertion/extraction turned out to be incompatible for aqueous ZIBs owing to the larger atomic mass and high positive polarity. To resolve this issue, significant efforts and investigations have been carried out on various cathode materials for ZIBs. However, the high rate performance and cycling sustainability of these materials are still unsatisfactory. Hence, there is a need for novel approaches for designing new nanostructures and to provide better structural integrity for the fast kinetics of Zn2+ and short transportation path for Zn2+ migration. Developments and challenges of various cathode materials used so far in ZIBs are discussed in this section. In addition, strategies to overcome the shortcomings of these materials in recent times along with future directions are also given in this section.
3.1. Manganese oxides
Manganese oxide materials are some of the most abundantly available materials in the earth's crust. Due to their low cost and environmental benignity, Mn-based oxide materials were extensively utilized in many battery applications. Similarly, with high operating voltage and a theoretical capacity of ∼308 mA h g−1 (for 0.5 M Zn in MnO2), Mn-based materials have become popular cathode materials for ZIBs. In general, various arrangements of fundamental MnO6 octahedra through corner/edge sharing lead to different polymorphs of manganese dioxide as shown in Fig. 2b–d. These polymorphs are broadly classified into three categories: (i) tunnel-based, (ii) layer-based and (iii) spinel-based structures of MnO2.

(i). Tunnel-based MnO2 polymorphs. 
Among the three classifications, tunnel-based MnO2 polymorphs have many types which are varied by their tunnel sizes. These include hollandite-type MnO2 (α-MnO2) with 2 × 2 tunnel, pyrolusite-type MnO2 (β-MnO2) with 1 × 1 tunnel, nsutite-type MnO2 (γ-MnO2) which consists of 1 × 1 and 1 × 2 tunnels, ramsdellite-type MnO2 (R-MnO2) built by corner sharing 1 × 2 tunnels, and lastly romanechite- and todorokite-type MnO2 with 2 × 3 and 3 × 3 sized tunnels, respectively. Among the above, todorokite-type MnO2 with a tunnel size of 3 × 3 can accommodate various cations and water molecules due to its large-sized tunnels. Besides, β-MnO2 with 1 × 1 tunnel has better thermodynamic stability than the others. However, due to its narrow tunnel, chances for the diffusion of cations are not good.


(ii). Layer-based MnO2 polymorphs. 
Layer-based polymorphs of MnO2 (δ-MnO2) are formed by the arrangements of MnO2 octahedra into sheets via edge sharing. Interlayers between these sheets can be accommodated with water molecules or other cations, which are responsible for the expansion of interlayer distance. With the insertion of various water molecules and other cations, different layered structures with different interlayer distances can be obtained. Birnessite-type and buserite-type structures are examples of layer-based MnO2 polymorphs with one layer and two layers of water molecules, respectively.


(iii). Spinel-based MnO2 polymorphs. 
Apart from above two types, spinel-based hausmannite structure (λ-MnO2) is another polymorph of MnO2 where tetrahedral and octahedral sites are occupied by Mn2+ and Mn3+, respectively. These types do not have tunnels or layers; instead they are closely packed. Spinel-type structures are often represented as AB2O4, where A is a vacancy and B represents Mn; one such example is ZnMn2O4.
Storage mechanisms and recent progress. 
ZIBs have become an appealing topic ever since the pioneering work of Kang et al. in 2012.28 They proposed a safe and eco-friendly power-type battery, which is made up of a zinc anode, MnO2 cathode and a mild ZnSO4 aqueous electrolyte. They found that, in a mild aqueous solution containing Zn2+ ions, zinc can rapidly dissolve as Zn2+ ion and deposit reversibly. They claimed that Zn2+ ions can be reversibly intercalated into tunnels of α-MnO2 in the same mild system which is evidenced by their XPS results. XPS data indicate that the ratio of Zn/Mn during insertion and extraction state is 0.52 and 0.05, respectively.28 A typical reaction mechanism of the Zn2+ insertion/extraction process is given in the following equations:
Cathodic reaction: Zn2+ + 2e− + 2α-MnO2 ↔ ZnMn2O4(1)
Anodic reaction: Zn ↔ Zn2+ + 2e−(2)
The same research group also synthesized α-, δ-, γ-, and β-MnO2 with different crystal structures and found that the capacity of MnO2 strongly depends on its crystallographic forms, and there is no direct relationship between specific capacity and surface area. Further, they reported that the capacity of MnO2 came from the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions into/from tunnels of MnO2 instead of the surface area. δ-MnO2 with a layered tunnel structure shows the highest specific capacity (269 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1) in a potential window of 1.0–2.0 V, which is due to the significant interlayer separation and larger tunnel size.38
Later, Oh et al. reported that a reversible transition of MnO2 polymorphs was involved in the intercalation of zinc into the 2 × 2 tunnel of α-MnO2 ([001] direction) from a tunnelled to a layered structure (δ-MnO2) driven by the electrochemical reactions at the cathode.41 Besides, they found that after discharging, the phase of MnO2 is Zn–birnessite with an interlayer distance of 7 Å. Further, they observed that the manganese present on the tunnel wall is actively dissolved into the electrolyte and at the end of discharge, almost 1/3 of the total manganese in α-MnO2 is extracted from the structure without collapsing and the electrolyte becomes highly concentrated with manganese ions. At 1C rate, the cell retained a capacity of 120 mA h g−1 which is about 60% capacity retention compared to C/10 rate without any changes in the potential window. However, during the charging process, the ions return to the cathode to reversibly incorporate into the layered structure to construct MnO6 bridges between the layers thereby forming 2 × 2 tunnels of α-MnO2. But, in a subsequent report the same group reported that formation of Zn–birnessite does not occur directly from the insertion of zinc into α-MnO2, but it arises from the loss of intercalated zinc ions and water molecules from the layers of Zn–buserite. Hence, they concluded that the mechanism behind the process involves a reversible phase transition between tunnelled (α-MnO2) and layered (Zn–buserite) MnO2 polymorphs, which is induced by a series of single- and two-phase electrochemical reactions on the cathode.42 Apart from the birnessite and buserite, manganese dioxide with 3 × 3 tunnels bearing todorokite crystallographic structure was also investigated as a zinc-ion intercalating material. Though the specific capacity and practical discharge of todorokite-based cathode material are low, its capacity retention is 40% better than α-MnO2. This is attributed to the larger tunnel size of todorokite for zinc-ion diffusion.43–45
Though considerable attention has been given to the MnO2 cathodes, their development is severely affected by the significant phase changes and structural collapse during the cycling process which leads to the poor cycling stability of the cell. To address this issue Huang et al. designed a polyaniline (PANI)-intercalated layered manganese dioxide which drastically improves the cyclability.46 The presence of polymer strengthens the layered structure of manganese dioxide and eliminates the occurrence of phase changes. This is further facilitated by the nanosized manganese dioxide. Fig. 5a shows a schematic representation of PANI-intercalated MnO2 layers. This layer-by-layer assembly is formed by the simultaneous occurrence of chemical oxidation polymerization of aniline and the reduction of MnO4 at the interface of the organic phase (CCl4 containing aniline monomer) and the inorganic phase (KMnO4 aqueous solution). Besides, the diffusion of aniline from the organic phase to the inorganic phase and the production of PANI confine the growth of MnO2 to two dimensions. Lastly, a mesoporous structure was formed by the combination of PANI-intercalated MnO2 nanolayers. When tested as cathode for ZIBs, PANI-intercalated MnO2 cathode delivered a specific capacity of 280 mA h g−1 at a current density 200 mA g−1 (Fig. 5b) which was better than the previously reported values of MnO2 cathodes. Further, at a high current density of 3 A g−1 it was capable of delivering 110 mA h g−1 (Fig. 5c). They analysed the reason behind this enhanced behaviour by using ex situ XRD, Raman spectra and HRTEM analysis. They found a co-insertion behaviour of H+ and Zn2+ without collapsing the layered structure of PANI-intercalated MnO2.46Fig. 5d illustrates the co-insertion mechanism of H+ and Zn2+ in PANI-intercalated MnO2 nanolayers with a self-regulating function in the electrolyte. During the initial discharge stage, H+ inserts into PANI-intercalated MnO2 nanolayers, which causes a steady decrease of H+ concentration in the vicinity of the electrode. During the first discharge platform, there was no evidence for the formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate which was due to the very low OH− concentration. Whereas, in the second discharge caused by a Zn2+ insertion reaction along with a sustained decrease of H+ concentration, the formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate was observed. With the continuous Zn2+ insertion and H+ insertion, increased formation of flake-like zinc hydroxide sulfate is observed. It is further stressed that enhanced cyclic stability benefits from the “self-regulation function” which consumes the superfluous OH−.43 Similar co-insertion/extraction mechanism was also reported by Sun et al. for an aqueous Zn/MnO2 battery.37 Chen and co-workers reported Zn2+ intercalation using β-MnO2 cathode with an aqueous electrolyte containing 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 + 0.1 M Mn(CF3SO3)2. They observed that during first discharge, a phase transformation occurred from tunnelled β-MnO2 to layered Zn–buserite which is followed by the reversible de-intercalation of Zn2+ in layers of Zn–buserite structure.8 Very recently, Yang and co-workers demonstrated the occurrence of intercalation and conversion reactions in both Zn2+/H+ at different voltages in a Zn/MnO2 system. Further, rapid capacity fading is reported due to the rate-limiting and irreversible conversion reactions at lower voltages. This rapid capacity fading is prevented by limiting the irreversible conversion reactions at lower voltages. Hence, to limit the these irreversible conversion reactions cells were tested at higher rates which resulted in high energy and power densities of 300 W h kg−1 and ∼2 kW kg−1 at 3C (1.032 A g−1), ∼231 W h kg−1 and ∼4 kW kg−1 at 9C (3.096 A g−1), along with ∼105 W h kg−1 and ∼15 kW kg−1 at 30C (10.32 A g−1) with a very minimum capacity fading.47

Apart from intercalation of Zn2+ and co-insertion of Zn2+/H+, a third mechanism based on the conversion process is also proposed for α-MnO2. Liu et al. proposed this mechanism based on conversion between α-MnO2 and H+.7 Here, a proton from water reacts with MnO2 to form MnOOH; however a large flake-like ZnSO4[Zn(OH)2]3·xH2O solid was formed due to the following reactions between OH− ions and ZnSO4/H2O in the aqueous electrolyte. The electrochemical reaction mechanism equations are as follows:
Cathodic reaction: H2O ↔ H+ + OH−(3) MnO2 + H+ + e− ↔ MnOOH(4) (5)
Anodic reaction: Zn ↔ Zn2+ + 2e−(6)
They further confirmed the conversion mechanism between α-MnO2 and H+ by carrying out the reaction in an organic Zn2+ based electrolyte, where H+ was absent. The resulting specific capacity is a minimum; however after adding H2O with the same organic electrolyte the resulting capacity is similar to that of aqueous electrolytes.7 In 2015, Knight et al. reported that Zn2+ ion diffusion is hampered by the strong electrostatic repulsion between the Zn2+ ions in a tetrahedral and a neighbouring octahedral site which makes Zn extraction impossible from a ZnMn2O4 spinel. Further, they added that the ideal spinel structure cannot be a suitable ZIB cathode material unless the formation of cation vacancies in the structure is implemented, which opens up more diffusion pathways.48 Inspired by the above conclusion, Zhang et al. proposed a cation-defective ZnMn2O4 spinel as a viable Zn host material. They achieved a specific capacity of 150 mA h g−1 at a current density of 50 mA g−1; when cycled at 500 mA g−1 the cell exhibited a capacity retention of 94% after 500 cycles. They further stressed that the cation non-stoichiometry will play an important role in the future of multivalent-ion host materials.49
Recently, Kim et al. reported a mesoporous γ-MnO2 cathode which endured a series of structural transformations during the insertion of Zn2+ (Fig. 6).50 Upon the insertion of Zn2+, during the initial stage γ-MnO2 transformed into spinel-ZnMn2O4 phase; later in the intermediate stage it transformed into tunnel-type γ-ZnxMnO2 and layered λ-ZnyMnO2 phases. Further, after the complete insertion of Zn2+ all the above-mentioned phases co-exist. However, after the de-intercalation process all the structural transformations were reversed to the parent γ-MnO2 phase. The prepared γ-MnO2 cathode delivered an initial discharge capacity of 285 mA h g−1 in the potential range of 1.0–1.8 V vs. Zn2+/Zn at a current density of 0.05 mA cm−2.50 Further, Kim et al. also analysed the zinc-ion storage capability of layered δ-MnO2 nanoflakes. They assembled the cell under open atmospheric conditions which showed an open circuit voltage of 1.49 V. When cycled in the potential range of 1.0–1.8 V vs. Zn2+/Zn at a current density of 83 mA g−1, the cell exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 122 mA h g−1 and after 100 cycles it attained 112 mA h g−1. Irrespective of capacity fading, the coulombic efficiencies were maintained close to 100%.51 For achieving long cycle life, the morphological structure of the material needs to be stable. Guo et al. tackled this issue by tuning the morphology of δ-MnO2 into a hollow structure. They prepared MnO2 hollow spheres using SiO2 as a template with sizes ranging between 200 and 250 nm. At rates of 0.5, 1, 2, 5, and 10C, δ-MnO2 nanospheres showed good rate performances with specific discharge capacities of ∼405, ∼265, ∼166, ∼85, and ∼40 mA h g−1, respectively. In addition, they compared the cycling performances of nanosheets and nanorods with the performances of hollow spheres. After 100 cycles, δ-MnO2 hollow nanospheres showed a stable discharge capacity of 305 mA h g−1 with a coulombic efficiency around 97%. But, the capacity of MnO2 nanorods faded quickly, whereas MnO2 nanosheets displayed poor cycling performance with a low discharge capacity.52

In general, MnO2 electrodes exhibit low intrinsic electronic conductivity due to the high charge transfer resistance which limits the electrochemical performances.53,54 To address this issue, Xu et al. deposited MnO2 nanorods over the surface of acid-treated carbon nanotubes (CNT) with a negative charge to form MnO2/CNT nanocomposites. The negatively charged CNT after acid treatment easily attracted positively charged manganese metal and served as templates, which enhanced the formation of MnO2/CNT nanostructure. They reported that at the 10th cycle in the potential range between 1.0 and 1.9 V, two redox peaks were evidenced around 1.6 and 1.35 V, which should have been associated with the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions. They found that the specific capacity of the acid-treated MnO2/CNT electrode was better than that of the ordinary MnO2/CNT electrode. Further, the acid-treated MnO2/CNT electrode displayed specific capacities of 665, 540, 400 and 100 mA h g−1 for current densities of 0.1, 0.5, 1 and 5 A g−1, respectively.54 This enhanced electrochemical performance is credited to the acid-treated CNT, which have large surface and rich oxygen-containing functional groups such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. These carboxyl and hydroxyl groups can easily combine and tightly connect with MnO2 to form a highly conductive network, leading to excellent electrochemical performance.54,55 Islam et al. also explored the issue of low electronic conductivity in MnO2 with carbon coated α-MnO2 nanoparticles.55 They prepared carbon-coated α-MnO2 nanoparticles by stirring α-MnO2 nanoparticles in an ethanol/maleic acid solution at a mild temperature. Cycling performances of pristine MnO2 and carbon-coated MnO2 were tested at a current density of 66 mA g−1. After the 50th cycle, the pristine sample showed a capacity value of 135 mA h g−1, whereas the carbon-coated sample displayed 189 mA h g−1. Prior to this study, much literature reported an increase in the electrode resistance during long-term cycling, which leads to the capacity fading behaviour of pristine MnO2 electrodes. However, carbon-coated MnO2 electrodes increased the conductivity and reduced the resistance with repeated cycling. Also, dissolution of manganese from the MnO2 electrode during the electrochemical reaction could be effectively averted by carbon coating, which improves the stability of the electrode.54,55 Very recently, Wu et al. demonstrated a highly reversible aqueous ZIB using α-MnO2/graphene scrolls (MGS) as the cathode material and reported that the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) scrolls reduce the dissolution of MnO2 during cycling. Electrochemical performances were evaluated in the voltage range 1.0–1.85 V using 2 M ZnSO4 and 0.2 M MnSO4 electrolyte. However, the capacity increased with an increasing amount of rGO and 3.6% rGO content was optimized as the capacity remains stable after this. As a cathode material for ZIBs, MGS attained a capacity of 362.2 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.3 A g−1 (100 cycles). When tested for prolonged cycling it showed a capacity retention of 94% after 3000 cycles at 3 A g−1. Furthermore, they proposed a two-step intercalation mechanism as shown in Fig. 7a. Firstly, Zn ions insert into the water layers to form Zn–buserite; secondly, Zn ions further go deeper into the 2 × 2 tunnels of α-MnO2. The second step exhibits more volume change and electrostatic interaction than the first step, which is responsible for the slow insertion speed of Zn ions.56

Jiang and co-workers were first to report the use of manganese sesquioxide (Mn2O3) as a cathode material for ZIBs.57 The cycling performance of a cell based on ZnSO4 electrolyte at 100 mA g−1 in the potential range between 1.0 and 1.9 V gave an initial discharge capacity of 78 mA h g−1. This value increased for the initial few cycles but after 30 cycles the capacity decreased and was maintained at 117.2 mA h g−1 with capacity retention of 87%. Initial increase in capacity was attributed to the activation of the cathode and the decrease in the later cycles is attributed to the reversible intercalation/de-intercalation process. They further explored a hybrid electrolyte by using 2 M ZnSO4 and 0.1 M MnSO4 mixture, in order to enhance the electrochemical performance of the cell. Addition of Mn2+ in the electrolyte improves both the utilization of Mn2O3 and also the cycling performance. After 1000 cycles, at 2000 mA g−1 the cell with 2 M ZnSO4 and 0.1 M MnSO4 electrolyte delivered a capacity of 82.2 mA h g−1, while the cell with ZnSO4 electrolyte delivered only 38 mA h g−1. The reported reason behind this increased capacity by adding MnSO4 in the electrolyte is the presence of Mn2+ in the electrolyte that could change the equilibrium of Mn(II) dissolution, thereby stabilizing the electrode.57
Hao et al. tested Mn3O4 as cathode for aqueous ZIBs and found that electrochemical performance was superior to and different from a conventional MnO2 cathode.58Fig. 7b–e shows the electrochemical performance, rate and cycling performances of ZIB based on a Mn3O4 cathode. The cyclic voltammetry curves (Fig. 7b) are observed in a potential range between 0.8 and 1.9 V. Two reduction peaks at R1 and R2 are attributed to Zn2+ and H+ insertion, respectively. Further, shifting of peaks with increasing cycle numbers is ascribed to the more reversible electrochemical process. Further, region I and region II in Fig. 7c correspond to the Zn2+ and H+ insertion/extraction process. The Mn3O4 cathode delivered a discharge capacity of 232, 195, 163 and 124 mA h g−1 at current densities of 0.2, 0.5, 1 and 2 A g−1, respectively (Fig. 7d). The obtained capacity value at 2 A g−1 is the highest among other manganese oxide-based ZIB cathodes. Fig. 7e presents the cycling performance of Mn3O4 at 0.5 A g−1 current density. Moreover, they observed a phase transition of Mn3O4 to a layered-type birnessite over an intermediate product of Mn5O8 without the contribution of zinc ions during the initial charge process. On the other hand, intercalation of zinc ions into the interlamination of birnessite forms Zn–birnessite during the discharge process. Hence, de-intercalation of zinc ions from Zn–birnessite and the formation of birnessite in the charging process are reported as the factors responsible for the improved capacity.58 Very recently, Zhu et al. have grown Mn3O4 over a stainless steel mesh by a simple hydrothermal method and tested it as a ZIB cathode.59 The stainless steel mesh as a 3D material has the ability to provide stable backing to the actual material and provides high conductivity for electron transfer.48,60 While testing the electrochemical performance, they achieved a high specific capacity of 296 mA h g−1 after 50 cycles with capacity retention of 98% at 100 mA g−1 current density. Compared to bare Mn3O4 electrode, Mn3O4 flowers grown over the stainless steel mesh exhibited long cycling life and increased specific capacity at a current density of 500 mA g−1.
Though numerous works on MnO2-based cathodes for ZIBs have been reported in the past few years, the rate of publications is showing a significant reduction of late. This is because improving the capacity of MnO2-based zinc batteries through assembling various MnO2 polymorphs has come to a stage with few options. Hence, alternative strategies for enhancing the performance of MnO2-based ZIBs are needed. Recently, Xiong et al. proposed an oxygen-deficient MnO2 cathode for ZIBs. Here, the MnO2 lattice was modified with oxygen vacancies via surface chemistry modification. They investigated the effect of oxygen vacancies by fabricating ZIBs using MnO2 cathode with oxygen vacancies (Od-MnO2) and another one with a less deficient cathode (C-MnO2) for comparison. In an aqueous electrolyte containing 1 M ZnSO4 and 0.2 M MnSO4, the Od-MnO2 cathode exhibited a specific capacity of 345 mA h g−1, whereas the less deficient C-MnO2 cathode showed 270 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1. This enhancement in specific capacity was further investigated via ex situ XPS analysis. Results showed that a higher Mn2+/Mn4+ ratio of 2.09 was obtained for Od-MnO2 whereas C-MnO2 had a lower value of 0.83. However, after introducing oxygen vacancies the value gets increased to 1.95. This evidenced that oxygen-deficient MnO2 with greater electrochemical active surface area converts more Mn4+ to Mn2+ and thereby enhancing the overall performance of the battery.61 A similar strategy was also adopted by Liang et al. for a high-energy-density potassium-ion-stabilized and oxygen-defect K0.8Mn8O16 cathode for aqueous ZIBs.62 Wang et al. recently designed a unique mesoporous MnO2 flower-like nanosphere cathode stabilized by hydrated Zn2+ pillars for ZIB applications. Due to the unique mesoporous texture and high surface area, the cell exhibited a high specific capacity of 358 mA h g−1 at 0.3 A g−1 after 100 cycles. Furthermore, even at a high current density of 3 A g−1 the cell attained a capacity of 124 mA h g−1 after 3000 cycles. This remarkable performance is ascribed to the unique flower-like nanosphere morphology and the impact of hydrated Zn2+ ions in the MnO2 layers.63 Thus, defect engineering and modifying surface chemistry strategies could be the new way for designing and enhancing the electrochemical performance of MnO2 cathodes for ZIBs.

3.2. Prussian blue analogues
While exploring various cathode materials, Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) have emerged as potential materials with excellent cycle life and rate capability. PBAs with their non-toxic nature, lower cost and simple ways of synthesis make them interesting.64 In general, PBAs are represented by the formula AxM1[M2(CN)6]y·nH2O, having a face-centred cubic structure with Fm3m space group. The two metal ions (M1 and M2) are linked together by cyanide (CN) ligands with the presence of mobile alkaline metal ions (A).65 PBAs exhibit rapid diffusion of a wide variety of metal ions due to their open-framework structure and large channels.40Fig. 2e illustrates a schematic unit cell structure of an ideal Prussian-blue phase.
PBAs have been tested as cathode materials and they have shown promising results for monovalent ion (Li+, Na+ and K+)-based batteries.6,66–69 They have also been used for multivalent ion batteries such as Mg+, Al+ and Ca+. However, the voltages of these monovalent and multivalent ion batteries are mostly less than 1.5 V which is due to the high overpotential of the corresponding anode materials.70–75 On the other hand, zinc has a lower potential of −0.78 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode, hence the operating voltages of ZIBs are acceptable. With the above mentioned advantages, Zhang and co-workers for the first time demonstrated an aqueous ZIB based on a zinc hexacyanoferrate (Zn3[Fe(CN)6]2, ZnHCF) cathode.74,76 ZnHCF exhibits a rhombohedral structure contrasting with the cubic structure of other metal hexacyanoferrates. In ZnHCF, CN ligands link the ZnN4 tetrahedra and FeC6 octahedra to form a porous three-dimensional framework with large open sites, this framework making ZnHCF an intercalation material for many cations. In general, the electrochemical reactions in PBAs involve intercalation/de-intercalation of Zn2+ in 3D open-framework structures during the cathodic process and deposition/dissolution of zinc in the anodic process (Fig. 8a). The cathodic and anodic reactions during electrochemical cycling can be represented as follows:

With ZnHCF as cathode and Zn as anode, Zhang et al. observed an average operating voltage of 1.7 V, which is the highest among reported ZIBs. The calculated discharge capacities of Zn/ZnSO4/ZnHCF battery were 65.4, 60.4, 56.8, 52.5, 45.5, 39.1 and 32.3 mA h g−1 at 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20C rates, respectively (Fig. 8b). In addition to that, they achieved an energy density of 100 W h kg−1 at a power density of 0.1 kW kg−1 and a power density of 1.7 kW kg−1 at an energy density of 46 W h kg−1.74 Further, the same group studied the electrochemical performance of different morphologies of ZnHCF by tuning the dropping time of solutions in a chemical co-precipitation method.75 As seen in Fig. 8c–e, electrochemical performances of ZnHCF strongly depends on the morphologies: at 60 mA g−1 cuboctahedron, truncated and octahedron ZnHCF delivered similar discharge capacities of 69.1, 67.3 and 66.0 mA h g−1, respectively. However, at higher rates, capacities diminished drastically. From the observed evidence, they reported that cuboctahedron ZnHCF is the most suitable for ZIBs, which is further supported by the measured high energy density of 104 W h kg−1 with an average operating voltage of 1.73 V.
Trocoli and Mantia proposed a safe and environmentally friendly ZIB based on a copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) cathode.76 In contrast to the single oxidation and reduction potential peak for the intercalation of monovalent cations, they observed two reversible peaks for the intercalation of the divalent zinc ion in the CuHCF structure. It is mentioned that higher electrostatic repulsion originating from the intercalation of a divalent cation is the cause of the splitting of the intercalation potential peak into two. Further, at pH 6 the electrochemical reaction at the anode is the dissolution/deposition process; hence the formation of secondary species, such as ZnO and Zn(OH)2, is unlikely. These secondary species can passivate the dissolution of Zn. The capacity retention CuHCF-based ZIB is about 96.3% after 100 cycles with the coulombic efficiency close to 99%. The cell further exhibited an average operating voltage of 1.73 V at a current density of 1C.74 The proposed reaction mechanism for CuHCF/Zn battery is given as follows:
Cathodic reaction: xZn2+ + 2xe− + CuHCF ↔ ZnxCuHCF(9)
Anodic reaction: xZn ↔ xZn2+ + 2xe−(10)
Later, the same group tried to study the reason behind the capacity degradation and also attempted to enhance the cycle life. For this, they analysed the effect of the nature and concentration of the electrolyte, as well as cycling rate, on the performances and ageing of CuHCF.77 For analysing the nature of the anion, 20 mM ZnSO4, Zn(ClO4)2, ZnF2, and Zn(NO3)2 were used as electrolytes. At 1C, after 200 cycles the capacity retention of cells based on ZnSO4, Zn(ClO4)2, ZnF2, and Zn(NO3)2 electrolytes was 97, 95, 95 and 12%, respectively. Since, nitrate ions are strong oxidants, they tend to oxidize the zinc anode and thus degrade the performance of the cell. By analysing the effect of concentration of zinc ions, they found that ZnSO4 is more stable than Zn(ClO4)2 at higher concentration (100 mM). They further reported that increasing the concentration of electrolyte leads to a negative effect on the stability of CuHCF. Furthermore, they observed the phase transition of CuHCF, which strongly depends on the current rate. At 1C, phase transition is observed after the 200th cycle; however, at 5C and 10C they observed this phenomenon after the 600th and 800th cycles, respectively. The proposed mechanism behind this phenomenon is that zinc ions from the solution could fill the vacancies in the crystal lattice of CuHCF upon intercalation of zinc. After reaching the critical amount of zinc in the lattice, the material separates into CuHCF and ZnHCF.77
In PBA crystals, the number of sites occupied by the intercalating species will depend on the number of Fe2+ ions available for oxidation as per the primary storage mechanism. So, the capacity of the cell is limited by the number of Fe2+ ions in the crystal structure. Therefore, the capacity of MeHCF batteries is insensitive to the ionic valency of the intercalating species.78 Gupta et al. reported that the capacity fade of MeHCF in ZIBs could be due to two major factors. Firstly, cyclability of Zn2+ ions in PBAs is not as reversible as that of other explored ions like Na+ and K+, since chemical stability of PBAs is highly sensitive to the intercalating ion. Secondly, passivation of Zn and the formation of Zn dendrites lead to a slow degradation in capacity.79 To address these two issues, they designed a battery framework based on a CuHCF cathode and a hyper-dendritic zinc anode instead of a conventional zinc plate. Also, they used Na+ ions as the intercalation species by adopting an acidic Na2SO4 electrolyte instead of Zn2+. By this, they achieved a cycle number of more than 500 and this enhanced cycle life is attributed to the high surface area and fast insertion kinetics of the hyper-dendritic zinc anode. Nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) was tried as a cathode material for ZIBs by Chae and co-workers using an organic electrolyte.40 Though the use of an organic electrolyte brought stability and the battery exhibited a coulombic efficiency of 99.9%, the capacity of the battery degraded rapidly as the current rate increased. At 1C (56 mA g−1), the capacity was 55.6 mA h g−1; however, for 2C and 4C the value slumped to 26.8 and 8 mA h g−1, respectively.
Even though PBAs as cathodes for ZIBs exhibit remarkable rate and cycling performances, their capacity remains on the low side which needs to be improved further. Designing composite materials and modifying the surface chemistry could be applied since the operating voltages of PBAs are the best among the ZIB cathode materials used so far.
3.3 Vanadium-based materials
Albeit that there are many works available on manganese oxide- and PBA-based cathodes, their poor cycling performance and limited capacity hinders their practical use. To overcome these limitations, Kundu et al. reported Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O as a high-capacity and long-cycling cathode for ZIBs.80 Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O is a vanadium bronze material with a layered structure and contains crystal water. They developed a microwave approach to synthesize Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O nanobelts, as this method provides rapid synthesis and high yield with better purity.81Fig. 9a shows a scheme of a typical cell based on Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O cathode and zinc anode. Once immersed in aqueous electrolyte the V2O5 layers will expand due to the presence of water molecules; further, upon discharge, zinc ions from the anode intercalate into the layers which makes the water molecules expel from the V2O5 layers. However, while charging this process gets reversed. Intercalation and de-intercalation mechanism of Zn2+ in Zn0.25V2O5 crystal is illustrated in Fig. 9b, which also portrays the de-intercalation of water molecules upon Zn2+ intercalation during the electrochemical discharge process. Electrochemical performance of Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O nanobelts is analysed at a current density of 300 mA g−1 in a 0.5–1.4 V potential window, which exhibited a discharge capacity of 282 mA h g−1. Even at a current rate of 15C and 20C (1C = 300 mA g−1), they achieved a high capacity of 223 and 183 mA h g−1, respectively. Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O nanobelts retained specific capacity close to the initial value after multiple cycles at different current densities. A remarkable capacity retention of 81% was achieved at a current density of 8C. This standout performance of the cell is attributed to the presence of water molecules in the crystal structure as they play a crucial role in the expansion and contraction of layers upon insertion and extraction of zinc ions.80

For improving multivalent ion intercalation in oxides, strategies including nanosizing and incorporation of water or solvent molecules into host crystalline structures have been useful so far.82,83 In line with this, Senguttuvan et al. developed a ZIB by using a hydrated vanadium oxide cathode. They reported that the water molecules within the oxide lattice layers act as coordinating and stabilizing molecules which help fast Zn2+ ion diffusion.84 In a subsequent study, Yan et al. investigated the importance of crystal water in V2O5·nH2O. Unlike Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O, V2O5·nH2O does not possess any pillars; instead the presence of V–O sheet layers acts as a lubricant which favours Zn2+ diffusion. On removing the crystal water from the layers of V2O5·nH2O, electrochemical performance suffered a drastic decrease compared to the water-containing V2O5.85 Further, upon Zn2+ intercalation the interlayer distance increases from 10.4 to 13.5 Å (Fig. 9c), which is at odds with the previously reported lattice contraction phenomenon.80 This increase in the interlayer distance was ascribed to the presence of structural water and also the insertion of zinc ions. Water shielding effect in VOG reduces the effective charge of Zn2+ and lowers the electrostatic bond strength, which results in a high diffusion coefficient and high power density.85 In order to analyse the effect of structural water on the electrochemical performance, they also compared a sample heat-treated at 350 °C in vacuum. The prepared VOG electrode was tested in a potential range of 0.2–1.6 V at a current density ranging from 0.3 (372 mA h g−1) to 15 A g−1 (319 mA h g−1). A discharge capacity of 248 mA h g−1 was achieved even at a high rate of 30 A g−1. Fig. 9d shows the rate performances of VOG and VOG sample without structural water at various current densities. VOG sample retained a mean capacity of 369 mA h g−1 after 80 cycles at different current densities. This reflects the excellent stability of the crystal structure and reversibility of redox reactions. By realizing the advantages such as open-framework crystal structure, tendency to exist in multiple oxidation states and charge shield effect of H2O in hydrated V2O5, Xia et al. proposed a double-layered calcium vanadium oxide bronze (Fig. 10a) as a positive electrode in ZIBs.86 By comparing Ca0.25V2O5·nH2O (CVO) with Zn0.25V2O5nH2O, they stated the following advantages of CVO: (1) the larger CaO7 polyhedra in CVO may expand the size of the cavity between V4O10 layers more than the ZnO6 octahedra pillars in Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O; (2) the lower molecular weight and density of CVO probably can give higher gravimetric and volumetric capacity; (3) CVO offers four-fold higher electrical conductivity than Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O. As shown in Fig. 10b, the rate performance of CVO was analysed between 0.2 and 80C. At 0.2C, a capacity of 340 mA h g−1 was achieved; even at a high current density of 80C, the CVO electrode delivered a capacity of 72 mA h g−1. When the cycle is reversed to 0.2C again, it recovered 95% of initial capacity (323 mA h g−1). Moreover, the cell delivered a remarkable energy density of 267 W h kg−1 at a power density of 53.4 W kg−1.86 Recently, Liu and co-workers proposed CaV6O16·3H2O, a type of vanadium bronze, as a capable cathode for ZIBs.87 Due to the large interlayer distance and pillaring effect of calcium, 4.5 equivalents of Zn2+ was reversibly intercalated into one mole of CaV6O16·3H2O. Typical structure of CaV6O16·3H2O contains calcium cations situated between the vanadium layers and supported by the oxygen atoms of water molecules (Fig. 10c). With its large interlayer spacing, CaV6O16·3H2O exhibited an initial discharge capacity of 367 mA h g−1. Ex situ XRD was used to investigate the charge storage mechanism (Fig. 10d). After Zn2+ intercalation, the interlayer distance decreased from the initial value of 7.4 Å to 6.8 Å which was evidenced by the shifting of the (002) peak to higher angle. This shifting of the peak is attributed to the attraction of intercalated Zn2+ cations with the adjacent negatively charged V–O slabs. However, during de-intercalation, the peak is reversed to lower angle and it was very close to the original value. This divulges the exceptional reversibility of Zn2+ (de-)intercalation in the layered structure of CaV6O16·3H2O.87

Like many other layered vanadium oxides, vanadium oxide hydrate (H2V3O8 or V3O7·H2O) has many reports for its use in LIBs; however, it was He et al. who firstly explored the possibility of Zn-ion storage.88 The crystal structure of H2V3O8 is made of V3O8 layers linked by hydrogen bonds with each layer consisting of VO6 octahedra and VO5 trigonal bipyramids. SEM (Fig. 11a) and TEM (Fig. 11b) images reveal highly uniform nanowires with their width ranging between 80 and 120 nm. At 0.1 A g−1 current density, it delivered an initial discharge capacity of 423 mA h g−1 and reduced to 258 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles. The observed capacity of 423 mA h g−1 is the highest among vanadium oxide-based cathodes. This remarkable improvement is attributed to the use of Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte as the CF3SO3 anions reduce the solvation effect and thereby enhancing the specific capacity. Results of rate performance tests (Fig. 11c) indicate a decrease of capacity from 410.3 to 113.9 mA h g−1 when the densities are increased from 0.1 to 5; when the rate is switched back to 0.1 A g−1 it returns to 333.7 mA h g−1 (81% retention). Further, while subjecting the cell to continuous cycling at a high rate of 5 A g−1, after an initial discharge capacity of 173.6 mA h g−1 it decreased in the next few cycles. However, it regained after 20 cycles and maintained around 140 mA h g−1 over 1000 cycles. It has been reported that the capacity decay in the initial 20 cycles is due to the gradual penetration of electrolyte into the interlayer space of V3O8 layers.18,88

To achieve high battery performance, factors such as morphology, structural stability and ionic conductivity of the electrode materials are of paramount importance. In line with this, many works have been done on combining active materials with highly conductive additives (carbon, graphene etc.). Pang et al. synthesized H2V3O8 nanowires embedded in graphene sheets via a hydrothermal method.89 SEM (Fig. 11d) and TEM (Fig. 11e) images of the prepared material reveal the nanowire morphology spread over the graphene sheets with a thickness of around 50 nm. Battery performances were evaluated between 0.2 and 1.6 V potential using 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 aqueous electrolyte and zinc metal foil as anode. At 100 mA g−1 current density, the cell delivered an initial capacity of 386 mA h g−1. Further, when the current rate increased to 5C, the cell delivered 240 mA h g; even at 10C it could give a capacity of 215 mA h g−1. However, the pure H2V3O8 nanowires delivered only 230 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 58.4 mA h g−1 at 5C. Fig. 11f shows the long-term cycling stability test at a very high current rate (20C) of the cell. The capacity gradually increased from ∼200 to 270 mA h g−1, which was maintained for about 400 cycles. Later, the capacity slowly reduced to 240 mA h g−1 from the 1030th to the 2000th cycle representing a high capacity retention of 87%. This shows the effect of graphene sheets on the electrochemical performances of H2V3O8 and the enhanced performance is attributed to the high specific surface area of graphene sheets. They further utilized ex situ XRD analysis to study the structural evolution of H2V3O8/graphene electrode during charge/discharge cycles. When discharged at 0.5 and 0.2 V, a peak at 6.6° corresponds to a large interlayer distance of 1.34 nm. Hence, at lower voltage, intercalation of zinc ions triggers the insertion of water molecules, whereas the larger interlayer distance improves the ion diffusion kinetics. Further, they postulated that the charging process was the reverse of discharging, with the fully charged electrode showing the same phase as that of the pristine electrode.89
Another promising positive electrode from the vanadium family is NaV3O8, which is composed of V3O8 layers and sodium ions with an interlayer spacing of 0.704 nm. To exploit the advantages of NaV3O8, Wan et al. synthesized NaV3O8 (NVO) nanobelts via a liquid–solid stirring strategy.36 When performing electrochemical testing with 1 M ZnSO4 electrolyte at a current density of 0.05 A g−1 the cell delivered 380 mA h g−1, but the capacity faded quickly to 33 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1 current density. This severe capacity fading is ascribed to the dissolution of NVO and the formation of Zn dendrites. To overcome these issues, they added 1 M Na2SO4 to the 1 M ZnSO4 electrolyte, since addition of Na+ ions will alter the dissolution equilibrium and block the dissolution of NVO (Fig. 12a). Furthermore, the addition of Na+ effectively reduced the formation of Zn dendrites due to the lower reduction potential of Na+.36 According to the electrostatic shield mechanism, addition of positive ions with lower reduction potential in the electrolyte would avoid dendrite formation during the charging process.90 The electrochemical performance of the Zn/NVO system with Na2SO4 in the electrolyte showed a stable capacity of 221 mA h g−1 (90% retention) at 1 A g−1 current density compared to 84 mA h g−1 for the system without Na2SO4. It also displayed impressive power (3600 W kg−1) and energy densities (300 W h kg−1) compared to other ZIBs. As shown in Fig. 12b, the obtained results of energy density and power density of NVO are greater than all the previously reported values of other cathode materials. They also demonstrated the viability of a quasi-solid-state Zn/NVO battery as a flexible energy storage device. Zinc pyrovanadate (Zn3V2O7(OH)2·2H2O) nanowires with a porous crystal framework have also been tested as cathode for ZIBs. Even though it showed a promising initial discharge capacity of 213 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1 it swiftly reduced to 76 mA h g−1 at 3000 mA g−1.39

Apart from the hydrated vanadium oxides and vanadium bronzes, some works based on vanadium oxide and vanadium pentoxides as cathodes have been reported. Zhang et al. reported V2O5 as cathode for ZIBs, prepared by ball-milling with 20 wt% graphite powder.91Fig. 12c shows a scheme of the Zn–V2O5 battery chemistry. They opted for 3 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 aqueous electrolyte rather than diluted 1 M Zn(CF3SO3)2 electrolyte, as higher concentrations of electrolytes effectively reduce the water-induced side reactions.92,93 The cell exhibited a high reversible capacity of 470 mA h g−1 at 0.2 A g−1 (Fig. 12d), a high energy density of 274 W h kg−1 at 7100 W kg−1, and also displayed a long-term cycling stability with 91.1% capacity retention after 4000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Further, they also demonstrated the intense working conditions of the battery by testing it under low (−10 °C) and high (50 °C) temperatures.91 Similarly, Zhou et al. prepared a V2O5 cathode and tested its performance in a ZIB with different electrolytes (ZnSO4, ZnCl2, Zn(CH3COO)2, and Zn(NO3)2). Their results showed that 3 M ZnSO4 electrolyte provides good performance and cycle life compared to the other electrolytes.94 Recently, Niu and co-workers reported a freestanding rGO/VO2 composite film as a high-performance cathode material for ZIBs. This composite film helps in the transportation of electrons/ions and also in accommodating the volumetric expansion during the intercalation/de-intercalation process. As a result, the rGO/VO2 composite film delivered an energy density of 65 W h kg−1 at a high power density of 7.8 kW kg−1. Also, it retained 99% of initial capacity even after 1000 cycles at 4 A g−1.95
Interestingly, Clites et al. recently reported that chemical pre-intercalation of ions such as Li+, Na+, K+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ increases the interlayer distance in V2O5. This increased interlayer spacing is directly proportional to the radii of hydrated ions. Among them, Mg2+ has shown larger interlayer spacing of 13.40 Å.96 By understanding the advantage of this approach, Alshareef et al. developed a layered Mg2+ intercalated V2O5(Mg0.34V2O5·nH2O) cathode material for ZIBs.97 The crystal structure of Mg0.34V2O5·nH2O is similar to that of Zn0.25V2O5·nH2O and Ca0.25V2O5·nH2O, and both these materials are proven performers in ZIBs. Hence, Mg0.34V2O5·nH2O is also expected as a promising cathode material. MgxV2O5·nH2O further when explored as cathode for ZIBs delivered an initial discharge capacity of 353 and 264 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 1 A g−1, respectively. After the first cycle almost all the Mg2+ ions were de-intercalated and replaced by Zn2+ ions which results in the formation of Zn0.34MgxV2O5. Fig. 13a shows the ex situ XRD patterns of Zn0.34MgxV2O5 and the corresponding voltage profiles at 200 mA g−1. Here, only a minor contraction of interlayer spacing was noticed, which was owing to the solvation effect of intercalated hydrated Zn2+. Further, after the charging process, the XRD peaks almost retain their original positions, which demonstrates the reversibility of Zn0.34MgxV2O5. They further proposed that intercalated Zn2+ with water could be a complex material, which is evidenced from the interlayer spacing of parent V2O5·0.5H2O (∼8.75 Å) and Zn0.34MgxV2O5 (∼13.2 Å). The proposed storage mechanism is illustrated in Fig. 13b. A similar strategy was also employed by Liang et al. However, they used Li+ as pre-intercalation material to enlarge the interlayer spacing of V2O5 layers.98 This approach of structural engineering by pre-intercalation could be carried over to other functional materials to improve the performances of ZIBs.

Very recently, Wang et al. proposed a novel hydrated V6O13·nH2O as a high-performance aqueous ZIB cathode material.99 As seen in Fig. 14a, the interlayer was expanded via intercalation of water molecules. Along with this, the unique dandelion-like hollow architecture of the V6O13·nH2O cathode delivered abundantly accessible channels for fast kinetics of Zn2+, short transportation path for Zn2+ migration, and thereby enhanced the swift transfer of electrons. As illustrated in Fig. 14b, ex situ XRD analysis was performed to study the reaction mechanism of the Zn/V6O13·nH2O system. During first discharge cycle (0.2 V) at 0.2 A g−1 current density, the characteristic peak of (001) plane (at 7.8°) with an interlayer spacing of 1.13 nm is reduced to a lower angle at 6.6° with an increased interlayer expansion of 1.33 nm. This expansion of interlamellar spacing is ascribed to the insertion of Zn2+ shielded by water molecules with reduced effective charge into the interlayers. Benefiting from this water shielding layer, Zn2+ exhibits an electrostatic shielding effect, which eventually lowers the activation energy, effectively facilitating the fast Zn2+ diffusion into the host structure. The corresponding electrochemical reaction mechanism of the Zn/V6O13·nH2O system is illustrated as follows:

Anodic reaction: Zn ↔ Zn2+ + 2e−(13)
Due to the abundant transportation channels and short diffusion pathways, the V6O13·nH2O cathode delivers a high specific capacity of 395 mA h g−1 at 0.1 A g−1 and outstanding cycling performance with a high capacity retention of 87% up to 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1.99
Vanadium disulfide (VS2), a member of the transition metal dichalcogenides, was tried as a positive electrode in ZIBs by He et al.100 The crystal structure of VS2 is similar to that of the graphite lamellar structure with an interlayer spacing of 5.76 Å; hence, insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions (0.74 Å) should be favourable. In situ Raman spectra of VS2 (Fig. 14c) at different applied potential reveal noticeable changes in important peaks positioned at 140.4, 282.0, 406.6, 687.8 and 993.2 cm−1 during the charge/discharge processes. When discharging from 1.0 to 0.4 V, the above mentioned bands become weaker and broader, which corresponds to the intercalation of cations between the VS2 layers. Whereas, peak intensity steadily reinforces to the original state during the charging process (0.4 to 1.0 V), which is attributed to the extraction of Zn2+ from the VS2 layers. Intercalation of Zn2+ in VS2 layers can be divided into two steps during the discharge process. Firstly, VS2 experiences a phase transition to Zn0.09VS2 (0.08–0.65 V range) which is followed by another phase transition to Zn0.23VS2 (0.64–0.45 V range). The electrochemical reaction equations in Zn/VS2 can be presented as follows:
Cathodic reaction: VS2 + 0.009Zn2+ + 0.18e− ↔ Zn0.09VS2(14) Zn0.09VS2 + 0.14Zn2+ + 0.28e− ↔ Zn0.23VS2(15)
Anodic reaction: Zn2+ + 2e− ↔ Zn(16)

Fig. 14d shows the operation mechanism of a Zn/VS2 battery system. Electrochemical performances of VS2 in the potential range 0.4–1.0 V give an initial discharge capacity of 190.3 mA h g−1 at 0.05 A g−1 current density. When the current density is increased to 2 A g−1 the capacity was 115.5 mA h g−1. At 0.5 A g−1 current density, the capacity was stabilized at 110.9 mA h g−1 after 200 cycles, whereas the initial discharge capacity was 112.3 mA h g−1 which converts to 98% capacity retention.100 Promising results for VS2 led to interest in exploring transition metal dichalcogenides as cathodes for ZIBs.
Apart from vanadium oxides and metal vanadates, vanadium-based NASICONs (sodium (Na) super (S) ionic (I) conductor (CON) compounds) were also briefly investigated as potential cathode materials for ZIBs. NASICONs are a class of structurally isomorphous 3D compounds with high conductivity comparable to those of liquid electrolytes at elevated temperature. NASICON compounds generally have the formula AxMM′(XO4)3 (A = Li, Na, Mg, etc.; M, M′ = Ti, V, Cr, Fe, etc.; X = P, Si, S, etc.). These polyanionic cathode materials possess a highly stable framework which boosts the cycle life and the excess vacancies in the structure help to store metal ions. With the presence of an inducing effect, the redox voltage for NASICON compounds is generally higher than that of the binary oxide analogues.101 Li and co-workers were the first to report the possibility of using vanadium-based NASICONs as intercalation hosts for Zn ions.26 For that, they prepared Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) wrapped by graphene like carbon as cathode for ZIBs and used Zn(CH3COOH)2 as electrolyte. It is known that in an NVO plane, Na sites will be located at 6b and 18e sites with different coordination environment. However, Na+ ion could be extracted only from 18e site leading to the formation of desodiated NaV2(PO4)3 phase, which provides large open sites that can accommodate other Na ions.102,103 Cycling performance of the cell tested in the 0.7–1.8 V potential window at 0.5C (here, 1C = 100 mA g−1) revealed a capacity of 97 mA h g−1. Further, a 74% capacity retention was observed after 100 cycles. Capacity loss in the initial few cycles is ascribed to the lattice distortion during the insertion process, which recovers after structural variation. To investigate the intercalation mechanism, XRD and XPS analyses were used. XRD pattern of pristine electrode is indexed to NASICON-structured NVP. Fig. 15a shows the ex situ XRD patterns of Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode for ZIB during charge/discharge for a voltage of 0.8–1.7 V and Fig. 15b shows the corresponding voltage–time curve. After the completion of the charging process at 1.7 V, several new peaks were observed and indexed to desodiated NaV2(PO4)3 phase. During the discharge process, a new Zn-ion-inserted ZnxNaV2(PO4)3 phase was observed, which confirms the intercalation of zinc ions, which is further supported by the XPS analysis. While charging, the initial V3+ oxidation state moves to V4+ and moves back to V3+ upon discharging. Also, peaks related Zn are also detected which confirms the intercalation mechanism.26Fig. 15c depicts a scheme of the insertion/extraction process during cycling. Though the results are not satisfactory, this work paves the way for a new dimension in exploring ZIB cathodes.

Very recently, Li et al. proposed a new Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode material for ZIBs, which is coupled with a carbon film-functionalized zinc anode. Na3V2(PO4)2F3 has a more stable structure than Na3V2(PO4)3 due to the strong affinity of its F atoms with the surroundings.104 At 0.2 A g−1, an initial discharge capacity of 64.7 mA h g−1 was achieved in a potential range of 0.8–1.9 V. Long-term cycling performance was tested at 0.2 A g−1 with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathode and carbon film-functionalized zinc anode (Fig. 15d). It shows an initial capacity of 61.7 mA h g−1 and maintains a stable capacity of 63.8 mA h g−1 after 600 cycles. For comparison, pure Zn anode (Fig. 15e) was also tested, which performed poorly and lasted for only 177 cycles. The rapid capacity degradation is attributed to a dendrite-induced short circuit. On the other hand, the carbon film-functionalized zinc anode performed well even at a high current density of 1 A g−1 with a capacity of 46 mA h g−1 after an impressive 4000 cycles.104 This strategy of using a modified anode made a strong point for designing new ZIBs.
3.4 Chevrel phase compounds
Due to their unique open crystal structure and rigid framework, Chevrel phase Mo6S8 compounds have been used as an electrode material for many battery systems.105–108 In general, Chevrel phase Mo6S8 is made up of six Mo atoms leading to the formation of octahedral Mo6 along with a cubic unit of sulfur atoms. A neighboring cluster will be axially bonded by six of the eight sulfur atoms which results in a 3D framework. Cheng et al. were among the first to investigate Mo6S8 as a positive electrode in both aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. They proved that Zn2+ can be intercalated both in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes on a Mo6S8 cathode. Cyclic voltammetry curves showed two sets of redox peaks with anodic peaks at 0.68 and 0.37 V and cathodic peaks at 0.50 and 0.34 V. While comparing the first two cycles, the second pair positioned at higher voltages exhibits some irreversible capacities. This is ascribed to cation trapping in the Mo6S8 structure which results in the formation of Zn2Mo6S8. Ex situ XRD confirmed that the discharged product was Zn2Mo6S8.109 Later, Hong et al. also observed two sets of redox peaks for electrochemically Zn2+ inserted Mo6S8. The peaks at higher voltage represent the formation of ZnMo6S8. This ZnMo6S8 is then transformed into Zn2Mo6S8 which is represented by the peaks at lower voltage.110 Though some good works have been carried out with Chevrel-based ZIB cathodes, their low capacity and inferior rate performances limit their practical applications. Designing and modification of surfaces could be a viable option to enhance the properties of these materials.
3.5 Organic and other cathodes for ZIBs
In addition to inorganic materials, organic materials have also been tested as cathodes in various battery systems in the past couple of years.111–114 Among them quinone-based electrodes were investigated as aqueous ZIB cathodes recently since they are stable in water. Energy storage mechanism of quinone compounds is generally based on an “ion-coordination” mechanism in which positively charged cations coordinate with negatively charged oxygen atoms which is accompanied by the simultaneous reduction of carbonyl groups.115 Chen et al. reported a high-performance calix[4]quinone cathode for Zn2+ storage. Calix[4]quinone has an open bowl structure along with eight carbonyls which is expected to deliver efficient reversible storage in ZIBs. Calix[4]quinone revealed a high capacity of 335 mA h g−1 and a long cycle life of 1000 cycles along with a capacity retention of 87% (at 500 mA g−1). A flat and safe operation voltage of 1.0 V leads to an outstanding energy efficiency of 93% at low current density.116 Though quinones are emerging as cathodes in ZIBs, their capacity is very low and are still in their primary stage, hence more works are needed to understand the capacity of these materials in depth.
Very recently, Kundu et al. proposed a novel organic cathode named as 1,4-bis(diphenylamino)benzene (BDB) for a dual-ion aqueous ZIB.117 Unlike quinones, anion insertion systems use anion uptake to compensate the electron loss during oxidation. Incorporation of reversible anion has the advantage of improving the slow solid-state kinetics associated with zinc-ion insertion for cathodes and also delivers relatively high-voltage systems.115 As seen in Fig. 16a, if the anions from the electrolyte reversibly move in/out to balance the charge, then the two tertiary nitrogen centres of BDB stepwise oxidize/reduce during charge–discharge. In contrast, at lower potentials, the oxidized BDB was found to catalyse the water oxidation, which is prevented by employing a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte. Operation of the Zn/BDB system is based on the reversible oxidation/reduction of BDB/BDB2+, while electrolyte anions insert/de-insert to maintain the charge neutrality. Here, it is important to note that the lack of free water molecules in the electrolyte due to the higher concentration reduces the electrochemical activity of water thereby forcing the anodic and cathodic stability limit to a wide operational window (Fig. 16b).118 This system delivers a reversible capacity of 120–125 mA h g−1 and an energy density (cathode only) of ∼155 W h kg−1. The authors also mentioned that by using a highly concentrated aqueous electrolyte the stability can be improved at high potentials. Further, to prevent active material dissolution during cell cycling a CNC membrane was used which resulted in long-term cyclability with 82% retention after 500 cycles and 75% after 1000 cycles.117 With its high energy density and cycling stability, BDB gives a new and promising direction for researchers.

Apart from the above discussed materials, there are some other materials which have been tested as cathodes for ZIBs. Very recently, Zeng et al. proposed an oxygen-vacancy and surface phosphate-ion modulation approach with nickel cobaltite (P-NiCo2O4−x) nanosheets.119 This approach has led to an increased capacity and high rate. Introduced oxygen vacancies act as active sites in electrochemical reactions and also boost the electrical conductivity of the oxide material. On the other hand, the presence of phosphate ions improves the surface reactivity and reaction kinetics. Oxygen defects were analysed through XPS analysis. Fig. 16c shows the O 1s core-level XPS spectra of the pristine NiCo2O4 and P-NiCo2O4−x samples. The peaks at 531.2 and 532.5 eV are attributed to the oxygen defect sites and O–H from surface-absorbed water.120,121 After phosphating surface treatment, compared to pristine NiCo2O4, P-NiCo2O4−x attains an improvement in peaks, related to oxygen vacancy sites (531.2 eV) demonstrating the increased concentration of oxygen defect sites. In the interim, increased oxygen vacancies and weakened M–O bonds lead to the lower intensity of the M–O peak in the spectrum of the P-NiCo2O4−x sample.122 As a result of this, P-NiCo2O4−x exhibited a high capacity of 361.3 mA h g−1 at a current density of 3 A g−1 compared to 35.8 mA h g−1 of pure NiCo2O4 (Fig. 16d). Even at an ultrahigh current density of 25.3 A g−1, Zn//P-NiCo2O4−x was able to retain a capacity of 96.4 mA h g−1 after an impressive 5000 cycles which reflects its high durability.119 A similar strategy was employed by Wang et al. to investigate defect-engineered MoS2−x nanosheets as a ZIB cathode. The defect-rich MoS2−x nanosheets exhibited outstanding activity for the insertion/extraction of Zn2+ ions compared to MoS2 with high capacity and excellent rate capability.123 Considering the vast improvements in the performance of the battery, this approach could be applied for other metal oxide materials which would be helpful in exploring many other ZIB cathodes.
4. Anodes
Zn metal is considered to be one of the best anode materials due to its impressive properties such as high theoretical capacity (Table 1) and high corrosion resistance in aqueous solutions and also to its being a good reducing agent. With its appropriate redox potential (−0.76 V vs. standard hydrogen electrode) in aqueous electrolytes, low cost and non-toxicity, Zn metal anode is widely preferred among researchers for ZIB applications. However, there are certain age-old limitations which are preventing the implementation of Zn in next-generation batteries. Factors such as dendrite growth, structural changes, passivation and hydrogen evolution are affecting the progress of ZIBs.124 To overcome these issues strategies like adding additives to the electrolyte and constructing hierarchical structures have been proposed lately.125–127 Wang et al. constructed a zinc anode by electrodepositing Zn over a highly conductive graphite felt. The use of graphite felt provides a greater electroactive area thereby hastening the electron transportation and also loads Zn evenly for Zn plating/stripping. This effectively decreased the voltage hysteresis and increased the cycling stability.127 Kang et al. reported a highly stable 3D Zn anode prepared by electrodeposition of Zn on an etched porous copper skeleton. The open structure of the 3D copper skeleton and high electrical conductivity led to even Zn plating/stripping. Further, it showed stable cycling performance, reduced polarization and a coulombic efficiency close to 100%.128 Very recently, Cui et al. proposed a water-in-deep eutectic solvent electrolyte (∼30 mol% H2O in a eutectic mixture of urea/LiTFSI/Zn(TFSI)2), which enables stable and reversible Zn plating/stripping. Even at low rates, this electrolyte exhibited remarkable cycling life compared to other aqueous electrolytes.129 This strategy can be further explored since deep eutectic solvents have a high degree of design freedom. Hence, designing novel hierarchical architectures for Zn anodes and designing electrolytes for even Zn plating/stripping should be the pathway for improving high rate capability and long cycling life.
5. Conclusion and future perspectives
This review is mainly focused on recent developments and challenges of various cathode materials developed for aqueous ZIBs. Though LIBs hold a huge part in the evolution of current-generation mobile and electronic devices, they still have their own drawbacks. Due to the resource scarcity, increasing prices and safety issues, LIBs are making way for the emergence of aqueous multivalent ion (Mg2+, Zn2+, Al3+) batteries. Among these, Zn-ion based energy storage devices in recent years have attracted a lot of interest due to their unique properties. However, the future of ZIBs is hindered by the development of suitable cathodes for intercalation of Zn ions. Many materials based on MnO2 and the PBA family have been tried as cathodes, but then they suffered from either poor cycle life or low specific capacity. Of late, cathodes based on the vanadium family have delivered promising results, but still a lot more theoretical and experimental approaches are desired to get an in-depth understanding of the storage mechanism. Table 2 shows the electrochemical performances of various cathode materials tested so far. By looking from the point of future perspectives and considering the recent progress on ZIBs as presented in this review, the following important facts could be considered.
Despite the rapid progress of ZIBs, the intercalation mechanism of Zn2+ in MnO2 is still one of the important topics of debate among researchers. Three different reaction mechanisms have been repeatedly proposed by various groups. They are (i) Zn2+ insertion/extraction, (ii) co-insertion/extraction of H+/Zn2+ and (iii) chemical conversion reaction. However, the absence of conclusive evidence for these reaction mechanisms in order to standardize the measurements has been a bottleneck for a while. Hence, more reliable theoretical and electrochemical tools are needed along with more advanced characterization techniques to ensure successful Zn2+ intercalation.
Due to the strong polarization effect of Zn ions, many cathode materials suffer from poor cycling stability. Hence, cathode materials with stable crystal structures and flexible channels for Zn-ion diffusion should be preferred. Materials intercalated with crystal water are a viable option to enhance the capacity and rate performance, as the charge shield effect in crystal water could reduce the effective charges of intercalated Zn2+ ions. The intercalating water molecules widen the ionic channel dimensions and facilitate the carrier ion diffusion by reducing unwanted interactions with the channel walls.130 At the same time, they also act as interstitial pillars to stabilize the lattice framework for long-term charge–discharge cycles. On the other hand, defect engineering and surface modification chemistry have been gaining attention due to their potential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of ZIBs through creating a greater number of active sites. As discussed earlier in this review, defect engineering and surface chemistry of existing materials for improving the battery capacity are new pathways in the search for cathodes for ZIBs. Likewise, chemical pre-intercalation of hydrated metal ions into layered materials could be an interesting option for enhancing the performances of cathodes with layered structures. Apart from designing inorganic cathodes with new approaches, there are some organic cathodes which are yet to be explored. By designing and developing the molecular structures intensively, more organic materials with higher capacity and voltage could be established. With the limited number of publications so far, it seems to be a shining light for researchers.
ZnSO4 has been extensively used as an electrolyte for aqueous ZIBs due to its low cost, safety and conductivity. However, it mostly results in loss of capacity due to the dissolution and formation of dendrites at the anode. Formation of dendrites can be overcome by using Zn(CF3SO3) electrolyte but the cost of this leads to an overall increase in the production price of batteries. Development of electrolytes with wide voltage window that could steadily transport zinc cations is desired. Since the voltage window of electrolytes used to date is far from a satisfactory level, this limits the development of cathode materials (Table 1). Operating voltage will decrease further with the higher reduction potential of zinc metal.
Lastly, modification of zinc anodes towards better performance should not be overlooked as it provides the luxury of utilizing the battery more efficiently. Though zinc is considered to be a good anode material due to its low cost, nontoxic nature, high theoretical capacity and negative potential, it suffers from dendritic formation, corrosion and uneven plating/stripping. Hence, modification of Zn metal anodes to porous foams or sponges helps in suppressing the formation of Zn dendrites.
From the industrial point of view, flexible and wearable devices are the next big thing. Recently, flexible aqueous ZIBs have garnered more attention among researchers, since aqueous ZIBs are safer and cheaper compared to organic electrolyte-based LIBs. ZIBs with gel/solid-state electrolyte have shown promising results so far.131,132 More attention to innovative approaches is desired for developing flexible electrodes and electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and mechanical strength. Besides, one cannot rule out the fact that the constant and intensive research on ZIBs might come up with an out-of-the-box cathode material which satisfactorily fulfils the needs. Moreover, with advanced characterization techniques and the development of new theoretical approaches, the future of ZIBs seems to be bright and they could be seen as a potential replacement to the expensive LIBs in the near future.
