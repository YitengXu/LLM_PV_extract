    , Accepted 11th May 2021First published on 11th May 2021AbstractDeveloping polymer solar cells (PSCs) with high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness is one of the most urgent tasks to ensure their operational reliability and applicability in wearable devices. However, it remains challenging to enhance their mechanical properties without compromising the electrical properties of high-performance active materials. Here, we develop a series of novel polymer donors (PDs), with which highly efficient PSCs having remarkable mechanical reliability are demonstrated. By interposing a controlled amount of 1,10-di(thiophen-2-yl)decane flexible spacer (FS) into a PM6 backbone, we are able to significantly enhance the intermixing of the new PDs with a small molecule acceptor (Y7), affording sufficient pathways for efficient charge percolation and mechanical stress dissipation. As a result, PSCs based on the PD containing 5 mol% FS units and Y7 exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 17% with a crack onset strain (COS) of 12% and a cohesive fracture energy (Gc) of 2.1 J m−2, significantly outperforming reference PM6-based devices (PCE = 15%, COS = 2% and Gc = 1.0 J m−2). Both the photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness of these PSCs are among the best values reported to date. The rational design of the PDs demonstrated here presents a highly promising strategy to address the mechanical properties of SMA-based solar cells and their viable application in flexible/stretchable electronics.

Broader context
Achieving sufficient mechanical reliability for highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their potential application in various areas, where mechanical stress presents as a major cause for device failure. However, it is challenging to develop PSCs with both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness, as photoactive materials with planar and rigid backbones used for efficient PSCs result in brittle films with strong segregation. In this study we developed an effective strategy to obtain highly efficient PSCs with remarkable mechanical robustness, by rational design of polymer donors (PDs) with aliphatic flexible spacer (FS) units incorporated into a rigid polymer backbone. PSCs with PCEs of 17% and crack-onset strains (COSs) of 12% were demonstrated, which are among the most efficient and mechanically robust PSCs reported to date.

Introduction
The development of reliable photovoltaic systems to harness sustainable energy resources is important in the face of the energy crisis and environmental issues.1–3 In particular, ensuring both the high efficiency and mechanical robustness of polymer solar cells (PSCs) is an indispensable prerequisite for their operational stability and commercialization as power sources for next-generation wearable and portable devices.3–5 Thanks to the recent development of benzodithiophene (BDT)-based polymer donors (PDs) and Y-series small molecule acceptors (SMAs), the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has been significantly improved to around 17–18%.6–12 However, the mechanical properties of these highly efficient PSCs are not sufficient to enable their practical application in flexible devices. For instance, most state-of-the-art PD–SMA blends suffer from brittle mechanical properties with crack onset strains (COSs) of <5%.13–16 Therefore, there is an urgent need to enhance the mechanical robustness of PSCs while maintaining high PCEs.
To address this issue, the effects of molecular structure on the mechanical properties of PD–SMA-based PSCs need to be carefully examined. To date, the molecular design of PDs for efficient PSCs has mainly followed a general approach of increasing the backbone planarity/rigidity to enhance the molecular interaction and charge transport ability,17–20 which often result in strong phase segregation between PD and SMA domains.21–23 However, the large-size domains and weak donor–acceptor (D–A) interfaces caused by the high rigidity and low miscibility of active materials could also lead to numerous unconnected domains,13,15,16,24 through which cracks are likely to propagate under mechanical stress.13–15,25 Hence, to secure a sufficient amount of intermixed domains and favorable D–A interfaces in blend films, the backbone rigidity of PDs should be carefully modulated.6,26 The intermixed phases here can also serve as percolation pathways between the domains to maintain high charge mobilities, while suppressing the charge recombination of blend films.27,28 Nevertheless, it is challenging to significantly reduce the backbone rigidity of PDs without compromising their electrical properties, as most efficient building blocks still comprise conjugated and fused structures.
Introducing flexible spacer (FS) units (i.e., non-conjugated aliphatic chains) into a rigid PD skeleton has been shown as an effective strategy for alleviating the PD chain rigidity. Recently, various FS units have been employed to break polymer conjugation29–31 and enhance the chain flexibility or mechanical ductility in the field of organic electronics (i.e., organic field-effect transistors (OFETs)).32–35 For example, the Bao group inserted 2,6-pyridine dicarboxamide and alkyl segments into diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based polymers for use in OFETs with enhanced mechanical ductility, while retaining their electrical properties.35,36 In addition, Thompson and Lipomi groups controlled the lengths and contents of FS units in DPP-based polymers and demonstrated their relationships with mechanical/electrical properties.33,34 However, the effects of FS units have been studied for films based on pristine polymers and little has been explored for blends, such as bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) blends. The mechanical and electrical properties of the blends are affected by morphological features, as well as material characteristics, owing to the presence of both intermixed and phase-separated domains of donor and acceptor materials.37,38 Therefore, a systematic study is needed to elucidate the effects of FS units in PD materials on both their electrical and mechanical properties, as well as their morphological behaviors in blends with acceptor materials.
In this work, we develop a series of PDs (PM6-CX, where X denotes the FS content = 5, 10, 20 and 30 mol%) by introducing 1,10-di(thiophen-2-yl)decane FS units into a poly[(2,6-(4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl-3-fluoro)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene))-alt-(5,5-(1′,3′-di-2-thienyl-5′,7′-bis(2-ethylhexyl)benzo[1′,2′-c:4′,5′-c′]dithiophene-4,8-dione))] (PM6) backbone, with which both high photovoltaic performance and mechanical ductility are demonstrated. Particularly, PCEs of ∼17% are achieved for PSCs based on PM6-C5 and PM6-C10, in which small amounts (5 and 10 mol%) of rigid benzodithiophenedione (BDD) units are replaced with the FS units, exceeding those of reference PM6:2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-dichloro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y7) blends (PCE = 15%). Meanwhile, mechanical robustness is dramatically increased with a COS of 12%, a toughness of 3.67 MJ m−3, and a cohesive fracture energy (Gc) of 2.1 J m−2 realized in the PM6-C5:Y7 blend, which are 6-, 14- and 2-fold higher than those of the PM6:Y7 blend, respectively. Detailed characterization studies are performed to reveal how the structures of these new PDs affect the morphological, electrical and mechanical properties of PD–SMA blends. It is found that improved intermixing between the PD and SMA in the blends is achieved upon the introduction of appropriate amounts of FS units, affording sufficient charge percolation and mechanical stress dissipation pathways. The best-performing blends containing PM6-C5 or PM6-C10 clearly exhibit suppressed growth of crystallites with lower domain purities as compared to the other blends, which are supported by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements.
Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization of PM6-CX
The chemical structures of the PDs and SMA used in this study are shown in Fig. 1. We selected PM6-C0 (PM6), which offers fast charge transport and high light absorption, as the reference PD.39,40 A long FS building block was introduced as a third component to systematically decrease the backbone rigidity of PM6 and optimize the blend morphology with SMA. A long decyl aliphatic chain was chosen to provide sufficient flexibility to the PDs, while not compromising the interchain interactions and electrical properties of the PD.41–43 A series of PDs were copolymerized by Stille coupling reactions,44 by varying the molar ratios of the BDD to FS units, while fixing the content of BDT. The resulting terpolymers were named PM6-CX (X = 0, 5, 10, 20 and 30), where X denotes the mole percents of FS units to the total (FS + BDD) units. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of the PDs, depending on the FS unit content, are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†). The molecular weights of the PDs were analyzed by high-temperature size-exclusion chromatography using 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene at 140 °C to prevent excessive pre-aggregation of the polymers during the measurement. All the PDs have number-average molecular weights (Mns) within a similar range (27–31 kg mol−1), minimizing the effects of molecular weight on their material properties (Table 1).45 The molecular, optical and electrical characteristics of the series of PM6-CX PDs were investigated (Table 1). The cyclic voltammograms and ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra in film states are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). The PM6-C20 and PM6-C30 PDs exhibit slightly blue-shifted absorption with reduced 0–0 transition peaks in the film state. These transitions are associated with the weaker aggregation of PDs resulting from the irregular backbone sequence with excessive FS units.46,47

To further investigate the effect of FS units on the aggregation properties of the PDs, temperature-dependent UV-vis absorption spectra of the PDs in chlorobenzene solution were monitored (Fig. 1b and Fig. S3, ESI†). The temperature-dependent aggregation (TDA) properties of PDs are considered crucial in controlling the blend morphology and achieving high photovoltaic performance, as the aggregated structures in solution highly impact the blend morphology in the film after solution processing.48–50 The PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 PDs with small amounts of FS units showed TDA behaviors very similar to PM6. They showed almost the same maximum absorption wavelength (λmax) values as PM6, and their 0–0 transition peaks were more prominent than the 0–1 transition peaks, even at elevated temperatures (Fig. 1b). Additionally, the hole mobilities (μhs), measured using a space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method, for PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 were comparable to that of PM6 (Table 1).51 These results suggest that the appropriate interposition of the FS block did not compromise the aggregation and charge transport properties of the PM6-CX PDs (Fig. 1c).48,49 However, PM6-C20 and PM6-C30 showed significantly reduced 0–0 transition peaks and TDA properties in the solution UV-vis absorption spectra. Additionally, the λmax values of the absorption peaks were more blue-shifted compared with those of PM6. Consistently, the μhs of the PM6-C20 and PM6-C30 PDs were lower than that of PM6 (Table 1). These results are mainly attributed to the presence of excessive FS units, which decrease the effective conjugation length and disturb the intrachain charge transfer in PM6-C20 and PM6-C30 (Fig. 1c).32,33,52,53
Photovoltaic properties
Next, we investigated the photovoltaic properties depending on the PDs by fabricating PSC devices with a normal-type device architecture. The J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are presented in Fig. 2a and Table 2, respectively. The PM6:Y7-based PSC showed a high PCE of 15.1% with high Jsc (25.4 mA cm−2) and FF (0.69) values. Interestingly, the PCEs of the PM6-C5-and PM6-C10-based PSCs significantly increased to 16.7% and 17.0%, respectively. The main parameters that contributed to the increase in PCEs were Jsc and FF. For example, both the Jsc and FF values (Jsc = 25.4 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.69) of the PM6:Y7 blend increased to Jsc = 26.8 mA cm−2 and FF = 0.74 for the PM6-C10:Y7 blend. However, the PCEs of the PM6-C20- and PM6-C30-based PSCs with PDs having excessive FS contents decreased to 14.9% and 13.8%, respectively. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) response spectra are shown in Fig. 2b. The calculated Jsc values agreed well with the ones obtained from the J–V curves within a 4% error range (Table 2). Compared with those of the other blends, the PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 blends showed higher EQE responses in the absorption ranges of both the PDs (400–600 nm) and Y7 (700–900 nm). However, the PM6-C20 and PM6-C30 blends showed lower EQE responses throughout the absorption ranges. These results correspond well with the Jsc trends of the PSC devices.

To understand the origin of the photovoltaic trends depending on the PD, we examined the charge generation, transport and recombination properties of the PD:Y7 blends. First, the charge generation properties of the blends were compared by calculating the exciton dissociation probabilities (P(E,T)s) from the photocurrent density (Jph) versus effective voltage (Veff) curves in Fig. S4 (ESI†).54 Although all the blends showed high P(E,T) values (over 93%), the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends had even higher P(E,T) values (95–96%). This suggests that, compared with the other blends, the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends have better charge generation abilities at D–A interfaces. Subsequently, the SCLC mobilities of the blend films were measured to investigate their charge transport abilities (Table S1, ESI†). The μh values of the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends were higher than that of the PM6:Y7 blend. However, both the μh and electron mobility (μe) values of the PM6-C20:Y7 and PM6-C30:Y7 blends were significantly lower (i.e., 1-order lower μh in magnitude) compared with those of the other blends, explaining their low Jsc values. Next, the dependences of Jsc and Voc on light intensity (P) were examined to elucidate the charge recombination properties of the blends (Fig. 2c and d). Generally, the Voc of PSCs is proportional to the natural logarithm of P, with the unit of kT q−1 (k = Boltzmann's constant, T = temperature and q = elementary charge), and its slope (S) approaches unity when no monomolecular or trap-assisted recombination occurs before charge collection to electrodes.55,56 It is known that the Jsc values have a power-law relationship with P (Jsc ∝ Pα), and the α value reaches unity when bimolecular recombination does not occur in PSCs.55 Notably, the PM6-C5:Y7 (S = 1.06 kT q−1) and PM6-C10:Y7 (S = 1.04 kT q−1) blends showed considerably suppressed monomolecular/trap-assisted recombinations compared with the PM6:Y7 blend (S = 1.12 kT q−1) (Fig. 2c). However, the PM6-C20 (S = 1.21 kT q−1) and PM6-C30 (S = 1.25 kT q−1) blends showed deviated S values from unity. Additionally, the PM6-C20 and PM6-C30 blends showed highly deviated α values from unity (α = 0.90–0.91) in comparison with the other blends (α = 0.94–0.96), indicating that bimolecular recombination also occurs more strongly in these blends (Fig. 2d). Because charge recombination in PSCs affects their Jsc and FF,55 the recombination properties support superior Jsc and FF values for the PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 blends compared with the other blends.
Morphological properties
The enhanced photovoltaic and electrical properties of the PM6-C5- and PM6-C10-based PSCs can be attributed to their unique morphological properties. The morphological properties of all the blends were investigated by RSoXS, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and DSC measurements (Fig. 3 and Fig. S5, S6, ESI†). The RSoXS profiles were obtained under a beam energy of 284.4 eV, which can maximize the material contrast between the PDs and SMA.57 All the blends, except for the PM6-C5:Y7 blend, showed distinguishable peaks at approximately q = 0.008 Å−1 (domain spacing ∼80 nm). However, the blends exhibited different peak intensities depending on the PDs. For more quantitative analysis, we estimated the relative domain purity of each blend, which is proportional to the square root of the integrated scattering intensity (√ISI) (Table 3).58 Interestingly, a non-monotonic trend of the relative domain purities of the blends depending on the PD was observed. The PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 blends showed considerably lower relative domain purities of 0.14 and 0.24, respectively, compared with the PM6:Y7 blend (0.52). However, the PM6-C20 and PM6-C30 blends exhibited higher values of 0.69 and 1.00, respectively, than the PM6 blend. This result indicates that introducing small portions of FS units into PDs (PM6-C5 and PM6-C10) significantly decreased the domain purities of the PD and SMA domains while facilitating the generation of intermixed domains.59 However, the excessive incorporation of FS units (PM6-C20 and PM6-C30) caused stronger phase separation between the PD and SMA domains with high purities. A similar non-monotonic trend of the surface roughness of the PM6-CX:Y7 blends depending on the FS content was also observed in the AFM height images in Fig. S5 (ESI†). The root-mean-square average roughness (Rq) was minimum at 1.0 nm for the PM6-C5:Y7 blend, while the other blends had higher Rq values. For example, the PM6-C30:Y7 blend had an Rq of 4.4 nm.

The DSC thermograms of the blends were compared, which showed very distinct thermal properties for the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends (Fig. 3b). The samples were prepared following the fabrication conditions of optimal PSC devices to elucidate the correlation between the morphological and photovoltaic properties of the devices. In detail, the blend films were prepared on glass substrates by the same film casting method (i.e., spin coating) with device fabrication, and collected in DSC pans. Subsequently, the DSC curves during the 1st heating cycles were analyzed to directly investigate the morphological characteristics of the spin-coated blend films.60 For the pristine PDs, there existed no recognizable endothermic and exothermic peaks, which are common phenomena for BDT-based PDs (Fig. S6, ESI†).26 However, pristine Y7 showed a distinct melting transition peak at a melting temperature (Tm) of 231.9 °C, with a melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of 2.56 J g−1 in the 1st heating cycle (Fig. S6, ESI† and Table 3). The high ΔHm value was attributed to the strong intermolecular interactions from the highly rigid backbone of the Y7 SMA.61 The PM6:Y7, PM6-C20:Y7 and PM6-C30:Y7 blends also showed pronounced melting transition peaks with similar Tm values of approximately 209 °C and ΔHms in the range of 0.36–0.63 J g−1, which belong to Y7 (Fig. 3b and Table 3). In contrast, the melting transition peaks completely disappeared in the cases of the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends. Instead, exothermic peaks appeared in the lower temperature range of 148–166 °C. These exothermic transitions in the heating cycle were attributed to the cold-crystallization process of Y7, often observed when imperfect crystals were developed in the blend film.28,62,63 The PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 blends had cold-crystallization temperatures (Tccs) of 148 and 166 °C, and cold-crystallization enthalpies (ΔHccs) of 0.88 J g−1 and 0.19 J g−1, respectively. This result suggests that the formation of Y7 crystallites was significantly suppressed in the PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 blends compared with that in the PM6 blend.63–65 And, the result is well supported by the UV-vis absorption spectra of the blend films in Fig. S7 (Table S2, ESI†). The PM6-C5- and PM6-C10-based blend films showed blue-shifted λmax values (approximately 837 nm) of Y7 absorption, compared with the other blends showing λmax values in the range of 842–847 nm. This suggests that Y7 molecules were less aggregated/crystallized only in the PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 blends.66
To further understand the origin of different blend morphologies depending on the PD, we analyzed the crystalline properties of the neat PDs by grazing-incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) measurements (Fig. S8, ESI†). Although the incorporation of the FS units gradually changed the orientation of the PD packing structures from a face-on to an edge-on structure, the excessive growth of the PD crystals in both the face-on and edge-on orientations was suppressed in the PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 films. Thus, the combined results from the blend morphological analyses indicate that excessive crystal formation in both the PD and Y7 SMA was suppressed and, instead, more intermixed domains with larger PD–SMA interfaces were developed in the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends compared with the other blends.
Mechanical properties
The distinctive morphological properties of the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends significantly impact their mechanical properties. First, the thin-film mechanical properties of the blends were investigated using the pseudo free-standing tensile testing method (Fig. 4 and Table 4). This method enables the measurement of the intrinsic tensile properties of thin films, excluding the effects of substrates.67,68 The most interesting observation is the remarkably enhanced tensile properties of the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends. The PM6:Y7 blend showed a brittle tensile behavior under mechanical strain, with a COS of only 2.33% and a toughness of 0.26 MJ m−3. However, the PM6-C5:Y7 blend had a COS of 12.09% and a toughness of 3.67 MJ m−3, which were 6 and 14 times higher than those for the PM6:Y7 blend, respectively. From the images obtained during elongation, it is evident that the PM6:Y7 blend showed sharp and brittle cracking at 3% strain, whereas the PM6-C5:Y7 blend underwent large plastic deformations with wrinkled features even at 10% strain (Fig. 4c). Interestingly, the excessive FS units in the PDs decreased both the COS and toughness values. For example, the COS and toughness of the PM6-C30:Y7 blend are 3.82% and 0.50 MJ m−3, respectively. This indicates that the presence of large intermixed domains in the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends had an impact on the tensile properties of the blend films.69 The morphology in terms of domain purity and phase separation was optimized for the PM6-C5:Y7 blend, which afforded PSCs with simultaneously enhanced PCE (17%) and COS (12%) values compared with the reference PM6:Y7 blend (PCE = 15% and COS = 2%). The PCE and COS values obtained in this study were compared with those of other studies (Fig. 4b and Table S3, ESI†).13–16,70–74

Next, the cohesion properties of the PSCs were evaluated by double cantilever beam (DCB) test methods. The sample structure and measured cohesive fracture energy (Gc) values are presented in Table 4 and Fig. S11 (ESI†). In addition, the load versus displacement curves are shown in Fig. S12 (ESI†). After the test, it was confirmed that the fracture occurred within the active blend film. The PM6:Y7 blend showed a moderate Gc value of 1.01 J m−2. In contrast, the blend samples with the PM6-C5 (Gc = 2.13 J m−2) and PM6-C10 (Gc = 1.62 J m−2) PDs showed 2.1- and 1.6-fold higher Gc values than the PM6:Y7 blend, respectively. The blends with PM6-C20 and PM6-C30 showed poor cohesion properties with Gc values of 0.49 J m−2. The remarkably enhanced cohesion properties of the PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 blends could also be attributed to the presence of more developed intermixed domains than the other blends, effectively dissipating mechanical stresses and enhancing adhesion/cohesion properties in the blends.75–77
To explore the potential of the enhanced mechanical properties of the PM6-C5- and PM6-C10-based blends, flexible PSC (FPSC) devices were fabricated and their photovoltaic properties investigated under continuous bending. The bending experiment and FPSCs are depicted in Fig. S13 (ESI†). The J–V curves and normalized PCE values depending on the bending cycles are plotted in Fig. S14 (ESI). The PM6-C5:Y7 blend showed a high initial PCE of 11.64% in the FPSC structure, exceeding that of the PM6:Y7-based FPSC (PCE = 10.29%). Importantly, the PM6-C5:Y7-based FPSC exhibited better tolerance towards the bending cycles than the PM6:Y7-based FPSC (Fig. S14, ESI†). Thus, the use of the PM6-C5 PD enhanced both the photovoltaic and mechanical properties of the FPSC devices.
The schematic illustrations in Fig. 4d show the different morphologies and mechanical behaviors of the blends. The blends with PDs (PM6-C0, PM6-C20 and PM6-C30) without the FS unit or with excessive FS content underwent considerable phase separation between the PD and SMA domains, resulting in higher domain purity. The isolated and pure domains make it difficult for free charges to hop into the other domains, inducing deteriorated charge mobilities and increased charge recombination in the blends. Furthermore, the weak adhesion/cohesion along the sharp interfaces between the PD and SMA domains may provide a crack propagation pathway. In contrast, the PM6-C5:Y7 and PM6-C10:Y7 blends exhibited significantly improved blend morphologies with a larger portion of intermixed domains of the PD and SMA. These morphological features afford efficient charge generation and hopping through interconnected PD and SMA networks. Importantly, the mechanical stresses in these blends can be effectively dissipated through the better-mixed domains.
Conclusion
In summary, we developed a series of high-performance PDs by introducing various amounts of 1,10-di(thiophen-2-yl)decane FS units into a well-known rigid PM6 polymer backbone. It was found that a small content of FS units in PM6-C5 and PM6-C10 significantly improved the morphology of PD–SMA blends, and restricted the overgrowth of PD and SMA crystallites, without compromising any advantageous properties for efficient PSCs, such as pre-aggregation properties and hole mobilities. This led to the formation of favorable percolation pathways and the suppression of charge recombination. Owing to the augmented Jsc and FF compared with PM6, the best-performing PDs showed a superior PCE of 17%. Meanwhile, larger interfaces in the PD–SMA blends enabled effective stress dissipation and unprecedented ductile behaviors of SMA-based binary blends. For instance, the PM6-C5-based blends afforded a superior COS of 12%, a toughness of 3.67 MJ m−3 and a Gc of 2.13 J m−2, which are 6-, 14- and 2-fold increases as compared to PM6-based blends, respectively. Our work clearly shows that simultaneous enhancement of the photovoltaic performance and mechanical reliability can be achieved through the simple modification of molecular structures, moving PSCs a step closer to be used as power generators for flexible/stretchable electronics.
Experimental
General procedure for polymerization of PM6-CX
In a 20 mL vial, BDT monomer (100 μmol), BDD monomer (X μmol), 1,10-bis(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)decane [FS unit, (100 − X) μmol] and Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst (3 μmol) were dissolved in 5 mL chlorobenzene and 0.5 mL N,N-dimethylformamide. Particularly, in the case of PM6-C20 and PM6-C30, toluene was used instead of chlorobenzene to increase the molecular weights similar to those of the other PDs. The mole percent of added FS units was decided to be X mol% of the total dibromo-substituted (BDD + FS) units. After purging with argon, the solution was stirred at a temperature of 120 °C for 36 h. The crude product was precipitated in methanol and purified through Soxhlet extraction. The polymer was sequentially washed with methanol, acetone, hexane and THF, and extracted from chloroform. The final product was obtained after the precipitation of the chloroform fraction in methanol and drying in a vacuum oven.
Characterization
A UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments) was used to obtain UV-vis spectra. Cyclic voltammograms were obtained from an EG and G Parc model 273 Å system. DSC 25 (TA Instruments) was used to estimate the thermal properties of the materials. RSoXS data were obtained at beamline 11.0.1.2 in the Advanced Light Source (USA). GIXS data were collected at beamline 9A in Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (Republic of Korea). The Lc values were estimated using the Scherrer equation:78  K means the shape factor (set to 0.9 in this work). Δq means the full-width at half-maximum of each scattering.
Thin film tensile measurement
The tests were performed following the same sample structures and experimental procedures with previously reported articles.25,79 A high-resolution load-cell was used to measure the load values under strains, and a constant strain rate (0.8 × 10−3 s−1) was applied throughout the measurement. The results of more than three samples for each system were collected to obtain the average values and the standard deviations, which are presented in Table 4.
DCB test
The samples for the DCB test having a structure of glass/active layer/Au/epoxy (Epo-Tek 353ND, Epoxy Technology)/glass were fabricated by following the procedures in our previous report.25 The results of more than three samples for each system were collected to obtain the average values and the standard deviations (Table 4). The critical strain energy release rates (Gcs) were estimated from the load cells having high resolution (Delaminator Adhesion Test System, DTS Company, Menlo Park, USA) under ambient conditions. The debond length (a) was obtained from the following equations:80    C = compliance (dδ/dP), δ = displacement between beam ends and Pc = critical load, E′ = plane strain modulus of the glass (=76 GPa), B = width of the specimen (=8 mm) and h = half height of the specimen.

Broader context
Achieving sufficient mechanical reliability for highly efficient polymer solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their potential application in various areas, where mechanical stress presents as a major cause for device failure. However, it is challenging to develop PSCs with both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and mechanical robustness, as photoactive materials with planar and rigid backbones used for efficient PSCs result in brittle films with strong segregation. In this study we developed an effective strategy to obtain highly efficient PSCs with remarkable mechanical robustness, by rational design of polymer donors (PDs) with aliphatic flexible spacer (FS) units incorporated into a rigid polymer backbone. PSCs with PCEs of 17% and crack-onset strains (COSs) of 12% were demonstrated, which are among the most efficient and mechanically robust PSCs reported to date.
