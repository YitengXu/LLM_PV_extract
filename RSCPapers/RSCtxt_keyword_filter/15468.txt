    , Accepted 14th April 2016First published on 14th April 2016AbstractBy varying the fluorine atom number and position, four novel fluorinated diphenyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole compounds, o-fDPP, o-ffDPP, m-fDPP, and m-ffDPP, were designed and synthesized. These key building blocks were then used to construct polymers with the benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) donor moiety. Using this new system a systematic study to compare the numbers and positions of fluorine decoration was performed to understand their effect on the electronic properties, morphology and solar cell device performance. In comparison with the parent, non-fluorinated polymer, meta-fluorinated polymers showed a red-shift in the absorption, whereas such a shift was minimal for the ortho-fluorinated polymers. On introducing fluorine atoms into diphenyl-diketopyrrolopyrrole only a very small influence on both the HOMO and LUMO energy levels was observed, which was verified by theoretical calculations. However, fluorination can influence the planarity of the backbone, by introducing F⋯S interactions. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) showed that meta-fluorinated polymers had an enhanced crystal size, while ortho-fluorinated polymers were less crystalline, in comparison with the non-fluorinated polymer. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) showed that fluorinated polymer:PC71BM blends tended to form larger phase separated domains, leading to a smaller Jsc than that of the non-fluorinated analogue. The photovoltaic performance results were corroborated with the electrochemical and morphological characterization of these polymers. Consequently, the Pm-fDPP-based device exhibited the highest PCE of 1.40% among the fluorinated polymers. Although the Pm-fDPP-based device had slightly larger Voc and FF values than that of non-fluorinated PDPP, the overall device performance was lower than that of PDPP (1.7%) because of the smaller Jsc.
1. Introduction
The atom decoration of conjugated materials has proven to be an effective route to modulate their electronic properties.1 Fluorine (F), for example, has been introduced into both the side-chain and backbone of many systems. In many cases, fluorinated donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers, especially when the fluorine atom is introduced into the acceptor unit, show improved photovoltaic properties. The fluorination of thienothiophene (TT),2,3 benzothiadiazole (BT),4,5 benzotriazole (TAZ)6,7 and quinoxaline8,9 building blocks yielded polymers with high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). Aside from the change in electronic properties, fluorination can also alter the structure and miscibility with other materials.10,11 An obvious benefit of introducing fluorine is the lowering of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) level, which would lead to a larger energy offset with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PCBM to create a larger open-circuit voltage (Voc).12,13 Yu and coworkers, for example, showed that introducing a fluorine atom into the thieno[3,4-b]thiophene-alt-benzodithiophene copolymer significantly improved the Voc without changing the short-circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (FF).2,14 In other cases, the fluorinated polymer also showed improvement in Jsc and FF solar cell devices.15
However, the amount and positioning of the fluorine is important.16,17 Consequently, a more detailed study on the impact of fluorine on the structure–property relationship is critical. Here, we choose diaryl-diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) as the key building block to carry out a systematic study of the “F effect”. DPP can be readily synthesized by a condensation reaction, and phenyl or thienyl groups are often used as substituents. The DPP unit has a large planar π surface, exhibits strong π–π interactions and an electron-deficiency, and is a good building block to construct low band gap polymers.18,19 However, in most cases, DPP-based copolymers show a high Jsc but low Voc (<0.8 eV).20,21 Further deepening the HOMO energy levels of DPP materials can be beneficial. Unfortunately, the simple chemical modification of replacing the thiophene by furan, selenophene, and thieno[3,2-b]thiophene does not significantly improve the Voc.22,23 Fluorination of the DPP unit is another route that can be used. Herein, diphenyl-DPP was used as a model compound. We varied the level of fluorination and position of substitution, and constructed four fluorinated monomers (o-fDPP, o-ffDPP, m-fDPP, and m-ffDPP, as shown in Scheme 1, “o” and “m” refer to the fluorine atoms oriented ortho- and meta- to the DPP core; “f” and “ff” refer to monofluoro- and difluoro-substitution). These building blocks were then copolymerized with BDT to generate conjugated polymers PDPP, Po-fDPP, Po-ffDPP, Pm-fDPP, and Pm-ffDPP. The influence of fluorination on the optoelectronic properties, crystallinity, bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology, and device efficiency was systematically studied.

2. Experimental section
Materials
All chemicals and reagents were used as received from commercial sources. (4,8-Bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane) was purchased from Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science Technology Co Ltd. Anhydrous toluene was distilled from sodium/benzophenone ketyl prior to use.
General measurement and characterization
NMR spectra were collected on a Varian Mercury Plus 500 spectrometer with tetramethylsilane as the internal standard. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) experiments were carried out using a Shimadzu AXIMA-CFR Plus time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK). UV-Vis spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu 3150 PC spectrophotometer. TGA measurements were performed on a Netzsch TG209 apparatus. DSC measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer DSC 7 instrument with approximately 5 mg samples at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 under N2. GPC analysis of the copolymers was performed on a Shimadzu 10A series with THF as the eluent and polystyrene as the standard for calibration. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed at a scanning rate of 50 mV s−1 on an AUTOLAB PGSTAT30 potentiostat/galvanostat system (Ecochemie, Netherlands), which was equipped with a three-electrode cell. The sample was cast onto a glass carbon disk as the working electrode and a Pt wire was used as the counter electrode. Ag/Ag+ was used as the reference electrode. Tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 mol L−1) was used as a supporting electrolyte. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD) measurements were performed at beamline 7.3.3 at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). An X-ray beam impinged onto the sample at a grazing angle above the critical angle of the polymer film (αc = 0.16) but below the critical angle of the silicon substrate (αc = 0.24). The wavelength of X-rays used was 1.240 Å, and the scattered intensity was detected by using a PILATUS 2M detector. Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was performed at beamline 11.0.1.2 ALS LBNL. Thin films were floated onto a water surface and transferred onto Si3N4 substrates and the experiments were done in the transmission mode.
X-ray crystallography
Well-shaped single crystals were selected for X-ray diffraction studies. Data were collected on a Bruker SMART CCD diffractometer with a graphite monochromated MoKα radiation (λ = 0.71703 Å) using the φ and ω scan method at 293(2) K. The structures were solved by direct methods using the SHELXS-97 program39 and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 with the SHELXL-97 program.
Fabrication and characterization of photovoltaic cells
The indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass substrates (20 ± 5 ohms per sq.) were bought from Thin Film Devices Inc., and were cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent, DI water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and then dried in an oven overnight. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P VP A1 4083) (∼35 nm) was spin-coated onto ultraviolet ozone-treated ITO substrates. After annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in air, the substrates were transferred to a glove box. Polymer/PC71BM ortho-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) solution (10 mg mL−1) was spin-coated onto the PEDOT:PSS layer at 3000 rpm. The thickness of the film was ∼80–100 nm (KLA-TENCOR Alpha-Step IQ Surface Profiler). Finally, ∼1 nm LiF and then a 100 nm thick Al cathode were deposited (area 6.5 mm2) onto the active layer under high vacuum (2 × 10−4 Pa) using a thermal evaporator. All current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the devices were measured under simulated AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a Xe lamp-based solar simulator (Newport 91160 300 W). A Xe lamp equipped with an AM1.5G filter was used as the white light source. The light intensity was adjusted with an NREL-calibrated Si solar cell with a KG-5 filter.

Synthesis of copolymers via Stille coupling polymerization
A representative procedure is as follows. A degassed solution of the two monomers (1 mmol each) and Pd(PPh3)4 (5 mol%) in toluene (10 mL) was heated at 110 °C for 48 h under argon. After cooling to room temperature, the reaction mixture was poured into a large volume of methanol. The precipitate was collected and further purified by successive Soxhlet extraction with methanol, acetone and finally chloroform. Finally, the chloroform fraction was concentrated, and then precipitated in methanol. The polymer was collected by filtration and dried in a vacuum at 60 °C.

3. Results and discussion
Synthesis
There are two routes to synthesise diaryl-DPP. The most general method is a “one-pot” synthesis via condensation of aromatic nitrile with dialkyl succinate under harsh conditions, involving the use of a strong base and high reaction temperature.24 The second approach uses a stepwise synthesis route starting with the synthesis of pyrrolinone, and then followed by condensation with nitrile to prepare asymmetric diaryl-DPP derivatives.25–27 Our attempt to use the “one-pot” synthesis was not successful, since the strongly electron-deficient groups (such as fluoro, nitro) are incompatible with the harsh reaction conditions.
We modified the synthetic route reported by Morton et al. to prepare fluorinated diphenyl-DPP monomers and details are shown in Schemes 2 and 3. The synthesis of the ortho-F substituted DPP monomer was completed in a five step method starting from 4-bromo-2-fluorobenzoic acid 1. The β-keto ester 2 was obtained by condensation of potassium 3-ethoxy-3-oxopropanoate with an N,N′-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) activated ester of compound 1. Subsequently, the reaction of compound 2 with ethyl bromoacetate using K2CO3 as the base to deprotonate the proton located between the two carbonyl groups provided the intermediate ketodiester 3, which was then used in the Paal–Knorr reaction in the presence of ammonium acetate refluxing in acetic acid to afford the pyrroline-carboxylate ester 4. However, a direct reaction between 4 and nitrile 5 or 6 failed to give the corresponding ring closure product 9 or 10 by using a strong base sodium t-amyloxide refluxing in t-amyl alcohol, due to the instability of intermediates under such harsh conditions. We then modified this method to synthesize methyl benzimidate derivatives 7 and 8,28 and then condensation was performed with pyrroline-carboxylate ester 4 using a weak base (K2CO3 for 9, and MgCl2/DMAP for 10) to afford the desired products. Further N-alkylation (2-ethylhexyl) of 8 and 9 gave rise to the key o-fDPP and o-ffDPP monomers. Similarly, F meta-substituted DPP monomers m-fDPP and m-ffDPP could also be obtained. All four monomers were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 19F NMR, mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray diffraction. These results are summarized in the ESI (Fig. S1–S12†).

Conjugated polymers were synthesized by the Stille cross-coupling polymerization from equimolar amounts of the bis(trimethyltin) BDT monomer and the dibrominated DPP monomers in toluene using Pd(PPh3)4 as a catalyst (Scheme 4). The polymers were purified by successive Soxhlet extractions with methanol, acetone, hexane and finally chloroform. The chloroform fractions were collected and reprecipitated into methanol to afford the corresponding polymers. The resulting polymers exhibited good solubility in solvents such as chlorobenzene (CB) and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (DCB). As shown in Table 1, the number average molecular weights (Mn) were 23.9 kg mol−1 for non-fluorinated PDPP, 28.3 and 36.7 kg mol−1 for ortho-fluorinated Po-fDPP and Po-ffDPP, respectively, and 26.9 and 41.1 kg mol−1 for meta-fluorinated Pm-fDPP and Pm-ffDPP, respectively, measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).

Single crystal structure
To clarify the molecular structure, four fluorinated DPP monomers with short ethyl or n-butyl side chains were synthesized. Single crystals of these molecules were obtained by the slow solvent evaporation of 1,4-dioxane solutions. The crystal structures determined by X-ray diffraction are presented in Fig. 1, and the corresponding crystallographic data are summarized in Table S1.†o-ffDPP co-crystallized with the 1,4-dioxane molecule that apparently came from the solvent system, in a 1:1 stoichiometry. The crystals of m-fDPP, m-ffDPP and o-fDPP are monoclinic and o-ffDPP is triclinic. It was observed that the alkyl side chains adopted a syn geometry with respect to the DPP plane in meta-fluorinated monomers, while maintaining an anti geometry in ortho-fluorinated monomers. For difluoro-substituted monomers, two fluorine atoms in m-ffDPP were arranged syn to each other, whereas in o-ffDPP two fluorine atoms were anti to each other. The molecular structures of diphenyl-DPP were linked by two σ bonds (two phenyl-DPP linkages), and the dihedral angles between the two phenyl rings and the central DPP core are 40.1 and 44.9° in m-fDPP, 44.7 and 39.0° in m-ffDPP, 44.7 and 42.7° in o-fDPP, and 52.1 and 52.1° in o-ffDPP. Thus, a more twisted conformation is obtained in the fluorinated compounds (non-fluorinated DPP shows a dihedral angle of 36.1°).29

The n-butyl side chains are somewhat disordered (thermal ellipsoids: 50% probability). 
The crystal packing of all the fluorinated DPP monomers is shown in Fig. 2. meta-Fluorinated m-fDPP and m-ffDPP exhibited respective P1c1(7) and P(2) space groups and different packings. ortho-Fluorinated o-fDPP and o-ffDPP showed the same space group (C2/c) and a similar molecular packing. o-fDPP stacked into a slipped herringbone structure along the crystallographic a-axis. The adjacent molecules formed slipped stacks with distances of 3.64 and 3.66 Å between two adjacent phenyl units and an interplane spacing of 3.9 Å between two adjacent DPP cores. The centroid-to-centroid distance between two adjacent DPP cores was about 4.23 Å, which suggested an offset angle of 22.9°. However, nearly no π–π overlapping was observed between the adjacent molecules in o-ffDPP, where molecules interacted with each other and the 1,4-dioxane solvent molecule through F⋯H and O⋯H interactions. meta-Fluorinated monomers m-fDPP and m-ffDPP exhibited a similar molecular packing style. Two inversion-related molecules are associated through π–π interactions (centroid-to-centroid distance of 3.43 Å) to form a face-to-face dimer.

Thermal properties
The thermal properties of the polymers were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under a nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1 (Fig. S13 and S14†). The onset of decomposition temperatures (Td, corresponding to 5% weight loss) was all above 400 °C (Table 1), indicating high thermal stability. Since our results showed no significant differences between the Td values of the five polymers, we concluded that the amount and position of fluorination did not influence the polymer thermal stability. All five polymers exhibited weak thermal transitions on heating and no obvious thermal transitions were observed on cooling over the temperature range from 30 to 300 °C. These polymers showed a weak, broad crystallization peak on heating except for Po-fDPP. The crystallization exothermal peaks were 216 °C for PDPP, 226 °C for Po-ffDPP, 232 °C for Pm-fDPP, and 245 °C for Pm-ffDPP. Melting temperatures (Tm) for these polymers must be high since no obvious melting peaks were observed when heating up to 300 °C. Only Po-fDPP exhibited a broad melting peak at about 260 °C.
Optical and electrochemical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of all five polymers in a dilute chloroform solution and thin films are shown in Fig. 3, and the data are listed in Table 2. In a dilute solution, all the spectra exhibited two absorption bands, one π–π* transition band between 300 and 450 nm, and the other characteristic intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) peaks at low energy absorption bands (450–700 nm). Although the backbones of the polymers are very similar and fluorine atoms are small in size, the introduction of fluorine atoms onto the phenyl units has obvious effects on the absorption spectra. The ICT peaks became more intense as more fluorine atoms were introduced, thus fluorine atoms can enhance the ICT between the BDT and DPP units. The ortho-fluorinated Po-fDPP and Po-ffDPP showed a slight bathochromic shift (2–9 nm) of ICT peaks compared to non-fluorinated PDPP (530 nm). When fluorinated at the meta-position, ICT peaks (in Pm-fDPP and Pm-ffDPP) shifted to 569 and 577 nm, respectively, showing a significant red shift of 39 and 47 nm. This obvious red shift of ICT peaks for meta-fluorinated polymers could be attributed to the increased effective conjugation lengths induced by intramolecular F⋯S interactions,30,31 which will be discussed in the theoretical calculation section. The four fluorinated polymers exhibited almost the same absorption coefficient of ∼6.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1, slightly higher than that of the non-fluorinated polymer (∼5.0 × 104 M−1 cm−1). In a thin film, all polymers showed a slight red-shift of about 2–12 nm except for Po-ffDPP. Thus these polymers adopted a similar geometry in solids as they did in solution. The interchain stacking can be weak due to the large twisting angle in the diphenyl-DPP unit.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of these polymers were investigated by cyclic voltammetry from the onset potentials of the first oxidation and reduction peaks, respectively. These results are shown in Fig. 4 and Table 2. All the polymers exhibited similar oxidative and reductive onset potentials with good reversible waves. The oxidative and reductive onset potentials of the polymers are located at about 0.8 and −1.2 eV, respectively, corresponding to HOMO and LUMO energy levels of about −5.60 eV and −3.60 eV. The introduction of fluorine atoms onto the phenyl units has a negligible effect on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels with less than 0.1 eV variations in all five copolymers. Therefore, the HOMO–LUMO band gaps of all the polymers are nearly identical (∼2.0 eV). This result differs from the often-observed decrease of HOMO and/or LUMO levels in fluorinated D–A polymers.12,13 This may arise from the fact that the DPP unit is strong in accepting electron clouds. The addition of a F atom does not strongly modify the electron cloud distribution of the resulting materials.

Theoretical calculations
Quantum chemistry calculations were used to model the influence of fluorination on both the physical structure and energy levels of the polymers. To make computation possible, we chose three repeating units as simplified models, and the 2-ethylhexyl side chains were substituted by methyl groups. The geometries of the trimer models were optimized using density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6-31G level. A crystalline molecular structure is used as the initial guess for the DPP monomer to build trimers.
The optimized conformations and dihedral angles between the phenyl rings and BDT units are illustrated in Fig. 5. For PDPP, dihedral angles of 22–27° are induced between the phenyl rings and BDT units as a consequence of steric hindrance. Fluorination at the ortho-positions of the flanking phenyl units will not affect the torsion between the phenyl rings and BDT units, showing almost the same dihedral angles as PDPP. In contrast, meta-fluorinated Pm-fDPP and Pm-ffDPP trimers favor more planar fashions and decrease the dihedral angles to 10–16° between fluorinated phenyl units and BDT units. The highest degree of backbone coplanarity is ascribed to the interactions between F (in benzene) and S (in BDT).30,31 In DFT calculation, Pm-fDPP and Pm-ffDPP trimers show a F⋯S distance of about 2.78 Å, which is significantly shorter than the sum of F and S van der Waals radii of 3.2 Å. F⋯S interactions in polymers enhance the planarity of the molecule, thus a red-shifted optical property is expected, as seen in our absorption measurements.
 Fig. 5  Optimized geometries for the trimers with color coded atoms: C (grey), N (blue), O (red), S (yellow), and F (cyan). Dihedral angles between the phenyl rings and BDT units are indicated by ϕ. Noncovalent attractive interactions between F⋯S are indicated by a blue dashed line and the distances are listed below. 
The HOMO and LUMO of the trimers were further analyzed. Electron clouds delocalized over the electron-donating (BDT) and electron accepting (DPP) units (Fig. S15†). Non-fluorinated and ortho-fluorinated trimers have almost the same calculated LUMO values of −2.69 eV, while the LUMO levels of meta-fluorinated Pm-fDPP and Pm-ffDPP trimers reduced to −2.80 eV and −2.91 eV, respectively. The distributions of HOMO wave functions in these five trimers are similar to a certain degree, showing almost the same HOMO levels of −5.0 eV. As fluorine is the most electronegative element with a Pauling electronegativity of 4.0, one therefore expects fluorination to have a significant effect on both the HOMO and the LUMO levels due to its electron-withdrawing effect, as commonly observed in many conjugated polymers based on fluorinated benzothiadiazole and fluorinated benzotriazole systems. However, it is worth noting that the fluorine atom has a negligible contribution (≤0.11%) to both the HOMO and LUMO electron densities in all trimers,32 which agrees well with the CV results.
Photovoltaic properties
BHJ solar cell devices were fabricated using the conventional architecture of ITO/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)/LiF/Al. Fig. 6 shows the current density–voltage (J–V) curves, and the photovoltaic data of the devices are summarized in Table 3. All the active layers were spin-coated from DCB, and the D/A blend ratio by weight (polymer/PC71BM) was 1:1.5. For PDPP, a moderate PCE of 1.70% was achieved, with a Jsc of 4.81 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.78 V, and a FF of 45%. Diphenyl-DPP-co-BDT based polymers usually showed a poor photovoltaic performance, as reported by Patil and co-workers.33 The low Jsc is the major limiting factor. This is because the DPP core has steric interactions with the adjacent phenyl groups, producing a twisted molecular geometry to prevent strong intermolecular π–π interactions and weaken the ability of the materials to crystallize, resulting in low charge carrier mobilities.34 The large optical bandgap (∼2 eV) is another important factor limiting the Jsc. It was found that after monofluorination on the phenyl units, the Jsc dropped from 4.81 (PDPP) to 3.40 (Po-fDPP) and 3.55 mA cm−2 (Pm-fDPP). Difluorination further reduced the Jsc of Po-ffDPP and Pm-ffDPP to 1.67 and 2.42 mA cm−2, respectively. Similar behavior has been reported by Yu et al. and McCulloch et al., where introducing fluorine atoms into the polymer backbone significantly reduced the Jsc when compared to non-fluorinated analogues.16,32 All these polymers exhibited a similar Voc, no improvement was realized by fluorination. Among all the polymers, Pm-fDPP exhibited the highest Voc of 0.83 V, which was only improved by 0.05 V compared to PDPP. Similar to Voc, fluorination showed little influence on the FF, and the maximum value of 50% appeared in the Pm-ffDPP-based device. It is clear that Jsc appeared to have the greatest influence on the device performance, so PCEs showed a similar trend as the Jsc: PDPP > monofluorinated polymers > difluorinated polymers. The fluorination of DPP units leads to more twisted dihedral angles between the phenyl units and DPP cores, which further blocks interchain interactions. This should be the major reason for the reduced device performances. It is interesting to note that meta-fluorinated polymers exhibited slightly higher PCEs than that of ortho-fluorinated polymers. This may be partially ascribed to the increased backbone coplanarity and red-shifted absorption as discussed above. We tried to optimize the devices by adding a 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) additive. However, the resultant devices showed even lower PCE values. Details can be found in Table S2.†

BHJ morphology
The crystalline properties of the pure polymer and polymer:PC71BM blends were investigated by grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXD). Shown in Fig. 7 are the out-of-plane (OOP) line-cut profiles of the 2D diffraction data. In the OOP direction, both (010) and (100) diffraction peaks can be observed. The azimuthal spreading of both peaks is wide, and thus crystals are poorly oriented. The (100) diffraction peak is located at 0.55 Å−1 which is attributed to the lamellar stacking of alkyl chains, corresponding to a distance of 11.4 Å. This value is small in comparison with many conjugated polymers having similar alkyl side chains.35 Consequently, the alkyl chains are frustrated and assume a random orientation to reduce the inter-chain spacing. The (010) peak is seen at ∼1.6 Å−1 for all the polymers in the current study, which arises from the inter-chain π–π stacking. The π–π stacking distance is thus estimated to be 3.9 Å, a value larger than most common conjugated materials. Such a large π–π stacking distance is the result of a twisted polymer backbone and the disordering of the alkyl side chains and is, more than likely, the origin of the poor performance of these materials. Different fluorinations of the diphenyl-DPP center do not change the position of the OOP (100) and (010) peaks. However, the peak intensity varies, indicating a difference in crystallinity. The Pm-ffDPP polymer shows a most intense (100) peak, and this correlated well with its flat backbone geometry, which tends to form better crystal packing. In the polymer:PC71BM blend films (Fig. 7b and S16†), the ordering of the polymer did not change. A broad diffraction halo at 1.33 Å−1 is seen, which is attributed to the scattering from PC71BM. This peak overlaps with the (010) diffraction peaks of the polymers, making it difficult to assess. The characteristic (100) diffraction peaks remained at the same positions as that in pure polymer films.
 Fig. 7  Out-of-plane line cut profiles of GIXD data: (a) pure polymer film; (b) BHJ thin films. 
Resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) was used to measure the length scale of the phase separation of BHJ thin films. The photon energy was tuned to 284.2 eV, which is at the carbon K-edge and enhanced the contrast between the polymer and fullerene. The scattering profiles of these blends are shown in Fig. 8, and the corresponding data are summarized in Table S3.† DCB is used as the solvent to process BHJ blends, which dissolves the polymer and PCBM. The PDPP:PC71BM blend film shows a well-defined peak located at ∼0.0054 A−1, corresponding to a 116 nm center-to-center domain spacing. This is the smallest phase separation in the set of materials and thus a relatively high performance is obtained in solar cell devices. Fluorination of the backbone leads to an enlarged phase separation between the polymer and PCBM. After monofluorination on the phenyl units, scattering peaks appear at smaller q values, 0.0035 and 0.0025 A−1 for Po-fDPP and Pm-fDPP, respectively, corresponding to a distance of 180 and 251 nm. Further, difluorination shifts the scattering peaks to 0.0016 and 0.0013 A−1 for Po-ffDPP and Pm-ffDPP, respectively, corresponding to a distance of 393 and 483 nm. The enlarged phase separation is detrimental to exciton splitting and charge transport, and thus inferior device performances are recorded. The variations in the domain size of the blend films correlate well with Jsc. The domain size followed an opposite order to the Jsc: unfluorinated polymers < monofluorinated polymers < difluorinated polymers. However, it was also found that the meta-fluorinated polymer-based blend films exhibited a larger domain spacing than that of the ortho-fluorinated polymers; i.e., the domain spacings were 251 and 180 nm for Pm-fDPP and Po-fDPP, and 483 and 393 nm for Pm-ffDPP and Po-ffDPP, respectively. This result counters the Jsc trend, where meta-fluorinated polymers exhibited a slightly higher Jsc than that of ortho-fluorinated polymers. This can be the reason that meta-fluorinated polymers have a better structure order and thus better transport properties can be achieved. In the DIO-processed blend films (Fig. 8b), all the blend films showed dual scattering peaks, and an additional scattering peak at 0.0012 A−1 was observed, which indicated that a larger domain distribution of ∼524 nm existed in these additive-processed films. This increased domain size was also consistent with the BHJ device measurements, which may explain the drop of Jsc when adding DIO.

4. Conclusions
We have successfully introduced fluorine atoms into the flanking phenyl groups of DPP. A series of conjugated copolymers with an identical backbone (PBDT-DPP) but different fluorinated numbers and positions were synthesized and comprehensively investigated. First, the fluorination position has an obvious effect on the absorption spectra. Compared to non-fluorinated polymers, fluorine ortho-substitutions have little influence on the absorption spectra, while the fluorine meta-substitutions make absorption red-shifted. Second, the introduction of fluorine atoms onto the phenyl units has a negligible effect on the HOMO and LUMO energy levels in this study. This result is obviously different from the often-observed phenomenon where fluorination simultaneously lowers the molecular energy levels in the D–A polymers. Third, the introduction of fluorine atoms into the polymer backbone significantly reduces the Jsc, but shows little influence on Voc and FF, compared to non-fluorinated analogues. Furthermore, meta-fluorinated polymers exhibit slightly higher PCEs than that of ortho-fluorinated polymers, and monofluorinated polymers exhibit slightly higher PCEs than that of difluorinated polymers. As a result, the Pm-fDPP-based device exhibits the highest PCE of 1.40% among the fluorinated polymers. Fourth, fluorination increases the phase-separated domain size in the active layer. meta-Fluorinated polymers show enhanced crystallinity, while ortho-fluorinated polymers are less crystalline as compared to non-fluorinated polymers. This comparative study demonstrates that the fluorination position and number indeed has a significant impact on the optoelectronic and structural properties, and fluorination does not always guarantee higher photovoltaic efficiency. Although fluorination on the flanking phenyl units of the DPP core results in negative influences on the photovoltaic performance in this study, it provides a new strategy to further optimize the electrical properties of DPP-containing copolymers. Further research will focus on the fluorinated dithienyl-DPP, and work in that direction is in progress.
