    , Accepted 6th June 2015First published on 10th June 2015AbstractA facile wet soaking process by immersing a CIGS thin film in a mixed aqueous solution, containing gallium trichloride and thioacetamide at 80 °C for a few tens of seconds, was proposed to reduce the existence of defects in the CIGS absorption layer which can be confirmed by the temperature dependence of the open-circuit voltage (Voc). The depth profiles of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results indicate that the gallium (Ga) concentration increases during the short wet soaking time, resulting in a widening of the band gap near the surface region. The enhanced carrier lifetime attributed to the Ga-induced defect reduction during thermal treatment of device fabrication was evaluated by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy. With wet and light soaking processes, Voc, short circuit current (Jsc) and fill factor (F.F.) can be increased, yielding a significant enhancement in cell efficiency from ∼1% to ∼6.4%. We believe that this fast, simple and effective method can further stimulate the development of CBD-Zn(O,S)/post-selenization CIGS solar cells toward commercialized thin film photovoltaics.
Global warming and the depletion of fossil fuel sources have motivated scientists to develop solar cells, which are one of the most promising non-polluting energy sources.1 Among all of the photovoltaic material candidates, copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) is one of the potential absorber materials, with a high optical absorption coefficient that is adequate for solar cell operation, a thickness of only 1–2 μm, high conversion efficiency and flexibility applied to a roll-to-roll process, for industrial applications.2,3 The champion efficiency of ∼21.7% has been achieved by using a co-evaporation process.4 However, the limited scale of co-evaporation is not applicable for the production of commercialized solar cells. Apart from the vacuum-free processes with lower performance such as electrodeposition,5 spray pyrolysis6 and paste coating,2 sputtering deposition is a promising process with the advantages of large scale fabrication, fast throughput and high uniformity.7
An n-type buffer layer synthesized by chemical bath deposition8 is imperative on the top of the CIGS absorber in order to create a p–n junction and protect the absorber from damage caused by the following sputtering process.9,10 Generally, the cell device was fabricated by chemically depositing a CdS layer via chemical bath deposition (CBD) as the p–n junction, with a conversion efficiency over 20% between CIGS and transparent conductive oxide (TCO), while hazardous cadmium (Cd) impels scientists to replace CdS with other alternatives due to the environmental risks.11 As a result, Zn(O,S) has been proposed and serves as a good candidate since it is a kind of environmentally friendly non-toxic material. In addition, Zn(O,S) can achieve higher photon current in the ultra-violet region due to its larger band gap (∼3.6 eV).10,12,13 However, the conversion efficiency in the case of chemical bath deposited (CBD)-Zn(O,S) buffer layer based solar cells is still lower than that of conventional CdS based CIGS solar cells owing to the band gap mismatch.14 Furthermore, Ga accumulation at the bottom of the CIGS film, which leads to a narrower band gap, triggers the formation of CISe2 at the surface of CIGS after the selenization process.15,16 Due to the problems of higher defect density and band alignment, the fabrication of CBD-Zn(O,S)/post-selenized CIGS solar cells with good performance remains a challenge.
In 2001, T. Wada proposed that the surface of the CIGS film can be modified by soaking in In–S solution due to the sulfurization treatment.17 In 2002, Tokio Nakada demonstrated a surface treatment by immersing the CIGS film into group III chlorides and thioacetamide solution mixture, and surface sulfurization was found in the case of In–S soaking. However, this situation was not obvious in the case of other group III-S soaking.18 In 2011, the defect density modification on the CIGS surface by In–S soaking was put forward.19 In this regard, a facile wet soaking process by immersing a CIGS thin film in a mixed aqueous solution containing gallium trichloride and thioacetamide at 80 °C for a few tens of seconds was proposed and demonstrated to reduce the existence of defects in the CIGS absorption layer. We observed that the Ga atoms in GaCl3 diffuse from the surface to a depth of ∼100 nm of the CIGS thin film as evidenced by the XPS depth profile. The decreased defect density of the CIGS thin film after the wet soaking process was confirmed by the measurement of temperature-dependent Voc results. In addition, the reduced carrier recombination can be verified by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) measurements. Reduced defect density was found as the soaking time is longer, but the cell was also deteriorated by the excess diffused gallium atoms. As a result, the soaking time of 20 seconds shows the best wet soaking parameter in our study with a significant enhancement in cell efficiency from ∼1% to ∼6.4%.

Fig. 1(a)–(d) show the planar view SEM images of the pristine CIGS thin film and CIGS films after the wet soaking processes for 10, 20 and 30 seconds, respectively, and the corresponding cross-sectional SEM images are shown in Fig. 1(e)–(h). Note that we care about whether the morphology and composition change or not after the wet soaking process. Compared to the co-evaporation process, the sputtered CIGS shows a much rougher surface due to nucleation and grain growth of the CIGS film between Se atoms and Cu–In–Ga after the selenization process at 570 °C.20 Also, the small holes contained in the grains shown in Fig. 1(a)–(d) are the intrinsic defects formed after the selenization process. As a result, no obvious dissimilarity can be found between the pristine sample and the samples with different soaking times from 10–30 s.

Furthermore, XPS was utilized to acquire composition profiles of the pristine CIGS thin film and the CIGS thin films with different wet soaking processes for 10, 20 and 30 seconds as shown in Fig. 2(a)–(d), respectively. The corresponding XPS depth profiles from the surface to the 100 nm-depth of CIGS samples are shown in Fig. S2.† For the pristine CIGS film after post-selenization as shown in Fig. 2(a) and S2(a),† ∼14 at% Cu, ∼24 at% In, and ∼62 at% Se at the surface of the CIGS film were found. No Ga signal can be detected on the surface of the pristine CIGS film (Fig. S2(a)†) while significant backward diffusion of Ga close to the back Mo electrode was found (Fig. 2(a)), confirming that backward diffusion of Ga happens. The Ga backward diffusion most likely results from Se atoms preferentially reacting with In atoms so that the weakly bonded Ga atoms are squeezed toward the interface between CIGS and the Mo back-electrode.15,16 After the wet soaking process on the pristine CIGS film in the mixed solution for 10 seconds, the concentration of Ga on the surface of the CIGS film can be increased to 15 at% (Fig. 2(b) and S2(b)†). The concentration of Ga on the surface of the CIGS film continuously increases to 25 at% as we increase the time of the wet soaking process to 20 seconds as shown in Fig. 2(c) (Fig. S2(c)†). The increased Ga concentration is most likely due to the diffusion of Ga atoms from solution into the pristine CIGS film. However, the concentration of Ga at the surface reduced to 15% in the case of 30 seconds of soaking (Fig. 2(d) and S2(d)†). The decrease in the Ga concentration may suggest that the soaked Ga atoms can diffuse into the deeper depth of the CIGS film. The main composition difference between pristine and modified CIGS films is the increased concentration of Ga at the surface after the wet soaking process.

To shed light on the defect issue, recombination of electron–hole pairs in the CIGS film without and with the wet soaking processes for 10, 20 and 30 seconds was extracted by electrical measurements of J–V characteristics at different temperatures. It is well known that the J–V curves can be matched by the diode equations given by:21 (1) (2)where JL is the current generated by illuminated light, J00 represents the recombination current density, q is the electric charge, A is the ideality factor, R is the resistivity, G is the shunt resistance and ∅ is the barrier height. By substituting eqn (2) in (1) at J = 0 for V = Voc (open circuit case) with G ≪ JL/Voc, Voc can be extracted by (3)
In eqn (3), we can obtain qVoc = ∅ by extrapolating the line to T = 0 K. If ∅ is equal to the band gap of CIGS, the SRH (Shockley–Read–Hall) recombination is the major path. When ∅ is much less than the band gap of the CIGS, the p–n junction is the main recombination path.22 As a result, the recombination paths in the CIGS absorber layer can be plotted by Voc as a function of different temperatures as shown in Fig. 3(a). Note that Voc = 0.63 eV is almost half of the CIGS band gap for the pristine CIGS without the wet soaking processes, indicating that many defects existed at the interface of the CBD-Zn(O,S)/post-selenization CIGS. The Voc slightly increases from 0.63 to 0.65 eV after the wet soaking process for 10 seconds and increases from 0.65 to 0.85 eV as the soaking time increases from 10 to 20 seconds. The enhanced Voc is due to the decreased defect density at the p–n junction, thus less carrier recombination is caused by trap centers in the CIGS surface. It is noted that the defect reduction might be caused by the repair of Ga atoms from GaCl3 after thermal treatment of device fabrication. However, the Voc diminishes to 0.75 eV as the soaking time further increases to 30 seconds. The reduced Voc is most likely because the amount of Ga at the CIGS surface is too low to effectively recover defects for the longer soaking time of 30 seconds, which has been confirmed by XPS depth profiles. To confirm the elimination of surface recombination of the CIGS film with and without the wet soaking process, carrier lifetimes of the pristine CIGS samples and the CIGS samples with the wet soaking processes for 10 to 30 seconds were measured by time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL), as shown in Fig. 3(b), and the values of carrier lifetime are shown in Table 1. The electrons are initially excited from the valence band to the conduction band by exerting a pulse laser (808 nm, 10 MHz, 1 mW). As the electron–hole recombination occurs, photons released in the form of fluorescence and photoluminescence, depending on time, were detected.23 In Fig. 3(b), the carrier lifetime of the 10 s soaking case is 3.48 ns, which is slightly longer than that of the pristine CIGS with the carrier lifetime of 2.19 ns. As the wet soaking process extends to 20 seconds, the maximum carrier lifetime of 5.73 ns can be achieved, which is almost twice as long as that of the pristine CIGS. However, the lifetime of carriers decreased to 4.25 ns as the wet soaking process of the CIGS sample extends to 20 seconds. The results are in accordance with the temperature-dependent Voc shown in Fig. 3(a).

To shed light on the application of the wet soaking process, the cell device fabrication was carried out by the optimized wet soaking process of 20 seconds. Note that the light soaking process was also applied to cell fabrication in order to optimize the quality of the CBD-Zn(O,S) buffer layer as shown in Fig. 4(a). The measured parameters including open circuit voltage (Voc), short circuit currents (Jsc), the increased fill factor (FF) and solar efficiency are listed in Table 2. Obviously, enhanced Voc, Jsc and FF, yielding enhanced solar efficiency from 1.02 to 4.631%, were measured after the light soaking step since the S/(S + O) ratio could be decreased by photochemical reactions.24,25 After the wet and light soaking processes, the significant Voc, Jsc and FF values can be enhanced with the highest enhanced solar efficiency from 4.631 to 6.403%. The increased FF and Jsc can be attributed to the longer carrier lifetime owing to the less surface recombination at the modified p–n interface with a lower defect density.

The other possible reasons for the improved Voc are attributed to the formation of the CuGaSe2 layer at the surface of the CIGS film.18 The higher band gap of the CuGaSe2 (∼1.68 eV) surface layer contacting the ZnS buffer layer can achieve band alignment, resulting in the elimination of the conduction band offset.26 It can be expected that too many diffused Ga atoms may deteriorate the device for longer soaking times, which is shown in Fig. S3.† In addition, external quantum efficiency (EQE), which is the ratio of defective electrons over the applied photons, including the pristine CIGS sample and the CIGS sample after the wet soaking process for 20 seconds and the light soaking step for 60 minutes was measured as shown in Fig. 4(b) for comparison. Obviously, the enhanced EQE in the region of 400–1200 nm can be attributed to the lower recombination at the surface of CIGS and Zn(O,S) due to the wet soaking process so that more carriers can be transported in the absorber. The findings provide a facile approach to combine the wet soaking process with the zinc sulfide (Zn(O,S)) buffer layer for band gap engineering, which has potential to replace the toxic cadmium sulfide (CdS) layer in conventional CIGS solar cells.
Conclusions
We have demonstrated a simple wet soaking process, which can enhance the cell performance of CBD-Zn(O,S)/post-selenization CIGS by dipping the sample into GaCl3 and thioacetamide solution mixture for a few tens of seconds. No obvious changes of surface morphology can be observed in SEM images. From the depth profile of XPS, the wet soaking for 20 seconds can result in a higher Ga concentration for the reduction of defects. With the measurement of the temperature dependence of Voc, the higher value of the intercept extrapolated at T = 0 K means a lower defect density on the CIGS film surface after the wet soaking process. From the TRPL results, the longer carrier lifetimes are observed due to a lower recombination rate at the interface of CIGS/Zn(O,S) after the wet and light soaking processes, yielding a significantly enhanced cell efficiency of 1.02–6.403%. A higher value of EQE, which is matched with the device performance after the wet and light processes, was observed. With this fast, simple, and effective method, we believe that this work can further stimulate the development of CBD-Zn(O,S)/post-selenization CIGS solar cells toward commercialized thin film photovoltaics.
Experimental section
We used two-stage sputtering to deposit molybdenum (400 nm) on the soda lime glass (SLG) as the back contact electrode. The co-sputtering method was utilized to deposit the precursor using Cu–Ga and In metallic targets and the following selenization process was conducted by annealing Se pellets in a graphite box at 570 °C. Then, the formed CIGS film with a thickness of 1.2 μm was dipped into 5 mM GaCl3 and 100 mM thioacetamide solution mixture for a few tens of seconds at 80 °C and rinsed with deionized water. Subsequently, the Zn(O,S) buffer layer was covered on the CIGS film by chemical bath deposition with 0.03 M zinc sulfate and 0.4 M thiourea at 80 °C for 20 minutes. To maintain the pH value of the CBD bath in the range of 10 to 12, 2–4 M, 25% ammonia water was added.27 Finally, i-ZnO, ITO and Al electrodes with thicknesses of 70 nm, 550 nm and 300 nm were deposited by sputter to complete the whole CIGS devices, respectively.
The surface morphology was analyzed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JSE-6500F, JEOL). For elemental distribution in the CIGS film, the depth profile was conducted by using a X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS, Thermo Fisher Scientific Theta Probe). Voc as a function of temperature was measured by using a Keitheley 4200 system under the class AAA AM 1.5 G solar simulator with a power density of 100 mW cm−2. Time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) was used to determine the carrier lifetime by detecting the emitting fluorescence caused by the carrier recombination as a function of time. The current–voltage characteristics and external quantum efficiency were also measured by using a Keitheley 4200 system under the class AAA AM 1.5 G solar simulator with a constant temperature at 25 °C.
