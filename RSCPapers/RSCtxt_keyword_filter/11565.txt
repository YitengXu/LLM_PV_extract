    , Accepted 29th March 2016First published on 29th March 2016AbstractOrganic–inorganic halide perovskite solar cells are becoming the next big thing in the photovoltaic field owing to their rapidly developing photoelectric conversion performance. Herein, mesoporous structured perovskite devices with various perovskite grain sizes are fabricated by a sequential dropping method, and the charge recombination dynamics is investigated by transient optical-electric measurements. All devices exhibit an overall power conversion efficiency around 15%. More importantly, a biphasic trap-limited charge recombination process is proposed and interpreted by taking into account the specific charge accumulation mechanism in perovskite solar cells. At low Fermi levels, photo-generated electrons predominately populate in the perovskite phase, while at high Fermi levels, most electrons occupy traps in mesoporous TiO2. As a result, the dynamics of charge recombination is, respectively, dominated by the perovskite phase and mesoporous TiO2 in these two cases. The present work would give a new perspective on the charge recombination process in meso-structured perovskite solar cells.
Introduction
In the past few years, a novel kind of solar cell containing organic–inorganic halide perovskite (CH3NH3PbI3, MAPbI3) has triggered a wave of persistent attention because of its rapidly boosted photovoltaic performance. MAPbI3 was first adopted as a light absorber in dye sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) by Miyasaka and co-workers in 2009, which presented a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.65%.1 Later on, by introducing a solid-state hole transport material (HTM) into the perovskite-based DSSCs, not only the photovoltaic performance was significantly improved, but also the drawback of electrolyte leakage that limited the development of DSSCs was resolved.2 In 2012, Lee and co-workers reported a meso-superstructured perovskite solar cell applying insulated Al2O3 instead of mesoporous TiO2 (meso-TiO2) nanoparticles, which acted as the electron transport pathway in DSSCs.3 Their work was a milestone in isolating the perovskite-based solar cells from the conventional DSSCs. During the following years, this novel kind of solar cell has attracted considerable research efforts, and the rapid improvement of PCE to certified 20.1% was eventually achieved by compositional engineering.4,5 In practice, there are two typical configurations in perovskite solar cells fabricated by two different procedures, which are one-step made planar and two-step sequential dipping made meso-structured configurations, respectively. In the planar configuration, the perovskite active layer deposited by spin-coating a pre-mixed precursor solution (PbI2:MAI = 3:1, in moles) is sandwiched between the electron transport layer and the hole transport layer.6 While in the alternative configuration, a mesoporous scaffold is pre-infiltrated with PbI2 solution and successively dipped into MAI solution to form the perovskite active layer.7
Due to the unique and excellent physical properties of intrinsic perovskite films, such as ambipolar-transport8,9 and great light-harvesting ability,10 both planar and meso-structured perovskite solar cells exhibit outstanding photovoltaic performances. However, the limitation of the one-step made planar perovskite solar cell is pronounced which could be predominately ascribed to its rigorous deposition process to form a flat, continuous and pinhole-free perovskite layer.11,12 On the other hand, the meso-structured perovskite solar cell fabricated by a two-step method is widely investigated for its easily controlled manipulation process and the positive effect of the mesoporous scaffold on perovskite film transformation.13,14 To further improve the performance of this kind of device, numerous efforts are focused on optimizing the perovskite active layer, the most critical part in the cells, including interfacial modification for achieving a uniform film and high surface coverage15 and band-gap tuning for improvement of light harvesting.16 Meanwhile, perovskite grain size is also an important aspect that strongly correlates to the intrinsic optophysical properties,17 such as bulk defect density and charge mobility.18 Therefore, lots of studies that concentrated in controlling the grain sizes have been carried out, including modification of the deposition method,19 tuning of precursor components,20 and so on.
Along with the rapid development of the performance, large amounts of efforts have been made with the aim of unveiling the basic dynamic mechanism of the perovskite solar cells. For example, the bonding energy of electron–hole pairs in MAPbI3 is detected via temperature dependent fluorescence to be small enough for dissociation of photo-generated excitons into free charge carriers at room temperature.21 Moreover, it is found that the charge diffusion length exceeds 1 μm in the planar configuration and is approximately 130 nm in the meso-structured configuration,22,23 which guarantees valid charge collection in the corresponding electrode. By electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, a distinctive charge accumulation behaviour in perovskite is discovered, indicating that perovskite has superior ability to accommodate charge at low Fermi levels.24 Furthermore, intensity modulated photocurrent/photovoltage spectroscopy25–27 and transient photovoltage/photocurrent (TPV/TPC) measurements are applied to get a glimpse into the charge carrier recombination process. Bisquert et al.28 and O'Regan et al.29 have found that a rather slow dynamic process extending to some seconds exists in perovskite solar cells in the open circuit, which is suggested to be the dipolar relaxation or ion migration driven by the electric field. Then Park et al.30 and Listori et al.31 proposed that there are two pathways for charge recombination, and the obtained time constants τ1 and τ2 are identified as the charge carrier lifetimes of electrons in perovskite and meso-TiO2, respectively. In spite of these successful efforts, there are still questions to be answered, e.g., which pathway is the rate-determining step that dominates the recombination process, and how they eventually correlate with the PCEs.
In this work, charge recombination dynamics in meso-structured perovskite solar cells is investigated by TPV measurements. Two distinctive recombination pathways are reproduced, based on which a biphasic trap-limited charge recombination mechanism is proposed by taking into account the various proportions of charge accumulation in the perovskite phase and meso-TiO2. In addition, the effects of perovskite grain sizes on charge accumulation are also discussed.
Experimental
Materials and device fabrication
Unless otherwise stated, all materials were purchased from Alfa Aesar and used as received. TiO2 paste was purchased from NJU Sunlaite. The device fabrication process is similar to the so-called modified sequential deposition,32 and is described in the ESI.† Briefly, the FTO glass photo-anodes were sequentially coated by compact and meso-TiO2. Then the PbI2 precursor was pre-infiltrated into the meso-structured substrates before reacting with MAI solution, where the HTM was successively spin-coated after thermal annealing of the perovskite active layer. Finally, 60 nm of Au was thermally evaporated as the counter electrode. Herein, three target sample devices fabricated with MAI solution concentrations of 8, 12 and 14 mg mL−1 are named Cell-L, Cell-M and Cell-S, respectively, corresponding to the resulting large, middle and small perovskite grain sizes.
Characterization
The morphologies of the fabricated perovskite films with various grain sizes and the cross-sectional images of the cells were captured by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL-7401F). X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was conducted on a Shimadzu XRD-7000 using Cu Kα radiation in the 2θ range from 8° to 40° with a scan rate of 2° per min. Photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) measurements were obtained by exposing target cells to a standardized sun light simulator, which was calibrated by a standard silicon reference cell to AM 1.5G one sun illumination (100 mW cm−2), and sweeping over predetermined applied bias voltage from open-circuit to short-circuit without light soaking. A metal aperture mask was used to fix the active area to 0.1 cm2, and all data were acquired using a Keithley 2400 sourcemeter.
TPV measurements were conducted following a previous report.33 In brief, the tested target sample was irradiated by a continuous-wave light emitting diode (LED, 530 ± 5 nm) from the substrate side under open-circuit to generate a steady-state photovoltage (Vph). Weak laser pulses (532 nm, 7 ns) were adjusted by neutral filters, and superimposed on the steady-state light to induce a small perturbation with ΔVph/Vph ≈ 5%. Electric signals were recorded using a digital oscilloscope (64Xs, Lecroy; input impendence, 1 MΩ). By adjusting the intensity of the LED, a series of desired Vph were obtained. Fitting the decay trace of TPV with a bi-exponential function is as shown below,Vph(t) = Vbase + A1exp(−t/τ1) + A2exp(−t/τ2),where Vbase is the baseline, A1 and A2 are pre-exponential factors, and τ1 and τ2 are time constants. One can calculate the apparent recombination time constant as τn = (A1τ1 + A2τ2)/(A1 + A2).
Results and discussion
The morphology of the active layer plays a crucial role in the performance of the solar cells. The fabrication conditions, such as spinning speed/time, annealing temperature/time and precursor concentrations, would significantly influence the final structure of perovskite in the device. In our work, the only difference in the preparation of the three target cells is the MAI concentration. Fig. 1a–c show the surface SEM images of the perovskite layers, which apparently exhibit a strong dependence of perovskite grain size on the deposition condition, i.e., the MAI concentration. The lowest concentration of MAI, 8 mg mL−1, yields the largest perovskite grains (Fig. 1a), with the statistic size of ∼420 nm (Fig. 1a inset), while the middle and highest concentrations, 12 mg mL−1 and 14 mg mL−1, result in the medium and smallest perovskite grains (Fig. 1b and c), exhibiting the statistic sizes of ∼290 nm (Fig. 1b inset) and ∼210 nm (Fig. 1c inset), respectively. Additionally, as can be seen in Fig. 1, there are abundant spatial gaps between each other for the big grains, while the small grains demonstrate a close interconnection, in good agreement with a previous report.34Fig. 1d shows the XRD patterns of the perovskite films corresponding to the three target cells. A set of strong diffraction peaks, marked by asterisks, at 14.7°, 29.0° and 32.4° ascribed to (110), (220) and (310), respectively, is observed for all the samples, indicating the formation of perovskite crystal structure with good crystallinity.13 Nonetheless, a non-negligible tiny peak marked by the pound symbol at 13.2° is also presented, which implies the existence of unreacted PbI2. Several groups have demonstrated that unreacted PbI2 works as a barrier for charge transport and eventually deteriorates the photovoltaic properties.35,36 Conversely, there is also evidence that the residual PbI2 has a positive effect on the improvement of PCEs.37–40 Although the effect of unreacted PbI2 on photovoltaic performance is controversial, it seems to have no obvious influence on the device performances in this work, as shown below.

To further investigate the effect of grain size variation on photovoltaic performance, a great number of sample devices are prepared and measured to obtain the statistical averages of the photovoltaic parameters. Representative J–V curves and detailed photovoltaic parameters for statistical analysis are shown in the ESI† (Fig. S1 and Tables S1–S4). As can be seen in Fig. 2, the average JSC, VOC and FF are around 20.0 mA cm−2, 1.0 V and 0.70, respectively, consequently resulting in an average PCE of about 15% for all three sets of devices. Though the PCEs slightly decrease with the shrinkage of the grain sizes, the comparable photovoltaic performances ensure that the assumption and discussion based on these devices are reliable.

In order to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the carrier recombination process in meso-TiO2 based perovskite solar cells, TPV measurements, a prototypical technology previously used in DSSCs to study the charge recombination dynamics under different trap state filling conditions,41 were performed. Fig. 3a shows the TPV decay traces of Cell-L, and the corresponding normalized results are exhibited in the inset, in which it can be found that the decay lifetime becomes shorter as Vph increases. This can be easily understood because a large number of photo-induced carriers are accumulated at high Vph which accelerates the recombination process. To further quantitatively describe the decay process, the decay lifetime is extracted by exponential fitting of the normalized curve, and a fitting example is presented in Fig. 3b. The fitting results apparently reveal that the decay trace shows a bi-exponential behaviour rather than the mono-exponential one, implying that the carrier recombination process may contain two phases. Moreover, as displayed in Fig. 3b inset, a long-time scale tail is observed upon the semi-logarithm decay trace, indicating that there is a very slow dynamic process in TPV decay. According to previous reports,28,42 this slow process, which could last to the magnitude of second, is attributed to ferroelectric dipole polarization or dielectric relaxation. In this work, the decay lifetime is on the order of milliseconds, significantly beyond the limitation of the aforementioned effect, so the decay lifetime is identified as the carrier recombination lifetime. According to the bi-exponential fitting, two carrier lifetimes τ1 and τ2 are obtained (raw data along with coefficient weighted values are shown in Tables S5–S7, ESI†). Fig. S2 (ESI†) indicates that either τ1 or τ2 shows an identical dependency on Vph, suggesting that these two lifetimes are possibly not independent. So we calculated an apparent carrier lifetime τn (see Experimental section for details) to investigate the comprehensive effect of the two charge carrier lifetimes on charge recombination.

(b) Exponential fitting example of decay trace with a steady photovoltage of 104 mV. The inset shows the semi-logarithmic scale decay trace with a long-time scale tail. The tested sample is Cell-L. 

Fig. 4 describes the dependence of τn upon Vph (or alternatively the quasi-Fermi level). The value of τn decreases with the increase of Vph; in particular, a sharp drop in τn is observed at high voltages (Vph > 700 mV) indicating a rapid acceleration of the recombination rate. On this basis, the dependency could be divided into two regions at Vph < 700 mV (Region I) and Vph > 700 mV (Region II), respectively. In each region, a linear correlation between τn and Vph at the semi-logarithmic scale is observed, which suggests that the charge recombination process might follow the multiple-trap model. According to the concept borrowed from DSSCs, there are three typical processes in the multiple-trap model that can be mirrored by the dependency of τn on Vph. At low Fermi levels there exists an iso-energetic recombination process with an inverted parabolic dependency.43 While as the Fermi level increases, a trap-limited recombination process is reflected by a linear dependency of the τn–Vph relation. Finally, the recombination rate tends to be a fast constant, representing the trap-free carrier recombination. Differing from that classical multiple-trap model, a biphasic trap-limited recombination process represented by two distinguishing linear relationships is observed in this work. There have been several reports that aim to interpret the recombination process in perovskite solar cells. Park et al.30 and Listorti et al.31 also found that the fitted TPV decay in perovskite solar cells should be ascribed to a bi-exponential carrier recombination process, different from the mono-exponential process in DSSCs. Their studies built up the initial view of the double-pathway recombination process in meso-structured perovskite solar cells, that is, both perovskite and meso-TiO2 participate in the carrier recombination process. However, which pathway dominates the overall charge recombination process is not discussed and the data shown in these literature reports mainly focus on the high voltage region similar to Region II as we present. In addition, Zhu et al. reported that carrier recombination is correlated to the electron density in TiO2 when the Vph is beyond 500 mV.25,44 Nevertheless, data obtained at low voltage are also not shown and the function of the perovskite phase is ignored. An unabridged view of the characteristic time constant versus Vph is provided by Bisquert,28 and a biphasic correlation is also observed, which has an essentially analogous tendency with ours. Therefore, it is reasonable to conjecture that the biphasic correlation in τn and the quasi-Fermi level is a universal phenomenon, and more attention should be paid to elucidate, between the perovskite phase and meso-TiO2, which plays the dominant role in the whole recombination process. In addition, a control experiment is carried out based on a planar architecture device without a mesoporous TiO2 scaffold (details are in Fig. S3, ESI†). And only one linear region is observed indicating that the biphasic correlation is exclusive to meso-structured perovskite devices.

It is well known that the slope of the τn–Vph curve can be utilized to calculate the character energy, which represents the distribution of trap states in a multiple-trap model.45 Herein, the character energy is calculated using the following equation,  where e represents the elementary charge, kB is the Boltzmann constant, T and T0 are room temperature and character temperature, respectively. In Region I (low Fermi level) of Fig. 4, the values of character energy are 27.20 meV, 27.03 meV and 26.45 meV for Cell-L, Cell-M and Cell-S, respectively. Likewise, in Region II (high Fermi level) they are 37.34 meV, 35.66 meV and 37.86 meV. As, respectively, highlighted by blue and red lines shown in Fig. 4, the two different slopes indicate that there exist two independent trap state distributions in each device.
To further identify the two components, the differential capacitance C of the relevant device is calculated using the following equation,33  where ΔQ is extracted by integration of the intrinsic TPC signal (Fig. S4, ESI† shows a representative TPC trace and integration results) and ΔV is the amplitude of the relative TPV signal, and the active area s is set to 0.1 cm2. In order to exclude the effect of the film volume, calibration with film thickness and porosity are shown in Fig. S5 and S6 (ESI†), which exhibit no obvious impact on the tendency. The resulting C values of the cells against Vph (or alternatively on the Fermi level) are shown in Fig. 5, which clearly presents two distinct regions. At low Fermi levels (<700 mV), the platform region could be ascribed to the capacitance of perovskite according to the previous report of Kim.24 While at high Fermi levels as marked by the dashed rectangle area, C is enhanced dramatically since the electron injection into meso-TiO2 is limited by an exponential distribution of density of states (DOS).46 In general, the differential capacitance represents the chemical capacitance used to describe the charge accumulation in trap states,47 which is proportional to DOS distribution. If so, there seems the existence of self-discrepancy in trap state distribution of the perovskite phase. The character energy of the perovskite phase shows a shallow distribution, while differential capacitance results point to a deep distribution. This contradiction derives from the peculiar intrinsic properties of perovskite. Previous reports suggest that the capacitance of perovskite not only comes from trap states, but also from the dielectric and ferroelectric effects, and so on.26,28,48,49 Actually, the differential capacitance represents not the trap state distribution condition in the perovskite phase but the charge population condition. So it can be concluded that charge populates in the perovskite phase at low voltages, while in meso-TiO2 at high voltages. Correlated to the character energy results (see Fig. 4), the character energy of the perovskite phase is approximate to the thermal energy of free charge carriers at room temperature (kBTroom = 25.6 meV), which means that charge recombination in perovskite may occur from band to band and the influence of trap states on charge recombination is unremarkable. This is consistent with the first-principles density-functional theory calculations showing that defects in perovskite should be at shallow levels,50 which may be a potential rationale for the excellent charge transport properties of perovskite.51 An existing subgap state provides the possibility of shallow distribution of trap states.52 Furthermore, it is reported that defects in the perovskite layer may have influence on device performance at low light intensity with a trap concentration of 1 × 1021 m−3.53 All these reports can be clues that support the identification. On the other hand, character energy of about 36 meV is close to shallow trap states of meso-TiO2 in DSSCs,33 which might be another clue that supports the above assumption. In addition, it can be easily observed in Fig. 5 that the perovskite grain size is positively correlated to the capacitance value, which means that larger grain size leads to greater charge population ability. While the grain size barely influences the trap state distribution conditions as indicated by the character energy results. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the saltation threshold of capacitance is almost at the same point (around 700 mV) as the charge carrier lifetime, which cannot be a coincidence.

The physical model illustrated in Fig. 6 visualizes the above discussion of the results. Fig. 6a illuminates the charge distribution conditions. We hold the same view of previous reports that trap states in both the perovskite phase and meso-TiO2 participate in the charge population and recombination process, but there are different proportions between them. At low Fermi levels, photo-generated electrons predominately populate in the perovskite phase (as indicated by Fig. 5), thus electrons in the perovskite phase dominate the recombination via a trap-limited process, as depicted in Fig. 6c, which corresponds to Region I of Fig. 4. As the Fermi level rises upon a threshold around 700 mV, meso-TiO2 dominates the occupancy of electrons. An increasing number of electrons distributed in meso-TiO2 begin to play a key role in charge carrier recombination, which is described in Fig. 6b and reflected in Region II of Fig. 4.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of perovskite solar cells with various controllable grain sizes were fabricated by a sequential deposition method. The dynamic results of TPV indicate that all of the devices exhibit similar charge recombination behaviour. In particular, a biphasic trap-limited charge recombination process is proposed and illustrated by a novel physical model. It is revealed that the dynamics of charge recombination is dominated by the trap states in perovskite and meso-TiO2, at low (Vph < 700 mV) and high (Vph > 700 mV) Fermi levels, respectively. Besides, we find that the charge population condition in perovskite is influenced by the perovskite grain sizes, which implies that controlling the fabrication conditions, such as concentration of MAI, is an effective strategy to passivate the trap states in meso-structured perovskite solar cells. This work could give new insights into the recombination process in these kinds of devices and provide helpful suggestions for further improvement of the photovoltaic performance.
