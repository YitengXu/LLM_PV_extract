    , Accepted 4th July 2019First published on 5th July 2019AbstractSix wide-bandgap copolymers, i.e., PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-E, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD, were synthesized and characterized. The copolymers have identical polymer backbones in which benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and [2,2′-bithiophene]-4,4′-dicarboxylate (DCBT) units are alternatively linked, but carry different side chains. The length and bulkiness of the alkyl side chains on BDT-T or BDT and DCBT units have noticeable impacts on the photophysical properties, molecular packing structures, charge transport and photovoltaic properties of the polymers. All of these polymers possessed wide optical bandgaps in the range of 1.96–2.10 eV. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 4.03% to 8.21% were fabricated with these polymers as donors and ITIC-Th as an acceptor. The devices based on PBDTO-H with linear side chains on both BDT-T and DCBT units exhibited the best photovoltaic performance, ascribed to the high charge carrier mobility, well-ordered molecular packing and proper blend film morphology. The lowest PCE was obtained for PBDT-OD with branched long side chains, resulting from the relatively weak intermolecular π–π stacking in the film and the poor morphology with severe phase separation.
Introduction
Rapid progress has been made in polymer solar cells (PSCs) in the past few years, attributed to the combination of material development1–13 and device engineering.14–20 Since the discovery of ultrafast charge transfer between conjugated polymers and fullerenes, fullerene derivatives (such as PC61BM and PC71BM) have been the dominant acceptors. However, fullerene derivatives exhibit limited absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, and thus donor materials have to play the main role in absorbing photons in the PSC blend film. For this reason, much more effort has been devoted to the development of medium-bandgap (MBG, 1.6 < optical bandgap (Eoptg) < 1.8 eV) and low-bandgap (LBG, Eoptg < 1.6 eV) polymer donor materials in comparison to wide-bandgap (WBG, Eoptg > 1.8 eV) polymers, due to the advantage of achieving efficient absorption of solar irradiation.21,22 The PCEs of fullerene derivative based PSCs have reached 10–11% using MBG or LBG polymers.23–25
Recently, Zhan et al. developed 2-(3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-inden-1-ylidene)malononitrile and indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) combined small molecules (ITIC and its analogues),26,27 which have been demonstrated as a type of very efficient non-fullerene acceptor.28–31 The PSCs based on ITIC and its analogues have achieved high PCEs of up to 14–16%,10,32–34 largely exceeding those of the fullerene derivative based devices. Unlike traditional fullerene acceptors, these non-fullerene acceptors exhibit strong absorption bands in the long wavelength region with absorption onsets beyond 800 nm.35–38 In order to compensate the absorption of these non-fullerene acceptors, donor polymers (such as PBDB-T, J71 and FTAZ, etc.) with relatively wide bandgaps have been demonstrated to be successful in achieving high-performance non-fullerene PSCs.5,39–44 The design of WBG polymer donors is of critical importance in the further improvement of fullerene-free PSCs. Besides, WBG polymers are also useful in front sub-cells of tandem PSCs and LBG polymer based ternary PSCs to improve the absorption strength in the short wavelength region.17,45,46
For the design of ideal WBG polymer donors, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level should be fine-tuned to ensure sufficient exciton dissociation and low energy loss (Eloss) in order to simultaneously achieve high short circuit current density (Jsc) and open circuit voltage (Voc) in the devices. A number of aromatic units, such as thiophene, phenylenevinylene, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) and carbazole,47etc., have been used to construct WBG polymers, and the energy levels could be further tuned by attaching functional substituents with proper electron effects. Compared to conjugated backbones and functional substituents, less attention has been focused on side chain engineering in the design of WBG polymers.48–50 In most cases, alkyl side chains have been used to tune the solubility of polymers. In fact, the position, length and bulkiness of alkyl side chains will largely influence intermolecular interactions, molecular stacking/packing properties in the solid state, and phase separation in blend films.51–53 For example, Li et al. developed three WBG polymers (J62–J64) based on bithienylbenzodithiophene (BDT-T)-alt-fluorobenzotriazole. Their results showed that the bulkiness of the side chains (n-octyl (J62), linear unsaturated hexylene (J63) and cyclohexane (J64)) on BDT-T units had a large influence on the lamellar packing of the polymers and the phase separation of the blend films.49 Compared with J63 and J64, J62 showed moderate lamellar packing and the blend film presented a proper morphology, thus achieving superior device performance. Ade et al. synthesized four polymers (PBD1–PBD4) with different alkyl side chains on meta-alkoxy-phenyl-substituted benzodithiophene and benzodithiophene-4,8-dione building blocks.50 It was found that the alkyl chains had a substantial impact on the casting kinetics (interaction between polymer donors and solvents). PBD1 with the shortest alkyl side chain exhibited the strongest molecular aggregation, most attractive interaction with solvent additives, and the best PCE. These results suggest the essential importance of side chain engineering, especially subtle side chain modification in the design of high-performance WBG polymers.
To systematically study the effects of alkyl side chains, in this contribution, we designed and synthesized a series of polymers, i.e., PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-E, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD (as shown in Chart 1), with different side chains on BDT-T or BDT and [2,2′-bithiophene]-4,4′-dicarboxylate (DCBT) building blocks. BDT is a weak electron-donating unit and has been frequently used in semiconducting polymers due to its planar conjugated structure, ease of modification and high mobility of the polymers derived from it.54,55 Two carboxylate groups were attached onto the electron-rich backbone of bithiophene and enabled it to act as a slightly electron-deficient acceptor unit, in order to lower the HOMO energy level and thereby enhance the Voc of the PSCs while keeping the large bandgap because of the simultaneously down-shifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level.56–59 In addition, DCBT monomers can be synthesized and purified easily, compatible with mass preparation in commercial applications. In this series of polymers, PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E and PBDTEH-H share the same branched side chains (2-ethylhexyl) on the thienyl substituents of BDT-T units but have different alkyl chains (methyl, ethyl and hexyl) on DCBT. PBDTO-E and PBDTO-H possess linear alkyl (octyl) chains on the BDT-T units, and ethyl and hexyl chains on the DCBT units, respectively. For PBDT-OD based on unsubstituted BDT units, the long branched alkyl (2-octyldodecyl) side chains are introduced to DCBT units to endow the polymer with enough solubility. This allows us to study the effect of the length as well as the bulkiness of the alkyls on the properties of the polymers. These polymers displayed a wide Eoptg in the range of 1.96–2.10 eV with low-lying HOMO energy levels of −5.5 to −5.3 eV. The effect of alkyl side chains on charge mobility, film morphology, and photovoltaic properties was studied in detail. PSCs were fabricated with 3,9-bis(2-methylene-(3-(1,1-dicyanomethylene)-indanone)-5,5,11,11-tetrakis(5-hexylthiophen)-2-yl)-dithieno [2,3-d:2′,3′-d′]-s-indaceno[1,2-b:5,6-b′]-dithiophene (ITIC-Th, Fig. S1, ESI†)60 as the acceptor material to evaluate the photovoltaic performance of these polymers. PBDTO-E with short linear alkyl side chains exhibited poor solubility in common solvents, and thus no further investigation was carried out for PBDTO-E based devices. PCEs of 6.16%, 7.64%, 6.20%, 8.21% and 4.03% were obtained for PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD, respectively, with a relatively high Voc in the range of 0.89–1.05 V. Polymer PBDTO-H with linear side chains on both of the BDT-T and DCBT units achieved the best photovoltaic performance, attributed to the more ordered molecular packing and pronounced phase separation in the blend film.

Results and discussion
Material synthesis and characterization
The synthesis of the DCBT monomers and the polymers is depicted in Scheme 1, and the details of the synthesis are described in the Experimental section. Compounds 1a–1c and BDT-T- or BDT-ditin monomers were prepared following the procedure reported in the literature.61–63 Compounds 2a–2c were feasibly synthesized via a one-pot Suzuki cross-coupling reaction in yields of 82–84%. Bromination of monomers 2a–2c with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) added in portions gave monomers 3a–3c with high yields of 90–95%. A simple transesterification reaction of 3a and 2-octyl-1-dodecanol afforded compound 4 in a yield of 88%. The six polymers were synthesized via Stille cross-coupling polycondensation of compounds 3a–3c or 4 with BDT-T- or BDT-ditin monomers in high yields. The chemical structures of the intermediates and the polymers were confirmed by NMR spectra (Fig. S2–S21, ESI†) and elemental analyses.

PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD can easily dissolve in chlorinated solvents (such as chloroform, chlorobenzene and o-dichlorobenzene) at room temperature, with solubilities of 10, 25, 58, 48 and 29 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene, respectively. However, PBDTO-E with short and linear alkyl side chains was sparingly soluble in these solvents (∼2 mg mL−1 in chlorobenzene). Molecular weights were measured via high temperature gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with polystyrene as a standard and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene as a solvent at 150 °C, as listed in Table 1. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) of PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-E, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD is 52.4, 76.9, 51.2, 60.3, 81.0 and 47.9 kDa with corresponding molar mass dispersity (Đ) values of 3.22, 2.25, 2.22, 2.72, 1.75 and 2.56, respectively. The thermal properties of the six polymers were studied via thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Fig. S22 (ESI†). All polymers exhibited good thermal stability with a 5% weight loss temperature (Td) over 390 °C, and no obvious thermal transitions were observed from room temperature to 300 °C. Due to the limited solubility, only the thermal stability, and photophysical and electrochemical properties were studied for polymer PBDTO-E.

Photophysical and electrochemical properties
The solution absorption spectra measured at different temperatures and thin film absorption spectra of the six polymers are presented in Fig. 1a–g, and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. In solution (Fig. 1a–f), when the temperature was elevated from 30 to 90 °C, the maximum absorption peak gradually blue-shifted and the maximum absorption coefficient decreased, indicating disaggregation of the polymers at higher temperatures. During the heating process, the solution absorption of PBDTEH-M, PBDTO-E and PBDT-OD displayed an obvious blue-shift, while PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H and PBDTO-H presented a slightly blue-shifted absorption. This signifies that PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H and PBDTO-H possessed weak aggregation behavior in solution. PBDTO-E with short linear alkyl side-chains showed strong absorption shoulder peaks even in solution at 90 °C, indicative of the strong aggregation ability of the polymer backbones. Going from solution to film (Fig. 1g), obviously red-shifted absorption spectra were observed for PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD, caused by enhanced intermolecular interactions in the solid state. The film absorption spectra of PBDTEH-M and PBDTO-E resembled the solution absorption spectra at 30 °C, also implying that intense aggregation existed in solution at that temperature. The PBDT-OD film exhibited the lowest maximum absorption coefficient (∼6 × 104 cm−1) among these polymer films (7–8 × 104 cm−1 for the other polymers), which is unfavourable for the efficient utilization of solar energy. The Eoptg extracted from the film absorption onset is 1.96 eV for PBDTEH-M, 1.98 eV for PBDTEH-E, 2.00 eV for PBDTEH-H, 2.02 eV for PBDTO-E, 1.98 eV for PBDTO-H and 2.10 eV for PBDT-OD. The slightly wider optical bandgap of PBDT-OD could be derived from its lower HOMO energy level, as discussed below. Obviously, the absorption spectra of these polymers are complementary with that of ITIC-Th, which is beneficial for light harvesting and achieving a high Jsc.
 Fig. 1  Temperature-dependent solution absorption spectra of PBDTEH-M (a), PBDTEH-E (b), PBDTEH-H (c), PBDTO-E (d), PBDTO-H (e) and PBDT-OD (f), thin film absorption spectra (g), and the schematic energy level diagram (h) of the six polymers. 
Thin film electrochemical cyclic voltammetry (CV) was employed to evaluate the energy levels of these polymers. The potentials were internally calibrated using the ferrocene/ferrocenium (Fc/Fc+) redox couple (4.8 eV below the vacuum level). The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymers were calculated from the redox onset potentials. As shown in Fig. S23 (ESI†) and Table 1, the LUMO energy levels of PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-E, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD were estimated as −3.01, −2.96, −2.99, −2.95, −2.93, and −2.93 eV, respectively, and the HOMO energy levels were −5.37, −5.43, −5.47, −5.32, −5.45, and −5.52 eV, respectively. Compared to PBDTEH-M and PBDTO-E, the down-shifted HOMO energy levels of PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H and PBDTO-H might be caused by the weak intermolecular interactions due to the steric hindrance effect of the bulky side chains on the polymer main chain. Besides, the HOMO energy level of PBDT-OD was lower than those of the other four polymers, probably resulting from the weaker electron-donating ability of the unsubstituted BDT in comparison to the BDT-T units. Note that the electrochemical bandgaps (Ecvgs) of these polymers are ca. 0.35–0.55 eV larger than the Eoptgs. This phenomenon is often observed and can be explained by the exciton binding energy (in the range of ∼0.4–1.0 eV) of the conjugated polymers.64,65
Molecular packing and hole transport properties
The molecular packing and orientation of PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD in neat films were characterized by in-plane and out-of-plane X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Fig. S24, ESI†). For the five polymers, the (100) diffraction peaks were observed in both the in-plane and out-of-plane patterns, while (010) peaks were only observed in the out-of-plane patterns. This indicates that the polymer backbones preferred to adopt a face-on alignment on the substrate, which is favourable to charge transport in PSCs. As the length of the alkyl side chain increased, a larger lamellar d-spacing was observed. PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD showed lamellar d-spacings of 20.3, 21.3, 21.7, 24.8 and 25.9 Å, respectively. PBDT-OD with 2-octyldodecyl substituted DCBT units exhibited the largest lamellar d-spacing due to its long alkyl side chains. The π–π stacking distances of PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD were 3.64, 3.69, 3.70, 3.60 and 3.70 Å, respectively, as calculated from the (010) diffractions. Compared to PBDTEH-M with methyl on DCBT and PBDTEH-H with hexyl on DCBT, PBDTEH-E based on ethyl with moderate length on the DCBT unit exhibited more ordered intermolecular π–π stacking, as revealed by the more intense (010) diffraction peak. The strongest (010) diffraction peak and smallest π–π stacking distance were observed for PBDTO-H, attributed to the small steric hindrance of the linear side chains.
The hole mobility of the polymers was measured by using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method with a device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS, 30 nm)/polymer film (∼100 nm)/Au (100 nm) (Fig. S25 and Table S1, ESI†). The hole mobilities were 1.04 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTEH-M, 1.10 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTEH-E, 0.90 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTEH-H, 1.29 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTO-H and 0.79 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDT-OD. After thermal annealing at 150 °C, the hole mobilities of PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD films were enhanced to 1.75 × 10−5, 1.82 × 10−5, 1.70 × 10−5, 2.61 × 10−5 and 0.98 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The relatively superior hole transport property of PBDTO-H is attributed to its ordered and close π–π stacking.
Photovoltaic properties
The fullerene-free solar cells with PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H or PBDT-OD as donor and ITIC-Th as acceptor were fabricated with an architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (30 nm)/active layer (∼100 nm)/PDINO (10 nm)/Al (100 nm), where PDINO is an electron-transporting material (see Fig. S26, ESI†) developed by Li et al.66 The detailed device data obtained under different fabrication conditions, including donor/acceptor weight ratios, active layer thicknesses, solvent additives and post treatments, are outlined in Tables S2–S5 (ESI†). The optimized devices were fabricated using chlorobenzene as a processing solvent with a donor/acceptor weight ratio of 1:1 and an active-layer thickness of ∼100 nm. The typical current density–voltage (J–V) curves of the devices are shown in Fig. 2a, and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters are listed in Table 2. Without any additive and post-treatment, the PSCs based on PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H and PBDTO-H displayed PCEs of ∼3% with a Jsc of ∼10 mA cm−2 and fill factors (FFs) of ∼0.3. The device based on PBDT-OD showed a much lower PCE of 1.88%, derived from its pretty low Jsc (4.22 mA cm−2). All the PSCs exhibited high Voc values in the range of 0.89–1.05 V, which benefited from the low-lying HOMO energy levels of these polymer donors. The Voc values of these devices follow the order of PBDTEH-M < PBDTEH-E, PBDTO-H < PBDTEH-H, PBDT-OD, which is consistent with the HOMO energy levels of these polymer donors. Solvent additive 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and thermal annealing (TA) were used to promote the photovoltaic performance of these polymers. Compared to the untreated devices, all of the optimized devices showed improvement in Jsc and FF, and a slight drop in Voc. The PCEs of the optimized PSCs based on PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD increased to 6.16%, 7.64%, 6.20%, 8.21% and 4.03%, respectively. The PSCs based on PBDTEH-E with the ethyl substituted DCBT unit exhibited a higher PCE of 7.64% as well as a higher Jsc (14.29 mA cm−2) and FF (58.2%), compared to the devices based on PBDTEH-M and PBDTEH-H, which have the same side chains on BDT-T units as PBDTEH-E but shorter or longer alkyl chains on DCBT. The best photovoltaic performance was achieved for the PBDTO-H based device with a Voc of 0.94, a Jsc of 14.82 mA cm−2, a FF of 59.4% and a PCE of 8.21%. The inferior PCE of the PBDT-OD based device corresponded with its much lower Jsc (8.94 mA cm−2) and FF (43.2%), which could be due to the low charge mobility and poor morphology (as discussed below) as well as the relatively weak absorption (as aforementioned). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the optimized devices are shown in Fig. 2b. The PSC devices based on the polymers exhibited a broad response from 300 to 780 nm, which was derived from the complementary absorptions of the WBG polymer donors and the ITIC-Th acceptor. Compared to devices based on PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H and PBDTO-H with the maximum EQE values reaching 70%, 67%, 65% and 61%, respectively, the PBDT-OD based device displayed a much lower EQE over the entire photocurrent response range, in accordance with its lower Jsc observed in the J–V curves. The Jsc values integrated from the EQE curves were 13.61, 14.26, 13.99, 14.90 and 9.01 mA cm−2 for PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD, respectively, consistent with those obtained from the J–V curves within an acceptable deviation of ∼5%.

To gain more insights into the photovoltaic performance of PSC devices based on the polymers, the effective voltage (Veff) dependent photocurrent density (Jph) was measured, as shown in Fig. 2c. With increasing Veff, the Jph of the PBDTEH-E and PBDTO-H-based devices reached a saturated value (saturation photocurrent density, Jsat) earlier than those of the devices based on the other polymers. Under the short-circuit conditions, the ratios of Jph/Jsat were 94%, 95%, 94%, 96% and 82% for the devices based on PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD, respectively. Under the maximal power output conditions, the PBDTEH-E and PBDTO-H based devices still presented high Jph/Jsat ratios of 88% and 91%, respectively, while the ratios for PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-H and PBDT-OD based devices dropped to 77%, 73% and 76%, respectively. This indicates that exciton dissociation and charge collection were more efficient for PBDTEH-E and PBDTO-H based PSCs. Moreover, the hole and electron mobilities (μh and μe) of the blend films were measured using the SCLC method, and the results are shown in Fig. S27 and Table S6 (ESI†). Without DIO and TA treatment, μh and μe were 1.56 × 10−5 and 0.26 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTEH-M:ITIC-Th, 3.38 × 10−5 and 1.01 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTEH-E:ITIC-Th, 2.82 × 10−5 and 0.67 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTEH-H:ITIC-Th, 6.65 × 10−5 and 1.42 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th, and 1.28 × 10−5 and 0.21 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PBDT-OD:ITIC-Th, respectively. Under the optimized conditions, the μh and μe of the blend films significantly increased, and the PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th blend film presented the highest μh and μe of 1.9 × 10−4 and 3.60 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively, ascribed to the ordered π–π stacking of the polymer backbones and the proper film morphology as discussed below. The PBDT-OD:ITIC-Th blend film exhibited a low μh (3.75 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1) and μe (1.03 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1), which was responsible for the poor Jsc and FF of the PSC. The unbalanced hole and electron transport observed in all the blend films could be a reason for the overall low FFs of these PSCs.
Film microstructures and morphology
The morphology of the blend films was investigated by using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). As shown in Fig. S28 (ESI†) and Fig. 3, all the polymer:ITIC-Th blend films were smooth and uniform. Without any post-treatment (Fig. S28, ESI†), PBDTEH-M:ITIC-Th, PBDTEH-E:ITIC-Th, PBDTEH-H:ITIC-Th, PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th and PBDT-OD:ITIC-Th blend films showed root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values of 0.949, 0.816, 0.612, 0.716 and 1.08 nm, respectively. Under the optimized conditions (Fig. 3a–e), RMS roughness of the blend films slightly increased to 0.972 nm for PBDTEH-M:ITIC-Th, 0.840 nm for PBDTEH-E:ITIC-Th, 0.766 nm for PBDTEH-H:ITIC-Th, 1.06 nm for PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th, and 2.54 nm for PBDT-OD:ITIC-Th. As can be seen from the AFM phase images, the optimized blend films (Fig. 3f–j) exhibited more pronounced phase separation compared with the pristine blend films (Fig. S28, ESI†), which was beneficial for charge carrier transport. Small aggregates with a size of ∼20 nm were observed in PBDTEH-M:ITIC-Th, which could induce less efficient charge transport. In the PBDTEH-H:ITIC-Th blend film, there was a lack of distinct phase separation of the donor and the acceptor. The PBDT-OD:ITIC-Th blend film exhibited severe phase separation with large cluster sizes of 100–200 nm. Such a morphology is unfavourable for exciton diffusion and dissociation, leading to the low Jsc of the PSC device. PBDTEH-E:ITIC-Th and PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th blend films presented the desired morphology with fibril-like nano-structures and interpenetrating networks of donor and acceptor phases, and finer fibrils of several nanometers in width were observed in the PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th film. This is correlated to the high photovoltaic performance of the PBDTO-H based devices.

The microstructures of the polymer:ITIC-Th blend films were also characterized by in-plane and out-of-plane XRD, as shown in Fig. 4. Compared to the pristine blend films, the blend films under the optimized conditions exhibited stronger diffraction in both in-plane and out-of-plane XRD patterns, indicative of improved crystallinity. PBDTEH-E:ITIC-Th, PBDTEH-H:ITIC-Th, PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th and PBDT-OD:ITIC-Th blend films presented pronounced (100) diffraction peaks due to the lamellar packing of the polymers at 2θ = 3.70–4.55° in the in-plane and out-of-plane patterns. For the PBDTEH-M:ITIC-Th blend film, a weak (100) diffraction peak from the polymer only existed in the out-of-plane pattern at 2θ = ∼4.90°. The lamellar d-spacings of PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD were ∼18.0, ∼19.4, 21.4, 22.9, and 23.8 Å, respectively, obtained from the out-of-plane XRD patterns. The largest lamellar d-spacing of PBDT-OD was derived from the long alkyl side chains, in accordance with the XRD data of the neat polymer films. In the out-of-plane XRD patterns, all the blend films displayed obvious (100) diffraction peaks at 2θ = ∼6.60°, which were ascribed to ITIC-Th lamellar packing according to the XRD patterns of the neat ITIC-Th film (Fig. S27, ESI†), corresponding to d-spacings of ∼13.4 Å. In addition, obvious (100) diffractions at 2θ = ∼6.60°, (200) diffractions at 2θ = ∼13.2° and other fine diffraction peaks derived from ITIC-Th appeared in the in-plane XRD patterns of PBDTEH-E:ITIC-Th and PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th blend films, suggesting the highly ordered molecular packing of ITIC-Th. The PBDTO-H:ITIC-Th blend film delivered the most intense (010) diffraction peak (2θ = ∼23.4°) in the out-of-plane pattern, which is beneficial for charge transport in the PSCs. PBDTEH-H:ITIC-Th and PBDT-OD:ITIC-Th blend films presented a relatively weak (010) diffraction peak in comparison to the other blend films, probably due to the introduction of bulky side chains.

Conclusion
In summary, we designed and synthesized a series of WBG polymers, i.e., PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E, PBDTEH-H, PBDTO-E, PBDTO-H and PBDT-OD, with different side chains on DCBT and BDT-T (or BDT) units. The polymers exhibited wide optical bandgaps in the range of 1.96–2.10 eV, and deep HOMO energy levels of −5.32 to −5.52 eV. The modification of side chains has profound effects on the polymer aggregation behaviour, molecular packing properties, and the blend film morphology, which are closely related to their charge transport properties and photovoltaic performance. Owing to the deep HOMO energy levels of these polymers, a high Voc from 0.89 to 1.04 V was obtained for the PSCs. Compared to PBDTEH-M and PBDTEH-H, PBDTEH-E with medium-length alkyl chains (ethyl) on DCBT presented the more ordered intermolecular stacking. Meanwhile, moderate phase separation was observed for the PBDTEH-E based blend film. As a result, PBDTEH-E achieved a higher PCE (7.64%) than those of PBDTEH-M (6.16%) and PBDTEH-H (6.20%). PBDTO-E with short linear alkyl side chains possessed strong aggregation behavior in solution and thus poor solubility in common chlorinated solvents. PBDTO-H with suitable linear side chains on both BDT-T and DCBT units presented more ordered microstructures and closer π–π stacking in comparison to the polymers with branched alkyl chains on BDT-T units (PBDTEH-M, PBDTEH-E and PBDTEH-H). Furthermore, the PBDTO-H based blend film presented superior morphology with fiber-like nano-structures and good interpenetrating networks, leading to the best device performance with a PCE of 8.21%. In contrast, the blend film based on PBDT-OD with bulky side chains on DCBT units presented a low charge carrier mobility caused by the relatively weak intermolecular π–π stacking and the poor blend film morphology with excessive phase separation. Thus, the device based on PBDT-OD gave an inferior PCE of 4.03% with a low Jsc and FF. This work demonstrates the importance of precise side chain engineering in designing high-performance organic photovoltaic materials, and provides insight into structure–property relationships, contributing to the rational design of new WBG polymers for fullerene-free PSCs.
