    , Accepted 24th March 2017First published on 30th March 2017AbstractIn this work, an outer-to-inner strategy is demonstrated to simultaneously fabricate core–shell NPs and assemble them onto a scaffold. Specifically, the shell material is deposited onto the scaffold first, and then a layer of the core material (Au) is covered on the shell surface. Finally, the core (Au)–shell nanoparticles (NPs) are formed on the scaffold after annealing. As examples, Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe core–shell NPs are grown on the surface of ZnO nanorods (NRs) via this strategy and exhibit enhanced photoelectrochemical (PEC) efficiency. The enhanced PEC performance is ascribed to improved light absorption induced by the plasmonic effect, trapped electrons of Au NPs, and cascade band alignment of the shell material and ZnO. The synthetic method gives a universal route to the development of nanodevices with assembled core–shell NPs. The core–shell NPs in the current study possess significant potential as building blocks for future PEC anodes or other solar conversion systems.
1. Introduction
Core–shell nanoparticles (NPs) have had a high profile as unique building blocks for broad applications in physics, chemistry, biology and many other areas over the past two decades.1–5 Among these applications, solar-to-hydrogen conversion attracts great attention due to its vital role in confronting the challenges of energy crisis, environmental quality and climate change.6–10 Various core–shell NPs have been synthesized and have demonstrated enhanced photoconversion efficiency. For example, Tedsree et al. confirmed that hydrogen production from formic acid decomposition at room temperature could be improved by using a Ag–Pd core–shell nanocatalyst.11 Wu's group found that Ag–Cu2O core–shell NPs can serve as efficient visible-light plasmonic photocatalysts.12 Nong et al. explored IrOx core–shell nanocatalysts for cost- and energy-efficient electrochemical water splitting.13 All these studies reveal that for core–shell NPs, whether metal–metal, metal–semiconductor, or semiconductor–semiconductor, their large surface areas and hetero-materials are extremely conducive to improving solar absorption and depressing electron–hole recombination, thereby leading to efficient solar-to-hydrogen conversion. Along with these in-depth studies on the solar energy conversion of core–shell NPs, researchers have realized that the synthetic strategies used are very important to control the geometries of the core–shell NPs and their photoconversion efficiencies. Using metal–semiconductor core–shell NPs as an example, Ag–Cu2O,12 Ag–TiO2,14 Rh–Cr2O3,15 and Au–CdS,16 among others, have demonstrated highly enhanced photocatalytic or photoelectrochemical (PEC) efficiency. To date, most of the core–shell NPs could be fabricated via a conventional inner-to-outer strategy: the core is constructed first, and then the shell is wrapped around the core. Using this technique, if we try to join these types of core–shell NPs with other structures, we must “glue” the formed NPs and other structures together, leading to an overall complicated fabrication. Therefore, a new synthesis strategy should be developed, such as this unconventional outer-to-inner process.
In this work, we demonstrate an outer-to-inner synthesis strategy to facilitate the core (Au)–shell NPs “grown” on the surface of scaffold structures instead of “gluing” them together. Briefly, the semiconductor shell-material with a narrow band gap first covers the scaffold, and then a layer of Au is deposited onto the surface of the shell material. Finally, the Au–semiconductor core–shell NPs are formed on the surface of the scaffold via annealing. With the increasing temperature during annealing, the Au NPs are formed first due to agglomeration, and then the semiconductor is partly sublimated and attaches onto the surface of the Au NPs to complete the formation of the Au–semiconductor core–shell NPs. It is a universal synthesis strategy as long as a single condition is satisfied: the melting point of the photosensitive semiconductor must be lower than that of the scaffold material. Here, arrays of ZnO nanorods (NRs) are selected as the scaffold material, while Bi2S3, CdS and CdSe, with narrow band gaps, are selected as shell materials due to their lower melting points than that of ZnO (Table 1). For these ZnO NR-supported core–shell NPs, the narrow band gaps of the shell materials could facilitate visible light absorption, and the Au cores can serve as electron traps to promote electron–hole separation. The ZnO NRs can be employed as scaffolds to support the core–shell NPs and provide an efficient charge transfer path, leading to highly efficient photoconversion. Therefore, Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe NPs were synthesized on the surface of ZnO NRs via the outer-to-inner strategy and demonstrated enhanced PEC efficiency under white light illumination. The synthesis mechanism and PEC enhancement of the ZnO NR-lifted core (Au)–shell NPs are discussed in detail in the following text. Objectively, the core–shell NPs proposed in the current study possess significant potential as building blocks for future PEC anodes or other solar conversion systems. Moreover, our unique synthesis method is not limited to the core–shell materials presented in the current work; various other core–shell NPs can be efficiently accessed via this synthesis strategy. It provides a general path to the development of nanodevices with assembled core–shell NPs.

2. Experimental section
2.1 Fabrication
(1) ZnO nanorods (NRs): Arrays of ZnO NRs were grown on FTO glass using a seed-assisted hydrothermal method. First, the ZnO seed layer was deposited uniformly on the native FTO glass substrate with the aid of radio frequency (RF) magnetron sputtering. The seeded FTO glass was then dipped into a mixed electrolyte consisting of hexamethylenetetramine (Sigma-Aldrich, HMTA, 20 mM) and zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Sigma-Aldrich, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, 20 mM]. The deposition process typically lasted 12 h at 90 °C. (2) Bi2S3 layer: A Bi2S3 nanolayer was coated onto the ZnO NRs via the successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) method. Typically, the ZnO NRs were successively immersed in two different solutions for 20 s, one containing Bi3+ cations [10 mM Bi(NO3)3 in ethylene glycol] and the other containing S2− anions [10 mM Na2S in de-ionized (DI) water]. Between each immersion step, the samples were sequentially rinsed with acetone and DI water for 20 s to remove excess ions that were weakly bound to the nanowire surfaces. This immersion cycle was repeated for up to 120 cycles; after finishing the coating, the samples were dried by N2 blowing. (3) CdS layer: A CdS nanolayer was also coated on the ZnO NRs via the SILAR method. The two aqueous solutions contained 50 mM Cd(NO3)2 and 50 mM Na2S. Between each immersion step, the samples were rinsed only with DI water for 20 s. The other steps were similar to those used for preparing Bi2S3. (4) CdSe layer: A CdSe nanolayer was coated onto the ZnO NRs via chemical bath deposition (CBD), which was performed by immersing the FTO glass substrate with the ZnO NRs in an aqueous solution of Cd(CH3COO)2 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1.5 mM), Na2SeSO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 1.5 mM), and NH4OH (Sigma-Aldrich, 45 mM). The typical deposition time for the CdSe nanolayer was 5 h at 95 °C. (5) Au decoration: HAuCl4 (Sigma-Aldrich, 0.005 M) solution was dropped onto the samples at 10 drops per cm2. Next, the samples were dried by heating to 120 °C for 20 h and cleaned in DI water several times. (6) Core (Au)–shell NPs: Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe NPs were formed by annealing at 520, 580 and 480 °C, respectively, for half an hour with the protection of N2 gas. The temperature rose 10 °C every minute.
2.2 Characterization
The morphologies of the prepared nanostructures were confirmed using a high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope (HR-STEM; JEM-2200FS with Image Cs-corrector; JEOL) operated with a 200 kV beam energy.
2.3 Measurements
(1) The optical absorbance of the samples was analyzed using a UV2501PC (Shimadzu) spectrometer with an ISR-2200 integrating sphere attachment for diffuse reflection measurements. (2) X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was performed using an ESCALAB250 instrument (VG Scientific Company, USA) with Al Kα radiation as the excitation source. (3) Fluorescence lifetime decays were measured using an inverted-type scanning confocal microscope (MicroTime-200, Picoquant, Germany) with a 20× objective. The measurements were performed at the Korea Basic Science Institute (KBSI), Daegu Center, South Korea. A 470 nm single-mode pulsed diode laser (∼100 ps pulse width at a 5–20 MHz repetition rate) was used as the excitation source. A dichroic mirror (490 DCXR, AHF), a long-pass filter (HQ500lp, AHF), and a single photon avalanche diode (PDM series, MPD) were used to collect the emissions from the perovskite samples through a 700 nm long-pass filter. The time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) technique was used to obtain the fluorescence decay as a function of time. Exponential fittings for the obtained fluorescence decays were performed using the Symphotime software (version 5.3). (4) Photocurrent–voltage (J–V) measurements, EIS and electron lifetime tests were performed using a typical three-electrode potentiostat system (potentiostat/galvanostat, model 263A, EG&G Princeton Applied Research) with a Pt counter electrode and a saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE). The electrolyte was an aqueous solution of 0.25 M Na2S and 0.35 M Na2SO3, through which nitrogen was bubbled. The working electrode was illuminated from the front with a solar simulator (AM 1.5 G filtered, 100 mW cm−2, 91160, Oriel).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphologies and growth mechanism

Fig. 1a presents a sketch of the Au–Bi2S3 core–shell NPs grown on the ZnO NRs. Both the Au NPs and ZnO NRs are covered with Bi2S3. The TEM image in Fig. 1b shows that the Au–Bi2S3 NPs are evenly and tightly distributed on the surface of the ZnO NR. The diameter of the Au core and the thickness of the Bi2S3 shell in Fig. 1c are measured as ∼9.5 and ∼3.0 nm, respectively. Taken from the red and yellow rectangles in Fig. 1c, the high resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of Fig. 1d and e exhibit the (211) and (111) crystal planes for Bi2S324 and Au,25 respectively, revealing their highly crystalline properties. EELS element mapping in Fig. 1f–h demonstrates that Au, Bi and S are evenly and accurately located on their respective positions. The observations in Fig. 1 indicate that the outer-to-inner strategy was efficient for the growth of core–shell NPs on the scaffold of ZnO NRs. Furthermore, ESI part 1† confirms that the size of Au–Bi2S3 core–shell NPs is not very uniform and several larger NPs exist on the ZnO NRs.

To visually show the outer-to-inner synthesis method, the synthetic process is sketched in Fig. 2a. At the initial step, the ZnO NR is covered with Bi2S3, and then the Au layer is deposited on the surface of Bi2S3 to form a sandwich structure. Not only for Bi2S3, when the ZnO NRs are decorated with CdS or CdSe, the surfaces of CdS and CdSe are also covered with a layer of Au (see ESI part 2†). The observations in ESI part 2† demonstrate that high density ZnO NRs with uniform diameters are evenly distributed on the substrate, and that Bi2S3, CdS and CdSe with highly crystalline structures are decorated on the ZnO NRs and covered by an outer Au layer with uniform thickness. For the second step, with increasing temperature, the Au layer is agglomerated to form many NPs. At the final step, the sublimated Bi2S3 adheres on the surface of the Au NPs, and Au–Bi2S3 core–shell NPs are produced as a result. TEM images for the samples during the first and second steps are exhibited in Fig. 2b and d, respectively. Both images confirm that the ZnO NRs are highly useful as a scaffold to support Au and Bi2S3. Taken from the white rectangles of Fig. 2b and d, the enlarged views demonstrate the Au thin-layer (Fig. 2c) and NP morphologies for steps 1 and 2, respectively.

The scale bars of (b–e) are 100, 5, 50 and 5 nm, respectively. 
The Bi2S3 could be replaced by CdS or CdSe. Via the same synthesis strategy, both Au–CdS and Au–CdSe core–shell NPs were fabricated. The TEM image of Fig. 3a shows that the high-yield Au–CdS NPs are evenly distributed on the surface of ZnO NRs. Taken from the red circle of Fig. 3a, the HRTEM in Fig. 3b reveals the crystalline structures of Au and CdS. The lattice fringe spacings are 0.23 and 0.33 nm, indicating the (111) planes of Au and CdS,26 respectively. Captured from the red square of Fig. 3a, the element mapping in Fig. 3c–e confirms that Cd and S are evenly distributed on the surface of Au. For Au–CdSe core–shell NPs, the TEM image in Fig. 4a and the enlarged view in Fig. 4b also confirm the core–shell NPs and their even distributions on ZnO NRs. Taken from Fig. 4b, the HRTEM images in Fig. 4c and d reveal the (111) planes of Au and the (100) planes of CdSe,27 respectively. Element mapping from Fig. 4e re-demonstrates that the NP is constructed from an Au core and a CdSe shell. All of the above morphological analysis results of Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe core–shell NPs indicate that the core–shell NPs are evenly distributed on the ZnO NRs [see ESI part 3†]. Here, the annealing temperature is a very important factor for determining the synthesis of core–shell NPs. SEM images in ESI part 4† confirm that Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe core–shell NPs are gradually evolved from layered structures with the annealing temperature increasing until 520, 580 and 480 °C, respectively. If the temperature is further increased, the core–shell NPs are removed from ZnO NRs, which is probably due to evaporation. Moreover, apart from formation on ZnO NRs, the Au–Bi2S3 and Au–CdS core–shell NPs could also be formed on ZnO films (see ESI part 5†), demonstrating that the synthetic route is a universal method extensible to other shell-materials, and to other shapes of scaffolds.

In addition to the morphological observations, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried out to further study the chemical binding states of the synthesized materials. For Au–Bi2S3 core–shell NPs, Bi 4f and S 2p are collected together in Fig. 5a due to their close binding energy. Via deconvolution of the XPS peak, it can be seen that the Bi 4f spectra consist of only two sub-peaks, due to spin–orbit coupling, at 165.5 and 159.7 eV, corresponding to the 4f5/2 and 4f7/2 states of the Bi–S bond, respectively.28,29 Similarly, the S 2p spectra also only possess two sub-peaks at 165.1 eV and 164.6 eV, corresponding to the 2p1/2 and 2p3/2 states of the S–Bi bond, respectively.30 To clearly discriminate between Bi and S, Bi 4d peaks in the XPS spectrum are shown in ESI part 6.†Via deconvolution of the XPS peak, it can be seen from Fig. S5† that the Bi 4d spectra have two peaks at 165.5 and 159.7 eV, corresponding to the 4d3/2 and 4d5/2 states of the Bi–S bond, respectively. Fig. 5a and S6† together demonstrate that there are no other Bi- or S-based compounds except Bi2S3 in the core–shell structures. For Au–CdS core–shell NPs, the Cd 3d and S 2p spectra are listed in the left and right columns of Fig. 5b, respectively. The left column shows that the Cd 3d spectra consist of two sub-peaks due to spin–orbit coupling at 405 and 411.7 eV, corresponding to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states of CdS, respectively.31 In the right column, the S 2p spectra could be separated into three groups via deconvolution. The first 2p-spectra group consists of 2p1/2 at 162.9 eV and 2p3/2 at 159.7 eV, corresponding to the Cd–S bond; the second group consists of 2p′1/2 at 165.0 eV and 2p′3/2 at 161.6 eV, corresponding to the Cd–S–O bond; the third group S 2p′′ around ∼170 eV is related to the Cd–S–O4 bond.32 Finally, for Au–CdSe core–shell NPs, the Cd 3d spectra also have two sub-peaks at 405 and 411.7 eV, corresponding to the 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 states of CdSe, respectively; for Se 3d, the sub-peaks corresponding to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 appeared at 54.1 and 54.9 eV, respectively, which represent the Se2− state, indicating the formation of CdSe.33 The XPS measurements confirm that both Au–Bi2S3 and Au–CdSe NPs contain almost pure Bi2S3 and CdSe shell materials and that although the Au–CdS NPs are slightly oxidized, CdSOx can be dissolved in water, so it shows little effect on the PEC enhancement. Moreover, X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra in ESI part 7† also demonstrate that the Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe core–shell NPs have highly crystalline structures, which are highly useful properties required for PEC enhancement.

3.2 PEC enhancement
To obtain enhanced PEC efficiency in this work, the light absorptions of the core–shell NPs under illumination of different wavelengths should be evaluated. Therefore, the light absorbances of ZnO NRs covered with a layered shell material and Au before annealing and NRs covered with core (Au)–shell NPs after annealing were selected and are compared in Fig. 6. These two different samples before and after annealing are simplified as “Layer” and “C.-S.” in Fig. 6, respectively. For Au–Bi2S3, both the layered (black curve) and core–shell structures (red curve) have enhanced light absorption ranging from the UV region to wavelengths of nearly 800 nm (Fig. 6a). To clearly show their differences, the absorbance difference curve between the layered and core–shell structures is shown in Fig. 6b. After annealing, the light absorption of the Au–Bi2S3 core–shell structure is enhanced over the wavelength range centered at 650 nm, while it is degraded from approximately 400–500 nm. It is well known that nanoscale Au has enhanced light absorption at approximately 550 nm.34 For our Au–Bi2S3 samples, the thickness of the Au layer is approximately 2 nm (Fig. 2c), while the diameter of the Au core is approximately 10 nm (Fig. 1c). Schaub et al. also found that the light absorption of Au increases at approximately 600 nm and decreases at approximately 500 nm when its size changes from 2 to 10 nm.35 They explained that the shift of the absorption peak can be induced by the coupling of the electromagnetic field between surface plasmons excited in Au nanoparticles of different densities and sizes. In our case, for the layered structure, the Au layer almost fully covers Bi2S3 and could reduce the light penetration, leading to the plasmonic effect between Au and Au being higher than that between Au and Bi2S3. For core–shell structures, all of the Au NPs are covered with Bi2S3; as a result, the plasmonic effect is dominated by the interaction between Au and Bi2S3. Moreover, our previous calculation confirmed that the light absorption induced by the plasmonic effect between Au and Au has a shorter wavelength than that between Au and semiconductors.36 Therefore, the red-shift of the light absorption is ascribed to the plasmonic effect changing from the Au–Au interaction to the Au–Bi2S3 interaction.
 Fig. 6  (a, c and e) Light absorbance curves of the layered (black) and core–shell (red) structures made of Au–Bi2S3 (a), Au–CdS (c) and Au–CdSe (e); (b, d and f) differences in the light absorbance values between the core–shell and layered structures of Au–Bi2S3 (b), Au–CdS (d) and Au–CdSe (f). 
For Au–CdS, Fig. 6c shows that both layered and core–shell structures have enhanced light absorption from the UV to the visible region and have a clear decrease at approximately 500 nm, corresponding to the boundary for light absorption of CdS. The absorbance difference curve between the layered and core–shell structures in Fig. 6d reveals that the light absorption of the core–shell structure is slightly enhanced over the wavelength range centered at 500–600 nm. Considering the above analysis for the light absorption of Au–Bi2S3 structures, we know that this light enhancement is caused by the plasmonic effect between Au and CdS. However, the light absorption does not degrade at approximately 550–600 nm. This indicates that the plasmonic effect between Au and Au is not eliminated for core–shell structures. It can be seen from Fig. 3a that although most Au cores are smaller, there are many bigger Au cores covered with a very thin CdS layer. As a result, the gap between the adjacent cores is very small, and the plasmonic effect between Au and Au is still effective. For Au–CdSe, Fig. 6e shows that the enhanced light absorptions of layered and core–shell structures are also covered from the UV to the visible region because of the narrow band gap of 1.7 eV of CdSe. Similar to Fig. 6d, the enhanced light absorption of the core–shell structure only covers the wavelength range centered at 500–600 nm, ascribed to the plasmonic effect between Au and CdSe strengthening, while that between Au and Au does not weaken.
The overall PEC process can be divided into several steps, such as light absorption and conversion, migration of photogenerated charge carriers and charge transfer at electrolytes. Therefore, after light absorption, the electron lifetime is another crucial parameter used to determine the PEC performance of photoelectrodes. Objectively, the PEC efficiency can be degraded by the photocorrosion of Bi2S3, CdS, CdSe or ZnO because of hole-induced dissolution or by fast electron–hole recombination at the surface of the Au layer. However, open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurements revealed that this efficiency decay could be alleviated by core (Au)–shell NPs. Fig. 7a shows the OCVD curves of layered and core–shell structures made of Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe as a function of duration. These samples were illuminated for approximately 30 s to obtain a uniform open-circuit voltage (Voc), and the Voc decay was then measured under no illumination. For layered structures, Au–Bi2S3 shows the fastest Voc decay because Bi2S3 has a relatively slow electron mobility of about 28 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature, which promotes much faster electron–hole recombination than CdS and CdSe.37 The Au–CdSe could then alleviate the Voc decay because the electron mobility of CdSe is 75 cm2 V−1 s−1.38 Compared to Au–Bi2S3 and Au–CdSe, the Au–CdS layered structure has slower Voc decays because of its high electron mobility of approximately 109 cm2 V−1 s−1.39 After annealing, the Voc decays of all the samples are clearly alleviated. Additionally, based on the Voc decay rate, the electron lifetime curves can be deduced from the following equation:40 (1)where kBT is the thermal energy, e is the positive elementary charge, and dVoc/dt is the derivative of the open-circuit voltage transient. Fig. 7b shows the electron lifetimes (τn) as a function of the Voc of the layered and core–shell structures made of Au–Bi2S3 (left column), Au–CdS (middle column) and Au–CdSe (right column). It can be seen that the core–shell structures have prolonged lifetimes compared to the layered structures. Combined with the results for the Voc decay in Fig. 7a, the prolonged lifetimes for core–shell structures could be ascribed to the Au core serving as an electron trap and thus facilitating the electron–hole separation. For layered structures, the Au layer could also act as an electron trap. However, Bi2S3, CdS and CdSe are fully covered with Au in the layered structure. Thus illumination as the electromagnetic wave will be shielded by the Au layer. As a result, the electron–hole separation is retarded. The shielding effect will be present later via finite element calculation.

To further study the contributions of the core–shell structure to the overall PEC efficiency, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) and photocurrent–potential (J–V) measurements were performed subsequently. EIS provides information about the interfacial properties of electrodes.41,42 The diameter of the semicircle in EIS correlates with the electron transfer resistance, reflecting the electron transfer kinetics of the redox probe at the electrode interface. Fig. 8a shows the Randles equivalent circuit consisting of the solution resistance (Rs), space charge capacitance and resistance (Csc and Rsc), double layer capacitance (Cdl), charge transfer resistance (Rct) and bounded Warburg element (W).43–45 The smaller radius of the EIS curve reveals the lower Rct with faster migration of photo-generated charges. The typical EIS plots of the layered (black) and core–shell structures (red) made of Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe in our PEC solution under illumination are shown in Fig. 8b–d. The EIS semicircles for all of the core–shell structures have a smaller diameter than those of the layer structures. Besides Rct, the lifetime of charge τnc is another import parameter for charge transfer and could be deduced via τnc = Rct·Cdl.46 Fitted with the equivalent circuit in Fig. 8a, Rct, Cdl and τnc are listed in Table S1 of ESI part 8.† It can be seen that core–shell structures demonstrate lower resistance and longer charge lifetime than those of layered structures, which is due to faster charge transfer and lower charge-recombination in the core–shell NPs.

The IPCE spectra of the layered (black) and core–shell structures (red) made of Au–Bi2S3 (circle), Au–CdS (triangle) and Au–CdSe (square) are collected and compared in Fig. 9a as the electrodes at 0 V versus Ag/AgCl. The IPCE value at a given wavelength can be calculated via the following equation:47 (2)where Isc is the measured photocurrent, P is the power of the incident light at a specific wavelength, and λ is the wavelength of the incident light. Fig. 9a shows that all the observed IPCE curves show enhancement in the UV region due to the stronger UV photoconversion of ZnO. First, for Au–Bi2S3, although the IPCE efficiency of the core–shell structures shows some improvement over that of the layered structures, they do not show considerable IPCE efficiency in the visible light region. To explore the sole contribution of Au–Bi2S3 NPs in IPCE enhancement, the IPCE efficiency of bare ZnO NRs is also present in Fig. 9a. The Au–Bi2S3 core–shell NPs demonstrate an enhancement less than 10% with the wavelength of illumination around 380–500 nm than that of ZnO NRs. This is because Bi2S3 has a very narrow band gap of 1.4 eV, resulting in an easier electron–hole recombination than in CdS and CdSe. For both CdS and CdSe, however, the layered and core–shell structures exhibit much enhanced IPCE efficiencies in the visible region. CdSe shows an IPCE enhancement over wider wavelengths than CdS due to its narrower band gap of 1.7 eV. The IPCE enhancement induced by the core–shell structures is mainly ascribed to enhanced light absorption, electron trapping of Au cores and decreased resistance of the PEC anode.

The current density curves of the ZnO NRs decorated with pure Bi2S3 (b), CdS (c) and CdSe are marked by green colour, and those of the ZnO NRs decorated with Au are marked by black. 
Finally, current–potential (J–V) measurements of the layered (red curve) and core–shell structures (blue curve) Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe were performed under white light illumination. Fig. 9b–d show that the layered structures exhibit lower PEC efficiency in all three materials and that the current densities are only 0.09, 0.52 and 1.29 mA cm−2 for Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe, respectively, at 0.0 VSCE. Comparatively, the core–shell structures have enhanced current densities of 0.15, 0.75 and 1.66 mA cm−2, respectively. It can be concluded that the PEC current densities of the core–shell structures are higher than those of the layered structures, ascribed to the higher photoconversion efficiency induced by enhanced light absorption, electron trapping of Au cores and decreased resistance of the PEC anode. Moreover, the PEC efficiencies of ZnO NRs decorated with pure Au, or Bi2S3 (CdS, CdSe) are also measured. Here, these four nanostructures are simplified as Au–ZnO, Bi2S3–ZnO, CdS–ZnO and CdSe–ZnO, respectively. Fig. 9b–d reveal that the current densities of Au–ZnO, Bi2S3–ZnO, CdS–ZnO and CdSe–ZnO are 0.04, 0.08, 0.50 and 1.15 mA cm−2 at 0.0 VSCE, respectively. It confirms that compared with Bi2S3, CdS and CdSe, pure Au has weaker enhancement in PEC efficiency when it is solely decorated outside of ZnO NR. Here, SEM and TEM images reveal that the volumes and loading amounts of Bi2S3, CdS and CdSe decrease after annealing. However, their PEC efficiencies are enhanced after evolving from layered to core–shell structures due to their enlarged surface area and unique advantages. These advantages will be discussed in the following paragraph.
Based on the above tests and analysis, the mechanism for PEC enhancement of the ZnO NRs decorated with core (Au)–shell NPs could be summarized. The enhanced light absorption and electron trapping of the Au core can be discussed in detail as follows. As mentioned above, the enhanced light absorption is mainly induced by the plasmonic effect. To better understand this, finite element calculation of the electromagnetic enhancement was performed to study the plasmonic effect of the core–shell NPs. Taking CdSe as an example, it can be seen from the left part of Fig. 10a that the electrical field is dramatically enhanced perpendicular to the direction of incident light. The strengthened electric field can generate hot electrons and force them to migrate into the shell and participate in the PEC reaction. Comparatively, on the right, the Au layer in layered structures could shield the electromagnetic wave penetrating into the CdSe (or Bi2S3, CdS) NP.48 As a result, the electromagnetic enhancement in CdSe, Bi2S3, or CdS is depressed. Considering that both CdSe (or Bi2S3, CdS) and ZnO are covered with an Au layer in layered structures, the dramatically enhanced electromagnetic field near the edge of the Au layer, marked by red circles, does not exist in the actual PEC process. Fig. 10b shows the proposed mechanism for PEC enhancement of core–shell/ZnO NP/NR hetero-nanostructures. Here, characters e, eh, et and h represent free electrons, hot electrons, trapped electrons and holes, respectively. Trapped electrons and positive fixed charges are marked with red color. Under illumination, photo-generated electrons and holes migrate towards the PEC cathode and anode, respectively. Except for generating hot electrons, it is well known that the Au NPs could also act as electron traps.49 In the core–shell NPs, photo-generated electrons have a higher chance to move into the Au core rather than bypass it. When the electrons are transferred to the Au core, they will be trapped and fixed inside the Au core.50 Free electrons from the shell and hot electrons from the Au core can be transferred to the cathode under a bias applied to the PEC cell. In Fig. 10b, trapped electrons are fixed on the right side. Inevitably, positive charges are fixed on the opposite side in the shell,51 which usually originate from holes or defects.52 As a result, the trapped electrons in the Au core and fixed positive charges form an internal electric field (Einter). Similar to a Schottky barrier, Einter could prevent the backflow of electrons into the Au core, and also facilitate the movement of holes from the cathode to anode. Overall, a cascade band structure is constructed because of the narrow bandgaps of NPs and that of 3.2 eV for ZnO, which facilitates the transport of electrons and holes and prevents their recombination. Besides core–shell NPs, ZnO NRs can also generate photo-electrons under UV illumination. Under visible and UV illumination, photogenerated electrons in the conduction band of NPs are then injected into ZnO, ultimately arriving at the Pt counter electrode to reduce the hydrogen ions to hydrogen gas. Most of the holes accumulated on the surface of the NPs participate in oxidizing S2− ions to S22− ions. The role of the sacrificial reagent SO32− in the electrolyte is to prevent a reverse reaction by reducing S22− to S2−. Especially for the core–shell NPs, the Au core could act as a photoelectron trap and a hot electron generator. As a result, the ZnO NRs exhibited enhanced PEC efficiency.

4. Conclusion
In this work, an unconventional outer-to-inner synthesis strategy is demonstrated as an efficient and universal method to fabricate core–shell NPs onto a scaffold structure. That is, the shell material is deposited onto the scaffold first, and then a layer of the core material (Au) is covered on the surface of the shell; finally, the core (Au)–shell NPs are formed on the scaffold after annealing. Three core–shell NPs, Au–Bi2S3, Au–CdS and Au–CdSe, are grown on the surface of ZnO NRs via this strategy. All of the three core–shell heterostructures exhibit enhanced PEC efficiency. The enhanced PEC performance is ascribed to improved light absorption induced by the plasmonic effect, to trapped electrons of the Au NPs and to the cascade band alignment of the shell material and ZnO. The synthetic method gives a universal path to the development of nanodevices with assembled core–shell NPs. The core–shell NPs proposed in the current study possess significant potential as building blocks for future PEC anodes or other solar conversion systems.
