    , Accepted 10th May 2023First published on 11th May 2023AbstractEnergetic disorder is one of the major impediments that limits the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). Nevertheless, achieving a favorable nanoscale morphology that restricts the density of states proves to be challenging, especially in the state-of-the-art non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) systems. Here, we incorporate 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as a solid additive to restrict the energetic disorder and achieve outstanding efficiencies of OSCs. The results suggest that TMB possesses intense electrostatic interaction with the terminal groups of NFAs to facilitate direct face-to-face packing. During the film formation, TMB works as a bridge to connect adjacent NFAs, and a controlled π–π stacking distance can be obtained after its subsequent volatilization. The optimized morphology limits energetics disorder, which further enhances exciton delocalization and inhibits non-radiative energy loss. Consequently, TMB-incorporated binary devices based on PBDB-TF:eC9 and ternary devices based on PBDB-TF:eC9:HDO-4Cl record high efficiencies of 18.61% and 19.30%, respectively. This work provides new insights into morphology optimization and offers inspiration for new approaches to improve OSC performance.

Broader context
Energetic disorder is one of the major impediments that limits the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, achieving a favorable nanoscale morphology that suppresses the energetic disorder proves to be challenging. Here, we develop 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as a solid additive to control the crystallization of NFAs and restrict the energetic disorder in OSCs. During the film-forming process, TMB acts as a bridge between adjacent NFAs, leading to a well-controlled π–π distance upon its subsequent removal. This optimized morphology reduces energetic disorder, enhances exciton delocalization, and suppresses non-radiative energy loss. As a result, TMB-based binary and ternary OSCs using PBDB-TF:eC9 and PBDB-TF:eC9:HDO-4Cl, respectively, achieve high efficiencies of 18.61% and 19.30%. This work represents a significant advance in morphology optimization of OSCs and proposes an effective method to further improve the efficiency of OSCs.

Introduction
Bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (OSCs) that consist of donors and acceptors have achieved significant progress and demonstrated great potential in practical applications in recent years.1–5 The nanoscale morphology of binary or multiple active layers plays a crucial role in determining the energetic distributions, which further affects the exciton diffusion, charge generation, transport, and recombination mechanism. This, in turn, determines the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of OSCs. To get an ideal morphology with suitable domain size and molecular orientation, solvent additives such as 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) and 1-chloronaphthalene are commonly incorporated into the fabrication of active layers.6,7 The selective solubility can regulate the precipitation dynamics of donors and acceptors, leading to enhanced phase separation in the blend films.8–10 However, it should be noted that as the solvent additives usually have high boiling points, their residue will arouse the energetic disorder of the edge states and lead to extra recombination energy losses.11,12 Some results also suggest that the deterioration of the halogen-contained additives under continuous irradiation can induce the degradation of active layers and harm the device stability.13,14 Furthermore, the volume sensitivity may lead to over-aggregation and thus cause batch-to-batch reproducibility problems, which challenges the industrialization of OSCs.
Solid additives have been developed as a promising method to obtain desired morphology and avoid the shortages of solvent additives.15–18 An ideal solid additive should possess high volatility to ensure its removal during the film formation. Besides, the intermolecular interactions between additives and host materials should be effectively tuned to regulate the ordered molecular packing modes.15,19 In 2018, by considering the structural features of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), we first proposed the volatilizable solid additive strategy for morphology optimization.15 Due to the enhanced π–π interactions, the charge transport in NFAs can be significantly improved. Recently, volatile aromatic solids with simple π-backbone have been exploited as morphology modulators to tune the self-assembly aggregation of NFAs.20–26 For instance, Huang et al. designed a planar solid additive SAD2 that can induce an intimate and ordered packing of Y6 derivatives, leading to a recorded high PCE of 18.85%.27 Although solid additives have shown great potential in improving the performance of OSCs, there are still some drawbacks and ambiguous understandings at present. On one hand, energetic disorder and recombination losses are difficult to restrict. This can be attributed to either the disordered molecular packing or the over-aggregation of the NFAs. On the other hand, the intermolecular interactions and functional mechanisms between solid additives and host materials are elusive, leaving ambiguous understandings of morphology evolutions.
In this work, we develop a new morphology regulation approach using high-volatile 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as a solid additive to restrict energetic disorder. The electron-donating methoxy groups bring significant negative molecular electrostatic potential (ESP) to the center of the TMB, which facilitates the face-to-face packing between TMB and the terminal group of NFAs by directly manipulating the π–π stacking. By using in situ absorption spectroscopy, for the first time, we reveal the complete morphology evolution mechanism of the solid additive-incorporated active layer, and investigate the volatilization mechanism in details. It is found that TMB can induce NFAs to aggregate into larger crystallites and then volatilize during the spin-coating, forming an incompact stacking mode with an enlarged π–π stacking distance. Under this novel morphology, a significantly reduced energetic disorder can be obtained to suppress the non-radiative recombination loss (ΔEnon-rad) and enhance the exciton delocalization. As a result, a PCE of 18.61% is achieved in TMB-incorporated PBDB-TF:eC9 binary OSCs, which is significantly higher than that of the DIO-processed devices. The effectiveness of TMB is also confirmed in PBDB-TF:eC9:HDO-4Cl-based ternary OSCs, recording an outstanding PCE of 19.30%. The strategy and mechanism reported in this work provide new insights into morphology optimization and can inspire new methodologies to boost the performance of OSCs.
Results and discussion
Fig. S1 (ESI†) shows the molecular structures and the EPS distributions of PBDB-TF and eC9. To study the intermolecular interaction between TMB and the NFA acceptor, we first calculated and compared the ESP distributions of TMB and the eC9 terminal group. As shown in Fig. 1a, the central area of TMB exhibits negative ESP values, indicating a strong electron-donating property induced by the methoxy groups. The terminal group of eC9 displays a distinctive positive ESP distribution, implying its strong electronic affinity. We optimized the packing configurations of eC9-TMB dimer, and the result (Fig. 1a) shows that TMB tends to pack onto the electron-deficit five-membered ring of the eC9 edge group. Then, we carried out the independent gradient model based on Hirshfeld partition (IGMH) analysis to evaluate the non-covalent interaction. Strong and widely-distributed attractive interaction between the terminal group of eC9 and TMB reveals the existence of the strong π–π interaction. These results indicate that TMB should interact with eC9 and directly regulate the π–π interaction during the blend film formation. We further dissolved TMB and eC9 in n-hexane solvent to verify their interaction. As shown in Fig. 1b, eC9 exhibits poor solubility in n-hexane with a large number of suspensions. The incorporation of TMB can significantly improve the solubility of eC9, while the solution with DIO additive remains the same. As illustrated by the schematics, eC9 possesses intense self-aggregation property, which makes it difficult to be dissolved in non-polar solvent. After the incorporation of TMB, the interaction between TMB and eC9 breaks the aggregates and results in great solubility. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, Raman spectra, and NMR evidence are also provided (Fig. S2, ESI†). The shifts of vibration signals in spectra and the change of NMR relaxation time further verify the intermolecular attraction between TMB and eC9 edge group. We further conducted investigation on the interaction between TMB and PBDB-TF (Fig. S3, ESI†). The results reveal that the interaction is considerably weaker, with the aggregation behaviour of PBDB-TF remaining unchanged upon TMB treatment. Therefore, we can conclude that the interaction between TMB and eC9 is dominant in the blend.

(d) Schematic diagram of the interrelationship between energetic disorder and Stokes shift in TMB and DIO treated eC9 films. 

Fig. 1c shows the corresponding absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the TMB- and DIO-treated eC9 neat films. The DIO-treated eC9 film shows long-wavelength located absorption and PL spectra with a Stokes shift (ΔES) of 127 meV, while the TMB-treated film exhibits blue-shifted absorption and emission spectra with a reduced ΔES value of 113 meV. As illustrated in Fig. 1d, the value of ΔES is correlated with the density of state (DoS) distribution of the edge state, where a restricted energetic disorder can relieve the vibrational relaxation and lead to limited ΔES. Therefore, the intense intermolecular interaction between TMB and eC9 results in an ordered eC9 packing mode with the suppressed energetic disorder, while the DIO treatment could lead to a disordered aggregation that broadens the DoS distributions. We also performed thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) to investigate the volatility of TMB (Fig. S4, ESI†). TMB experiences a 5% weight loss at around 107 °C and a total weight loss at approximately 150 °C under the scan rate of 10 °C min−1. In comparison, DIO remains 70% of its initial weight at 150 °C, indicating that TMB can volatilize at low temperatures.
To illustrate the effect of the additives on the photovoltaic performance, we fabricated PBDB-TF:eC9-based OSCs with TMB and DIO as additives using the structure shown in Fig. 2a. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the detailed parameters are summarized in Fig. 2b, Table 1, Fig. S5 and Table S1 (ESI†). The DIO-treated devices exhibit a maximum PCE of 17.94%, with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.839 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 26.82 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 79.73%, which is consistent with our previous report.28 For the TMB-incorporated device, the photovoltaic parameters are significantly improved with a VOC of 0.854 V, a JSC of 27.26 mA cm−2, and an FF of 79.95%, leading to a champion PCE of 18.61%. The EQE spectra of the corresponding cells are shown in Fig. 2c. The DIO-processed device exhibits a descending trend of EQE value starting from the wavelength of 750 nm, while the TMB-treated device shows a prominently enhanced eC9 photon response in the range of 700–850 nm and reaches a high EQE value of beyond 86%. As a result, the integrated JSC (Jcal) value is increased to 26.91 mA cm−2 for TMB-treated devices, which agrees with the JSC values obtained from J–V characteristics.

It can be noticed that the obvious performance improvements in the TMB-based cell are mainly attributed to the VOC and JSC. Therefore, we investigated the origins of these enhancements. The voltage losses (Elosss) were quantified by measuring the high-sensitive EQE (sEQE) spectra and electroluminescence external quantum efficiency (EQEEL) of the devices. The calculation methods are provided in Supporting Information and the detailed Eloss parameters are summarized in Table 2. As shown in Fig. 2d and Fig. S6 (ESI†), the intersection of measured and fitted sEQE and EL spectra determined the bandgaps (Egs) and the energy of the charge transfer states (ECTs), and deliver the above-bandgap radiative recombination loss (ΔECT) of 0.025 and 0.038 eV for DIO- and TMB-based cells, respectively. ΔEnon-rads were calculated from EQEEL (Fig. 2e). The TMB-based device exhibits higher EQEEL values of 3.36 × 10−4 compared with 1.16 × 10−4 of the DIO-based devices, resulting in a suppressed ΔEnon-rad of 0.207 eV in the TMB-based device. The radiative recombination losses (ΔErads) of the OSCs were calculated to be 0.310 eV for the DIO-based device and 0.296 eV for the TMB-based device. The DoSs of the highest occupied molecular orbit (HOMO) of the DIO and TMB fabricated devices were further probed using impedance spectroscopy and Mott–Schottky characteristics (Fig. S7, ESI†).29 The results are shown in Fig. 2f, in which the DIO-treated film possesses a widely distributed DoS with a peak value of 8.52 × 1017 eV−1 cm−3 and an energetic disorder of 50.6 meV, while the TMB-treated film exhibits a reduced DoS of 5.83 × 1017 eV−1 cm−3 and a limited disorder of 39.6 meV. These results are consistent with the changes of ΔES in Fig. 1c. The charge extraction and transport characteristics were also evaluated. The exciton dissociation probability was calculated as the photocurrent (Jph)-effective voltage (Veff) curves shown in Fig. 2g. The TMB-based device exhibits higher Jph under short-circuit conditions and achieves a higher exciton dissociation probability (Pdiss) of 98% compared to 95% of the DIO-based device. The photoinduced charger-carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) was utilized to calculate carrier mobilities of the fast charge carriers (Fig. 2h). The calculated mobilities are 1.26 × 10−4 and 1.06 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for TMB- and DIO-based cells, respectively. The geminate recombination was characterized by the VOC-light intensity relationship shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†), in which the slopes of linear fitting are 1.06kT/q and 1.10kT/q for TMB- and DIO-based cells, respectively, indicating a suppressed geminate recombination. The bimolecular recombination was also investigated (Fig. S9, ESI†) and shows that TMB treatment can effectively relieve the bimolecular recombination. The restricted DoS in TMB-treated film suppresses the geminate recombination that occurred at the band edge, leading to simultaneous enhancements in device VOC and JSC. The effectiveness of TMB was also verified in other representative NFA-based OSCs (Summarized in Fig. S10 and Table S2, ESI†), in which the VOC and JSC values are also improved to support the increased PCEs. We further incorporated TMB additive into the ternary blend of PBDB-TF:eC9:HDO-4Cl (Fig. 2i and Fig. S11, ESI† and Table 1) and achieved a VOC of 0.883 V, a JSC of 27.27 mA cm−2, and an FF of 80.17%, leading to an enhanced PCE of 19.30% in contrast with 18.27% of the DIO-treated blend. We summarized the recent reports of volatile solid additives (Table S3, ESI†) and shows that this work reported TMB additive is effective to enhance the OSCs performance. For the scalable fabrication, TMB-incorporated blade-coated device exhibits the same improvement with the spin-coated small area device, in which a 20 meV improvement in VOC supports a higher PCE of 16.49% in contrast to DIO-treated device (Fig. S12, ESI†). We also evaluated the device stability of TMB treatment. As shown in Fig. S13 and S14 (ESI†), TMB-incorporated OSCs display enhanced photostability and thermostability with stable morphology in comparison with DIO-treated devices.

Since the OSC performance is closely related to the morphology of the active layer, we investigated the effects of TMB on nanostructure and crystallinity. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was performed to study the surface morphology and aggregation behaviour. As shown in Fig. 3a, the neat eC9 film fabricated with DIO as additive exhibits serious crystallization with root-mean-square roughness (Rq) of 16.10 nm. In contrast, eC9 film processed with TMB shows a smooth surface morphology with Rq of 0.54 nm, demonstrating that TMB additive can restrain the over-aggregation of eC9 molecules. For the blend films, DIO- and TMB-treated films have homogeneous fibril-network morphology with small crystallites inserted, as shown in the phase images. The TMB-treated film shows a lower Rq value of 2.29 nm compared to the 2.38 nm of the DIO-treated film, suggesting the change in aggregation and phase separation induced by TMB. Grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurement was further utilized to reveal the molecular packing and crystallinity differences. The results are shown in Fig. 3b, c and Fig. S15 (ESI†). After spin-coating, the DIO-treated eC9 neat film exhibits a 2D-GIWAXS pattern with multiple distinctive diffraction singles, while the TMB-treated eC9 neat film shows few diffraction peaks with broad distribution, where a π–π stacking peak locate in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction at ∼1.67 Å−1 and a lamellar peak in the (IP) direction at ∼0.38 Å−1. This is consistent with the AFM result that TMB can restrict the over-aggregation of eC9 molecules. For the PBDB-TF:eC9 blend films, both blends are preferentially face-on oriented according to the π–π stacking features located at the OOP direction, which facilities the charge transport. Fitting analysis of the π–π stacking peaks was executed with the results summarized in Fig. S16 and Table S4 (ESI†). The incorporation of TMB limited the intermolecular aggregation and led to a larger π–π stacking distance of 3.71 Å (3.60 Å for the DIO-treated blend). Meanwhile, the crystalline correlation length (CCL) in DIO- and TMB-treated films were calculated to be 23.96 Å and 26.95 Å, respectively. The ESP difference between TMB and the end groups of NFAs leads to strong intermolecular interaction to form a face-to-face packing. Therefore, the incorporation of TMB promotes the aggregation of acceptor molecules and realizes a novel crystallinity that the crystallite size is enlarged yet the π–π stacking distance is moderately loosed. Under such an ideal nanostructure, the charge transport properties can be enhanced and the aggregation-induced emission quenching can be relieved, leading to improved JSC and VOC in the TMB-based cell.

To investigate the film formation dynamics and the crystallization mechanisms under additive treatments, we utilized the in situ UV-visible absorption spectroscopy to monitor the whole film-forming process. The results of the spin-coating process are shown in Fig. 4a, b and Fig. S17 (ESI†). Both TMB- and DIO-treated blend exhibit two main absorption peaks, which represents the 0–0 absorption peak of PBDB-TF and eC9 as verified by the neat film absorption spectra shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†). During the transition from solution phase to film phase, the DIO-treated blend shows a slightly red-shifted PBDB-TF peak from 612 to 624 nm, and an obvious red-shifted eC9 peak from 750 to 820 nm. However, despite the TMB-treated blend observing a similar peak evolution of PBDB-TF, the red shift of eC9 absorption is significantly controlled with a final peak position of 790 nm. Such results indicate that TMB prevents the over-close stacking of eC9 molecules during film deposition. The in situ absorption spectra of the thermal annealing processes were continuously measured right after spin-coating, with the results illustrated in Fig. 4c, 4d, and Fig. S17 (ESI†). The absorption intensity and peak position are almost unchanged in DIO-treated films, but the TMB-treated film shows a successive red-shifted eC9 peak from 790 to 812 nm under the annealing of 10 min, indicating the packing of eC9 molecules are further tightened. The entire evolutions of the eC9 peak position are extracted and summarized in Fig. 4e. In both TMB- and DIO-treated blends, eC9 exhibits a three-stage transition during spin-coating, including solvent evaporation, crystal growth, and dried film stage.30–32 The DIO-treated blend shows a delayed and slow crystal growth process (starts at ∼1 s and endures a ∼1 s timescale), while the crystal growth in the TMB-treated blend starts earlier at ∼0.5 s and undergoes a faster process of ∼0.6 s. This verifies the interaction between TMB and eC9 that facilities the eC9 crystallization. Into the thermal annealing stage, the eC9 peak position in the DIO-treated film is almost unchanged, but a slow-rising kinetics is found in the TMB-treated film. The volatilization mechanism of TMB additive was investigated. FTIR spectra (Fig. 4f) indicate that the spin-coated TMB-incorporated film exhibits an identical spectrum to the additive-free film, in which no discernible peaks corresponding to TMB can be found. UV-visible spectroscopy and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analyses (Fig. S19, ESI†) of the redissolved solution from the eC9:TMB film (right after spin-coating) confirm the evaporation of TMB. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence for the volatility of TMB during the spin-coating process. This high volatility can be attributed to the significantly higher vapor pressure of TMB (1.43 Pa at 25 °C) compared to that of DIO (0.03 Pa at 25 °C).

Based on the above investigations, we can elucidate the mechanism of the TMB additive, which is illustrated in Fig. 4g. During the crystal growth stage in the spin-coating process, TMB promotes the aggregation of eC9 through electrostatic interactions, facilitating phase separation and resulting in a crystallization mode with larger aggregation but untight π–π stacking distance. Subsequently, the TMB molecules volatilize prior to the formation of the dry film, resulting in loosely packed eC9 aggregations within the BHJ film. Under this condition, energetic disorder and aggregation-induced recombination are significantly suppressed to support a high VOC value, but the charge transport property is jeopardized and leads to a lower JSC and FF (Fig. S20 and Table S5, ESI†). During the thermal annealing, the π–π stacking of the acceptors can be meticulously regulated by annealing time since the thermal-induced aggregation is relatively moderate, which promotes the JSC and FF and restricts the energy loss in a reasonable scale to preserve a high VOC value.
To comprehend the correlation between optimized morphology and improved photovoltaic performances in TMB-processed film, we utilized femtosecond transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescent (TRPL) spectroscopy to analyse the excitation dynamics in detail. The results of TA spectra for TMB- and DIO- treated PBDB-TF:eC9 films are depicted in Fig. 5a and b, and Fig. S21 (ESI†), respectively. Upon pumping at 800 nm pulse, both blends exhibit the ground state bleaching (GSB) of eC9 at ∼800 nm, the localized excitation (LE) at ∼900 nm, the delocalized excitation (DLE) among 1300–1600 nm, and the GSB of PBDB-TF among 550–630 nm, which aligns with previous findings and attests to the presence of the hole-transfer kinetics.33–36 The hole-transfer dynamics under the treatments of DIO and TMB are further quantified and compared. The dynamics of LE and donor GSB signals are probed at 960 nm and 580 nm, respectively (Fig. 5c). In DIO-treated films, the photoexcited LE state exhibits longer decay, and the donor GSB signal displayed a slow-rising kinetics peaking at 4.4 ps. In contrast, the TMB-treated blend shows a decreased lifetime of LE, following a fast-growing donor GSB signal that saturated at 1.2 ps after excitation. The hole-transfer efficiencies are calculated to be 94.4% and 92.8% for TMB- and DIO-treated films (Table S6, ESI†), which is consistent with the calculated charge transfer features of eC9 dimers in Fig. S22 (ESI†). Since the delocalization property is crucial to exciton dissociation and plays an intermediary role in the hole-transfer process,37–39 the TA dynamics of DLE states were fitted and compared in Fig. 5d and Table S7 (ESI†). It can be found that the DLE dynamics in both films consist of a fast and a slow decay channel, with the TMB-treated blend exhibiting a shorter fast-decay lifetime of 4.0 ps and a similar slow-decay lifetime of ∼740 ps shown in both blends. These findings suggest enhanced delocalization of the electron–hole pairs and improved charge dissociation. Additionally, temperature-related PL spectra of the two blends were further measured (Fig. S23, ESI†) with a red-shift trend observed in the emission peak positions of eC9, indicating renormalization of band energies due to electron–lattice interaction.40,41 The temperature-dependent emission peak energy can be described by the following equation (1)where E(0) is the band gap energy at 0 K, θ is the average phonon temperature, and a is the intensity of electron–lattice interaction.40,42–44Fig. 5e delivers the fittings based on eqn (1) and shows that the TMB-treated film has weak electron–lattice interaction with an intensity of 51 meV while that of the DIO-treated film is 112 meV, which further verifies the enhanced delocalization property in TMB-processed films. The enlarged π–π stacking distance in TMB-treated film benefits the spatial extension of DLEs, which leads to the longer spatial distribution of the intermolecular dipoles and stimulates the escape of polaron from the lattice potential. As a result, the charge carrier generation is enhanced as the EQE values among the acceptor absorption wavelength range are significantly elevated. To illustrate the details of exciton dissociation, TRPL characteristics were performed on additive-treated PBDB-TF:eC9 films. Fig. 5f shows the TRPL dynamics of eC9 probed at 900 nm, where the eC9 emission in the TMB-treated film is quenched with a faster decay process compared to the DIO-treated film. The TRPL lifetimes were further fitted by double-exponential functions (fitting details are summarized in Table S8, ESI†). The fast component in the TMB-treated blend shows a shorter lifetime of 72.7 ps and an increased ratio of 97.5%, which can be attributed to the fast dissociation occurring at the D/A interface. The slower component can be attributed to diffusion-related electron transfer in the bulk area, which typically has a longer lifetime of a few hundred picoseconds. TRPL mapping was also measured to deliver a statistical result (inset in Fig. 5f and Fig. S24, ESI†). The DIO-treated film exhibits a broad and long-time located eC9 PL lifetime distribution, while the incorporation of TMB results in a narrow distribution centered at a shorter time scale. The results demonstrate that excitons in the TMB-treated blend can dissociate into charge carriers efficiently, while the excitons in DIO-treated blend tend to be restrained by the lattice potential and suffer recombination loss, which is consistent with the restricted energetic disorder and suppressed ΔEnon-rad.

The distribution curves are fitted by Gaussian distribution functions. 
We further evaluated the essential qualities that an effective electron-donating benzene-based additive should possess. Analogues of TMB, including 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene, methoxybenzene, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, and 1,2,3-trimethoxybenzene were incorporated as additive in PBDB-TF:eC9 device (Fig. S27 and Table S9, ESI†). Our results show that weak electron-donating properties of the additives led to reduced FF and JSC values. Additionally, asymmetric ESP distribution and poor planarity can hinder the interaction between the additives and eC9 and decrease the photovoltaic performance. Therefore, effective electron-donating benzene-based additives should have symmetrical molecular configuration, intensive electron-donating properties, and good planarity.
Conclusions
In summary, a novel approach of restricting energetic disorder was developed by using TMB as an additive, and the effects of solid additives on restricting NFAs over-aggregation were comprehensively revealed. The electron-donating methoxy groups guarantee robust electrostatic interaction between TMB and NFA terminal groups, which facilitates phase separation and stimulates the formation of larger crystallites. Due to the high volatility, TMB can be removed from the BHJ film during spin-coating and leave sufficient space for precisely controlling the π–π stacking distance through thermal annealing. By applying in situ absorption spectroscopy, the component aggregation dynamics among the entire film formation process can be directly monitored, and the optimized aggregation mode is accessible. The regulated NFA packing configurations suppress the energetics disorder and alleviate the exciton–lattice interaction, which results in enhanced exciton delocalization, efficient charge transfer, and inhibited non-radiative recombination loss. Consequently, the VOC and JSC values were simultaneously promoted, and the wide applicability among multiple D:A systems were verified. Typically, the TMB-processed PBDB-TF:eC9 binary cells achieved a high PCE of 18.61%, and the corresponding PBDB-TF:eC9:HDO-4Cl cells realized a remarkable PCE of 19.30%. Overall, by developing novel approach on morphology optimization, this study can inspire innovative techniques that could boost the performance of OSCs.

Broader context
Energetic disorder is one of the major impediments that limits the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, achieving a favorable nanoscale morphology that suppresses the energetic disorder proves to be challenging. Here, we develop 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB) as a solid additive to control the crystallization of NFAs and restrict the energetic disorder in OSCs. During the film-forming process, TMB acts as a bridge between adjacent NFAs, leading to a well-controlled π–π distance upon its subsequent removal. This optimized morphology reduces energetic disorder, enhances exciton delocalization, and suppresses non-radiative energy loss. As a result, TMB-based binary and ternary OSCs using PBDB-TF:eC9 and PBDB-TF:eC9:HDO-4Cl, respectively, achieve high efficiencies of 18.61% and 19.30%. This work represents a significant advance in morphology optimization of OSCs and proposes an effective method to further improve the efficiency of OSCs.
