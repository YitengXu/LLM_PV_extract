, Accepted 15th April 2016First published on 18th April 2016AbstractThe robust UiO-67 framework was selected as a platform to incorporate 12-tungstosilicic acid (SiW12). The LUMO potential of the resulting SiW12@UiO-67 is observed to be −0.29 V versus NHE and the HOMO potential can be calculated to be 3.21 V vs. NHE. The SiW12@UiO-67 was firstly used as a supporting matrix to support the CdS nanoparticles and MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (M/G) cocatalyst. The obtained composite SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS showed improved photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. The optimum H2 production over SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS can be obtained when 30 wt% SiW12@UiO-67 is introduced in the composites, reaching 1.27 mmol h−1 in the presence of 5% M/G, which is about 2 times that of M/G–CdS. The enhanced photocatalytic activity might be attributed to the large specific surface area of SiW12@UiO-67 and the effective heterostructure between SiW12@UiO-67 and CdS. In addition, the insertion of SiW12 into the porous UiO-67 could improve its ability to transfer electrons. Therefore, the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes could be accelerated and the fast recombination of charge carriers of CdS could be suppressed.
1. Introduction
Conversion of solar energy to chemical energy by producing hydrogen fuel from water splitting has been an attractive strategy to address the environmental crises and energy shortage issues.1 Since Fujishima and Honda first discovered the photocatalytic splitting of water on TiO2 electrodes in 1972,2 this photocatalytic process has attracted much attention and appears to be a promising strategy for efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly production of H2. Among various photocatalysts, CdS is a promising visible-light-driven photocatalyst due to its relatively narrow band gap (2.4 eV) as well as more negative conduction band edge than the reduction potential of H2O/H2.3 However, the efficiency of photocatalytic H2 evolution is far from the satisfying level owing to the rapid recombination of photo-generated electrons and holes in the photocatalysts and the lack of active catalytic sites.
Basically, the photocatalytic H2 evolution reaction involves three major steps: (i) absorption of light by photocatalysts to generate electrons and holes; (ii) charge separation and migration to the surface of the photocatalysts; (iii) surface reactions for water reduction. Subject to these major process, a variety of approaches have been proposed to enhance the photocatalytic activity of CdS, including: (i) coupling CdS with other semiconductors like TiO2, ZnO, WO3, In2S3 etc.4–8 Owing to the favourable position of conduction bands for the coupled semiconductor, the photogenerated electrons could transfer easily from one semiconductor to the other, which will considerably enhance the photocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution. (ii) Controlling the crystal structure, crystallinity and particle size of CdS by different synthesis routes.9–11 Nanosized semiconductor photocatalysts have a shorter bulk-to-surface diffusion distance for e− and h+ compared with the bulk materials, exhibiting a higher photocatalytic activity by suppressing the surface/bulk recombination of e− and h+. (iii) Preparation of the sulfide solid solution by mixing with wide band gap semiconductors.12–14 The band structure of the solid solution can be continuously adjusted by changing its composition. Hence, the light harvesting ability and photocatalytic properties of CdS could be improved. (iv) Loading with reduction and/or oxidation cocatalysts.15–18 The cocatalyst could not only promote the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, but also lower the activation potentials for H2 generation. Moreover, they are often served as the active sites for H2 evolution. (v) Immobilization of CdS over large area supports to enhance the exposed surface of the photocatalysts, such as zeolites, polymeric fibers and metal organic frameworks.19–21 It has been demonstrated that the supported CdS exhibits a higher photocatalytic activity without undergoing any photocorrosion.
Polyoxometalates (POMs), a class of molecular metal–oxo cluster compounds with a large diversity of structures and compositions, exhibit remarkably rich redox and photochemical properties.22 Especially, POMs have an intrinsic characteristic to be an efficient electron acceptor, which could capture the photogenerated electrons from semiconductors and then transport the electrons to neighboring domain. Our recent research has also found that POMs could act as electron acceptors to promote the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of semiconductors and the power conversion efficiency of semiconductor thin-film solar cells.23–26 However, the high solubility in aqueous solution and low surface area of POMs limit their further applications. To solve these drawbacks, POMs have been incorporated into different porous MOFs such as MIL-100, MIL-101 and HKUST-1.27–29 Recently, the Zr-based metal–organic frameworks (UiO-66–68) have been found to be an excellent photoactive species carrier due to its high stable, adjustable, photoactive and semiconductor properties.30–32 Considering the interesting feature of POMs and the above excellent properties of UiO framework, herein, the robust UiO-67 framework, consisting of Zr(IV)-based secondary building blocks (Zr6O4(OH)4) and diphenyl ligands was selected as a platform to incorporate 12-tungstosilicic acid (SiW12). Subsequently, CdS nanoparticles and MoS2/reduced graphene oxide (M/G) cocatalyst were loaded on the SiW12@UiO-67 supporting matrix. The obtained composite SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS showed improved photocatalytic H2 evolution activity. The enhanced photocatalytic activity might be attributed to the large specific surface area of SiW12@UiO-67 and the effective heterostructure between SiW12@UiO-67 and CdS. In addition, the insertion of SiW12 into the porous UiO-67 could improve its ability to transfer electrons. Therefore, the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes could be accelerated and the fast recombination of charge carriers of CdS could be suppressed. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to tune the electrons transfer ability of UiO-67 by the insertion of polyoxometalates and the SiW12@UiO-67 was first used as a supporting matrix to improve the photocatalytic H2 evolution of CdS.
2. Experimental
2.1 Synthetic procedures
2.1.1 Synthesis of UiO-67. UiO-67 was synthesized by a modified solvothermal method based on a previous work.33 In a typical synthesis, ZrCl4 (0.116 g, 0.5 mmol) and biphenyl-dicarboxylic acid (0.121 g, 0.5 mmol), benzoic acid (1.83 g, 15 mmol) and 0.083 mL concentrated HCl were dissolved in 10 mL dimethylformamide (DMF). The mixture was stirred for half an hour and transferred into a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated to 120 °C over a period of 2 h. After 24 h, the solution was cooled to room temperature and the precipitates were isolated by centrifugation. The sample was purified with anhydrous DMF and acetone for several times, followed by drying at 90 °C overnight.
2.1.2 Synthesis of SiW12@UiO-67. SiW12@UiO-67 was prepared using the same method as that for the preparation of UiO-67. The difference is the introduction of SiW12 in the mixture. ZrCl4 (0.116 g, 0.5 mmol) and biphenyl-dicarboxylic acid (0.121 g, 0.5 mmol), benzoic acid (1.83 g, 15 mmol), SiW12 (0.250 g, 0.09 mmol) and 0.083 mL concentrated HCl were dissolved in 10 mL dimethylformamide (DMF). The mixture was stirred for half an hour and transferred into a 23 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and heated to 120 °C over a period of 2 h. After 24 h, the solution was cooled to room temperature and the precipitates were isolated by centrifugation. The sample was purified with anhydrous DMF and acetone for several times, followed by drying at 90 °C overnight. The content of SiW12 in SiW12@UiO-67 was investigated by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy to be 27%.
2.1.3 Synthesis of SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS. The composite samples were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. CdS was synthesized according to the literature method16 except being kept at 60 °C for 12 h. Graphene oxide (GO) was synthesized from natural graphite powder (>99.8%, Alfa Aesar) by a modified Hummers, method.34 Layered MoS2/graphene was synthesized according to the literature method.11 In a typical synthesis of SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS photocatalyst, 0.2 g of CdS, 0.01 g MoS2/reduced graphene oxide and 0.06 g SiW12@UiO-67 were dispersed in 30 mL of deionized water and 10 mL ethanol. After ultrasonication for 1 h, the mixture was transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave followed by hydrothermal treatment at 160 °C for 6 h. The dark green solids were collected by filtration and washed with deionized water for several times, followed by drying overnight at 80 °C. Similarly, a series of the SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS composites was prepared by varying the amount of SiW12@UiO-67 from 0% to 50% (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 wt%) in the composites under the same conditions.
2.2 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were recorded ranging from 5 to 80° at room temperature on a Siemens D5005 diffractometer with Cu-Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) radiation. Infrared spectra (IR) were recorded with a Nicolet Magna 560 FT-IR spectrometer. The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded on a USWHA150 photoelectron spectroscope using monochromatic Al Kα (1486.6 eV) radiation. The ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra were obtained using a CARY 500 scan UV-vis-NIR spectrophotometer. Morphology and composition analyses were carried out on a Hitachi SU-8010 field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis accessory. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images were obtained on a JEM-2100F microscope with an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The hydrogen evolved was analyzed with a gas chromatograph (Agilent 6890GC, thermal conductivity detector, Ar carrier). Photocurrents were measured using a CHI660C electrochemical analyzer with a standard three-electrode system using the prepared samples as the working electrodes with an active area of ca. 1.0 cm2, a Pt foil as the counter electrode, and saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as a reference electrode and 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.
2.3 Photocatalytic reactions
In a typical photocatalytic experiment, 0.1 g photocatalyst was well suspended with constant stirring in a 160 mL of aqueous solution containing 30 vol% of lactic acid (85–90% aqueous solution, Alfa Aesar). Prior to irradiation, the suspension of the catalyst was bubbled with nitrogen through the reactor for 30 min to completely remove the dissolved oxygen and to assure anaerobic conditions. After thoroughly degassed, the suspension was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp (25 cm far away from the photocatalytic reactor) which is equipped with an optical filter (λ > 400 nm) to cut off the light in the ultraviolet region. The temperature of the reaction solution was maintained at 20 °C by a flow of cooling water.
3. Results and discussion
The diffraction peaks of the UiO-67 can be well matched with the previous reports,33 demonstrating that UiO-67 has been successfully synthesized. With the introduction of SiW12, the integrity of the UiO-67 framework is maintained. The XRD patterns of CdS samples exhibit hexagonal phase as shown in Fig. 1. No characteristic diffraction peaks for M/G species are observed because of the low amount and relatively low diffraction intensity. When the content of SiW12@UiO-67 in the composite is lower than 40%, the characteristic peaks of SiW12@UiO-67 could not be clearly identified in the XRD pattern. With 40% of SiW12@UiO-67, the composite exhibits distinct diffraction peaks of SiW12@UiO-67 and CdS, suggesting that CdS has been successfully loaded on the SiW12@UiO-67 framework.

IR spectra (Fig. 2) show additional characteristic bands in the SiW12@UiO-67 sample corresponding to SiW12 at 969, 920, 879 and 757 cm−1 attributed to νas(Si–Oa), νas(WOd), νas(W–Ob–W) and νas(W–Oc–W), respectively (Oa, oxygen atoms bonded to one P atom and three W atoms; Ob, edge-sharing oxygen atoms; Oc, corner-sharing oxygen atoms; Od, terminal oxygen). The νas(WOd) and νas(W–Oc–W) vibration bands are remarkably shifted in comparison to pure SiW12 (906 and 730 cm−1, respectively). This shift discloses the confinement effect of SiW12 inside the porous UiO-67 framework. Additionally, the carboxylate vibration bands in SiW12@UiO-67 are between 1300 and 1700 cm−1 as shown in Fig. 2. The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectrum of SiW12@UiO-67 is displayed in Fig. S1 (ESI†) and the band gap (Eg) is determined to be 3.5 eV for SiW12@UiO-67 (Fig. S2, ESI†). The UV-vis absorption spectra of CdS, M/G–CdS and SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS are displayed in Fig. 3. In contrast to CdS, the composite photocatalysts M/G–CdS and SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS display stronger absorption in the spectrum of the visible light region from 550 to 800 nm, and this is attributed to the loaded M/G in the composites.11 The Eg of SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS is determined to be 2.3 eV from the plot of Kubelka–Munk function F against E (Fig. S3, ESI†).

The morphologies of UiO-67, SiW12@UiO-67 and SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS were characterized by SEM and TEM. As shown in Fig. 4a and b, UiO-67 display some cubes nanocrystals, together with some irregular nanolayers. The SiW12@UiO-67 sample shows cubic intergrown nanocrystals (Fig. 4c and d). The energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis demonstrates that SiW12 has been encapsuled in the UiO-67 framework (Fig. S5a†). The particle size of CdS nanoparticles are in the range of 30–60 nm. High resolution TEM (HRTEM) image shows clear lattice fringes of individual CdS nanoparticles with a spacing of 0.34 nm, which can be assigned to the (002) lattice planes of CdS. The MoS2 has a layered structure with interlayer spacing of ca. 0.61 nm, which correspond to the (002) planes of hexagonal MoS2 (Fig. S4, ESI†). Fig. 4c and f show that CdS nanoparticles decorated with M/G are dispersed on the SiW12@UiO-67 support. The EDX results prove that the coexistence of SiW12@UiO-67, M/G and CdS in the SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS composites (Fig. S5b†).

The X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analyses have been conducted to determine the surface chemical compositions and electronic state of SiW12@UiO-67 (Fig. S6, ESI†) and SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS (Fig. 5). The survey scan spectrum confirms the presence of Cd, Mo, S, C, Si, W, Zr and O in the composite sample, which indicates the successful synthesis of the composites SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS. The high-resolution XPS spectrum shows the binding energies of Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 at 405.0 and 411.7 eV. The two weak peaks at 228.3 and 231.5 eV correspond to the Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 level, respectively. In addition, the peaks of C 1s at 284.7, 285.9 and 288.5 eV are ascribed to the sp2-carbon species and oxygenated carbon species such as hydroxyl and carboxyl groups, respectively. The binding energy peaks of Zr at 182.4 and 184.7 eV are attributed to 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 of Zr4+, respectively. The peak at ca. 108.8 eV is assigned to the XPS spectrum of Si 2p. The binding energies of W 4f are located at 37.2 eV and 35.1 eV, respectively, which are consistent with the WVI oxidation state.35 The above results further prove that the coexistence of SiW12@UiO-67, M/G and CdS in the SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS composites as the EDX results.

The photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of M/G–CdS and SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS photocatalysts with different SiW12@UiO-67 contents was evaluated under visible light irradiation with lactic acid as a sacrificial reagent. As shown in Fig. 6, the H2 evolution rate of M/G–CdS is 0.63 mmol h−1. After the introduction of 5 wt% SiW12@UiO-67 in the composite photocatalyst, the rate of H2 evolution is increased to 0.76 mmol h−1. The optimum H2 production can be obtained when 30 wt% SiW12@UiO-67 is introduced in the composites, reaching 1.27 mmol h−1 in the presence of 5% M/G, which is about 2 times that of M/G–CdS. Taking a view of the overall activities, the content of SiW12@UiO-67 in the composites has a significant influence on the photocatalytic activity. The enhanced photocatalytic activity might be attributed to the large specific surface area of SiW12@UiO-67 and the effective heterostructure between SiW12@UiO-67 and CdS. However, with the amount of SiW12@UiO-67 increasing over 40 wt%, the hydrogen evolution rate of SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS decreases. It is because that excessive SiW12@UiO-67 will lead to the decrease of the content of CdS, which is the only visible-light-active component in the composites. For comparison, the photocatalytic H2 evolution activity of SiW12/M/G–CdS and UiO-67/M/G–CdS photocatalysts have also been evaluated under the same condition as shown in Fig. 7. As for the UiO-67-free composite SiW12/M/G–CdS and SiW12-free composite UiO-67/M/G–CdS, the H2 production activity is 0.71 and 0.75 mmol h−1, respectively, which is only a little higher than that over M/G–CdS. While for the composite photocatalyst SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS, the photocatalytic activity has a 2-fold increase, which is not the simple accumulation of H2 evolution over SiW12/M/G–CdS and UiO-67/M/G–CdS. In view of the ability of POMs to undergo fast, reversible, and stepwise multiple electron transfer reactions,36 the insertion of SiW12 into the porous UiO-67 could improve its ability to transfer electrons. Therefore, the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes could be accelerated and the fast recombination of charge carriers of CdS could be suppressed in the SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS composites. Fig. S7 (ESI†) shows the stability test of SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS sample for hydrogen evolution. It shows considerable durability in four consecutive runs of totally 24 h, which implied that the composite photocatalyst SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS has an enhanced photo-stability compared with the pure CdS. The gradual loss of the photocatalytic activities is due to the leaking of tiny amount of Cd2+ (about 2.0%) after the photocatalytic process.

To understand the electron transfer process in the composite photocatalyst, Mott–Schottky measurement was carried out to determine the LUMO of SiW12@UiO-67. Mott–Schottky analysis is based on the assumption that the capacitance of the space charge layer is much less than that of Helmholtz layer. The Mott–Schottky plot of the SiW12@UiO-67 film is shown in Fig. 8. There is a positive slope in the linear region of the plot, indicating that SiW12@UiO-67 is an n-type semiconductor. The LUMO potential of SiW12@UiO-67 is observed to be −0.29 V versus NHE (−0.93 V vs. SCE at pH = 6.8). According to a band gap of 3.5 eV as described above, the valence band (HOMO) can be calculated to be 3.21 V vs. NHE.

A tentative mechanism has been proposed for the improved H2 production activity of SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS as illustrated in Fig. 9. Under visible light illumination, the valence band (VB) electrons of CdS nanoparticles are excited to the conduction band (CB), creating holes in the VB simultaneously. Considering that the LUMO potential of SiW12@UiO-67 (−0.29 V) is lower than the CB of CdS, direct electron transfer from the CB of CdS to the LUMO of SiW12@UiO-67 is thermodynamically favourable. Previous studies have shown that the M/G co-catalyst could also accept electrons and further improve the charge separation, and act as active sites for H2 evolution.11 Therefore, the photo-generated electrons in the CB of CdS can either transfer to the LUMO of SiW12@UiO-67 and then to M/G to produce H2, or transfer directly to M/G for H2 evolution. The aforementioned electron transfer ways can effectively prolong the lifetime of the charge carriers and suppress the charge recombination, which in turn results in enhanced photocatalytic activity for H2 evolution.
 Fig. 9  Proposed mechanism of photocatalytic H2 production over SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS under visible-light. 
To provide additional evidence for the above proposed photocatalytic mechanism, the transient photocurrent experiments over CdS, M/G–CdS, UiO-67/M/G–CdS and SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS were performed under visible light. As shown in Fig. 10, pure CdS exhibits relative weak photocurrent due to its high recombination rate of photo-generated electrons and holes. Compared with pure CdS, the photocurrent of M/G–CdS and UiO-67/M/G–CdS increased, indicating that CB electrons of CdS can be injected into M/G or UiO-67. But the obvious photocurrent decays of UiO-67/M/G–CdS indicate that the recombination process still occurs. As for the SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS sample, the photocurrent increased further and exhibited a decreased decay compared with UiO-67/M/G–CdS, illustrating the improved charge transportation from CdS to SiW12@UiO-67 and/or M/G, and then to the working electrode surface. It suggests that the introduction of SiW12@UiO-67 and M/G into CdS can effectively separate the photogenerated electrons and holes, consequently reducing the recombination rate of photo-excited carriers and enhancing the production of photocurrent. The insertion of SiW12 into the porous UiO-67 could improve its ability to transfer electrons. These results are in accordance with the photocatalytic H2 production tests and could give support to the suggested mechanism.

4. Conclusions
The 12-tungstosilicic acid has been successfully encapsulated in the UiO-67 framework by solvothermal synthesis. The as-prepared SiW12@UiO-67 was used as a supporting matrix to support the CdS nanoparticles and M/G cocatalyst. The optimum H2 production over SiW12@UiO-67/M/G–CdS can be obtained when 30 wt% SiW12@UiO-67 is introduced in the composites, reaching 1.27 mmol h−1 in the presence of 5% M/G, which is about 2 times that of M/G–CdS. The enhanced photocatalytic activity was attributed to the large specific surface area of SiW12@UiO-67 and the effective heterostructure between SiW12@UiO-67 and CdS. It is also found that the insertion of SiW12 into the porous UiO-67 could improve its ability to transfer electrons. The present work may provide a new way to fabricate highly efficient POMs-contained heterostructure photocatalysts for photocatalytic H2 production.
