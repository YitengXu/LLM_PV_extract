    First published on 18th February 2019AbstractWith the advent of the Internet of Everything (IoE) era, our civilization and future generations will employ an unimaginable complex array of electronics and sensors in daily life. Ferroelectric polymers represent a core group of materials supporting the fast development of IoE, and their functionality, straightforward processing and unmatched versatility make them prime candidates for integration in multifaceted devices. Since they are highly selective, highly responsive, highly scalable, self-powering and compatible with flexible and stretchable substrates, they can be easily integrated with various electronics into numerous stand-alone objects and even into skin as sensors for monitoring diverse mechanical, thermal and vital parameters. They can also be used in combination with other sensor materials for harvesting waste energy from mechanical and thermal sources, for data storage and for actuation. This article reviews the up-to-date accomplishments in the ferroelectric polymer field, with focus on materials involving polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), and also discussed both their current advancement and future growth in the development of sustainable systems.

Introduction
The history of ferroelectricity can be traced back to 1675 when E. Seignette synthesized his famous “sel polychreste”, also known as the Rochelle salt (a double salt of tartaric acid containing both sodium and potassium), which was initially meant for medical purposes. In 1824, Sir David Brewster was first to demonstrate pyroelectric effects using Rochelle salts, naming the observed effect “pyroelectricity”. This discovery came nearly 100 years before modern times, when in 1921, Joseph Valasek, a student at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis discovered the peculiar dielectric properties of the Rochelle salt, establishing the modern concept of “Ferroelectricity”,1–3 which was followed by the work of C. W. Sawyer and C. H. Tower.4 Surprisingly the overarching phenomenon pyroelectricity has been known for 24 centuries, where the Greek philosopher Theophrastus presumably wrote the earliest known account in his treatise “On Stones”.5 He noted that the stone lyngourion (most probably the mineral tourmaline) becomes charged when heated, thus attracting bits of sawdust or straw. Interestingly, studies on ferroelectric polymers originated from the investigation of the piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of biological polymers. One of the early studies was the detection of piezoelectricity and pyroelectricity in parallel oriented bundles of wool and hair joined by shellac, which developed an electric potential in the range 1–10 V between tip and root when compressed or cooled to liquid–air temperature.6 Russian investigators carried out extensive research on the piezoelectricity of wood, where they reported that shear stress applied to oriented cellulose crystallites produced piezoelectric polarization.7 Moreover, in 1953, I. Yasuda discovered that if a long bone, such as the femur, is subjected to bending deformation, an electric potential is produced.8 Subsequently, E. Fukada and I. Yasuda found shear and longitudinal piezoelectricity in bone and tendon;9 whereas, S. B. Lang observed pyroelectricity in bone and tendon.10 In synthetic polymers, piezoelectricity has been observed in several synthetic polymers including polyaminoacids, polyhydroxybutyrates and their derivatives, and especially polyvinylidene fluoride, where H. Kawai was the first to discover its piezoelectricity.11 These early discoveries showed the unimaginable potential of ferroelectric polymers, which paved the way for the systematic research and development of these materials in products destined to monitor, assist, and ultimately simplify our existence.
In the development of modern society, many aspects of daily life revolve around communication and interaction among us or between us and the environment. In not too distant future, not only humans and smart machines will be prone to communicating, but objects themselves will continuously exchange information with their surroundings, while supporting and making our daily existence comfortable. Specifically, we will soon experience a transition from connectivity of people to connectivity of objects, technology and complex functions. This development is called the Internet of Everything (IoE) and its advent powers key social and industrial trends, such as smart cities, active assisted living, smart healthcare, structural health monitoring, collaborative robotics, and cyber physical systems, to name a few. A prerequisite for IoE are objects and machines that are equipped with interactive and communicative components, like a smart skin seamlessly integrated on the object's surface, which provides multimodal distributed sensing and certain input/output (I/O) and data processing functionalities.12–20 Accordingly, there is a strong requirement for sensor technologies that: (i) are easy to integrate on versatile materials over large areas and 3D formats, (ii) support multi-parameter sensing with certain spatial and temporal resolution, (iii) are smart considering smooth combination with user interfaces and data processing or transmission electronics, (iv) are sustainable with respect to energy consumption, (v) are slim and lightweight and (vi) can be manufactured via scalable,21 eco-friendly and low cost methods.22,23 The latter aspects highlight the further challenge of modern industrialized societies, namely resource efficiency and sustainability in energy and material consumption. Considering the concept of circular economy, researchers are continuously searching for materials that besides providing the desired electrical, optical, sensory, chemical, biological or mechanical functionality, can be obtained from natural sources, and are biocompatible and biodegradable or at least recyclable, thus allowing the development of eco-friendly, sustainable technologies.24,25
Ferroelectric polymers are characterized by: (i) multimodal sensitivity based on reversible piezo- and pyroelectric transduction, (ii) low energy consumption and even self-powering ability, (iii) mechanical flexibility, conformability and lightness, and (iv) facile processability. Thus, they are ideal candidates for the desirable development of sensitive and interactive object-skin technology. The latter is true especially if ferroelectric polymers are processed via scalable printing methods and combined with flexible electronic devices such as organic thin film transistors and circuits ideally based on natural or nature-derived (inspired) biodegradable dielectrics and semiconductors. A brief collection of the multifaceted applications of ferroelectric polymers is schematically displayed in Fig. 1.

In this review, we compile the most recent developments on multimodal sensors based on PVDF-derived materials, with special focus on sustainability aspects, which are discussed in three categories: (i) sustainable fabrication via scalable methods such as printing, which consume less energy and harmful chemicals, (ii) self-powering of printed sensors and development of PVDF-based flexible energy harvesters and (iii) recycling strategies and biodegradation possibilities for fluoropolymers. The first chapter provides a brief introduction to ferroelectric polymers in terms of their chemical composition, their structural, electrical and sensory properties, and methods of processing and structuring. The second chapter reviews the recent work on passive, solution-processed sensors for pressure, strain, vibrations, temperature and vital parameter monitoring in mono- and bimodal configurations. In the third chapter, the combination of ferroelectric sensors with organic thin film transistors is discussed, where ferroelectric polymer layers are either integrated monolithically in the transistor architecture or employed as a separate sensor device coupled to one of the transistor terminals. The fourth chapter concentrates on the printing techniques (in particular screen printing) for ferroelectric polymers, and their integration in printed devices, and chapter five presents some applications of printed ferroelectric sensors in IoE-related/inspired real world applications. Chapter six presents energy harvesters that use ferroelectric polymers in some form. Finally, chapter seven offers brief insights into sustainability issues and milestones that have to be reached to ensure a bright future for the next generation.
Although it is not a topic in this review, for the sake of completeness, it should be noted that chemical and biological sensors are increasingly integrated in smart skin patches for medical diagnostics and therapy,18,26–30 medical implants31,32 and other applications33 (refer to the excellent collection of reviews34 under the section Sensor Targets) due to the rapid advancement of stretchable (bio)electronics.21
1. Polyvinylidene fluoride and ferroelectric polymers: general overview
The ferroelectric nature of certain non-conductive materials manifests as two phenomena, namely (1) highly non-linear and hysteretic field dependence of the electric displacement when the material is subjected to an external electric field and (2) ferroelectric to paraelectric phase transition when the material is heated above the critical Curie temperature, Tc. In ferroelectrics, the pronounced hysteresis of the displacement is due to the built-in bi-stable spontaneous polarization originating from polar crystalline domains, which exists even when there is no applied field. Among the 21 non-centrosymmetric crystal classes, 10 classes are pyroelectric with spontaneous, and thus, thermodynamically stable polarization, which varies with temperature. Some of the pyroelectric materials are also ferroelectrics, where the spontaneous polarization is bi-stable, meaning that the polarization can be reversed repeatedly by an opposing electric field larger than the critical coercive field, Ec; thus, producing hysteresis in the electric displacement (Fig. 2b).35 The key parameter of any ferroelectric material is its remnant polarization, Pr, which is equivalent to the displacement at zero electric field, indicating the proportion of ordered crystalline domains and the magnitude of the reversible polarization in these domains. Polymer ferroelectrics are based on molecular repeat units, which have cooperating and strongly interacting permanent dipole moments, forming highly polar chains that have a strong tendency to align and fold together in lamellar crystallites.36,37 In contrast, some electrets may also show persistent external electric polarization and even hysteresis, which is metastable and originates from long relaxation times of charge trapping after field reversal.38

(a) Schematic of the transformation process from an α-crystal spherulite to a β-crystal of PVDF by mechanical uniaxial drawing with corresponding images from stress polarization microscopy taken upon in situ observation of the transformation during stretching. The transition region starts from the middle of the spherulite with an extension of the α-phase molecular chains along the stretching direction (deformation of the α-phase) followed by expansion of the extended chains transversely along the middle (emerging of β-phase) and finally the entire spherulite transforms into the β-phase under large deformation with more and more extended chains being formed.

All layers were fabricated by screen printing and the thickness of the ferroelectric and electrode layers was about 6 μm and 300 nm, respectively. The remnant polarization, Pr, and the coercive field, Ec, are indicated by arrows. The displacement curve was generated by integration of the area-normalized poling current curve.

The prototypical and most popular ferroelectric polymer is polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), which is based on the CH2–CF2 vinylidene (VDF) monomer with two fluorine and two hydrogen atoms bonded to its carbon backbone. It is a semi-crystalline polymer with a crystallinity of 50%, consisting of ordered regions embedded in an amorphous dipolar matrix. The piezoelectricity of PVDF was discovered by H. Kawai in 1969.11 Its ferroelectric nature was revealed in 1971 by J. G. Bergman and coworkers, who observed pyroelectricity in PVDF (an unambiguous fingerprint of any ferroelectric material)39 and by R. G. Kepler and R. A. Anderson in 1978, who discovered the axial re-orientation of the PVDF crystalline regions under electric poling by X-ray diffraction.40 By measuring the electric displacement under high electric fields D(E), Furukawa et al. finally demonstrated the non-linearity and the hysteresis loop of the polarization in PVDF.41 There are only a few other polymers with confirmed ferroelectric behavior such as odd nylons and polyureas;36,38,42 however, they suffer from reduced backbone flexibility due to their inhibiting hydrogen bonds and are consequently difficult to switch. This is also true for certain cyanopolymers, which show charge hysteresis and dielectric anomalies, but no unambiguous evidence of ferroelectricity, and therefore are classified as metastable electrets.38
PVDF is indeed a special material, primarily because of its compact linear molecular structure and its supple backbone. Thorough investigations of the crystalline structure of PVDF revealed up to five polymorphs,43,44 where the ferroelectric β-phase with the highest polarization has a unit cell consisting of two chains in an all-trans conformation. In this conformation the hydrogen atoms of each repeat unit are oppose to the fluorine atoms, resulting in a large molecular dipole moment of 7 × 10−30 C m that is oriented perpendicular to the chain axis.45 Due to parallel chain packing in the β-phase the monomer dipoles are all pointing in the same direction thus giving rise to a large spontaneous polarization Ps = 130 mC m−2 in the crystallite unit cell.46 PVDF belongs to the class of so-called “order–disorder” ferroelectric materials characterized by a transition from randomly oriented dipoles in the paraelectric phase to ordered dipoles in the ferroelectric phase.38 The PVDF β-phase is achieved either by solidification from the melt under high pressure, by poling under very high fields (∼500 MV m−1) or by uniaxial cold drawing (stretching) of extruded PVDF films, which forces the chains in the polar all-trans conformation, with the latter being the most common industrial process employed in the synthesis of ferroelectric PVDF.47Fig. 2a schematically illustrates the transformation of the α-phase made of spherulite crystals to the β-phase upon stretching. By in situ observation with a stress polarization microscope, it was demonstrated that the transition starts in the center, where the stretching produces extended α-chains that gradually transform into β-chains with increased deformation.48 In contrast, solution casting or melt-solidification of pure PVDF under ambient conditions usually generates the nonpolar and paraelectric α-phase, which is thermodynamically more stable than the ferroelectric β-phase. This paraelectric phase consists of antiparallel packed chains in a trans–gauche conformation.46
Extruded and stretched ferroelectric PVDF films are commercially available with thicknesses between 9–110 μm,49 formats up to ∼8′′ × 11′′ and even metallized surfaces.50 These films are employed in many versatile commercial applications such as passive angle-selective motion detectors from Siemens,51 which were available in the 1980s under the brand name PID11, hydrophones from RP. Acoustics,52 clamp-on pressure transducers for diesel injection lines from AVL,53 contact microphones from Cold Gold,54 film speakers from Fils,55 versatile gauges such as shock gauges from Arkema,56 and even dust particle flux sensors in space.57,58 Although these examples prove the usability, robustness and reliability of ferroelectric PVDF films in product environments, their range of accessible applications is still limited due to the constraints in their film thickness, design freedom, spatial resolution, available areas and assembly toolkits. In particular, considering the IoE application scenario introduced before, there is a strong need for ferroelectric polymer materials that can be directly applied on versatile substrates via solution-based methods such as spin coating, solution or rod casting, ink jetting and screen printing; thus, enabling maximum freedom in geometry, electrode design and layer setup.
Direct crystallization of PVDF-based materials into the polar β-phase from the melt or from solution under ambient conditions is easily achieved by introducing a structurally similar molecule such as trifluoroethylene (TrFE) to a certain percentage. TrFE, where one of the hydrogens is replaced by the slightly larger fluorine, forms stable copolymers with VDF. Due to steric hindrance, the TrFE defects force the copolymer chains into the all-trans conformation, leading to the ferroelectric β-phase, which is the only stable crystalline phase of P(VDF–TrFE). Copolymers with 20–50% TrFE are especially interesting because in contrast to pure PVDF, they have a Curie point (Tc) below their melting temperature (Tm), which allows for sample annealing between Tc and Tm, thus inducing a noticeable increase in crystallinity.46 In addition, the existence of two-dimensional ferroelectricity was demonstrated for highly ordered few monolayer-thick P(VDF–TrFE)70:30 Langmuir–Blodgett films, revealing that the ferroelectric state is generated predominantly by in-plane coupling in ultrathin films.59 Solution-based processing of P(VDF–TrFE) copolymers typically results in semi-crystalline thin films, where the polarization directions of the crystallites are randomly oriented. To maximize the macroscopic polarization across the sample volume, the crystalline dipoles have to be aligned parallel in an external electric field. Fig. 2b illustrates this so-called electrical poling for a screen-printed layer of P(VDF–TrFE)70:30 (i.e. VDF:TrFE = 70:30 mol%) embedded between two electrode layers composed of the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS). Electrical poling of ferroelectric thin films is performed most reliably via application of a low frequency AC-voltage with a stepwise increasing amplitude up to a maximum of at least twice the critical voltage, Vc, which corresponds to the coercive electric field (Ec) applied via the layer thickness of the sample. The re-orientation and switching of the dipoles appear as a peak of the poling current, Ipoling(E), around Ec (see black curve in Fig. 2b), resulting in a field-induced current hysteresis. In Fig. 2b, the dipole switching can be visualized as an axial rotation of the copolymer chains, corresponding to either the upward or downward dipole orientation. From the integration of the poling current hysteresis, the displacement hysteresis D(E) can be extracted, exhibiting the typical polarization hysteresis loop (see blue curve in Fig. 2b). The remnant polarization states, ±Pr, can be denoted as “1” or “0”, corresponding to the well-established binary nonvolatile memory states.
The spontaneous polarization of P(VDF–TrFE) strongly depends on its composition, namely the molar ratio between VDF and TrFE. In the late 80s, T. Furukawa derived an empirical relation for the dependence of Pr on the VDF content (see dashed line and open circles in Fig. 2c).46,60 For a small VDF content, he observed no ferroelectricity due to the decrease in the molecular dipole moment upon the incorporation of the less polar TrFE units. Starting with about a 50 mol% VDF content, the Pr increased rapidly, reaching a maximum of ∼100 mC m−2 around 80 mol% VDF, but then decreased again to 50 mC m−2 for pure PVDF. The decrease in Pr for VDF-rich compositions is due to the decrease in crystallinity, which is only ∼50% in PVDF. This illustrates that the ferroelectricity is also strongly influenced by the crystallinity of the polymer layer; therefore, not only the composition, but also the layer processing can decisively change the ferroelectric performance. Fig. 2c presents Pr data from the literature for copolymer layers with different compositions and different layer processing methods.
It is obvious that the spin-coated layers, typically resulting in layer thickness values between 200 and 500 nm, deliver higher polarization than the screen- and inkjet-printed layers. On the one hand, the higher Pr is due to the fact that thermal annealing of thin films above their Curie point will induce: (i) the growth of larger ferroelectric crystalline lamellae at the expense of amorphous regions, resulting in higher crystallinity and (ii) lower film surface roughness, and thus more stable poling conditions.46,64,65,70 Both effects are credited for generating stronger ferroelectricity in P(VDF–TrFE). On the other hand it was reported that ultrathin films with thicknesses of d < 100 nm showed strongly decreased crystallinity, which is attributed to the crystallization process being controlled by heterogeneous nucleation from the substrate with high nucleation density and orientation mismatch between neighboring crystallites.73 In thick films (such as screen-printed films with d > 1 μm) these two effects may become important. Firstly, the temperature-induced crystallite growth increase cannot be as effective over a larger sample volume as in thin films (d < 1 μm) and secondly, the layer quality of printed films is typically inferior with more defects and voids, thus limiting the maximum applicable poling field. It has been reported that for the parallel alignment of all crystalline dipoles (and thus for obtaining complete poling), the necessary poling field at room temperature is 100 MV m−1, which is approximately twice the critical field, Ec.74
In terms of composition ferroelectric nanoparticles such as lead zirconate titanate (PZT)75 or barium titanate (BTO)76 were dispersed in a P(VDF–TrFE) matrix to generate nanocomposite layers with enhanced ferroelectric properties. In contrast, blending of copolymers with reduced graphene oxide nanosheets (rGO) did not increase the ferroelectricity, but the sensitivity of these nanocomposite layers to mechanical and thermal excitation.77,78
Besides conventional lab-scale thin film processing such as spin coating and solution casting or scalable, industry-fit coating techniques such as printing, several micro- and nanopatterning techniques are applied to ferroelectric polymers to induce certain geometric confinements, and thus improve their crystallinity and chain orientation. Electrospinning has proven to be a powerful technique for generating free-standing ferroelectric films or fabrics made of horizontally aligned microfibers or nanowires.79–83 A beneficial aspect of this method is that the high electric field applied during electrospinning induces in situ poling of the spun wires and fibers. However, a disadvantage is the limitation in the homogeneous film sizes produced with this technique. Another process that makes poling obsolete and is ideal for the fabrication of ferroelectric fabrics and textiles is drawing (or melt spinning extrusion) of fibers, which, allows the manufacture of fibers with core–shell structures made of coaxially layered conductive and ferroelectric materials.84,85 Template-assisted infiltration in membranes or porous matrices can generate perfectly oriented, high aspect ratio nanostructures of PVDF and P(VDF–TrFE) with higher polarization and lower coercive field than their bulk counterparts, but it also suffers from a lack of perspective for upscaling.86,87 Finally, nanoimprinting-related techniques are often used to fabricate vertically oriented regular arrays of micro- and nanoscale pillars, domes and pyramids. Consequently, in some cases, an improvement in ferroelectric properties (such as reduction of Ec)88–90 and higher sensitivity78,91–95 is achieved. Furthermore, the decrease in feature sizes, and thus increase in the integration density may become a game changer in non-volatile memory applications.89,96 An overview of the methods and results regarding nanopatterning of ferroelectric polymers was provided by Cauda et al.97Fig. 3a schematically illustrates the various morphological structures realized for P(VDF–TrFE) layers.
 Fig. 3  Structure of ferroelectric polymer sensors and harvesters and how they work. (a) P(VDF–TrFE) layer morphologies as realized in different sensors and nanogenerator setups. P(VDF–TrFE) is manufactured as a thin film by spin coating or printing, (free standing) webs made of statistically aligned electrospun or drawn nanowires/microfibers, horizontally aligned nanowires/microfibers made by electrospinning, and vertically aligned arrays of nanowires, micropillars, micropyramids and microdomes made by nanoimprinting/embossing, template-assisted molding/infiltration and electrohydrodynamic pulling. (b) Functional principle of piezo- and pyroelectric sensors and nanogenerators in a plate capacitor configuration, where the ferroelectric layer with the macroscopic polarization P3 is sandwiched between the electrode layers. There is no external electric field applied. External mechanical stress variations dσ33 (tensile stress transverse to film plane), dσ11 (tensile stress longitudinal in film plane) and thermal fluctuations dT will induce changes in the dipole density across the sample volume, and thus change P3. For the bending mode the dashed line indicates that the neutral mechanical plane is located deep in the substrate, whose thickness is much higher than that of the sensor (not scaled appropriately here). Accordingly, the sensor located on the upper substrate surface experiences tensile strain. The polarization change, dP3, will result in fluctuations in the charge density at the electrodes, delivering either a piezo- or pyroelectric current, Ipiezo or Ipyro, respectively. The material parameters, which couple the mechanical or thermal excitations to the fluctuations of the polarization, are the piezoelectric coefficients d33 and d31 and the pyroelectric coefficient p3. 
Piezo- and pyroelectricity are two intrinsic properties of ferroelectric materials, which determine most of their attractive properties and are why ferroelectrics have such widespread applications, ranging from sensors, memories and actuators to user interfaces, acoustic devices and energy harvesters. Fig. 3b illustrates both effects for a ferroelectric polymer layer embedded between two electrodes in the form of a plate capacitor with no applied external electric field. If we assume that as a result of appropriate poling or fabrication procedure the macroscopic polarization, P, of the ferroelectric layer is predominantly oriented normal to the film plane, i.e. P ∼ P3, compensation charges will accumulate at the electrodes to screen the polarization. The volume density model for the direct piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric polymers is as follows. Applying a time-varying tensile stress dσ33 > 0 transverse to the film plane will decrease the dipole density over the increased ferroelectric layer thickness; whereas, a tensile stress dσ11 > 0 longitudinal to the film plane will increase it due to a decrease in the layer thickness (transversal contraction). The change in dipole density will induce a negative or positive change in the polarization, dP3, which has to be compensated by a respective change in the charge density at the electrodes, namely a decrease for dσ33 > 0 and an increase for dσ11 > 0. This can be measured as a positive (negative) current response, Ipiezo, to the transversal (longitudinal) tensile stress. The parameter that couples stress and polarization changes is called the piezoelectric coefficient, d, which is a 3rd rank tensor with d33 and d31 being the most important components for PVDF-based ferroelectrics. The determination of the piezoelectric coefficient, i.e. d33, is achieved by clamping the sample and subjecting it to a low frequency force. The comparison of the electrical signals derived from the sample in comparison to a built-in reference gives a direct reading of d33. The method of operation of this type of d33 meter is called the “quasi-static” or “Berlincourt” method (e.g. d33 piezometer systems by Piezotest98). The key principle is that the test frequency is below any sample resonances, yet high enough that a conclusive measurement can be made within a few seconds.
A similar effect is known as pyroelectricity (see bottom line in Fig. 3b). Applying a temperature change dT to the device will increase or decrease the molecular thermal movements in the chains, depending on whether the temperature is enhanced or reduced, and thus decrease or increase the macroscopic polarization, P3, respectively. Again, the T-modulation induced change, dP3, has to be compensated by a change in charge density, resulting in a pyroelectric current, Ipyro. The parameter that couples temperature and polarization changes is called the pyroelectric coefficient, p3, and it is a 1st rank tensor. On the macroscopic level, the pyroelectric coefficient is determined by lock-in measurement of the out-of-phase component of the current response induced by temperature modulations in the sample with a Peltier element; whereas, on the microscopic level, mapping of p3 was demonstrated by a high-resolution scanning technique regarded as the equivalent to piezoelectric force microscopy called pyroelectric scanning probe microscopy.99
Piezo- and pyroelectricity are reversible; thus, depending on the experimental conditions, the application of an electric field can result in converse piezoelectricity,100 namely the internal generation of a mechanical strain or an entropy/temperature change (electrocaloric effect).101 The piezo- and pyroelectric coefficients are material-intrinsic parameters, where for well-poled ferroelectric copolymer thin films with high Pr, the piezoelectric coefficients are d33 ∼ −30 to 35 pC N−1 and d31 ∼ 10–12 pC N−1, respectively.66,102 Nano patterning and geometric confinement can enhance these values,97 where the maximum reported d33 value was −210 pC N−1 for nanoimprinted sub-20 nm copolymer nanograss.103
The pyroelectric coefficient is highest for copolymer thin films with a preferably small Curie temperature, which indicates compositions with a high TrFE-content. For copolymers with 45 mol% TrFE, p ∼ −50 to 55 μC m−2 K−1;75 whereas, 25 mol% TrFE compositions deliver p ∼ −42 to 48 μC m−2 K−1.66 Interestingly, composites of P(VDF–TrFE) copolymers with ceramic ferroelectric nanoparticles such as PbTiO3 and PZT have been reported to show an enhanced pyroelectric coefficient of p ∼ −90 to 96 μC m−2 K−1;67,75,104 whereas, the piezoelectric coefficient remains constant.
Pyro- and piezoelectricity are attractive characteristics of ferroelectric polymers that can not only be exploited for sensors, but also for charge storage devices in the form of non-volatile memories, energy harvesting devices for transducing waste mechanical to electrical energy, and actuators by using the converse piezoelectric effect. These aspects will not be discussed here, instead one can refer to several past reviews,105–108 as well as the very recent review by X. Chen et al.109
As already emphasized in the introduction, for more sophisticated IoE relevant applications, it is essential that ferroelectric polymer sensors be integrated on versatile, in particular flexible and conformable materials and on 3D objects, and fabricated via scalable and low-cost methods. Moreover it is important that such sensors be sustainable regarding energy consumption during operation and fabrication (grey energy); thus, they should be lightweight, low-energy consuming or even self-powering and manufactured via eco-friendly methods. In this context, the most promising technique for the fabrication of ferroelectric polymer sensors is printing since it is eco-friendly considering its low processing temperatures, involves only harmless chemicals (e.g. aqueous functional inks) and allows large-area and low-cost fabrication on flexible and lightweight substrates. More insight into this fabrication method will be offered in Section 4.
2. Flexible sensors made of PVDF-based materials: route towards self-powered multimodal physical sensors
2.1 Force, pressure, strain, and bending
The piezoelectric effect in PVDF and its derivatives has been exploited extensively for the detection of mechanical excitations such as force, pressure, compressive and tensile strain, tactile sensation, vibration, acceleration and acoustic waves. Besides their large frequency bandwidth, good sensitivity, high robustness and reliability and facile processability, a key feature of piezoelectric polymer sensors is that they, as intrinsic charge generators, are self-powering and only need a ground connection for one of their electrodes. This is a tremendous advantage for sustainability and integratability in mobile, wearable and hard-to-access devices and objects over competing sensor technologies that are capacitive or exploit the piezoresistive effect.
Stretched extruded PVDF-based films were investigated for sensing the complex motions of crawling artificial minirobots,110 the surface texture of fabrics,111 the z-directional strength in paper fiber bonds,112 pneumatic pressures,113 and impact dependence on the elasticity of the supporting material.114 Moreover, in the form of dual-mode flexible diaphragms, piezoelectric films were tested for sensing intracranial pressure,115 loading of biological molecules/microbia116 and as large bandwidth transducer arrays with distributed electrodes for spatially resolved tactile sensing in robotic skins.117 Very recently, PVDF films were embedded in a wireless milling cutter system to monitor the cutting forces acting on a single milling tooth, with the advantage of being more lightweight and less bulky than standard dynamometers.118
A better adapted and more conformable integration with test specimens, substrates and sensor setups is possible if the piezoelectric polymer layers are fabricated in the form of micro-patterned thin films or in the form of fibers and fabrics. Li et al. reported dome- and bump-shaped PVDF copolymer sensor layers fabricated via spin coating or screen printing and patterned by a mold-transfer technique, which were assembled as tactile sensors on complex shapes such as microcatheters.119 Schulze et al. demonstrated a low-cost uniaxial accelerometer composed of a P(VDF–TrFE) transducer film directly integrated with a micro-injection molded mass-loaded cantilever made of polypropylene.120 Fibrous piezoelectric sensors were integrated in 2D force-sensing textiles121 and as an artificial micro/nano hair receptor for air flow detection in jumping minirobots.122 Electrospinning was used to fabricate aligned, in situ poled PVDF fibers on printed Ag nanoparticle or Ag nanowire electrodes,123 and also to generate a dense web of PVDF fibers for force sensors.124 Sharma et al. tested perfectly aligned electrospun high density P(VDF–TrFE) nanofibers and core–shell nanofibers (with piezoelectric cores and conductive PEDOT:PSS shells) for conformable pressure sensing in endovascular applications, and demonstrate their precise detection of inflation/deflation of balloon catheters under simulated in vitro conditions.80

Fig. 4a displays a flexible three-axial tactile sensor consisting of a hot embossed array of P(VDF–TrFE) copolymer micropillars sandwiched between four Au electrode pairs and integrated on a polyimide (PI) film; thus, resulting in four distributed square-sized flexible piezoelectric sensor units.91 For better transfer of the applied forces to the micropillar array, the sensor was covered with a pyramid-shaped elastomer bump made of PDMS. This setup was highly sensitive to both compressive and tensile strains and could measure and distinguish between vertical and shear forces with three-axial sensitivities in the range of 0.3–0.4 V N−1.

(a) Flexible three-axial tactile sensor based on a P(VDF–TrFE) micropillar array sandwiched between four square electrode pairs and covered with a pyramid-shaped PDMS bump for optimized force distribution to the pillar array. With the four distributed piezoelectric sensing units both vertical and shear force can be detected with sensitivities in the range of 0.3–0.4 V N−1.

(b) Transparent piezoelectric nanogenerator matrix allowing for multistage mechanosensation based on a copolymer ferroelectric film sandwiched between two PDMS sheets with patterned graphene electrodes. The sensor matrix responds to tensile and compressive strain (1st stage) and detects the area of the detached and released top PDMS sheet (2nd stage), both with high temporal and spatial accuracy. The sensitivity upon vertical force was improved by the groove pattern in the bottom PDMS sheet, resulting in a sensitivity of 0.16 V N−1 for pressures <20 kPa.

As illustrated by the highly anisotropic elliptic profile of the 2D FFT of the SEM images, the joints of the nanofibers do not decrease their parallel alignment. Dynamic bending tests and voltage response as a function of the thickness of the PI support (red line = 75 μm, green line = 150 μm, and blue line = 225 μm). A pressure sensor sheet with attached mass showed perfectly linear dependence on the voltage output on the orientation angle.

(d) Composite PVDF/rGO films (1–10% rGO) with molded microdome array surfaces fabricated on Au-metallized PET sheets. By laminating two of the sheets, interlocking of the microdomes was achieved. These interlocked microdome films were sensitive to static and dynamic pressures with ∼5 nA kPa−1 sensitivity above and 35 nA kPa−1 below 2.45 kPa and were superior to planar PVDF and PVDF/rGO composite films. According to the increase in the proportion of the piezoelectric channel at the expense of the piezoresistive channel in dynamic events, the voltage and current response both increased with frequency upon sequential impact pressure loading against a static load of about 9 kPa. Reproduced with permission from ref. 78 Copyright 2015, American Association for the Advancement of Science. 
Recently, a self-powered matrix for multistage mechanosensation was reported by Q. Zhang et al.,125 as shown in Fig. 4b. A P(VDF–TrFE) layer was sandwiched between graphene electrodes on PDMS sheets, with the latter accounting for the transparency of the piezoelectric, and thus strain sensitive nanogenerator. Each sensing unit responded to compressive and tensile strain upon bending in the first stage and also detected the subsequent detachment and release of the sheets in the second sensing stage, as well as quantified the detached areas. The matrix configuration allowed both the temporal and spatial characteristics of the detachment event to be recorded, and thus was able to detect hand flexing and finger lifting when the sensor matrix was attached to the palm of a human or robotic hand. Improvement of the sensitivity with respect to vertical pressure was achieved with microgroove patterns in the PDMS support film, especially in a pressure regime of <20 kPa.
Using an optimized electrospinning process based on a fast rotating collector disk, highly-aligned arrays of copolymer nanofibers were fabricated, resulting in freestanding piezo- and pyroelectric sheets (Fig. 4c).79 The nanofibers were in situ poled and developed multiple mesoscopic joints, strongly increasing the mechanical robustness while not disturbing the parallel nanofiber alignment, as illustrated by the anisotropic profile of the 2D FFT scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and the small full-width at half maximum of the radial intensity distribution. After assembling on PI supports, these piezoelectric sheets (with Cu electrodes attached to their sides) showed superior pressure sensitivity up to 1.1 V kPa−1 with a detection threshold of only 0.1 Pa. Their high mechanical robustness allowed for up to 1000 bending cycles, where the current and voltage response increased with frequency and PI thickness. These nanofiber sheets were tested as mechanically flexible accelerometers and, after attaching a test mass, also as orientation sensors.
Finally, a fingertip skin-inspired micropatterned composite film of PVDF with 1–10 wt% reduced graphene oxide (PVDF/rGO) was reported, which exhibited simultaneous piezoresistive and piezoelectric sensitivity. It could detect static pressures down to 0.6 Pa due to its piezoresistive sensing channel and dynamic pressures up to the kHz regime due to its piezoelectric sensing channel.78 As illustrated in Fig. 4d, the interlocked microdomes on the PVDF/rGO surfaces increase the response to both static and dynamic pressures, resulting in sensing films that were superior to planar PVDF and PVDF/rGO composite films.
A compilation of the different technologies for force and pressure sensors with a capacitive layout (no OTFT pressure sensors are included) is presented in Table 1.

2.2 Sound, vibration, acceleration, and tactile sensation
Acoustic wave detection and vibration sensing are also very important applications of piezoelectric polymer sensors, especially for flexible, tailored and slim acoustic devices such as ultrathin microphones or lightweight low-cost speakers and as conformal sensors for structural health monitoring. The application of PVDF films as vibration sensors was recently amply reviewed elsewhere,134 and thus will not be elaborated here. In 2010, a paper was published from Tokyo University reporting ferroelectric PVDF films with patterned Ni electrodes that were laminated to an organic transistor active matrix fabricated on flexible PI sheets and the combination was tested as a flexible ultrasonic 3D imaging system.135 Rathod et al.136 investigated hot-pressed and poled PVDF-films for measuring large magnitude quasi-static and dynamic strains at ultrasonic frequencies (∼100 kHz), which showed superior performances than PZT sensors. Furthermore, the measurement of the transient response to dynamic strain in a cantilever was reported to be more accurate with PVDF films than with standard strain gauges in terms of sensitivity and resonance frequency detection.137 PVDF films with transparent electrodes were combined with optical sensors in a layered setup for the simultaneous testing of the optical, electrical and vibrational properties of different materials such as black acrylic, clear glass, silver aluminum, white PTFE and sponges with different hardness.138 Both the distance between the sensor and material surface and the material hardness could be successfully identified.
In more sophisticated configurations, the vibration sensitivity of PVDF-based layers and films was enhanced by micro/nanopatterning and geometric confinement. A multilayered parylene-coated and metallized PVDF thin film with a micro-embossed wavy-shaped geometry was integrated with an epoxy detection head to form an acoustic emission sensor (see Fig. 5a). It showed a higher signal to noise ratio and resolution than the reference PZT sensor over an operating bandwidth in the range of 10 kHz to 1.4 MHz. With a displacement sensitivity of 1 mV nm−1, this acoustic emission sensor could successfully monitor each step in the drilling process of a composite plastic-copper board.131

(b) Microphone based on two metallized ferroelectric sheets made of a composite of PVDF/rGO (1 wt% rGO) each with a micropatterned surface, which in close connection, form a ferroelectric device with interlocked microdomes.

As shown in Fig. 5b, the already mentioned human skin-inspired sensor based on a PVDF/rGO composite film sandwich with surfaces of interlocked microdomes was a very sensitive film microphone that could precisely detect sound.78 It could monitor letters and a full sentence of acoustic waveforms and transduce it to perfectly matching voltage waveforms better than a commercial microphone. Also, the report about a fully transparent acoustic actuator and nanogenerator with a broad bandwidth (up to 3 kHz) based on graphene/P(VDF–TrFE)/graphene films is interesting.139 In a different application, a wearable PVDF film sensor could monitor skin-propagated vibration when the fingertip touched an object, where materials with different textures such as paper, a bumpy plate and acrylic glass could be distinguished (Fig. 5c).132
The work by Lang et al. is quite impressive, in which they demonstrated very efficient acoustic-to-electric conversion based on electrospun P(VDF–TrFE) nanofiber webs sandwiched between Au-metallized PET films with a very high sensitivity of 266 mV Pa−1 to low-frequency sound pressure (200 Hz) (Fig. 5d).83 The nanofiber-based acoustic sensor exhibited excellent ability to distinguish sound waves in the low to middle frequency region due to its high resolution (50 MHz), and could record voice, and is therefore especially useful for noise detection applications.
Another highlight is represented by the multi-material core–shell P(VDF–TrFE) based piezoelectric fibers processed by thermal drawing, which were capable of acoustic emission and detection over a broad range of frequencies (10s of Hz to 10s of MHz). A woven fabric made of rectangular-shaped piezoelectric-modulated optical fibers each with an integrated Fabry–Perot resonator structure was demonstrated.84 This concept was further improved by increasing the effective piezoelectric area in the fibers (Fig. 5e). The large degree of freedom in controlling acoustic fields was imparted by the increased performance and mechanical flexibility of the fibers. Acoustic wave front shaping by tuning the fiber curvature such as beam focusing by fiber bending and use of multi-fiber phased arrays for coherent interferences and beam steering were demonstrated.133
2.3 Vital parameters
The sensing of vital parameters such as the pulse and respiratory rate and motion in humans is one of the most interesting application fields of ferroelectric sensor skins. Here, the proven biocompatibility of PVDF-based materials is a prerequisite (PVDF is used as implants,140 for example surgical mesh141); whereas their ferroelectricity is an advantage for biomedical application developers since pyro- and piezoelectricity are common in many regions of the human body.10,142 Accordingly, PVDF has been investigated for tissue engineering to repair and regenerate human tissue,143 such as in the form of composite piezoelectric membranes for bone regeneration.144 Dopamine-functionalized BTO nanoparticles were dispersed in a PVDF copolymer matrix to form a membrane with an electrically tunable surface potential (by poling); thus, allowing the physiological electric microenvironment to be restored and to conform to the level of endogenous biopotential (see Fig. 6a). The as-improved galvanotaxis increased bone stem cell migration and osteogenic differentiation. In vivo, the membranes sustainably maintained the electric microenvironment, giving rise to rapid bone regeneration and complete mature bone-structure formation.

(a) Nanocomposite membrane films made of polydopamine-coated BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles dispersed in a P(VDF–TrFE) matrix for optimized bone regeneration via enhanced migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) followed by encouraged differentiation into osteoblasts. The surface potential of the membrane was tuned by electric poling to conform to the level of endogenous biopotential; thus, mimicking the electric microenvironment for optimum cell function and tissue repair. Micro-CT and sagittal view images and histological sections 4 and 12 weeks after implantation demonstrate the bone defect repair in rat calvarial models after implantation of polarized nanomembranes with 5 vol% BTO and polarized neat P(VDF–TrFE) membranes (NB, nascent bone; MC, medullary cavity; V blood vessel; OT, osteoid tissue; and MT, mineralized tissue).

(c) Ferroelectric skin with pressure sensing layer made of two interlocked microdome sheets for monitoring artery pulse pressure waveforms at different skin temperatures (20–40 °C) and before/after exercise. The radial artery augmentation index AIR = P2/P1 and the radial diastolic augmentation index DAI = P3/P1 decreased linearly with temperature. The texture perception of this skin was enhanced by an elastomer groove texture on the electrode surface, which allowed the perception of textures with different roughness, as shown by the short-time Fourier transform spectra of the current response for scanning at 2.5 mm s−1.

The monitoring of cardiorespiratory signals with exact pulse waveforms with the help of ferroelectric polymer based film devices was demonstrated in several reports, such as: (i) heart rate monitoring with a highly-sensitive wearable pressure sensor based on a free-standing ZnO nanoneedle/PVDF hybrid thin film with a detection limit of only 4 Pa, which was wirelessly connected to a smartphone via a printed graphene antenna;145 (ii) differentiation of heart pulse waves between different persons and during exercise;146 (iii) sensing of pulse, swallowing and sound via self-powered composite fiber sensor patches integrated on the neck;81 (iv) respiration monitoring under dynamic walking conditions;147 and (v) detection of cardiorespiratory signals via PVDF films mounted on the chest wall with ballistocardiography.148
Chen et al. presented a self-powered flexible pressure sensor with vertically aligned in situ poled P(VDF–TrFE) nanowires, which were grown in a highly aligned form by an electric field-supported template-assisted electro-hydrodynamic process (Fig. 6b).95 The flexible piezoelectric sensor possessed PEDOT:PSS top electrodes and showed sufficient sensitivity to monitor finger motion, breathing, pulse and low magnitude sound pressure levels.
Precise resolution of wrist artery pulse waveforms for different skin temperatures before/after exercise was possible with the multifunctional ferroelectric skin with interlocked microdomes (see Fig. 6c).78 Several important waveform parameters for example the radial artery augmentation index, AIR, could be measured as a function of the skin temperature. By fabricating a fingerprint-inspired micro-patterned elastomer film on the top electrode of this skin, the perception of texture was demonstrated upon scanning over surfaces with different roughness values.
Real-time human motion monitoring was nicely demonstrated with a wireless piezoelectric device consisting of an electrospun PVDF–BaTiO3 NW nanocomposite fiber web as the sensor and a wireless circuit system. This wireless device allowed motion signals excited by squatting, walking and running to be displayed on a smartphone when the sensor was integrated into the insole of a shoe; monitoring of elbow flexion and detection of voice were also demonstrated (Fig. 6d).82 A self-powered sensor based on electrospun PVDF fibers on a grooved Cu foil tape was reported to monitor motion and measure air/wind flow velocity.149
2.4 Temperature and IR
The pyroelectric effect allows for the detection of temperature modulations and long-wavelength IR-radiation.150 In the past, the pyroelectricity of PVDF-based materials was mainly exploited for IR-sensor-arrays151,152 for detection of human proximity.51
Binnie et al. developed a 16 × 16 IR sensor array based on PVDF-on-silicon CMOS technology, which consisted of a pre-poled 9 μm thin PVDF film coated with a continuous layer of PEDOT:PSS serving as both the IR-absorbing layer and top electrode (Fig. 7a).153 This film was deposited on a silicon substrate with a patterned and reflecting metal layer as the bottom electrode and a subpixel integrated low noise CMOS charge amplifier. The pyroelectric detector had very high sensitivity of 2200 V W−1 at 100 Hz and could be used for thermal imaging, but suffered from a lack of mechanical flexibility. This was also true for another type of silicon integrated P(VDF–TrFE) detector, for which better thermal insulation of the sensor film from the silicon substrate and the read-out electronics was achieved by application of pyroelectric copolymer thin films on silicon carriers locally back-etched or coated with thick polymer layers.63

(c) ZnO nanorods/nanodisks embedded in PVDF film coated on an rGO-treated PET film with inkjet-printed rGO top electrode. The change in resistance ΔR upon loading of 30 Pa was highest for the PVDF/ZnO nanorods; whereas, their response and recovery times were smaller compared to that for nanodisks or pure PVDF thin films. Both the magnitude and recovery time of ΔR increased with the temperature, which allowed both the pressure and temperature of water droplets impacting on the sensor to be simultaneously measured.

The monitoring of local temperatures of biological fluids in a microfluidic chip with a PVDF film as functional cover layer was reported recently by Pullano et al.154 Buchberger et al.155,156 demonstrated the localization of an IR-light point without the need for an active matrix by sandwiching a PVDF film between a low and a high conductive PEDOT-PSS electrode layer (Fig. 7b). Due to the high resistance of the bottom electrode of the film and its low-pass filter behavior, the pyroelectric signal dispersed with increasing distance from the IR-laser diode spot. If the signals were measured at each corner of the film by lock-in-amplifiers, the close correlation of delay and amplitude with spot position allowed the stimulus to be localized on a 2D plane by triangulation.
2.5 Bimodal sensing
Recently, bimodal sensing of temperature and pressure was demonstrated by Lee et al. for a free-standing ZnO/PVDF thin film with ZnO nanorods or nanodisks embedded in a PVDF matrix and rGO electrodes (Fig. 7c).94 Pressures down to 10 Pa could be detected via the ZnO-induced piezoelectric modulation of the electric resistance, ΔR, while the temperature of the impacting water droplets could be distinguished simultaneously from the impact pressure because the pyroelectricity of the PVDF matrix induced an increase in response and recovery time with an increase in temperature. A similar result was achieved with the already described ferroelectric sensor skin that exploited both the piezoresistive and pyroelectric characteristics of a PVDF/rGO composite film. Fig. 7d presents this sensor, which possessed two interlocked microdome PVDF/rGO sheets, enabling the pressure and temperature of falling water droplets to be precisely distinguished.78
The cross-sensitivity between the piezo- and the pyroelectric sensing mode, which can be detrimental in certain applications, can be decreased by blending ferroelectric nanoparticles in the ferroelectric polymer matrix. Since the piezoelectric coefficient of displacement ferroelectrics such as PbTiO3 has an opposite sign to the order–disorder ferroelectrics such as P(VDF–TrFE); whereas, the pyroelectric coefficient has the same sign, a change in the relative polarization orientations of the constituents can suppress one or the other sensing modes and influence the overall displacement.157 The compensation of either piezo- or pyroelectric response by parallel or antiparallel poling of particles vs. matrix was demonstrated first by Ploss et al.158 An improved two-step poling procedure enabled the combination of selectively poled bi-functional ferroelectric nanocomposites with organic thin film transistors; thus, forming a skin with either temperature or pressure-sensitive pixels (see Fig. 8a).

Each pixel is formed by a capacitive sensor based on a nanocomposite made of PbTiO3 nanoparticles dispersed in a P(VDF–TrFE) matrix, which is gate-connected to a thin film transistor. By a special poling procedure, the cross-sensitivity between the sensing modes can be suppressed and the nanocomposite defined as either pyro- or piezoelectric.

3. PVDF-based sensors integrated with thin film transistors: route towards smart sensors
In many cases, especially when the arrangement of ferroelectric polymer sensor pixels in the form of a matrix is required to deliver highly spatially and temporally resolved information on excitation events, when the signal needs on-site processing and amplification or when a low impedance output signal is needed (transimpedance amplification), coupling with appropriate transistor technology is advantageous. Such smart sensors can be formed either monolithically by integration of the ferroelectric sensing layer as a functional part of the transistor or by coupling the sensor device with one of the transistor terminals. To avoid making unfavourable compromises in terms of flexibility and form factor and to maintain the paradigm of easy-to-integrate, lightweight and conformable sensor skin, the integration of polymer sensors with rigid silicon-based technology must be avoided. Accordingly, though highly functional, the example of a 16 × 16 silicon-integrated PVDF sensor matrix for IR detection presented before (Fig. 7a) is not a practicable solution for ferroelectric sensor skins. In most cases the ferroelectric polymer sensors are integrated with organic thin film transistors (OTFT), which are superior to other technologies, such as amorphous silicon-based thin film transistors, in terms of flexibility and mechanical robustness and can easily be fabricated on flexible substrates via scalable low cost techniques. Since ferroelectric sensors alone are self-sustaining or self-powering (at least when they are not operated in the resistive mode), i.e. they need no external power supply, an important requirement for the connected OTFTs is low power consumption, and thus low threshold voltages.159 Otherwise, the objective of sustainable smart ferroelectric sensors is unfulfilled.
Monolithic integration of a piezoelectric PVDF film with pentacene or TIPS-pentacene-based OTFTs (power consumption in the μW range) was performed to form an 8 × 8 active matrix piezoelectric microphone,160 showing localized acoustic wave detection over a bandwidth of up to 15 kHz only limited by the maximum transition frequency of the OTFTs, and a 4 × 10 array for 2D strain field mapping.161 In both cases PVDF acts as one part of a bilayer gate dielectric and its voltage response to compressive or tensile strain delivers the gate voltage of the transistor pixels. The approach of inkjet-printed low voltage organic charge-modulated field-effect transistors with a second floating gate, which is connected to a PVDF or P(VDF–TrFE) thin film capacitor, is interesting.162 This type of smart bimodal ferroelectric sensor can be fabricated in an ultrathin and thus conformable format.163 It can respond to both pressure stimuli (tested P-range 40–120 kPa) and temperature variations (tested T-range 10–50 °C) and discriminate between them if simultaneously applied. Furthermore, a P(VDF–TrFE)/rGO nanocomposite layer was used as a highly temperature sensitive transparent semiconductor in a sensor OTFT with PEDOT:PSS electrodes. It detected temperature changes as low as 0.1 °C in the tested range of 30–80 °C and precisely delivered the human body temperature.77
A nearly perfect decoupling of P and T response was achieved for a bimodal OTFT sensor array using a nanocomposite gate dielectric composed of BaTiO3 nanoparticles in a P(VDF–TrFE) matrix (Fig. 8b).76,164 Applying an AC-bias to the gate resulted in modulation of the drain current. From the amplitude and the offset of the current modulation, the transconductance and the polarization equivalent voltage were extracted. Since the quasi-static pressure and temperature changes resulted in linear changes in the channel transconductance and the polarization equivalent voltage, the two sensor modes could be decoupled via a matrix approach.
This AC gate bias and signal deconvolution technique was also applied in a highly sensitive temperature- and pressure-responsive 4 × 4 OTFT array (Fig. 8c).166 It was based on a microstructured, and thus, easily deformable capacitive-coupled ferroelectric copolymer layer as the OTFT gate dielectric and pentacene as the semiconductor, which exhibited a pressure sensitivity of SP ∼ 1.1 kPa−1 for quasi-static pressures below 80 Pa and SP ∼0.03 kPa−1 for dynamic pressures (5 Hz) between 0.3–100 kPa and a temperature resolution of ΔT < 0.1 °C. The array could monitor the pressure and temperature responses of placed objects with certain local resolution, for example the local skin temperature increase of a blood vessel. However, a drawback is the large operation voltage (>10 V) and small transfer frequency of the OTFT, which limit its dynamic pressure sensing range.
In contrast, high temperature sensitivity at very low operation voltage was demonstrated with an opto-electronic switch made of a pyroelectric P(VDF–TrFE) capacitor, in which the IR radiation-induced voltage response biased the gate of a monolithically coupled OTFT (Fig. 8d).167 Due to the high performance and the low threshold voltage of the OTFT (originating from the thin nanocomposite gate dielectric), the drain current could be modulated over 4 orders of magnitude upon excitation of thermal waves in the ferroelectric copolymer layer using an intensity modulated IR-laser diode (for a laser power of 2.4 mW mm−2, T-waves with an amplitude of ∼17 °C are generated).62,99 The high temperature sensitivity of ST ∼ 1.5 K−1 in the range 27–42 °C with a resolution of ΔT < 0.2 °C is a result of the high mobility (1.2 cm2 V−1 s−1) and low subthreshold swing (110 mV dec−1) of this OTFT.
Using a similar concept, high temperature sensitivities at low operation voltages were achieved by coupling a printed P(VDF–TrFE) capacitor to the gate of a printed organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) or to a low voltage OTFT.66 Since the voltage response of the sensor to thermal or pressure excitation delivered the gate voltage for the transistor, it may switch the transistor on and off for devices with a low threshold voltage and a large subthreshold slope; thus, taking advantage of the fact that the drain current increases/decreases exponentially with the gate voltage in the subthreshold regime of OTFTs and OECTs, respectively. Thus, for normally-on OECTs, temperature lifts could be monitored with resolution ΔT < 0.4 °C and sensitivities of ST ∼ 0.56 K−1 and 0.77 K−1 in the range of 25–36 °C and 34–44 °C, respectively (the upper temperature range limit was set by the transistor turn off voltage). For the normally-off OTFTs, sensitivities of ST ∼ 0.79 K−1 and 0.55 K−1 with ΔT < 0.3 °C in the range of 27–36 °C and 36–41 °C, respectively, were derived (the upper temperature range limit was determined by the gate breakdown field, and the lower one by the turn-on voltage). It should be mentioned that the all-printed OECT sensors showed a pressure sensitivity of SP ∼ 0.05 kPa−1, which is among the highest values reported for ferroelectric sensing transistors.
A flexible self-sustaining active matrix strain sensor (4 × 4 array) was reported by Sun et al. with each pixel consisting of a piezoelectric nanogenerator coupled to the gate of a graphene transistor with an ion-gel gate dielectric and planar geometry (Fig. 8e).168 The nanogenerator was based on a P(VDF–TrFE) layer sandwiched between a graphene and an Au electrode, where the graphene electrode was extended laterally as the gate of the transistor and delivered the piezoelectric gate potential. The piezo potential-powered graphene transistor was nearly transparent and showed high gauge factors, GF, upon tensile and compressive strain with a minimum detectable strain of 0.008%. However, a disadvantage with this system is that the GF depends strongly on the tested strain range (GF = 389 for ε < 0.1% and 69 for 0.1% < ε < 0.3%). Due to the active matrix, this device enabled 2D mapping of strain. On a PDMS substrate, this strain sensor was very conformable, and thus could precisely monitor the flexing of a hand if attached to its back.
In another approach, an organic MEMS-sensor was created by mounting an OTFT with a piezoelectric polymer gate dielectric on a PEN micro-cantilever (Fig. 8f).169 Due to the high and linear strain gauge factor of 600, which is ascribed to the use of a poled P(VDF–TrFE) gate dielectric, the MEMS sensor could precisely detect humidity changes after coating with a water-absorbing hydrogel layer.

4. Ferroelectric polymer sensors fabricated by printing: route towards sustainable manufacturing
Our comfortable existence can be credited to the advancement of electronics, sensors, controllers and other smart designs, and it has become increasingly difficult to imagine a day without the assistance of modern technology. The insatiable demand for smart gadgets in today's society has not only made the electrical and electronic equipment industry (EEE) accountable for up to 20% depletion of non-renewable resources in the planet, but also has led to a massive amount of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE). Therefore, it is envisioned that scarce natural elements such as gallium and indium will run out completely by the end of the century, while recycling as a strategy to recover precious materials may not represent sustainable development.173 Nevertheless, even if the recycling and revalorization concepts become fully realized worldwide, there is still an energy imbalance when processing inorganic-based electronic devices. For example, it was demonstrated that the energy consumed in manufacturing a single processor chip exceeds the total energy used by a modern laptop during its typical 3 year lifetime.174 Thus, a paradigm shift in the way we control both resource exploitation and electronics disposal is required since only a finite portion of such functionalities is a priori designed and ultimately managed to be collected and recycled.175
Smart sensors do not represent a separate class of smart functionalities that will develop independent of electronics since in most, if not all cases, sensors and electronics are combined in a single complex unit. Therefore, strategies for reaching sustainability for sensor designs with respect to (i) energy spent during manufacturing, (ii) energy efficiency during operation and (iii) ease of recycling, revalorization and eventually biodegradation of materials involved should be developed in conjunction with the corresponding strategies involving electronics. Nevertheless, since this review deals exclusively with ferroelectric polymers as integral units in the development of smart sensors, the path towards reaching full sustainability will be primarily discussed only for the above reviewed materials.
Any sensor fabrication scheme that produces less embedded energy, is scalable in terms of area and throughput and non-hazardous in terms of involved process chemicals and material ingredient, is a step in the right direction towards enhanced sustainability. In the semiconductor industry, the manufacturing flow involves many harmful and toxic, even carcinogenic materials in processes such as etching (e.g. liquid chemicals such as buffer hydrofluoric acid and EDP, which is an aqueous solution of ethylene diamine and pyrocatechol, and gaseous compounds such as boron trichloride gas, carbon tetrachloride and trifluoromethane); cleaning gaseous agents (chlorine trifluoride, nitrogen trifluoride, carbon tetrafluoride etc.); photolithography (halogenated organic solvents such as EDP and also various acids); and doping (arsine, phosphine, etc.). This imposes a high, and often underestimated risk to both occupational and environmental health.176–180 Moreover, many semiconductor processing steps such as high-energy plasma ion implantation or thermal oxidation (involving temperatures greater than 1000 °C) consume large amounts of energy. For example, a facility producing chips on 6-inch wafers needs about 240 MW h per day of electricity and a tremendous amount of water (∼8 ktons per day).181,182 The so-called process embodied energy (electrical energy per kg material processed) is on average 3 orders of magnitude higher in semiconductor processing than in high throughput plastic processing such as injection molding.183
In contrast, printing can be used for the deposition and patterning of all the functional layers in polymer devices, has a maximum process temperature of ∼150 °C and consumes roughly the same amount of energy per kg as injection molding. Thus, from an energy footprint minimization perspective, printing outperforms inorganic semiconductor manufacturing by several orders of magnitude. Functional printing184,185 employing sheet-to-sheet or roll-to-roll substrate feeding is also highly scalable (i.e. size: m2 to km2 and throughput: up to 100 m s−1) and has clear,186–188 albeit not always strictly followed,189,190 regulations on the usage of hazardous substances and occupational pollutants, such as the strict interdiction of halogenated solvents. For these reasons, flexible and printed electronics can reach a much higher level of sustainability than conventionally fabricated electronics, especially when biodegradable substrates, carriers and materials are used and waste is minimized.191–193
Meanwhile printed electronics and sensors made of carbon-based materials are an integral component of new applications such as low-cost disposable electronics (for example electronic skin, health monitoring and wearables), extremely large format electronic displays, interactive wallpapers, and sensing arrays.194,195 Thus far, for the printing-based fabrication of ferroelectric polymer sensors, mainly screen and ink jet printing have been used.
In 2007, M. Dietze and M. Es Souni reported the screen printing of composites of P(VDF–TrFE)/PZT nanoparticles (NP) on ITO-coated glass substrates and investigated their film morphology and pyro- and piezoelectric properties (Fig. 9a).67 0–3 PZT-NP was dispersed in an N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)-based P(VDF–TrFE)56:44 solution, and the thickness of the films was determined using the viscosity of the paste and therefore the PZT filling factor, which reached about 5 μm for the pastes with 20 vol% PZT. For up to 40 vol% PZT intake, a homogeneous dispersion of particles in the matrix was observed via backscattered SEM; whereas, the heavily filled sample with 50 vol% PZT showed porosity at the interface with the glass substrate. As expected, the dielectric constant increased monotonically with the PZT filling factor, reaching about 71 (at 1 kHz) for 50 vol% filling. After corona poling in a DC electric field, the maximum dependence of the pyroelectric coefficient on the composition was obtained for 30 vol% PZT with p3 ∼ 80 μC m−2 K−1, which is 60% above the p3-value of film sensors with spin-coated films of pure P(VDF–TrFE)56:44.75 For higher filling factors, the pyroelectricity decreased again; whereas, the piezoelectric coefficient was small and showed only slight dependence on the filling (d33 ∼ 6–8 pC N−1, which is only 20% of the typically measured d33 ∼ 30–35 pC N−1 for thin films made of pure P(VDF–TrFE)). This was attributed to the partial compensation of the d33 contributions from the matrix and ceramic particles in the parallel poled composite materials (see discussion for Fig. 8a). In contrast, Siponkoski et al. observed a monotonic increase in both permittivity and d33 when the PZT content varied from 30 vol% to 50 vol% for printed sensors based on composite PZT/P(VDF–TrFE) inks.196

(a) Backscattered scanning electron microscopy images of screen-printed composites of (0–3) PZT particles in a P(VDF–TrFE)56:44 matrix. Up to 40 vol%, the PZT particles are statistically dispersed, and for 50 vol% porous regions are observed especially near the substrate (highlighted by arrows). The pyro- and piezoelectric coefficients of the composite, p3 and d33, respectively, depend on the PZT content. Adapted with permission from ref. 67 Copyright 2007, Elsevier B.V.

It was observed that both the solvent evaporation and crystallinity of printed samples could be significantly increased by thermal annealing for inkjet-printed copolymer layers based on a P(VDF–TrFE)70:30 ink with cyclopentanone solvent71 and P(VDF–TrFE)80:20 ink with DMF solvent (Fig. 9b).70 In ref. 71 an optimum annealing temperature of 140 °C was reported, while in the article by Sekitani et al.,70 thermal annealing above 120 °C was needed to induce a hysteresis loop. Furthermore, for annealing temperatures between 130 °C and 140 °C, the remnant polarization, Pr, reached a maximum of 84 mC m−2, which was attributed to the smooth and highly crystalline copolymer layers. In contrast, annealing at 150 °C (temperature slightly below the melting point) induced a strong increase in layer roughness and a decrease in Pr. The increase in RMS roughness (determined by atomic force microscopy, AFM) may have originated from the partial melting of the copolymer layers. The associated electrical hysteresis of these inkjet-printed ferroelectric copolymer layers was exploited for air-stable organic nonvolatile flexible random-access-memory matrices with an on–off ratio of 105. P(VDF–TrFE) was the gate dielectric of the memory OTFTs, vacuum-deposited pentacene was used for the semiconducting layer and inkjet-printed Ag nanoparticle lines formed all the electrodes.
Very smooth surfaces with less than 4 nm RMS roughness were reported for inkjet-printed copolymer layers with a thickness of ∼2 μm based on an ink formulation of 1% P(VDF–TrFE)70:30 mixed in 50:50% cyclopentanone/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Fig. 9c).72 Using this material, Pr ∼ 78 mC m−2 was extracted from displacement hysteresis loop measurements; whereas, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements revealed a Curie temperature of Tc1 ∼ 112 °C upon heating, melting temperature of Tm ∼ 152 °C and crystallization temperature of Tcrystallization ∼ 128 °C.
All-printed ferroelectric sensors made of a P(VDF–TrFE) copolymer sensing layer and printed electrodes were reported first by Zirkl et al.66 In the screen printing process, the type of paste solvent and its evaporation process strongly influenced the quality of the ferroelectric polymer layers. In Fig. 9d the displacement hysteresis loop curves of the P(VDF–TrFE) sensors printed on PET film substrates are plotted for different solvent evaporation temperatures and thermal treatment conditions. The sensors are based on P(VDF–TrFE)80:20 sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS electrodes and wired by printed silver conducting paths. The screen printing paste is formulated by dissolving the ferroelectric copolymer powder in a 1:1 γ-butyrolactone (GBL)–acetone solvent mixture at a concentration of 16 vol% at room temperature. The co-solvent acetone is removed at a low temperature (40 °C) followed by cooling to room temperature, which induces a sol–gel transition.66,197,198 Since the maximum temperature during printing and curing of the electrode, interconnection and sensor layers never exceeds 115 °C (applied for <10 min), the as-formulated paste can be printed on versatile substrates such as plastic film, paper, textile, leather, thermoplastic urethane, glass, metallized films and elastomer and delivers smooth films, as is illustrated by the AFM height images (RMS ∼18 nm over 2 × 2 μm2). Contrary to ink formulations containing other solvents, GBL-based P(VDF–TrFE) pastes do not need an annealing step after printing to achieve sufficient crystallinity in the printed ferroelectric layer. However, the solvent evaporation step is critical, as obvious from Fig. 9d-top left panel. Drying at 115 °C with a good thermal contact to the underlay (with no paper present between the plastic film and the metal underlay) induces the highest Pr (specifically, the highest displacement at zero electric field, D0) and also yields larger sizes of spaghetti-like ferroelectric crystallites, as clearly shown in the SEM cross sections and the AFM phase image (Fig. 9d-second top left panel). (It should be noted that the remnant polarization values, Pr, typically reported in literature are actually the displacement values at zero electric field, D0. Thus, to derive the remnant polarization from the hysteresis loop curves, the small dielectric contribution due to leakage or dipole currents or due the dipoles in the matrix has to be subtracted.) The measured pyroelectric coefficient, p3, directly correlates with the D0 value of these sensors (see Fig. 9d-top middle panel). It has been previously reported that for a non-optimized and incomplete solvent evaporation process due to the use of fast evaporating solvents (e.g. commonly used methyl ethyl ketone, where MEK has a vapor pressure of 121 hPa compared to that of GBL, which is only 2 hPa), pinholes develop in the P(VDF–TrFE) layer. This event leads to the unwanted risk of electrical short circuit when the printed top electrode paste (e.g. Ag) penetrates through the pinholes.199 Thus, using controlled printing and climate conditions, the as-fabricated copolymer sensors can achieve very high yield and stability. This is illustrated by the plot of 96 (PVDF:TrFE)70:30 devices printed on a PET sheet in Fig. 9d bottom left. All the sensors were functional, and the average displacement was D0 = 69 ± 1.6 mC m−2 (σ ∼ 2%). Neither the thermal shock tests nor temperature storage of the 16 sensors significantly deteriorated D0. Only the effective piezoelectric sensitivity, SFN, which was measured with a hydraulic pressurized stamp setup, showed ∼10% decrease from SFN ∼ 1.3 nC N−1 to 1.2 nC N−1 upon thermal shock (see Fig. 9d bottom middle and Table 1). Note that the sensitivity of devices printed on plastic films is strongly determined by the higher elasticity and compressibility of the substrate (compared to that of glass or steel), resulting in a stronger deformation of the copolymer layers. This explains why SFN is about 50–100 times larger than the intrinsic piezoelectric coefficient, d33. Since the heat-stabilized PET substrate (Melinex® ST505) shrinks at about 18 ppm K−1;200,201 whereas, PVDF has a thermal expansion coefficient of 120–150 ppm K−1,202 the strain between the sensor layer and substrate upon temperature cycling can reach 15%. This strain can induce certain defects, such as minor delamination at the interface between the ferroelectric layer and the substrate/electrode, thus resulting in a small decrease in SFN upon thermal shock. The raw signals of the pressure sensitivity measurement for sequential loading of 100 g are shown in the rightmost region of Fig. 9d. By integrating the current response, the charge response can be derived, and the extracted charge curve mirrors the dynamic and static parts of the load curve; thus, demonstrating the ability of the printed sensor to deliver both dynamic and “quasi”-static pressures and forces.
Fully screen-printed ferroelectric sensors from P(VDF–TrFE) inks with different polar solvents were reported by T. Sekine et al. (Fig. 9e),69 who also showed the wireless monitoring of radial artery pulse waves by connecting the printed sensors to a communication amplifier circuit (see Fig. 10d). They found that polar solvents with a dipole moment below 3 D (such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) and cyclohexanone (CHN)) induced flat ferroelectric layers (as opposed to e.g. trimethyl phosphate (TMP) and DMF) during screen printing. On the other hand, the size of the crystallites slightly increased with an increase in dipole moment, resulting finally in an increase in Pr. The importance of a low surface roughness in printed ferroelectric layers was also emphasized in other reports, especially when a small thickness of the ferroelectric material plays a key role such as in low voltage non-volatile polymer memories.203 A pressure-sensitive microcatheter surface was realized by screen printing P(VDF–TrFE) layers on micromachined molds to realize bump- and dome-shaped piezoelectric films, which could be detached as a micropatterned stand-alone poled film and assembled on a PI catheter (sensitivity of this device is presented in Table 1).119 Moreover, a flexible, ferroelectric copolymer-based and all-inkjet-printed micropump actuator was reported with a d31 of 10 pm V−1 and pump rates up to 130 μL min−1.71,204 However, the application of this type of actuator in lab-on-chip devices is only practical if the driving voltages are lowered significantly (from 700–900 V), which is expected to be achieved by optimizing the valve design and the layer sequence.

(a) R2R-compatible continuous impregnation of polyester fabrics with PVDF/graphene composite followed by phase separation during dissolving of the liquid phase in a water bath. Due to the induction of graphene and water upon phase separation, a parallel arrangement of the PVDF chains was achieved resulting in the formation of an electroactive PVDF phase with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by the HR-TEM images. Sensitivity upon normal forces of SFN up to 34 V N−1 was reported, which was slightly larger for PVDF/graphene@F than PVDF@F.

Significant upscaling potential was demonstrated with PVDF/graphene layers coated on commercially available fabrics via a roll-to-roll compatible approach based on impregnation coating and phase separation in water for applications such as pressure sensors integrated in wearable clothing (Fig. 10a).130 Upon the introduction of water, PVDF and graphene were shown to simultaneously separate from the liquid N-methyl pyrrolidone (NMP) phase and form a solid PVDF/graphene composite coating on polyester fibers (denoted as PVDF/graphene@F). The electron injecting CH2 groups of the PVDF chains promoted intense interaction with the π-conjugated electrons of graphene. Simultaneously, at the interface of PVDF and water, the electronegative CF2 units of other chains tend to form hydrogen bonds with H2O. Under the synergistic effect of water and graphene, the dissolved PVDF chains could be polarized into an electroactive β-/γ-phase of PVDF, delivering a uniform PVDF/graphene coating layer on fabrics with a significant presence of the piezoelectric PVDF phase (i.e. 87% crystallinity, as shown in the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images in Fig. 10a). Pressure sensors were realized by sandwiching the piezoelectric fabric between Al foils, which were tested with an electromagnetic punch. Mainly owing to the porous structure of the fabric, which allowed for large deformations and to a lesser extent to the graphene, the fabric sensors delivered a remarkably high force sensitivity of SFN = 34 V N−1 (see Table 1) and low force detection threshold of only 0.6 mN. Monitoring of body movement by piezoelectric sensors sewn in daily garments (pants and face mask) was demonstrated as well as the distinction of voices by evaluating the air flow generated during speaking.
A completely different application scenario was targeted with an all-printed active ferroelectric sensor matrix, namely a touchless human–machine interface (Fig. 10b)66 composed of a screen-printed P(VDF–TrFE) sensor array with printed PEDOT:PSS bottom and carbon or PEDOT:PSS top electrodes, where each sensor row was coupled to the gate of a printed organic electrochemical transistor (OECT). OECTs are extremely low voltage operating, normally-on transistors that exploit the reversible redox process of PEDOT:PSS, which is conductive when oxidized and non-conducting when reduced. Only five different inks were needed to print this smart pyroelectric sensor matrix on the proximity of an approaching object (e.g. a finger) by absorption of human body heat radiation, which induced temperature waves in the ferroelectric layer. For the carbon top electrodes, the pyroelectric response (exemplified as voltage response to intensity-modulated NIR-light excitation) was higher than that for the PEDOT:PSS electrodes due to the better NIR absorption of carbon. This pyroelectric voltage response served as the gate voltage for the OECTs and switched the transistors off and on. For direct visualization of the transistor switching, the smart sensor matrix was also coupled to screen-printed organic electrochromic pixels (OECD) based on the same material set. When the OECT was switched off (happens for a positive sensor voltage, which in the chosen configuration is induced for “laser diode off”), all the current discharged via the resistor over a display pixel (connected in parallel) and resulted in OECD oxidation and light grey coloring. When the OECT was switched on again (for “laser diode on” and sensor voltage of ∼0 V), the display pixel was reduced and turned dark blue.
The wide dynamic frequency range of ferroelectric polymer sensors motivated several groups to develop printed acoustic transducers. Wagle et al. fabricated more than 100 ultrasonic transducers by screen printing ferroelectric polymer films on a high performance polyethylene imine (PEI) film, which was very thin and had low acoustic attenuation and a good impedance matching to PVDF, and the other printed layers included PEDOT:PSS for the electrodes and silver and carbon for the interconnects (Fig. 10c).68 These transducers showed broad-banded ultrasonic spectra with maximum frequency responses around 100 MHz, where a dependence on the shape of the transducers was observed which could be traced back to the limited conductivity of the PEDOT:PSS electrodes. For electrodes with insufficient conductivity, the cut-off frequency (determined by the capacitance and overall resistance loss) was smaller than the resonance frequency of the transducer. Another impressive example of the use of printable ferroelectric polymers in acoustic applications is the large-area piezoelectric loudspeakers fabricated by flexography, screen and/or stencil printing of PVDF-copolymers and PEDOT:PSS electrodes on conventional paper (Fig. 10d).205 They showed a sound pressure level (SPL) of up to 80 dB for an area of 128 cm2 and a certain dependence on the paper fiber direction. In a recent report, the mass-printed loudspeaker was combined with a printed self-biased audio amplifier, and each component was integrated on a separate PET sheet.206 The amplifier provided a peak voltage gain of 18 dB at 400 Hz and could reproduce an SPL of 36–60 dBA over 700 Hz to 12.5 kHz at a distance of one meter (see Fig. 10d).
5. Real-world applications of flexible and printed ferroelectric polymer sensors
All the above research reports demonstrate the incredible variety of application possibilities that can be realized with printed ferroelectric polymer sensors and their potential application in product prototypes in the near future. However, in prototypical real-world applications, the requirements go far beyond the performances of a small pool of sensors tested and recorded immediately after their fabrication. For real-world applications, the uniform fabrication, yield and performance variation over large sample sizes, the reproducibility of the sensor characteristics upon aging and storage, their stability in diverse stress conditions and, in some cases, their weathering strength are more important factors to consider than scoring a world-record laboratory characteristic. Furthermore, their materials and fabrication costs, scalability with respect to number of resulting units and size and the ease of integration and assembly with electronics and other smart objects (especially for smart surfaces and IoE applications) are key factors for successful prototyping, still without considering user interface friendliness and the associated software.
The company Measurement Specialities Inc., part of TE Connectivity,50 has presented a bunch of well-established real-world applications for their commercially available metallized PVDF films and sensors (with fixed standard design and film thickness), such as motion sensors (car alarm, washing machine load imbalance, and vehicle motion), accelerometers (from LINN Products Ltd), grain loss sensors in combine harvesters, paper path error detection sensors in printers, shock sensors in target plates, contact microphones (e.g. on stethoscopes from Welch Allyn), pacemaker activity sensors and sleep lab sensors (Healthdyne Technologies).
A recent application of PVDF sensors as an integral part of a multifunctional object is the smart health monitoring chair for unconstrained heart rate and blood pressure diagnostics by nonintrusive methods.207 It uses ferroelectric polymer film sensors mounted beneath the seat for ballisto-cardiogram measurements and combines that with wireless data transfer and a user-friendly software interface. Beat-to-beat heart rates and blood pressure could be detected through clothing, which demonstrates an attractive unconstrained long-term health monitoring system that does not require user awareness and is not limited by physical activity. The development of an unconstrained sleep apnea monitoring system based on a 122 μm thick PVDF film with printed Ag electrodes mounted between a bed cover and a bed mattress and protected by a thin silicon pad has similar potential.208 An extended study comprising 32 human subjects revealed that it was possible to detect apnea via the PVDF-sensed respiratory signals with performances similar to that of ambulatory devices. Due to their small overall thickness (∼1 mm), the subjects were not consciously aware of the presence of the sensors. Thus, the developed system and method can be applied for the detection of sleep apnea in the home or ambulatory monitoring. In another study, a similarly constructed bed sensor was tested on 28 sleep-deprived patients for heart rate measurement by covering 92.7% sleep time. The monitoring event resulted in less than 10% failure rate, especially for sleeping periods with low heart rate (<70 bpm).209
Excellent robustness, which is always required by prototypical applications, was achieved in PVDF films used as printed touch panels. These user interfaces worked in sunlight, moist and even underwater environments. They were fabricated by spray coating graphene inks as electrodes on both sides of a 110 μm-thick PVDF film, resulting in a transparent touch sensor with reasonable sensitivity (Table 1).126
Other more sophisticated object integrated human–machine interfaces (HMI) based on ferroelectric polymer sensors are displayed in Fig. 11. A 3D-shaped user interface in the form of a plastic console comprising an interactive surface via seamlessly integrated ultra-flat pressure-sensitive keys, which are illuminated from the back, is shown in Fig. 11a. The fabrication concept was inspired by in-mold electronics (IME) and based on the hybrid integration of printed circuitry (pads and conduction lines) and adhesives, printed ferroelectric sensors and SMD components such as microLEDs and resistors, which were assembled by pick & place on a film laminate of PET and polycarbonate (PC). The as-functionalized 2D plastic substrate was encapsulated with a special laminate film and then brought into the desired 3D shape by high pressure forming against a mold, which obviously required the materials involved to have a certain stretchability. During the forming process, the materials needed to withstand at least one plastic deformation at a moderate temperature (e.g. ∼130–160 °C) but high pressure (200–300 bar). Most of the strain that occurred during high pressure forming had to be consumed by the wiring that extended over the complete surface. For the printed Ag wiring, either a commercially available screen printing paste specially developed for IME applications (e.g. ME602 from DuPont™ or ECI1010 from Henkel) or proprietary screen printing formulations based on Ag flakes in an appropriate binder could be employed. The resistance increase in the PEDOT:PSS (sandwiching the P(VDF–TrFE) layer) was less than 15% at 20% strain, which was the maximum strain that the sensors were subjected to during plastic deformation. This 3D-formed plastic console combined intuitive user interaction (by pressure-sensitive touch) with local user feedback (by backlighting of the keys when switched on).

(a) 3D-shaped user interface in the form of an interactive plastic console, comprising printed pressure-sensitive keys, printed wiring and pick & place assembled microLEDs for backlighting of the keys. The process flow starts with the 2D substrate laminate (PET/PC), which is first covered with conduction lines, contact pads and adhesives via screen printing and then functionalized by screen printing of ferroelectric sensors and pick & place assembly of microLEDs and resistors. After lamination of a protective film on the as-functionalized film, high-pressure forming against a mold is the final step, which defines the shape of the console. The microLEDs and the piezoelectric keys remain functional after 3D-forming. Source: own work, unpublished.

On the right side, the signal upon tapping with a foot is visualized on the display in real-time, where the graphs show the signal forms generated for slow walking over a 3 or 5 layer parquet. The different phases of foot rolling (heel down, rolling, and toe up) could clearly and reproducibly be distinguished from each other. Source: own work, unpublished. (c) Pyroelectric active sensor matrix for proximity detection, where each printed ferroelectric sensor pixel is coupled to the source of a monolithically integrated organic transistor. When the transistor is switched On (by applying a small negative voltage to the gate e.g. −3 V to the OTFT in the first row, second column), the sensor forces a pyroelectric current through the transistor (∼drain current), which is inversely proportional to the distance between the hand and sensor. The sensor reacts on temperature waves induced in the ferroelectric layer by human body radiation and transduces them into a charge flow (or a current). Here, the source and drain were connected to the same potential (ground). Source: own work, unpublished. (d) Interactive smart card made of a flexible electrophoretic display and a flexible printed 3 × 5 piezoelectric input sensor laminated to the back of the display. The smart card combines several customer and credit cards, among which you can switch by bending. The input sensor also supports pressure-sensitive touch, which is exploited for typing a customized PIN code. Reproduced with permission from ref. 212 Copyright ACM UIST, 2014. 
A radically different type of HMI is illustrated in Fig. 11b. It is a real large area application, where printed ferroelectric sensor films are integrated monolithically in the structure of a parquet floorboard (by adhesion or lamination).210 This floor can precisely monitor the rolling of a foot upon slow walking, and the signal form coming from heel down and toe up rolling phases can be differentiated reproducibly by the soft five layer parquet. Moreover, the floor is very sensitive to vibrations and can distinguish steps from a bouncing ball or a sudden drop and, in optimized setups, sees the pulse of a lying person. Envisioned applications range from switching light or controlling blinds to detecting patient movement or a sudden fall combined with vital parameter monitoring.
Touchless interaction and proximity sensing are especially interesting for collaborative robotics, where security issues play a major role. The pyroelectric functionality of printed ferroelectrics can be used for proximity sensing up to distances where capacitive sensors will fail or produce unreliable signals (10 to 30 cm). Fig. 11c displays a 3 × 3 active matrix array of ferroelectric sensors, where each sensor pixel is connected to the source electrode of a monolithically integrated organic transistor.211 The pyroelectric matrix sensor reacts to the temperature waves induced by the MIR radiation of an approaching human body via the generation of a pyroelectric current, the magnitude of which is correlated inversely with the distance between the body part (hand in this case) and sensor. On account of the sensor-OTFT coupling, the proximity-induced pyroelectric current determined the drain current that was sampled only if the gate of the OTFT was switched on. Distances up to 20 centimetres were clearly registered as a proportional drain current decrease.
The mechanical flexibility of the printed sensor films was also exploited for 3D interaction,212 with the investigations that laid the foundation of the interactive smart card shown in Fig. 11d. The card was composed of a flexible electrophoretic display and a printed 3 × 5 input sensor keypad, which was laminated to the back of the display. It supported paper-like interaction via bending and other intuitive gestures such as pressure-sensitive touch, which was used for typing a PIN code customized with respect to a pre-defined typing pressure sequence. Only for the right combination of typing pressure and number, the PIN code was accepted. The bending metaphor was used for snapping between the customer cards and credit cards. The combination of the self-sustainable sensor keypad with the ultralow power consuming electrophoretic display is very elegant considering sustainability, wireless communication, lightness, and ease-of-integration, and thus the smart card perfectly meets the critical challenges of IoE applications. In another application prototype (i.e. an interactive protective case), the interactive electrophoretic display was used as a secondary screen seamlessly integrated to a mobile phone cover. This interactive case augmented the standard input and display capabilities of a smartphone by: (i) allowing for paper-like interaction by bending only, gripping and bending and pressure-sensitive touch via the flexible part of the case without occluding the main LCD screen and (ii) the possibility to display content persistently without burdening the battery lifetime by copying the respective content with simple gestures to the main screen.213
6. Energy harvesting with ferroelectric polymers: route towards PVDF-based energy harvesters
The ability to self-power is a very attractive feature of ferroelectric polymer sensors and a key step on the road towards the mature development of sustainable smart sensors. Even more appealing is the fact that PVDF-based materials can be used as active elements in energy harvesting devices, which convert natural dissipating energy into usable energy. Energy harvesting technologies have been studied intensively over the past decades to help mitigate the energy imbalance around the globe, and various approaches to harvest waste energy with the aid of soft materials have been suggested. These materials have proven to be particularly suitable for IoE applications due to their superiority in terms of integratability on various surfaces.12 For example, piezo- and pyroelectric polymer materials can harness: (i) mechanical energy (from sources such as human motion, acoustic noise, vibration, flow and wind) and (ii) thermal energy (from sources such as body temperature, IR light and hot water/gas pipes) and convert the respective energy into an electric current or a voltage.214 Although piezoelectric energy harvesting with brittle ceramics has been known for some time and has now found its way to applications,215 flexible nanogenerators (NG) exploiting the piezoelectric and triboelectric effect are better suited for applications in flexible/stretchable electronics, organic optoelectronics, and wearable electronics, as highlighted in a recent review by Fan et al.216 Kim et al.214 compared the performance of vibration energy harvesters based on piezoceramics with that based on piezopolymers (PVDF) and found that the latter are advantageous since they are ductile, resilient to shock, deformable and lightweight and thus well suited for wearable (backpacks and shoes) and weight-sensitive (wind-scavenging leaves) applications. Furthermore, F. Narita and M. Fox compared piezoelectric, magnetostrictive and magnetoelectric materials and technologies with respect to their energy harvesting ability and found that miniaturization of the harvester volume is one of the main challenges in the near future and that composite polymer materials are the most promising.217 Approaches to tailor the ferroelectric, piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties of PVDF-based energy harvesters were recently reviewed by C. Wan and C.R. Bowen,218 including the influence of polymer processing conditions, heat treatment, nano-confinement, blending, forming nanocomposites and electrospinning.
Thin PVDF or P(VDF–TrFE) films (optionally with metal or graphene electrodes) work well as flexible piezoelectric energy harvesters with good stability219 and reasonable energy conversion efficiency and electrical output, especially when multiple layers are stacked on top of each other.139,220 Several strategies have been proposed for improving the piezoelectric performance of nanogenerators based on ferroelectric polymers. Generally, hybrid piezoelectric films are fabricated by dispersing various piezoelectric micro/nanoparticles in the ferroelectric polymer matrix. These hybrid films with BTO nanoparticles,221,222 Ba(TixZr1−x)O3 nanocubes223 and BTO microstones plus silver nanowires224 dispersed in a P(VDF–TrFE) matrix exhibited high electrical outputs (see Table 3).225 The resulting hybrid film nanogenerators could convert biomechanical energy,221,224 sound pressure,139,220 vehicle motion,224 fluid and air flow,223 strain,139,219,221 and pushing force.224,225 A very sophisticated hybrid nanogenerator material was reported recently by Karan et al.,226 who integrated flexible steel woven fabric electrodes into a PVDF/AlO–rGO nanocomposite film by molding, where the Al2O3 nanoparticles decorated on the rGO layers acted as a nucleating agent for the β-phase formation of PVDF. This hybrid nanogenerator material exhibited a reliable energy harvesting performance with high output, fast charging capability (6 V in ∼100 s) and high durability and could harvest energy from a variety of biomechanical sources (hand folding, jogging, heel pressing, and foot striking) and machine vibration. Repetitive human finger imparting delivered an open circuit voltage VOC ∼ 36 V and a short-circuit current density ISC ∼ 1 μA cm−2, corresponding to a power density of ∼28 μW cm−3. With this very robust device, a stable energy output was demonstrated for about 160.000 cycles, in which several different types of commercial electronics, such as a calculator, wrist watch, tweeter speaker, and mobile LCD screen were powered.

An alternative approach to generate hybrid materials that are perfectly adapted to wearable applications is the use of a single hybrid fiber with a piezoelectric layer formed by radially oriented ZnO nanowires infiltrated by PVDF. This hybrid material piezoelectric layer is sandwiched between coaxial Au electrode layers around a fiber core (Fig. 12a).227 Owing to the strong increase in effective surface area, the hybrid fiber nanogenerator can scavenge energy from human motion, namely about 16 μW cm−3 under folding and releasing an elbow at 90°. This example demonstrates that designed nano-/microstructures can significantly improve the conversion efficiency of ferroelectric polymers from mechanical and other forms of energies into electricity. S. Cha et al.228 used vertically grown ZnO nanowire arrays not as an active element but as a template to produce PVDF films with aligned and vertically extending nanopores. These PVDF films could convert sonic waves (100 dB, 100 Hz) into electricity with a high power density of 170 μW cm−3, which is 5 times higher than that achieved with the bulk PVDF film. Using a similar approach, Y. Mao et al.229 fabricated translucent and soft mesoporous piezoelectric PVDF thin films with a sponge-like morphology using ZnO nanoparticles as a template (Fig. 12b). This device could produce high power densities for surface oscillations with controlled frequencies (160 μW cm−3 at 60 Hz). Furthermore, a patterned electro-hydrodynamic (EHD) pulling method to fabricate in situ poled P(VDF–TrFE) microfiber arrays was reported, which delivered a good electrical output, but used rigid electrodes (made of ITO glass), and thus is not compatible with flexible and wearable applications.230 Finally, R. A. Whiter et al. reported a scalable, simple and cost-effective template-wetting technique for the fabrication of ultra-dense arrays of highly crystalline, aligned P(VDF–TrFE) nanowires (i.e. 1010 NW over 2 cm2), which needed no poling, could be exploited in nanogenerators and had an energy conversion efficiency of ∼11%.231

To meet the requirements of energy harvesting for wearable electronics, a significant body of work was done in terms of electrospinning ferroelectric polymer fibers and developing energy harvesting fabrics. C. Chang et al.,232 produced one of the first demonstrations of direct-writing of fiber-based nanogenerators by near-field electrospinning of PVDF. Moreover, the same group demonstrated the repeatable and long-term stability of electrical outputs of single PVDF nanofibers under mechanical strain. Through an in situ mechanical stretching and electrical poling process, PVDF nanofibers were fabricated on flexible substrates between contact electrodes under a high bias voltage (>10 kV), which allowed the transformation of the nonpolar α-phase to the polar β-phase. Energy conversion efficiencies of 21.8% were achieved (with the average of 12.5%). These efficiencies were about an order of magnitude higher than that reported for PVDF thin films. Furthermore, flexible piezoelectric fibers based on electrospun nanofiber mats wrapped manually around a silver-coated nylon yarn as the inner electrode and a wrapped CNT sheet as the outer electrode generated over 50 μW cm−3 and sustained a tensile strain of 50% when twisted to coils.233
By simply inspecting the examples above, it is obvious that electrospinning has tremendous upscaling potential in terms of productivity and active area, at least with respect to non-aligned fiber webs. Recently, needleless electrospinning using a rotating disc was used to fabricate large area mats (60 × 30 cm2) composed of in situ poled PVDF nanofiber webs (Fig. 12c).234 After coupling to an elastomer frame (enabled effective recovery to the original structure after excitation), the mats could operate a 1.4 W miniature Peltier cooler (via charging a 33 μF capacitor to over 15 V for 20 min); thus, highlighting the possibility of developing mechanically driven cooling of textiles for regulation of the body temperature (e.g. for applications including military and sport apparel). The performance of the above exemplified design was impressive, i.e. the temperature dropped by about 1 degree within 1 second operation time. Furthermore, it was observed that the electrical output (excited by a pressure of 50 kPa at 5 Hz) increased monotonically with an increase in the voltage from 20 to 60 kV, leading to an increase in the energy conversion yield by about 14% and delivering a maximum power density of about 5.85 μW cm−2 (∼100 μW cm−3). This originated from the increase in the β-phase content from 78% to 89%, resulting from the better electric field distribution in the solution induced by the disc compared to the needle. A true piezoelectric fabric structure was demonstrated by N. Soin et al.235 in the form of “3D spacer” technology employing all-fiber fabrics. The knitted single-structure piezoelectric generator consisted of in situ poled PVDF monofilaments fabricated by melt-spinning extrusion as the spacer yarn interconnected between silver-coated polyamide multifilament yarn layers acting as the top and bottom electrodes. This 3D textile structure provided an output power density of up to 5 μW/cm2 (∼17 μW cm−3) at an applied impact pressure of 100 kPa. The proposed design delivered higher outputs than a 2D non-woven energy harvesting fabric based on an electrospun PVDF:NaNbO3 nanofiber web sandwiched between elastic conductive fabrics, which achieved ∼2.7 μW cm−2 (∼13 μW cm−3) at 200 kPa.236
Hybrid flexible nanogenerators that simultaneously scavenge energy from at least two energy sources are a further development direction, where especially piezo-/triboelectric harvesters have proven to deliver much higher power densities than pure piezoelectric nanogenerators. In one example multiple electrospun nanofibers were arranged in either serial or parallel connections to help increase the total generated electrical output from two energy sources for potential in vivo applications.237 The hybrid device consisted of an ex situ poled PVDF nanofiber generator (packed in biocompatible PDMS) for harvesting mechanical energy from breathing or from heart beats and a flexible enzymatic biofuel cell for harvesting biochemical energy (glucose/O2) in biological fluids. Using the hybrid device, where the power output is simply the sum of the powers generated by the individual energy sources, a UV-light sensor based on ZnO nanowires was operated; thus, demonstrating a self-powered nanosystem for in vivo applications. In another interesting report, mats composed of electrospun PVDF fiber webs were also used in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG) embedded between two layers of conductive fabric separated by a spacer, which were tested for an insole prototype to harvest energy during walking.238 The authors showed that by harvesting the stepping force, 214 serially-connected LEDs could be illuminated.
The concept of piezoelectric–triboelectric nanogenerators (PENG–TENG) based on electrospun PVDF NF webs on a stainless steel grid incorporated in a TENG setup was also used to scavenge energy from sound or environmental noise sources in the frequency range of 50–425 Hz with a maximum power density of 20.2 μW cm−2 or 2 mW cm−3 (Fig. 12d).239 The device worked in a stable and reproducible manner over 7 days of test, enduring 100 million cycles and could drive 138 LEDs. Harvesting the noise from a busy street over 52 s resulted in a continuous current generation with peak values of ∼180 μA. With an r-shaped PENG–TENG device, power densities of about 11 mW cm−3 for the piezo- and ∼2 mW cm−3 for the triboelectric part were achieved. This enhancement was partly due to the increased surface roughness of the micropatterned PDMS layer and the nanostructured Al electrode.241
Harvesters based on ferroelectric polymers were also developed in a stretchable form by several groups. For example, J. H. Lee et al.242 fabricated sound-driven stretchable nanogenerators based on a graphene/P(VDF–TrFE)/graphene/PDMS structure. When exposed to the same sound pressure input, the measured output performance of the stretchable nanogenerator with the PDMS template was up to 30 times that of a normal nanogenerator with a plastic substrate and 8 times higher than that of the normal nanogenerator upon exposure to an air flow at the same speed. The stretchable helical harvesters from Kim et al.243 consisted of an elastic core with a PVDF strap and a fabric band twined manually around it to form two helical structures in a counter direction. When stitched to human sports garments, this highly elastic helical harvester delivered a remarkable power density of up to 420 μW cm−3 under repetitive (1 Hz) stretching to 150% of its initial length, which occurred during knee or hip bending (or exercising).
The harvesting of thermal energies (from skin temperature gradients) in addition to mechanical energies (from body movements) was demonstrated with a highly stretchable piezo- and pyroelectric hybrid nanogenerator based on a very thin P(VDF–TrFE) film sandwiched between a micro-patterned PDMS:CNT (carbon nanotubes) nanocomposite and graphene nano sheets (with high thermal conductivity for fast temperature gradient) as stretchable electrodes.244 A three modal hybrid nanogenerator device that scavenges energy via triboelectric–piezoelectric–pyroelectric effects was reported by S. Wang et al.245 The design was based on a PVDF-nanowire:PDMS composite film as one of the triboelectric layers (nylon is the second layer) and a polarized PVDF film forming both the piezoelectric and pyroelectric layer. Another type of hybrid harvester device was created by coupling the shape memory effect of the TiNiCu alloy with the pyro- and piezoelectric effects of PVDF.246 This pyroelectric harvester combined the superior flexibility of the PVDF film with the large temperature-induced strain of the shape memory alloy to harvest small and quasi-static temperature variations. It delivered an energy density of 0.41 mJ cm−3 per event for a temperature variation of 20 °C. A stack of four of these PVDF SMA-enforced harvesters could power a wireless node instantaneously without any storage unit. D. Zabek et al.247 showed that an enhancement in pyroelectric charge generation upon IR radiation can be achieved with patterned Al top electrodes via an increase in IR absorption directly at the exposed PVDF areas (energy density ∼ 0.067 mJ cm−3 for ΔT ∼ 3 °C, corresponding to a power density of 3 μW cm−3). A very interesting concept is the flexible hybrid energy cell capable of simultaneously or individually harvesting thermal, mechanical and solar energies (Fig. 12e).240 It combined the pyro- and piezoelectric properties of a P(VDF–TrFE) film NG for mechanical and thermal energy harvesting with a ZnO–poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) heterojunction solar cell for harvesting solar energy. The solar cell was based on aligned ZnO nanowire arrays grown on a flexible ITO coated PRT substrate. The hybrid energies were stored in a Li-ion battery, and subsequently used to drive four red LEDs in parallel connection; moreover, by simply touching the hybrid cell, an LCD display could be driven.
A completely different direction was taken by M. Ma et al.248 with a bio-inspired harvesting device, which used a novel actuator material, a water-responsive polymer based on rigid polypyrrole (PPy) chains interlinked with a hydrogel dynamic polyol-borate (PEE) network, as the substrate for a piezoelectric P(VDF–TrFE) film harvester. The PPy–PEE film could exchange water with the environment, resulting in a film expansion or contraction, leading to charge generation in the piezoelectric element. Driven by water gradients and chemical potential driven displacement, a power density of 56 μW kg−1 was achieved for a 100 mg generator. Doping of a PVDF film nanogenerator by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was demonstrated by Tamang et al.,249 whereby DNA formed the agent for the β-phase nucleation. Denatured DNA co-operated to align the molecular –CH2/–CF2 dipoles of PVDF, causing piezoelectricity without electrical poling. The NG was capable of harvesting energy from a variety of easily accessible mechanical stress such as human touch, machine vibration, playing football, joggling, and walking. In another approach, the remote manipulation ability of PVDF under NIR irradiation was exploited for a flexible battery-less implantable device,250 which was constructed by laminated graphene–PVDF–graphene sandwiches, supplying specific electrical pulses for nerve stimulation by NIR irradiation. The flexible and compact device could generate electrical pulses with controllable amplitude and width, showing excellent ability to stimulate nerves by remote control, i.e. sciatic nerve of a frog, and heart of a rat.
A brief overview of the materials, morphologies and performances of ferroelectric polymer energy harvesting nanogenerators (NG) is presented in Table 3. It should be noted that a direct comparison of the generated electricity in the form of VOC or ISC is difficult because the excitation conditions vary greatly in the literature; nevertheless, the parameter VOC* is introduced, which is normalized to either the exerted compressive vertical stress (pressure) or longitudinal stress (strain).
A real-world prototype of an energy harvesting system is schematically depicted in Fig. 13a.252 The proposed design represents a novel renewable acoustic energy harvesting noise barrier using a Helmholtz resonator and a PVDF film, which is employed to convert the acoustic energy of low-frequency noise from high-speed railways into electricity. It consists of four components: a noise collection input module, a sound pressure amplification module, an electricity generator module, and a power storage module. The sound pressure is amplified in the Helmholtz resonator; whereas, the PVDF film in the electricity generator module converts acoustic energy into electric energy, which is stored in supercapacitors. One unit of the system can produce an instantaneous maximum output voltage of 74.6 mV at 110 dB (SPL).

Another NG prototype that exploits the scalability, flexibility and bendability of printed ferroelectric polymer layers was tested for powering a car tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS) (Fig. 13b).253 The all-printed NG was made of a printed P(VDF–TrFE) layer sandwiched between PEDOT:PSS (BE) and carbon (TE) electrodes on PET films. Since car tires are subjected to severe deformations on the road, it is expected that printed NGs (∼68 cm2) directly adhered to the inner surface of a tire can generate enough energy to operate the TPMS chip (including wireless data transmission) without the need for a battery. An electronic circuit was designed to rectify the electrical output of each of the eight printed NGs, store the energy in a capacitor, and regulate the load; thus, enabling the battery-less operation of the TPMS chip, while also sending the correct measured pressure protocols via Bluetooth to a board computer. This PCB circuit was mounted on the rim of the wheel. In a field test, at a speed of 30–50 km h−1, the tire integrated printed NGs produced sufficient energy to power the TPMS chip. Every 30 s the pressure protocol was transmitted correctly via low energy Bluetooth. This example demonstrates the ease-of-integration and superior stability of NGs based on flexible substrates and printed layers.
PVDF was also used in the form of microbelts (PVDF-MB) to convert the energy from low-speed air flow (e.g. respiration) to electricity via their resonant oscillation (Fig. 13c).254 For the microbelts, 10–20 μm thick PVDF thin films were fabricated from commercial films (26 μm thickness) via a top-down reactive ion etching process, where the thickness was controlled by the etching time and the piezoelectric phase was well preserved. Thus, the poling step for making free-standing piezoelectric PVDF thin films was circumvented. The thickness, air flow speed and electrical output relationship was predicted theoretically and characterized experimentally using a lung simulator, where it was proven that the PVDF-MBs oscillate under low-speed air flow and generate electrical energy sufficient for powering small electronic devices. This capability is ideal for harvesting energy from respiration, and thus has the potential to supply implantable biomedical devices.
Furthermore an insole pedometer prototype based on rolled PVDF films and an OTFT circuit for rectification and step counting was proposed.255 Each time the insole is pressed by foot during walking, the harvested energy is rectified and the number of steps is counted. Several papers reported the application of PVDF as an energy harvesting shoulder strap in loaded backpacks. J. Granstrom et al. demonstrated the generation of up to 4 mW for typical load levels in loaded backpacks (20–60 N, 5 Hz).256
Very recently, energy harvesting textiles for rainy day conditions were presented.251 Here, a weaving loom was used to realize textile bands with yarns of melt-spun piezoelectric microfibers consisting of a conducting core surrounded by ferroelectric PVDF in the warp direction (Fig. 13d). The inner electrode was fully shielded from the outer electrode (made of conducting yarns integrated in the weft direction), which prevented shorting under wet conditions. As a result, energy harvesting textiles were produced, which not only continued to function when in contact with water, but even showed an enhanced performance when wet. The piezoelectric textile bands generated an output of several volts at strains below one percent. The integration into the shoulder strap of a laptop case permitted the continuous generation of 4 μW of power during a brisk walk. Finally raindrop energy harvesting was demonstrated with PVDF transducer bridges, which could generate 9 nJ over 20 s from an actual rain event.257
7. Recycling and degradation of PVDF: route towards sustainable sensor materials
PVDF-based polymers and copolymers are an interesting class of materials, and their amazing stability and unique physical/electrical properties (noteworthy here is their self-powering ability) are ascribed to their unique composition comprising carbon, hydrogen and fluorine functional groups. These constituent groups combine with each another in a highly robust matrix, featuring both covalent and hydrogen-bonds. Accordingly, it is not surprising that PVDF materials have not been reported until present to exhibit biodegradable characteristics.258 However, given that in unique environments and special cases, cousin polymers featuring similar building blocks (e.g. polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE) were observed to be slightly biodegradable,259 it is likely that biodegradation properties will be soon identified for PVDF too. Until then, a great deal of effort is directed towards recovering and recycling PVDF-based materials. For example, Chen et al.260 patented a method for the recovery of a PVDF hollow fiber membrane, which involves pre-treating polyvinylidene fluoride waste film filament, where the PVDF film filament, pore former and additive are all dissolved/dispersed in a suitable solution. In a more recent scientific report, X. Wang et al.261 demonstrated a similar method for recycling PVDF hollow fiber membranes.
The other component units employed in conjunction with ferroelectric polymer sensors for the creation of smart systems are thin film transistors, mainly OTFTs, the importance of which was described in Section 3. The most performant TFT circuits are made of inorganic active layers, for example low temperature processing polycrystalline silicon or various amorphous metal oxides (both as dielectrics and as semiconductors).262 Interestingly, these inorganic layers can be tuned to exhibit full biodegradability, if optimum thickness and composition are considered beforehand.263 In recent times, suitable platforms for the fabrication of fully sustainable OTFTs (entirely based on organic active layers) have also been proposed, comprising natural and nature-inspired component layers (dielectrics, semiconductors and smoothening agents) as well as biodegradable or synthetic, but imperceptibly thin plastic substrates.264–269
With respect to their performance, fully based organic circuits operate at much lower frequency compared to their inorganic counterparts, but also suffer from low integration density. To date, the record operating frequency of a lab-bench produced, although highly optimized integrated circuit, fully composed of organic active layers reached 40 MHz,270 but this figure seems questionable to be translated successfully to high-throughput, industrial integration involving scalable methods.271,272 Despite this uncertainty, operating frequencies tapping in the GHz level were proven to be theoretically possible for OTFT-based circuits, if fabrication techniques based on nano- or photo-lithography are employed for drawing highly optimized geometric designs suitable for large-scale industrial throughput.273
Organic-based electronics are envisioned not as a tool meant for usurping the place of their inorganic counterparts in the design of high speed electronic devices, but actually (credited to their soft and conformable nature) as a tool meant for playing an important role of mediator between electronic functionalities, biology and living tissue,274,275 a topic that was recently thoroughly reviewed,276–279 including printable bioelectronics.280 Printable formulations involving a plethora of both organic and inorganic components are envisioned to become a booming market for the next decade and beyond, with OLEDs, quantum dots, flexible LCDs, E-paper and microLEDs reaching a $23.8 billion combined market in 2016, which is thought to exceed $36 billion by 2026.281 This optimistic market evolution is pushed by the rise in inkjet printing for flexible and plastic displays, the comeback of reflective displays into the market, the augmented demand for printed and flexible sensors, the fast development of conductive inks for solar cells manufacturing, and the fast and multifarious development of structural, stretchable, hybrid and distributed electronics as part of the broadly defined Internet of Everything (IoE) concept (Fig. 14).
 Fig. 14  Elements of printed and flexible electronics for a sustainable form of the internet of everything. 
It is easy to imagine the challenges that humanity will face in reaching the abovementioned market driven goals, which include material availability, production efficiency, cost-effective exploitation and finally safe removal, recycling, recovery and ideally, even degradation at the end-of-life cycle for every single IoE component. Accordingly, all materials constituting the component modules of the IoE that find themselves at the end-of-life and/or not-fit-for-reuse or reprocessing through recycling due to economic and environmental reasons are ideally expected to undergo biodegradation. For example, in the European Union, biodegradation testing can be performed only by authorized entities using conventional biological technologies of aerobic and anaerobic digestion and composting (following independent or sequentially combined treatment tests), in accordance with the European Union Standard EN 13432 issued in January 2016: “Certification Scheme: Products made of Compostable Materials”. This set of tests was proposed by certificating companies DIN CERTCO (Germany) and Vinçotte (Belgium), both being members of the European Bioplastics Organization. Following a successful certification, the logo and the certificate number printed on the product will assist end-users in their decision to purchase and finally dispose the product (either being a packaging product or another application).
Briefly, the main aspects of this standard intended to evaluate the compostability of every component material (or of an end-product) are as follows: (i) chemical test: disclosure of all constituents is required prior to the test, as well as the threshold values for heavy metals that each material needs to adhere to. (ii) Biodegradability in controlled composting conditions (i.e. including oxygen consumption and production of CO2). Accordingly, proof must be given that at least 90% of the organic material is converted into CO2 within 6 months. (iii) Disintegration: after 3 months of composting and subsequent sifting through a 2 mm sieve, no more than 10% residue compared to the original mass may remain. (iv) Practical compostability test: in a semi-industrial (or industrial) composting facility, the product should demonstrate no negative influence on the composting process; and finally (v) ecotoxicity test (agronomic test): examination of the effect of the resultant compost on plant growth. The technical objective of the above exemplified standard is to check and demonstrate the biodegradability (second key condition after bio-based origin for renewable plastics and carbon-based organic materials) of the end-of-life of newly designed materials. The aim of the certification and obviously the desire of any material designer and product manufacturer is to comply with the Zero Waste/Zero Landfill/Zero Debris in Nature.
The critical point of the intricate design of the European standard dealing with compostable materials exemplified above is that designing a novel functional material or product for an emerging market may generate a cumbersome and lengthy certification process under the abiding worldwide regulations overviewing its compostability and biodegradability. This process may eventually represent an absolutely critical, key legal and economic, and ultimately competitiveness differentiation factor compared to simply employing alternative, truly bio-based and/or truly biodegradable, natural origin materials from the very beginning of the respective product design. However, to do this, we must learn first how natural systems work and what is their ultimate potential, and the recent effort of the scientific community is meant to fully fill this knowledge gap.282–286
Conclusions
Although the goal of comprehensive sustainability of ferroelectric polymer technologies has not yet been achieved, these materials will certainly become one of the most useful elements in the current rolling wave of IoE and digitization since they are unique due to their multifunctionality, versatility and ease of processing, as highlighted in this review. In particular, printed ferroelectric polymer devices will make their way towards object and/or skin-integrated sensors for diverse mechanical, thermal and vital parameters, also in combination with other sensor materials, since they are selective, highly responsive, self-powering, scalable and, with slightly modified structure, can be used for harvesting waste energy from mechanical and thermal sources, for data storage and for actuation. Nevertheless, with the advent of the IoE epoch, humanity will face a maturity test in leaving a clean environment heritage to its future generations. For attaining this, a unified binding legislation (necessarily drawn by United Nations) applicable to every corner of the world where IoE components will be commercialized, is absolutely necessary with respect to component materials, their valorization, recovery and ultimately bio-degradation at the end of their lifecycle. We should be equally aware of the infinite advantages offered by the emerging IoE technology, but also of the dire consequences of non-sustainable IoE development in terms of aggressive resource exploitation, energy consumption, and environmental stress due to generating non-degradable products at the end of lifecycle.

 	Fig. 1  Multimodal sensing and sustainability. Physical parameters that can be detected with ferroelectric polymer sensors or harvested with ferroelectric nanogenerators. Sensors and harvesters are envisioned to become sustainably embedded in the natural environment. Examples of the response of screen-printed PVDF copolymer sensors to specific excitations are displayed in the boxes. Force & pressure: sensing of an impact event with a loading of up to 10 kN by an array of four flexible sensors, where the graph compares the time behavior of the registered sum force to the reference force measured with a commercial load cell. Strain & bending: charge generated in flexible sensors for dynamic lateral strain (0.03%) depending on the sensor area. Temperature & IR-radiation: gesture control of a printed electrochromic display via pyroelectric sensing of human body radiation by a sensor array with IR-absorbing carbon top electrodes. A hand induced temperature increase of the two left pixels turns on the stop symbol; whereas, the play symbol is activated by approaching the two right pixels. Vital parameters and motion: pulse waves registered by a stretchable sensor attached to a human fingertip, where the charge curve reproduces the typical radial artery pulse waveform. Vibration & acoustics: audio signal registered by a flexible microphone sensor mounted on the back of a metal part, triggered by a tapping pen.

 	Fig. 2  Basics of ferroelectric polymers. (a) Schematic of the transformation process from an α-crystal spherulite to a β-crystal of PVDF by mechanical uniaxial drawing with corresponding images from stress polarization microscopy taken upon in situ observation of the transformation during stretching. The transition region starts from the middle of the spherulite with an extension of the α-phase molecular chains along the stretching direction (deformation of the α-phase) followed by expansion of the extended chains transversely along the middle (emerging of β-phase) and finally the entire spherulite transforms into the β-phase under large deformation with more and more extended chains being formed. Adapted with permission from ref. 48 Copyright 2014, The Royal Society of Chemistry. (b) Electric field, E, dependence on the electric displacement D (blue) and the poling current, Ipoling, (black) of a P(VDF–TrFE) layer with 70:30 mol% composition sandwiched between electrode layers made of PEDOT:PSS. All layers were fabricated by screen printing and the thickness of the ferroelectric and electrode layers was about 6 μm and 300 nm, respectively. The remnant polarization, Pr, and the coercive field, Ec, are indicated by arrows. The displacement curve was generated by integration of the area-normalized poling current curve. Below, the switching of the PVDF polymer chain is schematically illustrated as a rotation of the molecules and associated dipole moments around the backbone. Reproduced with permission from ref. 61 Copyright 2011, Materials Today. (c) Dependence of Pr on the composition of the P(VDF:TrFE) layer, as derived by Furukawa,46 for uniaxial drawn extruded copolymer films, where the dotted line is a guideline for the eye. The Pr values for the spin-on copolymer layers were taken from the following references: Stadlober,62 Neumann,63 Mahdi64 and Mao.65 The Pr values for the screen-printed P(VDF–TrFE) layers were taken from Zirkl,66 Dietze,67 Wagle68 and Sekine,69 and that for the inkjet-printed copolymer layers were taken from Sekitani,70 Pabst71 and Thuau.72 The compact line is a linear fit to the values of all the printed copolymer layers. The inset displays the monomer VDF–TrFE and was adapted with permission from ref. 69 Copyright 2018, Nature Publishing Group.	 

 	Fig. 3  Structure of ferroelectric polymer sensors and harvesters and how they work. (a) P(VDF–TrFE) layer morphologies as realized in different sensors and nanogenerator setups. P(VDF–TrFE) is manufactured as a thin film by spin coating or printing, (free standing) webs made of statistically aligned electrospun or drawn nanowires/microfibers, horizontally aligned nanowires/microfibers made by electrospinning, and vertically aligned arrays of nanowires, micropillars, micropyramids and microdomes made by nanoimprinting/embossing, template-assisted molding/infiltration and electrohydrodynamic pulling. (b) Functional principle of piezo- and pyroelectric sensors and nanogenerators in a plate capacitor configuration, where the ferroelectric layer with the macroscopic polarization P3 is sandwiched between the electrode layers. There is no external electric field applied. External mechanical stress variations dσ33 (tensile stress transverse to film plane), dσ11 (tensile stress longitudinal in film plane) and thermal fluctuations dT will induce changes in the dipole density across the sample volume, and thus change P3. For the bending mode the dashed line indicates that the neutral mechanical plane is located deep in the substrate, whose thickness is much higher than that of the sensor (not scaled appropriately here). Accordingly, the sensor located on the upper substrate surface experiences tensile strain. The polarization change, dP3, will result in fluctuations in the charge density at the electrodes, delivering either a piezo- or pyroelectric current, Ipiezo or Ipyro, respectively. The material parameters, which couple the mechanical or thermal excitations to the fluctuations of the polarization, are the piezoelectric coefficients d33 and d31 and the pyroelectric coefficient p3.	 

 	Fig. 4  Pressure and strain sensors utilizing ferroelectric polymers. (a) Flexible three-axial tactile sensor based on a P(VDF–TrFE) micropillar array sandwiched between four square electrode pairs and covered with a pyramid-shaped PDMS bump for optimized force distribution to the pillar array. With the four distributed piezoelectric sensing units both vertical and shear force can be detected with sensitivities in the range of 0.3–0.4 V N−1. Reproduced with permission from ref. 91 Copyright 2018, IOP Publishing. (b) Transparent piezoelectric nanogenerator matrix allowing for multistage mechanosensation based on a copolymer ferroelectric film sandwiched between two PDMS sheets with patterned graphene electrodes. The sensor matrix responds to tensile and compressive strain (1st stage) and detects the area of the detached and released top PDMS sheet (2nd stage), both with high temporal and spatial accuracy. The sensitivity upon vertical force was improved by the groove pattern in the bottom PDMS sheet, resulting in a sensitivity of 0.16 V N−1 for pressures <20 kPa. Reproduced with permission from ref. 125 Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society. (c) Freestanding films made of perfectly aligned and multiple joint nanofibers. As illustrated by the highly anisotropic elliptic profile of the 2D FFT of the SEM images, the joints of the nanofibers do not decrease their parallel alignment. Dynamic bending tests and voltage response as a function of the thickness of the PI support (red line = 75 μm, green line = 150 μm, and blue line = 225 μm). A pressure sensor sheet with attached mass showed perfectly linear dependence on the voltage output on the orientation angle. Adapted with permission from ref. 79 Copyright 2013, Macmillan Publishers Limited. (d) Composite PVDF/rGO films (1–10% rGO) with molded microdome array surfaces fabricated on Au-metallized PET sheets. By laminating two of the sheets, interlocking of the microdomes was achieved. These interlocked microdome films were sensitive to static and dynamic pressures with ∼5 nA kPa−1 sensitivity above and 35 nA kPa−1 below 2.45 kPa and were superior to planar PVDF and PVDF/rGO composite films. According to the increase in the proportion of the piezoelectric channel at the expense of the piezoresistive channel in dynamic events, the voltage and current response both increased with frequency upon sequential impact pressure loading against a static load of about 9 kPa.

 	Fig. 6  Ferroelectric polymers for tissue regeneration and vital parameter sensing. (a) Nanocomposite membrane films made of polydopamine-coated BaTiO3 (BTO) nanoparticles dispersed in a P(VDF–TrFE) matrix for optimized bone regeneration via enhanced migration of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) followed by encouraged differentiation into osteoblasts. The surface potential of the membrane was tuned by electric poling to conform to the level of endogenous biopotential; thus, mimicking the electric microenvironment for optimum cell function and tissue repair. Micro-CT and sagittal view images and histological sections 4 and 12 weeks after implantation demonstrate the bone defect repair in rat calvarial models after implantation of polarized nanomembranes with 5 vol% BTO and polarized neat P(VDF–TrFE) membranes (NB, nascent bone; MC, medullary cavity; V blood vessel; OT, osteoid tissue; and MT, mineralized tissue).

(b) Field-supported growing process of aligned and in situ poled P(VDF–TrFE) nanowires in an AAO template on an Au-coated PI film. The flexible piezoelectric nanowire film had PEDOT:PSS electrodes and enabled the detection of finger motion, breathing, pulse and low magnitude (2 Pa at 100 dB) sound waves.

(c) Ferroelectric skin with pressure sensing layer made of two interlocked microdome sheets for monitoring artery pulse pressure waveforms at different skin temperatures (20–40 °C) and before/after exercise. The radial artery augmentation index AIR = P2/P1 and the radial diastolic augmentation index DAI = P3/P1 decreased linearly with temperature. The texture perception of this skin was enhanced by an elastomer groove texture on the electrode surface, which allowed the perception of textures with different roughness, as shown by the short-time Fourier transform spectra of the current response for scanning at 2.5 mm s−1.

(d) Wireless piezoelectric sensor based on an electrospun fiber web made of a PVDF/BaTiO3-NW nanocomposite. The BTO nanowires were incorporated in the electrospun fibers. When integrated in the insole of a shoe, the sensor could differentiate human motion such as squatting, walking and running. It can also detect elbow flexion and sound pressures from human voice.

Bottom: Thermal image of a circular source at 60 °C using the 16 × 16 PVDF pyroelectric sensor and F/3 ZnSe optics. Adapted with permission from ref. 153 Copyright 2000, IEEE. (b) Passive light-point localization of an intensity-modulated IR laser diode via a PVDF film with a low and high conductive PEDOT:PSS electrode. The electric signals were measured at the corners of the film and their amplitude depended on the position of the exciting spot. The interpolated signal landscapes for measuring on each of the corner ports are displayed. Reproduced with permission from ref. 156 Copyright 2016, Elsevier B.V. (c) ZnO nanorods/nanodisks embedded in PVDF film coated on an rGO-treated PET film with inkjet-printed rGO top electrode. The change in resistance ΔR upon loading of 30 Pa was highest for the PVDF/ZnO nanorods; whereas, their response and recovery times were smaller compared to that for nanodisks or pure PVDF thin films. Both the magnitude and recovery time of ΔR increased with the temperature, which allowed both the pressure and temperature of water droplets impacting on the sensor to be simultaneously measured.

(d) Composite PVDF–rGO film with interlocked microdome geometry for simultaneous monitoring of temperature and pressure of loaded water droplets. The time-dependent variation of the relative resistances R/R0 is displayed for temperatures varying from 23–60 °C and pressures from 2–4 Pa.

 	Fig. 9  Printed ferroelectric polymer sensors and their properties. (a) Backscattered scanning electron microscopy images of screen-printed composites of (0–3) PZT particles in a P(VDF–TrFE)56:44 matrix. Up to 40 vol%, the PZT particles are statistically dispersed, and for 50 vol% porous regions are observed especially near the substrate (highlighted by arrows). The pyro- and piezoelectric coefficients of the composite, p3 and d33, respectively, depend on the PZT content. Adapted with permission from ref. 67 Copyright 2007, Elsevier B.V. (b) Polarization loops of inkjet-printed P(VDF–TrFE)80:20 layers for different annealing temperatures, TA. Pr is maximized (84 mC m−2) for 130 °C ≤ TA ≤ 140 °C, in a range where the RMS surface roughness of the inkjet-printed layers is below 20 nm. For TA = 150 °C, partial melting of the copolymer occurs, increasing the layer roughness and decreasing Pr. Reproduced with permission from ref. 70 Copyright 2009, IEEE. (c) DSC spectra and AFM height images of inkjet-printed P(VDF–TrFE)70:30 layers revealing the Curie temperatures upon heating and cooling, Tc1,2, the melting temperature, Tm, and the crystallization temperature and an RMS surface roughness <4 nm. Reproduced with permission from ref. 72 Copyright 2017, The Royal Society of Chemistry. (d) (top left) Hysteresis loops of the electric displacement, D, of sensors fabricated by screen printing a GBL-based P(VDF–TrFE)80:20 paste on PET sandwiched between printed PEDOT:PSS electrodes as a function of the drying temperature and the type of underlay (metal, paper/metal). SEM images of the cross sections of the differently dried copolymer layers on metal underlay are displayed as well as surface AFM height and phase images. (top middle) The dependence of p3 on D0 (∼Pr) reveals a linear correlation, and a photo of the screen-printed sensors with printed Ag interconnections is displayed in the inset. (bottom left) The variation of D0 is plotted over 96 P(VDF–TrFE)70:30 sensors printed on one sheet (displayed in the inset) and demonstrates 100% yield with D0 ∼ 70 mC m−2 and less than 2% standard deviation. The D0 values for 16 sensors each after thermal shock (100 times cycling between +70 °C and −25 °C) and temperature storage (10 days at 40 °C and 90% RH) are also plotted as black and grey columns, respectively, as well as (bottom middle) SFN before and after thermal shock measured with a hydraulic pressure stamp. SFN decreased by ∼10% due to the stress, which is not the case for D0. On the right the current and charge response of a single piezoelectric sensor element for sequential loading of 100 g is shown. The charge response (green) is derived from the current response (red) by integration; it follows the load signal curve (blue). Source: own work unpublished. (e) Surface profiles and AFM images of P(VDF–TrFE) layers fabricated by screen printing of ferroelectric inks with different solvents (MEK, CHN, DMSO, DMF, and TMP, where polarity increases from left to right). The surface roughness increases with increasing polarity, and also the crystallite sizes and the polarizations. Reproduced with permission from ref. 69 Copyright 2017, Nature Publishing Group.	 

 	Fig. 10  Performance and applications of ferroelectric polymer sensors fabricated via scalable methods (printing). (a) R2R-compatible continuous impregnation of polyester fabrics with PVDF/graphene composite followed by phase separation during dissolving of the liquid phase in a water bath. Due to the induction of graphene and water upon phase separation, a parallel arrangement of the PVDF chains was achieved resulting in the formation of an electroactive PVDF phase with high crystallinity, as demonstrated by the HR-TEM images. Sensitivity upon normal forces of SFN up to 34 V N−1 was reported, which was slightly larger for PVDF/graphene@F than PVDF@F. Piezoelectric fabric sensors sewn in a face mask could detect syllables via voice-induced air flow. Adapted with permission from ref. 130 Copyright 2018, American Chemical Society. (b) All-printed active matrix pyroelectric sensor array for touchless human–machine interaction based on screen-printed pyroelectric sensors, printed OECTs and printed OECDs. The pyroelectric voltage response induced by an intensity-modulated NIR laser diode was higher for the sensors with carbon top electrodes and decreased with increasing frequency in accordance with 1D multilayer thermal conduction models. The display elements were activated either by human body motion or by switching a laser diode that controlled the ON–OFF state of an OECT via the gate-connected sensor output voltage. Adapted with permission from ref. 66 Copyright 2011, Wiley VCH Verlag. (c) All-screen-printed ultrasonic transducers based on P(VDF–TrFE) sensors integrated on perfect acoustically matched PEI substrate. The output spectra (in dB) of the first reflection for transducers with four different sizes and designs are shown together with the measured spectrum of the driver pulse (violet curve). The frequency response was estimated from the ratio between the output and input spectra of the first reflection, which revealed a central frequency of 100 MHz. Adapted with permission from ref. 68 Copyright 2013, AIP Publishing. (d) Printed ferroelectric pulse rate monitors fabricated on PEN films supporting wireless communication based on a circuit with a noninverting amplifier, op-amp, high/low-pass filter and a Bluetooth module. The real-time pulse wave monitoring of the radial artery blood flow with the vital sensor attached to the neck revealed an AI of 62.5%, typical for a healthy female. The tablet shows the wireless transmitted pulse wave signal measured with the printed sensor mounted on the wrist. Adapted with permission from ref. 69 Copyright 2018, Nature Publishing Group. (e) Mass-printed piezoelectric loudspeaker with an area of 128 cm2 integrated on PET substrate. The audio amplifier consists of printed OTFTs, printed PEDOT:PSS resistors, printed PVDF-based capacitors and printed Ag contact pads. Acoustic output of the audio amplifier at 1 m distance above the loudspeaker, with Vinput = 800 mV rms sinus signal at VDD = 80 V, demonstrating a maximum SPL of 60 dB between 1 and 3 kHz.

 	Fig. 11  Prototypical object-integrated human–machine interfaces supporting the IoE scenario. (a) 3D-shaped user interface in the form of an interactive plastic console, comprising printed pressure-sensitive keys, printed wiring and pick & place assembled microLEDs for backlighting of the keys. The process flow starts with the 2D substrate laminate (PET/PC), which is first covered with conduction lines, contact pads and adhesives via screen printing and then functionalized by screen printing of ferroelectric sensors and pick & place assembly of microLEDs and resistors. After lamination of a protective film on the as-functionalized film, high-pressure forming against a mold is the final step, which defines the shape of the console. The microLEDs and the piezoelectric keys remain functional after 3D-forming. Source: own work, unpublished. (b) Motion-sensitive floor made of printed piezoelectric sensor films laminated in the parquet floorboard structure (see cross-section). On the right side, the signal upon tapping with a foot is visualized on the display in real-time, where the graphs show the signal forms generated for slow walking over a 3 or 5 layer parquet. The different phases of foot rolling (heel down, rolling, and toe up) could clearly and reproducibly be distinguished from each other. Source: own work, unpublished. (c) Pyroelectric active sensor matrix for proximity detection, where each printed ferroelectric sensor pixel is coupled to the source of a monolithically integrated organic transistor. When the transistor is switched On (by applying a small negative voltage to the gate e.g. −3 V to the OTFT in the first row, second column), the sensor forces a pyroelectric current through the transistor (∼drain current), which is inversely proportional to the distance between the hand and sensor. The sensor reacts on temperature waves induced in the ferroelectric layer by human body radiation and transduces them into a charge flow (or a current). Here, the source and drain were connected to the same potential (ground). Source: own work, unpublished. (d) Interactive smart card made of a flexible electrophoretic display and a flexible printed 3 × 5 piezoelectric input sensor laminated to the back of the display. The smart card combines several customer and credit cards, among which you can switch by bending. The input sensor also supports pressure-sensitive touch, which is exploited for typing a customized PIN code. Reproduced with permission from ref. 212 Copyright ACM UIST, 2014.
