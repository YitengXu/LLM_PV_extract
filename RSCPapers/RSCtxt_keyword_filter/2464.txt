    AbstractSingle crystalline SnO2 nanorod arrays with controlled size and high orientation consistency have been fabricated on a substrate in large scale by using a hydrothermal approach, and used as the photoanode in a Grätzel-type solar cell.
One-dimensional(1D) semiconductor materials have attracted great research interest because of their importance both in fundamental research and in technological applications. In recent years, considerable efforts have been devoted to constructing 1D semiconductor materials on substrates, because well-aligned one-dimensional materials are critical to enhance their performance and expand their practical applications. For example, single crystal ZnO or TiO2 nanorods arrays used as photoanodes in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) could offer direct electrical pathways for photogenerated electrons and increase the electron transport rate, which can improve the performance of these kind of DSSCs.1–3 SnO2, as a wide band-gap semiconductor, has been widely investigated in many fields such as transparent conductive electrodes, gas sensors and dye-sensitized solar cells. Comparing to TiO2 and ZnO, SnO2 is also a promising photoanode material for DSSCs because of its suitable band gap and fast electron mobility. Due to a lower conduction band edge position of SnO2, high efficiency of electron injection from the absorbed dye can be expected. Furthermore, the mobility of charge carriers reported in both single crystal SnO2 as well as other nanostructures are orders of magnitude higher than that in both single crystal TiO24 and ZnO5 nanorods/nanowires, so, the recombination possibility of photogenerated electrons and holes can be restrained, and relatively high photo to electric conversion efficiency could be obtained. Until now, only SnO2 nanowire based dye sensitized solar cells have been reported, and they exhibit an open circuit voltage of 560 mV, which is 200 mV higher than that SnO2 nanoparticle based cells.6 None of the efforts have been focused on single crystal SnO2 nano arrays based DSSCs.
In recent years, several methods, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD),7 thermal evaporation (TE),8 template,9 anodization10 and hydrothermal approaches,11 have been developed for fabricating well-aligned 1D SnO2 nano arrays. Although many methods were used to synthesize SnO2 arrays, size controlled preparation of SnO2 arrays has not been realized. It is well known that the size of nanorod arrays affect their properties such as optical, field emission and photoelectrochemical properties. However, the effect of the size of SnO2 nanorod arrays (SNRAs) on the photoelectrochemical performance of SNRAs based DSSCs has not been investigated yet.
Based on the above discussions, in this paper, size controlled SNRAs were synthesized by using a hydrothermal approach and used as DSSC photoanodes. Furthermore, Mott-Schottky analyses and SNRAs-based DSSCs were also discussed.
The SNRAs were synthesized by a hydrothermal process. The precursor solutions (30 ml) consisted of 0.03 mol L−1 SnCl4·5H2O and 0.3 mol L−1 NaOH in the presence of 3 mol L−1 NaCl. The hydrothermal growth was carried out at 200 °C for 24 h in the sealed Teflon-lined autoclave by immersing Ti substrates in precursor solutions. Ti substrates were previously coated with a thin SnO2 buffer layer by a magnetron sputtering method. After the reaction finished, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature naturally. Subsequently, the as-deposited substrates were rinsed repeatedly with deionized water and dried in air for further characterization.
The deposited substrates were immersed in dry ethanol containing 0.3 mmol L−1 of N719 dye for 40 min. To assemble the solar cells, a Pt-coated conducting glass was placed on the SNRAs separated by a 50 μm thin membrane spacer. The assembled cell was then clipped together as an open cell. An electrolyte, which was made with 0.05 mol L−1 LiI, 0.05 mol L−1 I2, 0.6 mol L−1 dimethylpropylimidazolium iodide and 0.5 mol L−1tert-butylpyridine in dry acetonitrile, was injected into the open cell from the edges by capillarity.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were taken using FE-SEM (Zeiss Supra-55 operated at 10 keV) which was equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using a powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku Dmax-2000 diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images were observed by JEOL JEM-2010 at the accelerating voltage of 200 kV. Current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the cell were measured under the irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 (AM 1.5) with a simulated solar light source and AM 1.5 spectral filter.
Mott–Schottky characterizations were done on a separate sample utilizing a three-electrode system, using the SNRAs on the Ti substrates as the working electrode, a platinum foil as the counter electrode, and a saturated-calomel-electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. The measurements were performed at room temperature in 0.1 mol L−1 aqueous Na2SO4 solution. A surface of 0.09 cm2 is isolated on the SNRAs and exposed to the electrolyte. The potential scan is carried out from −1 V/SCE to +1 V/SCE using a ± 10 mV amplitude signal at 1 kHz. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was carried out by using a potentiostat (EG&G, M283) equipped with a frequency response detector (EG&G, FRD100).
Typical SEM images of the SNRAs are shown in Fig. 1. Uniform SNRAs are formed on the Ti substrates in large-scale with narrow size distribution of nanorods (Fig.1 (a)), and the SNRAs are vertically aligned on the Ti substrates (Fig.1 (b)). From Fig.1 (c), it can be seen that the nanorods with square cross section are observed clearly. These nanorods are estimated to be about 100 nm in width and 1 μm in length, and the aspect ratio of the nanorods is up to 1:10 when concentration of NaCl solution is about 3 mol L−1. For comparison, a NaCl solution with low concentration was tested. Fig. 1(d) shows an FE-SEM image of the deposited films by using 0.12 mol L−1 NaCl. It can be clearly seen that the nanorods size (about 380 nm) is much larger than that of the nanorods (about 100 nm) prepared by using 3 mol L−1 NaCl. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that NaCl plays a key role to decrease the size of the nanorods. Firstly, addition of NaCl in precursor solution for growth of SnO2 nanorods could increase the ionic strength of the growth solution, and higher ionic strength favours the formation of smaller crystals through electrostatic screening. Secondly, relatively high concentration of Cl− may retard formation of SnO2 by changing the composition or coordination structure of the growing unit.12 Thirdly, during the formation of SnO2 nanorod, Cl− ions are easily adsorbed on the side surfaces (110) plane of rutile SnO2 to form a close layer, and this layer of Cl− ions next to the nanorods can act as a diffusion barrier for the nanorods growth and retard the precursors from diffusing to the surfaces.13,14 Growth of SnO2 nanorod can then be suppressed in the [110] direction, and accelerated along the [001] direction. Therefore, the size of the nanorods could be decreased by adding NaCl. That is to say, by adjusting the concentration of NaCl in the growth solution, the size of the SnO2 nanorods can be controlled.

The structure of the SNRAs, which were synthesized by using 3 mol L−1 NaCl, is determined by XRD, as shown in Fig. 2. The diffraction peaks can be indexed to those of SnO2 on Ti substrate. The pattern associated with SnO2 reveals a rutile structure (tetragonal, P42/mnm), which matches well with the standard data file of SnO2 (JCPDS file No.41-1445). The peaks of SnO2 at 2θ = 26.6°, 33.8°, 51.6° are assigned to (110), (101), (211) diffraction peaks of rutile SnO2. Remarkably enhanced (002) peak and weakened (110) peak are also observed, indicating that the SNRAs grow along [001] direction and orient perfectly with their c-axis. This phenomenon is also confirmed by Fig. 1(b), which reveals that SnO2 nanorods are perpendicularly to the substrate surface.

Structural properties of the SNRAs, which were synthesized by using 3 mol L−1 NaCl, were further studied by TEM and HRTEM as shown in Fig. 3(a) and Fig. 3(b). The surface observed in Fig. 3(b) corresponds to the side wall as indicated in Fig.3(a). From Fig. 3(b), it can be seen that the SnO2 nanorod is a single crystal. The spacing of the lattice fringes is about 0.34 nm, which can be indexed as the (110) plane of rutile structure SnO2, suggesting that the growth direction of the SNRAs is along [001]. This may be explained by the Cl− in the precursor solutions which could preferentially adsorb on (110) crystal faces of SnO2 with rutile structure and retard the growth rate of these surfaces, leading to the formation of nanorods which grow preferentially along [001] direction. Fig. 3(c) is an EDS spectrum obtained from a single nanorod in the HRTEM image (Fig. 3(b)). It is shown that the components of the nanorod are Sn and O. There are also Cu peaks in the EDS spectrum, which come from the copper grids used in the TEM measurement.

To understand the difference in electronic properties of the SNRAs-based electrodes, Mott–Schottky (MS) measurements were performed by using the impedance technique.15 MS theory16 is commonly used to evaluate the carrier concentration and flat-band potential based on the following equation: (1) Where e is the electronic charge unit, ND is the carrier concentration (cm−3), ε0 is the permittivity of free space, ε is the relative permittivity (10 for SnO217), E is the applied potential (V), Efb is the flat band potential (V), k is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. If the system obeys Mott-Schottky behavior, the evolution of 1/C2 is a linear function of the applied potential.

Fig. 4 shows the Mott-Schottky plots for the SNRAs measured at frequencies of 1 kHz. They are linear from −0.7 to +0.2 V and consistent with the shape of an n-type semiconductor. According to Fig. 4, the Efb could be obtained from the x-intercept of the linear region of the Mott-Schottky plots. The Efb of the SNRAs is −0.71 V. The carrier concentration can also be calculated by using the slope of the linear region of the Mott-Schottky plots. The ND of the SNRAs is 3.2 × 1018 cm−3. The Efb value is shifted negatively compared to bulk SnO2-based electrode (−0.19V).18 The negative shift shows the presence of a large number of surface states in the as-prepared SNRAs-based electrode, which change the band position of the SNRAs.19,20 It is well known that the presence of a large number of surface states can lead to a considerable change of the band position. Also, a multitude of surface states might have caused the observed broadening of PL emission spectra. Broadening of PL emission spectra is always observed for SnO2 synthesized by the hydrothermal method in our study.21 This shows that significant numbers of surface states are formed during the SnO2 synthesizing process.

The photovoltaic performances of the DSSCs fabricated from different sizes of SNRAs were evaluated under the same condition chosen to simulate sunlight (AM1.5, 100 mW cm−2). The conversion efficiency (η) is calculated using the formula η = (Jm × Vm)/Pin × 100%, where Jm, Vm and Pin represent the maximum photocurrent density and the maximum photovoltage obtained from the cell, and the illumination power input, respectively. The fill factor (ff) is expressed as ff = (Jm × Vm)/(Jsc × Voc), where the Jsc and Voc are short-circuit photocurrent density and open-circuit voltage, respectively.

Fig. 5 shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics for the different sized SNRAs; the large size nanorod array (sample A) is synthesized in a 0.12 mol L−1 NaCl precursor solution, while the small size nanorod array (sample B) is fabricated in a 3 mol L−1 NaCl precursor solution. The cell parameters are summarized in Table 1. From Table 1, it is indicated that the short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc), open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (ff) of sample A are 0.56 mA cm−2, 414 mV and 0.56, respectively, yielding a conversion efficiency (η) of 0.13% of the cell. Comparing with sample A, sample B shows a relatively higher conversion efficiency of about 0.40%, with a short circuit current of 2.19 mA cm−2 and open circuit voltage of 484 mV. This phenomenon may be ascribed to the smaller average size and higher porosity of SNRAs in sample B than those of SNRAs in sample A. For nanorod array film, it is well known that small size (average diameter of the nanorods) and long length of the nanorods (film thickness) could lead to large specific surface area of the films.22 Generally, the photoconversion efficiency increases, in a certain range, with increasing specific surface area of nanocrystalline film because films with larger specific area provide a larger amount of absorbed dyes and more photon-capturing changes. Extending reaction time is always an effective method to increase the length of nanorod arrays, which may lead to the relatively high conversion efficiency of this type of solar cell. Also, repeated growth of nanorod arrays on Ti substrate by using refreshing precursor solutions would also be profitable for thicker nanorod array films. The overall yield obtained in our experiments is quite close to that of the solar cells based on SnO2 nanowire film with a thickness of 25–30 μm prepared by doctor blade technique.6 However, when considering the facts that the thickness of SnO2 film used in our experiments is only about 1 μm, it may be concluded that the photo-to-electric conversion efficiency of the dye-sensitized SnO2 nanorod array electrode is much higher when the film thickness is the same. In addition, when compared to the DSSCs based on TiO2 nanostructures grown on Ti foil,23 the as-prepared SNRAs based DSSCs also have higher conversion efficiency under the same conditions. The relatively high efficiency observed for SNRAs can be ascribed to the as-prepared film nanostructure. Every SnO2 nanorod is a single crystal that could provide a channel for the photogenerated electrons transporting directly through the oriented nanorods to the conducting substrates. This greatly reduces the recombination losses of the photogenerated charge–carriers due to fewer grain boundaries in charge the transportation process. The preparation of thicker SNRAs and the study of their photoelectrochemical properties are in progress in our group.

In summary, well-oriented SNRAs have been fabricated by using a hydrothermal approach and used as photoanodes in a Grätzel-type solar cell. XRD and HRTEM results show that the SNRAs consist of single crystalline SnO2 nanorods with rutile structure. SEM results indicate that the diameter of the nanorods could be controlled by changing the addition of NaCl. Mott-Schottky analysis displays a high carrier density of 3.2 × 1018 cm−3 and a flat band potential of −0.71 V of the as-prepared SNRAs. The DSSCs based on SNRAs show an energy conversion efficiency of 0.4%. The preparation of thicker SNRAs with small size and the study of their photoelectrochemical properties are in progress in our group.
