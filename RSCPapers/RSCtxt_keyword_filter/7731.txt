Up to 94% transmittance for Pt network electrodes can be obtained when the sheet resistances are over 170 Ω sq−1. The CV and EIS analyses of the Pt networks reveal a comparable electrocatalytic behavior with the thermally deposited Pt particles on FTO glass. A photoelectric-conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.82% was obtained by utilizing Pt networks as CEs in TNAR based DSSCs and maintained >90% PCE after 200 bending cycles. Such metal network based electrodes would be widely used not only in flexible solar cells but also in other wearable, lightweight electronic devices.
1 Introduction
With the development of portable and light-weight electronic products, more and more flexible and even foldable energy harvesting and storage devices are required. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), as a low-cost alternative to silicon based solar cells, have attracted extensive attention in the last two decades due to their easy fabrication and relatively high conversion efficiency.1–3 Compared with the DSSCs based on rigid and brittle conductive glass, flexible DSSCs possess certain superiorities in weight, volume, transportation, installation and roll-to-roll production. To obtain high-quality crystalline and good adhesive semi-conductive photoanodes for DSSCs, high temperature annealing (up to 450 °C) is usually required,4,5 while this process largely restricts the use of flexible transparent conducting oxide (TCO) plastic substrates. As an alternative to plastic substrates, Ti foil is usually employed as a suitable photoanode substrate due to its high flexibility, conductivity and excellent thermal stability.6,7 Besides, it is also suitable for large-area fabrication of highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNARs) by electrochemical anodization.8–10 However, Ti foils are non-transparent, which limits the configuration of DSSCs to back-side illumination. Therefore, counter electrodes (CEs) with good transmittance, high flexibility and excellent catalytic activity are keenly needed.
Among various flexible CEs, platinum (Pt) is an excellent candidate because of its ideal catalytic activity to reduce the redox couple. Several low temperature techniques have been employed to fabricate semi-transparent Pt electrodes on polymer substrates, including sputtering,11,12 electrodeposition,13,14 atomic-layer-deposition (ALD),15 chemical reduction,16etc. However, some issues still exist in these techniques: firstly, all the Pt CEs fabricated by the aforementioned techniques require an additional indium tin oxide (ITO) film which is brittle and prone to cracking under the bending or torsion force.17–21 Secondly, the compromise among the transmittance, electrocatalytic activity and cost is difficult to control. For example, directly sputtering Pt onto flexible substrates is a fast and reliable process, but it will greatly reduce the transmittance.22,23 Electrodeposition (ED) can provide transparent CEs but leads to an inhomogeneous distribution of nanoparticles.24 The ALD technique can fabricate highly uniform and transparent Pt CEs, but it is time-consuming and not cost-effective which restricts its industrial production.25
Electrospinning26–28 has been reported as an effective method to fabricate continuous polymer fibers and even transparent electrodes, which has attracted great interest due to its low cost and scalability properties. Among them, Cui's group demonstrates the practical suitability of transparent conducting gold electrodes by fabricating a flexible touch-screen device and a transparent conducting tape; however, until now, few researchers have reported about the electrochemical catalytic ability of the electrodes and applied them in DSSCs. Here, to satisfy all the aforementioned requirements of Pt CEs simultaneously, Pt networks derived from electrospinning poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) nanofibers and sputtering Pt were developed as CEs for TNAR based DSSCs. The Pt network electrodes not only serve as a conducting film, but also exhibit excellent transmittance (sheet resistance of 100–150 Ω sq−1 at about 80%–85% transmission) and similar catalytic activity in the reduction of I3− in DSSCs to that of the thermally evaporated Pt. Furthermore, the network electrodes could be constructed on arbitrary flexible substrates at room temperature. After bending tests, the Pt network CEs and DSSCs based on them demonstrated remarkable mechanical stability. The highest efficiency of ∼3.82% was obtained by utilizing Pt networks as CEs in TNAR based DSSCs.
2 Experimental
2.1 Preparation of the photoanode
A thin-film titanium (Ti) foil (ca. 30 μm) was pre-cleaned by acetone, alcohol and deionized water, and then the highly ordered TNARs were fabricated on Ti foil by electrochemical anodization.29 The obtained TNAR/Ti foil was annealed at 450 °C in oxygen for 2 h with heating and cooling rates of 5 °C min−1 to induce crystallinity. After annealing, the sample was subsequently treated in 20 mM TiCl4 solution for 30 min at 75 °C and then further annealed at 450 °C for 30 min. The commercially available ruthenium based dye RuL2(NCS)2:2TBA (N-719) was used as the sensitizer, with a concentration of 0.3 mM in ethanol. The TNAR/Ti foil samples were immersed in N-719 for 24 h to form a photoanode. The microstructure of the fabricated TiO2 nanotubes was characterized through a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Hitachi SU 8020).
2.2 Preparation and characterization of CE
The CE was fabricated through electrospinning of PVA nanofibers. After the electrospinning, Pt nanoparticles were sputtered on the PVA nanofibers by magnetron sputtering at room temperature, with the flow rate of argon at 100 sccm, with a sputtering power of 100 W for 3 minutes. After spritzing some deionized water onto the flexible substrates, the resulting Pt nanofibers were then transferred to the substrates and baked at 70 °C for 2 minutes to dry out. To completely remove the PVA nanofibers, the samples were dipped into deionized water for 10 minutes and then dried at 70 °C, this process can be repeated several times to obtain appropriate resistance.
A digital multimeter (Keithley 2100) with a four-point probe was used to measure the films' sheet resistances. The light transmittance of the hybridized electrodes was measured by UV-vis spectroscopy (Shimadzu UV-3600). To examine mechanical durability, the electrodes were bent by a motor, and released to the initial position. Electrochemical performance measurements of the fabricated Pt networks were performed using an Autolab electrochemical workstation (Autolab, PGSTAT30, Metrohm), in a conventional three-electrode system.
2.3 Device fabrication
For the fabrication of DSSCs, the aforementioned photoanode was then assembled with the Pt CE using a 25 μm thick hot-melt sealed film as the spacer (SX1170-25; Solaronix Co.), then these two electrodes were fixed with clips and heated to 120 °C for 3 min to stick them together. The electrolyte including 0.5 M LiI, 50 mM I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in 3-methoxypropionitrile was injected into the cells by the capillary effect. The active area of the prepared solar cell was 0.2 cm × 1 cm. A Solux solar simulator calibrated with a Daystar meter was used to simulate sunlight for an illumination intensity of 100 mW cm−2. The solar cell was irradiated using a solar simulator (SOLO22A, CROWTECH) with an AM 1.5 spectrum distribution calibrated against an NREL reference cell to simulate accurately a full-sun intensity (100 mW cm−2). The incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) spectra were measured by a monochromator (Oriel, Model: 74125).
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Fabrication process of the Pt networks
The 3D schematic diagram in Fig. 1a presents the fabrication and transfer process of the Pt networks. Firstly, continuous PVA nanofibers were fabricated through electrospinning. Secondly, the random PVA networks were coated with a thin Pt film by utilizing the magnetron sputtering technique. This low temperature deposition technique can be used to sputter various metal films and retain the bulk-like electrical conductivity. Thirdly, the as-fabricated Pt@PVA networks were transferred onto different substrates and the hollow structured Pt networks were derived after removing the PVA nanofibers by dipping them into deionized water.

(e) Photographs of Pt networks with different transmittances and their corresponding SEM images (scale bar: 20 μm). (f) Photographs of Pt networks on different substrates, including PET, paper, silicone pad, and FEP (left to right). 
The microstructure of the fabricated Pt networks with different sheet resistances is characterized by SEM. Fig. 1b shows a typical example of the Pt network electrodes, the diameters of the Pt networks vary from 200 nm to 600 nm, which can be controlled by adjusting the electrospinning parameters. Fig. 1c presents the interlaced Pt networks, which show a good fused junction. The enlarged SEM image in Fig. 1d shows the hollow structure of the networks, indicating the dissolution of the PVA nanofibers. Fig. 1e presents the as-prepared CEs with different transmittance on the PET substrates and their corresponding SEM images. It is obvious that the density of the Pt networks increased with a decrease of the transmittance. Fig. 1f exhibits some examples that Pt networks are successfully transferred onto various substrates, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), paper, silicone pad and fluoroethylene polymer (FEP), respectively. The networks are firmly attached onto the substrates and can endure bending or twisting for hundreds of times without peeling off.
3.2 Mechanical properties of the Pt network electrodes
The mechanical flexibility of the Pt networks was further tested in terms of periodically bending. Fig. 2a shows the sheet resistances of Pt networks on PET as a function of the bending cycles at a bending radius of 1.134 cm (2.4 cm × 1.0 cm), the measurement setup including a motor and a fixed displacement platform is shown in the inset. Here, we chose Pt networks with a resistance of 80 Ω sq−1 as an example, which is comparable with ITO electrodes (70 Ω sq−1). No obvious degradation in electrical conductivity is observed for Pt networks, while the sheet resistance of the commercialized ITO/PET films increases about 6-fold after 1000 bending cycles. The poor stability of the ITO is mainly due to the fact that the brittle and fragile ceramic structure tends to crack during bending or twisting, while the nanotrough networks remain continuous and can undergo nanoscale deformation without fracturing.28 Furthermore, we also tested the mechanical properties of the Pt networks under extreme conditions by transferring them on the super-thin FEP film. Fig. 2b shows the I–V curves of the Pt networks on the FEP film during the factitious twisting and folding. Compared with the initial state (black line), the twisting state shows a slight current decrease. After crushing, twisting and unfolding for several times, the electrode maintains its conductivity (ESI Video1†). This huge advantage of the metal networks is of great importance in transparent conductive applications. This electrospinning technique can be employed to fabricate various highly durable metal networks and probably enable the development of wearable and lightweight optoelectronic devices.

3.3 Electrocatalytic properties of the Pt network electrodes

Fig. 3a shows the UV-vis spectra of as-prepared Pt networks on PET substrates, and the commercialized ITO and FTO glass as a comparison. All the Pt networks with different resistances demonstrate flat transmittance spectra for the entire wavelength range from 400 nm to 2000 nm, while a sharp decrease in the range of wavelengths greater than 1000 nm for both the FTO and ITO electrodes, indicating their low transmittance in the infrared spectrum. The inset in Fig. 3a presents the sheet resistances of Pt networks versus optical transmission at 550 nm. Obviously, with increasing the sheet resistance of the Pt network films, the transmittance increased as expected, and up to 94% optical transmittance was achieved when the sheet resistance was about 275 Ω sq−1. To systematically elucidate the relationship among sheet resistance, transmittance and electrochemical catalytic activity, we chose three typical samples from all the Pt network electrodes according to their sheet resistances: ∼40 Ω sq−1, ∼140 Ω sq −1 and ∼250 Ω sq −1, and Pt-A, Pt-B and Pt-C represent the three typical samples, respectively.
 Fig. 3  (a) UV-vis spectra of FTO glass, ITO, platinized FTO and Pt networks. Inset: resistance versus optical transmission (fixed at 550 nm) for the different CEs. (b) Cyclic voltammetry (C–V) curves of platinized FTO and Pt networks with different resistances. (c) C–V stability test curves of platinized FTO and Pt networks after 50 scanning cycles. (d) Nyquist plots of platinized FTO and Pt networks with different resistances. 
To better recognize the electrochemical catalytic activity of the Pt networks for the reduction of triiodide, electrochemical measurements were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 3b–d. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of various CEs in triiodide electrolyte were investigated from −0.6 V to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 50 mV s−1, as plotted in Fig. 3b. Here, as a comparison, semi-transparent platinized FTO glass obtained by means of thermal decomposition (400 °C) was introduced. All Pt network CEs show two pairs of oxidation and reduction peaks similar to that of the thermally evaporated Pt particles. The relative negative pair on the left is attributed to the redox reaction of I3− + 2e− = 3I−, while the right pair resulted from the reaction 3I2 + 2e− = 2I3−.30–32 As expected, the reduction peak currents increased with increasing the density or decreasing the sheet resistance of the Pt networks. The catalytic ability was similar to that of platinized FTO glass when the sheet resistance of Pt networks was ∼40 Ω sq−1. Furthermore, the electrochemical stability of the Pt network CEs was as well tested by measuring successive CV plots with 50 cycles. As can be observed from Fig. 3c the CV stability of the Pt networks is similar to that of the platinized FTO, and there is only an 8.9% increase in the cathodic peak current density and a 5.55% decrease in the anodic peak current density from the first to 50th CV curves of the Pt network sample, which indicates a superior stability of the prepared Pt networks.
The catalytic performance of the as-prepared Pt networks was evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements using a symmetric cell configuration. The results and the corresponding circuit model are shown in Fig. 3d, the fit parameters are listed in Table 1 by using the standard model. All the Nyquist plots exhibit a semicircle and a diagonal line with a slope of 45° corresponding to the charge transfer resistance (Rct) at high frequencies and the Warburg impedance from the electrolyte diffusion at low frequencies, respectively. The series resistance and the charge transfer resistance of the samples (Pt-A to Pt-C) monotonically increase with increasing the sheet resistances of the Pt networks, which totally agrees with the tendency of the corresponding reduction current density as shown in Fig. 3b.

3.4 Characterization of the DSSCs

Fig. 4a represents a digital photo and the corresponding three-dimensional schematic structure of a flexible DSSC, in which the highly ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays (TNARs) were employed as photoanode materials, as shown in Fig. 4b and c. The highly transparent and flexible Pt networks with various sheet resistances were applied as the CEs. Fig. 4d shows typical plots of the current density versus voltage for the DSSCs with Pt-A, Pt-B, Pt-C and platinized FTO, under AM 1.5 solar simulator illumination at 100 mW cm−2. The performance of the TNAR based DSSCs with Pt network CEs is ruled by a compromise among the conductivity, transmittance and the electrocatalytic activity. The DSSC using the Pt-A CE shows the lowest open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.57 V and short-circuit current (Jsc) of 9.6 mA cm−1 while the DSSC using the Pt-B CE shows a Voc of 0.68 V and Jsc of 10.99 mA cm−1, and the photoelectric-conversion efficiency (PCE) increases from 2.63% to 3.82%. A higher efficiency was achieved in Pt-B mainly due to the significant increase of the light transmittance (20%, ca. from 65% to 85%). However, the PCE demonstrates a little decrease as the sheet resistance further increases to ∼250 Ω sq−1 (Pt-C). Although Pt-C exhibits the highest transmittance, the decrease of the Pt loading would cause a lower FF and consequently a lower efficiency. Therefore, it is important to take a balanced point between the resistance and transmittance, which has been elaborated in Fig. 3.

(g) Driving LED measurements of the foldable DSSCs. Photographs of the prepared DSSC and the LEDs with and without the exposure of the DSSC to sunlight. (h) Photograph of the wearable DSSCs affixed to the human fingers. 
These results can be further confirmed by the corresponding incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) measurements shown in Fig. 4e. It is obvious that the IPCE values of the Pt-B and Pt-C based DSSCs are much larger than that of the Pt-A based DSSC, which is in agreement with the tendency of the corresponding values of Jsc and PCE. Although the IPCE value of the Pt-B based DSSC in the wavelength range of 500–550 nm is slightly smaller than that of the Pt-C based DSSC, the Pt-B based DSSC exhibits better performance in the rest of wavelength band, which is second only to the platinized FTO glass based DSSC. Furthermore, in order to investigate the mechanical flexibility of the DSSCs based on Pt network electrodes, periodic bending tests were performed. Fig. 4f presents the values of PCE and FF as a function of the bending cycles. The inset 3D diagram shows the measurement state of the devices. Only 9.6% decrease in PCE was observed (from 3.65% to 3.3%) after 200 bending cycles. The excellent tolerance towards repeated mechanical deformation can promote their applications in the field of lightweight and wearable solar cells.
Moreover, the prepared foldable DSSC can be employed to drive the blue LEDs, which can be seen in Fig. 4g. Here, the solar cell was prepared on the PET substrates, so that it could be folded easily. A row of LEDs were plugged into the breadboard in parallel. As the DSSC is exposed to sunlight, the parallel LEDs were lit up immediately (ESI Video2†). This process can be repeated several times without any brightness diminishment of the LEDs. Fig. 4h exhibits four wearable DSSCs adhered onto the human fingers. To obtain the highly flexible and wearable solar cells, the Pt networks were transferred onto the transparent FEP substrates, which also possessed a super-thin property. On this basis, the solar cells could be prepared with various shapes and sizes, which would be of great importance in the practical wearable applications.
4 Conclusion
In this study, we have elaborated a simple and cost-effective approach to fabricate flexible and transparent Pt network electrodes, which exhibit both excellent optoelectronic properties and remarkable mechanical stability. The CV and EIS analyses of the Pt networks reveal a comparable electrocatalytic behavior with the platinized FTO electrodes. The DSSCs based on Pt networks show a robust property against mechanical bending, and maintain >90% PCE after 200 bending cycles. Besides, the Pt networks can be transferred onto arbitrary substrates at room temperature, which makes it possible to fabricate wearable, lightweight and conductive textiles or films. Such metal network based electrodes would have great potential applications in lightweight photovoltaic fields and other smart and portable electronic product areas.
