    , Accepted 5th June 2019First published on 6th June 2019AbstractSemitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) exhibit great potential in building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) due to their low cost large area manufacturing process manufacturing process and tunable vivid colors for power-generating glass. However, the contradiction of achieving high power conversion efficiency (PCE) whilst keeping rational average visible transmittance (AVT) leads to the development of ST-OSCs lagging behind that of traditional opaque OSCs. In this work, chemically precipitated SnO2 colloidal particles are used as an electron collection interlayer in ST-OSCs for the first time. Due to the excellent transparency and high reflective index, the SnO2 layer can effectively tune the light-distribution of the incident light within the whole multilayered ST-OSCs. Guided by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and optical transfer matrix formalism (TMF) simulation, we successfully solved the contradiction between PCE and AVT, and achieved multicolored ST-OSCs with record high efficiency. The deep blue device shows the highest PCE of 12.88%, AVT of 25.60% (from 370 nm to 740 nm) and color rendering index (CRI) of 97.6, which are the best values for the state-of-the-art ST-OSCs. Our findings indicate that interfacial engineering and optical coupling are effective approaches to achieve high performance ST-OSCs with vivid colors, remarkable transparency and high efficiency.
1. Introduction
Semitransparent organic solar cells (ST-OSCs) are becoming more competitive in comparison to their inorganic counterparts due to their tunable vivid color for visual comfort, low cost large area manufacturing process, significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency (PCE) and more than 10 years predicted lifetime.1–3 ST-OSCs have wide application fields such as building-integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) to replace facades and roofs in conventional buildings and power-coatings on vehicles to produce electric power from sunlight.4–6
A traditional OSC sandwiches a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) electron donor and acceptor blend film between a transparent front electrode and an opaque reflective back electrode, where the interfacial layer is inserted between the BHJ layer and the electrodes to reduce the contact resistance and improve the charge selectivity of the devices. Currently, the milestone PCE of over 15%7 for single junction OSCs has been achieved due to the development and synthesis of novel donors and acceptors, morphology control and interfacial engineering. In opaque devices, the incoming light enters from the transparent electrode (ITO) and is reflected back by the metal mirror electrode (Al or Ag), thereby doubling the optical path within the photoactive layer. In the case of ST-OSCs, the mirror electrode is replaced by another transparent electrode to enable the incoming light to be transmitted through the device for a semitransparent appearance. Obviously, the light absorption of the photoactive layer is reduced in such cases because only a small portion of light is reflected by the back electrode, and this leads to an inevitable loss in photocurrent and PCE. It is preferred that most photons from near-infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths should be absorbed, while those in the visible range of the solar spectrum should be transmitted for an ideal photoactive layer in ST-OSCs. Therefore, the overall performance of ST-OSCs not only relies on the electric PCE, but also associates with optical characters including the average visible transmittance (AVT), transparency color perception (TCP), corresponding color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI).8–10 AVT, depending on the transmitted light through the ST-OSCs in the visible range (380–780 nm), is closely related to the refractive index and thickness of materials.11,12 Apparently, there is an inherent trade-off between the AVT and PCE for high performance ST-OSCs because a higher AVT means a lower light harvesting, and an AVT of 25% is the benchmark for window applications.13 To simultaneously achieve both high PCE and high AVT for ST-OSCs, great efforts have been made towards novel low-bandgap (LBG) material synthesis,14–16 transparent electrode development17–19 and device structure engineering, including tandem-structures20,21 and photonic crystal light management.22,23 CRI is another vital parameter for architectural glass of ST-OSCs due to the customized requirements for vivid colors and color neutrality.13,24,25 These additional requirements besides PCE and AVT impose complexity on optically designing ST-OSC device architectures. Generally, the color of ST-OSCs is controlled by the absorption spectra of photoactive layer materials.26 At present, blue ST-OSCs are the most commonly used device and it is still a challenge to achieve devices with various colors since the absorption spectra of photovoltaic materials within the visible range is very wide. Therefore, the comprehensive investigation on material engineering to obtain ST-OSCs with vivid colors should be very important.
Herein, multicolored ST-OSCs with a highest PCE and rational AVT are demonstrated via the synergistic effects of material, interfacial and optical engineering. An ultrahigh transparent SnO2 cathode buffer layer coupled with a semi-transparent Ag electrode is employed to tune the light distribution within the photoactive layer guided by finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) and optical transfer matrix formalism (TMF) simulation. Photoactive materials with different bandgaps are selected to obtain translucent devices with vivid colors. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of each functional layer, all AVTs for green, sky-blue, deep-blue, violet and fuchsia devices exceed the benchmark of architectural glass. Among these devices, the deep blue ST-OSC based on PBDB-T-2F:Y6 shows a PCE of 12.88% with an AVT of 25.60% and a CRI of 97.6 under air mass 1.5 global (AM1.5G) illumination. To the best of our knowledge, these parameters are the highest values reported for ST-OSCs, fulfilling the performance criteria for commercial application as power-generating windows in the near future.
2. Results and discussion
Generally, the color of ST-OSCs is determined by the absorption properties of the blend donor/acceptor films.27 Four polymer donors named J71, PBDB-T, PBDB-T-2F and PTB7-Th and four small molecule acceptors named ITIC-M, ITIC-4F, IEICO-4F and Y6 were selected to fabricate multicolored ST-OSCs. To make a comparison with the recent results, a careful survey on the performance of state-of-the-art ST-OSCs was carried out in Fig. 1a, which clearly manifest that the results achieved in our work are the best values for the state-of-the-art ST-OSCs.28–33Fig. 1b displays the inverted device architecture of ST-OSCs, in which SnO2 was employed as an electron collection layer, MoO3 as a hole collection layer, and an ultrathin Ag film as a transparent top electrode. The transmittance of the interfacial layer connected to ITO plays a crucial role in ST-OSCs.34 SnO2 is a commonly used electron transport layer with high transparency and high conductivity in perovskite solar cells but rarely applied in organic solar cells.35 In this work, we synthesized a SnO2 colloidal precursor via the simple direct precipitation method, and then spin-coated the SnO2 films on the substrate with post-annealing at 150 °C for 30 min in ambient air. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) in Fig. S1 in the ESI† clearly demonstrates the SnO2 blended with potassium ions. Fig. 1c and d present the schematic energy level diagrams and the molecular structures of the materials involved in the OSCs, respectively. Clearly, the SnO2 film with a CB of −4.12 eV and a VB of −7.54 eV determined by a UPS test (Fig. S2†) not only ensures smooth electron transportation and extraction, but also selectively blocks holes and prevents the potential interfacial recombination.36 Among the acceptor materials, IEICO-4F has a narrow bandgap and mainly absorbs near-infrared light. Therefore, IEICO-4F can be combined with different polymer donors to obtain efficient ST-OSCs with vivid colors, and other donor/acceptor blends with the absorption in the visible range help to get more colors.

Fig. 2a exhibits the theoretical transmittance of ST-OSCs with different thicknesses of Ag films, and the transmittance of the reference opaque cell with a 100 nm Al film is also comparatively shown. The AVT ranges from 2.28% to 30.90% via fine tuning the thickness of Ag films from 100 to 10 nm, demonstrating the flexibility of transmittance management via simply metal film thickness control. The AVT exceeds 25% when the thickness of the Ag film is 15 nm and the values decrease significantly when further increasing the thickness of the Ag film to 100 nm, which suggests that 15 nm is the suitable thickness for the semitransparent Ag electrode and the theoretical AVT for ST-OSCs based on J71:ITIC-M is 27.30%. Notably, the transmittance remains high for all devices in a broad wavelength coverage of 300–450 nm indicating that the color of ST-OSCs based on J71:ITIC-M is blue, and the transmittance remains low in the spectral region from 450 to 650 nm manifesting that J71:ITIC-M has a strong light absorption ability in this spectral coverage. Moreover, the AVT is only 2.01% for the opaque cell with the 100 nm Al film, which is slightly lower than that of the cell with the 100 nm Ag film due to the lower transmittance of the opaque device from the wavelength of 600 to 760 nm, predicting a potentially higher exciton generation rate in this spectral coverage.

Fig. 2b demonstrates the simulated achievable Jscversus the photoactive layer thickness for the ST-OSCs with a 15 nm Ag electrode. The Jsc increases dramatically with increasing the photoactive layer thickness at the beginning of 80 nm followed by a marginally oscillatory augmentation owing to the optical interference among the multilayers of the device, and the maximum Jsc goes up to 17.76 mA cm−2 when the ST-OSCs with a 180 nm photoactive layer was illuminated under AM1.5G solar radiation, if the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) was set to 100% throughout the whole wavelength range, which is mildly higher than the experimental value. However, severe charge recombination occurs under thick photoactive layer situations caused by the relatively poor charge transportation, resulting in a reduced device performance.37 Hence, a 100 nm photoactive layer that also shows high simulated Jsc is adopted in this work. To visually present the difference of exciton generation in the ST-OSCs and opaque devices, Fig. 2c and d illustrate their own exciton generation rates for cells with 100 nm Al and 15 nm Ag electrodes, respectively. Apparently, the SnO2 layer can effectively capture most parts of the incident light within the whole multilayered ST-OSCs benefiting from its excellent transparency and high reflective index. Meanwhile, it can rationally tune the exciton generation rates of the ST-OSCs in the position from 80 to 100 nm, which are higher than that of the opaque cell, indicating the higher AVT of ST-OSCs. So far, the trade-off between PCE and AVT is resolved successfully.

Fig. 3a shows the absorption and transmittance spectra of the SnO2 film. The red dashed line is the tangent to the cutoff edge of the absorption peak in the spectrum, and the intersection of the tangent and the x-axis is the absorption edge λ. Apparently, the absorption is under 5% and the transmittance is over 95% for the SnO2 layer in the wavelength range from 300 to 900 nm, leading to more incident light penetration into the photoactive layer. Fig. 3b shows the absorption spectra of different blend films of donors and acceptors, and they are PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F, PBDB-T:IEICO-4F, PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F, PBDB-T-2F:6, J71:ITIC-M and J71:IEICO-4F. Fig. 3c presents the corresponding transmittance spectra of devices based on the above mentioned photoactive layers. It's easy to distinguish their device color according the absorption and transmittance spectra, and they are sky blue (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F), deep blue (PBDB-T:IEICO-4F), deep blue (PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F), deep blue (PBDB-T-2F:Y6), violet (J71:ITIC-M) and fuchsia (J71:IEICO-4F) for ST-OSCs with the 15 nm Ag electrode. Furthermore, PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F-based devices with a 15 nm Au transparent electrode were also fabricated to get a green cell. As expected, the AVTs of all the devices were controlled to be over 25% from 370 nm to 740 nm under the guidance of optical engineering, satisfying the benchmark for power generating windows and exhibiting vivid colors.38 The exact value of AVT for these devices is summarized in Table 1.

The transparency color perceptions (TCP) of the ST-OSCs are depicted using the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram, which is specifically designed to represent the colors perceptible to the human eyes.10,39 The transmitted light is represented by the product of the AM1.5G solar spectrum and the transmission spectrum of each semitransparent device. The representation of the color coordinates of the ST-OSCs is displayed in the CIE 1931 chromaticity diagram in Fig. 3d. The color coordinates of the ST-OSCs with the 15 nm Ag electrode are located in the low colorfulness area in the CIE chromaticity diagram, indicating good achromatic. The color coordinates are (0.3024, 0.3531), (0.2628, 0.2941), (0.2555, 0.2666), (0.2436, 0.2518), (0.2745, 0.2490) and (0.3100, 0.2603) for green (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F), sky blue (PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F), deep blue (PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F), deep blue (PBDB-T-2F:Y6), violet (J71:ITIC-M) and fuchsia (J71:IEICO-4F) ST-OSCs, respectively. This manifests neutral color sensations when looking through the devices under AM1.5G illumination.
The CRI, which indicates the light transmission capacity of the ST-OSCs and ranges from 0 to 100, is calculated by the test sample method (TSM) to represent the color rendering properties8 and the detailed analysis can be found in the ESI.† Tables S1 and S2† present the chromaticity of the test source after von Kries chromatic adaption, which was measured from the transmitted light of PBDB-T-2F:Y6- and PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F-based ST-OSCs under AM1.5G illumination. For the deep blue PBDB-T-2F:Y6-based devices, the CRI reaches up to 97.6 due to the uniform transmittance over the entire visible spectrum, and such a high CRI reflects an excellent color rendering capacity. The CRI of the deep blue PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F-based devices is also high up to 97.5. The deep blue PBDB-T:IEICO-4F-based cells give a CRI of 94.4. The CRIs of green PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F-based devices with an Au electrode and sky blue PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F-based devices with an Ag electrode are 85.6 and 89.1, respectively. The CRI of violet and fuchsia ST-OSCs based on J71:ITIC-M and J71:IEICO-4F are 79.2 and 61.0, respectively.
The characteristic J–V and EQE curves of ST-OSCs are plotted in Fig. 4a and b, and the photovoltaic parameters of the corresponding devices are also summarized in Table 1 (averaged over 12 individual devices). As can be seen, the PBDB-T-2F:Y6-based semitransparent devices present the highest performance, and the PCE reaches up to 12.88%, with a high AVT of 25.60%, a Jsc of 21.56 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.825 V and a fill factor (FF) of 72.41%. To the best of our knowledge, these parameters are the highest values reported for ST-OSCs, fulfilling the performance criteria for commercial application as power-generating windows in near future. The PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F-based ST-OSCs demonstrate a relatively high PCE of 11.20% with an AVT of 26.22%, a Jsc of 19.74 mA cm−2, a Voc of 0.789 V and an FF of 71.92%. The PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F-based semitransparent OSCs with the 15 nm Ag electrode have a sky-blue color and demonstrate an impressive PCE of 8.78% with an AVT of 25.08%, while the ST-OSCs with the 15 nm Au electrode have a green color and yield a PCE of 7.26% with a high AVT of 26.34%. The PBDB-T:IEICO-4F-based deep blue ST-OSCs offer a PCE of 6.64% with an AVT of 26.50%. Besides, the violet and fuchsia ST-OSCs based on J71:ITIC-M and J71:IEICO-4F show PCEs of 7.23% and 4.45%, respectively. Moreover, both the higher Jsc and FF in all ST-OSCs suggest that the SnO2 cathode buffer layer with high up to 95% transparency allows most of the incident light penetrating into the photoactive layer, and its excellent electron extraction and hole blocking functions have been fully implemented due to its suitable energy level (CB = 4.12 eV and VB = 7.54 eV).

The EQE spectra of ST-OSCs are exhibited in Fig. 4b, which are in good agreement with the absorption spectra of the corresponding photoactive layers as shown in Fig. 3. The maximum EQE values of PBDB-T-2F:Y6-based ST-OSCs exceed 65% in the wavelength region from 530 to 830 nm. The integrated current density is 21.39 mA cm−2, which is the best result for the ST-OSCs with such low energy losses. The integrated current densities of PBDB-T:IEICO-4F-, PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F-, J71:ITIC-M- and J71:IEICO-4F-based ST-OSCs are 17.08, 19.49, 12.44 and 11.66 mA cm−2, respectively. For PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F-based devices, it should be highlighted that the integrated current densities of the corresponding ST-OSCs based on Au and Ag electrodes are 17.19 and 19.59 mA cm−2, respectively. These integrated Jsc values are in good accordance with those derived from J–V curves. Fig. 4c shows the optical photographs of the semitransparent devices, in which the beautiful flowers can be clearly seen through ST-OSCs with vivid colors. These parameters confirm that the transmittances of the ST-OSCs are high enough to meet the commercial critical requirements.
3. Conclusions
In summary, the synergistic effects of interfacial and optical engineering are employed to achieve high performance ST-OSCs with vivid colors toward meeting the critical requirements for their application in BIPV. Significant improvements of PCE, AVT and CRI in this work can be attributed to three aspects: (1) the multifunctional SnO2 layer, which not only ensures more sunlight penetration into the photoactive layer due to its high up to 95% transparency, but also guarantees efficient electron extraction and selectively block hole transportation owing to its suitable CB and deep VB; (2) FDTD accurately portrays the optical transmittance of ST-OSCs by optimizing the thickness of the transparent Ag electrode; (3) optical transfer matrix formalism simulation visually presents the exciton generation distribution profile and therefore directly guides the design of the optimal inverted device architecture. These combined merits enable the PBDB-T-2F:Y6-based inverted ST-OSCs to provide a PCE of 12.88%, an AVT of 25.60% (from 370 nm to 740 nm) and a CRI of 97.6, which satisfy the commercialized critical requirements for window applications. Moreover, ST-OSCs with five different colors including green, sky-blue, deep-blue, violet and fuchsia are realized and exhibit good performance. This work demonstrates a good example of ST-OSCs for future BIPV application.
4. Experimental section
Materials
Patterned ITO glass with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω per square was purchased from CSG HOLDING Co., LTD. (Shenzhen, China). Electron donors of PBDB-T,40 PBDB-T-2F,41 PTB7-Th,42 and J71 (ref. 43) and electron acceptors of ITIC-M, ITIC-4F and IEICO-4F were purchased from Solarmer Materials Inc (Beijing, China). Y6 was synthesized according to previous reports. For polymers PBDB-T and PBDB-T-2F, the average number molecular weight (Mn) values are 11.5 K and 26.8 K with a polydispersity index (PDI) of 1.5 and 1.62, respectively. The Mn of polymer PTB7-Th is 124 K with a PDI of 1.7, while that of J71 is 23.5 K with a PDI of 2.0, measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC).
The SnO2 colloidal precursor was prepared by the direct precipitation method. Firstly, SnCl4·5H2O was dissolved in deionized water with a concentration of 1 mol L−1, and then 5 mol L−1 KOH solution was added dropwise into the SnCl4·5H2O/water precursor to stabilize the colloids. Finally, the SnO2 colloidal precursor with a PH value of around 12 was obtained. XPS with a survey scan range from 0 to 1350 eV was performed to characterize the chemical composition and electronic states of SnO2.
Device fabrication
Inverted ST-OSCs based on different combinations of acceptors and donors were fabricated, in which the transparent electrode is an Ag film with a thickness of 15 nm. In the device fabrication, all patterned ITO-coated glass substrates were sequentially cleaned with detergent, de-ionized water, acetone, and isopropanol in an ultrasonic cleaner for 15 min. Then the substrates were treated with ultraviolet light for 15 min with the purpose of increasing its wettability. Subsequently, a 10 nm SnO2 electron transport layer was spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 30 s on the pre-processed ITO substrates with post-heat treatment at 150 °C for 30 min in air. It should be highlighted that the SnO2 colloidal precursor was diluted 15 times with de-ionized water and stirred for at least 30 minutes before spin-coating. The photoactive layers of ST-OSCs were prepared by different methods. When J71 was used as the electron donor material, the materials were dissolved in chloroform with a polymer concentration of 10 mg mL−1 at a weight ratio of 1:1 (J71:ITIC-M) and 1:1.5 (J71:IEICO-4F) followed by spin-coating onto ITO/SnO2 substrates at optimized 3500 rpm for 60 s, and then the samples were baked at 150 °C for 10 min to obtain the film with a thickness of around 100 nm. PTB7-Th:IEICO-4F (1:1.5 weight ratio and polymer concentration of 10 mg mL−1) chlorobenzene:1-CN (96:4 volume ratio) solution was spin-coated onto the ITO/SnO2 substrate at optimized 2500 rpm for 60 s. PBDB-T:IEICO-4F (1:1.5 weight ratio and polymer concentration of 10 mg mL−1) chlorobenzene:DIO (99.5:0.5 volume ratio) solution was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for 60 s, and then the samples were baked at 100 °C for 10 min. The solution of PBDB-T-2F:ITIC-4F with a weight ratio of 1:1 was processed with the same procedure as that of PBDB-T:IEICO-4F. PBDB-T-2F:Y6 (1:1.2 weight ratio and polymer concentration of 8 mg mL−1) chloroform:1-CN (99.5:0.5 volume ratio) solution was spin-coated onto ITO/SnO2 substrates at optimized 3000 rpm for 60 s, and then the samples were baked at 110 °C for 10 min. Finally, MoO3 (10 nm)/Al (100 nm) or MoO3 (10 nm)/Ag (15 nm) was thermally evaporated in a vacuum at a pressure of 4 × 10−5 Pa on the blend active layer.44 The active area of the devices is 4 mm2.
Instrumentation and device characterization
A Kratos Axis Ultra DLD ultraviolet photoelectron spectrometer equipped with a monochromatic He ultraviolet source He I (hν = 21.22 eV) was employed to perform ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) of SnO2 in an ultra-high vacuum (3.0 × 10−8 Torr). XPS data were measured by using an ESCA Lab220i-XL electron spectrometer from VG Scientific using 300 W Al Kα radiation operated at a base pressure of 3 × 10−9 mbar. The absorption and transmittance spectra for SnO2 and active layers were recorded with a Hitachi U-3010 UV-Vis spectrophotometer. A Dektak XT surface profilometer (Bruker) was used to evaluate the film thicknesses involved in the devices. The current density–voltage (J–V) performance curves were recorded on a computer controlled Keithley 2400 source measure unit under one-sun AM1.5G (1000 W m−2, 25 °C) standard test conditions, and the solar simulator is from SAN-EI LTD, AAA grade. Notably, the photovoltaic parameters obtained in this paper were averaged over 12 individual devices. The performance characterization of external quantum efficiency (EQE) was conducted on a QE-R system (Enli Tech., Taiwan) under an ambient atmosphere at room temperature. The light intensity at each wavelength was calibrated with a standard single-crystalline Si photovoltaic cell purchased from the national renewable energy laboratory (The United States of America).
Theoretical simulation
Previous researches have proven that the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) based on the solutions of Maxwell's equations provides direct guidance for evaluating the performance of photoelectric devices.45–47 The theoretical transmittance of ST-OSCs with the architecture of ITO/SnO2/J71:ITIC-M/MoO3/Ag and the reference device with the structure of ITO/SnO2/J71:ITIC-M/MoO3/Al was simulated by FDTD, in which the incident plane wave within 300–900 nm bands perpendicularly irradiates the devices and the incident field intensity E0 is set to be 1 V m−1. The refractive indexes of the materials involved in this work were obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry, as shown in Fig. S3 in the ESI.† To further verify the transmittance of FDTD and give a visual difference between ST-OSCs and opaque OSCs, the exciton generation rate within different devices was calculated by using an optical transfer matrix, and the solar spectrum is the standard AM1.5G. The influence of photoactive layer thickness on the short-circuit current density (Jsc) of ST-OSCs with a 15 nm Ag electrode was also simulated with the same method.
