    , Accepted 11th March 2020First published on 11th March 2020AbstractOver the past decade, fluorinated materials have become the dominant donors for achieving high power conversion efficiencies in organic solar cells (OSCs). Research on F substituents on N-heterocycle-based polymer solar cells was firstly carried out by introduction of the F atom into the pyrazine-based acceptor unit, which was successfully applied in constructing a polymer (BDT-FPY) for PSCs. MeIC-based polymer solar cells (PSCs) with BDT-FPY as a donor achieve a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 12.30%, significantly higher than that of a device based on BDT-PY:MeIC (the PCE of unfluorinated polymer donor BDT-PY is 10.2%). The higher PCE of BDT-FPY:MeIC is attributed to more balanced μh/μe, better molecular packing, and more appropriate phase separation features. This result shows great potential for creating high-performance N-heterocycle-based PSCs.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) comprising donor–acceptor (D–A) conjugated polymers (CPs) and non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have attracted enormous attention due to their low-cost fabrication, light weight, flexibility and large-area processing feasibility.1–15 For the past several years, non-fullerene PSCs have achieved great advancements and plenty of NFAs have been developed.16–28 Until now, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of NFA-based PSCs have reached over 16%.29–37 The number of NFAs is growing so fast that the existing polymer donor materials are not enough to meet the subsequent requirements. Hence, exploring novel efficient polymer donor materials is necessary.38 Since the absorption spectra of most fused-ring NFAs ranged from 600 nm to 800 nm, the exploitation of wide bandgap D–A conjugated polymer donors has gained considerable attention because their complementary absorption with the above NFAs could enable the utilization of photons to generate more excitons.39,40
Being widely used in high-performance organic bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, D–A type polymer donors containing N-heterocycle acceptor units have been applied to achieve greater planarity, better crystallinity and low-lying frontier energy levels. However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have reported this class of copolymers. N-heterocycle containing devices have achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as over 12%–16%. As acceptor units, bithiazole, 1,3,4-thiadiazole, tetrazine, pyrazine, benzo[1,2,5]thiadiazole and benzo[1,2,3]triazole have been adopted to construct (D–A)-based conjugated polymers, where the substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (BDT) was used as a donor unit.41–48 Up to now, electron deficient pyrazine core based D–A type copolymers have not been well explored. Moon and co-workers firstly investigated the pyrazine core based WBG polymer donors.49 They demonstrated that incorporating the pyrazine unit into the backbone of WBG polymer donors could enhance their planarity and improve the optoelectronic properties of polymer donors. By regulating the alkyl side chains of the pyrazine-based acceptor unit, optimized PSCs achieved a PCE of 8.1% after blending with an NF acceptor (ITIC). It would seem, therefore, that further investigations are needed to enhance the PCEs of the pyrazine-containing PSCs. To the best of our knowledge, the introduction of fluorine atoms directly into the conjugated backbone of conjugated polymers has shown great promise in enhancing the PCEs of BHJ solar cells.50–59 Thus, chemical modifications by the introduction of the F atom into the acceptor unit to construct new D–A polymers for PSCs could be a useful method to optimize the PCEs of the pyrazine-based PSCs.
In this work, we designed and synthesized two new polymer donors (Scheme 1), a nonfluorinated copolymer (BDT-PY) and a fluorinated copolymer (BDT-FPY), based on BDTT as the donor unit and different substituted pyrazine-based acceptor units. A nonfullerene acceptor MeIC (Scheme 1)60,61 was chosen to pair with the above two D–A type polymer donors, considering its complementary absorption with the donors and its high photovoltaic performance in NFA-based PSCs. The optimized BDT-FPY:MeIC-based PSCs exhibited the maximum PCE of 12.3% with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.96 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 17.23 mA cm−2 and a fill factor (FF) of 73.8%, a near 21% improvement in PCE relative to that of the BDT-PY:MeIC-based device. These results indicate that the incorporation of the fluorinated pyrazine-based acceptor unit is an effective way of achieving highly efficient copolymers for N-heterocycle-based PSCs.

Results and discussion
The synthetic routes of BDT-PY and BDT-FPY are outlined in Scheme S1.† The pyrazine-based monomers M1 and M2 were prepared using the Stille coupling reaction and a sequence bromination reaction. Finally, target polymers BDT-PY and BDT-FPY were synthesized via the typical Stille-coupling polymerization in toluene, with Pd2(dba)3 as a catalyst and P(o-tol)3 as a ligand. The polymers exhibited good solubility in common organic solvents such as chloroform, toluene, and chlorobenzene (CB). Using gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) with a polystyrene standard, the number-average molar mass (Mn) was determined to be 37.5 kg mol−1 with a dispersity (Đ) of 2.1 for BDT-PY and 59.4 kg mol−1 with a Đ of 2.3 for BDT-FPY, respectively. The thermal decomposition temperature (Td, with 5% weight loss) of BDT-PY and BDT-FPY was found to be 420 and 438 °C, respectively, evaluated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which indicates that these materials are sufficiently thermally stable to be used in PSCs (Fig. S1†).
Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were carried out to investigate the optimal geometries and frontier molecular orbits of polymers (Fig. 1). To simplify the calculations, we replaced the alkyl chains with methyl chains and carried out the calculations based on the two repeating monomeric units. As shown in Fig. 1c, introducing the F atom on the pyrazine unit, BDT-FPY stacking exhibits similar dihedral angles (21.2°, 21.5°, and 22.6°) along the polymer backbone to those of BDT-PY (22.6°, 22.7° and 23.1°). This indicates that introducing the F atom on pyrazine has less effect on the intramolecular planarity. The minimized distortion in the polymer backbone is expected to have a substantial influence on molecular morphologies. The fluorination on pyrazine of the conjugated polymer backbone can directly lower both the HOMO and LUMO levels, which was proposed in a previous theoretical study.51 These results match well with the experimental results of cyclic voltammetry (CV). In comparison with BDT-PY, the deeper HOMO level of BDT-FPY is expected to increase the VOC in the resulting PSC devices. BDT-FPY demonstrates a smaller optical band gap of 1.52 eV relative to that of BDT-PY, which is favourable for the JSC enhancement. Finally, the electrostatic potential (ESP) surface images of the pyrazine-based units (Fig. 1a) show that fluorination has less effect on the majority of their electron density distributions but increases local negativity and dipole moment. This result is consistent with the nature of the strong electron-withdrawing character of F atoms and provides clear evidence for the different electron transfer properties of BDT-PY and BDT-FPY.

The insertion of F atoms into the pyrazine-based copolymer backbone has a marginal influence on the backbone planarity, molecular packing, and electron distribution. As shown in Fig. 2a, the chloroform solution (10−5 M) of BDT-FPY exhibits strong absorption in the 400–630 nm region with a very high maximum extinction coefficient of 3.38 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 554 nm, which is higher than that of BDT-PY (2.82 × 105 M−1 cm−1 at 518 nm). In going from solution to film (Fig. 2b), the maximum absorption of BDT-FPY and BDT-PY was redshifted from 554 to 591 nm, and from 518 to 572 nm, respectively, which indicates that both of the copolymers can form tight molecular packing in film. Besides, BDT-FPY exhibited a higher absorption coefficient of 0.89 × 105 cm−1 at 591 nm compared with that of the BDT-PY film (0.72 × 105 cm−1 at 572 nm in Fig. 2b), which is attributed to the electron-withdrawing effect of F substitution and higher molecular stacking and crystallinity of BDT-FPY. Consequently, the grazing incident X-ray diffraction (GIXD) experiments were performed to investigate the molecular stacking and crystallinity of the BDT-PY and BDT-FPY neat films (Fig. S2, ESI†). Both donors display ordered molecular packing with a face-on orientation. In comparison with BDT-PY, BDT-FPY displays larger π–π stacking peaks with q = 1.72 Å−1 in the out-of-plane (OOP) direction, and an increased crystal coherence length (CCL) (53.3 Å for BDT-PY; 56.7 Å for BDT-FPY), implying the stronger crystallite quality and more compact molecular packing of BDT-FPY. As a result, the hole mobility of the BDT-FPY film measured by using the space charge-limited current (SCLC) method was calculated to be 9.9 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 (Table 1), which is improved compared with that of BDT-PY. The optical bandgaps (Eoptg) of BDT-PY and BDT-FPY were calculated to be 1.95 and 2.00 eV, respectively, which well match with the bandgap of the MeIC acceptor (Table 1), enabling desirable complementary absorption.

To evaluate the photovoltaic properties of BDT-PY and BDT-FPY, the OSCs were prepared with a conventional architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS (poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene-sulfonate))/donors:MeIC/Zracac (zirconium acetylacetonate)/Al. The optimum active layers were obtained by spin coating the BDT-PY:MeIC (or BDT-FPY:MeIC) (1:1, w/w) blend solution at a polymer concentration of 16 mg mL−1 on CF with 0.25% (vol) 1,8-diiodooctane as a solvent additive, followed by a thermal annealing step at 100 °C for 3 min. Finally, the best PCE of 10.2% with a VOC of 0.95 and a JSC of 15.54 mA cm−2 along with an FF of 68.8% was obtained for the BDT-PY-based device and the highest PCE of 12.3% with a VOC of 0.96 and a JSC of 17.29 mA cm−2 along with an FF of 73.8% was achieved for the BDT-FPY-based device. The corresponding current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics are shown in Fig. 3a, and the key photovoltaic parameters are presented in Table 2. To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of 12.3% is one of the top values for N-heterocycle containing nonfullerene organic solar cells. Relative to the BDT-PY-based control devices, the BDT-FPY-based devices exhibited a slightly increased VOC and a significantly enhanced JSC and FF; the higher VOC is mainly ascribed to the deeper HUMO energy level of BDT-FPY, while the larger JSC is partially due to stronger and redshifted absorption of BDT-PY. The above results in a higher value of JSC × VOC for the BDT-FPY-based device than that for the BDT-PY based device, which is responsible for the larger PCE of the BDT-FPY-based device.

As can be seen in Fig. 3b, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the best BDT-FPY-based device showed an obviously stronger and broad photoresponse in the wavelength range of 300–600 nm relative to that of the BDT-PY-based device, and a maximum EQE value of 76.4% for the BDT-FPY-based device at 670 nm was recorded. To investigate the carrier recombination mechanism of BDT-PY and BDT-FPY-based devices, J–V curves under different light intensities (Plight) were obtained. Fig. S3† depicts the relationship between Jph and the light intensity (Plight), which follows a power-law formula of Jph ∝ (Plight)S, where S approaching 1 implies that the bimolecular recombination is negligible. The S values of the BDT-PY and BDT-FPY-based devices are 0.90 and 0.93, respectively, indicating that less bimolecular recombination occurs in the BDT-FPY-based device, and the S values are consistent with the tested results of the FF. The JSC values calculated from the EQE curves are 15.54 and 17.29 mA cm−2 for the devices based on BDT-PY and BDT-FPY, respectively, which are consistent with those calculated from the J–V curves (within 5% mismatch). To understand the exciton dissociation and charge collection properties, we measured the dependence of the photocurrent (Jph) on the effective voltage (Veff) (Fig. 3d). For both of the PSCs based on BDT-PY:MeIC and BDT-FPY:MeIC, Jph reaches saturation (Jsat) at a high Veff (that is, Veff ≥ 2 V). Jsat of the BDT-FPY based device is 18.4 mA cm−2, significantly higher than that of the BDT-PY-based device (17.1 mA cm−2), partially due to better exciton generation and light harvesting. Under maximal power output and short-circuit conditions, the ratios of Jph/Jsat were 75.6% and 91.0% for the BDT-PY-device and 81.4% and 94.0% for the BDT-FPY-device, respectively. The higher Jph/Jsat implies that more excellent charge collections and exciton dissociations occur in the BDT-FPY-based device. In order to gain more insights into the charge transport properties of the blend films, we measured the hole (μh) and electron mobilities using the SCLC technique (Fig. S4†). Compared with the BDT-PY based device, the BDT-FPY based device exhibits slightly higher hole and electron mobilities (μh = 3.42 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 2.16 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BDT-FPY-based device; μh = 3.23 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and μe = 1.55 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 for the BDT-PY-based device) with a more balanced μh/μe value (Table 2), which is beneficial to the electron transport.
In addition to charge transport, recombination, and exciton dissociation, film morphology also plays an important role in determining the device performance. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) were employed to investigate the blend film morphology (Fig. 4). The AFM images reveal that BDT-FPY has a homogeneous and smooth morphology with a relatively smaller root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 2.09 nm than that of BDT-PY (RMS = 2.65 nm). Consequently, the BDT-FPY-based film displays clearer and more obvious nanofibrillar structures than the BDT-PY blend film does in the AFM phase images, which is consistent with the trend of mobility. Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) experiments were performed to confirm the domain size (Fig. S5†). To account for the scattering contribution from the intermixing amorphous phase, the fractal-like network and Debye–Anderson–Brumberger models were employed to fit the data, respectively. The pure phase domain sizes (2Rg) are calculated to be 50.5 and 33.6 nm for the BDT-PY:MeIC and BDT-FPY:MeIC based films, respectively. A low pure phase domain size in the optimal BDT-FPY based blend film is beneficial to exciton dissociation and transport. The corresponding intermixing domain sizes are estimated to be 79.7 and 80.7 nm for the BDT-PY:MeIC and BDT-FPY:MeIC-based films, respectively. The intermixing phase for the optimal ternary blend film is well consistent with the results observed in the AFM phase images.15

Additionally, GIWAXS experiments were performed to investigate the molecular packing and crystallization of the blend films (Fig. 3b and c). Both BDT-PY:MeIC and BDT-FPY:MeIC based blend films show a preferential face-on stacking pattern, especially the BDT-FPY:MeIC-based blend, evidenced by the sharper and more prominent π–π stacking peak in the OOP direction. However, by fitting the π–π (010) stacking peaks of the BDT-PY:MeIC and BDT-FPY:MeIC blend films at q ≈ 1.76 Å−1 using two Gaussians, a d-spacing distance of 3.56 Å and a CCL of 21.8 Å for the BDT-PY-based film and a d-spacing distance of 3.56 Å and a CCL of 23.0 Å for the BDT-FPY-based film were obtained, respectively. The relatively more face-on orientation and a stronger crystallization tendency of the BDT-PY:MeIC and BDT-FPY:MeIC films are also responsible for the enhanced charge extraction and transport. Thus, incorporating the F atom into the pyrazine-based PSCs greatly improved their miscibility with MeIC, which favored an optimal morphology with the interface area. The BDT-FPY-based device shows more balanced hole/electron mobilities, which might be originated from the higher crystallinity and optimized phase separation. As a result, BDT-FPY based PSC devices show a higher FF, JSC, and efficiency than those of the devices based on BDT-PY.
Conclusion
In conclusion, by exploiting the fluorination effects on pyrazine-based PSCs, we developed two new WBG polymers, BDT-PY and BDT-FPY, with the well-known BDT donor. BDT-FPY was synthesized by incorporating a new F atom substituted pyrazine-based acceptor unit. Compared to the nonfluorinated counterpart (BDT-PY), the incorporation of the F atom not only results in red-shifted absorption and a deeper HUMO energy level but also improves the molecular packing and morphological properties. The BDT-FPY-based device delivered a PCE of 12.3%, ≈21% enhancement from that of the BDT-PY-based control device (10.2%). These results show great potential of the fluorination of N-heterocycle-based polymers in realizing further enhancement of PCEs.
