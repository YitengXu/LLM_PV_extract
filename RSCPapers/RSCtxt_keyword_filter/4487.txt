    , Accepted 21st August 2014First published on 21st August 2014AbstractA bilayer TiO2 photonic crystal (PC)/porous BiVO4 was constructed by using liquid-phase deposition (LPD) and spin coating method for the enhancement of visible-light-driven photocatalytic ability by the improvement of light absorbance. Crystal form, morphology, film thickness, and light absorption performance were investigated. The photocatalytic activity of the bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 film was evaluated by the degradation of MB and was compared with that of porous BiVO4 film. The effect of the film thickness of the porous BiVO4 on its photocatalytic ability was determined. It was found that the film thickness significantly affected the light absorption, and therefore its photocatalytic ability. The bilayer film with 1.03 μm of thickness of porous BiVO4 film exhibited the highest photocatalytic performance. The photocatalytic ability of porous BiVO4 was enhanced by combination with a TiO2 PC layer as the back reflector. This increase could be attributed to the intensified light absorbance produced by reflection from the TiO2 PC layer. The effects of porous structure and the application of photoelectrocatalytic process on the photocatalytic performance were also discussed.
1. Introduction
Photocatalytic pollutant degradation using semiconductor materials has attracted considerable attention due to its potential for pollution control utilizing solar light.1–7 The development of an efficient visible-light-driven semiconductor material is indispensable for practical applications. Monoclinic scheelite crystal BiVO4, with a narrow band gap of 2.4 eV, has been certified to have photocatalytic ability for pollutant elimination.8,9 Some efforts have been pursued to enhance its photocatalytic performance, such as noble metal modification10,11 and heterojunction composite fabrication.12,13 Despite all the advances in the modifications of BiVO4, it still suffers from limited light absorption, which partly accounts for its poor photoactivity.
A photonic crystal (PC) is a periodic optical material or structure that is designed to confine, control and manipulate photons so as to intensify the light absorption, and enhance the related performance of the material.14–17 The periodic modulation of PC leads to a photonic band gap, and light in its wavelength range cannot propagate in the PC due to the Bragg diffraction and scattering on lattice planes, generally known as the band gap scattering effect,18,19 but can be reflected by the PC. Thus, the PC acts as a dielectric mirror to reflect the light in the wavelength range of photonic band gap. Because of this property, PC can be used to enhance the light absorption of photoresponsive material by multiple scattering. For example, Yu et al.20 reported that the power conversion efficiency of polymer solar cells was enhanced when using a PC as a reflector. Liao et al.21 found that using inverse TiO2 opal PC as a mirror could promote the light absorption so as to enhance the photocatalytic capability of the photocatalyst. Film thickness of the photoresponsive material (photocatalyst) is particularly important. Light intensity usually attenuates as it penetrates into the solid photocatalyst film.22,23 If the film thickness is larger than the light penetration depth, the light will not illuminate the PC, and PC will not promote the absorption of the photocatalyst.
Another solution to enhance the absorption is to fabricate the photocatalyst with a porous structure.24–26 The light absorption is intensified by the channels serving as light-transfer paths for the distribution of photon energy onto the large inner surface of photocatalyst particles. Otherwise, photoelectrocatalysis is a promising technique for the improvement of photocatalytic process efficiency.27,28 The photogenerated electron can be drawn from work electrode to the counter electrode by the bias potential and the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron–hole pairs can be improved.
Herein, we constructed an inverse TiO2 opal PC coupled porous BiVO4 film (bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 film) on FTO substrate for efficient visible-light-driven photocatalysis. The inverse TiO2 opal PC, a common kind of PC, was used as back reflector to enhance the absorbance, and ultimately improve the photocatalytic ability of BiVO4 film. The effect of BiVO4 thickness on the photocatalytic ability was first discussed. MB was chosen as a probe to test photocatalytic activities of the prepared samples.
2. Experimental section
Materials
Monodisperse polystyrene latex sphere suspension (193 nm, 2 wt% in water) was purchased as the template from Shenzhen Nano-Micro Technology Co., Ltd. Vanadium(V) tri-i-propoxy oxide was purchased as the vanadium source from Strem Chemicals, USA. Bismuth (III) nitrate pentahydrate was purchased as the bismuth source from Tianjin Kermel Chemical Reagents Development Centre, China. FTO glass with a thickness of 2.2 mm and a sheet resistance of 15 Ω from Geao Co., China, was used as the substrate. All the reagents were used without further purification.
Preparation of TiO2 PC
TiO2 PC was prepared by the method reported by Lu et al.29 In detail, FTO substrates were cleaned in ultrasonic bath with dilute HCl and ethanol, and then rinsed with deionized water and dried in air. The colloidal crystal polystyrene film was prepared via solvent evaporation method. The suspension of polystyrene spheres was diluted in deionized water to a concentration of 0.1 wt%, and then was sonicated in a glass vial for 30 min to break aggregation. FTO substrates were immersed vertically in the suspension in the glass vial. The polystyrene spheres were aligned on the FTO (known as polystyrene opals) by keeping the glass vial in an oven at 55 °C overnight to fully evaporate the water in the suspension. To fabricate the inverse TiO2 opal, the reported liquid-phase deposition (LPD) method was used to replicate the polystyrene opal. Polystyrene opal film was immersed vertically in a solution of 0.15 wt% titanium isopropoxide and 0.015% HNO3 in ethanol for 5 min to form a TiO2 seed layer. After being dried in air, it was dipped in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M ammonium hexafluorotitanate and 0.3 M boric acid at 60 °C. The pH of the solution was adjusted to about 3 by adding 1 M hydrochloric acid. After 25 min, samples were washed thoroughly with deionized water and dried in air. The polystyrene spheres were removed by calcining the film at 500 °C for 2 h with a heating rate of 2 °C min−1, the inverse TiO2 opal PC was then obtained.
Preparation of bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 film
The BiVO4 precursor was prepared by mixing solutions A (obtained by dissolving bismuth nitrate in acetic acid) and B (obtained by dissolving vanadium(V) tri-i-propoxy oxide in acetylacetone) with a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio of Bi to V. The sol was vigorously stirred for 0.5 h, and the prepared polystyrene spheres were added in the sol as the template to form the pores. The bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 films were obtained by depositing the above sol on the FTO glass by a spin coater and annealed in air at 500 °C for 2 h. The coating and annealing processes were repeated, and resulted in different coating layers. Films were designated by Sn, where n was the number of the layer of the film. The schematic procedure for preparing bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 film was presented in Scheme 1. BiVO4 films were prepared by the same process as porous BiVO4 films without a PS template, but directly on the FTO, and with four layers. The precursor for BiVO4 film was the same as for porous BiVO4 film, without template.

Characterization
The crystal structure of films was characterized by Rigaku D/MAX2400 with Cu Kα radiation, current of 30 mA, accelerating voltage of 40 kV and a scanning rate of 0.02° per s in the 2θ range of 10°–80°. The scanning electron microscopy images of the films were investigated by a Hitachi S-4800 with an accelerating voltage of 30.0 kV. UV-visible transmittance spectra of the samples were recorded on a UV-vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2450) with a wavelength range of 200–800 nm.
Photoelectrocatalytic degradation of MB
The photoelectrocatalytic degradation of MB was performed in a cubic quartz reactor. The initial concentration and volume of MB were 5 mg L−1 and 75 mL, respectively, and 0.01 M sodium sulfate was used as the electrolyte. The prepared film electrode, a platinum foil and a SCE served as photo-anode, cathode and the reference electrode, respectively. The bias potential (0.8 V vs. SCE) was applied using a CHI electrochemical analyzer (CHI 660D, Shanghai Chenhua, China). A 300 W Xe lamp (PLS-SXE 300, Beijing Bofeilai Science and Technology Co., China) served as visible light source. The light was passed through a glass filter, which only permitted the light with wavelength above 400 nm to illuminate on the photo-anode electrode. Photocatalytic and electrochemical experiments were performed in the same conditions, but without bias potential and illumination, respectively. The adsorption experiment was performed without the bias potential and illumination. Direct photolysis experiment was performed under the same light illumination as the photoelectrocatalytic process. The concentration of MB was determined by UV-vis spectrophotometer (UV-721, Xinmao) at 664 nm.
3. Results and discussion
Crystal form
The XRD patterns are shown in Fig. 1. The crystal form of BiVO4 can be identified to be monoclinic scheelite type according to the observed characteristic peaks with 2θ at 18.8°, 28.8°, 30.5°, 39.7° and 53.1° (JCPDS no. 14-0688), which has the most excellent photocatalytic ability among its three crystal forms (tetragonal zircon type, tetragonal scheelite type and monoclinic scheelite type). Moreover, other peaks (26.5°, 38.2° and 52.0°) in the patterns of bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 film, porous BiVO4 film and BiVO4 film are found, which are the peaks of FTO. The peaks of TiO2 are not clear even in the pattern of TiO2 PC film, which may be hidden by the spectral peak of FTO (25.3° of 2θ of the main peak of anatase TiO2) or/and be attributed to the lesser amount of TiO2.

Morphology and film thickness

Fig. 2 shows SEM images of TiO2 PC and S4. It can be observed that a perfect periodic structure in the TiO2 PC (Fig. 2(a)) has been obtained. The average diameter of the hollow spheres is around 193 nm, which is similar to the size of the template, inferring that it is the replica of the polystyrene sphere. The perfect TiO2 PC will modulate the light efficiently, and will be an excellent back reflector for the upper layer of the photocatalyst. Porous structure of BiVO4 layer is confirmed by the SEM image of top view of S4. Fig. 2(c) shows the cross section image of S4, which is constructed with FTO, TiO2 PC layer, and the porous BiVO4 layer. The thicknesses of the TiO2 PC layer and porous BiVO4 layer are about 0.8 and 1.0 μm, respectively. The thickness of bilayer films is further investigated, and the result is illustrated in Fig. 2(d). The film thickness increases from 0.72 (S1) to 1.90 μm (S5), indicating that repeating the coating process can indeed increase the thickness of the film. Furthermore, the thickness of S4 is 1.63 μm, which is similar to the result obtained by SEM.

Light absorption ability
It is well known that the optical absorption ability is the key factor in determining the photocatalytic ability. The more photons are absorbed, the more electron and hole pairs will be generated, and the more efficient photocatalytic ability will be obtained. UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra are shown in Fig. 3. From Fig. 3(a), the transmittance of the bilayer films decreases with the layer of the film increasing from one to four; however, the transmittance of S5 rises. This law is obvious in the wavelength range from 400 to 520 nm (inset of Fig. 3(a)), where light can excite the BiVO4. The film thickness of S5 may be larger than the light penetration depth, and the TiO2 PC is out of function, which makes absorbance of S5 decrease. In Fig. 3(b), the transmittance of FTO is significant in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm because it is transparent. TiO2 PC has an obvious band gap, and its center, blue edge and red edge of the band gap are at 450, 400 and 550 nm, respectively. Compared with BiVO4 film, the porous BiVO4 film has a lower transmittance, which can be attributed to the action of the pores for the distribution of light photons. Furthermore, the transmittance of S4 is smaller than that of porous BiVO4 film, especially between the center and the red edge of the band gap. The intensified absorbance can be attributed to the scattering effect generated by the TiO2 PC. As the back reflector, TiO2 PC can reflect the light in the band gap. Thus, the light can “illuminate” BiVO4 film again, and therefore, the absorbance is enhanced. The results of UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra analysis reasonably predict that S4 has excellent photocatalytic performance.

Photocatalytic performance
MB is chosen as the model substance to test the photocatalytic ability of the prepared samples, and the result is illustrated in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4(a), the removal rate of MB in the photoelectrocatalytic process increases between S1 and S4, this enhancement can be attributed to their increased absorption ability. However, the photoelectrocatalytic ability of S5 decreases. The reason for this decrease is its reduced absorption ability. Furthermore, the photoelectrocatalytic degradation rate is also affected by the transport of reactants to and from the bulk solution. Reactants have a longer diffusion path to reach the interior of BiVO4, due to the thicker film of S5,30 which explains the decreased removal rate of S5. In 180 min, MB removal efficiency for S4 is 8.12% in electrochemical process (see Fig. 4(b)), but it is 6.88% in the adsorption process. The comparison result shows that the electrochemical process can be neglected. The MB removal rate is 19.6% in the direct photolysis, indicating that MB can be slightly decomposed under the illumination of visible light. Porous BiVO4 has excellent photocatalytic ability considering its 80.1% elimination rate for MB in photocatalytic process, although adsorption process and/or direct photolysis contributes a small part to the whole elimination rate. Based on a 91.6% removal rate in the photoelectrocatalytic process, the photocatalytic ability of S4 is enhanced by the potential bias, which can efficiently separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs by transporting the photogenerated electron to the counter electrode, and therefore increase the photocatalytic ability. The photocatalytic performances of BiVO4 film, porous BiVO4 film and bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 film (S4) in photoelectrocatalytic process are compared (Fig. 3(c)). In 180 min, only 57.8% of MB is removed with BiVO4 film; however, MB removal rate with porous BiVO4 film is 63.5%, indicating that the produced mesoporous structure can enhance the photocatalytic performance of BiVO4. The photocatalytic ability is further elevated by adding the TiO2 PC film as the back layer (91.6%). It is found that the MB elimination in all four processes followed the pseudo-first-order kinetics by the linear transforms ln(C0/Ct) = −kt (k is kinetic constant). The k of MB removal in photoelectrocatalytic process with S4 (0.0138 min−1) is 2.38 times that with porous BiVO4 film (0.00579 min−1), and is 2.83 times (0.00487 min−1) with BiVO4 film. This enhancement can be attributed to the mesoporous structure and the reflection of PC, which elevates the absorption ability of BiVO4. Bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 with high absorbance can be excited by more photons, and more electrons and holes can be photo-generated. Then, an increased number of electrons and holes participates to the oxidation of MB; therefore, an enhanced MB elimination rate is observed.

4. Conclusions
Bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 films have been successfully constructed. The thickness of porous BiVO4 film significantly affects the absorption ability. The absorbance of BiVO4 film is enhanced by the reflection of light of TiO2 PC, combined with the porous structure action on photons distribution. The photocatalytic ability of BiVO4 film is enhanced by the construction of porous structure and bilayer film with TiO2 PC. This enhancement can be attributed to the increase of absorption ability. Bilayer TiO2 PC/porous BiVO4 with high absorbance can be excited by more photons, more electrons and holes can subsequently be photo-generated, and finally an increased number of electrons and holes participate in the oxidation of model substance. Based on the results presented here, it is confirmed that the configuration of the visible-light-driven photocatalyst presented in this work can be significant in the field of photocatalytic process to meet the future requirements of environmental pollution control.
