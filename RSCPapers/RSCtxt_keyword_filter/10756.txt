    , Accepted 30th September 2020First published on 30th September 2020AbstractCZTSSe solar cells are considered to be potential and cost-effective alternative solutions to mature photovoltaic technology for meeting future energy demands. However, the current performance of CZTSSe solar cells is limited due to their high voltage deficit. The comparison of figure-of-merits of the two technologies show that CZTSSe has 62% lower open circuit voltage compared to that of 35% for CIGS, with respect to their associated band gaps. Efficient charge separation and extraction at the absorber–buffer (p–n) junction is paramount for mitigating the voltage loss and achieve high photo-conversion efficiency. The rapid progress for achieving high deliverables in CZTSSe is impeded by interface recombination, which is a consequence of poor-quality p–n junction. The inherent association of CZTSSe with secondary phases and defects due to narrow phase stability plays an unfavorable role in producing a good quality interface. The high density of interface defects, unfavorable band alignment, and structural inhomogeneities across the interface are some of the leading causes that nurture interface dominant recombination pathways. These interface-related concerns have drawn the scientific community towards interface engineering and modification of the interface to bring closer performance parity between CZTSSe and matured CIGS solar cell technology. Several approaches have attempted to develop favorable interface features that facilitate improved device performance. This work addresses the critical aspects of interface engineering of the absorber–buffer heterojunction in CZTSSe solar cells and the importance of tools that are essential to identify and eradicate the root causes of low efficiency.
1. Introduction
Among the range of photovoltaic materials, thin film technologies still have the potential to further reduce the cost of solar energy harvesting. Amidst various thin film technologies, c-Si, CIGS, and CdTe are well-established and well-commercialized thin film technologies. The reported record efficiency for single crystal silicon is 26.7%.1,2 However, some disadvantages are associated with Si solar modules such as the manufacturing cost and their low absorption coefficient, which has triggered the research for the development of other thin film technologies. CIGS and CdTe thin film solar cells have achieved a record efficiency of 23.35% and 22.1%, respectively, and occupy a decent share in the commercial market.2,3 The major drawbacks associated with these materials such as the scarcity of indium and tellurium and the toxicity of cadmium restrict these technologies from becoming successful at an economical level. The non-toxic and earth-abundant quaternary copper–zinc–tin–sulphur–selenide (CZTSSe) compound has been projected for economically viable photovoltaic applications.
Kesterite CZTSSe has the potential to replace all the existing well-commercialized thin film technologies. The development of CZTS photovoltaic technology is in progress due to its outstanding properties such as a tunable band gap (1.1–1.5 eV) and high absorption coefficient (>104 cm−1).4–10 However, the current record efficiency exhibited by the CZTSSe solar cells is 12.6%,11 which reflects high performance disparity compared to CIGS solar cells. The performance gap between CZTSSe and CIGS technologies is mainly ascribed to the low open circuit voltage (VOC) or high voltage deficit in the CZTSSe solar cells. Ideally, the VOC of the solar cell must be equal to the band gap of the active material, which means high voltage deficit reflects much lower VOC than the band gap. Extensive research has revealed the following features that influence the VOC in CZTSSe based solar cells.
(i) Due to narrow phase stability, the pure phase formation of CZTSSe is more complicated. The complexity of this material leads to the co-existence of other competitive secondary phases such as ZnS, Cu2S, Cu2SnS3, and SnS2 along with the pure CZTSSe phase during the growth process, which are detrimental to the device performance.6,8,12–14
(ii) Defects such as antisite defects (e.g., CuZn, CuSn, and SnZn), vacancies (e.g., VZn, VSn, and VCu), and defect complexes (e.g., VCu + ZnCu, VZn + SnZn, and ZnSn + 2ZnCu), along with the defect states associated with the secondary phases, lead to band tailing in the material, causing non-radiative recombination.6,15–20
(iii) The undesirable energy level alignment at the charge separating interfaces, especially at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunctions, contributes to trap-assisted recombination; moreover, inappropriate interface chemistry leads to a high density of interface defects.7,12,20–22
(iv) The formation of thick MoSe2 at the rear interface hinders the flow of a majority of charge carriers (holes) from the CZTSSe film towards the back interface.23–26
All these factors affect the VOC unfavorably in the CZTSSe solar cells, though the charge carrier's recombination at or near the charge separating interface plays a critical role in the high VOC deficit. Comparing the performance of commercialized CIGS and CZTSSe based solar cells in terms of the open circuit voltage deficit with respect to their band gap and activation energy of recombination provides a clear picture. Fig. 1(a) compares the device performance of the three quaternary solar cell technologies: CIGS, CZTSSe, and CZTS. The (Eg − Ea) vs. (Eg/q − VOC) plot, where Eg is the band gap, Ea is the activation energy of the dominant recombination mechanism, and q is the electronic charge, is depicted in Fig. 1(a). It provides a deep insight into the dominant recombination path of the charge carriers adversely affecting the VOC of the respective devices. If the activation energy is close to or equal to the band gap of the absorber layer, i.e., the (Eg − Ea) value is low, the dominant recombination mechanism is the Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination in the depletion region or the neutral region of the absorber layer. If the activation energy is much lower than the band gap of the absorber, i.e., (Eg − Ea) is large, then the main recombination route is present at the absorber/buffer interface or at the back interface.27–31 The experimental data for CIGS demonstrates that the main recombination pathways are mainly present in the absorber layer, as demonstrated in Fig. 1(b). However, the CZTSSe family mainly suffers from interface-dominated recombination that primarily takes place at the CZTS/CdS interface due to the “cliff”-like conformation or defects at the interface, which are schematically depicted in Fig. 1(c).7,12,16,32 Polman et al. correlated the dependence of device efficiency with light and charge carrier management of the CZTSSe devices, which clearly indicates the poor carrier management in contrast to CIGS devices.33

The theoretical Shockley–Queisser efficiency limit (SQL) for different solar cell technologies, namely, CZTS (32.4%), CZTSSe (31.0%), and CIGS (32.0%), is mentioned to realize the performance gap between the theoretical and the reported efficiencies for different materials.

The interface recombination in CZTSSe solar cells is found to be influenced by several factors such as the matching degree of energy levels at the charge-separating or transporting interfaces, bulk- and interface-charged defect states, mobility and diffusion length of the charge carriers of CZTSSe, and other contact materials.21,27,34,35 Therefore, interface engineering plays a pivotal role in suppressing interface recombination in order to enhance the VOC and fill factor (FF) of the CZTSSe device. It becomes obligatory to grasp the information about junction characteristics, different interface recombination mechanisms, and charge carrier collection at the interfaces.
In a conventional CZTSSe solar cell structure, as shown in Fig. 2, it appears that there are three interfaces: (i) Mo (hole transport layer)/CZTSSe (absorber layer) interface, entitled as the back interface, (ii) CZTSSe (absorber layer)/CdS (electron transport layer) interface, entitled as the front interface, and (iii) CdS (electron transport layer)/i-ZnO/AZO (window layers) interface. The front and back contact interfaces are significantly responsible for charge carrier separation, collection, and recombination. A majority of carriers (holes) from CZTSSe directly get collected by the adjacent back contact of Mo, while the minority carriers (electrons) have to travel far to get collected by the metal electrodes at the top of the window layer. Thus, more attention should be paid for improving minority carrier collection. In the case of CIGS solar cells, the Mo back contact is found to be beneficial as it offers excellent adhesion properties, good ohmic contact, and formation of MoSe2, which resists the inter-diffusion of elements.36–39 In contrast to the CIGS solar cells, MoSe2 formation at the CZTSSe/Mo interface has detrimental effects on the device performance. Scragg et al. observed that the thickness of MoSe2 at the CZTSSe/Mo contact increases with the increase in sulfurization time.23 Due to the instability of the CZTSSe/Mo contact, voids often appear at the interface, which adversely affects the device performance.7,24 Two approaches are commonly suggested to eliminate MoSe2 formation: (i) substitute Mo back contact with other materials, (ii) different intermediate layers can be used between CZTSSe and Mo to avoid the reaction of CZTSSe and Mo. A variety of back contact materials has been investigated for CZTSSe solar cells including Au, W, Ni, Pd, and Pt.40,41 To improve the back interface quality, various intermediate layers such as TiB2,42 TiN,43,44 carbon,45,46 ZnO,47,48 Bi,49 and Ag50 have been deployed. The aforementioned modifications employed at the CZTSSe/Mo back contact interface are found to be sufficient enough to provide a low contact resistance. The energy level alignment measured at the CdS/ZnO interface is found to be favorable for charge transport. The conduction band offset (CBO) and valence band offset (VBO) values measured from X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and ultra-violet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) at the CdS/ZnO interface are estimated to be 0.3 eV and 1.2 eV, respectively. It is suggested that electron transportation is not affected much through the CdS/ZnO interface, resulting in high device performance.7,51 The front interface, i.e., the interface between the CZTSSe and CdS (buffer layer) is the most critical element of the device, as shown in Fig. 2. CZTSSe/CdS forms the p–n junction and drives the photogenerated charge carriers apart, which allows their collection at their respective electrodes. The energy level alignment, charge accumulation, defects/trap density at the CZTSSe/CdS interface, and the charge carrier mobility of the transporting layer greatly impact the built-in potential and hence the charge collection efficiency.52–55 Thus, in order to accomplish high efficiency, a good quality CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction is highly urged to facilitate efficient charge collection and transportation from the absorber layer to the respective electrodes. Hence, interface engineering of the CZTSSe/CdS interface is in high demand and is being explored extensively to tackle voltage deficit issues in CZTSSe solar cells.

Two type of offsets are often observed at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction: type I (“spike”-like) and type II (“cliff”-like), as shown in Fig. 3. The “spike”-like energy level alignment with CdS at the junction is found to be more favorable for the suppression of interface recombination, as depicted in Fig. 3(a).12,56 However, the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction generally offers “cliff”-like conformation at the interface, where the conduction band minima (CBM) of CdS lies below the CBM of CZTSSe, as displayed in Fig. 3(b).32,52,57–60 This kind of energy level alignment lowers the interface band gap and consequently promotes the trap-assisted recombination of charge carriers at the interface.7,32,52,61–65 Moreover, the lattice misfit observed at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction is ∼7%, while the CIGS/CdS heterojunction offers only ∼1% lattice mismatch. The existence of defects at the CZTSSe/CdS interface due to lattice mismatch majorly contributes to the trapping of charge carriers and hence, severely influence the VOC of the device.12 Although, the record efficiency of the CZTSSe device, i.e., 12.6%, is reported with the CdS buffer layer, however, interface engineering in the CZTSSe solar cells can uplift the efficiency to the level of well-established and commercialized CIGS and CdTe solar cells. Therefore, the CZTSSe/CdS interface needs to be engineered judiciously so as to mitigate the aforementioned concerns. This review is focused on providing an insight into the importance of interface engineering and to a larger extent, presents the strategies employed to the engineer CZTSSe/CdS interface in the CZTSSe solar cell. The article is further divided into the following subsections for a better comprehension of the topic under consideration.

2. A detailed investigation of the CZTSSe/CdS interface
CdS is a widely used material for the formation of the p–n junction in CIGS solar cells and is a constituent of the highest efficiency CIGS solar cells. On the contrary, CdS has not shown such fruitful results when used as a buffer layer in CZTSSe-based solar cells. It is found that large interface recombination occurs at the CZTSSe/CdS interface, which is a major cause of this contrast between the two photovoltaic technologies. Scientists have deeply investigated the CZTSSe/CdS interface in order to understand the root cause of low VOC and poor device performance of the CZTSSe solar cells. The investigations on the CZTSSe/CdS interface on the whole includes the band alignment study, inspection of the local chemical environment at the interface, the quantification of defects, and quality check of the p–n junction exhibited at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction. The investigations on the CZTSSe/CdS interface have been discussed comprehensively in order to establish the foundation of interface engineering in CZTSSe technology.
2.1 CZTSSe/CdS interface chemistry

2.1.1 Formation of secondary phases at the CZTSSe/CdS interface. 
There is an inherent association of secondary phases such as Cu2S, SnS2, ZnS, and Cu2SnS3 with CZTSSe due to the complexity of this material. Secondary phases are generally present in the bulk as well as on the CZTSSe film surface. The presence of secondary phases near or at the CZTSSe/CdS interface generates electrically active trap states or defects states, which leads to the narrowing or tailing of the band gap, which adversely affects charge separation at the junction.13,32,66,67 The Cu2S phase is usually found on the top of CZTSSe, while ZnS and SnS2 segregate at the Mo/CZTSSe interface. Excess Cu in Cu-rich CZTSSe reacts with sulphur and forms the Cu2S phase on the CZTSSe surface during the sulfurization process, which is highly conductive in nature and shorts the devices. Kaur et al. controlled the highly metallic Cu2S phase formation by tuning the Zn/Sn compositional ratio.68 It is observed that an appropriate amount of Zn is required to regulate the Sn loss in the CZTS film during the sulfurization process, which eventually reduces the Cu2S phase. Fig. 4(a) schematically shows the reduction of the Cu2S phase on decreasing the Zn/Sn ratio from 2.6 to 1.10 while keeping the Cu/(Zn + Sn) ratio within the optimum range. Zn-rich and Sn-poor compositions (i.e., when Zn/Sn = 2.6 and Zn/Sn = 1.53) do not support the formation of the intermediate Cu2SnS3 (CTS) phase, which is critical for the growth of CZTS; thus, a large amount of the Cu2S phase remains uncompensated on the CZTS surface. On the other hand, Zn/Sn with a 1.10 ratio provides sufficient Sn to compensate Cu2S in order to form the CTS phase and finally leads to the formation of CZTS. The morphological images shown in Fig. 4(a) support the mechanism for the suppression of the secondary phase of Cu2S with the Zn/Sn ratio of 1.10. KCN etching is one of the preferential etching techniques to remove the secondary phases from the CZTSSe surface.32,69–71 The KCN etched CZTSSe films are found to have a larger band gap at the surface, which is attributed to the significant changes in the surface composition.32 The large band gap CZTSSe film provides an extended interface band gap at the CZTSSe/CdS interface and proved beneficial in suppressing charge carrier recombination.32 Yan and his co-workers achieved a high quality CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction by making the top CZTS Cu-poor compared to the bottom CZTS. The heavily P+ doped bottom layer acts as a rear pushing force to push the minority carriers towards the front (depletion region). The VOC is increased by about 70–80 mV in the Cu gradient CZTS device but at the cost of low JSC.72 Tajima et al. have also shown that a Cu-poor CZTS layer near the front interface results in improved VOC and decay in the JSC values.73 Researchers have also observed Zn-rich and Sn-rich secondary phases (e.g., ZnS and SnS2) near the CZTSSe/CdS interface.13,74,75

The ZnS phase offers a large barrier to the flow of electrons from CZTSSe to the CdS buffer layer due to the high conduction band offset (CBO) of 1 eV at the CZTSSe/ZnS interface.7 The solubility of the ZnS phase in HCl indicated that it can be used as an etchant to remove the Zn-rich secondary phases from the CZTSSe surface. The SEM images in Fig. 4(b) clearly show the reduction in the ZnS crystals from the CZTS surface with the increase in HCl concentration. The photovoltaic performance is also demonstrated in Fig. 4(b) for different HCl etching times in the range from 0 to 10 min. The maximum efficiency of 4.73% achieved for the etching time of 5 min is mainly associated with improved interface quality. However, when the etching time is more than 5 min, then the PCE began to decrease owing to the destructive effects on the CZTS film due to prolonged etching time. Thus, it is very critical to scrutinize the appropriate etching time during the wet chemical etching technique.74 The formation of the SnS2 secondary phases on the surface may occur due to condensation or stoichiometry deviation.84 The exact reason for the growth and formation of SnS2 is still not clear. Various methods have been reported to remove this harmful phase in order to minimize the severe effects on device performance. Lin et al. effectively removed the harmful SnS2 phase using the (HNO3 + 3HCl) etching solution.75 The positive impact of the etching solution on the PCE of CZTSe device is clearly shown in Fig. 4(c). The inset SEM image shows that the round or semicircular structure of the SnS2 phase is etched using the (HNO3 + 3HCl) solution, thereby enhancing the device PCE from 3.8% to 5.6%. The mechanical exfoliation method displayed in Fig. 4(d) is also used by Wang et al. to remove the SnS2 phase from the CZTS surface.13 The large SnS2 sheets shown in the SEM and cross-sectional SEM images in Fig. 4(d) are problematic during the device fabrication process. The SnS2 sheet bends the ZnO and AZO film during deposition, which leaves a hollow area behind, as shown in Fig. 4(d). On the other hand, the sample surface is found to be smoother after mechanical exfoliation. The device efficiency shoots up from 0.38% to 4.3%, which is ascribed to the drastically decreased interface recombination due to the SnS2 phase, as shown in Fig. 4(d). However, the mechanically exfoliated SnS2 crystals are about 30–40 micron in size; thus, the validation of this method for the removal of smaller crystals is still questionable. Despite various detrimental effects of the SnS2 phase, a recent study reported that the presence of the SnS2 phase can be correlated to the appearance of large size CZTS grains with some morphological flaws. Moreover, the existence of SnS2 can be expected to alleviate the CZTS decomposition process. However, the presence of secondary phases could be a limitation itself.85 Typically, one of the common routes to get rid of these harmful secondary phases (e.g., ZnS, Cu2S, and SnS2) is to subject the CZTS film to chemical etching treatment. Numerous etchants have been used to remove particular secondary phases, which are tabulated in Table 1 along with their impact on the device performance before and after the etching treatment. Several reports suggest that the toxic characteristics of etching treatment can damage the CZTS surface.13,68,74,79 The etching process can affect the chemical composition of the surface, which disturbs the compositional uniformity.13,68 The disturbance in chemical composition near or at the interface affects the interface quality. Moreover, the usage of etchants often leads to the formation of air voids.86 Consequently, it is necessary to develop a facile, novel, and green removal method for the detrimental secondary phases without compromising the film quality.

2.1.2 Defects and defect complexes at the CZTSSe/CdS interface. 
So far, the formation of secondary phases due to off-stoichiometric compositions and their elimination using different etchants has been discussed. However, off-stoichiometric compositions of CZTSSe not only form secondary phases but create numerous defects as well.6,87–90 It includes a substantial amount of localized lattice defects and point defects such as vacancies, antisites, and extended defects (dislocations, stacking faults, etc.).12,18,19,91–93 Certain defects such as copper vacancies (VCu) are beneficial as they enhance the p-type nature of the CZTS material.17,94 At the same time, the presence of certain defects such as CuZn and ZnSn at the grain boundaries limits charge carrier transport across the interface by affecting the lifetime and mobility of the photogenerated carriers.95–97 Among other common point defects such as copper vacancies (VCu) and zinc tin antisites (ZnSn), copper zinc antisites (CuZn) have the lowest formation energy owing to the very small chemical difference between the Cu and Zn atoms.8,18,95 Hence, CuZn is a dominant defect in the CZTS absorber layer. It forms an acceptor level deeper than the favorable VCu and acts as a trapping center. A high concentration of CuZn defects at the interface pins the Fermi level at the center of the band gap. Fermi level pinning causes poor band bending at the interface and results in high voltage deficit.95,96,98 To suppress the spontaneous formation of CuZn antisites, the substitution of Cu and Zn with atoms of different sizes is the latest approach. Several dopants (Ag, Fe, Ni, Co, Mn, Sb, etc.) have been used with CZTSSe to improve the photovoltaic performance.98–102 Ag incorporation into the CZTS film has been comprehensively studied by researchers. Various reports have been published with uniform Ag distribution while some have reported non-uniform/graded Ag distribution in the CZTSSe film.95,103–106 Saha et al. proposed an n/p/p+ kesterite solar cell to investigate its effect on charge carrier collection where CdS, Ag-doped CZTS, and pure CZTS were used for n-doped, p-doped, and p+-doped regimes, respectively.107Fig. 5(a) shows the energy level alignment and electric field distribution of the proposed n/p/p+ solar cell structure. The electric field distribution concludes the formation of the depletion region throughout the complete ACZTS region. The extended field distribution or extended depletion region efficiently assists in increasing the probability of minority carrier collection, thereby improving the front interface quality. The same scheme has been employed by substituting an Ag layer near the interface, which forms a double layer CZTS structure.106 The fabricated double layer structure of ACZTS and CZTS is shown in Fig. 5(b) together with the SEM image. It depicts the increase in the grain size after Ag incorporation. A significant improvement in the VOC of about 50 mV and an increase in the device efficiency from 4.9% to 7.2% is observed after Ag incorporation owing to the reduction in the CuZn antisite defects, as shown in Fig. 5(b). The reduction in the CuZn defects eventually leads to a high band bending at the absorber/buffer interface and a reduction in interface recombination. The compositional grading of Ag in CZTSSe with high Ag composition near the interface, as shown in Fig. 5(c), is one of the possible strategies implemented by Yuan et al. to boost device performance.96 The motivation behind this scheme is to maintain low Ag concentration or pure CZTSSe in the bulk to preserve the p-type nature of the absorber layer, while more and more Ag is added at the CZTSSe/CdS interface to quench the formation of the CuZn antisites and mitigate the possibility of Fermi level pinning.96,98

In another interesting study, the device performance of CZTSSe without elemental substitution, with uniform Ag substitution, and graded Ag substitution has been compared.98 It is concluded that the graded incorporation of Ag into the CZTSSe film is much more beneficial for suppressing CuZn antisite defects concentration at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction than the other two. The individual studies of the three different schemes of Ag substitution also suggest that graded substitution is more promising than the other strategies.98 Double cation substitution strategy is also used to mitigate the severe effects of antisite defect complexes on interface recombination. Hadke and his coworkers partially substituted Cu by Ag and Zn by Cd to explore their effect on the PCE of the device.116Fig. 5(d) shows a substantial improvement in the PL decay time with double cation substitution, which is directly related to the improvement in the minority carrier lifetime and hence the PCE of the device. Recent literature on Cd-alloyed CZTS reported an efficiency over 12%, which is the highest efficiency obtained by sulfide-based kesterite solar cells.117 Another report on Zn substitution by Cd in the CZTS device investigated that the band tailing issue reduced significantly after Cd-alloying. The electrical properties of the CZTS absorber and minority carrier lifetime were greatly improved, resulting in greater than 11% efficiency of the Cd-alloyed CZTS device.118 However, Ag is precious and a less-abundant element while Cd is toxic; therefore, these are not ideal substitutes for the earth-abundant CZTSSe absorbing material. Lie et al. fabricated the CMTS structure by replacing Zn with Mn, which improved the interface quality of the p–n junction, as shown in Fig. 5(e).54Fig. 5(e) shows the VOCvs. temperature characteristics, where the activation energy (EA) for the dominant recombination mechanism improved to some extent after Mn doping, which indicates the annihilation of interface-dominated recombination. Enhancement in VOC and FF can be realized from the J–V curve displayed in Fig. 5(e), which clearly reflects the positive impact of Mn doping. Another characteristic methodology for enhancing the PCE of the CZTSSe absorber layer is using the bandgap grading approach. The band gap of the CZTGeS absorber decreases monotonically towards the front interface from the back contact by controlling Sn/(Ge + Sn) ratio, as shown in Fig. 5(f). It enables the formation of suitable energy level alignment at the CZTGeS/CdS interface and improves the device performance. Successfully, the graded CZTGeS cell demonstrated 6.3% PCE while the ungraded cell showed 4.8% efficiency.113 Doping in CZTSSe has been the most employed strategy for mitigating defects and combating the voltage deficit issues in this technology. In recent literature, using first principal calculations, it also has been predicted that atomic substitution and extrinsic doping can uplift the Shockley–Queisser Limit (SQL) upto 31%, which is only 20% before the treatment.119Table 2 summarizes the dopants used in CZTSSe solar cells to date and their impact on the device efficiency. Alkali metals (Li, Na, or K) are also incorporated into the absorber material, which is reported to be beneficial for the improvement of the grain size and the passivation of recombination at the front interface.120–123 Conclusively, it is important to mention that the isoelectronic substitution of cations in the CTZS lattice with dopants such as Ag has proven to be beneficial in controlling the inherent defect chemistry of bulk CZTS. However, there are other factors such as elemental inter-diffusion that alter the interface defect chemistry, which plays a pivotal role in device performance.

2.1.3 Inter-diffusion of elements at the CZTSSe/CdS interface. 
The intermixing of elements at the interface during the formation of the p–n junction while depositing CdS on the CZTSSe absorber is another matter of deep concern and has been investigated extensively. The inter-diffusion of elements takes place during the deposition of the CdS buffer layer over the CZTSSe absorber, which leads to different chemistry at the interface. Cd usually diffuses deep inside the CZTSSe film while the presence of Cu, Zn, and Sn elements is also observed in the CdS layer.52 It is generally observed that Cd diffusion is associated with the method of its deposition. It is most likely that Cd deposited using the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method diffuses deep inside the CZTSSe bulk.124 Cd can occupy the Cu lattice site as well as the Zn lattice site within the CZTS crystal structure. Because of the isoelectronic configuration of Cd and Zn and the low formation energy of the CdZn antisite as compared to the CdCu antisite, Cd prefers to replace Zn rather than Cu. The CdZn antisite offers deep acceptor trap states that adversely affect the charge carrier dynamics.125 However, a study reveals that if Cd replaces Cu to form the CdCu antisite, then it contributes to the n-type nature or form an inversion layer at the interface, which consequently enlarges the depletion layer.5 Yuan et al. reported that an appropriate concentration of Cd inside the absorber layer acts as the Cd doping and favorably improves the absorber layer quality. Nevertheless, highly Cd-rich conditions cause the existence of CdS inside the absorber, which should be avoided.96 The presence of CdS inside the CZTSSe film forms an intrinsic p–n junction, which can severely affect the charge carrier's momentum inside the CZTSSe film. The Cd diffusion behavior strongly depends on the nature of the absorber layer,59 which may be the reason behind the huge performance gap between the CdS employed in CIGS and CZTS. As a proof of concept, CdS was deposited over CZTS samples, which were prepared with different sulfurization conditions. The EDX line scan of each sample confirms that Cd diffusion in each CZTS sample is different. In several reports, Zn diffusion is also realized into CdS to form the (Zn,Cd)S layer, which can shift the energy level alignment from “cliff”- to “spike”-like at the interface.5,126 It is due to the fact that CdS and ZnS form a stable ternary compound while other ternary compounds such as Cu–Zn–S or Sn–Zn–S do not exist.127 Such a kind of elemental inter-diffusion is found to be significantly advantageous for a healthy p–n junction. Sometimes, the p–n junction formed at the CZTS–CdS interface is found to be very abrupt. One of the possible and easy solutions for such a kind of abrupt interface is to subject the absorber–buffer interface to heat treatment.
Considering this fact, Sousa et al. optimized post-annealing in the CZTS thin film solar cell and evaluated the impact of heat treatment on the device performance.128 Post-deposition annealing after different stages of device fabrication is performed, though the highest efficiency is obtained with the single step annealing of the complete device. All the J–V curves before and post deposition heat treatment at different stages are shown in Fig. 6(a). To investigate the efficiency enhancement mechanism, in-depth XPS analysis of the CZTS/CdS heterojunction was performed before and post deposition annealing. The migration of Cu and Zn inside CdS and Cd into CZTS leads to the formation of a buried homojunction, which is responsible for the reduction in non-radiative recombination at the interface. The double diodic behavior recognized in the J–V curves before annealing is often because of interface defect states, which are removed after annealing, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Yan et al. comprehensively investigated the impact of heat treatment over severe non-radiative recombination in the CZTS/CdS heterojunction regime.5 A PCE of 11% is reported for the CZTS solar cell using heat treatment in order to reduce interface recombination, which is the first pure sulfide kesterite solar cell to exceed 10% device efficiency. To understand the factors responsible for the dramatic improvement in the device efficiency after heat treatment, a variety of characterization measurements were employed. The XPS elemental depth profile successfully demonstrated Zn diffusion into CdS and Cd diffusion into CZTS, which shifts the energy level alignment favorably. The increased minority carrier life time and activation energy (EA) found closer to the band gap strongly favors the reduction in the non-radiative recombination at the CZTS/CdS heterojunction after heat treatment. Another detailed study of low temperature (200 °C) post-deposition annealing reveals the significant enhancement in PCE from 2.2 to 8.3%. Fig. 6(b) schematically presents that annealing promotes the diffusion of Cu inside the CdS layer and Zn enrichment of the CZTSe surface compared to the CZTSe bulk. Diffused Cu in CdS incorporated on the cationic site (CuCd) acts as acceptor defects, which compensates the n-type CdS layer. In addition, the Cu-depleted and Zn-enrich CZTSe surface is energetically favorable for the formation of a good quality p–n junction at the CZTSe/CdS heterojunction. These chemical modifications after annealing treatment introduced a significant difference in the device performance, as shown in Fig. 6(b).129 Moreover, Chen and his group also performed soft-baking of the junction so as to engineer the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction.53 Cd inside CZTSSe and Se in CdS get inter-diffused significantly after baking, as schematically shown in Fig. 6(c). The calculated activation energy for the trapping state is 294 meV for the sample with soft-baking at 100 °C. This activation energy is very close to the deep CuSn defect energy level. However, soft-baking at elevated temperature, i.e., 200 °C, results in a much lower activation energy of 109 meV, which corresponds to relatively shallow acceptor defects such as VCu. Thus, post-heat treatment significantly quenches the defect energy levels of the interface. The improvement in the PCE after soft-baking at elevated temperature is attributed to the inter-diffusion occurring at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction. Therefore, inter-diffusion is found to improve the interface quality by forming a buried homojunction, thus altering the defect chemistry at the interface and adjusting the energy level alignment between the buffer and the absorber. Consequently, it assists in quenching the non-radiative recombination at the interface. However, it is preliminary to examine the energy level alignment at the interface, which is reviewed in detail in the next section. The CZTS/CZTSSe device undergoing different annealing conditions are summarized in Table 3.

2.2 Electrical properties of the CZTSSe/CdS interface

2.2.1 Energy level alignment at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction. 
Two types of energy level alignment are reported at the CZTSSe/CdS interface: “cliff”-like and “spike”-like, as shown in Fig. 3(a) and (b). When the conduction band (CB) of CdS is lower than the CB of CZTS, the “cliff”-like conformation is formed. On the other hand, if the CB of CdS lies above the CB of the CZTS layer, the “spike”-like conformation is observed. It is suggested that for efficient charge transportation, “spike”-like alignment within the conduction band offset (CBO) range of 0–0.4 eV is favorable at the interface.7,22,32,52,134,135 On the other hand, “cliff”-like conformation is unfavorable due to the narrowing of interface band gap, which enhances the charge carrier recombination at the interface. For “cliff”-like CBO found at the CZTSSe/CdS interface, the activation energy of interface recombination is equal to the energy difference of CBM of CdS and VBM of the CZTSSe material due to cross-recombination. Therefore, “cliff”-like CBO offers an activation energy (EA) lower than the band gap of CZTSSe and leads to interface recombination dominant path.136,137 Most of the groups have reported “cliff”-like energy level alignment at the CZTSSe/CdS interface.32,57 However, Haight et al. observed “spike”-like conformation at the CZTSe/CdS interface using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) optimized by varying the S/(S + Se) ratio.138 The compilation of measured band offsets at the CZTSSe/CdS heterjunction is tabulated schematically in Table 4. For reference and comparison, the CIGS champion device parameters are also included in the table. High performance CIGS solar cells acquire positive CBO or “spike”-like alignment at the CIGS/CdS heterojunctions.139 This is one of the major reasons that the dominating recombination channels exist inside the CIGS absorber and not at the interface in the CIGS solar cells, as described earlier in Fig. 1. Tajima et al. used hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (HAXPES) to evaluate the VBO and CBO at the CZTS/CdS interface.140 Almost flat band CBM is estimated at the CZTS/CdS interface with a CBO of 0.0 ± 0.1 eV. It is reported that HAXPES is a more precise technique to evaluate the CBO rather than the core level energies by XPS. The core level energies often shift due to chemical changes caused by the impurities. Haight et al. observed a shift in the valence band edge towards higher binding energy on altering the [S]/[S + Se] ratio.138Fig. 7(a) shows that the CZTSSe/CdS valence band offset (VBO) is a function of the [S]/[S + Se] ratio, where a shift of ∼200 meV in VBO from a fully selenized (x = 0) to a fully sulfurized (x = 1) CZTS film is observed. Fig. 7(a) also depicts the schematic of the electronic structure for the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction, where the change in the CBO due to the shift in VBO is clearly visible. Although spike conformation is observed in all the cases, however the CBO values are above the optimal range (0–0.4 eV); thus, it can contribute to lower JSC and FF in the CZTSSe devices. Bao and his group carried out an important study where the impact of the crystal structure and its orientation on the CBO of the CZTS/CdS interface was examined using first principal calculations.141 It is reported that two different phases of CZTS, i.e., stannite and kesterite form different kinds of interface with the CdS buffer layer. Fig. 7(b) shows the supercells of (001)-oriented and (010)-oriented CdS with stannite and kesterite CZTS phases. The band alignment retrieved from the first principal calculations for different orientation of CdS with different CZTS phases is shown in Fig. 7(b). The calculated VBO values for the (001) and (010)-oriented CdS with stannite-CZTS are 1.1 eV and 1.3 eV, respectively, while with kesterite-CZTS, the VBO is found to be 1.2 eV and 1.0 eV, respectively. This concludes that the CBO is negative or “cliff”-like at the CZTS/CdS interface, irrespective of the orientation and crystal structure of the CZTS film. Not only the crystal structure and its orientation but also the elemental inter-diffusion at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction introduce modifications in the band alignment. Fig. 7(c) schematically shows that the diffusion of Cd in CZTS and Zn in the CdS layer consequently forms C(Cd,Zn)TS thin layer towards the CZTS film, while (Zn,Cd)S forms a thin layer towards the CdS buffer layer. Originally, the CBO at the CZTS/CdS interface without inter-diffusion is unfavorable, i.e., “cliff”-like (−0.1 eV). On the other hand, the band alignment at the CZTS/CdS interface shifts to favorable “spike”-like with CBO +0.2 eV in the presence of inter-diffusion, as shown in Fig. 7(c). However, for CZTSe, inter-diffusion again seems to be unfavorable at the CZTSe/CdS heterojunction, where the CBO increases from 0.3 eV to 0.5 eV, which acts as a barrier to the photogenerated charge carriers, as shown in Fig. 7(c).61 Therefore, it clearly indicates that the VBO and CBO values can be significantly modified by the inter-diffusion of elements.

(c) At the CZTS/CdS interface: Favorable band alignment is achieved after significant inter-diffusion, whereas “cliff”-like unfavorable CBO (−0.1 eV) is exhibited at the CZTS/CdS interface without inter-diffusion. At the CZTSe/CdS interface: after significant inter-diffusion, unfavorable (+0.5 eV) band alignment is observed while without inter-diffusion band alignment at the CZTSe/CdS interface is favorable with a CBO of +0.3 eV. Reproduced with permission from ref. 61. 
The VBO and CBO are derived by calculating the band bending at the junction region, which shifts the VBM and CBM positions at the interface. Band bending can be derived by comparing the core level energies at the interface to the core level energies far away from the interface (bulk).61 Band bending at any heterojunction is a reflection of the presence of an electric field and the corresponding electrostatic potential at the junction. Larger band bending implies larger electric field existing at any junction, which is essential for separating the photogenerated charge carriers at the p–n junction. Yan et al. reported that band bending increases after heat treatment from 0.09 eV to 0.19 eV due to elemental inter-mixing at the heterojunction.5 The increase in band bending at the CZTS/CdS interface or at the p–n junction provides efficient charge separation and reduces interface-dominated recombination. Therefore, it is critical to examine the p–n junction parameters including electric field, depletion width, and carrier density, which is essential for the charge transport mechanism across the heterojunction.


2.2.2 p–n junction properties of the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction. 
Besides the energy level alignment, interfacial properties such as electric field, space charge region width (Wd), and carrier density also play a vital role in charge dynamics across the interface. A higher electric field at the heterojunctions assists in the quick separation and transportation of the photogenerated charge carriers towards the collecting electrodes. However, under a weak electric field, Shockley–Read–Hall (SRH) recombination will dominate via the trap states located within the forbidden gap. Apart from the high electric field, a larger depletion region also increases the charge collection probability of the photogenerated carriers.34 Li and his group focused on enlarging the depletion region width by optimizing the Zn/Sn ratio in order to improve the CZTSSe device performance.149 It is observed that the PCE of the device is very sensitive to the depletion width (Wd), which offered a huge boost to PCE from 7.7% to 10.2% when the Wd was widened from 141 nm to 238 nm. In order to modify the electrical properties, CZTS is subjected to three different annealing conditions: process I-sulfurization in the presence of only sulfur ambience, process II-sulfurization in the presence of only sulfur ambience with air annealing, process III-sulfurization in the presence of both sulfur and SnS ambience.59 The CZTS device from process II has a longer diffusion length but suffers from short depletion width compared to the device from process I. This makes little difference in the carrier collection length between them. Also, the EQE of the process II device is found to be slightly lower in the complete light spectrum than that of process I. Because of the wider depletion width and longer minority charge lifetime, the device from process III shows the best device performance amongst the three CZTS devices. In addition, the double-layered CZTS structure is also fabricated with low Cu content at the top and high Cu content at the bottom with the intention to investigate the effect of Cu gradient over the p–n junction properties.72 Low carrier concentration and larger depletion width are affiliated to the relatively low Cu content near the junction. However, the Cu-rich bottom CZTS layer facilitates good ohmic contact between Mo and the CZTS layer and reduces the series resistance. Therefore, the double-layered CZTS structure proved to be an effective way to boost the VOC and FF of the device by modifying the p–n junction properties related to the Cu concentration near the interface regime. Table 5 lists the impact of the depletion region, low carrier concentration, and high built-in potential in the enhancing power conversion efficiency of CZTSSe-based devices. The data comprised in Table 5 concludes that efficient charge separation is directly correlated to the p–n junction parameters.

3. Different approaches used so far to engineer the absorber/buffer interface
So far, the main causes for VOC deficit have been explored in detail by assessing the interface defect chemistry, energy level alignment, and probing the interfacial electrical properties. It provides a deep insight into the interface dynamics to comprehend the fundamentals behind the device performance. Various approaches have been implemented to engineer the absorber/buffer interface so as to combat the VOC deficit issues prevalent in the CZTSSe photovoltaic technology. For CIGS solar cells, different alternate buffer layers have been implemented in order to improve the energy level alignment and also to mitigate the challenge of parasitic absorption by CdS due to its narrow band gap of 2.4 eV. Scientists from National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) have recorded almost comparable efficiency for those attained with CdS for CIGS using ZnS(O,OH),153 Zn(O,S),154 ZnSnO,155 and ZnMgO156 buffer layers. Likewise, researchers have applied a variety of alternate buffer materials and passivation layers for interface engineering in the CZTSSe solar cells. Although, till now, the maximum efficiency of CZTSSe devices obtained with the CdS buffer layer has been achieved but researchers have been unable to improve the efficiency above the benchmark in the last several years. That is why the search for a suitable alternate buffer layer is still going on. This section will discuss the deployment of different buffer layers and passivation layers so far by researchers to engineer the CZTSSe/CdS interface.
3.1 Employment of alternate buffer layers

3.1.1 Zinc oxy-sulfide (Zn(O,S)). 
Among different alternatives, Zn(O,S) is one of the potential substitutes for the conventional CdS buffer layer as its conduction band can be tuned by varying the oxygen to sulfur ratio.157–159 In CIGS, the highest recorded efficiency with the Zn(O,S) buffer layer deposited by RF sputtering, chemical bath deposition (CBD), and atomic layer deposition (ALD) is 18%,160 20.9%,161 and 21%,162 respectively. The obtained efficiencies are comparable to that achieved by the CdS buffer layer in CIGS solar cells.163 Therefore, it is important to explore the performance of CZTS solar cells based on the Zn(O,S) buffer layer. The Ericson research group inspected the O/S ratio of the Zn(O,S) films deposited by ALD to optimize the energy level alignment at the CZTS and Zn(O,S) interface.158 The best CZTS device based on the Zn(O,S) buffer with O/S = 6:1 shows an efficiency of about 4.6%. Hong et al. deposited Zn(O,S) using NH4OH solution instead of using pure H2O as the oxygen source during the ALD process to further improve the efficiency of the CZTS solar cell.164Fig. 8(a) presents the dark-field STEM image for the Zn(O,S)-based complete solar cell fabricated using NH4OH solution. The comparison of PCE of CZTSSe devices with the Zn(O,S) buffer layer fabricated using pure H2O and using NH4OH solution is shown in Fig. 8(a). It is believed that NH4OH etches the detrimental secondary phases from the CZTSSe surface before Zn(O,S) deposition so as to enhance the heterojunction quality. However, the ref-CdS based solar cell has been reported to have a higher efficiency than that of the Zn(O,S)-based solar cell. Yan et al. investigated the energy level alignment at the CZTS and Zn(O,S) junction and a very high CBO of about 0.9 eV was observed, which leads to no power generation.57 The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) prepared the Zn(O,S) film on CZTS by the CBD method and yielded a decent PCE of 5%.165

3.1.2 Zinc-cadmium-sulphide (ZnCdS). 
To overcome the disputes related to CdS, ZnCdS is one of the best options due to its large band gap, similar crystal structure, and lattice matching with CZTS. ZnCdS has shown remarkable improvement in open circuit voltage due to the alteration in the band alignment from “cliff” to “spike” by varying the Cd/Zn ratio. The optimum energy level alignment with a CBO of 0.37 eV is observed for the Zn0.35Cd0.65S/CZTS interface.134 Sun et al. reported greater than 10% efficiency of the CZTS-based device with ZnCdS deposited by the SILAR method by modifying the chemical ambient during ZnCdS deposition.166 The self-assembly of the ZnS layer at the interface of CZTS/ZnCdS improves the device performance by passivating the defects states at the heterojunction, as shown in Fig. 8(b).167 However, along with the toxicity issue, metastable behavior is also associated with the Zn-based buffer layer.168


3.1.3 Zinc sulfide (ZnS). 
ZnS is Cd-free and is a very promising abundant material with a wide band gap (3.6 eV). ZnS has a similar crystal structure as that of CZTS, which leads to only 1% lattice mismatch,169 in contrast to 7% with the CdS buffer layer at the CZTS/CdS interface.170 Nguyen et al. investigated the effect of thickness, morphology, and chemical composition of ZnS over the PCE of CZTSSe monograin devices.171 The best monograin CZTSSe device with the ZnS film grown by CBD showed an efficiency of 4.5%. Sakai et al. reported 5.82% efficiency of the CZTS solar cells using the CBD grown ZnS buffer layer.172 Li and his group observed that an appropriate amount of segregation of highly resistive ZnS in the depletion region can effectively suppress interface recombination,173 thereby improving the VOC and increasing the shunt resistance. Despite having many favorable features, the PCE with ZnS still not closer to that achieved with CdS.


3.1.4 Zinc manganese oxide (ZnMgO). 
ZnMgO has attracted attention because of its potential to control the CBO by varying the Mg/(Zn + Mg) ratio. Hironiwa and his group deposited ZnMgO by co-sputtering of ZnO and MgO targets in order to investigate the effect of Mg content on the CBO.174 The band gap of the ZnMgO layer is tuned within the range from 3.54 eV to 4.41 eV by altering the Mg/(Zn + Mg) ratio. The ZnMgO buffer layer with a band gap of 3.76 eV corresponds to the device with the highest PCE, which may be attributed to the appropriate energy level alignment at the CZTS and ZnMgO heterojunction. This research group has also investigated the annealing effect on the CZTSSe devices with the ZnMgO buffer layer.175 The annealing treatment of the CZTSSe devices is expected to recover the sputtering damage imparted to the surface of the film. However, the solar cell performance is found to be degraded after annealing treatment, which is ascribed to the decrease in the built-in potential at the CZTSSe/ZnMgO interface. Not many reports have been published with the ZnMgO buffer layer in CZTSSe solar cells.


3.1.5 Zinc tin oxide (ZnSnO). 
ZnSnO (ZTO) has proven to be the most promising alternate buffer material by far for CZTSSe as the performance with ZTO continuously matches the performance of that using CdS. Moreover, the band gap of the ZTO material and the CBO of the CZTSSe/ZTO heterojunction can be well-regulated by controlling the Zn/Sn ratio. Li and his group optimized the ZTO grown by ALD by controlling the Sn/(Sn + Zn) ratio for favorable energy level alignment at the interface.176 It has been observed that the ZTO layer with the Sn/(Sn + Zn) ALD pulse ratio of 0.167 shows the best device performance due to the favorable CBO at the CZTSSe/ZTO interface. The effect of the substrate temperature on the properties of the ALD-deposited ZTO film is comprehensively investigated.177 It has been observed that the Sn/(Sn + Zn) ratio is only slightly dependent on the deposition temperature while other parameters such as material structure, film density, band gap, and growth rate of the ZTO film are strongly temperature-dependent. Moreover, some groups have reported that the change in the conduction band energy levels are because of the quantum confinement effect. 9% PCE is reported with ZTO for CZTSSe solar cells by adjusting the energy level alignment at the CZTSSe/ZTO interface.178 The ALD deposition temperature is varied in the range of 105–165 °C in order to change the band gap of the ZTO film. The device fabricated with ZTO deposited at 145 °C delivered the best performance with the highest open circuit voltage. The improvement in the absorber quality by heating during ZTO deposition substantially contributed to the enhancement in the PCE. In another study, Cui et al. also reported 9.3% efficiency (with anti-reflecting coating) with the ZTO buffer layer, which is higher than that of the CdS buffer layer (6.9%).179 The device structure for both the buffer layers, CdS and ZTO, is schematically shown in Fig. 8(c) along with the J–V characteristics. The XPS investigations confirm the “spike”-like CBO at the CZTS/ZTO heterojunction, which is favorable for junction quality and efficient charge collection probability. Thus, the enhancement in the performance can be directly correlated to the reduced interface recombination caused by the ZTO buffer layer. An ultrathin passivation layer of Al2O3 deposited by ALD is applied at the CZTS/ZTO interface to further enhance the CZTS cell performance.180 Cd-free CZTS demonstrates 10.2% efficiency, which is directly attributed to the passivation of the CZTS/ZTO heterojunction induced by the Al2O3 layer. To date, ZTO has been proved to be a potential substitute to the conventional CdS buffer layer.


3.1.6 Indium sulfide (In2S3). 
Being non-toxic and an in-direct low band gap (Eg = 2.1 eV) material, In2S3 has the potential to become an effective substitute to CdS in CZTSSe solar cells. A small positive conduction band offset is found in many reports at the CZTS/In2S3 heterojunction, which is required for efficient charge transportation at the interface.181,182 Jiang et al. determined the positive CBO of 0.11 eV at the CZTS/In2S3 heterointerface with the PCE of 6.9%.182 The application of rapid post-heating treatment to the CZTS/In2S3 interface (In2S3/CZTS_PH) promoted indium diffusion in the CZTS layer near the interface regime. Indium diffusion results in the formation of InSn defects, which leads to p-type doping in CZTS near the interface area. High acceptor concentration due to indium diffusion, as confirmed by cross-sectional scanning capacitance microscopy (SCM) image, is shown in Fig. 8(d). Highly positive dC/dV values affirmed by light appearance are realized near the interface area for the In2S3/CZTS_PH film. It is observed that indium diffusion is beneficial for improving the built-in potential across the p–n junction, thus leading to improved VOC of the device. The dark J–V curves of the solar cells based on In2S3(90)/Cu2ZnSnS4_w/o (without post-heating treatment) and In2S3(90)/Cu2ZnSnS4_PH are shown in Fig. 8(d), where (90) represents the thickness of the In2S3 layer (in nm). Relatively low ideality factor is obtained for the In2S3(90)/Cu2ZnSnS4_PH-based device owing to the effective reduction of the recombination current by suppressing the deep defects. A device fabricated using non-vacuum approach by depositing the CZTSe and the In2S3 buffer layer using chemical spray pyrolysis has been successfully achieved with the PCE of 5.74%.183 However, admittance spectroscopy reveals that device performance is limited by high back contact barrier, i.e., 124.6 meV, and high deep defect densities in the absorber. A high throughput combinatorial approach to grow the In2S3 buffer layer adapted for the in-depth investigation of the temperature-flux parameter space is a time-efficient way and is schematically shown in Fig. 9(a). The complete device library structure is schematically illustrated in Fig. 9(b). A pure β-In2S3 phase is deposited by tuning the substrate temperature and the ambient temperature in the presence of H2S. It has been observed that the transport properties are strongly dependent on the substrate temperature and the buffer layer thickness. The results of device efficiencies, VOC, and JSC for different In2S3 buffer layer thicknesses at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 9(c). The CZTS device fabricated with the In2S3 buffer material grown at 290 °C substrate temperature with optimum thickness delivered the best performance as compared to the device with CdS reference.184

3.1.7 Zinc oxide (ZnO). 
ZnO, a wide band gap non-toxic material (Eg = 3.3 eV), could be an attractive Cd-free material for CdS substitution. Barkhouse et al. determined that the CBO at CZTS/ZnO interface is approximately within the range of ±0.1 eV, which suggests that it can have the potential to replace the CdS buffer layer.181 Htay et al. achieved 4.29% efficiency with ultrasonic spray pyrolysis-deposited ZnO film over the CZTS absorber layer.185 In comparison to the CZTS/CdS heterojunction, larger FF and VOC is obtained with the CZTS/ZnO heterojunction. However, the PCE of the CdS-based device is higher than that of the ZnO-based solar cell. Katagiri and his group prepared a 60 nm ZnO thin film using an atmospheric chemical vapor deposition.186 The highest conversion efficiency achieved in this study is 5.19% with the sample substrate temperature of 250 °C. However, only limited studies have been reported with the ZnO buffer layer as the material is highly insulating.


3.1.8 ZnS(O,OH). 
This is another probable alternative due to the possibility of tuning the CBO by optimizing the sulfur to oxygen ratio. Neuschitzer et al. reported 5.6% efficiency CZTSSe device with the CBD-deposited ZnS(O,OH) buffer layer. The best cell is optimized by varying the thiourea concentration in the CBD solution.187 The effects of light-soaking treatment has also been studied with the ZnS(O,OH) buffer layer for the CZTSSe solar cells.188 The complex phase formation and stability issues limit the researchers to use ZnS(O,OH) as an alternative buffer layer in CZTS solar cells. Table 6 summarizes different buffer layers used in the CZTSSe solar cells with the device characteristics. Despite the fact that several alternate materials have been deployed to replace CdS, the field is still open for researchers to introduce novel and Cd-free wide band gap materials, which can overcome issues associated with CdS and other buffer layers.

3.2 Incorporation of the defect passivation layer at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunctions
Apart from alternate buffer layers, inserting a thin defect passivation layer at the heterojunction has become an eminent approach towards the modification of the interfacial properties. It reduces the non-radiative recombination at the CZTSSe/CdS interface. Dielectric materials with wide band gap are a better choice for passivation because along with the passivation of charged point defects, it helps to quench recombination through the surface defect states. The conformal coating of Al2O3 grown by ALD over CZTS proved to be an effective way to reduce interface recombination. Lee et al. introduced ultrathin Al2O3 layer not only at the CZTS/CdS heterojunction but also in between CdS and the ITO layer by replacing ZnO to enhance the device performance.197 The best efficiency achieved after introducing the 5 nm Al2O3 layer at the CZTS/CdS interface is 11.5%, as shown in Fig. 10(a). Another study examines the effect of passivated and non-passivated CZTSSe/CdS heterojunctions over the density of interface defects. The detailed analysis of the C–V profiles reveals that the depletion region width of the passivated device (CZTSSe/Al2O3/CdS) is about 515 nm, while it is 325 nm for the unpassivated CZTSSe/CdS device. Moreover, the application of Al2O3 reduced the density of the acceptor defect states at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction.198 A very new and different approach has been investigated by Park et al. for CZTS/CdS interface passivation.199 They realized that hydrogen generation during the deposition process of ultrathin ALD-Al2O3 at the CZTS/CdS interface is solely responsible for defect passivation at the interface. ALD-Al2O3 does not play any role in interface passivation as it is etched away during CdS deposition by ammonium hydroxide, as confirmed by TEM and XPS measurements. ERDA (elastic recoil detection analysis) and KPFM (Kelvin probe force microscopy) measurements verified that hydrogen from the ALD process diffused and gets accumulated into the CZTS absorber in the proximity of the interface regime. Different amounts of hydrogen is imported by controlling the thickness of the ALD-Al2O3 layer at the CZTS/CdS heterointerface. In comparison to the reference sample, the CZTS device efficiency improved by 25% due to VOC enhancement. This was found to be a new and potential route for heterointerface passivation. Wu et al. applied ALD-deposited TiO2 as a passivation layer between the CZTSSe and the CdS layer to reduce the VOC deficit.200 The results shown in Fig. 10(b) clearly display the impact of the TiO2 passivation layer over the VOC deficit and the device efficiency. The temperature-dependent VOC measurements performed on the CZTSSe PV device with the ALD-deposited TiO2 passivation layer shows that the activation energy (EA) of the main recombination process is ∼40 meV higher (or closer to the band gap) than that of the controlled CZTSSe device, which clearly reflects the passivation of the interface defect states. An ultrathin SnO2 deposited by the SILAR method is also introduced in order to passivate the defects at the CZTS/CdS interface. The device structure and band alignment schematically shown in Fig. 10(c) depict that the CBO between CZTS and the SnO2 layer is 0.2 eV, which can still allow the electrons to tunnel through the ultrathin SnO2 layer. Moreover, higher VBO (2 to 2.2 eV) passivates the junction by blocking the majority carrier (holes) of CZTS from the CdS buffer layer. Fig. 10(c) displays the rise in the device efficiency from 6.82% to 8.47%, which is majorly attributed to the improvement in the VOC value from 638 mV to 657 mV.60 To address the problem of lattice mismatch at the CZTS/CdS interface, the lattice matching with the very thin CeO2 interlayer is incorporated between the CZTS and CdS materials. The lattice mismatch between CZTS and CeO2 is under 0.4%, thus making it possible to obtain an epitaxial interface, which may suppress the interface recombination issue. CeO2 is deposited by the chemical bath deposition at low temperature (50 °C). The improvement observed in the VOC is solely attributed to the high-quality CZTS/CeO2 heterointerface.201

The passivation effect at the interface can be realized by incorporating the passivation layer intentionally and it can also form itself during processing. Sun et al. observed a self-assembled ZnS layer at the CZTS/ZnCdS heterojunction formed during ZnCdS deposition by Zn diffusion from the ZnCdS layer.166 After careful investigation of the elemental distribution at the interface of the three different CZTS absorbers with Zn/Sn = 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3, Zn precipitation was found only at the interface of the CZTS absorber with Zn/Sn = 1.1. A less than 5 nm ZnS layer can be seen in Zn element mapping, as shown in Fig. 11(a). It is also confirmed by the EDS line scan of the three different heterojunctions. The Zn profile in the EDS line scan for CZTS with Zn/Sn = 1.1 shows a distinct rise when scanning from ZnCdS to CZTS. For further verification, EDS mapping at the CZTS/CdS interface and the bare CZTS surface is also performed, which reveals the fact that the ZnS layer originates from ZnCdS with no signals of ZnS segregation at the CZTS/CdS interface. This dielectric intermediate ZnS layer acts as a passivation layer and reduces non-radiative interface recombination. The passivated device shows lower series resistance and reverse saturation current; thereby, the device efficiency is boosted from 7.58% to 9.25%. The careful investigation of the microstructure and the chemical ambience of the CZTS/ZTO heterojunction shows the presence of an ultrathin Zn(O,S) layer at this interface, as presented in the inset image of Fig. 11(b). The schematic band diagram depicted in Fig. 11(b) shows that Zn(O,S) acts as a tunnel layer at the CZTS/ZTO heterojunction, which reduces the interface recombination significantly. The CZTS/Zn(O,S)/ZTO heterojunctions suppress the interface defects by minimizing the lattice mismatch at the junction, hence leading to significant improvement in the open circuit voltage. The device with the CZTS/Zn(O,S)/ZTO interface demonstrates 9.3% PCE by reducing interface recombination, as shown in Fig. 11(b).179 Thus, high device performance can be achieved by introducing a passivation layer at the absorber/buffer interface as it is beneficial for passivating the electronically active trap states existing at the interface. It is already discussed that these trap states cause severe non-radiative recombination and hence are required to be passivated. So far, the intermediate layers deployed at the CZTS/CdS interface have shown real benefits in grooming the device performance in terms of facilitating the charge transfer mechanism. However, several reports have been published in this direction exploiting the positive effects of the passivation layer on the device characteristics; hence, the field is still open to be explored further. New materials can be employed at the front interface to overcome the current challenges and the development of an ideal interface for CZTSSe photovoltaic technology.

Lower three cross-sectional images show the line scan of the interface region from the CZTS device fabricated using the absorber with different compositions, such as Zn/Sn = 1.3, Zn/Sn = 1.2, and Zn/Sn = 1.1 (Zn and S only).

4. Critical role of characterization tools in probing the absorber/buffer interface
After assessing all the possible processes, mechanisms, and approaches reported to date in order to settle the performance parity among CZTSSe and matured CIGS technology, it now becomes vital to realize the importance of characterization tools widely used to probe interfacial characteristics. The characterization tools play a pivotal role in photovoltaic development and are essential for fully understanding the impact of individual device components on the photovoltaic performance. Comprehensive characterization is required for the recognition of a set of physical parameters, which can be associated with the actual device performance. Fig. 12 displays various techniques that have been used to probe the CZTS/CdS interface in different aspects. These tools provide needful information about the different chemical, physical, and electrical properties of the interface, which is indispensable for the improvement of the interface quality. This section will summarize the different characterization methods adopted for the determination of different interfacial properties including unintentional impurities (trap or defects states) at the interface, energy levels, time scale, and characteristic length related to the charge transport process.

4.1 Structure or phase identification
Recognizing the crystal structure is usually the initial step in identifying a material, which is followed by the determination of other chemical and electrical properties. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a fundamental technique that has been widely used to explore the crystal structure of the CZTSSe absorber, the CdS buffer, and other constituents of the device. Along with the crystalline phase, the ordering and regularity of the ions forming a crystal lattice in the sample can be identified from XRD analysis.202 Sousa et al. performed XRD on the CZTS/CdS heterojunction to investigate any structural modification post annealing.128 It was observed that the peak intensity of the XRD peaks decreases after annealing, indicating that the CZTS crystal structure is slightly degraded, as shown in Fig. 13(a). The crystallite size can be extracted from the peak broadening or FWHM (Full Width Half Maxima) using the Scherrer formula: (1)where, K is the dimensionless shape factor, λ is the wavelength of X-rays (1.54 eV for standard Cu-α beam), β is FWHM of the peak, and θ is considered for XRD peak position. The crystallite size affects the diffusion coefficient of the charge carrier (electron) inside the CZTS and the CdS film, which consequently influences the charge collection probability.203 By carefully examining the peak shift before and after any physical treatment, the strain and lattice distortion in the crystal can be evaluated. From Fig. 13(a), the XRD peak shift towards a lower diffraction angle post annealing suggests an increase in the inter-planner spacing owing to structural relaxation. The structural relaxation reduces the defects that appeared due to lattice mismatch or stress or strain at the CZTSSe/CdS interface and led to a decrease in the interface recombination current. The average strain (ε) can be calculated from XRD using following equation. (2)

The presence of residual strain inside the film and its propagation towards the interface affects the charge carrier dynamics of photovoltaic device, significantly. Strain engineering is currently the foremost approach towards the development of high-efficiency perovskite photovoltaic technology.204 However, the CZTSSe technology is still lagging behind in this area, which may play a crucial role in the path towards high-efficiency CZTSSe solar cells. Therefore, it is critically important to further evaluate the strain engineering in CZTS technology using high potential grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) technique. Moreover, the XRD technique is able to identify the prepared CZTS phase, i.e., kesterite and stannite, distinctively. As shown in Fig. 7(b), different CZTS phases possess different CBO values with the CdS layer at the interface, thereby affecting the charge carrier dynamics differently at the CZTS/CdS heterojunction.144 Nevertheless, the XRD technique fails to distinguish the CZTS phase from the detrimental secondary phases such as ZnS and Cu2SnS3 as these phases have identical crystal structure to that of CZTS.205–208 Therefore, Raman spectroscopy is used to overcome this shortcoming as the technique is not sensitive to the long range order.209,210
Raman spectroscopy is one of the most effective tools for determining the crystalline structure and the quality of the CZTS and CdS thin film. The presence of deleterious secondary phases on the surface of the CZTS film is very crucial to identify because these phases lead to the destruction of the interface quality after CdS deposition. Different excitation wavelengths in Raman spectroscopy corresponding to near resonant excitation conditions have been used for the identification of each secondary phase in the bulk CZTS and close to the interface.211 Different wavelengths have different penetration depths in the material, which give key information about the presence of secondary phases at different depths of the film. Fig. 13(b) shows the Raman spectra of the CZTS film with the indication of the characteristic peaks obtained using different excitation wavelengths. The inset in Fig. 13(b) depicts the Raman spectra performed with 325 nm excitation wavelength in the CZTS sample and in the reference ZnS sample. The ZnS characteristic peaks are observed at 697 and 1045 cm−1 analogous to the second and third order of the ZnS Raman mode, respectively. Since these peaks are not found in the CZTS Raman spectra, the absence of the ZnS phase is confirmed. Thus, multi-wavelength excitation Raman mode is advantageous for identifying the existence of detrimental secondary phases in CZTS. Raman spectroscopy has proven to be beneficial in tracking the interfacial quality post the annealing treatment of the CZTS/CdS interface.128 It is observed that the CdS peak intensity increases while the FWHM decrease drastically, which suggests an improvement in the crystallinity of CdS, as shown in Fig. 13(c). At the same time, the intensity of the main CZTS peak at 337.2 cm−1 decreases post deposition annealing, which is the result of the deterioration of Cu/Zn disordering. Sanchez et al. performed Raman spectroscopy on the CZTSe/CdS interface to evaluate the impact of the Cu doped-CdS film over the heterointerface.212 The main CZTSe Raman peak is not affected by the variation in the Cu concentration in the CdS layer. Thus, this information from Raman measurement suggests that all the changes in the optoelectronic parameters are mainly attributed to the changes in the CdS layer. The device with a highly Cu-doped CdS layer achieved the highest PCE of 6.1% in contrast to the device efficiency of the undoped CdS film (1.6%). This enhancement could be related to the modification experienced at the CZTSe/CdS heterojunction after Cu doping in the CdS film. Though the information obtained from this fundamental technique is vital, however, the tool still possesses certain limitations. There is a potential of damaging the sample due to laser exposure, which has to be taken into account while planning the measurements. Moreover, the spot size of the Raman laser is about 5 μm, which scans the surface and provides information; therefore, it is difficult to relate small scale information to the entire sample, especially in a multiphase CZTS material. Alternative to this, Raman mapping could be the option for whole surface information. Although mapping is time-consuming, it can provide vital information about the presence of secondary phases and the compositional inhomogeneities over the CZTS surface. Emphasis should be put on developing a relation among different length scales efficiently. We believe that the Raman technique can be used to acquire more information about the interface chemistry caused by the inter-diffusion of elements.
4.2 Probing the interface chemistry and energy level alignment
The chemistry of the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction predominantly governs the device performance as devices with different interface chemistry perform differently. Therefore, the chemical and electronic properties of interface are being studied in detail and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) has proven to be an important tool in this regard. It is a surface sensitive technique that measures the binding energy of each element, which provides information about the chemical state of the element and is eventually useful for determining different defect states. One can also receive information about the composition of the elements existing on the surface by XPS. For interface investigations, the tool is commonly used to examine the elemental chemistry across the interface and the change in the atomic profile along the interface.68,213–217Fig. 14(a) shows the XPS atomic profile of CZTS with two different buffer layers, i.e., CdS and TiO2. The signals of CZTS elements from the bulk can be detected by Ar+ ion etching from the top of the buffer layer to the CZTS film after crossing the interface. The XPS atomic profile shown in Fig. 14(a) enlightens the elemental chemistry at two different interfaces. It is clearly observed that Cd from the CdS layer diffuses deeply inside the CZTS film, disturbing the CZTS elemental composition. On the other hand, CZTS bulk composition with TiO2 is quite uniform. Moreover, the signals of Cu, Zn, Sn, and S inside the TiO2 layer indicate the intermixing of elements, which is required for a good quality interface.52 It is also observed that elemental intermixing is beneficial for reducing non-radiative recombination at the interface.5,61,128 The XPS analysis of this work clearly indicates that the CZTS absorber forms different types of interfaces with different buffer layers, which consequently influence the device performance. Hence, the information obtained from XPS is highly significant for understanding the interface energetics. In addition, XPS is sensitive to the chemical shifts, i.e., a slight variation in the chemical nature of the material observed as a shift in the peak position.52,53,218,219 Chen et al. explored the impact of substrate temperature (100 °C and 200 °C) during CdS layer deposition over the interfacial phenomena.53 Using XPS depth profiling measurements, the signals of Cd 3d were recorded not only from the interface but also from the CZTSSe bulk, as shown in Fig. 14(b). For a substrate temperature of 100 °C, the core level binding energy of Cd 3d5/2 along with core level binding energies of Cu, Zn, and Sn shift to lower binding energy when the signals were recorded from the top of CdS to the bulk CZTSSe. On the other hand, the shift is barely observed in the sample with a substrate temperature of 200 °C. This disorder of elements is realized with a low substrate temperature, leading to interface dipole moments and electrostatic potential fluctuations at the CZTSSe/CdS interface. However, the inter-diffusion of elements observed at 200 °C reduces the electrostatic fluctuations and improves the heterojunction interface quality. Nisika et al. compared the interfacial chemical ambience of the CZTS/CdS interface with the CZTS/TiO2 interface using XPS depth profiling analysis.52 The Cd 3d and S 2p peaks were shifted from the CdS bulk to the CZTS bulk towards lower binding energy, which can be attributed to the change in the chemical environment. For instance, S is attached to only the Cd atom in CdS while it is bonded to three different atoms (Cu, Zn, and Sn) in CZTS. It is evident that XPS provides critical information about the elemental chemical state and inter-diffusion due to the formation of the interface. There is vast literature available wherein XPS has been employed to examine the interface chemistry and the elemental chemical state at the interface and within the material.52,128,144,213,220 Furthermore, the combination of XPS with ultra-violet/inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/IPES) provides a unique tool to evaluate the CBO at the interface, which greatly influences the charge dynamics across the heterojunction. Fig. 14(c) shows the valence band maxima (VBM) and conduction band maxima (CBM) measured by UPS and IPES for KCN-etched CZTS (KCN-CZTS), CdS/KCN-CZTS, bare CZTS, and CdS/CZTS samples along with their electronic band gap. The effect of KCN etching on the electronic structure of the CdS/CZTS heterojunction is examined in detail using XPS-UPS/IPES measurements. According to Fig. 14(d), the CdS/KCN-CZTS heterojunction provides a larger interface band gap (Eg,i = 1.58 eV) compared to the interface band gap for the CdS/CZTS heterojunction (Eg,i = 1.20 eV). Photoelectron spectroscopy proves to be highly fruitful for the evaluating the after-effects of KCN treatment. It is clearly observed that although KCN treatment has no effect on the CBO values, the interface band gap value increases significantly after KCN etching. Therefore, KCN treatment provides enhanced energetic barrier for non-radiative recombination at the interface.32 XPS, UPS, and IPES are vital tools for determining the band offsets and for probing the elemental chemistry at the interface, which is extremely critical for further improvements in the interface quality. While very versatile, the XPS analysis technique is limited by the sample size. Moreover, the XPS technique is associated with 10% relative error. The measured and the actual values may vary up to 20%, which may lead to large inadequacy in some cases. Also, Ar+ ion etching is an additional step while analyzing the elemental composition at the interface and deeper inside a material, which may cause irreparable damage to the surface depending on the fluence rate of Ar+ ion sputtering.

4.3 Morphological probing
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a widely accessed tool for studying the morphological structure of materials and for the detailed inspection of microscale objects. SEM is usually equipped with energy dispersive X-ray detectors, which are used to examine the local elemental composition of thin films. The thickness of different layers in CZTSSe solar cells can be estimated by cross-sectional SEM, which is the usual way to measure the thickness of every layer. Cross-sectional SEM/EDS is still the most common tool to investigate the CZTSSe film grain size, morphologies, and elemental composition, including other layers (buffer layer, window layer, front and back contact).11,221–226 The SEM image in Fig. 15(a) clearly depicts the compactness and grain size (greater than 1 micron) of the CZTS film. The cross-sectional SEM image provides information about crystal growth throughout the CZTS film, as shown in Fig. 15(a).11 Moreover, void formation can also be located from the cross-sectional SEM. Voids are generally found at the Mo/CZTSSe interface. Void formation inside the CZTSSe film or near the interface hinders the charge flow, thus adversely affecting the device performance.46,223,224 Cross-sectional elemental mapping also plays a very important role in understanding the grain growth and chemistry of elements inside the CZTS film or near the interface regimes, and is widely used by researchers. Unlike XPS, EDS is not surface sensitive and gives the compositional profile from the bulk region. However, performing EDS along the cross-section of the device produces important findings about the elemental composition along the interface and helps in identifying any elemental segregation over the entire device length.

To observe even finer details (single crystalline domain and lattice plain distances) about a material, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a widely used technique by the scientific community. The energy of the electron beam in TEM is higher than that in SEM; thus, the electron beam can be transmitted through the material to provide detailed information about the sample. TEM provides unique possibilities, especially when inspecting the properties of the interfaces between different layers, grain boundaries, and any other sub-nanometer scale features.222,227,228 Moreover, the compositional distribution of CZTS solar cells can be measured by the EDS mapping technique, as shown in Fig. 15(b). The STEM elemental mapping shown in Fig. 15(b) indicates the formation of a sharp interface between the CZTSSe and the CdS layer; no sign of any interfacial reaction or interfacial compound is observed during the deposition process. However, Zn(S,Se)x and SnOx phase formation is clearly observed at the back contact, which is associated with Zn and Sn segregation. The presence of voids and secondary phases at the back interface are detrimental to the CZTSSe device efficiency. Thus, the performance of devices can be explained by investigating the existence of secondary phases (ZnS, SnS, etc.) and voids by employing cross-sectional EDS mapping.229 One of the studies used high resolution TEM to compare the CZTS/CdS heterojunction, where CZTS is prepared with two different methods. Fig. 15 displays the high-resolution TEM image of the CZTS/CdS heterojunctions, where CZTS (Fig. 15(c)) was prepared by sulfurization in an S only atmosphere, while CZTS (Fig. 15(d)) was air annealed after sulfurization.59 TEM along with fast Fourier transform (FFT) closely inspects the lattice planes and diffraction dots in the bulk materials and at their interface, revealing a highly defect-induced interface compared to the bulk. However, air-annealed sulfurized CZTS film is observed to have nearly epitaxial growth with low lattice defects along the interface when CBD-deposited CdS is grown. TEM certainly has the potential to closely examine the physical properties of interfacial defects; however, the technique has not been widely used to probe the interfaces in CZTSSe solar cells. Another similar technique used to obtain information about the sample crystal structure is selected area electron diffraction (SAED). If a series of diffraction dots will appear, it indicates that the sample is single crystalline. On the other hand, if the sample is poly-crystalline, then a series of rings will be displayed.203,230 Thereby, the information delivered by TEM about the crystallite size, crystallite structure, interface defects, and preferential crystallite planes have critical importance and effects on the electron transport at the CZTS/CdS interface. Real time measurements are highly urged to draw conclusions on the effect of the composition profile on the growth chemistry.
4.4 Optical radiative or non-radiative recombination
Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy is another powerful tool that provides an insight into the understanding of radiative and non-radiative recombination exhibited at the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunctions.16,231–234 A detailed investigation of the temperature and excitation power-dependent PL measurements explains the type of recombination channel: band to band recombination (BB), band to tail recombination (BT), or band to impurity recombination (BI). Fig. 16(a) displays the PL spectra for the CZTS absorber film at various laser intensities, while Fig. 16(b) depicts the CZTS PL measurements conducted by varying the temperature range from 10 K to 180 K.12,235 In a single PL measurement, the number of transitions depends on the material properties and the measurement conditions, as shown in Fig. 16(d). These different transitions can be identified or distinguished by varying the excitation energy and temperature. The luminescence intensity increases considerably at a low temperature of ∼10 K due to a substantial increase in the ratio of radiative to non-radiative recombination rate, as per Fig. 16(b).236 Oueslati and his research group investigated the PL spectra of CZTS-based solar cells and observed the unusual optical transitions.235 The origin of low VOC observed in the CZTSe solar cells is found to be due to strong potential fluctuations present in the CZTSe material, which is revealed after PL measurements conducted at different temperature and excitation intensities. Redinger et al. examined the impact of NH4OH treatment over the CZTSe surface recombination velocity using photoluminescence imaging.237 Gershon et al. successively performed the temperature-dependent PL of the CZTS samples with different NaF thickness, demonstrating the impact of sodium on the radiative and non-radiative recombination channel, which is crucial for a device.238 It is concluded from the PL measurements that an appropriate quantity of sodium inside CZTS film effectively suppress the non-radiative recombination. Time-resolved PL (TRPL) measurements another mode of conducting PL measurements for measuring the minority carrier lifetime of CZTS. Sun et al. performed TRPL to demonstrate the effects of Cd ion soaking and post-heating treatment on the enhancement of the minority carrier lifetime, as shown in Fig. 16(c).239 Cd soaking on the CZTS surface, followed by post-heating treatment at 250 °C for 5 min, increased the minority carrier lifetime from ∼10 ns to ∼28 ns. Along with the TRPL curve decay, the PL lifetime mapping is also depicted in Fig. 16(c). Fig. 16(d) schematically illustrates how non-radiative recombination can be suspected as the major culprit of low minority carrier lifetime in CZTSSe-based solar cells.240 To inspect the root cause of performance gap between CIGSSe and CZTSSe-based devices, Gokmen et al. performed Internal Quantum Efficiency (IQE) and PL measurements over the finished CIGSSe and CZTSSe-based devices. For CIGSSe, the red shift of the PL peak from the band gap Eg (calculated using the inflection point of IQE curve, dIQE/dλ) is relatively small, while this shift is more pronounced for the CZTSSe devices, as shown in Fig. 16(e). Moreover, the PL peak for CZTSSe is broader as compared to CIGSSe. The red shifting and broadening of the PL peak can be attributed to the band gap fluctuations and electrostatic potential fluctuations (shown in Fig. 16(e)) in the CZTSSe absorber film.16 Therefore, PL measurements are an insightful tool to examine the electronic structure of a semiconductor material. Apart from that, it has been found that voltage-dependent PL in conjunction with Quasi–Fermi level splitting (QFLS) has proved to be highly fruitful in anticipating the device performance in other solar cells.241 However, such detailed and correlated study of PL that can unravel the device performance by depicting the radiative and non-radiative recombination behavior of the active material is still missing in CZTSSe solar cell technology.

4.5 Nanoscale interface and surface potential probing
Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, which include conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), have been broadly employed for measuring the nanoscale electrical properties of the CZTSSe/CdS heterojunction with a high spatial resolution.70,90,242–245Fig. 17(a) displays the topographical and surface potential images for CZTS/TiO2 and CZTS/CdS heterojunctions. The contact potential difference (CPD) measured at the interface of the absorber and the buffer layer actually defines the height of the barrier existing at the heterojunction to annihilate the recombination of electrons and holes, as shown in Fig. 17(b).52,246 Nisika et al. analyzed the electrical properties of the CZTS/TiO2 and CZTS/CdS interfaces, and observed that the CZTS/TiO2 heterojunction facilitates higher barrier to back carrier recombination at the interface due to higher CPD.52 From the KPFM examination, the depletion width and electric field distribution can be retrieved to investigate the charge dynamics at the CZTSSe/CdS interface. In Fig. 17(c), electric field distribution (blue line) is deduced by taking the first derivative of CPD and depletion width (WD) is realized for these two interfaces.52,247 Cui et al. passivated the CZTS/ZnSnO interface using a thin Al2O3 layer and performed KPFM to provide morphological and local electronic properties of the CZTS so as to detect the passivation impact. Fig. 17(d) shows the topography and CPD spatial maps in dark as well as under illumination for the reference sample and the Al2O3-passivated sample. The distribution histogram of CPD in dark displayed at the left of Fig. 17(d) indicates a narrow distribution and higher CPD for the Al2O3 sample, which results in additional band bending. Under illumination using 400 nm and 750 nm excitation wavelength laser, the light intensity versus average CPD plot clearly displayed higher CPD values for the Al2O3 sample, which suggests more effective charge separation potential at the interface induced by the Al2O3 passivation layer.180 KPFM is conducted to measure the local distribution in the surface potential and CAFM can be performed to probe charge carrier mobility of the semiconductor films. The CAFM measurements of the CZTS film reveals high current flow through the grain boundaries rather than the grain interiors, which is ascribed to the formation of the depletion region, thus leading to better charge separation at the interface of the grain and the grain boundary.248 Kaur et al. examined nanoscale current using CAFM in ref-CZTS and Ag incorporated CZTS, where high electron current was observed across the grain boundaries due to the suppression of CuZn trap states with Ag substituting copper.95 The high concentration of the CuZn trap states near the CZTS/CdS interface can cause Fermi level pinning, which results in high voltage deficit.96,98,249 SPM techniques (KPFM, CAFM, etc.) have proven to be essential and informative tools for investigating nanoscale charge dynamics in CZTSSe solar cells. An incorrect use of this tool is conducting measurements in dark conditions for a material, which is technologically important for optoelectronic applications. The information obtained in such cases can be misleading because light influences the surface states and associated surface potential, which causes band bending and affects the charge dynamics. Therefore, performing KPFM under illumination provides vital information on the actual bending of the energy bands, which is indispensable for charge transport in optoelectronic devices. In spite of all these outstanding features, the SPM technique also has few downsides. For instance, the SPM technique has poor depth of field and can measure only the surface physical properties. It also requires flat samples or samples with lower surface roughness.

4.6 Probing defect energy levels
The presence of defects or trap states and the corresponding energy levels severely affect the device performance and are decisively correlated with the photogenerated charge carrier dynamics. The capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements, admittance spectroscopy, and deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) help to realize the physics of the defects or the trap states and their density and energy level position within the band gap.250–254 These are powerful tools for the detailed inspection of defects in solar cell devices, which are responsible for causing non-radiative recombination. Fig. 18(a) shows the C–V measurement analysis conducted on Ag-graded CZTSSe solar cell to engineer the interface band bending and eliminate defects. Qi et al. conducted this electrical technique to examine the properties of the p–n junction for unsubstituted, uniformly substituted, and graded substituted CZTSSe solar cell by Ag. From Fig. 18(a), it is clearly visible that the depletion width for the Ag-graded solar cell (0.321 μm) is much higher than the unsubstituted CZTSSe (0.207 μm) solar cell. This can be attributed to the increase in band bending and the decrease in CuZn antisite defects at the CZTSSe/CdS interface.98 Compositional dependence of charge carrier dynamics for Cu-poor, Cu-stoichiometric, and Cu-rich CZTS solar cells using C–V profiling is carried out to compare their electrical properties. The CV data revealed that the Cu-poor CZTS shows comparatively low charge carrier density, i.e., 8 × 1016 cm−3, and relatively wider depletion region at the CZTS/CdS heterojunctions.255 In order to optimize the annealing temperature for the precursor CZTSSe film, Zheng and his research group performed C–V measurements on devices annealed at different temperatures. The 380 °C-treated sample exhibits the smallest surface trap density and a wider depletion width; consequently, the device achieved the highest PCE, i.e., 9.4%, compared to the other devices.256 In solar cells, the electronic states are typically divided into two broad categories: “shallow” and “deep” states. Deep states act as recombination centers that reduce the minority carrier mobility and cause Fermi level pinning in some cases deep in the energy gap. Energetically shallow states are responsible for valence (or conduction) band tail; these disorder-induced traps reduce the drift mobility. Admittance spectroscopy (AS) is performed to determine the defect energy level within the band gap of the absorber layer.254,257Fig. 18(b) displays the AS measurements for different thin film technologies (i.e., CIGSe, CZTS, and CZTSSe) over the temperature range of 90–300 K. An Arrhenius plot is used, as shown in Fig. 18(b), to determine the defect activation energy (EA). Higher value of EA corresponds to a deep level or is close to the deep level defects, while a lower EA value signifies shallower defects. The EA for CIGSe solar cells is approximately 92 meV while the value of EA for CZTS and CZTSSe is 345 meV and 153 meV, respectively, which is much higher than the EA for CIGSe. In CZTS, CuZn, VSn, CuSn-like defects, and 2CuZn + SnZn defect clusters facilitates deep-level formation.258 Therefore, first the recognition and then the treatment of defects is an important step towards high performance solar devices.

The DLTS measurements are performed to investigate the electronically active deep trap states in a semiconductor material. This technique provides valuable information regarding the type of defect (minority or majority carrier trap), trap concentration, capture cross-section, and defect activation energies.251,259–261Fig. 18(c) presents the current-mode DLTS spectra of two different CZTSSe cells, namely, cell A and cell B. For cell A, the DLTS spectra shows two peaks while there is only one peak for cell B. These peaks reciprocate the defect levels in the CZTSSe solar cells. The corresponding activation energies calculated from the Arrhenius plot are 0.12, 0.32, and 0.03 eV. In cell A, the energy level at 0.12 eV is assigned to CuZn while the energy level at 0.32 eV closely matches with the theoretically calculated CuSn antisite defects energy level. The activation energy of the trap level at 0.03 eV in cell B can be assigned to VCu as no other shallow level exists in the CZTSSe material at such a low activation energy.261 Qi et al. performed the capacitance-mode DLTS measurements on Ag-graded CZTSSe devices, as shown in Fig. 18(d).98 The capture cross-section, defect activation energy, and defect densities are evaluated from the DLTS measurements. We found that C–V admittance spectroscopy and DLTS are very critical characterization tools, which altogether not only provide the qualitative but also quantitative information about the defects. That is why there is no surprise that these tools are broadly employed to investigate defects in CZTSSe and other solar cells (Table 7).

5. Challenges and future prospects
From the discussion in the preceding sections, it can be seen that interface recombination remains the major culprit in deteriorating the VOC, thereby limiting the power conversion efficiencies of the CZTSSe solar cells. Henceforth, several approaches and experimental tools have been brought into play to combat the VOC deficit challenges. However, the presence of interfacial defects and the detailing of their influence on VOC and eventually on the CZTSSe device performance are still open issues.7,262 The efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cells has been stagnant at about 12.6% with VOC = 0.51 V, JSC = 35.2 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) = 69.8% for more than a half decade.11 On the other hand, the CIGS champion cell boasts an efficiency of 23.35% with VOC = 0.73 V, JSC = 39.6 mA cm−2, and fill factor (FF) = 80.4%.3 The comparison of the figure of merits of the two technologies reveals a large open circuit voltage difference. The CZTSSe technology has about 62% lower open circuit voltage than that of CIGS (35%) with respect to their associated band gaps. These facts urge the deployment of strategic propositions and novel characterization tools that have the strength to derive a detailed picture of the respective properties that are fed back to the device and process development for the further optimization of CZTSSe technology. The existing efforts for replacing buffer layer, introducing the passivation layer, and proposing heating treatments are hit-and-trial kind of processes, which would not lead to the bottleneck of the problem. In this concern, the focus should be laid upon the following major aspects of the interface.
(1) Applying a “toolbox” containing a combination of characterization techniques from different boundaries, relating the information from different scales and dimensions, and allowing for an insight-driven optimization,
(2) Understanding the impact of mechanical deformation (strain/stress) on the carrier transport properties across the interface,
(3) Deployment of real-time characterization tools to investigate the root cause of low efficiencies.
After more than a decade of research, CZTSSe solar cells are struggling to meet the efficiencies of its counterpart CIGS (23.35%).3 To envisage such high performance, there is an urge to focus on the integration of high-end characterization tools that can provide deep insight beyond the limited boundaries. A “toolbox” that provides vital information about different aspects at different dimensions from the nanoscale to the microscale builds a strong correlation among them to create a consolidated picture of the interface across different length scale and boundaries. We, therefore, suggest the development of the correlation of properties of different scales of interest to anticipate the desired outcomes in CZTSSe technology, as depicted in Fig. 19. Recent studies have been reported that productively relate information from one frontier to the other so as to envisage high photovoltaic performance.241 For instance, a framework involving PL–QFLS with bias dependent PL yield proves to be rewarding in anticipating the total recombination loss along the J–V curves of the solar cell.241 It provides the figure-of-merits based on the quenching factor of the PL yield from open-circuit voltage to maximum power point, which carefully quantifies the fill factor of the solar cell. Similarly, thermally-stimulated current (TSC) measurements are found to be highly beneficial in locating the trap states in the semiconducting material.263 In TSC, the photogenerated charge carriers are allowed to occupy possible trap states, which are then released from the trap states at high temperature, resulting in some current in the device. Tracing the TSC peaks at different temperatures gives a nearly accurate identification of the trap states. We believe that using TSC, the determination of the ubiquity and influence of the interfacial defects in CZTSSe solar cell will be critical. Further the identification of the physical origin of these trap states demands the integration of electron spectroscopy tools and spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation sources, which dispense very high flux X-rays, small energy band width, and tunable photon energy, so as to provide minute details about the electronic and chemical picture of the interface.264

Another important concern about the interface is the elastic disparity, which is not only governed by the lattice mismatch but also by the relaxation mechanisms during the annealing/cooling processes. Lattice distortion plays a crucial role in defining the interfacial strain, which, however, creates defects to release strain that eventually hinder the charge carrier's migration.204,265 The introduction of a stress buffer-layer can be an effective method to suppress interfacial lattice strain, leading to a more stable interface. Since the CZTSSe films are often subjected to high temperature post-annealing treatments, it may result in gradual strain variations along the thickness of the film. The strain gradient across the film thickness results in a strained CZTS/buffer interface, which eventually restricts charge transportation by causing interfacial defects.61 Recently, Chen et al. reported the enhancement of hole mobility and better device performance, which is attributed to epitaxial stabilization and strain neutralization through strain engineering in halide perovskites.204 Moreover, the interface stability in perovskite solar cells is highlighted, where a convincing correlation between the electric field, interface strain, and cell stability is developed to unravel the crucial indications for a working device's stability.266 By virtue of the captivating outcomes of strain engineering in perovskites, the research in this direction is on the front foot. Unfortunately, no such studies have been carried out in CZTSSe solar cells to date. CZTSSe, being a material with narrow phase stability and quaternary compound material, is heavily anticipated to probe the residual strain along the film and the impact of strain modulation on the interfacial properties.
Furthermore, the investigations in CZTSSe photovoltaic technology are still limited by the real time analysis. To understand the root causes of low efficiency in CZTSSe technology, there is a need for the real-time analysis of CZTSSe growth mechanisms and strategically tracing the device performance under illumination. Recently, the in situ investigation of the thermal annealing of CZTSSe in XRD and TEM revealed interesting results about cation ordering within the crystalline structure during S–Se exchange.267 More investigations, wherein the in situ characterization of interfacial properties, such as the change in the built-in electric field during illumination, can be correlated to the quantification of interfacial defects, which gives a pellucid picture of the CZTSSe/buffer interface. Interface defects rather than bulk defects are found to be more detrimental to the solar cell stability, as investigated by in situ admittance spectroscopy.266 Real-time characterizations during the interface formation should be carried out to untwist the root causes of the low efficiency and to provide insight into the relevant factors that can help in the further optimization of process development.
6. Conclusion
In this work, we have comprehensively reviewed the approaches employed to engineer the buffer/absorber interface to achieve high performance CZTSSe solar cells by mitigating the high voltage deficit. Interface engineering includes the modification of the interface by adjusting the interface chemistry through doping, etching, post-heat treatment, replacing the conventional buffer layer, and inserting some passivation layers between the absorber and the buffer. Some of the approaches, such as, Ag doping and deploying the ZTO buffer layer, have really proven to be fruitful in acquiring the efficiencies that compete the existing performance of CZTSSe solar cells. The importance of characterization tools and their role in the development of high efficiency devices is crucial. The investigation of interface chemistry unravels some significant findings, the understanding of which may secure the improvement of the interfacial properties and eliminate interface recombination. However, there is an urgent need to design a toolbox of integrated characterization tools in order to overcome the challenge of fabricating ideal interfaces.
