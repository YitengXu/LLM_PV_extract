    , Accepted 18th November 2021First published on 19th November 2021AbstractOwing to the development of highly efficient donor and non-fullerene small-molecule acceptor materials, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) has reached 17–19%. However, most of the highest-efficiency OSC devices still use a toxic halogen solvent in their device fabrication process, which dilutes their potential for scale-up production. In this study, we report a terpolymer strategy to develop donor polymers via an eco-friendly process by controlling the aggregation behavior. By introducing ethyl thiophene-3-carboxylate (ET) into the molecular structure of D18, the consequential solubility is improved significantly enough for dissolution in eco-compatible solvents, while preserving adequate aggregation. As a result, the newly developed terpolymers (PDs) can be processed with an eco-compatible solvent, o-xylene, and an OSC consisting of a PD with 10 mol% ET and Y6-BO exhibits an outstanding PCE of 15.5%, without any treatments such as additive addition, solvent vapor annealing, or thermal annealing. This excellent OSC performance is attributed to the superior charge carrier mobility, suppressed trap-assisted recombination, and substantial semi-crystalline behavior of the o-xylene processed PBET10:Y6-BO blend films. In addition, our o-xylene-based device shows a very good thermal stability of 90% retention of the initial PCE for 300 h in a 100 °C environment.
Introduction
Guaranteeing not only efficiency but also eco-compatibility is a crucial prerequisite for the commercialization of organic solar cells (OSCs) as a renewable green energy source.1–8 With the development of highly efficient donor and non-fullerene small-molecule acceptor materials, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of OSCs has recently reached 17–19%.9–16 Nonetheless, most state-of-the-art, high-performance OSCs still use toxic halogen solvents for many purposes in the device fabrication process (i.e., processing solvent, liquid additives or vapor annealing solvent).9–15 As reported previously, however, halogen materials are well known for their detrimental effects on human health and the natural environment.17,18 Moreover, in mass production, waste recovery of these hazardous solvents requires additional processes, resulting in an increase in the manufacturing cost.18,19 Therefore, to achieve commercialization of a real renewable green energy source, development of high-performance OSCs capable of eco-compatible solvent processes is urgently required.
Recently, Ding et al. reported a novel donor polymer, D18, consisting of 4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)-4-fluorothiophen-2-yl)benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene (F-BDT) and 5,8-bis(4-(2-butyloctyl)thiophen-2-yl)dithieno[3′,2′:3,4;2′′,3′′:5,6]benzo[1,2-c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (DTBT).15,20,21 This novel polymer shows considerable potential for high PCE, up to 18.22%, with distinctive aggregation behavior and crystalline characteristics. However, D18 is only soluble in hazardous halogen solvents (i.e., chloroform (CF) and chlorobenzene (CB)) and exhibits very limited solubility in eco-compatible solvents (i.e., tetrahydrofuran (THF), toluene, o-xylene, and anisole) because of its strong aggregation behavior.20 Consequently, while D18 has great potential in terms of PCE with halogen solvent, it requires a slight modification of its molecular structure to achieve its compatibilization capability along with an environmentally compatible process.
The solubility of many eco-compatible solvents for high-performance conjugated polymers is, unfortunately, less than that of halogen solvents.1,22,23 Therefore, to develop an eco-compatible solvent-soluble polymer, alleviating the aggregation behavior is inevitable. However, as excessively weak aggregation of the polymer could degrade the charge carrier mobility, crystallinity and the resulting device performance, optimization of aggregation behavior is crucial for the development of high-performance eco-compatible organic solar cells.24–26 Meanwhile, the terpolymer strategy is one of the best approaches for optimizing the aggregation behavior of existing alternative copolymers through precise molar ratio control of the third component.27–29 In particular, the introduction of an ester group-substituted thiophene as a third component has been widely employed as an efficient strategy to regulate the aggregation behavior of polymers, leading to enhanced solubility and processability.30–34 For instance, Shin et al. introduced methyl thiophene-3-carboxylate (MTC) into a temperature-dependent polymer, PNTz4T, and the resulting terpolymer exhibited enhanced solubility with mitigated aggregation; thus, the terpolymer could be processed even at room temperature.30 In addition, Hou et al. incorporated ethyl thiophene-3-carboxylate (ET) into PBDB-TF, making terpolymer T1 highly soluble in an eco-compatible solvent, THF, and resulting in an excellent PCE of 14.2%.33 Therefore, considering the above literature, we envisioned the development of a highly efficient OSC donor polymer that can be processed in eco-compatible solvent through the introduction of ET into D18 with optimized aggregation.
In this study, we synthesized and characterized a new series of donor polymers (PDs), PBET10, PBET20, and PBET50, employing F-BDT as an electron-push unit, and DTBT and ET as electron-pull units. As the content of ET increased, the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy levels of the PDs became deeper, and aggregation behaviors were gradually alleviated. As a result, in contrast to the alternative copolymer of D18, all of our terpolymers, PBET10, PBET20, and PBET50, showed significantly enhanced solubility in both halogen solvents (i.e., CF and CB) and eco-compatible solvents (i.e., THF, toluene, and o-xylene). In particular, after optimizing the molar ratio of DTBT and ET, the resulting PBET10 simultaneously exhibited high solubility and adequate aggregation characteristics in o-xylene, and the corresponding OSC exhibited a high PCE of 15.5%, without further treatment, such as additive addition (AA), thermal annealing (TA), or solvent vapor annealing (SVA) techniques. Meanwhile, PBET20 and PBET50 showed relatively low current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) with a PCE of 13%. Through an in-depth investigation, we reveal that the PBET10-based blend film has a more balanced charge mobility, suppressed recombination and more ordered semi-crystalline properties compared to PBET20 and PBET50, and we believe that this could be attributed to the optimized aggregation behavior of PBET10 in o-xylene solvent. In addition, surprisingly, the PBET10-based OSC exhibited excellent thermal stability, retaining its initial PCE up to 300 h under 100 °C conditions, revealing its promising potential as a commercialization candidate material.
Experimental
Synthesis of PDs
PDs were synthesized by following a modified method from a previous report.15 In a 50 mL one-necked round-bottom flask, F-BDT-Sn (100 μmol), one of the mixtures of DTBT-Br:ET-Br at various ratios (90 μmol:10 μmol for PBET10, 80 μmol:20 μmol for PBET20, and 50 μmol:50 μmol for PBET50), Pd2(dba)3 (2 μmol), and P(o-tol)3 (8 μmol) were added, and the flask was degassed with N2. Then, 15 mL of CB and 3 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) were added, and the flask was heated to 115 °C for 7 h. After cooling to room temperature, the polymer was precipitated in methanol (150 mL) and filtered. Sequential Soxhlet extraction was performed with methanol, acetone, hexane, and CB to remove the catalyst and oligomers. The CB fraction was condensed under reduced pressure and then re-precipitated in methanol (150 mL). The polymers were dried under vacuum for 24 h before use.

Results and discussion
We designed and synthesized a new series of PDs based on the molecular structure of D18 to develop eco-compatible donor polymers that can be processed with an eco-compatible solvent with excellent OSC performance. F-BDT was maintained at an equivalent ratio of 1, and the ratio of DTBT and ET was regulated at 0.9:0.1, 0.8:0.2, and 0.5:0.5, yielding PBET10, PBET20, and PBET50, respectively (Scheme S1†). All PDs were polymerized by the Stille coupling reaction and purified by sequential Soxhlet extraction. The resulting PDs exhibited good solubility in chlorinated solvents such as CF, CB and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB), and were even highly soluble in eco-compatible solvents such as THF, toluene, and o-xylene (Fig. S1†). The detailed procedure and 1H-NMR spectra of the monomer and PDs are provided in the ESI (Fig. S2 and S3).† To verify the actual ratio of DTBT and ET within the PDs, 1H-NMR spectra of the monomers and polymers were analyzed (Fig. S4†). Comparing the chemical shift between the monomers and PDs, we specified the characteristic peaks of DTBT and ET, located at 2.92 ppm and 4.41 ppm, respectively. With the integral value of these peaks, the actual ratios of DTBT and ET in the PDs were calculated, and the results confirmed that they were within a reasonable deviation from the feed ratio (Table 1). The molecular weights of the PDs were measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using an ODCD eluent at 80 °C. All PDs showed similar number average molecular weights (Mns) between 33.7 and 49.0 kg mol−1, minimizing the influence of molecular weight on their properties. Additionally, the thermal properties of the PDs were measured using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as shown in Fig. S5.† All PDs showed high thermal stability with a degradation temperature (Td) of over 480 °C, and no clear thermal transitions were observed in the DSC curves.

To investigate the structural conformation of the PDs, density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were performed. These calculations were simplified by using a tetramer consisting of DTBT/F-BDT/ET/F-BDT, and the 2-ethylhexyl side chains were replaced by isopropyl groups. As shown in Fig. S6,† the introduction of ET leads to substantial dihedral angles over 54° in the conjugated backbone, probably due to steric hindrance between F-BDT and ET.33,35,36 Therefore, it is expected that ET induces a large distortion of the polymer main chain, which eventually hinders the aggregation of polymers.25,37,38 This can explain the improved solubility of the PDs relative to D18. At the same time, this weakened aggregation behaviour of the PDs by ET incorporation could interrupt intermolecular interactions. Therefore, considering these two offset effects, finding the optimum ET content to maintain sufficient solubility and robust aggregation is key to this study. The optical properties of the PDs and 2,2′-((2Z,2′Z)-((12,13-bis(2-butyloctyl)-3,9-diundecyl-12,13-dihydro-[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4-e]thieno[2′′,3′′:4′,5′]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2-g]thieno[2′,3′:4,5]thieno[3,2-b]indole-2,10-diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6-difluoro-3-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1H-indene-2,1-diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6-BO) were characterized by UV-Vis absorption spectra in o-xylene solution and in the film state (Fig. S7† and 1b). Note that the UV-Vis absorption spectra of the PDs were normalized at 355 nm to clearly observe the change in the vibronic peak depending on the PDs. All PDs exhibited comparable strong absorption bands in the range of 300–650 nm in both the solution and film states. Importantly, PBET10 exhibited prominent vibronic peaks at 570–580 nm. Meanwhile, the vibronic peaks gradually decreased for PBET20 and PBET50, indicating that the aggregation behavior was apparently alleviated.39,40 To characterize the strong aggregation behavior of PBET10 in o-xylene solution in more detail, temperature dependent absorption (TDA) spectra were measured. As shown in Fig. S8,† as the temperature of the solution increases, the vibronic peaks of PBET20 and PBET50 decrease significantly. On the other hand, PBET10 maintains a vibronic peak located at 570–580 nm, even at high temperatures. That is, among the PDs, 10 mol% introduction of ET is expected to be the most advantageous, simultaneously, for solubility and aggregation behavior in o-xylene solution. The electrochemical properties of the PDs and Y6-BO were characterized using cyclic voltammetry measurements (Fig. S9†). The lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and HOMO levels of PDs were calculated to be −3.15/−5.55 eV (PBET10), −3.24/−5.57 eV (PBET20), and −3.34/−5.59 eV (PBET50), respectively (Fig. 1c). With a higher content of ET, both LUMO and HOMO energy levels of the PDs were down-shifted, presumably due to the strong electronegativity of the carboxylate group of ET. Considering the deeper HOMO levels of the PDs, the open-circuit voltage (Voc) of the corresponding OSCs is expected to be higher than that of D18.15,41

To evaluate the photovoltaic performance of the PDs, we fabricated inverted-type solar cell devices with a configuration of ITO/ZnO/photo-active layer/MoOx/Ag. Y6-BO was chosen as the small molecule acceptor because of its good solubility, suitable frontier energy levels and complementary light absorption with PDs.42 In addition, all devices with PDs were fabricated and optimized without any treatments such as AA, SVA, and TA to reduce the energy consumption caused by the additional complexity of the process. The detailed device fabrication procedure is described in the ESI.† First, to examine the photovoltaic potential of the PDs compared to that of the reported D18, we utilized CF as a processing solvent in the fabrication of OSCs (CF-OSCs). Current density–voltage (J–V) curves and detailed device parameters are presented and summarized in Fig. S10 and Table S1,† respectively. As predicted from the electrochemical properties of the PDs, the Voc values of the CF-OSCs with PBET10, PBET20, and PBET50 (0.89–0.90 V) were larger than that of D18 (0.87 V) due to the deeper HOMO energy levels of the PDs. Also, it should be noted that the current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) of PBET10 and PBET20 were comparable to those of D18 at approximately 23 mA cm−2 and 0.61–0.62, respectively. As a result, the PCEs of these CF-OSCs were found to be in the range of 12.9–13.2%. Accordingly, it is presumed that the photovoltaic potentials of PBET10 and PBET20 were comparable to that of D18.
As mentioned previously, eco-compatible device fabrication using a non-halogen solvent is a prerequisite for the commercialization of OSCs. However, highly efficient D18 is only soluble in chlorinated solvents, and the OSC fabrication process with eco-compatible solvent is inaccessible (Fig. S11†). Meanwhile, PDs were developed for processing in eco-compatible solvents. Thus, in line with the development objective, we fabricated PD-based eco-compatible OSCs employing the industrially relevant, eco-compatible solvent o-xylene as the processing solvent (Eco-OSCs). As shown in Fig. 2a and Table 2, of the three PD-based Eco-OSCs, the PBET10-based device showed the best performance, achieving a PCE of about 15.5% with a Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 25.43 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.70. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the best PCEs of eco-compatible solvent processed OSCs fabricated with the as-cast coating without AA, SVA and TA processes (Table S4†). In particular, the high FF of the PBET10-based Eco-OSC is remarkable, compared to those of PBET20 and PBET50. We speculate that this is presumably due to the high aggregation behavior of PBET10 in the o-xylene solution and the resulting substantial intermolecular interaction in the film state, as estimated by UV-Vis absorption spectra. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed and the results are shown in Fig. 2b. The PBET10-based Eco-OSC showed a higher EQE value in the range of 450–600 nm for the PD and 700–900 nm for Y6-BO compared to PBET20- and PBET50-based Eco-OSCs, indicating that both PBET10 and Y6-BO in the blend film more effectively contribute to the Jsc of the OSC. All calculated Jsc values of the PBET10-, PBET20-, and PBET50-based Eco-OSCs from the EQE spectra were consistent with all measured Jsc values within a 5% mismatch.

To study the charge transport behaviors in the PDs:Y6-BO devices, hole and electron mobilities were evaluated using the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method (Fig. S12†). The hole-only (ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PDs:Y6-BO/Au) and electron-only (ITO/ZnO/PDs:Y6-BO/Al) devices were prepared under the same fabrication conditions as the Eco-OSCs. From the SCLC method, the hole (μh) and electron (μe) mobility values of the o-xylene processed PDs:Y6-BO blend films (Eco-BHJs) of PBET10, 20 and 50 are 1.0 × 10−5/3.0 × 10−5, 3.5 × 10−6/2.3 × 10−5, and 3.2 × 10−6/3.4 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively (Table 3). In addition, the μe/μh ratio was also calculated to be 3.0 (PBET10), 6.6 (PBET20), and 10.6 (PBET50). The PBET10-based Eco-BHJ showed the most balanced μe/μh ratio of 3.0, suggesting efficient charge transport and extraction with relatively lower charge recombination loss compared to those of Eco-BHJs with PBET20 and PBET50.43 Thus, we believe that the relatively higher charge-balanced value of the PBET10-based Eco-BHJ led to better OSC device performance, especially in Jsc and FF among the three devices.

To elucidate the relationship between charge recombination and the differences in the device performance of the Eco-OSCs, the dependence of Voc and Jsc on light intensity (P) was characterized.44Fig. 3a shows the linear relationship between Voc and log(P) of the Eco-OSCs with a slope of S = 0.80–0.94 kTq−1, where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in kelvin, and q is the elementary charge. S < kTq−1 of the PD-based Eco-OSCs indicates that the dominant recombination loss mechanism of these devices is surface recombination.45,46 The PBET10:Y6-BO device showed an S value closest to unity, indicating that monomolecular recombination was most effectively suppressed.44 The S values of the Eco-OSCs with PBET20 and PBET50 gradually decreased. In contrast, the dependence of Jsc on light intensity (P) measurement, as shown in Fig. 3b, showed a similar slope (α) of 0.96, meaning that all devices have comparable levels of bimolecular recombination under short-circuit conditions. Therefore, it is assumed that the enhanced hole mobility and charge balance of the PBET10-based Eco-OSC led to reduced monomolecular recombination within the Eco-BHJ, showing relatively higher Jsc and FF values than those of PBET20 and PBET50.47,48

To explicate the differences in the electrical and photovoltaic characteristics of the Eco-BHJs depending on the PDs, their morphological properties were investigated. First, resonant soft X-ray scattering (RSoXS) measurements were performed (notably, to observe the significance of ET introduction into PDs, a sample of D18 was included). As shown in Fig. S13,† the D18-based Eco-BHJ showed a remarkable scattering peak at q = 0.008 Å−1. The D18-based Eco-BHJ film has a large domain spacing of up to 80 nm, with strong phase separation characteristics. These results are in good agreement with the strong aggregation behavior of D18, as reported in the literature.20 Meanwhile, blend films of PBET10, 20, and 50 did not show a distinct peak in the q range of 0.001–0.018 Å−1. This means that the PDs and Y6-BO were well-intermixed in the Eco-BHJs, and did not have a single component domain of at least 30–600 nm length. The high photoluminescence (PL) quenching efficiencies (95.0–96.4%) of the PBET10, 20 and 50 Eco-BHJs support this result (Fig. S14†). For better understanding of the phase separation behavior in the Eco-BHJs, atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements were performed. As shown in Fig. 4, the absolute root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of all samples was less than 1 nm, indicating that all PD-based Eco-BHJs were microscopically uniform. These results are consistent with previous results. However, interestingly, the PBET10-based film exhibited distinct fibrillar nanostructures in the AFM image. Since well-defined fibrillar structures are evidence of the ordered semi-crystalline properties of the blend film, it was expected that the PBET10-based Eco-BHJ had high crystallinity, which could be attributed to high Jsc and FF.49,50 Therefore, we performed grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) measurements to analyze molecular packing in more detail. As shown in Fig. S15 and Table S2,† all neat films of PDs showed identical (100) and (010) scattering peaks at q = 0.30 Å−1 and 1.64 Å−1, with d-spacing values of 20.94 Å and 3.83 Å along the in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) directions, respectively. Meanwhile, the coherence length (Lc) of the (010) peaks, determined using the Scherrer equation, showed the largest value of 38.15 Å for PBET10, and decreased to 23.10 Å for PBET20 and 13.54 Å for PBET50.51 Obviously, it can be confirmed that the introduction of ET helped the PDs to alleviate aggregation with improved solubility; however, at the same time, it led to a decrease in crystallinity in the film state. However, it is important that the semi-crystalline properties of PBET10 are distinct from those of the other two polymers. Additionally, the PBET10 neat film showed distinct (002) and (004) peaks at q = 0.55 Å−1 and 1.10 Å−1 along the IP direction, respectively, which originated from the strong chain extension of F-BDT/DTBT.20 Therefore, it can be inferred that PBET10 partially retains the distinctive strong semi-crystalline properties of D18. Blend films showed a similar trend to neat films. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table S3,† all Eco-BHJs exhibited analogous lamellar and π–π stacking peaks at q = 0.30 Å−1 and 1.71 Å−1, with d-spacing values of 20.94 Å and 3.67 Å, along the IP and OOP directions, respectively. Also, similar to the trend of the neat film, the PBET10-based Eco-BHJ exhibited the largest Lcs for the (100) and (010) peaks, indicating the most ordered crystallinity. This means that even when PBET10 was blended with Y6-BO, its inherent high crystallinity was well maintained. Presumably, the fibrillar structure observed in the AFM image is expected to be derived from the significant semi-crystalline properties of the PBET10-based Eco-BHJ. Combining the electrical and morphological properties, we can expect that the ordered crystallinity of PBET10 is attributed to the superior charge mobility and suppressed trap-assisted recombination of the Eco-BHJ, resulting in an improvement in Jsc and FF.52,53

Additionally, to evaluate the robustness of the morphology following the introduction of ET, the thermal stability of the PBET10-based Eco-OSC was examined. By storing the encapsulated Eco-OSC of PBET10 and CF-OSC of D18 under accelerated 100 °C test conditions, the PCE change was monitored. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 6, over 300 h storage under a 100 °C environment, the PBET10-based Eco-OSC retained approximately 90% of its initial PCE. In contrast, the CF-OSC of D18 showed a more degraded performance, retaining approximately 80% of its original PCE. It can be seen that the newly developed PBET10 and the corresponding Eco-OSC provide better morphological stability than the CF-OSC of D18. In particular, the difference was mainly derived from the burn-in loss within 20 h. Considering that the burn-in loss is closely related to the miscibility of the bulk heterojunction, the well-intermixed morphology of the Eco-BHJ of PBET10, as revealed by the RSoXS results, is expected to make a significant contribution to device stability.54,55

Conclusions
In this study, we synthesized and characterized a series of PDs, PBET10, PBET20, and PBET50. Upon introducing ET into the severely aggregated alternative copolymer D18, the PDs exhibited high solubility in eco-compatible solvents, while maintaining adequate aggregation behavior. When we fabricated Eco-OSCs based on the PDs, the photovoltaic performance was optimized in PBET10, with a PCE of 15.5% and corresponding Voc of 0.87 V, Jsc of 25.43 mA cm−2, and FF of 0.70. Importantly, this result was obtained from the device with only the as-cast coating without AA, SVA and TA processes. To elucidate the high performance of the PBET10-based Eco-OSC, electrical and morphological characterizations were performed, and it was found that the most balanced charge mobility and semi-crystalline nature of the PBET10-based Eco-BHJ contributed to the excellent Jsc and FF of the OSC. In addition, surprisingly, the PBET10-based Eco-OSC exhibited excellent thermal stability with retention of 90% of the initial PCE over 300 h under 100 °C conditions, indicating its robust morphological stability.
