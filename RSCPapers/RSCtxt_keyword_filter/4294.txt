    , Accepted 19th September 2022First published on 21st September 2022AbstractAnti-perovskites with better stability than halide perovskites demonstrate great potential as stable photovoltaic materials. In recent years, a few anti-nitride and -oxide perovskites have been designed as solar cell absorbers, however, anti-carbide perovskites have yet to be investigated for photovoltaic applications. Herein, through first-principles calculations, environmentally friendly anti-perovskite carbides M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te) with good stability are anticipated, which arise from the stable Cs4PbX6-perovskite structure. Unlike the isolated [PbX6] octahedra in Cs4PbX6, the covalent bonding feature of C–Ch bonds makes the [M6C] octahedra connected in M6CCh4 advantageous for photo-induced carrier transport. They also show low carrier effective mass (0.2m0), small exciton binding energy (30–80 meV), and strong dielectric screening, causing high carrier mobility up to 300 cm2 V−1 s−1. Among the M6CCh4 anti-perovskites, Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 with similar optoelectronic properties to MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) are screened as the best single-junction solar-cell absorbers. Their suitable direct bandgap (1.50 eV) and dipole-allowed optical transitions between band edges result in strong visible-light absorption (2 × 105 cm−1). The large simulated power conversion efficiency of 31% is implemented in Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4. The prediction of anti-carbide perovskites M6CCh4 provides a novel perspective on high-performance optoelectronic materials.
1 Introduction
Improved solar energy consumption is presently one of the most pressing scientific concerns.1 Photovoltaics is referred to as an effective method to realize sunlight utilization.2 Conventional photovoltaic materials including Si, GaAs, CdTe, and CIGS (CuIn1−xGaxSe2) have grown steadily for years, however, there are still some problems hindering their industrial development.3,4 Subsequently, several emerging solar cells, such as dye-sensitized, organic, and perovskite cells are followed into the spotlight.3 Perovskites, which have described by the chemical formula of ABX3 (A and B are different cations, and X is an anion, such as halogen ions F−, Cl−, Br−, I−, and chalcogen ions O2−, S2−, Se2−, and Te2−), are highly anticipated as multifunctional materials.5–9 Among them, organic–inorganic hybrid Pb-based halide perovskites, represented by MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3), have been used as photovoltaic semiconductor materials due to their excellent optoelectronic properties.10,11 However, Pb-toxicity and inherent instability are two important difficulties that are preventing halide perovskites from being widely used.12–14
To address these two issues in halide perovskites, researchers have proposed a significant amount of approach research. Replacing Pb with non-toxic or low-toxic elements (divalent ions Sn2+, Ge2+ and trivalent ions Sb3+, Bi3+) or constructing double perovskites A2BB′X6 (2Pb2+ → B+ + B′3+),15 is a straightforward way to reduce toxicity. Whereas, as for Pb-free perovskites, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) is 14.81% realized in the Sn-based solar cell device,16 which is significantly less than that in the Pb-based one (a record PCE of 25.7%).3 On the other hand, low-dimensional perovskites, such as two-dimensional (2D) layered ones (Ruddlesden–Popper phase, Dion–Jacobson phase, and 111 phase) and 0D ones (A+2B4+X6, A+3B3+2X9, and A+4B2+X6) are gaining popularity, because they are more stable than their 3D counterparts.17–19 Due to the large bandgap and poor carrier transport, their PCE is still lower than that of the Pb-based one.20 The most stable low-dimensional halide perovskites are 0D halide perovskites, which are made up of isolated metal-halide (B–X) octahedra. As a result, they can be used as protective layers to increase the stability of unstable 3D perovskites.21 For example, 0D Cs4PbI6 wraps 3D CsPbI3 to maintain the phase stability of CsPbI3.21 Unfortunately, there are no stable perovskite compounds that exhibit both environmental friendliness and exceptional physical capabilities.
Aside from direct atomic substitution and dimensional transmutation in perovskite fields, the formation of the electronically inverted anti-perovskites X3BA is another noteworthy material design strategy based on perovskite structures ABX3. The anti-perovskites X3BA can be obtained by reversing the ion types at the corresponding lattice sites of the halide perovskites ABX3 (A/B site: cation → anion; X site: anion → cation).22 Analogous to perovskites, anti-perovskites possess diversiform compositions and structures. They can be metals, insulators, semiconductors, or even superconductors,23 as evidenced by their diverse range of applications, such as solid electrolytes in solid-state batteries (Li- and Na-rich anti-perovskites),24 superconductors (Ni3CMg),25 superionic conductors (Li-rich anti-perovskites),26 and negative thermal expansion materials (Mn-based perovskites).27
Multifunctional anti-perovskites may offer a versatile material design platform that could be useful in the development of high-performance solar cell materials. Anti-perovskite compounds for solar applications are still in the early stages of development compared with perovskite photovoltaic materials, but they have demonstrated promise. Recently, anti-perovskite nitrides M3NX (M = Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba; X = N, P, As, Sb, Bi) have been extensively explored, and they could be used as photovoltaic cell absorbers, thermoelectric materials, and topological insulators.28 Among them, Mg(Ca)3NSb and Mg(Ca, Sr)3NP show suitable direct bandgap and high optical absorption coefficient, displaying great potential as photovoltaic absorbers.29–31 Using sputter deposition, Mg3NSb has been synthesized as a thin film.32 By using anion ordering in anti-perovskite nitrides M3NX, Han et al. designed two novel classes of quaternary anti-perovskites X6B2AA′ and X6BB′A2, and then screened five stable nitrides (Ca6N2AsSb, Ca6N2PSb, Sr6N2AsSb, Sr6N2PSb, and Ca6NPSb2) with favorable optoelectronic properties as promising photovoltaic absorber materials.33 In addition to the anti-nitride perovskites, anti-oxide perovskites with anti-Ruddlesden–Popper phases have also been investigated for photovoltaic applications. The Ba-based anti-perovskites Ba4OAs2 and Ba4OSb2 show suitable direct bandgaps of 1.1 and 1.3 eV, respectively, and fairly small charge carrier effective masses, making them potential for realizing high-performance ferroelectric photovoltaics.34 The anti-Ruddlesden–Popper phases A4OX2 (A = Ca, Sr, Ba, Eu; X = Sb, P, As, Bi) show narrow bandgaps matching with the visible light and can be applicable for ferroelectricity-driven photovoltaics.35 In anti-perovskites, the octahedral central site is commonly occupied by oxygen, nitrogen, or carbon atoms.22 Compared with the anti-nitride and -oxide perovskites, anti-carbide perovskites for photovoltaics are relatively underexplored.
In the current study, we thus focus on the anti-perovskite carbides and select a stable perovskite structure Cs4PbX6 (ref. 36) as their initial crystalline structure to ensure ambient stability. Through ion type inversion, a series of anti-perovskite carbides M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te) are predicted. They have no toxic elements and show good structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic stability. Furthermore, their electronic, optical, and transport properties have been systematically investigated within first-principles calculations. Among these anti-perovskites, Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are found to be suitable single-junction solar light absorbers with good optoelectronic properties similar to MAPbI3. This discovery is intended to address two emerging issues in Pb-based halide perovskite light absorbers, as well as open up new avenues for the development of environmentally friendly, stable, and high-performance photovoltaic materials.
2 Computational method
The first-principles calculations of the current anti-perovskite carbides M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te) are performed by the Vienna ab initio simulation package based on the density functional theory (DFT).37 The electronic exchange–correlation functional is treated on the basis of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) of Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE).38 In order to overcome the well-known bandgap underestimation in DFT-PBE, the modified Becke–Johnson (mBJ) potential is employed.39 The phonon dispersion and ab initio molecular dynamic (AIMD) simulation have been carried out to demonstrate the kinetic and thermodynamic stability of designed compounds. More details could be found in the ESI.†
3 Results and discussion
3.1 Design strategy and stability of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites
The Cs4PbX6 perovskite structure exhibits good stability and can serve as a protective layer to improve the stability of perovskite solar cells. As a result, we choose this structure in the Materials Project40 (space group: Rc) as the initial crystalline form. Through the ion type inverting, the anti-perovskite carbide M6CCh4 is obtained, as shown in Fig. 1a. The halide perovskite Cs4PbX6 has a 0D structure with isolated [PbX6]4− octahedra separated by Cs+ ions, leading to a large bandgap (>3 eV), low carrier mobility, and further poor optoelectronic properties.20 Fortunately, the designed M6CCh4 not only utilizes the stable Cs4PbX6 structure but also overcomes the shortcoming derived from the 0D structure. As illustrated in the electron localization function (ELF) of M6CCh4 (see Fig. 1b), the octahedral central carbon atom (C) also interacts with the interstitial atoms (Ch) besides octahedral vertex atoms (M). The [M6C] octahedra are not isolated but connected by C–Ch bonds, thereby C–Ch bonds can serve as bridges to assist the photo-induced carrier moving. That is, in anti-perovskite M6CCh4, the electronic dimensionality is larger than its 0D structural dimensionality,41 which is favorable for attaining the high photovoltaic performance of solar cells.

The inset is the crystal structures before (the left) and after (the right) the AIMD simulation. 
In anti-perovskites, alkaline-earth metals are widely employed as octahedral vertex ions. Herein, in M6CCh4, we chose alkaline-earth metals including Ca, Sr, and Ba as M-site elements, with Ch indicating chalcogen (S, Se, and Te) to satisfy charge conservation, as exhibited in Fig. 1a. The relaxed crystalline structures and corresponding lattice constants of M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te) are plotted in Fig. S1 and S2,† respectively. The lattice constant grows as the radius of alkaline-earth metal or chalcogen increases. The lattice constant of M6CTe4 is obviously larger than those of M6CS4 and M6CSe4, which may be related to the large radius of Te (2.21) than those of S (1.84) and Se (1.98).42 The associated X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra are calculated by using the VESTA software,43 and shown in Fig. S3† for reference.
Here, we employ the formation energy of M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te) to discuss their stability, as shown in Fig. 1c. The formation energy of M6CCh4 can be calculated by Ef = [EM6CCh4 − 6EM − EC − 4ECh]/11, where EM6CCh4 is the total energy of M6CCh4; EM, EC, and ECh are the energy of the alkaline-earth metal, carbon, and chalcogen (eV per atom) in their corresponding simple substances, respectively. It is found from Fig. 1c that the formation energies of S- and Se-based anti-perovskites are slightly different, and they are lower than those of Te-based ones. The negative formation energies of all the M6CCh4 anti-perovskites are lower than those of GaAs, MAPbI3, and CsPbI3 and comparable with that of Cs4PbI6 (stable halide perovskite).40 The results demonstrate the good stability of M6CCh4 from the perspective of the formation energy.
Furthermore, the decomposition energy is also calculated to analyse the stability of M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te) anti-perovskites. Several possible and stable decomposition products of M6CCh4 collected from the Materials Project40 and potential decomposition paths are summarized in Tables S1 and S2,† respectively. The decomposition energy can be evaluated by the difference between the total energy of all decomposition products and that of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites.44 Naturally, the positive decomposition energy will prove the stability of the anti-perovskite. There are eight decomposition paths with positive decomposition energy, including MCh2 or MCh3 as decomposition products, such as SrS3, BaS2, BaS3 and BaSe2, as shown in Table S2.† The other decomposition paths have negative decomposition energies from −0.27 to −0.07 eV per atom, which indicates that they may be difficult to be stabilized. However, it is noted from Table S2† that the estimated melting point T0 of M6CCh4 is higher than 800 K, the related decomposition paths are thus not allowed spontaneously if the temperature is lower than the melting point T0. Therefore, M6CCh4 anti-perovskites may be stable at room temperature even if their decomposition energies are negative. Moreover, we find that several experimentally synthesized compounds have negative decomposition energies. For example, the well-known halide perovskite MAPbI3 with negative decomposition energy of −0.09 eV has been synthesized by using a low-cost solution-processed fabrication technique.45 The double perovskite Cs2AgBiI6 has also been synthesized in experiments, with negative decomposition energy of −0.41 eV per formula unit along the decomposition path of 2Cs2AgBiI6 → Cs3Bi2I9 + 2AgI + CsI.46,47 Considering that the decomposition energies of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites along several paths are negative, we can expect that they may be synthesized by using some special methods, such as the common ion-exchange reaction. Their stabilization may be improved by means of the surface passivation technology.
In order to check the kinetic stability of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites, we calculate their phonon spectra at 300 K, which are obtained from the force constants using the PHONOPY package48 of the 2 × 2 × 2 M6CCh4 supercell containing 176 atoms based on the density functional perturbation theory (DFPT), as shown Fig. 1d, e and S4.†49,50 Except for Ca6CTe4, there are no imaginary modes in the whole Brillouin zone in most M6CCh4 anti-perovskites. While for Ca6CTe4, there is a negligible imaginary component at the Γ-point, but it does not have much effect on our results. An example is the 2-Pmmn borophene, which has been synthesized successfully with small negative phonon frequencies at the Γ-point in its phonon spectrum.51 The above results indicate the kinetic stability of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites.
The AIMD simulation in a constant temperature–constant volume (NVT) thermodynamic ensemble is carried out to rigorously confirm the thermodynamic stability of M6CCh4.52 The simulation cell contains 176 atoms (2 × 2 × 2 supercell) and the lattice constant is larger than 13. The initial and final temperatures are both 300 K, the simulation procedure is 3000 fs long, and the time step is 1 fs. It is observed from Fig. 1f, g and S5† that the total free energy of M6CCh4 oscillates periodically over a very small energy range via the AIMD simulation. Furthermore, there is no bond breaking or obvious structural deformation before and after simulation. Therefore, M6CCh4 anti-perovskites show good thermodynamic stability at room temperature.
As previously stated, the anti-perovskite M6CCh4 is expected to demonstrate structural stability due to its structural resemblance to the stable Cs4PbX6 structure. Indeed, the predicted M6CCh4 anti-perovskites exhibit good kinetic and thermodynamic stability at room temperature. Moreover, it is noted that several anti-perovskite carbides, such as Mg3CNi, Co3CZn, Fe3CZn, Ni3CZn, and Ti3CAl, have been synthesized experimentally through the repeated sintering, self-propagating high-temperature synthesis, mechanical alloying method, conventional powder metallurgy, solid-state reaction, one-step thermal reduction, or in situ reaction/hot-pressing route.53–55 These synthesis methods of carbides may provide insight into the synthesis of the predicted M6CCh4 anti-perovskites.
3.2 Single-junction solar-cell absorbers Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 screened in M6CCh4 anti-perovskites and their electronic properties
In order to investigate the electronic properties of M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te), we calculate their PBE band structures, as shown in Fig. S6.† They are all direct-bandgap semiconductors with the conduction band minimum (CBM) and valence band maximum (VBM) both at the Γ-point. We further use mBJ potential to revise the underestimated PBE bandgaps, and the mBJ bandgaps are labeled in Fig. S6.† Here, the spin–orbit coupling (SOC) effect is ignored because both the electronic dispersion at the band edge and the bandgap are nearly invariable whether taking the SOC effect into account or not (see Fig. S7†). We summarize the bandgaps by using PBE and mBJ of anti-perovskite M6CCh4 in Fig. 2a, where the PBE bandgap is underestimated nearly in half compared with that by mBJ. The revised mBJ bandgaps of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites are in the wide region of 1.37–1.89 eV, demonstrating their great bandgap tunability owing to the compositional flexibility. Among them, according to the Shockley–Queisser limit (SQ limit),56,57 four compounds including Ca6CSe4, Sr6CSe4, Ba6CSe4, and Ba6CTe4 have suitable bandgaps of 1.50, 1.49, 1.54, and 1.37 eV, respectively, as single-junction solar-cell absorbers. The interband optical absorption and photo-generated carrier mobility in Ca- and Sr-based anti-perovskites are superior to those in Ba-based ones, as indicated in the following sections. Therefore, only Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are regarded as the optimal single-junction photovoltaic materials.

(b) The variation of Bader partial net charges (in electron charge e for per unit cell) in Ca6CCh4 (Ch = S, Se, Te) and M6CSe4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba). (c) The ELF of Ca6CSe4. Electronic PBE band structures (mBJ bandgaps), DOS, TDMs, and partial charge densities at the CBM and VBM with the isovalue equal to 0.0015 × e−3 at the Γ-point of (d) Ca6CSe4 and (e) Sr6CSe4, respectively. 
The PBE band structures of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 in the first Brillouin zone of the hexagonal lattice using the path of M–Γ–K–M–L–H–A–Γ58 are exhibited in Fig. 2d and e, respectively. The mBJ bandgaps of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are 1.50 and 1.49 eV, respectively, close to the widely-explored photovoltaic perovskite MAPbI3 (∼1.6 eV).59,60 Both Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are direct-bandgap semiconductors with both the CBM and VBM located at the Γ-point. The energy bands around band edges are dispersive due to the hybridization between the C-p and Ca/Sr-d electronic states, as detailed below. The good band-edge dispersion is anticipated to result in efficient photo-induced carrier transport and further show potential as good solar-cell absorbers.
Although anti-perovskites have a similar crystalline structure to perovskites, the types of elements and chemical bonds are quite different. Inorganic halide perovskites (ABX3) are ionic materials mainly composed of ionic bonds.61 In the case of anti-perovskites, covalent and metallic bonds are common,22 leading to unique compositions and diversiform characteristics that differ from halide perovskites. To clarify the valence of elements in the M6CCh4 anti-perovskites, we analyze the Bader net charges of the alkaline-earth metal, chalcogen, and carbon elements in the corresponding compounds, as summarized in Table S3.† All the atoms at the M-site show up as cations, while both carbon and chalcogen atoms behave as anions. The total Bader net charge of each anti-perovskite is zero. Notably, the carbon atoms in M6CCh4 have a unique Bader charge of approximately −2. The Bader charges of alkaline-earth metals and chalcogens are +1.3 and −1.5 approximately, which are different from their usual values of +2 and −2, respectively. These findings indicate the existence of covalent characters. The ELF in Ca6CSe4 (see Fig. S8†) gives a piece of evidence for the C–Ca and C–Se covalent bonds. The C–Ca covalent bonds are within the [Ca6C] octahedra and C–Se covalent bonds connect the [Ca6C] octahedra, which is favorable for the photon-generated carrier transport. The variations of Bader charges in M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te) are also plotted in Fig. S9.† It is found that the Bader charge of each atom varies slightly when the chalcogen changes from S to Se to Te with the alkaline-earth metal unchanging; while the alkaline-earth metal changes from Ca to Sr to Ba, the variation of the Bader charge of each atom is obvious. Taking Ca6CCh4 (Ch = S, Se, Te) and M6CSe4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba) (see Fig. 2b) as examples to discuss the influence of the variation alkaline-earth metal and chalcogen on Bader charge. The alkaline-earth metal shows a relatively greater impact than the chalcogen, associated with the results of the ELF in Ca6CSe4 (see Fig. 2c), where the C–Ca bond has a stronger covalent character than the C–Se one. Although the crystal structure of M6CCh4 is derived from the 0D ionic halide perovskite Cs4PbX6, the existence of the covalent character besides the ionic interaction can improve its stability and optoelectronic performance simultaneously.
Inorganic halide perovskites (ABX3) are ionic materials, in which the CBM is contributed by B-p orbitals and the VBM is characterized by the hybridized X-p and B-s (lone-pair s-electron) orbitals.61 The M6CSe4 anti-perovskites showing covalent characters may have different element contributions from the halide perovskites. The atomic- and orbital-projected density of states (DOS) of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are exhibited in Fig. 2d and e. It is observed that the chalcogen Se has little contribution to both conduction and valence bands. The strong hybridization between the C-p and Ca/Sr-d electronic states with the large orbital overlap is observed near band edges, illustrating the covalent nature of the C–Ca/Sr bond mentioned above. Furthermore, the partial charge densities at the CBM and VBM (Γ-point) give a more intuitive presentation of the charge distribution in Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 as plotted in Fig. 2d and e. The corresponding quantitative data of Ca6CSe4 are shown in Table S4.† The VBM is dominated by C-p-orbitals (C1 and C2 atoms), Se-p-orbitals (Se1 and Se2 atoms), and Ca/Sr-d-orbitals, which is in line with the DOS near the VBM. As for the partial charge density at the CBM, it is mainly dominated by the s-states of Ca/Sr and Se atoms, different from the results reflected by the DOS around the CBM (Ca/Sr-d orbitals and Se). For seeking the reason for the huge difference, we plot the partial charge density at CB2 (an energy band position higher than CBM at the Γ-point) of Ca6CSe4, as shown in Fig. S10.† It is seen that the difference in energy level between CBM and CB2 is 0.6 eV, whereas the partial charge densities at them are entirely different. The CB2 is mainly composed of the Ca-d states, in agreement with the DOS around the CBM.
It is worth mentioning that the d-orbitals of alkaline-earth metal ions Ca and Sr participate in the crystal condensation in Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4, which is not surprising and commonly appears in a variety of alkaline-earth-metal-related anti-perovskites, such as M3NA (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; A = P, As, Sb, Bi),29,30 Ca6N2AsSb, and Ca6NPSb2.33 The ns → (n − 1)d transitions have been also observed in other alkaline-earth metal complexes.62 We take Ca6CSe4 as an example to elucidate the issue. The valence electron of Ca is 3s23p24s2. According to valence-bond theory,63 an electron of the Ca atom needs to be excited form 4s to 3d orbitals (these two orbitals are energetically close) to from Ca–C bonds, in which the excitation energy could be compensated by the energy released during the Ca–C bonding.
In addition to the potential photovoltaic materials Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4, the other seven anti-perovskites are direct-bandgap semiconductors with tunable direct bandgaps ranging from 1.37 to 1.89 eV. As shown in Fig. S6,† their band-edge dispersion is roughly similar to Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4. Although Ba6CTe4 shows weaker visible-light absorption than Ca- and Se-based ones, it has an optimal direct bandgap of 1.37 eV, which demonstrates its application possibility in photovoltaic fields. Four semiconductors including Ca6CS4, Ca6CTe4, Sr6CS4, and Sr6CTe4 have larger direct bandgaps of 1.65, 1.89, 1.72, and 1.76 eV, respectively, and strong optical absorption. Therefore, they can be the top cell of tandem solar cells.64,65
3.3 Effective carrier movement and strong dielectric screening in M6CCh4 anti-perovskites
The calculated carrier effective masses of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites are shown in Fig. 3 and Table S5,† which are approximately fitted by a quadratic relationship of the energy dispersion (see ESI†). The sharp band-edge dispersion generally signifies the small carrier effective mass. For Ca- and Sr-based anti-perovskites, the in-plane (along Γ–M and Γ–K paths) electron effective mass of 0.18–0.29m0 (m0 is the free electron mass) is small, resulting from the dispersive bands near the CBM. The corresponding hole is heavy with a large effective mass (1.29–1.97m0), connected with the flat band dispersion near the VBM. Moreover, the carrier effective mass along the Γ–M and Γ–K paths are nearly identical because of similar band-edge dispersions. The out-of-plane (along the Γ–A path) electron and hole are balanced, and their carrier effective masses (0.19–0.31m0) are small owing to dispersive electronic band edges near both the CBM and VBM. Overall, in Ca- and Sr-based anti-perovskites, the balanced and small carrier effective mass is comparable with that in MAPbI3 (0.104m0).66,67 As for the Ba-based ones, Ba6CSe4 shows small in-plane electron and out-of-plane carrier effective masses of 0.24–0.28m0 together with a large in-plane hole effective mass of 1.13–1.16m0, similar to Ca- and Sr-based anti-perovskites. In Ba6CS4 and Ba6CTe4, only the out-of-plane hole is light with a small hole effective mass of 0.36 and 0.25m0, respectively, and their other carrier effective masses are all large (0.45–1.17m0).

We use an improved method based on the Feynman polaron model (see ESI†) that differs from the well-used deformation potential theory to predict the photo-induced carrier mobility. Here, the electron–phonon coupling is taken into consideration, which is vital for the charge-carrier generation and transport.67 Using this method, the estimated room-temperature carrier mobility of MAPbI3 is 197 cm2 V−1 s−1 (ref. 67) in accordance with the experimental value of 164 cm2 V−1 s−1,68 demonstrating the feasibility and the rationality of this method for predicting the carrier mobility. Therefore, this model is employed in the carrier mobility calculation for M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te), as plotted in Fig. 3.
Several critical parameters of M6CCh4, such as the ionic screening parameter and electron–phonon coupling constant are listed in Table S5.† The ionic screening parameter can be obtained from the high-frequency (electronic) and static dielectric constants, as listed in Table S6.† These data are derived from the corresponding dielectric functions. As examples, the calculated dielectric functions of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are exhibited in Fig. S11.† It is noted that M6CCh4 has large static dielectric constants of 17–30, generating strong screening to defects and weakening the capture capability of defects to photo-induced carriers, thereby suppressing the charge trapping and recombination. This characteristic can effectively facilitate carrier movement.
One can see from Fig. 3 that the smaller the effective mass, the greater the mobility in M6CCh4. This is because the carrier mobility is inversely correlated with the carrier effective mass. The in-plane electron and out-of-plane carrier mobilities in Ca- and Sr-based anti-perovskites exceed 100 cm2 V−1 s−1, among which four materials including Ca6CSe4, Ca6CTe4, Sr6CSe4, and Sr6CTe4 show large in-plane electron and out-of-plane carrier mobilities of 195–289 cm2 V−1 s−1, comparable with that of the well-known photovoltaic semiconductor MAPbI3 (197 cm2 V−1 s−1). Considering that Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 have optimal direct bandgaps, as mentioned above, can thus be potential materials as single-junction solar absorbers. As for Ba-based anti-perovskites, Ba6CSe4 have large in-plane electron and out-of-plane carrier mobilities of 116–148 cm2 V−1 s−1 and Ba6CTe4 have large out-of-plane hole mobility of 157 cm2 V−1 s−1 due to their small carrier effective mass. Other carrier mobility in Ba-based ones is small and within the range of 11–76 cm2 V−1 s−1. The effective charge-carrier transport in M6CCh4 is correlated with the [M6C] octahedral connection through C–Ch covalent bonds, good band-edge dispersion, and strong dielectric screening.
3.4 Strong visible-light absorption of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites
It is known that semiconductors with a perovskite structure mainly composed of octahedra exhibit strong optical absorption in general. Therefore, the M6CCh4 anti-perovskites containing [M6C] octahedra are predicted to be excellent solar light absorbers. From the AM 1.5 G solar spectrum69 in Fig. 4a, the visible light accounts for the main part of the sun energy and is thus of significant concern. Fig. S12† shows that the visible-light absorption coefficient of Ca- and Sr-based anti-perovskites is larger than that of Ba-based one. The anti-perovskite M6CCh4 has large absorption coefficient in the visible-light region of 3 × 105, which is higher than that of Si (2 × 104 cm−1) and comparable with those of GaAs and MAPbI3 (2 × 105 cm−1).70,71 Considering that Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 show good direct bandgaps and transport properties, we focus on them and make a comparison between their absorption coefficient and that of several widely-explored solar-absorbers Si, GaAs, and MAPbI3 in Fig. 4a. Though the bandgaps of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are slightly larger than that of Si (indirect bandgap: 1.17 eV),72 the optical absorption in the visible region of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 is almost entirely surpasses that of Si and comparable with those of GaAs and MAPbI3.
 Fig. 4  (a) Optical absorption coefficient of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 in the visible range, and the corresponding data of photovoltaic materials Si, GaAs, and MAPbI3 are also plotted. The AM 1.5 G spectrum is given as well.69 (b) The calculated PCE of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 based on the SLME model, and those of Si, GaAs, and MAPbI3 are given for comparison. (c) The I–V and P–V curves of the 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4. Several important parameters, such as the short-circuit current density ISC, open-circuit voltage VOC, maximum current density (voltage) Im (Vm), and fill factor FF are also labeled. (d) The calculated PCE of the 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4 as a function of the solar concentration ratio X. The red dashed line represents the PCE value of the 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4 under AM 1.5 D irradiance.69 The inset shows the schematic of the concentrated solar cell, in which the Fresnel lens is used to concentrate solar energy. 
The estimated exciton binding energy of M6CCh4 by using the Wannier–Mott model73 is within 30–76 meV as listed in Table S7.† The exciton binding energies of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are 39 and 30 meV, respectively, comparable with the thermal energy (KBT ∼ 26 meV) at room temperature and that of MAPbI3 (∼50 meV).74 The low exciton binding energy of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 makes photo-generated electrons and holes dissociate easily, which is important for high-efficiency solar cells.
To clarify the underlying physics that determines strong optical absorption in the visible light, we calculate the optical transition dipole moments (TDMs) of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 shown in Fig. 2d and e. One can find that the optical transitions between the valence and conduction band edges in Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are dipole-allowed, which is desired for the efficient solar absorption. It is suitable direct band gaps and dipole-allowed optical transitions that lead to the strong visible-light absorption in Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4.
3.5 Simulated single-junction and concentrator cell efficiency of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 anti-perovskites
The PCE is a very significant indicator for a photovoltaic device. The well-known SQ limit is a landmark for the photovoltaic devices, which provide a clear relationship between the limiting PCE and bandgap together with an optimal bandgap of 1.33 eV.56,57 However, this SQ model is rough due to the ignorance of some material-dependent characters, such as the electronic property (direct/indirect bandgap), optical absorption, and transition mechanism. Subsequently, the spectroscopic limited maximum efficiency (SLME) model,75,76 an improvement of the SQ criteria, is proposed for the initial screening of optimal photovoltaic materials based on intrinsic properties including the bandgap, shape of absorption spectra, and nonradiative recombination losses. The method has been extensively applied in the PCE estimation.71,73
Given that Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 have desirable direct bandgaps of 1.50 and 1.49 eV, thus, they are taken as examples to investigate the PCE based on the SLME model. Here, the standard AM 1.5 G spectrum at 25 °C is referred to as the incident solar energy.69 The simulated PCE of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 related to the film thickness L (0–3 μm) is shown in Fig. 4b. It is observed that the PCE increases as the anti-perovskite film becomes thicker. The growth in PCE slows down when the film thickness exceeds 1 μm. The PCEs of the 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are both 31% approximately, which is higher than those of MAPbI3 (30%) and GaAs (28%).71 It is worthwhile to note that the high theoretical efficiency cannot be achieved generally in experiments. This is because several substantial losses, such as photon loss, nonradiative recombination loss, ohmic loss, etc., are not taken into account in theoretical simulations. Moreover, the electron/hole transport layer, metal electrode, and FTO glass as well as the band offset between the electron/hole transport layer and absorber are also ignored. In addition, the theoretical light source, absorption spectrum, and ideal crystalline quality are also different from the experiments.56,75,77 Considering the difference between the theoretical and experimental solar cells, we know that the simulated PCE of 31% in Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 is overestimated, but it is still comparable with that of MAPbI3 (30%) under identical simulation conditions.
The current density–voltage (I–V) and output power density-voltage (P–V) curves of the 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are exhibited in Fig. 4c and S13,† respectively. The detailed data, such as the maximum current density Im (voltage Vm), short-circuit current density ISC, open-circuit voltage VOC, and fill factor FF can be found in Table S8.† The value of Im (Vm) is close to ISC (VOC), indicating the large FF. In Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4, the radiative electron–hole recombination current fr takes the maximum of 1 because they are direct-band-gap semiconductors and the optical transition is allowed.75 The maximum fr would cause minimum reverse saturation current I0, thereby leading to the large VOC. The high ISC originates from the suitable absorption edge and the strong interband optical absorption. The large ISC, VOC, and FF jointly result in high PCE of 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4, demonstrating good sunlight utilization.
In general, the PCE can be further improved by focusing sunlight into a small area of the absorber layer using a solar concentrator such as a Fresnel lens, as shown in Fig. 4d.78 In concentrator photovoltaic systems, the concentration ratio X, usually referred to as ‘Suns’, represents how many times the solar radiation is focused. The temperature at concentrator solar cells increases with X rises. Therefore, concentrator photovoltaic absorber materials used have to be able to withstand high temperatures. Halide perovskites are commonly fabricated via feasible room-temperature spin-coating approaches, which are low-cost but lead to poor stability as well as heat resistance.12,79 Compared with halide perovskites, most synthesis methods for anti-perovskite carbides require high temperature,53–55 indicating their great potential on concentrator cells. Fig. 4d depicts the dependence of the concentration ratio X on the efficiency, which increases monotonically with the concentration ratio X in 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4. When the concentration ratio X exceeds 500 suns, the associated PCE surpasses that of the non-concentrator single-junction cell (30.83%) and continues to increase to 31.32%. Here, the AM 1.5 D solar radiation spectrum69 is used for concentrator photovoltaic devices, which lacks diffuse irradiance compared with the AM 1.5 G spectrum. As a result, the PCE under 1 sun AM 1.5 D solar irradiation (26.98%) is much smaller than that under 1 sun AM 1.5 G (30.83%). In Fig. S14,† we also discuss relationships between some crucial parameters including the short-circuit current density ISC, open-circuit voltage VOC, efficiency, as well as fill factor FF and the concentration ratio X in 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4. It is observed that ISC depends linearly on X. In addition, VOC increases logarithmically with X, leading to the FF and efficiency of the cell to increase as well. Their growth slows down when X increases over 200 suns. The PCE has a slight improvement of 3 μm-thick Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 in concentrator photovoltaic systems compared with non-concentrator single-junction solar cells.
As demonstrated above, Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are potential photovoltaic materials due to their good optoelectronic characteristics. We summarize some important key parameters of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 to compare with those of the well-known perovskite solar-cell absorber MAPbI3, as listed in Table 1. It is overall seen that the listed properties of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are similar to MAPbI3. As promising photovoltaic compounds, their great estimated PCEs are highly associated with their optimal bandgap, large visible-light absorption coefficient, and dipole-allowed optical transition between band edges. Additionally, the large dielectric constant and small exciton binding energy are beneficial to the photo-generated carrier transport. They show good band-edge dispersion resulting in small (large) carrier effective mass (mobility). Considering that the halide perovskite MAPbI3 is toxic and shows poor stability, the environmentally friendly anti-perovskite Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 would be new rising candidates in photovoltaic fields.

4 Conclusion
In conclusion, new environmentally friendly anti-perovskite carbides M6CCh4 (M = Ca, Sr, Ba; Ch = S, Se, Te) are predicted within the first-principles calculations. The initial crystal lattice of M6CCh4 is derived from the stable and ionic Cs4PbX6 perovskite, the covalent character between the carbon and alkaline-earth metal/chalcogen atoms in M6CCh4 would further strengthen its stability. The negative formation energy, favorable phonon spectrum (no imaginary modes), and small total-free-energy variation during the AIMD simulation in M6CCh4 anti-perovskites demonstrate their good ambient stability. These nine anti-perovskite carbides are all direct-band-gap semiconductors with both the CBM and VBM located at the Γ-point. Their mBJ band gaps are in the wide range of 1.37–1.89 eV. The desired band-edge electronic dispersion is caused by the strong orbital-hybridization nature, resulting in a small carrier effective mass. The strong dielectric screening owing to the large dielectric constant (17–34) and small exciton binding energy (30–76 meV) are favorable for the photo-induced carrier transport. Therefore, their estimated room-temperature carrier mobility can reach up to 300 cm2 V−1 s−1. The large visible-light absorption coefficient of 105 cm−1 can also be observed in M6CCh4 compounds closely correlated with their suitable direct energy gap and dipole-allowed band-edge optical transition. These electronic, optical, and transport properties of M6CCh4 anti-perovskites demonstrate their great potential in optoelectronic fields.
After screening, Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are regarded as the most suitable photovoltaic materials due to their excellent optoelectronic characteristics, as summarized below. (1) Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are direct-band-gap materials with suitable energy gaps of 1.50 and 1.49 eV, respectively, which are close to MAPbI3 (∼1.6 eV) and smaller than that of the stable Cs4PbX6 (>3 eV). (2) The estimated in-plane electron and out-of-plane carrier mobility is large (195–289 cm2 V−1 s−1), comparable with that of MAPbI3 (197 cm2 V−1 s−1). (3) Their strong visible-light absorption (2 × 105 cm−1) is similar to MAPbI3. (4) The solar absorber Ca6CSe4 or Sr6CSe4 shows simulated PCE of 31%, slightly higher than MAPbI3 (30%). The photovoltaic properties of Ca6CSe4 and Sr6CSe4 are similar to that of MAPbI3, moreover, they show environmental friendliness and structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic stability, indicating their suitability for photovoltaics. Our theoretical study of anti-carbide perovskites can pave a new way for designing eco-friendly and stable optoelectronic materials.
