    , Accepted 4th October 2018First published on 4th October 2018AbstractOrganic–inorganic hybrid perovskites (most notably CH3NH3PbI3) have recently been demonstrated as high-performance and low cost hybrid materials for photovoltaic application because of their prominent light-absorbing capacity and excellent optoelectronic properties. However, some serious concerns, including the potential toxicity of lead and chemical/phase instability of such hybrid perovskites, have become bottlenecks for their commercialization. In this study, through utilizing an alternative trivalent cation Sb3+ with the ns2np0 electronic configuration, we designed a new lead-free hybrid material, [tert-butylammonium]4[Sb4I16]·2H2O (1), which adopts a zero-dimensional architecture consisting of corner-sharing SbI6 octahedra. It is noteworthy that 1 shows evident light-absorbance with a narrow optical bandgap of ∼2.06 eV, along with positive temperature-dependent conductivity and notable photo-conductive response. Moreover, 1 displays phase stability under ambient conditions, which is superior to that of CH3NH3PbI3. The obtained results suggest the potential of 1 as a light absorbing material for photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
Organic–inorganic hybrid perovskites have recently emerged as a promising class of hybrid materials for optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications, such as light field-effect transistors, solar cells and light emitting diodes (LEDs).1–3 Their unique properties, including high charge-carrier mobility, long diffusion length, low-cost solution preparation, and structural flexibility for optical band gap tuning, make them highly attractive for scientific studies.4–8 Till date, over 20% power conversion efficiency has been achieved for lead-halide-based hybrid perovskites (e.g., CH3NH2PbX3, X = I, Br or Cl). However, some disadvantages of such hybrid perovskites still need to be addressed before their large-scale commercialization, namely, (i) the long-term phase instability of trihaloplumbate perovskites under the ambient atmosphere and (ii) the toxicity of lead.9–11 In this context, it is of great importance to explore new alternate halide-based perovskites with good stability and less toxicity.
To eliminate the toxicity of lead, a straightforward and effective pathway is to replace Pb with less-toxic elements, such as tin (Sn),12,13 germanium (Ge),14 copper (Cu),15 bismuth (Bi),16,17 and antimony (Sb).18,19 For example, Sn-based perovskite hybrids with a quite narrow optical band-gap could be easily synthesized under ambient conditions through a simple solution-based process, thus behaving as the potential light-absorbing materials. As exemplified by CH3NH3SnI3, its optical band-gap is found to be 1.23 eV, which is much narrower than that of CH3NH3PbI3 (Eg = ∼1.55 eV).18,20 Nevertheless, the major problem with Sn-based perovskite hybrids is their instability in ambient atmosphere and humidity because Sn2+ can be rapidly oxidized to Sn4+.21,22 Similar phase instability problem has also been observed for Ge, which also belongs to Group IV in the periodic table.23 To reduce the toxicity and phase instability, our attention was drawn to assembling new organic–inorganic hybrid materials containing bismuth (Bi) and antimony (Sb), which are beyond the Group IV metals.24,25 More recently, less toxic light absorbers have been synthesized using organic–inorganic perovskite hybrids based on Bi and/or Sb. These materials are not only more environmentally friendly, but also show long-term phase stability and remarkable optoelectronic properties.26–28 In this aspect, some Sb-based hybrids have been synthesized as potential light absorbers,29,30 such as (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9, Cs3Sb2I9 and (CH3NH3)2AgSbI6.25 Therefore, incorporation of Sb3+ into the organic–inorganic hybrids might be an effective avenue to explore light absorbers with good phase stability. From the perspective of choosing an organic cation, if all moieties were treated as rigid spheres, high dimensional (3D) hybrid perovskite AMX3 has very strict requirements for the cation size. Only a few cations, such as methylamine (CH3NH3+), formazan (HN = CHNH3+) and 3-aminopyrrole, can form a stable 3D perovskite structure. This feature possibly restricts the research progress for new hybrid perovskites. In contrast, low dimensionality overcomes this strict structure restriction, thus allowing for fabrication of substantial candidate hybrid perovskites for diverse applications.
In this study, we report a new organic–inorganic hybrid as a potential light-absorber, namely, tert-butylammonium antimony iodide dihydrate (1), which consists of zero-dimensional (0-D) inorganic frameworks and organic tert-butylammonium cations. Interestingly, 1 shows notable light-absorbing properties with a narrow optical band-gap of ∼2.06 eV. Evident photo-conductive responses were observed for 1. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the inorganic architecture dominates its optical band-gap. Moreover, crystals of 1 exhibit long-term phase stability against decomposition under ambient conditions. This outcome suggests the potential of 1 as a light-absorbing material for photoelectric applications.
Experimental section
Powder X-ray diffraction analyses
Powder X-ray diffraction measurements were performed on a Rigaku MiniFlex II diffractometer at room temperature. The phase purity of 1 was confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), which matches well with the simulated pattern deduced from the single crystal structural data.
Single-crystal X-ray crystallography
Single-crystal X-ray diffraction was performed using a Super Nova diffractiometer with Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073 Å). The structure of 1 was solved by direct methods and refined by full-matrix least-squares on F2 using SHELX-97 program 293 package.31
Ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy
Ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy measurements were recorded from 400 to 850 nm using a PerkinElmer Lambda 900 UV-vis spectrophotometer.
Other basic characterizations
Temperature-dependent conductivity was measured using a Model 6517B Electrometer with a ST-102D Probe station. Photoresponses were measured on a KEITHLEY 6517B instrument. A Netzsch STA 449C thermal analyzer was used for the thermogravimetric (TG) measurements of 1 under the nitrogen (N2) flow at a heating rate of ∼10 °C min−1.
Results and discussion
Compound 1 was synthesized by mixing antimony trioxide (Sb2O3), and tert-butylamine (with a molar ratio of 2:1) in the HI solution. Subsequently, bulk red-colour crystals were grown from a saturated aqueous solutions by temperature cooling method,32 as shown in Fig. 1a. The purity of 1 was verified by the powder XRD pattern, which coincides with the simulated pattern deduced from the single crystal structural data (Fig. S1†). It is notable that the spectrum for the powder of 1 is relatively unaltered after exposure to ambient atmosphere for 28 days (Fig. 1b), and no additional peaks appear, related to the degradation products. This result indicates that 1 should be much more stable than CH3NH3PbI3 under ambient conditions. Moreover, the thermal decomposition temperature of 1, based on thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), is ∼360 K (see Fig. S2†).

Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis reveals that compound 1 crystallizes in the triclinic space group P at 100 K. The cell parameters are a = 11.14, b = 11.79, c = 13.10 Å, α = 65.19°, β = 77.63°, γ = 89.04°, and V = 1521.69 Å3 (Table S1†). The asymmetric unit cell consists of two protonated tert-butylammonium cations, half cluster of [Sb4I16]4− and one H2O. Remarkably, the anionic part consists of the corner-sharing SbI6 octahedra, in which the central antimony (Sb) atoms are coordinated with six iodine(I) atoms (Fig. 2a). It is noteworthy that organic ammonium cation is linked to the anionic cluster via the strong N–H⋯I hydrogen-bonding interactions between the N and I atoms (Fig. 2b). N–H⋯O hydrogen bonds also exist between the organic cations and water molecule. Bond distances of Sb1–I1, Sb1–I2, Sb1–I3, Sb1–I4 and Sb1–I5 are 2.8031(8), 2.8061(9), 3.1329(12), 3.3810(10) and 2.9530(12) Å, while the values of Sb2–I3, Sb2–I4, Sb2–I5, Sb2–I6, Sb2–I7, and Sb2–I8 are 3.2281(10), 3.3378(13), 3.2066(9), 2.8109(11), 2.8761(9) and 2.8995(8) Å, respectively (Table S2†). Moreover, the bond distance between Sb1–I4 is much larger than that between other halogen–metal bonds, due to weaker bonding interaction. The angles (I–Sb–I) of 1 are in the range of 86.11(2)°–176.93(3)°, as shown in Table S3.† Such a tetra-nuclear inorganic framework of 1 is quite similar to the previously reported organic–inorganic hybrid compounds, such as [BiPc]4[Bi4I16] and [C3H9COSC2H4N(CH3)3]4[Bi4I16].33,34 Moreover, the packing structure can be described as the organic–inorganic 0D inorganic structure (see Fig. S3†).

Uv-vis absorption of 1 was measured to determine its optical bandgap according to the Kubelka–Munk function. As shown in Fig. 3a, its UV-vis optical diffuse reflectance displays a gradual absorption edge at 600 nm, and the corresponding bandgap (Eg) is estimated to be ∼2.06 eV. As far as we are aware, the estimated Eg value of 1 is slightly lower than that for the reported compounds of SbI3, (CH3NH3)3Sb2I9, and Cs3Sb2I9, for which the energy band-gaps are 2.60, 2.20, and 2.30 eV, respectively.19 The relatively small Eg value of 1 is believed to be much more favourable for the efficient light absorption process.

To support the results of our experimental study, we used the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) method to calculate the bandgap and electronic structure of 1. Fig. 3b shows that both the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) of 1 are localized at the same position in the Brillouin zone, revealing that 1 should possess the feature of direct bandgap. It was also found that the calculated band gap value of 1 was 2.13 eV, which was slightly higher than the experimental value of 2.06 eV, probably due to the limitations of the DFT method.35,36 In general, light absorbing capability of indirect-gap materials is low. In this regard, the direct bandgap property of 1 should exhibit strong light absorption. Moreover, the partial density of states (PDOS) of 1 is shown in Fig. 3c. It is noticed that the H-1s states overlap completely with the C-2s2p and N-2s2p states in the range from −25 to 10 eV, showing strong covalent interactions for C–H and N–H bonds. In addition, for the peaks observed around the Fermi level of the PDOS, strong overlap is observed between Sb-s/p and I-s/p. The valence band originates from the nonbonding orbitals of I-5p, and the Sb-s/p orbitals mainly contribute to the conduction band. This result indicates that the band-gap of hybrid maybe definitely tuned by chemical tailoring.37
To further explore the photoconductive properties of 1, we measured the temperature-dependent conductivity in the temperature range from 297 to 360 K. The positive slope of conductivity shows an exponential change with increase in temperature, as shown in Fig. 4a. The conductivity of 1 was measured to be ∼1.67 μS m−1 at 292 K, which gradually increased and extended to ∼15.17 μS m−1 at 353 K. The inset of Fig. 4a shows that the current increases gradually with the increase in temperature at a fixed voltage (10 V). Therefore, the conductivity of 1 is directly proportional to temperature variation; this behaviour is a typical feature of semiconducting compounds.38,39 In addition, we investigated the photoelectric response of 1 as a single-crystal sample. As shown in Fig. 4b, the I–V curves of the device were measured in the dark and exposed to white light illumination. It is shown that the current exhibits significant enhancement upon light illumination using a xenon lamp increasing from 0.65 nA (the dark current, 10 V) to 5.2 nA (photocurrent). Furthermore, the highly-reversible photoelectric response to light illumination is crucial for possible photo-detection. Fig. 4c shows the photocurrent of 1 during the repetitive ON/OFF switching of light illumination. In the light-off state (dark), the current was measured to be 0.59 nA, while the photocurrent increased sharply to ∼3.14 nA in the light-on state. During the multiple cycling process, the photocurrent recovers rapidly without any significant degradation. Moreover, the ON/OFF switching of photocurrent was relatively fast (∼ms), which discloses that 1 might behave as a promising photosensitive switch if used as a crystal-based detector. This result is very similar to that obtained in a previously reported study.40 As far as we are aware, such switching stability of 1 over multiple cycles will be advantageous for its potential photoelectric applications.41–43

Conclusion
In summary, we successfully synthesized a new lead-free organic–inorganic hybrid material, which consists of four protonated tert-butylammonium cations, one distinct inorganic tetra-nuclear cluster of [Sb4I16]4− and a water molecule. It is notable that 1 exhibits a narrow band-gap of ∼2.06 eV and shows long-term phase stability in the ambient air. This feature is even superior to that of CH3NH3PbI3. In addition, theoretical calculations of the electronic structure and energy gap suggest that the inorganic framework dominates the optical band-gap. This result suggests the potential of 1 as a light-absorbing material for further photoelectric applications.
