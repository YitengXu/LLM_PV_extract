    First published on 15th June 2020AbstractSelf-assembly of block copolymers (BCPs) provides a versatile strategy for controllable preparation of a broad range of functional materials with different ordered structures. In recent decades, this soft-templating strategy has been widely utilized for preparing a wide range of mesoporous materials. These porous materials have attracted tremendous interest in energy storage and conversion (ESC) applications in view of their ability to absorb, store, and interact with guest species on their exterior/interior surfaces and in the pore space. Compared with other synthetic approaches, such as template-free and hard-templating methods, BCP soft-templating protocols show great advantages in the construction of large mesopores with diameters between 10–60 nm, which are suitable for applications requiring the storage or hosting of large-sized species/molecules. In addition, this strategy shows incomparable merits in the flexible control of pore size/architecture/wall thickness, which determines the final performance of mesoporous materials in ESC devices. In the last decade, rapid development has been witnessed in the area of BCP-templated mesoporous materials. In this review paper, we overview the progress of this field over the past 10 years, with an emphasis on the discussions of synthetic methodologies, the control of materials structures (including morphology and pore size/shape), and potential applications particularly in rechargeable batteries, supercapacitors, electro-/photocatalysis, solar cells, etc.

1. Introduction
In recent years, serious energy and environmental problems have prompted the development of green and efficient energy storage and conversion (ESC) systems. Extensive effort has been devoted to developing functional electrode materials with high performance for ESC devices.1–3 Porous materials, in particular mesoporous solids, have attracted enormous interest in numerous energy-related applications owing to their ability to absorb, store, and interact with guest species on their exterior/interior surfaces and in the pore space.4–6 The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has defined the pore dimension of mesoporous materials to be in the range of 2–50 nm.2,5 Inspired by the first synthesis of mesoporous silica in the 1990s, a diverse range of mesoporous materials involving a broad range of compositions have been developed thus far, including carbons, metallic compounds, noble metals, and their hybrids. These materials are appealing candidates for ESC applications due to their high electrochemical or catalytic activity and will be the main focus of this review.
Mesoporous materials possess a number of intrinsic properties, including high specific surface area (SSA), large pore volume, tunable pore size and shape. In many energy applications, especially with surface or interface-related processes (e.g., adsorption, catalysis and energy storage), high surface area materials are desired because they can provide a large number of active sites.2,5,6 Furthermore, the large pore volume of mesoporous materials is advantageous for achieving a high loading of guest species and for accommodating volume expansion and strain relaxation during repeated charge/discharge processes in energy storage devices. Pore size and structure significantly affect mass transport inside porous materials. For example, large mesopores allow for increased accessibility to the active sites as well as better accommodation and transport of large-sized species compared to microporous materials (pore size <2 nm).7,8 In addition, different pore structures, such as spherical,9–11 cylindrical,12,13 or bicontinuous pores,14–16 result in different mass transport modes in the interiors of materials, thus affecting the effective surface area and the amount of accessible active sites. Therefore, achieving a balanced control of pore size and architecture is essential for optimizing the effective surface area and pore volume of mesoporous materials, both of which are highly crucial in determining their performance in ESC devices.
To date, various synthetic protocols have been developed for synthesizing mesoporous materials, including template-free,17–19 hard-templating,20–22 and soft-templating approaches.1,23,24 Generally speaking, these approaches all have their own unique advantages. Template-free methods usually involve the chemical connection or aggregation of nanoscale building blocks. For example, reticular chemistry broadens the spectrum of mesoporous materials by creating metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)25–27 and covalent organic frameworks (COFs)28–30 through molecular building blocks (such as organic molecules and inorganic clusters). However, template-free strategies typically suffer from difficulties in tailoring the morphology and pore structures of the resulting mesoporous materials.2,31,32 Hard-templating methods (also known as nanocasting) usually employ pre-formed rigid mesoporous materials, such as silica, carbon, or colloidal crystals, as hard templates.20,33,34 Benefiting from some hard templates that can offer enhanced structural stability at high temperatures, this method facilitates the preparation of highly crystalline or even single-crystalline mesoporous materials. Nevertheless, this approach suffers from tedious multi-step procedures for removing the template and the utilization of corrosive agents, which impede the massive production of mesoporous materials by this method.33–35 In contrast, soft templates generally refer to “soft” molecules, including small-molecule surfactants and block copolymers (BCPs). As these soft molecules can self-assemble into a wide variety of ordered nanostructures, the soft-templating strategy shows great advantages in determining the pore shape or size. Moreover, the soft molecules can be easily dissolved in common solvents, including water, and can be pyrolyzed at high temperatures under inert atmosphere. These features enable the facile removal of the soft templates. Compared with small-molecule surfactants, BCPs have several additional merits as pore-forming agents. First, the morphological control of BCP assemblies is more flexible as the properties of BCPs, such as compositions, molecular weights, and volume fractions, can be controlled to adjust their packing parameters (p),36–38 which offers the possibility of creating porous materials with a broader range of pore architectures. Second, low-molecular weight surfactants usually lead to the formation of mesoporous materials with small mesopores (usually 4–6 nm) due to their short hydrophobic chains,23 while high molar mass BCPs afford the possibilities of synthesizing mesoporous materials with large pore sizes (10–60 nm) and thick pore walls, which are suitable for applications requiring the storage or hosting of large-sized species/molecules.23,39,40 Third, the hydrophobic blocks of most BCPs consist of sp- or sp2-carbon atoms, which can be in situ carbonized to residual carbons and thus support the formation or crystallization of pore walls during high-temperature treatment under inert atmosphere.1,41–43
In light of the exceptional advantages of BCP self-assembly in the synthesis of mesoporous materials as well as the extensive interest and the high level of activity of this area, this review article describes the recent progress in the field of mesoporous materials over the past 10 years. Different from existing review articles,2,40,43–45 this paper is more comprehensive. It not only introduces the key principles of BCP self-assembly in the bulk and in solution, providing essential guidance for the construction of mesoporous materials, but also covers all the prevalent and newly emerging synthetic strategies, including bulk self-assembly, solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly (EISA), nanoprecipitation, interfacial self-assembly, and emulsion-templating self-assembly. In particular, the control of the morphology and pore geometry/size of mesoporous materials and its necessity in different ESC systems are discussed, which may help to understand the advantages of the BCP self-assembly-guided synthetic strategies. Following the introduction, the second section introduces the basic principles of the self-assembly of BCPs in the bulk and in solution. The third section discusses the synthetic strategies towards mesoporous materials, including their principles, advantages and disadvantages. The fourth section covers the potential applications of mesoporous materials in various ESC systems, including secondary batteries, supercapacitors, electro- or photo-catalysis, and solar cells. In this section, the advantages and disadvantages of mesopores as well as the effect of their sizes/shapes on the functional performance of ESC devices are also described. The final section presents the summary and future outlook on the development of this area.
2. Self-assembly of block copolymers
In general, the self-assembly of BCPs can occur both in the bulk46–48 and in solution.36,37,49–53 Taking diblock copolymers as an example, bulk BCPs with immiscible blocks can separate into microphases with various morphologies, including spheres (S), cylinders (C), bicontinuous structures (G), lamellae (L), etc., as shown in Fig. 1.46,54,55 The morphology is mainly dependent on three parameters:46,56 (1) χAB, namely, the Flory–Huggins parameter that expresses the degree of incompatibility between the two different blocks; (2) the total degree of polymerization (N = NA + NB), and (3) the volume fractions of A and B blocks (fA and fB, fA + fB = 1). The degree of microphase separation of diblock copolymers is determined by the segregation product, χN. With increasing fA at a fixed χN above 10.5 (critical order-to-disorder transition point), the order-to-order transition (OOT) of BCPs occurs from closely packed spheres (CPS), going through body-centered cubic spheres (S), hexagonally packed cylinders (C) and bicontinuous gyroids (G), to lamellae (L). With the copolymer composition inverted, morphological inversion takes place following the order L–G′–C′–S′–CPS′-disordered. The morphological phase diagram has been verified experimentally by many diblock copolymers in the bulk, e.g. polyisoprene-block-polystyrene (PI-b-PS).54 For multiblock copolymers, the level of complexity for their phase separation increases with the increase in the number of blocks. For example, theoretical simulation has predicted the existence of 30 different morphologies for phase separation of ABC triblock copolymers and many of them have been obtained experimentally.57,58 A lot of these ordered structures are different from those formed by diblock copolymers, which provide opportunities for creation of novel mesoporous materials.23,59–61

The self-assembly of amphiphilic BCPs in aqueous solutions is one of the most widely used template-based strategies for synthesizing mesoporous materials.1,23,24,59 The hydrophobic interaction of the hydrophobic blocks drives the aggregation of amphiphilic BCP chains. The formed aggregates are protected by hydrophilic coronae in aqueous solutions, which reduce the contact of the hydrophobic block with water, thus minimizing the system energy. The aggregates mainly include spherical micelles, cylindrical micelles, bicontinuous structures, lamellae, vesicles, and their inverse structures, etc. (Fig. 2).37,62 Their final morphologies are determined by the packing parameter, p = v/a0lc, where v and lc represent the volume and length of the hydrophobic segment, respectively, while a0 denotes the contact area of the hydrophilic block.36,37,63,64 Generally, When p < 1/3, spherical micelles or spheres with face-centered cubic (fcc) and body-centered cubic (bcc) packing modes can be formed, depending on the adopted self-assembly approach; if 1/3 < p < 1/2, cylindrical micelles or hexagonally packed cylinders (Hex) can be formed; when 1/2 < p < 1, vesicles or modulated lamellae; when p = 1, planar bilayers or multi-layered lamellae; if p > 1, minimal surfaces (G, D, and P surfaces) or inverse Hex, fcc, and bcc structures can be formed. The general principle for the morphological transition can be simply explained by the classical cone-column geometric change mechanism, as illustrated in Fig. 2,36,37,63 which is also applicable to microphase separation of BCPs in the bulk. The packing parameter is affected by a number of factors, including the polymer composition and concentration, nature of the solvent, water content, addition of additives, and so on.37,65–69 The adjustments of these influencing factors afford flexible control over the morphology and dimension of BCP aggregates. In general, the preparation of mesoporous materials templated by BCP aggregates requires the cooperative self-assembly of BCPs and specific precursors that may form the pore walls in solutions, followed by cross-linking or polymerization of the precursors.1,23,70 During self-assembly, the effects of the added precursors on the morphology of the resulting aggregates and the resulting pore architectures primarily originate from the variations in the interactions among corona chains in the presence of the precursors. Although the co-self-assembly systems are more complicated, the principle of the morphological control is analogous to that of the solo self-assembly of BCPs.1,23,71 For most mesoporous materials, their pores are templated by the hydrophobic domains in the self-assembled structures, in which the length (lc) of the hydrophobic block of the copolymer chain is approximately equal to lN1/2 (Fig. 2),9,46,72 where l represents the length of one repeat unit and N is the number of repeating units; thus, the dimensions of the created mesopores are nearly proportional to lN1/2.

3. Synthetic strategies
In 1997, Wiesner's group synthesized mesoporous aluminosilicates with pore sizes of 10–50 nm, by employing high-molar-mass polyisoprene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PI-b-PEO) diblock copolymers as structure-guiding agents.39 In 1998, Zhao et al. prepared ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15) with large pore sizes of 4–12 nm in solution, employing commercial triblock poly(ethylene oxide)–poly(propylene oxide)–poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO–PPO–PEO) copolymers as soft templates.73 These pioneering studies opened up avenues for the synthesis of mesoporous materials with large-sized pores, which have been explored in energy, catalysis, and separation applications, especially those involving large molecules.2,23,39,74 These studies also inspired the wide utilization of BCPs, including Pluronic (commercial PEO–PPO–PEO series including P123, F127, F108, etc.)61,75–77 and non-Pluronic families, for preparing mesoporous materials.2,40,78,79 Compared to the Pluronic copolymers, non-Pluronic BCPs generally consist of hydrophilic blocks, such as poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(2-vinylpyridine) (P2VP) or poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP), and hydrophobic blocks including polystyrene (PS), polyisoprene (PI), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN), among others. The merits of these non-Pluronic copolymers include their lower oxygen and higher carbon contents as well as higher glass transition temperatures (Tg) and better thermal stability.23 Moreover, these copolymers are typically laboratory-made through controllable living polymerization methodologies, such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)80–82 and reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT).83–85 Hence, the compositions, volume fractions, and molar masses of the composing blocks can be readily controlled, which makes the non-Pluronic BCPs desirable templates for the construction of mesoporous materials with tunable pore size/architecture/wall thickness/composition. To date, a number of powerful synthetic strategies based on the self-assembly of BCPs have been developed, which mainly include bulk self-assembly, EISA, solution-based nanoprecipitation, interfacial self-assembly, and emulsion-templating self-assembly. In the following subsections, these strategies will be introduced in detail; their accessible materials and structures, and advantages and disadvantages are summarized in Table 1.

3.1 Bulk self-assembly
The phase separation of BCPs in the bulk is mostly applied for preparing mesoporous carbon materials. In the bulk, the self-assembly of BCPs usually takes place with heating and annealing of the polymers at temperatures higher than their Tgs, which enable the microphase separation of the BCPs into ordered morphologies.37,54 Then, the resulting ordered morphologies can be quenched at temperatures much lower than Tg. Subsequently, mesoporous carbons can be obtained by pyrolysis of the BCPs with ordered microphases at high temperatures (generally 800–1000 °C) under inert atmosphere. In this method, the BCP precursors require a carbon-rich block (usually containing sp or sp2-hybridized carbon atoms), which can form continuous domains after the phase separation.86 For example, Matyjaszewski and coworkers reported a one-pot approach towards mesoporous nitrogen-doped carbons via the pyrolysis of polyacrylonitrile-block-poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PAN128-b-PBA76, the subscript numbers denote the degrees of polymerization of the blocks).87 First, the PAN128-b-PBA76 copolymer was annealed at 280 °C in air, which led to the nanophase separation of the copolymer and cyclization of PAN side chains. Subsequently, the pyrolysis of this polymer at 500–800 °C under inert atmosphere resulted in the carbonization of the PAN domain and the removal of the PBA block, thereby generating mesoporous N-doped carbon (Fig. 3a).87 The mesopore size of the resulting porous carbon increased with an increase in the length of the pore-forming PBA block (Fig. 3b).88 On the other hand, the pore connectivity was reduced with a decrease in the molar mass of the copolymers, which was attributed to the weaker phase segregation between the blocks of shorter lengths (Fig. 3c).56 On the basis of similar principles, a variety of mesoporous carbon materials with spherical and cylindrical pore structures have been prepared by using other BCPs containing PAN blocks as soft templates, such as PAN-b-poly-(methyl methacrylate) (PAN-b-PMMA),89–93 PAN-b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PAN-b-PtBA),94 and PAN-b-polystyrene (PAN-b-PS).95

3.2 Solvent evaporation-induced self-assembly
EISA is a versatile strategy towards a diversity of mesoporous materials in addition to carbons. The EISA protocol is based on the cooperative self-assembly of BCPs and specific precursors that can form the pore walls in the process of solvent evaporation, as illustrated in Fig. 4.23,40,96 Typically, in solutions, BCP chains interact with the soluble precursors via intermolecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. During the solvent evaporation, the cooperative self-assembly of the precursors (e.g., carbon sources or metal alkoxides) with BCPs generates a microphase separation. Then, a continuous network is formed by condensation or cross-linking of the precursors. These reactions may happen simultaneously or after the self-assembly process. Finally, the BCP template can be removed by calcination or solvent extraction, producing a mesoporous architecture. As the mesopores and walls are templated by the different blocks of BCPs, the pore dimension and wall thickness can be simply regulated by modifying the block lengths of the sacrificial BCPs.
 Fig. 4  Scheme illustration of a typical EISA process for the synthesis of mesoporous materials using BCPs as the soft template. 
In 1994, Ogawa et al. first demonstrated the preparation of silica–surfactant composite films by EISA,97 in which an aqueous mixture solution of alkyltrimethylammonium bromide and tetramethoxysilane was spin-coated on a glass substrate and dried in air at 100 °C to remove the solvent and to promote condensation of the silica. As a result, thin films with ordered phase structures were formed on the substrates. This work first demonstrated the feasibility of the EISA method for preparing ordered mesophases.97 Afterwards, Brinker and co-workers synthesized ordered mesoporous silica by the EISA method.98 They evaporated the precursor solutions, which were prepared by adding a cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), to an ethanol solution containing polymeric silica sols and tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS). Following calcination, continuous silica films with cubic and hexagonal mesoporous structures were obtained.98 Although low-molecular-weight surfactants can be used to prepare ordered mesoporous materials, the resulting pore size is usually small and limited in the range of 2–8 nm. In 1997, Wiesner's group prepared mesoporous ceramics by using high-molecular-weight lab-made BCPs as soft templates (Fig. 5).39 They employed PI-b-PEO diblock copolymers along with inorganic precursors including 3-glycidyloxypropyl-trimethoxysilane (GLPMO) and aluminum sec-butoxide (Al(OBus)3), which were first dissolved in a 1:1 mixed solvent of chloroform and tetrahydrofuran (THF). The subsequent solvent evaporation and calcination produced mesoporous aluminosilicates with cylindrical or lamellar morphology depending on the weight ratio of the inorganic precursors to BCP. The pore sizes were adjustable in the window of 10–50 nm by tailoring the molar mass of PI-b-PEO between 10000 and 100000 g mol−1.39
 Fig. 5  Historical development of mesoporous materials synthesized by the EISA method using different BCPs as the structure-directing agents. 
After the achievements in mesoporous ceramics, in 1998 Yang et al. extended the BCP-templated method to the synthesis of mesoporous metal oxides.75 They employed Pluronic P123 as pore-forming agents in non-aqueous solutions containing inorganic metal chlorides as the metal precursors (Fig. 5). A library of ordered mesoporous metal oxides (TiO2, ZrO2, Al2O3, Nb2O5, TaO5, WO3 and SnO2) and mixed oxides (SiAlO3.5, SiTiO4, ZrTiO4, Al2TiO5, and ZrW2O8) were synthesized (Fig. 5).75 Although these metal oxides with large pore sizes (up to 14 nm) could be obtained in their study, the resulting metal oxides were mostly amorphous with poorly-crystallized walls.75 In order to overcome this limitation, Wiesner and co-workers developed a facile EISA method based on combined self-assembly by soft and hard chemistries, simply referred to as “CASH”, in 2008.41 They applied PI-b-PEO copolymers with PI blocks containing sp2-hybridized carbons as the pore-forming agents (Fig. 5). During the heating process, the sp2 carbons of the PI blocks (soft) were converted to sturdy, amorphous carbons (as hard templates) under inert environment, which could prevent the collapse of the mesoporous structure during the high-temperature crystallization. Through the CASH method, mesoporous TiO2 and Nb2O5 with highly crystalline walls were synthesized.41 In 2003, Zhao and co-workers extended the fabrication of mesoporous materials to multicomponent mesostructured minerals by introducing an “acid–base pairs” concept, which addressed the effect of the inorganic–inorganic interplay on the preparation of mesoporous materials (Fig. 5).99 They classified various metallic and non-metallic sources in terms of their relative acidity and alkalinity on solvation. Using suitable pairs, the pH of the system can be self-adjusted without the addition of extra reagents. This work provided a new principle to regulate the hydrolysis rate of metallic/non-metallic precursors, which gave birth to several new types of mesoporous materials, including mixed metal oxides, metal phosphates, and metal borates.99
Apart from inorganic materials, organic mesostructures and carbon materials can be synthesized by EISA based on organic–organic self-assembly. In 2004, Dai and colleagues first prepared ordered mesoporous carbon materials by using polystyrene-b-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) as the structure-guiding agent and resorcinol–formaldehyde as the carbon-rich source (Fig. 5).100 The PS-b-P4VP copolymer and resorcinol monomers co-assembled into an ordered structure by annealing at 80 °C in N,N′-dimethylformamide (DMF)/benzene mixed vapor. Then, the nanostructure was stabilized via in situ polymerization of the resorcinol monomers by treatment of formaldehyde gas. The subsequent pyrolysis of the polymeric film under inert atmosphere generated a hexagonal carbon-channel array.100 Later, Zhao's group extended the organic carbon precursors to low-molecular-weight phenolic resins (resol), which could be polymerized at low temperatures without using formaldehyde gas.101 Nowadays, resol has become one of the most commonly used carbon precursors for the preparation of porous carbon materials.
After carbon-based materials, the EISA strategy was successfully applied for the synthesis of mesoporous metals. Wiesner and colleagues first reported the preparation of porous platinum mesostructures using platinum-rich nanoparticles (NPs) stabilized with ionic liquid ligands as the platinum precursor and PI-b-poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PI-b-PDMAEMA) as the structure-directing agent (Fig. 5).78 They dissolved the ligand-stabilized platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and the BCPs in a chloroform/methanol mixture. The resulting solution was evaporated slowly to generate a metal-rich mesostructured PtNP–BCP hybrid. Then, the Pt–C composite was obtained by heating this hybrid under inert atmosphere. Finally, the carbon domains in the materials were removed by Ar–O plasma or acid-etching, yielding ordered mesoporous platinum with lamellar or inverse hexagonal mesostructures.78 In addition to metal-rich NPs as the metal precursors, inorganic metal salts can be an alternative. Yamauchi and co-workers constructed a mesoporous platinum framework consisting of connected NPs using polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-b-PEO) as the soft template (Fig. 5).102 They drop-coated a THF solution of PS37-b-PEO110 and hydrogen hexachloroplatinate(IV) hexahydrate (H2PtCl6·6H2O) onto an indium tin oxide substrate. After THF evaporation, the obtained yellow film was placed in a three-electrode system for electrochemical deposition of Pt. The BCP template was eliminated by repeated washing with organic solvents, producing mesoporous Pt with closely-connected giant mesocages.102
In general, the EISA method is not applicable to water-containing systems and the resulting materials typically have a film-like morphology. Deng et al. established a solvent evaporation-induced aggregating assembly (EIAA) approach, by which mesoporous materials of various morphologies can be obtained in aqueous solutions (Fig. 6).103–106 For instance, they utilized poly(methyl methacrylate)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PMMA174-b-PEO125) as the pore-forming agent and TEOS as the silica precursor in an acidic THF–H2O mixture.103 During the evaporation of THF, the self-assembly process occurred at the liquid–liquid interface and granular SiO2/PMMA-b-PEO composites with crystal-like morphology were formed. Following calcination, SiO2 particles with face centered cubic (fcc) mesostructures and large pore dimensions (up to 37 nm) were achieved.103 Different from the EISA method, in which an ordered mesostructure is formed at the substrate–liquid interface at the final stage of solvent evaporation,107 the self-assembly process of EIAA occurs in the solution at an early stage. In this way, the EIAA method facilitates the construction of mesoporous materials with variety of architectures, such as particle, sphere or rod-like morphology. Later, they extended the EIAA concept to carbon materials and they obtained ordered mesoporous carbon nanofibers with cylindrical pores.40

In principle, EISA and EIAA are similar to the self-assembly of BCPs in the bulk, as the slow evaporation of the volatile solvent drives the aggregation of the BCPs or their aggregates to closely pack into various ordered morphologies, depending on the packing parameters.23,37 By virtue of the microphase separation mechanism of BCPs, EISA and EIAA are powerful strategies for preparing mesoporous materials with various well-defined pore structures, including closely-packed spherical pores, hexagonally packed cylindrical pores, bicontinuous structures, etc. The remainder of this subsection concentrates on the discussions of pore structure engineering.

3.2.1 Spherical pore structures. 
In the EISA process, BCPs and precursors can microphase separate into closely-packed spheres with appropriate packing parameters (p < 1/3) after solvent evaporation, including disordered packing, face centered cubic (fcc) (space group Fmm), body centered cubic (bcc) (space group Imm), and 3D hexagonally packed structures (space group P63/mmc),37,107 which have been the most common structures achieved thus far. These structures can be solidified by the cross-linking of the precursors and converted to mesoporous materials by removing the BCPs during the solvent extraction process or through high-temperature pyrolysis. Mesoporous materials with spherical pores, which have been reported in the past 10 years, are summarized in Table 2,42,108–119 while those reported prior to 2010 have been covered by several related review articles.1,23,61,70,107

The disordered pore structure lacks a long-range ordered structure. However, the utilization of BCPs as soft templates can enable the attainment of uniform pore sizes and high SSAs. Furthermore, the pore size can be tuned by changing the molar mass of BCPs. For example, mesoporous TiO2 with randomly packed spherical mesopores was synthesized using a poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polybutadiene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-b-PB-b-PEO) triblock copolymer and TiCl4 (titania precursor) in an ethanol–water mixed solution.120 Mesoporous TiO2 films were prepared by dip-coating the precursor solutions onto Si substrates. After solvent evaporation, the films were dried at 80 °C and subsequently calcined at 475 °C to remove the BCP template. The pore dimension of the resulting mesoporous TiO2 film could be tailored by varying the molar mass of the copolymer with a constant PB/PEO weight ratio. The obtained TiO2 displayed a randomly packed spherical pore structure with pore sizes in the range of 7.6–16.6 nm and SSAs of 85–328 m2 g−1.120 In addition to this report, a number of other mesoporous materials with randomly packed spherical pores have also been prepared in the last decade, including TiO2,121–123 Al-doped TiO2,124 Nd-doped TiO2,125 TiO2/carbon,126 IrO2,127 FePO4,128 NiFe2O4,129 N-doped carbon,96 LiFeO4/carbon,130etc., using PS-b-poly(acrylic acid) (PS-b-PAA),96 PI-b-PEO,124–126,130 PS-b-PEO,121 and PS-b-poly(2-vinylpyridine)-b-PEO (PS-b-P2VP-b-PEO)122,128,129 as soft templates.
The fcc structure is a common feature of ordered closely-packed spherical pore architecture, which has a Fmm space group. The preparation of ordered pore structures, which requires an ordered packing of BCP/precursor composite micelles during EISA, needs delicate control and thus, is more difficult than the fabrication of disordered pore structures. A major difficulty lies in the control of the hydrolysis and condensation of precursors.23,40,99 To overcome this difficulty, a number of approaches have been developed.75,99,131 Zhao and co-workers established an effective ligand-assisted method to synthesize ordered mesoporous oxide materials. For instance, they employed PS-b-PEO diblock copolymer and tungsten chloride (WCl6) as the soft template and tungsten precursor, respectively, with the assistance of acetylacetone to slow down the hydrolysis and condensation of the tungsten precursor (Fig. 7a).116 When a THF solution of PS-b-PEO was mixed with an ethanolic solution of WCl6 and acetylacetone (AcAc), WCl6−x(AcAc)x compounds were formed owing to the strong coordination of AcAc with W6+ ions, which slowed down the hydrolysis process. Following evaporation of the solvent, mesoporous WO3 with an ordered Fmm symmetry was achieved (Fig. 7b and c). The porosity could be tailored by changing the PS block length. The resulting mesoporous WO3 materials exhibited tunable pore diameters in the range of 10.6–15.3 nm, pore volumes of 0.13–0.17 cm3 g−1, and SSAs of 76–136 m2 g−1.116 Other typical mesoporous materials with the fcc structure are also summarized in Table 2.

When the proportion of the hydrophobic block increases, the interface curvature of the micelles will reduce, resulting in mesophase transformation from fcc to a looser packing mode, namely the bcc structure, which is another common type of ordered spherical pore architecture.107,132Table 2 lists some representative mesoporous materials with bcc mesostructures, which were reported in the last decade. For instance, Wei et al. fabricated N-doped mesoporous carbon using dicyandiamide and resol as the carbon sources and Pluronic F127 as the structure-templating agent.112 The resulting carbon materials showed an ordered bcc mesoporous structure with an Imm symmetry (q2 ratio: 1:2:3). By altering the mass ratio of dicyandiamide to resol, the mesoporous carbons showed tunable pore sizes of 3.9–17.6 nm, pore volume of 0.27–0.47 cm3 g−1, and SSAs of 500–548 m2 g−1.112
In addition to fcc and bcc mesostructures, many mesoporous materials exhibit 3D hexagonal mesostructures, in which spherical pores are hexagonally arranged with a P63/mmc space group (Fig. 7d). For example, Deng et al. prepared ordered SnO2 materials with hexagonal mesostructures using PS-b-PEO as the template and SnCl4 as the tin oxide precursor.118 They employed acetylacetone as a chelating agent of SnCl4 in order to slow the aggregation of SnO2 nanoclusters formed by the initial hydrolysis of SnCl4. The obtained SnO2 displayed a hexagonal mesostructure with a space group of P63/mmc (Fig. 7e and f). It had a uniform pore size of 18 nm and an SSA of 98 m2 g−1.118


3.2.2 Cylindrical pore structures. 
BCPs are able to form cylindrical structures in the packing parameter range of 1/3 to 1/2.37 Such templates can be used to synthesize porous materials with cylindrical pore channels, including disordered wormhole-like pores and ordered hexagonally packed structures. Disordered cylindrical pore structures usually present as wormhole-like mesostructures or short-range ordered nanochannels. Compared to spherical pores, wormhole-like pores are usually harder to achieve as cylindrical micelles are more difficult to obtain than spherical micelles by the self-assembly of BCPs in solutions, because their formation requires one-dimensional (1D) fusion of spherical micelles.133,134 Prior to 2010, many studies focused on the synthesis of mesoporous materials with single components, primarily carbons and metal oxides. Over the last decade, mesoporous materials with wormhole-like pores have been extended to composite/hybrid materials for combining the advantages of different functional materials. For instance, Lee and colleagues synthesized mesoporous Ge/GeO2/carbon hybrid materials with disordered cylindrical channels using PS-b-PEO as the template along with resol and Ge(OEt)4 as the carbon and Ge/GeO2 precursors, respectively (Fig. 8a).135 Resol could interact with the PEO block via hydrogen bonding, while hydrophilic GeOx(OH)y moieties were generated during the hydrolysis of the Ge precursor, which could mix well with the PEO block. The as-made hybrid material was carbonized at 600 °C under argon atmosphere, yielding a mesoporous GeO2/C composite. After the thermal reduction of the GeO2/carbon composite under 4% H2/Ar atmosphere at 600 °C, mesoporous Ge/GeO2/carbon hybrid with a wormhole-like pore structure was obtained (Fig. 8b), with an average pore size of 44 nm and an SSA of 89 m2 g−1.135 In addition to this report, other mesoporous materials with wormhole-like pore structures were also prepared in the last decade, including Li4TiO12136 and TiO2/carbon,126 using PI-b-PEO as the soft template.

An ordered cylindrical pore structure is typically generated by hexagonally packed cylindrical mesopores with a p6mm space group. Fu and co-workers reported the preparation of porous black TiO2 with an ordered hexagonal mesostructure via an ethylenediamine encircling process, followed by hydrogenation (Fig. 8c).137 They employed the co-assembly of Pluronic P123 and tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) in an acidic ethanol solution upon solvent evaporation. After calcining the sample at 350 °C under N2 atmosphere and subsequently at 700 °C in air, the as-made mesoporous TiO2 showed a 2D ordered hexagonal structure with a p6mm symmetry (q2 ratio = 1:3:4) (Fig. 8d and e). Mesoporous black TiO2 was further prepared by calcining the as-made mesoporous TiO2 under H2 flow at 500 °C for 3 hours, which had a large pore size of 9.6 nm, a pore volume of 0.24 cm3 g−1, and a high SSA of 124 m2 g−1.137 Other examples of ordered mesoporous materials with hexagonally packed cylindrical pores are summarized in Table 2.106,126,136,138–151


3.2.3 Bicontinuous structures. 
As the packing parameter increases to p > 1, bicontinuous structures can be formed in the EISA process of BCPs and precursors.37,38 Bicontinuous mesoporous materials have drawn tremendous interest in light of their triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMSs) and the presence of 3D continuous pores, which facilitate smooth mass transport in all directions and the maximum utilization of active sites in the materials.5,152 These features are highly desirable in ESC applications. Ordered bicontinuous structures are generally divided into three basic categories, including the Schoen gyroid (G), the Schwarz diamond (D), and the Schwarz primitive (P) surfaces (Fig. 9). These minimal surfaces separate the space into two intertwined labyrinths on both sides.152 Therefore, they are also called double gyroid (DG), double diamond (DD), and double primitive (DP) structures. It is quite difficult to obtain bicontinuous structures because of their very narrow phase region in the morphological phase diagram of BCP self-assembly and the difficulties in finding appropriate self-assembly conditions. Typical examples of ordered bicontinuous mesoporous materials are listed in Table 2.153–165

3.2.3.1 Gyroid structure. 
Among the different ordered bicontinuous architectures, gyroidal structure is relatively easy to obtain, which makes it a common morphology in bicontinuous mesoporous materials.152 This structure separates two intertwined frameworks with three-coordinate connectivity (Fig. 9a). Since the first report on mesoporous SiO2 with a gyroid structure, namely MCM-48,166 tremendous efforts have been devoted to the fabrication of bicontinuous mesoporous materials. To date, various mesoporous materials with gyroid structures, including carbons,155,159,161,162,167 metal oxides,154,157,164 metal nitrides,158,160 and even pure metals78,156 have been synthesized. There are two types of gyroidal structures in the self-assembly of BCPs, including double gyroid (GD) and alternating gyroid (GA) structures.155,156 The two networks are composed of the same materials in the GD structure, which is accessible via diblock copolymers, while the two networks are different materials in the GA structure, which is only available via triblock terpolymers. In 2014, Wiesner and co-workers demonstrated tunable synthesis of gyroidal mesoporous carbons by EISA of triblock terpolymer PI-b-PS-b-PEO (ISO) and resol (Fig. 10a).155 They successfully synthesized two gyroidal mesoporous carbon materials, including double gyroid mesoporous carbon (GDMC) (Fig. 10b) and alternating gyroid mesoporous carbon (GAMC) (Fig. 10c). The triblock terpolymer with a PEO volume fraction of ca. 50 vol% led to the formation of GDMC with an Iad symmetry, while the terpolymer with a very small PEO volume fraction of 4.9 vol% gave rise to GAMC with an I4132 symmetry (q2 ratio: 3:4:6:7:8). They found that the alternating gyroid structure can provide more pore volume compared to the double gyroid counterpart. The largest pore volume of GDMC was 1.56 cm3 g−1, with a uniform pore size of 39 nm and a high SSA of 682 m2 g−1. In comparison, the largest pore volume of GAMC was 2.01 cm3 g−1, with a uniform pore size of 35 nm and an SSA of 588 m2 g−1.155

Later, highly ordered mesoporous metals comprising single or binary metal NPs with alternating gyroid structures were successfully synthesized. Polyisoprene-b-polystyrene-b-poly(N,N-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (PI-b-PS-b-PDMAEMA) terpolymers were employed as the structure-directing agents and ligand-stabilized Pt or Au NPs were utilized as the metal precursors (Fig. 10d).156 They found that the ligands of the metal NPs could govern the BCP/NP self-assembly and tailoring the ligands of binary metal NPs could enable control over the NP spatial arrangement in the 3D structures (Fig. 10e). The synthesized polymer/NP hybrids showed an I4132 symmetry with a (q/q100)2 ratio of 2:6:8:10:12:14:16:18:20:22:24:26:30:32:34, with q100 being the reciprocal vector. This work provided important clues for the preparation of metallic systems with bicontinuous mesoporous structures.156 To date, gyroid structures have also been demonstrated in many metallic compounds, including TiO2,157 Nb2O5,154 CsTaWO6,164 Ti0.5Nb0.5N,158 and NbN160 (Table 2).
3.2.3.2 Diamond structure. 
The diamond (D) surface structure separates space into two intertwined diamond networks. Each network has a tetrahedral connectivity, as shown in Fig. 9b.152 However, this bicontinuous structure has been rarely reported, with several successful cases exclusively in SiO2,168 TiO2,163 and Al2O3.165 In 2014, Che's group employed a laboratory-made amphiphilic triblock terpolymer, poly(tert-butyl acrylate)-b-PS-b-PEO (PtBA-b-PS-b-PEO, ASO), as the soft template and TEOS as the silica precursor, and they obtained ordered mesoporous silica with a double diamond structure.168 The mesoporous silica had a symmetry of I41/amd (q2 ratio: 3:8:11:12:16:19) and a tetragonal rather than a cubic structure. The two sets of frameworks were adhered to each other, demonstrating a shifted double diamond structure. This is because the evaporation of THF and water led to the two frameworks losing the mutual support and the original cubic symmetry could not be maintained. Hence, the two frameworks shifted and attached to each other.168 In another study, they synthesized a shifted double diamond TiO2 scaffold using the linear dinonylphenyl end-capped PS-b-PEO copolymer (DNPE-PEO-b-PS) as the soft template and titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TIA) as the Ti source (Fig. 11a).163 The shifted double diamond TiO2 showed an I41/amd symmetry with a q2 ratio of 3:8:11 (Fig. 11b–d), which exhibited a complete bandgap by shifting 0.332c with a high dielectric contrast of TiO2 and thus provided an opportunity for the development of new optical devices.163 In 2018, Zhao’ group extended DD-structured materials to γ-Al2O3via vesicle-aggregation-assembly approach using PMMA-b-PEO as the soft template and aluminum isopropoxide as the Al2O3 precursor.165 The Al3+-based gel/polymer composite microspheres were obtained via the co-assembly between aluminum precursor molecules and PEO segments of the copolymers during solvent evaporation. The calcination of the composite in the air produced mesoporous γ-Al2O3 microspheres with a shifted double diamond structure, which afforded an average pore size of 72.8 nm, a pore volume of 0.34 cm3 g−1, and an SSA of 52 m2 g−1.165

3.2.3.3 Primitive structure. 
The primitive (P) surface is also called the “Plumber’ nightmare”, which has a six-coordinate interconnected node for each labyrinth, as depicted in Fig. 9c.152 The symmetry of the P surface is the same as that of the bcc structure. In 2001, Wiesner and coworkers first reported this bicontinuous structure in mesoporous materials.169 They synthesized cubic bicontinuous aluminosilicates using PI-b-PEO as the template and (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane and aluminum sec-butoxide as the inorganic precursors. The resulting mesoporous aluminosilicates had a q ratio of , which was consistent with that of the Imm space group.169 Further characterization by TEM confirmed the plumber's nightmare architecture of the resulting mesoporous aluminosilicates,170,171 rather than a bcc structure. The P surface structure has been rarely documented thus far. In the last decade, there have been no reports on mesoporous materials with this structure, except for SiO2.


3.2.4 Hierarchical pore structures. 
Hierarchical pore structures combine the benefits of macropores (which can provide improved mass transport) and mesopores or micropores (which can provide high surface area).6,20,172,173 However, many hierarchical porous materials are typically generated by activation of alkali174,175 or ammonia gas,176 and the pore structure is often irregular/disordered, which is not beneficial to the precise control of functional performance of the materials. Hence, the preparation of hierarchical porous materials with well-defined pore structures has become a research hotspot in recent years.177–180
Wiesner and coworkers reported a facile multiscale phase separation approach for the synthesis of hierarchical porous polymer scaffolds via spinodal decomposition, which can induce macro- and mesophase separation.177 They chose PS-b-PEO as the structure-guiding agent and a PEO oligomer (o-PEO) as a small additive. The BCP and o-PEO were dissolved in xylene at 10 wt%, followed by solvent evaporation at 130 °C (Fig. 12a). During the evaporation of the solvent, macrophase separation between the copolymer and o-PEO occurred, while mesopores formed due to the microphase separation of PS-b-PEO (Fig. 12b). The removal of o-PEO by washing with water and methanol/ethanol generated the macropores (Fig. 12c).177 This innovative method blazed a trail for the preparation of hierarchical porous materials for ESC applications.

Similarly, by multiscale phase separation of BCP and a homopolymer based on spinodal decomposition, Lee's group successfully developed a spherical and hollow assembly-based particle engineering (SHAPE) strategy for the synthesis of ordered discrete particles with tailored morphologies and hierarchical pore structures (Fig. 12d).178 They dissolved PS-b-PEO, homo-polystyrene (hPS), and an inorganic precursor (pre-hydrolyzed aluminosilicate or titanium ethoxide) or organic precursor (resol) in THF to yield a homogeneous solution. During the evaporation of THF, macrophase separation occurred between hPS-rich and (precursor/PS-b-PEO)-rich domains, leading to a sphere-like structure (Fig. 12e). The (precursor/PS-b-PEO)-rich domains further underwent microphase separation to form ordered mesostructures. After calcination of the as-made samples at high temperatures to remove the polymers, ordered mesoporous materials with spherical morphology were obtained. Interestingly, the addition of a small amount of homo-poly(methylmethacrylate) (hPMMA) into the precursor solution led to the formation of mesoporous hollow spheres. As the hPMMA polymer was incompatible with the hPS polymer blend, the precursor/PS-b-PEO domains were preferentially located at the interface of the hPS and hPMMA domains. After the removal of the polymers, hollow porous structures were obtained (Fig. 12f). This strategy was applicable to a diverse range of mesoporous particles, such as aluminosilicates, carbon, TiO2, Nb2O5, and WO3.178
In another report, Lee's group synthesized hierarchically porous metal oxides with macro/meso/micropores via multiscale phase separation by introducing volatile small molecules (Fig. 12g).179 Nitric acid was added into a THF solution containing PS-b-PEO and metal oxide precursors. During the evaporation of THF, the mesophase separation took place from PS-b-PEO, while the addition of nitric acid and the controlled evaporation process led to the macrophase separation. The fast and preferential evaporation of THF acted as the stimulus for spinodal decomposition, which made the homogeneous solution thermodynamically unstable. Thus, the macrophase separation occurred between the immiscible phases of the nitric acid and the precursor solution. During the evaporation process, the nitride acid was removed, resulting in macropores. As a result, they obtained hierarchically porous titanium–niobium oxide (Fig. 12h–j).179
Hierarchically porous structures based on BCP-templated methods have also been introduced into metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), which generally consist of well-defined uniform micropores or small mesopores (2–3 nm). The introduction of large mesopores to construct hierarchically porous MOFs or COFs is an effective strategy to enhance their functional performance. Many studies have reported the successful synthesis of hierarchically porous MOFs and their pore structures are diverse.45,181–184 As a typical example, Yang and coworkers synthesized hierarchical macro-/mesoporous Cu-BDC MOFs using PS spheres as the macroporous template and P123 as the mesoporous template.184 These templates were first dispersed in ethanol. Subsequently, the MOF precursors including Cu(NO3)2·3H2O and p-phthalic acid were dissolved in the mixture. After the evaporation of ethanol at 30 °C for 5 days and the removal of these two templates, followed by further reaction at 60 °C for 10 hours, Cu-BDC MOFs with highly ordered macropores (fcc close-packed arrangement) and mesopores (hexagonal packing) were obtained.184 Compared with the synthesis of hierarchically porous MOFs, hierarchically porous COFs have been rarely achieved thus far. Very recently, Ke and colleagues reported a general method combining 3D-printing technology and the BCP-templated method for the synthesis of imine COFs with hierarchical porous structures.185 The COF precursors (imine and β-ketoenamine oligomer) and F127 were first dissolved in a mixed solvent of water and THF. After the evaporation of THF, a hydrogel was obtained as a 3D-printable source. After 3D printing, removal of the F127 template and solvent annealing, imine COFs with a nano-to-macroscale hierarchical porous feature were obtained.185 Profiting from their high surface areas and hierarchically porous structures, these MOF and COF materials hold great promise as electro- or photocatalysts.186,187

3.3 Solution-based nanoprecipitation methods
In addition to BCP self-assembly in the bulk and EISA methods, solution-based nanoprecipitation strategies provide effective routes for constructing porous nanomaterials with well-defined morphologies, tunable sizes and pore structures, accompanied by less time/energy-consuming preparation processes.44,188–190 Moreover, the solution-based routes offer advantages for large-scale production owing to unlimited batch size. By nanoprecipitation methods, porous materials with distinct morphologies can be constructed. In addition, a wide range of porous materials with different dimensions have been achieved by utilizing templates with different dimensions.
In a typical nanoprecipitation approach, BCP/precursor composite aggregates are formed by the co-assembly of BCPs and precursor molecules in suitable solvent systems or by the interactions between precursor molecules and pre-assembled BCP aggregates, such as hydrogen bonding, electrostatic force, coordination interactions, and other non-covalent interactions.44,189 The morphology of the composite aggregates can be tailored by adjusting the composition of the BCP, the molar ratio of the BCP to precursor, the nature of the solvent system, and so on. Initiated by catalysts or other polymerization/condensation conditions, the precursors crosslink or polymerize into continuous networks in the coronal domain of the BCP aggregate templates. The removal of the sacrificial BCP templates by solvent dissolution or thermal treatment produces mesoporous materials. By selecting different precursors to interact with BCP templates in solutions, various types of mesoporous materials have been constructed, including carbons, metals, metallic compounds, and carbon/metal composites.44,189 Without any other template to control the dimension, 2D and 3D mesoporous materials are the typical products of nanoprecipitation methods.

3.3.1 2D mesoporous materials. 
Since the discovery of mechanically exfoliated graphene in 2004, research interest on 2D materials has increased exponentially.191–193 Owing to their unprecedented physical and chemical properties, 2D materials have been considered as an emerging class of nanostructures with large surface area, and unique electronic and optical properties.194,195 The introduction of mesopores in 2D materials provides opportunities to tune their functional properties because the pores may enhance the mass transport and the increased surface area may improve the effective utilization of the materials, thus providing an increased amount of active sites for reactants.196,197
3.3.1.1 Freestanding nanosheets. 
2D freestanding nanosheets are challenging to achieve without the assistance of 2D templates. To date, there have been only a few reports on the successful synthesis of freestanding nanosheets through the solution-based nanoprecipitation method. Recently, Yamauchi and co-workers fabricated 2D mesoporous Ir nanosheets with hexagonally arranged mesopores via the self-assembly of PS-b-PEO into spherical micelles in a mixture solution of DMF and H2O (Fig. 13a),198 using IrCl3 as the Ir source and formic acid as both reducing and shape control agents. In this report, the Ir precursor was reduced into small Ir nanocrystals by formic acid at 80 °C. These Ir nanocrystals were subsequently stabilized by the PEO chains of PS-b-PEO spherical micelles. Then, the decomposition of formic acid into carbon monoxide occurred, catalyzed by the presence of Ir metal. The released CO was adsorbed on the surfaces of the Ir nanocrystals and drove the anisotropic growth of the Ir/micelle superstructure into sheet-like morphology. After the removal of the template by solvent extraction and calcination in N2, 2D fcc mesoporous Ir nanosheets (Fig. 13b–e) with an average pore size of 15 nm and SSA of 42 m2 g−1 were obtained.198

Controlling the morphology of mesoporous metal oxide materials provides further opportunities to tune their functional properties. However, the shape control of mesoporous oxides remains challenging as it typically requires a high-pressure environment. Lan et al. previously demonstrated the synthesis of freestanding mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets through hydrothermal-induced solvent-confined self-assembly of spherical F127/TiO2 hybrid monomicelles (Fig. 13f and g).199 The formation of such mesoporous nanosheets originated from the self-assembly of the initially formed F127/TiO2 composite spherical monomicelles dispersed in an ethanol/glycerol mixture into a single-layered 2D mesostructure under hydrothermal conditions (at 100 °C). The thickness of the resulting mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets could be controlled from 5.5 to 25.5 nm by modifying the ethanol/glycerol ratio from 1:1 to 5:1, leading to significant reduction in SSA from 210 to 154 m2 g−1. Similarly, the increase of the precursor concentration (i.e., the amount of monomicelle gel) also led to an increase in the thickness of the resulting TiO2 nanosheets from 11.1 to 27.6 nm. Furthermore, the diameter of the mesopores could be tuned from 7.4 to 12.5 nm by the addition of trimethylbenzene as a swelling agent.199
3.3.1.2 Thin films. 
Different from freestanding nanosheets, the preparation of mesoporous thin films usually requires external assistance. For instance, Yamauchi's group reported the fabrication of many porous thin-films of metals and metal alloys by electrochemical deposition methods using BCP micelles as soft templates.21,200 For example, continuous mesoporous Au films with large-sized pores of 19–25 nm (Fig. 14a) have been obtained through the electrochemical deposition of precursor solutions containing PS-b-PEO and tetrachloroauric(III) acid (HAuCl4).201 PS-b-PEO was first dissolved in a THF/ethanol mixture, which formed spherical micelles composed of PS cores and PEO coronas upon the addition of HAuCl4 aqueous solution (Fig. 14b and c). The hydrophilic PEO blocks in the coronas of the micelles interacted with aqua-HAuCl4 complexes. By applying potentials, the composite micelles associated with the Au species were deposited on the working electrode. The removal of the template was performed using ultraviolet (UV) ozone cleaning. The resulting mesoporous Au film possessed uniform mesopores with an average size of 25 nm (Fig. 14d). The convenience of this method lies in the ease of tuning of the pore size by changing the amount of THF. Specifically, by varying the amount of THF, the pore diameter of the film was reduced from 25 to 19 nm. Furthermore, the thickness of the resulting mesoporous Au film was controlled from 70 to 440 nm by adjusting the deposition time.201 Based on this method, various mesoporous metallic films, including mesoporous Cu,202 Pd,203 Ni,204 Pt,205 Rh,206 and Au,207 have been obtained.

Similarly, bimetallic208–211 and ternary trimetallic alloys212 have been prepared using Pluronic or non-Pluronic BCPs as soft templates. Multimetallic alloys are known to exhibit superior catalytic activity and stability over monometallic metals due to the incorporation of additional metallic components. For instance, trimetallic mesoporous AuCuNi alloy films have been fabricated by the co-electrodeposition of HAuCl4, CuSO4, and NiCl2 precursors in the presence of PS-b-PEO as a soft template (Fig. 14e).212 In this work, the PS-b-PEO template was first dissolved in THF to produce a unimer solution. Following the addition of aqueous solutions containing Au, Cu and Ni precursors, the polymeric template self-assembled into spherical micelles in the solution. Following the application of an appropriate potential, the formed spherical micelles were deposited on the Au-coated silicon substrate. The selection of an appropriate applied potential was highly critical for achieving the co-deposition of the three metals because of the large difference between the standard reduction potentials of the different metal precursors (i.e., the standard reduction potentials of [AuCl4]−/Au, Cu2+/Cu, and Ni2+/Ni are +1.00, +0.34, and −0.25 V versus standard calomel electrode (SCE), respectively). The final composition of the resulting mesoporous trimetallic AuCuNi films was easily controlled by modifying the initial concentrations of the Au, Cu, and Ni precursors in the original electrodeposition solution (Fig. 14f–i).212


3.3.2 3D mesoporous materials. 
3.3.2.1 Mesoporous particles with defined morphologies. 
Nanoprecipitation methods provide a versatile route for the controllable synthesis of discrete mesoporous particles with the assistance of BCP assemblies as the pore-directing templates. In this subsection, mesoporous particles with defined morphologies are discussed following an order of pore structures templated by spherical micelles, cylindrical micelles, vesicles, and bicontinuous assemblies, which successively appear with the increase of the packing parameter in the morphological phase diagram of BCP self-assembly in solution (Fig. 2).
Spherical micelles are the most common aggregates formed by the self-assembly of BCPs in solutions, which have been frequently used as single-micelle or compound-micelle templates for the construction of mesoporous nanospheres.21,44,189,213–215 Using single micelles as the templates, Ariga and co-workers prepared hollow carbon nanospheres loaded with Ir NPs through the co-assembly of asymmetrical triblock PS-b-P2VP-b-PEO copolymer micelles, Ir precursors (Na3IrCl6), phenolic resol resin in solutions containing THF and HCl, where negatively charged Ir ions interacted with a positively charged micelle template via electrostatic interactions and then coated with a layer of phenolic resol (Fig. 15a).216 Each block of the terpolymer provided a distinct function: (1) the hydrophobic PS core was used to create hollow voids because the carbon source was accommodated around the PS core; (2) the protonated P2VP blocks served as binding sites for the metal ions and phenolic resol; (3) the hydrophilic PEO corona stabilized the composite micelles in solution. Heating the composite micelles under hydrothermal conditions induced the cross-linking of the phenolic resol on the PS-b-P2VP-b-PEO micelles. Then, the resin-coated micelles were decomposed to hollow carbon nanospheres loaded with Ir NPs following the thermal treatment under inert atmosphere due to the complete decomposition of the triblock copolymer template. The as-formed hollow carbon NPs had an average particle size of 42 nm, hollow cores of 23 nm, and SSA of 2490 m2 g−1 with well-dispersed Ir NPs throughout the hollow carbon NPs (Fig. 15b).216 Following similar strategies, a library of BCPs, such as PS-b-PAA, PMMA-b-PEO, PS-b-PMMA-b-PEO, and PS-b-poly[(3-(methacryloylamino)propyltrimethylammonium chloride)]-b-PEO (PS-b-PMAPTAC-b-PEO), have been used as soft templates for the construction of a broad range of hollow NPs,189 such as carbon (Fig. 15c)217 and metallic compounds (Fig. 15d).218

Aside from single spherical micelles, spherical compound micelles are frequently employed as soft templates to prepare mesoporous nanospheres.9,219,220 Zhao and co-workers developed a low-concentration hydrothermal route towards ordered mesoporous carbon NPs.219 In this work, spherical phenolic resol-F127 monomicelles were first formed through hydrogen bonding between Pluronic F127 and resol under a low concentration (10−7 mol L−1), which prevented the excessive cross-linking of the micelles. During the hydrothermal process at 130 °C, the F127/resol spherical monomicelles self-assembled into a cubic-close packed mesostructure (space group Imm), in which phenolic resol was cross-linked, resulting in a spherical morphology. Simultaneously, when the polymerization of resol took place within the spheres, the high-temperature hydrothermal treatment drove the small spherical micelles to accumulate and rearrange, leading to the formation of a large spherical F127/resol composite with an ordered cubic mesostructure. After carbonization, the F127 template was removed and mesopores with an average pore size of 3 nm were generated. The diameter of the ordered mesostructure was controllable in the range of 20–140 nm by simply adjusting the reagent concentration. These mesoporous carbon nanospheres exhibited SSAs in the range of 894–1131 m2 g−1 and pore volumes of 1.0–1.5 cm3 g−1.219 Based on a similar self-assembly protocol, Yamauchi et al. prepared nitrogen-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres using PS-b-PEO copolymers with different molar masses as soft templates and dopamine as the nitrogen-containing carbon source (Fig. 15e–g).220 The mesopores were generated from the occupation of the PS block, and the wall thickness of the mesopores was determined by the length of the PEO block. Meanwhile, Mai and coworkers also synthesized N-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres using a series of PS-b-PEO copolymers with different PS block lengths as soft templates.9 This systematic study revealed a linear relationship between the average pore size of mesoporous carbon particles and the square root of the number of repeating units in the PS block, providing an equation for quantitatively controlling over the pore dimension of mesoporous carbon materials (Fig. 15h).9
Spherical compound micelles are also applicable for the construction of mesoporous noble metals that have emerged as cutting-edge nanostructured catalysts.223,224 To date, a variety of mesoporous metals have been synthesized with the assistance of BCPs, including monometallic, bimetallic and trimetallic mesoporous metals.21 In the past decade, significant progress has been made in the BCP-templated fabrication of mesoporous monometallic particles, such as mesoporous platinum (Pt),225,226 rhodium (Rh),221 and palladium (Pd).227 For example, the shape- and size-controllable synthesis of mesoporous Pt nanospheres has been achieved through the slow reduction of H2PtCl6 with ascorbic acid in the presence of Pluronic F127 as a soft template.226 The resulting Pt nanospheres exhibited interconnected mesopores with an average pore size and wall thickness of 11 and 10 nm, respectively. Mesoporous Pt nanospheres with large average pore sizes of 8, 14, and 35 nm were previously obtained by using high-molecular-weight PS-b-P2VP-b-PEO triblock copolymers with different PS block lengths as the templates. In this triblock copolymer, the P2VP block served as an efficient metal-binding block, even more effective than PEO. The PEO block helped to stabilize the micelle via steric repulsion and the hydrophobic PS block formed the core of the micelle and controlled the size of the mesopores. The PS-b-P2VP-b-PEO copolymer was dissolved in a DMF and water mixture, generating core–shell-corona type spherical micelles. The protonated P2VP shells served as binding sites for PtCl42− ions. The addition of an ascorbic acid solution initiated both the Pt deposition and the micelle assembly. The surface of the Pt nanospheres became decorated with spherical micelles which were converted into mesopores upon a simple calcination at 250 °C in air.226 Compared to noble metals, such as Pd and Pt, the preparation of mesoporous Rh particles by chemical reduction is more challenging due to its much higher surface energy. Therefore, the successful synthesis of mesoporous Rh requires a careful control of the reaction kinetics. Yamauchi and co-workers successfully synthesized mesoporous Rh particles with an average pore size of 11 nm by employing PMMA-b-PEO, Na3RhCl6, and ascorbic acid as soft template, Rh precursor and reducing agent, respectively (Fig. 15i).221 In a mixed solution of DMF/H2O, PMMA-b-PEO formed spherical micelles which interacted with the Rh species, [Rh(H2O)3−xCl6−x](3−x)−, through hydrogen bonding and ion–dipole interactions on the PEO coronae of the micelles. These interactions led to an increase in the concentration of Rh complexes around the micelles and drove the reaction further. With the addition of an ascorbic acid solution, the reduction of Rh species in close proximity of the micelles combined with the PEO–Rh metal interactions promoted the formation of the mesostructured Rh particles. The obtained Rh NPs (Fig. 15j and k) possessed uniform and closely packed spherical porous structures with an average pore size of 10 nm, a pore wall thickness of 11 nm, and an SSA of 50 m2 g−1.221 Multicomponent metallic alloys have also attracted significant research interest. Various mesoporous bimetallic alloys, including RhCu,228 PtCu,229 PtPd,230 and PtCo,231 have been achieved. Taking PdPt spheres as an example,222 mesoporous bimetallic PdPt spheres were previously synthesized in an aqueous solution containing both Pd and Pt precursors, with F127 as the pore-directing agent (Fig. 15l, top side). In addition, F127 also acted as a protective agent for preventing the aggregation of the formed bimetallic spheres. The metal precursors could be incorporated into the PEO regions of the F127 micelles by coordination interactions. Following the reduction of the metal precursors, metal nuclei were generated and grew further by interacting with the dissolved metal species, and mesoporous nanospheres were subsequently constructed through the close packing of the micelle/metal nanohybrids. By controlling the reduction rate, monodispersed mesoporous PdPt nanospheres were finally formed (Fig. 15m), with a uniform pore size of 18.5 ± 0.5 nm, a wall thickness of 8.0 ± 0.5 nm, and an SSA of 29.9 m2 g−1. Similarly, the nanoprecipitation method has also been utilized for synthesizing mesoporous trimetallic alloy nanospheres, such as PdPtCu (Fig. 15l, bottom, and Fig. 15n).222
By employing solution-based nanoprecipitation methods and spherical compound BCP templates, mesoporous metallic compounds, including metal oxides,232 metal carbides,233 and heteropolyacids,234 have also been constructed. Moreover, by combining the precursors of carbon and metallic compounds, metallic compound NPs decorated on supporting mesoporous carbon frameworks can be constructed, which have the advantages of each component, while avoiding the aggregation of metal species.235–237 In one example, ordered mesoporous iron–nitrogen doped carbon with an open porous structure was constructed using F127 as the pore-directing agent and phenol/formaldehyde (P-MF) and melamine as carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively.236 Soluble P-MF was first mixed with F127 in water to form P-MF/F127 composite micelles through hydrogen bonding. Then, a stoichiometric amount of FeCl3 was introduced into this system and Fe3+ doped P-MF/F127 complex micelles as Fe–N/C precursors were formed. The subsequent hydrothermal treatment induced further rearrangement and polymerization of the complex micelles and the resulting Fe–N/C precursors were subsequently pyrolyzed at 700–900 °C. The obtained porous particles showed a rhombic dodecahedral shape with an Imm bcc symmetry, alongside SSAs of 741.6–1166.3 m2 g−1 and pore volumes of 0.75–1.37 cm3 g−1. All samples showed a bimodal pore size distribution: around 2.5–3.5 nm and 4.0–5.5 nm, where the larger mesopores originated from the P-MF/F127 micelle template, and the smaller ones were attributed to the intra-wall pores.236 Yamauchi's group reported the assembly of Mo2C nanocrystals onto the surfaces of mesoporous hollow carbon particles.233 In this work, the soft template was PS-b-PEO, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O was used as the Mo source, and dopamine hydrochloride (DA) acted as both coordination ligand and N-containing carbon precursor. The addition of ammonia initiated the polymerization of DA to polydopamine (PDA) that interacted with both MoO42− and PS-b-PEO micelles to form MoO42−/PDA/PS-b-PEO composite nanosheets (Mo–PDA–PS), which further assembled into 3D spherical architectures. The carbonization of PDA, during which the micelle template was also removed, drove a reaction between the Mo-containing components and carbonaceous species, yielding ultrafine molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) NPs. Eventually, hollow NPs composed of Mo2C/N-doped carbon porous nanosheets with embedded Mo2C NPs (∼2 nm in diameter) were formed, with a uniform pore size of 10 nm and an SSA of 212 m2 g−1.233
Employing cylindrical micelles as the template, Zhao and coworkers first reported mesoporous carbon particles with cylindrical pores in 2007. They obtained cubic mesoporous carbon single-crystals of rhombdodecahedron with a uniform pore size of 5 μm by aqueous organic–organic self-assembly of F127 and phenol/formaldehyde resols.238 Inspired by this work, several mesoporous materials with highly ordered hexagonal mesostructures have been achieved.239,240 Deng and coworkers prepared mesoporous carbon particles in aqueous solution via hydrothermal treatment (Fig. 16a).239 In their work, F127 was used as the pore-directing agent and phenol/formaldehyde (PF) resols were used as the carbon precursor. Hexamethylenetetramine (HMT) was employed to replace formaldehyde during the polymerization of PF resols because it was stable in aqueous solution and could slowly release formaldehyde and ammonia. The organic–organic self-assembly could be well controlled upon the introduction of HMT, which played a crucial role in the construction of RF-based mesoporous carbons with an ordered hexagonal mesophase (Fig. 16b and c). The resultant mesoporous carbon particles exhibit a spherical morphology with a pore diameter of 4.7 nm, a high SSA of 1483 m2 g−1 and a total pore volume of 0.96 cm3 g−1.239 Through similar aqueous self-assembly with F127 as the pore-directing template and the assistance of hydrothermal treatment, Xue and coworkers synthesized interesting rod-like carbon particles with an ordered hexagonal mesostructure by precisely tuning the added amount of F127 (Fig. 16d–f).240

By using BCP vesicles as templates, Mai and co-workers prepared bowl-like N-doped carbon hollow particles templated by PS-b-PEO “kippah” vesicles in solution (Fig. 17a).241 In this case, dopamine was employed as the carbon precursor, which was adsorbed in the PEO coronae of the vesicles via hydrogen bonding. After the polymerization of dopamine and pyrolysis of the resulting vesicle-polydopamine particles at 900 °C under nitrogen atmosphere, bowl-shaped N-doped carbon hollow NPs were obtained. The bowl-like carbon NPs (Fig. 17b and c) possessed an average diameter of 450 nm, uniform carbon shell thickness of 23 nm, and high SSA of 370 m2 g−1.241 Compared to their spherical counterpart, the bowl-shaped hollow particles exhibited increased packing density,242 thus reducing the volume of the resulting electrodes.

The fabrication of 3D porous particles with bicontinuous structures through BCP self-assembly in solution has so far been rarely reported due to the difficulty in finding appropriate self-assembly conditions for the formation of bicontinuous structures of BCPs.38,243–251 These complex mesophases have been primarily documented in BCP colloidal particles thus far. Mai and coworkers demonstrated the tunable self-assembly of PS-b-PEO copolymers into mesoporous polymer cubosomes with inverse Imm or Pnm mesophases (Fig. 18a–e).38 They plotted a new morphological phase diagram for the solution self-assembly of PS-b-PEO through the initial copolymer concentration against the volume fraction of the PS block. This study affords a simple system and method for the controllable preparation and fundamental studies of ordered bicontinuous structures, and provides desirable templates for the synthesis of electrochemically active porous energy materials with bicontinuous architectures. Although rarely reported, several functional materials including TiO2 and metal–phenolic hybrids with ordered bicontinuous structures have been achieved by using bicontinuous-structured polymer cubosomes as soft templates.252,253 Very recently, Lin et al. reported the fabrication of bicontinuous metal–phenolic networks (MPNs) with a single primitive cubic (Pmm) mesophase using polymer cubosomes (Imm) as sacrificial templates (Fig. 18f–l).252 They also employed PS-b-PEO as the self-assembly precursor for the construction of Imm polymer cubosomes with a bicontinuous structure (Fig. 18g–i). The subsequent filling of metal and phenolic precursors into the large mesopores of the cubosomes, followed by their cross-linking and then removal of the BCP template, produced meso-MPN particles with a single primitive bicontinuous network (Fig. 18j–l). Through this general approach, various metal and phenolic precursors were utilized to construct a wide range of bicontinuous meso-MPNs, which hold great promise in ESC applications.252

3.3.2.2 Porous monoliths. 
Porous monoliths, which are usually demanded in bulk mass electrodes of energy storage devices, can offer high storage capacity and long-term durability. Hyper-crosslinking of BCP assemblies is an effective approach to construct porous monoliths.254–257 Matyjaszewski and co-workers previously constructed mesoporous polymeric and carbonaceous monoliths through the hyper-crosslinking of BCP micelles (Fig. 19a).258 In their study, PMMA-b-PS copolymers first self-assembled into spherical micelles consisting of a PMMA core and a PS corona in a mixed solvent of carbon tetrachloride and cyclohexane. The resulting micelles were used as building blocks for the formation of polymeric frameworks by the hyper-cross-linking of the PS blocks via the Friedel–Crafts reaction. The intramicellar hyper-crosslinking of the PS chains in the coronae produced micropores while the intermicellar hyper-cross-linking resulted in a 3D interconnected polymeric framework containing numerous mesopores. The resulting cross-linked polymer agglomerates were converted to mesoporous carbons by pyrolysis, during which the PMMA cores decomposed leaving behind hollow holes, while the crosslinked PS domains were converted to carbon. The obtained mesoporous carbon (Fig. 19b and c) possessed a mean pore diameter of 16 nm, an average shell thickness of 6 nm, a high SSA of 829 m2 g−1, and a total pore volume of 1.07 cm3 g−1.258

Mesoporous monoliths with ordered pore structures can also be prepared by BCP-templated methods in solutions.259,260 In a typical study by Wu and coworkers, polyethylene glycol (PEG) homopolymer was added to induce the self-assembly of phenol/formaldehyde (PF) resol and Pluronic P123 (Fig. 19d).259 PEG has good compatibility with both of the self-assembly precursors in aqueous solution, and thus could enhance the interaction between the PF resol and P123, leading to the formation of a 2D hexagonal ordered mesostructure. Through a simple mixing of P123, PEG, and PF resol in an aqueous solution and reaction at 65 °C for 120 h, ordered aggregates composed of polymerized RF resol/PEG/P123 were obtained. Following further heating at 350 °C for 3 hours, the decomposition of P123 and PEG occurred, leading to the formation of a mesoporous polymer with a 2D hexagonal ordered mesostructure (Fig. 19e). After carbonization, ordered mesoporous carbon was obtained with an average pore size of around 9 nm and an SSA of 563 m2 g−1 (Fig. 19f).259 Moreover, ordered mesoporous resorcinol/formaldehyde (RF) resin-derived carbon materials with an Imm symmetry could also be prepared by controlling the kinetics of the polymerization of the RF resin.261

3.4 Interfacial self-assembly in solution
In general, interfacial self-assembly262,263 involves the non-covalent packing of BCP micelles associated with organic/inorganic precursors at soft or solid surfaces of different dimensional substrates.264–266 The subsequent polymerization or cross-linking of the precursors and the removal of BCP templates yield mesoporous materials of different dimensions. This strategy opens pathways for achieving tunable construction of porous heterostructures and controlling their dimensionality. The wide range of interface suppliers (including many 1D–3D functional materials), BCP pore-creating templates, and precursors enable the production of a variety of mesoporous materials with tailorable dimensions and pore structures for potential applications in ESC systems.

3.4.1 1D materials. 
1D nanomaterials (e.g., nanowires, nanofibers or nanotubes) have gained enormous interest due to their well-controlled dimensions and axial charge transport.267–272 Porous 1D materials can further combine the advantages of various pore structures with a specific dimension, affording them direct pathways for charge transfer and larger surface areas for achieving maximum contact between the electrolyte and the electrode.269,273 Furthermore, they possess excellent mechanical flexibility and the ability to resist volume variation, which are desirable for flexible micro-electrodes.274,275 In principle, almost all 1D materials can be employed as interface suppliers if suitable interfacial interactions are utilized. In recent years, much effort has been devoted to the utilization of 1D carbon materials,276–278 metals,279 and metal oxides280 as the interface suppliers for the construction of 1D porous nanohybrids via interfacial self-assembly approaches.
By using carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the 1D template and PS-b-PEO as the pore-creating agent, Liu et al. designed an effective strategy for the construction of 1D porous conducting polymer/carbon nanohybrids (Fig. 20a and b).276 The approach involved the co-assembly of CNTs with oxygen-containing functional groups (such as –COOH and –OH) on the surface, pyrrole molecules and PS-b-PEO spherical micelles in an aqueous solution. Through hydrogen bonding, the pyrrole molecules were adsorbed in the PEO coronae of the micelles, which further packed tightly on the surface of the CNTs. After the polymerization of pyrrole molecules and the removal of the BCP template, 1D mesoporous polypyrrole/CNT (PPy/CNT) hybrid was produced with a mean pore diameter of 12 nm.276 Through a similar strategy, Liu et al. prepared mesoporous TiO2/CNT hybrid nanotubes by coating an ultrathin mesoporous crystalline TiO2 shell (∼20 nm in thickness) on CNTs (Fig. 20c and d).278 The obtained flexible hybrid nanotubes exhibited uniform accessible mesopores (6.2 nm) and a high SSA of 137 m2 g−1.

Mai and colleagues synthesized mesoporous Mo2C/carbon hybrid nanotubes by using MoO3 nanobelts as both 1D template and the Mo2C precursor (Fig. 20e).280 In an aqueous solution, the interfacial self-assembly of PS-b-PEO spherical micelles containing pyrrole molecules in the PEO coronae resulted in the close packing of the micelles on the MoO3 nanobelts. After the polymerization of pyrrole, initiated by ammonium persulphate (APS), ammonia was added to convert MoO3 to MoO42− (MoO3 + 2NH3·H2O → 2NH4+ + MoO42− + H2O), which was then absorbed in the PPy network through Mo–N coordination. The amount of ammonia controlled the mass of etched MoO3 and consequently the loading content of Mo2C particles in the final hybrid nanotubes. The pyrolysis at 800 °C under nitrogen atmosphere converted PPy to N-doped carbon and Mo species to Mo2C NPs, which were embedded within the carbon domain, thus generating mesoporous Mo2C/carbon hybrid nanotubes (Fig. 20f and g) with uniform spherical pores (∼18 nm in diameter), an average wall thickness of 18 nm, a maximum SSA of 377 m2 g−1, and an optimum Mo2C content of 40 wt%.280


3.4.2 2D materials. 
The growth of mesoporous layers on the surface of 2D materials may lead to various mesoporous nanosheets.44,197,264,281,282 In particular, patterning mesoporous electrochemically active moieties on freestanding nanosheets, such as graphene oxide (GO) and other inorganic nanosheets (e.g., TiO2, MoS2, etc.)283–285 can generate 2D sandwich-structured mesoporous nanohybrids.276,286,287 This methodology may prevent the aggregation of pristine nanosheets and increase their surface areas, which are desirable for enhancing the electrochemical performance in ESC devices.197,288–290 As such, great efforts have been devoted to fabricating 2D sandwich-structured porous nanohybrids through interfacial self-assembly protocols.
In 2015, Zhao and colleagues reported a general strategy to grow single-layer ultrathin mesoporous carbon films by interfacial self-assembly of BCP micelles on various substrates (Fig. 21a).281 The resulting mesoporous films possessed only a single layer of mesopores, while they could grow up to inch size in the plane. By this strategy, ultrathin mesoporous carbon films on different types (e.g., metal oxides, carbon) of substrates with various morphologies (e.g., flexible and patterned substrates) were obtained. Taking the coating of a mesoporous carbon layer on a 2D silicon wafer modified with Al2O3 as an example (Fig. 21b), in an aqueous solution F127 and phenolic resol molecules first co-assembled into spherical composite monomicelles, which were further adsorbed on the surface of the Al2O3 substrate via electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding. Under hydrothermal treatment at 130 °C, the resol molecules covering the micelles were polymerized. After carbonization at 700 °C, the F127 template was removed and an ordered mesoporous carbon layer was achieved on the Al2O3 substrate. The mesoporous carbon films had an area of 1 × 1 cm2 to one-quarter of a 3 inch depending on the scale of the silicon wafer substrates (Fig. 21b and c). The carbon films could be transferred to other substrates by a stamp transfer method. The mesoporous films exhibited a uniform pore size of 9 nm and an average thickness of ca. 1 nm.281 The key to controlling the thickness of the nanosheets was the low concentration of monomicelle close-packing assembly.264 At a low concentration, heterogeneous nucleation of monomicelles on the substrate via electrostatic attraction was superior to the close-stacking of monomicelles by spontaneous nucleation. Therefore, a single layer of the monomicelles was formed on the substrate, which enabled the formation of ultrathin nanosheets. The interfacial self-assembly of monomicelles has also been demonstrated on flexible substrates, such as GO. In 2016, Lou and coworkers reported the interfacial self-assembly of monolayers of F127/polydopamine composite micelles on both sides of GO nanosheets through hydrogen bonding.287 The tightly packed composite micelles were converted into mesoporous carbon layers sandwiching GO sheets through pyrolysis under nitrogen atmosphere.

As an example of utilizing free-standing inorganic nanosheets as the 2D template, Mai and colleagues reported the synthesis of 2D mesoporous carbon sheets using layered double hydroxide (LDH) sheets as a sacrificial template, as LDH could be dissolved in an acidic solution (Fig. 21d).291 PS-b-PEO spherical micelles with m-phenylenediamine monomers adsorbed in the PEO corona were attracted to the surface of LDH nanosheets through hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. After the polymerization of m-phenylenediamine, 2D freestanding poly(m-phenylenediamine) nanosheets with holey pores were obtained through the self-sacrifice of the LDH template, which could be dissolved gradually by the acid formed during the polymerization of m-phenylenediamine. The obtained carbon nanosheets had an average pore size of 16 nm and an SSA of 256 m2 g−1 (Fig. 21e and f).291 In another interesting example, Zhao's group reported the construction of a 2D sandwich-like mesoporous carbon@TiO2@carbon heterostructure (Fig. 21g).292 They first prepared mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets through a solution-based nanoprecipitation method. Then, two monolayers of F127/dopamine composite micelles were coated on both surfaces of the mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets. Following the polymerization of dopamine and subsequent carbonization, a 2D mesoporous carbon@TiO2@carbon sandwich-like heterostructure (Fig. 21h and i) was formed. The mesopore sizes of the exterior carbon and interior titania layers were approximately 15 and 3 nm, respectively. The surface area and pore volume of the 2D heterostructure were 267 m2 g−1 and 0.34 cm3 g−1, respectively.292
Building on a similar principle, the growth of 2D mesoporous conducting polymers on 2D freestanding surfaces has been achieved as well.276 In 2015, Liu et al. developed a universal strategy for coating freestanding nanosheets with mesoporous conducting polymers in aqueous solutions (Fig. 22a–i).276 In their approach, a series of ultrathin freestanding nanosheets, including GO, MoS2, TiO2, and exfoliated graphene, were used as the 2D templates. The co-assembly of PS-b-PEO spherical micelles and pyrrole monomers on the surfaces of these nanosheets through hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions resulted in the tight packing of the micelles with pyrrole molecules in the PEO corona on the nanosheets. Following polymerization of the pyrrole monomers, PPy networks were generated. The subsequent removal of the BCP template by solvent dissolution gave rise to sandwich-structured mesoporous hybrid nanosheets. The thickness, pore size, and SSA of the resulting hybrid nanosheets could be tailored by simply adjusting the PS block length of the PS-b-PEO template.276

Mai's group extended the interfacial self-assembly concept to 2D soft material surfaces. They employed lamellae formed by small-molecule surfactants as the 2D template for synthesizing monolayer mesoporous conducting polymer nanosheets.286,293 For example, octadecylamine was utilized to form ultrathin lamellae in an ethanol/H2O mixture (Fig. 22j).293 On the other side, PS-b-PEO copolymers self-assembled into spherical micelles in a THF/H2O mixed solvent. After mixing the solutions of the micelles and the lamellae, the micelles could be adsorbed on both surfaces of the lipid lamellae, driven by the hydrogen bonding between the PEO chains and –NH2 groups. Subsequently, pyrrole monomers were added into the mixed solution, which could be adsorbed in the PEO domains and then polymerized into a PPy polymeric network after the addition of a catalyst. The removal of the BCP templates by solvent washing yielded monolayer mesoporous PPy nanosheets. By selecting PS-b-PEO templates with different PS block lengths, the resultant PPy nanosheets (Fig. 22k and l) were endowed with tunable thicknesses (25–30 nm), pore sizes (6.8–13.6 nm) and SSAs (73–96 m2 g−1).293 By virtue of precise structural control and easy template removal, the interfacial self-assembly on 2D lipid bilayers provided a versatile platform for the construction of 2D freestanding monolayer mesoporous materials.
During the synthesis of mesoporous carbons or conducting polymers, the incorporation of metallic or metal oxide species into the mesoporous layers can be accompanied during the interfacial self-assembly.11,294,295 For instance, Mai and colleagues synthesized 2D sandwich-like mesoporous carbon nanosheets with incorporated Mo2C NPs in the co-assembly process of GO, PS-b-PEO, and pyrrole monomers.294 When the polymeric micelles, coupled with pyrrole molecules that were adsorbed on the PEO domain, were closely packed on both surfaces of GO through hydrogen bonding, the Mo source (Mo7O246− ions) was co-adsorbed with pyrrole molecules via the Mo–N coordination. Then, pyrrole molecules on the GO surface were polymerized into continuous PPy networks, yielding PPy–Mo7O246−/copolymer/GO composite nanosheets. After pyrolysis of the 2D nanocomposites, sandwich-structured mesoporous N-doped carbon/Mo2C/reduced graphene oxide (mNC–Mo2C@rGO) nanohybrids with well-defined spherical pores were produced. The prepared mNC–Mo2C@rGO nanosheets with embedded small Mo2C NPs (with a small average diameter of ∼4 nm) possessed average pore sizes of ∼13 nm and large SSAs of up to 389 m2 g−1.294 In another case, the polymerization of pyrrole monomers on both sides of GO was triggered by FeCl3, which could be simultaneously adsorbed on the resulting PPy network through Fe–N coordination.11 The resulting mesoporous PPy/rGO nanosheets with incorporated Fe2O3 NPs possessed tunable pore sizes (14–23 nm), mean thicknesses (34–52 nm), and SSAs (111–248 m2 g−1), depending on the PS block length of the PS-b-PEO template.11 2D mesoporous metal nanosheets have also been achieved by interfacial self-assembly strategy. Xu and coworkers recently reported the synthesis of ultra-thin mesoporous Pt nanosheets by combining a highly ordered arrangement of BCP micelles on a silicon substrate and a suitably designed chemical reduction.296 They employed the co-assembly of PS-b-P2VP-b-PEO and Pt precursor (H2PtCl6) to form composite spherical micelles through a dialysis method, and then the composite micelles were spin-coated on a silicon substrate in a well-ordered monolayer fashion. Next, a two-step reduction procedure using dimethylaminobenzaldehyde vapor (for nucleation) and ascorbic acid (for further growth) as the reduction agents was implemented, which enabled a complete Pt deposition and consequently the formation of continuous Pt nanosheets. Eventually, mesoporous Pt nanosheets were obtained after the removal of the BCP micelles.296
When employed as electrode materials, the stacking of mesoporous nanosheets with spherical pores could impede the smooth in-plane mass transport. This problem can be overcome by introducing in-plane cylindrical pores on the surface of nanosheets by taking advantage of an interfacial self-assembly strategy, which was demonstrated by Mai and colleagues (Fig. 23).12 The strategy involves the co-assembly of P123 cylindrical micelles, monomers (e.g., pyrrole, aniline, or dopamine), and GO in a mixed solvent system (Fig. 23a). Driven by hydrogen bonding, the cylindrical micelles tightly packed on the GO surface, while adsorbing the monomers in the PEO domains. The subsequent polymerization of the monomers led to the formation of a continuous polymeric network. After the removal of the P123 template and subsequent hydrothermal treatment, mesoporous polymeric monolayers with cylindrical mesopores on the surface of rGO were achieved (Fig. 23b and c). The resulting 2D sandwich-like nanohybrids had average pore diameters of ∼12 nm and high SSAs of up to 157 m2 g−1. They also demonstrated that the parallel cylindrical mesopores offered in-plane pathways for smoother and faster ion diffusion compared with spherical pores, affording the nanohybrids great potential applications in 2D planar energy storage devices.12 In another study, they also demonstrated the interfacial self-assembly of cylindrical micelles on the surface of 2D inorganic hard templates (e.g., MoS2) to fabricate various mesoporous nanohybrids with in-plane cylindrical pores, thus demonstrating the universality of this methodology.10

3.4.3 3D materials. 
Similar to the synthesis of 1D or 2D mesoporous materials, 3D mesoporous materials can be constructed by using 3D templates, such as inorganic particles, 3D aerogels, etc., while the mesopores originate from BCP micelles.297–300 For instance, core–shell structures can be easily obtained through coating mesoporous layers on the surfaces of diverse 3D polymeric or inorganic particles, producing various core–shell functional materials.287,301–304 Taking a recent classical study as an example, Lan et al. demonstrated a precise manner for constructing core–shell functional nanoparticles by coating single-layer ordered mesoporous crystalline TiO2 on various inorganic particles, including SiO2 nanospheres, carbon nanospheres, and Fe2O3 ellipsoids (Fig. 24a).304 First, titania oligomer composite monomicelles formed from Pluronic F127 and tetrabutyl titanate were prepared in a hydrochloric acid/THF solution through the slow evaporation of THF. A sol–gel process was then initiated by mixing the titania monomicelles and inorganic particles (as the final cores) in ethanol/glycerol mixed solvent under stirring. High-viscosity glycerol as a co-solvent enabled the monomicellar self-assembly in a spatially confined direction, and decreased the hydrolysis and condensation rates of titania oligomers by adhering to the titania monomicelles. As a result, the formed TiO2 shells (Fig. 24b) possessed a monolayer of mesopores, a high surface area (119 m2 g−1), and a large mean mesopore size (9.8 nm). Moreover, the precise control by this confined assembly approach enabled the formation of TiO2 shells containing one to five mesoporous layers (Fig. 24b–f), and the mesopore diameter could be tuned from 4.7 to 18.4 nm by changing the amount of the swelling agent (trimethylbenzene).304

Based on similar principles for the synthesis of core–shell structures, hollow or yolk–shell structures can be constructed by completely or partially etching the core materials. Yamauchi and co-workers reported the formation of mesoporous hollow N-doped carbon spheres, where they used silica NPs as the hard template, PS-b-PEO as the soft template for generating mesopores in the shell, and dopamine as the N-rich carbon precursor.301 As shown in Fig. 24g–j, the principle for the preparation of mesoporous carbon spheres is similar to the previously introduced monomicelle close-packing assembly approach for fabricating 1D or 2D mesoporous materials, except for the used template. After the formation of core–shell nanospheres with N-doped mesoporous carbon shells, the silica templates were etched with hydrofluoric acid, yielding N-doped hollow carbon spheres (Fig. 24j), which had inner cores of approximately 350 nm in size, mesoporous carbon shells with a mean pore size of 20 nm, and a high SSA of 427 m2 g−1.301 Using a similar strategy, hollow mesoporous metal particles could also be fabricated.305,306 Taking the preparation of trimetallic PtPdCo polyhedra with hollow cavities as an example,305 in the first step, Pd@PtPdCo core–shell mesoporous nanopolyhedra (Pd@PtPdCo MNPs) were first prepared by a simple chemical reduction reaction. During this step, Pd@PtPdCo MNPs were prepared by a one-step co-reduction, in which the mixture of the precursors of Pt, Pd, and Co interacted with F127 micelles to form metal precursor/F127 composite micelles. Here, F127 served as both pore-forming and protective agents for preventing particle aggregation. In the second step, the Pd cores of the Pd@PtPdCo MNPs were selectively etched to produce trimetallic PtPdCo nanopolyhedra with hollow cavities with an average diameter of 105 nm and well-defined mesoporous structure.305 By controlling the degree of etching, Lou's group constructed mesoporous yolk–shell structures.287 In a typical study, the F127–dopamine composite micelles first interacted with Fe2O3 quasi-cubes to form core–shell Fe2O3@F127–dopamine quasi-cubic nanohybrids. After the polymerization of dopamine monomers and subsequent thermal treatment, the F127 template was removed and core–shell Fe2O3@mesoporous carbon particles were formed. Next, the partial etching of the quasi-cubic Fe2O3 template produced yolk–shell carbon/Fe2O3 hybrids with uniform mesopores (Fig. 24k and n). Similarly, by using different 3D particles such as silica spheres and SiO2@TiO2 spheres, SiO2@mesoporous carbon yolk–shell colloidosome hybrids (Fig. 24l and o) and SiO2@TiO2@mesoporous carbon yolk–double–shell colloidosome hybrids (Fig. 24m and p) were also achieved.287
Alternatively, 3D frameworks consisting of 2D nanosheets may provide ideal templates to make 3D mesoporous materials. Tian et al. synthesized 3D carbon nanoflowers consisting of mesoporous carbon nanosheets by employing layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoflowers as sacrificial 3D templates, PS-b-PEO as the pore-creating template and m-phenylenediamine as the carbon precursor (Fig. 24q–s).291 The nanosheet-assembled LDH nanoflowers were prepared by co-precipitation method, which involved the use of nickel and manganese salts as the metal precursors and hexamethylenetetramine as a hydrolyzing agent. Based on the monomicelle close-packing assembly principle, 3D mesoporous carbon nanoflowers with holey pores were produced by sacrificing the LDH nanoflowers. The resulting 3D carbon nanoflower (Fig. 24s) possessed uniform mesopores of 15 nm and a high SSA of 266 m2 g−1.291 Liu's group employed graphene aerogels for the preparation of mesoporous carbon monoliths.307 Graphene aerogels prepared from the hydrothermal treatment of GO typically exhibit macroporosity and good mechanical stability. By tuning the weight ratio of the F127/resol composite micelles to the graphene aerogels, porous graphene aerogels with well-defined in-plane spherical mesopores or cylindrical pores were obtained after carbonization, which had uniform pore sizes of ca. 9 nm and SSAs of ca. 250 m2 g−1.307

3.5 Emulsion-templating method
Instead of the rigid templates mentioned above, the emulsion-templating method offers a flexible way for incorporating highly interconnected pores into materials, which largely enhances the mass transport.190,308–310 The emulsion-templating method has several advantages, including easy removal of the template, feasibility for large-scale production, and environmental friendliness. In emulsion systems, the inner and outer interfaces of emulsion droplets possess two different environments. During the synthesis of mesoporous materials, amphiphilic BCPs serve as both surfactants for stabilizing the emulsion and mesopore-creating agents. Precursor molecules are cross-linked or polymerized within the emulsion droplets or oil/water interfaces owing to the space-confinement effect. The removal of the emulsion and BCPs leads to the production of porous materials with hierarchical porous structures, in which macropores are templated by the emulsion droplets, while the mesopores are constructed by the BCP templates.
Controlling the solubility of precursors in oil and water phases and the interfacial tension on the surface of emulsion droplets provides opportunities for fabricating iso- or anisotropic porous particles that are difficult to prepare by other solution-based protocols.311–314 For example, Dai and co-workers prepared N-doped porous multichambered carbon microspheres by employing Pluronic F127 and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS) as dual surfactants, and 2,6-diaminopyridine (DAP) and formaldehyde as carbon precursors (Fig. 25a–e).77 The multichamber polymers were prepared via a two-step polymerization. The first step was the formation of cytoskeleton-like prepolymer of DAP and formaldehyde (donated as DAP-F) microspheres by the dual surfactants. F127 was used as the steric stabilizer to prevent the aggregation of polymer particles. The NH2 groups of DAP decreased the area of head groups of the negatively charged anionic surfactant SDBS by reducing the electrostatic repulsion of the surfactant, which resulted in the formation of large chambers in DAP-F spheres (Fig. 25b). The second step of polymerization was induced by the addition of acetic acid, which accelerated the cross-linking of the DAP-F prepolymer. The confinement of polymerization in microspheres resulted in the space partition of large chambers and the formation of rich chambers inside them. The average diameter of the multichambered polymers could be tuned in the range of 250–3091 nm by varying the mass ratio of SDBS and F127. The multichambered polymers (Fig. 25d) were carbonized and activated by CO2 to obtain multichambered carbon microspheres with microporous shells and high SSAs of up to 1797 m2 g−1 (Fig. 25e).77 On the other hand, emulsion droplets may assist with the formation of NPs with ordered mesophases.315 Cationic fluorocarbon surfactant and Pluronic F127 were used as templates; ethanol and 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) were employed as organic co-solvents; resorcinol and formaldehyde (RF) were selected as carbon precursors. By tuning the interfacial energy and interactions between the composites in the emulsion system, as well as the polymerization rate of the carbon precursors, mesoporous RF resin spheres with two main morphologies were obtained by the self-assembly of RF together with emulsion droplets through hydrogen bonding (Fig. 25f). After calcination at 800 °C under N2 flow, mesoporous carbon NPs with different morphologies were obtained, including mesoporous nanospheres with 2D hexagonal (p6mm) symmetry (Fig. 25g and h) and multilayered concave hollow nanospheres (Fig. 25i and j). The mesoporous carbon nanospheres had an average pore size of 3 nm and SSAs of 640–857 m2 g−1. Interestingly, the mesoporous carbon nanospheres with 2D hexagonal symmetry could be transformed into multilayered concave hollow nanospheres by increasing the amount of ethanol or TMB, the concentration of surfactant, or decreasing the initial reaction temperature, due to the thermodynamic change of hydrophobicity of the surfactants, which accordingly altered their packing parameters in the assemblies.315

Emulsion droplets also provide desirable templates for the construction of anisotropic NPs.317–323 For example, Lou's group demonstrated an emulsion-induced interface anisotropic self-assembly strategy to achieve uniform bowl-like mesoporous carbon particles with radially-oriented mesochannels.76 In this case, the emulsion system is formed by sonication of two immiscible liquids, including 1,3,5-trimethylbenzene (TMB) and water (Fig. 25k). Then, F127, TMB, and dopamine formed composite micelles through the hydrogen bonding between F127 and polydopamine and the swelling effect of TMB on PPO chains of F127. After the addition of the swelling agent, island-shaped mesostructured polydopamine seeds assembled by F127/TMB/polydopamine composite micelles were generated at the TMB/water interface. Then, the cooperative self-assembly of the composite micelles drove the oriented growth of mesochannels from the micelles along the radial direction within the particles, generating bowl-like polydopamine particles with radially oriented mesopores (Fig. 25l). After carbonization, the as-formed carbon NPs exhibited mesochannels with an average diameter of ∼8 nm and a high SSA of 619 m2 g−1.76 In a related study, this group prepared walnut-shaped N-doped carbon NPs with ultra-large channels through the addition of extra P123 in the above-discussed system (Fig. 25m).316 By finely tuning the packing parameters of P123 and F127, a series of anisotropic N-doped carbon NPs were obtained (Fig. 25n–r). When the P123/F127 mass ratio was increased from 0:1 to 1:15 and then to 1:3, the resulting mesoporous particles transformed from a bowl-like structure with 2D hexagonal columnar channels (Fig. 25n) to a dendritic architecture with radially-oriented mesochannels (Fig. 25o), and then to walnut-shaped particles with a bicontinuous pore structure (Fig. 25p). When the P123/F127 mass ratio was further increased to 1:1 and 5:3, non-porous crumpled nanosheets (Fig. 25q) and nanodisks (Fig. 25r) were formed, respectively. The resulting carbon NPs possessed porous structures. Taking the walnut-shaped particles as an example, they had pore sizes in the range of 13–50 nm and an SSA of 150 m2 g−1.316
Nanoparticle-stabilized emulsions, namely, Pickering emulsions, have also been employed as templates for the synthesis of mesoporous materials. Yang and coworkers developed a novel method to synthesize mesoporous carbon microspheres (MCMs) with controlled interior structures, based on BCP assembly within the droplet-confined space in Pickering emulsion (Fig. 26).324 Water droplets in silica NP-stabilized Pickering emulsions were used as spherical templates (Fig. 26a). With the co-assembly of phenolic resol and F127, the polymerization of phenolic resol both at the toluene/water interface and inside the water droplets yielded polymeric microspheres with big outer crusts and inner ordered mesostructures. The slight change of each variable in the emulsion system could induce rich evolution of particle morphology (Fig. 26b). By adjusting the synthetic parameters, the enclosed liquid mixture of oil, water, and nanomicelle composites underwent microphase changes, resulting in a library of MCMs, including multi-chambered, bijel-structured, multi-cored, and honeycombed MCMs.324

4. Applications of BCP-templated mesoporous materials
Mesoporous materials exhibit a diversity of potential applications in ESC devices, such as rechargeable batteries,269 supercapacitors,325 electro- or photo-catalysis,194 and solar cells.2 Compared with microporous materials, mesoporous materials have shown some incomparable advantages. Although microporous materials have large surface area, many micropores are closed or exhibit narrow bottle-necks, which are difficult to immerse by electrolyte, especially large-sized organic electrolyte molecules, leading to poor utilization of the surface area. In addition, smaller pores (<0.5 nm) are usually inaccessible by hydrated ions, leading to the poor wettability of microporous materials.326–328 In contrast, the large mesopores of mesoporous materials may provide faster ion/electrolyte transport pathways, which are favorable for achieving high capacitive performance at high current densities. Based on these reasons, many mesoporous materials show better electrochemical performance in ESC devices compared to their microporous counterparts.329–331 Furthermore, for some energy storage applications requiring the incorporation of metal or metal oxide nanoparticles, such as electrode materials of batteries and supercapacitors, mesoporous materials with large mesopores are desirable loading carriers as the sizes of the nanoparticles are generally larger than the scale of micropores. Meanwhile, porous structures can better accommodate strain relaxation and prevent structural collapse during repeated electrochemical or electrocatalytic cycling. On the other hand, the dimensionality of the materials determines their potential applications in ESC devices. For example, 1D materials are suitable for the construction of fiber- or wire-like electrodes in weavable or wearable devices.267,332 2D materials have received enormous interest in 2D flexible planar devices due to their high areal packing density, short mass transport distance, and good flexibility.333,334 3D materials are usually dominant in energy devices with relatively large volume electrodes, which provide more opportunities for controlling the device functionality and performance.297 In this section, we introduce typical applications of mesoporous materials with different dimensionalities and/or pore architectures in ESC devices.
4.1 Rechargeable batteries
The rapid development of various modern applications, from portable electronics to automobiles, has brought increasing demands for rechargeable batteries. In this subsection, we introduce the utilization of mesoporous materials as electrode materials in two popular types of secondary batteries, including alkali metal-ion batteries (e.g., Li+/Na+/K+ batteries) and lithium–sulfur batteries (Li–S), with the focus on the discussion of the contributions of mesoporous structures to the electrochemical performance of these batteries.

4.1.1 Alkali metal-ion batteries. 
Rechargeable alkali metal-ion (Li+/Na+/K+) batteries have gained widespread attention since their inception, in view of numerous advantages such as high discharge voltage, small size, and light weight.335
4.1.1.1 Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). 
LIBs are currently the most popular alkali metal-ion batteries owing to their ease of manufacturing and widespread applications. Typical LIBs are operated by exchanging Li ions between the graphite anode and a lithium-intercalated compound cathode (e.g., LiMO2, M = Co, Ni, Mn).269,274 The faster transport of Li+ between/inside the electrodes (both anode and cathode) during the charge/discharge process can make it easier to achieve a high power density. In LIBs, the characteristic time (τeq) for the diffusion of lithium ions through an electrode material is determined by the square of the characteristic diffusion length (l) and diffusion coefficient (D) according to eqn (1):336 (1)To decrease the diffusion time, one can either increase the diffusion coefficient (e.g., by utilizing better Li+ conductor) or decrease the diffusion length (by employing nanosized electrode). The latter approach avoids changes in the battery chemistry and has a larger impact on the diffusion time because of the square relationship and has therefore attracted the attention of many researchers in recent years. One of the most effective approaches for achieving nanosized active materials is the utilization of porous electrodes. Although microporous materials with high surface areas are desirable as LIB electrodes, the high surface area also provides defects on the surface, which can increase the reactivity with the electrolyte, thus resulting in undesired side reactions, such as a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) reaction.2 Furthermore, the ionic motion in such small pores can be very slow, which would seriously limit the power density of LIBs.337 Mesoporous materials with suitable surface areas and pore sizes are an ideal alternative. The interconnected pores in mesoporous electrodes can facilitate improved electrolyte and Li-ion transport, while the mesoporous structure can accommodate the strain relaxation during the charge/discharge process.274,338
Due to the unique crystal structures of intercalated lithium compounds and multiple cations or anions, mesoporous cathodes are hard to achieve with most of them being metal oxides or metal oxide-containing materials.2 For example, LiFePO4 (LFP) has been widely commercialized as a cathode material for LIBs due to its superior cyclability and inherent safety.339 However, the low electrical conductivity of LiFeO4 (around 10−11 S cm−1 compared with 10−3 S cm−1 for LiCoO2 and 10−5 S cm−1 for LiMn2O4) has impeded its capacitive performance.340 Embedding LFP particles in porous conductive carbons has proven to be an effective way for enhancing the conductivity and improving the electrochemical performance of LFP-based cathodes.340 Owing to their large pore size, high surface area, and good conductivity, mesoporous carbons are desirable loading carriers for large-sized active materials with sizes of over 2 nm and high theoretical capacity for LIBs, such as metal or metal oxide NPs.40,143 Recently, P123-templated ordered mesoporous carbon (CMK-8) was successfully used as the host to distribute LFP NPs to produce hybrid porous cathodes for LIBs (Fig. 27a).341 The resulting hybrid with an LFP content of 50% delivered a large capacity of 178.3 mA h g−1 at a current rate of 0.2 C (higher than the theoretical capacity of LiFePO4), and long cycling stability with high capacity retention of 96.7% after 1000 cycles even at a large current density of 10 C (Fig. 27b and c). The excellent performance of this hybrid originated from the 3D cubic bicontinuous mesoporous architecture of CMK-8, which afforded a conductive skeleton for the well-distributed LFP NPs and large pores to store electrolyte, thus facilitating the rapid movement of Li ions.341

For LIBs, graphite is still the most frequently used anode material because of its low cost, good electrical conductivity, and high chemical stability. However, the low capacity of graphite (372 mA h g−1) hinders the development of high energy density LIBs.269 Mesoporous carbons are one of the most promising candidates to replace graphite as the mesoporous structure can enhance the transport of Li ions by shortening the diffusion length and providing large surface area.342 For example, Zhao et al. synthesized mesoporous carbon with spherical mesopores (∼9 nm) and high SSA (281 m2 g−1).264 The large pore volume (∼0.97 cm3 g−1) provides abundant mesopores to capture extra Li ions, thus leading to remarkable electrochemical properties as an anode material for LIBs, with high reversible capacities of 770 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1 and 255 mA h g−1 at 5 A g−1 (13.4 C).264
Kao et al. studied the effect of pore structure of two kinds of mesoporous carbons, CMK-3 with a 2D cylindrical pore structure and CMK-8 with a 3D bicontinuous architecture, on the Li-ion battery performance.343 Although these two carbon materials have comparable SSAs (1168 m2 g−1 for CMK-3 and 1131 m2 g−1 for CMK-8), CMK-8 displayed larger pore volume (1.36 cm3 g−1) and smaller charge transfer resistance (∼150 Ω) than CMK-3 (1.11 cm3 g−1 and ca. 200 Ω, respectively). This finding demonstrates that the bicontinuous mesostructure of CMK-8 enabled faster mass transport and charge transfer than CMK-3, thus affording CMK-8 with better electrochemical performance with a reversible capacity of 569 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 100 mA g−1, about 37.4% higher than that of the CMK-3 electrode.343
To pursue high energy density LIBs, porous metal oxides, such as titania, iron oxides, cobalt oxides, and nickel oxides, etc., have been prepared as anode materials in view of their high theoretical capacities.344 Among them, Ti-based oxides are of great interest because of their relatively high lithium insertion/extraction operation voltage (1.5–1.8 V vs. Li/Li+), which alleviates the formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layers and ensures the structural stability and safety of LIBs. Moreover, mesoporous Ti-based oxides (e.g., TiO2) are relatively easy to obtain by BCP-templated synthesis.13,123,199,345,346
Steiner et al. previously synthesized mesoporous TiO2 microspheres (MTMs) with tunable pore size by using BCPs of different molecular weights.123 The Pluronic P123 copolymer resulted in MTMs with relatively small mesopores (∼3 nm, MTMs-S). The PS-b-PEO copolymers with larger molecular weights produced MTMs with medium-sized (∼7 nm, MTMs-M) and large pores (∼11 nm, MTMs-L). The battery test showed that MTMs exhibited improved rate performance and capacity retention compared to TiO2 NPs. MTMs-M and MTMs-L displayed relatively higher rate performance at 10 C than MTMs-S because the larger pore space was more beneficial for achieving a faster transport of Li ions.123
Hierarchical porous structures combine the advantages of micropores (offer high specific area) and mesopores (provide large space for mass transport). Lee et al. developed combined meso-/macro-phase separation for the synthesis of hierarchically porous TiO2 with continuous macropores (<100 nm) and mesopores (14.9 nm) as well as a large SSA of 116 m2 g−1 (Fig. 27d).347 Compared with mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) with only mesopores (16.9 nm) and a similar SSA (117 m2 g−1), the highly interconnected macropores in hierarchically porous TiO2 provided enhanced wettability and facilitated mass transport of electrolyte ions, leading to a larger reversible capacity (113 mA h g−1 at 20 C) than that of m-TiO2 (15 mA h g−1 at 20 C) (Fig. 27e). Meanwhile, the hierarchically porous TiO2 also exhibited higher rate performance with a capacitance retention of 52.6% at 20 C, after the capacity values were normalized by their first discharge capacities, whereas m-TiO2 retained only 8% (Fig. 27f).347
Based on the above reports, it is clear that both porous carbons and metal oxides can be utilized as anode materials for LIBs. However, their drawbacks are also obvious; for example, mesoporous carbons are limited by their low capacity, while metal oxides suffer from low conductivity and serious aggregation during the charge/discharge process. Fortunately, the combination of mesoporous carbons with metal oxides or other compounds with high theoretical capacities to make carbon-based nanocomposite anodes provides an ideal way to overcome these barriers.135,143,278,348–350 These composite anode materials combine the good conductivity and large pore volume of porous carbon with the high capacity and rate capability of the supported materials.
Recently, Park et al. utilized N-doped ordered mesoporous carbon (N-CMK3) as a host to load SnO2 NPs and obtained the SnO2@N-CMK3 hybrid anode.350 The composite exhibited a high SSA of 347 m2 g−1 with an average pore size of 3 nm and the size of the embedded SnO2 particles was ∼3.7 nm. The resulting SnO2@N-CMK3 exhibited a high reversible capacity of 736 mA h g−1, approaching the theoretical capacity of SnO2 (782 mA h g−1). Benefiting from the high SSA of the porous N-CMK3, the transport of Li ions across the interface was accelerated, leading to a high reversible capacity of 435 mA h g−1 at a high rate of 5 C, which was superior to the theoretical capacity of commercial graphite.
It has also been found that the introduction of a certain amount of metals into metal oxide/carbon hybrids can further improve their battery performance. For instance, Lee et al. synthesized mesoporous Ge/GeO2/carbon composites with an average pore diameter of 44 nm (Fig. 27g).135 By combining carbon and additional Ge metal NPs with GeO2, the resultant Ge/GeO2/carbon hybrid displayed enhanced Coulombic efficiency, high reversible capacity (1631 mA h g−1), as well as high areal capacity (1.65 mA h cm−2) and stable cycling life (Fig. 27h and i). This excellent performance originated from the synergetic effect of the mesoporous structure and the catalytic function of Ge. Specifically, the mesostructure provided uniformly distributed pores that could buffer mechanical strain and large surface area that offered high electrode–electrolyte contact area, while the metallic Ge particles served as an electrocatalyst for Li2O decomposition and provided an electrically conductive network between the Ge metal and Li2O for the reoxidation reaction (Ge + 4.4Li = Li4.4Ge), thus increasing the overall capacity and Coulombic efficiency.135
While LIBs have been well commercialized and greatly improved people's life, the limited reserve (0.0017% in the Earth's crust), high cost (2300 $ ton−1), and uneven distribution of lithium resources have raised significant concerns about the long-term prospects of LIBs.351 Therefore, researchers have been seeking other inexpensive alkali metals to replace lithium, based on analogous electrochemical storage mechanisms.352 This began with the development of sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) and potassium-ion batteries (PIBs), which have much more natural storage (2.8% and 2.6% for Na and K, respectively) and much lower cost (200 and 1000 $ ton−1 for Na and K, respectively).351
4.1.1.2 Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). 
Compared to LIBs, SIBs exhibit an analogous mechanism during the charge/discharge operation, which involves the exchange of Na+ ions between the layered anode and a sodium intercalation compound cathode.353 However, the larger ionic radius (0.102 nm for Na+vs. 0.076 nm for Li+) and the higher molar mass (23 g mol−1 for Na vs. 7 g mol−1 for Li) of Na bring about various problems and challenges in SIBs, including slow ion diffusion kinetics, high structural stress, and difficult coordination in the host lattice.351 One of the ideal solutions is to utilize mesoporous electrodes, which can provide large pore volume to host as many as sodium ions, offer open tunnels for fast insertion/extraction of the larger sodium ions and accommodate the volume changes, thus improving the battery performance compared to other batteries utilizing microporous electrodes.199,292,304,354
For instance, Zhao et al. demonstrated the synthesis of single-layered mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets with spherical pores along with length and width of around 500 nm, and thickness of about 5.5 nm.199 These nanosheets possess high SSAs (154–210 m2 g−1), large pore volumes (0.29–0.35 cm3 g−1), uniform mesopore channels (3.8–4.1 nm) and well-crystalline anatase mesopore walls. The abundant mesopores and high accessible SSAs make the TiO2 nanosheets highly permeable for electrode–electrolyte contact externally and internally, thereby leading to rapid electrochemical reactions and providing high reversible sodium ion storage. In addition, the highly crystalline mesoporous anatase framework can effectively accommodate the volume changes during sodium insertion/extraction. Therefore, the SIBs made of these mesoporous TiO2 nanosheets displayed high discharge specific capacity of 220 mA h g−1 at 100 mA g−1, outstanding rate capability (stable reversible capacities from 0.1 to 10 A g−1), as well as excellent cycling stability (44 mA h g−1 for 10000 cycles at 10 A g−1).199 Next, they fabricated a monolayered 2D mesoporous–titania–mesoporous-carbon (C–TiO2–C) vertical heterostructure with uniform mesopore sizes (4.1 nm for carbon layer and 10.2 nm for TiO2 layer).292 This 2D heterostructure exhibited highly reversible pseudocapacitance (96.4% of total charge storage at a sweep rate of 1 mV s−1), and strong mechanical stability during rapid sodiation and desodiation processes.292 Furthermore, this group also demonstrated the coating of single-layered mesoporous TiO2 on a variety of nanomaterials, including SiO2 nanospheres, CNTs, GO, carbon nanospheres, CdS nanowires, ZnS nanosheets, and α-Fe2O3 ellipsoids.304 The ultrathin mesoporous TiO2 monolayers, in combination with their high SSAs and highly crystalline nature, allowed the accommodation of volume expansion, improved contact with electrolyte, and shortened diffusion length during sodium insertion–extraction, thereby leading to excellent rate capability (the capacity retained at about 90 mA h g−1 after 50000 cycles at 10 A g−1) and superior cyclability for sodium-ion storage (capacity stabilized at around 160 mA h g−1 after 500 cycles at 1 A g−1).304 Apart from metal oxides, mesoporous conducting polymers (e.g. polypyrrole and polyaniline) have also been reported as ideal candidates for the accommodation of large Na ions because the redox reaction in conducting polymers usually involves doping/de-doping of electrolyte anions into/from the polymer chains, which is not influenced by the cationic species.355–358 For example, Mai and colleagues synthesized 2D mesoporous polypyrrole (mPPy) nanosheets with well-defined spherical pores.293 The resultant mPPy nanosheets exhibited controlled pore sizes in the range of 6.8–13.6 nm, ultrathin thicknesses of 25–30 nm and high SSAs of up to 96 m2 g−1, which enabled the fast transport of large Na ions when used as cathode materials of SIBs. As a result, the mPPy electrode exhibited high reversible discharge capacity of 123 mA h g−1 at 50 mA g−1, and good stability with negligible capacity decay even at a high rate of 300 mA g−1, thus demonstrating the advantages of the mesoporous structure.293
4.1.1.3 Potassium-ion batteries (PIBs). 
PIBs also exhibit a typical rocking-chair working mechanism similar to LIBs and SIBs, which involves the shuttle of K+ between the cathode and the anode. Due to the violent reactivity of the K metal, it is unlikely to be directly used as an anode of PIBs. Thus, great effort has been devoted to the development of K-host materials.359,360 The main problem is that the K ion has a larger size (0.138 nm) than those of Li (0.076 nm) and Na (0.102) ions, which hinders the intercalation of K+ ions into the electrode materials and thus leads to low capacity, and poor rate performance and cyclability during the potassiation/depotassiation process.359,360 To solve this problem, Guo et al. synthesized ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with a high SSA (∼1089 m2 g−1) and uniform pore size (∼6.5 nm).361 The large mesopores increased the accessible surface area and offered more space to trap large-sized K ions. As a consequence, when employed as an anode of PIBs, the resultant OMC delivered high specific capacity of 257.4 mA h g−1 at a current density of 0.05 A g−1 and highly reversible capacity of 146.5 mA h g−1 for more than 1000 cycles at 1.0 A g−1, which was superior to those of non-porous or microporous carbon counterparts.361


4.1.2 Lithium–sulfur batteries. 
Lithium–sulfur batteries (Li–S), which usually consist of a sulfur-containing cathode, a lithium metal anode, and a porous separator, adopt an overall electrochemical reaction: S8 + 16Li ↔ 8Li2S. Building on this reaction, the anode and cathode of LSBs exhibit high theoretical capacities of 3860 and 1672 mA h g−1, respectively, providing a theoretical energy density of ∼2600 W h kg−1, which is much higher than that of LIBs (387 W h kg−1).362 In addition, the high abundance and low cost of sulfur source make Li–S batteries more competitive than LIBs. Thus, they have been considered as a promising candidate for next-generation batteries. However, there are several barriers hindering the commercial development of Li–S batteries, including the poor conductivity of the sulfur host and lithium sulfide, large volume change of sulfur during the charge/discharge process, and easy loss of dissolved polysulfide intermediates.362,363 To solve these problems, porous carbons have been widely used as host materials to fabricate carbon–sulfur cathodes due to their facile processability, high SSA, and good electrical conductivity.315,364–367 Although microporous materials can confine polysulfides in micropores to enhance the cycling stability of Li–S batteries, the lithiation/delithiation reactions of polysulfides confined in the micropores are implemented via a solid–solid mechanism, leading to higher resistance than that generated in the solid–liquid–solid process in mesoporous materials.368 Thus, most of the sulfur cathodes based on microporous structures always show lower voltage plateau (<1.0 V)368 than that of mesoporous cathodes (>1.5 V),369,370 which reduces the total energy density of the cell. Additionally, mesoporous materials with larger pore volumes can accommodate a larger amount of sulfur and achieve faster ion transport compared to microporous materials. Therefore, mesoporous materials have been regarded as prospective cathode materials for Li–S batteries.
A typical example of a carbon–sulfur cathode was achieved by infusing sulfur into ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) with cylindrical pores, a large pore volume of 2.32 cm3 g−1, and a high SSA of 2445 m2 g−1 (Fig. 28a and b).364 Interestingly, the resulting sulfur-incorporated OMC possessed a bimodal pore distribution with peaks at 6.0 nm and 3.1 nm. The large pore volume and connected channels of the prepared OMC enabled adequate sulfur loading and facilitated complete redox reactions of the active material, while the small pores with strong adsorption capability for polysulfides could maintain a stable cycling performance.371 As a result, the synthesized C–S hybrid with a high sulfur content of 70 wt% could achieve a high reversible discharge capacity of 1070 mA h g−1 and retained 65.4% of the initial capacitance after more than 100 cycles at 1 C (Fig. 28c).364

3D interconnected networks with uniform pores are highly desirable for high-performance Li–S batteries compared to cylindrical pores which typically exhibit only 1D continuity. For example, a bicontinuous double-gyroid carbon material with bimodal pores (1 and 20 nm) and large SSA (885 m2 g−1) was previously employed as a sulfur host to obtain C–S composite cathode materials for Li–S batteries (Fig. 28d and e).372 The bimodal porous structure promoted high sulfur loading as well as the trapping of lithium polysulfides in the narrow micropores. Furthermore, the 3D ordered mesopores provided uniform accessibility of sulfur for the diffused Li ions throughout the structure. Therefore, LSBs assembled with such a gyroidal carbon cathode displayed a high discharge capacity of 800 mA h g−1 with good cyclability for more than 200 cycles and good rate performance with a high discharge capacity of 400 mA h g−1 at 1 C (Fig. 28f).372

4.2 Supercapacitors
As an important category of energy storage devices, supercapacitors (SCs) or electrochemical capacitors show some advantages over batteries, including high power density, long cycling life, wide working temperature range, and better safety at high rates.3,61 Typically, SCs are made of two electrodes, an electrolyte, and a membrane separator, which separates the two electrodes from the electrolyte. Active materials are important part of electrodes in SCs and the general method for the construction of electrodes is casting the slurry consisting of active materials, conductive additives (carbon black) and binders on the current collector (e.g., Ni foam, Al foil or carbon cloth). The specific capacitance of a SC is governed by the equation:195 C = ε0εrAe/d(2)where Ae is the surface area of the electrode, d is the distance between the pair of electrodes, ε0 is the permittivity of free space, εr is the relative permittivity of the dielectric material. For SCs, d is not a major variable, thus enlarging Ae is the primary pathway for increasing the capacitance and energy density of SCs. Mesoporous materials are known for their high SSA (i.e., high Ae) and hence they are desirable as electrode materials for SCs.195,333
Although microporous materials have large surface areas, many of them show low capacitive performance compared to their mesoporous counterparts.329–331,337,373,374 This is because of the fact that many inner micropores are closed or exhibit narrow bottle-necks, which are difficult to immerse by the electrolyte, leading to the poor utilization of the surface area.328,337 The large mesopores of mesoporous materials are favorable achieving fast ion diffusion (especially large-sized ions) at high current densities and efficient utilization of SSAs. Moreover, some studies showed evidence that micropores smaller than 0.5 nm are not accessible to hydrated ions and that even pores under 1 nm might be too small, especially in the case of organic electrolytes, where the size of the solvated ions is larger than 1 nm.375 Therefore, most mesoporous materials have higher accessible SSAs and thus show better capacitive performance with higher energy and power densities compared to their microporous counterparts.
In SCs, charge storage and release occur at the interface between the electrode and electrolyte and there are two mechanisms for energy storage and release in SCs.325 One is the non-Faradaic process in which no chemical redox reaction occurs and only physical charge separation originated from ionic adsorption or desorption takes place. The non-faradaic process is fast and durable. In contrast, the Faradaic process involves redox reactions at the surface of the electrode and electrons are transferred to or from the cathode or anode. This process is slower compared with the non-Faradaic process. Accordingly, SCs can be divided into two classical categories: electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs) that follow the non-Faradaic mechanism, and pseudocapacitors which obey the Faradaic principle.325

4.2.1 Electrochemical double-layer capacitors. 
Porous carbon materials are classical electrodes for EDLCs. Previously, Wu and co-workers fabricated mesoporous carbon materials with highly ordered bcc mesostructures as well as uniform pore diameter of 3.2 nm and high SSAs between 311 and 637 m2 g−1 (Fig. 29a).329 The cyclic voltammogram of the mesoporous carbon exhibited a rectangular-shaped pattern, which is a typical characteristic of EDLCs (Fig. 29b). At a sweep rate of 10 mV s−1, the specific capacitance of the OMC was 159 F g−1, higher than that of commercial activated carbon (145 F g−1) (Fig. 29c). The enhanced capacitive performance of the OMC was attributed to its ordered mesoporous structure. Unlike OMC, commercial activated carbon contained a large proportion of internalized disordered micropores. The inner micropores could hardly be accessed by the electrolyte due to the lack of suitable pathways for ion diffusion, leading to poor utilization of the inner pores of the materials.329 Further, many studies have focused on the influence of pore size on the capacitance of EDLCs.7,8 The specific capacitance of the OMC was decreased sharply with the increase of average pore diameter from 0.6 to 1 nm but increased linearly when the average pore size was enlarged from 1 to 5 nm and remained constant as the average pore size was enlarged further from 5 to 50 nm. When pores (>2 nm) in electrode materials are larger than twice the dimension of the solvated electrolyte ions, the contribution to capacitance is from the compact layers of ions residing on both adjacent pore walls. Therefore, the capacitance is positively associated with the surface area of porous electrode materials. By decreasing the pore size (1–2 nm) to less than twice the solvated ion size, the compact ion layers from neighboring pore walls became impinged and the surface area usable for the double-layer formation was reduced, which accounted for the decrease of specific capacitance with pore size. However, after decreasing the pore size (<1 nm) to a value approaching the crystallographic diameter of the ion, the solvation shell of ion becomes highly distorted as the ion is squeezed through the pore. Such distortion would allow closer approach of the ion center to the electrode surface, thereby improving the specific capacitance.

Carbon materials with cylindrical pores have also been studied as electrode materials of EDLCs. For instance, highly ordered mesoporous carbon with horizontally aligned (cylindrical) mesopore arrays was used as film-like electrodes in microsupercapacitors.376 The mesoporous carbon (Fig. 29d) had average pore size of 10 nm, SSA of 650 m2 g−1, and pore volume of 0.76 cm3 g−1. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) curves of the sample displayed nearly rectangular shapes, indicating the efficient EDLC behavior (Fig. 29e). This OMC displayed a specific capacitance of 163 F g−1 at a current density of 0.2 A g−1 and maintained >90% of the initial capacitance after 20000 cycles at 1 V s−1. The sample also exhibited good rate capability with a specific capacitance of 94 F g−1 at a high current density of 100 A g−1. Compared to OMC with a spherical pore structure, the OMC with cylindrical pores exhibited a higher power density of 242 W cm−3 (Fig. 29f), because the parallel-aligned mesopores could provide pathways with lengths of over hundreds of nanometers, which facilitated the rapid movement of charge carriers in the material.376
The application of carbon materials with bicontinuous structures as electrode materials for EDLCs has been also documented. For example, previously reported bicontinuous mesoporous carbon with an Iad symmetry exhibited a uniform pore size of 3.8 nm, pore volume of 1.178 cm3 g−1, and high SSA of 992 m2 g−1 (Fig. 29g).377 This bicontinuous mesoporous carbon showed relatively flat, rectangular-shaped CV curves (Fig. 29h), which are typical features of EDLCs. The bicontinuous mesoporous carbon showed a specific capacitance of 113 F g−1 at a scan rate of 5 mV s−1, which was higher than that (87 F g−1) of the control sample with cylindrical mesopores (pore size of 3.8 nm and SSA of 554 m2 g−1) (Fig. 29i). The higher capacitance was primarily contributed by the larger surface area arising from the 3D continuous pore structure. In addition, the bicontinuous structure helped to prevent the mesostructure from collapsing during the charge/discharge process, thus affording the mesoporous carbon outstanding cycling stability.377


4.2.2 Pseudocapacitors. 
Unlike EDLCs, the charge storage mechanism of pseudocapacitors is based on the reversible redox reactions on the surface of the active materials.195 Pseudocapacitors usually exhibit much higher capacitance than EDLCs. As of now, the developed electrode materials for pseudocapacitors are mainly based on transition metal oxides and hydroxides, metal sulfides, conducting polymers, and so on.61,378 N-doped carbon materials are among the most commonly studied electrode materials, in which the doping of nitrogen atoms can improve the capacitive performance of carbon materials owing to the enhancement of wettability and the additional supply of pseodocapacitance.96,379 For example, Mai's group synthesized a library of N-doped mesoporous carbon nanospheres (MCNSs) with different pore sizes using PS-b-PEO copolymers as soft templates (Fig. 30a).9 By changing the length of the PS block, the average pore diameter could be tuned in the range of 8–38 nm, which resulted in controllable SSAs of 229–450 m2 g−1 and pore volumes of 0.50–0.96 cm3 g−1. The optimized MCNS sample (MCNS-60) showed the highest specific capacitance of 350 F g−1 at a current density of 0.1 A g−1 in 1 M H2SO4, which was much higher than that of undoped carbon nanospheres. MCNS-60 also exhibited good capacitance retention as a high specific capacitance of 200 F g−1 could still be retained at a high current density of 2.0 A g−1 (Fig. 30b). The lack of apparent capacitance loss after 10000 cycles at a high current density of 10 A g−1 indicated the outstanding cycling stability of the MCNSs (Fig. 30c). In addition, this work systematically studied the influence of large mesopore size (>5 nm) on the capacitive performance of MCNSs and demonstrated that their specific capacitance decreased linearly with increasing pore diameter, while the normalized capacitance by SSA remained nearly unchanged, revealing the relationship between the specific capacitance and average pore size of porous carbons.9

Recently, N-doped carbon materials with cylindrical pores were employed as electrode materials for pseudocapacitors (Fig. 30d).380 The porous carbon had uniform pore diameter of 3.2 nm, large pore volume of 1 cm3 g−1, and high SSA of 1152 m2 g−1. It exhibited 43% capacitance retention when the current density was increased from 0.1 to 20 A g−1 (Fig. 30e). Such a rapid decrease in capacitance was attributed to the kinetic limitation of Faradaic reactions at high current densities, indicating a pseudocapacitive effect, which is different from EDLCs. Furthermore, the specific capacitance of the material reached 200 F g−1 at 1 A g−1, with 98% capacitance retention after 5000 charge–discharge cycles (Fig. 30f).380
Bicontinuous structures with highly ordered mesostructures and total continuity in all three dimensions can provide exceptional mass transport and minimize blockage of the channels in porous SC electrode materials. For instance, mesoporous carbon with a gyroid structure was previously synthesized (Fig. 30g).381 After nitric acid treatment, the surface of the mesoporous carbon was functionalized with nitrogen and oxygen-containing groups, which contributed pseudocapacitance to enhance the overall capacitance of the mesoporous carbon. The gyroidal mesoporous carbon had average pore diameter of 4.8 nm, large pore volume of 1.38 cm3 g−1 and high SSA of 1321 m2 g−1, leading to a high specific capacitance of 239 F g−1 at a current density of 2.4 A g−1 with good rate capability (74% capacitance retention) at a high current density of 6.25 A g−1 (Fig. 30h and i).381
Many transition metal oxides show pseudocapacitive behavior and they have been widely utilized as pseudocapacitor electrodes.382 For instance, Steiner's group reported a vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) electrode with a bicontinuous double-gyroid structure, exhibiting 11.0 nm wide struts and high specific surface to volume ratio of 161.4 μm−1.383 The V2O5 electrode displayed a high initial capacitance of 442 F g−1 at a high current density of 10 A g−1 in 1.0 M LiClO4 propylene carbonate electrolyte, which eventually stabilized at 155 F g−1 after 10 charge–discharge cycles. The high capacitance was contributed by the fast and efficient ion intercalation/extraction in the bicontinuous V2O5 electrode and the consequent Faradaic surface reactions.
Most recently, Mai and colleagues developed a universal interfacial self-assembly strategy for fabricating 2D nanohybrids with in-plane cylindrical pores.12 They patterned 2D polymers (e.g., PPy, polyaniline, and polydopamine) with cylindrical mesopores on graphene nanosheets to obtain mesoporous electrodes for planar microsupercapacitors (MSCs). The prepared 2D sandwich-like nanohybrids possessed average mesopore diameter of ∼12 nm, uniform thickness of ∼26 nm, and high SSA of 157 m2 g−1. Using mesoporous PPy/rGO (mPPy/rGO) nanosheets as an example, they exhibited cylindrical pores which could offer in-plane pathways in 2D porous materials (Fig. 31a and b). Therefore, the mPPy/rGO nanosheets exhibited a higher ion diffusion coefficient (6.8 × 10−8 cm2 s−1) than PPy/rGO nanosheets with spherical pores or without pores. The interdigitated microelectrode, which was assembled from the combination of mPPy/rGO nanosheets and a H2SO4/polyvinyl alcohol gel electrolyte via mask-assisted filtration,384 possessed a valid electrode area of 1.12 cm2 and an average thickness of 7.1 μm (Fig. 31c). Benefiting from the large SSA and fast in-plane ion transport, the electrode delivered outstanding volumetric capacitance (102 F cm−3 at 1 mV s−1) (Fig. 31d), high energy density (2.3 mW h cm−3), and power density (500 mW cm−3), outperforming some commercial energy storage devices (2.75 V/44 mF and 5.5 V/100 mF, <1 mW h cm−3).385–387 Furthermore, the MSC showed excellent flexibility as it could retain 90% of its initial capacitance at a bending angle of 180° (Fig. 31e) and ca. 86% of its initial capacitance after continuous bending from 0° to 90° for over 3000 cycles (Fig. 31f).12

4.3 Catalysts
Heterogeneous catalysis in the presence of electrocatalysts or photocatalysts has been considered as one of the most important research fields for energy conversion. The intrinsic properties of the catalysts, such as SSA, pore structure, particle size, and geometrical shape, greatly influence their catalytic performance.194,388 In recent years, BCP-templated mesoporous materials have proven to be promising heterogeneous electrocatalysts or photocatalysts due to their abundant catalytic sites. In this subsection, we discuss the applications of BCP-templated mesoporous materials as photocatalysts and electrocatalysts.

4.3.1 Electrocatalytic oxygen reduction. 
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a key process in fuel cells (FCs), which generate electricity by electrochemical reduction of oxygen and oxidation of hydrogen.389 The ORR process involves an oxygen diffusion cathode and reduction reaction that occurred on the surface of the electrocatalyst. Thus, the rational design of porous materials with high surface area and superior mass transport properties can lead to enhanced ORR performance. Mesoporous materials can provide better mass transport of protons and O2 molecules to the active sites, which is not easily achieved by microporous materials due to the small openings (1–2 nm).390,391 Furthermore, in mesoporous materials, the produced H2O2 can be released within a relatively short contact time due to the favorable mass transport in the mesoporous structure, thus leading to better selectivity to H2O2 in ORR compared to micropore-dominant materials.330
Although platinum (Pt)-based materials exhibit high activity for the ORR, the low abundance, high cost, and poor stability of Pt greatly impede the wide application Pt-based electrocatalysts for FCs.389,392 Therefore, enormous efforts have been devoted to developing alternative non-platinum ORR electrocatalysts for FCs with low cost and high efficiency.388,393
One effective way is to fabricate Pt-based electrocatalysts by reducing the usage of Pt while maintaining the catalytic performance, including synthesizing mesoporous Pt catalysts with larger SSAs or fabricating Pt-based alloys by doping other metals.21,200 For example, Yamauchi's group reported the controllable synthesis of mesoporous Pt nanospheres by using F127 as a pore-creating agent (Fig. 32a).226 The resulting mesoporous Pt spheres exhibited an average pore diameter of 11 nm, leading to a high electrocatalytic activity with a half-wave potential of 0.88 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE, all the reference potentials are vs. RHE unless specifically noted), which is more positive than those of Pt/C-20% (0.84 V) and Pt black (0.78 V) (Fig. 32b). As the well-defined mesoporous structure was less vulnerable to particle aggregation, the mesoporous Pt nanospheres showed excellent structural thermostability and retained most of their electrochemically active surface area after thermal treatment, in stark contrast to the low thermal stability of other Pt-based NPs due to the structural shrinkage.226

Another possible strategy to reduce the cost of the catalysts is to use non-precious metal catalysts. Carbon-based materials, which combine the advantages of both non-precious-metal containing materials and mesoporous carbons, have proven to be effective ORR electrocatalysts.40,394 For example, Mai and colleagues prepared 2D sandwich-like mesoporous N-doped carbon/Fe3O4/rGO (mNC–Fe3O4@rGO) nanohybrids with a uniform pore size of 13 nm (Fig. 32c).11 Benefiting from the high SSA (373 m2 g−1) and fast mass transport induced by the introduction of mesopores, the mNC–Fe3O4@rGO nanohybrids displayed a high half-wave-potential of 0.84 V and a limiting current density of 5.7 mA cm−2, which are well comparable to those of the best commercial Pt/C catalyst (Fig. 32d).11 In addition to doping metal oxides, other dopants, such as metal hydrates, metal carbides, non-noble metals or their alloys (e.g., Pd, PdCo alloy), among others, have also been incorporated into mesoporous carbon materials as high performance ORR catalysts.233,395 Particularly, a family of mesoporous Co-/N-doped or Fe-/N-doped carbon catalysts have been recently developed.396–399 For example, Yamauchi et al. previously synthesized ordered mesoporous Fe-/N-doped carbons (Fe–N/C) possessing spherical pores with an average pore diameter of ∼7.7 nm (Fig. 32e).236 Due to the high content of pyridinic nitrogen (0.96 at%), high SSA (1643 m2 g−1), and large pore volume (1.54 cm3 g−1), the obtained Fe–N/C material showed excellent ORR performance with high onset potential of 1.02 V, half-wave potential of 0.87 V, and limited-diffusion current density of 5.98 mA cm−2 (Fig. 32f).236
Alternatively, by doping a single heteroatom (e.g., N, P, S) or multiple heteroatoms into mesoporous carbon, improved ORR performance can be efficiently achieved since the heteroatom dopants can change the chemisorption of reactants and tune the chemical activity of the electrocatalyst.400–402 Among various heteroatom-doped electrocatalysts, N-doped carbons have been extensively studied in recent years since the first report by Dai and co-workers on the synthesis of N-doped carbon nanotubes as potential electrocatalysts for the ORR.403 Yamauchi's group previously reported the synthesis of N-doped mesoporous carbon spheres (NMCSs) with nitrogen content ranging between 7.3–7.7 wt% (Fig. 33a).220 By increasing the PS block length of PS-b-PEO copolymers, the pore diameter of the NMCSs could be expanded from 5 to 16 nm, while the SSA was decreased from 363 to 343 m2 g−1. The large mesopores and small dimensions (∼200 nm) of the NMCSs contributed to the mass transport by reducing and smoothing the diffusion pathways, leading to high ORR electrocatalytic activity with onset potential of −0.11 V (vs. Ag/AgCl) and maximum current density of 6.2 mA cm−2 at a rotation rate of 1600 rpm in 0.1 M KOH (Fig. 33b).220

To investigate the effect of the pore structure of N-doped carbon on the ORR performance, Mai and co-workers coated mesoporous N-doped carbon layers with spherical or cylindrical pores on graphene nanosheets (denoted as mNC–rGO–S and mNC–rGO–C, respectively) (Fig. 33c).404 The resulting 2D porous nanocomposites possessed similar N doping contents of ∼2.6 wt%, average pore sizes of ∼8 nm, and SSAs of ∼420 m2 g−1. They demonstrated that the ion diffusion coefficient of the N-doped carbon nanosheets with cylindrical pores was approximately four times higher than that of their counterpart with spherical pores. Therefore, the former exhibited superior ORR catalytic performance in 0.1 M KOH, with half-wave-potential of +0.74 V and limiting current density of 4.8 mA cm−2 (Fig. 33d), comparable with those of commercial Pt/C catalyst.404
Furthermore, this group also synthesized N-doped mesoporous carbon nanosheets (NMCSs) and nanoflowers (NMCFs) with holey mesopores to study the influence of the packing mode of carbon nanosheets on their ORR performance (Fig. 33e).291 The resulting NMCSs and NMCFs possessed similar holey pores (14 nm and 15 nm), SSAs (256 m2 g−1 and 266 m2 g−1) and nitrogen contents (4.2 wt% and 4.4 wt%). The presence of holey pores enabled more efficient utilization of the active sites buried in the packing space of NMHCSs, thus leading to more positive half-wave potential (E1/2 = 0.77 V) and higher limiting current density (JL = 5.0 mA cm−2) in 0.1 M KOH, outperforming those of N-doped carbon sheets lacking holey pores (E1/2 = 0.67 V, JL = 4.0 mA cm−2) (Fig. 33f). Nevertheless, the holey pores would inevitably be partially blocked after the random stacking of porous carbon nanosheets. This problem can be avoided by the 3D packing pattern of holey porous carbon nanosheets in NMCFs, which enabled the direct cross-plane mass diffusion so that significantly more active sites could be accessible to oxygen and electrolyte, leading to better ORR performance of NMCFs (E1/2 = 0.8 V and JL = 5.5 mA cm−2). This study unveiled the influence of the packing mode of 2D porous carbon nanomaterials on their ORR performance, which would be helpful for designing novel porous materials as high-performance ORR catalysts.291


4.3.2 Electrocatalysts for water splitting. 
4.3.2.1 Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
As one of the most renewable and clean energy carriers, hydrogen has been perceived as an ideal long-term solution to both energy crisis and environmental problems.388,405,406 However, the traditional strategies to mass produce hydrogen, including steam reforming of fossil fuels, such as natural gas, petroleum, and coal, generate significant carbon emission and require high energy consumption. Since the coining of the term “hydrogen economy” by General Motors engineers in 1970, numerous studies have been performed with the major focus on developing advanced techniques to produce hydrogen economically from clean and sustainable resources. Among various technologies, electrocatalytic water splitting represents one of the most promising solutions for producing hydrogen without environmental pollution.405
Although platinum-based materials are known as the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts for HER, their high cost and scarcity prevent their scale-up applications.388 Recently, molybdenum-based materials (e.g., molybdenum-based oxides,407 carbides,408 sulfides,409 and phosphates410) have been considered as one of the potential substitutes for Pt-based catalysts because of their low cost, optimal hydrogen adsorption energy, and electronic density of states resembling those of Pt-based materials.405 However, the poor conductivity and strong aggregation of Mo-based NPs typically lead to large impedance and reduction of active sites, which lower the HER performance. To solve these problems, making porous catalysts with high conductivity or combining NPs with porous conductive substrates can be effective because the introduction of the porous structure can increase the SSA of materials to expose more active sites and afford space to reserve electrolytes.2
Recently, Mai's group fabricated 2D sandwich-like mesoporous N-doped carbon/Mo2C/rGO nanohybrids with well-defined spherical pores (denoted as mNC–Mo2C@rGO) (Fig. 34a).294 The mNC–Mo2C@rGO nanosheets possessed high nitrogen contents (4.2–5.2 at%), suitable pore sizes (ca. 13 nm in diameter), large SSAs (389 m2 g−1) as well as good distribution of small Mo2C NPs (4 nm average diameter). The content of the Mo2C NPs is tunable by adjusting the feed amount of Mo7O246−, which was estimated to be 18.4 wt% for mNC–Mo2C@rGO-1, 28.0 wt% for mNC–Mo2C@rGO-2 and 42.4 wt% for mNC–Mo2C@rGO-3, respectively. The unique structure and suitable loading content of Mo2C NPs afforded the nanohybrid with excellent HER catalytic activity which was comparable to that of commercial Pt/C catalyst in 1.0 M KOH electrolyte, with small overpotential of 95 mV at 10 mA cm−2, Tafel slope of 49.8 mV dec−1, and excellent stability at 20 mA cm−2 for 60 hours (Fig. 34b and c).294

In another example, Suib et al. prepared mesoporous molybdenum oxide (mMoO3−x) with large accessible pores (20–40 nm in diameter).411 The resultant mMoO3−x had a much larger SSA (52 m2 g−1) than the commercial MoO3 (2.0 m2 g−1), thus allowing for the exposure of more active sites to facilitate hydrogen production in alkaline solution. Benefiting from the mesoporous structure, the mMoO3−x only required a low overpotential (∼0.14 V) to achieve a current density of 10 mA cm−2 in 0.1 M KOH, with a low Tafel slope of 56 mV dec−1 (comparable to that of Pt/C catalyst) and good stability for more than 12 hours at a large current density.411
4.3.2.2 Electrocatalytic oxygen evolution. 
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), another half reaction of electrocatalytic water splitting, typically involves a multi-electron reaction pathway (4OH− → O2 + 4e− + 2H2O in alkaline media or 2H2O → 4H+ + O2 + 4e− in acidic media), making the need for highly efficient electrocatalysts more urgent than that for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).388,412 To date, various catalysts, such as iron (Fe), cobalt (Co), nickel (Ni), their alloys (Ni–Co, Ni–Fe, Ni–Mo), oxides, nitrides and carbides, have been utilized as electrocatalysts for OER.412 Although these non-precious metal-based catalysts possess several advantages over the benchmark IrO2 or RuO2 catalysts in terms of price and abundance, they still underperform in terms of both activity and stability.
The utilization of a porous IrO2 or RuO2 catalyst for the OER can lower the cost of the catalyst by reducing the usage of these expensive materials, while enhancing the catalytic efficiency by increasing the SSA.413 For instance, Kraehnert et al. synthesized mesoporous IrO2 film with spherical pores with an average pore diameter of ∼16 nm and a high SSA of 140 m2 g−1.127 Compared with non-porous IrO2 film, the optimized mesoporous IrO2 film exhibited improved catalytic performance for OER with low overpotentials of about 0.21 V at 0.5 mA cm−2 and 1.58 V at 100 mA cm−2.127
Furthermore, ultrathin Ir-based or Ru-based nanosheets with mesopores can improve the catalytic performance by increasing the SSA and improving accessibility to active sites. To this end, Yamauchi's group synthesized mesoporous Ir nanosheets with average diameter of 15 nm and SSA of 42 m2 g−1 as an electrocatalyst for OER (Fig. 34d).198 The mesoporous Ir nanosheets with abundant catalytically active sites exhibited excellent activity for OER with small onset potential of 1.41 V, low Tafel slope (49 mV dec−1), and very low overpotential (1.5 V) at 10 mA cm−2, superior to those of commercial Ir black and IrO2 (Fig. 34e and f).198


4.3.3 Photocatalysts for water splitting. 
4.3.3.1 Photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. 
Photocatalytic water splitting is another promising strategy achieving the scalable and efficient production of hydrogen.414,415 In 1972, Fujishima and Honda discovered that TiO2 could function as a photoanode under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to decompose H2O into H2 and O2, thus opening a whole new area of photoelectrochemical water splitting.416 Since then, TiO2 has been regarded as a promising photocatalyst for water splitting.417,418 Although various TiO2-based photocatalysts for water splitting have been developed in the past few decades, they still suffer from the drawbacks of fast recombination of photogenerated electron–hole pairs and undesirable crystallites and architectures.419,420 Fortunately, these drawbacks can be overcome by constructing ordered mesoporous structures.
For instance, Zhao and colleagues reported the synthesis of ordered mesoporous black TiO2 (OMBT) with a 2D hexagonal mesostructure possessing average pore diameter of ∼9.6 nm, large pore volume (0.24 cm3 g−1), and highly crystalline anatase pore walls (Fig. 35a).137 The prepared mesoporous black TiO2 exhibited a high SSA of 124 m2 g−1, higher than the SSAs of many previously reported TiO2 black materials with irregular NPs (<50 m2 g−1). The porous structure is rather important for hydrogenation as it provided a high surface area to facilitate H2 gas diffusion into TiO2 and promote interactions with its inner skeleton. Furthermore, the ordered mesostructure was sufficiently stable that it could be retained during the phase transition (from anatase to rutile) and crystal growth processes and during hydrogenation at 500 °C. The unique advantages of the mesoporous structure enabled OMBT to extend the photoresponse of the UV light to visible and infrared light regions, leading to a very high photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 136.2 μmol h−1, which was about two times higher than that of pristine OMT (76.6 μmol h−1) (Fig. 35b). Additionally, many other strategies, such as changing the structural parameters (e.g., size, shape, crystallinity, and porosity) of TiO2-based materials, have been used to improve the catalytic performance.137

Many niobium-based compounds (e.g., Nb2O5, Sr2Nb2O7, NiNbO3) have been reported to be effective photocatalysts for splitting water into H2 and O2 due to their beneficial electronic configuration (d0 or d10).421 For example, Lin et al. synthesized mesoporous Nb2O5 with cylindrical pores of ∼7.7 nm.422 Due to the abundant active sites provided by its large SSA (108 m2 g−1), the synthesized mesoporous Nb2O5 exhibited a high generation rate of H2 (328 μmol h−1 g−1), nearly 39 times higher than that of non-porous Nb2O5 (Fig. 35c). The photocatalytic performance could be further improved by orders of magnitude by loading various metals or metal oxides (e.g., Pt, Au, Cu, and NiO) into mesoporous Nb2O5 as co-catalysts. The mesoporous structure allowed these NPs to be well-distributed throughout the structure. Moreover, these metal NPs with strong negative potentials could significantly enhance the photocatalytic efficiency for the water splitting reaction.422
4.3.3.2 Photocatalytic oxygen evolution. 
Photocatalysts for water oxidation (or oxygen evolution) have also been investigated to improve the whole catalytic efficiency of photocatalytic water splitting.388,423 In this field, noble-metal NPs (e.g., Au and Ag) combined with mesoporous semiconducting catalysts (e.g., TiO2, CeO2, and WO3) are ideal candidates to achieve high performance for photochemical water splitting.414 First, semiconducting catalysts with mesoporous structures can improve the transport of liquid educts and gaseous products into and out of the mesopores.Second, the incorporation of noble metal NPs into mesoporous catalysts can maximize the binding of reactants (such as water) and catalytic centers as well as shorten the diffusion distance of excitons.114,164 For instance, He et al. prepared mesoporous tungsten oxide/Au NP (mWO3/AuNP) hybrid catalysts possessing spherical pores with mean pore size of 25 nm and wall thickness of 18 nm (Fig. 35d).114 When used as photocatalysts for water oxidation testing under visible light (λ > 400 nm), the mesostructured WO3 catalyst kinetically enhanced the production rate of O2, reaching a high amount of ∼5.8 mmol molW−1 after 4 minutes, which was nearly twice that of non-porous WO3 (∼3.0 mmol molW−1) (Fig. 35e). The moderate loading (∼0.1 wt%) of Au NPs in the prepared mesoporous WO3 maximized the binding of reactants (e.g., water) with catalytic centers and shortened the exciton diffusion distance, thereby further improving the yield of O2 up to ∼13 mmol molW−1 after testing for 4 minutes, outperforming previously reported values.424,425 Furthermore, the slope of the O2 generation curve sharply increased and the turnover frequency (TOF) of mWO3/AuNP-8 (0.1%) peaked at 6.73 × 10−5 s−1 (Fig. 35f), approximately four times higher than that of the pristine mesoporous WO3 catalyst.114

4.4 Solar cells
Solar cells, which can directly convert solar energy into electrical energy through the photovoltaic effect, are one of the most promising energy conversion devices for the production of clean and sustainable energy.426 Apart from traditional crystalline silicon solar cells, the emerging dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted tremendous interest as the third-generation solar cells, due to their high conversion efficiency, facile fabrication, and environmental friendliness.

4.4.1 Dye-sensitized solar cells. 
In a typical DSSC,426 a dense TiO2 layer (hole blocking layer) and a mesoporous semiconducting layer (e.g., TiO2, CeO2, ZnO, NiO) are sequentially deposited on the conductive substrate as a photoanode, followed by adsorption of dye molecules and then the electrolyte is filled into the device. Subsequently, the mesoporous catalyst (as a counter electrode) is deposited on a conductive substrate for the electrocatalytic reduction of the electrolyte. High-performance DSSCs rely on a high interfacial area as charge carriers are generated only in the chemisorbed monolayer of the photoactive dye.153 Mesoporous semiconducting materials, such as TiO2, show great potential in DSSCs, because their high surface area enables the large-scale adsorption of dyes, which promotes the photogeneration of charge carriers and effectively reduces the charge recombination rate. In 1991, O’Regan and Grätzel fabricated a mesoporous TiO2 film with a thickness of 10 μm as a photoanode for a DSSC which achieved a high conversion efficiency of 7.9%, 1000-fold higher than that of the non-porous TiO2 film.427 The high efficiency is contributed by the sufficient dye adsorption on the surface of the mesoporous TiO2 film and the close bond between the monomolecular dye and the semiconductor film, which facilitated the trapping of light and increased the efficiency of electron injection. Benefiting from the large pore size and high pore volume, mesoporous TiO2 also allows for effective post-deposition of semiconductor nanomaterials with a small bandgap inside the large, open mesopores, which is hard to achieve by micropores. For instance, Zhao et al. deposited cadmium sulfide quantum dots (5 nm in diameter) in mesoporous TiO2, leading to excellent photoelectrochemical performance, with optimized photocurrent density of 6.03 mA cm−1 and high photoconversion efficiency of 3.9%.428 Later, mesoporous photoanodes synthesized by BCP templates were reported for their capability for increasing the efficiency and long-term stability of DSSCs owing to the precise control of pore size, pore structure, and crystallinity.145,429–434
Liu et al. demonstrated the utilization of mesoporous TiO2 microspheres with cylindrical pores as the photoanode.435 The TiO2 spheres (800 nm in average diameter) had radially oriented hexagonal mesochannels and highly crystalline anatase walls with uniform pore size of 5.5 nm, large accessible SSA (112 m2 g−1), and large pore volume (0.164 cm3 g−1) (Fig. 36a). The assembled DSSC employing the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres as the photoanode film exhibited high short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of ∼22.91 mA cm−2 and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of ∼0.75 V, leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ∼12.1% (Fig. 36b). In sharp contrast, the PCEs of DSSCs assembled using bulk and commercial TiO2 were ∼7.6 and 6.8%, respectively. The higher performance was ascribed to the larger SSA of the mesoporous TiO2, which enabled the loading of twice the amount of dyes compared with the bulk and commercial TiO2. In addition, the DSSC assembled using the mesoporous TiO2 microspheres showed good reliability verified by 15 individual solar cells, with a relatively close average PCE value of ∼12.1%.435

Metal oxides with bicontinuous porous structures can serve as highly porous photoanodes with extraordinary advantages in DSSCs. For example, Snaith and colleagues employed a mesoporous TiO2 film with a gyroid structure as a photoanode material.153 Compared to the traditional TiO2 nanoparticle-based film, the mesoporous TiO2 film with a 3D continuous network of anatase TiO2 possessed higher porosity (61 vol%), larger internal SSA (161 m2 g−1), and larger pore size (21 nm in diameter), thus enabling high dye-loading capacity (Fig. 36c). The bicontinuous TiO2 as a photoanode proved to be highly effective in solid-state DSSCs (Fig. 36d), with high Jsc of 7.9 mA cm−2, Voc of 0.81 V, and PCE of 5.0%, which is 16% higher than those of standard optimized TiO2 nanoparticle-based device.153


4.4.2 Perovskite solar cells. 
As one of the most promising devices derived from DSSCs, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have a similar working principle to DSSCs.436–438 The perovskite absorber performs the functions of light absorption and long-range charge transport, thereby eliminating the need for mesoporous semiconductors. Under illumination, the perovskite loaded in the porous scaffold generates electron–hole pairs, and then the electrons and holes are transported into the electron transport layer (e.g., compact TiO2) and the hole-transporting material, respectively. A number of advantages, including strong solar absorption and low non-radiative carrier recombination rates, endow perovskites with high performance for PSCs.436,438
Porous materials (e.g., TiO2, Al2O3) have been utilized as scaffolds to confine the growth of perovskite pigments.439 For example, an interconnected porous structure with uniform pore size was previously used for the loading of perovskites.440 Perovskite layers were prepared on the top of the porous TiO2 layer and the as-formed perovskite crystals were confined in the pores of TiO2. The porous morphology of TiO2 with large pore size, high porosity, and good interconnectivity could facilitate the penetration of perovskites. By varying the pore size (30–70 nm) and film thickness (300–800 nm) of the porous TiO2 layer, the optimum device performance was obtained with a mean pore size of 70 nm and a film thickness of 300 nm, which resulted in an excellent PCE of 11.9%. Furthermore, the performance of mesoporous TiO2 films for PSCs can be improved by doping. For example, Nd-doped mesoporous TiO2 electrodes with uniform pore size of 33 nm and thickness of 150 nm were used for the loading of perovskite pigments.124,125 Substitutional Nd-doping increased the electron transport and reduced charge recombination in the mesoporous TiO2, leading to much enhanced stability and performance of PSCs. The optimized doping concentration of 0.3% Nd endowed the PSC with a Voc of 1.13 V, a Jsc of 22.3 mA cm−2, and a stabilized PCE of >18%. The replacement of mesoporous TiO2 with an insulating Al2O3 scaffold has proven to increase the open-circuit voltage of the PSC device because the deep electron traps in non-stoichiometric TiO2 could reduce the splitting of the quasi-Fermi levels under illumination. For example, a series of methylammonium lead tri-iodide/chloride perovskites loaded in mesoporous Al2O3 have been utilized in PSCs, which resulted in apparently enhanced PSC performance.434 The perovskite-Al2O3 films had interconnected pores in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions with mean pore diameter of 36 nm and film thicknesses between 70–80 nm, resulting in a Voc of 0.96 V, a Jsc of 19.7 mA cm−2, and a stable PCE greater than 9%.434

5. Summary and outlook
This article summarizes the progress and achievements in BCP self-assembly guided synthesis of mesoporous materials for ESC applications over the last 10 years. First, we introduce the basic principles of the self-assembly of BCPs both in the bulk and in solution, which provide guidance for the controllable preparation of a wide range of ordered self-assembled structures by adjusting the packing parameter of the BCP chains. With the various ordered structures as the soft templates, the BCP self-assembly guided synthetic strategy offers flexible control over the morphology and pore size/shape of mesoporous materials. Second, the currently prevalent synthetic strategies are discussed, which include bulk self-assembly, EISA, nanoprecipitation, interfacial self-assembly, and emulsion-templating self-assembly. Through these elegant protocols, a diversity of mesoporous materials with tunable dimensionalities and morphologies have been achieved, including 1D porous nanocylinders/nanotubes, 2D porous nanosheets/films, and 3D porous (hollow) spheres/cubes/anisotropic particles/monoliths, among others. Meanwhile, the flexible pore structure control leads to the creation of spherical, cylindrical, bicontinuous and hierarchical pores with tailorable sizes, which may balance the relation between effective surface area and pore volume, ultimately governing the functional performance of mesoporous materials. Third, this paper overviews the potential applications of mesoporous materials in various ESC systems, including secondary batteries, supercapacitors, electro- or photo-catalysis, and solar cells. In these ESC applications, mesoporous materials can provide a large amount of active sites, fast diffusion of electrolyte ions, and good accommodation of volume expansion during the repeated cycling. Compared with micropores, for example, mesoporous materials with larger pore sizes enable the loading or adsorption of large-sized molecules or species, e.g. ions, organic electrolyte molecules and NPs, etc., which are required by many ESC devices. Although microporous materials have large surface areas, most of the micropores are closed or exhibit narrow bottle-necks, which are difficult to contact by electrolyte, leading to poor utilization of the surface area. Furthermore, micropores are generally inaccessible to hydrated/solvated ions, leading to the poor wettablity of microporous materials. These problems can be solved by introducing mesopores to enhance the energy density and power capability of energy storage devices or catalytic performance of porous catalysts. On the other hand, the difference in pore structure may result in different mass transport modes in the interior of materials, thus affecting the effective surface areas and the amount of accessible active sites. For instance, cylindrical pores facilitate smoother and faster mass transport pathways compared to spherical pores. Particularly, in 2D materials, the in-plane cylindrical pores are favorable for promoting smooth mass and ion transport, which overcomes a common problem for 2D materials when they are tightly stacked. Further, bicontinuous structures with total continuity in all three dimensions can offer superior mass transport and provide highly accessible pore channels for electrolytes. Hierarchical porous materials combine the advantages of macro-, meso- and micropores, thus affording tailoring of the functional performance of mesoporous materials as per the requirements of different ESC devices.
In spite of the remarkable achievements in the field of BCP-templated mesoporous materials, there are still a myriad of challenges and also opportunities on the way. For example, (1) it is desirable and challenging to prepare mesoporous materials with new compositions such as metal carbides, nitrides, chalcogenides, phosphides and their hybrids, in view of their attractive properties and applications in various fields. For example, mesoporous niobium nitrides have proven to show excellent superconductor performance with a critical temperature of about 7–8 K. (2) It remains challenging to prepare bicontinuous mesoporous materials, in particular double diamond and double primitive structures, which have so far been limited to SiO2, TiO2, and Al2O3. It will be necessary to find appropriate self-assembly conditions and plot morphological phase diagrams for the controllable preparation of these bicontinuous structures. Moreover, it will be interesting to extend bicontinuous structures to a wider spectrum of mesoporous materials for ESC applications and investigate the effect of the pore architecture on their device performance. (3) For the important and versatile emulsion-templating method, most of the self-assembly mechanisms remain unclear, leading to difficulties in achieving the precise structural control of mesoporous materials. (4) Although large surface area and porosity of mesoporous materials can provide enhanced capacity or activity, these features may also lead to some disadvantages. For example, in rechargeable batteries, the high surface area of mesoporous materials may enhance the reactivity with the electrolyte and lead to uncontrolled solid electrolyte interface reactions. Moreover, mesoporous materials typically suffer from low volumetric energy and power densities when utilized in energy storage devices, such as batteries and supercapacitors. Similarly, in solar cell applications, the high surface area and defect-rich nature of mesoporous materials can lead to increased trap states and charge recombination, thereby lowering the overall conversion efficiency. To solve these problems, it is necessary to balance the different characteristics of mesoporous materials and optimize the performance of ESC devices. To this end, the structural, surface and electronic properties of mesoporous materials, as well as the charge transfer/storage mechanisms, need to be understood deeply via both substantial experiments and theoretical simulations. (5) It will also be challenging to make a breakthrough in the exploration of future applications for mesoporous materials. In energy storage systems, mesoporous materials have been widely studied for common rechargeable batteries and supercapacitors. In the near future, mesoporous materials can be developed for electrode materials of emerging state-of-the-art energy storage devices. For example, in high energy density metal–air batteries such as lithium–oxygen batteries, mesoporous materials are desirable to confine ultrafine NPs (e.g. metal oxides) with exposed active sites, while the mesopores can provide smooth transport of ions/electrons. In addition, it will be very interesting and promising to develop mesoporous materials as printable electrodes for 3D-printed energy devices such as batteries and supercapacitors. Another emerging energy storage device is the rechargeable desalination battery, which can store and release salt ions repeatedly through the charging and discharging process. This type of battery not only generates electricity from salinity differences, but also extracts sodium and chloride ions from seawater and produces fresh water. Based on similar operation principles of alkali metal-ion batteries or supercapacitors, mesoporous materials, such as carbons and metal oxides, exhibit great potential for this promising application. On the other hand, in some emerging energy conversion applications, e.g. electro/photocatalytic CO2 or N2 reduction to value-added chemicals or fuels, mesoporous materials, such as heteroatom- and/or metal-doped mesoporous carbons, metal carbides or chalcogenides, and hierarchically porous MOFs/COFs, hold great promise if their energy bands and electronic structures can be well tuned. (6) To be commercially viable for energy applications, major challenges also involve the reduction of the high cost and the large-scale production of mesoporous materials. Laboratory-made BCPs and most of the currently employed precursors are expensive and difficult to produce in large amounts. Therefore, systematic studies on the manufacturing of low-cost BCPs and economic analysis on the fabrication of mesoporous materials need to be performed to increase their feasibility for industrial production.
