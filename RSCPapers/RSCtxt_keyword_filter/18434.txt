    , Accepted 1st March 2011First published on 25th March 2011AbstractMorphology of the active layer has been proven to play an important role in determining the final device performance of photovoltaic devices. Herein, we present a facile mixed solvents soaking approach to tailor the morphology of the active layer, in which not only the crystallinity of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) in its composite film with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) has been substantially improved, but also an interpenetrating network composed of highly crystalline P3HT and PCBM nanoaggregates is constructed as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis reveals that P3HT chains enrich at the active layer/anode interface while more PCBM are found to present on the active layer/cathode interface along the vertical direction of the composite films, which is beneficial for charge carrier transport and will contribute to better device performance. The power conversion efficiency of the device using this method is improved to 3.23%, in contrast to 1.45% for a pristine device and 2.79% for a thermally annealed device. Therefore, this simple technique can simultaneously optimize lateral and vertical nanoscale phase separation of crystalline P3HT and PCBM, and shows high potential application in the preparation of high performance cost-effective polymer solar cells.
Introduction

Conjugated polymers have been widely applied in polymer light emitting diodes, polymer integrated circuits, organic field-effect transistors and polymer solar cells.1–4 Due to the advantage of flexibility, extensive material source, and easy processing,5–7polymer solar cells are very promising for providing cost-effective energy in the coming decades. At present, high performance polymer solar cells are nearly completely based on the bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) structure, and the poly(3-hexylthiophene)/[6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (P3HT/PCBM) composites which show high charge carrier mobility2,8,9 have been widely used as the photoactive layer in polymer photovoltaic devices. However, the power conversion efficiency of BHJ-based polymer solar cells is heavily dependent on the morphology of the components in the photoactive layer.10,11 Due to the limited exciton diffusion length in organic semiconductors, an ideal morphology for high performance photovoltaic devices requires nanoscale phase separation with a bicontinuous interpenetrating network, which can not only provide a large interface area between electron donor and acceptor materials for efficient exciton dissociation, but also offer continuous pathways for more direct and quick charge transportation to the corresponding electrodes so as to reduce charge recombination within the photoactive layer.12–14 As a mostly adopted solution-based thin film deposition technology, homogeneous and large scale thin films can be easily achieved by using spin coating. However, due to the very fast solvent evaporation associated with this process, the crystallization or aggregation of the components is greatly suppressed.15,16 Though a large interface area is preserved in the composite, continuous pathways are rare in the composite, which will lead to low charge carrier mobility and eventually inefficient devices. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out post treatments to further tailor the morphology for better devices.
Besides, the component distribution of the donor and acceptor molecules along the vertical direction of the composite films, i.e., the vertical phase separation, has been recently proven to play an important role in determining the charge transportation and collection.17 As is well known, holes are transported to the ITO anode along the network of electron donor materials while electrons are transported to the metal cathode through the pathways of electron acceptor materials. Thus, a vertical phase separation with electron donor and acceptor materials enriched at the bottom and top surface, respectively, is favorable for high performance polymer photovoltaic devices.18–21 This vertical phase separation requirement makes morphology control more complicated and difficult. Hitherto, post thermal annealing12,22,23 and solvent-vapor treatment24–27 are widely used to further tailor the morphology of the photoactive layer composite. However, both methods need very delicate control of the processing parameters such as humidity, treating time, temperature, heating/cooling speed, vapor increasing/decreasing rate and so on. With higher annealing temperature or longer heating time, the composite will suffer from large-scale phase separation or degradation, which is unfavorable for the development of device performance.28,29 Furthermore, thermal annealing technology is not applicable for flexible substrates with a low glass transition temperature. And then due to the dangers of solvent vapor, solvent-vapor treatment is not suitable for commercial applications of polymer devices. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop novel facile and reliable methods to better tailor the device morphology with potential application in the preparation of large-area polymer solar cells.
Previously, Zhao et al. applied an easy-manipulating solvent soaking method to systematically study the dependence of self-assembly behaviors of polymethylmethacrylate/polystyrene (PMMA/PS) brushes on molecular weight.30 And recently, Russell et al. demonstrated that a variety of nanostructures can be easily achieved in poly(styrene-b-4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) tubes by immersing them in ethylene glycol at various temperatures.31 Inspired by these, we extend this powerful tool to the morphology control of photoactive layers. In the present work, we use the intensively investigated P3HT/PCBM system as an example to illustrate the feasibility of constructing high performance polymer solar cells by using this simple post treatment method. This facile approach can not only substantially increase the crystallinity of conjugated polymers but also forms homogenous PCBM nanoaggregates in the composite films. Moreover, solvent soaking processing is more easily processable and independent of ambient temperature/humidity compared with other post-treatment technologies, which usually require complicated instruments, precise temperature/time and time-consuming procedures. Therefore, this facile method would be expected to be applied to large-area polymer solar cells.
Experimental
Materials
Regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) (Mw = 56000 g mol−1, regioregularity = 95%) was obtained from Rieke Metals Inc. PCBM and o-dichlorobenzene (ODCB, anhydrous, 99%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich company. Carbon disulfide (CS2) and methanol (CH3OH) were used from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. All materials were used as received without further treatment.

          Sample preparations
        

          P3HT/PCBM (1:1, w/w) mixtures were dissolved in ODCB by stirring in dark overnight to achieve a solution with a P3HT concentration of 10 mg ml−1. Then the solution was spin-coated on glass slides which had been spin-coated by a ca. 30 nm thin layer of poly(ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS). Meanwhile, the CH3OH/CS2 mixed solvents were prepared in a weighing bottle by weight ratio. After that, the prepared thin film was immersed in the mixed solvents under ambient atmosphere and then the weighing bottle was sealed to prevent solvent evaporation. After a minute, the film was removed from the mixed solvents and dried with a nitrogen flow immediately.
All the thin films for transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were obtained by the floating method in which thin films were floated on water. In order to remove PEDOT:PSS which is well dissolved in water, the film was kept in water at 40–50 °C for 10 min before transferring to a copper grid for TEM experiments or a new substrate with bottom surface on top for AFM and XPS measurements. The S 2p spectra from the P3HT:PCBM film exhibits a binding energy peak at 164 eV. While an additional peak around 168 eV corresponds to the S atoms in the sulfonate group of PSS which comes from the remnant of the PEDOT:PSS layer on the bottom surface of the films. And then the S 2p peak at 168 eV is not included in the calculations. The weight or molar ratio of the components could be calculated directly from the peak area ratios of individual elements.
For the device fabrication, the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates were first cleaned with deionized water, isopropyl alcohol and acetone by ultrasonic treatment. Then the substrates were treated within an UV-ozone oven for 20 min. Afterwards, a ca.30 nm thin PEDOT:PSS layer and ca. 90 nm P3HT/PCBM composite were deposited onto the substrate in sequence viaspin-coating. Afterwards, the thin film was immersed in the prepared mixed solvents under an ambient atmosphere for 1 min and dried with a nitrogen flow immediately. Finally, a 1 nm LiF layer and 80 nm Al cathode were completed by evaporation on top of the active layer in a vacuum lower than 5.0 × 10−4 Pa with the device obtained from Beijing Beiyi Innovation Vacuum Technology Co., Ltd (DM-300B). The active area of the solar cell was 3 × 3 mm2.
Characterization

UV-Vis
absorption spectra were acquired on a Lambda 750 spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Wellesley, MA).

X-Ray diffraction (XRD) profiles were obtained using a Bruker D8 Discover Reflector with an X-ray generation power of 40 kV tube voltage and 40 mA tube current. The diffraction was recorded at a θ–2θ symmetry scanning mode with the scan angle from 2θ = 3°–30°.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope and operated at an acceleration voltage of 100 kV. The samples for TEM experiments were dried at room temperature for more than 12 h. In order to qualitatively compare the crystallinity of components in thin films, all the SAED patterns were acquired in the same setting.
Surface morphology of the films was characterized on an Agilent 5500 AFM by tapping mode in an ambient atmosphere.

XPS measurements were performed on a VG ESCALAB MK II X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy instrument and the probing depth of XPS was no more than 10 nm.
The J–V characteristics of photovoltaic cells were recorded in a glove box by using a Keithley 2400 source meter under the illumination of a tungsten–halogen lamp (filtered by a Schott KG1 and GG385 filter) at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2.
Results and discussion
As a small molecule, PCBM can be easily dissolved in most organic solvents while P3HT only shows high solubility in a few solvents.32 Because of this reason, it is difficult to find a solvent which can only activate the chain motion of P3HT but not dissolve PCBM when the P3HT/PCBM composite film is immersed in it. Therefore, we use mixed solvents of methanol (CH3OH) and carbon disulfide (CS2) instead of a single solvent to perform the solvent soaking experiment. It should be pointed out that CH3OH has no effect on the morphology of the composite but is only for avoiding the dissolution of PCBM and P3HT. CS2 is a good solvent for both P3HT and PCBM, so it can motivate the motion of P3HT and PCBM to aggregate and further tailor the morphology of the composite film. Fig. 1a shows the UV-Vis absorption spectra of P3HT/PCBM composite films after immersing in CH3OH/CS2 mixed solvents for 1 min. For comparison, the pristine film has also been included. It is obvious that the UV-Vis absorption intensity of the peak at 607 nm becomes higher when the concentration of CS2 in the soaking solution is increased. It is generally agreed that the absorption intensity of the peak centered at around 607 nm is correlated to interchain order. Thus, the increased intensity at 607 nm indicates a gradual formation of ordered aggregates and the enhanced P3HT crystallinity.33 It should be noted that soaking treatment also induces a red shift in the main peak from 486 nm to 511 nm, which could be interpreted as an increase in the mean conjugation length.24 The increased crystallinity of P3HT can also be verified by X-ray diffraction experiments. Fig. 1b shows the XRD profiles of P3HT/PCBM films before and after soaking in CH3OH/CS2 mixed solvents for 1 min. The main peak at around 2θ = 5.4° could be resolved in all composite films, which is assigned to the reflection of the crystallographic (100) plane of P3HT.34 Concerning the diffraction intensity, it is much stronger in the films subjected to solvent soaking treatment than that in pristine film, and it increases significantly with the concentration of CS2 increasing, which is consistent with the results observed in the UV-Vis absorption spectra. While soaking with a higher weight ratio of CS2 or with longer time not only induces decreased device efficiency but also introduces dissolution risk to the film (Fig. S1 in the ESI†). After optimization, we found an optimal weight ratio of 5:1 for CH3OH/CS2 mixed solvents system for soaking with 1 min, by which not only the dissolution of composite film can be prevented but also the morphology of the composite film can be improved.

For the TEM images shown in Fig. 2a, we can only observe some relatively bright short P3HT nanocrystallites distributed on the whole film. And in the inset of Fig. 2a, a very weak diffraction ring which is assigned to the reflection of the crystallographic (020) plane of P3HT can be resolved in the outer part of the SAED pattern,35 indicating very low crystallinity of P3HT in the pristine film. While for the composite film immersed in CH3OH/CS2 (5:1, w/w) mixed solvents for 1 min (indicated as 5:1 in Fig. 1), densely distributed P3HT short crystallites can be observed (Fig. 2b). Accordingly, the electron diffraction intensity from the crystallographic (020) plane of P3HT becomes much stronger than that shown in Fig. 2a, implying that the crystallinity of P3HT has been substantially increased. These numerous P3HT nanocrystallites overlap each other within the thin film, which is beneficial for faster hole transportation. Meanwhile, PCBM diffuses into larger nanoaggregates as is proven by the dark regions in Fig. 2b,12 suggesting more continuous pathways are constructed in the composite film. Therefore, the above observations reveal that a nanoscale interpenetrating network with crystalline P3HT and PCBM-rich domains has been constructed in the thin film via the solvent soaking method.

To explore the morphology evolution of the composite film upon immersing in mixed solvents, AFM was employed to characterize the surface topography including the air surface (top surface) and the photoactive layer/substrate interface (bottom surface) of the composite film. For the pristine film (Fig. 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d), the morphology is different between the top and bottom surface. However, we could not observe P3HT crystalline nanorods or nanofibers on both surfaces. After immersing the pristine film in mixed solvents (Fig. 3e, 3f, 3g, 3h), no significant morphology changes are observed on the top surface. Whereas, the treated bottom surface shows significant phase separation, and the roughness is increased. As we know, when the composite film is immersed in the mixed solvents, CS2 molecules will adsorb on the film surface and then penetrate into the film. As a good solvent for both P3HT and PCBM, CS2 will activate the chain motion of P3HT and the diffusion of PCBM molecules laterally and vertically. It has been reported that PCBM tends to diffuse out from the confined surface to the free surface under thermal annealing.36,37 Therefore, we anticipate that during the crystallization/aggregation of P3HT and PCBM, PCBM molecules at the bottom surface will diffuse to aggregate because of the spatial confinement. As a result, the bottom surface shows remarkable phase separation and increased roughness because of the out diffusion of some PCBM molecules while the top surface nearly retains its previous morphology.

To verify the proposed morphology evolution model shown above, we used XPS to study the compositions on both surfaces before and after solvent soaking treatment. The C (1s) peak represents the total content of P3HT and PCBM, and the S (2p)/C (1s) peak area ratio could be proportionally correlated to the percentage of P3HT in the composite. Therefore, P3HT to PCBM weight ratios at the bottom and top surfaces can be evaluated by using S/C atomic ratios in XPS profiles (Fig. S2†). Fig. 4 shows the compositions at the top and bottom surfaces of P3HT/PCBM composite films. For the pristine film, the S/C ratio of the top surface is higher than that of the bottom, suggesting higher P3HT concentration at the top surface, which is attributed to the surface energy difference of the components. It is reported that P3HT shows a relatively lower surface energy of 26.9 J m−2 than PCBM (37.8 J m −2), therefore, P3HT will accumulate at the film/air surface in order to reduce the overall energy when deposited from solution.38,39 With respect to the film after soaking treatment, the time-dependent concentration of P3HT on the bottom surface increases with soaking time. Moreover, PCBM increases at the air surface simultaneously, forming a more uniform distribution of components (Fig. 4).
 Fig. 4  Composition at the top and bottom surfaces of the pristine and treated blend films. 
Taking all the results we obtained into account, the whole morphology evolution process of the P3HT/PCBM composite treated by the solvent soaking method can be illustrated in Fig. 5. As is proven by the XPS result, P3HT inclines to aggregate on the top surface because of its lower surface energy compared with PCBM, and the PCBM component enriches on the bottom during spin coating. When the film is immersed into the CH3OH/CS2 mixed solvents, CS2, which is a good solvent for both PCBM and P3HT, will diffuse into the film to activate the motion of frozen P3HT chains and PCBM molecules. On one hand, the increased chain mobility will facilitate the components to form more P3HT nanocrystallites and larger PCBM nanoaggregates, resulting in increased P3HT crystallinity and laterally nanoscale phase separation. These P3HT crystallites homogeneously distribute in the composite film, and they form an interpenetrating network with PCBM aggregates for efficient exciton dissociation and charge carrier transportation. On the other hand, as small molecules, PCBM are easier to diffuse from the confined bottom surface or inner part of the film to the free top surface compared with P3HT. Therefore, the PCBM molecules will diffuse from the bottom surface to the top surface during solvent soaking treatment, which is consistent with the observation of composition evolution between the top and bottom surfaces shown in Table 1. As a result, the P3HT concentration at the bottom surface and the PCBM content at the top surface are increased, which can benefit both hole and electron transport.19 Consequently, solvents-induced phase separation in polymer-fullerene blend is thought to involve two aspects: (1) an interpenetrating network with nanoscale phase separation accompanied by diffusion of the PCBM molecules; and (2) vertical phase separation generated with the vertical diffusion of PCBM from the bottom surface of the film to the top because of the spatial confinement. Simultaneous lateral and vertical nanoscale phase segregation of nanocrystalline P3HT and PCBM aggregates occur during the soaking process, contributing to an improved morphology for polymer photovoltaic devices.

However, the most interesting part is the feasibility of this solvent soaking method for preparing high performance photovoltaic devices. J–V curves of the devices prepared by the different methods are shown in Fig. 6, and the detailed comparisons are summarized in Table 2. The device thermally-annealed at 130 °C for 5 min shows modest power conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing from 1.45% to 2.79%, which is comparable with the results previously reported. Upon solvent soaking treatment, the short circuit current density (Jsc) increases more than two times (from 3.80 to 9.02 mA cm−2) compared with the pristine device. As is known, the Jsc is heavily influenced by the component morphology in the photoactive layer. Therefore, a remarkable increase in Jsc for the solvent soaking treated device indicates that the morphology of the photoactive layer has been substantially improved. Though the open circuit voltage decreases slightly which is probably due to the increased crystallinity of components, we still obtain PCE up to 3.23%, indicating that high performance devices can be prepared using this facile solvent soaking method.

Anyway, the simple solvent soaking post treatment can improve the photoactive layer morphology for high performance polymer photovoltaic devices not only by forming nanoscale interpenetrating network of P3HT crystallites and PCBM nanoaggregates, but also by redistributing PCBM molecules to form a vertical phase separation with P3HT and PCBM enriched at the PEDOT:PSS/photoactive layer interface and the photoactive layer/metal interface, respectively. Higher device performance will rely on further optimizing the processing parameters such as the choice of solvent and treatment temperature.
Conclusions
In summary, we are able to use a facile solvent soaking method to tailor the morphology of P3HT/PCBM composite films. After immersing the thin films in CH3OH/CS2 mixed solvents, an interpenetrating network comprising P3HT crystallites and PCBM nanoscale aggregates has been generated as is proven by TEM and AFM measurements. Furthermore, the immersing treatment also induces PCBM to diffuse out from the confined bottom surface to the top surface, forming a vertical phase separation with P3HT enriched on the bottom surface while PCBM enriched on the top surface. The interpenetrating network together with this vertical phase separation contribute to an improved morphology, in which not only a large interface area is preserved for efficient exciton dissociation, but also more continuous pathways are constructed to facilitate the charge carrier transport. The feasibility of this simple method in preparing real polymer solar cells has been proven by substantially enhanced device performance, especially the more than two times increase in short circuit current density, which is heavily dependent on the morphology of components in the photoactive layer. Although the processing parameters of this method still need further optimization, we have shown an effective and convenient way to improve the morphology for better devices. Moreover, this solvent soaking method provides us with a new approach to manipulate the component morphology in preparation of high performance organic electronics.
