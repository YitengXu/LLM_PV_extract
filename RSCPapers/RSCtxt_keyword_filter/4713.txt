1. Introduction
The availability of cost and energy-efficient, scalable photovoltaic technologies is key for future exploitation of solar energy. Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have attracted considerable attention in scientific and industrial fields, due to their low cost, environmental friendliness, and simple preparation procedures. Generally, a DSSC is composed of a semiconductor oxide sensitized by a dye, an electrolyte containing a redox couple (usually triiodide/iodide), and a counter electrode (CE). In a DSSC system, the CE collects electrons from an external circuit and transfers them from the CE interface to the electrolyte. Then it provides activation energy for the regeneration of iodide from triiodide.1–3 In order to improve electrocatalytic performance of a CE in DSSCs, various efforts such as the effect of crystallization, the choice of different materials, and the way of fabricating CE have been applied to improve the CE performance.4–8
Previous works reported that excellent morphology of CE materials can improve electrocatalytic performance.9–12 Hollow-structured materials, such as nanotubes and mesoporous spheres, integrate hollow interiors or voids with mesoporous shells of various dimensions into one nanostructure. These excellent structures can provide large surface area, fast electron transfer channels, and many catalytic active sites due to their outstanding features of low density, high surface-to-volume ratio, extensive presence of mesoporous channels on the shell, and the resultant high permeability.13–15 As one of the hollow structures, a nanotube can absorb reflected and/or refracted light; therefore, loss of photons attributed to scattering effects in a liquid can potentially be minimized. Additionally, a nanotube possesses a large surface area, fast electron transport, and low recombination rate, enabling us to achieve a high catalytic activity and efficiency.16 Also, this structure is conductive, adsorbs a lot of electrolyte and provides many electrocatalytic active sites. Therefore, nanotube morphology of a nanomaterial exhibits great potential as a CE for DSSCs.
MnO2 and derivative compounds have attracted special attention due to their outstanding structural flexibility combined with novel chemical and physical properties, and they are widely used as catalysts, molecular sieves, supercapacitors, and electrode materials in Li/MnO2 batteries. Moreover, well-controlled dimensionality, size, and crystal structure are regarded as critical factors that may bring some novel and unexpected properties; for example, isotropic or anisotropic behavior and region-dependent surface reactivity. Therefore, development of a morphologically controllable synthesis of MnO2 is very important to answer the demand of exploring the potentials of manganese dioxide.17 However, to the best of our knowledge, the fabrication of MnO2 nanotubes used as CE catalysts in a DSSCs system has not been reported yet.18 Therefore, considering the excellent electrocatalytic performance of MnO2 for reducing triiodide, the exploration of MnO2 nanotubes' characteristics will be of great importance.
Herein, we report the synthesis of MnO2 nanostructures under simple hydrothermal conditions. These as-prepared MnO2 nanostructures have an obvious tubular structure. The photovoltaic properties of MnO2 products mixed with different amounts of graphene were investigated in our present work. The electrochemical catalysis of MnO2 was excellent, but the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) value of MnO2 in the DSSC system was too large. Besides, the combination of graphene with nanomaterials is an effective way to improve electrochemical stability and conductivity.19,20 In addition, graphene has various noticeable properties, such as high electrical conductivity, high Fermi velocity, linear energy dispersion relation, and structural flexibility.21–23 After mixing MnO2 products with different amounts of graphene, the EIS of MnO2 was significantly reduced, and the conversion efficiency of MnO2 was significantly improved. The conversion efficiency of MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO CE reached 5.77%, which was slightly superior to the commercial Pt CE (5.40%). These results showed that MnO2 nanotubes, with an appropriate amount of graphene, can be low-cost substitutes for Pt CEs.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Synthesis of MnO2 nanotubes
The MnO2 nanotubes were synthesized by thermally annealing MnOOH precursors in the presence of air gas flow. All of the reactants and solvents were from Shanghai Chemical Co. Ltd., China. All chemical reagents were analytical grade and used without further purification. In a typical synthesis, 0.158 g of potassium permanganate and 0.5 g of polyethylene glycol (PEG20000) were mixed with 20 mL of deionized water. The resultant mixture was continuously stirred for 0.5 h and then transferred into a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave. The autoclave then was placed into an oven at 150 °C for 24 h, after which the system was naturally cooled to ambient temperature. The final product was collected and washed with distilled water and absolute alcohol at least three times. The as-synthesized samples were further annealed at 300 °C and kept at the same temperature for 5 h.
2.2 Preparation of graphene oxide nanosheets
Graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets were prepared by a modified Hummers' method.31 In detail, graphite powder (2.0 g) was dispersed into 100 mL cooled (0 °C) H2SO4 (98%), followed by the slow addition of KMnO4 (6.0 g). Then, the suspension was stirred at 35 °C for 12–15 h. Afterward, 200 mL distilled water was added, and the temperature was kept at 98 °C for 2 h. When the temperature cooled to 60 °C, 10 mL H2O2 (30%) was injected into the suspension to react completely with the excess KMnO4, which yielded a bright yellow mixture. The solid product was centrifuged and washed with HCl (30%) and distilled water several times until the pH value of the supernatant was ∼6, and GO was finally obtained. The precipitate was collected, dispersed in water, then sonicated, subsequently concentrated to obtain a GO suspension, and stored at 50 °C for 10 h. Finally, GO powder was obtained.
2.3 Materials characterization
The phase purity structure of the as-synthesized MnO2 material was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD, D/max-2500, Japan Science) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å). The morphology of samples was studied by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, Nanosem 430, FEI). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Tecnai G2F20, FEI) was used to analyze the structure of the MnO2 nanotubes sample.
2.4 Fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells
Approximately 0.1 g of MnO2 powder was mixed with 0.025 g of PEG20000 and ethanol, and stirred until a fluid mixture formed. Then, a film was made by using the doctor-blade method on FTO conductive glass (LOF, TEC-15, 15 W per square). After the film was steady, a conductive glass with film was heated at 450 °C for 2 h under the protection of argon to obtain the MnO2 CE. The fabrication method of MnO2 + rGO CEs was similar with the fabrication of MnO2 CE, expect physical mixing 0.1 g MnO2 powder with 0.003 g, 0.006 g and 0.009 g of rGO. A commercial TiO2 sol (Solaronix, Ti-Nanoxide T/SP) was used to prepare the TiO2 film on FTO also with the above mentioned method, and the film was soaked in an N-719 dye solution (in ethanol) for 24 h to obtain the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrodes. The DSSCs were assembled by injecting the electrolyte into the aperture between the dye-sensitized TiO2 electrode and the CE. The liquid electrolyte was composed of 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII), and 0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine with acetonitrile as the solvent. Surlyn 1702 was used as the spacer between the two electrodes. The two electrodes were clipped together with solid paraffin used as a sealant to prevent leaking of the electrolyte solution. The effective cell area was 0.25 cm2.
2.5 Characterization of the counter electrodes and dye-sensitized solar cells
All the electrochemical characteristics were tested by a Zahner IM6 electrochemical workstation. The photocurrent density–voltage curves were carried out with simulated AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW cm−2, Trusttech CHF-XM-500W) with a Keithley digital source meter (Keithley 2410, USA). Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was recorded on the exelectrochemical workstation with a three-electrode system. Pt was used as the CE, and Ag/AgCl was used as the reference electrode. The CV curves were recorded in a range from −0.4 to 1.2 V at a scan rate of 25 mV s−1 in a solution of 10.0 mM LiI, 1.0 mM I2, and 0.1 M LiClO4 in acetonitrile, which served as the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) were performed at zero bias potential, and the impedance data covered a frequency range of 0.1 Hz to 1 MHz. The amplitude of the sinusoidal alternating current voltage signal was 5 mV. The analyses of the resulting impedance spectra were recorded using the software Zview 2.0.
3. Results and discussion
The phase and structures of the as-synthesized samples were determined by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). Fig. 1 and S1† show the XRD patterns of the as-synthesized MnO2, GO, and rGO. XRD confirms the presence of MnO2 in the space group (JCPDS: 24-0735, P42/mnm, a = b = 4.39 Å, c = 2.87 Å), and the intense and sharp peaks indicate that the products are highly crystalline. There are no other manganese oxides, such as MnO, Mn3O4, and Mn2O3. On the other hand, the three strongest diffraction peaks at about 28.68°, 37.328°, and 56.652°, correspond to the (110), (101), and (211) faces. These manifest that pure crystalline MnO2 was successfully formed via the hydrothermal process.

Structural details of the MnO2 samples were investigated by SEM and TEM. Fig. 2a displays the typical morphology of the MnOOH which has uniform morphology and size of a nanorod structure with lengths ranging from 3 to 10 μm, and average diameter of ∼300 nm. Fig. 2b reveals the MnO2 samples look like nanorods under low magnification and their lengths range from 3 to 10 μm, with an average diameter of ∼300 nm. This shows that the structure of MnOOH has not changed after annealing. As shown in Fig. 2c, there are holes at the top of the nanorods and Fig. 2d clearly displays the nanorods with holes in nanotubes under high magnification. In order to validate further that the MnO2 samples are nanotubes, they were investigated by TEM. Further information on the microstructure of the MnO2 was provided by TEM characterization. Fig. 3a and b display a typical TEM image of MnO2 nanotubes with a homogeneous hollow structure. Fig. 3c manifests that MnO2 has an obvious tubular structure. Fig. 3d shows that the marked lattice fringes with the spacings of MnO2 are 0.24 and 0.28 nm. All of the well-resolved lattice fringes further indicate high crystallinity for the MnO2 nanotubes.

The electrocatalytic performance of samples was examined as the CE materials in DSSCs. The photovoltaic and electrochemical performance parameters of different CEs are listed in Table 1. When MnO2 is used as a CE of N719-sensitized solar cells, the photovoltaic characteristics are Voc = 0.67 V, Jsc = 11.92 mA, FF = 0.41, and PCE = 3.03%. As mentioned above, because graphene has some appealing abilities, such as high electrical conductivity, we tried to mix different amounts of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to improve the electrochemical catalytic activity. Fig. 4 compares the photovoltaic performance of five DSSCs using the MnO2, MnO2 + 3 wt% rGO, MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO, MnO2 + 9 wt% rGO, and Pt as CEs. As expected, the electrocatalytic performance of CE was substantially improved after MnO2 mixing with 3, 6, and 9 wt% rGO. In particular, the DSSCs assembled with CE (MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO) yields a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.77%, which is slightly superior to the Pt CE (5.40%). Therefore, the high energy conversion efficiency of MnO2 with graphene assistance is validated. On one hand, the narrow band gap of graphene contributes much to the exchange current between MnO2 + graphene CE materials and electrolyte. On the other hand, the excellent charge transfer ability of graphene improves the charge transfer among MnO2 nanotubes and, in addition, the large specific surface area of graphene greatly promotes the absorption of electrolyte molecules onto the surface of MnO2 + graphene CEs. The photovoltaic and electrochemical performance parameters of different CEs are listed in Table 1. However, as shown in Table 1, excessive addition of rGO decreases the power conversion efficiency. The amount of light absorption by the rGO decreases the light absorption by dye molecules, which then impairs the light harvesting efficiency, and decreases the light reflected from the CE to the photoanode.24

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) experiments were performed to examine charge transfer abilities and catalytic activities. Fig. 6a and b manifests the Nyquist plots of the symmetrical cells with different CEs. In the high-frequency region, the series resistance (Rs) can be obtained. In the semicircle maxima of the middle-frequency region, the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) can be obtained. In addition, the Nyquist plots in the low-frequency region provide information on the resistance at the finite layer Nernst diffusion impedance within the electrolyte.25 The equivalent circuit (shown in Fig. 6c) consists of several components. Herein, the Rct value can be calculated by fitting the left-hand hump, and it inversely varies with the electrocatalytic activity for the reduction of triiodide, which is the key step of the catalytic process.26,27 The electrochemical catalysis of MnO2 is excellent, but the EIS value of MnO2 in the DSSC system is too large. It's not conducive to the electron transfer in the DSSC system. However, the EIS value of MnO2 significantly decreased after MnO2 nanotubes were mixed with different amounts of grapheme. In Table 1, MnO2 CE exhibits a Rct value (1350 Ω), MnO2 + 3 wt% rGO CE shows a Rct value (501.1 Ω), MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO CE reveals a Rct value (31.87 Ω), and MnO2 + 9 wt% rGO CE displays a Rct value (143.5 Ω). The above data shows that after MnO2 is mixed with grapheme, the EIS values obviously decrease. MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO CE manifests a smaller Rct value compared with the other MnO2-based and MnO2 CEs. This reveals the superior catalytic activity of MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO CE, and explains why the energy conversion efficiency of MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO CE is slightly better than the other MnO2-based CEs.

After mixing with rGO, the electrocatalytic abilities of MnO2 were improved. This is possibly attributed to the enhanced triiodide reduction or better contact between the electrolyte and MnO2.28–30 To clearly test the electrocatalytic abilities of the four MnO2-based and Pt CEs toward the reduction triiodide, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was measured with a three-electrode system at a scan rate of 50 mv s−1. As shown in Fig. 5, all the curves exhibit two typical pairs of oxidation–reduction peaks, except the curves of MnO2. The relative negative pair is assigned to the redox reaction of I−/I3− (eqn (1)), whereas the positive pair is assigned to the redox reaction of I2/I3− (eqn (2)).31

The CV curves of iodide/triiodide redox species using four types of MnO2-based materials and Pt are shown in Fig. 5; MnO2 and MnO2+ based electrodes exhibit one pair of redox peaks assigned to reaction eqn (1). Fig. 5 reveals that the profile and peak locations of the CV for the MnO2 + 3 wt% rGO, MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO and MnO2 + 9 wt% rGO electrodes are better than the profile and peak locations of the CV for the MnO2. In addition, peak current intensity is an important parameter for comparing catalytic activities of different CEs.32 The higher cathodic peak current density reveals a faster reduction velocity. The cathodic peak current density of MnO2 + 3 wt% rGO, MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO, and MnO2 + 9 wt% rGO CE are higher than the cathodic peak current density of the MnO2 CE. The higher cathodic peak current densities manifests that a faster charge transfer process occurs, which leads to a high electrochemical catalytic activity. This explains why the energy conversion efficiency of MnO2 + 6 wt% rGO CE is slightly superior to the Pt CEs. The CV data shows that the addition of graphene remarkably improved the reaction velocity of CE materials.33
4. Conclusion
In summary, MnO2 nanotubes were successfully synthesized through a facile hydrothermal method. Considerably high photoelectric conversion efficiency of MnO2 nanotubes mixing with graphene was demonstrated by extensive electrochemical measurements. Considering the excellent performance in DSSCs and concise synthesis strategy of MnO2-based CE, appropriate addition of rGO is an alternative to expensive Pt in DSSCs as a promising low-cost and effective CE catalyst. Using a simple physical mixture with reduced graphene oxides is feasible, low-cost, simple, and efficient. We will continue studying the electrocatalytic performance of CE materials, and, furthermore, we will attempt to improve the performance of CE materials in DSSCs systems and achieve high power conversion efficiency in the future.
