Nanoporous SnO2 electrodes of various architectures (mono- or bilayered) were then processed by the screen-printing method using suitable combinations of these SnO2 particles; the final texture, composition and morphology of the photoanodes obtained depending upon the nature of the post-treatment (with or without TiCl4). After sensitization by the ruthenium dye N719, ATR-FTIR studies revealed that chemisorption of the dye onto porous cassiterite SnO2 layers took place through a bridging coordination mode. As-prepared dye-sensitized photoanodes, when embedded in DSC devices containing a liquid electrolyte, led to a record overall power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.2% for pure SnO2 composed of both kinds of particles and to very promising PCE above 4% for photoanodes post-treated with TiCl4. The remarkable photovoltaic performances of the photoanodes including both kinds of particles, associated or not with a TiCl4 post-treatment, were due to improved Voc and FF, and were related to: (i) lower charge transfer resistance at the SnO2–N719–electrolyte interface; (ii) onset of dark current occurring at higher potential; (iii) enhanced electron lifetimes as determined by transient Voc decay measurements. Finally, the most striking feature of this study concerns the improvement of the power conversion efficiency upon aging under ambient conditions and the amazing long-term stability of DSCs fabricated from different SnO2-based photoanodes since standard devices built from N719 dye and I3−/I− electrolytes usually show fast decrease of efficiency.1. IntroductionDirect conversion of solar light into electricity, namely photovoltaic conversion, is one of the most attractive ways to harvest the solar energy. Nonetheless, even though the costs largely depend upon the target applications, classical silicon-based solar cells are hampered by relatively high production costs, rendering the power generated uncompetitive with the conventional production method. These limitations have therefore given rise to new concepts such as organic and hybrid organic–inorganic photovoltaic cells. In this context, mesoscopic dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs), first introduced by Grätzel et al.,1 have demonstrated many advantages over the past two decades such as simplicity, low-cost, eco-friendly nature of the process, environmental compatibility, transparency, colour rendition and rather high power conversion efficiencies (PCE) that are comparable to those of amorphous silicon cells.2 Mimicking natural photosynthesis, the most studied systems are built from nanoporous anatase titanium dioxide (TiO2) films sensitized with organic or metallo-organic ruthenium dyes endowed with carboxylic acid functions and placed in contact with an electron-donor liquid electrolyte leading to a PCE up to 12% at the lab scale,3 10% for sub-modules and 8% for large-scale modules.4 Until now, TiO2 is the best understood and successful anode material prototype in DSCs owing to its good chemical stability, high density of states in its conduction band, and suitable band alignment and electronic coupling with a large variety of organic and inorganic dyes. However, the rather low electron mobility through nanocrystalline nanoporous TiO2 photoanodes (ca. 0.1 cm2 V−1 s−1) and the photocatalytic activity of anatase titania have led to crucial limitations both in terms of further performance improvement and long-term stability of the cells. Along with zinc oxide (ZnO),5 tetragonal tin dioxide (SnO2) is a promising alternative functional material to be used as a photoanode in DSCs6 due to its larger bandgap (3.6 eV vs. 3.2 eV for anatase TiO2 at 300 K), more positive conduction band making it a better electron acceptor and much higher electron mobility both as bulk (ca. 240 cm2 V−1 s−1)7 and as a nanocrystalline material (ca. 125 cm2 V−1 s−1).8 As a consequence, faster electron collection and better long-term stability under illumination of the corresponding devices should be conceptually achieved by using SnO2-based porous electrodes. However, rather low energy conversion efficiencies, around 2% under AM1.5G 100 mW cm−2 illumination, were reported for conventional nanoparticulate SnO2-based liquid9 or solid10 DSCs, inherent to fast recombination processes resulting from low conduction band edge and to poor dye uptake related to low isoelectric point. The development of UV post-treatment,11 new dye-oxide linkages,12 well-defined SnO2 morphologies as nanowires13 and nanoflowers,14 mesoporous agglomerates,15 or well-ordered mesoporous SnO2 layers16 led to slight improvements with PCE reaching 3% in some cases. Besides, introduction of an interfacial layer on the SnO2 surface using other materials such as TiO29b,17 or CaCO3,18 or by addition of ZnO nanoparticles9e yielded higher efficiencies.High performance photoanodes for DSCs commonly result from the best compromise among large specific surface area (SSA), salient light scattering phenomenon and fast electron transport, three parameters that are often antagonistic. In the case of TiO2-based photoanodes, this was achieved by an optimized combination of 20 nm diameter anatase nanoparticles (SSA ≈ 120 m2 g−1) and larger light scattering particles associated with a multilayer deposition processing,19 but until now it has not been extended to other oxides. Furthermore, recent developments in the field of crystalline SnO2 nanoparticle design should allow optimization of both textural properties and morphology of SnO2 materials for DSCs.20 In this paper, we report on three different SnO2-based photoanode architecture processed from two types of SnO2 nano-objects differing in both size and morphology, i.e. almost spherical nanoparticles and pseudo-octahedral particles. A suitable combination of these particles (single or bilayered nanostructures, mixture of particles) and of the post-treatment employed led to functional photoelectrode materials for DSCs that showed high performance in energy conversion, with a PCE of up to 4.1% after several weeks of aging. To the best of our knowledge, this work constitutes the first example of SnO2-based photoanodes showing both enhanced photoconversion efficiency and long-term stability in DSCs.2. Experimental section2.1. Materials and chemicalsColloidal tin dioxide particle suspension (SnO2, 15% w/v in water, Alfa Aesar), anhydrous tin tetrachloride (Acros Organics), polyvinylpyrrolidone (Mw = 8000, Acros Organics), glacial acetic acid (Fisher Scientific) and hydrogen chloride (HCl, 37% v/v in water, Fischer Scientific) of analytical grade were used without further purification.2.2. Preparation of SnO2 particlesIn a closed vessel, a mixture of glacial acetic acid (1 g, 16.7 mmol) and colloidal SnO2 particle suspension (37 g) was stirred at RT for 40 h. The resulting slurry was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave (300 mL) and heated at 240 °C (28 bars) for 90 h.9a,c After cooling down to RT, the SnO2 nanoparticles were washed several times with water and ethanol, and isolated by centrifugation. Drying at 90 °C overnight followed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 2 h gave 1.2 g of a white powder, hereafter named nanoSnO2.In a second procedure, anhydrous tin tetrachloride (0.238 g, 0.91 mmol), HCl (0.6 mL) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (0.315 g, 0.04 mmol) in a mixture of ethanol and water (6 mL, v/v = 1:1) were sonicated for 10 minutes.20a The resulting mixture was transferred into a stainless steel autoclave (300 mL) and heated at 200 °C (20 bars) for 12 h. After cooling down to RT, the SnO2 nanoparticles were washed several times with water and ethanol, and collected by centrifugation. Drying at 90 °C for 20 h followed by calcination in air at 500 °C for 3 h gave 0.135 g of a white powder, hereafter named octaSnO2.2.3. Processing and characterization of SnO2 photoanodesFTO-coated conducting glass substrates (NSG10, 3.2 mm, 10 Ω per square, XOPFisica) were cleaned with ethanol followed by an ultrasonic treatment in an alkaline detergent solution. After further treatment under UV-O3 for 20 minutes in order to eliminate polluting carbon residues, the substrates were treated by a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min to increase photoanode adhesion while reducing recombination between the conducting glass and the electrolyte at this interface. Four different photoanode architectures were obtained from pastes including nanoSnO2 and/or octaSnO2 nanoparticles. Typically, using nanoSnO2, octaSnO2 or a mixture of both (7:3 w/w ratio) as tin dioxide source, pastes were prepared as follows: SnO2 (1 g) and ethyl cellulose (0.5 g) were stirred in a mixture of ethanol (8 mL), terpineol (3.2 mL) and glacial acetic acid (0.2 mL) for 24 h at RT and then sonicated for 15 min. Evaporation of ethanol gave a viscous liquid that was used to process porous SnO2 thin films over conducting glass substrates by the screen-printing method. The deposited layers were annealed in air using a gradual thermal treatment: 325 °C (5 min), 375 °C (5 min), 450 °C (15 min) and 500 °C (15 min). In some cases, the as-prepared films were post-treated with a 40 mM TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min followed by annealing in air at 500 °C for 30 min.HR-SEM and HR-TEM images were recorded with JEOL JSM-6700F and JEOL JEM-2200FS microscopes, respectively. Nitrogen sorption (BET) analyses were performed with a Micromeritics ASAP 2010 equipment on large quantities (≈100 mg) of films scraped off the substrate. Before each analysis, samples were degassed at 150 °C under a vacuum for a time interval long enough to reach a constant pressure (<10 μm Hg). The specific surface areas (SBET) were calculated using the BET equation between 0.1 and 0.3 relative pressure values (P/P0). Mesopore size distributions were deduced from the Barrett, Joyner, Halenda (BJH) method applied to the adsorption branch of the nitrogen adsorption isotherm.21 The calculation was performed by the Micromeritics software package which uses the recurrent method and applies the Harkins and Jura equation for the multilayer thickness. X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies were carried out with a Bruker AXS diffractometer (D2 PHASER A26-X1-A2B0D3A) using a Cu anode (Kα radiation). X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded with a 220i-XL ESCALAB from VG equipped with a Mg Kα (1253.6 eV) X-ray source.2.4. DSC fabrication and characterizationFreshly sintered SnO2-based photoanodes were immersed in a 5 × 10−4 M solution of the dye N719 ([Ru(LL′-(NCS)2)], L = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-dicarboxylic acid, L′ = 2,2′-bipyridyl-4,4′-ditetrabutylammonium carboxylate, Solaronix) in acetonitrile:tert-butanol (1:1) for 24 h. After washing with acetonitrile and drying in air, the amount of chemisorbed dyes was estimated by dye-desorption under basic conditions according to literature procedures.22 The anchoring mode of N719 onto the SnO2 electrodes was then studied by Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy using a ThermoNicolet 670 Nexus spectrophotometer at a resolution of 4 cm−1. Experiments were performed using a single reflection ATR accessory (Specac) equipped with a diamond crystal and a liquid nitrogen cooled narrow-band mercury cadmium telluride (MCT) detector. The dye-modified SnO2 photoanodes were then assembled with a platinum counter-electrode using a hot-melt Surlyn polymer gasket and the iodine-based electrolyte (EL-HPE, DyeSol) was introduced into the cell by vacuum back-filling as previously described.23 The as-obtained cells (working area of 0.159 cm2 defined using a black mask) were then illuminated by a AM1.5G solar simulator calibrated with a radiometer (IL 1400BL) to provide an incident irradiance of 100 mW cm−2 and the I–V responses were measured with a Keithley model 2400 digital source meter (Keithley). The Incident Photon to Charge Carrier Efficiency (IPCE) data were collected from 300 to 900 nm using a Xe lamp associated with a monochromator (Triax 180, Jobin Yvon). No bias light was employed to illuminate the cell. The current produced was measured by steps of 5 nm after 2 s of radiation exposure with a Keithley 6487 picoammeter in order to be under steady state conditions. The incident photon flux was measured with a 6-in. diameter calibrated integrated sphere (Labsphere) and a silicon detector. Photovoltage decay measurements were carried out by illuminating the DSCs with a blue diode (emission: 460 nm) monitored with a tension generator (Keithley 3390). The resulting signals were recorded with an oscilloscope (Textronix, GF266). Electrical impedance spectra were recorded with a Bio-Logic CP3C potentiostat–galvanostat under 100 mW cm−2 AM1.5G illumination. Impedance data were measured at the open-circuit voltage of the devices, the frequency varying from 105 to 10−2 Hz and the voltage amplitude being 20 mV. The Zview software (Scribner Associates Inc.) was used to fit the impedance spectra.3. Results and discussion3.1. Materials and photoanode characterizationPristine SnO2-based nano-objects were synthesized following two different procedures. First, hydrothermal treatment of a colloidal suspension of tin dioxide particles followed by annealing in air at 500 °C gave well-crystallized 13 nm diameter nanoSnO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 1A and B), d-spacings estimated from HR-TEM images being consistent with the formation of rutile-like tin dioxide. The second procedure involves the gradual hydrolysis of SnCl4 in the presence of a suitable amount of HCl and low-molecular weight polyvinylpyrrolidone to limit aggregation phenomena. After drying and calcination, this led to both size and shape polydispersed octaSnO2 particles, with a majority of pseudo-octahedral nano-objects showing very smooth surfaces, edge-to-edge width of about 50–150 nm and apex-to-apex length of about 75–300 nm, according to SEM and TEM images (Fig. 1C and D). Moreover, the lattice fringes observed in HR-TEM images of octaSnO2 particles (Fig. 1E and F) correspond to the (211) planes of rutile-like SnO2. Then, three main architecture of SnO2-based photoanodes were processed using the screen-printing method: (i) a layer of nanoSnO2 particles alone; (ii) a bilayered structure made of a layer of nanoSnO2 particles on top of which was deposited a layer of octaSnO2 particles (nanoSnO2_octaSnO2); and (iii) a mixture of nanoSnO2 and octaSnO2 nanoparticles at a ratio of 7:3 (nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2) in line with what was done for TiO2-based electrodes.19a For the sake of comparison, a photoanode composed of octaSnO2 particles only was also fabricated (octaSnO2). In the absence of any post-treatment, SEM images shown in Fig. 2 revealed that the nanoSnO2 films were made of a porous network of aggregated nanoparticles, the size of which was lower than 20 nm, while the nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 photoanodes showed a porous structure including both types of particles. Moreover, the surface of the octaSnO2 particles in nanoSnO2_octaSnO2 and nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 photoanodes was still smooth and regular indicating that these particles remained unaltered upon screen-printing deposition. The crystalline phase and size of the SnO2 particles included in the various films were evaluated from powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements. As shown in Fig. 3A, XRD patterns of nanoSnO2 and octaSnO2 nanoparticulate films without post-treatment can be easily indexed to the standard rutile-like crystalline structure of SnO2 (cassiterite, space group: P42/mmm, JCPDS file no. 41-1445). According to Scherrer's formula, the mean size of the crystallites that comprise the nanoSnO2 and octaSnO2 particles were deduced from the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the more intense XRD peaks. Derived from the FWHM of the peak at 26.8° corresponding to the (110) reflection, the average crystallite sizes in nanoSnO2 and octaSnO2 nanoparticulate films were estimated to be 9.5 ± 0.5 and 50 ± 2.5 nm, respectively. Furthermore, no significant change was detected in the XRD spectra of the nanoSnO2 and octaSnO2 nanoparticulate films after TiCl4 post-treatment, the mean crystallite size remaining unchanged. As a consequence, the TiCl4 treatment did not necessarily induce the formation of crystalline TiO2 particles at the tin dioxide surface notwithstanding some literature reports.16a,17a Fig. 1  HR-TEM (A and B) images of as-prepared nanoSnO2 nanoparticles; SEM (C), TEM (D) and HR-TEM (E and F) images of as-prepared octaSnO2 particles.

Inset: pore size distribution of bare nanoSnO2 (square, black) and nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 (circle, blue). The specific surface area and the pore size distribution of scraped off films were characterized using N2 sorption analyses, and the results are given in Fig. 3B (and Fig. S1†). First of all, the octaSnO2 photoanode exhibited a type-II N2 sorption isotherm, characteristic of a non-porous or macroporous material with low BET surface area and pore volume (4.5 m2 g−1 and 0.014 cm3 g−1 respectively). In contrast, bare nanoSnO2 and nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 layers showed type-IV N2 sorption isotherms with a single capillary condensation step, typical of mesoporous materials with an average pore diameter of about 16–17 nm. The BET surface area and pore volume of nanoSnO2 (resp. nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2) layers were calculated to be 71 m2 g−1 (resp. 57 m2 g−1) and 0.32 cm3 g−1 (resp. 0.23 cm3 g−1). After TiCl4 post-treatment, nanoSnO2 and nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 materials retain type-IV N2 sorption isotherms (Fig. S1†) but a slight decrease in BET surface area (57 and 44 m2 g−1) and pore volume (0.25 and 0.19 cm3 g−1) was observed. Taking into account the bulk density of SnO2, these values are much higher than those of commercial SnO2 particles (Sigma-Aldrich, SBET < 10 m2 g−1)11 and TiO2-coated SnO2 hollow microspheres (27 m2 g−1).17a Conversely, a slight increase in the BET surface area (6.5 m2 g−1) was evidenced for the octaSnO2 photoanode after TiCl4 treatment. TEM images of the various nanoparticles before and after TiCl4 post-treatment revealed that no noticeable morphology or structure change was undergone by the nanoSnO2 nanoparticles (Fig. 4A) while the octaSnO2 particles exhibited a significant enhancement of the surface roughness (Fig. 4B). As a result, the TiCl4 post-treatment seems to reduce the surface nanodefects present on the nanoSnO2 nanoparticles, inducing a slight decrease in surface area and pore volume, whereas it makes rougher the surface of the octaSnO2 particles with octahedral facets, enhancing their specific surface area. Fig. 4  TEM images of scraped off nanoSnO2 (A) and octaSnO2 (B) layers after TiCl4 post-treatment. To get further insight into the changes in chemical composition induced by the TiCl4 post-treatment, nanoSnO2 and nanoSnO2_octaSnO2 photoanodes have been studied by XPS before and after TiCl4 post-treatment (Fig. S2–S4†). The energies of the typical lines detected in each case are gathered in Table 1. Regardless of the photoanode studied, tin (Sn 3d, Sn 4d) and oxygen (O 1s) related emissions were detected in the survey (Fig. S2†). The Sn 3d spectra reveal spin orbital splitting of the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 core level states of tin centered at 486.6 ± 0.1 eV and 495.0 ± 0.1 eV respectively, which were symmetric and assigned to lattice tin oxide. The separation between the Sn 3d5/2 and Sn 3d3/2 levels (8.4 ± 0.1 eV) corresponds to the standard spectrum of commercial or sol–gel cassiterite SnO2 reported in the literature.24 Moreover, XPS studies clearly evidenced the presence of titanium in the films post-treated with TiCl4, the bound energies found for Ti 2p1/2 and Ti 2p3/2 (464.4 and 458.8 eV) corresponding to those expected for titanium oxide.25 As a consequence, the TiCl4 treatment induced the formation of small and poorly crystallized titanium oxide entities onto the surface of the SnO2 particles constituting the different photoanode.

In the reflection spectrum of the neat N719, an intense resonance band was detected at 2101 cm−1 that corresponds to the thiocyanate (νCN) ligands. The bands at 1713 and 1247 cm−1 can be assigned to the carboxylic acid functions (νCO and νC–O respectively), while the bands at 1607 and 1365 cm−1 can be attributed to the asymmetric (νCOO−asym) and symmetric (νCOO−sym) stretching modes of the carboxylate groups, respectively. The difference between the carboxylate resonance bands (Δνsalt = νCOO−asym − νCOO−sym = 242 cm−1) is consistent with that reported in the literature.26 Regardless of the photoanode nature and the post-treatment used, drastic changes took place in the bands corresponding to the carboxyl functions after dye-sensitization. Indeed, the signals observed for the carboxylic acid functions collapsed, with concomitant increase of the resonance bands of the carboxylate groups at 1603 (νCOO−asym) and 1372 (νCOO−sym) cm−1 (Fig. S5†). Given that the contributions of the nonequivalent oxygen atoms almost disappeared after adsorption of the N719 dye on SnO2, the chemisorption occurred through a bridging or bidentate coordination mode as previously proposed for N719-sensitized TiO2 films on the basis of spectroscopic and computational reports.26,27 The lower carboxylate difference calculated for the N719-sensitized SnO2 film (Δνads = 231 cm−1) supports the bridging coordination mode as suggested for TiO2-based photoanodes.26 The calculated amounts of chemisorbed dyes, determined via dye desorption (Table 2), are in good agreement with specific surface areas and film thicknesses of various photoanodes, nanoSnO2 and nanoSnO2_octaSnO2 showing the best capacity for anchoring the dye. Moreover, the dye amounts (0.7 to 1.4 10−7 mol cm−2) fall within the range of those reported for efficient TiO2,19a ZnO28 and SnO2-based17b DSCs.

Photovoltaic performancesDSCs were assembled from the different photoanodes described above, and tested under AM1.5G irradiation (100 mW cm−2) using a commercial iodide–iodine based liquid electrolyte. Except for octaSnO2 electrodes, the devices just after assembling showed good performances for SnO2-based DSCs, with overall energy conversion efficiencies (η) of 1.6–1.9% without post-treatment and 2.4–3.2% for TiCl4 treated photoanodes (Table S1†). All these values, above 1.5%, are in the range of those reported for nanocrystalline SnO2-based DSCs,9,16 the TiCl4 post-treatment giving rise to a significant increase in Voc of about 70–80 mV. In contrast, octaSnO2 photoanodes led to lower efficiencies, i.e. 0.5% (resp. 0.7%) without (resp. with) TiCl4 post-treatment, mainly due to small Jsc and FF that could be attributed to the low surface area of the octaSnO2 particles, and also to weak adhesion onto the FTO–glass substrate. Nonetheless, Voc values were rather high (i.e. 600–700 mV) for SnO2-based DSCs that can be related to lower recombination phenomena due to the regular shape of the octaSnO2 particles.13,14 As a consequence, due to their more promising performances, DSCs fabricated with nanoSnO2, nanoSnO2_octaSnO2 and nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 photoanodes were further investigated. Thus, an unexpected gradual increase of their photovoltaic performances upon aging under ambient conditions was observed over 20–28 days and remained almost unchanged up to 40 days. The corresponding characteristic current density–voltage (J–V) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) curves are depicted in Fig. 5. The photovoltaic parameters inferred from the J–V curves are summarized in Table 2. All DSCs showed high short-circuit current density (Jsc) values above 9 mA cm−2, good fill factor (FF) above 54% and open-circuit photovoltage (Voc) values above 440 mV. Remarkably high efficiencies (η = 3.1 to 3.2%) were obtained with the cells based on nanoSnO2 and nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 photoanodes without any post-treatment. Fig. 5  Current density–voltage curves recorded under AM1.5G illumination (100 mW cm−2) and incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency profiles (inset) for N719-sensitized nanoSnO2 (square, black), nanoSnO2_octaSnO2 (triangle, red) and nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 (circle, blue) photoanodes without any post-treatment (A) and after TiCl4 post-treatment (B). In particular, the device assembled with a bare nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 photoanode showed Jsc of 9.43 mA cm−2, Voc of 573 mV, FF of 59% and η of 3.19% which is the highest efficiency reported so far for pure SnO2-based DSCs involving N719 as the sensitizer along with a I3−/I− electrolyte.14,29 These remarkable performances stem from a simultaneous improvement of both Voc and FF upon aging under ambient conditions as shown in Fig. 6. In particular, the rather high Voc value constitutes the most interesting feature in the characterization of these photoanodes. According to the standard potential of the I3−/I− redox couple (E° = 0.30–0.53 V vs. NHE, depending on the solvent and the electrolyte concentration)30 and taking into account the position of the conduction band of SnO2 (EF = 0.0 V vs. NHE) the Voc value observed is comparable to the maximum reachable one, Voc max. ≈ 500 mV. As suggested by Gubbala et al. in the case of SnO2 nanowires,13 anisotropic octaSnO2 particles with a single crystal surface (as shown in Fig. 1D–F) seem to favor a negative shift in their flat-band potential compared to spheroid nanoSnO2 particles showing a high degree of surface polycrystallinity with numerous facets and a large number of edge sites. Fig. 6  Evolution of the photovoltaic parameters as a function of aging under ambient conditions for DSCs including bare nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 (circle, blue) and TiCl4 post-treated nanoSnO2_octaSnO2 (up-triangle, red) photoanodes. Furthermore, even though the amount of adsorbed dyes in nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 photoanodes is lower than those in the other two types of electrodes, due to a lower specific surface area, the Jsc value is still high, revealing that a large quantity of chemisorbed dyes is active for the photovoltaic conversion. It is also worth mentioning that nanoSnO2 photoanodes led to excellent conversion yields, η = 3.12%, for pure SnO2-based DSCs, the high Jsc value arising from the large amount of chemisorbed dyes counterbalancing the lower Voc and FF values, closely related to the nanoparticulate nature of these electrodes. In addition, TiCl4 post-treatment of the photoanodes gave rise to further improvements.This is comparable to what has been reported for meso-SnO2 electrodes coated with a thin TiO2 layer.16a Furthermore, TiCl4 post-treatment of nanoSnO2_octaSnO2 electrodes allowed η to increase up to 4.05% with Jsc of 11.34 mA cm−2, Voc of 559 mV and FF of 64%. This significant improvement in the device performance of the bilayered photoanodes can be chiefly assigned to the increase in Jsc and Voc, and to better FF. As for the untreated electrodes, the power conversion efficiency increases over 20 days after DSC fabrication and then stabilizes between 3.6 and 4% (Fig. 6).For each type of DSC, the shape of the IPCE curve corresponds to that of the absorption spectrum of N719-sensitized SnO2 electrodes (Fig. 5, inset). The differences in the IPCE profiles are correlated with those of the Jsc values as a function of the photoanode nature and of the post-treatment used. Maximum quantum efficiencies of 54–64% and 60–68% were measured for untreated and TiCl4 post-treated photoanodes, respectively, corresponding to the maximum absorption wavelength of the adsorbed N719 dye. For untreated photoanodes, these IPCEmax values are significantly higher than those reported for SnO2-based photoanodes made of nanoparticles,31 nanorods13 or nanoflowers.14 A similar trend was also found for TiCl4 post-treated electrodes, the bilayer SnO2-based photoanode leading to a record IPCEmax of 68%.16a As widely discussed in the case of TiO2-based photoanodes,19b TiCl4 post-treatment is also greatly beneficial in the case of SnO2-based photoelectrodes for DSCs. For each photoanode herein studied, TiCl4 post-treatment significantly improved the Jsc values. In DSCs, the short-circuit current density is governed by the following factors: initial number of photo-generated carriers, injection efficiency of electrons from excited dye molecules to the conduction band of the metal oxide and collection rate of the photoinjected electrons at the front electrode without recombination with the oxidized dye and/or the redox mediator. As this treatment induced the formation of titanium oxide species (see above), the enhancement in Jsc can stem from: (i) higher injection rate of electrons from excited ruthenium dyes to TiO2-based layers (<100 fs) than to SnO2-based nanoparticulate films (4 ps);32 (ii) faster electron collection owing to necking of the SnO2 nanoparticles that favors percolation of the charge carriers;19b (iii) higher electron lifetime. The latter feature will be addressed below.It is also worth noting that these systems showed an unusual behavior in DSCs involving a liquid acetonitrile-based electrolyte since an increase in efficiency was evidenced over an extended period of time, up to 20 days. This trend was observed for each type of cell studied here whatever the photoanode architecture and the post-treatment employed. Even though no standard soaking stability tests were used, this increasing efficiency with time had to be underlined as it has been scarcely ever reported.9d3.3. Electronic processesTo better understand the electronic and ionic transport processes involved in these systems, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were performed under illumination at Voc of the various DSCs herein studied. The EIS spectra are depicted in Fig. 7. Regardless of the nature of the post-treatment used, two main relaxation loops were observed from the Nyquist plots in each case. These features can be rationalized as follows: the high-frequency loop (in the kHz range) can be assigned to the redox reaction at the counter-electrode and the loop observed at low frequency (in the range of 10 to 100 Hz) can be related to charge transfers occurring at the photoanode–dye–electrolyte interface. However, it can be underlined that another weak contribution at lower frequency (in the range of 0.01 to 1 Hz) was detected for some post-treated electrodes, probably related to Nernst diffusion of the electrolyte in the interspace between the electrodes, presumably due to a less-opened porosity. These features can be analyzed by means of a classical equivalent electrical circuit including a serial resistance (Rs) due to the contact and two resistance-CPE systems modelling the charge transfers at the counter-electrode and at the photoanode–dye–electrolyte interface, respectively. Constant Phase Elements (CPE), the impedance of which can be expressed as ZCPE = 1/T(jω)p, have been employed to take into account the dispersion of capacitances. The interfacial capacitance at the photoanode–dye–electrolyte interface, Cint, can be then determined from the resistance and CPE parameters according to:33 (1)with RPt and Rct being the charge transfer resistances at the counter electrode and the photoanode–dye–electrolyte interface, Tct and p being the CPE parameters at the photoanode–dye–electrolyte interface. A time constant τ = RctCint can then be calculated that is usually identified as the electron lifetime in DSCs since the space charge contribution to Cint can be neglected at Voc.34 Applying this model to EIS spectra led to the equivalent circuit parameters listed in Table 3. First of all, Rs (8–17 Ω) and RPt (4–7 Ω) were rather similar for each cell studied and in the range of those reported for efficient SnO2-based DSCs.9e Furthermore, both charge transfer resistance Rct and interfacial capacitance Cint decrease upon TiCl4 treatment, and to a lesser extent, for photoanodes involving both kinds of particles. The time constants τ therefore follow the same trend and fall within the range of 10–45 ms, which is longer than that in ZnO-based DSCs (2–19 ms)35 but drastically shorter than that in TiO2-based DSCs (50–100 ms).36 It is also worthwhile to mention that the diminishing of the time constant for all the photoanodes post-treated with TiCl4 is fully consistent with previously reported data in the literature for TiO2-based DSCs.37 Nonetheless, definitive conclusions concerning recombination kinetics can be hardly drawn from these data since the time constants measured result from two antagonistic effects, i.e. electronic transport in the nanoporous electrode and electron recombination at the photoanode–dye–electrolyte interface.

Changes in the dark current were first examined (Fig. 8A and B). In general, the recombination of electrons in the semiconducting oxide with I3−/I− in the electrolyte strongly affects this current. Here we observed that the onset of the dark current occurred at a higher potential for photoanodes including both kinds of particles, the effect being even much greater for those post-treated with TiCl4. Considering the high crystallinity and edge regularity of octaSnO2 particles, the lowering of surface trap density reduces charge injection in the untreated photoanodes nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 and nanoSnO2_octaSnO2. It thus shifts the dark current–voltage characteristics to higher voltage values. Actually, surface trap density plays a crucial role in the recombination rate. This point is highlighted with transient photovoltage decay (see below). Furthermore, the electronic affinity decrease of the photoanodes upon TiCl4 post-treatment, the latter leading to the formation of titanium oxide species onto the SnO2 particles, induces a potential barrier hindering the back reaction with the I3−/I− redox couple. On the other hand, transient photovoltage decay measurements constitute another powerful method to monitor the electron lifetime and charge recombination following photoinduced excitation of the DSCs. The electron lifetime (τe) can be inferred from the transient voltage Voc by using eqn (2):38 (2)where k is the Boltzmann constant, e the elementary charge and T the absolute temperature. Fig. 8  Current density–voltage curves recorded in the dark (A and B) and charge carrier lifetime (C and D) for N719-sensitized nanoSnO2 (square, black), nanoSnO2_octaSnO2 (triangle, red) and nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 (circle, blue) photoanodes with (B and D) or without (A and C) TiCl4 post-treatment. Monitoring the transient Voc as a function of time when switching off the light leads to the electron recombination kinetics. Under light illumination, the steady state is reached when the recombination rate balances the generation rate. After the light is switched off, the generation rate equals zero and electron recombinations induce a Voc decay which is directly related to the electron lifetime. Regardless of the nature of the post-treatment, higher electron lifetimes were determined for photoanodes involving both kinds of particles, the bilayered photoanode nanoSnO2 & octaSnO2 yielding the highest τe values (Fig. 8C and D). This point is in good agreement with a reduction of surface trap density resulting from the high crystallinity and edge regularity of octaSnO2 particles. It implies an increase of charge density under illumination at a given intensity in order to get the balance of generation and recombination rates compared to that of nanoSnO2 photoanode. Moreover, the TiCl4 treatment has significantly enhanced the electron lifetimes for each photoanode studied (Fig. 8D) revealing that more electrons surviving from the back reaction contribute to Jsc and Voc improvements. All these data are therefore fully consistent with the changes observed for the photovoltaic parameters as a function of the nature of the photoanode and post-treatment (Table 2). Lower electron recombination rates increase the electron density in the semiconducting photoanodes, which induces an enhancement of the resulting fill factor and open-circuit photovoltage.ConclusionsTwo types of SnO2 nanocrystals, i.e. 10–15 nm spheroid cassiterite nanoparticles and 50–150 nm pseudo-octahedral anisotropic cassiterite particles, have been obtained by solution routes. Various combinations of these particles were examined and deposition by the screen-printing technique led to three different types of nanoporous SnO2-based electrodes. The texture, composition and morphology of these photoanodes were eventually modified by applying a post-treatment with TiCl4. After sensitization by the N719 dye and incorporation in DSCs with a liquid electrolyte, the photoanodes including a mixture of both kinds of particles yielded an overall energy conversion efficiency of 3.2% that represents a record value for pure SnO2-based photoanode. A very promising power conversion yield, above 4%, was also achieved with bilayered SnO2-based photoanodes after post-treatment with TiCl4. The remarkable photovoltaic performances of the photoanodes including both kinds of particles, associated or not with a TiCl4 post-treatment, were due to improved Voc and FF values and were related to: (i) the onset of dark current occurring at higher potential; (ii) enhanced electron lifetimes as determined by transient Voc decay measurements; and (iii) lower charge transfer resistance at the SnO2–N719–electrolyte interface. Finally, the most striking feature of this study concerns the improvement of power conversion efficiency upon aging under ambient conditions and the amazing long-term stability of the devices fabricated from the different SnO2-based photoanodes since standard DSCs built from N719 dye and I3−/I− electrolytes usually show a fast decrease of efficiency. Further work is in progress to rationalize the increase in efficiency upon aging for three weeks under ambient conditions.AcknowledgementsMrs Odile Babot and Christine Labrugère, and M.
