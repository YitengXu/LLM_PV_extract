    , Accepted 23rd February 2023First published on 27th February 2023AbstractWe explored nitrofluorene derivatives as tunable electron-withdrawing groups for acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) type non-fullerene acceptors. Their optoelectronic properties and performance in bulk heterojunction solar cells with PBDB-T donor polymer are reported. Introducing up to four nitro groups to the fluorene unit results in deeper frontier orbital levels, reduced HOMO–LUMO gap and red-shifted absorption bands. Optimal device performance was achieved for trinitrofluorene acceptors with a solubilizing ester group in the trade-off between decreased voltage and increased photocurrent. 2D brickwork packing of the tetranitrofluorene derivative found by single crystal X-ray analysis is different from the interpenetrating 3D network found for high-efficiency A–D–A acceptors and might be the reason for the poor charge transport properties. Steric hindrance between benzothiadiazole and nitrofluorene units can be relieved by the use of furan linkers, which planarized the conjugated backbone but decreased solubility.

10th Anniversary Statement
When the Royal Society of Chemistry announced in 2012 the splitting of the Journal of Material Chemistry (into J. Mater. Chem. A, B and C), many of its authors, including ourselves, were worried about the future of their favorite RSC journal. Ten years forward, the future looks bright. J. Mater. Chem. C continues the tradition of excellent service to its authors. We value the speed of manuscript processing and the transparency of this process. We like the hybrid professional/academic editors system, and we rely on the quality of articles published in J. Mater. Chem. C. It remains the RSC journal in which we publish most frequently. Happy Anniversary! (Igor and Dmytro Perepichka).

Introduction
Over the last decade, organic photovoltaics (OPVs) have seen tremendous advances toward the goal of offering clean, renewable and inexpensive energy source.1–4 Beside the development of conjugated polymers,5–7 a significant part of the progress arises from the refined molecular design of non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs), which enjoys the benefit of structural diversity and enhanced optical absorption over their fullerene predecessors.8–13 In particular, acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) architecture has recently attracted great interest.14,15 Its success in OPV devices is attributed to the strong quadruple interaction leading to efficient π–π stacking and a special three-dimensional interpenetrating network enabling isotropic charge transport.16–18 With the introduction of new A–D–A type materials including the IT-series19–21 and Y-series,22–25 a power conversion efficiency (PCE) above 18% has been achieved with single-junction devices, opening up the door for the commercial application of OPV technology.
Currently, several acceptor end-groups have been incorporated in A–D–A molecules, including cyanoacetate,26 malononitrile,27,28 rhodanine derivatives,29–31 1,1-dicyanomethylene-3-indanone (INCN) or its analogs,19,32,33 barbiturate34,35 and acenaphthenone derivatives.36 Most of these building blocks employed cyano (CN) groups as the main electron-withdrawing functionality. Halogen atoms including fluorine20 and chlorine,21 and occasionally trifluoromethyl groups37,38 were also used to further enhance the acceptor strength. However, relatively little attention has been paid to nitro (NO2) groups,39 despite being one of the strongest electron-withdrawing groups (Hammett constants σp/σm for NO2 and CN substituents are 0.78/0.71 and 0.66/0.56, respectively).40 Nitrobenzene was once incorporated in the NFA backbone in light of its simplicity and achieved a PCE of ∼2%.41 Only recently, nitro-based end-groups have been incorporated into the A–D–A architecture and achieved reasonable performance, although the success is largely built on top of the already well-developed INCN acceptor.42 Featuring an extended conjugation and efficient π-stacking, nitrofluorene derivatives were used in the fabrication of supramolecular liquid crystals to enhance charge carrier mobility.43 This old yet largely overlooked class of electron acceptors offers excellent synthetic flexibility enabling fine-tuning of electron affinity, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT, when combined with electron-donating moieties) and crystallization behavior.44–46 Our recent work showed the promise of nitrofluorenones as semiconductors47 or dopants48 for organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). These results motivated us to further explore nitrofluorenes in the design of A–D–A acceptors for OPV applications.
Herein, we report the synthesis, electronic structure and OPV device performance of a new series of NFAs combining nitrofluorene electron-withdrawing termini and the classical indacenodithiophenebis(benzothiadiazole) (IDTB) core,49 and compare their electronic properties to those of rhodanine-based NFAs. The nitrofluorene NFAs show a broad absorption band extending to the near-infrared (NIR) region. This band is red-shifted with more nitro groups, resulting in optical band-gaps (Eg) as low as 1.25 eV in the solid state. The large steric size of fluorene termini compared to rhodanine (and most other termini used in NFAs) causes a significant twist of the molecule which can be mitigated by the incorporation of furan linkers. The photovoltaic efficiency, tested in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) devices with the common PBDB-T donor polymer, is limited by low solubility and electron mobility of fluorene-based NFAs. These problems can be partially mitigated with solubilizing alkoxycarbonyl substituents and planarization of the NFA backbone using a furan linker.
Results and discussion
Synthesis
All the NFAs were synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of the core dialdehyde with CH-acidic electron-deficient compounds (3-ethylrhodanine or nitrofluorenes, Scheme 1). Standard nitrating conditions readily introduce 2–4 nitro groups to the 2-, 4-, 5- and 7-positions of the fluorene precursors, enabling a synthetic control over their electron-deficiency (Scheme S1, ESI†). These nitro groups also enhance the acidity of the methylene protons, making nitrofluorenes ideal for Knoevenagel condensation under mild conditions (pyridine/acetic acid, pyridine or DMF depending on the number of nitro groups) with up to 96% yield. Initial targets were synthesized with an IDTB core and their properties were compared to the previously reported O-IDTBR.29 Subsequently, placement of furan in between benzothiadiazole and the acceptor terminus (IDTBF series) was explored to relieve their steric hindrance and enhance backbone planarity. This incorporation of furan was achieved through sequential palladium-catalyzed Suzuki coupling of 4,7-dibromobenzothiadiazole with boron-functionalized furan and indacenodithiophene precursors (Scheme S1, ESI†). The presence of furan in nitrofluorene NFAs results in a significantly more planar backbone (discussed later) but also much lower solubility (only mitigated with long hexadecyl and 2-octyldodecyl side chains). In addition, IT-TNFC4 with an indacenodithienothiophene (IT) donor core was also synthesized for this study.

Optical and electronic properties
UV-Vis-NIR absorption spectra of the NFAs in dichloromethane (DCM) solution show a broad ICT band (Eg = 1.7–1.4 eV) with comparable extinction coefficients (∼0.8–1.0 × 105 M−1 cm−1). This band is red-shifted upon increasing the number of nitro groups on the nitrofluorene acceptor (Fig. 1a and Table 1). The optical energy gap of the NFAs is further reduced upon incorporation of furan linkers. Compared to solutions, absorption bands in the solid state are further red-shifted and extend to ∼1000 nm (Eg = 1.25 eV) for the tetranitro derivatives (Fig. 1b). While the solid-state absorption bands are broad and featureless for nitrofluorene NFAs with an IDTB core (IDTB-DNFC4, IDTB-TNFC4 and IDTB-TeNF), clear vibronic splitting was observed in the presence of furan linkers (IDTBF-TNFC8C12 and IDTBF-TeNF) and with IT as the donor core (IT-TNFC4). This is associated with the difference in molecular planarity, as supported by DFT and NMR (discussed below). All nitrofluorene NFAs are non-emissive, as commonly observed for nitroaromatics, likely due to efficient intersystem crossing (ISC) and rotational relaxation induced by the nitro groups.50

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of all studied NFAs showed two reversible oxidation waves (Fig. 1c and Table S1, ESI†). While quasi-reversible reduction was observed with O-IDTBR at 0.1 V s−1, at this scan rate the reduction of all other NFAs was electrochemically irreversible as is commonly seen among similar A–D–A acceptors (e.g. ITIC).19 The electrochemically determined HOMO levels are significantly raised upon the incorporation of furan moiety by ∼0.1 eV (cf. IDTBF vs. IDTB series, Table 1), but are less sensitive to the change of the acceptor unit. Also, the replacement of the IDTB core by IT significantly stabilizes the HOMO (cf.IT-TNFC4vs.IDTB-TNFC4, Table 1). In contrast, the LUMO levels of the NFAs strongly depend on the electron deficiency of the acceptor unit, where each additional nitro group leads to 200–300 meV lower LUMO levels. While (butoxycarbonyl)dinitrofluorene shows similar electron-affinity to rhodanine (LUMO of IDTB-DNFC4 at −3.53 eV vs.O-IDTBR at −3.52 eV), tetranitrofluorene as the acceptor end group (IDTB-TeNF, −4.04 eV) results in a dramatic 0.5 eV stabilization of the LUMO compared to rhodanine. Generally, the trend in the frontier orbital levels agreed well with DFT calculations (Fig. 1d). Excellent correlation was observed between the DFT-calculated and experimental (CV) LUMO energy levels for all studied NFAs (Fig. S1a, ESI†). However, two closely-spaced linear correlations were observed for the HOMO energy levels of IDTB and IDTBF series, with significant deviation for IT-TNFC4 (Fig. S1b, ESI†). This explains the poor correlation between the computed and experimental HOMO–LUMO gaps for the whole set of acceptors (Fig. S1c, ESI†).
Planarity
It was previously shown that the planarity of conjugated molecules can be evaluated by extracting the planarity index 〈cos2φ〉 from the rotational population distribution of the dihedral angle φ over the bridging C–C bonds.52 Most of the known efficient A–D–A NFAs have a highly planar backbone with 〈cos2φ〉 >0.9 between the donor core and the acceptor termini.52 To examine the compatibility of nitrofluorenes with commonly used donors, DFT dihedral scans were performed over the bridging C–C bond between various donor–acceptor dyads (Fig. 2) and 〈cos2φ〉 was calculated. While a highly planar backbone can be obtained by bridging benzothiadiazole with rhodanine (lowest-energy dihedral angle, φ* = 0°), using dinitrofluorene as the acceptor induces a significant twist (φ* = 45°) and is expected to be detrimental. However, furan as the donor results in much higher planarity (〈cos2φ〉 = 0.962) compared to thiophene (〈cos2φ〉 = 0.804) and especially benzothiadiazole (〈cos2φ〉 = 0.448). This is due to the less steric hindrance of furan and secondary interaction between oxygen and the adjacent fluorene hydrogen. Enhanced planarity of the conjugated backbone is our main premise behind the use of furan to bridge nitrofluorenes in the IDTBF design. This planarity is experimentally supported by NMR showing a significantly down-shifted proton at the 2-position of the nitrofluorene end-group for IDTBF-TeNF (10.45 ppm) compared to IDTB-TeNF (∼9.2 ppm), indicative of the former proton residing in the deshielding region of the aromatic furan ring. The presence of furan linkers also results in significantly lower reorganization energy (0.103 eV for IDTBF-TeNFvs. 0.204 eV for IDTB-TeNF), which is also among the lowest reported so far for NFAs.53

Solid-state packing
Single crystals of IDTB-TeNF and IDTBF-R were grown by slow diffusion of acetone vapor into a solution of the NFA in chloroform or toluene. Single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals a 2D brickwork packing for IDTB-TeNF with two (half-)molecules in the asymmetric unit (green/red), in contrast to O-IDTBR and IDTBF-R forming 3D reticular networks (Fig. 3). The dihedral angle between IDT and benzothiadiazole units is <10°, while large twists of ∼38° were observed with the nitrofluorene termini, in line with DFT calculations (2° and 36°, respectively). Electronic couplings |J| of 15–30 meV for LUMO were calculated along the π-stack of the nitrofluorene acceptors, suggesting good electron transfer through the 2D network. However, efficient charge propagation is likely hampered by the lack of charge percolation channels along the third direction.

Device studies
BHJ solar cells were fabricated with an inverted configuration (glass/ITO/ZnO/blend/MoO3/Ag) to elucidate the structure-property-performance relationships and demonstrate their application in OPVs (Fig. 4 and Table 2). Commercially available PBDB-T was employed as the electron-donor polymer as it offers complementary optical absorption and energetics matching the NFAs investigated in this study. The reference devices (PBDB-T:O-IDTBR) exhibited an average PCE of 8.5%, slightly higher than previously reported results for the same donor–acceptor pair (∼7.5%).54 The nitrofluorene NFAs showed inferior OPV performance in comparison to O-IDTBR owing to the combined effect of lower open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF). IDTB-TNFC4 based devices yielded the highest PCE of 4.5% amongst IDTB-nitrofluorene NFAs. Space-charge limited current (SCLC, Fig. S2, ESI†) measurements revealed more than an order of magnitude lower electron mobility for IDTB-TNFC4 (1 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1) films as compared to O-IDTBR (3 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1). The inefficient electron transport in the BHJ leads to pronounced charge recombination, resulting in lower JSC values. Moreover, the low electron mobility in the blend would also contribute to an imbalance in hole and electron transport, leading to low FF values. The inferior OPV performance metrics for IDTB-nitrofluorene NFAs are not too surprising given their twisted backbone and unfavorable molecular packing, as discussed earlier. The backbone planarization in furan-bridged IDTBF-TNFC8C12 leads to lower calculated reorganization energy for electron transfer and higher measured electron mobility (8 × 10−6 cm2 V−1 s−1), which explains the slightly higher FF. The furan bridge also results in ∼0.1 eV higher LUMO (Table 1) which aided in achieving a superior VOC (0.85 V) compared to its non-bridged counterpart (IDTB-TNFC4, VOC = 0.79 V). However, the unexpectedly lower JSC of the furan-bridged IDTBF-TNFC8C12 compared to the non-bridged IDTB-TNFC4 resulted in the same modest PCE of ∼4%. We note that despite the long alkyl chains IDTBF-TNFC8C12 still shows lower solubility compared to other NFAs and this might also be detrimental for its device performance.

Film morphology
Grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was employed to assess the microstructure of the blend films of the NFAs. The 2D GIWAXS patterns of pristine PBDB-T and its blend with the NFAs are presented in Fig. 5 (the corresponding out-of-plane and in-plane line cuts are shown in Fig. S3, ESI†). The pristine PBDB-T film exhibits an out-of-plane (100) lamellar reflection (qz = 0.31 Å−1) corresponding to the lamellar packing (d100 = 2.0 nm) of the alkylated polymer chains. The PBDB-T:O-IDTBR blend displays the same peak as well as an additional peak at q = 0.45 Å−1 which corresponds well to the d011 = 1.4 nm reflection of O-IDTBR (as expected based on its single crystal structure31). However, the PBDB-T:IDTB-TNFC4 blend does not show any additional features beyond the (100) peak of PBDB-T. Notably, no scattering signature is observed for PBDB-T:IDTBF-TNFC8C12 blend films. This suppression of the film crystallinity for nitrofluorene-based NFAs compared to the O-IDTBR reference could be a result of their excessive miscibility with PBDB-T, possibly due to long alkyl chains on the nitrofluorene termini (required for solubility). Such behavior is detrimental to charge transport and is likely one of the reasons for the low measured JSC and FF.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images show similar surface topography of all studied BHJ films with root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of 3–4 nm (Fig. 6). Qualitatively, more uniform domains and sharper grain boundaries were observed for the O-IDTBR blend, which agrees with the highest crystallinity of this film observed by GIWAXS. However, the comparison between different nitrofluorene NFA blends reveals no clear correlation with the corresponding device performance. Scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging was performed for O-IDTBR, IDTB-TNFC4 and IDTBF-TNFC8C12 blends and revealed a distinct phase separation in all cases, with a coarsened morphology in the latter blend, similar to that observed in AFM (Fig. S4, ESI†).

Conclusion
Two series (IDTB-NF and IDTBF-NF) of A–D–A push-pull type electron acceptors with indacenodithiophene donor core (D) and nitrofluorene termini (A) have been synthesized and used as non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) for bulk heterojunction solar cells. The variation of the structure of the nitrofluorene termini allowed tuning their HOMO and LUMO energies and achieving narrower energy gaps compared to reference acceptors O-IDTBR and IDTBF-R with rhodanine termini. Intramolecular charge transfer in these NFAs results in strong and very broad absorption in the visible and near-infrared region of the spectrum (up to 900 nm), with the optical energy gaps Egopt of ∼1.55–1.25 eV. Incorporation of furan between the D and A moieties (IDTBF-NFvs.IDTB-NF series) raised the HOMO energy levels by ca. 70–100 meV, but weakly affected Eg. The planarity of these compounds was evaluated by DFT using the planarity index 〈cos2φ〉 from the rotational population distribution, showing significant variations with the structures. Single crystal analysis confirmed a much larger twist of nitrofluorene end groups in IDTB-TeNF (∼38°) compared to rhodanine end groups in O-IDTBR (∼8°). While O-IDTBR (and most other high-performing NFAs) show 3D interpenetrating network of π-interactions, a 2D brickwork packing was observed for IDTB-TeNF. The blends of IDTB-NF and IDTBF-NF electron acceptors with PBDB-T polymer donor have been tested in bulk heterojunction solar cells. The structure of the nitrofluorene termini significantly affects the device performance, and highest PCEs were achieved with IDTB-TNFC4 and IDTBF-TNFC8C12 acceptors having long-chain solubilizing ester groups (4.5% and 4.0%, respectively). These values are lower than that for O-IDTBR (8.5%), but higher than for furan-extended IDTBF-R reference (0.7%). These studies show the potential of nitroaromatics (and more specifically nitrofluorenes) as electron-withdrawing building blocks for the design of novel π-electron acceptors and donor-acceptor systems for organic electronics. However, further optimization of the molecular packing and film morphology is required to improve their performance in OPVs.
Experimental
Device fabrications & measurements
Patterned ITO substrates were sonicated sequentially in deionized water with detergent, acetone and isopropanol for 10 min each, dried with a stream of nitrogen and treated with oxygen plasma for 10 min.

10th Anniversary Statement
When the Royal Society of Chemistry announced in 2012 the splitting of the Journal of Material Chemistry (into J. Mater. Chem. A, B and C), many of its authors, including ourselves, were worried about the future of their favorite RSC journal. Ten years forward, the future looks bright. J. Mater. Chem. C continues the tradition of excellent service to its authors. We value the speed of manuscript processing and the transparency of this process. We like the hybrid professional/academic editors system, and we rely on the quality of articles published in J. Mater. Chem. C. It remains the RSC journal in which we publish most frequently. Happy Anniversary! (Igor and Dmytro Perepichka).
