However, because of the undesired properties of ceramic structures, the application of patterning has been limited to a few electrolyte-supported cells with thick electrolyte layers and requires expensive energy-consuming tools. Herein, we report an advanced micro-patterning technique that can be applied to the thin electrolyte of tape-cast anode-supported SOFCs. By employing soft-lithography with a UV curable electrolyte slurry, we fabricated regularly ordered micro-patterns on a thin electrolyte layer, while maximizing the interface area between the cathode and the electrolyte. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements followed by the distribution of relaxation time analysis revealed that with the increase in the triple phase boundary near the patterned interface area, the polarization resistance significantly decreases owing to the facilitated oxygen reduction reactions at the cathode, resulting in a significant improvement in the cell performance. The microstructure and morphology of the patterned cells were investigated by scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The results confirm the feasibility of the facile micro-patterning method in engineering the surfaces of ceramic-based layered electrochemical devices with dramatically improved performance due to enhanced electrochemical reactions.
1. Introduction
Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) have drawn significant attention thanks to their high conversion efficiency (chemical to electrical energy), lack of noxious emissions (given the absence of a combustion process), and direct use of a wide range of hydrocarbon fuels.1,2 When combined with a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC), a SOFC can be considered a rechargeable electrochemical device that can store electric power generated from renewable energy sources, such as solar or wind, in chemical form, e.g., hydrogen fuels.3,4
SOFCs typically operate under high-temperature conditions (>800 °C) because of the sluggish oxygen kinetics at the cathode and the high activation energy, required for oxygen anion transport in dense ceramic electrolytes.5 The high working temperature facilitates the use of transition metal oxides as electrode materials instead of noble metals and helps produce high-quality byproducts that can be used in combined-cycle applications including reforming processes and gas turbines.6,7
A high working temperature may accelerate the degradation in cell performance and lead to the increased balance of plant costs, thus hindering the commercialization of SOFCs.8 The main challenges in reducing the working temperature include slow electrode kinetics and decreased electrolyte conductivity, which result in significant fuel cell losses.9 The sluggish oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode is the main obstacle at intermediate operating temperatures (600–800 °C). To this end, several studies have been conducted on enlarging electrochemically active sites for the ORR. A composite cathode has been used to effectively increase the triple phase boundary (TPB), which is considered the active site for the ORR; this boundary is where the electrolyte, the electronic conducting phase, and the gas phase meet.10 While a composite cathode comprising a cathode material and an ionic conducting phase, e.g., yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), can help expand the ORR active region beyond the TPBs stuck to the physically distinct interface between the cathode and electrolyte layers,11 most electrochemical reactions still take place in the vicinity of the interface, typically within 10 μm.12–15
The cathode performance can be further improved by realizing cathode–electrolyte micro-interface architectures.16–20 The interface area between the cathode and the electrolyte can be enlarged for rapid ORR kinetics by designing a patterned surface over the electrolyte layer.21 Such architectures enable the facile use of state-of-the-art cathodes, such as lanthanum strontium manganese (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3−δ, LSM), which exhibit superior stability and high surface catalytic activity, as the performance of such cathodes is largely influenced by the microstructures determining the TPBs, due to the negligible oxygen ion conductivity.22 Thus far, several ceramic patterning processes have been utilized, such as laser-assisted surface modifying techniques or mechanical machining processes. For instance, Cebollero et al. reported a decrease in the polarization resistance of the LSM–YSZ composite cathode from the laser-machined micro-patterns on the YSZ symmetric cells.16 Cai et al. also illustrated an improved interfacial structure of dimple arrays on an electrolyte layer through laser micro-processing.20 However, top-down approaches, such as mechanical grinding or laser-assisted etching, are limited to electrolyte-supported cells with thick ceramic substrates (which offer enough strength to endure the applied stresses) and require highly energy-consuming tools,17,23 resulting in poor surface conditions.24 Therefore, it is necessary to develop an alternative patterning process that can be economically and stably applied to a thin electrolyte layer while minimizing the ohmic resistance and maximizing the electrode performance.
Soft-lithography is one of the powerful tools to fabricate regularly ordered three-dimensional patterns on various surfaces, with high precision and a great mass-productivity. Since Miura et al. reported micro powder imprinting (μPI) processes on YSZ electrolyte sheets, soft-lithography, which transcribes micro-patterns from elastic polymer molds, especially polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) stamps, has been utilized in fabricating micro-patterns on the electrolyte surface.15,25,26 Although some processes have shown enhanced surface conditions and a large increase of the surface area through various sizes of patterns, these imprinting processes have also failed to replace thick electrolyte substrates with a thin electrolyte layer with thicknesses under 100 μm, sacrificing the overall performance of the cells from a considerable amount of ohmic resistances. Therefore, a successful patterning process, which can be applied to anode supported SOFCs with a thin electrolyte, has not been reported yet.
In the present work, for the first time, we propose an advanced soft-lithography patterning method that can be applied to the thin electrolyte layer (down to 10 μm) of tape-cast anode-supported SOFCs. A UV-curable electrolyte slurry consisting of an optical adhesive (NOA 76) and YSZ powder was screen-printed over cast anode tapes and subsequently sandwiched with patterned PDMS stamps, followed by photo-polymerization. Thanks to the tightly polymerized structures of the polymeric electrolyte layer, we demonstrated a variety of patterns (line, pyramid, and prism) on a thin electrolyte layer (∼10 μm) and minimized the size of the patterns to the smallest scales ever reported for classical bulk SOFCs.27,28 The morphologies of the patterned cells were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The performances of the patterned cells were examined by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and analyzed in terms of the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) from impedance data.
2. Experimental
The fabrication of micro-patterned SOFCs is based on tape casting and soft-lithography techniques. The detailed fabrication processes of the anode tape are described elsewhere.29,30 Briefly, a single anode support layer (ASL) tape was produced from a composite mixture containing NiO (Sumitomo) and 8 mol% Y2O3–ZrO2 (YSZ, Tosho) (NiO/YSZ = 56:44 wt%), with a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) binder, pore former (polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)), and plasticizer (dibutyl phthalate (DBP)). Seven anode sheets and an anode functional layer (AFL), which was produced without PMMA, were stacked together and thermally pressed. The electrolyte slurry consisting of YSZ and the PVB binder (V-006A; Heraeus) was screen printed on the side of the AFL of the laminated tapes to form a base electrolyte layer (BEL) (∼5 μm).
For the additional patterned electrolyte layer (PEL) (∼5 μm), a UV-curable electrolyte slurry was prepared from a mixture of YSZ powder and an organic optical adhesive (NOA 76, Norland) in a ratio of 2:1 wt%. The mixed slurry was screen printed onto the pre-screen-printed BEL. A patterned PDMS mold was then placed and moderately pressed to transcribe the micro-patterns. This set up was cured under a UV light source in the region spanning from 300–350 nm for 1 h. After complete photo-polymerization of the printed slurry, the PDMS mold was carefully stripped off. The resulting stacked tapes were calcined in air for 4 h at 1350 °C. The configurations of patterned cells and the reference cell are illustrated in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1  Schematic images of the proposed configuration of patterned anode-supported SOFCs (a) and reference anode-supported SOFCs (b). 
The cathode slurry consisting of LSM (La0.8Sr0.2MnO3−δ; Kceracell) powder and the PVB binder was also screen printed onto the top of the micro-pattered electrolyte surface. The porous cathode had an active area of 0.26 cm2. To enhance the contact of the cathode slurry with the patterns on the electrolyte surface, the cathode loaded cell was fully dried at room temperature overnight and subsequently fired in air for 2 h at 1100 °C. Finally, an Ag current collector layer was screen-printed on both sides of the electrodes using Ag conductive ink. An Ag paste and a wire were utilized for the current collector and the conformal contact. The cell was placed inside a sample alumina tube using a ceramic adhesive (Aremco 522-VFG). The fabricated cells were tested at 700 and 800 °C with humidified hydrogen (3% H2O) as the fuel and ambient air as the oxidant. The electrochemical performances of the fabricated cells were measured using a potentiostat (IviumStat, Ivium Technologies). Prior to each electrochemical test, a cathodic potential (from −0.7 V to the open-circuit voltage (OCV)) was applied to the cells, whereupon the LSM-based cathodes were fully activated and stabilized. The current–voltage–power (I–V–P) characteristics were determined by applying voltages ranging from 0.4 V to the OCV. AC impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted at frequencies ranging from 250k to 0.1 Hz and at cathodic biases of 0.8 and 0.6 V. The microstructural features of the patterned cells were examined by SEM and AFM (NX-10, Park Systems).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Microstructure
Micro-patterned anode-supported cells were fabricated using laminated tape-cast anode sheets combined with screen-printing and a soft-lithography technique, followed by sintering at 1350 °C for 4 h in air. The resulting patterns formed over the electrolyte surfaces were characterized using SEM. As shown in Fig. 2(a), both the BEL and PEL are uniformly sintered on top of the AFL layer without showing any delamination. When measured from the thinnest valley of the patterned surface, the thickness of the merged electrolyte layers is approximately 10 μm, which is twice the thickness of the BEL (5 μm). The overall shapes of the patterns are effectively transferred from the original patterns on the PDMS molds. The height of the projected patterns is approximately 5 μm, and sharp edges are clearly preserved. Moreover, the observed sizes of patterns are the smallest ever reported in the literature for patterned SOFCs. The perfectly transferred patterns can be attributed to the UV-curable NOA 76 resin. Before exposure to UV light, the mixture containing NOA 76 and YSZ particles freely deforms. This enables the fluidic mixed slurry to permeate the narrow interspaces between the micro-patterns on PDMS, without forming air pockets. Under UV light, the NOA 76 traps the YSZ particles inside the cross-linked polymeric structures through photo-polymerization, finally forming a single hardened polymer layer. The high surface energy of the polymerized NOA 76 networks ensures easy detachment of the imprinted PDMS mold, which has relatively low surface energy (22–25 mN m−1).31Fig. 2(b) shows the SEM images of the un-sintered green electrolyte surfaces right after detaching the PDMS mold, with the patterns exhibiting the same aspect ratios as the sintered patterns. The marginal gaps between the un-sintered and sintered patterns reveal that the cross-linked polymeric matrix of NOA 76 binds the YSZ particles tightly and prevents the collapse of the coagulated chunks of particles during sintering. Moreover, as NOA 76 consists of only organic compounds, it burns out cleanly without creating any undesired secondary phases during sintering, while uniformly maintaining the shapes of the hardened patterns. Therefore, any ceramic layer can be patterned using this process, by switching the ceramic particles in the mixed slurry.

To accurately determine the increase in the interface area through the micro-patterns formed over the electrolyte, the 3D profiles of the patterns on the sintered electrolyte surfaces were characterized by SEM and AFM in non-contact mode. Based on the profiles shown in Fig. S1,† the surface areas of the micro-patterned electrolytes increased by 16 and 27% in the cases of the pyramid and prism-patterned cells, respectively, compared with a flat surface. In the case of the line-patterned cell, because of the dramatic changes in the height of the line patterns on the surface, the AFM tip could not follow the sidewalls of the patterns, and the scanning could not be completed. The increase in the surface ratio of the line patterns was alternatively calculated by analyzing the cross-sectional images obtained by SEM; its surface area was increased by 83%. Fig. 3 shows the representative SEM cross-sectional images of the interface region between the LSM–YSZ composite cathode and the line-patterned electrolyte before and after sintering at 1100 °C. The screen-printed cathode slurries, fully dried at room temperature, completely permeate the bottom edges of each pattern before sintering, exhibiting a conformal contact with the sidewalls. The sintered cathode layers are also effectively bonded to the electrolyte surface with no indication of delamination.

3.2 Electrochemical characterization
To investigate the effect of the increased interface area on the electrochemical performance, a flat reference cell with its electrolyte composed of only the BEL was compared with the patterned cells. The electrochemical measurements were conducted after sufficient current treatments, whereupon the LSM-based cathodes were fully stabilized.32,33 The I–V characteristics and power densities, plotted in Fig. 4(a), show that the peak power density of the reference cell with a single LSM cathode is 512 mW cm−2 at 800 °C. The peak power densities of the pyramid, prism, and line patterned cells with the same single LSM cathode are found to be 576, 642, and 837 mW cm−2, respectively, increasing by 112.5, 125.4, and 163% compared with that of the reference cell. As shown in Fig. S3,† the power densities of patterned cells were linearly proportional to the ratios of the increased surface area. This demonstrates that the interface area between the cathode and the electrolyte plays a significant role in determining the overall performance of cells with an LSM cathode. In addition, we evaluated the performances of the LSM–YSZ composite cathode-loaded cells and observed an improvement in the performance of the patterned cells. The performance of the line-patterned cell, which had the largest interface area in our study, was compared with that of the reference flat cell. As shown in Fig. 4(b), the reference cell exhibits peak power densities of 878.1 and 347.5 W cm−2 at 800 and 700 °C, respectively, and the line-patterned cell exhibits peak power densities of 981.7 and 421.5 W cm−2.

For detailed electrochemical analysis, AC impedances were characterized under cathodic biases. Fig. 5(a) shows the representative electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) of the single cells with a single LSM cathode, measured at 800 °C and 0.8 V. Among the tested cells in this study, the line-patterned cell exhibited the lowest polarization resistance (0.322 Ω cm2), a decrease of 42% from that of the reference cell (0.559 Ω cm2). Fig. 5(b) shows the Bode plots of the patterned cells and flat cell with the single LSM cathode at 0.8 V and 800 °C. The magnitude of the main peak, appearing in the high-frequency range (∼103 Hz), significantly decreases with the increase in the interface area. As the magnitude of the high-frequency peak is related to the rate of surface kinetics for the ORR,34 this decreasing trend suggests that the increased interface area between the cathode and the electrolyte helps increase the number of ORR active sites. Although the ohmic resistances of the patterned cells increased slightly because of the additionally stacked PEL on the BEL, a slight increase in the ohmic resistance of anode-supported cells is not critical to their overall cell performance (note that the ohmic resistance is one order of magnitude lower than the polarization resistance). In the case of the LSM–YSZ composite cathode-loaded cells, the polarization resistances of the line-patterned cell at 0.6 V were measured to be 0.217 and 0.627 Ω cm2, which were only 70% of those of the flat reference cells (0.310 and 0.899 Ω cm2) at 800 and 700 °C, respectively (Fig. 6.). This reveals that interface engineering can effectively enhance the ORR activity of composite cathodes; this was previously believed to be dominated by bulk properties.35

To understand the effects of the increased interface area on elementary reaction processes, the deconvolution of the measured impedance spectra was accomplished by the distribution of relaxation time (DRT) combined with the numerical accuracy of the complex nonlinear least square (CNLS) fit.
The detailed procedures have been previously reported.36–38Table 1 lists the modeling and fitting results for the single LSM-loaded flat reference cell and patterned cells operated at 800 °C. The impedance spectra were fitted with a simple RC series model, in which a parallel combination of a resistor and a capacitor represents each electrochemical process. In this work, the total impedance spectra of the single LSM cathodes were divided into four regions,39 indicating three different cathode processes and a diffusion process at the anode side, as detailed in the ESI, Fig. S4.† As reported in previous research, the three cathode reactions can be attributed to the oxygen anion incorporation process across the interface between the cathode and the electrolyte,40,41 the ORR reactions including O2 dissociative adsorption processes,39,42–44 and the oxygen diffusion in the bulk of the cathode,45 denoted by SC1, SC2, and SC3, respectively. The resistance of SC2, which accounts for most of the total resistance, was significantly reduced compared with that in the reference cell. The resistance of the line-patterned cell, which had the most increased interface area (of more than 80% compared with the flat reference cell), was reduced by half in the case of SC2. As the same anode tape was used, no significant difference in the gas diffusion loss at the anode side, SA1, was observed.

The results can also be confirmed from DRT analysis (Fig. 7). In the DRT plots, four different peaks can be clearly observed in the frequency range of 50 Hz to 10 kHz, corresponding to each process in the equivalent circuit model. As the area under the peak gives the resistance of each process to electrode activity, the largest area under the SC2 peak, which is ascribed to O2 dissociation and reduction processes, is identified as the main rate-determining process in all the cells. The SC2 process of the patterned cells was facilitated by introducing patterns on the interface, with the magnitude of the peaks significantly reduced. This suggests that the performance enhancement can be attributed to the increased TPB sites on the expanded interface area between the cathode and the electrolyte. This can be supported by the fact that the negligible ionic conductivity of the LSM cathode limits the ORR to take place only in the vicinity of the electrolyte surface, where TPBs can be formed.46 Therefore, the electrochemical performance was enhanced in proportion to the increased interface area between the cathode and the electrolyte.
 Fig. 7  Series of DRT plots for the single LSM loaded reference and patterned cells at 800 °C. 
In the case of the composite cathode, the impedance spectra can be divided into five regions. Table 2 and Fig. 8 present the corresponding fitting results and DRT plots, in which CC1, CC2, and CC3 represent three cathode processes, and CA1 and CA2 represent two anode processes.47,48 The resistances of CC2 and CC3, which account for most of the total resistance, are significantly lower than those in the reference cell, leading to improved cathode performance. As CC2 and CC3 correspond to oxygen anion transport across the LSM/YSZ interface and the surface diffusion process of the charged intermediate species,49 respectively, the patterned interface also effectively enhances the ORR of the composite cathode. As the composite cathode has considerable active sites beyond the interface area unlike the single LSM cathode, the remarkable reduction in the resistances reveals that the TPB sites near the interface region participate in the ORR much more actively than those far from the electrolyte and they can be maximized through patterned interfacial structures. The composite LSM–YSZ cathode and single LSM cathode exhibited significantly improved performances, demonstrating that the interface architecture imparted through patterning could effectively enhance the overall reaction rates and lower the activation energy required for the ORR.

4. Conclusions
We demonstrated that the performance of SOFCs can be further improved by introducing a patterned interface between the cathode and the electrolyte. Our advanced patterning method, utilizing soft-lithography with a UV curable electrolyte slurry, was applied to the thin electrolyte layer of anode-supported SOFCs with a variety of shapes of patterns. The surface area of the electrolyte in the patterned cell was significantly increased while minimizing the thickness of the electrolyte layer. The patterned cells showed dramatically enhanced ORR activities and improved overall cell performances. The DRT analysis combined with the CNLS from the impedance spectra showed that the improved ORR activities can be attributed to the increased active sites in the vicinity of the interface. This work paves a new pathway for further performance improvement of not only SOFCs toward reducing operating temperatures but also other electrochemical devices with layered ceramic structures.
