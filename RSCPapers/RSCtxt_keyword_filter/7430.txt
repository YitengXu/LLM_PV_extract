    , Accepted 19th May 2017First published on 22nd May 2017AbstractLead chalcogenide colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are potential candidates for applications effective in the near infrared spectral range. Photoanodes were sensitized with PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe via a simple successive ion layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR) technique. In the present study, ZnSe was used as an alternative to ZnS. ZnSe was deposited on a TiO2/PbS/CdS/CdSe photoanode, which was more efficient in reducing electron recombination in the QDSSCs. The performance of the QDSSCs was scrutinized using a polysulfide electrolyte and a copper sulfide counter electrode. The PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe electrode resulted in enhanced efficiency as compared to the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS-sensitized QDs. Red shifts with PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe were observed, which were attributed to the combined effect of QDs. This was confirmed via photovoltaic studies and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe electrode exhibits a short circuit current density of 17.53 mA cm2 with an enhanced power to conversion efficiency (η) of 4.15% under 1 Sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).
1. Introduction
Solar energy is one of the most abundant renewable energies available; thus, converting it into electricity with good performance via the development of an efficient solar cell is required to meet the imperative societal need for sustainable clean energy with negligible or no detrimental environmental impact.1 Several novel technologies and materials have been proposed to meet the demands of highly efficient solar power conversion, and significant progress has been made.2–5 Initially, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) received significant attention because of their simple fabrication procedure and high efficiency.6,7 Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with a narrow band gap have recently attracted extensive interest as a substitute for DSSCs for use as photosensitizers. Due to their band gap tunability, low production costs, simple fabrication, high absorption coefficient, solution processability, and multiple exciton generation (MEG) potential, inorganic quantum dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) have been extensively explored to substitute the expensive dyes in DSSCs. These features have made them prime candidates for next generation solar cell designs.8–18In situ growth methods, including successive ionic layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR)19 and chemical bath deposition (CBD),20 are the commonly used techniques for directly growing semiconductor QDs on mesoscopic oxide films. Inorganic semiconductor sensitizers are typically used as QD sensitizers, which surpass dye homologues. The semiconductor electrode plays a vital role in collecting photoinjected electrons from the sensitizer and affords good electron transport association between the sensitizer and an external circuit. TiO2 is a wide-band-gap semiconductor to which QDs are attached for visible light absorption.
QDSSCs show remarkable efficiencies and high photocurrent in depleted heterojunctions21 as well as in the Schottky configuration22 with the values up to 7.3% and 5.2%, respectively. QDSSCs still show limited efficiencies because of their charge recombination at the interface of QDs.23,24 Preceding researches show that combinations of QDs lead to higher efficiencies than pure materials.25–29 CdS, CdSe, PbS, PbSe, and Sb2S3 are often used as sensitizers in QDSSCs. Among these, lead sulfide (PbS) QDs have high absorption coefficient with a tunable band gap of 0.41 eV, which can be more beneficial as an effective sensitizer in QDSSCs.30 The quantized discrete band structures, multiple exciton, and theoretical efficiency, which are beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit, are the advantages of the PbS-sensitized QDSSCs.31 However, the performance of the PbS QDSSCs is much inferior to that of other semiconductor QD-based solar cells.32,33 A limited passivation layer of CdS above the PbS-sensitized surface of the photoanode can decrease the recombination of the photoinjected electrons with the electrolyte and enhance the overall performance of the solar cells.31 Moreover, on increasing the number of cycles of the PbS layers to more than two, a drastic decrease in the performance of the QDSSCs with a significant decrease in the open circuit voltage of the cell was observed.30 It helps in exploring and developing the performance of the PbS-based QDSSCs. The combination of CdS/CdSe with PbS leads to better performance as a result of the reorganized band-edge levels.34
Then, the ZnS SILAR coating technique was used to protect the QDs from photocorrosion and suppress the electron recombination with the electrolyte. In SILAR, the growth mechanism involves specific adsorption of the cationic precursor, rinsing of the non-specifically adhered chemicals, chemical reaction between the most strongly specified adsorbed cations and less strongly adsorbed anions by subsequent substrate immersion in the anion solution, and rinsing of the species that did not react. The technique constitutes a SILAR cycle that can be repeated many times by increasing the amount of the deposited material each time. By tuning the relative band alignment layer of the passivized QDs, it can act as the main light absorbing layer and an electron blocking/hole extraction layer.35 ZnS has been generally used as a passivation layer as it has a more negative minimum conduction band edge (Ecb) as compared to Cd/CdSe QDs such that it can prevent the transfer of electrons from QDs and oxide to the electrolyte. However, since the maximum valence band edge of ZnS is more positive than those of the CdS/CdSe/QDs, the usage of ZnS would undesirably retard hole transfer from the QDs to the electrolyte, causing reduced charge separation in QDs.36 To overcome the detrimental impact on the charge separation and injection, an alternate passivation material with an appropriate electronic structure is worth to be explored. Thus, ZnSe is a good choice for a passivation layer in terms of its higher values of Ecb and Evb than those of the CdS/CdSe/QDs. This way of aligning the band not only prevents electrons from getting transferred to the electrolyte but also facilitates the desired hole transport from the QDs to the electrolyte. Soni et al.37 reported a thick ZnSe layer in the CdSe/CdS/ZnSe type II core/intermediate/shell (C/I/S) structures, enacting the electron–hole pair separation. Ahmed et al.38 constructed CdSe/CdS/ZnSe type II core/shell structures in the QDSSCs and demonstrated that the power conversion efficiency increased from 1.86% to 3.99% with the introduction of a ZnSe layer. Zhou et al.39 introduced a thin ZnSe layer between the CdSe QDs and ZnS layer, resulting in significantly increased photocurrent and large enhancement in the solar energy conversion efficiency. It was explained that the introduction of ZnSe could reduce the lattice mismatch between CdSe and ZnS, which in turn suppressed the formation of defects at the CdSe/ZnS interface, thus facilitating the growth of ZnS with enhanced quality and improving the stability of the CdSe QDSSC. Although ZnSe as a passivation layer has a favorable electronic configuration with a number of effects that improve the power conversion efficiency in the QDSSCs, the power conversion efficiency remains lower than 5% at present.37,39,40
In this study, we demonstrated the effects of the ZnSe passivation layer with appropriate coverage and thickness on the photovoltaic performance of the TiO2/PbS/CdS/CdSe QDSSCs in terms of light absorption, charge transport, and charge recombination. It was found that the PCE of a solar cell with two SILAR cycle depositions of a ZnSe passivation layer increased from 3.88 to 4.15% (VOC = 0.54 V, JSC = 17.53 mA cm−2, and FF = 0.57) as compared to that of the solar cells without the ZnSe passivating layer. For comparison, PbS/CdS/CdSe quantum dot-sensitized solar cells with an optimum ZnS passivation layer were also fabricated, which generated a power conversion efficiency of 3.88%, much lower than that of the ZnSe passivated QDSSCs (4.15%). This study demonstrated that ZnSe would be a good alternative to ZnS as a passivation material.
2. Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemicals used were purchased from Aldrich and employed without any further purification. FTO substrate with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω square−1 (Sigma-Aldrich) was used to prepare the photoanodes and CE. TiO2 paste (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP) was supplied by Solaronix.
2.2 Fabrication of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe sensitized on TiO2
With the aim of preparing QDSSCs, a fluorine-doped tin oxide glass (FTO) was used as a substrate for both the photoanode and CE. TiO2 photoanodes were fabricated on an ultrasonically cleaned FTO substrate using the doctor blade method. Anatase TiO2 particles (Ti-Nanoxide HT/SP, Solaronix) were first deposited on the FTO substrate with an active area of 0.27 cm2, followed by sintering at 450 °C for about 30 min. A thickness of ∼7 μm was obtained. The TiO2 photoanodes were immersed in a solution containing 25 mM Pb(NO3)2 for 5 minutes to allow Pb2+ ions to adsorb, and then, it was rinsed with DI water and ethanol to remove excess Pb2+ ions. Photoanodes were then dipped in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M sodium sulfide (Na2S) for 5 minutes, where the pre-adsorbed Pb2+ ions reacted with S2− ions to form PbS. Then, the electrodes were rinsed with DI water and ethanol and dried under N2 gas. These two dipping procedures constituted one cycle, and two cycles were applied. Then, CdS was sensitized for five cycles using an aqueous solution of 0.1 M cadmium acetate dihydrate and 0.1 M Na2S to achieve good adsorption over the PbS/TiO2 photoanode. For the deposition of the CdSe QDs, the CdS/PbS/TiO2-sensitized photoanode was immersed in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M cadmium acetate dihydrate and 0.2 M Na2SeSO3 for about 8 cycles. Then, the QD-deposited photoanodes were washed with DI water and dried in N2 gas.
2.3 ZnS/ZnSe sensitisation on PbS/CdS/CdSe
Finally, two cycles of ZnS passivizing layer coating were performed over the CdSe/CdS/PbS sensitized photoanodes via the SILAR method using an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn (NO3)2 and 0.1 M (Na2S); the photoanodes were dipped in each solution for 5 min per cycle and washed several times, dried, and used for the fabrication of the QDSSCs.
The CdSe/CdS/PbS electrodes were coated with a ZnSe passivation layer using 2 SILAR cycles. The electrodes were alternately dipped in an aqueous solution of 0.1 M Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O for 5 min at 50 °C and a solution of Na2SeSO3 for 5 min at 50 °C for 5 min. They were then rinsed with DI water and dried using a drier.
2.4 Fabrication of the CuS counter electrodes
CBD is a modest and easy method for preparing the metal sulfide CE and FTO substrate. Prior to deposition, the FTO samples were ultrasonically cleaned using acetone, ethanol, and DI water for 10 minutes each. The prepared substrates were dried with N2 gas. A CuS aqueous solution was prepared using 0.1 M CuSO4·5H2O and 0.4 M Na2S2O3 as a source of Cu2+ and S2− ions, respectively. Moreover, 0.4 M CH4N2O was used as a reagent for depositing the CuS thin films. The substrates were then horizontally dipped in the solutions of CuS and kept in a hot air oven at 65 °C for about 2 h. The CuS-coated films were washed several times with DI water and ethanol.
2.5 Assembly of the QDSSCs
The photoelectrodes and the CEs (CuS) were assembled and sealed in layers using a transparent 50 mm hot melt sealing sheet (double sheet of SX 1170-25, Solaronix). The polysulfide electrolyte was injected through a pin-hole made in the CE. The cells were left for a few hours to complete the diffusion of the electrolyte within the photoanode, and the cells were tested under one Sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2).
2.6 Characterizations
The surface morphology of the thin films was characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, SU-70, Hitachi) at the Busan KBSI. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscope (XPS, VG Escalab 250) was equipped with a hemispherical energy analyzer using monochromated Al Kα radiation. QD adsorption was measured by UV-vis spectroscopy (Mecasys OPTIZEN 3220UV) over the wavelength range from 400 to 800 nm. A source meter (Keithley 2400) was used to analyze the I–V characteristics under 1 Sun illumination (100 mW cm−2, AM 1.5). The internal resistance of the QDSSCs at room temperature was measured via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS; Biologic SP-150) at the frequencies ranging from 100 mHz to 500 kHz. The applied bias voltage and AC amplitude were set to the VOC of the QDSSCs and 10 mV, respectively. The electrical impedance was characterized using Nyquist plots.
3. Results and discussion
CdS over a PbS-sensitized surface of the photoanode can reduce recombination and enhance the overall performance of the solar cells. Moreover, on increasing the number of cycles of the PbS layers to more than two, a drastic decrease in the performance of the QDSSCs with a large drop in the open circuit voltage of the cell was observed. The absorption onset of the PbS/CdS-sensitized TiO2 electrodes after a five-cycle SILAR process shifted to a longer wavelength of about 504 nm, and the QDSSC with QDs prepared using 5 SILAR cycles gave the best overall cell performance in terms of its efficiency and fill factor. The introduction of CdSe broadens the light absorption range. After the deposition of CdSe (8 cycles) on TiO2/PbS/CdS (5), the absorption range shifted to the red region (625 nm). For the co-sensitization system, an electrode prepared using 5 cycles of CdS plus 8 cycles of CdSe (TiO2/CdS5/CdSe8) exhibits the best performance.41
A ZnS passivation layer deposited using 1, 2, and 3 SILAR cycles decreases the rate of recombination and assists in electron transport.38
3.1 Surface morphology
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed the surface morphology of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe on TiO2, as shown in Fig. 1. The PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS electrode has a uniformly distributed scale-like nanostructure and thus high surface area on the TiO2 surface (Fig. 1a) with few gaps. PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe features a large number of nanostructures (Fig. 1b), which could improve the photovoltaic performance. When multilayer PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe was deposited, the gaps between nanostructures reduced. The amount of adhesion of the active materials on FTO is a vital factor in determining the efficiency of the QDSSCs. If the materials do not stick to the FTO, they may peel off from the FTO substrate and release into the electrolyte, thus decreasing the efficiency of the QDSSCs.42–46 The efficiency of the QDSSCs is improved by changing the surface morphology of the electrode from compact to porous, as well as by the particle-ornamented surface architecture. The corresponding TEM images are shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†).

XPS was carried out to investigate the composition and chemical bond configuration of the elements present in PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe. XPS confirms the presence of all these elements, and Fig. 2 shows the binding energy peaks for Pb4f, Cd3d, S2p, Se3d, and Zn2p3. The binding energy peaks are at 137.8 eV for Pb4f, 404.73 eV for Cd3d5, 56.6 eV for Se3d, 1022.28 eV for Zn2p3, and 159.32 eV for S2p.

To study the surface roughness of PbS/CdS/CdSeZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe, high-resolution tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) was applied, and the corresponding 2-dimensional (2D) and 3-dimensional (3D) images are shown in Fig. 3. The smoothest film, with a root-mean square (RMS) roughness value of 5.39 nm, was obtained from the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe electrode. The lower surface roughness is mainly due to the large particle sizes of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe as compared to those of the PbS/CdS/CdSeZnS nanostructures. The power conversion efficiency of the PbS/CdS/CdSeZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe solar cells mainly depends on the roughness of the surface, and a reduction of the surface roughness in PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe tends to improve the conversion efficiency of the QDSSCs, which affects the optical properties.47 The decrease in the surface roughness with ZnSe is associated with the filling of pores on the TiO2/PbS/CdS/CdSe surface. It is evident that the thin film modifies the surface morphology and the surface roughness. The result of the AFM studies is consistent with the SEM analysis results. An even and regular morphology is required for acceptable performance in photovoltaic devices.

3.2 Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of each substrate according to the deposited material is shown in Fig. 4. Generally, in the PbS-sensitized solar cells, a lower band gap of bulk PbS (0.41 eV) shows an inability to transfer electrons to the conduction band of the semiconductor photo-anode i.e., the conduction band position of PbS is much lower than that of the semiconductor. However, in the case of PbS, quantum confinement of the conduction band tends to cause an upshift, allowing fast electron transfer into the semiconductor photoanode.33,42–45,48–50 Apart from this, the consecutive CdS passivation layers over PbS can also favour greater stability against the polysulfide electrolyte. The device stability has been found to be more dependent on the interface and band alignment between the QDs and anodes rather than on the bulk QD layer itself. The absorption spectra of the TiO2 films with ZnS and ZnSe passivation layer treatment are shown in Fig. 4. Herein, 2 SILAR cycles were used to deposit the passivation layer on the surface of the QDs. The sensitization of ZnSe on the surface of PbS/CdS/CdSe can slightly enhance the absorption intensity as compared to that of ZnS in the entire visible region. The optical absorption ranges of the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe samples are extended to ∼620 and 650 nm, respectively.45 The higher photovoltaic performance can be attributed to the higher intensity and red shift of light absorption in the range of 400–700 nm and increase in the electron concentration in the TiO2 substrate sensitized by PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe. Especially, the optical absorption is heightened and desirable for solar light harvesting. To better understand the flow of excited electrons, the energy band gap alignment diagram for the combined QDs is shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†).

3.3 Photovoltaic properties
The photovoltaic characteristics of the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe QDSSCs measured under the illumination of one Sun (AM 1.5, 100 mW cm2) were compared, and the results are shown in Fig. 5; the optimised parameters (i.e., JSC, VOC, FF and PCE) are summarized in Table 1. The photovoltaic parameters of the QDSSC fabricated using PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS QDs include a VOC of 0.5 V, JSC of 13.19 mA cm−2, FF of 0.49, and η of 3.88%. The PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe QDs show the best performance, with JSC = 17.53 mA cm−2, VOC = 0.54 V, FF = 0.57, and η = 4.15%. The sensitization of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe results in a systematic improvement of JSC and VOC, which is attributed to the slightly extended light absorption range and augmented absorptivity with the red-shift of the absorption onset of the QD sensitizers. However, it is still necessary to suppress the recombination of the injected electrons at the photoanode/electrolyte interface by different deposition techniques and enhancing the efficiency in QDSSCs.51,52

We found that using PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe, the photovoltaic performance of the QDSSC was improved. The electrode prepared with PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe shows superior photovoltaic performance in the QDSSC. The JSC of the PbS/CBD-CdS/CBD-CdSe QDs is 15.39 mA cm−2, and the power conversion efficiency is 4.15%, which is higher than that of the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS electrode (3.88%). The higher JSC for PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe cells should be ascribed to the broader light harvesting ability and higher electron injection rate. The result shows that use of the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe electrode is an efficient technique, which significantly improves the electron lifetime, leading to improved photovoltaic performance.53,54
3.4 Electrochemical impedance studies
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is a powerful tool for characterizing the performance of each component of QDSCs, and it is used to investigate the interior resistance, recombination, and charge transfer kinetics of the QDSCs. The Nyquist plots of QDSCs with the photoanodes PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe were measured under a simulated light source. The equivalent circuit diagram model is shown in Fig. 6. The series resistance RS is the non-zero intercept on the real axis of the plot that that represents the sheet resistance of the transparent conducting film (TCO) and the resistance of the FTO/TiO2.
 Fig. 6  Equivalent circuit diagram of the QDSSC. 
The electron transfer resistance Rct is associated with electron recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, and it is parallel with the chemical capacitance Cμ. The finite Warburg impedance (ZW) elements are associated with diffusion processes, which are influenced by the behavior of the porous electrode/electrolyte interface and the counter electrode/electrolyte. ZW in the lowest frequency region is because of the Warburg impedance of the redox couple in the electrolyte. The RCE and CCE are related to the counter electrode resistance and capacitance.
The Nyquist plots are shown in Fig. 7. The change in RCE could be attributed to the alteration of the redox polysulfide using similar CuS electrodes. The RCE values of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe were found to be 8.6 and 2.4 Ω, respectively. The low RCE value indicates an increase in the QDSSC efficiency due to the high electron transfer rate at the interface of CE/electrolyte.55 This suggests that the electron injection at the counter-electrode/electrolyte-solution interface was more efficient with PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe, which prevents leakage from the QDs to the polysulfide electrolyte. The electron transfer resistance Rct is related to electron recombination at the photoanode/electrolyte interface, and it is parallel with the chemical capacitance (Cμ). The Rct value of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe (18.2 Ω) is lower than that of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS (28.6 Ω). The low Rct value suggests that the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe configuration provides enhanced electron transport in the photoanode by suppressing the recombination. Moreover, high chemical capacitance of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe QDSSC is due to the collection of a large number of photoexited electrons into the conduction band of the photoanode due to low recombination (Table 2).

The ZW value (5.7 Ω) of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe indicates better electrolyte diffusion, facilitates faster mass transport of the electrons, and improves the performance of the QDSSC. Low ZW value denotes better electrolyte diffusion, facilitates faster mass transport of electron, and increases the performance of the QDSSC by increasing the JSC. The higher ZW value (10.6 Ω) is because of the thicker porous PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS materials which increases the diffusion length and confirms the inability of the electrode with a polysulfide electrolyte and tends to a drastic loss of FF and affects the overall performance of cell. The capacity to accrue electrons mainly depends on the conduction band position, as shown in eqn (1):56,57 (1)

Fig. 8 shows the photovoltage decay plots and the electron lifetimes as a function of photovoltage. It was observed that the photovoltage of the photoelectrodes PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe decays more slowly than that of the photoelectrodes PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe. The decreased electron lifetime of the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS electrodes indicates higher charge recombination rate and lower charge collection efficiency than those of the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe electrodes. These results demonstrate that the improvement of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe in QDSSCs is attributed to both the enhanced light absorption and the reduced charge recombination.

4. Conclusion
The results show that cascade structures of PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS and PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe can be used as photoanodes to improve the performance of the QDSSCs. However, the efficiency of a PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe-sensitized solar cell is strongly dependent on the passivation layer type. The device with PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnS generated an efficiency (η) of 3.8%, whereas that with PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe generated an efficiency of 4.15%. The overall power conversion efficiency increases after the introduction of the passivation layer. As a result, the QDSSC based on the PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe photoanode achieved an efficiency of 4.15% and a JSC of 17.53 mA cm−2. The investigation of the charge transport in the photoanode by transient photovoltage decay confirmed that the effective electron lifetime was improved with ZnSe coating as compared to that of the cell with ZnS coatings. The large accumulations of the photoinjected carriers in the conduction band of the photoanode and lower recombination of photogenerated electrons with the electrolyte in PbS/CdS/CdSe/ZnSe were confirmed via impedance analysis. The enhancement in the photoelectrochemical enactment with quantum-dot sensitization of TiO2 is another breakthrough for achieving higher photoconversion efficiencies.
