    , Accepted 14th November 2018First published on 20th November 2018AbstractA direct band gap of 1.6 eV has been identified in wurtzite CoO thin films, which matches the required value to achieve a theoretically high conversion efficiency solar cell. Its p-type conduction has been determined and an intense sub-gap absorption between 0.7 and 1.1 eV has been observed.
Transition metal oxides (TMOs) have attracted intensive studies during the last two decades, as they possess rich phase structures, many interesting properties and various emerging applications. Most of the work focused on the wide band gap TMOs, as they exhibit unique advantages on the applications of transparent thin film transistor and transparent electrodes.1–3 Less attention has been paid to the narrow band gap (Eg < 2 eV) TMOs, even though narrow band gap semiconductors with 1 eV < Eg < 2 eV are highly attractive for photovoltaic absorbers. This is mainly due to the already abundant existence of narrow band gap semiconductors, like Si, III–V pnictides and II–VI chalcogenides,4 and some of them (e.g., Si and Cu(InGa)Se2) are used in commercial photovoltaics. However, such kinds of narrow band gap semiconductors are still suffering from notorious defect intolerances and complex fabrication processes, which are definitely unfavorable to the cost reduction of photovoltaics. In contrast, TMOs usually exhibit the characteristics of a high defect tolerance and easy fabrication. Additionally, a direct band gap in a photovoltaic absorber is also desirable, as it enables a highly efficient absorption of photons. Thus, TMOs with a direct and narrow band gap are full of interest for photovoltaics.
Most of the TMOs crystallize in the cubic structure, and so far there are only a few exceptions (e.g., ZnO and CoO) with wurtzite-type hexagonal structure. Direct and wide band gap (>3 eV) characters have been identified in ZnO.5 Although metastable wurtzite CoO was discovered by M. J. Redman and E. G. Steward in 1962,6 the properties of this phase are scarcely reported. This is mainly due to the challenge of single phase wurtzite CoO synthesis in bulk or thin film forms with a dense microstructure. The first preparation of wurtzite CoO powder was by decomposing Co acetate in a nitrogen atmosphere and contained approximately four percent each of cobalt metal and carbon as impurity phases,6 which hinders the precise determination of the electrical properties. Unfortunately, the recently successful synthesis of wurtzite CoO nanocrystals or nanoparticles were insufficiently dense to investigate the electrical and optical properties.7,8
In this work, wurtzite CoO thin films have been successfully grown on glass substrates by reactive sputtering at room temperature. The optical and electrical properties of these metastable thin films have been investigated. The electronic structure has been studied by first-principles calculations.
Cobalt oxide thin films were deposited on glass (microscopy slides) substrates by reactive pulsed-DC magnetron sputtering in Ar–O2 atmospheres. A pulsed-DC power supply (Pinnacle+ Advanced Energy) was used to sputter the metallic cobalt target (50 mm diameter and 1 mm thick with a purity of 99.99%). The current applied to the target was fixed to 0.12 A, and the frequency and the off-time were 50 kHz and 4 μs, respectively. The argon flow rate was fixed at 25 sccm, while the oxygen flow rate varied in the 1–7 sccm range with a step of 0.5 sccm. The accuracy of the gas flow controller (Air Liquide) was ±0.1 sccm in this work. The distance between the substrate and the target was fixed at 60 mm. No intentional heating was applied to the substrates, and the deposition temperature was close to room temperature. It is worth noting here that the oxygen process window in which to attain single phase wurtzite CoO thin films is very narrow (2–2.5 sccm). Larger oxygen flow rates (≥3 sccm) yield spinel Co3O4 thin films, while smaller ones (<2 sccm) produce rocksalt CoO thin films. X-ray diffraction (XRD, Brucker D8 Advance with CuKα1 radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm) in a Bragg Brentano configuration) was employed to identify the phase structures. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7001F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL ARM 200-Cold FEG) were used to check the morphology and microstructure, respectively. For the purpose of TEM, the specimens of cobalt oxide thin films were prepared by diamond tip cleave. The optical absorption coefficient at room temperature was determined from transmission (T) and reflectance (R) spectra measured by an ultraviolet-visible near infrared (UV-Vis-NIR) spectrophotometer (Varian Cary 5000). Resistivity measurements were performed at room temperature using the four-point probe method (Jeandel apparatus equipped with a Keithley 2700 for the voltage measurements).
The electronic structure calculations were performed by the Vienna ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) with projector-augmented-wave (PAW) pseudopotentials.9,10 The plane-wave cut off was set to 600 eV and the Brillouin was sampled with a 13 × 13 × 9 Monkhorst–Pack grid. Exchange and correlation were treated with the Hubbard-U correction (LDA+U). We used the parameters U = 6.92 eV and J = 0.92 eV, generally accepted for rocksalt CoO.11,12 The lowest energy antiferromagnetic configuration AF3 for the ground state was employed.13 Lattice constants and ionic positions were optimized using the conjugate gradient method,14 until the energy and force convergence are smaller than 10−5 eV and 10−3 eV Å−1, respectively.

Fig. 1(a) shows the X-ray diffractogram of a 2200 nm thick cobalt oxide film deposited on a glass substrate using 2 sccm for the oxygen flow rate. As seen in Fig. 1(a), such thin film is well indexed to the wurtzite-type hexagonal structure [JCPDS 04-002-2693] with the lattice constants of a = 0.323 nm and c = 0.519 nm. The top-view SEM image of wurtzite CoO thin film exhibits a dense microstructure, as shown in Fig. 1(b). In addition, the cross-section SEM image shows a densely columnar growth along the thickness direction (see Fig. S1, ESI†). Such a columnar microstructure was also confirmed by TEM bright field image, as seen in Fig. 1(c). The electron diffraction pattern is present in Fig. 1(d), which can only be well indexed by the hexagonal structure. These results demonstrate the successful growth of wurtzite CoO thin films with a dense microstructure.

The optical transmittance (T) and reflectance (R) spectra of the wurtzite CoO thin films have been measured (see Fig. S2, ESI†). Then, the optical absorption coefficient (α) of the wurtzite CoO thin film was calculated by the formula α = −ln(T/(1 − R)2)/d (where d is the thickness), as shown in Fig. 2(a). Since the band gap nature (direct vs. indirect) of wurtzite CoO is unknown, Tauc plots can hardly be employed to determine the optical band gap (Eg) directly. Therefore, the inflection point of the absorption coefficient was used, which has been verified to be an effective approach to identify the Eg.15 The inflection point in the photon energy range of 1.2–1.8 eV gives the Eg to be approximately 1.6 eV. Referring to the Shockley–Queisser limit,16,17 such an Eg value demonstrates that the maximum theoretical efficiency of a single junction solar cell based on wurtzite CoO is as high as 30%, close to that of CuInSe2 (see Fig. 2(b)). Moreover, a significant sub-gap absorption as strong as 15000 cm−1 is clearly observed between 0.7 and 1.1 eV in the wurtzite CoO thin film (see Fig. 2(a)), which can also be used to enhance the solar cell efficiency. This implies that a much wider energy range of photons, including photon energies of both E > 1.6 eV and 0.7 eV < E < 1.1 eV, could be utilized, and the maximum theoretical conversion efficiency may be higher than the Shockley–Queisser limit of 30%. To the best of our knowledge, such an intense sub-gap absorption is evidenced for the first time in wurtzite CoO.

The electronic structure of wurtzite CoO has been calculated by first-principles calculations. The computed crystal constants (a = 0.319 nm and c = 0.510 nm) are very consistent with the experimental ones mentioned above. Fig. 3(a) shows the electronic band dispersion of wurtzite CoO for AF3 ground state, demonstrating a direct band gap of 1.7 eV between the valence band maximum (VBM) and conduction band minimum (CBM) at Γ points at low temperature. This band gap value is in good accordance with the experimental one of 1.6 eV at room temperature. Since the direct band feature is now known, Tauc fitting of (αE)2vs. E has been performed to determine the band gap from the experimental absorption coefficient (see Fig. S2, ESI†). This approach gives a direct optical band gap of about 1.64 eV, agreeing well with that attained from the inflection point approach. The total density of states (DOS) of wurtzite CoO, as well as the Co-d and O-p partial DOS (PDOS), are shown in Fig. 3(b). Other PDOS (like Co-s and Co-p) are much less intensive than those in this energy range (see Fig. S3, ESI†). Surprisingly, it is seen that the valence band maximum (VBM) of wurtzite CoO is mainly composed of Co-d orbitals. In general, most oxides of the main group elements possess a predominant O-p character at the VBM and the holes introduced in the valence band are highly localized.18 Consequently, it is intrinsically a difficult task to achieve p-type conduction in these oxides. An exception is the oxides contained monovalent Cu+ (like Cu2O and delafossite CuAlO2), where Cu-d orbitals dominate the VBM and modulate the contribution of O-p.15,19,20 Such features in Cu+-based oxides facilitate the better hole conduction. Here, the significant Co-d states at VBM of wurtzite CoO indicate that this material may be another exception suitable for the hole conduction.

The electrical properties of wurtzite CoO thin films have been investigated. The room temperature resistivity and Seebeck coefficient of a wurtzite CoO thin film without intentional doping are 50700 ± 8100 Ω cm and + 280 ± 30 μV K−1, respectively. These results indicate that wurtzite CoO is an intrinsic p-type semiconductor. In addition, the hole concentration of the wurtzite CoO thin film determined by AC Hall effect is in the order of 1015 cm−3, much lower than that of rocksalt CoO and spinel Co3O4 thin films. Such unusual electrical properties of wurtzite CoO differ with the metastable Cu4O3, which possesses a much larger hole concentration than the stable Cu2O phase.21,22
Subsequently, the physical origin of intense sub-gap absorption between 0.7 and 1.1 eV in wurtzite CoO thin films, was also investigated in a side-by-side comparison of the absorption spectra among wurtzite CoO, rocksalt CoO and spinel Co3O4 thin films. X-ray diffractograms of rocksalt CoO and spinel Co3O4 thin films confirm their single phases (see Fig. S4, ESI†). These two phases also exhibit dense microstructure and columnar growth, similar to those of the wurtzite CoO thin film (see Fig. S5, ESI†). The α of the rocksalt CoO thin film does not exhibit a clear sub-gap absorption between 0.7 and 1.1 eV, whereas, a significant sub-gap absorption as high as 25000 cm−1 in the energy range of approximately 0.7–1.1 eV was clearly observed in the spinel Co3O4 thin film (see Fig. S6, ESI†). The co-existence of a remarkable sub-gap absorption at almost the same energy range between wurtzite CoO and spinel Co3O4 may indicate their similar physical origins. In spinel Co3O4, metal-to-metal-charge-transfer (MMCT) transitions between Co2+ and Co3+, and internal d–d excitations of tetrahedral Co2+ have been proposed as the possible sources for the sub-gap absorption in the energy range of 0.7–1.1 eV.23–25 As there is only one type of cation in wurtzite CoO, the MMCT transitions can probably be ruled out for the sub-gap absorption in wurtzite CoO. By coincidence, wurtzite CoO also exhibits a typical tetrahedral Co2+ character with Co2+–O2− bond distances of 0.1973 and 0.1988 nm [JCPDS 04-002-2693], as close to that in spinel Co3O4 with a Co2+–O2− bond distance of 0.1984 nm [JCPDS 04-008-2376]. Thus, the intense sub-gap absorptions in wurtzite CoO probably come from d–d excitations of the tetrahedral Co2+.
Finally, oxide heterojunction solar cells composed of wurtzite CoO and ZnO thin films, with the architecture shown in the inset of Fig. 4, have been fabricated and characterized. The J–V curve of this heterojunction solar cell under standard AM 1.5G illumination is depicted in Fig. 4, which gives an open circuit voltage (VOC) of 6.38 mV and a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 2.44 mA cm−2, as well as the fill factor (FF) of 0.27. The origin of such a poor performance remains unclear. Here, it is worth noting that both the CoO and ZnO layers are deposited at room temperature, which may yield the poor electrical properties. In addition, their energy level alignments have not been deeply studied. Future investigates focused on the optimized growth of wurtzite CoO thin films and the search of other electron selective contact layers are required.

In conclusions, metastable CoO thin films with a wurtzite-type hexagonal structure have been grown on glass substrates by reactive DC-magnetron sputtering at room temperature. Microstructure analyses demonstrate the dense thin films with columnar growth. The optical band gap is estimated to be 1.6 eV from the optical absorption spectrum, while the electronic structure by first-principles calculations shows a direct band gap characteristic. High resistivity and p-type conduction have been determined in wurtzite CoO thin films without intentional doping. Moreover, a significant sub-gap absorption was observed in wurtzite CoO thin films at the energy range of 0.7–1.1 eV, probably due to the d–d excitations of tetrahedral Co2+. These properties, like the narrow band gap with a direct transition, intrinsic p-type conduction and strong sub-gap absorption from excitations, render this wurtzite CoO an interesting material for oxide-based thin film solar cells.
