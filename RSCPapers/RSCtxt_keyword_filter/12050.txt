The evolution of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 nanostructures as a function of the synthesis time has been identified by scanning electron microscopy. The growth mechanism is proposed and the desired CoSe2/CoSeO3 hierarchical UL structure is noticed at 4 h. CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL consists of nanoparticles and hexagonal prisms for providing a high surface area for catalytic reactions and a one dimensional charge transport route, respectively. The results show that DSSCs using the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE exhibit a higher power conversion efficiency (η) of 9.29 ± 0.24% than that of the cell using a Pt CE (8.33 ± 0.07%). Under various dim light conditions (i.e., a T5 lamp), the DSSC with the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE shows outstanding η's of 19.88 ± 0.10%, 18.24 ± 0.06%, and 16.00 ± 0.13% at 7000 lux (2.21 mW cm−2), 6000 lux (1.89 mW cm−2) and 4800 lux (1.55 mW cm−2), respectively. This study demonstrates that CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL has great potential to replace Pt in DSSCs, and the application of DSSCs can be extended from outdoor to indoor conditions.
1. Introduction
Cobalt selenide (CoSe), one of the Pt-free electro-catalytic materials, catches the attention of researchers due to its outstanding electro-catalytic ability and relatively high content on Earth.1–5Table 1 shows a partial list of literature studies on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) with CoSe-based counter electrodes (CEs) which offered better power conversion efficiency (η) than the Pt CE. It can be found that CoSe analogues possess excellent electro-catalytic ability and the structure of the CoSe electro-catalyst plays an important role in determining the performance of a DSSC.

This study




Various kinds of CoSe structures are synthesized to enhance its electro-catalytic ability. These include nanoparticles,3,5–9 nanorods,4,5,10 petal-like structures,11,12 graphene-like structures,1 honeycomb-like structures,2 nanosheets,13,14 nanocubes,5,15 nanotubes,16 nanowires17 and nanoclimbing walls.18 However, most of them have a single structure, in other words, they only take advantage of one single structure. A hierarchical structure is defined such that it consists of the nanostructure with mixed dimensional subunits, e.g. zero dimensional (0D, such as nanoparticles), one dimensional (1D, such as nanowires or nanotubes), or two dimensional (2D, such as nanosheets).19–22 It combines different dimensional structures, so as to benefit electron transfer, offer directional electron pathways, enhance electrolyte penetration, provide more reaction areas, and avoid random particle aggregation.23–26 To obtain the hierarchical structure, various synthesis methods have been explored, including hydrothermal synthesis, template synthesis, electrochemical deposition, chemical vapor deposition, and atomic layer deposition.20–22,27–29 Lan et al. obtained the hierarchical structure of urchin-like CoSe2via a facile hydrothermal process30 for water splitting. Urchin-like CoSe2 gives a large surface area providing many channels for gaseous product release and promotes electrolyte diffusion. Urchin-like CoSe2 offers 325 and 167 mV overpotentials at 10 mA cm−2 current density in the OER and HER, respectively. Sun et al. obtained cobalt selenide nanotube arrays through a two-step hydrothermal route31 for supercapacitors. The obtained structure can reduce the internal resistance, favour electrolyte diffusion, increase the electroactive surface area, and improve electron and ion transport. The supercapacitor with Co0.85Se nanotube arrays shows a high specific capacitance of 1394 F g−1 at 4 A g−1. Jin et al. synthesized a hollow nanorod array (NRA) of Co0.85Se through a hydrothermal method17 for DSSCs. The NRA of Co0.85Se provides rapid electron transport along the NRA, fast electrolyte diffusion through the open channels within the NRA film, and more active sites. The NRA of Co0.85Se CE achieves an η of 8.35%, which is better than that of the Pt CE (7.75%).
In this study, we synthesize a CoSe2/CoSeO3 electro-catalyst with an urchin-like structure (denoted as CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL), which has a nanoparticle-assembled core having many extended hexagonal prisms. Scheme 1 shows the proposed growth mechanism of CoSe2/CoSeO3 with different reaction times of 1, 2, 4, and 6 h using the hydrothermal method. For the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL electro-catalyst, the nanoparticle-assembled core may work as the electron hub and offer a large active surface area, while the extended hexagonal prisms would provide 1D electron transfer pathways vertically aligned on the substrate (Scheme 2). For comparison, another CoSe2/CoSeO3 electro-catalyst with a simple spherical nanoparticle structure was prepared (denoted as CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP). The electrochemical and photovoltaic performance of the newly synthesized CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL electro-catalyst as the counter electrode was systematically investigated.

2. Experimental
2.1. Synthesis of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystals
Solution A contained 0.348 g Na2SeO3 and 30 ml deionized water. Na2SeO3 was ionized to Na+ and SeO32− so as to provide the Se source for CoSe2/CoSeO3. Solution B consisted of 0.294 g Co(NO3)2·6H2O, 0.187 g triethanolamine (TEA, 99%) and 10 ml deionized water. Co(NO3)2·6H2O was ionized to Co2+ and NO3− so as to provide the Co source for CoSe2/CoSeO3. TEA was used to chelate with Co2+ ions in order to decrease the reaction rate. First, solution A was mixed with solution B in a beaker to form a dark violet solution. For the synthesis of CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, the dark violet solution (4 g) was further mixed with cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) (20 g) and toluene (16 g) in a Teflon® vessel for the hydrothermal process. The weight of each reactant (the aqueous solution, CTAB, and toluene) was calculated based on the phase diagram, which provides guidance for the microemulsion synthesis of CoSe2/CoSeO3 composite crystals (Fig. S1†).5 For the synthesis of CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP, only the dark violet solution (40 g) was added to a Teflon® vessel for the hydrothermal process. The hydrothermal synthesis was performed at 180 °C for 1, 2, 4, and 6 h followed by cooling to room temperature. Thereafter, the product was collected by centrifugation at 65000 rpm for 15 min. The collected solid was washed 10 times using a mixture of ethanol and deionized water.
2.2. Fabrication of the counter electrodes
The standard Pt CE was prepared by direct current (DC) sputtering on a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate (FTO, TEC-7, 7 Ω sq.−1, NSG America, Inc., New Jersey, USA). The as-synthesized CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP slurries were individually deposited on FTO substrates by the drop-coating method, where the slurry consisted of 20 mg powder and 1 ml EtOH. Thereafter, they were calcined at 450 °C for 30 min under N2, and the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CEs were thus obtained.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Morphology

Fig. 1a–d show the morphological features of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystals synthesized in the presence of the CTAB ligand at different reaction times (1, 2, 4, and 6 h); all the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystals exhibit good uniformity and are well-distributed on the FTO substrate (see the images taken at lower magnification). At 1 h, the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystals show an irregular nanosilk structure, having a length of about 500 nm and a diameter about 30–50 nm (Fig. 1a). At 2 h, the CoSe2/CoSeO3 nanosilk structure grows longer and thicker to form a nanorod structure with a length of 600–1000 nm and a diameter about 150 nm (Fig. 1b). At 4 h, the CoSe2/CoSeO3 nanorods further grow into large hexagonal prisms, which had about 1–3 μm length and about 100–500 nm diameter (Fig. 1c). These hexagonal prisms self-assemble into a hierarchical urchin-like structure, where a nanoparticle-composed sphere is the central core with a diameter of about 50 nm surrounded by several hexagonal prisms; we thereby denoted this structure as CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL. At 6 h, both the CoSe2/CoSeO3 hexagonal prisms (about 2–5 μm in length and about 400–600 nm in diameter) and nanoparticles (about 100 nm in diameter) grew bigger and bigger (Fig. 1d) until the micelle collapsed. The CoSe2/CoSeO3 prisms and nanoparticles were found to stack randomly. For comparison, the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystals synthesized without the presence of the CTAB ligand at 4 h exhibited a nanoparticle structure with about 50 nm diameter (denoted as CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP) and were well-distributed on the substrate (Fig. 1e).

3.2. Crystal growth mechanism
This hierarchical urchin-like structure of cobalt selenide/oxide analogues was obtained in this study via a simple one-step hydrothermal method in the presence of the CTAB ligand. In this regard, the crystal growth mechanism of urchin-like CoSe2/CoSeO3 can be divided into four stages (Scheme 1). Initially (stage I), the chelation between Co2+ cation and triethanolamine (TEA) was carried out in the aqueous phase (Scheme 1). After mixing with the Na2SeO3 aqueous precursor, the minor aqueous phase solution was injected into the major toluene phase containing a high concentration of CTAB. At stage II, the formation of micelles was established, where the droplet of the aqueous precursor was surrounded by the CTAB surfactant molecules. The long alkyl chain (1-hexadecyl) of CTAB intends to distribute in the major toluene phase, while the N atom of CTAB exhibits good hydrophilicity to cap the minor aqueous droplet (Scheme 1). At stage III, the CTA cation on the inside surface of a micelle will attract the SeO32− anion via electrostatic interaction. After that, the nucleation of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystal proceeds at the site of the SeO32−–CTA+ complex via reacting with the Co2+–TEA complex. At stage IV, the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystal grew from the inside surface of a micelle to the center. Due to the presence of the TEA ligand, the crystal growth direction is tremendously restricted by the steric hindrance of TEA. At different reaction times, the crystal grew into different structures as follows. At 1 h, the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystal grew into an irregular nanosilk structure, which showed a clear 1D structure. At 2 h, the nanosilk CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystal grew thicker and longer to the nanorod structure. At 4 h, the CoSe2/CoSeO3 nanorod kept growing thicker and longer to the hexagonal prism structure, where the ends of several hexagonal prisms were merged together at the center of the micelle due to the size limitation of the micelle. Besides, the formation of CoSe2/CoSeO3 spherical nanoparticles, self-assembling at the merged center of these hexagonal prisms, is due to the presence of TEA and a small amount of remaining Co2+ ions.32–34 Thus, a hierarchical urchin-like structure of CoSe2/CoSeO3 was obtained. When the reaction time went up to 6 h, the crystal overgrowth of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 hexagonal prism caused the collapse of the urchin-like structure, presumably due to the broken micelle.
In our previous study, the CoSe2/CoSeO3 crystal having a single 1D structure (i.e., nanosilk or nanorod) was synthesized. For I3− reduction, however, it was concluded that the electro-catalytic ability of 1D CoSe2/CoSeO3 is worse than that of the spherical CoSe2/CoSeO3 nanoparticle due to the lack of sufficient active surface area.5 In the presence of the CTAB surfactant, fortunately, the hierarchical urchin-like structure of CoSe2/CoSeO3 proposed in this study could provide a combination of 1D hexagonal prisms and a 0D-nanoparticle-composed sphere. Regarding the urchin-like structure of CoSe2/CoSeO3, the 1D hexagonal prism is known to facilitate electron transfer, and the 0D-nanoparticle-composed center would act as the electron hub and offer a large active surface area simultaneously (Scheme 2). In this way, both fast electron transfer and large surface area could be achieved. In short, the crystal growth mechanism of urchin-like CoSe2/CoSeO3 went through the chelation of the Co2+–TEA complex → the formation of micelles → the chelation of the SeO32−–CTAB complex → nucleation → crystal growth. Therefore, we chose CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL for further investigations.
3.3. X-ray diffraction patterns and X-ray photoelectron spectra
CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), as shown in Fig. 2a. The XRD peak identification of the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS, card CoSe2 no. 65-3327 and CoSeO3 no. 47-903) indicates that both crystals exhibit characteristic peaks of cubic CoSe2 and monoclinic CoSeO3. Furthermore, the bonding characteristics of CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), as shown in Fig. 2b and c. The Co 2P3/2 orbitals illustrate two peaks in Fig. 2b: (1) one peak at 780.9 eV, corresponding to the Co–O bond of CoO and (2) another peak at 778.3 eV, corresponding to the Co–Se bond of CoSe2. For the Se 3d5/2 spectra (Fig. 2c), there are five peaks: (1) three peaks at 59.8 eV, 59.1 eV, and 58.5 eV, corresponding to the Se–O bond of CoSeO3, (2) one peak at 55.1 eV, corresponding to the Se–Se bond of CoSe2, and (3) one peak at 54.6 eV, corresponding to the Co–Se bond of CoSe2. The XPS spectra of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 composite crystal agree well with the XRD patterns of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 composite crystal. Cobalt chalcogenides (e.g., CoS, CoSe2, CoSe0.85, CoTe, etc.) were reported to possess partially filled eg orbitals, which would provide an excellent electro-catalytic performance; thus, the as-synthesized CoSe2/CoSeO3 composite crystal is expected to be a good electro-catalyst for the redox reaction in DSSCs.4,35–37

3.4. Photovoltaic performance
The performance of DSSCs with CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL-based CEs is optimized by varying the loading of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 composite material (CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL-0.6, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL-1.0, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL-1.4, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL-1.8, meaning that their loading weights are 0.6 mg, 1.0 mg, 1.4 mg, and 1.8 mg, respectively); the photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves and their corresponding photovoltaic parameters are shown in Fig. S2 and Table S1,† respectively. It is clear that the cell with the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL-1.4 CE shows the best power-conversion efficiency (η) of 9.29 ± 0.24% with a VOC of 0.82 ± 0.01 V, a JSC of 16.09 ± 0.25 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.70 ± 0.00. The CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL-1.4 CE was thus chosen to compare with the CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CE and Pt CE, and it is called CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL in short in the following discussion. The J–V curves and the corresponding photovoltaic parameters of the DSSCs with Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CEs are shown in Fig. 3a and Table 2, respectively. The DSSC with the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE exhibits the best performance among the three cells; this presumably is due to the urchin-like structure possessing the hexagonal prism structure and nanoparticles to provide both rapid electron transport routes and a reasonably high surface area for electro-catalytic reactions (i.e., the reduction reaction of I3− ions). Fig. 3b shows its incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra in the wavelength range of 400–800 nm under short-circuit conditions. The IPCE values were calculated viaeqn (1), where λ is the wavelength, JSC (λ) is the specific short-circuit photocurrent density obtained at a specific wavelength, and φ is the incident radiation flux. (1)

The short-circuit current density value of a DSSC can also be obtained from its IPCE spectra (denoted as JSC-IPCE), by integrating the area under the IPCE curve. The JSC-IPCE values of the DSSCs with Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CEs are 12.42, 14.69, and 13.99 mA cm−2, respectively. The trend of the JSC-IPCE values is consistent with that of JSC values obtained from the J–V curves. In fact, the JSC-IPCE values of the DSSCs with Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CEs only reach 84, 91, and 90%, respectively, as compared to the JSC values. The reason is that the IPCE measurement does not include the ultraviolet (UV, 300–400 nm wavelength) light spectral region since the monochromator restricts the operating wavelength from 400 to 800 nm. According to the literature, the contribution of JSC-IPCE from 300 to 400 nm accounts for about 10% of the JSC, which explains the discrepancy between our JSC and JSC-IPCE.4,17,38,39
3.5. Cyclic voltammetry
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurement is used to study the electro-catalytic ability of CEs by evaluating the cathodic peak current density (JPC; i.e., the current density minus the background current density) and the peak separation (ΔEP; i.e., the potential difference between the oxidation and reduction peaks) values. The value of JPC represents the rate of the electrochemical reduction reaction (I3− to I−); in other words, the electro-catalytic ability can be quantified by the value of JPC. The value of ΔEP indicates the required potential to drive the redox reaction and this varies inversely with the intrinsic heterogeneous charge-transfer rate constant (ko).40 The CV curves of Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP electrodes are shown in Fig. 4. The JPC values for Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP electrodes are 1.10, 1.90, and 1.51 mA cm−2, respectively, as included in Table 3. Obviously, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL shows the best JPC value among the three electrodes.

On the other hand, the ΔEP values for Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP electrodes are 0.46, 0.33, and 0.43 V, respectively; CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL has the smallest ΔEP value. These results demonstrate that the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE not only has superior electro-catalytic ability but also requires a lower potential to drive the redox reaction. The stability of the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE is tested using a three-electrode system, which consists of the working electrode (the target electrode), counter electrode (Pt electrode), and reference electrode (Ag/Ag+ electrode). To avoid electrolyte evaporation, the system is wrapped with Parafilm® M film. The CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE shows convincing stability up to 1000 CV cycles. At the end of 1000 cycles, the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE still maintains 79.6% of its initial electro-catalytic ability (Fig. S3†) and the tendency of decay is almost linear. It is generally accepted that the stability data under iodine poisoning conditions would decline dramatically with the cycle number. This implies that the cause of the instability in this study is not iodine poisoning. In fact, we have observed that the volume of the electrolyte decreased over time, leading to the decline of the electrode area in contact with the electrolyte. This confirms that the stability drop is due to the evaporation of the solvent ACN. Furthermore, the electro-catalytic surface area is investigated through the measurement of the electrochemical double-layer capacitance (Cd), which has a positive correlation with the reaction surface area. The value of Cd is obtained from the background current by varying the scan rate of CV measurement. The relationship is shown below as eqn (2)41,42 i = ic + ip = ACdν + βν0.5 = αν + βν0.5(2)where A is the projected area of the catalytic film (1 cm2), Cd is the electrochemical double-layer capacitance, ic is the charging current density or the background current density at the reduction potential (Ec) of I−/I3−, ip is the peak current minus the background current density at the reduction potential (Ec) of I−/I3−, α is the coefficient of ν, β is the coefficient of ν0.5, and ν is the scan rate of the CV measurement. The result is shown in Fig. S4.† From the value of α, it is found that the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP, and Pt CEs possess Cd values of 2.61, 4.15, and 1.27 mF cm−2, respectively. The reaction surface area of the CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CE is larger than that of CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL and Pt CEs. However, in the CV measurement, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL shows better electro-catalytic ability than CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP. This indicates that the reaction surface area is not the only factor in determining the electro-catalytic ability of the CoSe2/CoSeO3 composite CEs. In fact, the directional electron transport route would greatly promote electron transport to the active site for facilitating the electro-catalytic reaction. Actually, in the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, it can be said that the nanoparticles afford the high reaction area and the vertically aligned 1D hexagonal prisms provide rapid electron transport. Accordingly, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL shows an excellent electro-catalytic ability and possesses high potential to replace Pt.
3.6. Electrochemical impedance spectra and Tafel polarization curves
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is used to measure the ohmic series resistance (RS) and the charge-transfer resistance (Rct-EIS) of the electro-catalytic electrode. The onset point of the first semicircle in the high-frequency region is the ohmic series resistance (RS), which represents the resistance between the substrate and catalytic layer. The radius of the first semicircle in the middle-frequency region is the charge-transfer resistance (Rct-EIS), which means the charge transfer resistance at the interface of electro-catalytic electrode/electrolyte. Fig. 5a shows the Nyquist plots of the symmetric cell with two identical electrodes (i.e., Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, or CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP); the related parameters are shown in Table 3. The result reveals that the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL electrode possesses the smallest Rct-EIS among the three samples. The Rct-EIS values of Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP electrodes are 2.02, 0.99, and 1.88 Ω cm2, respectively, which means that CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL has the smallest charge transfer resistance for the electro-catalytic reaction.

Tafel polarization curves are also used to study the charge transfer properties, including the charge transfer resistance (Rct-Tafel), and the exchange current density (J0). Generally, a Tafel curve is simply divided into three zones: (1) the polarization zone is at |V| < 120 mV, represented by a sharp slope of the Tafel curve, (2) the Tafel zone is at 120 mV < |V| < 400 mV, showing a slightly slanting slope of the Tafel curve, and (3) the diffusion zone is at |V| > 400 mV, showing a flatter part of the Tafel curve. In the Tafel zone, the exchange current density (J0) of an electro-catalytic film can be obtained by extrapolating the anodic and cathodic curves and reading the cross point at 0 V. The J0 value of an electro-catalytic film can be used to calculate the charge transfer resistance (Rct-Tafel) corresponding to the film/electrolyte interface, viaeqn (3) (3)where R is the ideal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, n is the number of electrons transferred for I3− reduction, and F is the Faraday constant. Herein, the Tafel polarization curves of Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP electrodes are shown in Fig. 5b, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 3. The values of J0 for the Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CEs are 4.99, 9.71, and 5.25, respectively. The Rct-Tafel values of the Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CEs are 2.57, 1.32, and 2.45 Ω cm2, respectively. These results show that the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE has the best electro-catalytic ability among Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CEs.
3.7. Dim light
To further explore the application of the DSSC using the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE under dim light conditions, a T5 lamp is used as the light source for the measurement of DSSC performance; the T5 lamp is a common indoor lighting lamp and the spectrum of the T5 lamp is shown in Fig. S5.† The resulting J–V curves are shown in Fig. 6, and the corresponding parameters are listed in Table 4. The DSSC with the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE shows impressive η's of 19.88 ± 0.10%, 18.24 ± 0.06%, and 16.00 ± 0.13% at 7000 lux (2.21 mW cm−2), 6000 lux (1.89 mW cm−2) and 4800 lux (1.55 mW cm−2), respectively. According to the data shown in Table 4, the cell using the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE exhibits a stable VOC value even with decreasing light intensity; moreover, it also shows better performance than the cell using the Pt CE (Table S2 and Fig. S6†).

4. Conclusions
In this study, the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL electro-catalyst is successfully synthesized by a hydrothermal method and identified by XRD and XPS. SEM images show that CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL has an urchin-like structure. Moreover, the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL growth mechanism is mentioned and discussed in Scheme 1. A DSSC using the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE exhibits an η of 9.29 ± 0.24%, which is higher than those of cells with CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP (8.81 ± 0.33%) and Pt (8.33 ± 0.07%) CEs. In the CV measurement, the results show that CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL has the best electro-catalytic ability with a JPC value of 1.90 mA cm−2 and a ΔEP value of 0.33 V. In the measurement of the electrochemical double-layer capacitance, the CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP CE possesses a larger reaction area than the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE, implying that the electro-catalytic performance not only depends on the reaction area but also on its electron pathway. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy shows that the Rct-EIS value of CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL is much smaller than those of the electrodes with Pt, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL, and CoSe2/CoSeO3-NP and thereby indicates its best electro-catalytic ability among all the electrodes. The Rct-Tafel values are consistent with the fact that the counter electrode with CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL has the best electro-catalytic ability among all. On the other hand, the DSSC using the CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL CE shows an impressive η of 19.88 ± 0.10% under dim light irradiation (T5 lamp; 7000 lux; 2.21 mW cm−2). Overall, CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL possesses great potential to replace Pt as a highly efficient electro-catalyst in DSSCs. Moreover, regarding environmentally friendly materials and durability issues, DSSCs with CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL are comparable with perovskite solar cells, which usually require an environmentally hazardous heavy metal and have a low tolerance to moist air and water vapor.43 The concurrent advantages of simple fabrication (i.e., the hydrothermal method), low material cost and high performance under dim light sources allow the proposed DSSCs to have a diverse range of indoor and low-level outdoor lighting applications. Several literature studies have reported that transition metal selenides could work with other redox systems.44–46 Therefore, these indicate that CoSe2/CoSeO3-UL has the potential to be applied in various electrolyte systems, including cobalt-based, polysulfide-based, and copper-based electrolytes.
