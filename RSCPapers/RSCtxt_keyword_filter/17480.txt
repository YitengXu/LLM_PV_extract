    , Accepted 18th November 2021First published on 7th December 2021AbstractWith perovskite materials, rapid progress in power conversion efficiency (PCE) to reach 25% has gained a significant amount of attention from the solar cell industry. Since the development of solid-state perovskite solar cells, rapid research development and investigation on structure design, device fabrication and fundamental studies have contributed to solid-state perovskite solar cells to be a strong candidate for next-generation solar energy. The promising efficiency with low-cost materials is the key point over the other material-based solar cells. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of two-dimensional (2D) perovskite materials is yet to be enhanced in order to contest with the 3D perovskite-based solar cells. Their enormous variety compromises better prospects and possibilities for research. Two-dimensional (2D) perovskites play a multi-functional role within a solar cell, such as a capping layer, passivating layer, prime cell absorber, and in a hybrid 3D/2D perovskite-based solar cell absorber. This review summarizes the evolution of solar cells that are based on 2D perovskites and their prominent character in solar cells, along with the significant trends. The fundamental configuration and the optoelectronic characteristics, including the band orientation and the transportation of the charges, are discussed in detail. The 2D perovskites are analyzed to study the confined charges within the inorganic structure due to the dielectric and quantum confinement influence. Furthermore, the importance of cesium cation (Cs+) doped with 2D substance (BA)2(MA3) PbI3 approach has been discussed to attain high power conversion efficiency (PCE). These attributes offer an efficient step towards air-stable and small-sized perovskites as a new group of renewable energy sources.
1. Introduction
Solar cells are a very sustainable and clean energy source that can provide an endless stream of energy for human beings.1–4 During the past few years, rapid developments have made the organic/inorganic perovskite material a game-changer in the photovoltaic performance race.5,6 An initial report in 2009 demonstrated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) producing a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8%.7 For the first time, a solid perovskite solar cell with a PCE of 9.7% was reported in 2012. Following that, a solid-state solar cell with power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of over 23% was reported, which presents an extensive and firm progression ratio.8 The mixed halide perovskites have been considered to be perfect for photovoltaic applications, which are prospective accredited to the exceptional optoelectronic characteristics due to their low fabrication cost and ease of processing. Several modifications have concentrated on improving perovskite absorbers, such as perovskite nanostructures,9,10 patterns,11,12 defect passivation,13,14 tolerance factor,15,16 and device configurations, which include interface adjustments,17,18 contact layers,19–22 and the encapsulation of devices.23,24 One significant class that consists of the usage of 2D or quasi-2D perovskite has presented the prominent potential to enhance the PSC's permanence.25,26 In recent times, many more reports have been presented on PSCs with another class of superstar 2D materials, such as black phosphorus (BP),27–29 transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs),30–33 and graphene.34–36 As a result of the extraordinary physical and organic characteristics of the perovskites materials, great enhancements have been presented after discovering 2D materials for the growth of PSCs.1,37–43 Weber et al. first demonstrated the exceptional configuration and the characteristics of 3D perovskites in 1978.44 Since the major findings regarding PSCs, in 2009, Miyasaka et al. utilized methyl-ammonium lead triiodide (CH3NH3PbI3, which acts as a light catching material) with a molten electrolyte in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), which generated a value of PCE of about 3.8%. Kojima et al. reported a value of <10% in solid-state PSCs.7 In the meantime, Heo et al.45 attained a value of PCE of about 12% by utilizing both flexible films including the perovskite layer covering the TiO2 invaded by perovskite. They investigated various hole transport material (HTM) based PSCs consisting of polytriarylamine and spiro-OMeTAD and examined that PSCs based on these materials attained the highest efficiency as compared to others. After this, Seok and his collaborators enhanced the PCE to 12.3% by utilizing a composite halide CH3NH3PbI3−xBrx perovskite substance.46 The insertion of Br about 10–20% to the composite halides resulted in a prominent enhancement in stability and efficiency due to the transition of tetragonal to the pseudo-cubic arrangement of perovskites.47 In 2013, Burschka et al. presented that a method of deposition for the sensitized configuration crosses the efficiency of 15% using a 2-step solution procedure.48 Recently, Zhou et al. have established different devices based on perovskite materials and succeeded in attaining a PCE of 19.3% by modifying the band structure of hole transport materials (HTM)/electron transport materials (ETM) to the perovskite film. Shin et al. investigated the superoxide colloidal solution method for making a lanthanum (La)-doped BaSnO3 (LBSO) electrode under very mild conditions (near 300 °C). The PSCs designed using methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) and LBSO present a uniform power conversion efficiency of 21.2% as compared to the 19.5% for an mp-TiO2. The PSC based on LBSO can maintain 93% of its primary functioning after 1000 h of full sun illumination. These innovations have attracted significant attention towards PSCs.49–57 Two-dimensional (2D) based perovskite materials have rapidly become a significant substitute to three-dimensional perovskite solar cells. Additionally, 2D PSCs have presented particular benefits over 3D materials, such as enhanced stability towards light and moisture,58 better long-time stability,59 and enhanced biochemical flexibility.60 These prominent abilities make 2D perovskites a substantial substitute, which has attracted significant interest over the previous few years.2 Moreover, in contrast to their 3D counterparts, where the choice of the organic moiety is limited by the Goldschmidt tolerance factor, various chemical engineering options are open in 2D perovskites due to the loosened tolerance factor. In 2D hybrid perovskites, for example, a library of organic ligands has been established, and the inorganic layer thickness may also be modified synthetically. The chemical modification offers exceptional prospects to switch their structure modification,61 quantum and dielectric confinement,62 Rashba splitting,63 and exciton–phonon coupling,64 which result in tuning of their electronic, spin, and optical characteristics.65–70 These perovskites have presented incredible application prospects for photoemissions (broad emission versus exciton), photo-detectors,71,72 and spintronic applications,73–75 which is presented in Fig. 1.

In this article, we demonstrated a brief evaluation of the research effort related to perovskite constituents in PSCs. The application of these materials for electrodes, electron and hole transportation, and integration in perovskite films are also discussed. Furthermore, this review gives a comprehensive description of the composition of the inorganic/organic perovskites, such as PSCs based on 2D materials. We then highlighted the latest accomplishments of utilizing perovskite to investigate the applications that consist of photovoltaic cells,76 light-emitting diodes (LEDs),76 and photosensors.77,78
2. Crystal and chemical configuration
Perovskite is a naturally occurring mineral of calcium titanate (CaTiO)3.79 The fundamental 3D perovskite materials show a typical configuration of ABX3 and six halide anions (X side e.g. I−, Cl−, and Br−) synchronized to a divalent metal cation (B portion: e.g., Sn2+ and Pb2+) generate a BX6 octahedral structure, which is presented in Fig. 2(a).3,80 The cations (twelve monovalent: A portion: e.g., MA+, CS+, and FA+) conquer the centers of four BX6 octahedra. Every X, A, and B portion can consist of one or several elements, which permit flexibility to set the characteristics of the perovskites. This formation of the perovskite configuration is frequently established like the Goldschmidt tolerance factor (t).81 (1)

Here, rx, rA, and rB represent the ionic radii, and t lies between 0.8 and 1; a stable 3D perovskite configuration can be formed.82 Furthermore, the octahedral feature (μ = rB/rX: μ ranges from 0.4 to 0.9) can be utilized to estimate whether a B-portion atom desires an octahedral synchronization of the X-position atom.83,84 The 2D perovskite is usually designated with an expression (A′)m(A)n−1BnX3n+1, in which A′ may be monovalent (m = 2) or divalent (m = 1) cations that construct a monolayer or bilayer that joins the (A)n−1BnX3n+1 2D inorganic layers; in this expression, n represents the thickness of metal halide layers which can be fixed by modifying the precursor arrangement (Fig. 2a).85,86 The orientation of a 2D octahedral structure, which particularly comprises a BX42− inorganic component, requires to be stable by a positive charge, such as A2′BX4. A′ is a monovalent cation here, and n = 2. It is stated that when n = ∞, it then resembles materials based on 3D perovskite. However, n = 1 presents the pure 2D,56 and with an increment in “n”, the dissimilarities of the thermodynamic strength in greater-n configuration reduce, which marks that it seldom grows a pure-phase high-n arrangement.87 Hence, the value of n for these types of materials is normally based on the precursor combination.
Certain metal-containing compounds implement the perovskite structure, which has a regular distribution of anions and cations that is partially reversed. The arrangement of perovskite is often distinguished as a distortion in such mode that the unit cell is no longer symmetric with respect to the center, and the crystal prompts an eternal polarization caused by the distance of ions.88 Several superconducting ceramics exhibit a perovskite structure, consisting of a metal such as Cu and some O sites left unoccupied. The materials Y–Ba–Cu–O might be superconducting or insulators with respect to the quantity of oxygen.89,90 This compound is being considered as a replacement for platinum in automobiles as a catalytic converter. The materials SrTiO3 and CaRbF3 exhibited a unique cubic perovskite configuration.91,92 The schematic of the ABX3 structure is illustrated in Fig. 2(b) (left side figure, green color ball and stick model). The SrTiO3 is labeled as Sr and O ions display a cubic shape and Ti ions subjugate the octahedral holes generated by the O ions as presented in Fig. 2b (right part figure, blue color ball and stick model). These materials have demonstrated significant application in various fields and most perovskite compounds are distorted and do not exhibit the unique cubic configuration.
3. Electronic band configuration and absorption coefficient
2D-perovskites exhibit few of the same features as 3D-perovskites and others that change dramatically. First, 2D perovskites present a valence band that is primarily based on p-orbitals combined with s-orbitals or metal substances and a conduction band. In lead iodide mixed perovskite, the related orbitals are I (5p), Pb (6s), and (6p).93 Due to the dielectric effect in slabs, 2D materials have better exciton binding energies than 3D materials, and the excited electrons are more associated with holes; thus, we may say that they obtain more exciton binding energy. Therefore, the dielectric confinement influence is initiated by altering the low dielectric constant that is attributed to the organic family and the high dielectric value of lead(II) halide layers, which is presented in Fig. 3.94–96 A 3D schematic illustrates an inorganic structure of the corner allocation metal octahedral (red) substance with organic cations, which are black and blue. Green shows the limitation on the cation size and the greater HOMO–LUMO gap of the organic cation, which is situated in the green region.
 Fig. 3  Energy representation analogous to the 2D configuration, which includes the conduction band CB, valence band VB, optical band gap Eexc, and electronic band (Eg). The organic structure shows a dielectric constant ε2, whereas the inorganic sheets have ε1. This illustration is revised from ref. 96, copyright 2019 ACS. 
However, for solar cells, the exciton constant rises significantly with n. The lead perovskite with n > 3 has an exciton binding energy (Eb) that is equivalent to that of 3D materials. They are capable of functioning efficiently as solar cell absorbers, which is shown in Fig. 4(a).95,97 The bandgap is a crucial parameter in a solar cell, and it concludes the extremely accessible output voltages by the related sample for the Shockley Queisser typical model.2,97,98 For the single interface samples, the bandgap can be 1.34 eV, which is the principal outcome in a PCE of about 33.5%,97,99 whereas the larger bandgaps (>1.9 eV) might be interesting for tandem solar cells. The bandgap is typically observed with the alignment and the thickness of the inorganic layer. The thicker halides decrease the bandgap of analog substances; for instance, the n = 1, 2D perovskites with a formula (PEA)2PbX4 have bandgaps of almost 2.5, 3.0, and 3.8 eV for iodide, bromide, and chloride simultaneously.100 Many delocalized electronic densities of the bigger and a smaller amount of electronegative halides can easily overlay with the atoms of the metals.99 The addition of halide can be significantly fractional, and 2D metal-halide perovskite's bandgap can be tuned by modifying its composition form, which allows for broad absorption through visible wavelengths and even nearer to the infrared wavelengths.

(b) Photoluminescence (PL) and bandgap of the (BA)2(MA)n−1PbI3n+1 perovskite as related with the value of n. The value of n = ∞ corresponds to MAPbI3. (a) and (b) are revised from ref. 2. 
The photoluminescence wavelength and bandgap can be regulated by layer number n, where the bandgap usually becomes smaller as n increases. The PL asymptotically moves towards the smaller energies as n improves, which is shown in Fig. 4(b). Many properties behave similarly, and as n increases, the material properties will approach those of 3D perovskite. The absorption coefficient is openly related to the strength of the dipole of the electronic changes. 2D-perovskites have a smaller value of light absorption due to the lower density of the metal/halogen atoms and electrons per unit volume that can be stimulated for the immersion of light, which yields a lower absorption cross-section. However, the coefficient of absorption abruptly improves as the value of n increases, and absorption coefficients for values of n larger than 3 are analogous to those of 3D perovskites. Hence, 2D perovskites with the value of n ≥3 have greater coefficients of absorption to gather the maximum of the radiant energy with comparatively thin layers.97,101
The quantum confinement phenomenon openly affects the bandgap (Eg) of 2D perovskite, and the value of Eg depends on the width. The value of Eg for BA2An−1PbnI3n+1 (BA2MAn−1PbnI3n+1) perovskites reduced with improvements in the layer thickness from 2.24 eV (for n = 1) to 1.52 eV (n = ∞) because of the confinement phenomenon that is related to the dimensional enhancement, which is presented in Fig. 5(a). The value of the electronegativity and the size of materials can also influence Eg, which increases as the size is reduced. The element Pb has a smaller electronegativity compared to Sn, so the Pb electronic positions are greater in the band configuration.102 The excitons showed a vital impact on the transportation of the charge in the semi-metals.102 The 2D arrangement normally represents an enormous exciton binding energy (EB) of numerous hundred meV, which is illustrated in Fig. 5(b), and it extensively improves the collaboration among the electrons and the holes in comparison to the 3D substances.103

4. Preparation methodologies
Several ways have been advised to prepare a higher quality perovskite material layer, including sequential solution deposition, one step deposition from precursor solution, vapor aided solution process method, and dual source thermal evaporation under a high vacuum process.
4.1. One-step precursor solution deposition
Because of its simplicity, the one-step precursor solution deposition approach is particularly easy to use to produce perovskite films, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Usually, the perovskite solution is synthesized by combining MAX and PbX2 (X: Br−, I−, and Cl−) in gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a clear solution.7,104 Further, this solution was spin-coated on the substrate and annealed at 120–150 °C to complete the transformation of the perovskite film. The main disadvantage of this method is that naturally perovskite often prefers to form a homogeneous film. Such a low-quality perovskite film is susceptible to the rapid degradation of the PVSCs. The composition of the solvent105,106 and annealing temperatures107 all have a significant influence on the final film quality. To modulate the crystal development kinetics, antisolvent engineering is used, e.g., chlorobenzene,108 diethyl ether,55 and toluene.109 The fast deposition crystallization (FDC) method is advantageous for producing uniform and flat MAPbI3 perovskite films in a single step using antisolvent engineering. Fig. 6b shows that the fast deposition and crystallization (FDC) approach can be used to generate a smooth and uniform perovskite layer. After a certain delay period, a perovskite precursor solution is spin-coated on the TiO2 layer, and then a second solvent (chlorobenzene) is quickly added to the substrate to generate high-quality perovskite thin films using the FDC technique. The second role is to limit the solubility of CH3NH3PbI3 in the solvent quickly, allowing the crystals in the film to nucleate and grow quickly. The high grain size created by the FDC approach can minimize the grain boundaries of perovskite films, preventing the degradation of the perovskite. This has been the recommended technique of deposition in order to produce all subsequent PCE records of 21.6%.51

4.2. Solution-processed two-step method (sequential method)
Mitzi's group proposed two-step sequential deposition in 1998110 as shown in Fig. 6(c). In particular in the sequential deposition technique, a PbI2 layer was spin-coated on the mesoporous TiO2 substrate. Further, the dried PbI2 film was immersed in the isopropanol solution comprising CH3NH3I, followed by rinsing with isopropanol solution to transfer onto the perovskite film by annealing. Solution concentration and dipping time are crucial to the morphology and optoelectronic characteristics of the final film. It has been stated that a two-step approach for the planar substrate can produce a significantly thinner layer with just approximately 200 nm thickness. To address the issue caused by the dipping procedure, a two-step spin-coating method was developed. Park and his collaborators demonstrated the “two-step spin-coating methodology, in which MAI solution was spin-coated on the PbI2 thin layer, instead of dipping the PbI2 to the MAI solution, which was shown to create a nano cubic perovskite morphology.111 The best efficiency of PSCs prepared by the two-step deposition technique has been up to 22.1% with greater stability”.52
4.3. Dual-source thermal evaporation
The vapor deposition technique was first described to make a uniform, flat perovskite film under a high vacuum by Mitzi et al.112,113 Liu et al. created planar heterojunction MAPbI3xClx perovskite films using the dual evaporation approach.114 The thickness of the layers may be precisely regulated by the deposition rate measured by the crystal oscillator. When compared to the solution procedure, the dual evaporation produces a considerably more homogeneous nanocrystal sheet with no pinholes. The vapor-deposition process necessitates a high vacuum and a sophisticated growth mechanism in vapor-phase deposition, making industrialisation challenging in the future.115
4.4. Vapor-assisted solution technique
Yang and co-researchers described a new low-temperature vapor-assisted solution approach for perovskite layer deposition that combines two-step sequential deposition with thermal evaporation as shown in Fig. 6(d). In this process, the PbI2 layers were spin-coated on the compact TiO2, followed by CH3NH3I at a steam temperature of 150 °C in steam and annealing in N2 for 2 h to generate a homogeneous perovskite grain structure with a PCE of 12.1%. To successfully prevent the high reaction rate in dual vapor deposition and flaws caused in the two-step sequential deposition, a simple and controlled approach for pursuing high-quality perovskite films was given.116 This approach produced perovskite films with improved crystallization, good surface coverage, and low surface roughness, all of which are helpful to perovskite stability. The gas–solid interaction, on the other hand, generally takes tens of hours to complete. PVSCs made using this approach now have a maximum efficiency of 20.5% and a validated PCE of 19.6% with an aperture area greater than 1 cm2.117
5. Transportation of the charge
Due to the confining properties of 2D perovskites, anisotropic carrier mobility and conductivity are produced along several crystallographic dimensions. The mobility and conductivity are more significantly common compared to the observed perpendicular to the slab when examined along the side of the inorganic slab. Additionally, the charge transfer trend for two-dimensional perovskite presents a high reliance on the value of n. Furthermore, as the ratio of inorganic perovskite sheets per organic spacer increases mobility, which arises efficiently as a nonstop inorganic approach, is achieved. The alignment of 2D thin films is crucial for the functioning of the sample. Improved performance is typically obtained when the inorganic sheets are aligned parallel to the charge-gathering path. The charge transport phenomenon among the inorganic films has been expected to be facilitated by a tunneling mechanism118,119 with the organic substance acting as a barrier. The tunnel junction has two prominent features that influence the charge transport, which include (1) the height of the barrier and (2) the tunneling distance.119 The height of the barrier can change that depends on two basic effects, which include (i) the intermolecular coupling among the neighboring cations and (ii) the energy distribution among the transport belt of perovskite material and the decline of potential of the cations. The following details were reviewed here, which include the charge transportation in (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 after Cs+ doping that is utilized here and tuning the perovskite for improved material characteristics. The photovoltaic routine of the 2D solar cells seems to be restricted by their several quantum well configurations,94,120 even though the cation has been certified to be a prominent approach to improve the optoelectronic characteristics in 3D substances.23 It is imperative to solve this apprehension for 2D perovskites, and thus the characteristics of Csx-2D perovskites were examined regarding carrier mobility, charge transfer mechanism, and trap state density. Fig. 7(a) presents the dark voltage–current curves of the Csx-2D perovskite layer with an FTO/TiO2 Csx-2D arrangement. The density of the trap state was demonstrated using the trap-filled limit voltage expression.121 (2)where εr ( = 25) is the relative dielectric constant,122ε0 is the permittivity of the vacuum, q is present to charge, L is the thickness of the layer, and VTFL is the onset voltage of the trap-captured limit area. We reviewed here that the trap density ranges between 1.31 × 1015 cm−3 and 2.78 × 1015 cm−3 for all the thin films. Low trap density in the flake might be accredited to its remarkable film condition. These observations represent that the existing layers have partially smaller trap-state densities. These values for the trap state densities in the present investigation are lesser than the values in the 2D MAPbI3 layers (1017 cm−3), but they are quite a bit larger than the values in the monocrystalline form (109–1010 cm−3).123,124 Additionally, the fundamental mobility of the electron that was investigated by utilizing the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) technique ranges between 0.16 and 0.29 cm2 V−1 s−1, which is a better value than what was attained after the doping of Cs+ in the 2D-perovskites film, which is shown in Fig. 7(b). This study represents comparatively lower traps and better mobility upon doping.125

(b) The development in the mobility of electrons and trap density. (c) PL decay illustration of the layer on FTO/TiO2 substrates. (a), (b), and (c) are reused with acquiescence from ref. 126, exclusive rights RSC 2017. 
Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectroscopy was employed to explore the charge transmission mechanism, which is presented in Fig. 7(c), from the Csx-2D film to the FTO-TiO2 layer. TRPL shows a uniform decline through a slow photo-carrier lifetime (τ = 18.15 ± 0.13 ns) and a quick photo-carrier lifetime (τ = 8.84 ± 1.65 ns) in the Cs0-2D film. The doping with Cs+ decreased the lifetime from 14.79 ns to 4.31 ns with increments in Cs+ (0%–15%). We reviewed this decrease in PL decay to the quick transfer charging phenomenon, which is very constructive to conquer the charge recombination at the ETL-perovskite junction. Those outcomes presented that the optoelectronic characteristics of 2D perovskites can be enhanced by the doping with Cs+. Moreover, due to the greater confined transport of charges at the 2D sites, any effort to improve defects among the 2D flat surface possibly have small comportment on the transportation and optoelectronic characteristics of the 2D planes.
It was reviewed that several solar-powered devices were built in such a way that FTO/TiO2/CSx-2D perovskites/spiro-OMeTAD/Au, as shown in Fig. 8(a), and were tested under the standard AM 1.5G radiance with a scanning rate of 0.1 V s−1. The thinner layers reduce the light-harvesting, the value of Jsc, and the efficiency. A significant improvement in the sample performance was seen after 5% Cs+ doping. A peak value of PCE (13.68%), Voc = 1.08 V, Jsc = 19.95 mA cm−2, and FF = 63.47% for this 2D device are demonstrated in Fig. 8(b). According to our knowledge, it is the greatest PCE value ever achieved for solar cells for this device.127,128 The investigation that is related to short circuit current density Jsc and external quantum efficiency (EQE) is presented in Fig. 8(c). The EQE band is in a good agreement with the captivation of light, which disappeared at 768 nm. A quick drop inclination in EQE above 630 nm that was initiated from the minor captivation intensity was seen in comparison to the 3D MAPBI3 layer. A further investigation was made to calculate the hysteresis influence that has been stated in the conventional 3D perovskites, which is illustrated in Fig. 8(d). A minor alteration was seen in the J–V curves when moving from forward to reverse scanning that signified intimidated hysteresis. Two groups newly observed the phenomenon of the lower hysteresis in the two-dimensional perovskites. Peng, W., and co-worker investigated that 2D materials have potential three times, which reduces the self-doping value, as opposed to 3D materials, which facilitates conquering hysteresis in 2D perovskite layers.129 In the meantime, Huang and his collaborators observed that the conductivity is efficiently inhibited in these 2D materials in illumination and a dark state.130 It shows that any smaller alterations in the arrangement of the material could change the carrier gathering at the electrode and accordingly make alterations in the J–V hysteresis curves in the device-based solar cells.131–133 Jiang et al. utilized indene-C60 bisadduct (ICBA) fullerene as an electron-transporting layer in inverted type Sn-PSCs.134 ICBA is a commercially presented typical fullerene derivative; thus, it is admirable that they developed such a high outcome using a simply available material. Moreover, the attained PCE of 12.4% has reached a new milestone surpassing the 12% limit as shown in the table below. Hayase and collaborators enhanced their previous samples and described a significant sample functioning of 13.24%. The energy level of the Ge-doped FA0.98EDA0.01 DSnI3 layer was controlled by modifying the quantity of ethyl-ammonium (EA), which led to a considerable improvement in open circuit voltage (Voc). The overall PCE was greater due to comparatively better short circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF) and sophisticated perovskite layer quality.135 Diau et al. established a two-way technique for solution processing to make 3D/2D hybrid Sn-based perovskite films. Since perovskite configuration FA0.8GA0.2SnI3, where GA represents guanidinium, different bulky ammonium cations (BACs) and hexfluoro-2-propanol were utilized to make 2D Sn-based perovskite films. Among different BACs, anilinium was investigated to make the thin 2D film which led to a significant PCE of 10.6% with a self-healing effect.136 Recently Han and collaborators established a low-temperature deposition technique with an additive of PEAI or post treatment by n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) to grow crystal grains. Thus, the significance of Sn-based perovskite was enhanced by reducing the crystal growth or bringing a special orientation. Additionally, organic ammonium PEA and butylammonium (BA) and EDA were utilized to support the oriented development of Sn-doped materials by limiting the titling of grains. Moreover, the growth of layers was retarded by solvent evaporation and torpid solute diffusion, promoting Ostwald ripening.137 Furthermore, the researchers utilized n-propylammonium iodide (PAI) for post-treatment to enhance the device's functioning. A PCE of 12.11% was achieved and the device was stable for 20 days as shown in the table.137

6. 2D/3D hybrid structure of perovskite materials
Due to the restricted transport on the organic spacer film and the larger bandgap, two-dimensional (n = 1) PSCs typically do not represent the high proficiencies that three-dimensional PSCs do. Also, 2D/3D perovskite that is made by including 2D into 3D perovskites, which utilizes the bulky cation to change the smaller number of cations in the precursor material, has newly seemed to remain a prominent technique to create a well-defined functioning with longer working permanence.138 Based on the previous report regarding the high constancy of 2D materials, Yao et al. stated a technique to make an undeviating and compact (MAPbI3)1−x((PEI)2PbI4)x 3D layered material. By utilizing spin-coating, a primary PbI2 and polyethyleneimine hydriodide (PEI·HI) motley solution was then covered with a CH3NH3I sheet to grow a layer;121 the in situ made (PEI)2PbI4 combination represented to check the material development and encourage the growth of a smooth flake and the growth of 3D crystals with domains that were mired by enhancing the different 2D substances. A PCE value of about 15.2% was attained by this technique for a (MAPbI3)0.98((PEI)2PbI4)0.02 layer, which showed higher constancy than that the permanency of the 3D MAPbI3-based devices.
Wang, Z., et al. incorporated BA+ into a hybrid-cation 3D FA0.83Cs0.17Pb(IyBr1−y)3 perovskite material.139 They observed that the growth of the 2D perovskite layers dispersed between the greatly focused 3D grains, and these 2D perovskite arrangements prominently decrease the nonradiative charge recombination, which is presented in Fig. 9(a). As the outcome, a PSC based on BA0.05(FA0.83Cs0.17)0.95Pb(I0.8Br0.2)3 attained a PCE of 20.6%. The arrangement of a 3D/2D junction is observed to be analogous to a typical type-I or type-II hetero-interface, which is due to the broader bandgap of the 2D materials.140 With the increment ratio of BA+ cations and Br anions, BA0.09(FA0.83Cs0.17)0.91Pb(I0.6Br0.4)3 was established by an improved sample strength, and the device demonstrated a 20% performance. An analogous performance was investigated with other bulky substances, such as dimethylamine (DMA), 2-chloroethylamine (CEA+), and 2-thiophenemethylammonium (THMA).141,142

The intrinsic material combination is (FASnI3)0.6 (MAPbI3)0.4, which is revised with an agreement from ref. 3, exclusive rights RSC 2020. 
FAPbI3 is another prominent material structure that has an extensive phase immovability problem. The addition of Cs+ in a lower amount in FAPbI3 to make CsFAPbI3 is a very operative technique to modify the tolerance factor to enhance the strength of the phase.11 However, it normally increases the value of the band gap, which leads to a decrement in Jsc. Including a definite quantity of 2D BA2Pb (I/BR)4 obsessed by the precursor enables the growth of the pre-phase material based on substance. Additional passivation of the grain boundaries by the semi-metals with the Lewis base clusters prominently enhances the transportation of charges, which leads to a PCE of about 20.62% and the enhanced strength of the devices. The method of including the PEA+-based 2D configuration into 3D materials were demonstrated by other researchers.143,144 Corresponding materials, such as PEAI and Pb(SCN)2 were utilized to enhance the wider-band gap PSC with the proficiency of about 20%.145 Tong et al. employed GuaSCN to lower the bandgap of Sn–Pb hybrid-perovskite thin layers to enhance their optoelectronic and structural characteristics that resulted due to the growth of a 2D configuration at the grain boundaries, which is illustrated in Fig. 9(b).62 New techniques to form 2D-PPAs with improved transportation of the charge are crucial for further successive and steady 2D-PPA-based-3D PSCs.

7. Strategies of the tuning of bandgap of 2D perovskites
Metal halide perovskite's bandgap is highly tuneable, with light emission ranging from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths. This is due not only to the intrinsic tuning of composition (e.g., the seamless mixing ratio of halides) in a perovskite, but also to the ease with which their dimensionality can be controlled. External stimuli can also engineer the bandgap of perovskites, such as light- or electric-field-induced phase separation (ion migration), thermal or moisture-induced phase transition, and mechanical effects of strain and pressure.
7.1. Modification of dimensionality
2D perovskites, which are currently receiving a lot of attention in the research community, have a lot of significant electronic and optical properties when compared to bulk perovskite and other 2D materials.159,160 The primary distinction is that 2D perovskite materials have ionic bonds in the crystal lattice, whereas inorganic 2D materials such as TMDCs are connected by a covalent band. Organic molecules sandwiching a 2D hybrid perovskite crystal plane add extra functionality, such as the ability to change the quantum well shape by varying the length and kind of organic chains.161 Interestingly, researchers noticed the reversible surface relaxation behavior of these 2D crystals, which means that the excitonic energies changed reversibly produced by laser annealing on these 2D crystals with hBN encapsulation. The similar layer-dependent trend was obtained in 2D perovskites with three cations containing both organic (PEA and MA) and inorganic (Cs) species, with a gradual decrease in bandgap energy within increasing layers and an energy difference between single unit-cell and five unit-cell crystals as high as 0.6 eV.162 Sky-blue perovskite LED devices were developed with great luminosity and color stability under high driving voltages, based on 2D perovskites with high energy bandgap and monodispersed phases.
7.2. Phase transition
Phase transition is extensively studied in lead halide perovskite with its significant effect on the band alignment and the functioning of the device.163,164 It is normally caused by the thermal effect and then crystal lattice re-arranged to another space group. Individual MAPbI3 perovskite microplates were found to exhibit size-dependent phase transition behavior, with the phase transition temperature from orthorhombic to tetragonal phases decreasing with increasing microplate thickness.165 This is not the case with bulk crystals. The difference in surface energy between the polymorphs was attributed to the thickness-dependent structural phase transition. The surface-to-volume ratio in the thicker microplate decreased, resulting in a higher phase transition temperature. Theoretical simulations revealed a temperature-dependent bandgap in MAPbI3 perovskite crystals, with two bandgaps emerging that are related to the MA-ordered and MA-disordered domains.166 Because the ordering of the MA cations creates a high local electric field, the bandgap of MA-ordered orthorhombic domains is increased.
7.3. Strain modulation
The strain is an effective feature to modify the band alignment of perovskite, specifically in a nanostructure form. The in-plane mechanical characteristics of 2D BA2MAn−1PbnX3n+1 perovskite few-layer were examined in a ridged substrate, revealing the reduced in-plane Young's moduli in comparison with covalent bonded 2D substances.167 These 2D perovskites presented thickness-dependent mechanical characteristics due to interlayer slippage during distortion. Theoretical calculations were also utilized to approximate the effect of strain on nanostructured perovskite, which shows that the bandgap of 2D MAPbI3 enhanced upon tensile strain and reduced upon compressive strain.168 However, the bandgap of one-dimensional MAPbI3 demonstrated parabolic expression to both compressive and tensile strain. Development in the band structure and optical bandgaps of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 perovskite under tensile and compressive strain was examined.169 Compared to a bandgap of 1.49 eV in strain-free perovskite, the tensile strain (1%) brought an enhancement to 1.55 eV while compressive strain (1%) yielded a reduction to 1.44 eV.
7.4. Compositional substitution
This technique is normally very suitable and beneficial to modify the band structure of 2D perovskite nanostructures. In the perovskite crystal arrangement, the position of the halide (X) is most tuneable in terms of mixing with any ratio of the target. Substitution of the cations (A) and metal (B) can redefine the bandgap of perovskite and enhance the emission spectrum. The comprehensive emission range across the entire visible spectrum of the specific MAPbX3 perovskite by a selective mixture of Cl/Br and Br/I was examined.170 Likewise, continuous spectral modification can be investigated in all-inorganic perovskite nanocrystals (NCs).171,172 It was reported that in CsPbBr3 NCs with a bandgap of 2.43 eV, the halide-added perovskite NCs showed a steadily enhanced bandgap of about 3.03 eV with greater Cl interaction and slowly reduced bandgap of 1.88 eV with maximum iodide(I) exchange. Prominently, the anion interchange reactions were reversible and vigorous. The solution-form anion interchange process preserves both optical and structural characteristics of perovskite NCs comparable to the NCs by direct synthesis. Also, the solution interaction, vapor phase transformation was induced to make mixed halide perovskites.173,174 Consequently, both vapor and solution-based mechanisms are effective to modify the bandgaps of perovskites in a facile and fast way.
8. Applications of perovskite materials other than solar cells
The excitonic nature and the flexible configuration in the mixed 2D perovskite also give way to other various optoelectronic applications. The exciton phenomenon in 2D perovskite with a smaller value of n can extensively encourages radiative recombination, which gives way to better photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) in perovskite-based LED devices,175,176 and it makes them efficient materials for better efficiency LEDs.177,178 The operational variety, impurity doping, magnetic ordering, and crystalline phase can appropriately permit us to accurately modify their spin lifetime, broadband emissions, and magnetic order with the related magnetic as well as electrical and optical characteristics if they are engineered properly.3,73,82,179–182
9. Challenges and prospects
Previously, the researchers recognized the inspiring development in PSCs based on 2D/3D perovskite materials having durable constancy and significant PCE. On the other hand, the PCE of PSCs depending on 2D perovskite materials with a smaller value of n is still lower as compared to PSCs based on 3D perovskite materials. The technique of including an interfacial layer based on 2D halide perovskites has attained some achievements; the control of layer number and treatments are still required. To overcome the issue of stability, researchers are paying attention to 2D halide perovskites, which can be attained by encapsulation which is also not a suitable technique. Thus, the major concentration should be on heat and light stability of 2D perovskite materials to enhance the functioning greater than that of the 3D perovskites.183,184 Mainly, three serious problems of instability in PSCs are deprivation in photocurrent as a function of time upon light soaking,185 the reliance of J–V transfer curves of the PSCs on sweeping speed, called hysteresis effects, and the third one is moisture.186 Photocurrent reduction is overcome by using metastable devices185 which can be enhanced by utilizing composite cation perovskites187–189 or using additives such as ionic liquids.190 The moisture problem can be resolved through the encapsulation technique by restricting the reaction of water and oxygen with perovskites.187 The third problem is linked with hysteresis which can be overcome by changing the electron transporting materials (ETMs) or tuning the perovskites/ETM junctions.191–193 Meanwhile, the hysteresis influence is investigated during PSC working,65 at the hetero-interface the accumulation and release of charges,194,195 and transfer of greater density of ions in the perovskites. Some reports present the simulation utilizing a static model to draw the dynamic hysteresis effect by accumulating junction traps with and without immediate and stable dopants at the junctions.196,197 The improvement in charge transport layers might significantly raise the value of Voc and inclusive functioning of PSCs based on 2D perovskite materials.
Recent research shows that effective, and efficient fabrication techniques are necessary to enhance the industrialization of perovskite materials and their associated devices and hence the simple heterostructure configuration and annealing under an open-air atmosphere are the best arrangements to enhance the bulk fabrication of perovskite photovoltaic devices. But issues like the instability of perovskite materials like CH3NH3PbI3 due to air moisture effects can damage the device performance as well as efficiency. Fabrication of perovskite solar cells with suitable thermal energy action or proper annealing could be an operative way to reduce the obstructing features for perovskite solar cell construction under ambient conditions. Few interesting heterojunction PSCs and their fabrication enhancement phenomena have been described as well.198–200 Highly hygroscopic methyl-ammonium cations {(CH3NH2)+} can improve the efficiency of the device by enhancing the CH3NH3PBI3 crystal lattice which causes the reduction of the damaging tendency of the CH3NH3PBI3 based PSC by absorbing moisture upon air annealing.198 Therefore, an efficient fabrication method is urgently essential to assemble PSCs under an open atmosphere that can control the performance, proper phase formation, and film morphology. Moreover, for the pure perovskite materials, the application of the previous development of the low dimensional materials could lift the industrialization of PSCs during the upcoming days.201,202 From the material engineering point of view, various types of perovskites can be prepared, and unidentified properties can be explored. Furthermore, still, it is a challenge to study the preparation process of 2D layered perovskites, which will make us capable of forming these kinds of layered materials with greater phase purity and out-of-plane alignment and make 2D/3D perovskites in a more well-regulated process. Another point is that understanding the physical and chemical interaction among 2D, 3D, and 2D/3D perovskites is necessary. The evolution in the adjacent charge transfer layer is a key feature to attain stable and effective PSCs. The modification of the band gap is a crucial parameter to make ideal 2D perovskite material-based solar cells and for the enhancement of energy harvesting.203 While large-area perovskite thin films with a smooth surface can be better recognized now, confirming that they exhibit uniform electronic characteristics is also essential. An influential diffusion barrier film or the addition of electrodes based on noble metals is extra beneficial for PSCs for durable applications. For transportation of electrons, even though there are several options, appropriate energy level configurations, materials with smaller trap density, and informal production techniques are also desirable. Additionally, placing metal grids on FTO can enhance the conductivity; the presence of metals could affect the junction characteristics such as carrier recombination and wettability. In the future, it is our prospect that the research about 2D perovskites could be inspiring which might probably change 3D perovskite materials and become novel as compared to semiconducting substances for solar cell applications.184
10. Conclusion
Two-dimensional (2D) perovskite absorber layer-based solar cells showed an enhancement in the PCE up to 20–25%. These outcomes refer to the efficient utilization of the 2D perovskite substances in the field of optoelectronics. Furthermore, 2D perovskites also present exceptional usage in spintronics, LEDs, photo-detector devices, and broadband emissions. These compounds act as a model to recognize several important structure–property interactions containing the Rashba effect, spin–orbit coupling, light-matter relations, and exciton–phonon coupling. The electronic band configuration of semi-metals depends on the composition and size of the atom, which also includes being adjacent, the typical distance, and the dimensionality. In these 2D perovskites, the charges are typically limited to the inorganic structure, which may be due to the durable quantum and dielectric confinement mechanism. Also, at room temperature, the exciton binding energies are numerous times better than kT. We defined the part of the substantial atoms in the inorganic arrangement, the size and interaction of the cations, and the softness of the organic/inorganic framework on the electronic configuration. The importance of the excitons, electrons, and phonons that rule the physical properties of these constituents is particularized. Furthermore, to explore the efficient properties of perovskites for different applications, more techniques are essential to emphasize the growth mechanism, material design, and the basic chemical and physical characteristics of inorganic, organic, and hybrid halide perovskites. The enormous charge-transport characteristics along the in-plane and out of the plane side for perovskites will continue as a dynamic field of research for several optoelectronic purposes. Further, mixed bulky cations for these materials also exhibit exciting results that should be followed. Finally, better research methodologies are required to pay attention to 2D/3D mixed structures based on perovskites; 2D perovskites can work as a capping film or passivating substance to enhance the efficiency and stability of devices. A significant improvement is required for the synthetic control to make translucent 2D capping films with tunable energy level or thickness of layers (i.e. value of n) of the 2D configuration. The strategy of novel bulky cations that could make stable 2D configurations with improved transportation of charges through the plane to plane with an innovative method to control the 2D alignment/structure will enhance the functioning and stability of 2D and 3D based PSCs.
