    , Accepted 6th August 2019First published on 8th August 2019AbstractCost-effective, Pt-free catalysts possessing superior electrochemical activity and stability are highly desirable for triiodide reduction reaction in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded in porous carbon shells (CoSe2/CS) were explored as highly efficient catalysts toward triiodide reduction reaction. The CoSe2/CS composites were fabricated using a soft-template approach involving the carbonization and selenization processes. The CoSe2 nanoparticles were well distributed within highly graphitized nitrogen-doped carbon nanoshells. More importantly, the CoSe2/CS catalysts presented both high catalytic performance and long-term stability, outperforming those of the thermally-deposited Pt electrode. Furthermore, the optimized DSC device with a CoSe2/CS catalyst-based counter electrode showed a power conversion efficiency of 7.54%, exceeding that of the thermally-deposited Pt (7.40%) counterpart. The enhanced catalytic activity, long-term stability and photovoltaic efficiency can be attributed to the much more reaction sites provided by CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded within the porous carbon shells, as well as the better band matching with the potential of the I3−/I− redox couple, revealed by the Kelvin probe force microscope measurement. This work will provide a strategy to construct low-cost, highly efficient and stable non-Pt catalysts for photovoltaic applications.
Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have been considered as one of the promising photovoltaic devices due to their low-cost, simple fabrication and relatively high power conversion efficiency.1–6 The power conversion efficiency of a solar cell is dependent greatly on each component employed in the whole device, including the dye, redox couple, electrolyte and catalyst deposited on the counter electrode.7–11 The function of the counter electrode is to catalyze the redox couple (I3−/I−) in the electrolyte and to construct a whole circuit for outputting the electric power.12 Thus, materials with merits of both high activity and conductivity are needed for catalysts used in the counter electrode.12To date, noble metal platinum (Pt)-based materials have been proved to be the most efficient catalysts for various reactions, including the tri-iodide reduction reaction (IRR), oxygen reduction reaction (OER) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER).13–15 However, their ultralow abundance on Earth and poor long-term stability towards the redox couple (I3−/I−) hinder their large-scale application in photovoltaic and energy conversion devices.10,16 Therefore, much effort has been devoted to exploring earth-abundant, low-cost Pt-free electrocatalysts for the I3− reduction reaction in DSCs, which might promote the commercialization application of DSCs.17–19
Recently, porous carbon shells have been investigated intensively for catalysis, energy conversion and storage due to their advantageous structural features and distinctive physicochemical properties including a large surface area and pore volume, high conductivity and superior corrosion resistance over various electrolytes.20–23 Porous carbon shells containing special open ends on the surface demonstrated enhancement in catalytic activity, compared with single hollow carbon spheres.24 Moreover, the catalytic activity of porous carbon shells towards the IRR could be largely enhanced by doping of heteroatoms into a carbon matrix.25,26 The enhancement originated from the asymmetrical electron spin density and charge polarization because of the difference in electronegativity between carbon and heteroatoms.5 Although there is some progress achieved for porous carbon shell-based catalyst materials, the catalytic activity is still inferior to that of Pt-based catalysts with regard to the IRR. This is partly due to the limited active sites exposed within the carbon catalysts.20–23,26 Thus, it is still a great challenge in maintaining the high conductivity and maximizing the high percentage of exposed active sites within porous carbon shell-based catalysts for the IRR.
To construct composite catalysts via the combination of a nonprecious catalyst with a conductive carbon network demonstrates a promising strategy to enhance the catalytic performance.12,27,28 The high activity stems from the synergism of the catalyst species and the conductive carbon network. The superior electrical conductivity of the carbon matrix can provide a great benefit for the electrochemical performance of catalysts.25,29 Therefore, coupling of porous carbon shells with other ideal nonprecious catalysts to form composites is an efficient strategy to maximize the active sites and simultaneously sustain the high conductivity. Recently, CoSe2 has been emerging as an attractive catalyst for the IRR, HER and OER owing to its abundant feedstock, simple fabrication and good chemical stability as well as high conductivity.30–32 More importantly, theoretical and experimental evidence confirm that CoSe2 possess metallic properties, which allows remarkable charge transport during the electrocatalytic process.33,34 Consequently, taking all these advantages into account, CoSe2 could be an ideal nonprecious catalyst coupling with carbon shells to form high-performance Pt-free catalysts for DSCs. It is therefore reasonable to expect that the as-designed CoSe2/CS composites could provide high conductivity and sufficient active sites as well as reasonably electrocatalytic activity for I3− reduction. Nevertheless, to the best of our knowledge, the utilization of CoSe2/CS composites as catalysts for the I3− reduction reaction has never been reported so far.
In this study, we report that CoSe2 embedded in carbon shells could be simply prepared via a soft template method involving the carbonization and selenization steps, and employed as the highly-efficient and stable electrocatalyst for I3− reduction in DSCs. During the carbonization step, the Co moieties and Co nanoparticles were in situ encapsulated within mesoporous N-doped carbon nanoshells. With the following selenization process under an inert atmosphere, the Co moieties and Co nanoparticles were converted to CoSe2 embedded within the hollow carbon spheres. The device assembled with the as-designed CoSe2/CS counter electrode exhibited an impressive performance of 7.56%, measured under one sunlight illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2), outperforming those of the devices based on the pristine carbon shell (4.54%) and conventional thermally-deposited Pt electrode (7.40%). More impressively, the as-prepared CoSe2-decorated CS composites showed better long-term stability than the Pt electrode with regard to the I3− reduction. The results suggest that the CoSe2-decorated CS is a great potential alternative to metal Pt as a catalyst in DSCs.
Experimental
Materials
Ammonium persulfate (APS), styrene, and cobalt nitrate hexahydrate were obtained from Xilong Chemical Co. Ltd. Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP, K13-18), dopamine hydrochloride (98%) and selenium powder (>99.9%) were from Aladdin Industrial Corporation. Tris buffer solution (>99%) was purchased from Amresco. Ethanol, hydrochloric acid, ethyl cellulose and titanium isopropoxide were of analytical grade and obtained from Beijing Chemical Reagent Company.
Preparation of CoOx/CS and CoSe2/CS samples
PVP (1.5 g) and styrene (11.5 mL) were added into deionized water (80 mL) and mixed using a stirring bar. Then, the mixture became milky white under ultrasonic conditions for 30 min. Finally, 0.048 mol L−1 APS aqueous solution (10 mL) was added into the above-mentioned solution with stirring at 70 °C for 5 hours. The white precipitates were obtained and centrifuged. The solids were then washed with ethanol three times, dried under air and kept for use.
PS spheres (700 mg) and dopamine hydrochloride (250 mg) were dispersed in Tris buffer solution (pH = 8.5, 45 mL). Different amounts of cobalt nitrate, including 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mmol, dissolved in 5 mL of Tris solution, were added into the above-mentioned solution with stirring at room temperature, and then the mixture was stirred for 36 hours. The precipitates were centrifuged and washed three times with ethanol. Finally, the solid was dried at 60 °C for 12 hours. The as-obtained samples were placed in the center of a tube furnace and heated to 800 °C at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1 and kept for 1 hour under an Ar atmosphere to yield CoOx/CS samples. For comparison, a blank carbon sphere was prepared using the same procedure without the cobalt nitrate. The as-prepared CoOx/CS samples (0.1 g) were mixed with Se powder (0.5 g), and then placed in a porcelain boat on the center of the tube furnace for calcination under 450 °C for 2 hours under an Ar atmosphere to produce CoSe2/CS samples.
Fabrication of DSC devices
To fabricate a counter electrode, the as-obtained samples were firstly ground to a paste. Briefly, a certain amount of sample (CoSe2/CS or CS) was ground with the binder solution to obtain a homogeneous dispersion. The binder solution was the mixture of 0.2 g of ethyl cellulose, 8.0 mL of terpineol and 0.5 mL titanium isopropoxide.26 The paste was then coated on the FTO-glass using the doctor-blading method. Those electrodes were subsequently sintered under an Ar atmosphere at 450 °C for 30 min in a tube furnace. The counter electrodes fabricated with carbon nanoshells containing different amounts of CoSe2 NPs prepared with 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 mmol of cobalt nitrate were labelled as CoSe2/CS-1, -2 and -3, respectively. The optimal thickness of the catalyst film in the counter electrode was about 11.2 μm. The Pt electrode was prepared by thermal decomposition of H2PtCl6 solution on the FTO substrate.28,29 N719-sensitized TiO2 films on the FTO substrate were prepared using the doctor-blading method. The liquid electrolyte was a solution of 0.6 M 1-methyl-3-butylimidazolium iodide, 0.03 M I2, 0.1 M guanidinium thiocyanate, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine in a mixed solvent of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (v/v, 0.85/0.15). DSCs were fabricated by sandwiching a TiO2 photoanode and a counter electrode with an electrolyte in a 25 μm thick spacer. The active area of the cell was 0.25 cm2.
Characterization
The morphologies of the as-prepared samples were observed with field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL JSM-7800F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, Hitachi H-800). The mapping and the high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of the samples were obtained on a JEOL JEM-2100F. The crystal structure of the samples was collected by using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS D8-Advance) with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5418 Å). The Raman spectra of carbon shells and CoSe2/CS were recorded using a confocal inVia Reflex Raman microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried out using an ESCALAB 250 spectrometer using Al Kα (1486.6 eV) irradiation as the X-ray source.
CV measurement was carried out on an electrochemical workstation (CHI 660E, CH Instruments) with a three-electrode system. The as-prepared catalysts coated on the FTO substrate, saturated calomel electrode (SCE) and graphite rod electrode were used as the working electrode, reference electrode and counter electrode, respectively. The CV curve was recorded in an acetonitrile solution containing LiClO4 (0.1 M), LiI (10 mM), and I2 (1 mM) with a scan rate of 75 mV s−1. The stability of catalysts toward the IRR was evaluated by 100-cycle CV scanning. The symmetrical dummy cells assembled by two identical electrodes and electrolyte were used in the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurement. The working area of the electrode was 0.11 cm2. EIS measurement was conducted on a frequency response analyzer (Solartron SI 1270) and a potentiostat (Solartron 1287) at a bias of 0 V with an amplitude of 10 mV within a frequency range from 0.05 to 10 kHz. The EIS spectra were analyzed using an equivalent circuit model (ZView software). The surface potential of each catalyst was measured using a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM, Asylum Research MFP-3D Infinity), and KPFM was conducted under an ambient atmosphere. The Au electrode was used as the reference electrode. The photovoltaic parameters of the DSC devices were measured using a digital source meter (2420, Keithley Instruments, USA) with an Oriel Newport solar simulator equipped with a 150 W xenon lamp (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm−2). The light intensity was calibrated with a standard Si reference cell (Oriel PN 91150 V).
Results and discussion
The synthesis of CoSe2/CS nanostructures combines simple emulsion polymerization, coating, calcination, and selenization processes, as illustrated in Scheme 1. Uniform PS soft templates with controllable sizes were first prepared by emulsifier-free emulsion polymerization using APS as the anionic initiator. The as-obtained PS sphere possessed the negative-charge surface. Then, the PS nanospheres were dispersed in dopamine (DA) solution for coating the poly-dopamine (PDA) layer by base-catalyzed polymerization. After PDA coating for a while (about 30 min), Co2+ aqueous solution was then added. The Co2+ ions were well loaded and distributed within the PDA layer through the strong chemical affinity between the Co2+ ions and nitrogen atoms contained in the PDA layer.35 The successful coating of the PDA shell on the PS spheres is due to the electrostatic interactions between the anionic PS sphere core and cationic PDA shell. Afterwards, the samples were sintered at a certain temperature under an inert atmosphere. During calcination, the PS core could be decomposed at 800 °C, and Co2+ ions could be oxidized to CoOx, while PDA shells can shrink and convert to carbon shells, producing CoOx/carbon hollow spheres. Finally, the hollow spheres react with enough Se powder at the temperature of 450 °C, yielding CoSe2/C hollow spheres with CoSe2 nanoparticles embedded within the carbon shells. The thickness of the carbon shell could be simply controlled by varying the coating time and the concentration of DA. Additionally, the loading amount of CoSe2 nanoparticles is dependent on the concentration of Co2+ added into the DA solution during the synthesis. The above-mentioned emulsion polymerization, PDA coating and calcination processes are simple, low-cost, flexible and highly reproducible.

Fig. 1a shows the representative TEM image of CoOx/CS nanostructures. The thickness of the carbon shell was about 20 nm. Numerous CoOx NPs were observed and embedded in the porous carbon shells. The carbon shell was derived from the carbonization of the PDA layer. The layer could shrink, promoting the partial embedment of CoOx nanoparticles into the carbon shells, and enhancing their stability against de-attachment. As shown in Fig. 1d, the corresponding SEM images revealed that relatively high density CoOx NPs were also anchored on the outer surfaces of the carbon shell. They also confirmed that the uniformity and spherical morphology were well preserved during the coating and carbonization steps. With the following selenization process, the CoOx nanoparticles reacted with Se powder and converted to CoSe2 NPs.36 As shown in Fig. 1b and e, the uniformity and spherical morphology were still maintained well even after the selenization process. Some large sized nanoparticles are found in Fig. 1b. This was due to the movement of nanoparticles especially during thermal calcination. The embedded and anchored CoSe2 nanoparticles will contribute to the catalytic activities. For comparison, blank hollow carbon spheres were also prepared, employing PDA coating and carbonization processes. TEM images revealed that the temperature of carbonization influenced largely the morphologies of samples. With the carbonization temperature of 800 °C, deformed hollow spheres and some carbon sheets were found (Fig. S1†). When the temperature decreased to 500 °C, the spherical morphology was obtained with a good uniformity (Fig. 1c and f). The results implied that the CoSe2 NPs were successfully embedded into the carbon shells, and on the other hand, the as-embedded CoSe2 NPs can strengthen the carbon shells and thus help them retain their spherical morphologies. Additionally, the thickness of the carbon shell in CoSe2/CS could be easily tuned by varying the coating time during the synthesis, as shown in Fig. S2.† To obtain a satisfactory spherical morphology, the optimized thickness of the shell was about 20 nm at the deposition time of 36 hours. The loading amounts of CoSe2 NPs prepared at concentrations of 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mmol were 2.2, 3.1 and 4.2 wt%, respectively.

The changes in the crystal structure of the samples during each step were checked with XRD and HRTEM. Compared with the blank CS sample, the newly formed sharp peaks at 36.5°, 42.4°, 61.5°, 31.3°, and 36.9° could be ascribed to the diffraction of CoOx (JCPDS PDF#43-1004) and Co3O4 (JCPDS PDF#42-1467), respectively.37,38 Meanwhile, no signals for Co, Co(NO3)2 and other impurities were found in the XRD patterns. These results demonstrated that the Co2+ ions were converted into CoOx during the carbonization step. Upon the following selenization treatment, three new peaks at 34.2°, 37.6° and 50.0° were observed and can be well indexed to (210), (211) and (311) of cubic CoSe2 (JCPDS PDF#09-0234),36,39 while patterns originating from CoOx nanoparticles disappeared. The results indicated that the CoOx nanoparticles were successfully converted to CoSe2 NPs using enough Se powder in the synthesis. Additionally, the crystal structure of CoSe2 on carbon shells was also characterized with HRTEM. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, clear lattice fringes were found and indicated a high crystallinity. Moreover, the lattice space was calculated to be about 0.239 nm, corresponding to the (211) crystal plane of the cubic CoSe2.36,39 Therefore, the results of HRTEM and XRD confirmed the successful conversion of CoOx to CoSe2 NPs. The selenization treatment could enhance the catalytic activity of catalysts towards the I3− reduction reaction.36 In our study, the CoOx nanoparticles were converted into cubic CoSe2 nanoparticles, aiming to obtain a high-performance catalyst. Furthermore, the distribution of catalysts (CoSe2) within the carbon shells was characterized via TEM and elemental mapping analysis. The elements C, Co and Se could be clearly observed in the CoSe2/CS sample (Fig. 3c–g). The C element presented a hollow sphere (Fig. 3g), and the nanoparticles anchored on the carbon shell mainly consisted of Co and Se elements (Fig. 3d–f). Meanwhile, the CoSe2 NPs were surrounded by the C element.
The samples were further studied with Raman spectra. As shown in Fig. 2b, two characteristic peaks centered at 1350 and 1600 cm−1 were observed for both blank CS and CoSe2/CS catalysts. The two peaks could be attributed to the disordered sp3 carbon (D-band) and graphite sp2 carbon (G-band), respectively.40,41ID/IG is a key parameter to estimate the catalytic performance of catalysts.5 Obviously, the CoSe2/CS catalyst showed a higher value (0.947) of ID/IG compared to the CS catalyst (0.886), indicating that more defects were embedded in CoSe2/CS catalysts. The existence state of the nitrogen element in the carbon shell and surface electron states of CoSe2 were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). As shown in Fig. S3,† C, N, O, Se and Co elements were detected in the as-prepared CoSe2/CS catalyst. High resolution XPS spectra of N 1s, C 1s, Co 2p and Se 3d in the CoSe2/CS catalyst are shown in Fig. 4. The peaks of N 1s in Fig. 4b could be divided into three peaks, located at the binding energies of 398.6, 401.0 and 402.9 eV, corresponding to the pyrrolic-N, graphitic-N and pyridine-N-oxide groups, respectively.36,42 Meanwhile, the C 1s spectra could be fitted well with three peaks located at 284.7 (C–C/CC), 285.1 (CN–C) and 286.6 eV (C–O).42,43 The existence of pyridine-N and C–N bonds, revealed in N 1s and C 1s spectra, indicated that the carbon shell was doped by the nitrogen element. Noticeably, the peaks at binding energies of 780.6 and 781.9 eV, 796.6 and 798.1 eV, and 785.4 and 802.4 eV can be associated with the characteristic signals of Co 2p3/2, Co 2p1/2, and their satellite peaks, respectively.40 The satellite peaks at 796.6 and 798.1 eV implied the presence of the Co–Co bond.40 The other two peaks at 780.6 and 781.9 eV were related to the Se–Co–Se and Co–O bonds. In addition, two peaks located at 55.6 and 56.4 eV are observed in the Se 3d spectra, corresponding to Se 3d5/2 and Se 3d3/2, which could be assigned to Co–Se and Se–Se bonds, respectively.36,44 Meanwhile, the satellite peak at 59.0 eV is attributed to Se–O bonding at the surface of the catalyst.44 More importantly, no obvious peaks from cobalt oxides were detected, implying the full conversion of cobalt oxides to cobalt selenides. These results further confirmed the formation of CoSe2 NPs anchored and embedded within the nitrogen-doped carbon shells, and are in good agreement with the results of the aforementioned TEM and XRD characterization.

The catalytic activity of the CS and CoSe2/CS catalysts towards the IRR was firstly evaluated with cyclic voltammetry (CV), in comparison with that of the thermally-deposited Pt electrode.32,45 Typical CV curves for various electrodes are shown in Fig. 5a. Two pairs of oxidation/reduction peaks are present for CoSe2/CS-2 and Pt electrodes; however, only one pair of oxidation/reduction peaks is observed in the case of the CS electrode within the scanning potential range. The negative pair of peaks is ascribed to the reduction of I3− to I− and oxidation of I− to I3− processes. The reduction peak is the analysis focus of CV measurement. This is because the I3− ions must be effectively reduced to I− ions on the counter electrode during the operation of DSCs.6,12 Obviously, the potential (EC) and current density (JC) of cathodic peak in the case of the CS electrode indicate that the CS showed poor catalytic performance towards I3− reduction. As expected, the as-designed CoSe2/CS-2 sample displayed a CV curve similar to that of Pt, and demonstrated good catalytic activity due to the embedment of CoSe2 NPs within the carbon shells. Its EC was very close to that of the Pt electrode, while JC was much larger than that of the Pt electrode. The large JC is desirable for counter electrodes, which could result in the large photocurrent density of DSCs. The increase in JC could be attributed to the much more catalytic sites provided by CoSe2/CS catalysts. The results imply that the as-developed CoSe2/CS catalyst could effectively catalyze the I3−/I− redox couple, which could be comparable to the metal Pt. In addition, the electrochemical stabilities of the two electrodes towards the I3− reduction reaction were also evaluated using the CV test with 100 cycles. The corresponding changes in JC and JA for the two electrodes are summarized in Fig. 5b. The final JC and JA of the Pt electrode maintained 81% and 86% of the initial values, respectively, whereas in the case of the CoSe2/CS-based electrode, the final values for JC and JA remained about 99% and 97% of the initial values, respectively. Furthermore, the CoSe2/CS-2 sample after the CV test was also characterized with SEM. The corresponding SEM images are shown in Fig. S4.† Compared with the SEM images of the sample prior to the CV test, no observable changes could be observed in the morphology. Consequently, all results demonstrate that the as-prepared CoSe2/CS presented a super electrochemical stability towards the I3−/I− based electrolyte, surpassing that of the Pt electrode. The outstanding stability could be attributed to the core–shell analogous structures as well as the CoSe2 catalysts embedded by the N-doped carbon shells.

Moreover, the electrocatalytic activity of the various catalysts towards the IRR was also evaluated with EIS, conducting on a symmetric sandwich device configuration with two identical electrodes.46 EIS will provide the intrinsic interfacial charge transfer and charge transport kinetics at the interfaces.46–48 The corresponding Nyquist plots for three electrodes are shown in Fig. 5c. Two arcs are present for the three electrodes. The Nyquist plots were fitted well using the equivalent circuit shown in the inset of Fig. 5c, with the solid curves representing the fitted data. The fitted values of the charge transfer resistance (RCT) for CS, CoSe2/CS and Pt electrodes are 0.36, 0.22, and 0.18 Ω cm2, respectively. Apparently, the CS catalyst presented the largest RCT. However, after embedding CoSe2 NPs within the carbon shells, the RCT decreased to 0.22 Ω cm2, very close to that of the Pt electrode (0.18 Ω cm2). The enhancement in catalytic performance could stem from the intrinsic activity of CoSe2 NPs. More importantly, these RCT values are dramatically smaller than 10 Ω cm2, which is needed for the highly-efficient catalysts used in DSCs.9,16 Consequently, the results demonstrated that the catalytic performance of the as-designed CoSe2/CS is comparable to that of the Pt-based electrode towards I3− reduction, and the CoSe2/CS catalysts could be used as efficient counter electrodes in DSCs.
Encouraged by the above-mentioned CV and EIS results, the as-prepared CoSe2/CS electrodes with different loading amounts of CoSe2 NPs were utilized as CEs in DSCs. The optimal thickness of the CoSe2/CS film was about 11.2 μm (Fig. S6†). The typical photo-current density vs. voltage characteristic plots (J–V) for those devices are shown in Fig. 5d, with corresponding photovoltaic parameters summarized in Table 1. It is clearly found that the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices is related largely to the CEs fabricated in the device. The blank CS electrode-based device showed the lowest PCE of 4.24%, with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.680 V, a short-circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 14.42 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.433. Initially, the PCE of the device increased with the loading amounts of CoSe2. The initial increase in photovoltaic performance with increasing CoSe2 NPs could be due to the increased active sites for triiodide reduction, provided by the CoSe2 NPs, which will promote the charge transfer at the electrolyte/electrode interface. When the loading amount was over 3.1 wt%, the efficiency declined to 7.18%. The overloaded CoSe2 nanoparticles on carbon shells could lead to the decrease of PCE. This may be due to the collapse of the CoSe2/CS nanostructures, as shown in Fig. S5.† Consequently, the CoSe2/CS electrode presented the highest PCE of 7.56% at the loading amount of 3.1 wt%, with a Voc of 0.690 V, a Jsc of 15.88 mA cm−2, and a FF of 0.69. The optimized PCE of the device with CoSe2/CS electrodes is higher than that of the conventional Pt-based device (PCE of 7.40%, Voc of 0.715 V, Jsc of 15.20 mA cm−2 and FF of 0.681). The high PCE of the device stemmed from the large Jsc and FF, compared with other devices. The enhanced FF could be ascribed to the fast mass/electron transfer at the interfaces between the electrolyte and CoSe2/CS, revealed by EIS measurement. The corresponding changes in Jsc may result from the high catalytic performance of each catalyst, in good agreement with the results of CV measurements.

Obviously, the catalytic activity and photovoltaic efficiency dramatically increased after the embedment of CoSe2 NPs within the carbon shells, compared with blank CS. To clarify this, the surface potential of CoSe2/CS and CS catalysts was further measured using a Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM).49–51 The surface potential of the catalyst could provide information about the electron transport processes between the I3−/I− redox couple and catalysts on the counter electrode in the device.4,50 As shown in Fig. 6a, the CoSe2/CS catalyst had a surface potential of −5.02 eV, higher than that of the blank CS sample (−5.17 eV). The change in surface potential may result from the embedment of CoSe2 nanoparticles within the carbon shells. Consequently, compared with blank CS, the CoSe2/CS hybrid matches well the potential of the redox couple (I3−/I−, −4.90 eV), as shown in Fig. 6b. In general, a suitable surface potential could lead to a moderate energy level matching, which will contribute fast electron transfer across the interfaces between the catalyst and the I3−/I− redox shuttle in the electrolyte.4 This meant that the DSC based on CoSe2/CS CE presented a higher efficiency than that of the CS-based device. These results indicate that the CoSe2/CS composite is one of the promising alternative catalyst materials used in the counter electrode for high-performance DSCs.

Conclusions
In conclusion, CoSe2/CS composites were successfully synthesized via the combination of emulsion polymerization, PDA coating and annealing processes. The as-obtained CoSe2/CS composites, in which CoSe2 NPs were embedded well within the N-doped carbon shells, presented high efficiency and good long-term stability, compared with the Pt electrode. The enhanced catalytic performance and photovoltaic efficiency could be attributed to the synergism of CoSe2 NPs and N-doped carbon matrix. The results demonstrate that the as-designed CoSe2/CS composite can be a promising alternative as a Pt-free catalyst for high-performance DSCs. Moreover, the as-reported fabrication method will guide further developments in highly efficient carbon-based catalysts for electrochemistry and energy related applications.
