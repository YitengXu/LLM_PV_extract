    , Accepted 8th May 2018First published on 11th May 2018AbstractTin-doped indium oxide (ITO) transparent conducting electrodes are widely used across the display industry, and are currently the cornerstone of photovoltaic device developments, taking a substantial share in the manufacturing cost of large-area modules. However, cost and supply considerations are set to limit the extensive use of indium for optoelectronic device applications and, in turn, alternative transparent conducting oxide (TCO) materials are required. In this report, we show that aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films grown by atomic layer deposition (ALD) are sufficiently conductive and transparent to outperform ITO as the cathode in inverted polymer solar cells. Reference polymer solar cells made with atomic-layer-deposited AZO cathodes, PCE10 as the polymer donor and PC71BM as the fullerene acceptor (model systems), reach power conversion efficiencies of ca. 10% (compared to ca. 9% with ITO-coated glass), without compromising other figures of merit. These ALD-grown AZO electrodes are promising for a wide range of optoelectronic device applications relying on TCOs.
Introduction
Tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) is a composite of indium oxide (In2O3) and tin oxide (SnO2), usually obtained in a 9:1 atomic ratio.1,2 It is currently widely used in both research laboratories and in the display industry because of its notable optical transparency (as high as 90% transmittance) and low resistivity (commonly up to ca. 1.8 × 10−4 Ω cm).1–3 In particular, ITO meets the requirements as an electrode material for light emitting displays, thin-film photovoltaics, sensors and photodetectors, and remains a benchmark for optoelectronic device applications in spite of the costs associated with the use of indium in the ternary oxide. The limited natural abundance of indium and its cost are the primary limiting factors driving the research on alternative transparent conductive oxides (TCOs) that could ultimately act as ITO replacements. Of all prospective material candidates for conducting and transparent interlayers, including approaches that rely on carbon nanotubes,4,5 graphene,6,7 silver nanowires,8 and conducting polymers,9,10 metal oxides doped with a ternary element appear to remain the most promising and cost-effective avenue because of their concurrently high achievable transparency, conductivity and durability.2,11,12 Aluminum-doped zinc oxide (AZO) thin films grown by various synthetic methods, such as magnetron sputtering,3,13,14 plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition,15 pulsed laser deposition,16 and sol–gel17 routes commonly meet the transparency and stability requirements; the high sheet resistance of the corresponding films (ca. 150 nm; >75 ohm sq−1) has however lagged behind that of ITO (10–15 ohm sq−1). In turn, AZO is currently being used as an interlayer facilitating electron extraction/collection in optoelectronic devices, including polymer solar cells and their hybrid tandems with inorganic photovoltaics, not as a conducting electrode – ITO systematically outperforming AZO in this role.
In recent years, the growth of thin films of oxides by atomic layer deposition (ALD) has become a very effective approach to achieve oxide-based thin-film transistors and p–n junctions with state-of-the-art figures of merit.18–20 In general, ALD-grown oxide deposition strategies have the benefit of producing (i) conformable, uniform layers over a wide range of substrate types and geometries, (ii) films with very low concentrations of defects compared to other deposition methods, and (iii) oxide layers grown at relatively low growth temperatures that are compatible with polymeric flexible substrates. In this contribution, we demonstrate that high-quality AZO thin-film electrodes with high conductivity and transparency can be deposited by ALD at low temperatures. Furthermore, we show that tuning the aluminum dopant concentration, the process temperature, and the thickness of the layers can yield TCO electrodes with work-functions (4.48–4.65 eV) and visible-range transparencies (380–900 nm) comparable to those of sputtered ITO. In polymer solar cells (inverted configuration with PCE10 as the polymer donor and PC71BM as the fullerene acceptor; see Fig. 2) used as model devices for our demonstration, atomic-layer-deposited AZO cathodes with a sheet resistance (RS) of 16.0 ohm sq−1 outperform ITO, and yield higher photocurrents and power conversion efficiencies of ca. 10% (compared to ca. 9% with ITO-coated glass). Our systematic examinations and comparison of the charge-carrier dynamics, inferred from incident light intensity dependence measurements on the current–voltage (J–V) device characteristics, and by transient photovoltage/photocurrent analyses, show that replacing ITO by ALD-grown AZO does not cause further recombination losses at the active layer–electrode interfaces. In parallel, AZO cathodes are found to enhance the photon absorption per volume (G; 1.25 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for AZO devices vs. 1.00 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for ITO devices, as will be discussed in later sections), while allowing for better charge generation and extraction, thus explaining the JSC and PCE improvements observed. This work therefore shows that ALD-grown AZO electrodes are promising candidates for a wide range of optoelectronic device applications relying on TCOs.

Results and discussion
AZO film deposition by ALD
AZO films were deposited on glass substrates following an ALD protocol described in previous work.19 A schematic of the ALD deposition process is depicted in Fig. S1.† Trimethyl aluminum (TMA) and diethyl zinc (DEZ) were used as sources for Al and Zn, and deionized water was used as the oxidant. The AZO film was obtained by the sequential deposition of ZnO and Al2O3, which react to form AZO during the growth process. Fig. S1b† shows a schematic of the deposition process of individual Zn–O (DEZ cycle) and Al–O (TMA cycle) layers, while Fig. S1c† illustrates the deposition of multilayers of ZnO and Al2O3 to obtain AZO films. The Al doping level can be controlled by adjusting the cycle number of DEZ vs. TMA precursors (DEZ/TMA ratio). In this work, the DEZ/TMA ratios were tuned from 100:0 (neat ZnO film) to 5:1.
AZO film characterization
In the optimization of AZO film depositions for use as polymer solar cell (PSC) electrodes, a trade-off between the sheet resistance (RS) and the transmittance of the films must be found. The resistivity (ρ) and RS of the AZO layers were optimized by taking into account several parameters: DEZ/TMA ratio, growth temperature, and film thickness. Tables S1–S3† provide the details of our experimental examinations. Fig. 1a shows the variations of ρ with the DEZ/TMA ratios (established from Table S1†), and indicates that the lowest ρ value of 1.2 × 10−3 ohm cm−1 can be attained at a DEZ/TMA ratio of 20:1 (a film that we henceforth refer to as “20:1 AZO”). The work-function (Φ) values for these AZO films range from 4.48 to 4.65 eV (Fig. 1a and S2†). In parallel, Fig. 1b shows that “20:1 AZO” films yield the highest carrier density (n) value of ∼4.45 × 1020 cm−3. The n values increase with TMA cycles because additional electrons are introduced into the AZO lattice upon substituting Al3+ on the Zn2+ lattice site. The n value reaches a maximum then starts to decrease, a behavior that can be attributed to dopant clustering, which has been previously observed.21,22Fig. 1b also indicates that the electron Hall mobility of the films decreases monotonically with increasing numbers of TMA cycles. The changes in the carrier concentration and mobility of AZO can be understood with the help of Fig. 1c. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern shows that the ZnO films are c-axis oriented as indicated by the dominance of the (002) peaks. All peaks shift to higher diffraction angles with decreasing number of DEZ cycles (100 to 5 DEZ cycles), indicating a reduction in the size of the ZnO unit cell. This is probably due to the substitution of smaller ionic radius Al3+ (0.39 Å) for Zn2+ (0.6 Å). However, further increasing the ratio of TMA/DEZ increases the amount of Al2O3 in the film relative to ZnO, and the number of free Al atoms (not bonded to oxygen) that can substitutionally replace Zn. At some point, we may exceed the limit of Al dopants that the ZnO lattice can accommodate. Beyond this limit, Al atom clustering starts to occur, and the proportion of amorphous Al2O3 in the film increases, thereby reducing the crystallinity of the lattice to the point where no characteristic diffraction peaks are observed (amorphous films). Fig. S4† shows that upon Al dopant incorporation, the optical bandgap of ALD-grown AZO films increases, which can be explained by the Burstein–Moss effect.23 Fig. S5† describes the ALD process temperature optimization, with AZO films grown at 160, 200, and 250 °C (experimental details are provided in Table S2†). The lowest ρ value of 1.1 × 10−3 ohm cm−1 is attained for films grown at 200 °C (Fig. S5a†). Interestingly, the AZO layers grown at 160 °C show a (100)-oriented crystal structure, while an evident (101) peak is observed in layers grown at 250 °C, both of which are distinct from the desired c-orientation achieved in AZO films grown at 200 °C (Fig. S5b†). The low ρ value of the layer grown at 200 °C can be correlated with the favorable c-orientation: noting that in-plane electron transport is impeded by scattering centers induced from the arrangement of atoms in the (100)-orientation (layers grown at 160 °C) or from the presence of (101) planes (layers grown at 250 °C). Last, the thickness of the AZO films grown by ALD was optimized to reduce RS, with the underlying aim of maximizing the open-circuit voltage (VOC; i.e. minimizing recombination loss channels at the active layer–electrode interface) and the fill-factor (FF) in actual polymer solar cells.24 From AZO films grown with 900, 1800, and 2700 DEZ cycles (thickness values are provided in Table S3†), the lowest RS value of 16.0 ± 0.1 ohm sq−1 can be achieved for AZO layers grown with 2700 DEZ cycles, corresponding to a ρ value of 8.25 × 10−4 ohm cm−1 (Fig. 1d). All of the AZO films grown under these conditions followed the same favorable c-orientation pattern (Fig. 1e), along with sufficient transmittance (>88% at 550 nm; similar to ITO) in the visible range (Fig. 1f). As shown in Fig. S6,† the film thickness increased linearly with ALD cycle number, indicating self-limiting film growth. Overall, increasing layer thickness did not affect the work-function, nor did it influence the extent of the optical bandgap (Fig. S6†). The Al composition of the ALD-grown AZO layers obtained from 2700 DEZ cycles was measured to be 3.9 at% by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Fig. S8†). If not otherwise mentioned, AZO electrodes made from the following “optimum” ALD-growth protocol and material characteristics will be used throughout the next sections of this study – deposition: “20:1” AZO/135 TMA cycles/2700 DEZ cycles/substrate temperature: 200 °C/AZO thickness: 520 nm/sheet resistance: 16 ohm sq−1.
Fabrication and characterization of polymer solar cells (PSCs)
The AZO electrodes were patterned by wet etching, using diluted HCl as an etching reagent (HCl:H2O = 1.25:100 v/v). The AZO and ITO electrode areas and thicknesses were carefully measured by profilometry prior to the fabrication of PSC devices (Fig. S9†). Fig. 2a shows the PSC device schematics; device area: 0.1 cm2, defined by the overlapping Ag and AZO electrodes (delimitated by the dashed line). The polymer donor PCE10 and the fullerene acceptor PC71BM were used as model systems for the PSC device fabrication (Fig. 2b and c; corresponding absorption spectra in Fig. 2d). PSC devices with an inverted device configuration were adopted for the demonstration; including ZnO25 as the electron transport layer (ETL), MoO3 as the hole transport layer (HTL), and Ag as the top electrode (Fig. 2a). Fig. 2e provides the schematic energy diagram relative to the PSC device and accounts for each layer in the stack. Reference devices with ITO cathodes and the same PCE10:PC71BM active layer were fabricated for systematic comparison with the AZO-based PSC device counterparts.
The active layers were cast from chlorobenzene (CB), with 3 vol% of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO), and an optimum donor and acceptor blend ratio of 1:1.5 (wt/wt); the optimized protocol is described in previous work26 (cf. details in the method section; active layer thickness: (avg.) 100 nm). Fig. 3a shows the J–V characteristics of the PSC devices fabricated with either ITO or AZO as the bottom electrodes (cathodes), in the dark and under AM1.5G solar illumination (100 mW cm−2). As shown in Table 1, the reference ITO-based PSC devices achieved PCE values of ca. 9.2% (max. 9.3%), FF values of ca. 70%, a VOC of ca. 0.8 V, and JSC values of ca. 16.5 mA cm−2 (cf. device statistics in Table S4†). In comparison, AZO-based PSC devices reached higher PCE values of ca. 10.0% (max. 10.1%), FF values of ca. 67%, a VOC of ca. 0.8 V, and notably higher JSC values of ca. 18.7 mA cm−2. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of the corresponding devices are compared in Fig. 3d, noting that the agreement between integrated EQE and JSC values inferred from the J–V characteristics (±0.8 mA cm−2; ±5%) was consistent comparing ITO- and AZO-based PSC devices. Fig. 3b confirms that the J–V characteristics of AZO-based PSC devices overlap upon forward and reverse biases, reflecting the absence of hysteresis. Fig. 3c shows that the J–V characteristics of AZO-based PSC devices remain unchanged with illumination time, indicating that “light-soaking” effects27 do not affect device operation. Often times, light-soaking effects arise from the presence of residual oxygen introduced in the ETL deposition step (e.g. TiOx (ref. 28) and polyelectrolytes29). The broad photoresponses from 300 nm to ca. 800 nm depicted in Fig. 3d point to three notable differences between the EQE spectra of ITO- and AZO-based PSC devices: (i) in the wavelength range 300–380 nm, ITO-based devices have a more effective EQE footprint than AZO-based PSCs, as AZO layers possess more parasitic absorption in the UV region (Fig. 1f); (ii) in the range 420–565 nm, AZO-based devices show more prominent interference features and a more effective EQE response than ITO-based PSCs; (iii) in the range 640–730 nm, the EQE spectrum of AZO-based devices peaks at ca. 83%, representing a 10% increase over that of ITO-based PSCs (detailed in later sections). It is however worth noting that the non-negligible UV absorption of AZO layers below 400 nm filters off wavelengths that are typically considered as potentially damaging to the active layer in PSCs. Light propagation and interference patterns in PSC devices can be examined by optical simulations using transfer matrix modeling (TMM) approaches; the refractive index n and extinction coefficient k of each layer in the device stack must then be determined from a combination of ellipsometry and UV-Vis spectrometry measurements (using an integrating sphere; cf. experimental details in the ESI†). Fig. 3e and f show the simulated depth-profile optical field distribution across the ITO and AZO-based PSC devices, respectively. The variations in optical field distribution across PSC devices typically impact the spectral absorption by the active layer; here, the simulations show that the optical field pattern that reaches the active layers in ITO- and AZO-based devices falls in the wavelength range 350–700 nm. Importantly, the interference pattern in the wavelength range 350–550 nm is more pronounced in AZO-based devices (for optimized AZO films of 520 nm thickness) compared with ITO-based devices (for optimized ITO films of 130 nm thickness) because of the difference in optical spacing width between ITO and AZO layers (cf. additional simulation data for ITO- and AZO-based PSC devices with different electrode layer thicknesses in the ESI, Fig. S10†). Further, we note that the more pronounced interference pattern in AZO-based PSCs coincides with the stronger interference features observed in the EQE of the device in the range 420–565 nm (Fig. 3f). The maximum theoretical JSC of ITO and AZO-based devices can also be inferred from TM modeling, thus taking into account the interference patterns shown in Fig. 3e and f. From these simulations, the maximum JSC values of ITO- and AZO-based devices are predicted to be of comparable magnitude (19.9 and 19.2 mA cm−2 for ITO and AZO, respectively), suggesting that the higher experimental JSC observed for AZO-based PSCs does not stem from differences in interference effects. Further examinations are required to explain the JSC increase observed in AZO-based devices (detailed in the next section).

Carrier dynamics and extraction in the PSCs
Device performance, the absence of hysteresis and “light-soaking” effects, and optical interference patterns across the AZO- and ITO-based PSC devices were detailed in prior sections. We now turn to the examination of the carrier recombination patterns in the PSC devices. To this end, we performed incident light intensity dependence measurements, considering the variations in both J–V characteristics and in transient photocurrent upon illumination. Fig. 4a and b provide the J–V characteristics as a function of incident light intensity for ITO- and AZO-based devices, respectively, and allow for a systematic look at the variations in JSC and VOC with light intensity. A power law dependence of JSC on incident light intensity (I) prevails in PSC devices and can be described as JSC ∝ Iα based on prior studies.30–32 The power factor α equal to 1 is indicative of efficient carrier extraction prior to their recombination under short circuit conditions. In Fig. 4c, the dependence of JSC on light intensity is plotted in a log–log scale and fitted to a power law (solid lines). In both ITO- and AZO-based devices, the fitted power factor α is estimated as ca. 0.99, indicating that charge carriers are efficiently extracted across both device configurations. In parallel, Fig. 4d shows the variation of VOCvs. light intensity in a natural log scale, with data fitted to , where k, T, and q are the Boltzmann constant, temperature in Kelvin, and the elementary charge, respectively. The parameter n (usually in the range of 1 to 2) reflects the presence/absence of carrier traps across the active layers or at interfaces with the electrodes.32 Any deviations from n = 1 (trap-free condition) point to the existence of recombination effects and, more specifically, to the existence of trap-assisted recombination. As emphasized in Fig. 4d, n = 1.11 and 1.16 were inferred from our analyses of the ITO- and AZO-based devices, respectively, implying that both devices are subject to some extent of trap-assisted recombination at open circuit. Transient photovoltage measurements can provide further details on the recombination effects occurring in PSCs; here, carrier lifetimes can be inferred from the analysis of the voltage decay induced by small light perturbations33 (cf. experimental details in the ESI†). Fig. 4e provides the carrier lifetime estimates as a function of VOC for optimized ITO- and AZO-based PSC devices. As expected, the carrier lifetimes of both device configurations are comparable at all VOC, and under 1 sun conditions (VOC = 0.8 V), carrier lifetimes of 0.89 μs are estimated in both cases. These observations and estimates, including the comparable recombination patterns under short-circuit and open-circuit conditions, indicate that the carrier recombination dynamics are equivalent across the ITO- and AZO-based PSC devices. In other words, replacing ITO by ALD-grown AZO electrodes does not cause further recombination losses at the active layer–electrode interfaces under short circuit and open circuit conditions.

Symbol legend: ITO-based devices () and AZO-based devices (). 
Considering the similar recombination patterns observed in ITO- and AZO-based PSC devices, the notable photocurrent increase described earlier for AZO-based PSCs may stem from differences in charge generation and/or extraction. To probe this assumption, we estimated the photon flux densities absorbed by the PSC devices per unit volume30,34G, assuming that all photogenerated excitons dissociate and contribute to the current generation in the current-saturated regime. The photogenerated current density Jph (shown in ESI Fig. S11†) can be described by Jph = qLGPC, where q is the elementary charge, L is the thickness of the active layer, and PC is the charge collection probability. With the assumption stated above, PC = 1, and the value of G is then described as . The Gmax and Jph. sat. estimated for the AZO-based device are ca. 1.25 × 1027 m−3 s−1 and 19.9 mA cm−2, respectively; values that are larger than those for the reference ITO-based device: ca. 1.00 × 1027 m−3 s−1 and 16.7 mA cm−2, respectively. It is worth noting that the G calculated may deviate from the G integrated from optical simulation which can result from the non-unity internal quantum efficiency and charge losses via charge extraction and collection.
As shown in Fig. 2e, the work functions of ZnO, AZO and ITO are −4.4 eV, −4.6 eV, and −4.8 eV, respectively. We also attribute the increase of the photocurrent to the favorable energy alignment of ZnO and AZO, leading to better charge extraction in the AZO-based device than that of ITO-based devices.35 Carrier extraction across PSC devices can be examined by transient photocurrent (TPC) measurements; here, we examined the turn-on and turn-off dynamics of the ITO- and AZO-based PSCs using long light pulse excitations (200 μs; cf. experimental details in the method section and ESI†), allowing the currents to reach the steady-state condition. We then calculated the densities of extracted charges by integrating the photocurrent curves at each incident light intensity (after the pulses are turned off); the results are provided in Fig. 4f. As expected, the density of charges extracted from the AZO-based device was greater than that from ITO-based devices at all light intensities (Fig. 4f). At 1 sun, the charge density of 8.1 × 1015 cm−3 inferred from AZO-based PSCs scales higher than the value of 6.5 × 1015 cm−3 for the reference ITO-based devices. In particular, when we compared the normalized TPC under 1 sun conditions presented in ESI Fig. S13,† we found that the AZO-based PSCs showed higher current in the time resolved current decay until ca. 220 μs, and then the two devices have the same current decay, indicating that the AZO based device had better charge extraction compared with that of the ITO based device. In summary, AZO- and ITO-based PSC devices have near-identical recombination patterns, but the AZO-based device is able to absorb greater photon densities, leading to larger charge generation yields, while charge carriers are being effectively collected.
PSC device stability examination
To evaluate and compare the stability of the fabricated AZO- and ITO-based PSC devices, we followed the variations of device performance over a two-week period (devices were stored in a N2-filled glovebox under dark conditions; J–V measurements were performed every other day). As demonstrated in Fig. 5, the devices underwent only negligible VOC and JSC variations, while both devices underwent comparable FF reductions with time. Overall, the AZO-based PSC devices retained PCE values of 9.4% (8.7% for the reference ITO-based devices) over the time of our experiments, demonstrating that the ALD-grown AZO electrodes can effectively replace their (sputtered) ITO counterparts in high-efficiency PSCs, and that the new interface of AZO/ZnO does not cause extra degradation of the PSC devices. Based on our examinations, the limited reduction in device FF values observed with time may solely stem from loss channels existing within the photoactive layer (e.g. increased geminate recombination, photobleaching in the presence of residual oxygen, and morphological instabilities36), as opposed to losses pertaining to the electrodes.

Conclusions
In summary, we have shown that ALD-grown AZO cathodes can outperform ITO in inverted polymer solar cells, yielding higher photocurrents and PCEs of ca. 10% (compared to ca. 9% for ITO-based devices). Tuning the aluminum dopant concentration, the substrate temperature during the ALD-growth process, and the electrode layer thickness (via the number of ALD cycles) results in TCO electrodes with work-functions (4.48–4.65 eV), visible-range transparencies (380–900 nm, >88% at 550 nm), and sheet resistances (16 ohm sq−1) comparable to those of sputtered ITO. Further, using (i) systematic examinations and comparison of the charge-carrier dynamics inferred from incident light intensity dependence measurements on J–V device characteristics and (ii) transient photovoltage/photocurrent analyses, we showed that replacing ITO by ALD-grown AZO does not cause further recombination losses at the active layer–electrode interfaces in high-efficiency PSC devices. Overall, AZO-based PSC devices achieve higher photon absorption per volume than their counterparts that use ITO (G; 1.25 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for AZO devices vs. 1.00 × 1027 m−3 s−1 for the reference ITO devices) and possess favorable charge generation and extraction patterns – notable characteristics that translate into higher device JSC and PCEs. Our findings suggest that ALD-grown AZO electrodes are useful for a wide range of optoelectronic device applications that require TCOs.
