    , Accepted 2nd November 2020First published on 3rd November 2020AbstractInorganic perovskites are regarded as “star” semiconductors with unique ferroelectricity due to their superior triboelectric behaviors to those of state-of-the-art dielectric polymers when applied in a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). An in-depth understanding on the charging mechanism of these inorganic halide perovskites may help design a robust TENG platform. Herein, alkali metal ion doped cesium lead tri-bromine Cs1−xAxPbBr3 (A = Li+, Na+, K+, and Ru+, x = 0–1) perovskites are systematically investigated concentrating on their triboelectric behaviors for the first time. The triboelectric charging affinities of these perovskites are ascertained by evaluating the electrical output performances and figures of merit of TENGs based on perovskite/poly(vinylidene fluoride) pairs in vertical contact-separation mode. Finally, a supplemented qualitative triboelectric series including Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites is established regardless of the doping concentration, and can be utilized as a benchmark to guide the future dielectric selection for robust TENGs. This study not only casts light on the determination of an expanded triboelectric series, but also provides new insights into inorganic perovskites in the application of mechanical energy harvesting.
Introduction
Triboelectricity has been well-known for over 2500 years, and spontaneously occurs on the occasion of different materials coming into contact. Since the invention of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) by Wang's group in 2012,1 it has been widely used to harvest low-frequency mechanical energies from oceans,2,3 wind,4,5 and human body motion.6–10 In theory, interactive friction of any different materials can generate triboelectricity, which originates from charge transfer between contacting materials. The direction and magnitude of charge transfer are primarily governed by the charging behaviors of these materials, which can be expected by an empirical “triboelectric series” that established on the basis of material polarity. Generally, larger disparity in the polarity of contacting materials along the triboelectric series may achieve higher triboelectric charge density. Early in 1962, a triboelectric series of a few polymers was proposed by Henniker,11 and this series was further expanded to include synthetic and natural polymers as well as two-dimensional materials.12–14 However, the as-explored triboelectric series is mainly confined to organic polymers, natural fibers, metal/metal oxides and 2D materials; further enrichment of the series library and confirmation of new materials with unknown charging polarity are of great significance toward facilitating the development of TENGs toward multipurpose applications.
Dielectrics are preferred triboelectric materials owing to their long charge maintaining characteristics. As an example of typical piezoelectric and ferroelectric dielectrics, halide perovskites have been widely explored and applied in solar cells, light emitting diodes, electroluminescence, and sensors because of their superior optical and electrical behaviors.15,16 More importantly, the unique dielectric characteristics of halide perovskites make them easy to polarize due to their four sources of electronic, ionic, dipolar, and space charge at different excitation energies, which can be attributed to their non-centrosymmetric structures and the low binding energies of valence electrons.17–19 Thus, halide perovskites are expected to have one order of magnitude higher dielectric constants compared to state-of-the-art polymers commonly used in TENGs such as polytetrafluoroethylene, polyimide, polydimethylsiloxane, polyethylene, etc.18 Previous studies in this field always used organic–inorganic hybrid MAPbX3 perovskites,20–22 but the open-circuit voltage (Voc) at only several volts, the short-circuit current (Isc) in nanoamperes and the intrinsic crystal instability of these hybrid perovskites under moisture, oxygen and/or ultraviolet illumination conditions undoubtedly limited their practical applications. Comparatively, an all-inorganic cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) halide perovskite having brilliant electrical properties presents a stabilized crystal lattice in the ambient atmosphere. Our previous study demonstrates that an all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskite is an excellent dielectric material with superior stable electrical output performance over a 90 day test, and remarkable reversibility and adaptability toward temperature and humidity variations.23 Moreover, alkaline earth ion doped CsPbBr3 perovskites have shown tremendous changes in the work function and dielectric properties, and thus triboelectric outputs with a high Voc of 220 V and Isc of 18.5 μA and a maximum power density of 3.07 W m−2 are achieved by a CsPb0.91Ba0.09Br3 based TENG. Inspired by our previous work, we find that the triboelectric properties of CsPbBr3 perovskites can be adjusted through compositional engineering, which seriously impacts their triboelectric behaviors as well as their electrical output performances.
Apart from Pb-site substitution, the energy level, crystallinity and electrical properties can be easily tuned through substituting the Cs-site with alkali metal ions and changing the size of cubo-octahedral voids and monovalent cations.24,25 An in-depth understanding on the triboelectric behaviors and charging polarities of alkali metal ion doped CsPbBr3 perovskites as well as their positions in the triboelectric series is scientifically significant for applying inorganic halide perovskites toward efficient mechanical energy harvesting. In this regard, Cs1−xAxPbBr3 (A+ = Li+, Na+, K+, and Ru+, x = 0–1) perovskites are systematically investigated concentrating on their triboelectric behaviors tuned by alkali metal ion doping in the form of contact electrification. Herein, the electrical and dielectric properties affected by alkali metal ions are systematically characterized. The difference of the charging polarity of various Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites is confirmed by evaluating the triboelectric output signals and the performance figures of merit (FOMP) of TENGs fabricated with perovskites–poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) pairs. The polarity of these inorganic perovskites compared with familiar polymers is detected based on electron flow analysis upon contact electrification. The characterization of the work function, dielectric properties and simulated potential distributions confirms the triboelectric polarity of inorganic Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites and finally determines the exact positions of the inorganic Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites in the triboelectric series.
Experimental section
Materials and reagents

N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF), methanol, PbBr2, CsBr, LiBr, NaBr, KBr, and RbBr were purchased from Aladdin Reagent (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) was purchased from ANOW Microfiltration Co., Ltd. Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and polyimide (PI) were purchased from Shanghai Huadong Composite Insulated Press Cloth Screen Mesh Factory. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was purchased from YiWei Electromechanical Hardware Co., Ltd. Polyethylene (PE) was purchased from Dongguan Jingtong Aozon Film Co., Ltd. Polycarbonate (PC) was purchased from Jiasida Sunsheet Co., Ltd. Nylon was purchased from Shenzhen Xiangliang film Co., Ltd. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film was synthesized by mixing the two precursors (Sylgard®184, Dow Corning) in a ratio of 1:10 and curing at 60 °C for 4 h. Unless otherwise stated, all starting materials were purchased from commercial suppliers and used as received.
Preparation of inorganic halide perovskites
All-inorganic CsPbBr3 and Cs1−xAxPbBr3 halide perovskite films were deposited on clean FTO glass by a multi-step solution process developed by our group.26 1 mol L−1 PbBr2 solution in DMF was spin-coated on FTO glass at 2000 rpm for 30 s, followed by heat treatment at 100 °C for 30 min. Then, 0.07 mol L−1 CsBr solution in methanol was spin-coated onto the PbBr2 film at 2000 rpm for 30 s and heated at 250 °C for 5 min; the CsBr deposition was repeated several times until the desired perovskite film was obtained. In the case of alkali metal ion (A+) doped halide perovskites, ABr and CsBr were co-dissolved in methanol in a certain stoichiometric range of 0.01–0.20 with a total concentration of 0.07 mol L−1. The film formation procedures were similar to that for the CsPbBr3 perovskite. The active area of perovskite films was controlled at 8.1 cm2. All the procedures were conducted in air by controlling the relative humidity at 28–30%.
Fabrication of perovskite TENGs
The perovskite TENG was fabricated in typical dielectric-on-dielectric vertical contact-separation mode, where the halide perovskite film was a positive triboelectric layer and the PVDF film (3 μm in thickness) was a negative triboelectric layer. The FTO glass served as a support for the halide perovskite film as well as the bottom electrode, while Ag adhesive tape was the top electrode to connect the PVDF film. The TENGs composed of the halide perovskite and other polymers had the same configuration as the perovskite–PVDF TENG by substituting PVDF with other polymers. The active area for the perovskite TENG was 8.1 cm2.
Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer using Cu-Kα radiation (40 kV, and 40 mA). The SEM characterization was carried out on an FEI Apreo LoVac scanning electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron (XPS) spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer RBD upgraded PHI-5000CESCA system with Mg Ka radiation with an hν value of 1253.6 eV. The dielectric constant was assessed with an Agilent LCR meter (4990A) at room temperature within a frequency range of 100–1 MHz. UPS measurements were performed on a ThermoFisher ESCALAB 250Xi. AFM images were obtained with a commercial AFM unit (SPA400-SPI4000, Seiko Instruments Inc., Japan). Electrical analysis was accomplished by applying an external force on the perovskite TENG through a linear motor (LinMot) and carried out by using a Keithley 6514 electrometer (Keithley Instruments). The intrinsic output characteristics for load matching were studied by connecting a simple circuit of a full bridge rectifier to transform alternating signals into direct ones. The simulated potential distribution of perovskite–polymer pairs was calculated through finite-element analysis (FEA) by using COMSOL software.
Results and discussion
The relative polarity deviation of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 halide perovskites can be deduced through comparing their triboelectric output signals in TENGs consisting of various perovskites coupled with dielectric polymers. The doping content of each alkali metal ion is optimized to investigate its impacts on electrical output performances of TENGs as shown in Fig. 1a–d. The optimal doping contents are confirmed to be Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3, Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3, Cs0.90K0.10PbBr3 and Cs0.85Rb0.15PbBr3 (denoted by a red dashed rectangle), and the final compositions determined using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) are nearly equal to the precursor ratio.25 It can be observed that the highest output performance with a Voc of 182 V, Isc of 23 μA and Qsc of 73 nC is achieved by the pristine CsPbBr3 TENG, and enhanced electrical output performances are observed in Na+, K+ and Rb+ ion doped perovskite TENGs with increased doping concentration until achieving their optimal values (ESI Fig. S1†). An output ranking of Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3 < Cs0.85Rb0.15PbBr3 < Cs0.90K0.10PbBr3 < Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3 < CsPbBr3 is obviously obtained by comparing their electrical outputs as shown in Fig. 1e–g. Moreover, the charge affinity of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites and dielectric polymers can be quantified by analyzing their electric current outputs and working mechanism. The configuration of the perovskite TENG is demonstrated in Fig. 1h1, which consists of a top Ag electrode, Cs1−xAxPbBr3/dielectric polymer triboelectric pair and bottom FTO electrode, and the electrical output is measured by connecting the top Ag and bottom FTO electrode to the red and black probe of the electrostatic meter, respectively. The charging polarities of the perovskite and polymer can be ascertained through analyzing the direction of the current signal output and electron transfer. The triboelectricity generation mainly relies on the coupling of contact electrification and electrostatic induction effects,27,28 and the working mechanism can be described using a “press-release” cycle including four consecutive states. Triboelectric charges are generated on the perovskite and polymer counterparts with opposite charges when they come into contact (Fig. 1h2), and a negative current signal Isc of −9.7 μA and transferred charge of −76 nC are generated as the two separate counterparts (Fig. 1h3) and the maximum Voc can be reached when gap distance d becomes d0.29–32 A positive current signal Isc of 23 μA and transferred charges of 80 nC are observed as the counterparts during the “pressing” state (Fig. 1h4). During the “press-release” cycle, the electron transfer direction can be deduced from the current signals, where the positive current signals indicate the electrons transferring from the bottom FTO to the top Ag electrode and vice versa. We further applied the finite element analysis (FEA) software COMSOL Multiphysics to simulate the potential distribution of Cs1−xAxPbBr3/dielectric polymers for the whole “press-release” cycle (Fig. 1i), and the simulated results confirm the charge affinity of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 and dielectric polymers with positive and negative charges after contact electrification, respectively.

The influences of doping contents on electrical outputs are very complicated, since several intrinsic properties of the perovskite can be regulated thus altering the triboelectric charging behaviors of the perovskite TENG; we find out that the surface roughness, electron binding energy and crystal modulation have remarkable impacts on electrical performances. In terms of the morphological aspect, the surface roughness (denoted as the root mean square value, RMS) characterized by AFM measurement exhibited an increasing trend as the doping concentration increased for the same ion group (Fig. 2a1–a4 and ESI Fig. S2†), while the electrical output performances do not match the increasing trend. The RMS value for the optimal doping concentration of each doping ion follows the order of Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3 < Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3 < Cs0.85Rb0.15PbBr3 < Cs0.90K0.10PbBr3 (Fig. 2b and ESI Table S1†), which is partially consistent with the electrical output performance ranking except for the Na+ ion doped perovskite TENG. Generally, the triboelectric charge density is the most significant impact factor which can be improved by enhancing the effective contact area (surface roughness). Decreasing trends of output performances were observed in Cs1−xAxPbBr3 TENGs as the doping concentration further increased above the optimal concentration, which can be attributed to the enhanced electron binding energy and the destruction of the perovskite phase with excess alkali metal cations.25 It is noteworthy that a decreasing trend is observed of Cs1−xLixPbBr3 TENGs by improving the doping concentration and surface roughness, which is caused by serious crystal contraction and perovskite phase damage through doping ultra-small Li+ cations. Theoretically, the Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskite possesses a three-dimensional structure containing a PbBr6 octahedron centered on Pb2+, while Cs+ and A+ occupy the interspaces of the extensional PbBr6 octahedron with 12-fold coordination as illustrated in the inset of Fig. 2b. The size of A+ cations has a significant impact on the perovskite structure, where an undersized A+ cation may lead to strained and unstable lattice of the 3D orthorhombic perovskite phase. Specifically, the stability of perovskite crystal construction can be evaluated using the tolerance factor (t) according to Goldschmidt's rule, which depends on the ionic radius of Cs+/A+, Pb2+ and Cl− ions.33 The symmetry of the crystal lattice is reduced with the decreasing radius of A+, where a cubic perovskite crystal is shaped at t = 1 and octahedral deformity is predicted with t < 1.34 The crystal structure of the pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite is orthorhombic, and thus the orthorhombic perovskite phase will be destructed upon doping an excess of smaller alkali metal cations. Therefore, the optimal doping content of Li+ cations is very small (molar ratio of 0.01) and further increase the doping content will further degrade the output performances.

In addition, the triboelectric output performances of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 TENGs are all lower than that of the pristine CsPbBr3 device in view of the influences of various doping ions; intriguingly, the triboelectric outputs have peak values for the Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3 device along with the increased atomic number of alkali metal ions. The decreased triboelectric outputs can be speculated from the XRD and XPS results, which reveal the higher binding energies of contracted Cs1−xAxPbBr3 lattices than the pristine CsPbBr3. XRD characterization is performed to define the crystal lattices of inorganic perovskites, as shown in Fig. 2c and ESI Fig. S3.† Three main diffraction peaks centered at 15.2° (100), 21.7° (110) and 26.5° (111) are determined for the CsPbBr3 film, and the slight shifts for Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites with no peaks for impurity phases suggest a pure orthorhombic perovskite phase.26 The peak shift of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites to larger diffraction angles corresponds to lattice shrinkage by inserting smaller radius ions of Li+ (r = 0.76 Å), Na+ (r = 1.02 Å), K+ (r = 1.38 Å), and Rb+ (r = 1.52 Å) than Cs+ (r = 1.67 Å).35 The lattice shrinkage is beneficial for increasing the crystal formation energy and lattice modulation on account of the enhanced interaction within perovskite crystals. The XPS peaks for Cs 3d, Pb 4f, and Br 3d all shift to higher binding energies for Li+, Na+, K+ and Rb+ doped perovskites (Fig. 2d and ESI Fig. S4†), indicating the redistributed electron density and higher valence electron binding energy compared to the pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite.36 The standard electron binding energies of alkali metal ions are reported as Li 1s (54.9 eV),37 Na 1s (1071.7 eV),38 K 2p (292.9 eV),39 and Rb 3d (110.0 eV).39 The XPS spectra of alkali metal ions all shift to higher binding energies upon doping into the perovskite crystal, signifying the difficulty in losing electrons and achieving lower triboelectric charge density. Moreover, the increased crystal formation energy of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites helps grow tiny crystals into larger ones instead of forming a new crystal nucleus due to the thermodynamic stability, causing larger crystal sizes than those of the pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite (ESI Fig. S5†). XRD and XPS characterization experiments both confirm the successful incorporation of alkali metal ions into the CsPbBr3 crystal lattice and reveal the reasons for distinct electrical properties compared with the pristine CsPbBr3 perovskite.
On the other hand, the trend of triboelectric outputs along with the increasing doping atomic number from Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3 to Cs0.85Rb0.15PbBr3 can be attributed to the opposite trend of bond energy formed between doped alkali metal ions and Br− ions in the perovskite crystal lattice, specifically Li–Br (418.8 kJ mol−1), Na–Br (363.1 kJ mol−1), K–Br (379.1 kJ mol−1), and Rb–Br (380.7 kJ mol−1). Theoretically, an electron cloud model can be utilized to explain the interatomic interaction potential between two atoms as demonstrated in Fig. 2f–h. A chemical bond will be formed between two atoms denoted as a, which is an equilibrium distance and called bond length or interatomic distance, indicating the overlap in electron clouds or the wave function (Fig. 2f). If the interatomic distance x is shorter than a, the two atoms tend to repel each other owing to the increased overlap of electron clouds and falling in the repulsive region (Fig. 2g), thus resulting in higher bond energy and more difficulty in losing electrons. Once the interatomic distance x is larger than a, the two atoms tend to attract each other and fall in the attractive region (Fig. 2h), and a weak bond energy could be formed. Generally, a weak bond energy will lead to a weak binding interaction, long bond length, narrow bandgap, and more dispersed electron clouds along the bond rather than localized around the nuclei,40 which would undoubtedly increase the possibility of donating electrons in contact electrification. Hence, the PVDF–Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3 TENG is expected to gain the highest triboelectric output performance among the alkali metal ion doped TENGs due to the weakest binding energy of the Na–Br bond, and the lowest triboelectric output for the PVDF–Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3 TENG is speculated on account of the strongest binding energy of the Li–Br bond.
The performance figure of merit (FOMP) is a universal standard to evaluate the triboelectric performance regardless of the working mode and dimensions of TENGs,41 and it is directly proportional to the greatest possible average output power and related to the highest achievable energy-conversion efficiency that can be utilized to further evaluate the varieties of TENGs. The FOMP for perovskite–PVDF TENGs with certain load resistance can be given by:  where ε0 is the vacuum dielectric constant, E is the output energy per period, A is the triboelectrification area, and xmax is the maximum displacement of a TENG. The output energy is a periodic variate upon a continuous periodic mechanical motion, and the output energy of a certain period is equivalent to the voltage integral of transferred charges.41 Therefore, the voltage–transferred charge (V–Q) plots of the Cs1−xAxPbBr3–PVDF TENGs are measured at an external load resistance of 50 MΩ in series. The load resistance is determined by approximating to the internal impedance of the TENGs, which is measured from the maximum power output point of CsPbBr3–PVDF TENGs according to the maximum power transfer theorem (ESI Fig. S6†).42 The obtained V–Q plots are periodically enclosed circles and one of the circles is exhibited in Fig. 3a–e, where the E value can be represented by the encircled area. Fig. 3f compares the FOMP of Cs1−xAxPbBr3–PVDF TENGs, and the corresponding FOMP data are calculated to be 6.0 × 10−5, 3.6 × 10−5, 5.4 × 10−5, 5.1 × 10−5 and 4.1 × 10−5 μJ m−3 for CsPbBr3, Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3, Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3, Cs0.90K0.10PbBr3 and Cs0.85Rb0.15PbBr3, respectively. The FOMP results demonstrate an increase at first and then a descending trend as the atomic number of dopants increases, which is consistent with their triboelectric output sequence in the order of Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3 > Cs0.85Rb0.15PbBr3 > Cs0.90K0.10PbBr3 > Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3 > CsPbBr3 from negative to positive.

Moreover, we further investigate the impacts of doping alkali metal ions on the electronic and dielectric properties of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites. The work function difference is regarded as the regulation of electron transfer between two triboelectric materials during contact electrification.43 Therefore, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) measurements are carried out to estimate the effective work function (Fermi level) of inorganic halide perovskite films before contact as shown in Fig. 3g and ESI Fig. S7.† The work function difference between the perovskite and PVDF film shows an increasing trend in the order of Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3, Cs0.85Rb0.15PbBr3, Cs0.90K0.10PbBr3, Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3, and CsPbBr3, verifying that the larger work function difference would facilitate the electron hopping from the perovskite to PVDF thus resulting in higher electrical potential output. Moreover, the results show that composition engineering by doping foreign ions is an effective approach to regulate the potential barrier of materials and improve triboelectric charge transfer.
The dielectric behaviors of the Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskite films are determined over a frequency range from 100 to 1000 Hz at room temperature, as plotted in Fig. 3h. Compared to commonly used dielectric materials, an inorganic halide perovskite is expected to possess nearly one order of magnitude higher dielectric constant than dielectric materials, for instance, PTFE with 2.0–2.1, PI with 2.8–3.2, PC with 2.8–3.4, PET with 3–4, mica with 7–9, silicon dioxide with 3.9–4.5, etc.44–46 The dielectric polarization of a halide perovskite are obtained from four sources depending on different energy, including electronic (at the femtosecond level), ionic (at the picosecond level), dipolar (at the nanosecond level), and space charge (at the microsecond to second level) contributions.18,19,47 Space charge polarization is the predominant contribution in a relatively low frequency range, which is attributed to spatial inhomogeneous distribution of charges for an electrostatic potential gradient within the perovskite film. According to the results, the dielectric constants of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites are lower than that of pristine CsPbBr3 in the low frequency range, which suggests the space charge polarization is suppressed through doping alkali metal ions. The restrained space charge polarization of the Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskite causes fewer negative charges along the inner surface of the perovskite film motivated by an external electric field during the contact electrification, thus inducing fewer positive charges on the outer surface of the perovskite film for restrained surface triboelectric charge density. Moreover, the simulated potential distributions of PVDF–Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskite pairs after contact electrification are carried out via COMSOL (ESI, Fig. S8†), and the potential variations of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites agree well with the experimental results and confirm the polarity order of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites. The Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskite TENG exhibits a high stability after continuous operating over 1000 cycles (ESI Fig. S9†) without degradation in the Voc output in the ambient atmosphere, indicating the robustness and mechanical durability of perovskite TENGs in long-term operation.
To quantify the charging polarity and to ascertain the relative positions of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites on the triboelectric series, various commonly used polymers including PTFE, PVDF, PDMS, PE, PC, PET, PI and nylon are selected to pair with the Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskite for a vertical contact-separation TENG. The triboelectric behaviors of the CsPbBr3 perovskite against the selected polymers are illustrated in Fig. 4a, and positive current signals upon pressing and negative current signals upon releasing are observed when brought into contact with PTFE, PDMS, PVDF and PE, indicating the positively charged states of the CsPbBr3 perovskite when brought into contact with these groups of polymers. Inversely, opposite current signal generation trend is observed when it is brought into contact with PC, PET, PI, and nylon, referring to the negatively charged state of the CsPbBr3 perovskite. Therefore, the reverse charging polarity of the CsPbBr3 perovskite reveals that the triboelectric charge affinity of CsPbBr3 locates between that of PE and PC. As shown in Fig. 4b–e, all the triboelectric polarities of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites lie between PE and PC polymers. The polarity sequence of the selected polymers is confirmed by analyzing the electron transfer direction from the triboelectric current signal of each of the two polymers as displayed in ESI Fig. S10,† where the positively charged material after contact electrification ranks on the more positive side and the negatively charged material ranks on the relatively negative side. It is noteworthy the current signals increase along with the increased disparity between the perovskite and various polymers except for PVDF, which might be attributed to the surface properties of PVDF involving surface potential and roughness.14

The relative polarity of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites is ranked by analyzing the electron transfer direction between each pair of perovskites; an order of Cs0.99Li0.01PbBr3 > Cs0.85Rb0.15PbBr3 > Cs0.90K0.10PbBr3 > Cs0.95Na0.05PbBr3 > pristine CsPbBr3 from negative to positive can be obtained as demonstrated in Fig. 5a–l, and the trend can be extended to the same doping group indicating the universality of the polarity sequence of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites regardless of the doping concentration (ESI Fig. S11†). Thus, the positions of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites in the triboelectric series are ascertained according to the polarity deviation. Considering our previous studies regarding perovskite TENGs,48,49 a summary of the triboelectric charging polarities for alkali metal ions, alkaline earth ion dopants and halogen regulated perovskites is given in Fig. 5m and ESI Table S2.† It can be inferred that the triboelectric charging polarity largely depends on the work function difference and contact potential difference;50–52 the higher the work function difference between the semiconductor and insulator, the more positive the charge affinity of the perovskite. Finally, a supplemented qualitative triboelectric series with pristine CsPbBr3, alkali metal ion doped Cs1−xAxPbBr3, alkaline earth ion doped CsPb1−xMxBr3 and CsPbIxCl3−x perovskites is concluded in Fig. 5n.

Conclusions
In summary, the electrical properties of all-inorganic Cs1−xAxPbBr3 halide perovskite TENGs are systematically studied by analyzing the triboelectric behaviors, charging mechanism and triboelectric charging polarities of inorganic Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites. The triboelectric charging polarities of Cs1−xAxPbBr3 perovskites are verified through analyzing their electrical output performances, work function, dielectric properties and FOMP. This investigation methodology can be extended to explore new materials with unknown triboelectric polarity to further expand the triboelectric series. Finally, a supplemented qualitative triboelectric series including pristine CsPbBr3, alkali metal ion doped Cs1−xAxPbBr3, alkaline earth ion doped CsPb1−xMxBr3 and CsPbIxCl3−x perovskites is delivered, and provides new insights into inorganic perovskites toward triboelectric application for mechanical or hybrid energy harvesting as well as self-powered optical sensing.
