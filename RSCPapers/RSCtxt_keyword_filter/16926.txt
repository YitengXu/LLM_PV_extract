        cells are promising green power sources with theoretically zero pollution and broad applications. One of the most important challenges for fuel cells is to have more cost-effective catalysts with high catalytic activity. Nanoscience has stimulated extensive interest in nanostructured catalysts to significantly improve the energy density, power density and operation reliability while greatly reducing the manufacturing expense. In particular, nanostructured materials play a critical role in the catalysis of various innovative fuel cells, which not only possess high specific surface area and good conductivity for low polarization, but also provide unique nanoporous structures and functional chemical properties for highly intrinsic electroactivity and excellent utilization. The recent advances in nanostructured catalysts and supports are reviewed in this article. The relationships between the nanostructures and electrocatalytic performance and the catalysis mechanisms are discussed.Yan QiaoDr Yan Qiao received her PhD in 2010 from the School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.

1 Introduction
The worsening environment and rapidly exhausted natural resources have urged extensive research and development of green and sustainable energy systems,1–3 for which fuel cells offer much promise. However, high energy conversion efficiency and low cost are still essential for fuel cells in practical applications. The main losses of the energy conversion efficiency come from slow electrode kinetics, poor mass transport and high ohmic resistance. The electrode kinetics is a complicated catalytic process involving oxidation or reduction to transfer electrons at an electrode/electrolyte interface. A good electrode material is very critical to make the electrochemical reactions more reversible for faster electron transfer to reduce the activation overpotential. The mass transport loss is mainly caused by concentration polarization, which occurs at relatively high current densities under diffusion control to result in high overpotentials. This is why porous electrodes are used in electrochemical systems to provide high specific surface areas for low apparent current densities.4–8 A delicately fabricated porous electrode with a pore structure and pore distribution beneficial to the mass transport can definitely improve the concentration polarization at a high current density. Ohmic loss is due to resistance of the cell components and interconnects, and good connections and conductive electrode materials can make contributions to the improvement of ohmic loss. Apparently, conductive nanomaterial-based electrodes including catalysts and their supports with a high specific surface area and optimal pore structure could provide solutions to significantly improve energy conversion efficiency.
In comparison to high temperature fuel cells, relatively low temperature fuel cells such as proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are more environmentally friendly and have more practical applications. The hydrogen PEMFC harvests electricity by hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction through a membrane electrode assembly (MEA), but the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the cathode is sluggish and a good electrode catalyst to enhance its reaction rate is critical. In a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) the main energy conversion loss comes from the slow anode reaction and methanol crossover reaction at the cathode. To date platinum (Pt) is still the most dominant catalyst for both anode and cathode in almost all types of fuel cells due to its superior catalytic activity and long term operation stability. However, Pt, a rare and expensive novel metal in nature severely limits the broad applications of fuel cells. Studies have been intensively conducted to significantly reduce Pt loading in electrodes and/or enhance the Pt electrocatalytic efficiency. Alternatively, Pt-free catalysts have been particularly studied to replace Pt. In the past decade, the advances of nanoscience and nanotechnology have opened new ways to develop novel electrocatalysts for fuel cells. In particular, various nanostructured materials such as metallic nanoparticles,9nanorods,10nanowires11–13 and nanoengineered bimetallic/trimetallic catalysts14–17 have been investigated as catalysts or catalyst supports. In comparison to conventional electrocatalysts, the nanostructured counterparts can provide higher catalytic activity and larger active specific surface area or significantly reduce the loading of novel metals such as Pt catalysts.
In recent years biofuel cells (BFCs)18,19 have been explored to have distinct advantages over traditional PEMFCs such as room temperature operation, relatively low cost catalysts and high energy conversion efficiency, thus offering potential applications like power sources for portable devices or home facilities. Various kinds of proteins (enzymes) and microorganisms have been used to catalyze both anodic and cathodic reactions. However, a much lower power density than hydrogen–oxygen fuel cells severely limits BFCs in practical applications, and is mainly caused by the nonconductive biocatalysts, which cannot have a fast interface electron transfer rate. Nanostructured electrode materials have been employed to realize fast direct electron transfer ability of the biocatalysts by their unique physical–chemical properties while providing high apparent power density from a large specific surface area.4,5,20
In this article, recent progress on nanostructured catalysts and catalyst supporting nanomaterials is reviewed. In particular, the relationship between nanostructure and electrocatalysis, and the catalytic mechanisms are discussed.
2 Nanomaterial-based catalysts
2.1 Metal nanoparticles with core–shell structures

          Pt
          nanoparticles are widely used as catalysts in different fuel cells.21 The size, shape and dispersion uniformity of Pt nanoparticles on supporting materials have significant effects on the catalytic activity. The maximum mass activity could be achieved at a particle size (diameter) of 3–4 nm for ORR, while it is 3–10 nm for methanol oxidation.22 Recent studies demonstrate that the Pt nanoparticles with a diameter of 3 nm have better electrochemical stability than those of size 1.8 nm.23 To enhance the mass activity of Pt, the core–shell type of nano-alloy catalysts with a Pt shell have been developed to remarkably reduce Pt loading while enhancing the catalytic performance. Pt based bimetallic and trimetallic catalysts exhibit higher Pt mass activity than pure Pt nanoparticles to reduce the catalyst cost.21 Recent works have discovered24 that the activity and durability of the ORR catalysts can be further enhanced by controlling the core particle composition and tailoring the shape of the Pt shell structure (Fig. 1a). Various metal cores like Co, V, Ni, Cu, Pd, Au, W have been used to prepare Pt alloys.21PtCo, PtNi, PtZn and PtCu display high catalytic activities but often suffer from poor chemical stability in acid electrolytes. PtW, PtTi and PtSe offer modest catalytic activity improvement and good chemical stabilities. To improve the durability of the nanoparticles in strong acid, a new type of Pd/FePt nanoparticles with Pd core and FePt shell has been prepared for ORR (Fig. 1b).25 The highly stable Pd/FePt nanoparticles have no obvious loss of surface area or activity after 10000 potential cycles and deliver current density 12 times higher than the commercial Pt catalysts. The activity and stability of the monolayer Pt shell can be increased by alloying the core metal with Pd. The Pt/Pd3X (X = Co, Fe, Cr, V, Ti, Ir, Re) alloys show enhanced stability of the Pt surface atoms compared to Pt/X alloys.26 Therefore the unique nanostructured and/or alloyed Pt are cost-effective, high performance catalysts for fuel cells.

(Adapted with permission from Ref. 25. Copyright 2010 American Chemical Society). 
Metal nanoparticles can form facets to minimize surface energy and total excess free energy. Pt is usually bound by three low-index planes, namely (100), (110), and (111).9 On different crystal surfaces of Pt the electronic structures and atomic arrangements are quite different, and the appropriate crystal phase and/or composition is able to greatly enhance reaction kinetics. It has been demonstrated that the Pt3Ni(111) surface is 10-fold more active for ORR than Pt(111) surface and 90-fold more active than the current state-of-the-art Pt/C catalysts in PEMFC.27 The different low-index surfaces have markedly high catalytic activity towards the electrode reactions in fuel cells. The relationship between the surface electronic structure and activity for ORR on Pt3M (M = Ni, Co, Fe, Ti, V) catalysts has been investigated,28 showing that the maximum catalytic activity is governed by a balance between adsorption energies of reactive intermediates (O2−, O22−, H2O2etc.) and surface coverage by spectator oxygenated species and specifically adsorbed anions. This indicates that the reaction rate for catalysts with very strong oxygen binding is limited by the rate of removing surface oxides and anions, while for catalysts with very weak oxygen binding, the rate is limited by the rates of electron and proton transfer to adsorbed O2. Recently, shape-controlled Pt3Ni nanopolyhedra terminated with the (111) facet have been reported to improve the catalytic activity towards ORR by 5-fold compared to that of the similar sized Pt3Ni nanocubes terminated with (111) facet.29 More studies about the design and preparation of Pt-based nanoparticles have proposed three growth modes to explain the formation of various heteronanostructures.9
Other metal nanoparticles with core–shell structures also exhibit improved catalytic activity and stability for fuel cell reactions. In an alkaline medium, Ni@Pd core–shell nanoparticles supported on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) increase the electrocatalytic activity and stability considerably towards methanol oxidation compared with that of PdNi/MWCNTs and Pd/MWCNTs.30 A hollow Au/Pd core/shell nanostructure with a raspberry surface possesses superior electrocatalytic properties towards oxidation of methanol, ethanol, and formic acid in alkaline media in comparison with Pd nanoparticles and hollow Au nanospheres.31
Since size, shape, composition and phase properties of the core–shell structured nanoparticles can be controlled much easier than other nanostructured materials, they are the most favorite catalysts for fuel cells. Fundamental studies on the electronic and lattice structures on the surface of these nanoparticles as well as their characteristics like lattice shrinking and d-band vacancy can be used to further improve the catalytic activity and stability. It is worthy of note that most of these core–shell nanoparticles are solution-based catalysts and only evaluated on planar supporting electrodes such as glassy carbon and gold disks. The performance and stability of these highly electroactive nanocatalysts in MEAs for real fuel cells need to be further investigated.
2.2 Metallic nanowires

Nanostructures with high aspect ratios such as nanowires, nanotubes and nanorods can provide enhanced mass transport and higher electrochemical active surface area than those of low aspect-ratio nanoparticles.13 Nanoporous palladium rods fabricated by dealloying a binary Al80Pd20 alloy under free corrosion conditions exhibit superior electrocatalytic performance toward methanol oxidation in alkaline media.10 Besides pure metal nanowires, bimetallic nanowires have also been studied as catalysts for fuel cells. The PtRh and PtRu nanowires (1:1 atomic ratio) with diameters smaller than 60 nm and lengths up to hundreds of micrometres possess higher catalytic mass activity (449.1 mA mg−1Pt) towards methanol electrooxidation than those with different atomic ratios. These catalysts are also better than the commercial catalyst with highly dispersed Pt1Ru1 nanoparticles on carbon.15 These catalysts also demonstrate better stability than the bimetallic nanoparticles.
The metal nanowire-based catalyst are often tested in a form without supports on a solid electrode surface such as glassy carbon. Whether they can deliver high catalytic activity in MEA and what the optimal support is are still unclear. In a work using a bimetallic Pt–Ru nanowire network as the electrocatalyst in DMFC,16 it is very interesting to observe that a nanowire network catalyst coated on a planar electrode in a half-cell shows lower catalytic activity towards methanol oxidation but higher in DMFC in comparison to commercial Pt–Ru black. It is proposed that the network structure has more effective mass transfer in the MEA structure than that on a planar solid surface. This work may indeed indicate that the nanomaterial based catalysts need to be further investigated in practical devices such as MEA with catalyst supporting materials in fuel cells for optimization and further improvement of the catalytic activity.
2.3 Metal catalysts with three dimensional nanostructures
Metal nanowires or nanotubes growing on a substrate can result in a three dimensional structure with high surface area and improved stability. Pt single-crystal nanowires grown on carbon black nanospheres (Fig. 2a) show enhanced catalytic activity towards ORR compared with the commercial Pt/C catalyst as Pt nanowires are stretching out from the surface of the carbon nanospheres to improve O2 diffusion towards the Pt surface.11 Single-crystal Pt nanowires directly grown on the surface of Pt or W gauze (Fig. 2b) provide great catalysts for fuel cells12 since their active surface area is about 2–3 orders of magnitude greater than that of pristine gauze. Porous Pt nanowire arrays13 display enhanced electrocatalytic activities for ethanol oxidation in direct alcohol fuel cells. At the same loading, a Pd nanowire array32 (Fig. 2c) prepared by using anodic aluminium oxide template-electrodeposition possesses higher catalytic activity towards ethanol oxidation than Pd film and commercial PtRu/C. The nanowire array structure has a high active surface area with enhanced diffusion of liquid alcohol into the catalyst layer, resulting in reduction of the liquid sealing effect, thus increasing the catalyst utilization efficiency. Similarly with the alloyed metallic nanoparticles, alloyed nanowire arrays also have excellent catalytic performance. Pt–Ru nanowire array electrodes synthesized on a Ti/Si substrate33 through an anodic aluminium oxide template (Fig. 2d) demonstrate higher catalytic activity than a pure Pt nanowire array electrode. Three-dimensional Pt-on-Pd bimetallic nanodendrites directly grown on the surface of graphene nanosheets14 (Fig. 2e) have been reported as a catalyst for methanol oxidation. The small single-crystal Pt nanobranches supported on Pd nanocrystals with porous structure and good dispersion exhibit high electrochemical active area for much higher electrocatalytic performance toward methanol oxidation than the Pt black and commercial Pt/C catalysts.

This type of nanocatalyst has been used to fabricate MEAs, in which the catalyst is directly grown on MEA components like Nafion membrane from a solution. A new DMFC anode structure consisting of Pt nanowires electrochemically deposited on Nafion membrane (Fig. 2f) yields higher performance than the conventional E-TEK electrode due to higher electrochemical active surface area and lower methanol crossover rate.34 However, these 3D structured catalysts in large electrode-based fuel cells for practical applications have not been tested. The reason might be that the synthetic methods of these catalysts are still at the research stage, and no mass-production process is available for such evaluations.
The 3-D nanostructured metal catalysts are very promising for fuel cells because of their high electroactive surface area, good contact conductivity with substrates, and high leaching-out resistance against loss that often happens to metal nanoparticle-based catalysts. However, mass production methods to synthesize the catalysts with well-controlled shape, size and composition for practical applications is still very challenging for further investigations.
2.4 Noble metal-free nanostructured catalysts
Currently various types of fuel cells greatly rely on Pt- and/or other noble metal-based catalysts. It is extremely critical to develop noble metal-free catalysts with catalytic activity comparable with Pt and other precious metals. Nanostructured materials could provide such a possibility. Nanocomposites containing transient metals and conducting polymers have been synthesized and demonstrated good electrocatalytic performance. Cr-decorated Ni nanoparticles have been reported as an anode catalyst for hydrogen oxidation in a prototype alkaline PEMFC35 to produce a maximum power density of 50 mW cm−2 at 60 °C without degradation over a 100 h test. Two main mechanisms are known to explain the oxygen reduction process.36 In one mechanism oxygen is reduced to hydrogen peroxide as an intermediate through a two-electron transfer process followed by further reduction to water. Alternatively, oxygen can be directly reduced to water through a four-electron transfer path. Apparently the latter is favored due to its much higher energy conversion efficiency. However, it normally only occurs on a few noble metal-based electrocatalysts such as Pt. A linear J-aggregate of cobalt porphyrin-templated nanostructured polyaniline (PANI)36 and polypyrrole (PPy)37 array nanorods can catalyze the oxygen reduction in a 4-electron transfer pathway to have catalytic performance comparable with a Pt electrode. The newly developed nitrogen-doped carbon nanomaterials have been also discovered to reduce oxygen in a 4-electron transfer process with better electrocatalytic activity, longer operation stability, and higher crossover resistance than Pt in alkaline fuel cells.38 Four-electron reduction of oxygen has also been found on N-doped graphene and graphitic arrays to possess higher catalytic activity, longer-term stability and higher tolerance to crossover and poison than Pt/C.39,40 Some other noble metal free catalysts towards ORR have been summarized in an earlier review.41
3 Nanostructured supporting materials
3.1 
          Nanotube and nanowire supports
With high specific surface area, good conductivity, light weight and high chemical stability, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are one of the most attractive nanomaterials used as an efficient catalyst support in energy systems like hydrogen storage,42,43 supercapacitors44 and fuel cells.45,46 To fabricate an efficient catalyst support, one of the most challenging tasks is how to deposit metal catalyst nanoparticles uniformly onto the surface of CNTs with strong adherence. Pretreatment of CNTs with harsh oxidative acids is often required to generate functional groups on sidewalls as nucleation sites for deposition of well-dispersed, adherent Pt clusters.47 The HF treated MWCNTs possessing enlarged micropores on the walls can anchor the metal nanoparticles effectively to overcome the agglomeration and detachment from the MWCNT surface.48 However, the acid treatment-produced defects on the CNT surface could lower its conductivity. To solve this problem, N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) is used as the dispersant, ligand and reductant for Pt nanoparticle deposition on pristine CNTs.49 The Pt catalysts supported on DMF modified CNTs display higher catalytic activity for the formic acid oxidation than those on pristine CNTs.

          Carbon doped titanium nanotubes are used to support Pt for methanol oxidation, showing significantly enhanced catalytic activity.50 A nanochain-structured mesoporous tungsten carbide supported Pt demonstrates mass electroactivity (323 A (g Pt)−1) and resistance to CO poisoning towards methanol oxidation superior to the commercial Pt/C catalysts.51 Te nanowires are used as supports to deposit adherent, ultrahigh surface concentrated and nanoporous structured Pt catalysts for an enlarged electroactive specific surface area and high electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation over the commercial Pt black catalyst.17 Nanostructured conducting polymers have been also reported as catalyst supports. Introduction of PANI nanofibers within the Pt/C catalyst layer improves the catalyst activity towards methanol oxidation, hinders catalyst from poisoning of the intermediates and improves the mechanical properties of the catalyst layer.52PANI nanofibers placed between Pt particles anchor Pt particles and alleviate the Pt migration during methanol electrooxidation.
3.2 Nanoporous catalyst supports
Nanoporous materials are another type of attractive Pt support used in fuel cells to provide high specific surface area and efficient diffusion of reactants. Among them ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) is the most prominent one and has been employed in prototype power sources for Notebooks.53 The role of the porous morphology of the mesoporous carbons as the support in electrocatalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles has been investigated by using CMK-3, one kind of hexagonal OMC, and disordered wormhole-like mesoporous carbon (WMC) respectively.54 Both materials possess very similar pore characteristics such as mesopore size and surface area, except pore morphology (Fig. 3). CMK-3 provides more electrochemically active Pt sites and higher electrochemical surface area than WMC, especially in the case of using liquid reactants like ethanol, indicating that high order structured and good 3-D networked arrayed carbon CMK-3 nanorods have high accessibility of reactants onto Pt particles for significantly enhanced mass transport rate. Some other OMC applications in fuel cells have been reviewed by Chang et al.53
 Fig. 3  Schemes of Pt nanoparticles supported on mesoporous carbon with different pore morphologies. (Reprinted from Ref. 54 with permission from Elsevier). 
Porous hollow carbon nanosphere-supported PtRu catalysts prepared by a one-step pyrolysis method shows higher electrochemical activity and stability towards methanol oxidation than the commercial PtRu/XC-72 catalyst, and are ascribed to their unique carbon nanostructure and alloy degree of the loaded metallic catalysts.55Carbon aerogels with high porous volumes and high surface areas have been developed as Pt supports in the MEA cathode of a H2/air PEM fuel cell,56 showing that carbon aerogels with different initial pore sizes have similar kinetic activity but very different diffusion polarization losses: the larger the pore size of the initial carbon aerogel, the higher the mass-transport polarization.

          Carbon nanomaterials containing heteroatoms are one kind of good catalyst support. A graphitic carbon nitride with three dimensionally extended highly ordered pore arrays has been reported as a support for a Pt–Ru alloy catalyst of a DMFC anode. The nanostructured C3N4 has 73–83% higher power density than Vulcan XC-72, a commercial carbon black. In comparison to OMC, this ordered macroporous C3N4 possesses a lower surface area but higher conductivity and better electrocatalytic activity contributed from its improved graphiticity and framework N atom-enhanced electron transfer rate.57Boron-doped nanoporous honeycomb diamond films modified with Pt nanoparticles (10–150 nm) deliver greatly enhanced current density of methanol oxidation by a factor of 16 in comparison to that with a Pt polycrystalline electrode.58 The enhancement is attributed to both the high surface area of the nano-honeycomb structure and the high electrocatalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles dispersed inside the pores.
3.3 Array-structured supporting materials
Well-aligned CNT arrays have been used as supports for Pt electrocatalysts. Compared with Pt/graphite and Pt/tangled-CNT/graphite electrodes, higher electrocatalytic activity59 of the Pt/aligned-CNT electrode is observed. A carbon-modified TiO2 nanotube array with well-dispersed Pt nanoparticles60 has been employed as the anode for methanol oxidation. Deposition of partly graphitized carbon on the inside of TiO2 nanotubes can further enhance the catalytic effect as the deposited carbon provides superior electrical conductivity while enhancing the ability of removal of the by-product CO-like species for retaining high catalytic activity. A well-aligned Sn/Pt bimetallic nanotube array61 for Pt support contains a large number of Pt nanoparticles inlayed on the inner-wall surfaces of the Sn nanotubes to remarkably improve the electrocatalytic activity toward methanol oxidation in DMFCs. A 3D nanostructured CNT array62 has been used to support PtRu nanoparticles for significantly improved Pt utilization, catalytic activity and stability towards methanol oxidation, resulting in a current density 10 times as high as that of PtRu thin films. Highly ordered mesoporous carbon nanofiber arrays as a catalyst support63 possess an interspacing void of 70 nm between nanofibers, 1 micrometre of pores between nanofiber arrays and partially graphitic framework to provide favorable paths for electrolyte penetration and transportation, and facilitate uniform distribution of metal nanoparticles for much higher activity towards methanol oxidation than Pt/XC72R.
3.4 Specific nanostructured supports
The use of 2-D graphene nanosheets as a support for dispersion of Pt nanoparticles provides an advanced electrocatalyst for fuel cells. Composites of graphene nanosheets decorated by Pt nanoclusters have superior catalytic performance toward methanol oxidation.64 Further, nearly 80% of the electrochemically active surface area is increased by exposing partially reduced GO-Pt films to hydrazine followed by heat treatment.65 It also has been discovered that Pt supported with functionalized graphene-MWCNT hybrid nanomaterials (Fig. 4a) in an equal component proportion exhibits better electrocatalytic activity for oxygen reduction in PEMFC compared to either Pt/MWCNT or Pt/graphene.66 The Pt/graphene shows larger electroactive surface area than Pt/MWCNT, which is ascribed to the uniform dispersion of Pt particles on graphene sheets with good accessibility. The change in morphology of the graphene sheets caused by addition of MWCNT also makes the hybrid material deliver better catalytic performance than Pt/graphene.

Copyright 2010 American Chemical Society). 
Hollow carbon nano-cages (Fig. 4b) with large specific surface area and good crystallinity are an attractive catalyst support due to their excellent resistance to electrochemical corrosion.67 A nitrogen-doped magnetic onion-like graphitic carbon (N-Me-C)68 (Fig. 4c) has been used to support Pt for oxygen reduction with an ultra-low loading of 0.04 mg-Pt cm−2 and mass activity better than 2% Pt/C and commercial E-TEK 20% Pt/C cathodes by factors of 1.4 and 3.5. A coral-like carbon69 (Fig. 4d) supported Pt catalyst shows higher catalytic activity toward methanol oxidation and better power output in a DMFC than that of E-TEK Pt/C by 1.5 and 1.3 times respectively, possibly because of the high conductivity, enlarged active surface area and highly uniformly distributed Pt nanoparticles. A TiO2@carbon core–shell nanostructure70 as a Pt support instead of carbon black improves catalytic activity and stability toward methanol oxidation.
4 Nanostructured catalysts in biofuel cells
The employment of nanostructured electrode materials actually provide superior biocatalyst supports in BFCs to not only greatly improve the reaction surface area, mass transport rate, and conductivity, but also advance the biocatalytic mechanism for an efficient direct electron transfer process thus significantly enhancing the electrode kinetics for high power density and energy conversion efficiency.
4.1 Nanostructured enzyme supports

4.1.1 
            Carbon nanotubes
          . 
In the last five years nanostructured-supported enzymes have been widely used in BFCs. Most of the favorable nano-supports in both anodes and cathodes are plain or modified CNTs. CNTs possess unique structural and electronic properties, and their dense stacked hydrophobic graphene sidewall is very suitable to support enzymes and organic redox mediators71,72 that are often used in BFCs for various CNT-based anodes and cathodes.
SWCNTs were firstly utilized in a BFC with a glucose/glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) anode and an O2/laccase cathode.73Methylene blue absorbed on SWCNTs has been used as the redox mediator for NADH oxidation at around −0.1 V vs.Ag/AgCl,74–77 a much more negative potential than that of 0.55 to 0.8Vvs.Ag/AgCl at pH 7 on a conventional electrode.78 CNTs are superior supports for organic redox mediators as they can easily adsorb these organic dyes through π–π electronic and hydrophobic interactions. Similarly, poly(methylene blue) modified carbon nanohorns can also decrease the overpotential of NADH oxidation.79 CNTs supported glucose oxidase (GOx) is another type of popular anode in BFCs.80–82 The slow heterogeneous electron transfer on a GOx electrode is caused by the deeply embedded redox center of GOx in the insulative apoenzyme.83 However, GOx immobilized CNTs with appropriate orientation can be close to the GOx redox center to enable fast direct electron transfer leading to a significantly enhanced reaction rate for high power density. Some GOx conformational changes have been observed after its adsorption on CNTs, which decrease the α-helix structure resulting in less shielded GOx active sites and less resistance to the direct electron transfer.84 The electron transfer rate of GOx/CNT electrode is enhanced by modification with polyethyleneimine83 or by a biologically synthesized silica matrix.85 Directly linking the GOx-FAD on the ends of SWCNTs (Fig. 5) results in an electron transfer rate in the range from 12 to 83 s−1 in terms of the length of the standing SWCNTs.86 Unlike the conventional GOx modified electrode which has improved direct electron transfer but decreased catalytic activity towards glucose oxidation caused by enzyme denaturation, most GOx/CNT electrodes show long-term stable catalytic activity.87,88 The enzyme loading amount is another important factor for a GOx anode. Wrapping single-strand DNA on SWCNTs could increase the enzyme loading for improved catalytic activity of the GOx anode.82

CNTs are also used in enzymatic cathode for improving the ORR performance. A laccase/SWCNT cathode used in the first SWCNT based glucose BFC has oxygen reduction at 0.80 V (onset potential) vs.normal hydrogen electrode (NHE),73 which is close to the equilibrium value of E′O2/H2O (0.87 V vs.NHE) at the same pH, indicating a fast O2reduction on the laccase/SWCNT cathode. The onset potential of O2reduction on various laccase/CNT cathodes is almost same but the current density at the same polarization potential could vary with different modifications of CNTs80,89 or casting on different substrate electrode materials.77 SWCNTs with a uniform inner tube diameter as a laccase/SWCNTs cathode could deliver higher catalytic current density than those with a tapered inner tube diameter.90 A bilirubin oxidase (BOD)/SWCNT-glassy carbon cathode catalyzes oxygen reduction with an onset potential of 0.7 V vs.NHE.76 In a glucose/O2BFC, it delivers five times higher maximum power density than a laccase/SWCNT cathode.73 The higher catalytic performance of BOD over laccase is possible because of its high affinity to O2. Although the direct electron transfer of BOD has been observed on various nanostructured electrodes, cyclic voltammograms with pronounced redox peaks are only presented in a few reports.91 The difficulty to study the direct electron transfer process may come from the interference of the relatively large charging current of the nanostructured electrode and the slight oxidation of the electrolyte at a higher potential.92 On the other hand, BOD is very sensitive to oxygen so that the reduction peak can not be clearly observed even on cyclic voltammograms under argon.93 This also proves a high catalytic activity of BOD/CNTs on oxygen reduction.


4.1.2 Other nanostructured enzyme supports. 
A 3D Pt nanoparticle-BOD composite cross-linked by bisaniline bridging units has been used as a biocathode while using an alcohol dehydrogenase/SWCNT anode in a BFC.94 Both BOD and Pt nanoparticle function as catalysts for oxygen reduction. The onset potential for oxygen reduction at the composite cathode is lower (∼0.6 V vs.NHE) than the BOD/SWCNT cathode discussed above, but the composite electrode delivers a power density 4.2 times higher than that of BOD/SWCNT with the same anode design.95 This is contributed from the high catalytic activity of Pt nanoparticles in the composite. A fructose/O2BFC consisting of fructose dehydrogenase and BOD supported on a 3D gold nanoparticle-embedded carbon paper matrix yields a high power density (660 μW cm−2) because of the large surface area and the enhanced air diffusion.96
Nanostructured conductive polymers have been used in BFCs. A PPy nanowire array97 employed in a glucose/O2BFC to fabricate a GOx anode and a laccase cathode resulted in higher power density than CNTs based BFCs. It is interesting that with the length of PPy nanowires shortened from 16 to 0.35 μm the open cell voltage increases from 0.35 to 0.82 V while the power density decreases by a half. It is explained as follows: on the short nanowires the heterogeneous electrochemical reaction is close to a direct electron transfer process due to the shorter distance to the GOx active centre than for the long nanowires, whereas the long nanowires provide a large surface area for enzyme and mediator adsorption to yield a higher apparent current density.
An OMC based compartment-free BFC with GDH anode and laccase cathode yields an open circuit voltage of 0.82 V and a maximum power output of 38.7 μW cm−2, which are higher than those of a CNT-based BFC (0.75 V and 2.1 μW cm−2).98 A dual-chamber BFC with GOx/OMC anode and Pt wire cathode produces an open circuit voltage of 1.2 V and a maximum power density of 110 μW cm−2.5 Considering the glucose concentration in the GOx/OMC-Pt based glucose/O2BFC is much lower than the GDH/OMC-laccase/OMC based one, the former should have much higher energy efficiency than the latter. Because the crossover effect in the compartment-free or membrane-free enzyme fuel cell should be considered, the performance demonstrated is superior. Our recent work shows that the nanostructured GOx/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/NiO hollow-sphere electrode can catalyze oxygen reduction in an air saturated glucose solution.99 The current of oxygen reduction decreases with the increase of glucose concentration. This suggests that the oxygen reduction competes with the glucose oxidation at the GOx-FAD electrode, indicating that design of BFCs should consider the oxygen crossover issue, which could affect the energy conversion efficiency.
The new carbon nanomaterial, graphene nanosheets that have low-manufacturing cost and good biocompatibility, are also chosen as enzyme supports for BFCs.100,101 The first graphene based BFC with GOx and BOD as catalysts exhibits a higher open cell voltage and a larger power density than the SWCNTs based one because of its larger active surface area than SWCNTs.100 The larger amount of dislocations and electroactive functional groups of graphene than of SWCNTs can attach more GOx or BOD for the electrocatalysis. Although these graphene based BFCs use an electron mediator, the direct electron transfer of enzymes like heme proteins102 and GOx103 on graphene modified electrodes has been reported. However, there is a need to further investigate the mediator-less graphene based BFCs.

4.2 
          Catalytic nanomaterials for microbial fuel cells (MFCs)
The first attempt at using nanomaterials in MFCs is the fabrication of a PANI/MWCNT composite anode with 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone as the redox mediator.104 The PANI/MWCNT composite anode has a cable like structure with a higher specific surface area than plain PANI or MWCNT while greatly enhancing the interface charge transfer rate. The Escherichia coli (E. coli)-catalyzed MFC with PANI/MWCNT nanocomposite anode boosts the power density significantly. Metallic nanoparticle-anchored MWCNTs have been used as electrode materials in an E. coli catalyzed MFC105 to increase the power density by ∼9-fold. Ru–Pt/MWCNT and Sn–Pt/MWCNT electrodes are reported to deliver higher maximum power density than Pt/MWCNT electrodes, in which Pt/MWCNT is dispersed in water like “nanofluids” as electron mediators to replace the organic mediators such as neutral red106 and methylene blue.107 The maximum power density of “nanofluid” mediated MFC is higher than the methylene blue mediated MFC. The mesoporous materials with high active surface area and uniform pore size distribution have been used in MFCs to provide more active sites for mediator oxidation. An E. coli-MFC with a mesoporous PANI/TiO2 anode achieves a maximum power density of 1495 mW m−2.108 An improvement of direct electron transfer has been realized by Shewanella oneidensis on a MWCNT modified glassy carbon electrode109 to increase the current density by 82-fold compared to the bare electrode. PPy coated CNTs are used as the anode material in an E. coli catalyzed mediator-less MFC,110 demonstrating that the PPy could serve as a redox mediator to facilitate the electron transfer between E. colicells and the anode.
5 Conclusions and perspectives
In conclusion, the uses of nanomaterials in fuel cells can significantly improve the electrocatalytic performance for high energy density and high power density while reducing the manufacturing cost. The prominent electrocatalytic behavior of the nanomaterials is contributed mainly from their unique physical-chemical properties such as sizes, shapes, pore structures/distribution, surface defects and chemical properties. The great challenges to synthesize and further use the various nanostructured catalysts are not only from chemistry but also from nanoengineering approaches. In general, the core–shell nanostructures provide an economic and effective way to prepare precious metal catalysts for remarkably reducing the usage of the noble metals, while the unique nanostructures such as nanowires, nanotubes and mesopores provide high specific active surface area, superior conductivity, better mass transport and high intrinsic catalytic activity.
For future design of nanoscale metal catalysts, more research efforts may need to be focused on the balance between the nanostructure and stability. In particular, the shape, size and surface properties at the nanoscale should be considered in terms of not only the effects on catalytic activity, but also the relations of stability vs. the various nanostructures. The efforts to develop precious metal free catalysts are far behind what we need. The progress in nanoscience provides good opportunities to explore alternatives to replace Pt and other noble metal catalysts. Porphyrin based nanocomposite could be a promising noble metal-free catalysts for ORR, but its long term operation stability is not certain and requires further development.
More nanostructured catalyst supports need to be developed for both metal and bio-catalysts. A good catalyst support should possess good conductivity, and mechanical strength, long term stability and large specific surface area for loading more catalysts in fuel cells. Graphene is a promising alternative for CNTs and other carbon based supports due to its superior electronic and chemical properties. If the graphene nanosheets can be fabricated onto a 3-D network or vertical array structure, the surface area can be dramatically increased over that of 2-D graphene. Further, the effects of the interaction between catalyst particles and supporting materials on catalytic performance need further investigations.
The detail mechanisms of the electron transfer process at the nanocatalyst/electrolyte interface and between the biocatalyst and nanosupports have not been systematically investigated. A major challenge is lack of approaches or technologies to clarify the electron transfer mechanism. In particular, for microbe/nanomaterial electrodes it is very hard to clarify the electron donors/acceptors at the bio/nano interface from the complicated metabolic products and various surface bounded proteins.
In brief, the nanostructured catalysts for fuel cell applications currently have been fueled up and some have used in practical devices. However, many more efforts are needed to investigate the mass production methods, and these nanostructured materials with practical electrodes such as MEA and/or large scale fuel cells for optimization and performance evaluations.
