    , Accepted 2nd December 2019First published on 3rd December 2019AbstractIn conventional bulk photovoltaics (BPVs), it is difficult to acquire both intensive photocurrent and large photovoltage output, which greatly limits the practical application. Here, we report a new strategy that can significantly increase photocurrent by five orders of magnitude whilst retaining the nature of high photovoltage of BPVs by introducing the local-chemistry-induced polar nanoregions (PNRs) into narrow-bandgap centrosymmetric ultrathin films. It is believed that these PNRs distribute randomly in non-ferroelectric insulator matrix and contribute to ferroelectric-like polarization when the sample thickness is comparable to the PNRs sizes. This allows to establish an internal field to effectively separate photogenerated electron–hole pairs even in centrosymmetric materials with narrow bandgap, and thus the power conversion efficiency (PCE) will increase significantly. BiVO4 (BVO) hereof is exemplified. Through intergrowing polar Bi4V2O11 nanoregions into the ultra-thin narrow bandgap BVO film, the PCE increases 1000 times compared with that of the BVO ceramic without taking advantage of the PNRs. This new strategy of producing high PV output in narrow-bandgap semiconductor thin films therefore will extend the candidate pool of bulk PV materials beyond traditional ferroelectricity, providing a pathway for practical application of bulk PV effect. Additionally, the combination of ferroelectric-like feature with a narrow bandgap in one material may create new optoelectronic functions.

New concepts
Photovoltaic (PV) materials have been intensively investigated for exhibiting both high photovoltage and photocurrent. Traditionally, narrow bandgap semiconductors are selected to ensure the abundant absorption of the solar energy and the high current output, but the maximum output voltage of these devices is limited by their band alignment. Alternatively, by taking advantage of bulk PV effects, ferroelectric materials are capable of reaching much higher photovoltage than their bandgap, whereas their low photoelectronic conductivity and wide bandgap are the main obstacles for obtaining intensive photocurrent for practical applications. In this work, we broke the boundary of these two traditional approaches by inventing a new strategy for fabricating the high-performance PV devices, which combines the advantages of narrow-bandgap semiconductors and the ferroelectric materials together. By introducing the polar nano-regions (PNRs) into narrow-bandgap semiconductors and simultaneously reducing the thickness of the samples to be comparable with the PNRs, large and stable separation fields are established to separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs effectively, thereby producing both high photovoltage and photocurrent (where the photocurrent can be considerable improved by five orders of magnitude). By virtue of this strategy, the power conversion efficiency of these ultrathin films can be improved a few orders of magnitude compared with their bulk counterparts. We believe that this strategy opens a new path to the construction of the low dimension materials with the electrical-optical coupling, whereby more narrow bandgap materials will become potential candidates for searching high-performance PV materials to promote their practical applications.

Introduction
Photovoltaic (PV) devices converts light energy to electrical energy through a process that can generally be divided into two parts: (1) the generation of photo-excited electron–hole pairs, which generally requires the bandgap of the absorber to be lower than the energy of the incident light; (2) the separation of the photogenerated electron–hole pairs, in which built-in electric fields is required.1–3 Since the 19th century there have been many attempts to enhance the photovoltage and photocurrent based on these two factors.1–11 In traditional PV devices, i.e. narrow bandgap semiconductors, the photo-generated electron–hole separation depends on the internal field built through heterojunctions such as a p–n junction or asymmetric electrodes. Therefore, the maximum output voltage of these devices is limited by their band alignment, and their power conversion efficiency relies on the design of the complicated interfaces.4–7 In contrast, ferroelectric (FE) materials, structurally without an inversion center, are capable of separating the electron–hole pairs through the internal field arising from the spontaneous polarization (namely, the bulk PV effect, BPV effect).8–15 Such BPV devices do not need anisotropic heterojunctions constructed at the interface of electrode/semiconductor. Instead, well aligned domain walls and/or depolarization fields can generate much higher photovoltage than that achieved from the traditional semiconductor PV effect.14,15 Despite the high photovoltage observed in FE materials, low photoelectronic conductivity and wide bandgap, e.g., a bandgap of 3.2 eV for canonical FE BaTiO3 which corresponds to the ultraviolet light region, are the main obstacles for the practical application of the BPV devices.9,14,16 Many strategies have therefore been proposed to tailor the bandgap of FE materials through the introduction of extrinsic defects (e.g. ion doping/substitution), but the resultant high leakage current usually affects the screening charges and eliminate the separation field.10,11,17–19 Until recently, one of the most outstanding strategies, brought forth by Nechache et al., is the combination of Bi2FeCrO6 layers with different Fe/Cr orders, by which the effects on ferroelectricity derived from the A-site cations are considered to be separated from the width of bandgap affected by the B-site cations.11 Many of these strategies, notwithstanding increasing the numbers of carriers, impair the output photovoltage to a great extent, and complicated fabrication workflows may also obstruct further practical applications of such PV devices. Therefore, it is crucial to further explore a new strategy to acquire enhanced BPV effect with both high photovoltage and photocurrent.
From the studies of the PV devices, it is obvious that the promising strategy is to reduce the bandgap of candidate materials while maintaining the BPV effect. In other words, non-centrosymmetric structures will become unnecessary if the internal field could be stabilized by other methods, and accordingly more narrow-bandgap semiconductors can serve as BPV materials. Intriguingly, ferroelectric-like behavior has been found in some low dimension centrosymmetric oxides, such as LaAlO3, PbZrO3, and SrTiO3.20–27 Many mechanisms are therefore put forward to interpret these abnormal phenomena, among which strain and defects are proposed as two main factors. Epitaxial strain can be utilized to remove the inversion center of the centrosymmetric thin film materials, indicated by theoretical approaches including first principles calculations, thermodynamic analysis and phase-field models.22,28–32 Such effects have also been confirmed experimentally in ultrathin SrTiO3 grown on the Si substrate. Kolpak et al. unambiguously observe off-center displacements of Ti ions, confirming the appearance of polar structure through high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM).22 Instead of the application of strain, however, polar nature has been discovered in strain-free SrTiO3 thin films as well, and room temperature ferroelectricity has been detected in such ultrathin SrTiO3 films by both piezoresponse force microscope (PFM) and polarization hysteresis measurements.27 This is attributed to intrinsic defects within the SrTiO3, which would lead to the distortion of surrounding unit-cells, thereby forming polar nano regions (PNRs). When the film thickness is comparable with the PNRs sizes, the electrical boundary conditions for the PNRs change abruptly, resulting in the effective screening of the depolarization fields of the PNRs. As a result, ferroelectricity is expected to emerge as the film thickness is reduced.
These theories for the emerged FE-like behaviors in ultrathin films, especially the PNRs mechanism, shed light on a new strategy for fabricating PV devices combining the advantages of narrow-bandgap semiconductors with the FE materials. In this work, we propose that the internal separation field can be built by introducing PNRs into narrow-bandgap centrosymmetric semiconductors and simultaneously reducing the thickness of the samples to be comparable with the PNRs. By virtue of this new strategy, BPV effect can be induced in the narrow-bandgap centrosymmetric semiconductors where sufficient carriers would be generated by the adequate solar absorption, and thus both intensive photocurrent and photovoltage can be achieved. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of these semiconductors will be enhanced in a few orders of magnitude. In addition, according to this new strategy, non-centrosymmetry of the bulk materials is no longer the restriction for BPV effect, thereby considerably extending the selectable range of potential candidates.
Results and discussion
To demonstrate this new strategy, a centrosymmetric material, BiVO4 (BVO), is selected as a model in this report because it can fulfill the two requirements in terms of this new strategy. On the one hand, the bandgap of BiVO4 is ∼2.4 eV, much less than the traditional FE materials, leading to its wide use in solar water splitting.33,34 On the other hand, a competitive product, Bi4V2O11, is inclined to be involved in the synthesis of BiVO4 sample.35–38 Bi4V2O11 can be expressed as (Bi2O2)(VO3.5□0.5), which belongs to the Aurivillius family of compounds.39–44 This structure can be generally described as alternate layers of (Bi2O2)2+ and (VO3.5□0.5)2−.43,44 Although the exact crystal structure, especially the coordinates of the vanadium, is still under debate, the ferroelectricity of Bi4V2O11 has been confirmed and almost all the proposed structures belong to the polar space group.38,39,42 In other words, apart from the defect driven PNRs, local-chemistry-induced polar regions resulting from Bi4V2O11 would be generated in the BiVO4 thin films. Therefore, once the thickness of the BiVO4 thin films is less than the sizes of the polar regions, both FE-like behaviors and BPV effect should be achieved (Scheme 1).27

The occurrence of Bi4V2O11 nano-regions in our BVO films is confirmed by HRTEM. Fig. 1 shows the cross-sectional HRTEM image of the thick (30 nm) BVO films deposited on the LaNiO3 (LNO)/Y2O3:Yb,Tm (YOT)/Si substrate, in which the 10 nm LNO layer serves as bottom electrode, while the 30 nm YOT is a buffer layer. The well-defined BVO/LNO and LNO/YOT interfaces as well as the clear lattice fringes indicate the high quality of this structure. In this report, the tetragonal BiVO4 structure (I41/a, ICSD 62706)45 and the orthorhombic Bi4V2O11 (Aba2, ICSD 71557)43 were used for indexing the electron diffraction patterns. The [112] preferential orientation of the BVO layer along the out-of-plane direction of the LNO/YOT layers is confirmed by the d112 of the BVO layer (0.309 nm, Fig. 1a) and the micro-diffraction patterns (Fig. 1c), which is in line with the XRD results (Fig. S2a, ESI†), while the in-plane orientation of the BVO layer is random (Fig. 1a). More importantly, Bi4V2O11 nanoregions are observed within the BVO layer as shown in the 10 nm regions red-circled in Fig. 1a, the typical interplanar spacing, d020 of Bi4V2O11 (= 0.764 nm) is identified in both the lattice fringes and micro-diffraction patterns (Fig. 1b). Note that such typical micro-diffraction patterns are only found in some specific regions where the ratio of Bi to V is markedly increased (Fig. S6, ESI†), and normal BiVO4 micro-diffraction patterns are displayed in the rest of the areas (e.g. the area highlighted with the green circle in Fig. 1a). Meanwhile Rutherford backscattering spectrometry indicates that the average ratio of Bi to V is ∼1.1 (Fig. S3b, ESI†). Since the as-grown thin films have been annealed for 30 min after deposition, suggesting the material reaction has been accomplished and reaches the equilibrium state, it can be concluded that Bi4V2O11 nanoregions indeed distribute throughout the thick BVO films. Experimental results indicate no evidence for the composition and structure of the BVO layers changing when the film thickness is reduced (Fig. S3–S5, ESI†). As Bi4V2O11 nanoregions are found in the thin (10 nm) BVO sample similarly to the thicker BVO sample (Fig. S7, ESI†), we can thus conclude that Bi4V2O11 nanoregions with a size of ∼10 nm are distributed randomly in the BVO films, independent on the film thickness (Scheme 1).

The interface separating the different layers are indicated with red dot lines. The micro-diffraction patterns of the regions highlighted by (b) red circle and (c) green circle indicate Bi4V2O11 and BiVO4 phases, respectively. 
Inspired by the ferroelectricity of bulk Bi4V2O11 materials, we suggest that the Bi4V2O11 nanoregions can act as the local-chemistry-induced PNRs in the BVO films. In terms of the PNRs mechanism, when the thickness of the BVO films is much larger than the size of the Bi4V2O11 nanoregions, the Bi4V2O11 nanoregions are separated in the BVO matrix and no FE behaviors can be observed owing to the insufficiently screened depolarization field. When the thickness is reduced to be comparable with the Bi4V2O11 nanoregions size (∼10 nm), the Bi4V2O11 nanoregions will be exposed on the surface and simultaneously contact the bottom electrode (Fig. S7, ESI†), and thus the depolarization field can be screened by external charges.27 As a result, ferroelectricity will emerge in the thin (10 nm) BVO film. This inference is confirmed by creating written domains on BVO films with different thicknesses. Fig. 2 reveals the out-of-plane PFM images in a region of 2 × 2 μm2 of the as-grown BVO films after applying 6 V bias on the tip. It is evident that bipolar domain patterns are created in the BVO film with a thickness of ∼10 nm (Fig. 2a), suggesting that the such BVO thin films can be polarized by the PFM tips and the polarization is switchable, similar to the conventional FE films such as BiFeO3. These written domain patterns are very stable and there is no observable depolarization within a day, which is comparable to the domain relaxation time of BiFeO3 films as previously reported.46 The written domain patterns become unstable with increasing thickness. The phase contrast shown by PFM disappears in a few minutes when the thin film thickness is increased to 15 nm (Fig. 2b), and no phase contrast is observed after poling in the thick (30 nm) BVO film (Fig. 2c). Such thickness-dependent polarization confirms that the polarization of the BVO film will only emerge when the thin film thickness is approaching their sizes so the PNRs bridge the film.

Further experiments are carried out to clarify the effects induced by the substrates on ferroelectricity in this system. Although it is reported that stress derived from the lattice mismatch between the sample and substrate can generate the FE-like behaviors on the centrosymmetric ultrathin films,22,28–32 we suggest that such stress has minor effects on the ferroelectricity observed in the 10 nm BVO films due to the in-plane random orientation (Fig. 1a), with which stress would be released to some extent. To further distinguish the FE-like behavior caused by substrate or by PNRs, 10 nm pure BiVO4 films (without PNRs) are deposited on LNO/YOT/Si substrate, on which no FE-like behaviors are observed (Fig. S8, ESI†). These results unambiguously point out that the major contribution to the ferroelectricity detected on the 10 nm BVO films stems from the PNRs rather than the substrate-induced stress, in that no ferroelectricity would be observed once the PNRs are removed (Fig. S8, ESI†). In addition, the switchable PFM response observed in this study does not seem to rely on the choice of the substrate. Similar written domains can also be created in the thin BVO films deposited on a Pt substrate, but no domain patterns are shown in the PFM images on the thick counterpart (Fig. S9c, ESI†). Neither any domain patterns can be found on the pure 10 nm BiVO4 films (without PNRs) deposited on Pt substrate (Fig. S9d, ESI†). Since both the structures and unit-cell parameters of Pt (Fmm) and LNO (pseudo cubic perovskite)46 are distinct, whereas the switchable PFM response of the BVO films deposited on these two substrates are similar, we suggest that such thickness-dependent polarization should not rely on any effects induced by substrates. Therefore, it can be concluded that the emerged PNRs have the major effect on the thickness-dependent ferroelectric behaviors of the 10 nm BVO films in this system rather than any other influences originating from substrates.
Further evidences of FE-like behaviors in thin BVO films at room temperature were deduced from the polarization hysteresis (P–E) loops. The thin BVO film shows typical polarization hysteresis with the remnant polarization of ∼5 μC cm−2 and a coercive field of ∼1000 kV cm−1, while the profile of the P–E loop of the 30 nm BVO sample is poor, revealing a resistor-like behavior (Fig. 3). These results not only demonstrate a strong thickness-dependent FE-like behavior, but also suggest that defects may not be primary factors inducing such ferroelectricity due to the relatively high polarization.47 Therefore, we propose that the thickness-dependent FE-like behaviors observed in this study may mainly result from the polarity of the Bi4V2O11 nanoregions. It is worth noting that the emerged depolarization field can serve as the internal field for charge separation.9

Since a stable internal field can be established in the thin BVO film (Fig. 3) and the bandgap of this film (∼2.4 eV, Fig. S11, ESI†) is much lower than most of the traditional FE materials, enhanced BPV effect is expected in the as-grown BVO films. Fig. 4 presents the I–V curves of the BVO films exposed to AM 1.5 G (100 mW cm−2) sunlight illumination after upward poling. A significant open circuit voltage (VOC) of ∼2.4 V is observed, and the short circuit current density (JSC) is ∼+460 μA cm−2 (Fig. 4, green line). The photocurrent density of such a thin film is five orders of magnitude higher than that of the corresponding bulk material,48 and much higher than the photocurrent density generated in most of the other traditional FE materials without ion substitution (most of these materials are in the magnitude of ∼nA cm−2).9,15 Moreover, it is found that both the VOC and JSC are switchable when the polarization direction is changed to downward (Fig. S12a, ESI†), while no PV effects are found in the sample without poling (Fig. S12e, ESI†), implying that the PV effects mainly result from the established internal field rather than from the interface effects. More experiments are carried out to examine the PV properties of the thin BVO films. The time dependence of JSC of the poled sample with switching the illumination on and off is shown in Fig. S12b (ESI†), in which JSC remains ∼+250 μA cm−2 when the illumination is on, and drops to zero as soon as the illumination is off without observable hysteresis. No degradation of JSC is observed when the sample is exposed to the illumination for 10 min (Fig. S12c, ESI†). As a result, this thin BVO film is a promising material for practical BPV devices.

The poling voltage (upward) is 3 V for the 10 nm sample, and 9 V for the 30 nm sample. The poling time is 10 min. Inset is the device geometry of the BVO/LNO/YOT/Si structure. 
We propose that the mechanism underlying the emergence of the BPV effect in these ultrathin BVO films differs from other BVO related reports.48–50 Over the past ten years, several investigations have been performed to study the PV effect observed in BVO, which is mostly considered merely as an absorber where the separation of photogenerated charge carriers relies on either the asymmetric electrodes or other FE layers as BVO itself exhibits centrosymmetric structure intrinsically.49,50 The photovoltage in those devices is, therefore, limited to a relative low value. More recently, an anomalous PV effect derived from strain-induced distortion is detected on the surface of the BVO ceramic.48 Although the photovoltage is reported to be as high as 40 V, the corresponding photocurrent is in the magnitude of ∼pA, and thus the further use of this material is limited. In this study, the PV effect can only be produced when the film thickness is comparable with the size of intergrown Bi4V2O11 nanoregions. No PV effect is found in samples with thickness greater than 30 nm (Fig. 4), even the poling voltage is increased to as high as the breakdown voltage (30 V) in this system. Moreover, it is found that both the photovoltage and photocurrent are switchable, aligned with the polarization direction (Fig. 4 and Fig. S12a, ESI†). Therefore, we suggest that these PV effects are driven by the internal fields appearing in BVO films with thickness ∼10 nm. A combination of the enhancements originating from both narrow bandgap and FE-like feature increase both the photovoltage and photocurrent compared with the previous reports that enhanced the PV effects from only one aspect.48–50 Additionally, the Bi4V2O11–BiVO4 heterostructure that can be formed in this scenario would further enhance the PV effect.35,36 As BiVO4 is the major component in this sample and its bandgap is calculated as ∼2.4 eV, it is suggested that the BiVO4 regions can be considered as the main absorbers, absorbing a large amount of the solar radiation and generating electron–hole pairs. These electron–hole pairs will then be separated by the internal field induced by the Bi4V2O11 regions,37 and the separated charges are driven to the electrodes and photocurrent is thus produced. Here, we propose that a large area of BiVO4 region ensuring sufficient absorption of the solar energy is critical to energy conversion, whereas the internal field induced by the Bi4V2O11 regions contribute to the charge separation (Fig. S13, ESI†). By the cooperation of the stable internal fields in the Bi4V2O11 regions with the sufficient carriers generated in the BiVO4 regions, the PCE of this thin BVO film is three orders of magnitude higher than that of the bulk counterparts with applying this strategy (see the discussion in ESI†).
We have shown that strong PV effects can be observed in the thin centrosymmetric semiconductors with local-chemistry-induced PNRs. Although the PNRs distribute randomly in the insulator matrix and no polarization can be observed when the sample is thick, internal separation fields would be generated mainly from the emerged effects of the PNRs once the sample thickness is comparable with the size of the PNRs, and thus the large amounts of electron–hole pairs generated in the narrow-bandgap semiconductors can be effectively separated, and thus intensive photocurrent and photovoltage can be achieved at the same time. Therefore, instead of using non-centrosymmetric materials that provide a high photovoltage but low photocurrent, or constructing complicated external asymmetry on narrow bandgap semiconductors that display high photocurrent with low output voltage, such narrow-bandgap centrosymmetric semiconductors with PNRs would be the candidates of BPV materials with high PV performance. We use BVO to successfully demonstrate this strategy. The polar Bi4V2O11 regions discovered in the BVO films are considered as the local-chemistry-induced PNRs. Owing to the emerged internal field derived from the Bi4V2O11 regions and the sufficient solar absorption provided by the BiVO4 regions, the thin BVO films exhibit both high photovoltage and photocurrent, and the PCE thereof is three orders of magnitude higher than the bulk sample. Therefore, we propose that this strategy opens a new path to the construction of the low dimension materials with the electrical-optical coupling, whereby more narrow bandgap materials will become potential candidates for searching high performance BPV materials to promote their practical applications.
Materials and methods
Deposition of thin film and electrodes
In this study, the BVO/LNO/YOT/Si structure was fabricated using the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. An excimer laser (KrF, λ = 248 nm) was used to ablate YOT, LNO and BVO targets. The laser repetition rate was set at 5 Hz, and the target-to-substrate distance was kept as 5 cm. The synthesis of the buffer layer and the electrode layer is reported in our previous work.46 Briefly, a 30 nm YOT layer was deposited on a (001) silicon wafer, using 1.5 J cm−2 laser power density and 15 min deposition time. The oxygen pressure used was 1 × 10−5 Torr, and the substrate temperature was 750 °C. A 10 nm layer of LNO was deposited on the as-prepared YOT layer. The laser power density was 2.5 J cm−2 and the deposition time was 10 min. The oxygen pressure was 5 × 10−2 Torr, and the substrate temperature was 750 °C. Subsequently the BVO layer (with PNRs) was deposited on the electrode layer. The laser power density was 2.5 J cm−2 and the deposition time was 15 min, 8 min and 5 min for the 30 nm, 15 nm and 10 nm sample, respectively. The oxygen pressure was 1.5 × 10−1 Torr, and the substrate temperature was 600 °C. The as-grown thin films were annealed at 600 °C for 30 min under 400 Torr O2.51 To deposit the 10 nm pure BiVO4 layer (without PNRs), the deposition temperature was reduced to 450 °C while the laser power density was 2.5 J cm−2,52 the deposition time was 5 min, and the oxygen pressure was 1.5 × 10−1 Torr. The as-grown pure BiVO4 thin films were annealed at 600 °C for 30 min under 400 Torr O2.51 ITO electrodes (∼50 nm) were deposited at 500 °C and 10 mTorr of oxygen by PLD. The deposition time was 30 min.
Characterization
The structures of the thin-film samples were investigated with a PANalytical X’pert Empyrean diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation. UV-visible absorption spectra were measured on a UV-Vis-NIR Spectrophotometer using the diffuse reflection method (Varian Cary 5E). Composition was analysed using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry with 3.0 MeV He+ ions. Measurements were performed with the beam incident normal to the sample surface and detectors positioned at scattering angles of 168° and 80°. The detectors were surface barrier detectors with an energy resolution of ∼15 keV. The data was fitted using the RUMP software package. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), micro-diffraction patterns and selected area diffraction (SAD) images were obtained on JEOL-2100F. Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) characterizations were performed under ambient conditions on a commercial AFM system (Cypher, Asylum Research), which has integrated signal generator and lock-in amplifier modules. Olympus AC240TM conductive silicon probes (tip coating: 5 nm/20 nm Ti/Pt; force constant: calibrated 1.8 N m−1) were used. The imaging contact set-points used were around 100 nN. For PFM domain imaging, we used off contact-resonance ac probing signals (typically 300 kHz, amplitude VAC = 300 mV) to excite surface oscillations. Ferroelectric hysteresis loops were recorded using a ferroelectric analyzer (TF2000). The current–voltage curves of the sample were measured using Solar Simulator model #SS150 equipped with a potentiostat source Autolab PGSTAT302N. The light intensity was calibrated at one Sun (100 mW cm−2, AM1.5G) using the certified Fraunhofer CalLab reference cell. The chemical valence of Bi and V in both the thick and thin samples were analyzed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Thermo ESCALAB250Xi). The micro-Raman spectra were collected at room temperature (293 K) using confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy (Jobin-Yvon HR800) in backscattering geometry. The excitation used a 632.8 nm line from a He–Ne laser. The laser power was ∼10 W with a spot size ∼1 mm. The backscattered light was dispersed using a 600 lines per mm grating and collected by a CCD array detector. This configuration allowed the recording of spectra with a spectral resolution of 1 cm−1.

New concepts
Photovoltaic (PV) materials have been intensively investigated for exhibiting both high photovoltage and photocurrent. Traditionally, narrow bandgap semiconductors are selected to ensure the abundant absorption of the solar energy and the high current output, but the maximum output voltage of these devices is limited by their band alignment. Alternatively, by taking advantage of bulk PV effects, ferroelectric materials are capable of reaching much higher photovoltage than their bandgap, whereas their low photoelectronic conductivity and wide bandgap are the main obstacles for obtaining intensive photocurrent for practical applications. In this work, we broke the boundary of these two traditional approaches by inventing a new strategy for fabricating the high-performance PV devices, which combines the advantages of narrow-bandgap semiconductors and the ferroelectric materials together. By introducing the polar nano-regions (PNRs) into narrow-bandgap semiconductors and simultaneously reducing the thickness of the samples to be comparable with the PNRs, large and stable separation fields are established to separate the photogenerated electron–hole pairs effectively, thereby producing both high photovoltage and photocurrent (where the photocurrent can be considerable improved by five orders of magnitude). By virtue of this strategy, the power conversion efficiency of these ultrathin films can be improved a few orders of magnitude compared with their bulk counterparts. We believe that this strategy opens a new path to the construction of the low dimension materials with the electrical-optical coupling, whereby more narrow bandgap materials will become potential candidates for searching high-performance PV materials to promote their practical applications.
