    , Accepted 28th July 2016First published on 10th August 2016AbstractA novel diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)-based conjugated polymer (PCDPP) was designed, synthesized and used as a donor material for polymer solar cells (PSCs). By increasing the planarity of polymer chains and reducing the energy loss in devices, we have simultaneously acquired a high short-circuit current (Jsc) and a large open-circuit voltage (Voc) in PSCs based on PCDPP, which is a regular alternating ternary conjugated polymer. This polymer has a medium optical band gap (1.55 eV) with low-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels. In addition, PCDPP exhibits a very good planarity from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and forms a fibrillar network in the active layer of solar cells. Because of these integrated favourable effects, PCDPP-based photovoltaic devices exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 9.02% which is among the highest values reported so far for devices based on DPP-containing polymers. More importantly, the Voc of our PCDPP-based devices can reach as high as 0.86 V, which is much higher than that (<0.7 V) of high-efficiency solar cells based on other DPP polymers. These results provide a promising way to minimize the energy loss and to realize high Voc and Jsc values at the same time in devices to obtain high power conversion efficiencies.
Introduction
Conjugated polymers employing diketopyrrolopyrrole, namely, 2,5-dihydropyrrolo[4,3-c]pyrrolo-1,4-dione (DPP) units, are widely used as donor materials in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) polymer solar cells.1–6 When mixed with fullerene derivatives such as [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM), DPP-based polymers can form efficient interpenetrating networks in blend films, which is beneficial to exciton diffusion and charge transport. Besides, the DPP moiety has a polar nature that can promote the polymers to crystallize, so DPP-based polymers usually exhibit excellent charge carrier mobility, and high short-circuit current density (Jsc) and fill factor (FF). Also, their good charge transport abilities enable the realization of high-efficiency solar cells with a thick active layer, which is highly desirable for the inkjet-printed or screen-printed process with pinhole-free large areas at high printing rates.7–9 However, most of the DPP-based polymers have a narrow bandgap (Eg) and exhibit a low open-circuit voltage (Voc) in photovoltaic devices.1,10,11 Due to their small Voc values (usually less than 0.7 V), only a very few examples with power conversion efficiency (PCE) larger than 8% have been demonstrated in polymer solar cells containing a DPP-based polymer as the active layer.1,9 To surmount this limitation, efforts have been made to increase the Voc by lowering the HOMO energy level of polymers via adjusting the donor units in polymer main chains. As a result, a high Voc larger than 0.8 V has been demonstrated.12–18 Unfortunately, a relatively large photon energy loss (Eloss) (∼0.8–1.0 eV), which is defined by Eg − eVoc, where Eg is the optical bandgap of the semiconducting polymer evaluated from the absorption edge, usually exists in these systems. Thus, it is hard to realize a high Jsc and a high Voc simultaneously, because it is a well-known fact that there is a trade-off between these two parameters. The reason lies in the fact that the realization of both high Jsc and Voc requires that the polymer must have both a narrow Eg and a deep HOMO energy level. However, this will inevitably diminish the energy offset of the LUMOs between the polymer and fullerene, thus weakening the driving force for photo-induced charge separation. A key for minimizing this trade-off is to reduce the Eloss by synthesizing new conjugated polymers to manage the energetics between polymers and fullerenes.19
As we know, the widely used multi-component copolymerization can adjust the optical band gap and orbital levels at the same time, and then energy loss and Voc tuning can be achieved.20,21 According to previous reports for random copolymers, 1D/2A (one donor unit and two acceptor units) or 2D/1A (two donor units and one acceptor unit) structures have been usually constructed.21–25 However, the dissimilar chemical structure of comonomers, the random sequence in copolymer chains and the irregular chemical structure may cause infaust effects on molecular packing, charge transport, and the macroscopic properties of polymers.26–28 In contrast, besides adjusting the optical band gaps and orbital levels in polymers, regular alternating ternary copolymerization allows the synthesis of regioregular polymers, which have a regular and alternating structure oriented along the chain.29,30 Such regioselectivity in polymerizations is of great help to suppress variations in the molecular order and facilitate intermolecular π-stacking interactions which in turn can increase charge transport through polymer films.
It is quite important to select suitable regular alternating units for performance improvement. As we all know, the introduction of fluoro atoms can lower the energy level of polymers, so 3,6-difluorocarbazole was used as one of the donor units. And then, the insertion of 3,6-difluorobenzene can modify the chemical geometry, which is expected to enhance the planarity of the polymer backbone. In this communication, regular alternating ternary copolymerization was carried out to get PCDPP comprising two donor segments (2,5-difluorobenzene and difluorocarbazole) and one acceptor unit (DPP). This polymer has a medium optical band gap (1.55 eV) and appropriate energy levels, which endow the corresponding solar cells with a high Voc (0.86 V) and a small energy loss (0.69 eV). From density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we get that PCDPP displays a very planar chemical structure, which guarantees its good hole-transport ability, and thus higher Jsc. Combining these advantages, PCDPP exhibits an excellent photovoltaic performance, providing a high PCE of 9.02% which is among the highest values reported so far for solar cells using DPP-based polymers.9,11 We should note that the Voc of our device is much higher than that of other DPP-based polymers (<0.7 V) with high device efficiency. Given that in single-junction polymer solar cells Voc can hardly be increased but Jsc can be increased by developing suitable charge collecting layers, we think our DPP-based polymer will be a promising candidate for potential applications in high-performance solar cells.
Results and discussion
The synthetic route of PCDPP is shown in Fig. 1. The starting materials 1, 2 and 5 were synthesized according to the previous literature.2,31,32 Compound 3 was synthesized through Suzuki coupling with a Pd catalyst. Monomer 4 was prepared from 3 by bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Then, PCDPP was synthesized by Suzuki polymerization of monomers 4 and 5. The polymer was first Soxhlet extracted with methanol, acetone, hexane, dichloromethane and chloroform, and then the residue was dissolved in boiling 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE) and precipitated into methanol, and the resultant solid was collected by filtration and dried under high vacuum. The detailed synthetic procedures are shown in the ESI.† The molecular weight of PCDPP was determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) at 80 °C using chlorobenzene as an eluent calibrated with polystyrene standards which afforded a high molecular weight of Mn = 136 kg mol−1 and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 5.19. The thermal stability of PCDPP was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) which exhibited an excellent thermal stability with a decomposition temperature (5% weight loss) of 402 °C. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements showed no obvious glass transition for PCDPP in the range of 50 °C to 250 °C.

UV-vis absorption spectra of PCDPP in dilute chloroform solution and as a thin film are shown in Fig. 2a. In dilute CB solution, PCDPP showed three absorption peaks between 350 nm and 900 nm. The peak at the short wavelength (395 nm) can be attributed to the localized π–π* transition and the strong peaks in the long wavelength region (600–800 nm) can be ascribed to the delocalized π–π* transition caused by the internal charge transfer (ICT) interaction. The absorption spectrum was slightly blue-shifted by several nanometers after heating the CB solution to 100 °C and the shoulder peaks in the long wavelength region debased, reflecting the weakening of the aggregation of polymers. PCDPP exhibits broader absorption in the solid state than in dilute solution, which is consistent with the reported references.33 The optical bandgap is calculated to be 1.55 eV according to the equation: Eg,opt = 1240/λonset. The electrochemical properties were investigated by cyclic voltammetry (CV). The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) calculated from the onset oxidation and reduction potentials are −5.44 and −3.89 eV, respectively. As we expected, the HOMO and LUMO levels of PCDPP significantly move down, which is beneficial to achieve higher Voc and lower energy loss (0.69 eV). On the other hand, the LUMO level of PCDPP is 0.41 eV (>0.3 eV) higher than that of PC71BM, which guarantees the formation of a downhill driving force for efficient exciton dissociation.34,35 To directly observe the change of energy levels, the energy-band diagram is shown in Fig. 2b.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level were also used to investigate the chemical geometries and electronic structures of the simplified repeating units and the alkyl side chain (see ESI†). As shown in Fig. 3, the dihedral angle between thiophene and 2,5-difluorobenzene, 3,6-difluorocarbazole is close to zero degrees in PCDPP, which is 0.04° and 0.02°, respectively. It is clear from the side view that PCDPP has a planar backbone. Compared with the D/A binary structure, in the 2D/1A ternary structure the introduction of 2,5-difluorocarbazole has two potential advantages: first, the backbone on PCDPP becomes a linear conformation; second, the density of the alkyl side chain which is disadvantageous for intermolecular π–π stacking is reduced with the insertion of 2,5-difluorobenzene. Hence, based on the DFT calculations, it can be predicted that this planar conformation may give rise to strong intermolecular interactions (π–π stacking) and a good charge transport ability and thus a high short circuit current. Moreover, this close π–π stacking (as mentioned below) is beneficial for the formation of interpenetrating nano-fibrillar networks.36–38

X-ray diffractions (XRD) of powdery polymer samples were also measured to investigate the packing of polymer chains in the solid state. As shown in Fig. S1,†PCDPP presents one peak in the wide angle region located at 23.71°, which corresponds to the π–π stacking distance between polymer backbones (d = 3.75 Å). Such a short π–π stacking distance indicates that PCDPP has a relatively planar conformation and can be closely stacked in the solid state.
BHJ polymer solar cells were fabricated with a conventional device structure of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/LiF/Al. A range of active layer compositions (weight ratios), spin-coating rates, and additives were systematically investigated. The active layer was deposited from chlorobenzene solutions without and with 1% 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO). The optimized donor (PCDPP) to acceptor (PC71BM) weight ratio is 1:2 (w/w) and the optimized thickness is about 100 nm which was fabricated by spin-coating at a rate of 750 rpm with dilute blend solutions (polymer concentration: 3 mg mL−1). Detailed information on device fabrication and measurements is given in the ESI.† The optimized device performance was achieved at a thickness of ∼100 nm. The active layer was spin-coated at three different rates to adjust its thickness (see ESI†). When the active layer was fabricated at a low spin-coating rate of 500 rpm (thicker layer), a high short circuit current (Jsc) remained but the fill factor (FF) decreased, resulting in a slightly lower PCE relative to that with the optimal active layer thickness. The optimized PCDPP-based devices exhibited a maximum PCE of 9.02%, with an open circuit (Voc) of 0.86 V, a short circuit current (Jsc) of 16.00 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.65. The detailed photovoltaic parameters are also summarized in Tables 1 and S1.† External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements were performed to examine the response of devices to monochromatic light and the veracity of Jsc is obtained from J–V curves. As shown in Fig. 4, PCDPP-based devices exhibited a broad photo-to-current response in the range of 300 to 850 nm, corresponding to the UV-vis absorption spectrum. The highest EQE value of PCDPP approaches 70%, which is quite high for solar cells using DPP-based polymers.11 We also summarize the device performance of DPP polymer solar cells in Table S2;† there are only three other examples with PCE over 8%. The calculated Jsc obtained from the EQE curve is 15.25 mA cm−2, which is within 5% deviation from that obtained from the J–V curve. As mentioned above, due to the appropriate energy levels and optical bandgap, PCDPP shows a high Voc and lower energy loss in devices. The planar geometry of PCDPP is conducive to molecular stacking and endows the blend film with higher mobility, which benefits the improvement of Jsc.

To characterize the charge transport ability of PCDPP, the hole mobility of BHJ solar cells was measured by using the space charge limited current (SCLC) model and calculated according to the equations reported in the literature. The details are shown in the ESI.† The hole mobility of the PCDPP-based device was calculated to be 1.8 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. The morphology of the PCDPP:PC71BM blend film was investigated by atomic force microscopy (AFM) in the tapping mode and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the details are shown in the ESI.† From the AFM measurements, the surface of this blend film is very smooth with a root-mean-square (RMS) of 1.48 nm. As shown in the TEM image of the blend film (Fig. S2†), PCDPP forms an extended fibrillar network in blends with PC71BM with a width of about 10 nm, which is beneficial for exciton diffusion and charge separation, affording a high Jsc and external quantum efficiencies.
Resonant soft X-ray scattering (R-SoXS) was also employed to probe the phase separation of the blends in the bulk under different conditions. A photon energy of 284.2 eV was selected to provide highly enhanced material contrast. Fig. 5 shows the R-SoXS profiles of the PCDPP:PC71BM blend film. The median of the distribution of the scattering smedian corresponds to the characteristic median length scale, ξ, of the corresponding log-normal distribution in real space with ξ = 1/smedian, which is a model independent statistical quantity. The PCDPP:PC71BM blend film shows a small ξ of ∼30 nm which means the formation of appropriate phase separation at a small length scale in the blend film.39 It is known that small domains are favorable for effective charge dissociation and thus the high Jsc.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel conjugated DPP-based polymer (PCDPP) with a medium bandgap was designed and synthesized via regular alternating ternary copolymerization. This polymer shows a broad absorption in the visible region and has low-lying HOMO and LUMO levels. The incorporation of 2,5-difluorobenzene as the second donor unit can improve the planarity of the polymer backbone with small dihedral angles approaching zero degrees from DFT calculations. Such a structure can facilitate the π–π stacking of polymer chains and forms a fibrillar network in blends with PC71BM. After optimization of the device fabrication conditions, a maximum PCE of 9.02% has been achieved with a large Voc of 0.86 V, a small energy loss of 0.69 eV, and a high Jsc of 16.00 mA cm−2. We conclude that the high performance of PCDPP-based devices is due to the combinational results of the molecular structure with regular alternating 2D/1A units, the planar polymer backbone, and the appropriate optical bandgap and energy levels. Our results demonstrate that both a high Jsc and a large Voc can be simultaneously achieved in high-efficiency solar cells using DPP-based polymers. This is achieved by using a polymer donor with a 2D/1A structure via regular alternating ternary copolymerization to reduce the energy loss in the active layer. Our results pave the way for realizing high-efficiency solar cells with large Voc by using DPP-based polymers.

PCDPP

A mixture of monomer 4 (205.22 mg, 116.2 μmol), 9-(2-ethylhexyl)-3,6-difluoro-2,7-bis(4,4,5,5-tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)-9H-carbazole (65.9 mg, 116.2 μmol), NaHCO3 (1 g, 11.9 mmol), THF (20 mL), toluene (5 mL), and H2O (2 mL) was added to a 100 mL Schlenk bottle and carefully degassed before and after Pd(PPh3)4 (4 mg, 3.5 μmol) was added. The mixture was stirred and refluxed at 100 °C for 72 h. Then, phenylboronic acid and Pd(PPh3)4 (4 mg) were added and refluxed for 4 h, and then bromobenzene was added and refluxed overnight to complete the end-capping reaction. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into 200 mL methanol. Then the solid was filtered and washed by Soxhlet extraction with water, methanol, acetone, hexane, and chloroform. The residue was dissolved in boiling TCE, filtered hot and precipitated in methanol to afford PCDPP as a dark green solid. Due to its low solubility in common solvents (CHCl3, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene and so on), we can't get the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of this polymer.
