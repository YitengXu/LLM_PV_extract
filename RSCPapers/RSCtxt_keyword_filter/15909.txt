    , Accepted 9th October 2019First published on 9th October 2019AbstractBased on self-assembly, novel electron extraction layers (EELs) composed of naphthalimide (NPI) derivatives are constructed for application in n-i-p perovskite solar cells. Upon molecular energy level modulation, the power conversion efficiencies have been largely improved from 5.4% to 16%. Such low-cost and highly regulable EELs are promising for future commercial applications.
The booming of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) in the past few years has attracted broad interest in the photovoltaics (PVs) research community.1–3 Thanks to the high absorption coefficients and long carrier diffusion length of the hybrid perovskite materials, PSCs can be designed as simple thin film PV devices with a sandwich structure, in which the photoactive perovskite absorber layer is located between an electron extraction layer (EEL) and a hole extraction layer (HEL). These interfacial charge extraction layers are vital to the performance as well as the stability of PSCs.4
There are numerous reports related to the development of new HEL materials, while the efforts devoted to new EELs are relatively fewer due to the scarcity of suitable materials,5–11 which restricts the development of PSCs in terms of stability, efficiency and scalability. The widely used EEL materials are inorganic oxide semiconductors (typically TiO2, ZnO and SnO2) and organic n-type molecules (mainly fullerenes) in n-i-p and p-i-n structured PSCs, respectively.12–17 The fabrication of an inorganic EEL usually requires high-temperature treatment, and their optoelectronic properties are difficult to tailor.18 In contrast, organic semiconductors can be easily processed in solution at mild conditions, and their properties are broadly tuneable via molecular engineering.19–21 However, successful organic EELs beyond fullerenes are rarely reported, especially for the n-i-p device structure that keeps the efficiency record for PSCs.22–24
In this work, a series of naphthalimide derivatives are explored to construct EELs via a chemical adsorption involved self-assembly (SA) method, which is a low-cost and scalable fabrication route.25,26 The chemical adsorption ensures a robust molecular EEL that can withstand the subsequent solution based perovskite deposition.27 The modification of the substituents on the naphthalimide unit remarkably modulates the molecular energy levels as well as the surface properties of the self-assembled EEL. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of n-i-p structured PSCs (Fig. 1a) is improved from 5.4% to 16.0% upon the molecular engineering of the self-assembled EEL.
 Fig. 1  (a) Schematic structure of n-i-p structured PSCs with SA-EEL; (b) the molecular structure of naphthalimide derivatives PN-P, TN-P and NDI-P. 
The molecular structures of naphthalimide derivatives (denoted as PN-P, TN-P and NDI-P) used in the present work are shown in Fig. 1b. All of them have a propionic acid substituent decorated on the nitrogen of the imide group to enable their chemical adsorption onto the surface of an indium tin oxide (ITO) electrode.28 To modulate the molecular energy levels, different substituents ranging from electron-rich piperidine (PN-P), to 4-trifluoromethylphenyl (TN-P), and electron-deficient imide (NDI-P) groups are designed on the opposite side. The synthesis and characterization details of these naphthalimide derivatives can be found in the ESI.† Their photophysical and electrochemical properties are first studied in solution by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry (Fig. S4–S10 and Table S1 in ESI†). Then their energy levels, including the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), are deduced and shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†),29,30 in which the energy levels (or work function) of other components in the PSCs are also listed for comparison. It can be found that both the HOMO and LUMO levels shift downward as the substituents change from the electron donor to acceptor. Theoretically, the LUMO of the electron extracting materials should be aligned slightly below the conduction band (CB) edge of perovskite. In this context, the NDI-P with the LUMO at −3.8 eV vs. vacuum is expected to be the optimal EEL material for matching CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) perovskite among the three candidates.
By immersing clean ITO glasses into a solution (1 mmol L−1) of PN-P, TN-P or NDI-P in dimethyl sulfoxide/isopropanol (v/v, 1:1) at 40 °C for 5 hours, a self-assembled EEL (SA-EEL) can be formed because of the chemical adsorption via a carboxyl group to the hydroxyl group at the ITO surface. We proved the formation of the SA-EEL by several characterizations like absorption and water contact angle measurement. Fig. S12 (ESI†) shows absorption spectra of the ITO glass with or without the SA-EEL. The apparent absorbance (in spite of low intensity) observed in the UV and visible region strongly supports the presence of the SA-EEL. Compared to the traditional spin-coating based organic EEL, we note that the chemically adsorbed SA-EELs are robust to solvent washing, which is important as they have to support the subsequent solution based perovskite deposition. As the SA-EELs are ultra-thin, they will not cause parasitic absorption as shown by the transmittance measurement (Fig. 2a). The water contact angles are measured to be 58.68°, 54.53° and 49.03° for PN-P, TN-P and NDI-P coated ITO, while the bare ITO shows a lower value of 30.72° (Fig. 2b). These results further verify the formation of SA-EELs as the organic molecules usually increase the surface hydrophobicity.

We further employed an atomic force microscope (AFM) and a surface Kelvin probe force microscope (KPFM) to study the morphology and surface potential of the SA-EEL coated ITO electrode. As shown in the top-view images (Fig. S13, ESI†), there is no obvious difference in the morphology and roughness between SA-EEL coated ITOs and bare ITOs, indicating a conformal and dense SA-EEL on the textured ITO surface. The contact potential differences (CPDs) between the tip and the samples are compared in Fig. 3. As the surface potential of the tip is fixed, the CPD signals reflect the surface potential distribution of the samples. Compared to the bare ITO, the surface potentials increased after coating the SA-EELs, suggesting decreases in the work function. The modification of the work function is important for improving the interfacial electron collection as there is a significant mismatch between the conduction band (CB) of MAPbI3 perovskite (−3.9 eV) and the ITO electrode (−4.7 eV). We further quantitatively compared the work function of the bare ITO and SA-EEL/ITO by Ultraviolet Photoelectron Spectroscopy (UPS) measurements. As shown in Fig. S14 (ESI†), the work function of ITO was reduced from −4.56 eV to −4.00 eV after surface modification with the self-assembled molecular EEL, which in principle will be advantageous to the electron extraction as well as the photovoltaic performance for the devices comprising the SA-EEL.

MAPbI3 perovskite thin films can be deposited on the substrate by a one-step solvent engineering method. As shown in Fig. S15a (ESI†), the absorption spectra of these perovskite films are almost identical. However, according to the X-ray diffraction (XRD, Fig. S15b, ESI†) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Fig. S16, ESI†) measurement, it can be found that the perovskite crystal quality is significantly improved for a NDI-P based SA-EEL compared to the others. The average grain size is enlarged and the intensity of the XRD peaks are enhanced for the perovskite films deposited on the NDI-P based SA-EELs. Despite the moderate hydrophobicity of NDI-P/ITO, the enhanced perovskite crystallization might be related to the chemical environment of the substrate surface caused by the molecular modification. As the surface properties of the EEL can remarkably affect the crystallization of the perovskite, the facile molecular structural tailoring of the organic SA-EEL provides an excellent platform for fine adjustment.
To investigate the potential of these self-assembled naphthalimide derivatives as an electron extraction contact in PSCs, we fabricated n-i-p structured devices with a configuration of glass/ITO/SA-EEL/MAPbI3/HEL/Au, in which the HEL is an organic hole extraction layer that is composed of 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis[N,N-di(4-methoxyphenyl)amino]-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD) and some chemical additives. To highlight the importance of the EEL, reference devices have also been fabricated using bare ITO to form the configuration of glass/ITO/MAPbI3/spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The detailed fabrication conditions and methods are presented in the ESI.† Fig. S17 (ESI†) shows typical cross-sectional SEM images of bare ITO and SA-EEL (NDI-P) based devices, from which the thicknesses of the MAPbI3, spiro-OMeTAD and Au layers are measured to be 380, 180 and 40 nm, respectively. The SA-EEL is too thin to be observed. Compared to the fragmentary and irregular perovskite crystals in the bare ITO based reference devices, the SA-EEL based devices show high-quality perovskite crystals with larger grain size and higher aspect ratio, which should be attributed to the improved surface hydrophobicity of the SA-EELs. This kind of perovskite morphology is advantageous to the charge transport and collection due to less grain boundaries and structural defects.
The photovoltaic performance was first evaluated by current density–voltage (J–V) measurement under a standard AM 1.5 solar simulator, and typical results are shown in Fig. 4a, with corresponding parameters tabulated in Table 1 and average data in Table S2 (ESI†). The bare ITO based n-i-p structured PSCs always show poor J–V characteristics with an average PCE < 2% (calculated from ten individual devices in 3 batches). The incorporation of self-assembled PN-P and TN-P as an EEL improved the PCE to around 5%, mainly due to the enhanced open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) performance. Remarkably, the self-assembled NDI-P based PSCs show a champion PCE of 16%, with Jsc of 20.56 mA cm−2, Voc of 1.05 V, and FF of 73.98% (Table S2, ESI†), with an average PCE close to 15% for ten individual devices in 3 batches. As shown in Fig. S18 (ESI†), despite a certain hysteresis effect, the stable output of the NDI-P based device performs well under an applied bias of 0.827 V with a steady-state efficiency of 15.1%. Moreover, the stability of the best NDI-P based PSCs is presented in Fig. S19 (ESI†), showing that more than 82% of the initial power conversion efficiency can be maintained after 500 hours without encapsulation. We note that these are the best results among all organic charge transporting layer based n-i-p structured PSCs.

Compared to bare ITO, PN-P and TN-P based devices, the large improvements of photovoltaic performance achieved in NDI-P based devices is very impressive. Obviously, such significant improvements are closely related to the structure and properties of self-assembled molecular EELs. To understand their differences in Jsc, we measured incident photon-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra of these devices. As shown in Fig. 4b, all of them show similar profiles but different plateau height in the IPCE spectra. Generally, the IPCE of PSCs at a certain wavelength is determined by light harvesting, charge generation and collection efficiencies. It is most likely that the large difference in Jsc performance is caused by the charge collection step, especially electron collection at the ITO/perovskite interface. The interfacial electron collection involves two competitive charge dynamics, electron extraction and electron recombination. According to the IPCE results, the low electron collection efficiencies in bare ITO, PN-P and TN-P based devices should be mainly attributed to ineffective electron extraction rather than extracted electron recombination.
To get insight into the electron extraction, we performed steady state and time-resolved photoluminescence spectra (PL and TRPL) of MAPbI3 perovskite films on different conductive substrates. Obviously, the fluorescence intensity of the NDI-P sample is much lower than that of the PN-P, TN-P and bare ITO samples (Fig. 4c), indicating enhanced PL quenching of NDI-P. As the fabrication conditions for perovskite are identical, the observed distinct difference in their quenching efficiency was mainly due to the discrepancy of carrier transferring dynamics at the perovskite/ITO interface. The time-resolved PL measurement results are shown in Fig. 4d, from which the average decay time (τavg) can be deduced by fitting (detailed fitting data in Table. S3, ESI†). It can be found that the film based on NDI-P SA-EEL gives the shortest average lifetime of 18.40 ns in comparison with that of PN-P (τavg = 41.80 ns), TN-P (τavg = 21.45 ns) and bare ITO (τavg = 45.65 ns). The above results indicate that the NDI-P SA-EEL has the most efficient electron extraction capability, which contributes to the improvement of the IPCE plateau height for complete PV devices. Crucially, the variation tendency of photovoltaic parameters, including Jsc, Voc and FF, shows a strong relevance to the matching degree between the MAPbI3 conduction band (−3.9 eV) and the LUMO energy level of the adopted SA-EEL molecules (−3.8, −3.0, and −3.1 eV for NDI-P, PN-P and TN-P, respectively). Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the optimized electron collection at the interface and the minimized voltage loss31 of the devices are originated from an improved interfacial alignment, in which a SA-EEL with a suitable molecule LUMO energy level is critical to the electron extraction process.
In summary, a series of naphthalimide derivatives (PN-P, TN-P, NDI-P) have been designed and synthesized to construct electron extraction layers for n-i-p PSCs via self-assembly, which is a low-cost and scalable route. A remarkable enhancement of photovoltaic performance has been realized through modulations to the LUMO energy level of naphthalimide based molecules. The optimal NDI-P based device reaches a PCE of 16%, which is the best result among organic non-fullerene EEL based n-i-p structured PSCs. It's rational to expect a further enhancement of efficiency upon utilizing novel n-type organic molecules with judicious molecular engineering.
