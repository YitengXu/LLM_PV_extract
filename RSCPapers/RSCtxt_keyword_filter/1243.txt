, Accepted 13th June 2016First published on 15th June 2016AbstractWe report the synthesis, characterization, and photophysical and photovoltaic properties of two truxene-functionalized conjugated copolymers (P1 and P2) containing various 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole segments; P1 and P2 were synthesized using Suzuki and Heck coupling reactions, respectively. The number-average molecular weights of P1 and P2 were 1.76 × 104 and 4.58 × 103 g mol−1, respectively, and the corresponding polydispersity indices were 1.47 and 2.16, respectively. Photoluminescence titrations and density functional theory calculations demonstrated that the supramolecular complexes between these polymers and a fullerene derivative, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM), exhibited moderate first step-wise association constants of Ka1 (3.4 × 104 M−1 for P1 and 1.0 × 104 M−1 for P2). Furthermore, ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemical measurements showed that P1 cations were induced in the P1–PC61BM complex, indicating efficient electron transfer from P1 to PC61BM. A P1/PC61BM device with an equivalent weight of 1:1 exhibited a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of up to 0.53%, which was higher than that of a device composed of a P2/PC61BM blend (0.47%). The PCE improvement was attributed to stronger non-covalent interactions between P1 and PC61BM, suggesting that P1 is a promising material for polymeric solar cell applications.
Introduction
In the past two decades, conjugated polymers used as optimized high-efficiency electro-optic materials have received growing interest for their applications in organic photovoltaics, organic field effect transistors, and polymer light-emitting diodes because of their functionalized structure and semiconducting properties.1–6 In the photoactive layer of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells, conjugated polymers are most commonly used as electron-rich donors, whereas fullerene derivatives are used as electron-deficient acceptors. For efficient energy and electron transfer within donor–acceptor (D–A) interfaces, improving the charge separation in the active layer of such cells is crucial. In general, controlling the morphology of the active layer, which can facilitate the two D–A interfaces in forming an interpenetrating network at the microscopic scale, is one of the methods for achieving efficient exciton diffusion and charge separation.7,8 Moreover, a supramolecular approach has been used recently for efficient charge separation.9,10 Nuckolls et al. utilized a coronene derivative (6-DBTTC) as a small molecule donor that formed supramolecular complexes with PC71BM (as acceptors) through π–π noncovalent interactions in the active layer and improved the solar efficiencies of devices up to 2.7%.9
Fullerene and its derivatives are currently considered electron acceptors because of their beneficial reduction potential, photophysical, and electrochemical properties, and low reorganization energy.11,12 Many studies have investigated whether fullerene can self-assemble and form supramolecular complexes with aromatic compounds through aromatic π–π stacking interactions.13 Truxene is one of the most outstanding polycyclic aromatic organic compounds composed of a C3h symmetric coplanar-conjugated heptacyclic polyarene, and it induces exceptional optoelectronic properties and strong π–π interactions.14 The truxene core is particularly suitable as a scaffold because its extended π-delocalized system can cause a substantial shift in the absorption spectrum toward the visible region and provide a large aromatic surface on which fullerenes might establish favorable noncovalent interactions.15 Martín et al. demonstrated the formation of supramolecular complexes comprising small molecule truxene derivatives and fullerene derivatives, with binding constants (Ka) in the region of 104 M−1.16,17 They reported that stronger noncovalent interactions occurred between the truxene derivatives and fullerene derivatives, which enhanced the formation of supramolecular complexes as well as the charge separation in the interfaces.
In this study, we synthesized two novel truxene-based conjugated copolymers—both with and without the incorporation of a 4,7-substituted styryl unit in the 2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (BT) monomer of polymer P1 or P2—by using Suzuki and Heck coupling reactions, respectively. Our strategy for studying the operating mechanisms of BHJ solar cell involved focusing on two aspects: (1) the association of P1 or P2 with PC61BM and the formation of supramolecular complexes through noncovalent interactions, and (2) the energy and electron transfer in those supramolecular complexes inducing charge-separated states. This study also aimed to examine the structural effect of the BT groups on the optical properties of the conjugated polymers, as well as the effect of the BT units on the energy and electron transfer of complexes. Through photoluminescence titrations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrated that both P1 and P2 formed a supramolecular complex in the presence of PC61BM. Additionally, the complex enabled energy transfer between the polymer and PC61BM. The charge-separated state was detected in the P1–PC61BM supramolecular complex by ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy and spectroelectrochemistry. P1 and P2 were used as donors for BHJ solar cells, and their power conversion efficiency (PCE) levels were 0.53% and 0.44%, respectively. The higher association constant of P1 and PC61BM engendered higher short-circuit current density (Jsc) and PCE levels, probably because of the more efficient energy and electron transfer from P1 to PC61BM in the blend.

Materials
Synthetic routes for the monomers and polymers are shown in Schemes 1 and 2. The intermediates, 10,15-dihydro-5H-diindeno[1,2-a:1′,2′-c]fluorene (truxene) (1) and 5,5,10,10,15,15-hexapropyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-diindeno[1,2-a:1′,2′-c]fluorene (2), were synthesized following the processes reported in the literature.18 Tetrahydrofuran (THF) and toluene were purified and distilled from sodium prior. N,N-Dimethylformamide (DMF) was dried with appropriate drying agents, calcium hydride or sodium, then distilled under reduced pressure and stored over 4 Å molecular sieves before use. 1-Bromopropane (Aldrich, 98.5%), 3-phenylpropionic acid (Acros, 99.0%), bromine (Acros, 99.8%), bis(pinacolato)diboron (B2Pin2) (Acros, 95.0%), [1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]dichloropalladium(II) (Pd(dppf)2Cl2) (Alfa, 99.0%) and other reagents were purchased from commercial Chemical Co. and used without further purification.

Measurements
All new compounds were identified by NMR, mass spectra, and elemental analysis (EA). NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AMX-500 (1H NMR: 500 MHz, 13C NMR: 125 MHz) spectrometer with CDCl3 as solvent, and chemical shifts (δ) were reported in ppm using tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. Coupling constants (J) were reported in Hertz (Hz). Elemental analysis was performed on a Heraeus CHN–O rapid elemental analyzer. Fast atom bombardment mass spectra (FABMS) were obtained on a JEOL JMS-700 mass spectrometer. Thermal analysis was performed using a differential scanning calorimeter (Perkin Elmer DSC 7) at a scanning rate of 20 K min−1 under nitrogen atmosphere. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under nitrogen atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 K min−1 using a Perkin Elmer TGA-7 thermal analyzer. Number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of polymers were measured with a gel permeation chromatograph (GPC), model CR4A from Shimadzu, using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as an eluent and the rate of elution was 1.0 mL min−1; the instrument was calibrated with polystyrene standards (1000–136000 g mol−1). UV-vis absorption spectra were measured with a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer. Fluorescence properties were detected with an OBB Quattro II fluorescence spectrophotometer. Fluorescence quantum yields (ΦPLs) of compounds in solution were estimated at room temperature with poly(9,9-dihexylfluorene) (PF) as the standard (ΦPL = 1.0). All ΦPLs of polymers are relative to that of PF. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded with a voltammetric analyzer (model CV-50W from BAS) at room temperature under nitrogen atmosphere with a scanning rate of 100 mV s−1. The measuring cell comprised polymer-coated ITO as the working electrode, Ag/AgCl electrode as the reference electrode, and platinum wire electrode as the auxiliary electrode. The electrodes were immersed in acetonitrile containing 0.1 M (n-Bu)4NClO4 as electrolyte. Spectroelectrochemistry analyses were carried out with an electrolytic cell, which was composed of a 1 mm cuvette, a platinum wire as an auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgCl reference electrode. All the computational calculations were performed at B3LYP/6-31G* level using density functional theory (DFT) with Gaussian 09 program.19 Photocurrent–voltage characteristics of the organic photovoltaic devices were recorded with a potentiostat/galvanostat (Yamashita Denso YSS-50A) at a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 and AM1.5 G spectrum.

Device fabrication
The fabricated BHJ devices had the following configuration: indium tin oxide (ITO)/PEDOT:PSS/active layer/Al. The devices were prepared on cleaned ITO-coated glass substrates (8 Ω sq−1). The ITO substrates were sequentially patterned using a mixed solution (VH2O:VHCl:VHNO3 = 10:9:1). They were then cleaned with deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol, and dried. PEDOT:PSS was passed through a 0.45 μm filter before being deposited on ITO by conducting spin coating at 5000 rpm in air. The polymer (P1 or P2) and PC61BM blending with a weight ratio of 1:1 (10 mg mL−1 in o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB)) was prepared. The solution was filtered through a poly(tetrafluoroethylene) filter with a pore size of 0.22 μm, and then spin-coated at 5000 rpm for 45 s on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer. The devices were then dried at room temperature for 2 h. The device was completed by depositing a 120 nm thick layer of Al at pressures that were less than 5 × 10−5 torr.
Results and discussion
Synthesis of monomers and polymers
Scheme 1 outlines the synthetic routes for synthesizing the required monomers. We prepared 2,7-dibromo-5,5,10,10,15,15-hexapropyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-diindeno[1,2-a:1′,2′-c]fluorene (M1) in a 45.2% yield through a bromination reaction between 5,5,10,10,15,15-hexapropyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-diindeno[1,2-a:1′,2′-c]fluorene (2) and bromine through recrystallization from ethanol. Moreover, 2,2′-(5,5,10,10,15,15-hexapropyl-10,15-dihydro-5H-diindeno[1,2-a:1′,2′-c]fluorene-2,7-diyl)bis(4,4,5,5-tetra-methyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (M2) was synthesized in a 54.0% yield through a Suzuki reaction of M1 and B2Pin2 catalyzed by Pd(dppf)2Cl2 at 90 °C. A divinyl functional monomer, 4,7-bis(4-vinylphenyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (M4), was obtained from M3 and 4-vinylphenylboronic acid through a Suzuki reaction catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4, resulting in M4 in a 55.0% yield. The chemical structures and constitutional composition of the synthesized monomers were confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectroscopy. Fig. 1 shows the 1H NMR spectra of representative monomers (M1 and M4) in CDCl3. The 1H NMR spectrum of M1 demonstrated characteristic chemical shifts at 7.19–8.37, 2.01–2.89, and 0.45–0.60 ppm corresponding to the protons of the aromatic, aliphatic methylene (Ha and Hb), and methyl (Hc) groups, respectively. The spectrum of M4 exhibited chemical shifts at 7.54–7.97 and 5.31–6.79 ppm corresponding to the aromatic proton signals (Hd, He, and Hf) and vinyl group doublet of doublets (Ha, Hb, and Hc), respectively. 13C NMR measurements (Fig. S1–S3†) were adapted to confirm the structure of the monomers. Fig. S4–S6† show the FABMS (Fast Atom Bombardment Mass Spectroscopy) mass spectra of monomers M1, M3, and M4. Chemical structures of the synthesized monomers were also confirmed using elemental analysis.

We polymerized P1 and P2 by using the Suzuki and Heck coupling reactions, respectively (Scheme 2). The chemical structures and compositions of the synthesized polymers were confirmed using NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. Fig. 2 shows the 1H NMR spectra of P1 and P2 in CDCl3. The 1H NMR spectrum of P1 exhibited peaks at approximately 7.42–8.70, 2.75–3.15 (Ha), 1.90–2.36 (Hb), and 0.49–1.0 (Hc) ppm that were assigned to the aromatic and aliphatic propyl protons of the truxene unit (Fig. 2a). P2 was successfully synthesized, as confirmed by the apparent disappearance of the M4 vinyl protons at 5.31–6.79 ppm (Fig. 2b). The final molar ratio compositions in the polymers were determined using elemental analysis, and all data were in agreement with our 1H NMR spectral analysis. The number-average molecular weights (Mns) of P1 and P2 were 1.76 × 104 and 4.58 × 103 g mol−1, respectively, with corresponding polydispersity indices of 1.47 and 2.16, respectively (Table 1). GPC analysis demonstrated that the numbers of repeating units (n) of the main chain were 24 and 5 for P1 and P2, respectively, indicating that the lower Mw of P2 was attributed to the steric effect and electron-deficient character of the M4 monomer in the conjugated backbone, resulting in reduced monomer reactivity upon polymerization. These results suggest that the monomer concentrations, catalyst activity, type of base, solubility, and reaction temperature play vital roles in determining the molecular weight and polydispersity of polymers. P1 and P2 exhibited glass transition temperatures (Tg) of approximately 147.5 and 130.2 °C, respectively. This finding suggests that incorporating cis-form configuration of M4 units along the copolymer backbones provides low rigidity because of the increased steric hindrance and reduced conjugation. Both polymers exhibited high thermal stability with the thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) of P1 and P2 being 281.3 °C and 264.1 °C, respectively, at 5% polymer weight loss (Fig. 3). The residual weights of the polymers at 800 °C were above 55.7%, indicating high thermal stability.

Optical properties and theoretical calculations
Typical absorbance and fluorescence spectra for P1 and P2 in the CH2Cl2 solution are summarized in Fig. 4 and Table 2. P1 and P2 exhibited strong and narrow absorbance at 312–319 nm that resulted from a π–π* electronic transition of the conjugated polymer backbone. Another electronic transition in P1 was observed in the range of 350–500 nm (Fig. 4a), which was attributed to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the truxene donor groups and the BT acceptor, providing efficient charge separation at the excited state. The electronic transition in P1 should involve a migration of electron density from a donor (truxene) toward an acceptor group (BT), leading to the observed ICT interaction and bathochromic shift.20,21 By contrast, P2 exhibited a weak absorption shoulder only at approximately 410 nm because of the low Mw (Fig. 4b). These results also suggest that incorporating π-extended styryl groups in P2 influenced the spectral intensity, causing variations in the molecular stacking within the polymer backbone. The emission spectrum of P1 in the solution exhibited a peak at 549 nm, whereas that of P2 demonstrated two fluorescence peaks at 413 and 549 nm. We attributed the observed 413 nm peak to the π–π* transition of the truxene units, which is consistent with that reported in the literature,22–24 implying that the energy transfer from truxene to the BT units within P2 was weaker than that within P1. The bandgap (Eg) values, determined according to the onset of absorption in the solution state, for P1 and P2 were 2.55 (485 nm) and 2.49 eV (497 nm), respectively. These similar Eg values between P1 and P2 were attributed to the lowest energy singlet excited state of polymers comprising alternating positive (highest occupied molecular orbital; HOMO) and negative regions (lowest unoccupied molecular orbital; LUMO) corresponding to the electron localized on the BT units and the hole localized on the truxene donor groups; this result is consistent with that of Cornil et al., who placed a LUMO on BT units.25,26

To further evaluate the presence of the strong π*–π transition peak at approximately 413 nm in the fluorescence spectra for P2, we conducted computational studies on a D–A dimer model compound with a D-trans–A-cis–D-trans–A configuration; the studies were performed at a B3LYP/6-31G* level by using density functional theory (DFT) and the Gaussian 09 suite of programs19 to determine the molecular geometry and molecular orbital of M4 in the P2 backbone. Fig. S7–S9† illustrate typical optimized structures and the HOMO and LUMO distributions of the dimer model compounds for P1 and P2. We discovered that the cis-form of a vinyl double bond for the dimer model compound of P2 exhibited a wide dihedral angle (64.8°), which results in increased steric hindrance and reduced conjugation (Fig. S3†). This result demonstrates that the electron transfer between the HOMO and LUMO was hindered, which is consistent with the optical properties of P2.
Photoluminescence titration experiment
Fig. 5 presents the fluorescent responses of the polymers to varying PC61BM concentrations in a CH2Cl2 solution (1.0 × 10−6 M) at room temperature. At an excitation wavelength of 300 nm, the fluorescence intensities of P1 at 549 nm decreased substantially (Fig. 5a), indicating that the truxene units in the main chain effectively transferred electron from the conjugated polymer backbone to PC61BM through π–π stacking and van der Waal interactions,27–29 thus leading to the fluorescence quenching of P1. When approximately 38 equivalents of PC61BM were added (i.e., P1:PC61BM = 1:38), the reduction rate of the P1 fluorescence intensity slowed down, and the quantum yield value decreased from 0.94 to 0.13. Similarly, we observed a drop in the P2 fluorescence intensities in the presence of PC61BM (Fig. 5b). The results also revealed that after 44 equivalents of PC61BM were added, the quenching tendency of P2 tended to slow down, consequently reducing the quantum yield (from 0.29 to 0.03).

Inset shows the Job's plot variations between polymer and PC61BM. The first stepwise association constants (Ka1s) of P2 calculated by the intensity of 413 and 549 nm were 1.0 × 104 L mol−1 and 7.5 × 103 L mol−1, respectively. 
We conducted a Job's plot analysis to further determine the binding stoichiometry of P1 and PC61BM. The fluorescence of P1 in the absence (F0) and presence (F) of PC61BM was determined at 549 nm. A plot of (F0 − F) versus the relative molar fraction (CPC61BM/CP1) is provided in the inset of Fig. 5a. From the derived plot, tangents were drawn on both sides of the tendency curve and an intersection of two tangents perpendicular to the x axis represented the molar fraction of the plot. We observed a value of 24, indicating that P1 could associate with 24 equivalents (eq.) of PC61BM. The π–π stacking interaction between P1 and PC61BM (1:24 molar ratio) was also confirmed by the repeating units (n) of the P1 main chain. The first stepwise association constant (Ka1) for the P1/PC61BM supramolecular complex with 1:1 stoichiometry was calculated following the photoluminescence titration experiment.30,31 The Ka1 of this system for P1 was 3.4 × 104 M−1, whereas the Ka1s calculated for P2/PC61BM complex at 413 and 549 nm were 1.0 × 104 M−1 and 7.5 × 103 M−1, respectively (Fig. 5b). We attributed the low Ka1s to the weak π–π stacking interaction within the P2/PC61BM supramolecular complex and the increased steric hindrance of the cis-form configuration of M4 isomer, which ineffectively transferred energy from P2 to PC61BM.
Near-IR absorption spectra and spectroelectrochemical investigation
Fig. 6 shows the near-IR absorption spectra of P1 in toluene solution (1.0 × 10−3 M) upon the addition of 80 eq. of PC61BM. On irradiation of the P1-containing solution, no near-IR absorption band was observed. However, when P1 was associated with PC61BM (80 eq.) and then irradiated, a broad near-IR absorption band in the range of 800–2000 nm was observed, with a 2.3-fold enhancement of the absorbance intensity at 1200–1600 nm. This result can be attributed to electron transfer from P1 to PC61BM in the P1/PC61BM supramolecular system. However, we could not observe a change in near-IR absorption in the P2 solution with PC61BM. These phenomena imply that the electron transfer in P2/PC61BM was weaker than that in P1/PC61BM, which may also be attributed to the steric hindrance of the cis-form isomer in P2.

To further investigate the formation phenomena of the broad near-IR absorption band in Fig. 6, we conducted spectroelectrochemical oxidation experiments by using P1 in toluene solution (Fig. 7). On applying potentials from 0 to 1.2 V, a decrease in absorption intensity at approximately 415 nm and an increase in the near-IR range of 800–1600 nm were observed, indicating that these absorption spectral variations originated from the oxidation of P1, leading to the formation of P1 cations, which is consistent with the transient absorption results presented in Fig. 6. Moreover, the broad near-IR absorption band observed in the range of 800–2000 nm (Fig. 6) was attributed to the formation of P1 cations and PC61BM anions in the P1/PC61BM complex. By contrast, the electron transfer between P1 and PC61BM provided a charge separated state (P1+ + PC61BM−), which was the main pathway for the formation of P1 cations and PC61BM anions according to the transient absorption data.

Theoretical calculations of supramolecular complex
To visualize the association of the D–A model compound of P1 with PC61BM, the interaction of these systems was theoretically investigated.19 Fig. 8a and b show the results of DFT B3LYP/6-31G* method calculated for the resulting model compound–PC61BM complex. This moderate basis set, to extent, accurately predicts the geometry and electronic structures of large supramolecular systems. In the present study, the central benzene ring of the truxene core stacked on one of the conjugated rings of PC61BM and formed an almost parallel complex through a strong non-covalent π–π* stacking interaction. The HOMO and LUMO of the P1/PC61BM complex calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level are shown in Fig. 8c and d. DFT calculations revealed that in the ground state, most of the HOMO was located on the D–A model compound of P1 (Fig. 8c), whereas the LUMO was positioned in the PC61BM entity of the complex (Fig. 8d). The calculated Gibbs free energy of the formation of the P1/PC61BM model was approximately −23.0 kJ mol−1, suggesting that the complex energy was lower than the total energy of independent P1 and PC61BM. This indicated that the complex was thermodynamically stable. These results showed that the charge from P1 to PC61BM can transfer effectively in polymer solar cells. Theoretical calculations were consistent with the results of the aforementioned experiments for the formation of the P1/PC61BM supramolecular complex.

Photovoltaic performance
To investigate the photovoltaic properties of the synthesized polymers (P1 and P2), we fabricated typical BHJ solar cell devices with an ITO/PEDOT:PSS/P1 or P2:PC61BM (1:1)/Al structure. We measured the current–voltage (J–V) characteristics of these devices under AM1.5 G white light illumination at an intensity of 100 mW cm−2. Fig. 9 illustrates the J–V characteristics of these devices, and Table 3 presents a summary of the Jsc, open-circuit voltage (Voc), fill factor (FF), and PCE levels for both devices. The P1:PC61BM device showed a Voc of 0.43 V, Jsc of 2.89 mA cm−2, FF of 0.47, and PCE of 0.53%, where the P2:PC61BM device exhibited a Voc of 0.43 V, Jsc of 2.73 mA cm−2, FF of 0.41, and PCE of 0.44%. These results are consistent with the discussions of the preceding experiments. Compared with P2, the relatively high Jsc and PCE of P1 was due to its more planar backbone structure, higher molecular weight, and higher association constant, which contribute toward enhancing the efficiency of the energy and electron transfer from P1 to PC61BM. The preliminary photovoltaic investigation suggests that optimizations of the device composition, morphology, and annealing processes are necessary for P1; therefore, further research is underway.

Conclusions
We synthesized two novel conjugated copolymers (P1 and P2) and investigated the association of P1 with PC61BM by using ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared spectroscopy, photoluminescence titration, spectroelectrochemical oxidation, and DFT calculations. Our photoluminescence titration results suggest that the π–π stacking interaction between P1 and PC61BM was determined by the moderate first stepwise association constant of P1/PC61BM (3.4 × 104 M−1). We also demonstrated that P1 cations were induced in the P1/PC61BM complex because of the formation of charge-separated species through the self-assembly of P1 and PC61BM. These results indicate that P1 is a promising material for use in BHJ solar cells. The preliminary photovoltaic investigation results indicate that the energy and electron transfer from P1 to PC61BM was more efficient than that from P2 to PC61BM.
