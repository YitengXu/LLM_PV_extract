Introduction
Organometal halide perovskites have emerged as a fascinating semiconductor material in recent years due to their low-temperature processability and excellent photovoltaic properties.1–4 The advancements in film fabrication methods, composition optimization and interface engineering have jointly led to a remarkable increase of the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which already exceeds 22%.5 Many high-efficiency PSCs adopt a device configuration of FTO/TiO2/perovskite/doped organic hole-transporting layer (HTL)/Au(or Ag), where the organic HTL could be 2,2′,7,7′-tetrakis(N,N-di-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9′-spirobifluorene (spiro-MeOTAD) or poly(triarylamine) (PTAA). However, the hygroscopic nature of the dopant and the pinholes across the as-prepared spiro-MeOTAD films limit the long-term air stability of PSCs.6–10 Spiro-MeOTAD and PTAA have the further disadvantage of high cost, which may also hinder the widespread deployment of PSCs in the future.
In order to address the stability and cost issues of doped organic materials, alternative dopant-free organic HTLs,11–13e.g. Trux-MeOTAD, and low-cost inorganic HTLs, e.g. CuI14 and CuSCN,15 have recently been developed. However, the complex synthesis procedures of dopant-free organic materials may limit the production scalability and reproducibility of the materials, while the reactivity of CuSCN with the perovskites can also trigger the degradation of PSCs.16 Recently, there has been growing interest in developing NiOx HTLs for PSCs due to their good stability and hole extraction properties. Several methods have been applied to prepare NiOx films, including solution processing,17,18 sputtering,19 pulsed laser deposition20 and atomic layer deposition.21 Among these preparation methods, solution processing has the advantages of low cost and high throughput. However, a high-temperature annealing process is often required to make the solution-processed NiOx HTL conductive, thus limiting the use of NiOx in inverted PSC structures (i.e., anode/HTL/perovskite/electron transport layer (ETL)/cathode).
In this work, we demonstrated air-stable, normal structure PSCs by enabling the direct deposition of a NiOx nanoparticle (NP) film on the perovskite layer via a low-temperature solution process. The NiOx NP film exhibits a uniform and dense morphology, which greatly improves the air stability and thermal stability of the PSCs. We further found that by introducing an interfacial layer (e.g. spiro-MeOTAD or CuSCN) between the NiOx film and the top metal electrode, the PCE of the PSCs can be largely improved from 10.4% to 17.2%, while the excellent air stability is maintained. The role of the interfacial layer was investigated through impedance analysis and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS). Remarkably, the PSCs with the NiOx/CuSCN hybrid inorganic HTL exhibit no degradation in their PCE after being exposed to ambient air (humidity level: 50–60%) for 4 months without encapsulation.
Results and discussion
NiOx film on perovskite
The perovskite film was fabricated on a mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) coated FTO substrate according to a previously reported method,22 and the morphology of the perovskite film is shown in Fig. 1a. To form a NiOx layer on top of the perovskite without damaging the layer underneath, we prepared a NiOx NP suspension by replacing ethanol (solvent of the purchased NP suspension) with 1-butanol. Such a solvent exchange process ensures good solution stability and film formation properties on the perovskite layer. The sizes of the NiOx NPs are in the range of 5 to 7 nm, as revealed in Fig. 1c. After spin-coating the NP suspension on the perovskite layer, a uniform and crack-free NiOx film is formed (Fig. 1b). We examined the absorption spectra (Fig. S1†) of the perovskite film before and after the deposition of NiOx and found that they are almost identical, suggesting that the deposition process does not damage the bulk of the perovskite layer. In order to further confirm the uniformity and analyze the chemical composition of the NiOx film, energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were conducted. Fig. 1d and e show the distribution of Ni and O elements in the NiOx film, respectively, indicating a uniform formation of the NiOx film over the perovskite layer. Fig. 1f and g present the XPS spectra of the Ni 2p3/2 and the O 1s core level, respectively, revealing that the NiOx film consists of three chemical states: NiO (Ni 2p at 853.7 eV and O 1s at 529.1 eV), Ni2O3 (Ni 2p at 855.5 eV and O 1s at 531.1 eV) and NiOOH (Ni 2p at 856.2 eV and O 1s at 531.6 eV), and the broad peak centered at 860.8 eV in the Ni 2p spectrum is attributed to the shake-up process of NiOx.23 We note that similar results have been reported previously for other solution processed NiOx films.24,25

Stable PSCs with NiOx as the HTL
We first studied the performance of PSCs using the NiOx film as the sole HTL. Fig. 2a shows a cross-sectional view of the device structure (metal electrode not included) with FTO as the bottom electrode, TiO2 (consisting of a compact TiO2 layer and a m-TiO2 layer) as the ETL, perovskite as the photoactive layer and NiOx as the HTL. Fig. 2b illustrates the energy band alignment in the device. Here the work function and the valence band maximum (VBM) of the NiOx film were determined from the UPS spectrum shown in Fig. S2,† which confirms a p-type nature of the NiOx film. To optimize the PSC performance, we varied the weight concentration (wt%) of the NiOx NP suspension from 0 wt% to 15 wt%. The NiOx film morphology resulting from different weight concentrations of the NP suspension is presented in Fig. S3,† and the device parameters of the corresponding solar cells are compared in Table 1. It can be seen that the best performing device is obtained with 5 wt% NP concentration, corresponding to a NiOx film thickness of around 30 nm. The result suggests that, on one hand, the NiOx film can block leakage current and charge recombination paths in the device and, on the other hand, the film has limited conductivity and may hinder the hole extraction when it is too thick.

The PSCs demonstrate excellent air stability with the use of the NiOx HTL. As shown in Fig. 2c, the PSC with the NiOx HTL exhibits no efficiency degradation after air exposure (humidity level: 50–60%) for 4 months without encapsulation. (We note that there is a slight increase of the PCE during the first few days of aging, and we speculate that oxygen molecules in air may have modified the surface stoichiometry of NiOx, which could improve the hole transport and extraction processes by altering the surface defect states.) More importantly, the thermal stability of the PSCs is also greatly enhanced. The efficiency of the device remains constant after 13 hours of continuous heating at 85 °C (Fig. 2d). In contrast, the efficiency of the PSCs with spiro-MeOTAD or the CuSCN HTL decreases to less than 60% or 50% of its initial value after the same heating process. According to previous studies, the degradation of these cells under heating conditions is due to the development of morphological defects at the spiro-MeOTAD/perovskite interface26 or reaction between perovskite and CuSCN.16 Note that under practical application conditions, the temperature of the solar panels can reach as high as 85 °C due to direct exposure of the solar panels to sunlight and local heating;27 thus the thermal stability improvement induced by the NiOx HTL is crucial for extending the lifetime of the PSCs.
Interface engineering of NiOx-based PSCs
Although the PSCs with the NiOx HTL demonstrate excellent air stability and thermal stability, they exhibit considerably lower efficiencies than PSCs with a spiro-MeOTAD HTL (Fig. S4†). The limited efficiency may originate from the poor conductivity of the bulk NiOx film or the charge recombination processes induced by the oxide surface defect states (note that the hydroxyl groups on the NiOx surface may behave as recombination centers23,25). To eliminate such limitations induced by the NiOx film, we spin-coated a thin interfacial HTL, composed of either spiro-MeOTAD or CuSCN, on top of the NiOx layer to form the PSCs. Such a modification significantly improves the device performance, especially the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF), as shown in Table 2. Fig. 3a and b display the current density–voltage (J–V) curves and the stabilized current density and efficiency output of the best performing PSCs, revealing a stabilized efficiency of 14.4% for the NiOx/CuSCN-based PSC and 16.3% for the NiOx/spiro-MeOTAD-based PSC. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra are presented in Fig. S5,† which confirm the enhanced photocurrent generation in the PSCs with the hybrid HTLs. The air stability of the PSCs is also examined, as shown in Fig. 3c and S6.† Firstly, the PSCs with the NiOx/spiro-MeOTAD hybrid HTL show much better air stability as compared to the cells with a single spiro-MeOTAD HTL, which illustrates the importance of avoiding direct contact between the perovskite and spiro-MeOTAD to reduce the moisture induced interface degradation. Secondly, the PSCs with the NiOx/CuSCN all-inorganic HTL exhibit no efficiency degradation after being exposed to air (humidity: 50–60%) for 4 months without encapsulation.

Mechanism study for the improved performance by the interfacial layer
It is intriguing that the addition of the interfacial HTL drastically improved the PSC performance. To figure out the underlying mechanism of the efficiency improvement, we first extracted the series resistances (Rs) and the shunt resistances (Rsh) of the PSCs from the dark J–V curves.28,29 As summarized in Table 3, the Rsh is increased by about 50% from the single NiOx HTL device to the hybrid HTL devices, while the Rs is reduced by almost 5 times from NiOx to NiOx/CuSCN and 7 times from NiOx to NiOx/spiro-MeOTAD. We further measured the capacitance–voltage (C–V) characteristics and recombination resistance (Rrec) of the PSCs at different applied voltages. The Mott–Schottky curves in Fig. 4a show an increased built-in potential (Vbi) of the PSCs with the hybrid HTLs, and correspondingly, the Rrec values of these PSCs (shown in Fig. 4b) are also improved as compared to that of the single layer device. The enhanced Vbi and Rrec indicate reduced charge recombination in the device, which may account for the improved Voc obtained from the hybrid HTL devices. Microscopically, the interfacial layer may shut off the charge recombination paths in the PSCs by either passivating the surface defects on the NiOx NPs or preventing the formation of metal filaments (at the grain boundaries of NPs) during the evaporation of the top electrode.

The reduced current leakage and charge recombination paths could account for the improved Rsh. On the other hand, the drastically reduced Rs must be associated with other mechanisms. We therefore measured the conductivity of the NiOx film as well as NiOx/CuSCN and NiOx/spiro-MeOTAD hybrid films (Fig. 4c and Table S1†) by depositing the films on a pair of patterned metal electrodes. It was found that the pure NiOx film exhibits very low conductivity (around 7.31 × 10−8 S cm−1), in accordance with the result of a previous report.30 In contrast, the conductivities of the NiOx/CuSCN and NiOx/spiro-MeOTAD hybrid films are 3 to 4 orders higher than that of the single NiOx layer. There are two possible reasons for such conductivity enhancement: (1) doping of the NiOx film by the interfacial layer, and (2) increased charge percolation paths through the interfacial layer (as illustrated in Fig. 4d).
To evaluate which mechanism is dominant, we performed UPS measurements on the NiOx/CuSCN films. Note that the doping of NiOx should result in a shift of its Fermi level relative to the VBM. Accordingly, we measured the UPS depth profile of the NiOx/CuSCN film by gradually removing the material from the top to the bottom. The total thickness of the hybrid film is estimated to be around 80 nm, which is also confirmed by the SEM image of the cross section of the FTO/TiO2/perovskite/NiOx/CuSCN structure (Fig. S7†). The measurement results and the corresponding energy level diagrams at different depths (marked the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th levels) of the NiOx/CuSCN layer structure are presented in Fig. 5. Here the energy offsets between the Fermi level and the VBM were determined from the onsets of the UPS spectra. As shown in Fig. 5b, from the 1st to the 4th depth level, the intensity of the Cu 3d peak (labeled based on previous studies31,32) slowly decreases while the Ni 3d level33,34 gradually increases, suggesting an interpenetrating morphology formed by NiOx NPs and CuSCN below the surface CuSCN capping layer. On the other hand, the energy offsets between the Fermi level and the VBM remain unchanged at different levels as the NiOx emerges, and are equal to that of the pure NiOx film (Fig. S2†), suggesting that there is no doping effect of CuSCN on the NiOx film. We therefore propose that the improved conductivity of the NiOx-based hybrid HTLs is mainly due to the increased charge percolation paths through the interfacial layer. Note that in our device fabrication process, a low annealing temperature is applied to the NiOx film, which may result in insufficient sintering of the NPs. Having a secondary conduction medium to bridge the NPs together is thus critical for improving the conductivity of the film.

Experimental
Materials
TiO2 paste, NH2CH = NH2I (FAI) and CH3NH3Br (MABr) were purchased from Dyesol; TiCl4 was purchased from Aladdin, and the NiOx nanoparticle (NP) suspension was purchased from Nanograde; and all the other chemical materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received unless stated otherwise.
Solvent exchange for the NiOx NP suspension
NiOx NPs are initially dispersed in ethanol, and the NiOx NP suspension is centrifuged at 10000 rpm with a centrifuge machine (TG16-WS) to remove the ethanol. The precipitate is then redispersed in 1-butanol with an ultrasonic machine (CREST CP230T), and the obtained NiOx NP suspension is filtered through a 0.2 μm PTFE filter.
Solar cell fabrication
The treatment for FTO (DHS-FTO22-15N, HeptaChroma) substrates and the fabrication process for the compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) and mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) electron transport layers were the same as those in our previous work.10 For the fabrication of the perovskite layer, 1.2M PbI2/PbBr2 (molar ratio of PbI2/PbBr2 is 85/15) in DMF/DMSO (volume ratio of DMF/DMSO is 80/20) precursor solution was spin-coated on the m-TiO2 substrates at 1000 rpm for 3 s and 4000 rpm for 30 s and annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. After cooling to room temperature, 150 μl of 0.1 mol l−1 FAI/MABr in 2-propanol solution was loaded on the PbI2/PbBr2 film for 1 min (loading time), which was then spun at 4000 rpm for 20 s and dried at 100 °C for 30 min. For the fabrication of the NiOx layer, the NiOx nanoparticle suspension (1-butanol as the dispersant) with different concentrations (3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 mg ml−1) was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s. For the preparation of the single spiro-MeOTAD layer, the precursor solution, consisting of 72.3 mg of spiro-MeOTAD, 28.8 μl of 4-tert-butylpyridine and 17.5 μl of lithium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) solution (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 ml acetonitrile) in 1 ml chlorobenzene, was spin-coated on the perovskite layer at 4000 rpm for 30 s. In terms of the preparation of the NiOx/spiro-MeOTAD hybrid layer, the spiro-MeOTAD precursor solution with different concentrations (10, 30, 50, and 70 mg ml−1) was spin-coated on the NiOx layer. For the fabrication of the NiOx/CuSCN hybrid layer, CuSCN in diethyl sulfide with different concentrations (5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 mg ml−1) was spun onto the perovskite layer at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and then was annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. Finally, 80 nm-thick gold was deposited via thermal evaporation.
Measurement and characterization
The film morphologies and the cross section of the device structure were observed by HR-FESEM (FEI, Quanta 400). Elemental mapping was performed by using a field-emission scanning electron microscope (Nova NanoSEM 450, FEI) combined with an energy dispersive spectrometer (X-Max50, Oxford Instruments) with a 5 or 10 kV accelerating voltage. The NiOx nanoparticles were observed using a Tecnai Spirit transmission electron microscope (TEM). The Fermi level, valence band maximum and chemical composition of the NiOx films were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ESCALAB 250, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were measured (Keithley Instruments, 2612 Series SourceMeter) under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2) generated by a 94011A-ES Sol series Solar Simulator. The capacitance−voltage (C–V) characteristic was measured using an HP Hewlett Packard 4248A. The impedance measurements were conducted using a Bio-logic SP200 potentiostat under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight (100 mW cm−2) with different bias voltages (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 V), an oscillating voltage of 10 mV and a frequency of 0.5 Hz to 1 MHz. The external quantum efficiency was measured with a Source Meter (Keithley 2400) under monochromatic illumination, which was generated by passing the light beam from a 250 W quartz tungsten halogen lamp into a Newport 74215 Oriel Cornerstone 260 1/4 m monochromator. A calibrated silicon diode with a known spectral response was used as a reference. The conductivity of the films was measured by using Au interdigitated electrodes with a gap 3 μm in width and 1000 μm in length, and the thickness of the films was measured using an Alpha step 500 Surface profiler. Ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS) characterization of the NiOx/CuSCN hybrid layer was performed at BL09A2 U5 (National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center, Taiwan) with an incident photon energy of 130 eV, and the Fermi level was calibrated using an Au sample. The sample of the NiOx/CuSCN hybrid layer was gradually sputtered off with argon ions between consecutive measurements to obtain a depth profile.
Conclusion
In summary, we demonstrated air-stable, normal structure PSCs by enabling the direct deposition of a NiOx nanoparticle (NP) film on a perovskite layer via a low-temperature process. The NiOx NP film exhibits a uniform and dense morphology, which greatly improves the air stability and thermal stability of the PSCs. We further found that by introducing an interfacial layer (e.g. spiro-MeOTAD or CuSCN) between the NiOx film and the top metal electrode, the PCE of the PSCs can be largely improved from 10.4% to 17.2%, while the excellent air stability is maintained. The beneficial effects of the interfacial layer on the device performance are ascribed to two reasons: firstly, the layer may shut off the charge recombination paths in the PSCs by either passivating the surface defects on the NiOx NPs or preventing the formation of metal filaments (at the grain boundaries of NPs) during the evaporation of the top electrode; secondly, the interpenetrating morphology formed by NiOx NPs and the interfacial layer material increases charge percolation paths and thus improves the overall conductivity of the HTL. The low-temperature NiOx deposition method developed here can be extended to other metal oxide particle systems, enabling the fabrication of stable perovskite solar cells as well as other electronic devices, such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
