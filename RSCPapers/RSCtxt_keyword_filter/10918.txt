E-mail: sanand@nitt.edu; sanand99@yahoo.comReceived 8th June 2013, Accepted 29th August 2013First published on 30th August 2013AbstractThe design and synthesis of two new metal-free bibridged bianchoring ambipolar dyes (D–(π–A)2) by linking electron-donating triphenyl amine or phenoxazine and electron-accepting cyanoacetic acid through a cyanovinyl thiophene π-bridge for fabrication of metal-free, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The structures of the synthesized dyes were confirmed by NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Experimental and theoretical (DFT) approaches revealed that the phenoxazine (POX-th-CN) dye exhibits a lower band gap (2.03 eV) compared to the triphenyl amine (TPA-th-CN) dye (2.19 eV). Due to this lower band gap, the electronic absorption of the phenoxazine dye becomes red-shifted, and, in addition, the fabricated dye-sensitized solar cell device based on this dye shows higher current conversion efficiencies (η = 1.78%) compared to the TPA-th-CN dye.IntroductionIntensive research on dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) has been undertaken in recent years due to their low cost, and their lightweight and flexible power production applications compared to conventional p–n junction solar cells.1 The alternative generation of a new type of sensitizer based on metal and metal-free dyes has been continuously in progress to reach the high standards, particularly in terms of efficiency and stability, of the earlier DSSCs.2–5 In particular, research on metal-free dyes which have the general structure of a donor–π-bridge–acceptor (D–π–A) is presently attracting a great deal of interest, due to their high molar extinction coefficient, their simple synthesis procedure, and their environmental friendliness.6–8 Upon illumination, D–π–A dyes absorb light, which is followed by an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from D to A through the π-bridge. From the acceptor moiety, electrons are then injected to the semiconductor nanoparticles, which are chemisorbed by the acceptors.9 The absorption, ICT properties and efficiencies of the dyes can be tuned through chemical and structural modification by altering the donor, π-bridge and acceptor moieties.Generally, triphenylamine, phenoxazine, phenothiazine, carbazole, diphenylamine, coumarin, indoline, and tetrahydroquinoline10,11 are promising electron donor moieties for DSSCs. Recently, considerable attention has been paid towards the exploration of triphenylamine-12,13 and phenoxazine14-based chromophores for DSSCs due to their potential electron-donating ability and their hole-transport properties. In addition, fabricated DSSCs with triphenylamine15 and phenoxazine16 donors show an efficiency of about 5.5% and 4.4%. Besides the use of triphenylamine and phenoxazine as electron donors for the sensitizer, many research groups have synthesized bianchoring organic materials with a double π-bridge (D–(π–A)2) charge transporting character for the development of highly efficient DSSCs.15,17–19 Such materials can provide extended π-conjugation which increases the ICT properties and multilinking abilities of devices, while enhancing their stability and efficiency, compared to their monoanchoring counterparts.15,20,21 Furthermore, in recent years, a series of bianchoring metal-free dyes based on donor (carbazole and diphenylamine), π-linker (cyanovinyl thiophene and cyanovinyl biphenyl) and acceptor (cyanoacetic acid and rhodanine-3-acetic acid) moieties were synthesized to fabricate DSSCs which show efficiencies in the range 0.56–4.04%.22,23 Following on from this, the replacement of carbazole and diphenylamine donors with triphenyl amine and phenoxazine was carried out, in order to specifically alter the HOMO energy levels and to shift their absorption behavior to the red region, which plays a crucial role in determining the overall conversion efficiency.24,25 Hence, bibridged bianchoring metal-free dyes, namely (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(5,5′-(1E,1'E)-2,2′-(4,4′-(phenylazanediyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(1-cyanoethene-2,1-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2-cyanoacrylic acid) (TPA-th-CN) and (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(5,5′-(1E,1′E)-2,2′-(10-hexyl-10H-phenoxazine-3,7-diyl)bis(1-cyanoethene-2,1-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2-cyanoacrylic acid) (POX-th-CN) (Scheme 1), based on using triphenylamine or phenoxazine as a donor, using cyanovinyl thiophene as a π-linker and using cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor, were synthesized and characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The electronic and structural properties of the synthesized dyes were investigated by UV-Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy, while the HOMO and LUMO energy levels were calculated using cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT). Finally, the synthesized dyes are used for the fabrication of DSSCs. Scheme 1  Synthetic pathway of the organic dyes: (i) POCl3, DMF, 95 °C, 4 h stirring (yield: 54% for 1a and 59% for 2a). (ii) 2-(Thiophen-2-yl)-acetonitrile, 6 M NaOH, ethanol, 2 h refluxed (yield: 60% for 1b and 80% for 2b). (iii) POCl3, DMF, 95 °C, 4 h stirring (yield: 32% for 1c and 30% for 2c). (iv) Cyanoacetic acid, piperidine, acetonitrile, 12–24 h refluxed (yield: 20% for POX-th-CN and 18% for TPA-th-CN). Synthesis and characterization of materialsThe synthetic pathways of the organic dyes POX-th-CN and TPA-th-CN are depicted in Scheme 1. The Vilsmeier–Haack formylation of hexylated phenoxazine (1) and triphenylamine (2) gave the aldehyde compounds 10-hexyl-10H-phenoxazine-3,7-dicarbaldehyde (1a) and 4,4′-diformaltriphenylamine (2a), respectively. The synthesized aldehydes (1a and 2a) were coupled with the active methylene compound thiophene-2-acetonitrile by Knoevenagel condensation to yield (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(10-hexyl-10H-phenoxazine-3,7-diyl)bis(2-(thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile) (1b) and (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(4,4′-(phenylazanediyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(2-(thiophen-2-yl)acrylonitrile) (2b), respectively. These then undergo the Vilsmeier–Haack formylation reaction followed by Knoevenagel condensation with cyanoacetic acid to give the final products (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(5,5′-(1E,1′E)-2,2′-(10-hexyl-10H-phenoxazine-3,7-diyl)bis(1-cyanoethene-2,1-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2-cyanoacrylic acid) (POX-th-CN) and (2E,2′E)-3,3′-(5,5′-(1E,1′E)-2,2′-(4,4′-(phenylazanediyl)bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(1-cyanoethene-2,1-diyl)bis(thiophene-5,2-diyl))bis(2-cyanoacrylic acid) (TPA-th-CN). The synthesized dyes were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. The 1H NMR spectrum of the synthesized dye POX-th-CN in DMSO-d6 solvent shows the chemical shift (δ) of hexyl chain protons at 0.92–1.98 ppm and the methylamine protons (–CH2N–) in the hexyl chain show a triplet at 4.32 ppm. In addition, the aromatic phenyl protons, thiophene ring protons, and vinyl protons adjacent to the phenyl and thiophene rings, appear at 7.26–8.47 ppm. The 13C NMR spectrum of POX-th-CN in DMSO-d6 solvent shows the chemical shift (δ) of hexyl chain carbons at 14.11–31.59 ppm and the methylamine carbon (–CH2N–) in the hexyl chain at 44.86 ppm. In addition, the aromatic phenyl carbons, thiophene ring carbons, and vinyl carbons adjacent to the phenyl and thiophene rings, appear at 91.93–145.07 ppm. The carboxylic acid carbons in the cyanoacrylic acid groups (–COOH) appear at 160.74 ppm. Similarly, the 1H NMR spectrum of the synthesized TPA-th-CN dye in DMSO-d6 solvent shows the chemical shift (δ) of the aromatic phenyl protons, thiophene ring protons, and vinyl protons adjacent to the phenyl and thiophene rings, at 7.19–8.16 ppm and the 13C NMR spectrum of the TPA-th-CN dye in DMSO-d6 solvent shows the chemical shift (δ) of aromatic phenyl carbons, thiophene ring carbons, and vinyl carbons adjacent to the phenyl and thiophene rings, appear at 108.09–146.92 ppm. The carboxylic acid carbons in the cyanoacrylic acid groups (–COOH) appear at 159.53 ppm. Thus, from the 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral data described in the Experimental section, the assigned peaks are found to be consistent with the proposed structure.Optical characteristicsThe absorption and emission spectra of the synthesized dyes TPA-th-CN and POX-th-CN in DMF solution (3 × 10−4 M) are shown in Fig. 1 and their data are depicted in Table 1. TPA-th-CN and POX-th-CN show two absorbance bands in solution (a high energy peak at 354 nm and 378 nm followed by a low energy peak at 485 nm and 518 nm) probably arising from the π–π* transition and intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) transition from donor amine to cyanoacrylic acid acceptor, respectively. To confirm the ICT properties, the absorption behaviour of the preliminary compounds 1c and 2c was investigated and compared with the POX-th-CN and TPA-th-CN compounds, respectively26 (Fig. S1†).

This is due to the high electron-donating ability of phenoxazine, which induces the electronic transition probability in conjugated dipolar systems.27,28However, the absorption spectrum of the dyes on a TiO2 surface (Fig. 2) shows a blue-shifted wavelength maximum and a broadened longer wavelength, compared to solution spectra, due to the H-aggregation of dyes on the TiO2 surface and dye–dye or dye–TiO2 interactions, respectively.29,30 In addition, these donors (triphenyl amine (TPA) and phenoxazine (POX)) act as good light absorbers compared to the donors carbazole (Car) and diphenylamine (Dpa).22,23 The fluorescence emission spectra of triphenylamine and phenoxazine derivatives in DMF solution, recorded at their excitation wavelength, show emission wavelengths at 617 nm (λex = 510 nm) and 682 nm (λex = 590 nm), respectively. Fig. 2  Absorption spectra of TPA-th-CN and POX-th-CN dyes adsorbed on nanocrystalline TiO2 films. Electrochemical characteristicsThe electron injection from the excited dye to the conduction band (CB) of the semiconductor nanoparticles, and the dye regeneration through the electrolytes, mainly depends on the LUMO energy level relative to the reduction potential and the HOMO energy level relative to the oxidation potential of the dyes, respectively. The conduction band energy level of TiO2 (−4.0 eV vs. vacuum) is generally lower than the LUMO level of the dye for electron injection, while the redox potential of the electrolyte (I−/I3− is −4.6 eV vs. vacuum) is generally higher than the HOMO level of the dye for regeneration of the oxidized dye molecule by iodide ion (I−), thereby avoiding the charge recombination between the oxidized dye molecules and the photo-injected electrons in the nanocrystalline TiO2 film.10 The oxidation peak potentials of TPA-th-CN and POX-th-CN dyes were determined by cyclic voltammetry, by comparison with ferrocene (Fc; 4.8 eV)31 in a DMF medium (Fig. 3), and the corresponding data are shown in Table 1. A cyclic voltammogram of both dyes (Fig. 3) showed one quasi-reversible oxidation peak due to the electron-donating ability of the triphenyl amine (1.10 V) and phenoxazine (0.79 V) groups, and one irreversible reduction peak due to the electron-withdrawing ability of the cyanoacrylic acid group (−0.02 V in TPA-th-CN and −0.01 V in POX-th-CN). The oxidation potentials of TPA-th-CN and POX-th-CN, namely 1.10 V and 0.79 V vs. Ag/AgCl(aq.), determined from the intersection of two tangents drawn at the rising current and background charging current of a cyclic voltammogram, may be due to the electron-donating ability of triphenyl amine and phenoxazine. The lower oxidation potential of the phenoxazine-based dye indicates that phenoxazine is a good electron donor compared to triphenyl amine.32 The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the synthesized dyes were calculated based on the relationship mentioned in the ESI.†33 The lower HOMO energy levels of POX-th-CN (−5.14 eV) compared to TPA-th-CN (−5.45 eV) indicates the effective regeneration of the dye from the redox electrolyte, which, in turn, may improve the device efficiency.34 The LUMO levels of the dyes were calculated to be −3.26 eV for TPA-th-CN and −3.11 eV for POX-th-CN, as determined by subtracting the band gap (estimated by the intersection between the absorption and emission spectra) from the HOMO levels.33 Fig. 3  Cyclic voltammogram measured in DMF (3 × 10−4 M) of POX-th-CN and TPA-th-CN at a Pt working electrode, glassy carbon counter electrode and Ag/Ag+ reference electrode (0.1 M TBAP as an electrolyte; scan rate 0.1 V s−1). The band gap of POX-th-CN is smaller than that of TPA-th-CN; this lowers the HOMO–LUMO energy band gap, which in turn shifts the absorption region towards a longer wavelength of the solar spectrum.35 Thus, LUMO and HOMO values are in good agreement with the energy levels of the TiO2 conduction band and the electrolyte redox potential, respectively, as shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4  Schematic of the experimental energy levels of the dyes and the frontier molecular orbitals HOMO and LUMO, using the B3LYP/6-31G (d) model. Theoretical characteristics using DFT calculationThe optimized electronic structures and frontier molecular orbital diagrams of the synthesized dyes were determined using density functional theory (DFT) (the B3LYP/6-31G (d) basis set with the Gaussian 09 program package) and are shown in Fig. 5. In both TPA-th-CN and POX-th-CN, the HOMO is mainly populated over the amine and cyanovinyl thiophene blocks with considerable contribution from the former, whereas LUMO is delocalized through the cyanovinyl thiophene and cyanoacrylic acid fragments with a sizable contribution from the latter. The LUMO of the π-bridge is similar to the HOMO of the dyes, but the lobes do not align. This spatial separation in HOMO and LUMO orbitals through the π-bridge is an important characteristic for D–π–A organic dyes in DSSCs because this structural feature will induce the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) from donor to acceptor groups under illumination, and will increase the interfacial electron injection from the organic dye to the semiconductor nanoparticles.36 Thus, the theoretically calculated HOMO, LUMO and band gap energy levels are in good agreement with the experimental values (see Table 1). Fig. 5  The optimized structure and frontier orbitals of the POX-th-CN and TPA-th-CN dyes calculated with the B3LYP/6-31G (d) basis set. Photovoltaic characteristicsThe current–voltage characteristics of DSSCs fabricated using synthesized organic dyes (TPA-th-CN and POX-th-CN) as sensitizers of type FTO/TiO2/dye/liquid electrolyte/Pt/FTO were measured under simulated AM 1.5 irradiation (85 mW cm−2) and the calculated data such as short-circuit photocurrent density (JSC), open circuit photovoltage (VOC), and fill factor (FF) are shown in Fig. 6 and summarized in Table 2. The fabricated device based on the POX-th-CN dye exhibits a short circuit current density (JSC) of 7.4 mA cm−2, an open circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 631 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.32%. Similarly, the device based on the TPA-th-CN dye exhibits a short circuit current density (JSC) of 4.7 mA cm−2, an open circuit photovoltage (VOC) of 500 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.48%. The efficiency (η), which was calculated using the following equation: η = JSC × VOC × FF/light intensity, of POX-th-CN is 1.78% and is 1.32% for TPA-th-CN. The reason for the lower efficiency of these dye-based devices is due to their lower fill factor.37 The higher efficiency of the phenoxazine dye compared to the triphenyl amine dye may be due to the absorption red shift as well as the low band gap property of the phenoxazine dye.28 The incident photon-to-current conversion efficiencies (IPCEs) as a function of wavelength for POX-th-CN and TPA-th-CN are presented in Fig. 7. Fabricated solar cells based on the dyes exhibited a broad IPCE spectrum from 350 to 700 nm. POX-th-CN showed an IPCE value of 57.5% at 440 nm and 32% at 535 nm, whereas TPA-th-CN showed an IPCE value of 48.0% at 475 nm. Compared to triphenyl amine-based devices, phenoxazine-based devices exhibited a broader wavelength IPCE spectrum, similar to the absorption spectrum for the dye adsorbed on TiO2 film (Fig. 2). Thus, the longer wavelength absorption region favors the light-harvesting ability and increases the photocurrent response on the POX-th-CN DSSC device. The adsorbed dye amount (Γ) on the TiO2 surface was calculated to correlate the efficiency of the devices by desorbing the dye from the TiO2 surface using 0.1 M NaOH in a DMF–H2O (1:1) mixture.38 This indicates that phenoxazine-based dyes are adsorbed to a greater extent than triphenyl amine-based dyes due to the presence of a hexyl substituent in POX-th-CN, which induces the controlled aggregation of dyes on a TiO2 surface.39 Fig. 6  Current density–voltage characteristics for POX-th-CN- and TPA-th-CN-based devices for DSSCs under illumination by simulated solar light (AM 1.5, 85 mW cm−2).

Electrochemical impedance characteristicsTo further understand the internal resistances for the charge transfer processes such as the charge recombination at the TiO2/dye/electrolyte interface, electron transport in the TiO2 electrode, electron transfer at the Pt counter electrode and I−/I3− transport at the electrolyte were measured using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)40 at VOC under AM 1.5 with a frequency range of 100–104 Hz. As shown in Nyquist plots (Fig. 8A), the radius of the middle semicircle is in the order of POX-th-CN < TPA-th-CN, indicating that the electron transport is in the order of TPA-th-CN < POX-th-CN, which is reflected in the efficiency of the devices.41 The electron lifetimes (τeff) in the TiO2 conduction band were calculated from the Bode phase plots (Fig. 8B) using the following equation:42τeff = 1/2πf, where f is the frequency peak in the Bode phase plot. The electron lifetime was calculated for the POX-th-CN device (9.10 ms) and the TPA-th-CN device (2.21 ms) from the corresponding frequency peak maxima in the Bode phase plot. Thus, the higher electron lifetime in the TiO2 conduction band for the POX-th-CN device indicates the inhibition of the electron recombination to the I3− ions, which thereby enhances the device efficiency compared to that of the TPA-th-CN device.23 Fig. 8  EIS spectra of DSSCs based on POX-th-CN and TPA-th-CN dyes measured at VOC, 85 mW cm−2. (A) Nyquist plots. (B) Bode phase plots. FTIR characteristicsTo understand the adsorption behavior of the synthesized dyes (POX-th-CN and TPA-th-CN) on the TiO2 nanoparticles for the interfacial electron injection, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed in ATR mode (Fig. S2(A) & (B)†). The ATR-FTIR spectrum of both dye molecules shows the characteristic peaks of the –CN and –CO of the carboxylic acid group at 2210 cm−1 and 1738 cm−1 for POX-th-CN, and 2209 cm−1 and 1732 cm−1 for TPA-th-CN, respectively. The large broad peak above 3000 cm−1 is due to the adsorbed moisture and –OH stretching of the carboxylic acid group. Conversely, for the dye-adsorbed TiO2 films, the –CO stretching band at around 1730 cm−1 had disappeared and a new band appeared at 1583 cm−1, indicating the nature of dye binding on the TiO2 surface via the bidentate carboxylate (–O–C–O–) due to the deprotonation of the –COOH group.43 In addition, observed peak broadening also suggests that dye–TiO2 interactions have occurred.44Experimental sectionMaterialsAll reagents and chemicals were purchased from Alfa Aesar and Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification unless specified otherwise. All solvents were dried by refluxing for at least 24 h over CaH2 and freshly distilled prior to use. All column chromatographic separations were carried out on Merck silica gel (60–120 mesh). Fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass plates (sheet resistance 10 Ω □−1) were purchased from BHEL, India. The photoanode was prepared using the following procedure:45 the glacial acetic acid (5 mL), 7.5 mL of tetraisopropyl titanate (C12H28O4Ti) and one drop of Triton X-100 were mixed with 15 mL of 2-propanol. Water (5 mL) was added to the above solution drop-wise while vigorously stirring the solution. The resulting semi-colloidal suspension was dispersed on an FTO glass plate by a glass rod using a doctor blade technique. The loose crust on the TiO2 film was removed by wiping smoothly with cotton wool. The thickness of the TiO2 film was controlled by repeating the coating procedure as necessary. It was then sintered at 450 °C for 1 h to remove the binder and solvent, and to give an electrically-connected network of TiO2 particles, under a tubular furnace. After the sintering process, when the temperature of the plate dropped to between 50 and 70 °C, it was immersed in the dye solution for 24 h. Excess non-adsorbed dye was washed with anhydrous ethanol. The platinum catalyst counter electrode was prepared by deposition of H2PtCl6·6H2O solution (0.005 mol dm−3 in isopropanol) onto FTO glass, followed by sintering at 400 °C for 20 min.46 The DSSC device was fabricated by the following method: the photocathode was placed on top of the photoanode and was tightly clipped together. Then, the liquid electrolyte 0.05 M I2/0.5 M KI/0.5 M 4-tert-butyl pyridine (TBP) in 3-methoxypropionitrile was injected between the two electrodes.Instruments1H and 13C NMR spectra were obtained using a 300/400 MHz BRUKER spectrometer in deuterated chloroform or dimethylsulfoxide solution at 298 K. Chemical shifts (δ values) were recorded in units of ppm relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS) as an internal standard. The molecular weights of the dyes were determined by a Micromass QUATTRO 11 ESI-MS spectrometer coupled to a Hewlett Packard series 1100 degasser. Elemental analyses were performed on a Vario EL III elemental analyzer. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were measured in DMF solution on a T90+ UV-Vis spectrometer and a Shimadzu RF-5301 PC spectrofluorophotometer, respectively. Electrochemical measurements were performed on a Metrohm Autolab PGSTAT potentiostat/galvanostat-84610. All measurements were carried out at room temperature with a conventional three-electrode configuration consisting of a platinum disc working electrode, a glassy carbon (GC) auxiliary electrode, and Ag/AgCl(aq.) was used as the reference electrode. The potentials were reported vs. ferrocene as standard, using a scan rate of 0.1 V s−1. The sample solutions contained 3 × 10−4 M sample and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) in anhydrous DMF as a supporting electrolyte under argon atmosphere. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements were done under 85 mW cm−2 light illumination by using an Autolab PGSTAT potentiostat/galvanostat-84610. The impedance spectra were recorded with a frequency ranging between 10 kHz and 1 Hz at their open circuit potential (OCP). The IPCE spectra were recorded using an Oriel 300 W Xe arc lamp in combination with an Oriel Cornerstone 260¼ monochromator. The number of incident photons was calculated for each wavelength using a calibrated monocrystalline silicon diode as a reference. ATR-FTIR spectra were measured with a Thermo spectrophotometer system equipped with a ZnSe prism.SynthesisSynthesis of 10-hexyl-10H-phenoxazine (1)1-Bromohexane (2.2 g, 0.01308 mol), phenoxazine (2.0 g, 0.0109 mol) and potassium hydroxide (0.734 g, 0.01308 mol) were added to 26 mL of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and the reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h at RT. After identifying the completion of the reaction using TLC, the resulting mixture was extracted with dichloromethane (DCM)–water and the organic portion was then dried with Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated and the resulting dark brown liquid was purified by column chromatography on silica, using hexane as a solvent, to give a colorless liquid (yield: 63.4%; 1.85 g). 1H NMR (CDCl3, ppm): δ 6.80–6.76 (m, 2H), 6.63–6.60 (m, 4H), 6.46 (d, 2H, J = 8 Hz), 3.46 (t, 2H, J = 8 Hz), 1.68–1.56 (m, 2H), 1.43–1.34 (m, 6H), 0.92 (t, 3H, J = 7.2 Hz).Synthesis of 10-hexyl-10H-phenoxazine-3,7-dicarbaldehyde (1a)Freshly distilled POCl3 (17.4 mL, 25 eq.) was added drop-wise to DMF (13.3 mL, 23 eq.) under a N2 atmosphere at 0 °C, and then the solution was stirred for 1 h. Compound 1 (2 g, 7.48 mmol) was added to the above solution, and the resulting mixture was stirred for 4 h at 95 °C. After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was poured into a beaker containing ice-cubes, and basified with 4 M NaOH. The solid was filtered and extracted with ethylacetate (EA)–brine.

Found: 701.17 [M]+.ConclusionIn conclusion, we have designed and synthesized here two new bibridged bianchoring metal-free dyes based on phenoxazine and triphenyl amine as donors, cyanovinyl thiophene as a π-linker and cyanoacrylic acid as an acceptor for DSSC applications. Among the two dyes (POX-th-CN and TPA-th-CN), the phenoxazine-based dye exhibits a higher power conversion efficiency. This is due to the higher electron-donating ability of phenoxazine compared to triphenyl amine, as the former has electron-rich nitrogen and oxygen atoms, while the latter has only nitrogen atoms. This property is also responsible for a reduced band gap, as well as increased light-harvesting ability in the red region of the spectrum. Consequently, the HOMO energy level is close to the redox potential of the electrolytes for effective dye regeneration, and there is an increased electron lifetime in the TiO2 conduction band. The lower efficiency of these devices compared to already available devices may be due to their lower fill factor, which could be rectified by adding appropriate electrolytes.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank DST, New Delhi (SR/S1/PC-49/2009) for sanctioning this major research project, and the India–Spain Joint Collaborative project (DST/INT/Spain/P-37/11).ReferencesB.
