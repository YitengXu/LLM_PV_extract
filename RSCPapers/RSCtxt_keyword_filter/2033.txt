    , Accepted 23rd December 2020First published on 31st December 2020AbstractWe synthesize a pair of regioisomer-free selenophene-containing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) (TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl), which have an identical indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene core and two types of monochlorinated (2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile (INCN) end groups with chlorine substituents at different positions (meta- or para-position relative to the dicyanovinylene moiety), respectively. Compared with TSeIC-M-Cl, TSeIC-P-Cl shows slightly blue-shifted absorption spectra and elevated molecular energy levels owing to the weak electron-withdrawing ability of IC-P-Cl. Besides, owing to the multiple and strong intermolecular Cl⋯H/C and Se⋯π interactions in the single crystal, TSeIC-P-Cl displays three-dimensional molecular packing with a rectangle-like interpenetrating network and a higher degree of π-orbital overlap for charge transport, which results in a higher electron mobility in the film of TSeIC-P-Cl than TSeIC-M-Cl with a linear stacked structure. Moreover, the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl blend film shows better miscibility and forms a nanofibril-like network with suitable phase separation and a preferential face-on orientation. Finally, the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl devices yield 11.26% efficiency, which far outperforms the PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl devices (9.72%). This work highlights that the combination of fusing the selenophene ring on the end of the central core and adjusting the position of the chlorine atom on INCN is an alternative way to multiply modulate the molecular packing, crystallinity and film morphology for efficient regioisomer-free monohalogenated INCN-based NFAs.
Introduction
In the past few years, non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors (NF-SMAs) have attracted considerable attention because of the distinct advantages relative to fullerene and its derivatives, such as an obvious absorption in the visible and near-infrared regions, adjustable molecular energy levels, good solubility in common organic solvents, and ease of synthesis and purification.1–13 Since the concept of acceptor–donor–acceptor (A–D–A) NF-SMAs was presented, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) based on bulk-heterojunction organic solar cells (BHJ-OSCs) have surpassed 16% and some even have reached 17%, which showed great potential for commercialization.14–32
With the significantly improved PCE of A–D–A NF-SMAs, many flexibly modifiable strategies have been applied to design non-conjugated side chains, electron-rich fused-ring cores and electron-deficient terminals to effectively tune the absorption spectrum, molecular energy level and film morphology.33–44 For example, on non-conjugated side chains, after changing the hexyl or hexyloxy from the para-position to the meta-position on phenyl segments, the molecular crystallinity and orientation in neat films would be effectively regulated.45,46 On electron-rich fused-ring cores, the benzene ring of indacenodithiophene (IDT) or indacenodithieno[3,2-b]thiophene (IDTT) was replaced by benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene, fluorene or benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]diselenophene to enhance the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect and the charge transport performance.47–52 Recently, we found that introducing a new fragment indacenodithieno[3,2-b]selenophene (IDTSe) by fusing the selenophene ring on the central core instead of IDTT would also promote the ICT effect, resulting in a redshifted absorption spectrum and a narrow optical bandgap.53 In addition, the selenium atom had strong heteroaromatic interaction and easily polarized electrons in the π-conjugation backbone, therefore fusing the selenophene unit on the central core would be beneficial for efficient charge transport.54,55 Meanwhile, the modification of electron-deficient terminals in A–D–A NF-SMAs also showed a tremendous influence on BHJ-OSCs. The phenyl-fused indanone, thienyl-fused indanone and naphthyl-fused indanone as end groups (EGs) were introduced onto the conjugated framework of A–D–A NF-SMAs to regulate the molecular energy level and the packing behavior.56–62 Besides that, introducing electron-donating or electron-deficient substituents on the above fused-ring EGs was further effective to intensify thise regulation.63–67 And compared with the modification on non-conjugated side chains and electron-rich fused-ring cores, this method gradually attracted great attention because of the obvious advantages, such as simple synthesis and tiny changes in the molecular framework but exerting a great influence on the molecular packing and the optoelectronic properties.68
Although a large amount of work on the modification of EGs has been done, the trade-off between the short circuit current density (JSC) and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) is still a challenge, which immensely limits the further improvement of the performance. Generally, acceptors with dihalogenated or multiply halogenated substituents on (2,3-dihydro-3-oxo-1H-inden-1-ylidene)propanedinitrile (INCN) show relatively redshifted absorption spectra and tend to achieve high JSCs in the corresponding BHJ-OSCs.69–75 Nevertheless, these acceptors were often coupled with downshifted lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and reduced miscibility with donor materials. In contrast, the acceptors with monohalogenated INCN showed elevated LUMO energy levels, resulting in enhanced VOCs in the corresponding devices.76,77 Furthermore, the moderate crystallinity of the acceptors with monohalogenated INCN were favourable for forming good miscibility with the donor to improve the film morphology and the charge transport properties. Unlike the VOC, the JSC was influenced by many factors, such as the absorption spectrum and the film morphology. So the optimized film morphology resulted from the acceptors with monohalogenated INCN were expected to achieve higher JSCs in spite of their relatively blue-shifted absorption spectra than those of acceptors with dihalogenated or multiply halogenated INCN.78,79 For example, Yan and co-workers reported two acceptors, IXIC2Cl and IXIC4Cl, which employed monochlorinated and dichlorinated INCN as the EGs, respectively. IXIC2Cl showed good miscibility with the donor PBDB-T and a better film morphology rather than excessive self-aggregation in the blend film of PBDB-T:IXIC4Cl, which made it achieve a high JSC in the corresponding PBDB-T:IXIC2Cl devices.78 Meanwhile, our group also found that the acceptor BDSeIC2Br with monobrominated INCN achieved a higher JSC and VOC than BDSeIC4Br in OSCs owing to its moderate crystallinity.49 These indicated that the way with monohalogenated substituents on INCN was an alternative pathway to combine the advantages of a suitable molecular energy level and an optimized film morphology, which resulted in an improved VOC without sacrificing the JSC and finally achieving a decent photovoltaic performance.79 However, the acceptors with monohalogenated INCN often exist as regioisomers due to the halogen substituents at the meta- or para-position (relative to the dicyanovinylene moiety) on INCN.80–83 Considering that the adverse film morphology and the disordered molecular orientation that resulted from the mixture of isomers have a negative influence on the photovoltaic performance, it is necessary to obtain regioisomer-free acceptors with monohalogenated INCN for making the relationship between the structure and the performance clear.
On the other hand, as important factors in determining the photovoltaic properties, the molecular packing, crystallinity and film morphology of monohalogenated INCN-based acceptors were influenced not only by isomerizing the substituent position of the halogen atom on EGs, but also by the central electron-rich fused-ring cores, especially the heteroaromatic ring at the end of the core unit, which had an obvious influence on the intermolecular interaction and the packing mode.56 Most reported INCN-based acceptors were focused on the thiophene unit because of its strong intramolecular S⋯O interaction between the core and the EG.19,34,64,66,79,82–86 Compared with the thiophene unit, the selenophene ring had a larger π-orbit and easily polarized electrons in the π-conjugation backbone, which were more beneficial to modulate the absorption spectrum and the molecular energy level.56 Besides, owing to the stronger intra/intermolecular interactions, the synergistic effect of the Se atom and the other heteroatom has been widely applied in a polymer donor to improve the molecular crystallinity and the film morphology.87,88 Nevertheless it has rarely been reported in NF-SMAs. And the synergistic effect that resulted from the Se atom could provide a possibility to form intermolecular interaction between the core and the EG rather than the common weak interaction between the EGs, which will add the degree of π-orbital overlap and improve the ability of charge transport. However, regioisomer-free monohalogenated INCN-based acceptors with fusing the selenophene ring as the end of the central unit have never been reported for high-performance OSCs. This might due to the critical challenge in the synthesis of selenophene-based acceptors and the purification of such monohalogenated INCN-based regioisomeric acceptors. To enrich the pool of high performance monohalogenated INCN-based acceptors, systematical studies on the molecular packing, crystallinity, film morphology and photovoltaic performance of regioisomer-free monohalogenated INCN-based acceptors with fusing the selenophene ring as the end of the central unit are important and desirable for further understanding of the function on regioisomer-free monohalogenated INCN and the selenophene ring.
To address these points, as shown in Fig. 1a, two novel acceptors TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were designed and synthesized with an identical selenophene-containing IDTSe core, but linked with different INCN end groups, which had chlorine substituents at the meta- or para-position relative to the dicyanovinylene moiety (defined as IC-M-Cl or IC-P-Cl), respectively. Compared with TSeIC-M-Cl, TSeIC-P-Cl showed slightly blue-shifted absorption spectra and elevated frontier molecular orbital (FMO) energy levels owing to the weak electron-withdrawing ability of IC-P-Cl. Besides, TSeIC-P-Cl also showed moderate crystallinity and relatively weak molecular aggregation in the neat film. Even so, TSeIC-P-Cl still showed a higher electron mobility in comparison with TSeIC-M-Cl due to its three-dimensional (3D) interpenetrating charge transport feature and a higher degree of π-orbital overlap in the intermolecular packing. Moreover, the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl blend film showed better miscibility and formed suitable nanoscale phase separation with a fibril-like network. Finally, owing to the simultaneously increased JSC and VOC, the optimal PCE of 11.26% was obtained by the devices of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl, which was better than that of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl (9.72%). The enhanced performance of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl was attributed to the higher hole/electron mobilities and a more suitable film morphology with a preferential face-on orientation in the blend film. This result revealed that the combination of fusing the selenophene ring on the end of the central core and properly tailoring the chlorine substituents from the meta-position to the para-position on INCN was a potential way to multiply regulate the molecular crystallinity and the film morphology for improving the PCE.

Results and discussion
The detailed synthetic procedures are shown in Scheme 1. Two EGs IC-M-Cl and IC-P-Cl were synthesized from compound 1. With a dicyanovinylene moiety being added, two divinable isomers were obtained, since the carbonyl groups in compound 1 provided two possible reacting sites. As shown in Fig. S1 (ESI†), thin layer chromatography (TLC) was used to detect the tiny differences in the molecular polarity between IC-M-Cl and IC-P-Cl, which was the first report on finding and distinguishing such regioisomers of monohalogenated EGs by this simple and convenient way. Compared with IC-P-Cl, IC-M-Cl showed a smaller Rf value which implied that IC-M-Cl had a stronger intermolecular interaction than IC-P-Cl. Finally, through silica gel chromatography, IC-M-Cl and IC-P-Cl were separated and then further purified by recrystallization in petroleum ether. The ratio of IC-M-Cl:IC-P-Cl was 1:1.1 calculated from the purified yield. The 1H NMR spectra of IC-M-Cl and IC-P-Cl in the aromatic region are shown in Fig. 2a. IC-M-Cl showed a single peak at 8.60 ppm and double peaks at 7.81/7.79 ppm, while in IC-P-Cl two double peaks at 8.59/8.57 ppm and 7.84/7.82 ppm were observed. The obvious double peaks and larger chemical shifts in the 1H NMR spectrum of IC-P-Cl were due to the tailoring of the chlorine substituents from the meta-position to the para-position on INCN. Besides, since the 1/1′-H were near to the dicyano group which had a stronger electronegativity than the carbonyl group, the chemical shifts of 1/1′-H were larger than those of 3/3′-H. All of these details and the assignment of these peaks are consistent with the reported similar derivatives in the INCN series.64,66 Such results indicated that the two pure EGs were successfully obtained and discriminated. Then by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between the two different EGs (IC-M-Cl or IC-P-Cl) and IDTSe-2CHO,53 TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were prepared with 86% and 83% yields, respectively. Compared with the post-purification method by using the mixture IC-Cl-m and IDTSe-2CHO to obtain the desired acceptors, this pre-purification method was more effective because of the relatively easier way to purify IC-M-Cl and IC-P-Cl compared to the three mixtures of the desired acceptors. All of these acceptors were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and MALDI TOF-MS/ESI-MS (see the ESI†). In particular, as the chemical shifts of 2/2′-H and 6/6′-H were overlapping, the 1H NMR spectra of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl showed seven kinds of peaks with eight types of H in the aromatic region, which are shown in Fig. 2b. TSeIC-P-Cl showed double peaks at 8.60/8.58 ppm and a single peak at 7.80 ppm, which belonged to 1′-H and 3′-H, respectively. Due to the electron-withdrawing properties of the neighboring chlorine atom, the 1-H in TSeIC-M-Cl showed a larger chemical shift than that in TSeIC-P-Cl. Simultaneously, the peak shapes of 1-H and 3-H were also influenced. So, TSeIC-M-Cl displayed a single peak at 8.64 ppm and double peaks at 7.81/7.79 ppm. All of these further proved that the two acceptors TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were propitiously acquired. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out to investigate their thermal stability and the results are shown in Fig. S2 (ESI†). TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl showed decomposition temperatures of 385 and 378 °C, respectively, which were enough for BHJ-OSCs.

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level were performed to investigate the optimized geometries and the distribution of FMOs. As shown in Fig. S3 and S4 (ESI†), both TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl adopt S type molecular conformations, and the total energy of TSeIC-M-Cl was slightly lower than that of TSeIC-P-Cl. Besides, the two acceptors remained planar backbones, and the highest occupied molecular orbitals (HOMOs) were mainly distributed in the IDTSe cores, while the LUMOs were delocalized over the entire molecules with a higher density at the EGs (see Fig. S5, ESI†). The calculated HOMO/LUMO energy levels were −5.53/−3.49 eV for TSeIC-M-Cl and −5.53/−3.48 eV for TSeIC-P-Cl. Furthermore, the half molecular dipole moment was also calculated by the DFT method to investigate the influence with the modification of the substituent position of the chlorine atom on the EGs (see Fig. S6, ESI†). The result showed that the half molecular dipole moment of TSeIC-M-Cl has a larger value (9.62 Debye) than that of TSeIC-P-Cl (8.30 Debye), suggesting a stronger ICT effect in TSeIC-M-Cl. The difference was attributed to the higher electron-withdrawing ability of IC-M-Cl in comparison with IC-P-Cl.
To systematically analyze the differences in the molecular configuration and packing, X-ray crystallographic analysis was performed. Single crystals were obtained by the slow diffusion of n-heptane into their dibromomethane solution and crystallized in the triclinic space group P. The detailed data are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl showed similar molecular geometries in Fig. 3, with the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group on INCN pointing toward the selenium atom of the neighboring selenophene ring. The Se⋯O distances of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were 2.66 and 2.61 Å, respectively, which were less than the sum of the van der Waals radii of Se and O (3.45 Å),89 indicating strong intramolecular interactions between the IDTSe cores and the EGs. Besides, the Se⋯O distances were also less than the distances of S⋯O in the ITIC derivatives (the S⋯O distance of ITIC-2Cl-δ with the chlorine substituents at the meta-position on EGs was 2.72 Å, while that of ITIC-2Cl-γ with the chlorine substituents at the para-position on EGs was 2.65 Å),85 which implied that they formed a closer conformational lock and maintained the stronger structural rigidity in the skeleton of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl. The torsion angles between the IDTSe cores and the EGs were also obtained. As shown in Fig. 3, TSeIC-M-Cl showed a relatively small torsion angle of 0.68°, while that of TSeIC-P-Cl was 6.35°. The bigger torsion angle of TSeIC-P-Cl may be due to the uniquely multiple intermolecular Se⋯π interactions between the IDTSe cores and the EGs (as shown in Fig. S7, ESI†), which made the EGs in TSeIC-P-Cl a bigger skewness along the plane of the IDTSe cores. And it is interesting that the changed trend of the torsion angles about TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl was different from that of the ITIC derivatives (the torsion angle of ITIC-2Cl-δ was 4.51°, while that of ITIC-2Cl-γ was 1.32°),85 indicating the great influence on the torsional degree of the molecular skeleton with the introduction of the selenophene ring replacing the thiophene unit on the end of the central core.
 Fig. 3  Crystallographic structures of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl. The red-, yellow-, purple-, green-, blue- and gray-colored atoms represented O, S, Se, Cl, N and C, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse lengths, the intramolecular Se⋯O distances, and torsion angles between the IDTSe cores and the EGs were also illustrating. The para-hexyl phenyl side chains were replaced by the para-methyl phenyl side chains for clarity. 
The packing structures of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl are shown in Fig. 4a. Both TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl showed antiparallel slipped stackings in their single crystals. Due to the four phenyl substituents perpendicularly distributed on each molecule, no obvious intermolecular interaction between the central IDTSe units of the two neighboring acceptors was found, while in TSeIC-M-Cl, substantial π–π interactions between the EGs were observed with π–π stacking distances of 3.29/3.40 Å. Compared with TSeIC-M-Cl, TSeIC-P-Cl showed loose π–π stacking with the distances of 3.33/3.57 Å between the EGs and the IDTSe cores (see Fig. 4b and c), implying a weak molecular aggregation feature in TSeIC-P-Cl. The changed trend of the π–π stacking distances for TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl was also different from that of similar ITIC derivatives (the π–π stacking distance of ITIC-2Cl-δ was 3.46/3.48 Å, while that of ITIC-2Cl-γ was 3.35/3.38/3.40 Å).85 Such features indicated that replacing the thiophene unit with the selenophene ring on the end of the central core had a great influence on the molecular crystallinity and the aggregation behavior. Besides, the dihedral angles among the adjacent molecules were also calculated with 0/4.97° for TSeIC-M-Cl and 6.49/7.09° for TSeIC-P-Cl. The smaller dihedral angle of TSeIC-M-Cl was attributed to its good planarity and linear distribution in the single crystal. In contrast, TSeIC-P-Cl showed a large dihedral angle and kinked distribution, especially the middle molecule shown in Fig. 4d and e, which showed a large slant among the neighboring molecules. More importantly, the kinked distribution of TSeIC-P-Cl resulted in its 3D molecular packing with a rectangle-like interpenetrating network, while TSeIC-M-Cl retained its parallel distribution with a linear stacked structure in the single crystal. In detail, with the chlorine substituents at the para-position on INCN, TSeIC-P-Cl showed multiple and particular intermolecular interactions between the chlorine atom on INCN and the hydrogen/carbon atom on the side chain (Cl⋯H: 2.84 Å, Cl⋯C: 3.33 Å, as shown in Fig. S7, ESI†), which caused the unique 3D interpenetrating network.

The para-hexyl phenyl side chains were neglected for clarity. 
To further describe the slipped stacking of the two crystals, the pitch angle (P), the roll angle (R), and the longitudinal (long molecular axis) and transverse (short molecular axis) shifts (denoted as dp and dr, respectively) were calculated.90,91 And the schematic diagrams of P, R, dp and dr are shown in Fig. S8 (ESI†). As shown in Fig. 4d and e, both the acceptors exhibited obviously slipped packing in their units. With respect to the crystal of TSeIC-P-Cl, the pitch and roll angles were 80.69 and 49.23°, respectively. The corresponding longitudinal and transverse shifts were 22.16 and 4.20 Å. In contrast, the crystal of TSeIC-M-Cl showed a larger pitch angle but a smaller roll angle, which were 83.07 and 48.24°, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse shifts of TSeIC-M-Cl were calculated to be 27.09 and 3.70 Å. The roll angles of the two crystals showed inclinations larger than 45°, which implied that the π-orbital overlap was almost destroyed and charge transport was forbidden in the transverse axis. Even though the pitch angles of the two crystals were also larger than 45°, in the longitudinal axis intermolecular π-orbital overlap was still retained by bending the conjugated skeleton.90 However, the larger pitch angle of TSeIC-M-Cl implied a larger sliding shift and a smaller degree of π-orbital overlap compared to TSeIC-P-Cl in the longitudinal axis (the detailed information is shown in Table S2, ESI†). Although both TSeIC-M-IC and TSeIC-P-IC showed similar antiparallel packing in single crystals, the multiple intermolecular Se⋯π interactions between the IDTSe cores and the EGs were only found in TSeIC-P-Cl with the distances of 3.41–3.58 Å (as shown in Fig. S7, ESI†), which looked like an anchor to fix the intermolecular overlap. So, due to the multiple synergistic effect of the Se atom and the Cl atom, the Cl atoms on EGs deeply inserted into the cores of the neighboring molecules, which showed a higher degree of π-orbital overlap in TSeIC-P-Cl. In contrast, the slipped stacking of TSeIC-M-Cl only showed intermolecular interactions between the EGs with the distances of 3.36 Å, implying a less degree of π-orbital overlap in TSeIC-M-Cl. So, TSeIC-P-Cl showed a higher degree of π-orbital overlap and the percent of π-orbital overlap was 22.73%, while that of TSeIC-M-Cl was only 13.81%. Considering that the overlap of the π-orbit provided a pathway for intermolecular charge transport, TSeIC-P-IC with the obviously higher degree of π-orbital overlap and a 3D interpenetrating network in molecular packing was expected to show better charge transport properties than TSeIC-M-IC in spite of its slightly loose π–π stacking and weak aggregation. These results showed that moving the chlorine substituents from the meta-position to the para-position on INCN led to an obvious increase in the degree of π-orbital overlap and the charge transport direction with appropriate aggregation behavior, which were beneficial for improving the device performance of the selenophene-containing monohalogenated INCN-based NFAs.
The ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) absorption spectra of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were measured and the relevant data are summarized in Table 1. The two acceptors showed strong absorption in a range from 600 to 800 nm. In diluted chloroform solution, TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl showed maximum absorption peaks at 713 and 710 nm, and the corresponding extinction coefficients were 1.70 × 105 and 2.02 × 105 M−1 cm−1 (see Fig. S9, ESI†). The slightly higher extinction coefficient of TSeIC-P-Cl is beneficial for enhancing the ability of light harvesting. In thin films, the maximum absorption peaks of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were located at 767 and 759 nm, which were bathochromic 54 and 49 nm relative to their spectra in solution (as shown in Fig. 1b). The slightly redshifted wavelength in TSeIC-M-Cl was due to the stronger electron-withdrawing ability of IC-M-Cl and the stronger intermolecular aggregation in the film of TSeIC-M-Cl. Besides, the absorption band edges of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl in neat films were 843 and 842 nm, and their corresponding optical bandgaps were both 1.47 eV. These results showed that the modulation of the chlorine substituents from the meta-position to the para-position on INCN has a puny influence on the molecular optical absorption bandgap but slightly enhances the absorbance intensity.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was used to measure the frontier orbital energy levels of the two acceptors in thin films. From the oxidation and reduction onsets in the CV curves (as shown in Fig. S10, ESI†), the HOMO/LUMO energy levels were −5.64/−4.01 eV for TSeIC-M-Cl and −5.62/−3.98 eV for TSeIC-P-Cl. The corresponding electrochemical band gaps were 1.63 eV for TSeIC-M-Cl and 1.64 eV for TSeIC-P-Cl. Schematic energy level diagrams and the detailed data are displayed in Fig. 1c and Table 1, respectively. The elevated energy level of TSeIC-P-Cl resulted from two factors.66 First, with a higher electronegativity than that of the carbonyl group, the dicyano group showed stronger electron-withdrawing ability on INCN. Second, as a substituent, the chlorine atom showed a stronger resonance electron-withdrawing effect to the meta-position than the para-position on the phenyl ring. So, compared with TSeIC-M-Cl with the chlorine substituents at the meta-position on INCN, TSeIC-P-Cl showed weaker electron-withdrawing ability and an elevated molecular energy level with the chlorine substituents at the para-position on INCN. And the elevated molecular energy level of TSeIC-P-Cl was consistent with the result of the DFT calculation, which was hopeful for achieving a high VOC in the corresponding devices. Besides, due to the empty orbital of the Se atom, TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl also showed downshifted LUMO energy levels than ITIC derivatives.85 The obvious differences implied that fusing the Se atom on the end of the central unit has an important influence on the electrochemical properties, which were consistent with a previous report.53
The photoelectric properties of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were investigated with a device configuration of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/PBT1-C:acceptor/ZrAcac/Al. Polymer PTB1-C was chosen as the donor to fabricate the BHJ-OSCs owing to its complementary absorption band and suitable energy level for TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl.92 All active layers were processed by spin-coating the mixed solution of PTB1-C, acceptors and the solvent additive with altering ratios. The current density–voltage (J–V) curves of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl-based BHJ-OSCs are shown in Fig. 5a, and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 2. The as-cast devices based on PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl showed a VOC of 0.87 V and a JSC of 17.48 mA cm−2, which were better than those of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl. After thermal annealing (TA) treatment, both the devices showed significantly enhanced JSC and fill factor (FF) while the VOC was slightly decreased. Finally, the devices based on PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl achieved an optimal PCE of 11.26%, with a VOC of 0.85 V, a JSC of 18.67 mA cm−2, and an FF of 71.0%, which outperformed the photovoltaic properties based on PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl (a VOC of 0.82 V, a JSC of 16.10 mA cm−2, an FF of 73.6%, and thus a PCE of 9.72%). Obviously, through TA treatment, the PCE of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl showed a prominent improvement over that of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl. This may be the result of the original film of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl which was relatively loose, so intermolecular aggregation and the microstructure would significantly improve upon TA treatment, along with the elevation of the photovoltaic performance. Besides, as another important parameter the energy loss (Eloss) was considered, which were 0.62 eV for PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl and 0.65 eV for PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl. The smaller Eloss and the simultaneously increased JSC and VOC in the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl-based devices resulted in an improved PCE, indicating that moving the chlorine substituents from the meta-position to the para-position on INCN led to the enhanced photovoltaic performance of NF-SMAs.

The EQE curves based on the films of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl and PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl with as-cast or TA treatment are shown in Fig. 5b. All the EQE curves showed a broad photoresponse range from 300 to 800 nm. With as-cast treatment, the film of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl showed a higher response intensity than that of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl. This could result from the higher molar absorption coefficient of TSeIC-P-Cl. After TA treatment, the EQE value from the film of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl showed a platform over 70% with the maximum value of 72% at 558 nm, while the EQE value from the optimal film of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl only reached 65% at 766 nm. The increased responsive intensity indicated the improved light-to-current conversion in the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl film. In addition, by calculating from the EQE spectra, the JSC values of the as-cast/TA treated PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl and PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl films were found to be 14.47/16.12 mA cm−2 and 17.02/18.07 mA cm−2, which were consistent with the values measured from the J–V curves with mismatch less than 5%.
The charge transport properties of the TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl devices were evaluated by the space-charge-limited current (SCLC) method. As shown in Fig. S11 (ESI†), the electron mobilities based on the neat films of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were 2.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 7.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, respectively. The obviously higher electron mobility of TSeIC-P-Cl was attributed to the unique 3D interpenetrating network and the higher degree of π-orbital overlap in the single crystal of TSeIC-P-Cl. After blending with the donor PBT1-C, the hole and electron mobilities of the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl film were 4.5 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 5.7 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1, while those of the PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl film were 1.6 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1 and 1.4 × 10−4 cm2 V−1 s−1. These higher hole and electron mobilities of the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl-based film implied an effective way to improve the charge mobilities by adjustment of the chlorine substituents from the meta-position to the para-position on INCN. Besides, the rates of μh/μe were also calculated with 0.78 for the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl film and 1.14 for the PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl film. The relative higher FF of the PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl film might be attributed to the relative balanced hole and electron mobilities of the PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl film in comparison with that of the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl film.14
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of blend films were performed to investigate their nanoscale surface and bulk morphology. As shown in Fig. 6a and b, the two blend films exhibited different root-mean-square (RMS) roughness values, which were 1.81 nm for PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl and 1.64 nm for PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl. The large RMS roughness implied a strong aggregation feature in the blend film of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl, and this feature was also observed in Fig. 6c and d. Compared with the obvious fibrous structure and nanoscale phase separation in the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl film, the film of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl showed larger aggregation domains, which were unfavorable for exciton diffusion and dissociation. Besides, from Fig. 6e and f an obvious grain aggregation feature was observed in the PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl film, while the film of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl only tended to form a fibrillary aggregation feature. These results were quite in agreement with those from the AFM images. The good morphology of the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl film implied that PBT1-C and TSeIC-P-Cl could be finely mixed with a suitable domain size and formed good phase separation, which were favorable for exciton dissociation and charge transport, and finally for achieving an improved JSC and a good photovoltaic performance.

To further explore the crystalline differences caused by changing the substituent position of the chlorine atom on INCN, grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) was performed. Two-dimensional GIWAXS patterns and the corresponding line-cut profiles in the out-of-plane (OOP) and in-plane (IP) directions are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. S12 (ESI†). The polymer donor PBT1-C showed a (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.68 Å−1 in the OOP direction and a (100) diffraction peak at qxy = 0.26 Å−1 in the IP direction. The two acceptors also showed obvious IP(010) and OOP(100) diffraction peaks, which were located at 1.82 and 0.34 Å−1 for TSeIC-M-Cl and 1.80 and 0.32 Å−1 for TSeIC-P-Cl, respectively. This implied dominant face-on orientations in their films. The corresponding π–π stacking and lamellar spacings were 3.45 and 18.47 Å for TSeIC-M-Cl and 3.48 and 19.63 Å for TSeIC-P-Cl, respectively. And the close π–π stacking of TSeIC-M-Cl in the neat film was in good agreement with the result of single crystal analysis. Besides, the film of TSeIC-M-Cl showed a broad (010) diffraction peak in the IP direction, which implied that an edge-on orientation also existed in the neat TSeIC-M-Cl film. Compared with the mixed orientation in the film of TSeIC-M-Cl, TSeIC-P-Cl exhibited a preferential face-on orientation, which was beneficial for charge transport. And, to make clear the relationship between the single crystal and the thin film, the diffraction patterns from the single crystal data were compared with the GIWAXS patterns. As shown in Fig. S13 (ESI†), both TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl from the single crystal data showed strong diffraction signals near their own OOP(010) diffraction peaks. And the preferred orientations of TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl were the (310) and (302) crystal planes, respectively, which were parallel to the corresponding molecular π–π planes (Fig. 8). This indicated face-on stacking patterns in their crystals, which were consistent with the dominant molecular stacking of the crystalline domains in the films. So, the 3D molecular stacking and the higher degree of π-orbital overlap for TSeIC-P-Cl could be maintained in the films,34 which resulted in its higher electron mobility than TSeIC-M-Cl in neat films. In addition, based on the IP(100) and OOP(010) peaks, the crystal coherence lengths (CCLs) calculated by using the Scherrer equation were 85.20 and 19.73 Å for PBT1-C, 80.74 and 17.13 Å for TSeIC-M-Cl and 62.8 and 15.48 Å for TSeIC-P-Cl, respectively. Compared with TSeIC-M-Cl, TSeIC-P-Cl showed smaller CCL values, indicating its weaker molecular crystallinity in neat films.

After blending with the donor PBT1-C, the films of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl and PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl showed (100) lamellar peaks in the IP direction together with (010) π–π stacking peaks in the OOP direction, suggesting dominant face-on orientations in both blended films (Fig. 7). However, a preferential and stronger face-on orientation was observed in the film of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl compared with the PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl film, showing a similar trend with that in their neat films. Besides, the (100) diffraction peaks of the two blends in the xy direction were located at qxy = 0.26 Å−1 (d-spacing of 24.15 Å), which originated from the ordered donor polymers PBT1-C, suggesting that the polymers PBT1-C maintained their original packing structures in the blends. In the z direction, the blend of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl showed a new (010) diffraction peak at qz = 1.73 Å−1 with a π–π stacking distance of 3.63 Å, which was between the (010) diffraction peaks of PBT1-C and TSeIC-P-Cl, indicating that the donor PBT1-C had good miscibility with TSeIC-P-Cl in the blend film. Thus, the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl blend film showed a better film morphology and a preferential face-on orientation to improve the charge transport properties and finally achieve an increased JSC. In contrast, the blend of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl displayed two distinct (010) diffraction peaks at qz = 1.68 and 1.82 Å−1 in the OOP direction, which corresponded to the π–π stackings in the PBT1-C and TSeIC-M-Cl domains, respectively. This meant that PBT1-C and TSeIC-M-Cl tended to form strong self-aggregation and had poor miscibility in the blend.93,94 With the relatively higher CCL values, the film of TSeIC-M-Cl displayed a stronger crystallinity than that of TSeIC-P-Cl, which caused it to form a stronger self-interaction rather than good miscibility with PBT1-C in the blend.95 Due to the strong self-organization of PBT1-C and TSeIC-M-Cl in the blend, an unfavorable interpenetrating network was formed and finally it led to a large RMS roughness, which was consistent with the results from AFM measurements. The excessive aggregation of TSeIC-M-Cl had an adverse effect on the film morphology and finally reduced the JSC. The significant differences in the blend films indicated that the combination of fusing the selenophene unit on the end of the central core and properly tailoring the chlorine substituents from the meta-position to the para-position on INCN would improve the miscibility with the strong crystalline donor PBT1-C, form a favorable morphology with a suitable domain size and good phase separation, and acquire a preferential face-on orientation in the blend film, which were beneficial to achieve a high PCE in the corresponding devices.
Conclusions
In conclusion, we first synthesized two regioisomeric acceptors (TSeIC-M-Cl and TSeIC-P-Cl) with an identical IDTSe core and different monochlorinated EGs with chlorine substituents at the meta- or para-position on INCN, respectively, to systematically study the influence on molecular crystallinity in the neat or blend film, the nanomorphology in the blend film, and the photovoltaic performance. Compared with TSeIC-M-Cl, TSeIC-P-Cl showed a similar UV-vis absorption spectrum but elevated energy levels, which was beneficial to achieve a higher VOC and lower Eloss without sacrificing the JSC in the corresponding devices. Besides, TSeIC-P-Cl showed a moderate crystallinity and loose π–π stacking in comparison with TSeIC-M-Cl. Such a changed trend of the two regioisomers was different from that of the ITIC derivatives, implying an effective modulation on molecular crystallinity and aggregation behavior through replacing the thiophene unit to the selenophene ring on the end of the central core. And benefiting from multiple and strong intermolecular Cl⋯H/C and Se⋯π interactions in the single crystal, TSeIC-P-Cl with the chlorine substituents at the para-position on INCN displayed a 3D interpenetrating network and a higher degree of π-orbital overlap, which resulted in a higher electron mobility in the TSeIC-P-Cl film than that in TSeIC-M-Cl with a linear stacked structure. Moreover, the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl blend film exhibited better miscibility and formed a nanofibril-like network with a preferential face-on orientation in comparison with PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl. Thus, the blend of PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl showed higher hole and electron mobilities than PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl. Finally, owing to the simultaneously increased JSC and VOC, the best PCE of 11.26% is obtained by the PBT1-C:TSeIC-P-Cl devices, which was better than that of PBT1-C:TSeIC-M-Cl (9.72%). This comparative investigation indicates a synergistic strategy with the regulation of fusing the selenophene ring on the end of the electron-rich core, and properly modulating the chlorine substituent from the meta-position to the para-position on the EGs of acceptors provides an alternative path to control the molecular crystallinity and the nanomorphology of the blend film by delicate molecular design for high efficient monohalogenated INCN-based OSCs. The results may suggest an important clue for better understanding the “basal unit on the end of the electron-rich core and the halogenated position of the EG-nanomorphology-device performance” relationship of monohalogenated acceptors in OSCs.
