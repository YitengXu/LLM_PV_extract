Introduction
The interest in Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) has drastically increased in the last few years.1,2 A high power conversion efficiency and low-cost potential make PSCs very promising candidates for future applications.3–5 The certified record efficiency of PSCs has already reached 20% (ref. 6) making this solar cell technology competitive with traditional silicon technologies. However, the active areas of perovskite solar cells reported in the literature are mostly limited to a few square millimeters. An up-scaling of the active area of the device is expected to lead to a drop in efficiency due to the series resistance of the electrodes. Indeed, Yang et al.7 have demonstrated that up-scaling from 0.12 cm2 to 1.1 cm2 led to an efficiency drop from 17.5% to 15.5% in devices with an FTO transparent electrode and evaporated Ag back contact. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) in these devices dropped due to the reducing of the fill factor (FF) with an increase in the cell area. This can be very critical for manufacturing perovskite PV modules,8–12 where the dimensions of a single sub-cell should be selected in such a way that the series resistance of the electrodes does not affect the performance of the modules. Perovskite modules of 10 × 10 cm2, as reported by J. Seo et al.,11 have an ITO patch width of 0.8 cm (0.6 cm active area and 0.2 cm interconnection). Such modules demonstrate a PCE of 8.7%, with a FF of 0.57. The modules reported by S. Razza et al.,10 with an area of 10 cm2, demonstrate a PCE of 10.3% with an FF of 0.58, while the scaling up to 100 cm2 demonstrates a drop in the efficiency to 4.3% with a FF of 0.54. Although it is not only the dimension and the resistance of the electrodes that play a role, and the uniformity of the layers and quality of the interconnections are also very critical, nevertheless the first question at up-scaling is: what should be the optimal sub-cell width to avoid resistive losses in the module?
Furthermore, the low cost potential of perovskite solar cells is based on cheap earth-abundant materials and the possibility of solution R2R processing.13,14 However, R2R processing introduces some limitations in material selection and limits the process temperature to ∼140 °C in the case of plastic substrates. Recent developments have demonstrated the possibility of manufacturing perovskite solar cells on plastic substrates with low process temperatures.15–17 However, the sheet resistance of TCO on plastic substrates typically has higher values than that of TCO on rigid glass.18 This introduces additional limitations to the single sub-cell dimension in the perovskite PV modules. It is well known from other PV technologies that an increasing cell dimension leads to a rapid decrease of the solar cell performance19–21 mainly due to a decrease in the fill factor (FF). The decrease in FF is caused by increased power losses due to the series resistance (Rs) of the electrodes and current (I), which increases proportionally to the cell area.
In this study we perform direct current (DC) simulations in perovskite solar cells and modules with different dimensions. The theoretical and experimental results were compared. The presented results reveal the relationship between the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the devices and the dimension of the active area, and the width of the sub-cell in the module. The DC simulation was performed for different sheet resistances of TCO, which allowed the determination of the optimal cell dimensions suitable for the upscaling of perovskite modules on both rigid and flexible substrates.
Experimental
Glass substrates of 30 mm × 30 mm covered with a patterned ITO layer were obtained from Naranjo. The transmittance of the ITO layer was 90%. Titanium isopropoxide (97%, Aldrich), methylammonium iodide (MAI, Lumtec), lead chloride (PbCl2, 99.999%, Alpa Aesar), and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT, Plextronics Plexcore OS 2100) were used as received. All solvents were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
A precursor solution for the compact TiO2 layer contained 83 μL 1 M HCl in water, with the addition of 8 mL of IPA and 438 μL titanium isopropoxide. After spin coating the precursor solution the substrates were placed in the oven for 30 min ramping to 500 °C and kept for 30 min at 500 °C. A compact TiO2 layer with a thickness of 40 nm was formed. For the perovskite layer a nonstoichiometric mixture of MAI and PbCl2 (2.4:0.8 molar ratio) was dissolved in anhydrous DMF and stirred at room temperature overnight. The solution was spin coated on TiO2 coated substrates inside a dry box. Then the substrates were transferred to a glove box and thermally annealed at 100 °C for one hour. The resulting thickness of the perovskite layer was 350 nm. Then the doped P3HT solution was spin coated on top of the perovskite layer with a resultant thickness of 100 nm. A solution for the P3HT layer was made by stirring P3HT in chlorobenzene (15 mg mL−1) at 60 °C overnight and then adding 0.5 μL 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) and 10 μL of lithium bis(tri-fluoro-methane-sulphonimidate) solution (170 mg mL−1 in acetonitrile). The devices were finished by the thermal evaporation at 1 × 10−6 mbar of an Au electrode with a thickness of 100 nm.
The layer thicknesses were measured using a Veeco Dektak Profilometer. The current–voltage measurements of the devices were performed under a Wacom dual source solar simulator, calibrated to the AM1.5 spectrum, with the sample in an N2 filled enclosed sample holder and using a Keithley 2400 source meter.
Theoretical modelling
In order to quantify the influence of the electrode resistivity on the overall performance of perovskite solar cells, direct current (DC) simulations were performed. The multiphysics finite element package COMSOL was used to obtain the electrical potential field V by solving the 2D Poisson's equation for conductive media for the top and bottom electrode simultaneously: (1)Here, Rsh and Jp represent the sheet resistivity and the current density, respectively. Note that the current density Jp passing between the top and bottom electrode, through the active area, is conservative, e.g. anti-periodic.
The sheet resistance of the transparent (bottom) electrode was considered as 10 Ω □−1 (typical for ITO and FTO on glass), 40 Ω □−1 and 60 Ω □−1 (characterizing typical properties of ITO on foil). The transmittance of the TCO was 90%. The resistivity of the transparent electrode was most critical in the case of the selected cell architecture (Fig. 1a), while the sheet resistance of the evaporated Au (bottom) electrode was considered as 0.24 Ω □−1 (bulk resistivity of 2.44 × 10−8 Ω m, and a layer thickness of 100 nm).
 Fig. 1  Schematic illustration of the PSC device stack (a), and input JV curve used in the modeling (b). 
The edge of the top electrode is connected to ground and the edge of the bottom electrode is ascribed to the work potential Vwork of the solar cell. The current density Jp passing through the active layer is a function of the electrical potential difference ΔV between the top and bottom electrode: ΔV = Vbottom − Vtop(2)
The current density (flux) describes the intrinsic diode property of the perovskite solar cell without the resistance influence. Such a JV curve was obtained by experimental measurements of a PV cell with a dimension of 4 mm2 under simulated 1 sun illumination. The IV curve of such a device is given in Fig. 1b.
After solving the electrical potential field, the total current through the cell Icell can be directly obtained from the simulation results. Accordingly, the current density of the cell Jcell is defined as the average current density per unit of active area (including death zones in the case of serial interconnections), i.e. (3)
Results and discussion
To determine the resistive losses in devices with an up-scaling of the active area, a DC current simulation was performed for cells with different dimensions. A schematic illustration of the device’s layout is shown in Fig. 2. One substrate contains four separate devices with different active areas. The individual cells in the substrate are called A, B, C and D (ABCD design). The active areas of the devices are determined by the geometrical overlap of both electrodes, which were 0.3 cm × 0.3 cm, 0.4 cm × 0.4 cm, 0.6 cm × 0.6 cm and 1 cm × 1 cm for the cells A, B, C and D respectively.
 Fig. 2  Schematic illustration of the ABCD design, where the active areas of the A, B, C and D cells are 0.09, 0.16, 0.36 and 1 cm2, respectively. 

JV-curves of the cells with different dimensions obtained from the DC-simulations are given in Fig. 3 and the JV parameters are listed in Table S1 (ESI†). The modeling was performed for the different sheet resistances of the transparent electrode. The result reveals a strong influence of the electrode sheet resistance on the FF in the large devices (devices “C” and “D”). In the “C” devices, with a dimension of 0.36 cm2, the fill factor drops from 0.74 to 0.63, when the sheet resistance of the electrode change from 10 Ω □−1 to 60 Ω □−1. In the “D” devices (1 cm2) the FF drops from 0.69 to 0.45, with the same change in the sheet resistance of the transparent electrode. While for the “A” device of 0.09 cm2, the sheet resistance of the electrode was not very critical, and the FF drops only from 0.76 to 0.73, for 10 Ω □−1 and 60 Ω □−1, respectively. The results of the simulation in a different format, where the four different cell dimensions are plotted for one specific sheet resistance, is given in Fig. S1 (ESI†). These data reveal a strong influence of the active area up-scaling from 0.09 cm2 to 1 cm2 on the performance of the devices, keeping the same sheet resistance of the electrodes. The PCE drops from 14.76% to 13.39% (FF drops from 0.76 to 0.69) for the devices with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1. Devices with a TCO of 60 Ω □−1 demonstrate a much higher drop in the PCE with active area upscaling, namely: the efficiency drops from 14.29% to 8.68%, and the FF drops from 0.73 to 0.46 in the case of up-scaling from 0.09 cm2 to 1 cm2.
 Fig. 3  Simulated JV-curves of the A, B, C and D cells (ABCD design), with different sheet resistances of the TCO (10, 40 and 60 Ω □−1). 
To verify the reliability of the performed simulation identical devices were manufactured and measured under simulated 1 sun irradiance. In this experiment the ITO electrode on glass substrate was used. The initial sheet resistance of the ITO electrode was 10 Ω □−1. However, the post processing of TiO2 at 500 °C, as described in the Experimental section, increases the sheet resistance of ITO up to 46 Ω □−1. Therefore, the experimental results were compared with the simulated results calculated for an ITO sheet resistance of 46 Ω □−1. Fig. 4 shows both the JV-curves experimentally measured and those obtained from the DC-simulations. The JV parameters for both cases are listed in Table S2 (ESI†). The numerical results demonstrate a good agreement between the experimental and simulated data. This confirms the reliability of the model selected for simulation and demonstrates that the sheet resistance of TCO has a very big influence on the performance of the perovskite PV devices. Upscaling from 0.09 cm2 to 1 cm2 leads to an efficiency drop of 10% for the TCO with a sheet resistance of 10 Ω □−1, while the usage of TCO with a sheet resistance of 60 Ω □−1 (typical for flexible substrates) provides a 42% efficiency drop.

At the next stage of our research a DC-simulation for another device design was performed. This design has an active area of ∼3.75 cm2 and was widely used by our group for the upscaling of OPV devices22,23 and called the BS002 design. In the light of ongoing research, the applicability of this design for PSCs was investigated. The layout of the electrodes in this design is shown in Fig. 5a. The dimensions of the ITO electrode were 2.4 cm × 2.4 cm and theoretically this will introduce resistive losses in the devices. To reduce resistive losses a metal frame of Mo/Al/Mo (MAM) was sputtered around the ITO patch (the width of the MAM features was 1 mm with a thickness of 20/100/20 nm), as shown in Fig. 5a. Although the MAM features reduce resistive losses in the devices, the dimensions of the transparent electrode were still too large to avoid losses in PSCs. Fig. 5b shows the simulated JV curves of the devices with a BS002 design and calculated for four different sheet resistances of ITO. The simulated JVs reveal the strong resistive losses in the devices due to sheet resistance and the dimensions of the devices. The FF in the devices drops from 0.76, in input JV, to 0.62 and 0.45 in the simulated devices with an ITO of 10 Ω □−1 and 60 Ω □−1, respectively (see Table S3 in ESI†).

Fig. 6 shows (a) the layout of the cell with the calculated electrical potential field at the work potential Vwork of maximum power, (b) the electric flux through the device and (c) the maximum power per area. The gradient in all of these parameters is a result of the limited conductivity of TCO in the large area devices. The visualized electric field clearly illustrates a difference in the devices with different sheet resistances of TCO. A strong gradient within the device area reveals that the device dimensions are too large for effective current collection. It identifies the necessity to look carefully into the design used for the up-scaling of PSCs. Therefore in the next stage of the research we made simulations of module designs which can be used for the manufacturing of perovskite PV modules.

The layout of the perovskite PV module used in the simulation is shown in Fig. 7. The module is represented by individual sub-cells serially interconnected. The dimension of the sub-cell is described by the width “W”, and this value was varied in the simulation. The width of the interconnection very much depends on the deposition and patterning technique, and it should be remembered that this value also has a very strong influence on the final module performance. However, in this study we aimed only to investigate the influence of the electrode sheet resistance and its dimensions on the final efficiency of the modules. Therefore, the interconnection area was considered as a fixed value, which can be easily achieved using laser technology with a standard P1, P2 and P3 approach.24 A width of the laser scribes of 40 μm and a distance between the scribes of 100 μm were selected as the most compatible with a range of the current laser technologies. The fine tuning of these parameters is possible from a technological point of view,25 however the selected values are the most representative for a wide range of technologies and therefore can be used in the simulation. Thus, an interconnection (dead area) includes P1, P2 and P3 scribes and was 320 μm in all simulated cases. The active area of one sub-cell was the distance “W” minus 280 μm, as schematically illustrated in Fig. 7. The simulation was performed for the transparent electrodes with sheet resistances of 10 Ω □−1, 40 Ω □−1, 46 Ω □−1 and 60 Ω □−1. The dimension of the serially interconnected sub-cells was described by “W” in the range from 1 to 20 mm, namely: 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 mm.
 Fig. 7  Schematic illustration of the module design. 
The modelling set-up for the serial-module build follows a similar approach as described in the modelling paragraph for the individual cells; (i) two differential equations are solved simultaneously for the top and bottom electrode, (ii) current densities are governed by the electrical potential difference over the active layer and described by the JP-input curve, (iii) ground is applied to the edge of the bottom electrode and (iv) the working potential is prescribed along the edge of the top electrode. In order to complete the posed boundary value problem in the case of modules represented by individual sub-cells serially interconnected, additional electrical constraints need to be defined at the positions of the interconnections. In the module, these interconnections between the two electrodes are realized by laser scribes filled with gold. In the modelling, for this moment, the resistivity losses through the interconnections are assumed to be negligible and a perfect electrical interface between the top and bottom electrodes is simulated. This means that at the position of the interconnection the electrical potential V is equal in both electrodes, and the current density Jint exchange between the electrodes is anti-periodic, i.e. Vtop = Vbottom and Jtopint = −Jbottomint @interconnection(4)
Simulated JV-curves for the single sub-cells are shown in Fig. 8 and the theoretically calculated PV parameters are listed in Table S4 (ESI†). As evident from Fig. 8, the resistive loses in the individual sub-cells become very pronounced with an increase in the cell width. The FF in the sub-cell drops from 0.76 to 0.48 in the devices with a TCO of 10 Ω □−1, and from 0.76 to 0.35 in the devices with a TCO of 60 Ω □−1. Moreover, in the modules with high sheet resistances of the electrodes (≥40 Ω □−1), resistive losses also affected the short circuit current (Jsc). Jsc drops when the width of the sub-cell is more than 1 cm. However, a drop in the Jsc is also observed in the very narrow sub-cells (0.1–0.2 cm), which is most pronounced in the 0.1 cm wide sub-cell. A drop in the Jsc in the small sub-cells is driven by a low aspect ratio between the active and dead areas. As was mentioned above, the interconnection area had a fixed value of 320 μm, which is almost 30% of the sub-cell with a width of 0.1 cm. Thus, the current density in the module with 0.1 cm wide sub-cells is influenced by a low active area in the modules, due to the large amount of interconnections.
 Fig. 8  Simulated JV-curves of the individual sub-cells in the perovskite modules with a varied width of the sub-cells and different sheet resistances of TCO. 
According to the performed simulation, the optimum width of the sub-cell in the module strongly depends on the sheet resistance of the TCO. The changes in the JV parameters with increasing sub-cell width are shown in Fig. 9. The optimal sub-cell width with a sheet resistance of TCO of 10 Ω □−1 is in the range of 0.3–0.7 cm for the device architecture investigated in this study. Increasing the sheet resistance of TCO to 40–60 Ω □−1 reduces the optimum width of the sub-cells to 0.3–0.4 cm. A very narrow width of the sub-cells in perovskite modules introduces new challenging topics towards up-scaling. Among these topics are (i) optimization of the interconnection process and reducing the dead area, (ii) alternative electrodes with low sheet resistance, suitable for R2R processing, (iii) low temperature sintering processes, etc.

Conclusions
The theoretical modeling performed in this study reveals the critical influence of the electrode sheet resistance on the performance of perovskite solar cells and modules with the upscaling of the active area of the sub-cells. Simulated results explained the losses in the performance of the PSC obtained experimentally with the upscaling of the active area from 0.09 cm2 to 1 cm2. Furthermore, DC simulation enables the identification of the most rational sub-cell dimensions in the modules. If the sheet resistance of TCO is 10 Ω □−1, the optimum width of the sub-cells in the module is in the range of 0.3–0.7 cm. However, this value decreases to 0.3–0.4 cm, if the sheet resistance rises to 40 Ω □−1, while for 60 Ω □−1, the optimum width of the sub-cell is only 0.3 cm. The results identified the most critical issues towards the large area processing and up-scaling of perovskite PV technology. First of all, because the width of the sub-cells in the modules is relatively small, the efforts should be focused on reducing the interconnection (dead) area. Laser technology seems to be the most promising to achieve a high aspect ratio between the active area and interconnections zone25. Secondly, high temperature processing of the functional layers in the device stack, e.g. TiO2, can negatively affect the sheet resistance of ITO, which is the most typical TCO for plastic substrates. In addition, plastic substrates do not support high temperature processing. This reveals new critical issues, which should be solved for future R2R processing. Plastic substrates and ITO (individually or in combination) set a temperature limit and reveal the necessity of alternative low temperature sintering for the functional layers. Alternatively, substrates which support high temperature processing, e.g. metal substrates, can be examined for the application of R2R perovskite processing. However, this does not solve the issue of the low compatibility of ITO with high temperatures. Therefore, alternative electrodes are in high demand. Practical solutions to all these issues will bring the perovskite PV community a few steps closer towards the scaling up and R2R processing of perovskite solar cells and modules.
