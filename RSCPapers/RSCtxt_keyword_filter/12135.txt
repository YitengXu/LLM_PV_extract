    , Accepted 14th August 2018First published on 1st September 2018AbstractHere, brand new ternary hybrid solar cells comprising perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) with a complementary absorption profile of the organic host matrix are reported. In particular, NH2CHNH2PbI3 (FAPbI3) perovskite NCs are implemented in bulk heterojunction organic solar cells based on the pDPP5T-2 electron donating polymer and a [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) acceptor at various loading amounts and the fabricated hybrid photovoltaics are thoroughly studied by employing different optoelectrical characterization methods. Current–voltage measurements and photoinduced charge carrier extraction by linear increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) reveal improved charge generation and charge transport properties upon incorporation of perovskite NCs into the photo-active layer of the hybrid solar cell. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the hybrid solar cell comprising 5% perovskite NCs is 10% enhanced compared to the organic reference, mainly due to the enlarged light harvesting and increased short circuit current density (Jsc). However, results suggest that introducing a higher amount of perovskite content induces bimolecular and trap-assisted recombination in the ternary devices. We perform a comprehensive transient absorption study of the charge transfer/transport mechanisms by employing femto-second pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). fs-TAS measurements demonstrate a slower charge carrier recombination rate due to the introduction of perovskite NCs into the photoactive layer. Results reveal that DPP injects electrons from the singlet excited state into the perovskite NCs, which causes the desired cascading charge carrier transfer. In ternary blends, a small amount of FAPbI3 NCs provides an additional pathway in favor of the charge-separated state via the NCs, which, despite accelerating the depopulation of DPP's singlet excited state slightly slows down the charge-separation process between DPP and PC61BM. Interestingly, the loss processes are slowed down; an effect that is more important and, hence, explains the improved solar cell efficiency.
Introduction
Organic photovoltaic devices (OPV) are of great importance for the low cost of materials, inexpensive large area device production, and solution based fabrication techniques, as well as their flexibility and transparency.1–3 Power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of above 10% have been reported for single junction binary organic photovoltaics.4 Nevertheless, OPVs still suffer from various issues like inefficient exciton dissociation, low carrier mobility and incomplete harvesting of the solar spectrum.5–7 The efficiency of photon harvesting of the OPVs can be improved by incorporating a second photon absorber such as low band gap polymers,8–14 small molecules,15–18 dyes15,19,20 and colloidal quantum dots (QDs).21–25
Recently, metal halide perovskites have been used as efficient light absorbers for solar cells and have shown high performance due to their direct band gap, large absorption coefficient, long exciton diffusion lengths and very high charge carrier mobility.26 The rapid development of perovskite based solar cells since 2013 has already achieved a remarkable PCE of 22.1%.27 However, they still suffer from current–voltage hysteresis and their inherent instability. The modification of perovskite devices by polymeric materials is mostly performed to enhance charge transport across the interfaces, eliminate hysteresis and increase the environmental stability of the devices.27
Most reports on perovskite solar cells are based on the CH3NH3PbI3 (or CH3NH3PbI3−xClx) system, in which the energy band gap (≈1.55 eV) is beyond the ideal band gap of photovoltaic materials (1.1–1.4 eV).28 What is more, the CH3NH3PbI3 system was reported to have a very low phase transition temperature, which will strongly influence the device stability. Recently, a brand new perovskite system, known as NH2CHNH2PbI3 (FAPbI3) perovskite, has drawn much attention, since it has superior properties compared with the CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) system, such as an extended absorption range, higher phase transition temperature and better photostability.28
Here, we implemented FAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals for the first time in the bulk heterojunction (BHJ) photo-active layer of solid state organic solar cells. For this purpose, we chose pDPP5T-2 (a thiophene derivative of diketopyrrolopyrrole, hereinafter abbreviated as DPP) as an electron donating polymer with complementary absorption spectra compared with FAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals and constructed an inverted architecture solar cell based on DPP, [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) and perovskite NCs.
To study the optoelectronic characteristics of these new organic/inorganic hybrid systems as a function of perovskite NC content we combined photovoltaic device characterization with photo induced charge carrier extraction by linear increasing voltage (photo-CELIV) as well as absorption and emission properties of the system. Deep investigation of the charge carrier transfer mechanism as well as the lifetime of the transient species has been carried out using femto-second pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). PCE enhancement was observed by increasing the perovskite content up to 5 wt% due to the improved light absorption and longer recombination lifetime.
Results and discussion
FAPbI3 nanocrystals were synthesized via the ligand-assisted reprecipitation (LARP) technique at room temperature.29 Fig. S1a (ESI†) shows transmission electron microscopy images of FAPbI3 NCs of a size of about 14.4 ± 3.4 nm. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements confirmed formation of the “black” perovskite phase of α-FAPbI3 NCs (Fig. S1b, ESI†). The UV-vis absorption and PL spectra of a NC toluene solution are shown in Fig. S1c (ESI†). The as-synthesized FAPbI3 NCs in solution exhibit quite a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 55%.

Fig. 1a shows the UV-vis absorption spectra of pristine films of DPP, FAPbI3 perovskite NCs and of the combination of DPP and perovskite NCs (1:1 weight ratio). FAPbI3 exhibits the first transition located at 800 nm with steadily increasing absorption at shorter wavelengths. Moreover, DPP shows three maximum absorption peaks at approximately 440, 720 and 780 nm. From these spectra it is evident that the two materials have complementary absorption spectra i.e.: photons with wavelengths lower than 600 nm are mostly absorbed by the perovskite NCs while photons with lower energy are harvested by the polymer chains. Upon blending with FAPbI3, the absorption of the film is shifted toward higher wavelengths which might be attributed to the improved ordering of the polymer chains upon introduction of the perovskite NCs dispersed in toluene. Such a red shift of the absorption spectrum has also been reported by Wienk et al. by varying the solvent of poly[3,6-bis-(40-dodecyl-[2,20]bithiophenyl-5-yl)-2,5-bis-(2-ethyl-hexyl)-2,5-ihydropyrrolo[3,4-]pyrrole-1,4-dione] (pBBTDPP2) which was ascribed to the formation of ordered domains.30

Emission spectra (excitation at 450 nm) of the pristine films of DPP, FAPbI3 perovskite NCs and of the combination of DPP and perovskite NCs (1:1 weight ratio) are shown in Fig. 1b. The emission spectrum of the NCs extends from ca. 700 to 850 nm and has a peak at 780 nm. However, upon blending with DPP (1:1 weight ratio), the photoluminescence spectrum revealed a quenching of 90%, which suggests hole transfer from NCs to the polymer, and it is in agreement with the cascade energy level alignment of the materials (see Fig. 2b). It should be noted that the energy levels of the FAPbI3 NCs have been extracted from the literature.31 The energy level diagram of the materials also suggests the probability of charge transfer from NCs to PC61BM, supported by the quenching of FAPbI3 photoluminescence spectra upon blending with PC61BM (1:1 weight ratio, see Fig. S2, ESI†). As a result, exciton dissociation can occur at the DPP/PC61BM, DPP/FAPbI3 and FAPbI3/PC61BM interfaces. This would enhance the DPP exciton dissociation efficiency in the ternary blend as compared to the DPP:PC61BM binary reference and would also allow the hole transfer from NCs to the polymer upon electron transfer from NCs to the fullerene.

As presented in Table 1, the open circuit voltage (Voc) is approximately constant with increasing FAPbI3 loading, up to 15 wt%, while results indicate the enhancement of the short circuit current density (Jsc) by up to approximately 11% (13.74 to 15.22 mA cm−2) by implementing 5 wt% of FAPbI3. These data are in agreement with the EQE spectra, as shown in Fig. 3b and summarized in Table 1. Obviously, the EQE is improved across the 300 to 900 nm range as a result of light harvesting enhancement, on one hand, and more efficient exciton dissociation and higher charge carrier generation, on the other hand. Further increase in the FAPbI3 content led to the gradual reduction in Jsc and EQE. However, upon adding more than 15 wt% NCs into the host matrix Jsc drops significantly. This result may indicate that the charge transport pathways could be severely destroyed by higher amounts of NCs. The aforementioned is supported by the FF reduction in devices containing more than 15 wt% FAPbI3. The trend of Jsc at different FAPbI3 concentrations resulted in good agreement with the EQE spectra. At low NC concentrations of up to 10 wt%, the EQE is improved in the range from 350 to 800 nm, in general, and in the range below 600 nm, in particular, where NCs have a strong absorption. Interestingly, the EQE spectrum of the device comprising 5 wt% FAPbI3 is red shifted, which could be attributed to the better ordering of the polymer segments, as discussed above. Finally, the PCE also shows the same trend as Jsc (see Table 1), indicating that Jsc variations play the main role in the final performance.
To further study the impact of the sensitizer blending on charge generation, we measured Jph as a function of the effective voltage (Veff), as shown in Fig. 3c. The photocurrent was calculated by means of Jph = Jl − Jd, where Jl and Jd are the current density under illumination at 100 mW cm−2 and in the dark, respectively. Veff is given by Veff = V0 − V, where V0 is the compensation voltage defined as Jph (V0) = 0, and V is the applied voltage. The J–V plots indicated that Jph quickly saturates for Veff > 0.5 V. At full saturation, all generated electron–hole pairs are supposed to be dissociated and collected at the electrodes. This allows us to estimate the maximum generation rate of free charge carriers (Gmax) according to Jsat = qGmaxL, where q is the electronic charge and L is the active layer thickness.32 The values of Gmax for the reference binary and the sensitizer blended ternary devices are calculated and listed in Table 1.
The Gmax values for ternary devices are all greater than those of the reference binary device and the best one is achieved by 5 wt% FAPbI3 with a value of 1.01 × 1022 cm−3 s−1 which is approximately 18% higher than its binary counterpart. The trend is consistent with the enhancement of Jsc for ternary systems compared to the binary system, indicating more efficient exciton generation and separation in the presence of the sensitizer.
To further study the relationship between the addition of sensitizer and device performance, the charge transport of the aforementioned systems was investigated in detail. By employing the technique of photo-induced charge carrier extraction by linearly increasing voltage (photo-CELIV),33 the charge carrier mobility (μ) of devices based on DPP:PC61BM blended with different ratios of FAPbI3 perovskite NCs was investigated (Fig. 3d and Table 1). From the measured photocurrent transients, tmax, which occurs at the maximum extracted photocurrent, is determined and the charge carrier mobility (μ) is calculated by employing: (1)Here, d is the active layer thickness, A is the voltage rise speed A = dU/dt, U is the applied voltage, and j(0) is the displacement current. The photocurrent transients in Fig. 3d reveal that tmax slightly increases for higher amounts of perovskite (10 and 15 wt%). Moreover, broader decay peaks obtained for the devices featuring 10 and 15 wt% NCs are a result of more trap-assisted recombination, which is discussed later. Additionally, the calculated average charge carrier mobility is quite similar to the reference at low NC concentrations and drops at NC concentrations higher than 10 wt%. All these results are in good agreement with the fill factor trend obtained from J–V curves.
To elucidate photovoltaic loss mechanisms due to FAPbI3 introduction, we investigated the light intensity dependency (Pin) of the short circuit current density and open circuit voltage (Fig. 4a and b, respectively). In the case of organic semiconductors, Jsc typically follows a power-law dependence on the light intensity (Pin) according to Jsc ∝ PSin, where S is a power-law scaling exponent. In general, a linear dependence of current density with light intensity (S ≈ 1) suggests weak or no second-order recombination, while a sub-linear dependence (S < 1) indicates charge-transport limited behavior due to second-order recombination.12 As shown in Fig. 4a, S is 0.97 for reference binary devices and increases to 0.99 for the cells comprising 5 and 10% perovskite NCs. Further increase of the NC content leads to the reduction of S to a value of 0.94. Consequently, bimolecular recombination losses affect charge transport in the case of the ternary blend with a high amount of NCs.
 Fig. 4  (a) Short circuit current; and (b) open circuit voltage as a function of light intensity for reference and hybrid solar cells with different FAPbI3 content. 
We further evaluated the light intensity dependence of the open circuit voltage (Fig. 4b). This measurement provides direct insight into the role of trap-assisted recombination versus second-order recombination under open circuit conditions.12 In particular, the slope of Vocversus ln(Pin) should equal kT/q in the case of second-order recombination; while in the presence of additional trap-assisted recombination losses, a stronger dependency of Voc on the light intensity is expected.12 From Fig. 4b, we extract a slope of 1.09kT/q for DPP:PC61BM reference devices. Introducing 5 wt% NCs does not affect the overall slope, while in the case of devices containing 10 and 15 wt% perovskite NCs the slope of light intensity versus Voc increases to 1.27 and 1.28kT/q, respectively. Our results suggest that the ternary blend with a low amount of NCs (5 wt%) does not suffer from trap-assisted recombination, while further increase of the NC content results in trap induced recombination. These results are consistent with the reduced FF of the photovoltaic devices featuring high concentrations of perovskite NCs.
Keeping all these results in mind, the charge carrier transfer mechanism in DPP:FAPbI3:PC61BM ternary blends and the lifetime of the transient species were studied with femto-second pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). In this way, it is possible to obtain insights about transient processes such as the generation and splitting of excitons, and their recombination using different time delays from picosecond up to nanoseconds. Fs-TAS assays were performed on solid-state thin films of binary and ternary blends as well as a DPP reference deposited on glass using the doctor-blade coating technique with the same conditions as the fabrication of their respective devices. The transient absorption spectra in both visible and NIR regions were recorded upon 775 nm laser excitation with a power of 400 nJ to selectively excite DPP. As the samples were prepared without any charge carrier transporting layer or electrodes, no electric field is present within the layer, hence all photogenerated charge carriers eventually recombine to the ground state similar to open circuit conditions.
First, the transient absorption spectra of DPP as well as the binary blends of DPP:PC61BM (1:2 wt%) and DPP:FAPbI3 (1:1 wt%) were examined. As shown in Fig. 5a, the DPP singlet excited state (black) exhibits ground state bleaching (GSB) at 448, 634, and 703 nm as well as photoinduced absorption (PIA) at 520 and above 800 nm extending further into the NIR range with a pronounced signal centered at 1190 nm. The PIA overlaps with the stimulated emission (SE) at around 840 nm (see Fig. S5, ESI†). This radiative process (DPP* → DPP) is the main recombination pathway; however, a new PIA signal centered at 600 nm appears after 120 ps (see Fig. S3a, ESI†). The time profiles of the 600 nm maximum (see Fig. S4, ESI†) as well as at a wavelength at which the singlet has no transient – i.e. 557 nm – show no decay compared to the singlet GSB and, in turn, are assigned to the triplet excited state (blue) (see Fig. 5a, 3× enhanced signal). The charge-separation in DPP:PC61BM (1:2 wt%) and DPP:FAPbI3 (1:1 wt%) binary blends is presented in Fig. 5b and c, respectively. After 2 ps, for DPP:PC61BM the DPP cation peaks at 850 and 1437 nm emerge as seen in the spectro-electrochemical results of Fig. 5a, proving the charge separation at the interface of the polymer and PC61BM. Already after 40 ps the intensity of the DPP cation is strongly reduced in intensity, indicating recombination processes such as non-geminate recombination between the positive and negative charge carriers located on DPP and PC61BM, respectively, and DPP triplet excited state formation as it is energetically lower than that of the charge separated state.34,35 Fs-TAS assays of DPP:FAPbI3 blends show the same red shift as in the absorption measurements, and a pronounced SE signal at 820 nm (see Fig. S5, ESI†). In contrast to the PL measurements shown in Fig. 2b, in the fs-TAS assay DPP was selectively excited in order to evaluate the charge carrier transfer. In this context, it is of interest that the differential absorption spectrum, after a delay time of 40 ps, shows strong FAPbI3 contributions – i.e. the GSB is further red-shifted – and a weak DPP cation peak. The tri-exponential kinetic traces at 681 and 756 nm, respectively, deviate after 6 ps (see Fig. S4c, ESI†). After the charge transfer across the interface of DPP and FAPbI3, the GSB signal of the latter reveals a slower bi-exponential recombination – i.e. 3 × 1010 and 20 × 1010 s−1 – when compared to DPP – i.e. 0.14 × 1010 and 1.3 × 1010 s−1. Hence, we can conclude that charge carriers are injected into the FAPbI3 NCs already within the first 10 ps, but their annihilation takes about five times longer than the recombination processes in the polymer itself. In a control experiment of the PC61BM:FAPbI3 blend no signal was observed (see Fig. S3c, ESI†).

Finally, the ternary blends of DPP:FAPbI3:PC61BM with a DPP-to-PC61BM ratio of 1:2 wt% and perovskite contents of either 0.05 (Fig. 5d, and Fig. S2e, ESI†) or 0.1 wt% (Fig. S3f, ESI†) were investigated. The differential absorption spectra of the ternary blends containing 5 and 10 wt% perovskite feature GSB signals at 448, 634, and 703 nm, an SE at 840 nm, and DPP cation signals at 850 and 1437 nm after 2 ps. But, the kinetics differ slightly from those of the binary blend. This is reflected in longer lifetimes of the DPP cation signature at 1437 nm (see Fig. 5d, right, and Fig. S3b, ESI†) and in the recovery of DPP GSB due to faster charge-separated state formation (see Fig. S4c, ESI†) via the FAPbI3 NCs. Both fast formation and a long lifetime of the charge-separated state are important for improved solar cell performance; they reduce the possibility of recombination prior to the charge carrier collection at the electrodes.
From the charge-separated state, the DPP triplet exited state can be populated – vide supra. In this way, all blends, DPP:PC61BM, DPP:FAPbI3, and DPP:FAPbI3:PC61BM, exhibit signals of the DPP triplet excited state (see Fig. S6, ESI†) after 1.3 ns. In the case of the DPP:FAPbI3 binary blend the triplet excited state signal is only tenuous. Moreover, it is shorter lived compared to the signal of DPP and DPP:PC61BM; it is assumed that the DPP triplet excited state is not populated by reinjection of electrons from the FAPbI3 NCs.
In order to analyze the lifetimes of the described states, target analysis was performed using Glotaran with the models shown in Fig. 6a.36 The resulting species associated spectra as well as the state population and lifetimes in the binary and ternary blends are presented in Fig. 6b, c and Fig. S6 (ESI†) and Table 2, respectively. The corresponding fits of the corresponding traces are presented in Fig. S8 (ESI†). Due to two possible injection pathways – i.e. FAPbI3 NCs and PC61BM – the lifetime of the singlet excited state (τ1) is reduced from 1.4 to 0.6 ps upon adding FAPbI3 NCs. The lifetimes of the charge transfer states at the interfaces of DPP:PC61BM (τ2, reference: 31 ps; ternary blend: 45 ± 4 ps) and DPP:FAPbI3 (τ3, 4.4 ± 0.4 ps) were found to increase slightly with increasing perovskite content. The lifetime of the charge-separated state (τ4), generated not only from the charge transfer at the polymer–fullerene interface but also from injection of electrons from the perovskite into the fullerene, is the longest for the ternary blend containing 5 wt% FAPbI3 NCs (607 ps). As a result, there is slower recombination and triplet excited state formation when a small amount of perovskite NCs is present. This is explainable by a smaller interface between DPP and PC61BM, and by FAPbI3 NCs, which are located at the interface of DPP and PC61BM, as it happens in other ternary blends.37 Increasing the FAPbI3 NC amount further, the lifetime of the charge-separated state is shortened, which reflects the solar cell performance and is caused by the perovskite influence on the order of the blend – vide supra.

In addition to other charge transfer pathways and free charge carrier recombinations at the DPP/PC61BM interfaces in the presence of small amounts of FAPbI3 NCs, the delayed recombination kinetics are partially attributed to a larger effective dielectric constant in the hybrid ternary blends compared to the organic binary blend. This hypothesis is confirmed by measuring the capacitance of binary and ternary devices versus frequency, as shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). According to these results, the capacitance increases in the low frequency range for the ternary devices compared to the binary DPP:PC61BM blend due to the higher dielectric constant stemming from FAPbI3 NCs. In conclusion, we observed that electrons are injected from DPP's singlet excited state into perovskite NCs and, subsequently, transferred to PC61BM, resulting in a charge-separated state.
For ternary solar cells comprising small amounts of FAPbI3 NCs, the additional pathway via the NCs accelerates the depopulation of the DPP singlet excited state but slightly slows down the charge-separation process between DPP and PC61BM (longer-lived CT state species). Importantly, on the other hand, the loss processes – i.e. charge carrier recombination and triplet state formation – are slowed down, improving the solar cell efficiency.
Experimental
Materials
Formamidine acetate salt (HN = CHNH2 × CH3COOH, 99%), lead(II) iodide (PbI2, 99.999% trace metals basis), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%), hydroiodic acid (HI, 57% in water), and acetonitrile anhydrous (CH3CN, 99.8%) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Chloroform (>99%) and toluene (>99%) were purchased from Merck Millipore. Oleylamine (approximate C18-content 80–90%) was purchased from Acros Organics. Oleic acid (97%) was purchased from VWR Chemicals. Diketopyrrolopyrrole–quinquethiophene alternating copolymer pDPP5T-2 was provided by BASF and phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC61BM) was supplied by Solenne BV with a purity of 99.5%.
Formamidinium iodide (FAI) synthesis
FAI was synthesized according to the method reported by Eperon et al.38 Briefly, formamidinium acetate powder in a 2× molar excess of 57% w/w hydroiodic acid was mixed at 0 °C and the mixture was left stirring for 1 h. Upon drying at 100 °C, a yellow-white powder is formed. This was then washed with diethyl ether and recrystallized twice with ethanol, to form white crystals. Before use, it was dried overnight in a vacuum oven.
FAPbI3 NC synthesis
Nanocrystals were synthesized according to our previously reported method.29 FAI (0.0159 g, 0.1 mmol) and PbI2 (0.0461, 0.1 mmol) were dissolved in 1 ml of DMF forming a 0.1 mM solution. Then, 200 μl of oleic acid and 150 μl oleylamine were added. Next, 100 μl of this mixture was injected into anti-solvent (chloroform) media. For purification, the obtained NC solution was precipitated once with 1 ml of acetonitrile/toluene (1:1) mixture followed by centrifugation at 9000 rpm for 2 min. Thus, the obtained NCs were fully dispersible in nonpolar solvents such as hexane, toluene, chloroform etc.
Photovoltaic device fabrication
All devices were fabricated using the doctor-blade coating technique under ambient conditions with the inverted structure as shown in Fig. 2a. Pre-structured ITO substrates were cleaned with ultrasonication in an acetone and isopropyl bath each for 10 min, followed by drying. The substrates were coated with 40 nm of zinc oxide (ZnO), and 10 nm of Ba(OH)2 as electron transporting layers. An approximately 90 nm thick active layer based on pDPP5T-2 and PC61BM [DPP:PC61BM with a concentration of 20 g L−1 in a mixture of chloroform and 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) (9:1 volume-ratio)] with and without FAPbI3 NCs was coated on top, followed by thermal evaporation of 10 nm of MoOx (as a hole transporting layer) and 100 nm of Ag under a vacuum of ≈2 × 10−6 mbar. For all samples the overall polymer to fullerene/FAPbI3 NCs ratio was kept at 1:2 by weight fraction. The active layer thickness was approximately the same for all devices. The area of each working device was 10.4 mm2 and the reported performance parameters are the average values collected from 10 devices for each composition. The chemical structures of the used materials are presented in Fig. 2a.
Measurements

Photovoltaic characterization. 
The J–V characteristics were measured using a source measurement unit from BoTest. Illumination was provided by a solar simulator (Oriel Sol 1A, from Newport) with an AM1.5G spectrum at 100 mW cm−2. The solar simulator was calibrated using a silicon diode before use. External quantum efficiency (EQE) was measured with the QE-R Solar Cell Spectral Response Measurement System from Enli Technology Company. The optical absorbance of the samples was analyzed using the Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UV/vis spectrometer.


FT-IR spectroscopy. 
FT-IR spectra were recorded with a VERTEX-70 spectrometer (Bruker Optik GmbH) using the attenuated total reflection method.


X-ray powder diffraction (XRD). 
X-ray diffraction analysis was performed in the classical ex situ Bragg–Brentano geometry using a Panalytical X'pert powder diffractometer with filtered Cu-Kα radiation and an X'Celerator solid-state stripe detector. A concentrated chloroform/toluene solution of nanocrystals was drop cast on a zero background silicon wafer.


Transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 
TEM was performed using a PHILIPS CM 300 UT high-resolution transmission electron microscope (300 kV acceleration voltage, and 0.17 nm point resolution at Scherzer defocus), equipped with a LaB6 filament and a CCD camera with an image size of 2048 × 2048 pixels. Samples for TEM were prepared by casting one drop of the NC solution in hexane or toluene onto a standard copper grid coated with a continuous amorphous carbon film. The size distribution and thicknesses of NCs were obtained from the TEM image with ImageJ software.


Optical measurements of NCs. 
The absorption spectra of the NC dispersions were measured using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 950 spectrometer and emission spectra using a spectrofluorometer Jasco FP-8500. The emission spectra were corrected for the wavelength-dependent spectral responsivity of the fluorometer.


Photoluminescence (PL) measurement. 
The PL emission of the films was dispersed by a 600 lines mm−1 grating monochromator (HRS-2) and detected by an indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detector (ADC 403L) through the lock-in technique. PL characterization of the prepared photoactive layers was probed by laser excitation at a 405 nm wavelength. The fluorescence spectrum was corrected for the optical density of the sample at the excitation wavelength.


Absolute measurement of the photoluminescence quantum efficiency. 
The samples were mounted in an integrating sphere, connected to an iHR 320 monochromator (Jobin-Yvon) with an optical fiber. The spectra were recorded with a Si CCD (Syncerity, Jobin-Yvon) camera and corrected for the spectral sensitivity of the setup, determined with the help of a calibrated Xe lamp (Hamamatsu).


Femto-second pump–probe transient absorption spectroscopy (fs-TAS). 
Fs-TAS experiments were performed with an amplified Ti–sapphire CPA-2110 laser system (Clark MXR Inc.: output 775 nm, 1 kHz, 150 fs pulse width, and 400 nJ per pulse) and detected using a HELIOS transient absorption spectrometer (Ultrafast Systems LLC). The required excitation wavelength was produced by a non-collinear Optical Parametric Amplifier (NOPA, Clark MXR). The samples were measured at room temperature and in a home build nitrogen-purged atmosphere chamber.


Photo-CELIV measurements. 
In photo-CELIV measurements, the devices were illuminated with a 405 nm laser diode. Current transients were recorded across the internal 50 Ω resistor of an oscilloscope (Agilent Technologies DSO-X 2024A). We used a fast electrical switch to isolate the cell and prevent charge extraction or sweep out during the laser pulse and the delay time. After a variable delay time, a linear extraction ramp is applied via a function generator. The ramp, which was 20 μs long and 2 V in amplitude, was set to start with an offset matching the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the cell for each delay time. Results are modified by taking into account the dark signal (thickness and area) for comparison of intensity.


Impedance spectroscopy measurements. 
Impedance spectroscopy measurements were conducted using an Agilent 4294A impedance analyzer. The impedance measurements were done in C-f mode, with the frequency ranging between 40 Hz and 1 MHz, and with an amplitude of the harmonic voltage modulation of 20 mV. A constant dc bias, equivalent to the open-circuit voltage of solar cells, was superimposed on the ac signal.

Conclusions
In summary, novel bulk heterojunction hybrid solar cells based on DPP:PC61BM:FAPbI3 perovskite NCs were fabricated and thoroughly studied. The solar conversion efficiency was improved upon incorporation of 5 wt% perovskite NCs as the result of multi-ameliorating factors: (i) enlarged photon harvesting, (ii) accelerated exciton splitting owing to more dissociation pathways on the one hand and an enhanced effective dielectric constant on the other hand; (iii) higher charge carrier generation, (iv) decelerated recombination dynamics, and (v) a modified transport mechanism. The charge carrier transfer mechanism and the lifetime of the transient species were comprehensively studied by using fs-TAS. In sound agreement with the photovoltaic findings, fs-TAS results revealed longer recombination times for the ternary films compared to the DPP:PC61BM reference film due to the formation of an additional pathway for the charge-separated state using a small amount of FAPbI3 NCs which, despite accelerating the depopulation of DPP's singlet excited state, slightly slowed down the charge-separation process between DPP and PC61BM. Our findings revealed improved solar cell efficiency by loading limited perovskite NCs, however; to further boost the performance of hybrid systems, more advanced device engineering, morphology control, and ligand design are required.
