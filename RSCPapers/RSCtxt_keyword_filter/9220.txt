We report a novel approach to develop photovoltaic polymers suitable for non-halogenated solvent processing by attaching a polar and inert phosphonate moiety to the side chain of conventional photovoltaic polymers. The pendant phosphonate moiety does not obviously affect the electronic structure of the conjugated polymer backbone but greatly changes the solubility of the polymers. The phosphonated polymers are soluble in several polar non-halogenated solvents, such as methoxybenzene (MOB), methylbenzoate (MBz), o-dimethoxybenzene (o-DMOB), etc. PSCs of the phosphonated polymers processed with MOB exhibit better photovoltaic performances than those of the devices processed with common halogenated solvents. A power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 2.11% is achieved with the device processed with MOB, in comparison to the PCE of 0.90% with chlorobenzene (CB) as the processing solvent and the PCE of 1.59% with o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB) as the processing solvent. These results indicate that a pendant phosphonate moiety is an effective approach to developing photovoltaic polymers towards the production of PSCs fabricated using environmentally friendly solvents.
Introduction
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have recently received much attention due to their great advantages of low-cost, light weight and flexibility.1–4 In the past decade, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of PSCs has increased rapidly to around 10%, which is close to the critical point of industrialization.5–15 For the large-scale manufacturing of PSCs, the impact of processing solvents on the environment must be seriously considered.16–19 Until now, the most widely used solvents for PSC device fabrication are some halogenated solvents, such as chlorobenzene (CB) and o-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB), which are harmful to the environment and to human health. These halogenated solvents cannot be used in the large-scale manufacturing of PSCs. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop PSC devices and materials suitable for PSCs processed with non-halogenated solvents.20–26
Normal donor polymers are suitable for processing with halogenated solvents because they have non-polar alkyl side chains for solubility in halogenated solvents with low polarity. To make donor polymers suitable for non-halogenated solvent processing, the general strategy is to increase the polarity of the side chains, including, (i) replacing alkyl chains with oligo(ethylene oxide) chains25 and (ii) attaching polar moieties (e.g. a tertiary amine unit) to the alkyl side chains.26 However, hydrophilic oligo(ethylene oxide) side chains greatly change the ordered solid-state organization of a hydrophobic conjugated polymer backbone and result in great difficulty in the control of the active layer morphology in PSC devices.25 Polar moieties are always opto-electronically active and can be deleterious to the PSC device performance.26 For example, Huang et al. reported donor polymer-bearing pendant tertiary amino moieties which could be processed with butanol.26 Owing to the charge trapping of the tertiary amino moieties, the polymer exhibited no photovoltaic response when used in the active layer of PSCs. Indeed, PSCs processed with pure polar non-halogenated solvents all exhibit poor photovoltaic performance with PCE lower than 2%. In this manuscript, we report a novel approach to the design of donor polymers suitable for polar non-halogenated solvent processing by attaching an inert and polar phosphonate moiety to the side chain of normal donor polymers.
Previously, we have found that a pendant phosphonate moiety can make conjugated polymers soluble in polar organic solvents (e.g. ethanol) and that pendant phosphonate moieties do not affect the electronic structure of a conjugated polymer backbone.27–31 Tu et al. have also used phosphonate moieties to develop amphiphilic conjugated polymers.32 The polar and inert properties of phosphonate moieties enable us to design donor polymers suitable for non-halogenated solvent processing by changing the solubilizing behavior of normal donor polymers without affecting the opto-electronic properties of the conjugated polymer backbone.27,28 Among the reported donor polymers, the PCDTBT series of polymers with alternating carbazole and 4,7-dithienyl-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole units (see Scheme 1) are particularly attractive and can give a PCE higher than 7%.33–36 Herein, we introduce phosphonate moieties to the side chain of a PCDTBT analogous polymer backbone to develop two new polymers, P1-Pho and P2-Pho. Scheme 1 shows their chemical structures. Both the two polymers exhibit good solubility in some polar non-halogenated solvents, such as methoxybenzene (MOB), methylbenzoate (MBz), o-dimethoxybenzene (o-DMOB), etc. PSC devices of the two phosphonated polymers processed with MOB show better photovoltaic performance than those of the devices processed with halogenated solvents, CB or o-DCB. A PCE of 2.11% is demonstrated with P2-Pho processed with MOB, which is among the highest reported for PSCs fabricated with a pure non-halogenated solvent without additives.25,26

Results and discussion
Synthesis and characterization

Scheme 1 shows the chemical structures of P1-Pho and P2-Pho, as well as the corresponding polymers without pendant phosphonate moieties, P1 and P2. The synthetic routes for P1-Pho and P2-Pho are depicted in Scheme 2. The phosphonate-functionalized monomer 3 was synthesized following the procedures in our previous publication.31 The monomers 7 and 10 were prepared through a sequential Stille coupling and bromination reaction starting from 4. We synthesized P1-Pho and P2-Pho using Pd(0)-catalyzed Suzuki polycondensation with the diboronic ester monomer and the dibromo monomer. The chemical structures of the polymers are confirmed by 1H NMR and elemental analysis. Their molecular weights were estimated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) using tetrahydrofuran (THF) as the eluent and monodisperse polystyrene as the standards. The number-average molecular weight (Mn) and polydispersity index (PDI) of P1-Pho and P2-Pho are 41300, 2.4 and 55100, 3.3, respectively (see Table 1). According to thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), both P1-Pho and P2-Pho have good thermal stability with thermal degradation temperatures (Td) higher than 300 °C (Table 1).

Photophysical properties
UV-Vis absorption spectra in an o-DCB solution at 90 °C and in a film of P1-Pho, P2-Pho, P1 and P2 are shown in Fig. 1. P1-Pho in solution presents two absorption band peaks at 391 and 523 nm, which are attributed to the π–π* transition and the charge transfer of the conjugated polymer backbone, respectively.37 In a solid film, the two absorption peaks red-shift to 394 and 540 nm, respectively, due to the strong interaction of polymer chains in the solid state. The absorption spectra in solution and in a film of P1-Pho resemble those of P1 (Fig. 1a); a similar phenomenon is observed in the absorption spectra of P2-Pho and P2 (Fig. 1b). These results indicate that the phosphonate moieties on the side chain of P1-Pho and P2-Pho do not obviously affect the electronic properties of the conjugated polymer backbone.27–31 Compared with that of P1-Pho, the absorption spectrum of P2-Pho in solution is red-shifted by 18 nm because of the more effective conjugation with the thieno[3,2,b]thiophene unit in P2-Pho.37,38 The onsets of the absorptions of P1-Pho and P2-Pho in a film are 618 nm and 644 nm, corresponding to optical bandgaps of 2.01 eV and 1.93 eV, respectively.

Solubility

P1 and P2 are soluble in halogenated CB and o-DCB. However, in some aromatic non-halogenated solvents, such as MOB, o-DMOB and MBz, P1 is poorly soluble and P2 is insoluble. In contrast, P1-Pho and P2-Pho are both readily soluble in either halogenated CB and o-DCB or non-halogenated MOB, o-DMOB and MBz. The good solubility of P1-Pho and P2-Pho in the non-halogenated aromatic organic solvents is ascribed to the pendant polar phosphonate moieties. To confirm the dissolving of the polymers, we measured the absorption spectra of P1-Pho and P2-Pho in different solvents and in a film. As shown in Fig. 2, for both P1-Pho and P2-Pho, the absorption spectra in all the solvents are blue-shifted by 20–30 nm compared to in a film, suggesting that the two polymers are well dissolved in all the solvents rather than dispersed in the solvents.

Electrochemical properties
To determine the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out with the polymer films spin-coated on a glassy carbon working electrode. As shown in Fig. 3, all four polymers show both oxidation waves and reduction waves assigned to the polymer backbone. The onset oxidation/reduction potentials of P1-Pho and P2-Pho are 0.57 V/−1.65 V and 0.36 V/−1.63 V, respectively (see Table 2). Compared to the corresponding polymers without pendant phosphonate moieties, P1-Pho and P2-Pho exhibit slightly lower onset oxidation potential and slightly higher onset reduction potential by 0.10–0.12 V.27,28,31 Based on the onset oxidation/reduction potential, we estimated the HOMO/LUMO energy levels of the polymers and summarize the results in Table 2. P1-Pho and P2-Pho have HOMO/LUMO energy levels of −5.37 eV/−3.15 eV and −5.16 eV/−3.17 eV, respectively.

Photovoltaic properties
In view of the solubility of P1-Pho and P2-Pho, MOB, MBz and o-DMOB seem to be suitable for PSC device fabrication. Among the three solvents, MBz and o-DMOB have high boiling points exceeding 200 °C, which leads to difficulty in film formation with solution processing. Fortunately, MOB with a medium boiling point of 153 °C is very suitable for PSC device fabrication. Therefore, we selected MOB as the non-halogenated solvent to fabricate PSCs.
PSC devices with all four polymers were prepared with the device structure of indium tin oxide (ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS)/polymer:PC61BM/LiF/Al. The ratio of polymer:PC61BM in the active layer was fixed to be 1:4. To test the effect of the processing solvent on device performance, the non-halogenated solvent MOB and classical halogenated solvents CB and o-DCB were used for all four polymers. We failed to fabricate the device of P2 with MOB as the solvent because P2 was insoluble in MOB. The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics and external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves of the devices under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW cm−2 are shown in Fig. 4 and 6. The corresponding device performance data are summarized in Table 3.

Fig. 4a shows the J–V curves of the P1-Pho devices processed with different solvents. The device with CB as the processing solvent exhibits a low PCE of 0.43%, probably due to the poor solubility of P1-Pho in CB. In comparison, using MOB as the processing solvent, the device shows good photovoltaic performance with an open-circuit voltage (VOC) of 0.81 V, a short-circuit current density (JSC) of 5.05 mA cm−2, and a fill factor (FF) of 0.44, corresponding to a PCE of 1.79%. This performance is much better than that in the case of CB (PCE = 0.43%) and is fairly comparable to that in the case of o-DCB (PCE = 1.70%), indicating that MOB is a suitable processing solvent for the phosphonate-functionalized polymer P1-Pho. For P1 without pendant phosphonate moieties, as usual, the halogenated solvent o-DCB affords better device performance than that with the non-halogenated solvent MOB (Fig. 4c and d). The PCE of the device of P1:PC61BM processed with CB is lower than that of our previous report for P1:PC71BM because of the different electron-acceptor materials in the PSC devices. The trend of the PSC device performance of P1-Pho and P1 processed with the three solvents is confirmed by the EQE curves (Fig. 4b and d). Comparison of the effect of processing solvents on the PSC device performance of P1 and P1-Pho suggests that the pendant phosphate moieties make the resulting polymer more suitable for processing with the non-halogenated solvent MOB without sacrifice of the overall device performance. We notice that VOC of device of P1-Pho seems to be lower than that of P1. The reason for the VOC difference is not yet clear and needs further investigation.
The processing solvent plays an important role in the phase separation morphology of the donor:acceptor blend in active layers of PSCs. It is widely accepted that bicontinuous interpenetrating network morphology is desirable for efficient charge separation and transportation to give excellent photovoltaic performance.39,40 We have used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to investigate the morphologies of the films of a P1-Pho:PC61BM blend and a P1:PC61BM blend processed with MOB or CB. The results are shown in Fig. 5. The bicontinuous interpenetrating network morphology can be observed for P1-Pho:PC61BM processed with MOB (Fig. 5a) and for P1:PC61BM processed with CB (Fig. 5d), despite domain sizes (>50 nm) larger than ideal. These morphologies are consistent with the reasonable photovoltaic performance of the two devices. In comparison, severe phase separation is observed for P1-Pho processed with CB (Fig. 5b), which would likely confine charge carriers in the segregated domains and decrease the device photovoltaic efficiency.

As shown in Fig. 6c and 6d, P2 exhibits good photovoltaic performance when processed with CB or o-DCB. However, P2 cannot be solution-processed with MOB because of insolubility. For P2-Pho functionalized with pendant phosphonate moieties, the device processed with MOB exhibits the VOC of 0.80 V, JSC of 5.48 mA cm−2, FF of 0.48, corresponding to the PCE of 2.11% (Fig. 6a). This performance is much better than that of the device processed with CB (PCE = 0.90%) or o-DCB (PCE = 1.59%). To the best of our knowledge, the PCE of P2-Pho device processed with MOB is among the highest reported for PSCs processed with a single non-halogenated solvent without additives.21,22 Comparison of the J–V curves of the P2-Pho device processed with the three solvents (Fig. 6a) indicates that P2-Pho is suitable for processing with MOB rather than with CB or o-DCB. The TEM image of P2-Pho:PC61BM active layer shown in Fig. 7a also supports the good device performance when processed with MOB. The large phase separation of P2-Pho:PC61BM when processed with CB (Fig. 7b) is avoided when processed with MOB (Fig. 7a).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have successfully developed two polymers by introducing polar and inert phosphonate moieties to the side chain of a PCDTBT analogous polymer. The pendant phosphonate moiety has little effect on the electronic structure of the conjugated polymer backbone but makes the resulting polymers soluble in polar non-halogenated solvents, such as MOB, MBz, o-DMOB, etc. Moreover, the phosphonate moiety makes the polymers suitable for PSC device fabrication with the non-halogenated solvent MOB rather than with normal halogenated solvents, CB and o-DCB. PSC devices based on P2-Pho processed with MOB under AM1.5G illumination exhibit a PCE of 2.11%, which is higher than that of the devices processed with CB or o-DCB. This work suggests that a pendant phosphonate moiety is an effective approach to develop photovoltaic polymers towards PSCs fabricated with environmentally friendly solvents.

Synthesis of P1-Pho and P2-Pho
A mixture of diboronic acid monomer 3 (0.396 g, 0.426 mmol), 1.00 equiv. of dibromo monomer 7 or 10, Pd(PPh3)4 (0.005 g), Aliquat 336 (0.020 g), degassed toluene (12.0 mL) and aqueous K2CO3 (2.0 M, 1.3 mL) was vigorously stirred at 100 °C under an argon atmosphere. After 24 hours, phenyl boric acid (0.30 mL 0.5 M solution in anhydrous toluene) was added to the reaction mixture and stirred for 4 hours; then bromobenzene (0.10 mL) was added and stirred for another 4 hours. After being cooled down, the resulting mixture was poured into methanol (100 mL) and the precipitate was collected by filtration. The crude polymer was washed in a Soxhlet apparatus sequentially with acetone, n-hexane and THF. The THF fraction was concentrated and poured into methanol. The polymer fiber was recovered by filtration and dried in a vacuum overnight.

PSC devices fabrication and measurement
ITO glasses were cleaned successively with detergent, deionized water, acetone and isopropyl alcohol in an ultrasonic bath for 10 minutes each. After being dried at 120 °C for 30 minutes, the ITO glasses were treated with UV-ozone for 25 minutes. PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P AI 4083) was then spin-coated on the ITO glasses at 5000 rpm for 1 minute and baked at 120 °C for 30 minutes to give a thickness of 40 nm. The polymer:PC61BM active layer was deposited on the PEDOT:PSS layer by spin-coating with the solution of polymer (7.0 mg mL−1) and PC61BM (28.0 mg mL−1) in MOB, CB or o-DCB at 1000 rpm for 2 minutes, followed by heating at 70 °C for 15 minutes. Finally, the device was transferred to a vacuum chamber where LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) were successively deposited at a pressure of ca. 4 × 10−4 Pa. All the device fabrications were carried out under ambient conditions. The active area of each device was 8 mm2.
The current density–voltage (J–V) curves were recorded with a Keithley 236 source meter under AM 1.5G irradiation with a light intensity of 100 mW cm−2 (Oriel solar simulator, 150 W). The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves were measured under short-circuit conditions with monochromatic light from a Xenon lamp, and a lock-in amplifier (SR830, Stanford Research System) at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz.
Characterization

1H NMR spectra of the polymers were recorded on a Bruker AV-400 spectrometer with d4-o-DCB as the solvent at 125 °C. Elemental analysis was performed with a Bio-Rad elemental analysis system. GPC was recorded at 35 °C with a Waters 410 instrument using THF as the eluent and monodisperse polystyrene as the standard. Thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed under a nitrogen with a Perkin-Elmer-TGA 7 system. UV-visible absorption spectroscopy was carried out with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 35 UV-Vis spectrometer. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was performed on a CHI660a electrochemical analyzer system using a glassy carbon working electrode, a platinum gauze counter electrode and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode in an argon-saturated solution of 0.1 M Bu4NClO4 in acetonitrile. The polymers were spin-coated on the working electrode for measurement. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on a JEOL JEM-1011 transmission electron microscope system, and the blend films for TEM measurements were prepared using the “floating off” method.
