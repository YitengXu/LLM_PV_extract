    , Accepted 6th August 2012First published on 8th August 2012AbstractDonor–acceptor conjugated polymers based on benzo[1,2-b:5,4-b′]difuran (syn-BDF) or benzo[1,2-b:5,4-b′]difuran (anti-BDF) as donors and isoindigo as acceptors were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling reaction. The effects of syn- and anti-repeating units on optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of polymers were investigated. The anti-PBDFID displayed lower optical bandgap and higher HOMO energy level than syn-PBDFID. The syn-PBDFID had better solubility than anti-PBDFID. The energy levels of two new polymers were compared with some related benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes (BDTs) based polymers. The results suggested that the utilization of less conjugated repeating units such as syn-BDF and the elimination of electron donating groups on the central phenyl ring of BDF can effectively lower the HOMO energy level of polymer. The low HOMO energy level of syn-PBDFID enabled high open circuit voltages in PSC devices.
Introduction
Research on conjugated polymers for organic photovoltaic (OPV) applications has attracted much attention. Polymer solar cells (PSCs) are considered to be a promising alternative for producing clean energy at low cost. Many new conjugated polymers have been synthesized and achieved high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in PSC devices.1–11 Design of new monomers may open up new possibilities for novel polymers with tailored optical and electrochemical properties.12–18 Recently, benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes (BDTs) with rigid planar π-conjugated structures and tunable redox properties have been successfully incorporated into many high performance polymers for OPV applications.19–21 Furan contains only the first row elements. Oligofurans have shown tighter packing and smaller reorganization energy than their thiophene counterparts.22 Furan based materials also show significantly improved solubilities.23,24 Furans have become attractive building blocks for the synthesis of conjugated polymers. The furanyl counterparts of BDTs have also been synthesized. The polymers based on alkoxy substituted benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difurans (BDFs) showed smaller optical bandgap than the related polymers based on BDTs. The BDF based polymers also displayed comparable PSC device performances as the related polymers based on BDTs.25,26
Due to the electron-rich character of furan, oligo- and polyfurans are more electron-rich than their thienyl counterparts.22–24 The polymers containing furanyl moieties frequently show higher HOMO energy levels than similar polymers containing thienyl moieties.22,25 The PCE is the product of the short-circuit current density (Jsc), open circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) divided by the incoming light power density. It is known that the Voc of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cell devices with PCBM as acceptor is determined by the HOMO level of the donor and the LUMO level of the acceptor molecule.27 The high-lying HOMO of the polymer can limit the maximum open-circuit voltage and may cause oxidative instability of solar cell device at ambient conditions. In a donor–acceptor alternating polymer, the HOMO energy level is mainly determined by the electron-donor and the LUMO energy level is mainly related to the electron-acceptor.28 The design and synthesis of less electron-rich furan containing monomers are necessary to reduce the HOMO energy level of polymers and therefore for achieve high Voc in OPV devices. The benzodifuran have both syn- and anti-isomers. So far, only the alkoxy substituted anti-isomers have been studied as building blocks for synthesis of conjugated polymers.25,26Syn-isomers have never been used as repeating units in polymer. Herein, we reported the synthesis of both benzo[1,2-b:5,4-b′]difuran (syn-BDF) and benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran (anti-BDF) monomers. Both new monomers were designed without electron donating alkoxy groups on the central phenyl rings for increasing ionization potentials. Two new conjugated polymer syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID based on isoindigo as acceptors and syn- or anti-BDF as donors were synthesized. The optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties of polymers were investigated. The syn-PBDFID displayed lower HOMO energy level than anti-PBDFID. The syn-PBDFID also achieved higher Voc than anti-PBDFID in solar cell devices.
Results and discussion
1. Synthesis and characterization
The synthetic routes for monomers and polymers are shown in Scheme 1. The syn-BDF29 and anti-BDF were synthesized from dehydrogenation of 2,3,5,6-tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-b:5,4-b′]difuran and 2,3,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]difuran, respectively. The 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) was used as oxidation reagent. The bis(trimethylstannyl) monomer 1 and 3 were obtained through lithiation of corresponding BDFs and followed by quenching with trimethyltin chloride in 82% and 85% yield, respectively. The synthesis of isoindigo monomer was reported in our previous work.30 Isoindigo is an electron-deficient building block for conjugated polymers.31 The polymer syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID were synthesized by Stille cross-coupling reaction in the presence of tris(dibenzylidene-acetone)dipalladium as catalyst and tri-o-tolylphosphine as ligand. The polymers were purified by washing sequentially with methanol and hexane in a Soxhlet extractor for 24 h each, and then were extracted with hot chloroform in a Soxhlet extractor for 12 h. After removing solvent under reduced pressure, dark blue solids were collected. Polymer syn-PBDFID showed better solubility than polymer anti-PBDFID. syn-PBDFID was completely soluble in chloroform and chlorobenzene. A part of anti-PBDFID was not soluble in hot chloroform or chlorobenzene and cannot be extracted in hot chloroform solution. This resulted in low yield of anti-PBDFID. The low solubility of anti-PBDFID can be attributed to the strong interchain aggregation which was caused by linear structured repeating units.32

2. Thermal stability
Thermogravimetric analyses of syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID are shown in Fig. S9 (see ESI†). Both polymers showed good thermal stabilities with decomposition temperatures over 400 °C. Furan oligomers such as hexamer usually displayed relatively low decomposition temperatures (∼250 °C).22 The high decomposition temperatures of syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID indicated that fused aromatic structures did increase the thermal stabilities of materials. Neither polymers showed noticeable glass transition in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis (Fig. S10†).
3. Optical properties
The UV-vis absorption spectra of syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID in dilute chloroform solution are shown Fig. 1 (top) and the spectra of thin films are shown in Fig. 1 (bottom). The optical properties of polymers are summarized in Table 1. The maximum absorptions were at 651 nm and 692 nm for syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID in dilute chloroform solution, respectively; and the maximum absorptions were at 604 nm and 684 nm for syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID as thin film, respectively. The spectra of anti-PBDFID were red-shifted compared with the spectra of syn-PBDFID. The absorption maxima of polymer thin-films were slightly blue-shifted compared with the absorption maxima of the polymers in dilute chloroform solution for both polymers. Similar phenomenon were observed for other isoindigo-containing conjugated polymers.33 The onset absorption edges of the thin-films were at 715 nm and 754 nm for syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID, respectively. Accordingly, the optical bandgaps were calculated to be 1.73 eV and 1.64 eV for syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID, respectively (Table 1). The onset absorption edges of anti-PBDFID thin film showed a red-shift of 39 nm compared with that of syn-PBDFID thin-film. This red-shift indicated that anti-PBDFID had a better conjugation in polymer backbone than syn-PBDFID. The extended conjugation resulted in small bandgap through the reducing of the LUMO energy and raising of the HOMO energy.15

4. Electrochemical properties
The cyclic voltammograms of the polymers are displayed in Fig. S11,† and the electrochemical properties are summarized in Table 1. Both syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID showed semi-reversible oxidation cycles but no reduction cycle. The HOMO energy levels were calculated from the onset oxidations with reference to Fc/Fc+ at −4.8 V.34 The HOMO energy levels of syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID were −5.63 eV and −5.49 eV, respectively (Table 1). The LUMO energy levels of syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID were at −3.90 eV and −3.85 eV, which were calculated from the optical band gap and HOMO energy levels of the polymers, respectively. The energy levels of new polymers were compared with some related isoindigo based polymers with different BDT units (Fig. 2). The syn-PBDFID showed lower HOMO level than anti-PBDFID. The anti-PBDFID showed slightly lower HOMO energy than thienyl substituted polymer PBDTTID. Both syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID showed significantly lower HOMO energy than alkoxy substituted polymer PBDTID.30 The utilization of a less conjugated structure such as syn-BDF and elimination of electron donating groups on the central phenyl ring resulted in the low HOMO energy of syn-PBDFID.

5. Photovoltaic properties
Bulk hetero-junction (BHJ) PSC devices with polymer syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID as electron donors and PC71BM as electron acceptor were fabricated. The device structure was ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM/LiF/Al. The weight ratio of polymer to PC71BM in active layer was 1:2. The devices were optimized with different processing solvents (Table 2). Chlorobenzene was found to be the best solvent for processing both syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID. The optimized device based on syn-PBDFID had a thickness of 60 nm. The illuminated current–voltage curves of the devices based on syn-PBDFID/PC71BM are displayed in Fig. 3. The device gave a short circuit current (Jsc) of 2.89 mA cm−2, a fill factor (FF) of 0.59, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.85 V and resulted in a PCE of 1.44%. The illuminated current–voltage curves for the devices based on anti-PBDFID/PC71BM are displayed in Fig. 4. The optimized device based on anti-PBDFID/PC71BM had a thickness of 65 nm. The device gave a Jsc value of 1.74 mA cm−2, a FF value of 0.48, a Voc value of 0.75 V and resulted in a PCE of 0.65%. The effect of processing additive on the device performance was also investigated. The results are listed in Table 2. For syn-PBDFID, the addition of 1,8-diiodoctane (DIO, 1.0% by volume) increased the Jsc of corresponding devices slightly (from 2.89 mA cm−2 to 3.02 mA cm−2), decreased the FF (from 0.59 to 0.51), maintained the Voc value of 0.85 V and resulted in a slightly lower PCE 1.32% (Fig. 3). For anti-PBDFID, the addition of DIO (1.0% by volume) increased the Jsc of corresponding devices from 1.74 mA cm−2 to 2.80 mA cm−2, decreased the FF from 0.48 to 0.38, decreased the Voc value from 0.75 V to 0.61 V and resulted in a PCE value of 0.65% (Fig. 4). The non-ideal characteristic J-V curves might be attributed to non-optimized morphology or interface barriers. The external quantum efficiency (EQE) curves for the devices based on syn-PBDFID and anti-PBDFID processed with additive are displayed in Fig. 5. The syn-PBDFID based device showed higher EQE values than the anti-PBDFID based device in the region of 350 to 615 nm. This may result from more efficient light absorption of syn-PBDFID in the region and better morphology of syn-PBDFID/PC71BM active layer. The anti-PBDFID based devices achieved better EQE values than the syn-PBDFID based device in the region of 615 to 750 nm. This resulted from more efficient light absorption of anti-PBDFID based active layer in the region.

6. Morphology
The morphology plays an important role in the device performances. Proper morphology is necessary not only for exciton dissociation but also for charge transport to respective contacts.35 Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to investigate the morphology of polymer/PC71BM active layer. Topography and phase images were taken from the film of polymer/PC71BM blends cast from chlorobenzene (CB) with or without DIO as processing additive (Fig. 6). Both syn- and anti-PBDFID/PC71BM blends processed from CB without DIO displayed large phase separations, which led to poor exciton dissociation efficiency and finally low Jsc. Many different solution systems were used for fabricating the active layer of anti-PBDFID/PC71BM. However, appropriate morphology was never achieved. If the morphology had improved, the Jsc would have been increased. Moreover, the anti-PBDFID/PC71BM blend showed higher surface roughness and much larger average domain size than syn-PBDFID/PC71BM blend. These results suggested that the low performances of anti-PBDFID based devices were likely due to the poor morphology of anti-PBDFID/PC71BM blends. The anti-PBDFID had much lower solubility than the syn-PBDFID. The precondition for achieving optimized morphology is the good miscibility of two materials. The inherent low solubility of anti-PBDFID may result in incompatibility between polymer and the PC71BM acceptor. The addition of DIO (1% by volume) reduced the domain size and slightly improved surface roughness for both polymer blends. As a result, the Jsc of devices fabricated with DIO as processing additives were slightly increased due to the more efficient charge generation.

Experimental
1. Instrumentation
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra were recorded on a Mercury plus 400 MHz machine. Elemental analyses were performed on an Elementar vario EL III elemental analysis instrument. Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements were performed on a Shimadzu LC-20A GPC coupled with differential refractive index detector using tetrahydrofuran as eluent with polystyrenes as standards. Thermogravimetric analyses (TGA) were conducted with a TA instrument Q5000IR at a heating rate of 20 °C min−1 under nitrogen gas flow. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis was performed on a Perkin Elmer instrument Pyris 1 in nitrogen atmosphere. All the samples (about 10.0 mg in weight) were first heated up to 300 °C and held for 2 min to remove thermal history, followed by the cooling at rate of 20 °C min−1 to 20 °C and then heating at rate of 20 °C min−1 to 300 °C. UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded on a Perkin Elmer model lambda 20 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Electrochemical measurements were conducted on a CS-150 electrochemical analyzer under nitrogen in a deoxygenated anhydrous acetonitrile solution of tetra-n-butylammonium hexafluorophosphate (0.1 M). A platinum disc electrode was used as a working electrode, a platinum-wire was used as an auxiliary electrode, and an Ag/Ag+ electrode was used as a reference electrode. Thin film of polymer was coated on the surface of platinum disc electrode and ferrocene was chosen as a reference.
2. Device fabrication and characterization
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) with the device structures of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer:PC71BM (1:2, w/w)/LiF/Al were fabricated as follows: a ca. 40 nm thick PEDOT:PSS (Baytron P AI 4083) was spin-coated from an aqueous solution onto the pre-cleaned ITO substrates and was dried at 120 °C for 30 min in air. Then the substrates were transferred into a nitrogen filled glove box. The mixture of polymer and PC71BM in a chosen solvent with or without DIO was spin-coated on top of the PEDOT/PSS layer. The samples were transferred into an evaporator. LiF (1 nm) and Al (100 nm) layers were thermally deposited under a vacuum of 10−6 Torr with area of 0.12 cm2. The devices were encapsulated in the glove box and measured in the air. Current–voltage characteristics were measured using a computer controlled Keithley 236 source meter. The photocurrents were measured under AM 1.5G illumination at 100 mW cm−2 from a solar simulator (Oriel, 91160A-1000). The EQEs were measured at a chopping frequency of 280 Hz with a lock-in amplifier (Stanford, SR830) during illumination with the monochromatic light from a xenon lamp. The AFM measurements were performed on SPA300HV instrument with an SPI3800 controller (Seiko Instruments).

Tetrahydrofuran and toluene were freshly distilled over sodium wire under nitrogen prior to use. Other materials were used without further purification.

Conclusions
In summary, new donor–acceptor conjugated polymers based on isoindigo as acceptors and syn- or anti-BDF as donors were synthesized. The syn- and anti-BDF based polymers showed different optical, electrochemical and photovoltaic properties. The anti-PBDFID displayed lower optical bandgap and higher HOMO energy level than syn-PBDFID. The syn-PBDFID had better solubility than anti-PBDFID. The low solubility of anti-PBDFID may cause incompatibility between polymer and PC71BM, and thus result in large-scale phase separation. This is a plausible explanation for low device performances of anti-PBDFID based solar cells. The energy levels of two new polymers were compared with some related benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophenes (BDTs) based polymers. The results suggest that the utilization of less conjugated repeating units such as syn-BDF and the elimination of electron donating groups on the central phenyl ring of BDF can realize polymer with low HOMO energy level. The low HOMO energy level of syn-PBDFID enabled high open circuit voltages in PSC devices. We may conclude that these results will provide useful information for the rational design and synthesis of polymers for PSC applications in the future.
