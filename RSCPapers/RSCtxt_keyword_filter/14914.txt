    , Accepted 29th May 2020First published on 29th May 2020AbstractA double-layer heterostructured photoanode for dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) was designed using YbF3-Ho@TiO2 core–shell sub-microcrystal sphere compounds. This heterostructured photoanode possessed efficient light scattering effects due to the sub-microcrystal sphere morphology and additional near infrared light harvesting via the upconversion function of YbF3-Ho@TiO2. More importantly, this heterostructured photoanode could facilitate the charge separation, suppress the recombination process of the injected electrons with I3− at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface and prolong the lifetime of electrons. Therefore, DSSCs based on the photoanode with a double-layer heterostructure showed a higher short-circuit photocurrent density of 17.06 mA cm−2 and an overall conversion efficiency of 7.73%, which indicated a 17% enhancement in the photocurrent and 21% improvement in the energy conversion efficiency compared with the reference TiO2 DSSCs (14.56 mA cm−2, 6.39%).
1. Introduction
Since the rapid deterioration in fossil fuels and global warming, significant attention is being given to renewable energy exploitation and utilization, e.g. solar cells. Owing to their novel concept of photosynthesis, low production costs and relatively high conversion efficiency, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) have turned into one of the most promising devices in renewable energy research field.1–4 Although, DSSCs have been considered as potential candidates to replace silicon solar cells, their energy conversion efficiency is still poor compared to the first and second generation photovoltaic technologies. Thus, further improving the performance of DSSCs is still one urgent focus of current researches. One of the main factors limiting the improvement of DSSCs is the mismatch existing between the absorption spectrum of photosensitizers and the solar irradiation spectrum. Therefore, the design and fabrication of highly-efficient and multi-functional photoanodes are desired to further improve the performance of DSSCs. There are several effective ways to enhance the capability of light harvesting: getting a large surface area,5,6 introducing a scattering layer on top of a mesoporous TiO2 layer7–9 and broadening the light absorption region (e.g. super panchromatic sensitizers,10–12 quantum dots,13,14 co-sensitizers2,15–17 and upconversion materials18–26).
Upconversion materials are potential spectrum modifiers, transforming longer wavelength photons (>900 nm) into shorter wavelength photons (<750 nm), which can be reutilized by photosensitizers to produce more electrons. Upconversion materials have been considered as one of the promising strategies to increase the near-infrared light harvesting of DSSCs. For example, Wu et al. prepared Y0.78Yb0.20Er0.02F3-doped TiO2 photoanodes and improved the photovoltaic performance of DSSCs by enhancing the light-harvesting and photocurrent.21 Core–double shell-structured β-NaYF4:Er3+, Yb3+@SiO2@TiO2 upconversion submicroparticles were applied in devices as scattering and upconverting layers to further optimize the performance of DSSCs.24 Wu et al. designed rare-earth ion-doped TiO2 hollow shells and improved the overall efficiency of DSSCs.25 To improve the photocurrent of DSSCs by upconversion, Chang et al. designed TiO2/β-NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ nano-heterostructures and prepared them on a TiO2 photoanode; by taking the advantage of the shared-interface between upconversion nanoparticles and TiO2, the overall conversion efficiency was improved by 17%.22
Heterostructured materials composed of two or more nanocomponents are a class of materials with great potential. The special interactions between these components endow this structural system with numerous advantages. In addition to endowing the material with multiple functional properties, heterostructures may also improve the existing properties or bring some new characteristics in terms of chemical or electrochemical.27–32 In this study, we have synthesized YbF3-Ho@TiO2 core–shell sub-microcrystal sphere compounds first and constructed them into double-layer heterostructured photoanodes (TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2) for DSSCs. The idea involved is to use the light-scattering and upconversion functions of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 sub-microcrystal sphere compounds and combine them with the merits of a multi-component heterostructure design. Due to the efficient charge separation, reduced charge recombination process between injected electrons and redox I3−/I−, enhanced light harvesting from light scattering and upconverting functions, the dye-sensitized solar cells with TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 heterostructured photoanode exhibited better photovoltaic conversion efficiency.
2. Experimental section
2.1 Preparation of YbF3-Ho
The YbF3-Ho nanocomposite was prepared via a hydrothermal method using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) as a size-controlled capping agent. In the preparation process, 1.04 g NH4HF2 was dissolved in 15 mL deionized water. In another solution that contained 5 mL 1.04 g Yb(NO3)3·6H2O, 0.015 g Ho(NO3)3·5H2O and 10 mL of 0.4 g CTAB, the as-prepared NH4HF2 solution was added into the complex of CTAB and rare-earth solution dropwise while stirring vigorously. HNO3 was used to adjust the pH to 1 and the adjusted solution was kept stirred for 1 h, transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave and maintained at 180 °C for 12 h. The obtained white precipitates were collected via centrifugation and washed with deionized water and ethanol. After drying, YbF3-Ho were heated to 500 °C (1 °C min−1) and kept for 2 h.
2.2 Synthesis of YbF3-Ho @TiO2
As-prepared YbF3-Ho (0.1 g) was dispersed in isopropanol (30 mL), followed by the addition of 60 μL diethylenetriamine (DETA). After stirring for 15 min, 1 mL titanium isopropylate (98%) was dropped into the solution slowly. Then, the solution was stirred for 1 h, transferred into a 50 mL Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave, heated to 200 °C and kept for 3 h. The obtained product was collected via centrifugation and washed by deionized water and ethanol. Finally, the white powder was sintered at 500 °C (1 °C min−1) for 2 h.
2.3 Synthesis of YbF3@TiO2
For comparison, YbF3@TiO2 sub-microcrystal spheres without Ho3+ ions were also synthesized according to the above-mentioned procedures.
2.4 Preparation of photoanode
(1) 0.34 g YbF3-Ho@TiO2 or TiO2 (Degussa P25 TiO2 as the reference) was dispersed in a mixture containing 1 g absolute ethanol, 1.57 g α-terpineol, and 0.09 g ethyl cellulose and kept stirring for 48 h to form the photoanode film paste.
(2) A photoanode film was fabricated on the FTO conductive glass using the screen printing method, with the same thickness and area (16 μm, 0.16 cm2) and sintered at 500 °C for 30 min. We used N719 dye (0.3 mM, Solaronix SA, Switzerland) as a photosensitizer to sensitize the photoanodes at room temperature for 24 h.
(3) YbF3-Ho@TiO2 was assembled into a double-layer heterostructured photoanode (TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2): the YbF3-Ho@TiO2 top-layer (4 μm in thickness) was printed on top of the TiO2 bottom-layer (12 μm in thickness).
2.5 Characterization techniques
The morphology images were captured on a scanning electron microscope (SEM, Rili SU 8000HSD). High resolution transmission electron microscopy images were recorded using a transmission electron microscope (TEM, Fei Tecnia G20, USA). The crystalline phase was examined via X-ray powder diffraction (XRD, Shimadzu XRD-6000X). The UV-visible and reflectance spectra were recorded using a UV-2250 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). The FTIR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100. The photoluminescence property was investigated using a fluorescence spectrometer (PL, Edinburgh FLS 920). Transient-state photovoltage (TPV) measurement was carried out in devices described in ref. 33. The photovoltaic properties were measured by employing an AAA Class 150 W solar simulator (SAN-EI ELECTRIC, XES-40S2-CE, Japan) and electrochemical workstation (CHI660D, China).
3. Results and discussion
3.1 Morphology and structure of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 sub-microcrystal spheres
The SEM images of the YbF3-Ho core and YbF3-Ho@TiO2 core–shell sub-microcrystal spheres are presented in Fig. 1(A) and (B), respectively. It can be seen that the uniform and monodispersed YbF3-Ho core with the truncated octahedral shape has a particle size of ca. 200 nm. After coating with TiO2, the core–shell YbF3-Ho@TiO2 has a spherical shape and the average size is ca. 300 nm. The core–shell structure was confirmed via a high-resolution TEM image. It is evident from the TEM image in Fig. 1(C) that the TiO2 layer with the thickness of ca. 50 nm wraps up YbF3-Ho to form a core–shell structure. Fig. 1(D) gives fine-resolved lattice fringes of the outer shell nanoparticles marked in Fig. 1(C). The interplanar spacing between the adjacent lattice planes is ca. 3.50 Å, corresponding to the d spacing of the (101) facet in anatase TiO2. As shown in Fig. 1(E), the electron diffraction pattern indicates that the YbF3-Ho core is single crystal in nature. The energy dispersive analysis (Fig. 1(F)) of the selected area of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 further confirms its elemental composition. The Ti, O, Ho, Yb and F elements can be easily detected, indicating that the core–shell structured YbF3-Ho@TiO2 was successfully prepared. From the XRD pattern in Fig. 1(G), the YbF3-Ho@TiO2 is found to be well-crystallized. The main diffraction peaks are indexed to the YbF3 standard pattern (PDF: 49-1805) and the anatase TiO2 (PDF: 84-1285), which confirmed the coexistence of the core and shell.

3.2 Upconversion fluorescence property of YbF3-Ho@TiO2
Upconversion emission spectra of YbF3-Ho and YbF3-Ho@TiO2 are shown in Fig. 2(A). All the samples were measured and compared under a 980 nm laser with the same excitation power intensity. Three emission peaks are observed at 545 nm, 644 nm and 754 nm, corresponding to the emissions from (5S2, 5F4) to 5I8, 5F5 to 5I8 and (5S2, 5F4) to 5I7, respectively. Moreover, the strongest emission peak at 545 nm matches the strong absorption areas of the N719 dye (from 350 nm to 700 nm) (see Fig. S1, ESI†). In addition, the upconversion emission of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 becomes stronger and brighter after coating with TiO2. The core–shell structure is able to separate the nanomaterials from the surrounding environment and weaken the surface effect of the nanoparticles, which is one of the most effective ways to enhance the upconversion luminescence of rare-earth ion-doped nanomaterials.20,34–36Fig. 2(B) is the FT-IR spectra of YbF3-Ho and YbF3-Ho@TiO2. The peak between 400–700 cm−1 belongs to the Ti–O stretching vibration of the TiO2 shell. The broad peak at 3000–3500 cm−1 and the peak at 1600 cm−1 are caused by the vibrations of hydroxyl groups. The surface hydroxyl groups have higher vibration frequency, that is, higher phonon energy (∼3400 cm−1), which can increase the probability of nonradiative transition between energy levels and thus reduce the upconversion efficiency. After coating with TiO2, the number of hydroxyl groups adsorbed on the surface of YbF3-Ho nanomaterials decreased that weakened the multi-phonon relaxation between rare-earth ion levels and enhanced the intensity of upconversion fluorescence.

Combined with the literature analysis, we summarized the mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement of YbF3-Ho@TiO2, as shown in Scheme 1. Rare = earth doped nanomaterials have larger specific surface area compared with bulk materials, which makes the surface of nanomaterials have a large number of defects. These surface defects will bring serious surface quenching to the materials themselves and weaken the upconversion luminescence of rare-earth ions. Moreover, the large surface area leads to a large number of doped rare-earth ions inlaid on the surface of nanoparticles, and the severe surface fluorescence quenching makes the upconversion luminescence literally originate from the rare-earth ions doped inside of the materials, while the rare-earth ions embedded in the nanoparticle surfaces are not likely to emit fluorescence.19,20,37 After coating with TiO2, the core–shell structure reduced the surface effects, improved the degenerated crystalline fields between the core–shell interfaces, which turned the rare-earth ions existing amongst the core–shell interfaces into newly isolated luminescence centers, thus enhancing the upconversion photoluminescence of YbF3-Ho@TiO2.20,34 In addition, the upconversion enhancement was also associated with the structure and thickness of the TiO2 shell.20,35,38 It should be noticed that in this YbF3-Ho@TiO2 core–shell structure the TiO2 shell layer consists of numerous nanoparticles interconnected together but not in a dense way. Nevertheless, in the coating process, if the amount of titanium isopropylate was little (0.5 mL), the shell could not cover the whole YbF3-Ho well, thus the upconversion emission was not strengthened much. If the amount of titanium isopropylate was too much (2 mL), the formed TiO2 shell layer would be dense and thicker. The density of incoming NIR light would be seriously faded, consequently weakening the upconversion emission intensities. Fig. S2 (ESI†) shows the upconversion emission spectra of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 with different amounts of titanium isopropylate (from 0.5 mL to 2 mL) in the synthesis process, and the inset are their corresponding SEM images. It was confirmed that the upconversion enhancement was associated with the structure and thickness of the TiO2 shell.
 Scheme 1  Mechanism of the fluorescence enhancement of the YbF3-Ho@TiO2 core–shell heterostructure. 
To investigate the luminescence-mediated energy transfer (LET) between YbF3-Ho@TiO2 and the N719 dye, we compared the upconversion fluorescence spectra difference of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 with increasing concentration of the N719 dye under 980 nm excitation. In Fig. 3, the upconverted fluorescence of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 in absolute EtOH shows three characteristic Ho3+ emission bands. As the concentration of the N719 dye increases from 0.1 mM to 0.4 mM, the upconversion fluorescence intensity of emission peaks decreased, particularly for the green emission peak, indicating that the energy transfer from YbF3-Ho@TiO2 to the N719 dye happened. Due to the absorbance difference of the N719 dye in the three emission regions, the green emission peak attenuated significantly, while the emission peaks at 644 nm and 750 nm did not attenuate greatly. Alternatively, the green emission peaks are more crucial and effective for improving the energy transfer efficiency.
 Fig. 3  Upconversion emission spectra of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 with the increasing concentration of the N719 dye. 
The transition intensities of (5S2, 5F4) → 5I8, 5F5 → 5I8 and (5S2, 5F4) → 5I7 are recorded as a function of the 980 nm excitation power and the log–log plots in Fig. S3 (ESI†). All the slopes are about 2, indicating that the two-photon emission process happened.37,39,40 The luminescence-mediated energy transfer (LET) process between YbF3-Ho@TiO2 and the N719 dye is shown in Scheme 2. At the near-infrared light excitation, the Yb3+ ion is excited from the ground state 2F7/2 to the excited state 2F5/2, transferring its energy to the Ho3+ ion populated at the ground state 5I8 and thus exciting it to the inter mediate excited state 5I6. Following the subsequent energy transfer process or excited state absorption, the Ho3+ ion is further excited to the 5S2 and 5F4 states. The nonradiative decay of Ho3+ from the 5S2 and 5F4 excited states to the 5I8 and 5I7 states are responsible for the 545 nm and 754 nm emissions, respectively. The 5S2 and 5F4 states subsequently decay to the 5I8 state, giving rise to the red emission. As a result, the green and red LET processes can efficiently excite the N719 dye, injecting electrons from the excited N719 dye to the photoanode.

3.3 Photogenerated charge transfer properties of photoanode films
We assembled YbF3-Ho@TiO2 into a double-layer heterostructured photoanode (TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2): the YbF3-Ho@TiO2 top-layer (4 μm in thickness) was printed on top of the TiO2 (Degussa P25 TiO2 nanoparticle) bottom-layer (12 μm in thickness), keeping the same thickness with the reference photoanode film. Its cross-section SEM image is shown in Fig. S4 (ESI†), and the corresponding element mapping images are shown in Fig. S5 (ESI†). Five elements (Ti, O, Yb, Ho, and F) are detected, and these elements of Yb, Ho and F are uniformly distributed in the top-layer, confirming the double-layer heterostructured photoanode film.
We used the transient surface photovoltage technique to investigate the photoinduced charge transfer process of the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 heterostructured photoanode film. It can give a full comprehensive understanding of the generation, the separation and recombination of photoinduced charge carriers.30,41 For comparison, the YbF3-Ho@TiO2 photoanode film was tested too. A positive TPV response indicates that both electrons and holes diffuse from surface to bottom, but the photoexcited electrons diffuse faster than the holes.42 Comparing the TPV response of TiO2 and YbF3-Ho@TiO2 films (in Fig. 4), the separation of photogenerated charges is more pronounced in the TiO2 film but the retardation of the TPV maximum point of the YbF3-Ho@TiO2 film occurs at a longer time, which suggests that the recombination process of electrons and holes is delayed.33,42,43 After it was constructed into the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 heterostructured film, a very interesting fact has come to our notice that the TPV response of TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 is stronger than that of TiO2, which means that the separation of charge carriers is much more efficient. The TPV maximum point of TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 is at longer times (5.4 × 10−5 s) than that of TiO2 (1.2 × 10−6 s), indicating that the charge recombination process was hindered. Therefore, the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 heterostructure can facilitate the charge separation and retard the charge recombination process, which is good for improving the electron collection efficiency of DSSCs.

3.4 Photovoltaic performances of DSSCs
In order to confirm the upconversion function of TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 in DSSCs, we also designed a TiO2/YbF3@TiO2 double-layer heterostructured photoanode with its fabrication procedure being the same with the earlier description. The YbF3@TiO2 SEM images are shown in Fig. S6 (ESI†), and the diffused reflectance spectra of TiO2, TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 and TiO2/YbF3@TiO2 photoanode films are shown in Fig. S7 (ESI†). Higher reflectance ability than that of the TiO2 film over the entire region highlights the superior light scattering capability of YbF3-Ho@TiO2. However, incorporating these sub-microcrystal particles to the photoanode film will reduce its surface area and lead to the decrease in the dye-loading capacity (see Table 1), which can be proved through the decreased absorbance of desorbed dye solutions (see Fig. S8, ESI†). A proposed schematic of the double-layer heterostructured photoanode with core–shell YbF3-Ho@TiO2 sub-microcrystal spheres is shown in Scheme 3.

 Scheme 3  Schematic of the double-layer heterostructured DSSC photoanode with core–shell YbF3-Ho@TiO2 sub-microcrystal spheres. 

Fig. 5 shows the I–V curves of DSSCs with different photoanodes, and the detailed performance parameters are summarized in Table 1. As expected, DSSC with the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 photoanode exhibits a better photovoltaic performance. Comparing it with the reference TiO2 cell, the photocurrent (Jsc) is increased from 14.56 mA cm−2 to 17.06 mA cm−2, the photovoltage (Voc) is enhanced from 0.72 V to 0.75 V, and the overall conversion efficiency is improved from 6.39% to 7.73%, indicating 17% and 21% improvement in Jsc and η, respectively. While comparing the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 cell to the TiO2/YbF3@TiO2 cell, the overall energy conversion efficiency is improved by 2.5%, which is mainly due to the improved Jsc. It can be seen from Table 1 that Jsc is improved from 16.69 mA cm−2 to 17.06 mA cm−2, which is a 2.2% improvement. Due to the fact that YbF3-Ho@TiO2 and YbF3@TiO2 have similar morphology, their particle size, diffused reflectance, and photoanode film thickness are also the same. We can conclude that this 2.2% improvement is the result of the upconversion function of YbF3-Ho@TiO2. The photocurrent–voltage curve of the DSSC coupled with TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 photoanode under near-infrared light is demonstrated with 980 nm laser illumination (300 mW) and is shown in Fig. S9 (ESI†). Jsc is about 0.032 mA and Voc is about 0.315 V, which unequivocally confirm the near-infrared response for the device. From all the above-mentioned results, YbF3-Ho@TiO2 core–shell sub-microcrystal spheres can act like scattering centers that increase the light travel path in the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 photoanode and upconvert the near-infrared light into visible light, which can be absorbed by the N719 dye, thus producing more photoinduced electrons. These results increased light harvesting and yielded high Jsc and η.
 Fig. 5  Photocurrent–voltage curves of the DSSCs with different photoanodes under AM 1.5G. 
We measured the electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) of DSSCs with TiO2 and TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 photoanodes to better understand the transfer of interface electrons and the kinetic recombination process in DSSCs. Through the Nyquist plots, we can find three semicircles: the first semicircle from the high frequency range corresponds to the electron transport at the counter photoanode/electrolyte interface. The second semicircle represents the electron transport at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface and the third semicircle reflects the iodide species diffusion in the electrolyte. Under illumination, the radius of the second semicircle represents the transfer resistance of electrons at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface. From Fig. 6(A), we can see that the transfer resistance of DSSC with the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 photoanode is smaller than that with the TiO2 photoanode. The reduced transfer resistance is beneficial to the rapid transfer of electrons and helps to improve Voc and η. However, in dark with −0.8 V bias, there are no electrons injected from the photo-sensitizer into TiO2, and the electrons will be transported directly via the interconnected TiO2 network, and then react with the redox electrolyte I3−.44 Therefore, the transfer resistance at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface is related with the recombination process. In Fig. 6(B), it is obvious to see that the second semicircle radius of DSSC with the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 photoanode is larger than that with the TiO2 photoanode, which indicates the electron transfer resistance from the photoanode film to the I3− ions in the electrolyte is increased. This back transfer of electrons is the mechanism of the recombination process, and this increased resistance means that the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 cell is good at retarding the recombination process and thus the loss of electrons at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface is reduced, which is better for electron injection and causes higher Voc and Jsc. Moreover, the increased resistance at the interface indicates that the dark current caused by recombination decreases, which is consistent with the dark current results shown in Fig. S10 (ESI†).
 Fig. 6  Nyquist plots of electrochemical impedance spectra (A) under illumination, (B) in dark, (C) open-circuit voltage decay curves and (D) electron survival lifetime versus voltage curves of DSSCs with different photoanodes. 
The interfacial recombination process of photoinjected electrons with the redox species in DSSCs can be understood through the open-circuit voltage decay (OCVD) measurement, which can provide more quantitative information about the electron recombination velocity.45,46 The OCVD decay curves of DSSCs derived from the two different photoanodes are shown in Fig. 6(C). It can be seen that the OCVD response of the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 cell is much slower than that of the TiO2 cell. Since the decayed Voc represents the decreased electron concentration, which is the main result of charge recombination, we can conclude that the TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 cell has lower electron recombination rate than the TiO2 cell does.
According to the OCVD results, the electron survival lifetime (τn) can be calculated using eqn (1) (1)where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and e is the electron charge.

Fig. 6(D) shows the electron survival lifetime versus voltage curves of the DSSCs derived from the above OCVD results. As can be clearly seen, the Voc values of DSSC with TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 decays slower than that of TiO2, indicating that its electron survival lifetime is longer. Therefore, employing this double-layer heterostructured TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 photoanode enabled to lessen the photoelectron recombination rate and further prolong the lifetime of photoelectrons in DSSCs.
4. Conclusions
In brief, we have synthesized YbF3-Ho@TiO2 core–shell sub-microcrystal sphere compounds and constructed them into double-layer heterostructured photoanodes for DSSCs. This core–shell YbF3-Ho@TiO2 compound provides efficient light scattering due to its sub-microcrystal sphere morphology and additional near infrared light harvesting through upconversion function. More importantly, this TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 heterostructured photoanode can facilitate the charge separation, suppress the recombination process of injected electrons with I3− in an electrolyte at the photoanode/dye/electrolyte interface and prolong the lifetime of electrons. As a result, DSSCs with the heterostructured photoanode of YbF3-Ho@TiO2 core–shell sub-microcrystal sphere compounds exhibited a 17% improvement in the photocurrent and 21% enhancement in the energy conversion efficiency. We believe this TiO2/YbF3-Ho@TiO2 heterostructured photoanode combined with other improvements in upconversion efficiency, structure design optimization and new sensitizers (e.g. quantum dots and super panchromatic sensitizers) will soon yield DSSCs with better efficiency.
