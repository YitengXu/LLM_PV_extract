1 Introduction
Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as one of the promising alternatives to conventional silicon solar cells have attracted intensive attention for their low cost and excellent photoelectrical conversion efficiency.1,2 Benefiting from the continuing optimization of materials and fabrication procedure, a conversion efficiency of more than 12% has been recently obtained.3 Compared with flat counterparts using transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass as the substrate material, flexible solar cells possessing the advantages of being lightweight, portable and economically cheap, have attracted significant academic interest and industrial attention.4–8 Polymer substrates, such as fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated PET, PEN and polyester, are widely used as the substrate for flexible DSSC fabrications.9–13 However, the low temperature tolerance of those flexible plastic substrates makes the working electrode generally sinterable only below 200 °C and results in a poor crystallization, interparticle connection and photovoltaic performance. Another way to fabricate low cost, lightweight and flexible DSSCs is to replace the glass substrate with metal materials. Compared with the polymer-based substrate, metal materials could endure high temperature, so the research on solar cells using flexible metal sheets and metal meshes as the substrates has been reported very extensively. Ti metal sheet as the substrate has been employed for the fabrication of flexible DSSCs.14 Relative to metal foils, weaved metal wire (WMW) can provide large substrate surface area for loading light-harvesting components and simultaneously possess high flexibility transparency.15–23 Moreover, using flexible fiber-woven metal wire as substrates, such weave-like solar cells can be fabricated into three-dimensional modules with diverse shapes suitable for applying them in everyday life and industry.18–21
Pioneer works have been reported for DSSC fabrication through spray coating TiO2 nanoparticles on the WMW, which usually attain low conversion efficiency due to the poor interconnection between the TiO2 particles and the WMW substrate.15 Therefore, the challenge of fabrication of the WMW-based flexible solar cells with desirable performances lies in successful construction of the well-defined semiconductor oxide onto cylindrical metal microwires. Recently, Zn2SnO4 nanowire arrays and ZnO nanowire arrays with a dendritic structure were vertically built onto WMW toward fabrication of large-area, flexible DSSCs, which show the WMW-based DSSCs' great prospects.22,23 Nevertheless, such DSSCs still suffer from lower power conversion efficiencies (η) compared to nanoparticle-based ones, mainly due to the lower specific surface areas of the NW arrays. Presently, one main strategy to improve the efficiency of a ZnO-based DSSCs is to develop ZnO photoelectrodes with new architectures. The rationale for the use of different structures of ZnO lies in the fact that the morphological variations bring about considerable changes in the photoelectrochemical properties of the respective DSSCs.13,24 For example, a porous structured ZnO aggregate of nanocrystallites was proved to be helpful to retain their high surface area and double the η of ZnO nanocrystallite DSSC.25 Moreover, a ZnO nanosheet electrode, which also exhibits higher steady-state photocurrent than the ZnO nanoparticle electrode, is attractive.26–28
In this work, porous zinc oxide (ZnO) nanosheet (NS) arrays constructed by connected nanocrystallites were built on the WMW toward the fabrication of flexible DSSCs. The growth process of the porous ZnO-NS arrays on WMW was schematically illustrated in Fig. 1. A 10–15 nm thick film of ZnO quantum dots was firstly deposited onto WMW by dip coating and heat treatment at 350 °C for 10 minutes (Fig. 1 S1). Secondly, layered hydroxide zinc carbonate (HZC) as ZnO precursor was directly grown on WMW using a hydrothermal method (Fig. 1 S2), and was then transformed into ZnO through annealing (Fig. 1 S3). A light-to-electricity conversion efficiency (η) of 2.70% was achieved for the DSSC with ZnO-NS as its photoanode under 100 mW cm−2 illuminations, relative to that of ZnO nanowire arrays (η = 0.71%). The far superior performance of the DSSC with ZnO-NS was essentially attributed to the specific morphology of the ZnO-NS. Firstly, the film consisting of nanosheets with nanocrystallites interconnected allows relatively direct pathways for the transportation of electrons as the nanosheets have a regular structure with the sheets being oriented to the electrode. Secondly, the nanocrystallites assembly and porous characters of the nanosheets can provide a large surface area for dye adsorption, which is in favor of enhancing the light absorption and the light propagation. In addition, the nanopores embedded in the nanosheet can act as “branch lines” for more efficient electrolyte diffusion into the interstice of the densely packing nanosheets in the array. A further improvement in the efficiency (η = 3.09%) of the DSSC with ZnO-NS was achieved through the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of an ultrathin TiO2 layer onto the ZnO-NS layer. The larger charge transfer resistance along with the introduction of the TiO2 shell is thought to reduce the surface recombination and thus contributes to the increase in the open circuit voltage (Voc) of the DSCs.

2 Experimental
2.1 Materials
All chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used as received without further purification. All water used in this investigation was deionized by a Nanopure filtration system to a resistivity of 18 MΩ cm. The WMW (stainless steel, Shangyu Metal Mesh Co., China) was cleaned and degreased in multiple cleaning steps. The WMW was then sonicated for 10 min successively in acetone, absolute ethanol, and deionized water. The WMW was finally blown dry in a stream of nitrogen gas.
2.2 Preparation of ZnO-NS
The ZnO-NS film was prepared by the deposition of HZC using the hydrothermal method, followed by a pyrolytic transformation of HZC into ZnO-NS. A 10–15 nm thick film of ZnO quantum dots was firstly deposited onto WMW by dip coating and heat treatment at 350 °C for 10 minutes. The seeded WMW was then immersed in a precursor solution containing 0.2 M of zinc nitrate (99.9%, Qiangsheng Chemical Co.) and 1 M of urea (99.9%, Qiangsheng Chemical Co.) at 90 °C for a specific time (6–24 h). After the hydrothermal treatment, the resultant electrode was rinsed with deionized water and dried at room temperature. Thereafter, the HZC film was converted into a ZnO-NS film by annealing at 350 °C for 30 min in air.
2.3 TiO2 ALD coating
Titanium isopropoxide (Ti(OCH(CH3)2)4) and distilled water were chosen as a precursor and an oxidant for ALD-TiO2 deposition. After connecting them to each valve, the precursor was heated at 60 °C and the oxidant was kept at 25 °C. The annealed ZnO film placed on a heater located in a vacuum chamber was heated at 220 °C under vacuum condition. One cycle of ALD is composed of (1) the precursor exposure, (2) purge the precursor remaining in the chamber, (3) the oxidant exposure, and (4) purge the residual oxidant. The ZnO film was exposed to those gaseous chemicals alternatively and after one cycle, a thin TiO2 layer was formed on the surface of the ZnO aggregates. Nitrogen gas was used as a carrier gas to deliver the precursor and oxidant effectively. After the ALD process of 20 cycles, the TiO2 coated ZnO film was reannealed at 400 °C for 60 min to achieve crystalline TiO2 and to remove residues formed during the ALD process.
2.4 Solar cell fabrication
To study the photovoltaic performance data of the ZnO-NS arrays on the WMWs, open solar cells were fabricated. As-prepared ZnO-NS arrays were rinsed thoroughly with DI water and ethanol to remove any residual reactants and then were sensitized in a solution of 0.5 mM (Bu4N)2[Ru(4,4′-(COOH)-2,2-bipyridine)2(NCS)2] (N719 dye) in dry ethanol for 1.5 h. The sensitized NS arrays were then sandwiched together and bonded with platinum counter electrodes separated by 40 μm thick porous membrane. The electrolyte solution (50 mM LiI, 1.0 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide, 30 mM I2, 0.10 M guanidinium thiocyanate and 50 mM tert-butylpyridine in a mixture of acetonitrile and valeronitrile (volume ratio, 85:15)) was introduced via capillary action into the gap formed by the two electrodes.
2.5 Characterization
The morphology of the samples was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, FEI NOVA NanoSEM230, USA) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL 3010, Japan). Compositional analysis was conducted by using an Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) along with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) was carried out to check the surface area of ZnO-NS. The XRD pattern was recorded in the 2θ range of 10–80° on a Rigaku-D/Max 2500 V/PC X-ray diffractometer using Cu k1 radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å) at 40 kV and 200 mA. The J–V measurements were carried out with a cell active area of 0.132 cm2 on a Keithley 236 source measurement unit under AM1.5 illumination (standard 100 mW cm−2) cast by an Oriel 92251A-1000 sunlight simulator calibrated by the standard reference of a Newport 91150 silicon solar cell. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) curves of the F-DSSCs were also observed at the open circuit voltage under 1 sun AM 1.5 illumination by a PAR2273 workstation (Princeton Applied Research, USA). The AC signal was 10 mV, and the frequency range was from 50 mHz to 100 kHz.
3 Results and discussion
The employed weaved metal cylinder wire is of a diameter of about 40 μm with quite smooth surface, exhibiting great flexibility (Fig. 2a and c). The color of the WMW became white after the hydrothermal treatment, indicating successful coating of ZnO precursor (Fig. 2b). The precursor was identified by XRD (Fig. 3) as predominately monoclinic hydrozincite Zn4(OH)6(CO3)·H2O, referring to the Joint Committee on Powder Diffraction standards (JCPDS, File no. 11-287). The diffraction peak appearing at a 2θ angle of around 12.8 indicates that the HZC film has a layered structure and a large inter-layer spacing.28

Fig. 4 shows SEM images of the HZC film grown on WMW substrate for different periods. The film thickness increased with the increase of growth time from 3 to 24 h. After 24 h growth, the WMW substrate is covered totally and uniformly with HZC film; the average film thickness at these stages is about 12–15 μm. In Fig. 4d it can be seen that the films have a good uniformity on the large scale without any crack gaps. The cross section view in Fig. 4e clearly indicates that the film is constructed by assembling nanosheets in a compact way and the nanosheets are vertically oriented to the WMW substrate in different angles to each other. It is apparent that all products consist of a large well-aligned sheet-like nanostructure, and in all the cases the top surface of the film is smooth and has no micropores (Fig. 4f).

(f) Top view with high magnification shows the smooth structure of the single nanosheet before calcining. The scale bars represent 50 μm. 
The seeded thin ZnO quantum dots layer, which was supposed to increase the hydrophilicity of the WMW substrate, plays an important factor for controlled growth of the HZC film. Many kinds of zinc hydroxides, including carbonates, have a hydrophobic surface. Accordingly, the nanosheets formed were upright only when a hydrophilic substrate was used.26 Fig. S1† shows the hierarchically assembled microsphere structure of the HZC film prepared without the seeded layer, which leads to poor coating on the surface of the WMW substrate.
After being annealed at 350 °C for 30 min, the HZC was transformed into hexagonal ZnO (JCPDS no. 79-0205), as evidenced by the XRD patterns (Fig. 3). The strong and narrow diffraction peaks demonstrate good crystallinity. No appearance of other diffraction peaks indicates the high phase purity. The peak corresponding to (002) is weaker than that in the JCPDS card and the peak of (100) is larger than that in the JCPDS card. This pattern, which indicates a change in the preferential orientation of the ZnO, is similar to that of the c-axis-paralled ZnO films reported by Yoshida et al.13 The FE-SEM image demonstrates that the nanosheet-based morphology was maintained after annealing (Fig. 5a). Considerable nanopores were formed on the nanosheet (Fig. 5b), which was attributed to the release of volatile gas such as H2O and CO2 during the heat treatment because of precursor decomposition. This kind of microstructure is expected to be beneficial for the electrolyte diffusion into the semiconductor film of a DSSC. Fig. 6a shows the TEM image of a single nanosheet obtained by scratching from the bulk of the ZnO-NS, which reveals clearly that the nanosheet is composed of a large amount of connected nanocrystallites with sizes of about 30–50 nm. A lot of uniform separated nanopores exist among these nanoparticles and are absolutely penetrated. The diffraction ring pattern of the selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) indicates the polycrystalline assembling nature of the nanosheet (Fig. 6b).

The representative nitrogen adsorption and desorption isotherm curve of the ZnO-NS displays a hysteresis loop and exhibits no limiting adsorption at high relative pressures (Fig. 7). The corresponding Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) pore size distribution obtained from the isotherm indicates that the ZnO-NS contains two-sized nanopores. The ∼2.55 nm pore may be attributed to the parallel assembly of the nanosheets. The second pore centered at ∼15.34 nm comprises a majority of the nanopores, probably resulting from the pore embedded in the nanosheets. The specific surface area of the ZnO-NS was measured about 37.27 m2 g−1.

The WMW-supported ZnO-NS array was utilized as photoanodes for the fabrication of flexible DSSCs, which have a typical size of 4 cm × 2.5 cm and possesses relatively good flexibility when subjected to external force (Fig. 8a). The corresponding schematic configuration of the DSSC was listed in Fig. 8b. Fig. 9 shows the I–V characteristics for the ZnO-NS array-based solar cells. For comparison, ZnO nanowire (NW) arrays with similar thickness on WMW (Fig. S2†) were also fabricated through the hydrothermal reaction described in our previous work.23 The NS-based cell exhibits higher current density (Jsc) of 7.89 mA cm−2, open circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.53, fill factor (FF) of 64.32% and conversion efficiency (η) of 2.70% than the NW-based cell. This η is far higher than that (∼0.5 to 2%) of ZnO-NWs based flexible cells.29,30 The overall efficiency is also 12.5% higher than ref. 31 (2.4%), whose photoanode was based on hierarchically structured ZnO nanocrystals. By introducing compression post-treatment or ammonia surface activation treatment, flexible cells based on porous ZnO nanoparticles commonly show a little higher efficiency (∼3.2 to 3.8%)32,33 than our cell, which was mainly subject to the lower open-circuit voltage. In DSSCs, Jsc is generally a product of the efficiencies of light harvesting, electron injection, and charge collection. It is clear that the structure of the ZnO film plays a great role in the different light-harvesting capability and charge transport and recombination in photoanodes. Fig. 10 displays the wavelength distribution of incident monochromatic photo-to-electron conversion efficiency (IPCE). The IPCE is determined by the light absorption efficiency of the dye, the quantum yield of electron injection, and the efficiency of collecting the injected electrons at the conducting glass substrate, which is also strongly affected by the morphology and surface area of the photoelectrode.34–37 The IPCE of the ZnO-NS cell was found higher than those of the ZnO-NW cells over the whole spectral range of 380–700 nm, which suggested that the high-energy conversion efficiency results predominantly from sufficient dye-loading by special porous structure of ZnO-NS composed of a large amount of connected nanocrystallites along with enlarged internal surface area within the photoelectrode. As measured from dye-desorption experiments, the concentration of dye in the ZnO-NS electrode was found to be 3.42 × 10−7 mol cm−2, which is almost 35% higher than the obtained value of 2.54 × 10−7 mol cm−2 for the ZnO-NW electrode (Fig. S3†). Secondly, the nanopores embedded in the nanosheet can act as “branch lines” for more efficient electrolyte diffusion into the interstice of the densely packing nanosheets in the array. In addition, the film consisting of nanosheets would also allow relatively direct pathways for the transportation of electrons, as the nanosheets have a regular structure with the sheets being oriented to the electrode. Moreover, relative to the ZnO-NW films, the ZnO-NS film possesses higher diffuse reflection capabilities in the visible and near-infrared regions, which indicated the porous nanosheets can provide light reflection and can scatter the incident light of different wave lengths in the visible range (Fig. S4†).38 These effects finally resulted in an enhancement in the light harvesting efficiency of the photoelectrode as well as an improvement in the solar cell's performance.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis (Fig. 11) was conducted to investigate appreciable difference in charge transport and recombination at the aggregate–electrolyte interface in the ZnO-NS and ZnO-NW films. They were always characterized by two main relaxation loops which have been analyzed by means of the classical equivalent electrical circuit.39–41 The high frequency loop is classically assigned to the redox reaction at the charged counter-electrode, and the middle-frequency loop is due to the injection–recombination reaction at the photoanode (Rct). The fitting values of Rct corresponding to ZnO-NS and ZnO-NW cells are 110.8 Ω and 188.9 Ω, respectively, indicating higher recombination in the ZnO-NS cells, which usually means lower Voc.2 However, as shown in Fig. 9, the Voc of the NS structure even increased a little compared to ZnO-NW. This was due to the increased electron lifetime of NS structure ZnO, though the Rct decreased. It is known that the reciprocal of the ωmax frequency is associated with the electron lifetime. Using the relation τe = 1/ωmax = 1/2πfmax,42,43 the electron lifetimes (τe) for recombination of ZnO-NS and ZnO-NW are estimated to be 87.0 ms and 44.7 ms, respectively. The longer τe for the ZnO-NS cell indicated that electrons in the conductive band of ZnO became more difficult to recombine with the redox in the electrolyte, which could explain the increased Voc when the NS structure was formed compared to NW.

A further improvement in the efficiency of the DSSC with ZnO-NS was achieved through employing a thin shell layer of semiconducting oxide TiO2 onto the ZnO films, which can effectively suppress recombination of electrons. Atomic-layer deposition (ALD), which is capable of producing very thin conformal films with controlled thickness and composition of the films at the atomic level and low growth temperature, was a good choice for shell layer growth.44 It is reported that the growth rate of TiO2 at the substrate temperature of 200–250 °C ranges from 0.03 to 0.06 nm per one cycle so the thickness of TiO2 grown by ALD for 20 cycles in this work is estimated to be 0.6–1.2 nm,45 which is so thin that scanning electron microscopy can not tell any obvious surface morphology change and the porous nature was retained (Fig. S5†). However, the EDS spectrum (Fig. S6†) of the TiO2 coated ZnO film shows a tiny peak at 458 eV, which is attributed to Ti Ka and indicates a successful deposit of TiO2 on the surface of ZnO-NS. A peak with a binding energy of 458.2 eV in the XPS spectrum (Fig. S7†), which was in good agreement with that of Ti4+ in TiO2 whose binding energy is 458.5 eV,46 was observed. The TiO2 ultrathin layer formed a complete and conformal coverage on the surface of ZnO nanocrystallites, and consequently all the dye molecules adsorbed onto the surface of the TiO2 coating during dye loading.
Solar cells with working electrodes consisting of the TiO2 coated ZnO-NS films was tested under illumination with 100 mW cm−2 intensity. While the overall PCE of 2.70% was achieved in the ZnO-NS based solar cell, the ZnO-NS DSC with ALD-TiO2 coating offered a higher η of 3.09%, which may be mainly attributed to an increased open circuit voltage from 0.53 V to 0.58 V (Fig. 9). Coating a shell layer on the surface of the core is considered to suppress recombination by forming a surface energy barrier. This effect was achieved when the shell layer would act as an energy barrier layer or a tunneling layer depending on the energy level of the shell materials or passivate recombination sites on the surface of the core. In the ZnO core–TiO2 shell system, as the both materials have a similar energy level, the TiO2 shell could not form a surface energy barrier in terms of energy level. However, due to the difference in the electron concentration, a n–n+ heterojunction formed at the ZnO–TiO2 interface associated with a built-in potential giving rise to a strong electric field between the ZnO core and TiO2 shell, which can confine the electrons in the ZnO core and eventually suppress the charge recombination.45,47 This reduced recombination led to the increase in Voc and also contributed to an increase in the FF from 0.64 to 0.69.
4 Conclusion
Porous zinc oxide nanosheet arrays constructed by connected nanocrystallites were built on WMW via hydrothermal treatment followed by calcination and used as photoanodes of flexible dye-sensitized solar cells. An overall light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of 2.70% was achieved for the DSSC under 100 mW cm−2 illumination with this unitary material and structure. A further improvement in the efficiency of the DSSC with ZnO-NS was achieved through the atomic layer deposition of an ultrathin TiO2 layer onto the ZnO-NS layer. At present, the efficiency of the ZnO-NS-based cell on WMW is still relatively lower than the FTO-based cell, but we believe it can be increased significantly by: (1) optimized further the pore distribution and assembly of the ZnO-NS; (2) coating the ZnO-NS with oxides having more negative conduction band edge than the ZnO core, which may raise Voc directly; (3) building the well-defined TiO2 semiconductor oxide directly on the WMW substrate or transforming the ZnO structure into TiO2.
