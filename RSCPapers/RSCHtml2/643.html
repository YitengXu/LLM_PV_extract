        <span class="bold">Rafael Jaramillo</span> opened discussion of the introductory lecture by David Mitzi: What is your most trusted approach to accurately measure the absorption coefficient on a new thin film material?</span>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> replied: The point about significant challenges in making and evaluating reliable absorption measurements for emerging thin-film absorber materials is a good one. In general, absorption measurements using UV-Vis spectroscopy can be influenced by film roughness and scatter, as well as a number of other prospective complications. In terms of using these measurements to extract a bandgap value, we often make use of the long wavelength cut-off in the quantum efficiency (QE) curve, since this allows us to directly extract a bandgap value on a device-relevant film. Although there are various methods for extracting the bandgap from this curve, we generally use a derivative method (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, taking the derivative of the QE with respect to wavelength or energy and selecting the peak in this function at the long wavelength cutoff). This approach of using the inflection point of the QE curve in the region of the absorption threshold is also a suggested method of bandgap extraction put forward in a recent <span class="italic">Adv. Energy Mater.</span> article that benchmarks emerging photovoltaic technologies as a function of bandgap value.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>

        <span class="bold">Charlotte Platzer Björkman</span> asked: The Zn<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Cd<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>S buffer layer had quite a minor increase in band gap energy and was not optimal in terms of conduction band alignment. Was that due to a limit in zinc addition in the deposition process?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> answered: The zinc content is not limited by the SILAR process, as previously shown by the UNSW (Xiaojing Hao) group (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, see ref. 1 and 2). We tried higher zinc content in our buffers for the CBTSSe devices. However, these buffers did not lead to higher PV performance (or even <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small>). One hypothesis is that, for higher zinc content, the doping level in the buffer may drop, which may counteract the benefit of the higher conduction band (lower electron affinity). However, these are very recent results and we will need to further examine this issue to see what factors are controlling performance in the devices employing higher zinc content buffers.</p>

        <span class="bold">Susanne Siebentritt</span> said: I don't think high dispersion bands and low effective mass are as important as you state. With high masses we get a higher density of states and a higher absorption coefficient and can live with thinner absorbers – which need less good transport, see ref. 1.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">1 T. Kirchartz and U. Rau, <span class="italic">Sustainable Energy Fuels</span>, 2018, <span class="bold">2</span>, 1550–1560, DOI: <a href="http://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=c7se00622e" target="_blank" title="Select to resolve DOI: 10.1039/c7se00622e">10.1039/c7se00622e</a>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> responded: This is a great point. The parameters that I mentioned for targeting high-performance absorbers are often coupled. So increasing the band dispersion to improve carrier mobility can reduce joint density of states at the band edge and therefore absorption coefficient. In this sense, optimizing absorber performance can often involve balancing several competing effects (which may include, for example, needing to use a thinner absorber layer to allow for better charge extraction). Nevertheless, given the coupling of minority carrier diffusion length with carrier mobility values, I would still maintain that targeting a reasonable band dispersion (and associated minority carrier mobility and diffusion length) is still an important target for new absorbers. Notably, small band dispersion can also lead to carrier localization and polaron formation, which is detrimental for PV performance.<small><sup>1</sup></small></p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Cara Hawkins</span> enquired: You emphasised in the introduction to your talk about the importance of targeting materials based on earth abundant and non-toxic elements, for example moving away from Cd in solar absorbing materials. However in the devices you have developed you include a CdS buffer layer. Do you have any suggestions for how moving forward we can remove Cd from this layer, or how we can base layers included in device architectures on more abundant and less toxic elements?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> answered: Excellent question. Optimizing device structures is much more challenging than simply focusing on the absorber, given a large number of interfaces that need to be considered in the device. The process of selecting a suitable buffer material, for example, involves not just considering band offsets and doping of the buffer relative to the absorber, but one also needs to be concerned about the chemical interaction (potential ion migration and reactivity) at the interface with the absorber. In this regard, trying to identify a buffer material that both satisfies the needs of good electronic/chemical match with the absorber, as well as being earth abundant and non-toxic, poses a significant (though also important) challenge for future research to address. The ZCS (Zn<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Cd<span class="italic"><small><sub>x</sub></small></span>S) in our research was meant to be a starting point for addressing the conduction band cliff problem in CBTSSe. This approach was selected because ZCS provides a convenient and demonstrated means to tailor the conduction band edge by varying the Zn<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>Cd ratio (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, as shown in ref. 1). By using this readily available system, we wanted to prove the importance of the conduction band offset in controlling the <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> deficit. Future work will be targeted towards trying to refine this approach and to move to more environmentally friendly materials. Buffer systems of possible interest might include, for example, zinc oxysulfide or doped zinc magnesium oxide, which might offer similar opportunity for optimizing the electron affinity of the buffer, but without the use of highly toxic cadmium.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mohit Sood</span> queried: When you increase Zn concentration in CdZnS, with the increase in conduction band you see lower doping. As a consequence the device performance does not improve. Maybe because the inversion at the junction is not that good. Can we mitigate this if we use a thinner buffer layer, or rather than using a ZnMgO i-layer, a doped ZnMgO layer instead – will that help?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> replied: If it is possible to make a quality buffer thinner, this may help in terms of reducing parasitic absorption in this layer and, additionally, a thinner layer may be less problematic in the context of a low doping density. However, there are challenges associated with thinning the buffer substantially – <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, avoidance of pinholes and shunting. So, in this sense, there are limits as to how thin a buffer can be made (we explored this in the context of CZTS devices in ref. 1). Doping of higher bandgap buffer prospects like ZnMgO could also be attractive, assuming a suitable doping scheme can be developed.</p>

        </span> asked: Some of your new target compounds contain elements which contain multiple oxidation states which are energetically easily accessible. What I remember from working on the tin containing kesterite compounds is the +2, +4 oxidation states and how one of these provided detrimental defect levels in the band gap. One of the compounds that your group is targeting is Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>PbGeS<small><sub>4</sub></small>; I believe Pb also easily forms either +2 and +4 oxidation states. Do you think the issue of multiple oxidation states will also be relevant here?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> answered: Indeed, this issue of metal oxidation state stability was one driving force behind our looking at Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>BaGeSe<small><sub>4</sub></small> (CBGSe) in relation to Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>BaSnS<small><sub>4</sub></small> (CBTS), in that we felt that CBGSe might be less susceptible to Ge<small><sup>2+</sup></small>-related defects, since Ge<small><sup>2+</sup></small> is presumably more difficult to access than Sn<small><sup>2+</sup></small> (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, in relationship to corresponding tetravalent states). Further, there was the consideration that Ge<small><sup>4+</sup></small> offers a more differentiated ionic size relative to Cu<small><sup>+</sup></small>, compared with Sn<small><sup>4+</sup></small>, and the hope was that this would provide less driving force for anti-site disorder. Sadly, despite these expectations, the deep defect properties of CBGSe seem to be worse relative to CBTS, according to our low temperature photoluminescence measurements (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, see ref. 1). So clearly more work needs to be done to understand the nature of defects in CBGSe. Regarding the Pb-based system, we have not specifically addressed the question of Pb<small><sup>2+</sup></small><span class="italic">vs.</span> Pb<small><sup>4+</sup></small> (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, using DFT analysis). Nevertheless, I believe that the 2+ state is relatively stable for Pb among metal chalcogenides. So hopefully, this would not be a significant issue for the Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>PbGeS<small><sub>4</sub></small> system. However, more detailed computational and experimental analysis would be needed to definitively address this point. I think that, overall, our experiences with CBGSe highlight a general need for better experimental approaches for understanding the chemical origins of defect states in complex chalcogenide semiconductors. Such approaches would make it easier to close the loop on corresponding computation-based analyses.</p>

        </span> queried: I very much like your question about compound simplicity <span class="italic">versus</span> complexity (few <span class="italic">versus</span> many elements). Given that the compounds you are investigating comprise four elements, which need to be deposited uniformly over meters squared, I agree that this is academically fun and interesting, but is it industrially relevant?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> responded: I believe that experiences with CIGS point to the fact that, in principle, the simpler the system the better in terms of providing for low cost and high yield fabrication approaches. So if an elemental or binary system can provide all the properties that are desired for a photovoltaic absorber, this would probably be a better path to pursue. However, there are also advantages in terms of tunability that can be provided by having more chemical complexity (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, pursuing multinary systems). For example, having multiple chemical sites within a semiconductor can allow for independently shifting the valence and conduction band edges, as well as provide a pathway for introducing band gap grading within the device. However, this tunability needs to be balanced against the increased number of pathways for defect formation (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> proliferation of possibilities for anti-sites, vacancies and interstitials) when more elements are involved in the semiconductor. This is one reason why we want to understand possible design principles for such multinary systems that can be used to control disorder (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, as mentioned in ref. 1).</p>

        <span class="bold">Rachel Woods-Robinson</span> asked: As has been discussed, many known thin film absorber materials are solid solutions off-stoichiometry rather than on-stoichiometric compounds (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, CdSe<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Te<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>, SbS<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Se<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>), which enables tunability of properties. However, most of our computational screenings first look for <span class="italic">compounds</span>, identify a compound of interest that emerges from the screening, and then move off-stoichiometry in the lab to grow alloys associated with an endpoint compound. This can induce properties shifted from those that have been predicted, and this approach may also miss materials in which the endpoint compound does not emerge from a screening but a solid solution does. Should we perhaps be inverting our searches and first targeting solid solutions with good properties? Or, for a given compound, should we be searching for a range of tolerance of properties rather than just on-stoichiometric properties?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> answered: That is an interesting question. From the point of view of a materials designer (involving perhaps a confluence of theory and experiment) it is easier to start from a simpler system and move to more complex ones. I believe that this fact really underlies the general approach of starting from the endpoints and then later considering more complex alloyed or off-stoichiometric versions. So in my talk (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00132B">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00132b</a>), one example involved starting with the endpoint compounds Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>BaSnS<small><sub>4</sub></small> and Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>BaGeSe<small><sub>4</sub></small> (even though they don't have the most appropriate bandgaps for single-junction PV), and then moving to the more complex systems – <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>BaSnS<small><sub>4−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Se<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> or Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>BaGe<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Sn<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Se<small><sub>4</sub></small>. The simpler compounds provide a good baseline to understand how the properties evolve under alloying. That being said, I certainly understand the point that one often needs to have solid-solution or off-stoichiometric materials in order to get the best photovoltaic properties. CIGS provides a good example for this, whereby mixtures of Ga and In (or S and Se) and shifting to Cu-poor stoichiometries is important for getting the best properties. So I agree that there may be limitations in the approach of focusing on better-ordered endpoint compounds as the starting point of our studies (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, maybe certain systems behave better as alloys than others and so the endpoints may not be representative of the ultimate potential of the alloys). On the other hand, I don't have an immediate good suggestion as to how to implement an efficient materials search that starts with an intentional target of solid solutions. Maybe this might be a reasonable target for machine learning approaches to try to tackle?</p>

        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> asked: I am wondering what the chemical role of NaF is? You show increased performance when bringing NaF on top of the kesterite layer as opposed to depositing it between passivation layer and kesterite layer. Does NaF therefore interact with the kesterite, which in turn interacts with the passivation layer?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> added: With regards to the better kesterite device properties when NaF is placed on top of the thin absorber during processing (rather than at the back of the absorber, on top of the passivation layer), might the improvements be related to the more efficient access of the NaF layer to the chalcogen vapor during the sulfurization part of the processing?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Also, as mentioned in some earlier papers (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, see ref. 1), NaF decomposition may be facilitated by formation of SF<small><sub>6</sub></small> (SeF<small><sub>6</sub></small>) during the sulfurization (selenization) process, whereas this process may be less efficient when the NaF is placed at the back of the absorber film. More facile decomposition of NaF may in turn provide a more rapid boost in Na content within the film during processing and therefore enable better absorber characteristics. Perhaps this factor might contribute to improved performance when the NaF is placed at the top of the absorber during processing?</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Charlotte Platzer Björkman</span> replied: Thank you for pointing this out. The question then is if we could detect differences in the F concentration through the layers, and this would be interesting to do. Regarding absorber qualities, we do not have the comparison between devices made with NaF on top of the CZTS precursor and the ALD Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> since the latter samples peeled. In the case of HfO, we do have that comparison. For several samples, partial peeling and pinholing was worse with NaF on the HfO, but in one case device performance was similar to those with NaF on top of the precursor, or even better. The NaF treatment both influences the charge transport through the passivation layer and most likely also electronic properties of the CZTS, with the first effect having the largest influence on device performance. The effect on CZTS can be difficult to determine given the normal spread in performance between devices.</p>

        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> enquired: There was mention in the presentation that aluminum oxide works better than hafnium or silicon oxides as a passivation layer when studying devices with Mo back contact. Also, the aluminum oxide in this part of the study was deposited by ALD rather than by sputtering (used for hafnium and silicon oxides). I was wondering whether the deposition process used (ALD <span class="italic">vs.</span> sputtering), and the associated impact on passivation layer morphology and continuity, might play a role in determining how well the different passivation layers work in improving the device performance?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Charlotte Platzer Björkman</span> answered: There are two different experimental series in the paper, the first with sputtered SiO, sputtered Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and ALD Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, and the second with ALD Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and ALD HfO.

There is no clear difference in the grain size or morphology in this case, also looking at the slightly thicker passivation layers (not shown). In the comparison of ALD HfO and Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> (Fig. 5 of the paper), the CZTS grains are possibly larger for Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> passivation, but the image is not clear enough to confirm this.</p>

        <span class="bold">Devendra Tiwari</span> said: This comment arises from the data presented by Professor Platzer Björkman on the effects of sodium fluoride layer deposition before and after low thickness (&lt;750 nm) CZTS absorber deposition. The thin absorbers were grown on Mo or ITO coated glass substrates with alumina, silica and hafnia protective overlayers (&lt;10 nm thickness). Upon reading further the earlier papers reported by Professors Platzer Björkman and Edoff from the Ångström Lab on related work on chalcopyrite and kesterite like compound Cu-chalcogenide absorbers (most importantly – ref. 1 and 2), and multiple reviews and studies on the role of alkali salts inclusion in such absorbers-based PV devices especially ref. 3 and 4, it is understood that different microscopic effects have been proposed to be prevalent for different alkali metals. For example, including intragrain improvement in carrier concentration and grain growth, and modulation of the intergrain barrier affecting the charge separation and transport. The observation of different effects for different alkali metal ions suggests multiple underlying mechanisms at play, for example changes in the ionic radii and electropositivity could affect the uptake of a particular alkali metal, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> whether it may substitute the sites in the crystallite or segregate at grain boundaries, and thermodynamic stability and the bonding nature of alkali metal based secondary phases, under a certain set of processing conditions. However, I am not sure whether it is due to historic or scientific reasons why prevalently fluorides of alkali metals have been employed to introduce alkali metals in the absorber especially when vacuum processing has been used and that the role of the fluoride anion has been discounted. In my view, fluoride being such a strong Lewis acid must participate in modifying the absorber films or absorber/buffer interface. Particularly in this paper (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00052K">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00052k</a>), the authors observed improvements in the device performance for both the cases when NaF treatment was included before and after the precursor deposition. Thus, in both cases it could be inferred that NaF must have been acting on the protective oxide layers. The purpose of the stable and ultrathin conformal oxide protective layers has been to minimize the excess diffusion of chalcogens or metals across the back contact and introduce non-ohmic character to the charge-transport. However, such stable oxide layers of aluminium, silicon or hafnium are insulating and thus have been tested as gate-materials in FET devices and as a consequence in current PV devices of kesterite or chalcopyrite absorbers,<small><sup>5</sup></small> thus leading to s-kink + cross-over (Fig. 4a in the paper) or mild roll-over (Fig. 4b in the paper) in the <span class="italic">J</span>–<span class="italic">V</span> curves due to blocked charge transport. As shown in the previous papers,<small><sup>5,6</sup></small> addition of NaF leads to perforation of these oxide protective layers (<span class="italic">cf.</span> Fig. 5 of ref. 5) thus allowing charge-transport. My suggestion is that mechanistically, the fluoride must play a role in the partial erosion of the oxide of the protective layer, gettering any residual oxides at grain boundaries and should be investigated. The fluoride chemistry involved here is very basic and most of the work on the thermochemistry of such reactions involving the native oxide of simple metals and alkali salts predates the advances in the optoelectronic devices. However, there is colloquial evidence and two areas which might of relevance here including the role of fluoride chemistry in the etching of silica for FET devices and corrosion of native oxides of metals under fluoride solutions. Fluoride has been known to attack oxides, for example the RCA rinses include diluted HF treatment at the end step to etch SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> on Si wafers (for example ref. 7) and similarly the fluoride content in water has been known to attack air-formed oxide on aluminium surfaces (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> alumina), for example see ref. 8, where the activity of NaCl and NaF have been compared and the latter has been found to be much more corrosive. The activity of fluoride towards such oxide has been known to be aggressive and isotropic. Various patents and studies have been reported to control the fluoride-based etching for FET devices. Similar observations of difficulty in controlling the etching of HfO<small><sub>2</sub></small><span class="italic">vs.</span> Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> with the action of a NaF overlayer was observed in ref. 5. Interestingly, in this work as well, the NaF layer deposited directly on top of the protective oxide layer resulted in worse performance compared to NaF deposited on the thin absorber precursor layer. The latter situation perhaps leads to a better control of fluoride release to the protective oxide layer, with likely transports through the grain-boundaries <span class="italic">via</span> adducts with any oxides or low coordination sites. Thus, it might be interesting as a further work to analyse the fluorine/fluoride/oxy-fluoride concentration across the device as a way of understanding the chemical mechanism of the fluoride-led oxygen/oxide etching. Of course, a reliable detection of fluorine or fluorine-species under such a low concentration with spatial resolution is difficult. However, as a suggestion use of low to medium energy ion spectroscopy could be a possibility. Fortunately, the authors have ERDA based ion-spectroscopy available to them. Lastly, the observed difference in the performance of devices with NaF and HfO<small><sub>2</sub></small><span class="italic">vs.</span> Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> could be again due to the differential fluoride ion affinity (FIA) as has been reported in gas-phase with Hf having a lower FIA than Al.<small><sup>9,10</sup></small> As a result, Fig. 5 of ref. 5 also shows less perforation for HfO<small><sub>2</sub></small> than Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> of the same 15 nm thickness upon NaF treatment. Assuming similar behaviour, the differences in the <span class="italic">J</span>–<span class="italic">V</span> curves between Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and HfO<small><sub>2</sub></small> based devices in Fig. 4c of the paper can be explained by the presence of a more intact layer of HfO<small><sub>2</sub></small> blocking the charge transport. I recently came across this article which could be directly relevant to this discussion. Particularly, Deep Reactive Ion Etching Bosch process on Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> for microelectromechanical device fabrication seems to have probed this issue in more detail. Its 2022 article, so includes in-depth and more refined surface analysis of erosion of Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> under fluoride ion plasma (ref. 11).</p>

        <span class="bold">Thomas Weiss</span> enquired: Concerning the devices with oxide layer at the back contact, do these oxide layers act as a barrier for alkali diffusion from the soda lime glass substrate? Have you ever checked the sodium content in your absorber films? Or more specifically: did you check the doping in your absorber layers with and without oxide layer at the back contact?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The reason is that Cu(In,Ga)Se<small><sub>2</sub></small>, devices prepared without Na have a very high doping, which can lead to a back contact barrier. Summing up: the low device performance and the blocking of the diode current could be a result of lacking Na(/doping).</p>

        <span class="bold">Charlotte Platzer Björkman</span> responded: We did perform GDOES depth profiles of the samples with varying thickness of ALD Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, sputtered Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and sputtered SiO on Mo and ITO. The estimated thicknesses were between 1 and 8 nm in this series. We did not see any difference in the Na concentration in the CZTS between these samples including the Mo and ITO references. The main difference in Na profiles between the samples was an accumulation of Na at the ITO/passivation layer interfaces that increased with increasing passivation layer thickness. We were expecting some blocking of Na, but reports on non-blocking barrier layers are not uncommon.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">We have previously seen that TiN adhesion layers on Mo can actually increase the Na concentration in CZTS.<small><sup>1</sup></small> In that case we identified Na accumulation in the TiN and non-uniformities in the sputtered TiN on the Mo where Na could possibly pass. We also noticed strong reduction in MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation, and this could also influence the Na supply to the CZTS from SLG since MoS<small><sub>2</sub></small> can block Na diffusion.</p>

        <span class="bold">Devendra Tiwari</span> opened discussion of the paper by Galina Gurieva: Dr Gurieva presented crystallographic analysis of the Cu<small><sub>2</sub></small>(Zn,Mn)SnSe<small><sub>4</sub></small> mixture through neutron and X-ray diffraction. Needless to say, the presented analysis is exemplarily systematic and thorough. However, inclusion of a mid-transition series element (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> non d<small><sup>1</sup></small> or d<small><sup>9</sup></small> ion) in a PV absorber raises concern, as such metal ions including Mn<small><sup><span class="italic">n</span>+</sup></small> do exhibit multiple oxidation states easily forming the basis for their use in catalysis. This in the case of a PV absorber could lead to undesired electronic states in the bandgap. Thus, it is critical to confirm the chemical state of the Mn ion in the samples. The similar scattering lengths of Mn in say +2 or +3 do not allow resolution of changes in the chemical state. It is noted that the average stoichiometry obtained from the crystallographic site occupancies deduced from refinement of diffractograms does indicate Mn in the intended +2 state. However, it cannot be considered as sufficient evidence of constancy of the chemical state of Mn throughout the sample given possibilities of the existence of Sn and Cu in compensating chemical states or disproportionation of the Mn state throughout the sample.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Thus, as future work, a suggestion is made to look at the magnetic structure of these mixture to indirectly elucidate the chemical state of magnetic ion Mn. Another suggestion could be to do an analysis of the real-space representation of the diffractogram to note any changes in the coordination or the internal coordinates of bond-lengths and -angles. Otherwise as a last resort, perhaps additionally use X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to directly infer the chemical state of Mn in the bulk or at the surface.</p>

        <span class="bold">Galina Gurieva</span> responded: I would like to thank Dr Tiwari for this very extensive list of suggestions for checking the oxidation state of Mn. We will consider the possibility of performing one of the mentioned studies in the future. With regards to the suggestion to look at the magnetic structure of the mixture to indirectly elucidate the chemical state of the magnetic ion Mn, these mixtures show spin-ice behaviour at room temperature and thus such an analysis will be inconclusive for determining changes in the Mn chemical state.</p>

Or is it instead to say that whichever features of a compound cause it to crystallise as stannite, also favour ordered material? <span class="italic">E.g.</span> a compound with similarly sized atoms – such as copper and zinc – might preferentially form a kesterite due to that size similarity, and for the same reason also be disordered.

      <p class="otherpara">These defects would need to be taken into account in the compositional analysis.

This insensitivity to order/disorder and Zn/Mn ratio for <span class="italic">x</span> &lt; 0.7 seems possibly related to the low zinc contribution to the band edge, mentioned in the discussion of the previous paper.

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthew Naylor</span> answered: In this study we use highly crystalline nanoparticles, so-called nanocrystals, which we believe adds a degree of selectivity with respect to Ge doping and Ge inclusion. Therefore, 50 nm of Ge was used as an upper range to probe possible effects of Ge incorporations in a precursor of such <span class="italic">crystalline</span> nature. The relationship between precursor crystallinity and acceptance of dopant elements has been sparsely investigated for CZTS and CZTSSe films. Nevertheless, this work resides in line with reports in the literature that suggest highly crystalline sample are less receptive of dopant elements (for example reports see: ref. 1). The significance of this work is the application of this trend to decouple Ge doping/alloying effects from wider Ge incorporation effects. Thank you for raising this point of discussion. A concise review by the kesterite community comparing elemental incorporations as appose to isoelectric substitutions could be a useful addition to the literature.</p>

In the paper (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00069E">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00069e</a>) we distinguish between Ge-doping (low level) and alloying (high level).

It is possible there is a Ge-gradient in the film since these nanoparticles and added germanium completely recrystallize upon selenization. Would a Ge gradient be causing a challenge to measure the optical properties at various Ge concentrations?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthew Naylor</span> replied: This topic of recrystallisation is not well established in the literature and makes a good point for discussion. The effect of initial crystallinity of the nanocrystals (and metallic stacks also) is found to add a degree of selectiveness (with respect to accepted <span class="italic">ex situ</span> doping routes) – there is no such reason for this established in literature at present.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Yes, we believe there is a slight Ge-gradient towards the rear of the film (the original location of Ge) which indeed makes optical measurements complex. For future studies, the community should perhaps delaminate the MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CZTSSe interface and study properties of the rear surface. It would be beneficial to have an accepted procedure for this in the community so rear film damage is consistent across research centres. Thank you for this insightful discussion.</p>

Why you have used the 002 Bragg peak for this analysis? This peak is one of the smallest Bragg peaks in the XRD pattern (relative intensity of 0.4 to 1.2% assuming for the 112 Bragg peak with 100%). Why have you not chosen the 112 peak for that analysis?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Also, shifts of Bragg peaks due to incorporation of other elements into the crystal structure become more pronounced at higher 2<span class="italic">θ</span> values. But the 002 Bragg peak appears at quite low 2<span class="italic">θ</span> (15.6 to 15.7°). In my opinion the 002 Bragg peak is not very suitable for the analysis you have performed.

        <span class="bold">Matthew Naylor</span> responded: This is an insightful line of discussion indeed. For this study the emphasis was to investigate the effects of doping as appose to alloying and as such the reported Raman shifts are relatively small. As you identified in the question it is important to decouple contributors to a Raman shift especially in a quaternary system. In this regard, yes but S/Se and Sn/Ge may both be contributing to an increased shift in the A mode (199 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) peak, comparing the literature provided and a reference for Sn/Ge, see ref. 1. As the selenisation process was measured consistent between samples it is reasonable to assume that Ge-incorporation is primarily responsible for this change, but to claim this exclusively further investigation would be necessary. Ultimately Raman measurements were undertaken to confirm phase purity as appose to quantify the amount of substitution. This discussion possibly mandates the need new rule-of-thumb for Raman analysis for better data completeness in literature. Thank you again for the discussion.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthew Naylor</span> answered: This is a good observation and point for discussion. Multiple cross-section scanning electron microscope images were taken across the sample set and as such yes, we do think this reduction is correct. In terms of Ge playing a role in catalysing carbon removal, our opinion is along a similar but different line of thought. The fine grain layer in our devices is mainly comprised of residual carbon from the hot-injection process but does however contain a quantity of Se and S as well as traces of Cu, Zn and Sn. Building on the previous, it is possible that Ge assisted growth mechanisms allow for greater mass transport allowing for the traces of Cu, Zn and Sn to play an active role in the recrystallisation process.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthew Naylor</span> replied: Our hypothesis of Ge-assisted grain growth is similar to that found in literature. Due to an elevated Se vapour pressure the reaction between Se and Ge forms highly Se compensated species such as Ge<small><sub>3</sub></small>Se<small><sub>7</sub></small>. As you said and in accordance with the Ge–Se phase diagram these types of species form liquid phases which can act as a flux to enhance mass transport. This enhanced flux decreased the likelihood for trace unreacted metallic species to be present in the carbon layer thus, decreased the thickness of the fine grain layer.</p>

        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> asked: With introduction of a Ge layer at the back of the CZTS precursor film during processing, better CZTSSe device properties are reported. I was wondering how the introduction of the Ge layer on top of the molybdenum substrate might impact the formation of molybdenum selenide during selenization and how these prospective differences in the MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> layer might contribute to changes in device performance? Is there any evidence of Ge–Mo alloying or compound formation at the back contact during the selenization process?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthew Naylor</span> answered: This is an astute observation. We do not believe in this study that the presence of Ge adjacent to Mo forms Ge–Mo alloys and has little to no effect on the formation of MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Regarding Ge–Mo alloys, crystallographically there is no evidence to suggest the formation of alloys but to rule out the existence of these species a dedicated GI-XRD and Raman study would need to be undertaken.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Regarding the formation of MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the formation mechanism in our devices is heavily dictated by the properties of the Mo back contact films. These properties of the single Mo layer allow for reasonable conductivity while suppressing thickness of MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>, such properties emanate from the deposition parameters of the DC sputtering process. Due to a suppressed MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> formation and the Ge diffusion towards the front of the device we surmise that Ge has little influence on the formation mechanism of MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A Ge-influenced mechanism might present itself however if the Mo properties were different and/or the selenisation conditions were elevated and/or prolonged. As you raised, the role of MoSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> is of a great importance to device performance.</p>

        <span class="bold">Mingqing Wang</span> questioned: Based on the XPS result, the surface of CZTS film in your work is very Zn poor, this will affect the photovoltaic performance of your device. Have you done any surface treatment to remove the extra binary or ternary phase contamination?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Matthew Naylor</span> responded: This is a good observation. Typically CZTS(e) films are Zn-poor at the surface and Zn-rich towards the rear. In general, the literature supports this Zn gradient through the use of XPS, SIMS and or EDS depth profiles. A slight Zn gradient is observed in this work (<a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00069E">https://doi.org/10.1039/d2fd00069e</a>) but is not as prolific as the average literature case. This considerable composition change could indeed indicate segregation of CZTS quaternary nanocrystals into binary and ternary phases. In our experience starting with a quaternary precursor results in a benign segregation process. Nevertheless, surface treatments such as chemical etches would most likely compensate for this segregation to a degree. This study did not undertake any such surface treatments.</p>

        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> replied: Amorphous silicon (a-Si) was the dominant thin-film PV technology prior to the early 2000s. However, the amorphous (non-crystalline) nature and significant density of dangling bonds lead to substantial band tailing, a short minority carrier diffusion length and relatively inferior electrical transport properties. Also, the absorber performance degrades under light illumination (Staebler–Wronski effect).

        </span> noted: Regarding the potential to fix the <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> deficit in kesterites: our work in CZT(S,Se) has shown the material has recombination lifetimes on the order of hundreds of picoseconds. There is a lot more going on in the characterization data (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> TRPL) since they are non-ideal than is initially apparent or easily extracted. This doesn't really agree with shallow tailing problems that can be resolved with single crystals or order/disorder transitions; rather, there are significant deep defects that are intrinsic to the material itself that kill the lifetime.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Jonathan J. S. Scragg</span> said: Defects are obviously critical, but I suspect we are not always looking in the right places for the defects we blame for our problems. In CZTS, we know there are deep Sn-related defects. Ge alloying is claimed to suppress these, which is a motivation for Ge alloying. I don't buy that argument: replacing 10% of the Sn atoms would not make enough of a difference to the concentration of deep Sn-related defects to matter for device performance. And yet, Ge inclusion does create some improvements. How does it do that? In another example, we saw that thinning the CZTS layers allowed performance to be retained surprisingly well. The common feature in both examples is that morphology is improved. I think we need to pay more attention to morphologically related defect structures – for example, dislocations, twins, planar defects, stacking faults <span class="italic">etc.</span>, that can occur in our crystals but which we really do not pay much attention to. What if such features contribute to band tailing, defect levels, <span class="italic">etc.</span> We need some better ways of evaluating crystal quality, to quantify the presence of structural defects and give us the means to investigate this hypothesis.</p>

        <span class="bold">Thomas Unold</span> responded: I think this is a good point. However we should always consider that in material of different quality there might be different reasons that limit recombination. In a recent study<small><sup>1</sup></small> in fact grain boundaries were identified to limit performance (to 12%) – which means that in these films the bulk point defects have been significantly reduced.</p>

        <span class="bold">Matthew Sutton</span> enquired: What are general opinions on approaching solar cell design from a stability-first or performance-first standpoint? I think performance-first is quite common, for example with perovskite cells, however ideally cells could be built from stable materials to begin with rather than the substitution/passivation currently needed for perovskites. Wondering what others' thoughts are on this.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Mirjana Dimitrievska</span> replied: I think now, more and more researchers are considering both aspects equally, so we are on a good point moving forward.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">Joachim Breternitz</span> added: I believe this is an important point for the future and the prospect of designing materials that favour stability over performance at the first glance is pretty appealing. However, I have the feeling that we may face the problem – at least from an experimental point-of-view – that performance is much quicker to assess than stability (especially of devices). The latter may afford experiments that take much more time for each individual experiment and hence prolong this first assessment step significantly. I believe that due to this, a concentration on stability in the first instance appears more natural. It is, however, most important to bear all aspects in mind as they all play a role in a final assessment. Therefore, I would argue that both aspects, performance and stability, need to be considered at every stage.</p>

        <span class="bold">Alex Ganose</span> remarked: Typically the role of the effective mass of the absorber has been seen as a trade-off: small effective masses give high mobility but small joint density of states (JDOS) leading to poor absorption coefficients, whereas high effective masses give large JDOS and high absorption but poor mobility.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">However, that is only for a single valley, single band model. There is a way to optimise both JDOS and effective masses by having a system with a high valley degeneracy. In this case, each valley can be very disperse (with a small effective mass) but the degeneracy (due to symmetry equivalent valleys throughout the Brillouin zone) can result in large JDOS. You typically find this behaviour in high-symmetry systems where the band edges occur away from a high-symmetry point in the Brillouin zone. This same design principle is widely used by the thermoelectrics community.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The valleys do not even have to be symmetry equivalent. For example, some emerging absorbers like Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> and GeSe have many valence and conduction band pockets, some of which are quite disperse with small effective masses, but also have strong optical absorption.</p>

        <span class="bold">Kostiantyn Sopiha</span> addressed David Mitzi: You mentioned that Ag substitution in CZTS reduces hole density and converts the material into n-type, which complicates the potential device structure. What do you think about adding external dopants? Does it have the potential to keep Ag-alloyed CZTS p-type and hence stick with the same device structure? If yes, what dopants would you consider suitable (if you have any guesses)?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> answered: This is a good question. Generally speaking, although intrinsic CZTS and CZTSe are p-type, the analogous Ag-substituted materials are n-type. The switch in carrier type occurs because of changes in the band structure and associated readily formed intrinsic defects (as described, for example, in ref. 1). While in principle, one can try to determine possible dopants to p-dope AZTS/AZTSe, in practice the process of doing this is likely to be complicated by compensation mechanisms – in other words, an impurity may be added to dope the semiconductor, but the resulting prospective shift in Fermi level will induce other defects to form that will counteract the doping effect of the impurity. Based on defect calculations, it is expected that p-type doping may be difficult in AZTS/AZTSSe. Nevertheless, there have been some reports of possible p-type conductivity in these systems (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, ref. 2). Another approach to fashion a system that is more readily p-doped is to consider systems with mixed Cu/Ag.</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan J. S. Scragg</span> asked: The point was made that chalcogenides tend to suffer from a <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> deficit. Looking more at the sub-groups, one could make a case that the sulfides tend to have worse deficit than the selenides, and possibly that the tellurides are performing best. How deep does this issue go – can you speculate? Does the <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> deficit of sulfides arise from some feature of sulfur itself that impacts electronic properties? Or is it rather to do with a synthesis chemistry that disadvantages sulfides over selenides (and chalcogenides over <span class="italic">e.g.</span> halides)? Also, could you hold up an example of an “excellent” sulfide material, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> with high luminescence efficiency, that could demonstrate the opposite?</p>
      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> answered: One pathway that may lead to worse defect properties for sulfides, relative to selenides (and possibly tellurides) simply relates to associated band gaps. For a given structure type, sulfides will tend to have larger band gaps than corresponding selenides and tellurides. As the band gap increases, the defect states associated with crystallographic imperfections will tend to reside deeper within the band gap and therefore be more active with respect to recombination. In terms of “synthesis chemistry”, it is possible that the higher volatility of sulfur relative to selenium/tellurium may make it more challenging to avoid certain types of defects (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, chalcogen vacancies). In many cases, I believe that these issues can be dealt with by controlling the synthesis pathway (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, including a chalcogen vapor during at least some stage of absorber formation). Importantly, moving to heavier chalcogen does not always lead to more defect-friendly materials. CdTe (key commercialized thin-film material) has suffered from <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> deficit for decades. Only recently are CdTe devices being made with reduced <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> deficit (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, see ref. 1).</p>

        <span class="bold">Jonathan Major</span> remarked: This is a follow up on Jonathan J. S. Scragg's question and what David Mitzi was saying. I think what you have got to think about is the idea of polycrystallinity and the <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> losses involved in that. The reason I say that is from the cadmium telluride world, where I think it was mentioned, possibly in David's talk, about single crystal devices that get a <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> of about 1.1 V, which is a significantly reduced <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> deficit compared to the polycrystalline version. So those losses seem to be more inherent in the structure of the films and the polycrystallinity, than in the chalcogenide nature of the materials themselves.</p>

        <span class="bold">Sreekanth Mandati</span> enquired: Is it the ionic bond nature in perovskites that makes them unique materials to attain maximum <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small>?

        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> responded: Lead-iodide-based perovskites indeed offer significant ionic character and this coupled with the electronic configuration of the Pb and I atoms appears to play a role in generating the rather unique band structure and defect characteristics of this system (see, for example, ref. 1). I find it difficult to <span class="italic">a priori</span> predict how “defect resistant” a particular semiconductor (collection of atoms in a particular crystal structure) will end up being. The defect resistance evidently arises from the nature of states contributing to the band edges, as well as the screening potential of the material (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, dielectric constant). Interestingly, I think that there has been a recent prediction that GeSe may be “defect tolerant,” due to an antibonding valence band maximum derived from Ge 4s–Se 4p coupling,<small><sup>2</sup></small> similar to the case for halide perovskites. However, current champion devices based on this material still show low <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small>.</p>

      <p class="otherpara">I think, it is at least partly due to the wide bandgap.

I understand that this defect accounts for the poorer performance of sulfide CIGS, but in other structures and chemistries we should not necessarily expect the same behaviour. Or should we? Is there some reason that sulfide materials should tend to have deeper defects compared to selenides, for example?

Defects tend to stay at the same absolute energy (has been shown nicely for H related defects by van de Walle and Neugebauer<small><sup>1</sup></small>).

      <p class="otherpara">
        <span class="bold">David Mitzi</span> commented: The question of why emerging chalcogenide semiconductors all seem to share a large <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> deficit (compared to the fundamental limit for a given bandgap) is key for those working in this area. It is probably useful to note that lead-halide-based perovskites are relatively unique in terms of their “defect tolerance” and ability to achieve very high <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> within a polycrystalline absorber (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, chalcogenides are not alone in terms of the difficulty in overcoming the influence of defects). Notably “defect tolerance” does not mean lack of defects but rather points to the fact that the defects present within the film are not very active with regards to recombination. In GaAs, although an exceptionally high <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> can be achieved (close to the fundamental limit), in this case the high performance is accessible in very carefully grown high-quality single-crystal-like absorbers. Since ideally, we would like to employ polycrystalline films and not have to grow films with a vanishingly small defect density (probably expensive), the question is whether we can induce a similar level of defect tolerance into a metal chalcogenide system as for the lead-halide-based perovskites. Ultimately, doing this will require understanding the bonding characteristics within the chalcogenides, as detailed for the broader family of thin-film absorbers in several reviews on the topic of defect tolerance (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, see ref. 1–3). In principle, I am not aware of a reason why a defect tolerant band structure shouldn't be achievable in emerging chalcogenide systems, and there has even been some indication that GeSe may offer opportunity in this regard.<small><sup>4</sup></small></p>
