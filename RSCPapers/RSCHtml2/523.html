      <h2 id="sect478"><span class="a_heading">1 Metals</span></h2>
      <span>Many of the papers reviewed continue to demonstrate a range of valuable applications to a variety of metals. The trend in applications based on multiple spectroscopic techniques continues with a growing need for detailed micro-structural and compositional information. Many papers were based on a mature platform of commercially available instrumentation and focussed more on application than innovation. These have not been included in this review and emphasis has been given to papers presenting fundamental development of instrumentation and associated methodologies.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Details of some of the key papers are highlighted to illustrate the most advanced level of development and progressive trends to profile state-of-the-art metals analysis.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect483"><span class="b_heading">1.1. Ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>Many of the reviewed papers covering the analysis and characterization of ferrous metal exploit the synergy of <span class="italic">multiple spectroscopic methods</span> to provide the required level of information. It is notable that this approach has been adopted by many research groups from a diverse range of disciplines with a focus more on application than development. A strong interest in applications to modern surface modification has been noted within this reporting period. In the work of Escalada <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Grazing Angle X-ray Diffraction (GA-XRD), SIMS, SIMS with Focussed Ion Beam (SIMS-FIB) and EDX were used to determine the composition, microstructure and depth of a stainless steel surface modified by TiN deposition. Nitride surface engineering enhances the tribological properties of metals to extend their use into wear resistance applications. The formation of surface TiN by cathodic deposition in combination with plasma ion implantation was studied. The spectroscopic methods used showed a collective sensitivity capable of differentiating between the effects of the two separate coating processes. The authors presented results showing a superior coating thickness, corrosion and wear resistance from the combined surface treatment not matched by the separate surface modifications. Similar work was carried out by Dalibon <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> who provided a detailed structural analysis of the nitride coating using the same instrumentation with the addition of dark field TEM adding valuable information on lattice expansion and internal stresses. Both papers illustrate the analytical support for the development of modern advanced steel coatings. In these examples analytical capability has been demonstrated and the basis for a routine method outlined.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Analysis of corrosion has been approached in a similar way to coatings, using multiple spectroscopic methods to provide structural and compositional information. Ardigo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> utilized SEM-EDX and SIMS to identify the corrosive processes in a high temperature water vapour electrolysis unit, designed for hydrogen production. This work focussed on oxide scale growth processes on ferritic stainless steel, K41X (AISI 441) in the cathode atmospheres (10% H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, 90% H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O). Ageing tests covering a period up to 1000 hours revealed the formation of a duplex oxide scale: an inner layer consisting of protective chromia and an outer layer comprised of a magnetite-type iron oxide. These results allowed the authors to propose a diffusion mechanism controlling corrosion and the roles played by hydrogen and water.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Analytical spectroscopy has become a vital part of archaeology, providing scientific detail to supplement the historical record. It has become common to utilize more than one spectroscopic method to provide the required level of information. Necemer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> utilized the synergy of ED-XRF and PIXE to analyse ancient Asian daggers to ascertain the materials involved, methods of manufacture and provenance. Elemental analysis was provided by ED-XRF with PIXE focussed to provide compositional data for the non-metallic inclusions indicating the possible use of meteoric iron in the manufacturing process. More papers detailing advances in the analysis of archaeological artefacts are reviewed in Sections 2.2.1 and 3.1.1.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Analysis using LIBS continues to be a popular research and development topic; applications to ferrous metals have largely focussed on improvements to quantitative sensitivity. The complex nature of the laser-sample interaction imparts an inherent level of variability into LIBS analysis. This originates from the necessity to use pulsed lasers (Q-switched) to provide sufficient energy for atomization and excitation of the solid sample surface. As a result, the quantitative sensitivity is generally accepted as the Achilles' heel of LIBS. This is underlined by the number of papers which focussed on improving fundamental sensitivity; the majority topic for papers on LIBS within this review period. It has become standard practice to develop and optimize applications based on a fundamental model of plasma physics coupled with spectroscopic measurements. Underpinning this central model is the justified assumption that laser induced plasma is in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). From this, plasma temperature can be determined <span class="italic">via</span> the Boltzmann Plot method using two or more atomic lines to form an integrated line intensities ratio. In addition, Stark Broadening of spectral lines can be used to measure the electron number density. With an array of laser and spectrometer variables available to the analyst for optimization, this approach has become central to many research groups.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Improvements to the detection sensitivity through the use of internal standards to compensate for LIBS variability is accepted practice. Thermodynamic principles are often applied to matching analyte to reference element based on comparable excitation potentials. This principle is valid during conditions of LTE which are only satisfied during part of the of the plasma cycle. Labutin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> considered the difficulties establishing when LTE could be assumed within the transient plasma events. Considering the errors in the resulting analysis if thermodynamic principles are applied inappropriately, the authors proposed an additional selection criterion. For the selection of Fe internal reference lines for steel analysis it was proposed that the most robust approach was to establish the best correlation between the intensities of the various analyte and Fe emission lines. For the determination of Mn in high alloy steels, a homologous pair of Mn I 404.136 nm and Fe I 411.854 nm was recommended for LIBS analysis. A long linear range was reported with high linearity (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.996) and good signal-to-noise ratio. An alternative approach by Shah <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> exploited advances in modern fast electronic time-gating to study the temporal evolution of emissions from the plasma events. The intensity ratio of two Fe I lines was measured and matched to its theoretical value; the delay times where the plasma is optically thin and is also in LTE were found to be 800, 900 and 1000 nanoseconds.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> demonstrated that the size of the <span class="italic">crater formed during ablative plasma formation can influence detection sensitivity.</span> Referenced pairs of emission lines for V (V I 440.85 nm and Fe I 438.35 nm), Cr (Cr I 425.43 nm and Fe I 425.08 nm) and Mn (Mn 476.64 nm and Fe 492.05 nm) were used to monitor elements present in trace amounts in a steel matrix. It was demonstrated that single shot excitation at 1064 nm at a power density of 49.2 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> produced the highest level of sensitivity and accuracy from the bottom of a 5 mm diameter cut into the steel surface. The authors reported enhancement to the emission intensity of V, Cr, and Mn lines by factors of 4.2, 3.1, and 2.87, respectively. Improvements were attributed to the confinement of the plasma by the cavity and enhancing the spatial uniformity. This work highlights another variable available to the analyst for optimising LIBS applications.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Sample surface preparation by removal of surface material through ablation as part of the analytical cycle is an important advantage of LIBS. Scharun <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> exploited this in the development of a hand held probe which delivers 1.33 mJ single laser shots to the metal sample surface <span class="italic">via</span> a fibre-optic at a repetition rate of 30 kHz. Advances in the production of high purity fibre-optics have permitted the delivery of this level of laser intensity sufficient for LIBS. Emission radiation can also be transmitted to the spectrometer <span class="italic">via</span> fibre-optic allowing the sensing head to be miniaturized with the laser and spectrometer located remotely. This development illustrates some of the unique strengths of LIBS making it inherently suitability for at-site/<span class="italic">in situ</span> analysis. For several years these attributes have been exploited as a pragmatic approach to scrap sorting. The work of Kashiwakura and Wagatsuma<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> used a Nd:YAG laser combined with a spectrometer and an Imaging Charged Coupled Detector (ICCD) detection to identify steel scrap, based on Cu content. Standard reference materials were used to establish optimum detection parameters reported as requiring relatively short delay times and longer gate times. For Cu detection the Cu I line at 327.396 nm was identified as having least spectral interferences allowing detection down to 0.004% based on 200 pulsed laser shots.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another aspect of at-site analysis is <span class="italic">direct analysis of molten metal</span>, an application uniquely achievable by LIBS. In this situation LIBS makes good use of the high pulse repetition rate to follow a process in real-time with high precision. Pan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> investigated the quantitative analysis of steel at high-temperature and in the molten state under different reduced pressure environments. This work is linked to steel degassing in which the molten steel is subjected to partial vacuum. This is a critical stage for many steel grades and this paper constitutes a feasibility study for this application from the spectroscopic perspective. Using a Q-switched laser, quantitative data were recorded for a range of steel temperatures around 1600 °C at pressures down to 1 × 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small> Pa. Spectroscopic data indicated that the whole system functioned well and it was considered suitable for application to molten metal analysis under a reduced pressure environment. Linking this work with industrial steel processing places an analytical need for nitrogen analysis as this processing stage is carried out to remove nitrogen from molten steel. Exploiting LIBS to provide continuous compositional analysis within the vacuum chamber during refining would be a valuable process control facility but would present considerable engineering challenges.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">For bulk analysis, <span class="italic">enhanced sensitivity may be obtained through the use of dual-pulse LIBS</span> in which the plasma, formed on the sample surface from the first ablation laser pulse, is further excited by a second re-heat pulse following 0.1 to 1 μs later. Jiang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> observed spectral lines emitted by ions in the shorter wavelength vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) spectral region to study the plasmas generated on steel targets. Time-integrated, spatially-resolved LIBS was used to investigate spectral emissions from laser-induced plasmas generated on steel targets. Single-pulse and dual-pulse LIBS experiments were performed on standardized steel samples. In the case of the double-pulsed LIBS, two synchronized lasers were used, an ablation laser (200 mJ/15 ns), and a reheating laser (665 mJ/6 ns) in a collinear beam geometry. Spatially resolved and temporally integrated laser induced plasma emission in the VUV were studied under dual-pulse operation with specific attention given to the dependence on inter-pulse delay. The VUV spectral line intensities were enhanced in the dual-pulse configuration and were significantly affected by inter-pulse delay time. Additionally, the influence of ambient conditions was investigated by employing low pressure nitrogen, argon or helium as buffer gases in the ablation chamber. For C emission at 97.7 nm, argon was reported to be the ideal gas environment to maximize sensitivity.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In steel production the need for <span class="italic">in situ analysis</span> is paramount. Although LIBS and LA-ICP-OES have been applied over the years they have not been fully deployed due to engineering and maintenance issues. A novel approach by Aula <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> investigated the possibility of utilising atomic emissions from the arc discharges of a production electric arc furnace. The aim of achieving a dynamic monitor of slag composition during processing was considered in a series of laboratory tests. The CrOx/FeOx and MnO/SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> ratios for different slag compositions were studied for arc discharge conditions similar to those from an industrial electric arc furnace including authentic voltage variations. A good correlation between the arc discharge and the corresponding samples, analysed by XRF, was reported. If dynamic slag analysis could be realized on an industrial scale, partitioning of elements between the slag and metal could be monitored during processing. The analytes Cr and Mn are of particular interest as partitioning is controllable and if monitored in real-time would facilitate tighter process control. Currently no effective methods of real-time slag analysis are available so this initiative could provide data that would not be available otherwise.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A study of the factors affecting <span class="italic">optical emission sensitivity from a microwave-induced plasma using an Okamoto-cavity</span> has been reported by Zhang and Wagatsuma.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> The structure of micro-wave plasma within an Okamoto-cavity was visualized using 2-dimensional images of atomic and ionic Cr emissions. With molecular band heads of nitrogen also studied in 2-dimensions, the influence of oxygen concentration on the emission intensity of Cr was studied. The authors reported that atomic Cr line emission is greatly increased with increasing levels of oxygen in the nitrogen plasma gas up to a concentration of 10%. Conversely, the intensities of ionic chromium lines and the nitrogen bands were both reduced when oxygen gas was added to the nitrogen plasma. This result implies that the ionization of chromium, which dominates through collisions with nitrogen excited species, can be suppressed because the nitrogen excited species would be consumed through collisions with oxygen molecules causing dissociation. Understanding the critical instrumental factors affecting detection sensitivity is a progressive step towards the development of this technique. The potential for improved signal-to-noise from higher power inputs and lower background emission intensities in comparison to ICP, offers potential for improved steel analysis.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Although the majority of papers are based on solid sample analysis, several focus on developing <span class="italic">methods requiring sample pre-treatment</span>. This is often required to remove the metal matrix for trace analysis. Hasegawa<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> used solid phase extraction to selectively remove the iron matrix from acid digests of iron and steel samples to improve sensitivity of ICP-OES analysis. This approach avoided the need for EDTA masking agent and pH buffering. Detection limits (3<span class="italic">σ</span>) in steel samples were reported for a range of trace elements at the ppb level (Mo 1.06) and below (Nb 0.025) with aspects of the method designed to maximize precision through automation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Many modern steel grades require a detailed <span class="italic">characterization of non-metallic inclusions within the iron matrix.</span> The properties of steel products which are drawn to wire or rolled to thin sheet are critically dependant on the size, morphology and composition of non-metallic inclusions. In addition to product release testing, analysis of inclusions is a diagnostic tool for many processing problems. Analysis by selective chemical dissolution is a popular method of quantifying and characterising non-metallic inclusions. Bellot and Lamesle<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> used selective chemical dissolution of the iron matrix, to expose the non-metallic inclusions in a super alloy treated steel grade. It was reported that the size and morphology of the precipitates could be accurately measured using high-resolution SEM for a large range of dimensions down to 10 nm. Dissolution of the particles and elemental analysis by ICP-OES established the relative amounts of Ti, Al and Nb exclusively from the inclusions; quantitatively linking precipitation to the alloyed concentrations of the elements of interest in the steel prior to heat treatment. Non-metallic inclusions can be analysed directly from solid metal samples <span class="italic">via</span> spark-OES and LIBS; however, it is difficult to define size and morphology. Microscopy also requires interpretation as inclusions are sectioned randomly. Matrix extraction provides a route to a definitive analysis of size, morphology and composition.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect547"><span class="b_heading">1.2. Non-ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>As in the previous section, the use of multiple spectroscopic methods has been shown to be a powerful approach to a wide range of applications. <span class="italic">Depth profiling of corrosion layers or coated metals</span> often relies on SIMS to provide the required depth and compositional sensitivity. Pillatsch <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> exploited the He<small><sup>+</sup></small> and Ne<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam of a helium ion microscope to perform SIMS analysis in a prototype system. The authors reported that the high lateral resolution of microscopy combined with high sensitivity chemical mapping had improved the quality of SIMS information. Applied across a range of metallic (Al, Ni and W) and semiconductor samples (Si, Ge, GaAs, and InP), a lateral resolution of less than 50 nm was achieved. Detection at the ppm level was reported using a Ne<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam albeit at a reduced lateral resolution of 100 nm.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">LIBS features strongly in the papers reviewed as opportunities for application across a range of metals continue to emerge. With the many factors now known to influence LIBS analysis each new application generates publishable material. This may account for the high representation of LIBS papers within this review period.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Advances in opto-electronics for LIBS have reduced pulse duration beyond the nanosecond range with modern lasers capable of providing femtosecond pulses with great precision. Theoretically, femtosecond lasers interact with the sample by a mechanism which avoids the excessive plasma heating associated with nanosecond pulses. Freeman <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> investigated the plasma characteristics resulting from nanosecond and femtosecond laser pulse irradiation of brass samples. Using identical energy densities, it was reported that the emission spectrum from nanosecond pulse irradiation showed high continuum with elemental emissions predominantly from lower charged ions. In contrast, negligible continuum and dominance of emissions from neutral species was observed from femtosecond pulse irradiation. The temporal characteristics of the plasma were similar in terms of temperature and electron density for both pulse durations although the expansion rate for femtosecond lasers was reported to be twice that of the nanosecond pulse. In addition, it was noted that the ambient gas surrounding the plasma has a significant effect on the plasma temperature. The ambient gas is described as affecting the containment of the plasma which can enhance and sustain the temperature and density. It was proposed that ambient gases which sustain hot plasma will delay emissions. By this mechanism the ambient gas is shown to be a significant factor in the temporal emission profile.

The Nd:YAG laser harmonics 1064 nm, 532 nm and 266 nm were used for the initial ablative, pre-analysis pulse and the infra-red harmonic at 1064 nm was used as the analytical reheat pulse in all cases. Several emission lines were used including Al (281.65 nm and 466.30 nm) and Si (288.15 nm) to derive plasma temperatures and electron density. These parameters were used to measure the spectroscopic effects of laser wavelength and inter-pulse delay. The dual pulse configuration of 1064 nm ablation and excitation at the same wavelength showed the most sensitivity to variations in the inter-pulse delay but all dual pulsed configurations were reported to produce higher detection sensitivities. Ablation at the UV wavelength of 266 nm and excitation using the infra-red wavelength of 1064 nm produced the highest absolute emission intensity.

Sample preparation procedures for the direct analysis of fuels by using liquid sample introduction systems are critically reviewed and compared. The most employed methods are sample dilution, emulsion or micro-emulsion preparation and sample decomposition. The first is the most widely employed due to its simplicity.

          <span>The technique of LIBS remains popular for coal analysis.

The hybrid model is composed of two steps of wavelet analysis procedures, which include environmental de-noising and background noise reduction, to pretreat the LIBS spectrum. The processed wavelet coefficients which contain the discrete line information of the spectra were taken as inputs for the PLS model for calibration and prediction of carbon content. A higher signal-to-noise ratio for a carbon line was obtained after environmental de-noising and the best decomposition level was determined after background noise reduction. The hybrid model resulted in a significant improvement over the conventional PLS method under different ambient environments, which include air, argon, and helium. The average relative error of carbon decreased from 2.74 to 1.67% under an ambient helium environment, which indicated a significantly improved accuracy in the measurement of carbon in coal.

A combination of GFAAS and TGA-DSC was used to simulate the gas-melt partitioning of semi-volatile trace elements such as As, Sb and Se from excluded minerals during the initial dynamic step of coal combustion. To properly simulate exclusion, the effect of carbon in the graphite furnace tubes on TE vaporization was minimized by coating the tube with an inert metal oxide (either ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> or WO<small><sub>3</sub></small>). The Arrhenius activation energies of TE volatilization/atomization obtained upon fast heating in such a carbon-free GFAAS microenvironment, with and without mineral matrices were measured. They were compared with those obtained in uncoated tubes to verify that the influence of carbon had been eliminated and to obtain insights on the mechanism of TE evolution. Cationic inorganic matrices such as Ca and Fe influenced the carbon-free evolution of Se and Sb in different ways than in the presence of carbon indicating that TE partitioning from mineral exclusions during coal combustion may be significantly different from TE partitioning from organically associated material and mineral inclusions. Calcium increases the Se (and, to some extent, As) retention in the solid phase due to common acid–base chemistry, whereas iron as well as anionic matrices, such as aluminate and silicate, do not influence TE atomization in mineral exclusions. By contrast, in inclusions these minerals decrease the extent of TE atomization by shielding it from the reducing action of carbon. A significant chemical reduction of As to its elemental form was observed which does not appear to be influenced by the presence of carbon. By contrast, the extent of Sb and Se atomization depends on this factor which is different in exclusions compared with inclusions. Therefore the presented method provides information that can be used to predict the predominant TE speciation in the gas phase.</p>

          <span>As with crude oil and gasoline analysis, <span class="italic">emulsion-based analytical approaches</span> were popular this year. Lisboa <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> described a procedure for the determination of Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, MN, Na and Si in biodiesel by ICP-OES using emulsification based on formic acid (15% v/v) and Triton X-100 (0.1% m/v). The concentrations were optimized and emulsified aqueous standards and samples were found to be stable for at least 3 hours. Experimental conditions (1500 W of RF power and 0.5 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of Ar nebulizer flow rate) were optimized with a solution containing 10 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of each analyte prepared with mineral oil in the same manner as the samples. Matrix effects were investigated by observing the slopes of the analyte addition curves for different biodiesel samples. Results showed that external calibration with inorganic aqueous standard solutions in the emulsion medium could be used. Limits of detection obtained (mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) were 0.121, 0.008, 0.006, 0.241, 0.001, 0.006, 0.071 and 0.024 for Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mn, Mg, Na and Si, respectively. The accuracy of the procedure for Ca, K, Mg and Na was assessed by the analysis of a multi-element standard B100 biodiesel (Conostan) and the recoveries ranged from 91 to 107%.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Emulsions were also used by Pereira <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> although this method also used emulsion breaking to extract the metals. Their paper “Novel extraction induced by emulsion breaking as a tool for the determination of trace concentrations of Cu, Mn and Ni in biodiesel by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry” describes an emulsion extraction approach to sample preparation. The extraction was performed using an emulsifier solution containing 2.1 mol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and 7% m/v of Triton X-100. The extraction time had a large influence on the efficiency of the process with an agitation time of 60 min being necessary to achieve maximum extraction.

No sample preparation other than simple dilution in methanol or ethanol was required.

          <p class="otherpara">Andersen <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> evaluated a typical commercial <span class="italic">multi-element method using a WDXRF spectrometer for analysis of biomass</span>. With the increasing utilization and trade of biomass there is a growing need for quick and reliable quantitative chemical analysis of the inorganic elemental composition. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy is an attractive method because of the limited sample preparation necessary, however universal multi-element analysis can be very hard to implement mainly due to problems with matrix corrections. Users of XRF therefore often rely on commercial pre-calibrated or standard less methods supplied with their XRF spectrometer. These methods are often sold without any guarantee of performance. A typical example of such methods recently purchased with a 4 kW WDXRF spectrometer was investigated. The accuracy was determined by analysing certified inorganic elements in 13 CRMs of diverse vegetal/plant origin. The certified elements detected by the XRF are Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cl, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na. Ni, P, Pb, Rb, S, Sr, V and Zn. The relative systematic error (bias, trueness) was found to be better than ±20% for elements in the range 25 to 100 ppm, better than ±15% for the range 100 to 1000 ppm, and better than ±10% for concentrations above 1000 ppm. The relative precision (measured as the relative standard error) was better than ±5% (typically ±1–2%) for concentrations &gt;25 ppm. Occasionally, larger relative biases of up to ±40% can occur for certain elements in certain samples so care has to be taken to carefully test the applied method for the particular samples and elements of interest. The XRF method can further be used to estimate the ash yield from biomass combustion with a relative bias (trueness) typically better than ±15%. This involves the determination of Si and Ti by XRF. The choice of matrix composition in the matrix correction model and the influences of sample moisture and sample grain-size were also addressed.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two-dimensional LIBS mapping of liquefied petroleum gas and electrolytic oxy-hydrogen flames has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> There have been several successful applications of LIBS to combustion analyses which include the identification of industrial exhausts and the determination of fuel equivalence ratio and the composition measurements of hydrocarbons. Thus far the application of LIBS to combustion diagnostics has focussed on the measurement of chemical species in small local volumes or along a one-dimensional line. In this work they considered flames of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and electrolytic oxy-hydrogen (EOH) for chemical analysis <span class="italic">via</span> LIBS. Two-dimensional mapping allowed for spatial dimensionality in a conventional LIBS point measurement. Information about the dissociated chemical species (gas phase) and soot (solid particle phase) unattainable <span class="italic">via</span> any other means was provided by the system. Both atomic and molecular chemical contours of LPG, LPG–EOH mixture, and LPG–air mixture flames were presented. A brown gas generator generated EOH gas, which was mixed with LPG gas using mass flow controllers to control the flow rates. The mixed fuel was fed into a burner through a co-axial nozzle with its inner hole (0.68 mm diameter) and outer hole (3.1 mm diameter) separated by a 2 mm circular wall. The burner traverses along the <span class="italic">x</span> and <span class="italic">y</span> axes for resolved point measurements at varied grid positions to construct 2-D images. The plasma is generated by a laser beam with a wavelength of 532 nm through a convex lens that has a 120 mm focal length. Since the flame density differs according to the fuel, the laser energy that generates plasma was changed for different fuel mixtures. The C/N LIBS signal represents concentration of the LPG fuel. The H/O LIBS signal provides the fuel/air equivalence ratio in the flame. Thus, additional flame information, unavailable <span class="italic">via</span> other means such as density, atomic and molecular concentrations, and fuel/air equivalence ratio, is provided by the two-dimensional LIBS mapping technique presented in this paper.</p>

Previous methods using gold traps eliminate interferences from aromatic hydrocarbons but are only a semi-continuous measurement. This study proposed a novel Hg continuous emissions monitor (CEM) to measure the Hg concentration in fuel gases. The pre-treatment unit consisted of an electric-heated quartz tube reactor filled with an oxygen carrier (NiO), dispersed into quartz sand. The gas at a controlled flow rate was fed into the reactor at an elevated temperature. All the flammable gases were converted into CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, and all Hg species were transformed into elemental vapour. The product gases were then introduced into the condenser to remove water and finally the concentration of elemental Hg in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was detected by CVAAS without any interference issues. The oxygen carrier is reduced to metal by the fuel in the fuel reactor, and then oxidized in air in the air reactor, forming an oxide to complete the looping. Two types of gases containing Hg (toluene and coal pyrolysis gas) were continuously measured by the proposed Hg CEM. The results showed that satisfactory Hg recoveries were attained with CLC pre-treatment, whereas the data without CLC pre-treatment were totally distorted.</p>

          <span>The challenges posed by the need for the analysis of high value objects, specifically art and historical objects are driving some significant developments in analytical technology, as evidenced by the large number of papers dealing with applications in this field. The analysis of ceramics based artifacts are reviewed in Section 3.1.1 and a paragraph dealing with metal artifacts is included in Section 1.1.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Advances in instrumentation include the development of portable instrumentation and the first commercially available mobile instrument for <span class="italic">in situ</span> scanning macro-XRF (MA-XRF) investigations of historical paintings has been reported by Alfeld <span class="italic">et al</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a> The technique of MA-XRF is a variant of XRF imaging which allows for the visualization of elemental distribution on flat macroscopic surfaces. This kind of analysis has enabled the elemental distribution within images to visualize hidden paint layers, providing unique insights into the creative process employed by the artist and the conservation history of the painting. The instrument is capable of imaging the distribution of the main constituents of the surface and sub-surface layers of paint over an area of 80 cm by 60 cm, with dwell times below 10 ms and a lateral resolution of better than 100 μm. The elemental capability of this instrument ranges from Ta to Mo with K-line sensitivity for these elements being presented. For many elements present at 1% m/m, signals of more than 1000 cps were achieved, giving 1 s LOD of around 100 ppm for these elements. Heavier elements such as Au, Hg and Pb were also easily imaged, as their L-lines fall within this range. It should be noted that for many heavier elements including Cd the absorption of the L-lines by covering layers of paint precluded the imaging of these elements in hidden paint layers. The authors acknowledged that the instrument suffered a lack of sensitivity for lines more energetic than for those of Rh (20.2 KeV). Visualizing heavier elements including Cd, Sn, and Sb by their K-lines was problematic as they are crucial elements in the study of many paintings.</p>

This instrument utilized a <span class="italic">wide field uniform excitation X-ray beam</span> and a position sensitive energy dispersive detector. The fluorescence from a 10 cm by 10 cm was acquired and projected onto a gas electron multiplier detector of the same area. Compared with conventional imaging techniques, this new instrument reduced analysis time by 2 or 3 orders of magnitude and represents a significant advance in imaging capability.</p>

          <span>The technique of LIBS continues to command much interest in many application areas, not least of which is in the detection of harmful materials. <span class="italic">Standoff LIBS</span> has been employed for the classification of trace residues as either hazardous (explosives, biological, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) or non-hazardous and has been reviewed in previous review articles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> This technique is ideal for this type of analysis due to the requirement for minimal or no sample preparation, the minimal sample amount required to generate a usable emission spectrum and the ability to generate a signal in standoff mode, in some cases from a distance of many metres. One of the difficulties with LIBS can be its limited selectivity, although this has recently been addressed by several means, including the use of chemometrics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">Moros <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> have employed a <span class="italic">multi-stage architecture algorithm</span> built from a suitable combination of 3 learning classifiers, to classify fingerprints into a particular class. Neural network classifiers trained by the Levenberg–Marquardt rule were decided within 3D scatterplots projected onto the subspace of the most useful features extracted from the LIBS spectra. When fingerprints present on a manuscript containing one of six explosives (chloratite, ammonal, DNT, TNT, RDX and PETN) and a range of non-hazardous interferents, including butter, fuel oil and hand cream were analysed by LIBS, the algorithm was able to sort the fingerprints according to their hazardous character, even though their spectra were virtually identical in appearance. False positive and negative results were reported to be no higher than 10%. This demonstrates the power of a chemometric approach in obtaining maximum information from LIBS spectra.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Remote detection of fingerprints thought to contain explosives residues has also been demonstrated by Lucena <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> In this case, the detector was placed at a distance of 31 M from the target. Spatial distribution of chemicals in 2-dimensions, based on CN and Na emissions were used to detect chloratite, dinitrotoluene (DNT), trinitrotoluene (TNT), cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) residues on aluminium and glass substrates and 100% success rate was claimed.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">As was the case in the analysis of metals (see Section 1), this review period produced several papers presenting fundamental studies of the processes occurring within LIBS plasmas. Delgado <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit77"><sup><span class="sup_ref">77</span></sup></a> presented a fundamental study on <span class="italic">coincidence ion-photon detection</span> of plasmas of high energy organic compounds, specifically TNT and DNT in a condensed phase irradiated with UV laser pulses. The authors described an advanced instrument for simultaneously monitoring the LIBS emission spectra and the ions formed in the plasma plume using laser ionization mass spectrometry (LIMS). The simultaneous measurement of the LIBS spectra and the LIMS spectra, described as optical-mass coincidental information was obtained from solid DNT and TNT samples. The formation and decay of atomic and molecular species, and rearrangement reactions were followed within the time scale of the plasma. Emission trends were correlated with the formation of atomic species (H, C, N, O), molecular ion species (<small><sup>24</sup></small>C<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>26</sup></small>CN<small><sup>+</sup></small>/C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>) and molecular bands (C<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CN). This indicated a correlation between time scales of the formation of these species and the energetics of the species, particularly of the ring-opening nitrotoluenes. The same group<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit78"><sup><span class="sup_ref">78</span></sup></a> has also undertaken a fundamental investigation into the vibrational emission of CN molecules (B<small><sup>2</sup></small>Σ–X<small><sup>2</sup></small>Σ band) occurring during LIBS of organic molecules. This band is one of the strongest emissions appearing in organic compounds when analysed by LIBS in an air atmosphere. The authors found that this emission was dependent on the molecular structure of the materials, on the time scale of the measurement and on the nature of the sample surface. They also found that alterations in the distribution of the emissions in terms of relative intensities were dependent on the molecular structure of every material investigated. In a further paper from this group, Serrano <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> employed LIBS together with <span class="italic">classification algorithms</span> (supervised learning classifiers) to facilitate the discrimination of explosives from the organic substrates and various interfering substances which are often present. The use of chemometric techniques in conjunction with a fundamental knowledge of the processes occurring within a plasma is likely to widen the applicability of LIBS in the future.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">De Lucia and Gottfried reported several important advances in last year's review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> and continued their important work on improving the understanding of the LIBS processes. They have reported the influence of <span class="italic">molecular structure on the plasma emission</span> of the explosive cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX) and organic polymers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> In this work, the emissions were studied in an argon atmosphere and the relationship between molecular structure and emission was established. The percentage of atomic species (C, H, N, O) and bond types (C–C, C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>C, C–N) were correlated with atomic and molecular emission intensities and decay rates. Time resolved spectra were acquired and decay rates were attributed to molecular structure of the analyte molecules. The authors reflected on the possibility that this could be used to improve the discrimination of explosives on organic substrates.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> have employed molecular emissions arising from the LIBS of organic molecules to compliment the elemental information gained during the analysis. In this case, molecular emissions in the mid IR to far IR spectra (4–12 μm) were obtained. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span> found that the LIBS molecular emissions in this region were closely correlated with their liquid phase FTIR spectra. Interestingly, this did show that intact molecules do survive the LIBS event. The combination of atomic and IR spectra may be another important technique in the advancement of LIBS for the classification of compounds.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Although preconcentration methods add a level of complexity and remove much of the ability for remote analysis, Fujiyama-Novak <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82</span></sup></a> employed a <span class="italic">preconcentration/separation system coupled to a micro-hollow glow discharge (MHGD) plasma detector</span> for the analysis of explosives. Separation eliminated air interferences and preconcentration yielded detection limits of less than 5 ppb for triacetate peroxide and dinitrotoluene. The authors claimed that the miniaturized system was field portable.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The boundaries between the different scientific disciplines are becoming increasingly fuzzy and nowhere is this more apparent than in the use of chemical analytical techniques for the determination of traditional biological parameters, including bacteria, for example through cell wall analysis.

Micro-SXRF was employed to obtain information on the distribution and concentration of multiple elements simultaneously. The biological mode of action of metal based anti-cancer drugs often involves interactions with specific target molecules and the redox potential of the environment often results in changes in the coordination sphere and/or the oxidation state of the metal of interest.

          <p class="otherpara">The determination of Hg presents multiple analytical challenges due to its volatility and propensity to stick to surfaces. A number of papers dealing with mercury determination appeared during this review period, mainly in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. Several of these are applications describing the large concentrations of Hg in a variety of samples which are of interest from the point of view of potential health effects but do not advance the analytical chemistry of Hg determination.

Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) and EDTA were investigated as complexation reagents. Ammonium pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate and ammonium persulfate were investigated as oxidizing agents. For each reagent, the time-dependent decrease in the Hg signal was measured. For untreated samples, up to 50% loss of signal over 15 minutes and around 75% loss after 40 minutes was observed, even when Hg was present as HgCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The addition of ammonium persulfate limited the loss to around 25% and EDTA resulted in no measurable loss of signal after 60 minutes.

The addition of the oxidant, DMSA yielded similar results to the EDTA.

Analysis was by both quadrupole ICP-MS with collision cell and sector field ICP-MS. In all cases, matrix matching was required, as simple matrix adjustment with HCl and HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> resulted in significantly elevated (up to 222%) recovery. Matrix adjustment with an optimized stabilization solution containing acetic acid (0.5% v/v), thiourea (0.01 M) and ascorbic acid (0.1 g L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) resulted in recoveries of between 92% and 110% and 7% RSD (<span class="italic">n</span> = 6) for a range of CRMs with concentrations between 1 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 10 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Recovery of 82% in spiked excipient material was reported. This was well within the required acceptance criteria.

          <span>As found in previous years, the majority of relevant papers in this section of the review concentrate on the <span class="italic">forensic analysis of gunshot residue</span> (GSR), where SEM–EDX is currently considered in court to be the most powerful tool [ASTM E1588-10]. A complimentary ion beam analysis (IBA) method using particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) together with elastic backscattering spectrometry (EBS) was described by Christopher <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> Four cartridges, known to generate characteristic particles containing heavy metals such as Pb, Ba and Sb, were discharged from a range of firearms. Residues from the hands of the shooter were collected using adhesive carbon tabs and analysed by SEM-EDX to locate and log the positions of individual particles. The tabs were then analysed in the ion beam and particles relocated using a combination of secondary electron images and PIXE maps generated using a 3.0 MeV photon beam at 1–4.5 μm spot sizes. Particles &lt;1 μm in size were not possible to relocate due to the spot size of the ion beam in use and the authors admitted that this would be a potential limitation of the technique due to the frequency of GSR particles of 1 μm or less collected from hands being substantial. Point analysis in the centre of each particle and spectral fitting of the PIXE and EBS spectra collected was used to determine the elemental concentrations. Due to the greater sampling depth of the ion beam relative to the SEM, approximations of particle size and thickness had a clear impact on the accuracy of PIXE quantification. The grouping behaviour of the different makes of ammunition was determined using multivariate analysis and this was successfully used as a discriminating feature. The same group also presented a paper discussing the <span class="italic">advantages of PIXE over</span> SEM-EDX for the analysis of gunshot residues from new generation heavy metal free cartridges, where the finger print elements Pb, Ba and Sb are absent.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> A range of cartridges were analysed by both techniques and comparison of the spectra showed PIXE to be much more sensitive at the mid-high energies than SEM-EDX allowing detection of additional trace metals. These addition metals were used to fingerprint residues of each cartridge. One example of forensic importance was the identification of traces of Hg coming from the mercury fulminate of the primer. The ion beam used also allowed the collection of particle induced gamma emission (PIGE) spectra, particularly useful for the analysis of B and Na where weak characteristic X-ray emission lines are generally difficult to detect and resolve at low levels. This further increased the ability of the technique to discriminate between the residues of different cartridges. It should be noted that the set up cost of an IBA accelerator is estimated around 1 million Euro, which would be prohibitively expensive for routine use. However, the author believes that for high profile cases IBA would be a valuable tool.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The determination of the <span class="italic">muzzle to target distance</span> is an important aspect of the investigation of firearm related crime as it can help determine the relative positions of the persons involved and allude to the shooters intent. Turillazzi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> reported the quantification of GSR from skin around a gunshot wound using ICP-OES as a means of estimating this distance. A total of 50 test shots were fired into pig skin targets from distances between 0.2 and 150 cm and a 10 cm radius of skin was excised from two opposite sides of the entry hole. Samples were freeze dried before digestion using 2 mL concentrated HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> in a sealed PTFE vessel at 120 °C for 8 h. The analytes of interest included Al, Ba, Cu, Pb, Sb, Sr and Zn and calibrations were performed using common aqueous stock solutions. Perhaps somewhat predictably, the concentration of analytes decreased with increasing muzzle to target distance. However, the technique enabled quantification of GSR at distances up to 150 cm compared with the traditional chemographic staining test limits of approximately 50 cm. The same correlation of Ba, Cu, Pb, Sb and Zn concentration as a function of shooting distance was determined by directly measuring GSR deposited on cloth using EDXRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> A polarized excitation source, with Mo secondary target, was collimated to a 1.5 cm analysis area and quantification was performed using fundamental parameters. The obvious benefits of this method are that it is non-destructive and without chemical treatment and therefore samples can be analysed repeatedly or used for further tests.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The forensic analysis of laser printed ink by XRF and plume laser excited atomic fluorescence (plume-LEAF) for the determination of ink origin and illicit overprinting was presented by Chu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> Four branded black toner samples were selected that are widely used and similar in composition. Text of various font sizes was printed onto standard copier paper for analysis. Elemental composition were determined by XRF using a handheld analyser, collecting spectra at three voltage ranges (&lt;19 KeV, 19–23 KeV and &gt;23 KeV) for a total of 90 seconds. The results indicated that for large printed areas the technique could discriminate between the inks. However, at small font sizes (&lt;20), the concentration of many of the characteristic elements, such as Fe and Zn, fell below the LOD. Multi-element pulse-LEAF analysis was performed on the same samples using a custom two-laser-pulse probe pioneered by the authors. Briefly, a Nd:YAG 355 nm laser pulse was focussed on to a 100 μm spot at the surface of the print, forming a plume. Seven microseconds later, the ablated plume was intercepted transversely by an ArF 193 nm laser pulse, vaporising the toner particles to produce analyte atoms. The trailing portion of the same laser pulse induced the analytes to fluoresce. Characteristic emissions were detected by an intensified charge-coupled device. The sensitivity of the technique was exceptional, the theoretical LOD for Sr 460.7 nm was claimed to be in the region of 180 attogram (180 × 10<small><sup>−18</sup></small> g) in the 620 pg of sample ablated, meaning fewer pulses were required, hence less sample destruction. Discrimination of the four toner samples was possible after only two pulses and identification using principle component analysis was 100% successful over 1870 replicates.</p>

The group investigated the effects of heating temperature (160–240 °C), reaction duration (0.5–4 h) and sample mass (0.25–1 g) on the completeness of extraction in both mixtures. Optimum conditions for both mixtures were established to be 1.5 h at 220 °C with a 0.5–1 g sample weight. A standard addition method for the determination of Pt and Rh in ACC by WDXRF has also been discussed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98"><sup><span class="sup_ref">98</span></sup></a> Samples were milled to a particle size of less than 200 μm and 1 g aliquots were spiked with aqueous solutions of K<small><sub>2</sub></small>PtCl<small><sub>4</sub></small> and RhCl<small><sub>3</sub></small>·4H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O prepared from chemically pure salts.

          <span>The determination of Cl in concrete is important because above certain concentrations it promotes depassivation and induces corrosion of the reinforcing steel. Chloride determination is well documented in many standard procedures, although the depth profiling of these techniques may be limited to &lt;0.5 mm.

        <h3 id="sect1274"><span class="b_heading">2.4. Nuclear materials</span></h3>
        <span>The analysis of nuclear materials has again proven to be an extremely popular topic. The papers discussed in this review have largely concentrated on the measurement of analytes in nuclear fuels and components of reactors. Those papers discussing the determination of radioactive contaminants in environmental samples have, in the main, been ignored. The exceptions to this are those that have analysed single particles or swipe samples or which have undertaken some type of nuclear safeguards/dating analysis. Similarly, those papers that have discussed instrumental developments have also been largely ignored. Instead, they will be reviewed in a sister publication.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> Given the potentially very hazardous nature of the sample types analysed, it is unsurprising that many of the techniques used have been capable of standoff or remote analysis.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Reviews are always a helpful addition to the literature because they summarize subject areas. One such publication was prepared by Kutschera<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a> who discussed, with the aid of 267 references, the applications of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) to environmental analysis. The review started with a map showing the locations of approximately 100 laboratories with this facility and went on to list the isotopes capable of measurement using the technique. Applications of AMS in several different compartments of the environment, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> lithosphere, cosmosphere, hydrosphere and cryosphere were summarized. The main area of interest to this review is where the author has discussed the use of AMS in the technosphere. Included in this section of the review was the analysis of man-made nuclides, half-life measurements, reaction studies for nuclear astrophysics, neutron dosimetry of the Hiroshima bomb and applications that involve nuclear safeguards. Potential future developments were also listed and these included the development of ways to decrease the sample size required, the decrease in size of the instrumentation and new methods for isobar suppression of negative ions. A review by Zheng <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a> discussed (with 289 refs) the key role of atomic spectrometry in radiation protection. The capabilities and characteristics of different techniques such as thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), AMS and ICP-MS were summarized and compared with non-atomic spectrometric techniques such as alpha spectrometry, gamma spectrometry and beta counting. Also discussed briefly, were the techniques of PIXE and synchrotron radiation XRF. A useful table summarising the detection limits for different isotopes using different techniques was also presented, along with the reference the work came from. The review went on to discuss papers that have reported work on different nuclear accidents, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Chernobyl, the JCO criticality incident, Fukushima <span class="italic">etc.</span> and also discussed the fallout from nuclear bomb tests, as well as the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. The review finished by predicting some future applications, with an emphasis on those involving the Fukushima nuclear incident.</p>

          <span id="sect1286"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.4.1. Applications using LIBS. </span>
          <span>There has been a large number of applications reported that have used LIBS to analyse nuclear materials. As discussed previously, this is because of the standoff capabilities of the technique enabling the analysts to avoid exposure to the harmful samples. Some of these papers have <span class="italic">analysed specific components of reactors</span>. Included in this number are two papers by Maurya <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used LIBS to analyse impurities on the surface of the flange and optical window of a tokamak.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122,123</span></sup></a> In both papers, the analytes were C, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Ni which were measured over the wavelength range of 200–500 nm. In addition, both papers undertook the analysis in an open atmosphere. The setup of the instrumentation required, including the Nd:YAG laser operating conditions, the optical arrangement, collection optics and detection device, were all discussed. The wall of the tokamak is made of stainless steel (SS316L), but a deposit is formed on it through erosion of the wall <span class="italic">via</span> the plasma-wall interaction. Using multiple laser shots on the same spot, these deposits were found to have the same composition as the wall. Although the signal intensity varied significantly between the first and the twelfth laser shot, the signal ratio between different analytes remained constant. The signal intensity differences between laser shots were attributed to the different hardness of the wall material and the deposits. A similar approach was taken by the research group in Dalian, China<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124,125</span></sup></a> who also used LIBS to obtain a depth profile of the plasma facing components (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> divertor tiles) of a tokamak. These authors also used a Nd:YAG laser, but operated at 1064 nm and collected spectra over the wavelength range 200–900 nm. Again, the experimental setup was discussed in detail. Clear differences between the original tile and “used” tiles were observed, with the used ones having a deposit on the surface that had elevated levels of D, Fe and Li. A study of the effect of pressure on the LIBS signal indicated an initial increase in intensity as pressure decreased, but the intensity then decreased as pressure decreased further. The authors concluded that LIBS could potentially be used to monitor changes in the depth of the deposition layer to see if the tiles need to be replaced. The first of the two papers also used polarization-resolved LIBS to enhance the resolution and sensitivity. Studies of the polarizer detection angle and the pressure were also undertaken.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Other studies that have reported <span class="italic">the use of LIBS for deposit characterization</span> include ones by Malaquias <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> Fantoni <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> and Xiao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> All of these papers are related, with many of the same authors appearing on each of them. The work was undertaken on tiles at the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). Another related study, by van der Meiden <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> used LIBS in a qualitative manner to measure the surface composition and the depth profile of tiles from ITER after plasma exposure. Laser induced desorption-quadrupole mass spectrometry and thermal desorption spectrometry were also utilized during the study. Also used was an advanced Thomson scattering system for electron density measurements and electron temperature profiles. The LIBS system used in this study appears quite basic in that the spectrometer has a spectral range of only 60 nm, but the light collection system was efficient, enabling more light to be collected compared with echelle spectrometers. Improvements to the system are anticipated. A further paper, by Paris <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> also used LIBS to monitor the erosion of coatings and changes to the surface structure on materials that had been exposed to nuclear plasma.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Other LIBS applications have focussed on <span class="italic">the analysis of fuels, coolants or waste products</span> rather than components. A paper by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> described a micro-LIBS system comprising a Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm, a microscope and an XY translation stage. The instrumental setup was described in detail and a schematic diagram provided. The laser beam was focussed on the sample through a microscope with a ×40 UV objective lens. The laser then formed the plasma on the sample and the light produced was transmitted through a fibre-optic, back through the microscope, to a spectrometer furnished with an intensified CCD detector. A further CCD was used with the microscope so that the focus of the laser spot could be monitored. The system was applied to the analysis of a nuclear waste molybdenum-rich glass-ceramic. Analysis of a 1.6 × 1.2 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small> area giving 160 × 120 laser firings took approximately one hour. Craters formed in the sample were examined using AFM and were less than 7 μm in diameter. The protocol was validated using LA-ICP-MS with NIST certified glass samples being used as calibrants. Analytical data obtained from the LIBS system were subjected to PCA to investigate the correlation of elements in the two phases of the glass-ceramic. A correlation between Ca, Mo, Sr and the REEs indicated their preferential incorporation into the calcium molybdate phase, whereas the anti-correlation between Al, Fe, Mo and Zr demonstrated their affinity for the glass phase.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">purity of liquid sodium coolant used in fast nuclear reactors</span> was assessed by Maury <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132</span></sup></a> Approximately 300 g of the liquid sodium was contained in a hermetic oven at 150 °C. The Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm, with a duration of 5 ns and a frequency of 20 Hz, was focussed though an optical window into the oven and light emitted from the resulting plasma was transmitted <span class="italic">via</span> the optical collection system and a fibre-optic to a Czerny–Turner spectrometer and an intensified CCD detector. The analytes chosen were In and Pb and calibration was achieved using the method of standard additions. Some problems associated with signal fluctuations and intensity drift were observed and these were associated with different pressures within the oven. However, these problems were largely overcome by using background subtraction and/or normalization. The authors described this process. The LOD obtained were 6 and 5 ppm for Pb and In respectively. The last paper in this sub-section to be discussed is by Barefield <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit133"><sup><span class="sup_ref">133</span></sup></a> who used LIBS to identify and assign complex atomic emission spectra from mixed actinide oxides such as uranium dioxide–plutonium dioxide and uranium dioxide–plutonium dioxide–americium dioxide–neptunium dioxide simulated fuel pellets. For the latter sample, over 800 atomic emission lines were identified. The Am, Pu and U wavelengths were consistent with those found in the literature. However, only a few of the Np lines could be identified with confidence. It was concluded that if the LIBS system had a resolving power of 20<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000, it was capable of determining analytes in a complex mixture of actinides.</p>

          <span>In general, environmental applications have been ignored during this review. However, nuclear forensics and safeguards studies have been included because they tend to be more than just simple applications. Safeguards are measures to ensure that no nuclear material is diverted from its intended peaceful use.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Certified reference materials and reference methods for nuclear safeguards and security is clearly an important subject and has been discussed by Jakopic <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit134"><sup><span class="sup_ref">134</span></sup></a> who reported that IRMM is currently replacing some of its exhausted stocks of CRMs with new ones and that some of the existing materials are being re-examined in an attempt to improve the uncertainties associated with their measurement. The authors described how most safeguards methods measure the ratios of major isotopes such as <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U or <small><sup>240</sup></small>Pu/<small><sup>239</sup></small>Pu but that work was in progress to also include some of the minor isotope ratios. Using <small><sup>238</sup></small>Pu/<small><sup>234</sup></small>U, <small><sup>239</sup></small>Pu/<small><sup>235</sup></small>U and <small><sup>240</sup></small>Pu/<small><sup>236</sup></small>U the age of NBS 946 was calculated to be 40.35, 40.43 and 40.48 years respectively. This meant that it had been separated in May 1970. In other work, TIMS was used to measure Pu isotopes in the materials IAEA 135 and IAEA 368. Mention was also made of the inter-laboratory comparisons REIMEP-17 and NUSIMEP-8 for measurements of U and Pu amount content and isotopic abundances in fissile material and environmental samples. Two papers from the Argonne facility have discussed the re-certification or analysis of a certified reference material.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135,136</span></sup></a> Kraiem <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">135</span></sup></a> re-certified the material CRM 125-A, an enriched uranium oxide pellet using three different types of TIMS measurements; namely TIMS with internal standardization, TIMS with total extraction and TIMS with modified total extraction. The total evaporation method gives excellent precision for major-based ratios, but minor isotope intensity measurements are biased because of peak tailing from the major isotopes. The modified total extraction method overcomes this problem by allowing measurement of backgrounds, internal yield calibration of the secondary electron multiplier detector, peak centring and ion beam focusing. It also enables internal mass bias correction by using the externally corrected <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U values to determine an appropriate correction value. Six pellets were analysed for the isotope ratios <small><sup>234</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U, <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U and <small><sup>236</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U, yielding results of 0.00039130(38), 0.042301(25) and 0.0000040754(47), respectively. No <small><sup>233</sup></small>U was observed and the results for all six pellets were concordant. The analytical uncertainties were significantly smaller than on the original certificate. The second paper, by Mathew <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> used the same approach for the depleted uranium assay standard CRM 115. Another paper by Mathew <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">137</span></sup></a> confirmed the finding that the total evaporation method yielded excellent ratios for major isotopes, but that peak tailing caused bias for minor ones.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers have discussed the measurement of different isotope ratios for safeguards purposes. Pointurier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit138"><sup><span class="sup_ref">138</span></sup></a> dated small amounts of uranium (sub-μg quantities) by determining <small><sup>230</sup></small>Th/<small><sup>234</sup></small>U. Their preferred method was to eliminate the matrix using the resin AG1 X8 in a hydrochloric acid medium because it diminished the possibility of contamination from reagents or the environment. The Th extraction efficiency was greater than 90%, the amount of <small><sup>230</sup></small>Th introduced was negligible and using ICP-MS as a detection technique, the LOD for Th was at the femtogram level. A similar approach was taken by Eppich <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit139"><sup><span class="sup_ref">139</span></sup></a> who dated uranium materials using the <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>231</sup></small>Pa chronometer. The <small><sup>231</sup></small>Pa was determined using a <small><sup>233</sup></small>Pa spike that had been prepared from a <small><sup>237</sup></small>Np source. The Pa prepared in this way was separated from the neptunium matrix using AG1 X8, with the neptunium matrix being eluted with HCl. The Pa was eluted from the resin using 2% nitric acid containing 25 μL of saturated boric acid. The Pa eluted was then retained on quartz wool, where it went through several cycles of elution/retention prior to finally being eluted using 2% nitric acid containing 0.005 M HF. The <small><sup>231</sup></small>Pa had to be separated from the uranium sample matrix using a similar protocol. Analysis was achieved using ID with a MC-ICP-MS instrument. The combined uncertainty for age dating using this methodology ranged from 1.5–3%, which was an improvement on that obtained using alpha spectrometry. The methodology was applied to the dating of five uranium standard materials with the ages calculated using <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>231</sup></small>Pa and <small><sup>234</sup></small>U/<small><sup>230</sup></small>Th being concordant for each.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Surface oxidation can disrupt the dating process since the chronology depends on the <small><sup>230</sup></small>Th being produced from the parent <small><sup>234</sup></small>U and any oxidation may disrupt the natural ratio.

The effects of <span class="italic">different etching procedures to</span> remove surface oxidation of a uranium sample were determined by Meyers <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit140"><sup><span class="sup_ref">140</span></sup></a> A robust etching technique produced the most reliable data whereas more mild conditions led to estimates in the radiological age that were between 15 and hundreds of years older than the known age.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Several papers were published that describe <span class="italic">the analysis of individual uranium or plutonium particles</span>. The group from Iberaki, Japan has produced three papers in this area during this review period, two analysing uranium particles<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141,142</span></sup></a> and one analysing plutonium particles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> In one paper, SIMS was used to analyse particles obtained through wiping from a nuclear facility.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> The certified materials U050, U350 and U500 with a <small><sup>235</sup></small>U content of 5.010, 35.190 and 49.696%, respectively, were used for alpha track detection and U350 was also used for mass bias correction for the SIMS analysis. For the alpha track detection, the particles were transferred from the wiping material onto silica wafers, covered with polycarbonate and then placed in contact with a CR-39 detector for a period of up to 28 days. The detectors were then removed, etched in 7 M NaOH at 70 °C for three hours and then the tracks counted using microscopy. For the SIMS analysis, a similar protocol was adopted, but once the particles had been encased with polycarbonate, they were placed on a glassy carbon planchet and ashed at a power of 300 W for 30 min. An oxygen primary beam with an energy of 15 keV was used to produce secondary ions of <small><sup>234</sup></small>U<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>235</sup></small>U<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>236</sup></small>U<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>238</sup></small>U<small><sup>+</sup></small> and <small><sup>238</sup></small>U<small><sup>1</sup></small>H<small><sup>+</sup></small> which were detected in peak jump mode. The combined alpha track – SIMS analysis was applied to three real samples. Using this combined approach, it was possible to measure significantly higher <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U (in the range 0.0072–0.25) than that with SIMS alone, indicating that samples with significantly higher <small><sup>235</sup></small>U than normal could be measured accurately. Both SIMS and solution nebulization ICP-MS were used for the analysis of uranium particles in the other paper.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">141</span></sup></a> This paper also used a micro-sampling technique and automated particle measurement. The results for <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U for automated particle measurement and ICP-MS were similar, but both were higher than those obtained using SIMS. For the plutonium paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">143</span></sup></a> particles as small as 1 μm were age-dated. The particles had been prepared from the reference material SRM-947 and then stored for 3.9 years since the last purification. After dissolution of the particles, the Am and Pu were separated using anion exchange chromatography and their isotopic ratio measured using high resolution ICP-MS. Precision and accuracy of the dating were both improved using a spike of <small><sup>243</sup></small>Am. The experimental results agreed well with the known age, with deviation being in the range 7 days–105 days and precision 0.16–0.5 years.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Another group that is working in this area is based in Arpajon, France. Pointurier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">144</span></sup></a> described the <span class="italic">use of LA-ICP-MS for the analysis of single, micron-sized uranium particles</span>. Results for <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U from this technique were compared with those obtained using SIMS and from fission track-TIMS. The results obtained were in good agreement between all of the methods, with the age determined by LA-ICP-MS deviating by no more than 3% from those calculated using the other techniques. Precision was less impressive for LA-ICP-MS (7%) compared with 4.5% for fission track TIMS and 3% for SIMS. A second paper by the same group<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">145</span></sup></a> reported the use of SIMS for the analysis of single micron-sized uranium particles for U isotopic ratios as well as for F. Both O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> and Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> were tested as primary ions, but the Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> source produced no discernible U signals. Therefore, the O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ions were used for all subsequent work. Normally, the IAEA recommendation is that samples are baked at 400 °C after deposition. The authors therefore undertook a study of the effects of heating and found that the <small><sup>238</sup></small>UF signal dropped to 12% of that in a non-heated sample and that for UF<small><sub>4</sub></small> it decreased by a factor of 30 if the sample was heated to 400 °C for 30 min. No baking was therefore used during this study. The results of the study enabled the authors to discriminate between uranium ore concentrate particles and particles coming from a conversion plant; something that U isotope ratios alone could not do. It was also established that no significant loss of F occurred even though the samples were simply stored in a plastic bag in the dark.</p>

        <span>The analysis of ceramics during this review period may be summarized by stating that there has been an increase in the number of papers published. More specifically, this increase has been in the area of archaeological/historical heritage-type samples. Reports of the analysis of other ceramics has diminished somewhat. Of the papers that have reported the analysis of ceramics, the use of solid sampling techniques has proven popular because ceramics are materials designed to function at high temperature and tend to have high measures of hardness. In addition, they also have substantial chemical resistance. These properties make them quite difficult to analyse because they do not readily dissolve without recourse to extreme acids, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> hydrofluoric or sulfuric at very elevated temperatures, and are also not readily fused into soluble forms.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">It has been known for years that <span class="italic">slurry introduction</span> offers several advantages, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the possibility of calibrating against aqueous standards, no necessity for the use of harsh chemicals or conditions for sample preparation <span class="italic">etc.</span> However, if certain precautions are not taken, slurry nebulization is a method that has the potential to obtain the wrong answers very rapidly. One of the most important factors is that of particle size. Nebulizer/spray chamber assemblies of ICP instrumentation will discriminate against particles that are too large and hence, these may never reach the plasma. A further complication is that the maximum particle size that can be transported to the plasma varies depending on the density of the material being analysed. The analysis of ceramics complicates things further because they are so resistant to heat. Even if a particle is transported as far as the plasma, there is a possibility that it may not be atomized completely, leading to an underestimate of concentration. Dispersants are normally required to minimize agglomeration of the particles. Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">153</span></sup></a> investigated the analysis of aluminium oxide presented as a slurry to an ICP-OES instrument. The effects of nebulizer gas flows, particle size and spray chamber geometry as well as the vaporization efficiency were all studied. Although there was some element of re-inventing the wheel, the paper did have some merits. Particles of size 7–10 μm could reach the plasma, but only those of 7 μm and below could be vaporized completely. Particles of 8 μm diameter had a vaporization efficiency of only 68% when the nebulizer gas flow was 0.8 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. A dispersant of 0.5% polyacrylate amine was used. Results obtained for the slurry nebulization of the material were in good agreement with those obtained after it had undergone a high temperature (230 °C), microwave dissolution using sulfuric acid. Analysis of NIST SRM 699 using both methods also yielded data in good agreement with certified values. The only strange thing about this paper was that the authors used an alumina mortar for the grinding of the samples prior to slurry preparation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Zhou <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">154</span></sup></a> used LA-ICP-MS to analyse <span class="italic">silicon carbide powders</span>.

An aliquot was then pressed into a disc for 30 s at 10 MPa and this was heated to 1000 °C for two hours using a five-step temperature program. The LA-ICP-MS operating conditions were optimized to give good sensitivity and stability. Glass reference materials (NIST SRMs 610, 612, 614 and 616) were used as calibrants and, by using <small><sup>29</sup></small>Si as an internal standard, correlation coefficients of the calibration curves ranged from 0.9981 to 0.9999. Precision was better than 5% RSD and LOD for B, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Sr and Ti were 0.02, 0.004, 0.04, 0.07, 0.01, 0.005, 0.02, 0.006 and 0.08 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> respectively. A comparison of data obtained using LA-ICP-MS with those from sample nebulization into ICP-OES following an acid dissolution involving sulfuric, hydrofluoric and nitric acids in an oven at 230 °C, were in good agreement. Analysis of the reference material BAM-S003 yielded results that were in reasonable agreement with certified values, although the Cu was only approximately 65% of the certified value. The accuracy of the digestion method was superior, but precision was similar between the different introduction systems. The LA-ICP-MS protocol was applied to the analysis of silicon carbide powders of different particle size.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another method for <span class="italic">solid sample introduction</span> was demonstrated by Hashimoto <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a> who used ETV-ICP-OES employing a tungsten boat furnace vaporizer to determine Cl in fine ceramics. Sample (approx. 12 mg) was weighed into a cuvette and 10 μL of 1.8% potassium hydroxide solution added as a modifier. The cuvette was then put on a hotplate at 110 °C for three minutes or until the solvent had evaporated. The cuvette was then placed in a tungsten boat furnace, heated at 75 °C to remove remaining solvent and then to 1800 °C over seven seconds and maintained at that temperature for three seconds for the volatilization to occur. Sample vapour was transported to the ICP instrument by a carrier gas comprising 35 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> hydrogen and 465 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> argon. The transient Cl signal obtained was monitored at 134.724 nm. Calibration was achieved by pipetting known Cl concentrations into the cuvette containing ceramic powder known not to contain Cl as a contaminant since it had been previously baked at 1800 °C. The LOD was 0.71 ng (0.59 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and precision for 10 replicate measurements was 3.2% RSD. The method was applied successfully to the analysis of the certified materials JCRM R004 and JCRM R006 silicon nitride powders and JCRM R022 and JCRM R023 silicon carbide powders.</p>

Samples were exposed to between one and six cycles each. The iron/manganese powder mix was replaced every cycle to ensure constant amounts of Mn. The alumina tiles were then examined using XRF, SEM-EDS, XRD and optical microscopy. A green film was produced on the tile and this was identified using XRD to be galaxite (MnO·Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>). The extent that the Mn penetrated the alumina was assessed using XRF and the authors concluded that after six consecutive cycles, huge amounts of Mn entered the alumina through the pores and penetrated throughout its entire width. There was no evidence of grain boundary migration.</p>

          <span>By far the most common topic within this subject area has been the analysis of ceramics of cultural heritage. As always with such precious samples, minimal damage should be inflicted. The most commonly used techniques are those that do no damage, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> assorted XRF techniques, or minimal damage, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LA or LIBS. Those papers that have reported more damaging protocols, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> fusions <span class="italic">etc.</span> will not be discussed in this section unless they offer something novel <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the use of <span class="italic">chemometrics on the analytical data</span>. It should be noted that the use of chemometric analysis of the data obtained from atomic spectrometric analysis has continued its gradual growth as increasing numbers of workers realize how useful it can be in classifying samples and hence elucidating provenance, possible trade routes, <span class="italic">etc.</span></span>
          <p class="otherpara">Since virtually all of the papers reporting the <span class="italic">analysis of cultural heritage samples</span> appear in archaeological journals, they are often a little sparse with analytical details. As such, they are best summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>. An exception to this is a paper prepared by Glaus <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">157</span></sup></a> who used a portable LA unit to sample objects in the field, collect the particles produced on filters and then either acid digest and analyse these filters off-line using multicollector ICP-MS, or undertake fast-scanning LA of the filters and analyse using ICP-MS on-line. Isotope ratio analysis of materials such as ceramics, a lead ore (galena) and the metallic lead standard NIST SRM 981 was undertaken. The LA – sample collection – digestion protocol with external standards enabled Pb isotope ratios of better than 0.1% parts per thousand for the Pb isotope standard to be obtained. This was sufficiently high to indicate that a small amount of isotopic fractioning occurred during the sampling procedure. The LA of the filter resulted in poorer precision compared with the dissolution/nebulization approach but, as the authors stated, it did allow a simple on-line procedure to be developed in which the LA plume from the filter was transported to both MC-ICP-MS and a standard quadrupole-based instrument simultaneously enabling isotopic analysis and elemental analysis, respectively. An overview paper that discussed the use of XRF for the differentiation between real and forged cultural heritage materials was prepared by Galli and Bonizzoni.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit158"><sup><span class="sup_ref">158</span></sup></a> Materials such as paintings (pigments) ceramics and metal objects were all discussed and case studies given. The authors emphasized the necessity to maintain the sample, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> to cause the absolute minimum amount of damage.</p>

        <span>The structure of this section of the review has been reorganized this year to provide a clearer focus on applications rather than technique. The literature received continues to reflect developments in the analysis of semiconductor wafers and including depth profiling of dopant elements, the creation and characterization of thin films and complex multi-layered materials intended primarily but not exclusively for use in electronic applications and an understandable continuing interest in solar cell devices. Applications to the characterization of electronic equipment and devices are also considered.</span>

          <p class="otherpara">As ever, <span class="italic">SIMS continues to dominate the literature</span> describing the characterization of semiconductor materials. Improving quantification remains a major theme of research work, partly because the calibration of responses from ultrathin films on the surface of substrates of entirely different composition is challenging. The use of ion sources operated at low energy has been studied for these important applications, and alternatives have also been evaluated. For example, an O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> probe has been used to obtain high resolution depth profiles from a Si–Ge type quantum well structure.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">159</span></sup></a> It was shown that when primary ion beam energies above 500 eV were used, depth profiles became unrepresentative. However below this threshold, quantification could be achieved, and it was reported that good agreement was obtained with data derived from TEM and X-ray techniques. An investigation of the use of low energy Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> and O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beams in the quantification of Ge in Si–Ge type materials has also been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit160"><sup><span class="sup_ref">160</span></sup></a> It was found that at beam energy of 250 eV, there was a significant change in Ge ion yield in comparison to the Si–Ge matrix, but that this was not observed when an O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam was used. However, it was noted that secondary ion intensities could still be used to achieve quantification with a Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam, as these correlated monotonically with Si–Ge composition. In a similar vein, a quantification model has been developed to perform calibration correction in the ultra-low energy SIMS determination of As implants in a silicon substrate.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">161</span></sup></a> The model took into account different sputtering regimes in SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and Si materials and corrected analyte response at the interface between the two. The SIMS results obtained were similar to those obtained from medium energy ion scattering (MEIS) which was considered to be an accurate method of depth profiling.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There is a continuing demand to <span class="italic">improve lateral resolution in the characterization of semiconductors</span>. These advantages have been claimed for a SIMS instrument that uses a high brightness He<small><sup>+</sup></small>/Ne<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion source.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> Usable ion yields in the range of 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small> to 3 × 10<small><sup>−2</sup></small> were obtained using O<small><sub>2</sub></small> or Cs flooding yields and LODs in the atomic % range were reported for semiconductor materials (Si, Ge, GaAs and InP) and metals (Al, Ni, W). Lateral resolutions as low as 10 nm were achieved for SIMS imaging when Ne<small><sup>+</sup></small> bombardment was used. Improvements in lateral resolution have also been achieved using a TOF-SIMS instrument. In this approach, Bi primary ion clusters were used to remove sample material to uncover buried object layers while maintaining lateral resolution in the sub 50 nm range to a depth of 20 mm. The system was applied to CRM and real world samples. In another novel, but not necessarily intuitive instrument development, an EDXRF device was incorporated within a Cameca SIMS ion system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">162</span></sup></a> The capability of the combined instrument to perform efficient quantitative analysis was demonstrated in application to thick Al<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Ga<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>N epitaxial layers and thin Si<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Ge<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> films.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">X-ray techniques offer particular advantages in the characterization of semiconductor materials because they are responsive to surface composition. However, there can be limitations in relation to sensitivity and/or quantification that can arise as a result of these properties. The ISO Technical Committee 201 Working Group 2 has investigated the use of <span class="italic">vapour phase treatment</span> to improve LODs in the trace metal analysis of silicon wafers by TXRF spectrometry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit163"><sup><span class="sup_ref">163</span></sup></a> It was found <span class="italic">via</span> round robin testing that this treatment improved TXRF intensity by 1.2 to 4.7 for samples intentionally contaminated with Fe and Ni at a level of 5 × 10<small><sup>9</sup></small> and 5 × 10<small><sup>10</sup></small> atoms cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> respectively. It is well established that TRXRF can be used in combination with a synchrotron radiation source to improve surface sensitivity for trace analysis of semiconductors materials. This technique has been applied in a micro-beam configuration to investigate the lateral distribution of 23 elements deposited on a silicon wafer surface for the purposes of calibration.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit164"><sup><span class="sup_ref">164</span></sup></a> It was reported that the temperature of the drying process used to deposit the calibration solution had an influence on the uniformity of elemental distributions and residual element morphology. The X-ray and SEM images obtained were used to improve the quality of statistical analysis with the aim of improving the quantification by TXRF and grazing incidence XRF which are surface sensitive.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Laser induced breakdown spectrometry continues to be used as a viable alternative approach for <span class="italic">depth profiling of silicon wafers</span>. In one study<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">165</span></sup></a> an Al thin film approximately 800 nm thick was deposited on a silicon substrate using a magnetron sputtering process. Depth profiling was carried out on samples with and without post-annealing at 300 °C and 610 °C in air in order to investigate Al diffusion. Sampling was carried out under atmospheric conditions using laser pulse energy of 16 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. This resulted in an ablation rate of 200 nm per pulse. The LIBS method was able to perform satisfactory depth profiling in wafers in comparison with an energy dispersive spectroscopy approach which had limited efficacy due to a lack of sensitivity. The LIBS technique was also used for the detection of a metal layer buried deep within a silicon material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">166</span></sup></a> An 800 nm fs laser was used for the dual purposes of micromachining precise holes within the semiconductor structure while at the same time measuring elemental content and profiles. Using a laser fluence of 1.4 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, drilling rates of 30 nm per pulse could be achieved using low intensity flat top beam profiles.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Advances in fabrication technologies have allowed the creation of complex functional nano-structures featuring multiple layers. This has necessitated the development of new analytical approaches that describe not just the chemical composition but also the physical distribution of elements of interest within the sample. Complex structures are challenging to analyse because there is, by definition, a lack of available reference materials. It is worth drawing attention therefore to a round robin exercise for the depth profiling of Mo/B<small><sub>4</sub></small>C–Si and Mo–Si multilayer nanostructures deposited on Si.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit167"><sup><span class="sup_ref">167</span></sup></a> Thus SIMS with TOF, and magnetic sector analysers, GD-OES and a TOF-low energy ions scattering quadrupole SIMS instrument were used in a technique comparison. The advantages and disadvantages of these approaches in terms of depth resolution and speed of analysis were critically assessed.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Secondary ion mass spectrometry remains the technique of choice for <span class="italic">characterization of multilayer materials</span>, but it is evident from the literature that depth resolution depends on the instrumental conditions employed. An appreciation of these effects is an essential prerequisite for accurate analysis. For example, an investigation has been made of the use of TOF-SIMS with a low energy (250 eV) sputter ion (O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>) and a high energy primary ion (30 keV Bi<small><sup>+</sup></small>) in depth profiling of delta doped B multilayers in silicon.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a> The intensity ratio of the first peak and the subsequent valley in B<small><sup>+</sup></small> depth profile for specific instrument conditions was used to evaluate depth resolution. It was found that sample damage correlated to the ratio of current density of sputter ion to primary ion, thereby affecting depth resolution. An isotopic comparative method has been described for the characterization of thick Si–Ge alloy films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> These materials ranged in composition from almost pure Si to pure Ge but only two isotopic reference samples were required for quantification. Using an Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small> ion beam negative secondary ion yields for both Si and Ge were found to be virtually consistent whereas the positive ion yield for Si decreased significantly. This observation allowed a matrix effect free method to be developed for the analysis of these alloys.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There has been renewed interest in <span class="italic">chemical processes for controlled erosion</span> in semiconductor manufacturing due to selectivity achieved by this means. For example, the process of reactive ion etching of silicon has been monitored using optical emission spectrometry online.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit170"><sup><span class="sup_ref">170</span></sup></a> The emission spectra of F at 703.8 nm and CS compounds at 257.6 nm were measured and found to change in intensity during etching. It was possible to correlate this fall in emission intensity with breakthrough of the passivation layer and to establish net silicon etch time. It was concluded that OES could be used in process optimization in mask generation. In an alternative approach to the study of materials etching, ICP-MS has been used to examine acid erosion of As, Ga and In substrates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit171"><sup><span class="sup_ref">171</span></sup></a> An instrument fitted with an octopole reaction cell in He was used to attenuate interferences arising from HCl and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> etchants. The low part per billion sensitivity achieved allowed the determination of As, Ga and In at an amount equivalent to a sub nm material layer.</p>

The current technique of choice for such applications appears to be LIBS which offers both rapid quantification and depth profiling capabilities. Matrix interference effects are a familiar problem in LIBS and a variety of approaches have been adopted to improve the reliability of the analysis. For example, there has been a particular interest in the influence of operational parameters on the analysis of CuIn<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Ga<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Se<small><sub>2</sub></small> (CIGS) thin films. In this context, a new method has been reported to compensate for non-linear calibration curves arising from high concentrations of constituent elements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> Line pairs were selected from 39 Cu, 10 In and 5 Ga emission lines that were least affected by instrumental conditions such as laser energy or spot size fluctuations. A new figure of merit was proposed to determine the precision of LIBS determinations, based on the standard deviation of the selected line intensity ratios divided by the slope of calibration curves. The method was reported to improve precision for the analysis of elements at concentrations at which the calibration response becomes non-linear due to self absorption. The influence of laser parameters on the response for the determination of CIGS elements has also been investigated. In one study, it was concluded that the LIBS signal intensity was significantly influenced by laser wavelength.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">173</span></sup></a> Sampling was carried out using Nd:YAG lasers operated at 532 and 1064 nm in air with 5 ns pulse and a spot diameter of 150 μm. It was found that the Ga content affected the LIBS signal when a laser wavelength of 1064 nm was used, whereas no such effect was found for the laser operated at 532 nm. This was attributed to differences in the absorption of photon energy by the film material. The latter conditions were found to be suitable for improving LIBS multi-shot precision and depth profiling performance at 88 nm resolution in a 1.89 μm CIGS layer, yielding results comparable to those obtained by SIMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a> In a further paper on the LIBS analysis of CIGS thin films, it was reported that the Ga/In elemental composition ratio observed using a laser at 1064 nm was independent of the plasma properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> However, in a related study by the same group, it was found that while the LIBS self absorption correction line ratio procedure delivered an improvement in precision, accurate Se determinations could not be achieved using this method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">Another approach to the <span class="italic">critical issue of calibration of LIBS response</span> by comparing CIGS bulk and thin film measurements has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> It was found that calibration results based on Ga(Ga + In) ratio obtained from this set of data were in agreement, demonstrating that pre-analysed bulk samples can provide a useful LIBS reference for the analysis of CIGS films. Classification methods based on linear correlation and artificial neural networks have been applied in the monitoring of solar cells by LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> The approach was used in the assessment of selective scribing of Cu–In–Se<small><sub>2</sub></small> cells in which the laser was used to remove material to reach the underlying film without damaging the bottom layer. Thus plasma emission was monitored using the classification methods in two spectral bandwidths. This procedure was demonstrated to permit control of the three processing steps in solar cell manufacture and it was considered that it offered the potential to be implemented as an on-line monitoring tool in a production environment.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The capability of X-ray techniques to provide non-destructive quantitative analysis has been exploited in the characterization of solar cell materials. <span class="italic">Grazing incidence XRF offers the possibility of depth profiling</span> by varying the angle of incidence of the primary radiation beam. This feature of the technique was exploited in the reference-free depth analysis of Ga and In in Cu(In,Ga)Se<small><sub>2</sub></small> absorber films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">179</span></sup></a> This was achieved by use of a monochromatic synchrotron radiation excitation source and modelling of calculated X-ray intensities fitted to fluorescence measurements. Results obtained demonstrated the viability of the approach to detect Ga double gradients in the materials. In a similar manner, quantification can also be achieved by determining relative sensitivity factors for particular applications. This approach has been adopted for the examination of CuInSe<small><sub>2</sub></small> and In<small><sub>2</sub></small>Se<small><sub>3</sub></small> solar cell high purity standard materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a> The depth of penetration of X-rays and electrons in EDS, Auger and XPS techniques was determined by calculation and <span class="italic">via</span> Monte Carlo simulations to achieve the correct relative sensitivity factors for films of &gt;0.5 μm. The data obtained, which will be useful to anyone considering such an approach for non-destructive analysis of such materials, were compared with published handbook information.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Mass spectrometry has also been applied extensively to <span class="italic">the characterization of thin film solar cell materials</span>. The elemental composition and depth profiling of CIGS thin films has been investigated by TOF-SIMS using a cluster ion technique.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit181"><sup><span class="sup_ref">181</span></sup></a> Changes in the depth dependent stoichiometry of Ga and In greatly affect solar cell efficiency. The detection of MCs<small><sup>+</sup></small> clusters was used for semi-quantitative analysis and to investigate the effect of stoichiometry on analyte species intensities. No matrix effects were observed for In and Ga using this approach. The results of bulk analysis by HR-ICP-MS were found to correlate with integrated GaCs<small><sup>+</sup></small> and InCs<small><sup>+</sup></small> SIMS intensities confirming the validity of the approach. The composition of ZnO buffer layers in CIGS with thicknesses below 100 nm was determined by SNMS and SIMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit182"><sup><span class="sup_ref">182</span></sup></a> In the former case, an evaluation algorithm was developed to overcome mass interferences from doubly charged ions and dimers for the quantification of depth profiles of Zn(O, S) layers.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Favourable reports have been published describing the application of GD-TOF-MS to the analysis of solar cell layers. For example, a radiofrequency GD-TOF-MS instrument has been applied to <span class="italic">depth profiling of a CdTe solar cell</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183</span></sup></a> The reported advantages of the technique included large area sampling (4 mm diameter) at moderate vacuum conditions and 3D analysis with lateral resolution at the sub μm level. The performance of the GD-TOF-MS system was compared with that of TOF-SIMS and in the main good agreement was obtained. A different GD-TOF-MS instrument was used in a separate study of depth profiling of As in Cd<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>Zn<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>S/CdTe solar cells.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit184"><sup><span class="sup_ref">184</span></sup></a> Good agreement was reported with those obtained by SIMS in this case also, suggesting that the technique has significant potential in applications of this type.</p>

          <span>The electronics industry is subject to the European <span class="italic">Restriction on Hazardous Substances</span> (RoHS) directive. This focuses on the use of six hazardous materials (Cd, Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small>, Hg, Pb, and two classes of polybrominated flame retardants) and the need to tackle the problem of recovery and recycling e-waste. Analytical methods with trace level sensitivity are required to support this environmental legislation and in consequence there has been a noticeable increase in the volume of work reporting investigations of atomic spectrometry to the analysis of waste electronic equipment. The type of samples examined included: the main components of computers and mobile phones such as printed or wired circuit boards, monitors, and lithium ion batteries. As might be expected, the value of many of these contributions lies primarily in the novelty of the application rather than development in technique or methodology.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">For example, the capability of LIBS to perform direct analysis of products has been used to assess <span class="italic">waste electronic and electrical equipment</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">185</span></sup></a> The results were interrogated using a chemometrics approach and this was used to assign the source of manufacture, identify counterfeit products and classify materials for recycling purposes.

The relationship of the source of origin and year of construction of the items was also investigated. It is gratifying to note that the concentrations of the elements of concern were higher the older the items were, suggesting that the environmental impact of electronic waste will become less of a problem going forward.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There has been a noticeable growth in reports concerning the characterization of the contents of <span class="italic">lithium ion batteries</span> as these products are now used globally in portable electronic devices.

        <h3 id="sect2326"><span class="b_heading">3.3. Glasses</span></h3>
        <span>The year under review saw continued interest in the <span class="italic">analysis of glasses</span>, but much of the published work demonstrated little that was new to such applications. In some cases, glass materials were used to demonstrate the analytical utility of a new technique, but in applications in which other perfectly satisfactory alternative methods already exist. Incremental development of existing sample preparation methods was also evident, and where these have some relevance for practical analysis they are summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>. This section is devoted to advances in the characterization of modern glasses. Application for the analysis of ancient glasses can be found in the cultural heritage section of the review.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Phosphate glasses offer potential as bioactive materials and have unique optical properties. The <span class="italic">characterization of polyphosphate glasses</span> is challenging because of the complexity of the material structure. A TOF-SIMS study of the surface chemistry of these materials has been reported which may assist with the development of these materials in these and other applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit191"><sup><span class="sup_ref">191</span></sup></a> Thus, Fe and Zn phosphate glasses have been studied and the patterns of phosphate ion fragments in negative ion SIMS examined. It was found that at higher masses fragments containing up to four P atoms were observed. It was reported that using SIMS ion intensities and related fragmentation patterns it was possible to discriminate between polyphosphates of different chain length. The <span class="italic">depth profiling of Na in silica glass</span> has been studied by TOF-SIMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192</span></sup></a> The measurements were carried out using a Bi primary ion and a buckminsterfullerene (C<small><sub>60</sub></small>) sputter ion beam. It was reported that the <small><sup>23</sup></small>Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> profile could be acquired successfully without optimizing operating conditions and that Na did not migrate during the sputtering process. The LOD obtained using this method was similar to that for the existing method of dynamic SIMS using a Cs primary ion beam.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">forensic analysis of glass</span> remains a current topic of research activity and reports of inter-laboratory trials may be of particular interest to those active in this field. An 18 laboratory comparative trial has been carried out using four tests designed to evaluate the performance of match criteria for the elemental composition of glasses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193</span></sup></a> The techniques used were μ-XRF, ICP-MS, LA-ICP-OES and LA-ICP-MS. It was reported that the application of these tests allowed the differentiation of glass samples manufactured in different locations or in separate production batches. In another inter-laboratory comparison involving 16 forensic science laboratories, the elemental composition of reference materials NIST SRM 612, NIST SRM 1831, float glass reference materials FGS 1, and FGS 2 Bundeskriminalamt Weisbaden were determined using μ-XRF, ICP-MS and LA-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit194"><sup><span class="sup_ref">194</span></sup></a> Unsurprisingly, the ICP-MS methods out performed μ-XRF and achieved relative precision of 5%, inter-laboratory reproducibility of 10%, and LODs in the range 0.03 to 9 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The reasons behind the observed inferior performance of μ-XRF might be explained in part by consideration of a tutorial article on the concepts of SNR, LOD and LOQ in forensic glass analysis using the technique.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit195"><sup><span class="sup_ref">195</span></sup></a> The use of Pb isotope ratios has been exploited in order to discriminate between common glass samples for forensic purposes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit196"><sup><span class="sup_ref">196</span></sup></a> A multi-collector ICP-MS system using laser ablation sample was shown to be able to distinguish the origin of glass fragments as small as 0.1 mg which is of considerable importance in criminal investigations where samples particle sizes are often below 1 mm. The use of <span class="italic">lead isotope ratios</span> for comparing glass objects for forensic purposes has also been evaluated using IRMS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit197"><sup><span class="sup_ref">197</span></sup></a> Thus 35 glass samples were analysed and five Pb isotope ratio pairs were measured. Principal components analysis of the IRMS data demonstrated that the <small><sup>208</sup></small>Pb/<small><sup>204</sup></small>Pb ratio gave the best results, generating the least number of false positives.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">One unusual application involved the application of 3D LA-ICP-MS to the investigation of the <span class="italic">weathering of glass</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit201"><sup><span class="sup_ref">201</span></sup></a> A multi-element mapping procedure was used to define laser drilling on a virtual grid on the sample surface.

High speed ICP-MS data acquisition (58 ms for 19 elements) was employed to monitor laser pulses. The system generated 50 2D depth maps which could subsequently be viewed as time lapse videos or as images of the sampled volume. The technique was successfully used to investigate causes of weathering of glasses.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Finally, new reports of the application <span class="italic">of LIBS to the analysis of glass</span> are worth mentioning. The study of line selection in the detection of U in glass matrices has been investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit202"><sup><span class="sup_ref">202</span></sup></a> Uranium exhibits a complex line rich spectrum making the determination by emission spectrometry problematic. The selection of appropriate analytical lines was examined in the context of spectral interferences from other elements, making use of the possibilities for temporally resolved spectral measurements. It was confirmed that detection limits in the part per million range could be achieved using LIBS with a medium resolution spectrometer. However, this performance should be considered in the context of the capabilities of existing techniques such as XRF. The determination of F is problematic using most atomic spectrometric techniques and any report of a new approach is of interest. Thus LIBS has been applied to the detection of F in glass ionomer cements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit203"><sup><span class="sup_ref">203</span></sup></a> Two double pulse LIBS devices were evaluated. It was found that the best sensitivity for F was achieved in a helium atmosphere. Using optimized gate widths, the LODs were reported in the range 1.18–0.47 wt%.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect2365"><span class="b_heading">3.4. Nano-structures</span></h3>
        <span>The use and diversity of use of <span class="italic">engineered nanoparticles</span> continues to increase. They have been used as drug delivery vehicles, magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents, catalysts, as nano-electronic components and in many other applications. Similarly, the methods of manufacture have also diversified, with laser ablation, electromagnetic cavitation, chemical reduction, chemical vapour deposition, sol gel and hydrothermal routes all finding use. In addition, there have also been reports of plants being used to produce particles. However, the purpose of this review is to report recent applications and advances in atomic spectroscopy and not to provide an overview of the whole subject of nanoparticles. Consequently, only those applications that report novel aspects of atomic spectroscopy will be discussed and those applications that report routine analysis of products will largely be ignored, irrespective of the novelty of manufacture or use.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">To summarize the analysis of nanoparticles during this review period, there has been an increase in the number of papers reporting the use of ICP-MS single particle analysis, field flow fractionation (FFF) or asymmetric flow FFF (A4F) coupled with ICP-MS to characterize materials. In addition, as well as the more theoretical and proof of concept studies reported previously, this review period has also seen reports of these techniques being used for real <span class="italic">in vivo</span> or biological applications. For some years now, there has been concern among the toxicology community that any adverse effects in organisms that had been ascribed to nanoparticles may, in fact, arise through ions formed through the partial dissolution of the said nanoparticles. There have been studies reported during this review period that have attempted to address these concerns. The applications that have reported these techniques, along with other novel ones will be discussed in more detail below.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">There have been three <span class="italic">reviews or overviews of the analysis of nanoparticles</span> during this review period. The first, by Bustos <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit204"><sup><span class="sup_ref">204</span></sup></a> concentrated on the use of different types of mass spectrometry as a means of characterizing nanoparticles. It contained 40 references and discussed both molecular and elemental mass spectrometry along with coupling with an assortment of separation techniques. Applications of particle sizing and size distribution analysis were also given. A review by Adams and Barbante<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit205"><sup><span class="sup_ref">205</span></sup></a> containing 39 references overviewed the recent developments and trends whilst also providing some potential future directions.

          <span id="sect2381"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.4.1. Field flow fractionation and associated techniques. </span>
          <span>One of the main ways of characterizing nanoparticles is through the use of various types of field flow fractionation (FFF), including asymmetric flow field flow fractionation (A4F). This is because other techniques, such as dynamic light scattering, provide information on the size distribution of the materials, but do not yield any useful information on their chemical composition. However, FFF offers size distribution analysis and, when coupled on-line with an atomic spectrometric detector (usually ICP-MS for greater sensitivity), chemical composition analysis. Several papers have been published discussing these techniques and these will be reviewed here.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Bednar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit207"><sup><span class="sup_ref">207</span></sup></a> compared the coupling of FFF (both symmetric and asymmetric) with numerous detection systems including UV, dynamic light scattering and ICP-AES and ICP-MS. The different systems were used to <span class="italic">characterize gold and silver nanoparticles as well as carboxylated quantum dots</span> containing Cd, Se and Zn. A helpful table of operating conditions for the FFF separations was given as well as the instrumental operating conditions for the detectors. A table of LOD was provided which showed that ICP-MS tended to be at least an order of magnitude superior to the other techniques for the Ag, Au and Cd, but was only 2–5 times superior for the other analytes. Detection of S during the analysis of the silver nanoparticles enabled an estimation of the environmental aging of the particles since it was a direct measure of the state of the sulfide coating. A paper by Geiss <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit208"><sup><span class="sup_ref">208</span></sup></a> used A4F coupled on-line with both UV and ICP-MS to characterize citrate-stabilized Ag nanoparticles in aqueous matrices. The A4F separation of commercially available silver nanoparticles of known size was optimized in terms of the liquid carrier composition (ultrapure water adjusted to pH 9.2 using 0.1 M NaOH) and the cross flow rate. A regenerated cellulose membrane was used for the analysis and these were stable for approximately 50 injections before separation efficiency was compromised. On exiting the UV detector, the nanoparticle solutions were acidified with 5% HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and then mixed with a Rh internal standard solution prior to detection using ICP-MS. The LOD for UV and ICP-MS were similar for all nanoparticle sizes except for those of 100 nm, where the ICP-MS had a LOD of 6.7 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> compared with the UV one of 33 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Meermann <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit209"><sup><span class="sup_ref">209</span></sup></a> also used <span class="italic">A4F coupled on-line with ICP-MS to characterize silver nanoparticles</span>. A good baseline separation was achieved using nanoparticles of 30 ± 2.1 nm, 60 ± 5.2 nm and 75 ± 3.9 nm as size calibrants. Gold nanoparticles of a certified size were also used to validate the size separation. A linear relationship between size and elution time (<span class="italic">r</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 0.987) was obtained. These authors developed “post-channel species-unspecific on-line isotope dilution” methodology. Effluent from the A4F system was mixed on-line with a constant flow of enriched <small><sup>107</sup></small>Ag and a change in isotopic abundance could be detected when the natural isotopic abundance Ag nanoparticles mixed with it. The fractograms produced were essentially a plot of time (and hence mass) against <small><sup>109</sup></small>Ag/<small><sup>107</sup></small>Ag. Validation of this on-line ID approach was achieved by off-line fraction collection followed by Ag determination. A bias of between 2.9 and 16.4% was observed for both approaches, indicating that the on-line methodology was working adequately. The LOD was 1.6 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. A third paper to use A4F-UV-ICP-MS to characterize silver nanoparticles was prepared by Bolea <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit210"><sup><span class="sup_ref">210</span></sup></a> These authors discriminated between Ag ions and nanoparticles in culture media and human hepatoma cells used in cytotoxicity tests. The UV provided information on the nature of the eluted species (organic or nanoparticle) whereas the Ag was monitored by the ICP-MS instrument. The cells were first treated using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) and Triton X-100 which released the Ag species ready for analysis. Fractions collected from the A4F instrument also underwent analysis using TEM which confirmed the results. After 24 hours, a shift in particle size was observed for the nanoparticles in the culture medium. The authors attributed this to a protein corona effect. Silver ions in the culture medium were also detected and this was described as a consequence of nanoparticle oxidation. Unsurprisingly, 16 times the mass of Ag as nanoparticles was required to show the same toxicity as Ag ions.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The technique of A4F-ICP-MS has also been applied to <span class="italic">other nanoparticle types</span>. Regelink <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> used the combined technology to characterize iron (hydr)oxide nanoparticles in soil extracts. These authors used a high resolution ICP-MS instrument to detect the iron nanoparticles with particle size range between 1 and 150 nm coming from three different horizons of a podzol. Since these nanoparticles are natural rather than engineered, this paper will not be discussed further. However, it does demonstrate how the technique can be used for real-life applications rather than just laboratory-made situations.</p>

          <span id="sect2410"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.4.2. Single particle analysis. </span>
          <span>Single particle (SP)-ICP-MS is a subject that has become very popular over the last few years. The general consensus has been that time resolved analysis using a short dwell time is required to undertake it successfully. Each particle will be observed as a single pulse and the height of the pulse will be proportional to the particle size. However, questions still remain as to whether the “larger” particles are actually two, or more, smaller ones reaching the detector simultaneously. Many authors have attempted to circumvent this problem by using very dilute solutions of nanoparticles. Other problems that arise include signals produced by random electronic noise. Several papers have been published that proposed methods for overcoming some of these problems. A paper by Laborda <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit212"><sup><span class="sup_ref">212</span></sup></a> attempted to address some of these concerns. This paper presented the equations that are the fundamental basis of SP-ICP-MS and then went on to describe the equations used to distinguish real nanoparticles from background noise. Similarly, equations used to calculate LOD, both in terms of size and mass were also described. The experimental work demonstrated the probabilities of detecting more than one nanoparticle simultaneously as a function of nanoparticle flux and of dwell time. Uncertainty measurements of the number density (5%) and of the nanoparticle diameters (3–10%, depending on particle size) were also calculated. It was concluded that reliable average number concentrations and sizes could be obtained although a warning was issued regarding a broadening effect caused by the measurement process</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Cornelis and Hassellov<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit213"><sup><span class="sup_ref">213</span></sup></a> discussed a <span class="italic">signal deconvolution approach to discriminate smaller nanoparticles from ions</span> using SP-ICP-MS. Gold nanoparticles with nominal diameters of 10, 15 and 30 nm were used during the study as well as Au ions. The deconvolution protocol was summarized in a useful figure which takes the reader through the numerous steps required. The paper does, however, go into the detail in the text, where all of the relevant equations required for the calculations are given. In summary, Au ions were parameterized as a function of concentration using a mixed polygaussian probability mass function. The curves were then fitted to the lower intensity signals of samples containing nanoparticles so that the “dissolved” signal could be subtracted from the total signal. The accuracy of the deconvolution process was confirmed by independent analysis of samples using TEM. The final paper to be discussed in this section was prepared by Ho <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a> These authors used gold nanoparticles of 80, 100, 150 and 200 nm and used SP-ICP-MS to obtain a calibration curve of signal against concentration for each of the particle sizes. Linear calibration was observed for all particle diameters, but the slope decreased with increasing diameter. This was attributed to incomplete vaporization of the particles and to a different diffusion of the ions formed. Such phenomena would, of course, have ramifications for all nanoparticle research. The authors developed a computer simulation that takes these parameters into account. Calibration curves generated by the simulator also curved at high mass. However, the sampling depth from the plasma was found to be fundamental to the complete vaporization of the particles. The authors produced an equation that enabled them to determine the optimal sampling position. It was proposed that the equation could be used for particulates produced by LA as well as for engineered nanoparticles.</p>

One by Walczak <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit215"><sup><span class="sup_ref">215</span></sup></a> used SP-ICP-MS along with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and SEM-EDX to determine the behaviour of 60 nm silver nanoparticles and ions in an <span class="italic">in vitro</span> human gastrointestinal digestion model. The techniques were employed after the nanoparticles had been exposed to saliva, gastric and intestinal digestion. The number of particles observed decreased markedly after the gastric digestion, but increased again after the intestine. This phenomenon was investigated using SEM-EDX and was found to originate through clustering of the particles and subsequent re-dispersion. The process was attributed to the presence of protein, although the larger agglomerates also contained significant amounts of Cl. More importantly still, Ag ions (introduced as silver nitrate) also formed nanoparticles in the presence of proteins. These nanoparticles, of diameter 20–30 nm, were composed of Ag, Cl and S. A paper by Gray <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit216"><sup><span class="sup_ref">216</span></sup></a> used TMAH to extract Ag and Au nanoparticles from tissues originating from beef, Daphnia Magna (a species of freshwater water flea) and Lumbriculus variegatus (a species of worm).

The Daphnia were exposed to 98 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of 100 nm Au particles and 4.8 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of 100 nm Ag particles. Although the body burdens varied significantly (Au was 613 ± 230 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and Ag was 59 ± 52 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) the particle size distribution of the extracted particles was the same as that found in the exposure media, indicating minimal transformation within the organism. The mass and number-based recovery of spiked nanoparticles for all tissue types ranged between 83 and 121%.

The sedimentation FFF provided better resolution of the particles size distribution compared with dynamic light scattering. The authors stated that work was on-going and that their intention was to couple the FFF system with the SP-ICP-MS on-line. This paper also led the reader through the theory of SP-ICP-MS and of sedimentation FFF, providing the necessary equations for both. A real-life scenario was reported by Coleman <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit219"><sup><span class="sup_ref">219</span></sup></a> who studied the impact, bioaccumulation, tissue distribution, uptake and depuration of silver nanoparticles on the sediment dwelling invertebrate Lumbriculus variegatus. Uncoated Ag nanoparticles of different size (30, 80 and 1500 nm) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) coated nanoparticles were used in the study. Both FFF-ICP-MS and SP-ICP-MS were used. The uncoated nanoparticles were found to agglomerate and the rate at which they did was dependent on the conductivity. However, the coated particles were only minimally agglomerated.

The success of this extraction approach was proved by comparing the particle size distribution in the solution used to spike the meat and the digests. The size determination using A4F was hampered because the Ag nanoparticles eluted very early. However, using SP-ICP-MS of fractions collected from the A4F proved more successful.</span>

Light collected from the plume was focussed using two lenses onto a fibre-optic which then transmitted the light to a Czerny–Turner spectrometer equipped with a 1200 line mm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> blazed grating and with an intensified CCD detector that was synchronized with the Q-switch of the laser. This detection configuration was capable of detecting wavelengths over the range 285–315 nm with a resolution of approximately 0.15 nm. The translation stage moved 100 μm after each laser shot and so a mapping of the kidney section could be achieved. Analytes such as Gd, Si, Ca and Fe were determined. The authors attempted a quantitative approach as well as qualitative. To quantify the Gd, 5 μL droplets containing different concentrations of the same Gd nanoparticles used for the intravenous injection were placed on polyethylene substrate, dried and then analysed using the LIBS system. Overall, the Gd concentrations found were in good agreement with those determined using ICP-OES. The Gd nanoparticles were found at highest concentration in the renal cortex (3.5 mM), decreasing to 0.2 mM in the renal medulla, indicating that the kidney was at least partially successful in removing the nanoparticles from the blood system.</span>

          <p class="otherpara">There has been uncertainty for some years now that the <span class="italic">toxicological effects observed using some nanoparticulates may arise through their dissolution</span> and hence actually be caused by the individual ions.

Several studies published during this review period have attempted to differentiate between ions and nanoparticles.

The <small><sup>68</sup></small>Zn was then determined in digests of the snail using high precision multiple collector ICP-MS. The nanoparticles initially underwent aggregation but then up to 60% dissolved within 12 days. The bulk and the ionic Zn were far more bioavailable than the nanoparticulate. However, once dissolution had been corrected for, the uptake rate constants for ionic and nanoparticle Zn were very similar (0.074 L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> day<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 0.070 L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> day<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively).

The magnetic nanoparticles could preconcentrate the Ag nanoparticles by a factor of up to 250 with a recovery of &gt;99% under ideal, laboratory conditions. After separation of the magnetic nanoparticles from the sample solution (the flow cell was described) and digestion of the magnetic nanoparticles (again, this was described), analysis was achieved using ICP-MS. Spiking of real waters (tap, fresh and saline) yielded recoveries of better than 97%. The system worked for 75 nm diameter Ag nanoparticles coated with PVP or with citrate with both types showing full retention within 30 minutes.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The final paper to be discussed in this section was prepared by Fabricius <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit229"><sup><span class="sup_ref">229</span></sup></a> These authors used a number of different nanoparticle types (Ag, TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, ZnO and Au) with two different sizes. The <span class="italic">particle size distributions were all characterized using DLS and nanoparticle tracking analysis</span> and, where agglomeration was observed, ultrasonic homogenization was employed. The total elemental analysis of the nanoparticle suspensions was undertaken using ICP-MS (comparing microwave assisted acid digestion, acidification and direct aspiration of suspensions) and gravimetry. In general, the microwave digestion and acidification yielded similar data, with the direct aspiration yielding lower concentrations and usually with a much poorer precision. Since the Au results for the ICP-MS and gravimetry differed, GFAAS was also employed and these results were in agreement with those obtained using ICP-MS. Six methods to determine the dissolved fraction were then compared. These methods included ultrafiltration, dialysis, ion selective electrode, cloud point extraction, centrifugation and tangential flow filtration. Results indicated that dialysis and cloud point extraction were inappropriate for these measurements whereas the others could be used, although they all had limitations. Overall, in terms of precision, time taken and applicability, the authors recommended microwave digestion and ultrafiltration to determine “total” and “dissolved” concentrations.</p>

All three techniques had positive aspects, with the ultrafiltration being the most simple (but also providing data with the worst precision), the SP-ICP-MS providing significant data in the shortest time, but being valid only over a very short range of concentration and the ion exchange providing the best LOD and having a long linear working range but at the cost of largest volume of sample use and being time-consuming.

One by Motellier <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit231"><sup><span class="sup_ref">231</span></sup></a> described the direct quantification of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles in aqueous suspensions and concluded that it was perfectly viable as long as certain precautions were taken. One of these precautions included the binding of the deposited material on the substrate to maintain its homogeneity. A test using Ti ions and two types of Ti-based nanoparticles demonstrated that the linear regressions obtained using the ions were similar at the beginning and at the end of four months, but that those obtained using the nanoparticles were very different. It was hypothesized that this may be because of capillary action, gravity (they were stored vertically), or possibly even physical loss of the larger particles that may not have been sufficiently embedded in the adhesive. The operating conditions for the benchtop TXRF instrument used were optimized over a range of angles covering 0–2°. The Ti signal increased up to 0.2°, but then halved rapidly and then remained constant. The Cr signal from the internal standard decreased until 0.3° and then began to rise again. The optimal angle was therefore 0.2° since both the analyte and the internal standard signals did not change radically. Limits of detection of 18 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 54 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were obtained using incidence angles of 0.2° and 0.75°, respectively.

Two different LIBS configurations were tested. One configuration was very simple and enabled LIBS data to be collected even for small volumes of sample. However, there were problems with the shock wave causing the sample to splash over the collection optics. The other configuration was more complex but was more suitable for bulk samples such as those found during preparation of the nanoparticles. The use of an aluminium target in the sample increased the LIBS signal significantly and negated the requirement for double pulse LIBS. It was noted that the LIBS signal did not manifest itself as the traditional emission peaks. Instead, the nanoparticle dispersions absorb some of the continuum emission <span class="italic">via</span> the inverse Bremstrahlung effect leading to dips in the LIBS spectrum.</p>

The third paper, by Yu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit236"><sup><span class="sup_ref">236</span></sup></a> (written in Chinese), used LIBS along with a support vector machine algorithm to identify 11 kinds of plastic. Some samples were used to “train” the algorithm and the remaining samples were used as a test set. In total, 543 of the 550 test samples analysed were identified correctly. Most of the incorrectly identified plastics were polyurethane which was misidentified as polymethylmethacrylate. The misidentification was attributed to the N line at 746.87 nm and the CN molecule at 388.3 nm not being measured with sufficient accuracy because of the influence of ambient air.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Other techniques have also been used to identify plastics. <span class="italic">Pulsed glow discharge (GD)-TOF-MS</span> was used by de Vega <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit239"><sup><span class="sup_ref">239</span></sup></a> to identify polymer coatings. A comparison of two Grimm-type designs was made, one of which was made in-house (a brief description was given) and the other was based on a commercial design. Operating conditions for both units were optimized and were similar, with the power being 15 W for both. The argon gas pressure was 150 Pa for the in-house design and 200 Pa for the commercial one. These soft settings were ideal for minimizing the thermal decomposition of the samples. The commercial design gave a greater sensitivity and was richer in polyatomic information. This polyatomic information came from molecules from the sample rather than recombination-based interferences. The improvement in sensitivity compared with the in-house design was attributed to a higher distance between the sample and the MS interface. The design of the interface was also responsible for the formation of the polyatomic ions. The use of an argon pre-chamber to prevent the ingress of air (which may otherwise cause interferences) was also a feature. Four polymers (polyaniline, polyphenylene sulfide, polypyrrole and polythiophene) were examined. All four materials contain only C, H and either N or S. Despite this, it was possible to identify polyatomic ions that originated from the monomer of the materials and hence it was possible to distinguish between them. The authors claimed that it was a “notorious step forward” in the identification of polymers using GD technology. Other advantages of the technique are that no sample preparation is required and an analysis time of less than five minutes was required per sample.</p>

          <span>Metal/metalloid contamination of food from food packaging materials has proven to be an area of interest over this review period. Two papers have studied the migration of Sb from PET into food simulants.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit240"><sup><span class="sup_ref">240,241</span></sup></a> In one,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit240"><sup><span class="sup_ref">240</span></sup></a> both aqueous-based simulants (distilled water, 3% acetic acid and 10% and 20% ethanol) and a fatty food simulant (vegetable oil) as well as vinegar, were studied. The test conditions conformed to the recent EU regulation 10/2011. The Sb was determined using either ICP-MS or HG-AFS, with the operating conditions for both being given. The concentrations in the leachate (between 0.5 and 1.2 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) were well below the maximum permissible concentration of 40 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The total Sb in the plastics was determined using ICP-MS after microwave assisted digestion of the materials. Methodology was validated by the successful analysis of NIST SRM 1640, a natural river water. On its own, this study would not have been terribly interesting. However, the authors undertook a speciation analysis of the Sb in the leachates. A Hamilton PRP X-100 anion exchange column was used with a mobile phase of 5 mM EDTA and phthalic acid at a pH of 3.5 and with a flow rate of 1.5 mL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The HPLC-ICP-MS identified only one species in the aqueous simulants and this was Sb<small><sup>v</sup></small>. However, in the wine vinegar, a second species was observed corresponding to an Sb–acetate complex. The authors reported some confusion as to the reason for the presence of Sb<small><sup>v</sup></small>. During original preparation of the PET, Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> is used as a catalyst. It is unclear if it becomes oxidized during the preparation, during the leaching into foodstuffs or during the actual analysis</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Another paper to report the <span class="italic">leaching of Sb from PET trays into food and food simulants</span> was prepared by Haldimann <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit241"><sup><span class="sup_ref">241</span></sup></a> Total Sb in the material was determined using a microwave digestion protocol prior to ICP-MS detection. Since no PET CRM was available, the authors resorted to validation using a polyethylene CRM (ERM CE680k) with a certified Sb content of 10.1 ± 1.6 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. An alternative XRF method was also used. Here, the PET was ground cryogenically in the presence of liquid nitrogen. Particles of the material of less than 0.50 mm diameter were then used as a base onto which differing amounts of Sb<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> was added to form a calibration series. The mixtures were then pelletized prior to XRF analysis. Acetic acid (3%) was used as the food simulant medium over a temperature range of 20–150 °C and at a nitrogen pressure of between 50 and 90 bar to prevent boiling. The Sb leached into the acetic acid was determined using ICP-MS and the results used to construct a linear Arrhenius plot so that diffusion coefficients could be calculated. An isotope dilution analysis of food samples was also undertaken in which isotopically enriched <small><sup>123</sup></small>Sb (98.6%) was spiked into the foodstuffs prior to SF-ICP-MS analysis.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two other papers have reported the <span class="italic">determination of numerous metals from food packaging materials</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit242"><sup><span class="sup_ref">242,243</span></sup></a> In the former, Kiyataka <span class="italic">et al.</span> also used 3% acetic acid as a food simulant as well as yoghurt to determine the leaching rates of As, Cd, Hg and Pb from high density polyethylene. The plastic and the yoghurt were digested using a high pressure ashing device prior to ICP-OES analysis. Although the plastic contained a significant amount of Pb (462.3 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), the level in the yoghurt after a 45 day exposure at 4 °C was still below LOQ. Leaching into the acetic acid was also minimal, with concentrations of As, Cd and Hg being 10, 5 and 5 μg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, respectively. Accuracy, precision, linearity, LOD and LOQ were all assessed. The second of the two papers, by Whitt <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit243"><sup><span class="sup_ref">243</span></sup></a> used ICP-OES to survey Cd, Cr, Ni, Pb and Sb contamination in PET that had been made using recycled plastic flake that had potentially been in contact with electronic waste. Of 200 samples analysed, 29 were contaminated, although the average concentrations in these 29 samples were well below the threshold levels set by California's “Toxics in Packaging Prevention Act” of 2006.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two papers reported the <span class="italic">determination of Ag (both ionic and nanoparticulate) from food packaging materials</span>. von Goetz <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit244"><sup><span class="sup_ref">244</span></sup></a> used water, 10% ethanol, 3% acetic acid and olive oil as food simulants and ICP-MS as a means of detection. The highest migration of Ag occurred for the acid with 30 ng cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> being released at 20 °C over 10 days. However, when re-used, the migration rate dropped by a factor of 10, meaning that even after three cycles of use/re-use, a maximum Ag content of 34 ng cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> was obtained. Of the Ag released, 88% was ionic and 12% particulate. A similar study by Echegoyen and Nerin<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a> used ICP-MS and SEM-EDX to detect Ag in different food simulants and after different exposure times. Their Ag migration values ranged from 1.66 to 31.46 ng cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, which were lower than permissible levels.</p>

          <span>Two papers have made <span class="italic">use of continuum source GFAAS</span> to determine analytes in plastics.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit246"><sup><span class="sup_ref">246,247</span></sup></a> In the former, by Florez and Resano, Br was determined by a solid sampling technique that simply cut the plastic materials with a ceramic knife and then placed them on a sampling platform along with palladium nitrate solution and calcium carbonate solution; the absolute amount of both had been optimized; and then the platform was placed in the furnace and analysed using an optimized temperature program. The Br was measured as the molecule CaBr over the wavelength range 624.948 nm to 625.678 nm. Calibration was against aqueous standards that also had palladium solution and calcium carbonate added during the analysis. The wavelength range interrogated enabled four different lines to be monitored yielding different linear ranges and LOD. The most sensitive line was at 625.315 nm, and this had a linear range up to 300 ng and an absolute LOD of 5.4 ng. The absolute LOD could be improved three-fold by combining the signal of all four wavelengths. Precision was better than 7% and the method was validated by the analysis of six CRMs. The latter paper,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit247"><sup><span class="sup_ref">247</span></sup></a> by Duarte <span class="italic">et al.</span> also used a solid sampling approach. The samples of electronic waste (mobile phones, remote controls, computer keyboards <span class="italic">etc.</span>) were first milled in the presence of liquid nitrogen to reduce particle size, dried and then weighed onto sampling platforms for analysis. A palladium–magnesium nitrate modifier was used along with some Triton X-100 to decrease surface tension so as to allow the modifier to cover the sample better. The optimized temperature program enabled LOD of 0.06 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> to be obtained for both Cr and Sb. The value for Cr was higher than many others reported in the literature. The authors attributed this to having an argon flow during the atomization stage. This was done deliberately to reduce the sensitivity because the samples contained so much Cr. The procedure was validated by the successful analysis of the certified material ERM-EC 681K. Precision was between 4 and 13% for Cr and between 4 and 10% for Sb.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Another application that <span class="italic">used solid sampling GFAAS</span> was presented by Rodrigues <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit248"><sup><span class="sup_ref">248</span></sup></a> who determined Fe, Mg, Mn and Na in polymeric diphenylmethane dianiline, a raw material for polyurethane production. Sample of mass between 0.5 and 35 mg was used and calibration was against aqueous standards. Precision (where <span class="italic">n</span> was between 14 and 23) was better than 15% which, although high, is common with solid sampling GFAAS protocols. Method validation was achieved using alternative techniques. A microwave assisted digestion and a microwave induced combustion method were used, both followed by ICP-OES analysis. No statistical differences between any of the methods were observed. However, the LOD obtained using the solid sampling GFAAS method were significantly better, ranging from 0.06–0.27 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> compared with those from microwave digestion (12–4890 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and microwave induced combustion (35–5443 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>).</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Mihaltan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit249"><sup><span class="sup_ref">249</span></sup></a> described the determination of <span class="italic">As and Sb in non- and bio-degradable materials</span>, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer from electronic waste, polyethylene shopping bags and PET water bottles. After sample decomposition using nitric and sulfuric acids in a microwave system, the digests were introduced by HG to a capacitively coupled plasma mini-torch operating with a power of 25 W, at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and with a flow rate of 0.41 L min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> argon. The protocol was validated by analysis of the granulated polyethylene certified materials ERM-EC 680K and ERM-EC 681K, with results being in excellent agreement with certified values. The microwave program was described as well as the HG process. The latter was optimized carefully and involved the use of <span class="small_caps">L</span>-cysteine at 90 °C for 10 min to pre-reduce As<small><sup>V</sup></small> and Sb<small><sup>V</sup></small> to As<small><sup>III</sup></small> and Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small>. The operating conditions for the plasma were also optimized. Under ideal conditions, the protocol yielded LOD of 1.5 and 0.3 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for As and Sb in the solid plastics. Precision was acceptable (&lt;7%). The only drawback to the system was that the analytes had to be determined separately because of the very different optimal viewing heights.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Mine and Houssiau<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit250"><sup><span class="sup_ref">250</span></sup></a> described the simultaneous <span class="italic">use of OES and TOF-SIMS for low-energy depth-profiling of polystyrene</span>. The authors modified their commercial TOF-SIMS instrument by attaching an OES spectrometer to the 45° backwards-facing flange so that light emission from the discharge could be monitored. This spectrometer had three different gratings, one with 600, another with 1800 and the last with 2400 lines/mm, and enabled measurements over the wavelength range 200–950 nm. The OES detection was achieved using a CCD camera. Several surprising observations were made. Intense atomic Cs emission was detected throughout the depth profile of the polystyrene sample. However, when oxygen or xenon were used as the primary ions, no emission from either O or Xe was observed.</p>
