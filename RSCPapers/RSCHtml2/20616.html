That trend has continued into this year. Semiconductors and other electronic components continue to become smaller and utilise more pure materials; hence analysing them becomes more difficult. This is especially true when depth-resolved data is required. Techniques capable of analysing with ever increasing depth resolution are therefore necessary and many studies into this have been reported. There is still a large interest in the non-destructive analysis of archaeological or historical materials (glasses, ceramics, paintings <span class="italic">etc.</span>). The use of solid sampling techniques that cause minimal damage is therefore still gaining in popularity. This is especially true for laser-based techniques such as LIBS and laser ablation, although the many variants of the X-ray-based techniques are also still proving very popular. The increasing trend to use multiple analytical techniques, ideally simultaneously to cause minimal damage and to obtain the maximal number of results in the shortest time, is also noted. These attempts to obtain maximum information are, again, mainly true for historical artefacts where obtaining more analytical information will lead to a better understanding of provenance, manufacturing process, <span class="italic">etc.</span>The real time analysis being undertaken in engines and at coal fired boilers is also an interesting development. These real time analyses allow monitoring of the systems and enable any deviations from peak performance to be identified and corrected in the shortest time possible.</span></p><p>This is the latest review covering atomic spectrometric measurements of industrial materials, metals, chemicals and advanced materials. It follows on from last year's review<small><sup>1</sup></small> and should be read in conjunction with other reviews in the series.<small><sup>2–6</sup></small></p></div><hr/>

<span>For all types of metals and alloys, the majority of abstracts centre on solid sample analysis methods. Laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) continues to be of interest in 14% of the abstracts reviewed (same as last year). The number of contributions involving multiple spectrometric methods is quite high at 31%. The overall distribution of abstracts reviewed for the metals section by single instrumental method were: atomic absorption 4.6%, atomic emission (including LIBS) 25.3%, mass spectrometry 17.3%, SIMS 5.1%, and XRF 13.5%. Abstracts that are fundamental in nature and/or focus on instrument development were not cited, readers are referred to instrumental reviews.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2,4</span></sup></a></span>

<span>Zhang and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> used <span class="italic">LIBS</span> elemental mapping to study weld creep failures in grade 91 weld metal. It was observed that Cr was not homogeneously distributed in the weld metal. This led to strong activity gradients in carbon which ultimately resulted in poor mechanical properties leading to creep failure. Stehrer, <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> analysed loose iron oxide nanoparticles by LIBS without pre-treatment. Limits of detection (LOD) were reported for Al, Mn, Ni and Si, (8, 860, 66 and 15 ppm, respectively). There were two reports concerning the determination of P in steel using LIBS combined with laser induced fluorescence whereby the plume generated by the LIBS event was irradiated by a second laser to induce atomic fluorescence of the analyte atom. The instrumentation of Shen and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> excited P atoms at wavelengths of 253.40 and 235.56 nm and the fluorescence was detected at 213.55 and 231.62 nm. A set of standards from 3.9 to 720 ppm P was used for calibration and the limit of detection was estimated to be 0.7 ppm. Kondo and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> used the 3rd harmonic of a Ti:Sapphire laser to excite fluorescence in the 253–256 nm region and fluorescence was detected at 213.62 and 214.91 nm. With relative ease of transmitting light of wavelength longer than 200 nm in fibre optics, it was suggested that this application could be applied to on-site monitoring of P concentration in steels.</span>
<p class="otherpara">Cadosch, <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> studied whether human osteoclast cells would grow on stainless steel and whether the cells would corrode the steel. The corrosion of the steel in osteoclast cell cultures was monitored by ICP-AES. It was found that stainless steel did corrode and would contribute to loosening of the steel implant in the body. Ishida and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> devised an on-line atomic absorption spectrometer to measure Mn and Fe in the vapour above a basic oxygen furnace used in steel production. Good correlation was reported between the Mn/Fe absorption ratio and the manganese concentration in the melt (within 0.2%) using a laboratory scale furnace.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Radiocarbon measurement of <small><sup>14</sup></small>C in iron by <span class="italic">accelerator mass spectrometry</span> (AMS) was validated by Oinonen and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> with measurement of <small><sup>14</sup></small>C in coal-produced steel. From other studies it was suggested that the limestone used in the smelting process complicates the age determination process. Valle <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> found that SIMS nano-analysis was a good means to determine the carbon content in Fe–Al–Mn–C alloys. Carbon measurements were made on materials with low carbon levels (below 0.05%). It was possible to define thermal treatment parameters that improved alloy ductility based on the SIMS results.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The laser induced colouration on stainless steel <span class="italic">surfaces</span> was studied by optical microscopy, SEM and time-of-flight (TOF) SIMS by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> A duplex oxide structure was formed which included an inner layer of Cr oxide and an outer layer of Fe oxide. It was claimed the oxide layer thickness increased from Fe diffusion to the surface during multiple laser scanning passes. The passive film on mild steel in a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> corrosive environment was studied by Han and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> Analysis using grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) indicated that trace magnetite in the siderite layer was responsible for the passivation. The structure and composition of the passive layer was determined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (SEM-EDX) and energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (EDXRF). Engkvist, <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> used a wide variety of instrumental methods (SEM, TEM, EDXRF, GIXRD), Auger electron spectrometry and TOF-SIMS, to study the oxidation of FeCrAl foils at temperatures of 500–900 °C in oxygen. In each temperature and humidity range, the oxide scales were composed of an inner and an outer layer of pure alumina separated by a Cr-rich band.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The surface enrichment and depletion of alloying elements in iron were examined using X-ray photoelectron spectrometry (XPS), electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and SIMS by Suzuki <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> Austenitic steel (Fe–Mn–Si–Cr) was observed to have a surface depleted in Mn but enriched in Cr when annealed under vacuum which improved the resistance to corrosion. The effect of adding ammonium sulfate to biomass on two different steels normally found in waste fired boilers was studied by Viklund and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> The techniques of SEM-EDX, TOF-SIMS and XRD were used to compare the effects on austenitic steel EN1.4301 (Fe–18Cr–9Ni) and low alloyed ferric steel EN1.7380 (Fe–2.25Cr–1Mo) at 500 °C. It was found that the addition of the sulfate reduces corrosion and that the austenitic steel is more resistant to corrosion than the low alloyed ferric steel. The effect of adding tetraethyloxysilane to welding sheath gas in reducing Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> emission from stainless steel welding was studied by Topham and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> Fume aerosols were analysed by ion chromatography and ICP-AES. There was a 45% reduction in Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> with the addition of 3% tetraethyloxysilane to the sheath gas. TEM images showed fume aerosols coated with SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> which gives support to the mechanism that inert SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> coats aerosol particles thereby reducing the availability of free Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small>. The re-crystallization of austenite in niobium micro-alloyed steels was observed using TEM-EDX, ICP-MS and XRD in a paper by Vervynckt and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> It was found that the experimental measurements agreed with the calculated precipitated mass fraction and precipitate composition as a function of temperature and steel composition.</p>

<span>Deuterium in zircaloy-4 alloys was determined using <span class="italic">LIBS</span> in a helium atmosphere as reported by Hedwig and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> Calibration was achieved using zircaloy-4 samples doped with pre-determined amounts of deuterium. The compositional change of weld material for Al5754 alloy with different welding conditions was monitored by LIBS, in a report by Jandaghi and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> LIBS measurements confirmed the modelling predictions that Mg in the weld metal increased while the Al decreased. Sasaki and Wagatsuma<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> analysed Ni–Zn alloys using a low pressure argon LIBS and found that calibration curves for several pairs of emission lines did not follow a linear relationship. It was thought this observation could be explained by the difference in the evaporation characteristics between Zn and Ni and that there are many different metallurgical phases observed in these binary alloys. A double pulse LIBS system was used to determine the composition of complex metallic alloys as reported by Sorrentino <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> The time-integrated spectra were analysed using the Partial Least Squares method which allowed the determination of element composition even with spectral interferences. Cristoforetti <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> reviewed the findings of a paper by Galbacs <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> which analysed gold alloys using double pulse LIBS. Cristoforetti <span class="italic">et al.</span> repeated the experiment and found the method of calibration requires <span class="italic">a priori</span> knowledge of the alloy to be effective. Low limits of detection were reported by Laville and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> during the determination of Pb in brass by laser induced fluorescence from a plasma generated by a LIBS system. A LOD of 1.2 ppm was observed for a single shot whereas 0.2 ppm was calculated after the accumulation of data from 100 shots.</span>
<p class="otherpara">The analyses of copper and magnesium alloys by IR-<span class="italic">laser ablation</span> (<span class="italic">LA</span>) <span class="italic">sampling</span> in combination with ICP-MS and ICP-AES were compared with results from Spark OES and glow discharge (GD)-MS methods in a paper by Wienold <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> It was found that LA-ICP-MS and GD-MS had comparable LOD (within a factor of 10) for most elements determined in copper and copper powder samples. Spark OES, however, consistently had lower LOD than LA-ICP-AES for elements determined in magnesium alloys. Klemm and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> demonstrated that organic monolayers adsorbed on copper could be qualitatively determined by both direct current and radio frequency GD-OES.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The process of zinc vacuum distillation was monitored by an online gas quadrupole mass spectrometer as described by Gopala <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> Results from high resolution GD-MS of the zinc before and after purification were also used to elucidate the mechanism of vacuum distillation. A systematic study of the effect of isotopes on depth profile metal coatings on metal substrates by LA-ICP-MS was conducted by Farinas and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> It was found that ablation rates were in the range of 0.55 μm pulse<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for copper coating on steel) to 0.83 μm pulse<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (for zinc coating on steel). Trace element impurities and Pb isotope ratios in Celtic gold coins were determined using LA-ICP-MS<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> by Bendall <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used the above information to find potential sources of the gold that were used in making the coins. Eugster and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a> demonstrated the potential for the U, Th, <small><sup>4</sup></small>He dating technique using an ultra-sensitive mass spectrometer to identify forgeries of gold objects. The determination of radiogenic <small><sup>4</sup></small>He can provide an estimate of time since the last melting. Yang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> measured <small><sup>107</sup></small>Ag/<small><sup>109</sup></small>Ag isotope ratios in silver products using multicollector (MC)-ICP-MS. There were no significant differences found in the isotope ratios between commercial high purity silver and NIST SRM 978a, Ag Nanopowder and Ag embedded in one brand of socks. Significant differences were found among NIST SRM 978a, Ag in a dietary supplement, decanethiol functionalized Ag nanoparticles and Ag in a different brand of socks. It was suggested by the authors that these isotope ratios might be useful for identifying sources of Ag in the environment. Copper in an aluminium alloy was determined by an online isotope dilution (ID)-ICP-MS technique combined with a microchip solvent extraction system as reported by Kagawa <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> The Cu was complexed with 8-hydroxyquinoline and extracted into <span class="italic">o</span>-xylene at pH 5.5. A solution of 0.1 M nitric acid was used to back extract the Cu at a flow rate of 20 μl per minute. The solvent extraction was about 40% efficient and the total measurement time was estimated to be 40 s per sample.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The matrix effects of <span class="italic">portable and stationary EDXRF</span> spectrometers for the analysis of a copper alloy, a 22 carat gold alloy and some non-metallic material were compared in a paper by Pessanha and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> It was found that the background for the copper and gold matrices were higher than for the non-metallic samples from both spectrometers. The portable EDXRF had much higher background than the stationary EDXRF instrument. This made the determination of trace elements impossible using the portable EDXRF and limited the effectiveness of the spectrometer. There were two papers published by Cesareo <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used a portable EDXRF instrument for the analysis of pre-Columbian artefacts; a funerary gold mask<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> and metal alloys found in a tomb.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> The portable instrument was used for determining the major alloy components at different positions on the artefacts and for identification of metal artefacts individually.

Constantinescu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit42"><sup><span class="sup_ref">42</span></sup></a> used particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) and micro Synchrotron Radiation XRF to measure a variety of trace elements in gold to show that Dacian gold bracelets were made from gold originating in Transylvania.</p>

Oertel <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43</span></sup></a> examined the corrosion from acetic acid vapour and relative humidity on Pb–Sn alloys using EDXRF, wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF), XRD and SEM. Acetic acid originates from aging wood and does not have as much corrosive effect as high humidity. It was found that 3–15% Sn protected the alloy at moderate humidity but it was less effective at higher humidity. Herrera and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44</span></sup></a> compared the elemental and micro structure of brass reed pipes from a Spanish organ from the Baroque period to a modern one.

<p class="otherpara">Cooper and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46</span></sup></a> used SIMS, EDXRF, Relative Resistance Ratios and microscopy to examine the effect of different cutting techniques on the <span class="italic">surface morphology and composition</span> of niobium. It was found that all the techniques altered the first 3–5 microns of the metal. The water jet cutting method introduced the most oxygen and hydrogen to the niobium and the electrical discharge machining introduced the least amount of these elements. Buffered chemical polishing removed surface contamination from the electrical discharge machining process but could not remove all of the contamination introduced by the water jet cutting method. The effects of electro-polishing and coating deposition on stainless steel plates in fuel cell membranes were studied by a variety of techniques as reported by Yun.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit47"><sup><span class="sup_ref">47</span></sup></a> Surface morphology was examined using AFM and filed emission (FE)-SEM.

<h3 id="sect815"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Petroleum and petroleum products</span></h3>
<span>Study of the elemental composition of coal as well as geochemistry of coal rich areas continues to feature in 2010. Continuing from last year's trend, there has been increased interest in alternative fuels. Fly ash continues to feature strongly; however, in contrast to 2009, the interest is in fly ash generated from biomass rather than coal. There are several papers discussing biomass related issues, and pyrolysis studies are also increasing. The subjects considered include analysis, production and environmental impact.</span>
<p class="otherpara">The use of LIBS has continued to increase throughout this review period as it is becoming a more established technique. It is being applied in the areas of coal, asphaltene and fly ash analysis. There is also work towards online analysis using LIBS for coal fired power plants which would allow real time control over boilers. These papers, which will be discussed in far more detail later in the text, have real practical applications, which could give significant energy efficiency gains in industry. There are two interesting papers<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72,73</span></sup></a> which discussed measurements of in-cylinder equivalence ratios. Both papers demonstrated a useful diagnostic engine test for spark ignition engines.</p>
<p class="otherpara">During the 2008 and 2009 review periods there was significant interest in further development of methods for the determination of low level S in fuel. There are far fewer papers reporting on this in 2010, which may be due to current methodology and technology meeting current requirements. Relatively few papers have been published about lubricating oils or wear metal analysis of lubricating oils during this review period.</p>
<p class="otherpara">This review will report novel aspects of the analytical techniques, sample pre-treatment or sample collection processes.</p>
<div><span id="sect823"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.1.1 Petroleum products—Gasoline, diesels, gasohol, exhaust particulates. </span><span>Polar species present in fuel, including alkylated phenols, can influence storage stability and lubricity. Kolbe <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> compared <span class="italic">phenol content and phenol alkylation pattern</span> of fuels which had been desulfurised using different methods. Sensitive and selective analytical methods were required as phenols occur at low part per million levels. The analysis used a derivatisation of phenols to ferrocene esters, followed by gas chromatography with both atomic emission detection (GC-AED) for iron, and mass spectrometric detection. Classical hydrodesulfurisation was found to lower the phenol content to a much greater extent than adsorptive desulfurisation. In particular larger alkylphenols were almost completely removed using hydrodesulfurisation, but almost unaffected by adsorptive desulfurisation on a Ni/NiO sorbent.</span><p class="otherpara">Maryutina and Soin<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> considered a novel approach to the elemental analysis of <span class="italic">diesel and crude oil</span>. A total of 21 analytes were preconcentrated by pumping the sample through a rotating coil column as a mobile phase. An aqueous nitric acid solution was used as the stationary phase. The phases were both well mixed and agitated, but there was no emulsion at the interface. It was possible to vary the volume of the sample from 10 mL to 1 L or more, using only 10 mL of acidic stationary phase. The acidic phase was then removed and analysed. The large preconcentration factors obtainable using this preparation could allow laboratories without ICP-MS capabilities to analyse down to the very low detection limits that are increasingly required.</p>
<p class="otherpara">A new <span class="italic">sample introduction system</span> for ICP-MS was constructed by Caumette and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76</span></sup></a> A heated spray chamber with a total consumption micro-nebuliser was developed to alleviate signal suppression (arising from decreased ionisation efficiency) during the analysis of light petroleum matrices. This allowed for analysis of undiluted gasoline, kerosene and gas condensates, and increased sensitivity by a factor of 3–4 in comparison with existing approaches.</p>
<p class="otherpara">An interesting study by Kawahara and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit72"><sup><span class="sup_ref">72</span></sup></a> determined the local equivalence ratio of a CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>/air mixture in a laminar premixed flame. <span class="italic">Spark induced breakdown spectrometry</span> (SIBS) with a fiber-coupled intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) spectrometer was used. Emission spectra of a plasma generated by a spark plug were investigated for their potential to measure local fuel concentrations. A spark plug sensor with an optical fiber, developed for application in spark ignition engines, could measure atomic emission intensity during the breakdown and arc phases of spark discharge. The results obtained in the study confirm that SIBS is a useful diagnostic tool for spark ignition engines. Another paper that also reported the study of in-cylinder equivalence ratios was authored by Joshi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> Simultaneous laser sparks were used for engine ignition and LIBS. A Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm was used with an optical spark plug to ignite a natural gas engine, and the optical emission from the combustion initiating laser spark collected. Analytes determined were H (656 nm), O (777 nm) and N (742 nm, 744 nm and 746 nm). The results of this study also suggested that this is a possible engine diagnostic method for cylinder resolved equivalence ratio measurements.</p>

Experiments were performed systematically to investigate the leaching behaviour in two major types of coal fly ashes, bituminous and sub-bituminous. The underlying processes that control As and Se leaching such as pH, solid/liquid ratio, calcium addition and leaching time were all studied. Overall, bituminous coal ash leached significantly more than sub-bituminous coal ash, and Se was more readily leachable than As for both types. Calcium precipitation played the most important role in reducing As and Se leaching from sub-bituminous coal ashes over the entire experimental pH range.</span><p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">An on</span>-<span class="italic">line</span>, <span class="italic">fully software</span>-<span class="italic">controlled LIBS system</span> for quality analysis of pulverised coal in power plants was developed by Yin <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> The system contained programmable logic-controlled sampling equipment, which was capable of multipoint sampling and sample preparation. Special attention was given to the LIBS system, data processing methods and specific settings including the high pressure gas cleaning device. Measurement errors of less than 10% were reported for Al, C, Fe, H, Mg, Na, Si and Ti. Knowledge of the chemical composition of coal is vital in order to obtain optimal boiler control, and the accuracy obtained experimentally confirmed that the system is suitable for industrial use. LIBS was used for coal fly ash analysis by Ctvrtnickova and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> Standard analysis methods used for fly ash cannot be used to control a boiler in real time. LIBS can dramatically reduce the analysis time, and online detection can be performed. This study considered various sample preparations for the analysis. Pressed pellets were prepared with varying quantities of two different binders. The LIBS parameters and procedures were also presented. It is hoped that this work will be used to establish the experimental conditions for online analysis.</p>
<p class="otherpara">A paper by Thiebaud and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit82"><sup><span class="sup_ref">82</span></sup></a> reported the development of an <span class="italic">on</span>-<span class="italic">line continuous monitor</span> for Hg determination in the exhaust stream of coal-fired power plants. The instrument was based on the ultraviolet absorption from a mercury lamp source and used a light emitting diode (LED) background correction system. This approach allowed the absorption arising from other species such as SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to be removed, allowing the measurement of Hg–O only. The apparatus was tested in a 230MW coal-fired power plant, and the paper stated that this proved to be operable. A laboratory study using the device yielded a LOD of 2 μg m<small><sup>−3</sup></small> (for a 1 min measurement through a 0.49 m path length), but it was thought that this would decrease to 0.2 μg m<small><sup>−3</sup></small> had a 7 m wide stack been used. Comparison with an accepted test method is required for validation, and this would be an interesting subject for further work.</p>

The lubricating oils used contained typical engine oil additives, and two types of lubrication systems were used. Analysis of the friction surfaces showed that secondary ions originating from adsorbed components were detected for each additive. The differences in adsorbing behaviour of additives between different engine oil components and different substrates were clarified. The causes of difference in friction coefficient among the engine oil lubrication systems were partly explained with the adsorbing behaviour of Mo-dithiocarbamate. The results demonstrated that TOF-SIMS is useful for the analysis of real world lubrication phenomena.</span></div>

An EDXRF method was developed to determine low ppm levels of S in biomass feedstocks and subsequent residues from pre-treatment reactions. Calibrations by standard additions were performed using S standards milled with microcrystalline cellulose. The method was successfully validated using ultra violet fluorescence (UVF) and ICP-AES at two independent laboratories. A detection limit of 2 ppm was achieved. It is likely that this technology and application will be useful and appropriate for use in industry. Hasan and colleagues<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> studied the trace metals in black solid materials deposited from biomass burned on cooking stoves in Bangladesh. Samples were taken from above the stoves, inside the kitchens. The analytes Ca, Cd, Fe, Hg, K, Mg and Pb were detected. It was found that biomass comprising straw, bamboo, cow dung, leaves and plants produced far greater Pb, Cd, Mg and K than another common fuel, rice husk coils.

It was found that oil produced at 623 K contained very low levels of metals, with nearly all of the metals accumulated in the char/ash residue. This could offer a valuable processing method for heavy metal contaminated biomass.</span><p class="otherpara">Silva and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit87"><sup><span class="sup_ref">87</span></sup></a> proposed alternative calibration approaches and modifiers for the determination of Cd, Pb and Tl in biodiesel. Micro-emulsions were prepared using biodiesel (2 g), nitric acid (1 mL of 10%) and propanol. The analysis was carried out using GFAAS operating under optimised pyrolysis and atomisation temperatures. Calibration solutions were matrix matched with base oil, and recoveries between 80%–116% were achieved at low ppb levels for the elements considered. This work may be helpful for laboratories without ICP-MS capability. The expansion of this method to the determination of other elements may be a suitable subject for further work.</p>

<h3 id="sect892"><span class="b_heading">2.2 Organic chemicals and solvents</span></h3>
<span>The number of papers describing novel work involving the analysis and characterisation of ancient, valuable and archaeological objects is particularly noteworthy. This application area seems to be driving developments in either non-destructive techniques, or techniques requiring the destruction of very small sample amounts. Additionally, field-based techniques are maximising the yield of information by employing multiple analytical techniques, with atomic and molecular spectral data being acquired simultaneously. Additionally, laser-based spectroscopies, including LIBS are very prominent in the literature covered by this review period, as is the use of synchrotron sources. Laser spectroscopies are also being reported for the remote and real time analysis of hazardous environments, including suspect explosive materials. Speciation continues to feature strongly in the literature and there are several papers utilising the high efficiencies of electro-driven separations with one paper describing for the first time that micro-emulsion electro-kinetic Chromatography has been employed with ICP-MS. Here the authors described a new procedure for the speciation of anticancer platinum compounds. Several papers which are not reviewed in detail are included in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, which contains papers which compliment the review or are interesting from an applications point of view.</span>

X-ray techniques for the determination of pigments in historical artworks are a notable theme,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96,97</span></sup></a> as is the analysis of metals in pigments.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98"><sup><span class="sup_ref">98</span></sup></a> The analysis of artworks in the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna has been greatly facilitated by the development of an XRF spectrometer which has been specifically adapted for this purpose.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a> This portable focused-beam XRF instrument was designed and manufactured to take into account the large variation in sample shape and size of museum objects, and was equipped with a vacuum chamber enclosed with a polyimide film (Kapton) window, allowing the detection of elements as low in mass as Na. Two low power tubes (one with a molybdenum-anode and the other with a chromium-anode) with a point focus of about 180 μm could be used as sequential excitation sources. A polycapillary lens with a spot size of 150 μm was used for focusing the primary beam onto small areas of the sample, examples of which included the fine brush strokes on paintings. A camera was installed into the vacuum chamber for inspecting the area of analysis, facilitated by two laser pointers which coincide with the focal point of the polycapillary. Interestingly, the use of XRF together with the <span class="italic">fundamental parameters method</span> has enabled de Viguerie and colleagues to determine both the composition and thickness of layers within paintings.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> There are several technological advances of note in this field and these are driven by the need for non-invasive analysis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> of archaeological and culturally significant art objects, involving minimal sample destruction whilst yielding maximum information on the object of interest, often involving portable instruments, or beam line sources and these are reviewed below.</span><p class="otherpara">In addition to instrumental advances, the cooperation of scientists dealing with the analysis of the artistic, historical and technological aspects of these objects has been outlined as being of critical importance for their proper characterisation, including origin and dating. According to Cybulska and colleagues, proper documentation of these objects also requires cooperation between researchers representing different areas of science, including archaeology, chemistry, textile technology and the history of art.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102</span></sup></a> A range of techniques are presented with the emphasis on the elucidation of the original manufacturing methods, and analysis of the raw materials and dyes as this was stated to be fundamental for the proper identification of the object including its origin and dating. In another example of the importance of this interdisciplinary approach, radio-carbon dating of recently restored wooden doors of the medieval St Ambrogio Basilica in Milan has been carried out by Poldi <span class="italic">et al.</span> using accelerator mass spectrometry. Work was undertaken at two different laboratories. Results were used in conjunction with dendrochronological analysis based on high resolution photographs and analysis by EDXRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit103"><sup><span class="sup_ref">103</span></sup></a> This work is a timely example of the collaboration required to yield the maximum analytical information and benefit for conservation projects. Collaboration between craftsmen involved in restoration of artefacts, physicists, chemists and entomologists has enabled the development of an improved conservation strategy, better understanding of the artefact and a verification of several hypotheses made by historians over the last century.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The determination of As and Hg in extracts from ancient papers employing a unique and fully automated integration of solid phase extraction (SPE) and EDXRF has been reported by Alcalde-Molina and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit104"><sup><span class="sup_ref">104</span></sup></a> A <span class="italic">totally automated approach</span> was achieved by the on-line connection of a lab-on-valve system (an automated system that enables several reagents to be mixed <span class="italic">via</span> numerous channels on a multi-port valve to affect assorted chemical reactions) to a methacrylate cell in which the analytes were pre-concentrated. In the last review period, it was noted that synchrotron radiation sources were becoming more widely used in the analysis of historical artefacts and valuable paintings.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> These developments continued during the current period, and a very useful review paper by Creagh and co-workers outlining the improvements in the design of synchrotron radiation sources together with some interesting examples of their use in the analysis of historical or culturally significant objects was included (28 refs).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit105"><sup><span class="sup_ref">105</span></sup></a> This paper reviewed the analysis of important artefacts held by Australian national collecting agencies using both laboratory and synchrotron based analytical techniques. Included was the use of synchrotron radiation for several spectroscopies including: FTIR micro-spectroscopy to map the spreading of inks on parchment; finely focused X-ray beams to study ageing related structural changes in collagen and the presence of ink using small and wide angle X-ray scattering, the principles of which are outlined in a paper referenced therein. The high intensity of synchrotron radiation is advantageous as it makes possible the XRD studies of pigments within small samples. Studies on around 10 μg of material were successful. Around 5 g of material was required to achieve similar diffraction contrast with conventional laboratory systems. Particle induced X-ray emission (PIXE) studies on μg quantities of ochre sample were carried out using a 2.5 MeV proton beam with sufficient sensitivity to yield quantitative results with a high degree of confidence. The authors suggested that with a combination of diffraction patterns and PIXE quantitative data, it may even be possible to establish the mine site from which the ochre originated, giving valuable information on Aboriginal trading patterns. Additionally, a new technique for the study of easel paintings was presented. Here the reflected light from two obliquely placed quartz halogen lights was reflected off the painting and imaged onto a charge coupled device (CCD) array. A filter wheel was placed in front of the detector and the spectral reflectance characteristics across the UV, visible and NIR could be recorded. This approach is known as hyperspectral imaging and is a reflectance technique which enables the distribution of surface pigments to be determined. <span class="italic">Multiple</span>-<span class="italic">technique analysis</span> employing synchrotron source XRD together with EDX, SEM, FTIR and pyrolysis GC-MS has been employed by Herrera <span class="italic">et al.</span> for the characterisation of both inorganic and organic compounds of the textiles, preparation layers and pictorial layers from Baroque Andalusia paintings.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit106"><sup><span class="sup_ref">106</span></sup></a> The analysis of multiple layers within parchment samples has been accomplished by Dolgin and colleagues using synchronous scanning fluorescence, LIBS, visual colour imaging and near infra red analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit107"><sup><span class="sup_ref">107</span></sup></a> Ion beam analysis has also been employed for the analysis of highly degraded pigments from decorations in Egyptian tombs<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit108"><sup><span class="sup_ref">108</span></sup></a> where PIXE techniques were employed for the determination of the nature of the pigments and the identification of domestic and imported materials. The analysis of a wood painting by Giorgio Vasari, where proton beams of different energies—differential PIXE—allowed the depth distribution of elements to be determined was reported by Grassi and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">109</span></sup></a> Backscattering spectrometry has been used together with PIXE to allow the characterisation of an organic binder in various artefacts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">110</span></sup></a> In this work by de Viguerie and co-workers, 3 MeV protons were used for simultaneous PIXE and backscattering spectrometry, enabling the determination of inorganic elemental composition and carbon and oxygen. This enabled a complete characterisation of the paint layers of the artefacts including composition and proportion of organic binder. An interesting application of iron K-edge XANES, using the HASYLAB beamline for the determination of the oxidation state of Fe in <span class="italic">iron gall ink</span> in historical manuscripts was reported by Wilke <span class="italic">et al.</span> and demonstrated the importance of synchrotron sources for the characterisation of historically significant artefacts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">111</span></sup></a> The determination of polysulfide radical anions in blue and mauve ultramarine pigments, using sulfur K edge XANES has been studied by Fleet and Liu.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit112"><sup><span class="sup_ref">112</span></sup></a> The spectra were dominated by features of reduced S and sulfate species. Additionally, a pre-peak was also present in the spectra, which was proportional to the depth of the blue coloration. This feature provided a new method for estimating the proportion of ultramarine cage sites occupied by the blue chromophore. The occupancy of the polysulfide radical anion was estimated at 33% in an intense ultramarine pigment, 22% in a dark blue pigment and 1% in a deep royal blue lazurite from Afghanistan. The degradation of iron gall inks can be problematic and the ratio of Fe<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/Fe<small><sub>tot</sub></small> can be taken as a proxy for the degradation process. Conservation and/or restoration treatments inevitably change the redox potential of iron gall inks and spatially resolved XANES measurements allowed a comparison of the Fe<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/Fe<small><sub>tot</sub></small> ratio between samples with and without conservation treatment. This paper presented a comprehensive discussion of the experiments employed and even presented a quantitative study of the radiation-induced changes due to the measurement procedure. In a slightly different approach to the characterisation of iron gall inks, a novel procedure for the sampling of micro-cores (0.7 mm diameter) from paper and parchment was proposed and has been used by Charleton and co-workers to characterise the iron gall inks using GFAAS,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit113"><sup><span class="sup_ref">113</span></sup></a> though this has the disadvantage that samples—albeit small ones—are destroyed. The elemental composition of several books from the 18th and 19th centuries has been analysed by Pessanha and colleagues for Hg diffusion in vermillion pigment.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114"><sup><span class="sup_ref">114</span></sup></a> Elemental analysis was achieved using EDXRF with chemical mappings of Hg distribution carried out on small fragments of the books, utilising the spatial resolution capabilities of micro-synchrotron radiation XRF. The combined use of both molecular and atomic analytical techniques including XRF, LA-ICP-MS and Raman spectroscopy is an important approach and this multi-technique methodology is critically important for the comprehensive understanding and characterisation of various artefacts including manuscripts,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit115"><sup><span class="sup_ref">115</span></sup></a> pigments<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit116"><sup><span class="sup_ref">116</span></sup></a> and paints employed by artists including Picasso.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">117</span></sup></a> Combinations of atomic and molecular techniques are employed to achieve maximum analytical information.

<div><span id="sect1022"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.2.2 LIBS and laser spectroscopies. </span><span>In the previous review period<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> some interesting and important developments from the LIBS community were reviewed. Papers from the current review period would suggest that both the importance and the number of application areas of <span class="italic">LIBS and related laser</span>-<span class="italic">based techniques</span> are growing. The driving force for this growth appears to be its rapid and remote analysis capabilities for a wide variety of sample types including the analysis of art works where the requirement for little or no sample preparation is important and the destruction of very small areas of the sample is critical. Additionally, the ease with which laser systems can be combined with other techniques, particularly molecular techniques such as Raman spectroscopy is an advantage. A combination of these techniques, using the same optical set up has been employed by Osticioli and colleagues for the analysis of various art and architectural objects to allow the identification of the materials used in their manufacture and contaminants present on their surfaces.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a> LIBS was employed for depth-profiling and yielded elemental information of the surface layers. The source was a pulsed Nd:YAG laser (λ = 532 nm) with the same laser being used for the Raman measurements. An intensified CCD camera which was synchronised with the laser pulse allowed the complete removal of fluorescent interference. This paper described the analysis of a mural painting, a fragment of a decorative tile and part of a bronze figure. The artefacts which were analysed demonstrated the applicability of this approach to a variety of sample types with no sample pre-treatment. A further significant instrumental development by the same research group was a potentially transportable prototype instrument capable of carrying out Raman, LIBS and LIF spectroscopy using a single pulsed laser source and common optical platform.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122</span></sup></a> This instrument utilised time resolved detection and gating to enable the Raman, LIBS and fluorescence signals to be separated. The instrument allowed multiple analyses on the same spot on a sample and so minimised sample destruction.</span><p class="otherpara">One property of laser-based techniques which makes them desirable for environmental applications is their capabilities for remote or <span class="italic">‘standoff’ analysis</span>. The standoff detection of nitrotoluenes from explosives residues using 213 nm laser induced fluorescence-amplified spontaneous emission (LIF-ASE) from nitric oxide has been described by Arnold and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123</span></sup></a> Nitric oxide is a fluorescent decomposition product of nitrotoluene and other compounds including explosives. The paper described the LIF-ASE apparatus in some detail. The effects of various buffer gases on the spectra of NO were examined and the generation of various test vapours was achieved by means of exposure of nitrotoluene samples to buffer gases at various temperatures and flow rates. The directional nature of the stimulated spontaneous emission makes the technique ideally suited to standoff detection at distances of over a kilometre. The other advantage of the ASE technique over conventional LIF is the enhanced sensitivity, allowing for the detection of low-vapour pressure materials. The spectral information could also be used for the discrimination of nitrotoluene isomers. The use of LIBS for remote or standoff detection has also been reported and reviewed previously<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,124</span></sup></a> and the remote analytical capabilities of LIBS continue to be an important feature of LIBS development. In a novel development, the standoff LIBS detection of explosive residues behind various physical barriers has been reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> This work, by Gonzalez <span class="italic">et al.</span>, outlined the development of a LIBS procedure for the remote detection of explosive materials when present behind materials such as polymethylmethacrylate and a variety of glasses. The transmission of the laser beam and collection of the emission from the plasma plume were examined through the various glasses and polymers and the effect of the material type and its position on the transmission of radiation was investigated. Residues of 2,6-dinitrotoluene, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene, a range of plastic explosives and sodium chlorate supported on aluminium foil and several other supports were employed in the studies. A suite of chemometric tools were investigated within MATLAB, for the characterisation of the explosive residues. It was concluded that the detection of explosives behind a barrier is achievable if part of the laser energy and plasma light is transmitted through the barrier. In the most difficult cases, a decision based on 8 laser shots gave 100% sensitivity to the presence of explosives with no false positives and the analysis time was less than 2 s. It is likely that this combination of LIBS with chemometric data manipulation will provide an important tool in the detection of explosives and quite possibly other materials in homeland security applications. This work provided a valuable demonstration that LIBS techniques can be applied for the detection of explosive substances through the windows of vehicles and buildings. In another study of LIBS detection of explosives residues, the single shot variation of line intensity ratios for samples was found to be significant and was strongly influenced by the amount of ablated material. Emission intensities from atomic oxygen and nitrogen were found to be attenuated by the presence of organic material. This was attributed to reactions occurring in the plasma and hydrogen lines were strongly dependent on humidity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> Three useful <span class="italic">review papers</span> are included. One presented recent advances, challenges and future prospects for LIBS as a means of detecting explosives.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> This review by Gottfried and colleagues (142 refs) presented some recent advances in instrumentation including double pulse LIBS experiments to reduce air entrainment in the plasma, the application of chemometric techniques to facilitate the discrimination between explosives and non-explosives and the improvement of sensitivity and selectivity by employing femtosecond pulse lasers. One growth area in the field of LIBS is the combination of LIBS with Raman spectroscopy and several papers on this are included in the review paper. Interestingly, one paper on photo-fragmentation-LIF of nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide fragments is included as are four papers on the use of photo-acoustic spectroscopy and their future combination with LIBS is postulated. The second review paper (121 refs) presented a critique of laser-based standoff detection methods for the detection of explosives,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> and focused primarily on trace procedures for detecting small amounts of explosives arising from their handling, or the vapours surrounding an explosive charge, rather than the more usual bulk detection methods. The technologies which were discussed included LIBS, light detection and ranging (LIDAR), differential absorption LIDAR, Raman, UV-Raman and resonance enhanced Raman, LIF, photo-fragmentation-LIF and pulsed laser fragmentation mid-IR. There were also brief sections on millimetre wave imaging and terahertz spectroscopy and other novel techniques including standoff super-radiant spectroscopy, differential reflection spectroscopy and resonant IR photothermal imaging. The third review paper, by Willer <span class="italic">et al.</span>, looked at techniques also used in standoff mode for explosives and other substances and covered mainly molecular spectroscopies including laser absorption, Raman, photoacoustic, evanescent-field, terahertz and cavity ringdown.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> A brief section on LIBS was also included. A total of 58 references were cited. A paper of note by Moros and colleagues reported the standoff detection of explosives by simultaneous Raman and LIBS, employing a mobile integrated sensor platform and collection of both Raman and LIBS signals from the same laser pulses by means of a Cassegrain telescope.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> The ability to acquire both molecular and multi-element information from the same laser pulses on the same sample cross section greatly enhanced the capabilities over conventional LIBS, and was used for the detection of compounds which were either explosive materials, or precursors of explosive substances.</p>
<p class="otherpara">An interesting environmental application making good use of the remote analytical capabilities of LIBS is the analysis of chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-treated timbers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> This paper by Gething and co-workers employed LIBS for the on-site determination of preservative in CCA-treated timbers for recycling, employing full spectrum analysis (200–800 nm) and scanning of the laser shots across the width and length of the timber samples. The results were variable, with poor precision and it was uncertain whether this poor precision was because of the inhomogeneity of the sample or inherent to the technique. It was concluded, however, that LIBS was a useful technique for determining threshold values of the preservative concentrations. In another, quite different application, LIBS has been employed as a means of identifying analgesic pills<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132</span></sup></a> by a comparison of the spectra over 200–1000 nm with reference spectra stored in a computer based spectral library. Historically, many techniques have been applied to the characterisation of paper<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit133"><sup><span class="sup_ref">133–135</span></sup></a> and one LIBS application has been used for the forensic identification of confidential documents,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">136</span></sup></a> by comparison of the spectra with reference spectra of a range of documents. Linear and rank correlation methods both yielded excellent identification probabilities of a range of documents.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The technique of <span class="italic">LA</span>-<span class="italic">ICP</span>-<span class="italic">MS</span> is very powerful for the analysis of solids and has been successfully employed by van Es and co-workers for the discrimination of document paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">137</span></sup></a> including large numbers of similar samples from different sources. A multitude of elements and isotopes were quantified using 0.25 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> of sample and intensities relative to <small><sup>88</sup></small>Sr were calculated due to the fact that this Sr isotope is present in all paper samples in similar concentrations and with even distribution. LA-ICP-MS was found to discriminate the samples well, but when combined with XRF and IRMS the discrimination power was greatly enhanced. In a similar application, LA-ICP-MS was employed by Gallo and Almirall for the forensic elemental analysis of cotton fibres, to increase the discrimination between similar cotton fibres which may constitute trace evidence at crime scenes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit138"><sup><span class="sup_ref">138</span></sup></a> This paper demonstrated for the first time the forensic elemental analysis of cotton fibres. Fibres were analysed using both a digestion ICP-MS procedure and a LA-ICP-MS procedure. The LA sampling procedure required the destruction of minimal sample amounts as compared with conventional digestion procedures, and significantly reduced the analysis time. Samples were mixed with germanium and pelletized prior to ablation. The LA-ICP-MS detection limits for a range of elements were sub ppm to ppb and RSD values (n = 5) ranged from 1.8 to 8.8%, which was better than the digestion procedure. Additionally, the accuracy of the LA-ICP-MS procedure was significantly better than the digestion procedure. All raw cotton samples were distinguishable indicating that this procedure may be sufficiently discriminating to be used as evidence.</p>

As stated in the previous review,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> there continues to be concern over their potential health risks and the concentrations of PBDE in the environment are increasing. In order to measure the physico-chemical properties of the PBDE vapour, their thermal and photodecomposition properties, headspace-GC-ICP-MS has been employed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit139"><sup><span class="sup_ref">139</span></sup></a> The paper (in Japanese) by Tao and Nakazato reported that the major factor influencing the analytical performance of this technique was a significant memory effect.

This procedure was employed to measure the temperature dependency of vaporisation for 13 PBDE congeners, thermal decomposition of PBDE-209 in polystyrene and the photodecomposition of the same compound. The analysis was found to be better than the conventional procedure because of the elimination of evaporation losses of reactants and products and the equimolar sensitivity facilitating the calculation of mass balances.</span><p class="otherpara">A new procedure for <span class="italic">organophosphorus</span> analysis utilising the high separation efficiency of capillary electrophoresis and the sensitive element specific detection capabilities of ICP-MS has been reported by Yang and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit140"><sup><span class="sup_ref">140</span></sup></a> Capillary electrophoresis separation has traditionally resulted in a significant dilution of the analyte and this, coupled with the fact that P is not a particularly sensitive element by ICP-MS, combine to give relatively high detection limits for organo-phosphorus compounds. This paper aimed to address these issues by utilising a “collective sample introduction technique” based on an interface developed and constructed in-house. The electrophoresis parameters were optimised for dimethoate, trichlorofon and glyphosphate. The authors presented results from a conventional system of continuous introduction of eluent into the ICP-MS and compared these with results from the new collective introduction technique where only the eluent corresponding to the elution time of the organophosphorus compounds was introduced. This was achieved <span class="italic">via</span> a two-pump manifold, the design and operation of which is described in the paper. The collective mode of sampling into the ICP-MS instrument resulted in significantly less chromatographic dispersion and thus narrower peaks with lower detection limits for all three of the compounds. Detection limits were reported to be up to ten times lower (0.05–0.07 ng/mL) for the collective sample introduction than with the conventional continuous introduction.</p>

<p class="otherpara">When quantifying the total concentration of an element which exists as several different species, significant errors may arise because of the different behaviours of the species during nebulisation with a pneumatic nebuliser. This is particularly so with silicon containing species. Silicon is a very important element in many industries, particularly in petroleum products where it is a poison for hydrogenation catalysts, and in fuels where it can deposit on the oxygen sensor within the engine management system, causing engine failure. The determination of Si can be difficult for the reasons outlined, with many of the Si species being unknown. Sanchez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">142</span></sup></a> showed how these effects can be minimised and have evaluated two approaches to mitigate this problem.

This work showed that the effect of the chemical form of silicon was very significant, but it could be mitigated by the use of total or near total sample consumption systems, with the best approach being the use of the heated single pass spray chamber with a micro-nebuliser operated at flow rates of below 40 μL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.</p>

A radical mechanism resulting in the formation of ligands thus giving rise to volatile products was proposed. The identification of the reaction products is fundamental to progress in understanding in this area, and this was the focus of this paper which described some interesting experiments to elucidate the type of reactions which were occurring. Volatile species resulting from the reaction with the various organic acids were identified by GC-MS, facilitated by isotopic labelling experiments. This approach has resulted in a detailed understanding of the chemistry which was occurring and should be useful when developing photo-chemical techniques for generating other volatile species. Volatile organic sulfides and disulfides produced during fermentation processes have a significant effect on the aroma of beverages. Organic Se compounds including dimethyl selenide and dimethyl diselenides are also often present in beverages, particularly in beers, although their contribution to flavour is not documented and their concentrations are usually very low.

This approach can measure small variations in the isotopic composition of preparations containing identical elemental compositions and is therefore an important approach for the detection of counterfeit pharmaceutical products. In this study, multicollector ICP-MS for analysis of S isotope amount ratios was employed together with elemental analysis isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) for the carbon isotope amount ratio. Compared with previous studies, a relatively large number of samples (139 batches and 417 individual samples of Heptodin) were analysed. The isotope amount ratios of C, N and S were measured on the active pharmaceutical ingredient content and of Mg, present in the magnesium stearate and potentially, magnesium silicate excipient, by MC-ICP-MS and elemental analysis IRMS. Authenticity ranges were obtained for each isotope system and were combined to yield a unique multi-isotope pattern for the genuine article. Variation in Mg isotope amount ratios for genuine and counterfeit preparations was found to be similar to the uncertainty of the measurement so the use of this parameter was discarded. Isotope amount ratios of S, C and N however, were very indicative and were combined in a 3-dimensional plot which showed a distinctive cluster for genuine tablets and at least eight groups of counterfeits were easily seen.</p>

No stannane was produced at high acidity because of the formation of tin substrates and hydridoboron species. The presence of L-cysteine did not affect the production of stannane at low acidity, but it did extend the range of acidity that may be used. This was attributed to the formation of Sn-L-cysteine complexes that also managed to stabilise the Sn in solution at low acidity. The formation of L-cysteine–borane complexes was found not to play any significant role.

Since the Cl content in cement/concrete is one of the factors that determines the durability and safety of the material, its quantitative determination is important for these sample types. Two papers have been published that have described the use of LIBS for this purpose. Gondal and colleagues used a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm to form plasmas on three different types of cement.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">166</span></sup></a> The operating conditions were optimised and reported. Results from the LIBS analyses were compared with those obtained using a dissolution process followed by ICP-OES analysis. The authors concluded that LIBS was a reliable method for the rapid determination of Cl in cement. Gehlen <span class="italic">et al.</span> determined Cl in drill cores by scanning the surface of the core with laser pulses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit167"><sup><span class="sup_ref">167</span></sup></a> Spectral lines for Cl in both the UV and the IR range were studied. Also studied were the effects of different pressures and gases, with helium at pressures of between 5 and 400 mbar being used as the process gas. In addition, both single and double pulse modes of LIBS were tested. Using pulse energies of several hundred mJ to optimise sensitivity as well as the other optimum conditions and the Cl line at 134.72 nm, a LOD of 0.1% m/m was achieved for Cl in the hydrated cement.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Several other applications of <span class="italic">cement analysis</span> have been reported. The feasibility of using an <span class="italic">in-situ</span> fusion for the determination of Co, Cr and Mn in Portland cement was explored by Intima and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a> Sample (200 μg) was weighed into a boat-type graphite furnace platform and then 10 μL of flux mixture (4% m/v sodium carbonate + 4% m/v zinc oxide + 0.1% m/v Triton X-100) was added. After heating to 800 °C for 20 s the melt was dissolved using 10 μL of 0.1% nitric acid. The analytes were then detected using GFAAS that utilised a three-field zeeman technique to cope with the high background signals and to decrease the analytical sensitivity. Analysis of CRMs validated the protocol and the LOD were 0.11, 1.1 and 1.9 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Co, Cr and Mn respectively. As expected for an analysis that includes weighing out such small masses, the precision was relatively poor (12% RSD for n = 5). Matos and Nobrega used a combination of AAS and spectrophotometry to accomplish Cr speciation in cements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> Total Cr was determined using FAAS following sample dissolution using a fusion.

<div><span id="sect1195"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.3.5 Other applications. </span><span>There have been several other relatively simple applications published in this review period. Most of these are best summarised in a Table <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">(Table 3</a>). However, there have been a few more important ones that deserve description in a little more detail. Among these has been a publication by Huang and co-authors who described the determination of I <span class="italic">via</span> the spectrum of barium mono-iodide using high resolution continuum source molecular absorption spectrometry in a graphite furnace.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit170"><sup><span class="sup_ref">170</span></sup></a> Several potential molecules were tested (including AlI, GaI, InI, TlI, CaI, SrI and BaI), but the BaI was found to yield the most sensitive signal using 538.308 nm. The presence of high concentrations of Cl, F, Fe, K and Na were found to decrease the sensitivity, but no other spectral interferences were observed. Different forms of I, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> iodide, iodate, iodine and organically bound I, were all found to produce identical BaI signal intensity. The LOD was 600 pg and the calibration was linear to 250 ng. Two real samples (an iodide pill and a thyroid hormone pill containing I) were analysed using the technique and the results were compared with those obtained using potentiometric titration and ICP-TOF-MS. Results were broadly in good agreement. Precision for the developed method was very good, being 2% RSD (n = 3). The influence of carrier gas during the analysis of alumina using LA-ICP-MS has been studied by Lee and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit171"><sup><span class="sup_ref">171</span></sup></a> The effects of both argon and helium on the signal intensities, precision and ablated particle size were tested. Using a 213 nm laser for ablation, the analytes Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na and Ti were determined in alumina CRMs. Signals obtained in a helium atmosphere were found to be more stable for samples in the form of both pressed powders and sintered pellets. The ablated particles were larger and more irregular when they had been ablated in argon. This presumably is the reason for the poorer signal stability. An interesting paper by McNaghten and colleagues described the LIBS determination of He and Ar in binary and ternary gas mixtures with nitrogen.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> Significant quenching of the He signal was observed through collisional deactivation of excited species, but this could largely be overcome by either increasing the laser irradiance and/or by decreasing the pressure at which the analysis takes place. Under optimal conditions, the LOD was at the ppm or tens of ppm level whilst the linear range spanned several orders of magnitude. It was concluded that LIBS could potentially be used successfully for other such gaseous applications. A novel approach to determining Cl in acidic medium using total reflection XRF (TXRF) has been presented by Misra <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">173</span></sup></a> A known excess amount of silver nitrate was added to the sample to precipitate the Cl as silver chloride.

The radiation used was a tungsten continuum at 50 kV and 38 mA and the Ag and Cd k-alpha lines were used for the measurements. The approach was applied to six sodium chloride samples that had been diluted in nitric acid so that the Cl was in the range 1–60 μg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Precision was better than 10% (using one sigma criterion) and the results deviated from the expected values by less than 15%.</span>

<div><span id="sect1287"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.3.6 Analysis of nano-structures. </span><span>The use of nano-materials continues to grow rapidly, with uses as diverse as vehicles for drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement, sunscreens and as photoluminescent quantum dots all being found. Numerous papers have described novel preparation methods for such materials or have developed more novel materials and have then used atomic spectrometry to characterise them. Although interesting, these papers do not really advance knowledge in the use of atomic spectrometry and will therefore not be included in the review. This review period has, however, yielded several papers that discussed the analysis of nanostructures in some detail and many have highlighted potential problems and methods of circumventing them. These papers will be discussed in greater detail in this section of the review.</span>
<span id="sect1291"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">2.3.6.1 Reviews. </span><span>Three review papers have been published within the last year that covered various aspects of nano-structure analysis. <span class="italic">Surface analytical techniques</span> based on electron spectroscopy and mass spectrometry and their role in the characterisation of nanoscopic structures has been discussed by Oechsner.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a> In particular, the author discussed the use of secondary neutral mass spectrometry (SNMS); also known as sputtered neutral mass spectrometry. This technique has the ability to obtain extremely highly resolved data; possibly even surpassing the resolution and quantification capabilities of SIMS. The review contained 13 references. A second review on the area of surface analysis was prepared by Baer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit181"><sup><span class="sup_ref">181</span></sup></a> These authors discussed the information that may be gleaned from the analysis of nanoparticles using techniques such as Auger electron spectroscopy, XPS, TOF-SIMS, low energy ion scattering (LEIS) and various forms of scanning probe microscopy, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The review, containing 112 references, gave examples of the characterisation of nanoparticles and then discussed the limitations/issues that may be encountered from each of the different analytical techniques.</span><p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Inorganic mass spectrometry</span> as a tool for characterisation at the nano-scale was discussed at length (131 refs) by Fernandez and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit182"><sup><span class="sup_ref">182</span></sup></a> The review discussed those techniques that are capable of analysing solid materials directly (and hence provide spatially resolved data). Techniques such as LA-ICP-MS, GD-MS and secondary ion/neutral mass spectrometry were described and compared. The review also discussed the techniques that may be used to characterise the size, composition and the presence of impurities in colloidal materials. The use of ICP-MS for these purposes, especially when coupled with a chromatographic separation system such as HPLC or field flow fractionation, was assessed.</p>

<span id="sect1303"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">2.3.6.2 Sample preparation and calibration. </span><span>There have been two applications that have investigated the <span class="italic">fundamental aspects of sample preparation and calibration</span>. Clearly, if these are not optimised then inaccurate, insensitive or irreproducible results may be obtained. Decker and colleagues discussed the development of standardised preparation methods for single wall carbon nanotubes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183</span></sup></a> The authors used a variety of analytical techniques including SEM, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV-Vis, ICP-MS, neutron activation analysis, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Raman spectroscopy. The second of the fundamental papers, by Garcia <span class="italic">et al.</span>, addressed the potential problems associated with calibration.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit184"><sup><span class="sup_ref">184</span></sup></a> These authors prepared particles using a low temperature desolvation of mono-disperse micro-droplets of analyte solutions and by nanoparticles in suspensions in argon collected on silicon wafers. The desolvation temperature was found to affect the morphology of the nanoparticles, with spherical ones being formed reproducibly (containing unavoidable contaminants) at 150 °C. However, at 200 °C, relatively stable concave, balloon-like particles of up to three micron in diameter were produced. The Au particles were surrounded by a sheath of contaminants. A lengthy discussion of how the morphology of the particles is related to the ratio of evaporation rate to the analyte diffusion rate was presented. The consequences of both size and morphology of the nanoparticles on how well they can be used for calibration processes for ICP spectrometry were also discussed.</span>
<span id="sect1311"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">2.3.6.3 Analysis of nanoparticles. </span><span>Several papers have been published that have focussed on the analysis of nanoparticles. The most popular of the techniques used appears to have been <span class="italic">LIBS</span>. One example, by Stehrer and colleagues, used LIBS to analyse iron oxide powder.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> A simple powder delivery system was described which enabled analysis of the powder without pre-treatment or fixation. The LA of the loose powder ejected particles and a plasma was generated along the laser beam. Using a flushed nitrogen background, LIBS spectra were obtained by spatially integrated and time-gated measurements. Saha-Boltzmann analysis indicated a plasma temperature of 10250 ± 200 K and an electron number density of 11 ± 3 × 10<small><sup>16</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. Similar figures were obtained from a LIBS plasma formed from a pressed pellet of the same material. Calibration curves for Al, Mn, Ni and Si impurities were obtained yielding LOD of 8, 860, 66 and 15 ppm respectively. Femtosecond LA at 400 and 800 nm and both far- and near-field processing of silicon enabled chemical analysis at the nanoscale.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">185</span></sup></a> By tightly focussing the laser beam in the far-field, Zorba <span class="italic">et al.</span> produced craters in the sub-micron range. The crater size was decreased further (to &lt;30 nm) by performing experiments in the near-field through sub-wavelength apertures. The authors attempted to study the minimum crater diameter that could be used to obtain reliable spectral information. According to the authors, the sub-micron craters that could be used were amongst the lowest reported for femtosecond LIBS. A combination of LIBS and a scanning mobility particle sizer has been used by Amodeo and co-workers to determine nanometric and sub-nanometric physicochemical characteristics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit186"><sup><span class="sup_ref">186</span></sup></a> The coupling of the two instruments was designed to be used for workplace surveillance in industries that produce nanoparticle-based materials. This is because the risk of accidental release is substantial, even though significant research has been undertaken into methods of securing the processes. A technique that can be used <span class="italic">in-situ</span> and in real time is therefore very attractive since it would minimise the risk to the workforce of prolonged exposure. A study of the dependence of the LIBS signal on the particle size generated was undertaken using particles as small in size as 1 pm produced by two different particle size generators. Figures of merit such as repeatability and LOD were discussed. It was noted that large time delays for the LIBS signal emergence was observed for samples that had a low particle concentration. Another publication to discuss particle sizes and the relationship with LIBS signal was prepared by Asgill and Hahn.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit187"><sup><span class="sup_ref">187</span></sup></a> Temporal evolution of Si emission from particles ranging from 2.47 to 4.09 μm was evaluated using discrete delay times after plasma initiation of between 15 and 70 μs. Analyte signal was approximately constant regardless of the delay time, indicating that further vaporisation and analyte excitation was not obtained at higher delay times. It was concluded that although some recent studies had indicated that the temporal component of analyte response was extremely important for quantitative LIBS analysis, the present study seemed to demonstrate that an upper particle size limit of between 2 and 2.5 μm was necessary to obtain maximum emission from silica microspheres.</span><p class="otherpara">Several other methods have been described that have been used to analyse nanoparticles. A simple method for the quantitative determination of Au nanoparticles was described by Allabashi and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit188"><sup><span class="sup_ref">188</span></sup></a> After optimisation of the experimental conditions, it was found that <span class="italic">Au particles in the size range of 5 to 20 nm</span> could be determined by direct aspiration into an ICP-MS instrument. The data obtained were compared with those obtained using aspiration of an acid digestion of the same material. It was noted, however, that the sample diluent for the slurry method affected the results significantly. Recovery for the Au in the slurry was 93–95% when trisodium citrate was used, but this dropped to 80% when water was used. The LOD was 0.15 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Au, which corresponded to a slurry concentration of 4.4 × 10<small><sup>9</sup></small> Au particles L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (assuming a mean particle size of 15 nm). No difference in analytical quality was observed over the particle size range studied. Another paper to investigate a method of size characterisation has been prepared by Tiede <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit189"><sup><span class="sup_ref">189</span></sup></a> This paper described the coupling of hydrodynamic chromatography (a technique that separates particles in the range 5–300 nm) with ICP-MS detection. A range of Au nanoparticles was first prepared that were sterically stabilised to prevent agglomeration and could be used as external size calibration standards. A study was then undertaken in which Ag nanoparticles were spiked into sewage sludge. Using their coupled instrumentation, the authors demonstrated that a fraction of the Ag nanoparticles survived as single particles in the supernatant. This study was then extended to several other nanoparticle types (titania, silica, alumina and iron III oxide). It was concluded that the coupling of the chromatography system with an ICP-MS instrument used in collision cell mode, could be used to study the environmental fate of these nanoparticle types. The system had the advantages of requiring little sample pre-treatment and being able to analyse samples in the fairly wide range of 5–300 nm in less than 10 min.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Choi and colleagues utilised LA-TOF-MS to achieve isotopic analysis <span class="italic">of metallic and coated nanoparticles</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit190"><sup><span class="sup_ref">190</span></sup></a> Particles of gadolinium oxide, nickel, palladium and silica coated with gadolinium were used in the study. A frequency doubled Nd:YAG laser (λ = 532 nm) was used for ablation. Analysis of the Gd coated silica particles indicated that the Gd isotopic abundance was in accordance with the natural ratio. The result is impressive, since the analyte was present at a concentration of 50 ng per particle. The authors noted though that the plates used to load the samples had a significant effect on analytical sensitivity, with tantalum and copper plates giving greater sensitivity than a zinc plate.</p>
<p class="otherpara">According to Alberts <span class="italic">et al.</span> the development of highly ordered and self-assembled magnetic nanostructures is arousing increasing interest. Analysis of them is necessary to ensure manufacturing quality and to assist in the optimisation of the filling procedure.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit191"><sup><span class="sup_ref">191</span></sup></a> Both insulating and conducting materials may be analysed directly using the technique of <span class="italic">GD</span>-<span class="italic">OES</span>. In addition, the technique can also be used for depth-profiling analysis. These authors applied it to the analysis of self-aligned titania nanotubes and self-ordered nanoporous alumina filled with arrays of metallic and magnetic nanowires. The results of the analyses were compared with those obtained using SEM-EDX and the overall conclusion was that GD-OES was a promising technique for such applications.</p>
<p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">X</span>-<span class="italic">ray techniques</span> have been used by several workers for the analysis of nanostructures. The high sensitivity offered by TXRF, along with grazing incidence X-ray standing waves (GIXSW) has been utilised by von Bohlen and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit192"><sup><span class="sup_ref">192</span></sup></a> The influence of coherence length of X-rays from different X-ray sources, the particle form, particle size and distribution were all discussed. Theoretical results obtained through simulations were compared with experimental data. The advantages and limitations of the techniques were discussed for the characterisation of gold and cadmium telluride nanoparticles. Results obtained using TXRF for the determination of Ru and Se that had been impregnated into carbon nanotubes have been evaluated by Fernandez-Ruiz and co-workers who also used ICP-MS to validate the results.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit193"><sup><span class="sup_ref">193</span></sup></a> Acid leaching of the particulates for ICP-MS analysis yielded results, especially for Ru, that deviated by up to 50% and this was attributed to poor/irreproducible recovery during the acid leaching process. A method by which the particulates were introduced to the ICP-MS instrument as a suspension was therefore developed. A suspension was also used for the TXRF analysis. The particulates were kept in suspension using ultrasonic pulses with the homogeneity being checked using SEM and the particle size distribution determined using dynamic light scattering. This latter parameter was found to have a large effect for both the TXRF and ICP-MS measurements. For the TXRF, the nominal concentration determined was unaffected, but the uncertainty varied significantly. Under optimal conditions the TXRF yielded uncertainty values of 5.9 and 2.9% for Ru and Se respectively.</p>

<span>There has been another increase in the number (and quality) of nuclear applications in this review period. As well as the usual selection of environmental studies, several forensic/nuclear safeguard applications have also been reported. There has also been an increase in the number of isotopes that can be determined using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS).</span>
<div><span id="sect1349"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.4.1 Forensic/nuclear safeguard applications. </span><span>The general area of nuclear safeguards and forensics requires a variety of techniques and approaches. One such area is the detection and isotopic analysis of <span class="italic">small actinide particles</span> on swabs and in wide area environmental surveillance samples.</span><p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry</span> (SIMS) for the isotopic analysis of single particles of actinide materials is an accepted approach and the dependence of the precision of isotopic determinations on particle diameter has been investigated by Esaka and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit194"><sup><span class="sup_ref">194</span></sup></a> Particles of various diameters were selected by SEM, transferred to a glassy carbon planchette using a manipulator and the isotopic composition determined. For small particles (&lt;1 μm diameter), the precision of the isotopic determinations degraded as the number of measurement cycles increased. This was presumably due to erosion of these small particles. This effect was not observed for larger particles (&gt;2 μm). Consequently, it was estimated that to obtain a precision of better than 5% RSD for <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U ratios, at least 4.5 fg of <small><sup>235</sup></small>U was required. For minor isotope ratios (<span class="italic">vs.</span><small><sup>238</sup></small>U), a precision of better than 20% RSD was obtained from 0.42 fg of <small><sup>234</sup></small>U and 1.1 fg of <small><sup>236</sup></small>U.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">Laser Ablation</span> in conjunction with MC-ICP-MS was used to determine the isotopic composition of uranium oxide particles separated from environmental samples (soils and dusts) collected from the vicinity of a factory producing uranium articles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit195"><sup><span class="sup_ref">195</span></sup></a> A total of 115 grains were analysed and all were shown to have isotopic ratios consistent with depleted U. The precision of the measurement of <small><sup>235</sup></small>U/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U ratios was assessed by the analysis of natural uranite grains and shown to be 0.2% RSD (using two sigma). A different approach using LA coupled to laser-based atomic absorption to determine isotope ratios of individual micron-sized particles was demonstrated for a <small><sup>152</sup></small>Gd:<small><sup>160</sup></small>Gd system by Bushaw and Anheier.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit196"><sup><span class="sup_ref">196</span></sup></a> In this instrument, two diode lasers were tuned to isotope specific transitions at 405.9 nm (<small><sup>152</sup></small>Gd) and 413.4 nm (<small><sup>160</sup></small>Gd) and directed co-linearly through a LA plume before being wavelength separated on a diffraction grating and detected simultaneously using a pair of photodiodes. The transient atomic absorption signal was detected on a shot to shot basis. The system was tested using Gd foils and mixtures of Gd chloride with isotope ratios (<small><sup>152</sup></small>Gd/<small><sup>160</sup></small>Gd) varying between 0.01 and 0.43. The latter materials were diluted with a river sediment CRM (SRM 435013) to simulate an environmental sample. The system was shown to be capable of detecting a few highly enriched particles in the presence of &gt;100 fold excess of low enrichment material, at trace levels of these particles in the solid diluent (0.08%) and when widely dispersed (1178 particles in 800000 laser ablation shots). The possibility of measuring U enrichment of particles in samples derived from air sampling activities was discussed.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy</span> (LIBS) to detect U in bulk samples was investigated by Chinni <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit197"><sup><span class="sup_ref">197</span></sup></a> Spectra were obtained under a variety of conditions (air, vacuum, argon) and all exhibited high backgrounds arising from unresolved U emission. The spectra were partially simplified by optimising detector gate delays and the most appropriate line selected in the spectral range 260–800 nm. Double pulse techniques were also tested and shown to enhance detection of U in some cases. A detection limit of U in soil of 0.26% m/m was obtained for a close coupled system and 0.5% m/m obtained for a stand-off system (30 m). Detection of surface contamination was also demonstrated and shown to be dependant upon the substrate with detection limits varying between 13 and 150 μg cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. The potential for LIBS in detecting U residues on surfaces as a tool for the detection of illicit activities was discussed.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The provision of low level materials suitable for the estimation of procedural blanks is important in the detection of illicit activities/safeguards to demonstrate the significance and ultimate reliability of the measurements.

<p class="otherpara">Although most of the nuclear forensics have concentrated on the determination of actinides, other approaches may offer insights into the age of particles. The techniques of SIMS, SEM-EDX and Raman spectroscopy were used by Kips and co-workers to characterise uranium oxyfluoride particles and the effect of environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, light) on these particles assessed.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit199"><sup><span class="sup_ref">199,200</span></sup></a> Although considerable variation was observed for particles from nominally the same sample, general trends were observed with respect to loss of F.

<p class="otherpara">The determination of the “age” of radioactive materials, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the <span class="italic">time since chemical separation and purification</span>, is not limited to special nuclear materials and is of importance for other radionuclides packaged as sealed sources.

One has a relatively low level of the analytes Cd, Cr, Hg and Pb in polypropylene (GBW 08404), whereas the other has higher concentrations (GBW 08405).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit237"><sup><span class="sup_ref">237</span></sup></a> The authors of the report, Feng <span class="italic">et al.</span> described how the materials had been prepared by doping blank materials with the analytes in the form of oxides, salts or pigments. The concentrations of the analytes were determined by microwave assisted digestion followed by ID-MS detection. Concentrations of the analytes were in the range 8–1000 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The two materials were then used in an inter-laboratory comparison in which the national metrology institutes of China, Japan and Korea participated. The results of this exercise demonstrated that the certified values were both accurate and reliable. The same analytes in polypropylene were also determined during an inter-laboratory comparison organised by the Inorganic Analysis Working Group of the Comité Consultatif pour la Quantité de Matière. The study was coded CCQM-P106. Ma and co-workers described this work in which 21 laboratories participated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit238"><sup><span class="sup_ref">238</span></sup></a> The majority of the participants used microwave assisted digestion of the samples as a means of sample preparation, but a variety of analysis techniques were employed including ICP-MS, ICP-OES, ID-MS, AAS, INAA and XRF. Analytical agreement between the participants was reported to be good with results obtained using ID-MS showing particularly good precision. Another inter-laboratory comparison organised by CCQM (CCQM-P114) involved eight national metrology institutes and tested their ability to determine five selected congeners from brominated flame retardants.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit239"><sup><span class="sup_ref">239</span></sup></a> A candidate polypropylene reference material that had been fortified with penta-, octa- and deca-bromodiphenyl ether and deca-bromobiphenyl was used as the study material. The participants in the study used a variety of sample preparation methods and analytical techniques to determine the compounds. The analytical techniques included GC with electron capture detection, GC-MS, GC-MS in the electron capture negative ionisation mode, (GC-ECNI-MS) and LC-ICP-MS. The precision between laboratories was adequate (∼5% RSD) for many of the species, but for compound BDE 206, a precision of 28.5% RSD was obtained.</span><p class="otherpara">Mahoney has prepared a <span class="italic">review</span> of the use of cluster SIMS for characterising polymeric materials (241 refs).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit240"><sup><span class="sup_ref">240</span></sup></a> According to Mahoney, the technique has played a critical role in characterisation studies because it has the ability to obtain spatially resolved surface and in-depth molecular information. The advent of C-60<small><sup>+</sup></small>, Au<small><sup>3+</sup></small>, SF<small><sup>5+</sup></small> and Bi<small><sup>3+</sup></small> ions as primary ions has yielded significantly higher yields of secondary ion signals compared with the more traditional primary ions Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small>, Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> or Ga<small><sup>+</sup></small>. Depth-profiling studies have also been facilitated using these new ions because the signal does not decay as rapidly as when the more simple species are used. The review discussed the advantages of using cluster ions and described the fundamental processes that occur during the analysis. A review by Belenguer and colleagues focussed on the use of pulsed glow discharges for analytical applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit241"><sup><span class="sup_ref">241</span></sup></a> The review (146 refs) was split into two parts with the first focussing on the physical processes occurring during the plasma ignition and the afterglow whereas the second part reviewed the applications using both OES and MS as detection systems. The advantages of the pulsed GD were discussed and the first results of the application of the technique to surface and interface analysis of multi-layers were given.</p>

<div><span id="sect1746"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.1.2 Fundamental techniques. </span><span>Polymers are another class of material that can be difficult to bring into solution without recourse to powerful acids and/or harsh digestion conditions. Many applications therefore utilise techniques that are capable of analysing solid materials directly. Some of the more advanced techniques can even achieve depth-profiling studies.</span><p class="otherpara">Resano and co-workers have compared <span class="italic">line source and continuum source instrumentation</span> for the determination of Hg in polymers using the technique of solid sampling GFAAS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit242"><sup><span class="sup_ref">242</span></sup></a> The authors used eight CRMs (which included polyethylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and acrlyonitrile butadiene styrene) that had a Hg content in the range 20–1100 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The results showed conclusively the advantages of the continuous source instrumentation. Both instrument types required the use of an argon flow during the atomisation stage but when aqueous standards were used for calibration the line source instrumentation succeeded only in the quantitative analysis of polyethylene and PVC. The continuum source instrument obtained satisfactory results for all sample types and the authors attributed this to the higher potential for the correction of high and rapidly changing background signals. In addition, the figures of merit were significantly better for continuum source instrumentation with LOD being 0.6 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> compared with 2.2 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, linear range covering 10–320 ng of Hg compared with 20–200 ng and the sensitivity also experiencing a marginal improvement compared with line source instrumentation.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Fliegel and Gunther have described the use of a laser ablation particle beam glow discharge TOF-MS (LA-PB-GD-TOF-MS) instrument for the analysis of halogenated polymers and other inorganic materials (glass and metal).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit243"><sup><span class="sup_ref">243</span></sup></a> Particles in the size range of 1 to 3000 μm in diameter were able to be analysed although the authors did stress that the glass and metallic samples were not analysed successfully. They attributed this to the low gas temperature of the helium pulsed GD being incapable of vaporising particles with a high vaporisation or melting point. In contrast, the soft polymers PVC and PTFE yielded excellent results and gave signals for C, Cl, F and H. Molecules such as C<small><sub>x</sub></small>H<small><sub>v</sub></small>F<small><sub>y</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> and C<small><sub>x</sub></small>H<small><sub>v</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>y</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> were also identified and enabled a fingerprint of the polymer to be made. An investigation into the influence of laser fluence and glow discharge voltage was also undertaken.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">use of LIBS</span> has continued to increase. Weidman and colleagues used a double pulse system employing a Nd:YAG and then a carbon dioxide laser to analyse polystyrene films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit244"><sup><span class="sup_ref">244</span></sup></a> The double pulse system yielded an enhanced emission signal compared with a single pulse system using a Nd:YAG laser alone. The double pulse system was then applied to the residues of 2,4,6 trinitrotoluene. A double pulse system has also been discussed by Pal <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used a 266 nm laser to form a plasma and a 10.6 μm carbon dioxide laser pulse to enhance the signal by several orders of magnitude.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a> The system was applied to the standoff analysis (at distances of up to 55 m) of polymers, ceramics and metals. The temperature of the plasma was also measured and was found to increase by 3000 K when the second laser pulse was used. Another fundamental study of LIBS has been produced by Boueri and co-workers who studied the absorption of laser energy by the plasma during its early stage expansion and discussed how this influences the properties of the plasma and its interaction with ambient air.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit246"><sup><span class="sup_ref">246</span></sup></a> These interactions can lead to problems with recombination reactions that give rise to light emission at wavelengths that may interfere with those from the analytes. The authors studied the analysis of nylon and compared the use of IR laser pulses (1064 nm) with UV laser pulses (266 nm) under a nanosecond ablation regime. A comparison between nanosecond and femtosecond ablation was also made. It was found that in the femtosecond regime, these post-ablation reactions were absent. Jasik and co-workers used a vacuum UV LIBS system employing a F<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser with a wavelength of 157 nm, a laser pulse duration of 20 ns, a pulse energy of 50 mJ and a repetition rate of 10 Hz for the analysis of polyethylene.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit247"><sup><span class="sup_ref">247</span></sup></a> The spectrometer was capable of measuring down to a wavelength of 115 nm. The LOD was 50 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for S and 215 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Zn. The plasma formed during the process produced a very high emission signal from both neutral and ionised C and these wavelengths were used to determine the electronic temperature of the plasma (T<small><sub>e</sub></small>). This was achieved using the Saha-Boltzmann plot in which the electron density, derived from the broadening of the hydrogen H-alpha line, was also estimated.</p>
<p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">X</span>-<span class="italic">ray techniques</span> have also been studied. Nakano and Tsuji discussed the development of a laboratory confocal 3D XRF spectrometer which they used for non-destructive depth-profiling analysis of layered plastic materials and environmental samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit248"><sup><span class="sup_ref">248</span></sup></a> Some layered reference materials were prepared by using a spin-coating technique and these layered samples were then used to confirm the depth-profiling capability of the instrument. Three dimensional μ-XRF spectrometry has been used by Schaumann and colleagues to determine analytes in layered polymer systems.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit249"><sup><span class="sup_ref">249</span></sup></a> It was found that in a light matrix the interference effects from the matrix were minimised. Polymer layer systems comprising single layers of ethylene-polypropylene-diene rubber filled with changing concentrations of silica and zinc oxide were constructed. Other techniques including IR microscopy, optical microscopy, ICP-OES and scanning μ-XRF were used on the individual layers/components to verify layer thickness and composition. The results from the 3D-μ-XRF system were then compared with data from these independent methods. Agreement was close enough for the authors to conclude that method validity for their system had been demonstrated. Paynter has produced two papers that reported the utilisation of angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) for depth-profiling analysis of plasma-oxidised polystyrene.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit250"><sup><span class="sup_ref">250,251</span></sup></a> In the first of the applications, the data obtained were evaluated using both a 3-parameter and a 10-parameter depth-profile model with and without regularisation. The partially regularised 3-parameter model yielded comparable results to the fully regularised 10-parameter model, but used only one fifteenth of the computing power. In the second of the applications,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251</span></sup></a> polystyrene films were exposed to nitrogen plasmas for periods of up to eight minutes. The analytes N and O were determined using ARXPS and the depth-profiles fitted using a regularised multi-point linear segment model. The N profile was found to vary according to the duration of exposure to the nitrogen plasma whereas the O profile was more uniform.</p>

The different sample preparation methods compared included oxygen flask combustion, microwave induced combustion (MIC) and microwave extraction using water or an alkaline solution. For the MIC procedure, 50 mM ammonium carbonate was used as the absorbing solution. Detection of the analytes Br and Cl was achieved using ion chromatography, ICP-OES and ICP-MS. Accuracy was evaluated using CRMs as well as a comparison of results with those obtained using a neutron activation technique. Both the oxygen flask combustion method and MIC (using 5 mins of reflux) led to agreement of better than 95% for both Br and Cl compared with neutron activation although the precision for MIC was superior to the oxygen flask decomposition method (5 and 20% RSD respectively). The microwave assisted extraction proved to be less efficient and led to only 45% extraction efficiency being achieved.</span><p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">leaching of Sb</span> from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into still and sparkling mineral waters as a function of time, temperature and light conditions has been assessed by Keresztes and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> The total Sb content of the packing material was first determined using SF-ICP-MS as a means of detection, and concentrations of between 250 and 290 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were found. In general, leaching was found to be greater in sparkling water. For experiments that varied the storage conditions (storage time of 10–950 days, temperature 22–70 °C and illumination ranging from dark to 23 W lamp for 116 h) the amount of Sb leached was occasionally found to exceed 2 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. It was noted, however, that the Sb leached could vary by an order of magnitude using the same conditions but by using different brands of water. The authors came to the overall conclusion that the selection of the polymer used for the production of the PET bottle ensured that low Sb levels were leached into the water under all conditions. Jiang and co-workers have also addressed the issue of determination of Sb in food packaging materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit254"><sup><span class="sup_ref">254</span></sup></a> Cloud point extraction followed by GFAAS was used to determine both Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> and Sb<small><sup>V</sup></small> (the latter being determined indirectly, by subtraction from total Sb concentration). A hydrophobic complex of Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> with ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) at pH 5 was formed and this entered the surfactant rich phase. The Sb<small><sup>V</sup></small> on the other hand, remained in the aqueous phase. The Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> was diluted with 0.2 mL of nitric acid in methanol (0.1 M) prior to determination using GFAAS. The Sb<small><sup>V</sup></small> was reduced to the Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> form by the addition of cysteine and then “total” Sb could be determined. Parameters such as pH, concentrations of APDC and of Triton X-114, equilibration temperature and time and the sample volume were all optimised. Under optimal conditions, a LOD of 0.02 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> Sb<small><sup>III</sup></small> was obtained with a precision at a concentration level of 10 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> being 7.8% RSD.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">use of LIBS</span> for the determination of Ba, Cd, Cr and Pb in toys has been reported by Godoi and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit255"><sup><span class="sup_ref">255</span></sup></a> The LIBS system used a Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm, an echelle spectrometer and an intensified CCD detector. Operating conditions such as number of pulses, delay time, integration time gate and pulse energy were optimised using a Doehlert design. Results of the analyses were found to correlate “reasonably well” with those obtained using a microwave assisted digestion prior to an ICP-OES analysis. The conclusion was that LIBS produced sufficiently accurate results to act as a rapid screening method for the identification of potentially toxic elements in toys.</p>

<h3 id="sect1829"><span class="b_heading">3.2 Semiconductors, superconductors and electronic materials</span></h3>
<span>The number of applications in this research area continues to be substantial with numerous groups making products in the hope of finding a more efficient material. The reliability and yield of such materials depends greatly on the presence of impurities (especially at the surface). The analysis of these materials therefore requires characterisation using atomic spectrometric techniques that should, ideally, be highly sensitive and specific. Many research groups have used SIMS (and other techniques) to elucidate mechanistic aspects of how the materials work or why they exhibit their characteristics. These papers are numerous and although they may describe the development of novel products, they do not advance the knowledge of atomic spectrometry. As such, they will not be discussed further in this review. Instead, those papers that discuss some new method of analysis or advance the use of existing methods will be described. One aspect that is evident is that the electronics industry is one of the driving factors behind instrument manufacturing companies striving to produce ever more sensitive instrumentation that is also capable of analysis at increased depth or spatial resolution.</span>

A paper by Erko and Zizak described the use of “hard” X-ray techniques at the Berliner Elektronenspeicherring für Synchrotronstrahlung II (BESSYII) that are capable of micro- and nanometer spatial resolution.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit261"><sup><span class="sup_ref">261</span></sup></a> Techniques such as μ-XRF, micro-extended X-ray absorption fine structure (μ-EXAFS), micro-X-ray absorption near edge structure (μ-XANES) as well as X-ray standing wave (XSW) and X-ray beam induced current (XBIC) used in conjunction with μ-XRF were all discussed since they are powerful synchrotron-based methods capable of characterising both organic and inorganic materials. Using mono- and polycapillary optical systems it was possible to focus X-rays down to 1 pm spot size with monochromatic and white synchrotron radiation. Polycapillary-based confocal detection enabled μ-XRF to obtain volume resolution of 3.4 × 10<small><sup>−6</sup></small> mm<small><sup>3</sup></small>. Standing wave excitation and waveguides used with μ-EXAFS enabled a depth resolution of approximately 1 nm. The paper discussed several applications of such techniques for both biological materials and metal-semiconductor interfaces. Another paper that has discussed the use of a multitude of X-ray-based techniques has been prepared by Trushin and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit262"><sup><span class="sup_ref">262</span></sup></a> These workers deliberately contaminated block cast multi-crystalline silicon with impurities and then determined these impurities' interactions using XBIC, μ-XRF and μ-X-ray absorption spectroscopy (μ-XAS). The silicon nitride (Si<small><sub>3</sub></small>N<small><sub>4</sub></small>) and silicon carbide (SiC) particles found at the upper part of the multi-crystalline blocks were found to act as sinks for Cu and Fe impurities with the Fe being equally distributed between the two types of sink whereas the Cu precipitated in significantly larger quantities at the silicon carbide inclusions rather than at the silicon nitride rods. The copper precipitates were identified as being copper rich silicides. Annealing at 950 °C, that is known to increase the presence of oxygen, was also found to enhance the formation of iron disilicide particles both in the grains and at the grain boundaries.</span><p class="otherpara">Two research groups have discussed the use of <span class="italic">grazing incidence</span>-<span class="italic">XRF</span> (GIXRF). Two papers by a German group have discussed the necessity of using GIXRF as a complementary depth-profiling technique to SIMS since the latter technique is beginning to struggle to achieve the resolution required for ultra-shallow junction applications in complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technologies.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263,264</span></sup></a> In one of these papers,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> the authors discussed how GIXRF used in conjunction with XSW on flat samples may be used as a tuneable sensor to obtain information about the implantation profile. This possibility arises because the in-depth changes in XSW intensity are dependent on the angle of incident radiation. Silicon wafers implanted with either As or B at different fluences and implantation energies were used as the samples and the results obtained for the depth-profiles compared with those obtained using SIMS. The GIXRF measurements were obtained using monochromatised undulator radiation of well characterised radiant power and spectral purity. Use of an “absolutely calibrated energy dispersive detector” for the acquisition of the B (K-alpha) and As (L-alpha) radiation enabled the determination of the total retained dose of impurity. Depth-profiles were obtained by using calculations and by comparison with the angular measurements of the XRF. In the second of the two papers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> soft GIXRF was used as a comparative technique for SIMS that used an ultra-low energy oxygen ion beam (0.35–0.5 keV) to characterise ultra-low energy (0.2–3 keV) B implants in single crystalline silicon. The SIMS analysis utilised an approach whereby the primary beam oblique incidence and ultra-high vacuum analysis atmosphere were investigated because it was expected that they would provide better accuracy of the B profile, especially in the region between the surface and the native oxide/substrate interface. Roughening of the surface of the crater usually poses a problem with SIMS analyses, but the authors largely overcame these problems by rotating the sample during the ion sputtering process. This led to decreased roughness and improved erosion rate stability. This, in turn, led to a more accurate depth-profile being obtained. A third application to use GIXRF has been reported by de Carvalho and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265</span></sup></a> These workers used the technique alongside theoretical calculations to evaluate the interactions between Au and Cu atoms and the clean silicon surface. Using optimised conditions, in terms of geometries and energies, on different adsorption sites indicated that the binding energies were very high; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> that there was a strong interaction between the metals and the surface silicon. There was good agreement between the results of theoretical calculations and the experimental data with both indicating that the Au interaction with Si was greater than that of the Cu.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The related technique of <span class="italic">grazing emission XRF</span> that uses synchrotron radiation excitation has been discussed in two papers by a joint Polish, Swiss and French consortium.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266,267</span></sup></a> The ultra-low level Al impurities on a silicon surface were determined using high resolution grazing emission-XRF. By observing the Al K-alpha line in the resonant Raman-scattering background-free region and by choosing an appropriate beam energy below the silicon absorption edge, an Al impurity level of 10<small><sup>12</sup></small> atoms cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> was determined. By combining the two techniques of grazing emission-XRF and vapour phase decomposition, the authors managed to detect Al at a concentration of 10<small><sup>7</sup></small> atoms cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. It was therefore concluded that the technique was a very sensitive method of determining the morphology of surface nanostructures.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Several other X-ray-based techniques have been described in the literature.

The authors compared the experimental results with data obtained using relativistic and non-relativistic theoretical calculations. This was, reportedly, the first time that the linear differential scattering coefficients have been determined using an energy of &lt;100 keV and so the findings could not be compared with any results in the literature.</p>
<p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">X</span>-<span class="italic">ray absorption fine structure</span> (XAFS) was used by Yamazaki and colleagues to characterise the local structure around shallow As implants in silicon.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">269</span></sup></a> A high brilliance synchrotron radiation beam from an in-vacuum type undulator was evaluated for obtaining the fluorescence yield. In addition, the performance of both a wavelength dispersive spectrometer and an energy dispersive spectrometer based on a silicon drift detector were evaluated. The wavelength dispersive spectrometer gave a superior performance in terms of reduced scattered background signal (because of the higher spectral resolution) and a higher counting rate. The use of XAFS using undulator X-rays with a wavelength dispersive spectrometer enabled very sensitive measurements to be made.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Although SIMS is generally regarded as being one of the best methods of depth-profiling and, because of its high sensitivity and large dynamic range, a very suitable method for the direct measurement of dopants; it does suffer from some drawbacks.

Numerous papers have been discussed in the literature that reported the use of SIMS to characterise newly prepared materials. These papers therefore reported the routine use of SIMS and will not be discussed at any length in this review. Instead, papers that used different primary ions or abnormal operating conditions, or reported novel methods of analysis, will be discussed in greater detail.</span>

The use of caesium or argon primary ions was found to desorb the deuterium into the vacuum chamber. The use of oxygen primary ions yielded very different results compared with those obtained using caesium or argon ions. In addition, the data were also found to be dependent on the incidence angle of the oxygen ions. Berghmans and Vandevorst studied the effects of oxygen flooding on the ultra-low energy SIMS depth-profiling of silicon using a caesium primary ion beam.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit272"><sup><span class="sup_ref">272</span></sup></a> The sputtering yield of Si was found to be extremely sensitive to minute amounts of added oxygen. At the concentration range of oxygen added (10<small><sup>−9</sup></small>–10<small><sup>−8</sup></small> mbar) the increase in Si yield could not be explained through the full oxidation. The authors proposed a mechanism whereby the oxygen becomes adsorbed to the surface and that the presence of this oxygen provides sites for the caesium ions to become attached, hence increasing the retention capacity significantly. In addition, the presence of the oxygen promoted desorption of Si from the surface, increasing the secondary ion yield. Jiang and Sieloff have described a novel method of determining the thickness of ultra-thin silica films by using dynamic SIMS determinations with a primary ion beam of oxygen.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit273"><sup><span class="sup_ref">273</span></sup></a> Previous methods have experienced difficulties when measuring the thickness of such films with accuracy when they are below 2 nm. The method reported in this paper used a <small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> primary beam and then detected <small><sup>18</sup></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> as the secondary ion for silica. The matrix effect from a silicon/silica/silicon stack was proved to be eliminated and the high ion yield of <small><sup>18</sup></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> and negligible interference from <small><sup>16</sup></small>OH<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> meant that the total O in the film could be measured with good sensitivity and accuracy. The assumption was that the silicon oxide was stoichiometric (a reasonable assumption since these materials are grown with dry oxidation), so converting the O signal into a measurement of SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> thickness was straightforward. The angular distribution of As and Ga sputtered from gallium arsenide (1 0 0) by a caesium ion beam under different impact energy (2–10 keV) and angle of incidence (30–60°) was measured by Verdeil <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit274"><sup><span class="sup_ref">274</span></sup></a> The angular distributions of emitted matter were determined by means of depth-profiles. The emitted matter was found to be sputtered preferentially in the direction of the ion beam with other ions scattered around this angle. It was noted though that the amount of As and Ga was not uniform at all angles. A decrease in the As/Ga ratio was observed around the direction of preferential emission and this was found to increase for oblique emission for different conditions of primary bombardment. It was concluded that, since the angular distribution depends on the depth of origin, the bombardment of the sample with caesium ions changes the stoichiometry of the near surface layers. The As was enriched in the outermost layers and, because of its preferential sputtering, it was impoverished at lower layers. A quantitative SIMS method for determining very high concentrations of B (up to 20%) in silicon using an <span class="italic">isotopic comparative method</span> has been described by Dubois and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit275"><sup><span class="sup_ref">275</span></sup></a> The method was based on the simultaneous measurement of two different isotopes (<small><sup>10</sup></small>B and <small><sup>11</sup></small>B) where the concentration of the first isotope (which is present at far lower concentration than the other) is determined and then the concentration of the second isotope calculated accordingly. Both argon and oxygen were tested for use as the primary ion beam but it was found that at an energy of 8 keV, the oxygen beam led to significant matrix interference effects. These were found to be almost absent when an argon beam of the same energy was used.</span>
<span id="sect1907"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">3.2.2.2 TOF-SIMS analyses. </span><span>The technique of <span class="italic">TOF</span>-<span class="italic">SIMS</span> has high sensitivity giving a high yield of secondary ions whilst providing lateral resolution at the sub-micron level. In many studies though, it is still used as a qualitative or semi-quantitative tool. Static TOF-SIMS has been used by Ravanel and co-workers for the analysis of micro-electronic devices in two publications.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit276"><sup><span class="sup_ref">276,277</span></sup></a> In the first of these, the authors discussed the use of relative sensitivity factors to convert the normalised ion intensities into reliable concentration data. Samples deliberately contaminated with the anionic species Br, Cl, P and S were analysed using TOF-SIMS and the results compared with those obtained using other established surface analytical techniques (TXRF, vapour phase decomposition ICP-MS and liquid phase extraction ion chromatography). The TOF-SIMS method was found to provide more reliable and precise data than any of the other techniques for all of the analytes studied and hence also proved to be more versatile. In the second of the two papers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit277"><sup><span class="sup_ref">277</span></sup></a> several multi-nuclear primary ions (Au<small><sub>n</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>, SF<small><sup>5+</sup></small>, Bi<small><sub>n</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> or C<small><sub>60</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>), that had previously shown distinct advantages compared with mono-atomic sources such as gallium, were used for the analysis of micro-electronic components. The influence of the number of atoms in the primary cluster ion on the formation of the secondary ions was first determined by analysing samples of di-isononyl phthalate and perfluoropolyether. It was noted that a drastic increase in secondary ions was produced and hence a lower LOD was obtained when using a polyatomic primary ion. The yield of the higher mass species was also enhanced indicating that there was less fragmentation. This led to the conclusion that either the energy of the primary ions is spread more evenly or that there is a lower energy per incoming ion. A multi-nuclear bismuth ion was used to bombard a reference thermally grown silicon oxide sample. The amount of information depth provided was decreased with increasing number of bismuth atoms in the primary ion cluster. Molecular depth-profiling of multi-layer structures composed of organic semiconductor materials using large argon cluster primary ions has been reported by Ninomiya and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit278"><sup><span class="sup_ref">278</span></sup></a> Materials such as tris(8-hydroxyquinoline)aluminium and 4,4′-bis(N-(1-naphthyl)-N-phenylamino)biphenyl were analysed using a linear type TOF mass spectrometer with Ar<small><sub>700</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ions at an energy of 5.5 keV being used as primary ions. The interfaces between the organic layers were clearly distinguished. The effect of temperature on the diffusion in these samples was also studied using the cluster argon primary ions.

The metal with the greatest emission was Zn, with approximately 6.5% of the total present in the battery being emitted. Other components present at high concentration in the battery (Fe and Mn) were found to have negligible emission. The volatile element Hg potentially provided the greatest problem, because it was found to be present even in the second bubbler system. A total of 36% of the Cl present in the battery was found in the bubbler system contents. The authors discussed their findings and used thermodynamic calculations to explain the processes occurring. A second paper also considered heavy metal characteristics in batteries.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit287"><sup><span class="sup_ref">287</span></sup></a> On this occasion, waste portable batteries (lithium ion and nickel metal hydride) of the type used in mobile phones were disassembled and the components prepared using EPA method 3050B. The metal (Cd, Co, Cr and Ni) contents were then determined using AAS. The lithium ion batteries contained higher concentrations of Co whereas, unsurprisingly, the nickel metal hydride batteries contained higher concentrations of Ni. In the cathodes of the batteries, both of these analytes were found to exceed the toxicity threshold limit concentration used in toxicity characterisation of solid wastes (Co = 8000 and Ni = 2000 mg/kg), although the printed circuit boards were found to contain less. It was concluded that the batteries should be treated and handled as toxic material and that a well-coordinated strategy for spent batteries is required to prevent release of such high levels of toxic heavy metals to the environment. Torrance and colleagues have investigated the <span class="italic">liquid waste</span> produced from semiconductor wafer processing.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit288"><sup><span class="sup_ref">288</span></sup></a> Waste slurries from gallium arsenide wafer processing at three plants were collected and compared with slurries prepared in the laboratory. The slurries were analysed using ICP-MS for their As and Ga content and the sources of the contaminants identified. The As was found to originate from the wafer thinning process whereas the Ga originated from wafer polishing processes. Slurries obtained after the lapping process were found to contain significantly lower levels of As, but a higher concentration of particulate matter. All of the waste streams were regarded as hazardous because of their As content and also because of their solids content. Treatment was therefore necessary before the material could be discharged or disposed of. It was estimated that a total of 93% of the material is discharged over the entire gallium arsenide manufacturing process; with very little recycling occurring. Although the Ga could, economically, be recovered from the waste streams, the As is usually placed in land-fill waste. The authors made some recommendations for handling the waste. It was emphasised that although the material is disposed of, the amounts of hazardous waste generated is miniscule in comparison with other industries. Nevertheless, sustainable practices are needed to minimise the environmental impact of gallium arsenide manufacture.</p>

The actual amount removed from the surface was calculated by determining the concentration of a major element, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Ca in the digest. A suite of analytes (Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Dy, Er, Mn, Sr, U, Yb and Zn) were determined and all but Zn showed good agreement with certified values, even when a layer only 7 nm thick was analysed. Other analytes could not be determined in a layer this thin, but did provide accurate results when thicker layers (15, 30 and 500 nm) were analysed. The Zn results proved to be high throughout and the authors attributed this to either contamination or to the preferential extraction of Zn when compared with the Ca.</span>

In this review period, two publications have attempted the use of slight variants of the LIBS technique.

Sometimes, a second laser pulse may also be used to excite the analytes in the plasma further so that increased sensitivity can be obtained. In this application, Tereszchuk and colleagues used the LIBS laser to ablate the sample but then used a microsecond pulsed GD to excite the ablated material. This combined approach was reported to offer several advantages including the use of much lower laser energy. If the laser energy used was below the excitation and ionisation threshold, then it could be used solely for the ablation process, which should lead to improved depth resolution. The authors illustrated their technique by comparing the results obtained for the analysis of steel and brass samples using the GD-LIBS system and a standard LIBS setup. In the second application, Surmenko and co-workers used a LIBS system that utilised an axicon optical system for the analysis of thin films.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit296"><sup><span class="sup_ref">296</span></sup></a> An axicon is a specialized type of lens which has a conical surface that images a point source into a line <span class="italic">along</span> the optical axis, or transforms a laser beam into a ring. The axicon system provided a smaller crater depth than that obtained using a standard spherical lens and hence improved depth-resolution could be obtained.

Linear responses for elemental deposits on AP1 film were obtained with standard deviations of 1–40%, depending on the element and the mass deposited, also being obtained. The LOD for Ni ranged from the sub-pg level to the low pg level. The accuracy of this dried spot approach was determined by the analysis of the thin film SRMs NIST 1832 and 1833.

<p class="otherpara">The technique of <span class="italic">grazing incidence XRF</span> (GIXRF) has become one of the most powerful and versatile methods for characterisation of thin film and for layered materials. It combines features of both X-ray reflectivity and conventional XRF and, according to Tiwari and colleagues, it allows the non-destructive evaluation of layer thickness, interface roughness, interlayer formation and depth-profiling of an impurity element.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit303"><sup><span class="sup_ref">303</span></sup></a> These authors developed a computer program that assisted in the characterisation of thin films and surfaces. The program, called CATGIXRF, was discussed in detail and enabled data obtained using GIXRF and by conventional X-ray reflectivity to be analysed simultaneously. The program was applied to the data obtained using both techniques for a variety of thin-layered materials. Erdelyi and co-workers have presented an overview of the work they have undertaken over the last few years which has covered techniques such as X-ray diffraction, GIXRF, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit304"><sup><span class="sup_ref">304</span></sup></a> They also described how GIXRF and EXAFS could be used in conjunction with X-ray standing waves to monitor the growth of the CoSi intermetallic phase by performing <span class="italic">depth</span>-<span class="italic">profile</span> measurements on amorphous silicon/Co/amorphous silicon layers. The sensitivity and accuracy of the measurements were increased by placing the layers on a waveguide structure formed from two tantalum films. Depth resolution at the nanometer scale was obtained. Another group to have achieved depth-profile measurements using GIXRF has reported the analysis of cobalt (indium, gallium) selenide (known as CIGS) semiconductor thin films used in solar cell applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit305"><sup><span class="sup_ref">305</span></sup></a> The varying In to Ga ratio determines the photo-voltaic properties of the thin films and so must be monitored accurately.

Using both experimental data and by using calculations from fundamental atomic parameters, the authors demonstrated that even small differences in the Ga/In profile could be distinguished.

Ever increasing purity of samples means that fewer contaminant atoms must be determined at far lower depth within the sample. Many of the important studies in this review period have reported attempts to improve sensitivity and depth resolution. It has been understood for some time that using a <span class="italic">low energy primary beam</span> improves depth resolution by minimising transient widths and beam-induced mixing. A study by Christofi <span class="italic">et al.</span> used SIMS equipped with a floating energy ion gun that was capable of operating with a primary beam energy in the sub keV region.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit311"><sup><span class="sup_ref">311</span></sup></a> It was also noted that for the most accurate depth-profiles to be obtained, an accurate measure of the depth being sampled was necessary. Traditionally, this measurement has been achieved by measuring the depth of the SIMS crater and then assuming that the sputter rate had been constant throughout. This, clearly, is potentially a significant source of error. In this publication, TEM analysis in conjunction with SIMS was used successfully to depth calibrate a test structure with an error of less than 0.5 nm. The top 5 nm has been problematic for typical SIMS depth-profiling and so this new method has managed to overcome this. Another paper confirming that the use of low energy primary beams leads to improved depth resolution has been reported by Berghmans and co-workers who used caesium ions at ultra-low energies (&lt;150 eV).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> The impact of these extreme conditions on the steady state surface concentration of Cs was determined and discussed.

<h3 id="sect2129"><span class="b_heading">3.3 Glasses</span></h3>
<span>In truth, there have been few really novel papers in the area of glass analysis over this review period. Numerous simple applications have been described but, in general, these have not been reported in this review. It is safe to say that, since glass requires aggressive decomposition/digestion methods for analysis by liquid sampling, virtually all of the papers reported the use of methods capable of analysing the solid material directly. This is especially true for historical or precious glasses, where damage must be kept to an absolute minimum to retain the sample's integrity. Solid sampling techniques are not without their problems though and several papers published have reported methods that have attempted to overcome or circumvent these problems.</span>
<div><span id="sect2133"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.3.1 X-ray techniques. </span><span>Among the most popular ways of analysing solid samples directly are the various forms of X-ray analysis. Two papers have reported methods for the macroscopic composition analysis of <span class="italic">chalcogenide glasses</span> and glassy alloys. In one, Kurganova and co-workers prepared reference samples for calibration by direct elemental synthesis and then used these calibrants for the XRF analysis of As–S–Se, As–S and As–Se glasses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit322"><sup><span class="sup_ref">322</span></sup></a> Results as well as the calibration error were reported. In the second of these applications, Bordovskii and colleagues used XRF to determine the concentrations of As and Se in glass alloys and related films of general formula As<small><sub>100-x</sub></small> − Se<small><sub>x</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit323"><sup><span class="sup_ref">323</span></sup></a> Again, external calibration was used and the samples were analysed with an accuracy of delta X = ±0.002.</span><p class="otherpara">Improvements of the low energy performance of a micro-focus X-ray source for XRF analysis using SEM has been discussed by Procop <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit324"><sup><span class="sup_ref">324</span></sup></a> Until now, the X-ray sources were mounted on the microscope chamber and the X-ray tubes used have been equipped with beryllium windows that are approximately 100 μm thick. In addition the polycapillary X-ray lenses used have a transmission maximum at photon energies of around 10 keV and the transmission drops at both lower and higher energies. Therefore the L-radiation from traditional molybdenum or rhodium targets will be strongly attenuated and hence the excitation of fluorescence in the soft X-ray range becomes far less effective. The work reported in this paper attempted to overcome these problems. A new micro-focus X-ray source was developed that had lower self-absorption in the tube target, much thinner beryllium windows and X-ray optics that had a large distance between the foci and the maximum of transmission (at 5 keV). K-line fluorescence of light elements was therefore excited by the L-radiation from the molybdenum or rhodium tubes targets. The overall improvement in performance enabled Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>O in glass to be determined with a LOD of below 1% m/m.</p>

<div><span id="sect2146"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.3.2 Laser-based techniques. </span><span>A large number of applications have been published that have utilised assorted laser-based techniques for the analysis. Some of the more useful developments have been described only in relatively few papers though and it is these that will be discussed in greater detail.</span><p class="otherpara">A paper by Gornushkin and co-authors described their efforts to improve the performance of a <span class="italic">linear correlation method</span> used for material identification during LIBS analyses.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit325"><sup><span class="sup_ref">325</span></sup></a> The improvement was based on the use of only essential spectral information whilst ignoring empty spectral fragments. The proposed method was tested on glass fragments of forensic interest and enabled 100% identification. Contrarily, the traditional approach fell below 100% for some samples.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Many papers have discussed the use of <span class="italic">laser ablation</span> (LA) as a means of sample introduction to ICP-MS instrumentation. A paper by Hola and colleagues determined the influence of the physical properties and the chemical composition of the sample on the size and composition of the aerosol particles generated by a nanosecond laser operating at 213 nm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit326"><sup><span class="sup_ref">326</span></sup></a> Three sets of samples were investigated, namely cobalt cemented carbides with variable content of W and Co, steel samples with minor variations in elemental content and silica glasses of different colour. The particle number concentration at two different size ranges (10–250 nm and 0.25–17 μm) was measured using a conventional optical aerosol spectrometer. The shapes and volumes of the ablation craters were examined using SEM and an optical profilometer respectively. Results for the particle number concentration indicated that the large majority of particles were in the smaller range, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> &lt;250 nm, irrespective of the sample type. However, even if the number of larger particles was only 0.1%, this could represent up to 50% of the volume of sample that left the ablation chamber and that this was dependent on the sample type. Study of the ablation craters indicated that the particles were formed by a number of ablation processes including particle splashing and condensation, but overall, the created aerosols always consisted of two main structures. There were spherical particles that had diameters of over 0.1 μm that were originally ejected from the molten surface layer and there were fibrous agglomerates that had diameters in the range of tens and hundreds of nm. Samples that had the highest crater rim and a melted crater bottom were found to have produced the highest number of large spherical particles. The mass values of all of the produced aerosols were calculated from the measured ablation crater volumes and sample densities. Work such as this enables a better understanding of the processes occurring during LA to be obtained and, once the processes become understood, they can be optimised.</p>
<p class="otherpara">An IR femtosecond laser was used to study the influence of high repetition rate on <span class="italic">elemental fractionation effects</span> during the analysis of glass SRM NIST 610.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit327"><sup><span class="sup_ref">327</span></sup></a> The study, by Claverie and co-workers, used a “wet” plasma since this minimised the fractionation effects exerted by the instrument itself and gave a more robust plasma that had a greater tolerance to mass loading when compared with a “dry” plasma. The narrow laser beam used produced a crater only 17 μm in diameter and so a special arrangement of pulses was used to produce a crater of 100 μm in diameter. The ablation strategy consisted of a series of concentric circle trajectories ablated at high repetition rate. Operating conditions, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> two different scanner speeds (0.25 and 1.5 mm s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), five laser repetition rates (ranging from 0.1 kHz to 10 kHz) and three fluence values (5, 14 and 25 J cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) were studied. The isotope ratios of <small><sup>238</sup></small>U/<small><sup>232</sup></small>Th, <small><sup>208</sup></small>Pb/<small><sup>238</sup></small>U and <small><sup>66</sup></small>Zn/<small><sup>65</sup></small>Cu of the aerosols produced by the LA process under the different operating conditions described above were then evaluated. Although no heating zones or preferential evaporation were observed for any of the repetition rates, it was noted that particle size fractionation did occur. This effect was minimised by using a faster scanning speed and a higher repetition rate. Fractionation indices were also improved by using high fluence values. The authors also stressed that the structure of the aerosol particles was wholly independent of the ablation parameters.</p>

<p class="otherpara">A comparison of the use of <span class="italic">refractive index and LA</span>-<span class="italic">ICP</span>-<span class="italic">MS</span> for the determination of the provenance of glass bottles has been made by May and Watling.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit329"><sup><span class="sup_ref">329</span></sup></a> The use of refractive index alone was insufficient to discriminate between glass bottles of the same origin but produced 18 days apart. In addition, since variations in refractive index occur within the glass of the same bottle, it is impossible to identify the provenance definitively; as would be required for a forensic application. The constituents were constant within a bottle and so fragments of a bottle may be considered to be representative of the elemental composition of the entire bottle. Use of LA-ICP-MS to determine the analytes followed by statistical analysis enabled 38 of the 56 analytes determined to be used to discriminate between glass bottles made at the same plant but as little as two hours apart. It was concluded that such a technique would significantly improve the accurate comparison and provenance establishment of forensic glass evidence.</p>

<p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Elemental fractionation</span> during LA-ICP-MS analysis of silicate glasses has been investigated by Gaboardi and Humayun.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit332"><sup><span class="sup_ref">332</span></sup></a> As expected, the elemental sensitivity ratio was found to depend very strongly on the analyte mass and the first ionisation potential. However, other complications were found when LA-ICP-MS analysis of the NIST glasses 610–614 was undertaken. Analysis of the nearly transparent glass NIST 612 indicated that the elemental sensitivity showed a dependence on the temperature of condensation; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> refractory elements yielded a lower signal than that predicted solely by mass and ionisation potential, whereas volatile analytes yielded a higher signal. The problem appeared to be exacerbated when using the most transparent glass (NIST 614) when a concentration offset of nearly 20% was observed compared with the certified values. The error had only been 10–15% for the less transparent NIST 612 glass. These problems could be minimised by increasing the energy of the laser beam used for the ablation. Even using high energy laser pulses, the sensitivity ratios obtained in NIST 612 were uniformally lower (11 ± 4% for a laser energy of 1.4 mJ) than those obtained in the least transparent glass NIST 610. The authors therefore tried to identify an internal standardisation technique that could overcome this. An internal standard of approximately the same volatility as the analytes of interest (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ca for the determination of REE) was found to provide the best solution.</p>

A paper by van Elteren <span class="italic">et al.</span> described a method that did not require this.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit337"><sup><span class="sup_ref">337</span></sup></a> Instead, they used a method that they entitled “<span class="italic">sum normalisation technique</span>”. A total of 54 analytes were determined and the concentrations found were normalised to 100% w/w based on their corresponding oxide concentrations. By assuming a random internal standard concentration, the composition of a major oxide (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) may be used by the mathematical algorithm to change the other concentrations accordingly until the cumulated total reaches 100% w/w. Nine glass standards (some replicating historic composition) were used for calibration. Using SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as the internal standard and by forcing the calibrations through the origin, precision of the slopes ranged between 0.1 and 6.6% RSD. This enabled high accuracy determination of elemental oxides in many synthetic glasses. In general, experimental data obtained using the technique were in good agreement with reported values for both major and minor elemental oxides. There were, however, a few occasions where problems arose. Polyatomic interferences could be alleviated by use of an octopole reaction system, but this had the drawback of decreasing the analytical sensitivity. This may prove problematic for the determination of analytes present at very low concentration.</p>

<div><span id="sect2404"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.4.1 Reviews, comparisons of technique and CRMs. </span><span>Wang and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit353"><sup><span class="sup_ref">353</span></sup></a> have reviewed the use of ICP-OES and -MS for analysis of advanced ceramic materials (in Chinese). The review contained 55 references and concentrated on work from the last decade. The various techniques used for sample introduction were presented and the developing trends discussed.</span><p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">portable instrumentation</span> is becoming increasingly popular since it does not require the sample to be transported back to the laboratory. This therefore facilitates the analysis of very large samples and also enables results to be obtained more rapidly. Brai and colleagues have compared the use of a portable LIBS system with a portable XRF instrument and have employed them both for the analysis of materials from cultural heritage (bricks and mortars).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit354"><sup><span class="sup_ref">354</span></sup></a> The XRF instrument was calibrated using CRMs as standards. The LIBS instrument, which used a double laser pulse for increased sensitivity, produced results that were not linearly correlated with concentration. Therefore the LIBS system could not be used for fully quantitative analysis. Despite this, the authors concluded that a combination of XRF and LIBS was capable of yielding sufficient accuracy to gain useful information on the degradation state of the materials and to distinguish between different chemical features. Miura <span class="italic">et al.</span> have used both ICP-OES and ICP-SF-MS (plus ID-ICP-SF-MS for Cr) for the determination of Co and Cr in the silicon nitride CRM NMIJ 8004-a.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit355"><sup><span class="sup_ref">355</span></sup></a> The atomic spectrometric methods were used as reference methods for a neutron activation technique. Results from the different techniques were in good agreement with the uncertainty values also being comparable.</p>
</div>
<div><span id="sect2414"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.4.2 Novel methods of analysis. </span><span>Since ceramic materials are notoriously difficult to bring into solution, it is probably not surprising to note that the majority of the techniques described during this review period have utilised a solid sampling approach. One paper by Sanchez-Rojas and co-workers that bucked that trend used an experimental design optimisation process for the acid dissolution of a biomorphic ceramic.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit356"><sup><span class="sup_ref">356</span></sup></a> The ceramic used during the study was oak wood that had been infiltrated with zirconia sol. A full factorial design (3(3)) was used to optimise variables such as microwave digestion time and both nitric and hydrofluoric acid volumes. The success (or otherwise) of the digestion was gauged by the response of the determination of Cu, Ni and Zr (using ICP-MS) and of Ca, Fe and Mg (by FAAS).</span><p class="otherpara">The other papers to be reviewed in this section have all used a <span class="italic">solid sampling approach</span>, but with varying detection techniques. A paper by Pal and colleagues used a double pulse system that utilised a 266 nm UV laser to form a LIBS plasma, the emission signal from which was then enhanced by several orders of magnitude by a 10.6 μm CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit245"><sup><span class="sup_ref">245</span></sup></a> The system was applied to several sample target types including ceramics, metals and plastics. The pulse from the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> laser was found to increase the temperature of the plasma by 3000 K. The influence of carrier gas type (argon or helium) on the analysis of magnesium oxide powders by LA-ICP-MS were studied by Lee <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit357"><sup><span class="sup_ref">357</span></sup></a> The signal from the ICP-MS instrument was found to be more stable when helium was used as the carrier gas, but the signal was greater when argon was used. The authors therefore collected ablated particles from both systems and measured the particle size distribution. More particles were found to be ablated using the argon carrier gas system, but the particle size distribution was found to be much wider. This presumably would account for the greater noise component in the signal.</p>
<p class="otherpara">The use of <span class="italic">slurries</span>, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a suspension of finely powdered particles in a liquid medium, has made a return to the analytical literature in this review period. It has been known for many years that this method of introduction can produce very accurate results and has many advantages; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> it avoids the necessity of using powerful dissolution acids, may be calibrated against aqueous standards <span class="italic">etc.</span> However, it is also well known that if the particle size distribution is too high, then erroneous results will be produced because the sample will not be transported in a representative way through the sample introduction systems of flame and ICP instruments. Wang and co-workers have made slurries of boron carbide powder using water and no dispersant.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit358"><sup><span class="sup_ref">358</span></sup></a> The authors validated their method using various alternative methods and by the use of the CRM ERM-ED 102 (boron carbide powder). The analytes Al, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, Si, Ti, V and Zr were detected using an axial configuration ICP-OES instrument. The LOD, which were in the range 0.02–2 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, were superior to those obtained using the more conventional nebulisation approach. Two papers by Amberger and colleagues described the analysis of boron nitride powders<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit359"><sup><span class="sup_ref">359</span></sup></a> and boron carbide powders<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit360"><sup><span class="sup_ref">360</span></sup></a> using slurry sampling but with TXRF as a means of detection. Both materials could form stable slurries if the powders were suspended in 0.1% polyethylenimine at pH 4. The concentration of material forming the slurries was optimised to ensure high net line intensities and high signal to background ratios. The analytes for the boron nitride analysis were Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn and Ti; whereas for the boron carbide they were the same but with the addition of Co and Ni. Limits of detection were in the range 0.062–1.6 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. For the boron nitride, these were found to be higher than those obtained using solid or slurry sampling ETAAS or by solid/slurry sampling ICP-OES. However, for some analytes they were lower than when a wet chemical digestion was employed prior to ETAAS or ICP-OES detection. The accuracy of the data for the boron carbide powders was comparable to that obtained using wet chemical digestion and ICP-OES detection; with correlation between the two methods for the data for Fe and Ti being 0.996 and 0.997 respectively.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Nakano and Tsuji have described the use of two different <span class="italic">micro</span>-<span class="italic">XRF techniques</span> for the analysis of Japanese Lacquer ware.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit361"><sup><span class="sup_ref">361</span></sup></a> A grazing exit XRF instrument was compared with a confocal 3D XRF instrument. The grazing exit instrument used a single capillary to produce a micro-X-ray beam and was capable of obtaining two-dimensional X-ray images. The 3D instrument used two independent polycapillary X-ray lenses and two X-ray sources. The authors compared the relative merits and disadvantages of the two systems.</p>

<div><span id="sect2440"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.4.3 Depth-profiling studies. </span><span>Only those studies involving ceramic samples are discussed in this section. Other depth-profiling studies are discussed at much greater length in section 3.2.5. It is fair to say that the variants of SIMS are the most common techniques to accomplish depth-profiling studies. However, one of the more novel methods to have been used was described by Ctvrtnickova and colleagues who used orthogonal double pulse LIBS to achieve depth-profiling of ceramic tiles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit362"><sup><span class="sup_ref">362</span></sup></a> Two Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers in orthogonal configuration were employed, the first at 1064 nm to ablate the material and the second, at 532 nm to excite it. The light emitted from the excited sample plume was measured using a spectrograph equipped with a CCD detector. Both the depth resolution and the reproducibility of the depth-profiles were approximately two-fold better than for a single pulse laser system.</span><p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Depth</span>-<span class="italic">profiling by SIMS</span> (or variants) has been shown to be dependent on the surface morphology of the sample once it has come under bombardment by the ions. A paper by Fukumoto and co-workers investigated the surface morphology of silicon carbide that was bombarded by caesium ions under various conditions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit363"><sup><span class="sup_ref">363</span></sup></a> At a high angle of incidence, the surface was found to become more rough and this led to a greater change in secondary ion intensities. In addition, the secondary ion intensities changed even at a depth of less than several hundred nanometers. The authors recommended that the primary ions should be administered at an energy of less than 1 keV to avoid these problems if a high angle of incidence is used.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Depth-profiling has also been used to determine the extent of <span class="italic">diffusion into ceramics</span>. An example of such a paper has been presented by Raj <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used SIMS to measure O diffusion as a function of temperature into 9 mol% Scandia 2 mol% yttria co-doped zirconia.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit364"><sup><span class="sup_ref">364</span></sup></a> The values of the tracer diffusion coefficient were in the range 10<small><sup>−8</sup></small>–10<small><sup>−7</sup></small> cm<small><sup>2</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the Arrhenius activation energy was 0.9 eV. These values were valid for the temperature range 600–900 °C. A similar study was undertaken by Pang and colleagues who determined the oxidation characteristics of titanium aluminium carbide over the temperature range 500–900 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit365"><sup><span class="sup_ref">365</span></sup></a> The authors used both SIMS and synchrotron radiation diffraction (SRD) during the study and demonstrated evidence that amorphous aluminium existed at low temperatures. The complementary techniques also demonstrated that anatase started being transformed to rutile at 600 °C and the reaction was complete at 900 °C. Boulesteix and colleagues have determined Nd cation diffusion into transparent crystalline yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG) as a function of silica content and temperature (annealing in air at temperatures of between 1400 and 1600 °C).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit366"><sup><span class="sup_ref">366</span></sup></a> Diffusion coefficients through both the grain boundaries and the bulk sample were determined. It was found that diffusion of Nd increased 10-fold with increasing silica content. The authors hypothesised that this was probably because of point defects. The results were used to elucidate the sintering mechanism. Duong <span class="italic">et al.</span> used SIMS to determine the diffusion of water species doped with either deuterium or <small><sup>18</sup></small>O into both tetragonal zirconia and cubic single crystals of zirconia.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit367"><sup><span class="sup_ref">367</span></sup></a> The diffusion of oxygen species were found to be the same in both sample types and was independent of whether it was administered as a liquid or as a gas. The H or D was found to behave in a different manner though, with diffusion occurring in the tetragonal crystal but not the cubic single crystals. Fully quantitative determination of the H and D in the tetragonal crystal proved impossible even though the experiment was conducted at liquid nitrogen temperatures. However, despite this, the authors still managed to conclude that diffusion did occur in this material over a period of months. The last paper to be reviewed in this sub-section, by Gonzalez and co-workers, characterised a damaged region of a carbon implanted alumina, a candidate material for thermonuclear fusion reactors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit368"><sup><span class="sup_ref">368</span></sup></a> Amorphisation creates volume changes and hence defects. Clearly, this cannot be allowed in a material potentially to be used in nuclear reactors. The authors irradiated the disks of alumina with mono-energetic carbon ions (75 keV) at different doses in the range 1 × 10<small><sup>17</sup></small> to 5 × 10<small><sup>17</sup></small> ions cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. The disks were then tested using assorted techniques including TOF-SIMS, TEM, XPS and glancing angle X-ray diffraction (GXRD). The TOF-SIMS determined matrix elements and profiles of the implanted C ions. These ions were found to be present in the deeper half of the amorphous region. It was also found that the damaged area was also deficient in O which, the authors suggested, was because it was selectively sputtered during the irradiation process.</p>

The majority of bioceramics used are hydroxyapatite of which some are natural.

The analytical techniques demonstrated that no organic matter remained and that the hydroxyapatite was not transformed to other calcium phosphate species at temperatures below 1100 °C. The XRF showed that Ca and P were the most abundant species present and that Mg and Na were present as minor impurities. The Ca to P ratio was in the range of 1.46 to 2.01.

Significant improvements in mechanical properties were reported for this material compared with the un-substituted hydroxyapatite.</span></div>
<div><span id="sect2476"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.4.5 Archaeological pottery. </span><span>Since samples of archaeological origin are often fragile and are certainly precious in terms of cultural heritage, the norm is to inflict as little damage to them as possible during the analysis.

<span>This review has categorised papers on catalysts and catalyst function as follows: Photocatalysts, catalytic decomposition, oxidation reactions, isomerisation reactions, fuel cells and hydrogen evolution, hydrotreatment and hydrogenation, automotive catalysts, polymer immobilised catalysts and hydrodesulfurisation and hydrodeoxygenation.</span>
<p class="otherpara">As is usual with much work in this field, many of the papers included discussed primarily the synthesis of the materials and investigation of their catalytic properties, with the analysis being only briefly discussed. This review therefore includes papers covering a broad area of catalyst research including catalyst preparation and the investigation of catalytic properties in addition to papers containing significant analytical detail. Amongst the latter, of note is an increase in the use of mass spectrometry, particularly TOF-SIMS for quantitation and surface imaging, with excellent results being reported. Laser ablation ICP-MS is becoming important in catalyst analysis and one paper presented a fundamental study of the ablation process. Electrospray Ionisation mass spectrometry has also been employed for the characterisation of copper complexes. X-ray Photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) continues to feature very strongly and has proved enormously beneficial in measuring the binding energies, oxidation states and coordination of surface atoms. In one paper, <span class="italic">in-situ</span> XPS was employed for the measurement of oxidation states within a reactor, which is particularly important in catalyst discovery studies.

Therefore a major challenge is to modify the electronic structure to develop visible light driven photocatalysts. Hybrid CdS/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> systems are considered to be a promising approach, however; CdS is somewhat unstable and suffers photocorrosion in aqueous solutions. Suppression of photocorrosion by ‘wrapping’ CdS nanoparticles in a 2D TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheet was reported by Yan and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit397"><sup><span class="sup_ref">397</span></sup></a> Preparation was by creation of negatively charged CdS particles using polyethylenimine followed by mixing with a positively charged TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheet suspension. Electrostatic interaction caused the CdS particles to become covered with TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanosheets. Drying and calcination produced the active catalyst. Catalysts were well characterised using UV-Vis spectroscopy, XPS and XRD. SEM and TEM analysis showed numerous CdS nanoparticles combined with the extremely thin TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sheets. The resultant CdS/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> composite was found to exhibit enhanced photoactivity in the oxidation of Rhodamine B in water under visible light irradiation. ICP analysis of Cd and S in the aqueous stream showed that the catalyst was also less susceptible to photocorrosion.</span><p class="otherpara">An important oxidation reaction for the removal of many organic pollutants is the Fenton reaction, which involves <span class="italic">photocatalytic oxidation</span> by hydrogen peroxide catalysed by the ferric ion. This reaction is most commonly carried out in the solution phase, using homogeneous ferric ions. In this case, however, the immobilisation of ferric ions into a titanium dioxide support employing metal–organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) followed by photo-deposition to produce a heterogeneous photo-Fenton catalyst was reported, together with the characterisation of the material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit398"><sup><span class="sup_ref">398</span></sup></a> The experimental details for the production of this material were discussed in some detail and the samples were characterised by, amongst others, pore volume and Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area determination. The general morphology was examined by TEM-EDX and the Fe concentrations were determined using ICP-OES and XPS, with notable and significant differences in Fe concentrations found between the two techniques indicating that the Fe loading was predominantly on the external surface of the catalyst. XPS data also showed that Fe was present as the ferric ion.

Anatase crystallite size was determined by XRD using the Scherrer equation and it was found that gold deposition had little impact on crystallite size or crystallinity of the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. TEM images were presented and indicated the highly dispersed nature of the gold particles on the surface of both iron-doped and non-doped TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, with mean gold particle diameters of 8 nm and 9 nm respectively. Light absorption studies were carried out using UV-Vis diffuse reflectance and showed that the doped TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> had significantly enhanced absorption in the visible region because of the formation of a dopant energy level within the band gap of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and strong absorption bands at 500–600 nm were due to Plasmon resonance of gold. XPS analysis was employed and showed that the binding energies of titanium were in good agreement with literature values for Ti<small><sup>4+</sup></small>. Oxygen binding energies corresponded to O<small><sup>2−</sup></small> in the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> lattice, showing that doping with ferric ions and gold resulted in no obvious changes in the chemical state of either titanium or oxygen. XPS data also showed that gold remained in its metallic state although there may be strong interactions between gold and Fe-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Photoluminescent emission studies were employed to understand the fate of electron – hole pairs in the samples and it was postulated that the ferric ions act as recombination centres for photogenerated charge carriers. This effect was weakened by the gold deposited in the sample as the photogenerated electrons were trapped by the gold. The authors also examined the effect of nitrogen doping, and XPS analysis was useful in establishing the gold and nitrogen species on the titania surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit401"><sup><span class="sup_ref">401</span></sup></a></p>

Effectiveness of the self-cleaning action was checked on a red-wine stain under simulated sunlight. The fabrics which had been pre-treated using various methods were examined using XPS and the surface atomic concentrations of O, Ti, C, Ca, S, Si and K were determined before and after staining, and after timed exposure of the stained material to the simulated sunlight. This analysis showed that surface carbon arising from the staining agent (red wine) decreased to 70% of pre-stain levels after 24 h. Carbon dioxide evolution determined using GC clearly showed that the carbon within the stain was being oxidised during this time and the oxidation processes were confirmed using XPS analysis. The coating of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was shown to be present as a uniform distribution of around 30 nm thickness on the surface of the fabric. UV diffuse reflectance analysis confirmed the decrease of the stain over the 24 h test period. XRD measurements determined that the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was present on the fabric as the anatase phase and HRTEM indicated a reasonably homogeneous surface coating of around 31 nm with particle sizes of 8–18 nm.</p>
<p class="otherpara"><span class="italic">Zeolites</span> have also been reported as an alternative/improved support structure for photocatalysts because of their ability to encapsulate molecules in a well defined spatial arrangement. They can also show specific photo-physical properties during charge transfer processes as Lewis acid (framework Al) and Lewis base (framework O) sites are fixed within the zeolite structure. These properties have been utilised by Zang and co-workers to prepare a novel AgBr/zeolite photocatalyst.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit406"><sup><span class="sup_ref">406</span></sup></a> The catalytic properties for methyl orange degradation were then evaluated.

Analysis using XRD showed that AgBr was deposited on the zeolite, and remained there after irradiation although metallic silver began to form. Initial Ag loading was determined using ICP-OES and XPS was used to measure atom content. XPS analysis of used catalyst showed a decrease in Ag and Br atom content, caused by either aggregation of AgBr on the catalyst surface or the release of Ag in the reaction medium.</p>

One important issue in the synthesis of such materials is their hydrothermal stability. Mesoporous SBA-15 has been found to exhibit enhanced hydrothermal stability as compared with MCM-41 because of thicker pore walls and larger pore size. However, it is difficult to introduce high levels of heteroatomic species into these catalysts because of the less favourable formation of metal-oxo species within the mesoporous structure.

The catalytic activity of the materials was examined in the epoxidation of cis-cyclooctene and the hydrothermal stability evaluated by exposing the materials to steam or boiling water for various times at different pressures. The Si to Nb ratios were determined by ICP-OES, EDXRF and XPS. The extent of incorporation of heteroatoms into the SBA-15 frameworks was determined and found to be dependent on the synthesis conditions, specifically on the proton concentration. XPS studies enabled the determination of location, oxidation state and coordination of Nb species in the walls of the SBA-15 and enabled a better understanding of the effect of differences in synthesis and the mechanisms of the catalytic reactions.

XRD analysis was employed to establish the crystallinities and the framework Ti content of the catalyst preparations, and the Si/Ti molar ratios were determined by ICP-OES. One interesting observation was that HRTEM did not yield any useful results, possibly because of a transformation of the morphology of the samples by the high voltage TEM electron beam. XPS analysis indicated an increase in the Ti–O–Si linkage with increased Ti concentration. The possible formation of an anatase phase was also proposed, based on XPS data. Titanium environments within the zeolite were examined by Ti K-edge XANES. The data clearly showed that Ti concentration affected the coordination environment of the Ti atoms, with high concentrations resulting in tetrahedral coordination, with some distortion at excessive Ti concentrations.</p>

It was concluded that K facilitates the easier reduction of cobalt and manganese oxides. Temperature programmed reduction studies indicated a strong correlation between K concentration and the number of basic sites. XPS studies showed that the oxidation state of surface manganese and cobalt did not change with increasing K content, however, the Co/Mn ratio did change, as did the oxygen species with different binding energies, showing that surface lattice oxygen increased at the expense of surface oxygen. This property was strongly correlated with the activity to ethanol oxidation.</p>

The intensity ratio of chloride ions to the total number of ions was found to be dependent on the washing procedure, with ammonia washing resulting in a lower ratio. The cerium support was also shown to have a high affinity for chloride. Analysis using TOF-SIMS also showed the presence of AuO<small><sup>−</sup></small> and AuO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> at the catalyst surface and the AuO<small><sup>−</sup></small>/Au<small><sup>−</sup></small> and AuO<small><sub>2</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small>/Au<small><sup>−</sup></small> intensity ratios yielded information about the amount of gold bonded to, or surrounded by, oxygen ions. Studies on gold foil did not show any AuO or AuOH ions and this was strong evidence that the oxide anions seen in the studies were from fragmentation of surface species, rather than recombination of species after ejection from the surface. Analysis using XPS was not sufficiently sensitive to detect these gold species, illustrating the excellent analytical capabilities of TOF-SIMS for this kind of analysis.

UV-Vis diffuse reflectance was used to determine the wavelength absorption range of the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> thin film. It was found that foils prepared at 473 K absorbed in the UV range (UV-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) whilst foils prepared at 873 K absorbed in the visible light range (vis-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>). The depth profile of <small><sup>18</sup></small>O was obtained using SIMS for each foil and showed that the secondary ion intensity gradually decreased from the top surface (O/Ti ratio = 2.00) to inside the bulk (O/Ti = 1.93) of the vis-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> foil. The UV-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> foil, however, exhibited the same stoichiometry (O/Ti = ∼2.00) independent of the depth from the surface. It was suggested that this anisotropic structure of the vis-TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> caused a significant perturbation in the electronic structure of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, enabling absorption of visible light and hence photocatalytic properties. Photocatalytic production of hydrogen has also been reported from the degradation of formic acid over Pt and Ru loaded CdS/Al-HMS catalysts<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit429"><sup><span class="sup_ref">429</span></sup></a> and CdS/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanotubes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit430"><sup><span class="sup_ref">430</span></sup></a> A suite of techniques was used to characterise the catalysts including N<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption/desorption, XRD, UV-diffuse reflectance spectrometry, XRF, TEM and fluorescence emission spectra. Platinum-loaded catalysts showed the best performance for H<small><sub>2</sub></small> evolution. Hydrogen fuelled proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) and direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) are set to become very important power sources in the near future. However, one of the big technical challenges in both PEMFC and DMFC is the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction at the Pt cathode. Wenzhen Li <span class="italic">et al.</span> have reported both Pt–Co/C<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit431"><sup><span class="sup_ref">431</span></sup></a> and Pt–Fe/C<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit432"><sup><span class="sup_ref">432</span></sup></a> catalysts for improvements of the oxygen reduction reaction in PEMFC and DMFC respectively. Both catalysts were characterised using a standard set of techniques including ICP-OES, SEM-EDX, TEM and XRD.</p>

Characterisation of fresh and spent catalysts by XRD showed that the metal species were highly dispersed or were below the XRD detection limit and therefore smaller than 5 nm. The surface compositions of fresh and spent catalysts were determined using XPS. Sulfur was present primarily as sulfide although some sulfate was present and this was attributed to air oxidation. Additionally, the dispersed CoO within the catalysts was completely converted to CoS on exposure to 5% hydrogen sulfide/hydrogen at 400 °C for 4 h.

<div><span id="sect2840"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.5.7 Automotive catalysts. </span><span>Among the proposed solutions to reduce environmental pollution, the automotive catalyst is one of the best-known technological applications to control vehicle emissions. Although well established, this technology is in continuous development and has been adopted by the majority of countries for controlling vehicle emissions. Modern three-way catalysts are employed to completely oxidise hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and to reduce nitrogen oxides to molecular nitrogen; they employ platinum group metals (PGM) as the active catalyst material. The high value of the PGM necessitates analytical procedures with small uncertainties, and a range of techniques including FAAS, GFAAS, ICP-OES and ICP-MS are employed, together with a variety of sample preparation/dissolution procedures. This requirement for accurate and precise determination of PGM in catalysts has resulted in a need for <span class="italic">certified reference materials</span> (CRMs) and the preparation and characterisation of CRMs is described in a paper by Recknagel and Michaelis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit434"><sup><span class="sup_ref">434</span></sup></a> This paper included a discussion on sample preparation, homogeneity testing, characterisation and statistical evaluation of the uncertainty. A new reference material (ERM-EB504) resulting from this work was accepted by the European reference material initiative and is available from BAM Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing, Berlin, Germany.</span><p class="otherpara">Platinum group metals also occur in the environment as a result of emissions from automobiles and industrial processes. Consequently, the determination of <span class="italic">PGM in environmental samples</span> is a requirement. A novel procedure for the determination of Pd using photoacoustic spectroscopy after solid phase extraction using an immobilised thiazolylazo dye was developed by Saavedra and colleagues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit435"><sup><span class="sup_ref">435</span></sup></a> The performance of this procedure was investigated for the determination of leachable Pd in spent catalyst material and tap water samples. Potential interferences were studied and sodium citrate was suggested as a suitable masking agent. Recovery studies in tap water and spent hydrogenation catalyst were carried out and were close to 100% in both cases. The new procedure was compared with FAAS and the analytical figures of merit were found to be superior, for example the detection limit with FAAS was found to be 240 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> compared with 4 μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for the photoacoustic technique. An added advantage of the developed method was that it had a much wider linear dynamic range and required less sample pre-treatment. Trace levels of Pd in sediments and autocatalysts have also been determined using an on-line separation and preconcentration method using FI-ICP-OES.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit436"><sup><span class="sup_ref">436</span></sup></a> Silica beads functionalised with diethylenetriamine groups (Quadrasil™ TA) were shown to have high selectivity for Pd(II), Os(IV), Pt(IV) and Au(III). The optimisation of the FI procedure was described in detail together with the effects of a range of interfering ions. Analysis of a certified catalyst material and stream sediment showed that the procedure gave results in good agreement with the certified values. A cloud point extraction system prior to analysis using ICP-OES was proposed by Yu and co-workers for simultaneous extraction, preconcentration and determination of Pt and Pd from spent catalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit437"><sup><span class="sup_ref">437</span></sup></a> The method was based on the complexation of the aqueous metal ions with 1,8-diamino-4,5-bis (hydroxyamino) anthraquinone reagent in the presence of the non-ionic surfactant Triton X-114. The solution was then brought to its cloud point condition where phase separation occurred and the Pt complex was contained in the surfactant rich portion. Separation of the surfactant from the aqueous phase using a centrifuge, followed by addition of nitric acid to reduce viscosity allowed measurement using ICP-OES. Results from both synthetic and real samples gave satisfactory results with good precision and a low LOD.</p>

<div><span id="sect2853"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.5.8 Polymer immobilised catalysts. </span><span>Immobilisation of active transition metal complexes on to a solid support has proved to be an attractive method for overcoming the inherent drawback of homogeneous catalysis; <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the separation and recovery of the catalyst after completion of the reaction. The increasing familiarity with and confidence in the use of polymer resins in solid phase synthesis has encouraged organic chemists to search for possibilities of employing polymers as catalyst supports. An excellent example of the benefits of polymer immobilisation was reported by Alexander <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit438"><sup><span class="sup_ref">438</span></sup></a> A palladium Schiff base catalyst, (N-salicylidene benzylamine)PdCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> complex, was prepared for the hydrolysis of olefins. Reaction studies found the catalyst to be unstable in reaction conditions and resulted in metal separation. An alternative cross linked polystyrene-divinylbenzene polymer supported heterogeneous version was prepared and found to be more stable and effective for the hydrogenation of various olefins. SEM was used to study the morphology of the polymer beads before and after loading. Infra-red analysis suggested the formation of the Schiff base on the polymer support, where a strong band at 1631 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> due to azomethine (C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>N) stretching was visible. A combination of XPS and far IR spectroscopy was used to characterise the Pd environment of the catalyst. An XPS spectrum of fresh catalyst exhibited peaks at 337.7 and 343.3 eV assigned to Pd(II). A broad intense peak at 332 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in the far IR spectrum indicated both Pd–Cl bridging and terminal environments. Upon activation with sodium tetrahydroborate, this band shifted to 338 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, whereas the XPS spectra remained largely the same. This suggested that upon activation the catalyst moves from a Pd(II)-Cl bridged species to a mononuclear Pd(II) species with terminal Cl atoms. The polymer-bound palladium schiff base catalyst was economical and could be recycled several times without loss of activity.</span></div>
<div><span id="sect2864"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.5.9 Hydrodesulfurisation/hydrodeoxygenation/refining. </span><span>The <span class="italic">catalytic dehydrogenation of alkanes</span> has received much attention recently because of the increasing demand for light olefins. Conventional methods include steam cracking of naphtha and as a fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) by-product. However these cannot meet the fast growing demand. Zeolites and zeolite-based catalysts have been heavily investigated in this field because of their relatively environmentally friendly, non-corrosive and solid nature. The Si to Al ratio of a zeolite is an important characteristic and is closely linked to its catalytic behaviour. Nawaz <span class="italic">et al.</span> have investigated the effect of the Si to Al ratio of Pt-Sn-based ZSM-5 on its ability to produce light olefins by simultaneous dehydrogenation and cracking of n-butane.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit439"><sup><span class="sup_ref">439</span></sup></a> The bulk metallic content of the catalyst was verified using XRF, whilst TEM was used to measure the dispersion of the metals. The acidity sites of the catalyst were characterised using NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>-temperature programmed desorption and pyridine adsorption measured by IR. It was found that increasing the Si to Al ratio reduced the total acidity of the catalyst and favoured light olefin selectivity, whereas a lower Si to Al ratio significantly increased the conversion. Generally, supported Pt–Sn catalysts are prepared from Cl-containing precursors such as H<small><sub>2</sub></small>PtCl<small><sub>6</sub></small>, SnCl<small><sub>2</sub></small> or SnCl<small><sub>4</sub></small>. Therefore, the role of Cl in influencing catalytic character in terms of structural, acidic and active metal is important. Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> have investigated the effects of dechlorination on the activity of PtSnNa-ZSM5 for light olefin production.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit440"><sup><span class="sup_ref">440</span></sup></a> Dechlorination was performed using a steam-air mix at 500 °C for 1, 2, 3 or 4 h. Catalytic tests were performed on treated catalysts using a standard quartz micro-reactor. It was found that dechlorination of the catalyst reduced its performance significantly. Fresh and dechlorinated catalyst samples were studied using several techniques, including XRF, XRD, <small><sup>27</sup></small>Al magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR, NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>-temperature programmed desorption, BET and TPR. The <small><sup>27</sup></small>Al MAS NMR spectra obtained for a fresh sample displayed a strong signal at 54 ppm, which was attributed to four-coordinated framework Al and a very weak signal at 0 ppm was assigned as six-coordinate extra-framework Al. Spectra collected for dechlorinated samples showed a decrease in signal at 54 ppm and an increase at 0 ppm, suggesting a migration of framework tetrahydral Al species to non-structural extra framework Al. This trend was more evident with increasing dechlorination time. Measurements using XRD agreed with this, showing that the crystallinity of the catalyst degraded with dechlorination time. Elemental analysis using XRF showed that the Cl content decreased sharply after treatment for 1 h and then the rate of loss became relatively gentle. Moreover, the change in Pt and Na was negligible, while the content of Sn decreased. It was proposed that this was associated with the dealumination of the zeolite framework and Al stabilising the Sn species. The authors concluded that steam dechlorination was detrimental to the catalyst activity.</span></div>
