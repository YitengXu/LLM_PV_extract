Using a CMAX-DOAS,<small><sup>1</sup></small> where all the viewing angles are imaged concomitantly it is possible to follow plume evolution owing to the ability to collect high time resolution data.

But in a mobile system on a ship or plane, the azimuthal viewing angle will vary. Is the resulting complication of taking multi-axis spectra as a function of solar zenith angle at varying azimuthal angle a major challenge?</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Platt</span> replied: There is an effect of the relative azimuth angle (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> the angle between observation azimuth and solar azimuth) on the result of the measurement because Mie and Rayleigh scattering are angle dependent. However, the effect of different azimuth angles can be modelled and—we think—its effect on the measurements can be corrected for. In fact such a correction would also be necessary to use MAX-DOAS with different observation azimuth angles to derive the spatial distribution of aerosol and trace gases around the instrument or to perform tomographic measurements using several instruments.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Stutz</span> asked: Is it going to be possible to derive <span class="italic">unique</span> vertical profiles of trace gases if no <span class="italic">a priori</span> information on the aerosol and the gas is available?</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Platt</span> replied: We showed in our manuscript that a MAX-DOAS instrument can measure some elements of the vertical trace gas and aerosol distribution, for instance the concentration in the boundary layer, the vertical extend of the boundary layer, as well as trace gas mixing ratios and aerosol optical density above the boundary layer. The retrieval of these elements should be independent of <span class="italic">a priori</span> information. In the future retrieval of more elements could be possible, for instance the concentration in several layers.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Kolb</span> said: Your paper demonstrates clearly that MAX-DOAS measurements can provide important data on the boundary layer concentrations of absorbing pollutants, provided information on the aerosol particle properties in the interrogated air mass are well enough known to describe the radiation transport. It has long been recognized that the polarization properties of detected solar radiation contain valuable information about the aerosol particles it has encountered.<small><sup>1</sup></small> Would you comment on the potential for polarization data to improve the aerosol extinction data obtained by MAX-DOAS observations?

However, as you correctly point out, additional information may be gained from the polarisation properties of the analysed radiation. This information mostly comes from the fact that Mie-scattered radiation is unpolarised (on average), while Rayleigh scattered light is (in most viewing geometries). I think that your new method to determine full Stokes vector information of scattered radiation is likely to be of great value in this context and should be evaluated for that purpose.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Burrows</span> commented: The vertical resolution of the MAX DOAS retrieved depends on the radiation transfer conditions and the number of azimuthal and off-axis angles. This needs to be taken into account in the retrieval algorithm and I believe is taken into account. In addition the resolution depends on the multiple scattering in the atmosphere for cloud-free conditions. This depends on the aerosol, which can be determined from the O<small><sub>4</sub></small> absorption.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Platt</span> replied: I agree with your comment. In fact our radiative transfer modelling does take multiple scattering into account. The number of different azimuthal and off-axis angles used for the measurement does influence the retrieval, but we think that taking more than 5–10 off-axis angles does not much improve the retrieval of trace gas concentrations and aerosol data. You are correct in pointing out that up to now we largely limited ourselves to cloud-free conditions, however I see no fundamental limitations for retrieving trace gas and aerosol distributions in the presence of clouds.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Remedios</span><a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> commented: We have been working in Leicester on the derivation of vertical information on aerosols from MAX-DOAS instruments. The results clearly depend on the number of wavelengths observed and the choice of angles with the combination of both being an important factor. However, for four wavelengths (360 nm, 477 nm, 577 nm and 640 nm), and utilising both O<small><sub>4</sub></small> optical depth and relative intensity, we find that up to four independent pieces of information can be obtained for retrieved aerosol; typical averaging kernels are illustrated in Fig. 2. We have tried to optimise, in simulations, the angles which should be used and find this depends on the type of aerosol situation that one wants to observe but the dependence is also relatively weak on instrument set-up. There might be some variation in instrument set-up, therefore, from location to location such as marine to polluted urban environments but clearly, there is potential for much well-characterised information on aerosols.</p><br/><div class="image_table"><table><tr><td colspan="3" class="imgHolder" id="imgfig2"><img alt="Averaging kernels for the aerosol extinction vertical profile from MAX-DOAS measurements of the O4 optical depth and relative intensity measured at four wavelengths (360, 477, 577 and 640 nm) and elevations of 20°, 10°, 5° and 2° for a visibility of 25 km.

A micropulse LIDAR would probably give somewhat better vertical resolution in the lower atmosphere, also it would work during periods of darkness.

The issue of the importance of mixing for OA chemistry would be bound up with the level of NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> in the plume, and might be expected to be very different in clean marine boundary layer conditions as compared with more polluted (higher NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>) urban conditions. However, even in the absence of NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>, there would still be a mixing issue, where O<small><sub>3</sub></small> levels would be expected to increase away from the surface, while biogenic VOC concentrations are maximum at the surface, and would decrease with altitude. This is another example of the mutual exclusivity of two species that can react with each other (<span class="italic">cf</span>. NO<small><sub>3</sub></small> and biogenic HC).

My comment addresses a fundamental problem when modeling the turbulent transport of reactive trace gases, which are currently treated as scalars in most chemical transport models of the atmosphere. While this topic has been addressed in a number of publications,<small><sup>1–10</sup></small> it is often described in a rigorous mathematical form that does not provide a good understanding of the nature of this phenomenon. Here I want to present a simplified derivation of the turbulent transport of reactive gases, which serves as a more intuitive explanation of this effect. It will become clear below that the modeling of some nocturnal trace gases does indeed require the consideration of chemical reactions during turbulent mixing and transport (see also ref. 11).</p><p class="otherpara">The derivation starts from the mixing length approach first introduced by Prandtl,<small><sup>12</sup></small> and expands it by including a loss of a reactive species (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a>).

Will this affect the deposition of O<small><sub>3</sub></small> as treated in the model?</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Jones</span> responded: The model makes no attempt to reproduce the range of scales likely to be present in the real planetary boundary layer (PBL). Nor does it include realistic surface chemical processes. In this sense it cannot be expected to reproduce certain aspects of the interaction between composition and transport. This was made clear in the paper where it is stated that the model results cannot as they stand be used to produce parameterisations for use in lower resolution models.</p><p class="otherpara">In the case of O<small><sub>3</sub></small> deposition, the major night time influence is likely to be titration by NO, which, as observations show, in the urban situation is to be emitted in highly variable localised structures. While of course the detail would be different in, for example, an LES representation of the PBL, small scale structure in O<small><sub>3</sub></small> would still be expected to be present in the more sophisticated model, leading to the non-linear effects described in the paper.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Heard</span> commented: The paper has demonstrated the potential importance of structure, chemical variability and mixing processes in the evolution of the composition of the nighttime boundary layer. We have observed behaviour which suggests similar conclusions also hold during the daytime when oxidation is driven primarily by the hydroxyl radical, OH, and ozone is generated <span class="italic">in situ</span> through the reaction of peroxy radicals with NO. In recent field measurements undertaken in Leeds by Dr J. D. Lee and Ms S. C. Smith, we have recorded signals from atmospheric OH and HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with a 1 s integration period. The atmospheric lifetimes of these species under urban conditions of elevated NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> are very short (∼0.1 s for OH and a few seconds for HO<small><sub>2</sub></small>), and as mentioned by both Professor Ravishankara in his introductory lecture, and by Dr Jones in this paper, the atmospheric variability of such short lived species is expected to be high when observed on short timescales. Indeed, the atmospheric variability of both OH and HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> during measurements in Leeds is larger than the variability due to the precision of the instrument alone (obtained from inspection of the variation of background signal) for a 1 s integration period.</p><p class="otherpara">The data indicate that on a 1 s timescale, both OH and HO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentrations are highly variable, suggesting that their rates of production and/or loss (controlled by <span class="italic">J</span>(O<small><sup>1</sup></small>D), other <span class="italic">J</span> values, [H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O], [O<small><sub>3</sub></small>], [NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>], [CO] and [VOCs]) are also varying on very short timescales. Such behaviour is expected due to mixing of spatial concentration gradients in sources and sinks by turbulent eddies. The key questions are: Can we understand the origin of these rapid fluctuations, and if so, are the results important? For example, are the variations significant compared with the integrated average, and if so, are there implications for the predictions of numerical models? Does the model output depend upon the integration period of the inputs with which it is constrained? It is clear from this paper that 20 s fluctuations in NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> are significant compared with the average value taken over a longer period. The instantaneous rates of many processes, for example, the rate of ozone formation, or the rate of secondary organic aerosol formation, will depend upon concentrations of free-radicals and NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>, which are highly variable. Hence the quantity of ozone generated by the model in a given period, for example 15 min, may be different depending on whether the model is constrained by 1 s input data, and the 1 s ozone production is computed, and then averaged up to 15 min, or whether the model is constrained by a single set of 15 min averaged input data, and one value of the ozone production is calculated. The relevant chemistry is highly non-linear and a different result may be expected for the two quantities <img class="centered" alt="ugraphic, filename = b507789n-t7.gif" src="/image/article/2005/FD/b507789n/b507789n-t7.gif"/> and <img class="centered" alt="ugraphic, filename = b507789n-t8.gif" src="/image/article/2005/FD/b507789n/b507789n-t8.gif"/> as computed by the model.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Sarkar</span> communicated: I have some doubts on your ‘Representation of mixing in the model’.

The use of eddy diffusion coefficients, as per Stull’s book, provides a mechanism to reproduce, in a numerically tractable manner, realistic <span class="italic">average</span> PBL conditions for a given set of conditions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> stability). In this sense the use of eddy diffusion coefficients includes the effects of turbulent mixing processes. The use of a range of eddy diffusion coefficients used in the simplified model was chosen to encompass different rates of mixing, from incomplete (low mixing) to rapid.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Stevenson</span> asked: Global models have resolutions of ∼1° to 5°, and only coarsely resolve the boundary layer (∼100 m).

Is this result fortuitous, or does it indicate that small-scale structure (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> structure not resolved by models) is relatively unimportant?</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Jones</span> responded: Given that the range of plume and mixing conditions in the real atmosphere is expected to be large, the relevant comparison is between some average of the model cases and the unstructured model case. Simple inspection of the model results shows that there would be biases in virtually all aspects of the model results, O<small><sub>3</sub></small> deposition, NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> lifetime, VOC oxidation <span class="italic">etc</span>. Thus, agreement to 30% for NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> does not necessarily provide a useful constraint for other aspects of the chemistry. There are also well documented situations (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> ship plumes referenced in the paper) where instantaneous mixing leads, for example, to unrealistic ozone production. The conclusion is that the agreement for NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> may be to a degree fortuitous, and does not imply that large scale models are reproducing many of the subtleties of the chemistry.</p><p class="otherpara">It would be interesting to know whether much higher resolution integrations have a significant impact on the NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> columns produced by global models. Global and indeed many regional models effectively assume instantaneous mixing and are therefore represented by one extreme of the model integrations performed in this study. The impact of the rate of mixing on nitric acid formation can be very important under certain NO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> emissions and therefore NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> levels are intrinsically linked.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Kolb</span> commented: Your paper demonstrates that steep pollutant concentration gradients can be expected to occur in evolving emission plumes and, due to strong photochemical kinetics nonlinearities, that significant effects on the resulting secondary pollutant concentrations and deposition rates can be expected. You show that steep variations in urban ozone concentrations down to 20 s measurement integration times are consistent with this supposition. We routinely deploy tunable infrared laser instruments during urban measurements with measurement integration times of 1 s.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small> We often observe significant fluctuations of both primary (NO, NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and largely secondary (NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, HCHO) pollutant concentrations down to time scales of a few seconds, confirming your hypothesis. It is probable that not only atmospheric pollutant concentrations and deposition rates are strongly impacted by the concentrations gradients you discuss. The damage to human health and ecosystem viability may also be strongly non-linear in pollutant exposure and uptake.</p><p class="otherpara">1 C. E. Kolb, S. C. Herndon, J. B. McManus, J. H.

Dr Tuck’s paper references the work of Takahashi <span class="italic">et al</span>.,<small><sup>1</sup></small> who have investigated the Doppler lineshapes (and thus the translational energies) of O(<small><sup>1</sup></small>D) atoms resulting from O<small><sub>3</sub></small> photolysis at 248 nm, in the presence of various pressures of N<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Analysis allowed determination of the relative efficiencies of translational and electronic (to O(<small><sup>3</sup></small>P)) relaxation pathways, and led to the conclusion that the average translational energy of O(<small><sup>1</sup></small>D) atoms in the stratosphere at an altitude of 50 km, for example, will be about twice as large as the thermal energy of the ambient air. Standard models treat photolytically produced stratospheric O(<small><sup>1</sup></small>D) atoms as being fully thermalised before reacting with trace gas molecules like H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> or N<small><sub>2</sub></small>O. Clearly, inclusion of a more realistic, non-thermal, distribution of collision energies (and, particularly, the high energy tail to the distribution) could have implications both for relative and absolute reaction rates, and product channel branching ratios. Kharchenko and Dalgarno have investigated such effects, for the specific case of the O(<small><sup>1</sup></small>D)

One of the predictions of the mechanism we suggest is that the ‘steady state’ ratio of ground state oxygen atoms O(<small><sup>3</sup></small>P) to ozone will be higher than that observed in well-thermalised laboratory experiments, or in numerical model calculations using thermal rate coefficients. An over-population of O(<small><sup>3</sup></small>P) could conceivably have chemical consequences, particularly if there is a fat tail in its atomic speed PDF. It may further be necessary to re-examine the ‘odd oxygen’ concept in a quantitative context.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Plane</span> asked: Self-sustaining vortices through the creation of ring currents are understandable in the case of a molecular-beam gas experiment. However, in the atmosphere O<small><sub>3</sub></small> photolysis creates translationally hot fragments at very low concentrations and moving isotropically. How will this generate self-sustaining vortices?</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Tuck</span> replied: There is a big difference between a molecular beam of gas propagating into a vacuum and an atmospheric photodissociation event, as Professor Plane says. The former has its own anisotropy, a direction arising from the large, generating pressure gradient. It is, however, depending on experimental design, a largely collision-free environment off-axis. Rarefied gas dynamics is involved rather than the fluid mechanics appropriate to the atmosphere below the turbopause. It is important to remember that the translationally hot photofragments from ozone photodissociation recoil into a pre-existing set of anisotropies, in particular into a set of generating, distorting and dissipating vortex tubes and filaments appropriate to a fluid with a Reynolds number of order 10<small><sup>12</sup></small> and which of course involves all air molecules. The translationally hot photofragment energy can feed into, be sustained by and in turn help to sustain these pre-existing vorticity structures. In traditional radiative transfer calculations, the absorption of solar and terrestrial radiation is significant in the atmospheric heating rate—for example as witness the extension of the life of the Antarctic vortex induced by the loss of such heating consequent upon the almost complete destruction of ozone by the halogen-based chemistry in the ‘ozone hole’. The behaviour described in Figs. 4–6 in our paper is direct evidence of the tangible role of ozone heating. I emphasise again that the heavy tails of the molecular speed distribution are sustained by and sustain the ‘ring currents’ in the molecular dynamics simulations.</p><p class="otherpara">I would also like to make a final point about non-linear correlations, the occurrence of fluctuations and the generation and maintenance of the heavy-tailed PDFs we see in atmospheric observations for which the atmospheric variability is greater than the instrumental noise. Suppose we have two chemical species A and B, and that we have a reaction rate coefficient <span class="italic">k</span> between them<small><sup>1,2</sup></small>, and that we also have wind speed <span class="italic">v</span> and temperature <span class="italic">T</span>. Then if we calculate the rate of reaction <span class="italic">k</span>[A][B] we are convoluting two heavy-tailed PDFs; the result will be an even more skewed distribution in the rate than in either reactant, with a large contribution to the mean from rare but intense events. The same will apply to the advection of temperature, <span class="italic">v</span>∇<span class="italic">T</span>. The atmosphere, far from acting like a giant, smoothing integrator generates fluctuations and sharp gradients by virtue of its non-linearity. The variability is in some ways more important than the mean; it is what we and our instruments actually experience.</p><p class="otherpara">1 A. F. Tuck, <span class="italic">Philos. Trans. R. Soc.

Given the importance of O<small><sub>3</sub></small> photolysis in establishing the <span class="italic">T</span> intermittency implicit in your argument, can you explain why this correlation does not appear?</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr Tuck</span> answered: We do not have an explanation based upon direct experiment or molecular dynamical simulation. However, an argument may be made as follows. In an environment with O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and O(<small><sup>3</sup></small>P) having heavy-tailed PDFs in their speeds, the reaction O + O<small><sub>2</sub></small>
				+ M → O<small><sub>3</sub></small>
				+ M, virtually the sole atmospheric means of producing ozone, will select for the slower-moving atoms in the O(<small><sup>3</sup></small>P) population and the slower-moving molecules in the O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and M populations. It will do so because the recombination reaction has an inverse temperature dependence, and one might not therefore expect a correlation between the product [O<small><sub>3</sub></small>] itself and the intermittency of temperature. Recall that the great majority of ozone photodissociations are followed by such a recombination, at a rate sufficient to put every oxygen atom in the lower stratosphere in an oxygen molecule, in an ozone molecule and in its free state within a few months. The correlation is not with <span class="italic">J</span> and not with [O<small><sub>3</sub></small>] but with their product.

We have selected all such flight legs possessing an adequate number of decades of scale, see references 10 and 14 in our paper. In viewing Figs. 2 and 3, it should be remembered that each point on those graphs cost of order ∼10<small><sup>5</sup></small> dollars at least and are unlikely to be repeated any time soon. The error bars on the points should be noted. Finally, the chemistry in the vortex during the 48 day period 20000123–20000312 was changing significantly, as evidenced by the large change in the ClO scaling (ref. 11 of our paper) and this could affect the ‘within SOLVE’ correlation. The ‘within POLARIS’ correlation involves a much longer period, 136 days from April to September and is certainly spread out over substantial air mass changes. Note that SOLVE does yield in Fig. 3 of the paper two or three points intermediate between the main POLARIS and SOLVE clusters.

On the other hand, compared to ‘billiard ball’ collisions, ‘real’ collisions will be fuzzier and involve structure in both the distance and angular parts of the potential, so weakening the validity of the strong collision assumption, the lack of correlation in position and momentum between collision partners before and after collision. This assumption of course underlies such common formulations as Maxwellian distributions and pressure-broadened Lorentzian line shapes, for example.

These experiments tend to confirm simple gas kinetic calculations and the experience of laboratory kineticists; hundreds of collisions may be necessary to relax hot atoms in the case of a large mass mismatch, but thermalization of velocity in both magnitude and direction is nearly complete within a few tens of collisions for similar-mass particles. Prudent kineticists allow many more average collisions for effective thermalization.

In my opinion, these are likely to be lower limits, because of the mutually self-sustaining interaction between ‘ring currents’ and translationally hot atoms and molecules; the anisotropies which have existed in the atmosphere for geological time scales will feed and be fed by the production of translationally hot atoms, as I have remarked in response to earlier questions.

The chemistry we are proposing is generating nitrite ion on the surface. Depending on the water and proton availability (related to the acidity of the surface), HONO may be formed and released to the gas phase. Porous media will additionally complicate the situation allowing diffusion of NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> or HONO in the bulk underneath the surface. In the end, under given specific conditions, emission of HONO must not necessarily be coinciding with the presence of NO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, but could be related to previous processing of a surface. With respect to the HONO emission observed in absence of NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in smog chambers, nitrite or adsorbed HONO could have been formed in absence of NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> under dry conditions.

As described by Madronich (1987), we introduced a second factor of two to account for the actinic flux originating from both hemispheres with identical magnitude, and hence used in total a factor of four to convert the measured 2π-irradiance into the total spherically integrated actinic flux in the reactor. Due to your question we reconsidered our approach and conclude that our model is likely inadequate for the given conditions, because we assumed an isotropic radiance over all angles. But actually we confirmed experimentally only that the irradiance in the reactor was axial symmetric and the assumption of a spherical isotropic radiance is not supported by the reactor geometry.

We do this by increasing the relative humidity of the carrier gas entering the flow tube. Average growth rates are a few microns per minute, not unlike those experienced in some portions in the atmosphere. We see significant steady state uptake of nitric acid in these experiments indicative of burial. And so, in response to the first question, I would say that uptake by a burial/trapping mechanism under conditions where the ice is growing is a highly viable mechanism in cirrus clouds. I don’t believe we can yet say whether it dominates over the uptake due to surface adsorption for ice growth rates, residence times <span class="italic">etc</span>. in the upper troposphere. However, it is an important uptake mode that has been overlooked until recently, as nicely highlighted by Dr Kärcher’s recent model on this subject.<small><sup>1</sup></small> In this context I fully agree that the community should be cautious in interpreting nitric acid contents of cirrus cloud particles in terms of only a surficial uptake model. And I also agree that it would be extremely difficult, if not impossible at this stage, to try to extract adsorption enthalpies from field measurements, given how strongly affected they are by varying temperature, partial pressure, total ice surface areas, and particle history.</p><p class="otherpara">The new work on uptake under growing ice conditions that I just described is a first cut but a weakness is that the ice growth rate is not uniform down the flow tube. An experiment where the ice growth rate is uniform across the ice sample area, as could be attained in a Knudsen cell, would be preferable. However, the Knudsen cell would be constrained to relatively low temperatures. An experiment where ice particles exposed to nitric acid, where the nitric acid content is measured as the particles grow, is feasible but would not be an easy experiment to make work quantitatively.</p><p class="otherpara">1 B.

Assuming for the time being that freezing does indeed occur at the surface, then the mechanism you describe for trapping nitric acid seems viable. The retention efficiency will be driven by the relative rates of ice growth after nucleation and diffusion of nitric acid from the solution droplet. From recent field studies, it has been reported that gases such as HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> are efficiently retained in the ice crystal upon rapid freezing of supercooled cloud droplets, whereas gases such as H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are not.<small><sup>1,2</sup></small> In an earlier publication, where we show that both SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> have a much lower affinity for adsorption to ice than does HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, we suggested that all the gases are excluded from the droplet as it freezes but that the HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> retention efficiency is much higher than the others because it is retained on the surface of the ice crystal.<small><sup>3</sup></small> In that publication we noted the consistency of this model with observations of convective enhancement factors, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> ratio of trace gases in convective outflow compared to levels in the absence of convection, observed during the TRACE-A field campaign.<small><sup>4</sup></small> In particular, it was observed in those field measurements that the convective enhancement factor for HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small> was less than one whereas it was larger than one for H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>.

Second, it is not clear whether the diffusive component arises from diffusion into the bulk of the ice or along grain boundaries.

One might suspect that the nature of the binding interaction may also change as the surface structure changes. In addition to time, I can expand upon this comment by noting that interpretation of the mechanism of uptake by ice surfaces is complicated by the changing structure of the ice surface as a function of temperature. At low temperatures, the surficial water molecules have low mobility whereas at higher temperatures the “quasi-liquid” layer grows in. How does this affect the nature of adsorbate-surface interactions? In studies of the adsorption of small alcohols to ice we found typical van’t Hoff behaviour, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the logarithm of the gas-surface equilibrium constant varied linearly with inverse temperature, with the larger uptake at lower temperatures, as is normally the case.<small><sup>1</sup></small> For the uptake of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to ice we found the opposite behavior with uptake increasing with increasing temperature, an observation which we interpreted to imply that water mobility was essential for SO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake to proceed <span class="italic">via</span> HSO<small><sub>3</sub></small><small><sup>−</sup></small> formation.<small><sup>2</sup></small> Lastly, in the nitric acid study presented today, the van’t Hoff plot was not linear.

In this sense, any one adsorbed nitric acid molecule will experience a mean “field” of water molecules over its lifetime on the surface as the waters evaporate and condense. Does the interaction between the nitric acid and the water molecules affect the volatility of the water molecules? Studies from the research group of Tolbert have shown that the evaporation rate of ice surfaces are not affected when exposed to roughly 10<small><sup>−6</sup></small> torr of nitric acid, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> in the monolayer regime.<small><sup>3</sup></small></p><p class="otherpara">1 O.

				∼ 0.0015 s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> when [O<small><sub>3</sub></small>] reaches 1 × 10<small><sup>15</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. If there was a similar increase in Fig. 6, this might imply that at low [O<small><sub>3</sub></small>] there is a surface-only reaction.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Donaldson</span> replied: Professor Plane suggests that there could be a surface component to the reaction of gas phase ozone with anthracene dissolved in octanol, which is only important at low ozone concentrations. This is a very exciting possibility which we shall certainly be testing. With the experimental setup we used to obtain the results illustrated in Fig. 6, the S/N ratio becomes poor for ozone concentrations less than about 10<small><sup>15</sup></small> molecule cm<small><sup>−3</sup></small>. We are improving the experimental system and hope to have kinetic results for lower ozone concentrations shortly.</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Dr McFiggans</span> commented: Results are presented for uptake and ozone reaction on expanded and compressed films. Would the authors like to comment on the atmospheric likelihood of each and the relevance? What would be the effect in <span class="italic">mixed</span> organic systems where a uniform compressed film will not form at the molecular area corresponding to the stearic acid concentration shown?</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Donaldson</span> responded: Dr McFiggans asks an excellent question about whether organic-coated surfaces in the “real world”
				(as opposed to the laboratory) may be considered to be compressed, and also what the effect of mixed organic films might be on the results presented here. Fatty acid-coated particles have been observed in the field;<small><sup>1,2</sup></small> it is not at all clear whether the coatings comprised compressed or expanded films, however. We have recently proposed various mechanisms by which film compression might take place in atmospheric aqueous particles.<small><sup>3</sup></small> A report by Pogorzelski<small><sup>4</sup></small> on the surface thermodynamics of real sea-surface microlayers suggests that, at least on the ocean surface, the film is clearly a multicomponent mixture, and that it is in an expanded state.</p><p class="otherpara">1 H.

They seem to consist of an ice core surrounded by a shell of liquid water containing up to 40% of electrolytes. How can the presented laboratory results be compared to the situation in the real atmosphere?</p><p class="otherpara">(2) The repeated exposure results (Fig. 3) indicate some aging of the surface. Could this be related to the effect of a liquid water/nitric acid layer forming, making the particles more similar to the ones proposed in the real atmosphere?</p><p class="otherpara"><span class="bold">Professor Abbatt</span> replied: It is possible that the surfaces of the cirrus cloud particles contain electrolytes, perhaps from sulfate aerosol scavenging or if the ice particle formed <span class="italic">via</span> homogeneous freezing of an aqueous aerosol. If electrolytes exist on the surface of the ice then the uptake of nitric acid may be affected. The question is how much of the surface is “contaminated” in this manner. Given the relatively high surface areas that can exist in cirrus compared to the total sulfate aerosol loading, and the rapid growth conditions that cirrus frequently experience, the total surface coverages may not be high. I am not aware of any measurements that support a liquid water shell with up to 40% electrolytes but if such a shell is present it will have a huge effect on the uptake of trace gases such as nitric acid.</p><p class="otherpara">With respect to your second point, yes, we believe the uptake of nitric acid is suppressed in the repeated exposure experiments because some nitric acid remains on/in the ice after the initial exposure. In this regard, the subsequent exposure may well be more representative of uptake of nitric acid to surfaces that have been previously exposed.</p><hr/><table><tr><td><h3>Footnote</h3></td></tr><tr><td><span class="sup_ref">† <span id="fn1">Also Dr U.
