<h2 id="sect330"><span class="a_heading">1 Introduction</span></h2>
<span>Flexible and wearable devices have aroused great interest in recent years because of their potential applications in artificial skin, smart electronics, stretchable energy and sensing products as well as advanced biomedical devices. These types of next generation smart systems can be easily worn on the human body, which is soft and curved. Fibrous, flexible and linear textile material based smart devices are ideal candidates for future wearable electronics, which are soft, deformable, washable and durable also. These fibers are transformed into one, two- and three-dimensional (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> 1D, 2D and 3D) fiber assemblies. The merging of nanotechnology, electrical, electronic engineering and textile technology has the potential to combine the positive attributes of each technology, the speed and computational capacity of modern smart devices. These are also possible due to their flexibility, wearability and fibrous nature, which are suitable for the fabrication of personal wearable electronics, military garment devices, biomedical and antimicrobial textiles. These research and development activities have been driven by the motivation of fibrous and linear assemblies having different functions of communicating, sensing, computing and actuating <span class="italic">etc.</span> The potential for developing conformable, light-weight and flexible electronic devices on textile products is very significant, which offers tremendous opportunities to deploy electronic based energy, sensing devices, built-in or embedded into the cotton based materials.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–13</span></sup></a></span>
<p class="otherpara">Generally, fabrication of the wearable device requires a linear shape, cable-type, flexible, porous and fibrous material. In the textile industry, cotton is one of the most universal fibrous cloth which is a flexible and a porous material made from threads, fibers, yarns and fabrics. These flexible cotton materials have a complicated structure with high permeability, large surface area and hydrophilic functional groups. These fibrous materials are made of multiple individual weaving micro fibrils bundled together, which contain poly-D glucose chains and have a strong capacity of adsorbing water and other polar solvents. The micro-fibriled cotton materials have strong van der Waals (VdWs) interactions with carbon nanotubes (CNTs) which can be easily coated on the surface of flexible and linear cotton materials <span class="italic">via</span> its simple immersion in a solution of CNT ink.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–3,5</span></sup></a> Such nanocarbon incorporated hierarchical network creates highly porous and conductive surface morphology, which is essential requirements for an ideal sensor,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4,6,12,14–18</span></sup></a> energy devices,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3,9,10,19,20</span></sup></a> supercapacitors (SCs),<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3,5,7,21–26</span></sup></a> lithium ion batteries (LIBs),<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13,27</span></sup></a> flexible electronics,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7,8,10,11,28–33</span></sup></a> wearable heaters,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33,34</span></sup></a> human stress detection,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> biomedical devices<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,35,36</span></sup></a> and solar cells.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37</span></sup></a> Especially, macroscopic linear shape and excellent mechanical flexibility of such material are also valuable for the development of cable-type devices.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> Similarly, various nanomaterials (NMs), nanoparticles (NPs), hybrid nanocomposites, polymer nanocomposites and flexible materials have shown their immense interest in wearable applications as energy devices,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3,5,7,9,10,19,20,22,23,26,27,37</span></sup></a> flexible electronic devices,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7,8,11,29,30</span></sup></a> wearable heaters,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33,34</span></sup></a> human stress detection devices<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> and biomedical devices.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,35,36</span></sup></a></p>
<p class="otherpara">This article reviews the current status and recent advances of the next generation wearable devices. In addition, this review paper also elaborates the performance requirements of the flexible and linear cotton material based wearable products, especially regarding the connection between materials, fibrous structures and electronic as well as mechanical functionalities. An attempt is also made to review critically the numerous research publications, which will demonstrate new devices with respect to practicality and manufacturability and also their actual implementation for the development of flexible, wearable and smart devices.

<h2 id="sect359"><span class="a_heading">2 Conductive fillers for flexible and linear conductive cotton materials</span></h2>
<span>A choice of required materials is an important consideration for the development of wearable devices and the possibility to confer characteristic properties into the flexible and stretchable devices. The development of soft, flexible, semi-conductive or conductive material is essential for the smart and wearable devices because of their unique chemical, mechanical and electronic, properties. Most widely used materials are metals and metal oxide NPs, nanowires (NWs), conductive polymers (CPs), carbon nanomaterials (CNMs) such as carbon particles, carbon fiber, CNTs and graphene, which have been studied. Wearable devices made from conducting materials exhibit good mobility, higher field-effect, steep sub threshold slope, leading to lower operating voltages. These promising materials have also demonstrated their potential in applications including flexible electronics, sensing and energy devices.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–8,10–12,20,26,28,32,34,38–46</span></sup></a> Tao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> reviewed and summarized various conducting materials like CPs, CNMs, metallic NPs and NWs. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a> shows cartoon of the various materials required for the development of a variety of wearable devices and smart textiles. <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a> shows various CNMs, metallic and semiconducting NMs, nanocomposites, hybrids, CPs and polymer nanocomposites, along with their performance, method of fabrication, advantages, disadvantages and applications.</span>

After the discovery of CNTs, various synthesis methods such as CVD, arc-discharge, and laser vaporization have been reported. Amongst all these methods, CVD has been emerged as an effective and suitable method for large production.

<p class="otherpara">Majority of coating technique depends greatly on the surface morphology and surface tension of the textile substrate, which can also vary from section to section and may result in non-uniform coatings. An appropriate coating technology should impart the desired functionalities and/or provide a suitable interface layer for high durability.

<div><span id="sect1067"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.1.1 Incorporation of conductive fillers on flexible cotton materials. </span><span>A highly conductive cotton materials (threads/fibers/yarns/fabrics) can be achieved through this simple “dipping and drying” technique. A dipping or dip coating step for modifying the flexible and linear cotton materials is the most convenient way of the processing after several repetitive dips. A general commodity cotton thread (1.5 mm in diameter) can be coated using CNT dispersions through “dipping and drying” steps. Once the adsorbed CNT–cotton threads were dried, it was impossible to remove the adsorbed CNTs from the fibers by exposure to solvents, heat, or a combination of both, the cotton thread became conductive, with a resistivity as low as 20 Ω cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The incorporation of CNTs into the flexible cotton material is much more efficient than their adsorption into carbon fibers. This could be a result of the efficient interaction of polyelectrolytes with cotton and other natural polysaccharide and cellulose-based materials, such as paper, which is well known in the industry. The strength of the CNT–cotton yarn is reported more than 2 times higher than that of the original one due to a reduction of the overall diameter, densification and stronger adhesion of the fibers to each other by the polymer material. Even though the cotton yarn became slightly harder after being coated with CNTs, it is still very flexible and soft, both of which are important for the wearability of electronic fabrics.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2</span></sup></a> An another method reported by Shim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> who showed that CNTs were dispersed in dilute Nafion–ethanol or PSS–water solutions with 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 weight ratio. The conductive cotton materials (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> threads) can be nanoscopically coated by using the CNT ink through the several time repetitions of “dipping and drying” steps. In these steps, an ink with well-dispersed CNTs is generally prepared by dispersing pure and treated SWCNTs in water with a surfactant (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate (SDBS)).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–4,6,8</span></sup></a> A dispersion of 50 mg CNT, 100 mg SDBS and 10 mL DI water, was prepared by bath sonication for a time of 10–20 min. This CNT ink dispersion can be probe-sonicated for 90 min. Then a cotton thread was dipped into the black CNT ink. Owing to the strong absorption, the cotton threads became tightly coated by CNTs. The cotton thread with SWCNT ink was subsequently dried in oven at 70–80 °C for 120 min.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–8,19,34</span></sup></a> Similarly, deposition of Au-NWs films around cotton threads can be achieved through the dip-coating process, reported by Goldthorpe <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> A cotton thread (200 mm) was cleaned in an ultrasonic bath using ethanol, alcohol, and DI water for 5 min each. The NW solution adhered well to the surface of the cotton thread. The density of the deposited Au-NWs film was varied by using different concentration of the Au-NWs in the coating solution and the number of dipping steps. After deposition the cotton threads were annealed in air at 150 °C for 30 min. To obtain a stretchable conductive thread, a multifilament polyester/rubber blend (28% polyester, 72% rubber) with a diameter of 450 mm was coated. The thread was stretched to 150% of its original length using a vice, surface modified with NaOH, and then coated with Au-NWs in the stretched state by drop-casting.

This kind of structure allows absorbing the large amounts of water or other polar solvents, which causes the fibers to swell at a time of dipping in conductive solutions. And also CNTs have been proven to have large VdW interactions. Furthermore, acid treated CNTs have carboxyl functional groups on the surfaces and the ends, which can form strong hydrogen bonds with the hydroxyl groups present in the fibers. Upon contact, large VdW forces and hydrogen bonding occurs, which binds the CNTs very tightly to the cotton materials.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3,5</span></sup></a> <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4(b and c)</a> shows a schematic of CNTs (1.6 mg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in water with 10 mg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> SDBS) wrapping around fibers to create a 3D porous structure as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4(d–g)</a> and highly conductive cotton fabric which also retain their texture and structure after CNT (4 mg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in water with 8 mg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> SDBS) coating and feel the same as the original material.

This conformal coating is a result of the mechanical flexibility of individual SWCNTs and the strong binding energy between SWCNTs and the cotton fibers that accounts for the high conductivity of the stretchable and porous textile. Tunneling electron microscopy (TEM) images (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4(g)</a>) taken on SWCNT–cotton fiber hybrids show that the SWCNTs are well bonded to the fiber and forming cross-linked networks, which provide conducting pathways.

After drying completely in a vacuum oven, the sponge was cut into small ribbons with thickness of 1 mm and an area of 2 cm<small><sup>2</sup></small>. The sponge ribbons were subsequently coated using CNT ink suspension by a simple “dipping and drying” process. The next step was to electrodeposit MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-NPs on the CNT-coated sponge by galvanostatic “electrochemical deposition” for different times ranging from 3 to 40 min. Due to the mechanical flexibility of CNTs and strong VdWs interactions between the macroporous sponge cellulose and CNTs, the CNTs can be easily also coated onto the skeleton of a sponge, rendering the insulating sponge highly conductive by a simple “dipping and drying” process steps. Flower-like MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-NPs were uniformly deposited onto the conductive CNT sponge skeleton, even at the edges.

<p class="otherpara">The potentiometric chemical sensing cotton yarns have been coated using CNTs, and then partially covering them with the ion selective polymeric membrane. The potassium ion-selective membrane was a mixture of 2 wt% (18 mmol kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) of valinomycin, 0.5 wt% (10 mmol kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) of potassium tetrakis (4-chlorophenyl) borate, 32.8 wt% of poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) and 64.7 wt% of bis(2-ethylhexyl) sebacate. To turn the cotton threads into conductive yarns successive “dipping–dyeing” or “dyeing–rinsing” steps can be applied (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5(a) and b</a>). In each step, the cotton yarn was completely immersed in the CNT-ink (3 mg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> in water with 10 mg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> SDBS) for a few seconds. The cotton yarns, which immediately acquired the characteristic black color, were then removed by rinsing thoroughly with distilled water to eliminate the excess of surfactant. Interestingly, during the “rinsing” step, there was no visual evidence of the elimination of the CNT (which remain strongly adsorbed onto the yarn) as the rinsing water emerges clean (only revealing the presence of the surfactant). After rinsing, the cotton yarns were air-dried. These “dyeing–rinsing” steps can be repeated until a suitable value of electrical resistance is achieved. A whole sequence of the steps required to build the conductive CNT yarn based electrodes using the CNT coated cotton is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5(c–e)</a>. As a first approach, a pipette tip (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5(c)</a>) was used, in order to leave exposed only a fraction of the yarn, while the rest can be protected and can be accessed through the back-end of the tip. The exposed fraction of about 5 mm was fully dipped for a few seconds into a cocktail containing the ion selective membrane components (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5(d)</a>), was then removed and dried for a few minutes. The number of times the dip coating can be performed to achieve optimum response. The final prototype of the yarn electrode (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5(e)</a>) has the sensing end, and a back-end that can be connected to the reading instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> The CNT ink can stay well disperse (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5(f)</a>) for more than 30 days, so it can be applied on the surface of the cotton yarn by “soaking” step as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5(g)</a>. However, various coating methods such as “drop casting”, “brushing” and “inkjet printing” can also be used. A particular challenge in e-textile demonstrations has been the process-induced strain as the yarn suffers from bending stress during the weaving process.

In order to produce durable antibacterial textiles, various pre- or post-treatments, such as coating with water insoluble polymers, use of cross linking agents or plasma treatments have been reported to improve the stability of the deposited antimicrobial NPs on cotton fabrics. The cotton fibers were pre-treated in order to remove various non-cellulose components, such as wax, grease, and other finishing chemicals.

<div><span id="sect1225"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.1.2 Integration of electronic functions within cotton materials. </span><span>Fabrication methods play an important role in determining the characteristics, cost, and stability of the flexible and wearable devices. Generally, various approaches to make these flexible and wearable devices can be grouped into two categories. In the first category, electronic devices are fabricated by using conducting fibers made from CP, metal, carbon, piezoelectric materials, or conventional fibers surface modified with various functional NMs. A number of e-textile research groups have focused on conductive materials to integrate electronics into flexible and linear cotton materials. The fiber-based approach has resulted in excellent wearable properties that mimic regular textiles and withstand mechanical deformations like bending, twisting and stretching. The second category is complementary to the first one, which is based on (i) embedding off-the-shelf miniature or thin-film-based electronic components (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> transducers) onto conventional dielectric fabrics as a motherboard and (ii) imparting electronic functions on the surface of fabrics by coating or printing or lamination. Except the excellent conductivity, other properties of the flexible conductor are same or similar to the common fibers/yarns and that can be easily woven or knitted with common yarn together into a new electrical functional fabric that possesses wearability, processability and flexibility. The stretchable conductors can be knitted or woven with other common yarns into an electric functioned fabric to form designed electric circuit. A method of combining thin-film flexible electronic devices has been reported at the fiber level, including sensors and transistors, interconnect lines, and commercial integrated circuits with plastic fibers which can be easily woven into fabrics using a commercial manufacturing process. To weave the flexible and wearable electronics, the fibers are woven the weft direction of a fabric by a commercial band weaving machine. This method creates a platform to integrate a large variety of flexible electronic circuits, sensors, and systems on fibers intimately within textile architectures using a commercial manufacturing route.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11,115</span></sup></a></span><p class="otherpara">Electronic functions can be integrated in cotton fabric using “surface mounting”, conductive “nanocoating” and “self-organizing” technologies. “Surface mounting” technology used in electronic industry is related to “lamination” technology of the textile industry. The thin-film based devices can be attached onto conventional textile fabrics by thermoplastic adhesives. Apart from that, fabrication of free standing electronic devices directly on textile substrates can be achieved by three technologies, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> “screen printing”, “digital printing” and “dip-coating”, which have been developed to fabricate a processable solution for wearable devices in textile substrate. One key advantage of these methods is that they facilitate the use of low-cost patterning techniques at room condition. “Screen printing” screen provides an easily adopted fabrication route for the fabrication of wearable electronics, all the layers with different functions are printed on top of the fabric substrate through a label process. This process does not need extra photolithography and chemical etching processes as each structural pattern is directly defined with every layer application. In addition, “screen printing” is also compatible with industrial roll-to-roll processes, offering a route to high volume batch fabrication, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> fabric strain sensor screen-printed with activated carbon and textile energy storage devices made by “screen printing” activated carbon paint onto custom knitted fabrics. Further, the “screen printing” method has excellent applicability on any irregular textile surface that can offer significantly more design freedom and placement capability on fabrics than other methods like weaving and knitting. Compared to the “screen printing” technology, “digital printing” technology has the advantage of high spatial precision of ink droplet. Combined with “inkjet printing” provides an exciting opportunity to apply on-demand material deposition and desktop programmable wiring of designed patterns. The latter has already been demonstrated for metal, CNT and graphene based inks. In addition, piezoelectric, piezoresistive and capacitive elements also can be developed by “digital printing” technology for detecting deformation of a fabric. Conductive “nanocoating” technologies are another effective approach to integrate electronic functions within fabrics and improve the performance and functionality of wearable electronics. Self organizing technology is also an important technique to obtain conductive fabrics, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> a fiber-based micro-SC uses piezoelectric ZnO-NWs grown self-organized and radially around the fibers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11,12</span></sup></a></p>

<div><span id="sect1317"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.2.2 Mechanical strength. </span><span>The conductive textiles show outstanding mechanical properties, that is, strong binding between SWCNTs to the textile, foldability and stretchability. Electrical and thermo-physical enhancements are promising though as in other systems, the lack of mechanical integrity could hinder potential applications. The mechanical adhesion under a standard tape test, and no CNTs were visualized on the tape, indicating good adhesion of SWCNTs on the cotton thread (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10(a)</a>), which can be attributed to the strong VdWs forces and hydrogen bonding exist between flexible SWCNTs and the cotton threads. Recently, cable-type wearable devices have been developed using these conductive threads, which can maximize the mechanical flexibility and provide the necessary breakthrough in wearable electronics, field of energy conversion and storage.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> The superior mechanical adhesion of SWCNTs on cotton is essential for high-speed roll-to-roll fabrication and energy storage device stability. To test the stretchability, the resistance of a fabric sample with a dimension of (2.5 cm × 7 cm) e-fabric was monitored as it was loaded in tension using a tensile tester. The SWCNT – fabric was stretched, the conductance was found to be increased. It is remarkable that the conductance keeps was observed to be increasing until the strain value of 140%, which indicates that the cotton fabric can be stretched to 2.4 times of its original length. This increase in conductance was due to the improvement of the mechanical contacts between fabrics, which leads to the better electrical contacts for SWCNTs. As the strain increases further, the conductance starts to decrease, which is likely due to severe inhomogeneous deformation at large strains, as well as the reduced cross sectional area. Such stretchability of conductive textile could enable various stretchable electronic devices. The strength of the CNT–cotton yarn is more than 2 times higher than that of the original cotton thread due to a reduction of the overall diameter, densification, and stronger adhesion of the fibers to each other by the polymer material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> This can be also confirmed by <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10(b)</a>. Xu and Kotov <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> reported the mechanical property data of the original cotton and CNT–coated yarn as ultimate yield strength = 41.6 and 87.8 MPa; initial modulus = 140 and 342 MPa; tensile breaking strain = 0.36 and 0.28, respectively. The density-normalized breaking energy was 65 kJ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for both threads, which indicates that most of the energy was absorbed by the structural cotton backbone. Even though the cotton yarn became slightly harder after being coated with SWCNTs, it is still very flexible and soft, both of which are important for the wearability of electronic fabric.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–3</span></sup></a> A flexibility of CNT–cotton yarn is attained without losing CNTs and altering its resistance. A particular challenge in e-textile demonstrations has been the process-induced strain as the yarn suffers from bending stress during the weaving process. The strain can lead to device failure, especially in brittle inorganic materials. However, the CNT is ideal here since its mechanical strength is high enough to withstand the bending stress. As the macroscopic bending may not affect the CNT networks, the resistance change was observed by which was negligible for various bending states, reported by Han <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> A resistance of conductive thread must not degrade significantly after repeated bendings, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, it must be mechanically flexible, especially when used in applications such as clothing-integrated sensors.

<div><span id="sect1363"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.2.3 Electrical behavior. </span><span>The conductivity of the CNT–cotton material depends on several experimental parameters such as the type of conducting filler (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> CNMs, NMs, NPs, NWs, CPs, hybrids and polymer nanocomposites), conducting filler–polymer ratio, and deposition technique. Shim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2</span></sup></a> reported that a cotton yarn made from Nafion-stabilized CNTs in ethanol is 2 orders of magnitude more conductive than that made from PSS-stabilized CNTs in water.

This low electrical resistance of CNT–cotton yarn allows for convenient sensing applications that may not require any additional electronics or converters. As the humidity was raised, the resistance of SWCNT-Nafion coated cotton yarn increased. Sensitivity to humidity changes also gives a good indication of the so-called “breathability” of the material, which is also an important parameter for smart fabrics.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2</span></sup></a> Cui <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> reported that the conductance of cotton and fabric based textile conductor increase with increasing the dipping number in SWCNT ink. The sheet resistance difference for cotton and fabric with different dipping number was due to the SWCNT ink absorption difference for cotton and fabric per area. Soaking the conductive cotton sheets during acid treatment can wash away the surfactant molecules and induce hole doping, which resulted in a decrease of their sheet resistance by approximately three times. The thickness of cotton sheets was observed to be decreased from ∼2 mm to ∼80 μm with mechanical pressing, which changed the electrical conductivity from 5 to ∼125 S cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10(c)</a>).

Likewise, the surface resistivity of the CNT functionalized fabrics was also noted to shift dramatically from 190 to 5 kΩ on increasing the dipping cycles from one to ten, respectively. The improved conductivity values could be inferred through the enhanced interlinking of the CNTs that could actually facilitate the generation of an excellent electrically conductive path. So it can be emphasized that the quantity of CNTs that gets attached to the fabric is analogous with the increasing diameter of the conducting structures and only imposes a limited effect in promoting the conductance values. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10(f)</a> shows the current–voltage (<span class="italic">I</span>–<span class="italic">V</span>) characteristics of short (<span class="italic">D</span><small><sub>S</sub></small>) and long (<span class="italic">D</span><small><sub>L</sub></small>) lengths of CNT functionalized fabrics having dimensions (1 × 2) and (2 × 4) cm, respectively.

In the water-washing test, the conductive cotton material is soaked in water, then squeezed and wrung out. The SWCNTs stick well to the cotton without peeling or dissociating and precipitating in water.

When the cotton fabrics were treated with 1 g m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> of ZnO-NPs, the static contact angle slightly increased from that of the neat cotton fibers. Further increase in ZnO-NPs concentration, fabrics turned hydrophobic with the highest contact angle value of 110° at 5 g m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> of ZnO-NPs. The increasing of surface hydrophobicity as a function of the ZnO-NPs concentration could be explained by an increase of roughness on the cotton fabrics. These hydrophobic surfaces allowed improving the self-cleaning property of these NPs. For practical purpose, the durability of the super hydrophobic surface is important.

The steady-state temperature was observed to increase linearly with the applied voltage to the heaters. The increase in temperature was noted to be very fast, and steady state temperature in both the configurations was achieved in 40 sec. A saturation temperature of 25 °C was reported for the device <span class="italic">D</span><small><sub>L</sub></small> in 10 V, which was increased to 45 °C by increasing the applied voltage to 40 V. With regard to device <span class="italic">D</span><small><sub>S</sub></small>, the steady-state temperature was 96 °C at 40 V. The functionalization of the CNT on cotton fabrics have reinforced and protected the cotton fabric with the generation of more heat from their overall surface. As a result, the faster heating rates were observed with homogeneous temperature distribution. The faster heating and cooling response and the maximum steady-state temperature were found to be preserved during the heat cycle test. The absence of any significant variation in temperature or decrease in heating performances illustrates the high stability of the fabric heater.

To be really useful in everyday life a sensing system needs to be handy, non-invasive, easy to read and possibly wearable. Only a sensor that satisfies these requirements could be eligible for applications in healthcare and physiological condition monitoring. An OECT has been investigated as a simple, low-cost and e-textile biosensor, fully integrated on a single cotton yarn. The biosensor has been used for real-time detection of adrenaline, selectively compared to the saline content in human physiological fluids.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> The different sensing capabilities of the nanostructured textile based device have been also reported for the detection of adrenaline with the Ag- and Pt-gate electrodes which showed real-time acquisition of the drain-current as a function of time. Measurements have been realized using real human sweat as the electrolyte bath and injecting a 10 mL droplet of adrenaline in it at a fixed time. The sensor reacted almost instantaneously (less than 1 s) upon the liquid injection, with a relative change in the current signal (<span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>ds</sub></small>) of about 200% with respect to the base signal. Real time measurements were intuitive and provided clear evidence that the reaction at the electrode was completely different for the Ag or Pt gate electrodes. In a similar way, it was also possible to detect the injection of a droplet containing NaCl salt in real-sweat with the Ag-gate electrode, but no change in signal occurred with a Pt-gate. These complementary results allows to selectively detect a rush of adrenaline in a saline solution, like human sweat, without confusing it with a change in saline concentration, because they are detected independently by the two different electrodes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> ZnO-NPs coated cotton textiles (without and with UV light) selectively have been used for killing <span class="italic">Staphylococcus epidermidis</span> without harming <span class="italic">cutaneous microflora</span>.

<div><span id="sect2111"/><span class="c_heading_indent">4.2.1 Bio-molecule sensors/detectors. </span><span>When the CNT coated cotton yarn is incorporated with anti-albumin, it becomes an e-textile biosensor that quantitatively and selectively detect albumin, the essential protein in blood. The same sensing approach can easily be extended to many other proteins and biomolecules. When considering sensing applications, polymer's characteristics are needed to be considered to maximize the signal to noise ratio and sensing linearity in different environments. PSS is more hydrophilic than Nafion, thus, CNT–Nafion is more advantageous for dry-state sensing while CNT–PSS is more advantageous in humid conditions. For intelligent fabric demonstrations, the CNT–Nafion yarn was tested as a humidity sensor in a dry state while CNT–PSS yarn served as a wet-state biosensor platform. Alongside integrated humidity sensing, CNT coated cotton threads (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>(II)) can be used to detect albumin, the key protein of blood, with high sensitivity and selectivity. Each experiment involved the measurements of the conductivity of yarns being in contact with a 500 μL aqueous volume of water. Then 50 μL aliquots of bovine and human albumins at different concentration were added to this starting volume, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, 11.9 μM for human serum albumin (HSA) and 30 μM for bovine serum albumin (BSA). Detection of the antigen with CNT–IgG–cotton yarn was very sensitive and selective. The presence of analyte around the CNT–IgG–cotton yarn was indicated by an increase in conductivity. The signal transduction mechanism is believed to involve the release or significant rearrangement of IgGs from the CNT–cotton yarn. Negatively charged HSA reacts with anti-albumin, which is followed by the process of expulsion from the SWCNT–cotton matrix by the negatively charged polyelectrolyte, such as PSS. As a result, more extensive SWCNT contacts are formed by producing a more conductive network, resulting in the drop of the resistance. These observations were further validated by CV measurements in which the anti-HSA coated smart yarn was set as a working electrode. CV data indicate a clear increase of conductivity of the smart fabric upon the less diluted antigen proteins in solution, confirming the partial removal of the insulating spacing between the SWCNTs. This effect is clearly absent when no antibody was incorporated between the CNTs. This evidence-of-concept can be actualized for the application of these materials as wearable bio-monitoring and telemedicine sensors, which are simple, sensitive, selective, and adaptable.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2,103</span></sup></a> The electrical conductivity change due to the antigen/antibody reaction between serum albumin and anti-HSA has enabled biosensor development and conductive CNT printed on fabric has been implemented as communication antenna.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2,4</span></sup></a> A freestanding graphene/textile composite film decorated with spiky structured Pt-nanospheres have been used as a new approach for developing electrical conductive biomaterials, tissue engineering scaffolds, bendable electrodes, and wearable biomedical devices.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> To realize a cotton–OECT sensor with selective sensing capability, two OECTs were integrated on the same fabric patch, very close to each other but working independently.

The black yarn at the bottom side of each device is the cotton fiber coated with the PEDOT:PSS solution. The two cotton–OECTs can detect simultaneously and independently different kinds of analytes; in particular the Ag–cotton–OECT is sensitive to ions, while the Pt–OECT is capable of reacting with an adrenaline molecule. The channel of the cotton–OECT is defined by the overlapping of the liquid electrolyte with the polymer, as evidenced by the darker area of the cotton fiber reported in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>(III).

In the case of e-textiles, miniaturized chemical or gas sensors can be attached to a fabric substrate by stitching or sewing. Chemically sensitive CPs can be also coated on textiles. Chemo resistors are those sensors whose electric resistance is sensitive to the chemical environment. Gases such as H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO can be detected CP doped with metallic inclusions; <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, PPy doped with copper and palladium inclusions shows a change in resistance when exposed to these gases. Toxic gas sensors can be fabricated by depositing thin films of PPy or PAni onto textile threads, which are later woven into a fabric mesh.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> The metal–CNT based ammonia sensor can also be actualized on a cotton yarn by using two perpendicular Au wires in contact with the conductive cotton yarn, whereas CNTs were used for the electrode as well as sensing material because of their p-type behavior under ambient conditions. Han <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> demonstrated and confirmed that the CNT–cotton yarn sensors (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>(IV)) can exhibit consistency, repeatability, good mechanical robustness against twisting. The resistance shift of the CNT network upon exposure of NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>, was monitored in a chemi-resistor approach which can be used for low-cost smart textile and large-area distributed sensors in e-textile applications. The bending tests demonstrated that the signal response was very little influenced by the mechanical stress due to hydrogen bonding between the CNT and cotton.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> It is important to clarify the first impact of the metallic CNT on the gas response characteristics and therefore, a metallic CNT–cotton yarn as a control sample was fabricated and the influence of NH<small><sub>3</sub></small> was tested as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14(a and b)</a>. When the cotton yarns are knitted or woven into a textile, different sensor lengths may be necessary for garment design. Also, variation in length can arise from the CNT ink drop dying of cotton yarn, which may affect the sensor characteristics. As the length increased, resistance was found to be increased and the resistance response characteristics differ from one another. On the other hand, no obvious resistance trends with respect to NH<small><sub>3</sub></small> were found (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14(a and b)</a>) in metallic CNT coated cotton yarn and the resistance values were found to change very randomly. The resistance of metallic CNTs was order of hundreds of Ω and the resistance fluctuation was order of tens of Ω. In contrast, the resistance value of the sensing CNT was of the order of tens of kΩ while the resistance shift was approximately hundreds of Ω. The total resistance of sensing CNTs yarn is the sum of all individual resistances and it is dominated by the CNTs. The total contribution of fluctuations in metallic CNT resistance is only less than 10%, and thus the effect of CNT electrodes can be neglected. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14(b)</a> shows NH<small><sub>3</sub></small> response of the metallic–CNT/thread and the response and recovery characteristics are acceptable. A constant sensing response regardless of mechanical bending is critical for e-textile applications. <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>(IV) shows the schematic and an image of the CNT–cotton sensor yarn knitted on an ordinary textile. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14(c)</a> shows the response for straight and bent (90°) conditions with bending tests carried out by applying a load to CNT–cotton yarn. It is notable that the change in sensor response was very small after the bending stress was applied. The strain induced to a yarn during weaving process can reach as large as 14% of the bending radius of about 165 μm. Due to the adhesion and strong flexibility of CNTs, the sensor showed robust characteristics against the strain. Therefore, the CNT based sensor performance may not be adversely affected by human movement.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> Recently, Shimpi and Hansora <span class="italic">et al.</span> developed hybrid (CNT/PAni/γ-Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>) nanostructured cotton threads which demonstrated their potential for low concentration of LPG at room temperature.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123</span></sup></a></span>

Thus, these sensors can be built using cotton yarns as substrates, which have demonstrated an analytical performance that is similar to lab-made electrodes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Basic and generalized methodology are used to develop electrochemical and pH sensors as wearable smart sensing devices. Commercial cotton yarns are first turned into electrical conductors through a simple “dipping and dyeing” process followed by partially coating with a suitable polymeric layers to develop ion-selective electrodes (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>(V)). The electrodes were placed on the non-adhesive part of the band-aid, separated by a gap of a few millimeters, and a thin layer of cellulose acetate that cushioned the yarn electrodes and helped to absorb and retain liquid was placed on top of them. This bed of cellulose retains liquid efficiently, but it also avoids any direct contact of the sensors with surfaces (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, skin). This work has focused on the development and characterization of the sensing yarn as an analytical tool. The band-aid was adhered to the garments of a real size human model (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>(V)) and the electrodes were connected to a potentiometer. Solutions simulating sweat with increasing ion concentration were added with a syringe. For all the NH<small><sub>4</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> ions tested a Nernstian response was obtained of the band-aid sensors. These results suggest that embedding the sensors onto textiles does not significantly affect their performance. These yarns can be used as potentiometric sensors for the detection of pH, K<small><sup>+</sup></small> and NH<small><sub>4</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>.

A remarkable aspect of these sensors is the stability of the signals, which was evaluated for different concentrations of the target ions. In all cases, a very good value of stability (signal drift &lt; 250 μV h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) of the sensors can be ascribed to the use of CNTs, whose large capacitance stabilizes the response of the sensor. LOD found for these yarn sensors were 10 μM for K<small><sup>+</sup></small> and 1 μM for NH<small><sub>4</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small>, very similar to the values found in the case of lab made sensors. In order to further characterize these sensors, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was used. The impedance spectra obtained for the cotton yarn sensors are also very similar to those obtained for conventional solid-state ion-selective electrodes. From these spectra, the resistance of the membrane can be estimated, yielding values that are close to 1.5 MΩ for K<small><sup>+</sup></small> and 0.4 MΩ for both NH<small><sub>4</sub></small><small><sup>+</sup></small> and pH membrane.

A metal-free FBG (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>(VII)) was reported <span class="italic">via</span> a simple, cost effective method by using CNT as source material, commodity cotton threads and aqueous poly(tetra floro ethylene) (PTFE) suspension. A smart “Power shirt” is especially attractive because it can extract energy from human body motions to run body-worn healthcare sensors. The FBGs can convert biomechanical motions/vibration energy into electricity utilizing the electrostatic impact. The FBG has been recognized as an effective building element for a “Power shirt” to trigger a wireless body temperature sensor system and as a self-powered dynamic sensor to detect human motion quantitatively. A single FBG was fixed on a subject's index finger. The output current flowing through an external load of 80 MΩ at five different bending releasing motion states that were labelled as state I, II, III, IV, and V, respectively (insets in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15(a)</a>). In each motion state, the finger was bent to the same amplitude and then released for three cycles. It can be seen that a couple of output current signals with opposite polarity would be generated in every bending releasing motion cycle (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15(a)</a>). The instantaneous output power generated by the FBG with small-scale finger motion could reach ∼0.91 μW (average area power density of ∼0.1 μW cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small>), which was enough to power an electronic device such as a liquid crystalline display (LCD) with small power consumption. As the total charge transfer corresponds only to the motion amplitude regardless of the motion speed, each positive current peak has been integrated for different motion states, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15(b)</a>. This behavior indicates that the FBG can be used as a self-powered active sensor for detecting tiny muscle motion/stretching without an external power, at least for the sensor unit and has potential applications in patients' rehabilitation training and sports training. Additionally, an approach to prove the electricity generated by FBGs has been also implemented. When the lab coat was shaken, an alternating output current would be generated. When shaking only the electrodes that were fixed on the lab coat, there were no signals detected by the measuring instrument. The output electric signals were first rectified by a bridge rectifier, transforming alternating current to direct current and charging the capacitor continuously. The capacitor could be charged to 2.4 V in around 27 s, and every step of voltage increase corresponded to each vibration of the lab coat. After the capacitor was fully charged, it could light up a red LED, indicating that the electricity generated by the “Power shirt” can be stored in a storage cell and power commercial electronics. Furthermore, the “Power shirt” had successfully triggered a homemade wireless body temperature monitoring system. The working principle of the wireless body temperature monitor system is schematically shown in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>(VII). The active body temperature monitor system detected the surrounding temperature where the wristband can be worn when shaking the lab coat. The modulated signals shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15(c) and (e)</a> represent the detected temperatures when the wristband was placed on a desk or on the human wrist, respectively.

This mechanism allows the films to measure strains up to 280%, with high durability, fast response and low creep to detect human motion, including movement, typing, breathing and speech. A stretchable human motion detector has been fabricated by connecting CNT gel based conductive rubber paste stretchable electrodes to the films as well as PDMS rubber glue and assembling them on wearable cotton textiles. This mechanism is interesting which should be tested on flexible and linear CNT coated conductive cotton threads. Adhesive bandages and SWCNT film device behave as a single cohesive stretchable object, so deformation of the skin can be monitored directly and precisely using the SWCNT film (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(a)</a>). When fixed to the chest, respiration could be monitored by the upward and downward slopes of the relative resistance associated with inhalation and exhalation (chest expansion and contraction). In contrast, when attached to the throat (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(b)</a>, inset), the device monitored phonation (speech) by detecting motion of the laryngeal prominence (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(c)</a>). Such devices might be useful in a breathing monitor for the early detection of sudden infant death syndrome in sleeping infants, alerting parents to any potential problems. To detect large-scale human motion, small films can be seamlessly connected to fabricate a large SWCNT strain sensor assembled on a commercial stocking (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(d)</a>) over the knee joint. The large SWCNT film was necessary to detect and distinguish every movement of the knee. As the knee joint moves in one direction (as well as swiveling on its axis), the knee constantly rolls and glides during movement, so the deformation site of the skin is constantly varying. Although it was made from just one sensor, the device could easily detect, and also discriminate, various human motions related to the extension and flexion of the knee, including bending, marching, squatting and jumping, and combinations of these (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(e)</a>). One advantage of using clothing-integrated devices is the option for repeatable and sharable use of the sensor. Integration of the SWCNT strain devices were created a system for the configuration of the human body, as demonstrated by a data glove made from five independent SWCNT strain sensors assembled on a single glove (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(f)</a>). A data glove is an interactive device, resembling a glove normally worn on the hand, which facilitates fine-motion control in robotics and virtual reality. The designed data glove could detect the motion of each finger individually and precisely (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16(g)</a>), and the output of each gauge could be measured to assess the hand configuration. The designed glove is lighter, simpler, allows integration of more sensors than the complex optical fiber system, and does not limit any range of motion of the hand, as does the metal–strain–gauge system.

<p class="otherpara">Córcoles <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> designed a simple and low-cost cotton fabric-based electrochemical device (FED) for the determination of lactate concentration (up to limit of 0.3 mM) in saliva. The device is especially useful for clinical diagnostics and sports monitoring. The FED combines the advantages of cotton fabric (easily available, low-cost, lightweight, flexible, biocompatible, requiring min volume of reagent and sample solution, mechanically durable and environment friendly) with the benefits of electrochemical detection (fast and reliable quantitative analysis). The wearable devices were designed by scoured cotton fabrics using Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>CO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (20 g in 1 L of ultrapure boiled water) followed by washing, rinsing and drying treatment in order to produce a sufficiently hydrophilic cotton fabric. Next, all necessary electrodes for a three-electrode configuration system were integrated into the treated cotton fabric by using template method. The template was printed on self-adhesive vinyl paper using a digital craft cutter (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(A)(b)</a>). The printed template was adhered to the cotton fabric surface, then the template openings were filled with carbon graphite paste and Prussian Blue (C-PB) paste for the WE and CE, respectively, while Ag/AgCl paste was used as the RE (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(A)(c)</a>). After removing the template, the cotton fabric was cured at 60 °C for 30 min in the oven (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(A)(d)</a>). The hydrophilic sample placement/reaction zone was patterned on the electrode-embedded cotton fabric using candellila wax-patterning technique. The templates for the sample placement/reaction zone were designed using software and printed on the wax-impregnated paper (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(A)(e)</a>) which was placed accordingly on the cotton fabric and the wax was transferred by heat treatment using a soldering iron at an operating temperature of 150 °C (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(A)(f)</a>). When the wax melts, it spreads in both vertical and lateral directions within the cotton fabric. The FED was ready to use after removing the template and allowing it to cool at room temperature (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(A)(g)</a>). All the electrochemical measurements were performed after cutting the fabric into (15 mm × 15 mm) strips, each containing the three-electrode set (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(B)</a>). The overall fabrication process of the FED is illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(B)(a)</a>. The electrochemical behavior of PB, a redox-active compound within the fabricated FED was studied from CV curves by using 4 mL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS). The solution wicks through the cellulose fibres within the cotton fabric and reacts with the entrapped lactate oxidase (LOx) enzyme molecules, hence generating H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> that can be electrochemically detected. The reaction that takes place at the C-PB/LOx electrodes of the FED in the presence of lactate are illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(B)(b)</a>. The template method was used to pattern a single conventional three-electrode sensor and a three-electrode array onto commonly available lab supplies as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig18">Fig. 18(C)</a>. The resulting devices could be easily interfaced with an electrochemical analyzer, thus making it feasible for a wide array of applications such as healthcare, clinical diagnostics, sports, agriculture, environmental, security and food quality monitoring.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> Similarly, a fabrication of NaOH-scoured and Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>CO<small><sub>3</sub></small>-scoured cotton cloth-based microfluidic device (CMD) has been reported using a simple wax patterning method for performing calorimetric bioassays. The wax pattern was written by hand or transferred using a metallic stamp onto cotton cloth so that when the cloth is dipped in dye, the dye will not penetrate the region which is covered with wax. Hot melted wax was applied to fill in the gaps between the fibers in a single yarn as well as in the space of cotton fabrics, which create hydrophobic regions in a hydrophilic substrate (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19(I)(A–C)</a>). <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19(I)(B)</a> shows a magnified SEM image of the unwaxed region with clear gaps between the single cotton fibers, while in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19(I)(C)</a> showing magnified SEM image of the waxed region with gaps as well as the surface of individual fibers covered with wax. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19(I)(D)</a> shows more proof from a light microscopy image that wax covers both the weave porosity and the gaps between the fibers. Yet, the gaps between the fibers in a single yarn appear darker compared to those of the waxed region. The increased hydrophobicity of the waxed region is mainly due to the increased content of long aliphatic chains of the fatty acids contained in the wax. This is proven by the extreme increase of the C atom content in the wax region compared to the non-waxed region, as shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19(II)(E)</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> The colorimetric detection of protein was utilized as a model assay to examine the function of 2D and 3D CMDs (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19(II)</a>) as an analytical device which was used to detect unknown amounts of BSA in artificial urine.

The use of active pseudo capacitive materials and permeable cotton material based conductive textiles is also a useful platform for energy storage device applications. Cotton based textiles are highly porous and can absorb large amounts of water and other polar solvents, which can be made conductive by an extremely simple “dipping and drying” process using CNT ink. These everyday textile base wearable power devices have demonstrated outstanding flexibility, stretchability owing to strong adhesion between the CNTs and cotton based textiles due to VdWs interactions. <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a> shows various cotton based wearable devices and smart textiles for energy management applications.</span>

<span>In this critical review, we have covered recent research on the materials, fabrication and properties of nanostructured flexible and linear cotton materials (threads, fibers, yarns and fabrics) and their applications in wearable devices related to e-textile components (transistors, antenna, electrical connectors, fiber based electric circuit), energy management (conversion, LIBS, DSSCs, FFSCs, LEDs, energy generators, fuel cells), sensors (biomolecules detectors, gas, chemical, electrochemical, pH, stress–strain, pigment and dyeing), actuators, healthcare garments (human body movement, diagnosis, glucose detecting fabrics), smart textiles and flexible electronics (power shirt, FEG, TEG, flexible heater). The complete review of hybrid nanostructured cotton threads shows the following concluding remarks.</span>
<p class="otherpara">The conductive cotton based textiles materials can offer here a uniquely simple yet remarkably functional solution for wearable and smart devices, with many parameters exceeding the existing technological solutions, including different conductive fillers (CNMs such as carbon particles, CFs, CNTs, GO, rGO, graphene, GFs, metals and metal oxide NPs, NWs, hybrids, nanocomposites, CPs, CP based nanocomposites). The CNM–cotton materials are promising for low-cost e-textile based devices for applications in sensors, biosensors, heaters, and healthcare monitoring clothes due their electrical properties, while NMs (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, NPs, NWs)-cotton materials are found suitable for wearable electronics due their optical properties. Similarly, hybrids, nanocomposites and CP nanocomposites are suitable conducting fillers for cotton material based wearable devices for energy management applications. The hydrogen bonding between the CNMs and cotton leads to high adhesion, as a result, conductive cotton material can be implemented to develop smart and wearable devices. Flexible and linear cotton materials (extruded threads, fibers, yarns, fabrics) can be made conductive using aformentioned conducting fillers by various methods during manufacturing and after manufacturing (galvanic deposition”, “atomic layer deposition”, “electrochemical deposition”, “EDM”, film coating”, “screen printing”, “silk screening”, “sputtering”, “electroless plating”, “CVD”, “vapor coating”, “dipping and drying”, “self assembly”, “epitaxial growth”, “chemical reduction”, “pulsed laser deposition”). Amongst them, “dipping and drying” method has been most widely used to make conductive cotton materials, while “electrochemical deposition method” was used for depositing the energetic materials. The as-made conductive cotton materials are flexible and robust enough to be intertwined, knotted and woven into clothes, garments and hand accessories. In addition, these flexible and linear materials can also be used as conductive cables, wires, connectors, antennas, with engineering garments. On the other hand, these conductive cotton materials based components can be equipped with tiny self-powered elements and microwave communication components to serve as body-implantable sensing networks, roll-up portable displays, sensory skins and electronically steerable antenna arrays for wireless communication, would be in considerable demand in upcoming years. Wearable devices such as highly bendable cloth sensor, intelligent micro sensors, wearable electronics, “power shirt”, FEG, TEG, a cable-type SCs, LIBs, DSSCs, scanners, diagnostic devices, antimicrobial textiles and many more.</p>
<p class="otherpara">Furthermore, nanostructured conductive cotton material-based wearable devices were explained for various applications. To commercialize nanostructured conductive cotton material in wearable devices, some important issues will have to be addressed, including mass production, integration into clothes, non-toxic technology, and long-term usage. Although considerable performance in textile-based electronic devices have already been achieved, further efforts to improve performance are necessary. A significant body of theoretical and experimental research has been carried out to understand the mechanism and characteristics of smart e-textiles and wearable devices. Current trends suggest that smart and wearable devices are well-positioned to someday become the foremost wearable devices for different applications in worldwide. These devices are exceedingly popular in younger demographics, and can function as an all-in-one tool for measurement, processing and communication of results. If the e-textiles can overcome the aforementioned issues, new era in wearable devices will begin.</p>
<p class="otherpara">This review also promises to be an increasingly active area of research for the foreseeable future and advances in wearable technology and shows potential to have a profoundly positive impact on quality of next generation life. These recent advances in the development of wearable devices and smart textiles will bring for future devices into a realization. The overview of hybrid nanostructured cotton materials will boost essential encouragement for the development of next generation smart textiles and flexible devices which could be worn by human beings.</p>
