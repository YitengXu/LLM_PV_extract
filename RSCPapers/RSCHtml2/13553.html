      <h2 id="sect427"><span class="a_heading">1 Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>The desire to make materials lighter and/or stronger has been persistent for millennia, causing the transition from bronze tools and weapons to those made from iron and steel over 2000 years ago. In modern times, the need for weight reduction is typically linked to increased fuel efficiency for mass transport, and to this end, composite materials have featured heavily. The correlation between removing a vehicle's mass and better design was noted as early as 1923 by Henry Ford, who stated, “<span class="italic">Saving even a few pounds of a vehicle's weight… could mean that they would also go faster and consume less fuel. Reducing weight means involves reducing materials, which, in turn, means reducing cost as well</span>”, but there is a limit to this approach. Effecting weight reductions by simply removing a material can compromise aspects of safety or performance, thus lighter composite materials are employed as replacements. These composites are commonly composed of glass and/or carbon fibre reinforced plastics, referred to as the fibre and matrix, respectively. The latter of these two reinforcing agents (carbon) will be the focus of this review.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The use of carbon fibre composites in modern structures is a significant means to reduce weight in mass transport to increase fuel efficiency and decrease CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions. As society transitions to alternative energy sources, such as electric and hydrogen powered vehicles, wind energy, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, significant removal of weight will be required to increase range and allow for the installation of batteries and/or hydrogen storage modules. As such, the requirement to make better performing composites is more important than ever. The understanding of the fibre–matrix interface and interphase, and how to tailor these is critical to realising the potential of carbon fibre composites for these applications.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As a composite consists of two dissimilar materials, the interface (the physical contact) of each material and interphase (the localised area surrounding the physical contact) plays a critical role in the overall performance of the composite part. The interface and interphase are intimately linked as the molecular interactions at the interface typically define the interphase. It is somewhat counterintuitive to consider that this very small physical region, typically at the nanometre scale, has a significant impact on the macroscopic properties of a material. The role of the interface and interphase is to mediate the transfer of stress and other forces experienced by the weak supporting polymer to the strong reinforcing material.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–3</span></sup></a> Therefore, a physical or chemical disconnect between the two constituents is detrimental to the overall performance of a composite and ultimately leads to premature catastrophic failure.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">It is important to note that there have been several reviews written on this topic in the past,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,3,4</span></sup></a> with a focus on how surface treatments affect adhesion. This unique area requires an understanding of organic chemistry, molecular interactions, and the relative strength or complementarity of these in complex systems, which is what we hope to contribute in this review.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">A major hurdle in the development of ‘next generation’ carbon fibres is the strict proprietary control over their manufacture and processing. The most pertinent manufacturing processes to the interfacial adhesion are the final two processing steps – fibre surface treatment and sizing. The conditions of surface treatment (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, electrolyte identity and/or concentration, current and/or potential applied, duration, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) are not typically divulged to the end-user. Similarly, the sizing agent, a proprietary cocktail of ingredients, is applied to the fibre in the final step to protect it from post-processing, make the fibre tractable, and enhance interfacial adhesion. However, this last point has a large degree of conjecture in the literature, with frequently conflicting results being reported over the past 4 decades.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The ambiguity of these processes results in ‘systematic’ evaluation of commercially available fibres being highly inconsistent as there are dozens of variables which could be changed between samples, unknown to the researcher. Of these, each may have a slight effect on interfacial adhesion. Therefore, many attempts to replicate published work have been problematic; thus, a prominent ‘black box’ surrounding the nature and impact of carbon fibre surface treatment and sizing remains.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect443"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Carbon fibre manufacture</span></h3>
        <span>Carbon fibres have been manufactured from a myriad of materials, indeed the search for alternative precursors is a major research area targeting a step-change in carbon fibre cost.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5–7</span></sup></a> Presently, the vast majority of carbon fibres manufactured are derived from polyacrylonitrile (PAN) (with various copolymers), with a small remainder of commercial fibres (&lt;10%) originating from pitch or rayon precursors. The following discussion of manufacture is with respect to PAN-derived carbon fibres. This area has been reviewed previously, and the reader is referred to these excellent accounts; therefore this process will be only briefly covered herein.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">First, PAN fibres are passed through an oxidation process, usually heating the fibres (250–300 °C) in an air atmosphere, to stabilise the fibres and prevent their melting or burning when exposed to much higher temperatures. Then, heating the oxidised PAN in a low-temperature furnace (∼600–900 °C) in a nitrogen atmosphere initiates the formation of a ladder polymer structure, and subsequent heating at high temperatures (&gt;1000 °C) extrudes a large volume of non-carbonaceous species and sets the crystalline structure of the fibres. In some instances, a third furnace (ultra-high temperature) is used to generated carbon fibres with extremely high Young's modulus, resulting from an increase in the graphitisation percentage of the underlying chemical structure.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">At this point, after HT furnace treatment, the surface chemistry is quite heterogeneous, with loosely bound amorphous carbon being present and residual nitrogen and oxygen species from the parent PAN polymer. This hydrophobic and rather unreactive surface is then passed through an electrochemical oxidation bath to remove any lubricious carbon species, and to install oxygenated functional groups. Finally, the surface treated carbon fibres are passed through a sizing bath which adheres a coating to the exterior of the fibres making them tractable and processable for weaving into usable fabrics.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">It is important to note that these processes are heavily guarded industry secrets and so there is much conjecture in the literature regarding the exact effect of surface treatments and sizings.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect452"><span class="b_heading">1.2 Role of the interface and interphase</span></h3>
        <span>The interface and interphase are dictated by the surface chemistry of the carbon fibres, which is very challenging to characterise. Carbon fibres are distinct entities from carbon nanotubes, graphite, graphene, carbon nanofibres, <span class="italic">etc.</span> The characterisation of even the graphitic nature of the surface has been reported recently using surface profiling Raman spectroscopy showing a high degree of heterogeneity (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> It is interesting that the PAN derived carbon fibres have a more consistent D/G ratio (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>, top) than the ones derived from mesophase pitch (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>, bottom).</span>

        <p class="otherpara">Considering that the chemistry which is attached to this graphitic heterogeneity is also difficult to characterise there is a tendency for surface treatment and effects on properties to be referred to in terms of trends rather than quantifiable contributions from functional groups.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">This surface heterogeneity will be reflected in the homogeneity of the treated surface of the fibre, as they are directly and intimately linked. Though it is important to consider the consistency of surface treatments along a fibre length is relative to the scale of analysis. For example, at a micron scale, two sections of the fibre may be significantly different with respect to the atomic constituents, hybridisation of carbons, and oxidation states of those very species. Whereas, at a meter scale, two sections of fibre may seem similar as the subtle chemical changes and speciation has averaged out over these larger areas. Similarly, when the fibres are sized and woven into a fabric, often incorporating up to kilometres of fibres, the average surface chemistry will likely be consistent over the whole fabric.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Regardless, the translation of various forces across the interphase and interface of a composite is critical to the performance. It is also difficult for some to connect the molecular and macroscopic scale, in that the interactions present at the molecular scale can dictate the performance of a material composed of kilometres of fibre. Nevertheless, the connection between micro-, meso-, and macroscale testing has had some preliminary connections made in recent years.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10–13</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">There is a myriad of testing mechanisms available to researchers in the composites field to determine interfacial adhesion. These have been reviewed and are examined in the literature,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2,14,15</span></sup></a> and the interested reader is referred to those works.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect470"><span class="b_heading">1.3 Considerations regarding process scale up and industrial translation</span></h3>
        <span>The ability to scale up and translate a carbon fibre (or any) surface treatment process is an important consideration for industrial or broad end user translation. There are obvious implications in an OH&amp;S context, where strong acids or oxidant etches are routinely used, high electrical currents and potentials, and the incorporation of inert or reactive atmospheres. Most of these considerations are already used in industrial or large-scale plants and so are not insurmountable by any means.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Significantly more challenging for scale up are processes which are limited by the fibre bundle geometry, speed of treatment, and the potential for deleterious effects. For example, the use of plasma oxidation is widely used, and discussed below, but suffers from only treating the periphery of a fibre bundle or tow. Thus, the use of tow spreading for consistent surface treatment is a significant challenge faced by many industries and has high potential for fibre twisting and damage <span class="italic">via</span> excessive handling.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Again, these challenges are not insurmountable but any perceived barrier of entry to incorporate such processes on large scale will be a deterrent. Such a process would have to induce a significant step change in terms of performance or quality to be truly considered as an alternative to existing methodologies.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Nevertheless, the high performance and largely niche application of carbon fibre means that there is still significant value in surface treatments that are not able to be scaled up. As low volumes of carbon fibres with well-defined surface structure and chemistry may shed light on long standing questions in the field regarding interface/interphase interactions, mechanisms by which novel functionality can be installed, and how to maximise macroscopic performance.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect478"><span class="b_heading">1.4 Scope of this review</span></h3>
        <span>The volume of work published on carbon fibre and composite interfaces since the development of this material is far too large to be captured in this review. Here, we intend to examine cases where surface treatments can be tracked back to the chemistry of the surface and how these treatments have affected the adhesion to the supporting polymer. While this may sound like a straightforward process, the surface of the starting fibres is very heterogenous and poorly characterised, thus complicating matters. Every effort has been made to cover relevant work, though some omissions are inevitable, with respect to this we apologise to any authors who were overlooked.</span>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect482"><span class="a_heading">2 Manufacturing processes</span></h2>
      <span>The manufacturing process of carbon fibres has largely remained constant since their commercialization. This section will focus on the surface treatment aspect of their manufacture, and thus only a brief mention of the manufacturing processes prior to this will be mentioned. For the interested reader, this topic was covered in excellent detail, including precursors and other manufacturing parameters, by Buchmeiser <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> and we refer the reader to that work.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">It should be mentioned that when using PAN as the precursor fibre, the physical morphology of the fibre will also influence the interfacial adhesion in the final composite. Carbon fibres are often depicted as cylindrical, though it is well known that other radial geometries are known (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, kidney-bean shaped). This variation in fibre geometry is even more pronounced and exotic when textile-grade PAN is employed to reduce the cost of raw materials for low-cost carbon fibres. A very recent example was reported by Lee <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> showing that textile grade PAN could achieve similar interfacial adhesion values as T700 fibres by surface morphology alone. Unfortunately, the geometry of the fibres used in many studies is not routinely reported, and thus is difficult to consider in these discussions.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect492"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Variations on the in-line manufacturing process</span></h3>
        <span>With all oxidations and surface treatments for carbon fibre it is important to note that the correlation between surface treatment and interfacial shear strength (IFSS) of the final composite may not be linear, but instead periodic. To illustrate the cyclic nature of this relationship, hypothetical periodic oxidation <span class="italic">vs.</span> IFSS curves have been constructed (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2a</a>) using three different applied potentials (1, 5, and 10 V). It is possible, in this hypothetical scenario, to conduct experiments examining oxidation potential and time to optimize IFSS. In this instance, at <span class="italic">t</span><small><sub>1</sub></small> for example, it would seem as though 5 V oxidation is optimal, while poor IFSS is observed at 1 V and 10 V. Similarly, at <span class="italic">t</span><small><sub>2</sub></small>, one would assume that both 5 V and 10 V are optimized for IFSS. While, finally at <span class="italic">t</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>, an optimized surface treatment would appear to be present for all three potentials.</span>
        <br/><div class="image_table"><table><tr><td colspan="3" class="imgHolder" id="imgfig2"><a href="/image/article/2021/TA/d1ta07151c/d1ta07151c-f2_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: d1ta07151c-f2.tif" src="/image/article/2021/TA/d1ta07151c/d1ta07151c-f2.gif"/></a></td></tr><tr><td class="pushTitleRight"> </td><td class="image_title"><b>Fig. 2 </b> <span id="fig2"><span class="graphic_title">(a) Hypothetical IFSS-potential correlation at various surface treatment applied potentials and time points (<span class="italic">t</span><small><sub>1–3</sub></small>).

        <p class="otherpara">Nevertheless, without thinking of this process periodically, that data would appear to have no correlation or would be difficult to justify. The shape, period, stability, and consistency of these curves may also vary depending on the fibre origin (PAN <span class="italic">vs.</span> Pitch <span class="italic">vs.</span> Rayon), manufacturing of the precursor materials (air gap <span class="italic">vs.</span> wet spinning), stabilization and oxidation conditions, and electrolyte used in the bath (<span class="italic">e.g.</span><a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2b</a>).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Therefore, given the number of variables, the authors recommend that each optimised surface treatment reported in the literature be considered, largely, in isolation. This is further complicated by additional treatments used in each study, such as alternative desizing processes (thermal <span class="italic">vs.</span> solvent). To be clear, we are not doubting the data and outcomes of these reports, but merely suggesting that they be used to guide researchers in their studies rather than be considered as unambiguous physical truths.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An electrochemical oxidation process follows immediately after PAN fibres have passed through the carbonisation furnaces. This step is essential for improving their adhesive properties as, directly after carbonisation, the carbon fibres are highly chemically inert<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> with weakly bound graphitic layers exposed on the outside of the fibres.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> The electrochemical oxidation process addresses both these flaws by exfoliating the fibres<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> and increasing their chemical reactivity <span class="italic">via</span> the installation of oxygenated species such as phenols, carboxylic acids, and undefined carbonyl derived species (aldehyde, ketone, quinone, <span class="italic">etc.</span>)<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20,21</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Electrochemical oxidation involves applying an electrical potential to the carbon fibres, whilst they are submerged in an aqueous bath. A contact point to the fibres is required (typically in the form of a graphitic roller) which acts as the anode, while graphitic plates submerged in the electrolyte solution act as the cathode.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> Once a potential is applied through this circuit, electron exchange occurs between the fibres and the electrolyte solution. This process subsequently alters fibre topography, mechanical properties and surface chemistry.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23–25</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">While this method is currently the most used protocol for surface modification, there remains several input variables which can be altered to improve adhesion. These are: <span class="italic">electrolyte selection</span> (thought this is typically ammonium bicarbonate), <span class="italic">bath conductivity</span>, <span class="italic">amperage applied</span>, <span class="italic">voltage applied</span> and <span class="italic">treatment time</span>. Some of these variables are not independent, for example amperage and voltage, which are applied either galvanostatically (controlled current density) or potentiostatically (controlled voltage). As such, to maintain a consistent amperage, the applied voltage may change significantly, depending on the resistivity of the submerged fibres. Given the complexities of combining the aforementioned variables, a complete understanding of how each affects one another, and subsequent fibre properties is incomplete. Ideally, a multivariate analysis looking into all parameters would exist.</p>

Conversely, NaOH lead to an increased proportion of carboxylic acid groups, and the occurrence of NaOH adsorbed to the surface. Interestingly, the IFSS of the sample oxidised in NaOH (20 wt%, 5.0 V) could be drastically improved through the removal of excess NaOH from the fibre bundle. Soaking the treated fibres in water for 20 hours resulted in a pH increase to ∼10 and the resulting fibres exhibited a further improvement in IFSS to 44.8 MPa (compared to unsoaked (27.5 MPa) and control 17.3 MPa). This was suggested to be the due to adsorbed NaOH hindering the coupling of surface functional groups to the matrix.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">These data reveal that altering voltage or electrolyte concentration alone is not necessarily a singularly viable strategy to optimise IFSS.

        <p class="otherpara">One of the most common electrolytes used in commercial treatment of fibres is ammonium bicarbonate. Accordingly, a large body of literature exists regarding this electrolyte's effect on carbon fibre surface chemistry. Various studies show that passing the fibres through an electrochemical bath with ammonium bicarbonate as the electrolyte increases the surface content of oxygen-containing functional groups. Qian <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> examined the resulting surface chemistry of CF treated using an ammonium bicarbonate electrolyte and applied current of 20 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>. Overall oxygen content on the fibre surface increased after treatment, which corresponded to increases of 5.6% and 5.0% in –C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O and –COOH moieties, respectively. Conversely, a study conducted by Fukunaga <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> showed a decrease of 3.31% in C–OH content on the fibre surface occurs after undergoing electrochemical treatment in ammonium bicarbonate. The O<small><sub>1s</sub></small>/C<small><sub>1s</sub></small> ratio on the fibre surface however was found to increase by 5.0% but further deconvolution of this data was not carried out. Results by Jiang <span class="italic">et al.</span> reinforce this finding,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> as an 8.5% increase in O<small><sub>1s</sub></small>/C<small><sub>1s</sub></small> ratio was observed with relative increases to C–O and O<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>C–O of 15.2% and 42.8% following oxidation, and a simultaneous 5.6% reduction occurring in C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O.</p>

A trend was observed demonstrating that as C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O and COOH content decreased, C–OH content increased, maintaining the overall oxygen content on the fibre surface at 4.4%. The mechanism for the interchange of these oxygenated functional group is not known, but in this way the desired surface chemistry could possibly be fine-tuned, depending on the intended composite application. This trend of increasing C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O and COOH content with decreasing C–OH surface concentration was also observed by Qian <span class="italic">et al.</span> when considering ammonium bicarbonate electrolytes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Mildly acidic and basic electrolytes (phosphoric acid and ammonium bicarbonate) were compared in parallel by Nakao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> For both electrolytes, increases in the O<small><sub>1s</sub></small>/C<small><sub>1s</sub></small> ratio was documented. Untreated fibres with an O<small><sub>1s</sub></small>/C<small><sub>1s</sub></small> ratio of 0.075 increased to 0.155 and 0.195 after being subjected to electrolysis in phosphoric acid and ammonium bicarbonate solutions, respectively. In both cases oxidation was found to alter fibre surface roughness, though with different outcomes. Phosphoric acid smoothed the fibre surface by 0.01 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> while ammonium bicarbonate roughened the fibre surface by 0.04 m<small><sup>2</sup></small> g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. This would suggest that electrochemical oxidation is not only a chemical modification process, but also elicits a morphological change. Interfacial analysis showed negligible changes in IFSS between the two electrolyte types, suggesting that the physical interactions (keying and interlocking) were not the major contributors to adhesion in this instance.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">While ammonium bicarbonate has been the most investigated electrolyte, insight can be gained from treating the fibres in alternative solutions or solvents. Kim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35"><sup><span class="sup_ref">35</span></sup></a> showed the use of a sulfuric acid electrolyte can attach –SO<small><sub>3</sub></small>H and –SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> functional groups to the fibre surface, both of which possess strong acidity. These authors proposed this to be an influential factor for improving PAN fibre-to-matrix adhesion, however no interfacial assessment was conducted. Kainourgios <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit36"><sup><span class="sup_ref">36</span></sup></a> similarly observed sulfuric acid to introduce SO<small><sub>3</sub></small>H and SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>H functional groups to carbon fibres. However, that study concluded that although tensile strength and modulus increase, the concentration of oxygen groups on the surface was too small to induce any significant change to interfacial adhesion.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Thus far, the impact of electrolyte selection and its effect on surface chemistry has been considered. While this undoubtedly plays a role to modify surface chemistry, many processing variables must also be considered which will affect the final fibre's performance. These variables include solution conductivity, applied current, applied voltage, and treatment time. Each of these variables have been investigated at different times (<span class="italic">vide infra</span>) within the confines of limited electrolyte selection and fibre type. Therefore, only a limited understanding for the scope of the oxidation treatment when considering interfacial adhesion is available.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect667"><span class="b_heading">2.3 Amperage</span></h3>
        <span>Over the years emphasis has also been placed on the effects of current density (galvanostatic treatment) applied to the fibres in the electrolyte bath to alter fibre topography and chemistry. Qian <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a> used an ammonium bicarbonate bath and altered bath amperage between 0 A, 1 A, 5 A, 12 A, and 20 A. Overall, oxygen containing functional groups on the fibre surface increased from 28.7% at 0 amps to 34–35% between 1 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, 5 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and 12 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and any subsequent increase to current density saw decreases in oxygen containing groups. This suggests that the impact of amperage on the total surface oxidation is highly sensitive and indeed shows a plateauing effect (between 1 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and 12 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) before significant drop off may occur.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Interestingly, the ratios of carbonyl, carboxylic acid and alcohol groups was highly variable between the 1 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, 5 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> and 12 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small> conditions. The degree of detected carboxylic acids increased with larger current densities, while carbonyl species decreased. However, when amperage was further increased to 20 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>, a notable increase of hydroxyl (C–OH) groups was observed, in addition to an overall increase in oxygen content. This suggests that oxygen group tailoring is possible over a certain range before severe exfoliation and chemical change occurs at extreme amperages. This exfoliation can lead to significant deterioration of the intrinsic fibre properties, due to the development of surface defects.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A similar study conducted by Yue <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> using potassium nitrate showed the similar trend of oxygen group tailoring. While unsized fibres were found to have the highest content of C–OH and COOH groups on the surface. Any form of alternative oxidation was seen to reduce the presence of these groups and introduce simple carbonyl groups. The overall oxygen content however remained unchanged. With careful application of amperages between 0.05 A, 0.1 A, 0.3 A, 0.5 A, 0.6 A, and 1 A, slightly varied oxygen content was observed, again, with a clear interplay between carbonyl and alcohol/carboxylic acid groups occurring. Again, this supports the theory of amperage being a method of tailoring functional groups while keeping overall oxygen content consistent.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A proposed mechanism for the oxidation of the carbon fibre surface, resulting in changes in C–O functional groups, is outlined above (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig3">Fig. 3</a>). This sequential oxidation highlights the evolution and potentially cyclic type of surface changes occurring over oxidative treatments. The generation of such functional groups, and subsequent etching that would result, would also account for the exfoliation of quantum dots from carbon fibres, reported in 2021.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> This exfoliation process would also cumulatively lead to the generation of pits and defects on the fibre surface, deteriorating the final properties of the carbon fibres.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">While these studies are of value, it is also worth highlighting that the deconvolution of amperage and voltage within an electrochemical oxidation process is near impossible. When one variable changes, so does the other which is further influenced by electrolyte conductivity and the resistivity of the carbon fibres themselves.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In a study conducted by Százdi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> the role of voltage and current density for NaOH and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> were investigated.

The study also found surface roughness of fibres to increase by ∼60% with greater electrolyte concentration and current density.

Fibre manufacturing was conducted on a pilot scale carbon fibre line and used an ammonium bicarbonate electrolyte in the oxidation bath, which had a measured conductivity 20.4 μS cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> during oxidation. Increases in amperage were also observed to increase oxygenated functional groups on the carbon surface while reducing its roughness. The trends observed at a single fibre scale<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> were also shown in subsequent work to be translatable to both mesoscale and macroscale testing of composite laminates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41</span></sup></a></p>

A comparison of IFSS in thermoset epoxy and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) thermoplastic resin were conducted and compared. For epoxy sized fibres, amperage was found to have an ‘optimal’ region for improvements to IFSS, however this optimal condition changed depending on the electrolyte concentration. For polyamide sized fibres, increased current density showed improvements in IFSS for low and moderate electrolyte conductivities however by applying both high current density within a highly conductive oxidation bath, IFSS results rapidly decline. For polyurethane, trends were highly variable across all conditions with no clear trends being determined. The true unique point of this research was the creation of a second order polynomial equation that attempts to provide a mathematic model to predict IFSS as a function of the three input variables.

        <h3 id="sect715"><span class="b_heading">2.4 Sizing</span></h3>
        <span>In the manufacturing process, subsequent to electrochemical oxidation, fibres go through a washing process to remove all excess electrolyte before entering a sizing bath. This is usually the last step within the carbon fibre production line. Sizings used to coat carbon fibres are typically proprietary blends of polymer, emulsifiers, anti-static agents, and stabilisers amongst a cocktail of other additives. The identity of these chemicals is withheld from the end user and are kept in strict confidence. The sizing layer is typically between 100–500 nm, depending on the dilution of the parent emulsion, though some studies suggest it is only 30 to 50 nm thick.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43–45</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">Irrespective of thickness, it is typically between 0.5–1%, by weight, of the fibre, and the vast majority (80–90%) is comprised of film formers. The sizing assists in the processing of fibres into woven materials by protecting the fibre surface from abrasion, preventing the fibre from breaking at contact points, and keeping chopped fibre bundles together to make them easy to handle.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46</span></sup></a> Also, according to a sizing manufacturer, it has benefits for material processing, by such mechanisms as protecting a chopper's blade life and reducing bundle fuzz generation. Sizing is usually selected by its ‘compatibility’ with the intended matrix. However, the compatibility term is not (or is poorly) defined, leading to sizing optimisations for a given resin being conducted empirically. Broadly, the resins for which sizings can be purchased are epoxy, vinyl ester, polyamide, polyurethane, polypropylene, polycarbonate, and polyphenylenesulfide, and thus a very large potion of the commonly used resins are encompassed within this list. Usually, a main constituent of the sizing, as indicated by the manufacturer, is a polymer (or oligomer) of the same type as the intended supporting matrix. For example, a sizing which is targeted towards a final application in polypropylene, will likely contain a portion of polypropylene including a maleated co-monomer to enhance compatibility and adhesion at the interface. Similar, scenarios are true for polyamides, polyurethanes, and thermosets. Also present, to ensure emulsion formation, are a range of surfactants that can be either anionic, cationic, or neutral in structure, and combinations of these (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> anionic/neutral) are often used in the same sizing formulation. These ionic or amphiphilic constituents are commonly not considered when investigating the effect of sizing on fibre–matrix adhesion. Therefore, while a sizing may be classed as compatible overall for a given resin, not all the constituents of that material may be optimal for that resin. Moreover, the fate of these surfactants, film formers, buffers, <span class="italic">etc.</span> is not clear as they may be removed from the fibre surface during deposition of the sizing. This further complicates the picture of the fibre–matrix interface and the effects of surface chemistry and physical mechanics.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The remaining 10–20% of sizing components are the lubricants, anti-static agents, wetting agents, colour modifiers, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Sizing can have several effects on the fibre such as discoloration, resin wetting, ease of chopping, reduction of static, fuzz, and bundle integrity. These can also effect the properties of the final composite part, including thermal stability, surface finish, water resistance, colour, and adhesion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46</span></sup></a> Sizing forms part of the region where the fibre and the matrix meet, known as the ‘fibre–matrix-interface’. The interface displays a unique set of mechanical properties that differs from those of the individual constituents.

The sized T300 sample was found to have an IFSS of 63.7 MPa, while desized fibres were significantly higher at 87.8 MPa, an improvement of 38%. An improvement for desized fibres, though much smaller in magnitude, of 9% was also observed for the T700 fibre sample (89.4 MPa compared to the sized 81.4 MPa). This would suggest that the inherent surface chemistry present between aerospace and automotive grade carbon fibres is fundamentally different.</span>

However, the mixing ratios were different. Epoxy 1 had 57 wt% of the Epikote™ compared to 72 wt% of epoxy 2, and therefore, the amount of hardener was different as well as the corresponding physical properties. As a hardener, Araldite GY298 and Nadic Methyl Anhydride (NMA) was used. The fibres for this study were composed of unsized fibre or those treated with wither an epoxy compatible sizing or an antistatic sizing. For both epoxy matrices the unsized fibres showed the highest IFSS, with IFSS values of 51.9 MPa and 66.0 MPa for epoxy 1 and epoxy 2, respectively. Almost no change was observed for the epoxy compatible sized fibres, with IFSS found to be 50.7 MPa and 64.3 MPa, respectively.

        <p class="otherpara">An extensive investigation by Gnädinger <span class="italic">et al.</span> used a cross-section of sizings with various compatibilities (epoxy, polyurethane, polyamide, and commercially obtained polyurethane), determining IFSS in a polyurethane matrix.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> In that instance, unsized fibres resulted in an IFSS of 84 MPa, a significant improvement compared to all of the sized fibre samples.

The commercially obtained PU compatible sizing resulted in a marked decrease in IFSS (61 MPa), with the polyamide compatible sizing being the poorest performing sample (53 MPa). This work emphasises why sizing optimisation has been (and still is) carried out empirically by most researchers and industries, despite the significant time and cost investment.

        <h3 id="sect803"><span class="b_heading">2.7 Sizing enhancing interfacial adhesion</span></h3>
        <span>In contrast to the reports above, the following studies have found that sizing is advantageous to interfacial adhesion and acts as an intermediate bonding layer between the fibres and the matrix.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In 1993, a study conducted by Drzal and Madhukar examined unsized fibre which had not undergone surface treatment (untreated/unsized), then sized these fibres with epoxy sizing, and surface treated unsized fibres.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44</span></sup></a> Using the SFFT in epoxy, it was found that the epoxy sizing dramatically improves the fibre–matrix adhesion. A 119% increase (37.2 MPa to 81.4 MPa) was found for the epoxy-sized fibres relative to the surface treated/unsized. By evaluating the untreated/unsized fibres they found an IFSS of 68.3 MPa. Therefore, in a simplified view, the sizing component alone accounts for at least 13 MPa of this increase.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">When a solvent-free polyamic acid (PAA) sizing was applied by Yuan <span class="italic">et al.</span> on unsized polyacrylonitrile-based fibres, a significant increase in IFSS was observed for adhesion in polyether sulfone (PES; 33.6 MPa to 49.7 MPa, being a 48% increase).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> In that instance, IFSS improvement was attributed to a higher surface energy of the fibres provided by the very polar sizing agent, leading to better wetting. However, as the IFSS was determined by single fibre pull-out (SFPO), the test samples were heated up to 300 °C before testing which might have implications on converting the sizing, partially or completely, onto a polyimide (PI) type backbone.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">As reported by Yuan <span class="italic">et al.</span>, an unsized, commercially sized (Takemoto S64-size), and a laboratory sized fibre was used to determine the interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) <span class="italic">via</span> short beam shear test in an epoxy matrix.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a> The laboratory sizing was an emulsion of maleic anhydride and glycidyl methacrylate, that were polymerised in the emulsion to generate a polymeric sizing.

While a 14.2% increase of the laboratory sized fibres was found (92.7 MPa) compared to the unsized fibres. It was stated that this is due to a better compatibility of the laboratory made sizing and resin, compared to the commercial sizing.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In the same study mentioned earlier by Gnädinger <span class="italic">et al.</span> it was found that within an epoxy matrix, the epoxy sized fibres perform better (64 MPa), though only marginally, than surface treated/unsized fibres (60 MPa).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a></p>

An increase in IFSS was observed for both sizing types in both resin systems, where a 100% increase was observed from 20 MPa (UTUS in PES resin) to 40 MPa (TBrES) and a 75% increase to 35 MPa (TPESS). The enhancement in IFSS was assumed to come from the penetration of the sizing into the matrix. A different trend was observed for adhesion in an epoxy matrix. Although the IFSS of TBrES (25 MPa) and TPESS (∼24 MPa) fibres was higher than the UTUS (∼20 MPa), it was still lower than the TUS (∼33 MPa) fibres. The low IFSS of the TPESS may be due to the brittle interface with a chemisorbed and physisorbed layer.</p>

        <span>Lou <span class="italic">et al.</span> stated that sizing only fulfils the purpose of a lubricant since decreasing the roughness is a negative effect on the interfacial adhesion and therefore the right choice of sizing is only determined by being compatible with the matrix.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> Similarly, Gnädinger <span class="italic">et al.</span> highlights the requirement of matching sizings for the desired resin to facilitate both fibre–matrix adhesion and protect the fibre during processing.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> In a study conducted by Wu <span class="italic">et al.</span> the IFSS was determined using a microbond test with different high strength carbon fibres from different manufactures in both an epoxy and a bismaleimide (BMI) resin.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66</span></sup></a> A comparison of the results was drawn between commercially sized and desized fibres highlighting that a definite conclusion from that work cannot be made since each fibre sample (sized and desized) and resin combination provides unique properties. It is stated that roughness and oxygen content are less effective at influencing IFSS than wetting (contact angle) and reactions of sizing and resin. This seems conflicting as the wettability and reactions of the sizing would be influenced by the oxygenous species on the fibre surface.</span>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect840"><span class="b_heading">2.9 Concurrent effects</span></h3>
        <span>The variables associated with electrochemical oxidation and sizing have thus far been considered independently. There remains a question regarding how these surface treatments may influence one another concurrently to impact final fibre properties.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Stojcevski <span class="italic">et al.</span> provided a comprehensive study into the effects of altered sizing content and electrochemical oxidative current density across 15 fibre types.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> By quantifying relative improvements to IFSS attributed to oxidation and sizing separately, comparisons between ‘true’ IFSS, and ‘predicted’ IFSS may be made. For epoxy system RIM935/937 the difference between true and predicted value was below 14.8%. For epoxy system DGEBA/DDM, this difference was below 30.8%. This suggests that there may be some masking in IFSS performance occurring between the two treatment mechanisms. It is possible that the two variables work independently to improve fibre-to-matrix adhesion, however the degree to which this occurs may also depend on the resin system being analysed. Further research into such concurrent effects is required.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Hendlmeier <span class="italic">et al.</span> similarly investigated the effects of electrolytic conductivity (8, 16, 24 μS cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), current density (0.5, 1.0, 1.5 A m<small><sup>−2</sup></small>) and sizing variation (epoxy, polyamide, polyurethane) for both epoxy and thermoplastic resin.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24,42</span></sup></a> When comparing the results of both studies, the underlaying chemical structure of the surface treatment seemed to play a major role on the effect of interfacial adhesion.

        <h3 id="sect852"><span class="b_heading">2.10 Summary of traditional surface treatments and sizings</span></h3>
        <span>Conflicts within the literature are likely derived from studies investigating fibres with different specifications and from different manufactures. The next unknown factor comes with commercially available sizing. Most suppliers label their sizing as ‘compatible’ with a given resin; however, the reasons for this compatibility are unclear. To combat this, several studies reported the effects of prepared sizings, investigated on a laboratory scale. The next variable is the resin matrix. Even though most of the research is done with epoxy resin, it is rarely provided from the same supplier between studies. Therefore, subtle changes in chemical compositions, curing regimes <span class="italic">etc.</span> can be expected and lead to different interactions at the fibre surface. Additionally, looking at a large body of research in which different resin systems were used, other than epoxy, makes it difficult to compare results between studies. Another pertinent factor is studies in which fibres are desized and subsequently resized. It remains unclear what effect desizing has on the fibre surface morphology, chemical composition, and if residual sizing is present. Given these variables, it is difficult to compare the interfacial adhesion of a desized fibre to a commercially sized fibre or even an unsized fibre.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The extent of this variation between techniques and samples precludes the outright identification of sizing's distinct effect on interfacial adhesion. This discrepancy exists through difficulty in aligning factors completely enough to be able to draw scientifically fair comparisons, and this issue may not be rectified in future investigations.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect858"><span class="a_heading">3 Plasma treatments and modification</span></h2>
      <span>Chemical bonding and physical interlocking serve as crucial requirements for improving interfacial adhesion between carbon fibres and the supporting resin. A powerful method towards achieving both properties is <span class="italic">via</span> plasma treatments.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">In most systems, plasmas form by the ionization of a gas or vapor by thermal excitement and/or by applying strong magnetic fields. In such highly energetic systems, plasmas comprise of molecules or atoms that exist as positively charged ions (usually by the abstraction of an electron) and are countered by negatively charged free electrons, making the entire system (approximately) electrically neutral.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">Upon exposing a material or substrate to a plasma source, chemical functional groups can be imparted from the plasma onto the surface of a material. Furthermore, by altering the exposure limits of the substrate, the degree of surface chemistry imparted can be adjusted. Often these exposure limits are varied <span class="italic">via</span> modulation of magnetic fields, temperature, substrate distance from source, or the plasma source itself.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Plasmas can operate under a wide set of parameters, and because of this, a single variable adjustment (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> flow rate, time, substrate distance, power and frequency) can lead to dramatic effects on the physical and chemical properties of the surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">For the case of carbon fibres, most modifications focus on their direct exposure to a plasma source. In some instances, a chemical vapor with a relatively low ionization energy is also injected into the system – depositing a film onto the substrate surface. A monomeric vapor can also be injected, reacting with highly energetic free-electrons and initiating free-radical polymerisation within the vapor phase. In both cases, thick (100 nm to 1 mm) films can be deposited or grown on the carbon fibre surface. In this section plasma treatments that evidently lead to monolayer-grafted chemistries are grouped into non-polymer forming plasmas, whereas those that form thin films are considered as polymer-forming plasmas.</p>

Though, of course, excessive ablation can lead to deterioration of the physical properties of the fibres.

        <h3 id="sect883"><span class="b_heading">3.2 Elemental plasmas</span></h3>
        <span>Over the last decade, a number of studies have investigated the effect of elemental plasmas on the interfacial adhesion of carbon fibres. In many instances, these studies perform plasma treatments at atmospheric pressures, circumventing the requirement of a pressure chamber. Accordingly, these conditions should be favoured under the context of scale-up as atmospheric plasma apparatus are the most ideal for retrofitting onto existing industrial carbon fibre production lines. As such, treatments that use atmospheric conditions are clearly stated.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In 2011, Zhao and co-workers used helium/oxygen gas blends at atmospheric pressures to install polar chemistries over a range of short treatment times (1–5 minutes).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit73"><sup><span class="sup_ref">73</span></sup></a> After 1 minute, very little improvement in the adhesion was obtained (6.9%), however after 5 minutes adhesion rose significantly, 61.2%, relative to untreated and unsized fibres (12 K AU4, Hexcel Cooperation, USA). No decrease in the tensile properties of the fibres was observed; however, it was found that surface roughness increased slowly for treatments under 3 minutes (by less than 15%), but then dramatically after 5 minutes (55.8%). Interestingly, XPS data suggests the sample exposed for 3 minutes showed the highest level of oxygen content, despite having only marginal adhesion gain. Thus, the authors concluded surface roughness played the dominant role for adhesion in this study.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Borooj <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74</span></sup></a> investigated low-pressure (13.33 Pa) oxygen plasma sources and reported similar results. After two minutes, a maximum increase of up to 28% in ILSS was observed, using a room temperature oxygen plasma. Treatment times ranged from 1 to 5 minutes and plasma power from 50–200 W. Additional findings concluded that as plasma power and exposure time grew, fibres began to degrade. SEM data showed an increase in surface roughness as treatment time continues, although no quantitative roughness data was available. FTIR spectroscopic data of the fibres show a very slight increase in carboxyl and carbonyl stretches, though this may be attributed to background fluctuation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Borooj and co-workers performed a thorough investigation of low-pressure oxygen plasmas (13.3 Pa) under various operating parameters, including oxygen flow rate, power and treatment time.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit71"><sup><span class="sup_ref">71</span></sup></a> Maximum adhesion gains were observed within the first minute of treatment time; from 65.57 MPa of the control, to 85.92 MPa (31% improvement). However, as treatment time progressed after 5 minutes, ILSS decreased by around 19% from the peak measurement to 68.62 MPa (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8</a>). Faster oxygen flow rates improved ILSS; increasing from 20 standard cubic centimetres per minute (sccm) to 100 sccm improved ILSS by 8%. The study concluded that power has a marginal effect on ILSS while lower energies providing the optimal improvement. Plasma treatment increased the surface roughness as high as 65% relative to pristine fibres, which is believed to improve wettability and mechanical interlocking with polymer resins.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit75"><sup><span class="sup_ref">75</span></sup></a> As treatment time and power increased, so too did the risk of partially destroying the surface of the fibre, and a decrease in roughness/wettability was observed, alongside a reduction in ILSS.</p>

In that work, Moosburger-Will <span class="italic">et al.</span> exposed SIGRAFIL® C30 T050 carbon fibres (directly after carbonization) to a 90 W ammonia plasma source over a variety of treatment times and low-pressures (50 Pa).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69</span></sup></a> XPS analysis highlighted a dramatic increase in nitrogen content, about a factor of 2 greater than the oxygen content, which showed little change when compared to the oxygen content of unmodified carbon fibres.

        <p class="otherpara">Despite this increase in wettability and nitrogen content, no discernible difference in adhesion (within error) was obtained in epoxy, measured <span class="italic">via</span> single fibre push out tests.

        <p class="otherpara">That conclusion is challenged somewhat by Lew and co-workers, who treated pristine carbon fibres with an ammonia/ethylene blended plasma as a pre-treatment step for depositing SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nano particles under low pressures (∼10 Pa).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit79"><sup><span class="sup_ref">79</span></sup></a> The authors performed SFFT on these plasma treated fibres and reported a 141% improvement in adhesion in epoxy resin.

Interestingly, no decrease in tensile properties was observed, even after the extended plasma exposure time. The variances between Lew and Horn may originate from differing surface roughness, particularly caused by the polymerisation of ethylene in the latter.

        <p class="otherpara">The GNW's were grown over different treatment durations, five in total at 15 minutes intervals ranging from 0 minutes to 60 minutes, and an extended 90 minutes treatment. It was found that the nano-wall height has an almost linear growth rate, however the length of graphene walls plateaued at ∼300 nm after 60 minutes. The authors reported IFSS improvements of up to 222.8% (peaking at 30 minutes exposure time) and ILSS gains upwards of 41.1%.

        <p class="otherpara">Surface roughness increased dramatically; from 15.9 nm for control fibres, to 191 nm for coated fibres. Surface wettability also increased as a function of wall height; with an observed contact angle of 51.8° for control, to 28.7° for surface coated fibres. Tensile strength was unaffected after treatment, suggesting that lower temperatures are ideal for fibre preservation. IFSS data was obtained <span class="italic">via</span> SFFT, with the highest performing wall height (4.2 μm) peaking at 112.4 MPa (118.7% improvement <span class="italic">vs.</span> control).

        <p class="otherpara">Interestingly, a similar treatment using radio-frequency plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (RF-PECVD) was reported by Fisher and co-workers that achieved reel-to-reel surface modifications at low pressures (10–20 mbar).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a> In this work, the authors produced graphitic petals (GP) on the surface of plasma-treated carbon fibres, as well as GNW, using a mixture of gases (Ar, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, N<small><sub>2</sub></small> &amp; O<small><sub>2</sub></small>) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9a</a>).</p>

        <h3 id="sect975"><span class="b_heading">3.6 Wet chemical modification</span></h3>
        <span>In this section we will focus on the use of more traditional approaches to modify carbon fibres, where they have been treated more like a chemical, rather than a material upon which to deposit another substance. Typically, these fibres have undergone a surface reaction while submerged in solution or similar medium. A very common means of undertaking this approach to surface modification is to first prepare the surface for derivatization. The oxidation of desized carbon fibres by emersion in concentrated nitric acid at reflux is routinely used. This process installs a range of functional groups on the fibre surface that can be assessed immediately for interfacial benefits. Alternatively, the installed chemical functionalities (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, COOH, PhOH, CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>OH, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) can be used for molecular elaboration of the carbon fibre surface <span class="italic">via</span> esterification or carbodiimide chemistries.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Extensive research has been conducted to identify the effects of acid surface treatments on carbon fibre and its ability to interact at the fibre-resin interface. In general, oxidation is seen to improve the adhesion of carbon fibres to a range of polymers, though, as mentioned above it can also result in deleterious effects on the original strength and stiffness of the carbon fibres. There is a large amount of conflicting data regarding the point at which the trade-offs shift from the benefits gained from functional group installation to physical properties dominated by the deterioration of the underlying fibre.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In one study,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a> the effects of treatment time in concentrated nitric acid were analysed over varying intervals (0 to 160 minutes). Initially, the tensile strength, degree of surface oxidation, and surface energy all increased before the tensile strength and surface oxidation stabilised after 20 min by no longer show obvious improvements. The fibre diameter was seen to rapidly decrease after 40 minutes of treatment, coinciding with a decline in fibre strength, thus 20 minutes was identified as the optimal treatment duration. Another publication indicated similar trends, whereby exposing carbon fabric to nitric acid for extended periods of time decreases the properties of the material. In this study, Tiwari <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89</span></sup></a> found that treatment beyond 90 minutes was detrimental to the properties of the fibre.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Further attention was given by Tiwari <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit90"><sup><span class="sup_ref">90</span></sup></a> toward finding the optimum length of time for nitric acid treatment to achieve an increase in adhesion with the matrix without inflicting strength reducing damage to the fibres. Rather than use a bundle (or tow) of fibres, the nitric acid treatment in this case was applied to a carbon fabric for various time intervals (15–180 minutes). The interfacial adhesion was conducted using a polyetherimide matrix and evaluated for mechanical and abrasive wear properties. Like their previous work, it was observed that a 90 minutes treatment time was most ideal to achieve maximum possible enhancement in adhesion and tribological properties. Analysis by FTIR revealed adhesion was improved due to the inclusion of oxygenated functional groups combined with increased surface roughness, assessed <span class="italic">via</span> SEM. Furthermore, the ILSS and flexural strength were maximised using a 90 minutes treatment (71% and 29% improvements, respectively) though the tensile strength, showed maximum strength after a 60 minutes treatment.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Similar work was carried out by Vautard <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit91"><sup><span class="sup_ref">91</span></sup></a> whereby IMS 5000 fibres were subjected to a series of oxidation times, from minutes to hours in boiling nitric acid, and the surface chemistries were examined. In this work, it was found that a rapid increase in oxygen was observed in the first few minutes, though after 60 minutes the oxygen content of the surface plateaued. This plateau was attributed to the alcohol and acid groups undergoing conversion to esters and ethers <span class="italic">etc.</span>, thereby giving no net gain in oxygenated species. Though, it should be noted though that this conclusion remains speculative as no supporting spectral or physical data was provided.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The work by Vautard <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit91"><sup><span class="sup_ref">91</span></sup></a> also included the IFSS of the oxidised fibres in an acrylate derived resin cured by either UV or electron beam (e-beam) irradiation. Oxidised fibres in UV cured resin showed up to a 20% improvement in IFSS, but the same samples in e-beam cured resin were all significantly lower. This suggests that the mechanism of curing influenced the adhesion, and characterisation of nano-roughness did not correlate to adhesion further supporting a chemical interaction at the interface. This effect is potentially due to the presence of persistent radical species on the surface of the carbon fibres, stabilized due to the extensive conjugated aromatic network, but again, this remains speculative.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The effect nitric acid treatment duration has on surface heterogeneity of the resulting oxidized carbon fibres has also been examined,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a> with treated fibres characterised by SEM, AFM, XPS, and Raman spectroscopy. These analyses indicated that the longest exposure (180 minutes) resulted in the most heterogenous surfaces. Notably, fibres treated for 120 and 180 minutes show an increase in the overall nitrogen content. This excess nitrogen was at a higher binding energy in the N1s XPS spectra (<span class="italic">cf.</span> ∼405 eV) suggesting the incorporation of oxidized nitrogenous species onto the surface <span class="italic">via</span> aromatic ring nitration or possibly anion intercalation. The Raman and AFM data indicates the etching process removes surface-bound amorphous carbon and/or weakly bound graphene surface sheets. This latter point is consistent with the previously discussed reports of reduced fibre diameter after extended etching periods.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Older reports have similar findings,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> suggesting the strength of the fibre increases with initial nitric acid treatments, but eventually decreases for prolonged duration of treatment. Collectively, this indicates that prolonged treatments of both concentrated and dilute nitric acid can etch pits on the fibre surface, decreasing fibre strength, also longer treatment times correspond to a more significant weight loss. Nevertheless, the authors suggest that both mechanical properties and fracture behaviour are improved with physical interlocking and chemical bonding of fibres and matrix.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another report,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> identifies that nitric acid oxidation treatments can be used to generate acidic functional groups on the fibre surface, with that the acid capacity (typically determined by titration with an hydroxide base) of the carbon fibres increasing linearly with increasing oxidation time. Of the functional groups found to exist on the fibre surface, the majority were carboxylic acids, though it should be noted that phenolic alcohols may also react with hydroxide anions and thus contribute to these data. This work found both tensile strength and weight decrease with extended treatments, as is consistent with previous and later reports. Following this, subjecting the fibres to a second treatment of refluxing in sodium hydroxide, was found to remove partially oxidised graphitic fragments.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Conversely, Yusong <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> also using a nitric acid treatment, proposed that fibre–matrix, adhesion gains observed in ultra-high weight polyethylene was due to the treatment increasing the morphological features of the fibre surface only, and not due to the installed chemistry. This was primarily attributed to the striations along the fibre axis and little focus was placed by the authors on the fibre surface chemistry.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Nitric acid treatment on short fibres (&lt;5 mm) has also been conducted.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> These fibres were treated with ethanol and concentrated nitric acid prior to their addition to an epoxy resin used to generate laminates by infusion into carbon fabrics. The effects of oxidized short fibre content and treatment time were examined and the ILSS of composites comprising of oxidised fibre was consistently higher than the ILSS of untreated fibre. This effect was observed at very low short fibre loadings of 0.07 wt%. Interestingly, the introduction of ethanol to the oxidation solution extended the optimal treatment time to 4 hours for improvements in ILSS of the composite. SEM indicates that the surface of treated fibres feature deep gullies and a large number of punctate spots and bumps in comparison to the untreated fibre. Whether or not the introduction of the organic solvent influenced the optimal treatment time by diluting the etchant or if it facilitated additional reactions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Fischer esterification) with functional groups on the fibre surface were not discussed.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Similarly, oxidation of meso-phase pitch-based carbon fibres using nitric acid showed intercalation of the nitrate anion into the graphitic structure.

The introduction of oxygenated functional groups was supported by FT-IR analysis and an increase in hydrophilicity was confirmed <span class="italic">via</span> the measurement of contact angle. While adhesion was not explicitly examined in this work, the friction and wear behaviours of the fibres were evaluated. The carbon fabric treated by hydrothermal oxidation led to changes in the surface morphology of fibres and the appearance of carbonyl groups. The authors made a composite with the modified fibres that showed improved physical properties, attributed to enhanced interfacial adhesion, though ILSS was not measured. Hydrothermal oxidation treatment of 100–120 °C improved the tribological properties and would be beneficial for abrasive wear performance, though increasing the hydrothermal temperature to 140 °C decreased the fibre strength.</p>

Carbon fibres were examined after being soaked in nitric acid for a set time (30, 60, 90, 120, and 720 min) before subjecting them to elevated temperatures in a muffle furnace (350–550 °C). The authors state that soaking for 90 minutes and heating at 420–430 °C gave an optimal ratio of micromechanical interlocking <span class="italic">via</span> surface etching and minimal property degradation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The previous two articles highlight a persistent inconsistency within the literature, whereby similar fibre treatments result in variable outcomes. While some variation would be expected between reports, this example shows a stark contrast between optimal treatments. This is to say that the research has been conducted diligently and thoroughly, though the fibre origin, processing conditions, and precursor are all unknowns and thus provide an uneven foundation to compare results.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Around a similar time, Ozcan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> examined only thermally treating carbon fibres (up to 900 °C) under a nitrogen atmosphere.

The fibre–matrix adhesion within a vinyl ester resin was improved for thermally treated fibres, coinciding with a change in failure mode suggesting changes to the interfacial interactions of the thermally treated carbon fibre samples. The authors postulate that the heating process results in the formation of radicals on the surface that can react with the vinyl ester groups, thereby increasing adhesion.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">As noted above, the oxidation of carbon fibres can lead to a reduction in the physical properties of carbon fibres <span class="italic">via</span> overoxidation. This effect seems to be enhanced by sulfuric acid, as supported by work carried out by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> where fibres were acid treated (3<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 v/v H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> and HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, respectively) for different durations. The optimum treatment time was 15 min, as determined by improvements in interfacial shear strength, fracture toughness and tensile strength. However, prolonged exposure (after 30 min) to the surface treatment resulted in the introduction of surface flaws which lead to a reduction in properties. These times are significantly reduced from those reported in nitric acid solutions alone and are possibly due to the enhanced formation of nitrous acid (HNO<small><sub>2</sub></small>), the ‘active’ oxidative species.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Studies have been conducted to compare the chemical and physical impact of various chemical treatments.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102</span></sup></a> Carbon fibres were treated with hydrochloric acid and nitric acid as well as argon and oxygen cold plasmas. To evaluate the changes imparted to the CF surface, AFM, SEM, XPS, tensile strength and Raman techniques were used. These analyses found that the nitric acid treatment (durations of 5, 10 and 20 minutes) caused the most pronounced chemical changes to the surface, introducing the most extensive chemical functionality and increased surface roughness. However, the nitric acid samples observed a larger decrease in tensile strength compared to fibres treated with hydrochloric acid, again consistent with the oxidative nature of the solvent, the proposed etching, and the observation of increased surface roughness.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An alternative approach to oxidative surface modification was taken by Koutroumanis <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit103"><sup><span class="sup_ref">103</span></sup></a> that focused on using a mild chemical process to functionalised CFs <span class="italic">via</span> an epoxidation reaction at room temperature. Their treatment consists of immersing the fibres in a solution <span class="italic">meta</span>-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (<span class="italic">m</span>CPBA) to epoxidise the fibre surface, installing chemical groups which can be used as reactive synthetic handles towards nucleophiles. Presumably this is targeting isolated alkenes in non-aromatic systems, as this approach typically does not work for the epoxidation of aromatic rings due to their stability imbibed by resonance. The authors used XPS analysis to quantify the carbon and oxygen presence on the fibre surface. These results indicate a significant increase in oxygen, including oxygen species attributed to epoxides on the carbon fibre surface. Furthermore, a 2.3-fold increase in the maximum interfacial shear stress was observed for the treated fibres in an epoxy resin, being 3.3 MPa for untreated fibre, 4.7 MPa for a 2 minutes treatment, and 7.7 MPa for a 5 minutes treatment. These increases were attributed to the additional chemical bonding by cross linking reactions between the epoxy resin and the oxygen moieties.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Objectively, the ring opening of the surface bound epoxides by a bis-amine hardener in an epoxy resin is not likely, as epoxides typically react <span class="italic">via</span> an S<small><sub>N</sub></small>2 reaction requiring the nucleophile to approach the epoxide from 180° behind the oxygen atom. In this instance, this reaction scenario is not possible as the fibre itself prevents this orientation of nucleophile. It is possible, however, that the epoxidation has been carried out on isolated alkenes, plus there is also the possibility that hydroxy and phenolic groups have been oxidised to the corresponding aldehyde or ketone which can react with the amines in the epoxy resin formulation. Additionally, this approach benefits from no notable alterations to the surface morphology of the fibres observed by SEM.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In other work,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit104"><sup><span class="sup_ref">104</span></sup></a> CF was modified by oxidation in a mixture of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> and KClO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, followed by subsequent treatment with a silane coupling agent (γ-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APS). The intention behind this strategy was to increase chemical reactivity at the fibre surface while simultaneously increasing the fibre surface area and roughness. When the carbon fibres were oxidised, the oxygen content increased, expressed by an increase in the O/C ratio. Further treatment of these fibres with APS increased the C–O–R content, while concurrently decreasing the presence of O–C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O groups. The surface characteristics and morphological changes of these treated fibres were investigated by SEM, XPS, Laser Raman Spectroscopy (LRS), and FT-IR (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig10">Fig. 10</a>).

The minor changes in the <span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>D</sub></small>/<span class="italic">I</span><small><sub>G</sub></small> ratios of the treated fibres did suggest a small increase in the disorder of the aromatic surface, consistent with the installation of sp<small><sup>3</sup></small> hybridised carbons.

        <p class="otherpara">ILSS was examined in a phenolic resin matrix, and the APS treatment improved ILSS (12%) compared to the acid-only pre-treatment. The authors concluded this improvement is due to an increase in chemical bonding, rather than the enhanced mechanical interlocking gained when fibres were subjected solely to an acidic pre-treatment. The choice of a phenolic matrix to examine ILSS is unusual, as the presence of amino terminated small molecules on the fibre surface would not, theoretically, interact favourably with the highly aromatic resin. Though, it is possible that hydrogen bonding (or acid–base interactions) may occur between the acidic phenolic protons and the basic amine groups.</p>

It was shown that the POSS chemistry itself has potential to tailor the fibre–matrix interface to thermoplastics such as polyester. The surface roughness after grafting methacryl POSS or methacrylisobutyl POSS was almost the same at 131.6 nm and 129.6 nm, respectively. Similarly, dynamic contact angle analysis revealed similar surface energies, and both treated samples exhibited values higher than that of the as-received carbon fibres. The methacrylolsobutyl derivative increased ILSS by 31.9% and the methacryl–POSS increased ILSS by 42.6%. The IFSS of methacryl–POSS grafted CFs was significantly increased (102.2%) compared to pristine fibre. The toughening effect of POSS is well known, and in this report the total absorbed impact energy for the methacryl–POSS sample was 1.72 J, higher than the as received (1.00 J) and methacryoylisobutyl POSS grafted carbon fibres (1.43 J).</p>

When IFSS was determined by single fibre pull-out, increases of over 70% were realised for the treated fibres. Comparison of cryo-fractured specimens using SEM showed significant differences in fibre debonding, with the POSS grafted fibres showing obvious improvements in interfacial adhesion through a pull-out fibre decrease and no observed interfacial debonding. A potential shortcoming of nanomaterial deposition approaches is the extended time needed to modify the fibre surface. These processes often involve multi-step sequences ranging from hours to days in duration making their application challenging at a large scale or by a continuous process. Nevertheless, these types of studies provide useful insight into the interface mechanics and effects to improve fibre–matrix adhesion.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In a bid to improve the mechanical properties of the engineering plastic polyoxymethylene (POM), composites (POM/CF) containing nitric acid treated (25 °C for 24 hours) carbon fibres have been investigated (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11b</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">109</span></sup></a> Polyoxymethylene thermoplastics contain acetal, polyacetal, and poly(formaldehyde) motifs, and are used in applications requiring low friction and high stiffness, such as gears and seals.

Analysis of the nitric acid treated fibres revealed the roughness of the surface increased along with an increase in disorder, and FTIR suggested the introduction of OH and C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>O groups. The modified fibre also improved flexural strength and modulus of POM/CF composites by up to 40% in each instance.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Further insight into the changes of the fibres' surface after nitric acid treatment was gained using Raman spectroscopy, revealing that the acid treatment reduced crystallite size at the fibre surface increasing the percentage of disorder.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">109</span></sup></a> This would be consistent with the etching of carbon edge planes away from the fibre surface and the installation of hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, as supported by FTIR. Together, the evidence supports that the nitric acid treatment increases the number of flaws, roughness of the surface and disorder of carbon atoms on fibre. Furthermore, the treated fibres had superior adhesion to the POM matrix, which may be attributed to the grafting of functional groups to the fibre surface that are able to hydrogen bond with the highly oxygenated resin.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">This approach of APS surface modification has seen routine use in the literature and is typically a direct adaptation of glass substrate surface modification. It is far less effective on carbon fibres, due to the lack of alcohol groups in very close proximity to each other, thus the tethering mechanism is less stable and even less likely to occur considering the heterogeneity of the CF surface and the dispersity of any hydroxy groups present.

No change in the tensile modulus and strength of the fibres resulted, showing that this approach enables the retention of the critical physical properties that carbon fibres are valued for.

        <p class="otherpara">Notably, in that work, the authors use a combination of TGA, FT-IR and XPS to determine a grafting content of polymer, found to be 10.2%. It is difficult to determine if this is a high or low number as this type of quantification is not usually carried out.

This was done, as previously described, <span class="italic">via</span> oxidation of the fibre and subsequent amide formation with a polyamino linking unit.

      <span>Commercial production of carbon fibre incorporates the use of electrochemical oxidation to modify the functional groups on the fibre surface.

The use of fluorine-containing molecules is a good option as this atom is readily identifiable through XPS and is not (typically) observed in unmodified carbon fibres. The attachment of 4-fluorophenylacetic acid to the surface of PAN-CF has been achieved using oxidative electrochemistry <span class="italic">via</span> the Kolbe decarboxylation reaction (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig25">Fig. 25</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a> This modification is facilitated by using a constant potential of +1.75 V (<span class="italic">vs.</span> Ag/AgCl) in acetonitrile with a tetrabutylammonium hydroxide electrolyte.

It is perhaps more elegant than simple oxidation in an acidic or alkaline medium, though this makes it more delicate. Notably, this modification is enabled by the application of a reductive potential to the carbon fibres, in contrast to most other methods that use oxidative approaches. The reduction of diazonium salts and their covalent attachment to carbon fibre was reported by Delamar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> That work explored the attachment of a nitrophenyl moiety to the carbon fibre surface <span class="italic">via</span> the reduction of the corresponding 4-nitrobenzenediazonium salt.

Alternative means of reaching this amine group include the concurrent attachment and reduction of the nitro group when performed in a protic solvent, or the hydrolysis of the acetyl group of the grafted 4-acetamidobenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. Grafting compounds bearing two diazonium moieties resulted in attachment of one, then hydrolysis of the second to a phenol group, as seen with the commercially available bis-diazonium dye, Fast Blue B.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> In this case, the presence of the grafted aromatic compound could be confirmed through oxidation of the diazo to a nitro group (NaNO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, Cu) or through electrophilic substitution (H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, HNO<small><sub>3</sub></small>). This was necessary for characterisation due to the instability of the second diazo group once bound to the surface. The post modification of the attached surface groups also served as a demonstration of their availability for typical chemical reactions. Indeed, that report also demonstrated the reaction of the amine or phenol moieties with epoxides, identical to the reactive functional group of many commercially used resins.

        <p class="otherpara">The use of potentiostatic control (−1.0 V, 10–30 min) has been reported to allow the formation of multilayers and showed greater increases in resistivity (up to +250%). The greatest increase in resistivity was found to be the phenyl derivative (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26a</a>, bottom right), with this sample exhibiting an IFSS of 38 ± 1 MPa, a 19% increase over the control (32 ± 2 MPa).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">173</span></sup></a> (Note: the sodium-carboxylate sample (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26a</a>, bottom middle) in this body of work was achieved through submersion of the carboxylic acid derivative in a NaOH solution for 1 min).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The IFSS can largely be influenced by the types of functional groups grafted to the CF surface. Servinis <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a> examined the effect on IFSS after grafting of surface bound amine, carboxylic and lipophilic amide groups. These modifications were achieved using cyclic voltammetry (−1.0 V to +1.0 V, <span class="italic">vs.</span> Ag/AgCl, 0.02 V s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 10 scans), and resulted in significant improvements to IFSS. Samples bearing anilinic nitrogenous groups, able to form crosslinks in an epoxy resin, showed the greatest improvement (49 ± 2 MPa, +172%) compared to control (18 ± 1 MPa), as determined by SFFT in an epoxy resin. Despite the beneficial effects of covalent interactions between fibre and resin, non-covalent interactions, with no crosslinking, also showed improved IFSS (carboxylic, 21 ± 4 MPa; lipophilic amide, 24 ± 2 MPa).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">To minimise the occurrence of multilayers, the cyclic voltammetry process was reduced to 6 scans at a scan rate of 0.02 V s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (from −1.0 V to +1.0 V <span class="italic">vs.</span> Ag/AgCl). Again, a variety of functional groups were studied, and all modifications demonstrated an increase in fibre resistivity (up to +202%, compared to control), indicating attenuation of the exposed graphitic surface.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Also reported, was the improvement in IFSS when these samples were tested <span class="italic">via</span> the micro-pullout method in maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene. Again, the aniline derivative showed the greatest response, manifesting as a 67% increase in IFSS (25 ± 3 MPa <span class="italic">vs.</span> 15 ± 1 MPa control). This was attributed to the reactive crosslinking between the amine rich fibre surface and the maleic anhydride co-monomer in the polymer backbone.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The successful grafting was supported <span class="italic">via</span> physical analysis (XPS and TOF-SIMS) together with the effect on IFSS in an epoxy matrix, which was consistent with insights provided by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The effect of aniline groups increasing interfacial adhesion has also been observed on a larger scale.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> Stojcevski <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> demonstrated that fibres bearing this same aniline moiety showed improvements in IFSS using the SFFT method (39.6 ± 5.6 MPa compared to control 19.5 ± 0.5 MPa). This gain translated well to a larger scale, resulting in increased failure loads. Important findings in that work were that the orientation and placement of surface modified fibres was extremely influential in the composite's overall strength. For instance, a composite made entirely of functionalised fibre was outperformed by a hybrid mixture of functionalised and control fibre. This was due to the strategic manipulation of local interphase properties of the composite in areas that would benefit most, rather than a globally modified composite which could potentially lead to a brittle interface.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations have also informed the design of molecules to be bound to the surface. In a report by Demir <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176</span></sup></a> MD simulation was used to estimate the interfacial shear <span class="italic">stress</span> (ISS) of compounds with either <span class="italic">para</span>- or <span class="italic">meta</span>-substitution patterns around an aryl ring. This work also included a small molecule possessing functionality at both <span class="italic">meta</span>-positions of the aryl ring. The carbon fibre surfaces were decorated with these compounds, again with the electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26b</a>).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The ISS that resulted from MD simulations exposed very consistent trends with the experimentally determined IFSS, with <span class="italic">para</span>- and <span class="italic">bis-meta</span>- substitution giving the best performance, though all modifications resulted in improvement (compared to control, ISS: 0.04 ± 0.11; IFSS: 34.4 ± 1.4 MPa). Interestingly, the introduction of a second reactive group in the <span class="italic">bis-meta</span>- sample did not result in an interface twice as strong.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Further use of MD simulations to influence design has been reported for bolo-amphiphilic compounds.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> In that work, the mechanical interlocking of a long, amphiphilic chain within a resin matrix was simulated and correlated with experimental work.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The increase in interfacial adhesion was observed <span class="italic">via</span> IFSS, from the control (18.1 ± 0.9 MPa) to the amphiphilic surface (69.2 ± 7.5 MPa), representing an increase of +283%. This structure consisted of 6 ethylene oxide groups, terminated by a C18 alkyl tail. The compound was imparted onto the surface through the initial grafting of 4-ethynylbenzenediazonium, leading to protruding alkyne groups, which were then subjected to click chemistry conditions to form the 1,2,3-triazole with desired functionality (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26c</a>, top). MD simulations suggested that a similar gain in IFSS could be achieved through a significantly smaller arch-like structure that anchored to the CF surface through two attachment points.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> This would allow the epoxy matrix polymer chains to thread through the arch, thus locking the two in a non-covalent interaction and improve interface interactions (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26c</a>, bottom). This threading was encouraged by the hydrophilic linking unit of the two anchoring points.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Indeed, a similar IFSS gain of 276% (68.1 ± 9.3 MPa) in IFSS was observed compared to the control (18.1 ± 0.9 MPa).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> It is also worth noting that all treatments investigated in this work had no deleterious effects on the fibre's mechanical properties. In several instances some improvements in these properties actually coincided with increased tensile strength.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The use of electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts serves as an operationally simple method of tailoring carbon fibre surfaces to tune the polarity or hydrophilicity (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26d</a>). Arnold <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> demonstrated the reduction of aryl diazonium salts bearing a nitro group in the presence of a perfluorinated alkyliodide compound to induce an extremely hydrophobic surface (WCA up to 139.9 ± 1.0°, from control 98.4 ± 0.6°).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The carbon fibres could be prepared with surface groups such as aryl-nitro, aryl-amine (from electrochemical reduction of nitro groups), combinations of both of these with perfluorinated alkyl chains, and a surface with only perfluorinated alkyl chains. The attachment of alkyl chains was achieved through the use of a sacrificial diazonium species (2,6-dimethylbenzenediazonium), which is unable to attach to the CF surface, but able to initiate homolytic cleavage of the carbon–iodide bond resulting in attachment.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The introduction of different functionality on the carbon fibre surface largely influenced the measured water contact angle, and the IFSS (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26d</a>). Reduction of the nitro group to a more hydrophilic amine group showed a decrease in WCA, and an increase in IFSS for samples both with and without the perfluoroalkyl chains, compared to the nitro analogues. This is due to the ability of the amine to crosslink to the epoxy network, and the combination of aryl amines bearing hydrophobic groups allows for increased IFSS with a hydrophobic surface. This is the first report of its kind, as interfacial adhesion is usually linked to hydrophilicity and fibre wettability with the epoxy matrix.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Producing a surface with only hydrophobic groups resulted in a very high WCA, and very similar IFSS (18 ± 5 MPa) as the control (18 ± 1 MPa), suggesting there is no loss in composite strength with the introduction of these hydrophobic groups.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> Tensile strength of the carbon fibre was preserved throughout these modifications, though there was a slight increase in Young's modulus.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The use of diazonium salts have proved to be a very effective and reliable method of modifying the CF surface, especially in the fidelity of grafting compounds produced through multistep synthetic pathways.

The goal of this work was to develop a means of carbon fibre surface modification in situations where electrochemical stimuli could not be employed. The properties of the samples produced, including IFSS, tensile strength, and Young's modulus, were evaluated after treatment. The study consisted of submersion of a carbon fibre tow in a solution of diazonium salt then forming the reactive radical species through heating (100 °C, 1 h) or exposure to UV light (1 h). A control of submerged fibre in diazonium solution was produced with no stimuli.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">179</span></sup></a> These samples were compared to electrografting of the diazonium using cyclic voltammetry (−1.0 V to +1.0 V, 0.02 V s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 10 sweeps).</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Electrochemical reduction of the diazonium, unsurprisingly, proved to have the greatest increase in IFSS (54.0 ± 3.7 MPa, compared to control 17.8 ± 1.1 MPa), though heat treatment was similar (44.8 ± 2.5 MPa). The sample exposed to UV light also increased in IFSS (21.8 ± 2.0 MPa), though this was not statistically significant relative to the pristine fibre. Most interestingly, the sample not exposed to any stimuli also saw a slight increase in IFSS (26.4 ± 1.8 MPa), due to random radical formation on the carbon fibre surface. The tensile strength and Young's modulus was preserved (except in the case of the UV treated fibres), and the increase in IFSS was attributed to drag effects of the surface-bound compound through the epoxy matrix suggested by MD simulations of the interface and interphase regions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">179</span></sup></a></p>

        <span>Other reports of the electrochemical reduction of diazonium salts onto the carbon fibre surface incorporate the use of 4-ethynylbenzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate to provide an additional pathway to install further functionality.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a> Employing cyclic voltammetry (−1.0 V to +1.0 V (<span class="italic">vs.</span> Ag/AgCl), 0.02 V s<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 6 sweeps) using a 15 cm tow of carbon fibre as the working electrode, resulted in a surface decorated with alkyne groups. The alkynes serve as facile chemical handles allowing further elaboration of the CF surface in solution using click chemistry (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> CuSO<small><sub>4</sub></small>, ascorbic acid, DMF). The reliable and rapid formation of a triazole through copper catalysed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) allows introduction of a broad range of functional groups under mild conditions, which has seen CuAAC exploited in many areas of chemistry and biology.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit181"><sup><span class="sup_ref">181,182</span></sup></a> In the report outlining this process, the installation of surface chemistries was analysed using conventional XPS and also, more notably, through CuAAC using ferrocene-azide derivative. Following attachment of the ferrocene group, the fibres were analysed by cyclic voltammetry revealing the diagnostic redox couple of ferrocene. Using CuAAC, Servinis and co-workers tethered a range of variable chemistries to the surface of carbon fibres and examined their mechanical properties and interfacial adhesion in an epoxy resin through the SFFT method. The results from this study showed that all modified samples had increased IFSS compared to the pristine fibre (with no treatment at all) (18 ± 1 MPa) including the alkyne-bearing surfaces (30 ± 3 MPa, 67% increase compared to the control). Notably, amine functional groups, that are able to crosslink with the epoxy resin, demonstrate elevated IFSS values compared to compounds that are only able to interact mechanically. This manifests as increased IFSS for the aliphatic amine (53 ± 4 MPa, +192%) and aromatic amine (58 ± 3 MPa, +220%) compared to aryl (39 ± 5 MPa, +116%) and nitro aryl (48 ± 2 MPa, +167%), compared to the control sample.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Interestingly, this study also showed that an aryl amine compound maybe installed on the CF surface through use of 4-azidoaniline·HCl or reached in two steps by reduction of a nitro group. The former method ensures pendant surface modification bears an amine group, whilst the latter relies on further electrochemical reduction to access the aryl amine (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26f</a>). Differences in these two processes can be seen in the IFSS as the reduction of nitro group to amine increases IFSS by 100% (36 ± 1 MPa), as opposed to 220% compared to the control when using the amine-hydrochloride method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Using this triazole forming click-chemistry approach, larger functional groups have been explored to formulate a carbon fibre surface decorated with long PEO groups.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183</span></sup></a> Azide-terminated PEO chains of varying molecular weight (1–10 kDa, <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab3">Table 3</a>) were attached to a carbon fibre surface bearing alkyne groups and the effect on interfacial adhesion evaluated. These chains are highly hydrophilic, which was reflected in the wettability of the carbon fibre surface, and the size of the chains also promoted a high degree of molecular entanglement with the epoxy matrix. This work set out to determine if surface density of grafted compounds or interphase penetration was more influential toward increasing the IFSS.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The largest of the PEO groups (10 kDa) showed the greatest increase in IFSS (46.3 ± 4.4 MPa, compared to control 17.8 ± 1.1 MPa) using the SFFT method. Perhaps contrary to logical progression, the second greatest increase was seen for the 1 kDa sample (41.0 ± 2.3 MPa, +130% increase). MD simulations demonstrated a significant drag effect due to molecular entanglement of the PEO chains with the epoxy matrix. The absence of a clear trend between increased PEO length and improved performance was attributed to the increased penetration of long-chain PEO being offset by lower grafting densities. As the PEO groups became larger, the grafting density of PEO groups decreased due to limited diffusion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183</span></sup></a> Another contributing factor is the exclusion zone created when a large substrate attaches to a surface. The radius of gyration for the ligated polymer decreases the accessibility of adjacent alkyne groups, and they may be blocked by the steric bulk of the larger PEO chains. The conclusion from this work was that both extensive surface coverage and interphase penetration are viable means to dramatically increase fibre–matrix adhesion, but they are typically competing effects (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>).</p>

Generally, surfaces with PEO functionality demonstrated increases in IFSS (single fibre pullout method). This was true for all PEO molecular weights (1 kDa, 2, kDa, 5 kDa and 10 kDa), presumably due to the same mechanism of mechanical entanglement as previously described.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">One interesting finding was the increase in IFSS (microbond method) for the pre-CuAAC fibre, bearing the terminal alkyne, with a vinyl ester resin. The 1 kDa sample returned an IFSS of 21.3 ± 0.9 MPa (compared to control 16.2 ± 0.1 MPa), though this was significantly lower than the IFSS of the alkyne bearing surface (37.4 ± 0.2 MPa). This observation was attributed to the radical curing method of vinyl ester resin and the ability of the exposed alkyne group to participate in this reaction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit184"><sup><span class="sup_ref">184</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">A similarly robust ‘click’ reaction has been shown to impart functionality on the carbon fibre surface, offering an alternative to the copper catalysed click reaction. The sulfur–fluorine exchange (SuFEx) click reaction utilises the sulfone groups bearing a fluorine atom for coupling with silyl ether groups. This reaction takes advantage of the strong affinity of silicon and fluorine bonds, allowing fast reaction times and high fidelity of attached compounds. Randall <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">185</span></sup></a> demonstrated a comparison between traditional CuAAC click chemistry and the SuFEx reaction.

        <p class="otherpara">This study also demonstrated the possibility of using both forms of click reaction sequentially, to construct bespoke surface chemistries. In support of this idea, an azide dervivatised arylsufonyl fluoride group reacted, <span class="italic">via</span> CuAAC, with surface bound alkynes. Then, using SuFEx and a ferrocene-silyl ether derivative, ferrocene was covalently attached to the sulfonyl group, and the presence of the ferrocene was confirmed by cyclic voltammetry. Although the diagnostic redox couple of ferrocene was observed initially, the signal disappeared upon successive potential sweeps. This suggests that the triazole group is electrochemically unstable under the conditions used for the cyclic voltammetry, resulting in the cleavage of ferrocene from the carbon fibre surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">185</span></sup></a></p>

        <p class="otherpara">Following treatment, these carbon fibre samples were imbued with a rich metallic blue colour, which persisted after simple washing, sonication or mild heat, though the colour did temporarily disappear with the application of organic solvent.

        <p class="otherpara">Other notable attributes of these samples was that the treated fibres were stiff and a single tow could be set in complex shapes through the same addition and evaporation of organic solvent.

A broad range of computational techniques allows investigation of structure–property relationships at the molecular level, giving insight into the mechanistic origins of macroscopically observed behaviour previously inaccessible by traditional experimental methods due to time- and length-scale resolution limitations. Regarding carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites, simulation techniques have been used on a variety of size regimes. At an atomic level, first principles quantum chemistry using density functional theory (DFT) calculations allow the modelling of chemical reaction pathways on carbon fibre surfaces (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, oxidation processes and oxygen group stability on graphitic carbon surfaces).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit201"><sup><span class="sup_ref">201–203</span></sup></a> At the macro-scale, finite element analysis (FEA) allows simulations showing stress propagation to inform the design of structural composite components.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit204"><sup><span class="sup_ref">204–207</span></sup></a> In particular, the interaction between the carbon fibre and the polymer matrix has been studied at the nano-scale using molecular modelling, or molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. MD simulations are a computational method in which the classical equations of motion for individual atoms or groups of atoms are propagated in accordance with Newton's equations of motion, subject to forces that describe inter-atomic interactions. Such simulations can complement traditional experimental techniques that characterize the carbon fibre composite interface and help elucidate the molecular-level mechanisms that drive interactions between the fibre and matrix and, ultimately, the mechanical integrity of the fibre-matrix interface.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">At the nano-scale, the CF surface is understood to be a complex, highly graphitic arrangement of mostly sp<small><sup>2</sup></small> carbon atoms. However, the atomic-scale traits and features of the CF surface remain unknown. Typically, the CF substrate is approximated as a few layers of graphene or graphite in the simulation literature. With this picture of the CF-matrix interface in mind, there are many analogous carbon polymer composite systems that are relevant to understanding the CF-matrix interface, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, carbon nanotube-polymer interfaces<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit208"><sup><span class="sup_ref">208–213</span></sup></a> or graphite nanoparticle-polymer composites.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">A vital component of these interface simulation efforts is the structural model of the amorphous polymer network, specifically the polymer located at the interface with the CF surface. The task of capturing the true complexity of these networks in the vicinity of the carbon fibre interface has only become practical <span class="italic">via</span> fully atomistic MD simulations within the last decade or so. Many computational polymerisation strategies have been proposed, most of which can be applied to interfacial simulations in one of two distinct ways: “pre-packed” polymerisation, where the polymer network is crosslinked independently and subsequently interfaced with the substrate, or <span class="italic">in situ</span> crosslinking where the polymer network is crosslinked in the presence of the CF substrate. Of these methods, only the <span class="italic">in situ</span> approach is, in principle, able to capture the influence of the substrate on the polymerisation process, which is currently considered capable of producing a more faithful structural model of the interphase.

        <span>Despite its common use throughout the simulation literature, graphite as a CF model should be regarded as being more representative of an idealized and pristine, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> unsized, CF surface, in contrast to commercially available carbon fibre subjected to the surface treatments outlined above. Regardless of the simplicity of the graphite carbon fibre surface model, simulations of graphite–polymer composite interfaces have been employed in partnership with experiment to elucidate the molecular-level mechanics of the carbon fibre–matrix interface that underpin thermomechanical properties. Aromatic carbon rings are a common feature in many thermoset epoxy resins (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, diglycidylether of bisphenol A) used in structural composite applications. The interaction between aromatic carbon molecules benzene, anthracene, pyrene, and tetracene, and pristine graphene surfaces has been studied using both DFT and semi-empirical density functional tight binding (DFTB) pull-off simulations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit216"><sup><span class="sup_ref">216</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">The authors reported that adhesion energies increased with increasing molecule size, and that the adhesive force required to remove the absorbate aromatic molecule is affected by the pulling method, even for small rigid molecules such as benzene. As expected, the forces required to remove the absorbate molecules was ascribed to non-bonded dispersion interactions. The pristine CF–matrix interface has been extensively investigated and characterized using MD- and multiscale-simulation approaches, for a verity of polymer systems, both thermoset and thermoplastic. In particular, the mechanical response of the interface may be assessed using non-equilibrium pull-out MD simulations, where the CF substrate is pulled-out of the polymer matrix and the change in total system potential energy is monitored. The change in potential energy is directly proportional to the interfacial shear stress (ISS), which forms one part of the total interfacial shear strength (IFSS)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit217"><sup><span class="sup_ref">217</span></sup></a> that can be experimentally measured. The IFSS additionally includes contributions effective over time- and length-scales that are practically inaccessible to atomistic simulations, such as the plastic flow of the matrix and the residual stress within the matrix. Nonetheless, the ISS provides a qualitative proxy for the IFSS, and has been successfully used to recover relative trends in simulation <span class="italic">versus</span> experimental findings.</p>

Similar small molecule functionalisation of CF surfaces was also explored by Sharma and Shukla.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> These authors reported MD simulations of a graphite–carbon nanotube-epoxy composite, using a commercial LY556 (IUPAC name not specified) and DETDA hardener resin, where the carbon nanotubes were surface-functionalized with small amine bearing groups. Mechanical properties predicated <span class="italic">via</span> MD simulation of the composites showed an increase in both transverse and longitudinal Young's modulus for the functionalised nanotube composites, relative to the graphite-epoxy only composites. However, this work did not provide the comparison with a control case (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, unfunctionalized nanotubes). Niuchi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit246"><sup><span class="sup_ref">246</span></sup></a> reported MD simulations of both pristine, fluorine substituted, and fluorinated (–CF<small><sub>3</sub></small> functionalised) graphite substrates interfaced with a coarse grained model of a phenolic resin polymer, where the resin was interfaced with the substrate in the “pre-packed” manner.

These authors reported that even if cross-linking between the surface-grafted molecules and the polymer matrix was suppressed, a substantial increase in ISS still resulted, relative to the un-functionalized interface. However, the crosslink-enabled functionalisation conferred the maximal increase in ISS of the three cases. It is noted that the control un-functionalized case yielded a markedly low ISS for the benchmark comparison. This low value is typical in the simulation literature in general and reflects the highly idealized character of the flat graphite interface in such simulations.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Later reports by Demir <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176</span></sup></a> used a combination of MD simulation and experiment to map correlations between the design of the surface grafted molecules and the effects on the composite ISS. These authors reported MD pull-out simulations for three amine bearing surface grafted molecules: two that contain phenol rings with single <span class="italic">meta</span>- or <span class="italic">para</span>-substituted reactive amine terminated chains, and a third with two reactive amine terminated chains at both <span class="italic">meta</span>-substitution ring sites. The simulations suggested that a single <span class="italic">para</span>-substituted amine terminated chain would extend further into the matrix resulting in a similar ISS than that of molecule bearing two amines, which adopted a less extended conformation. The single <span class="italic">meta</span>-substituted amine group molecule resulted in the lowest mechanical interface performance. A combined MD simulation and experimental approach was reported by Arnold <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit247"><sup><span class="sup_ref">247</span></sup></a> studying the impact of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic surface functionalisation in CF–epoxy composite interfaces. The authors report that both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalisation resulted in increased IFSS, contrary to the common belief that surface polarity of the CF is directly related to the interfacial shear strength of the composite. Here, MD simulations were used to study the four surface grafted molecules considered: one terminated with un-reactive nitro groups, a second terminated with reactive amino groups, and two polyfluorinated alkyl chain molecules, one attached to a phenyl group and the other attached to the surface. The functionalised CF surfaces were then interfaced with an EPON 862-DGEBA epoxy resin as reported in prior simulations. Both the nitro-terminated and the amino-terminated groups were predicted to predominantly adopt upright conformations perpendicular to the CF surface, engaging with the polymer matrix. However, it was noted that a small fraction of amino-terminated molecules adopted a bent conformation, likely due to competing amino–CF interactions. In contrast, in the worst performing surface functionalisation, the majority of the non-reactive fluorinated carbon chains were found in a flattened conformation, reducing engagement with the polymer matrix.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition to the chemistry, the geometry and molecular conformation of surface grafted molecules have also been shown to affect the mechanical performance of the composite interface. Here, MD simulations can provide key insights into the molecular-level processes behind the macroscopically observed results.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">MD simulations reported by Eyckens <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">179</span></sup></a> found that the engagement of the surface grafted molecules with the polymer matrix could lead to a dragging effect during CF pull-out, thereby substantially increasing the ISS despite the lack of chemical reactivity with matrix. This was further investigated in a study reported by Eyckens <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> in which MD simulations of long amphiphilic molecules were covalently attached to the CF surface, and then interfaced with an EPON 862/DETDA epoxy matrix. This report illustrates the power of MD simulations in study of interfaces, as the long chain grafted molecules were predicted to adopt a bent-over or ‘hooked’ conformation at the polymer matrix interphase. These results prompted the synthesis and subsequent modelling of smaller grafted molecular chains which were attached to the CF surface at both ends, resulting in a ‘horseshoe’ like conformation (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig34">Fig. 34</a>). Simulations of both the dangling end, and horseshoe amphiphilic molecules resulted in an increase in ISS of 276%, relative to the bare CF–matrix interface. Experiments of both types of surface grafted molecule recovered similar increases in the measured IFSS of +280%.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Advancements in understanding arising from work reported in the functionalized composite simulation literature over the past few years has been substantial. Despite this, questions still remain regarding how the incorporation of more realistic CF surface models will impact the thermo-mechanical properties of the composite interface. To-date, all functionalisation efforts have considered basal plane functionalisation, however it is known that attachment to planar sp<small><sup>2</sup></small> is energetically less favourable relative to defect sites and edges. Hence, it is not yet understood what effect the edge carbon functionalisation will have on the mechanical response of the CF–matrix interface. Furthermore, the interplay between functionalisation, surface roughness, and varied topology has yet to be explored in the context of both functionalised and un-functionalised CF–matrix interfaces.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect1918"><span class="b_heading">5.4 Sizing-modified interfaces</span></h3>
        <span>The presence of a sizing layer on the CF surface adds considerable complexity in terms of molecular simulation of the CF–matrix interface. The thickness of the sizing layer is typically on the micron scale, which presents challenges of scale for all-atom simulations in tackling a complete description of the entire CF/sizing/matrix. Attempts at all-atom molecular simulations of this double interface have been recently reported.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit248"><sup><span class="sup_ref">248–250</span></sup></a> However, all of these studies have approximated the sizing layer as a thin layer (nanometre or less) of oligomeric chains, which cannot capture much of the relevant phenomena which may control the structure/property relationships of these composite interfaces. For example, the diffusion of matrix precursor into the sizing layer (and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>) cannot be adequately represented with this structural model.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">To address deficiencies in the processes outlined above, multiscale simulations that capture different regions of the interface at different levels of spatial and temporal resolution are ideally suited to address these questions. However, these approaches typically sacrifice molecular level details out of necessity. Notably, Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit251"><sup><span class="sup_ref">251,252</span></sup></a> have previously applied such a multiscale simulation, incorporating mesoscale approaches including coarse-grained simulations and dissipative particle dynamics simulations to the CF/epoxy sizing/epoxy matrix sample. These authors were able to predict some mesoscale phenomena resulting from the interplay between the sizing thickness and degree of diffusion of hardener into the region between the sizing and the matrix.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Despite the impracticality of applying all-atom MD simulations to the entire CF/sizing/matrix interface(s), it would be possible to create all-atom structural models of the zoomed-in region between the sizing and the matrix. This would essentially entail MD simulation of a polymer–polymer interface, in which the matrix could be dynamically cross-linked in the presence of a cured sizing surface (modelled as a bulk polymer slab). Computational curing of epoxy resin in the presence of thermoplastic interfaces has been previously reported,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> and could form the basis of future investigations in this area.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect1929"><span class="a_heading">6 Conclusions and outlook</span></h2>
      <span>There has undoubtedly been a large volume of experimental and theoretical work done on the modification of carbon fibres to promote adhesion, induce functionality, and enhance the compatibility of the fibre surface with the matrix. The mechanical and chemical nature of the interface both play a role at the fibre–matrix interface, though in the authors opinion, the modification of surface chemistry without detrimentally impacting the inherent value of the fibres is likely a route for maximising research impact.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The recent development of various capabilities to chemically control the surface chemistry and therefore interface/interphase of composite with high precision may provide the ability to engineer optimal hard–soft interfaces. There has been an historical desire to implement interphases which mimic those on naturally occurring composites such as bone, wood, nacre, <span class="italic">etc.</span> As these natural materials often possess contradictory properties, such as high strength and high toughness. A significant amount of work has already been conducted in this space but as fabrication techniques and chemical processes continue to advance, so too does the ability to tailor these properties and their functionality.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">There exists conflicting motivation for the improvement of fibre–matrix interactions. The fundamental understanding of how and what chemistries impact the properties of a final composite, how they are balanced and optimised for each resin is an incredibly far-reaching goal that may not be satisfactorily realized even over the next few decades. Contrary to this motivation is the desire to develop novel, scalable, and rapidly deployable surface treatments that can have immediate impact. Thus, immediate deployment of technologies may be misplaced in the long run due to a lack of fundamental understanding about these interactions. These avenues of experimental investigation have, and will continue to be, conducted in parallel with one benefitting from the other, over time giving a more detailed picture of how the best performance and functionality can be designed into composite materials.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">From a molecular modelling perspective, the past two decades has witnessed enormous progress in the capability to computationally describe the structure and properties of fibre–matrix interfaces, with increasing levels of sophistication and detail. At the heart of the molecular simulation approach is a pragmatic balance of rigour and relevance, which requires compromise between how faithfully the system is described in terms of structural models, how accurately the system is described in terms of the inter-atomic (or inter-particle) interactions, and how close to reality the simulation approaches are for determining the interfacial properties (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> strain rate or cooling rate). In the world of computer simulation, none of these can be expected to provide a 100% match with experimental scenarios. That said, simulation outcomes have been most meaningful in this field when comparing trends in predicted properties, rather than absolute values.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Several areas are ripe for development in molecular simulations of the fibre–matrix interface. First, the creation and use of more detailed structural models of the carbon fibre surface is a clear candidate. Past reliance on graphite surfaces has proven enormously useful, but as experimental characterisation breakthroughs continue, there is clear need for consideration of structural models of carbon fibre that can more realistically capture features such as fibre surface roughness, disorder, and the spatial distribution of relevant types of oxygen-bearing groups arising from surface oxidation. Second, great strides have been made in the modelling of surface-attached groups on carbon fibre and their impact on the structure and mechanical properties of the polymer interphase, specifically for epoxy resins. Other types of resin, such as vinyl esters, phenolic resins, and so forth, are relatively under-studied in this context, and much more could be done in this area.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In addition, expansion of molecular simulation approaches to model surface-initiated polymerisation processes such as SEEP are needed to keep pace with experimental developments and provide molecular-scale guidance into the design of these new interfaces, to enable the harmonization of the polymerised fibre matrix with a range of different resin types. Going further, the ability to model the effect of sizing and its impact on interfacial properties is an area where significant challenges remain. Specifically, new multi-scale modelling efforts, namely the ability to effectively couple across multiple length-scales while still retaining the required levels of molecular detail would be welcome developments. Finally, the search for appropriate surface functionalisation strategies that can optimise the desired properties of the fibre–matrix interface is hampered by relatively small datasets compared with massive datasets in other research areas <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the protein structure databank. This limits the ability to apply machine learning approaches for this purpose, and efforts could be taken to compile and strategically augment the fibre–matrix dataset, integrating both experimental data and simulation data. Together, the partnership of experiment and simulation has achieved significant progress, promising a bright future for the rational design of multi-functional carbon fibre reinforced polymer composites.</p>
