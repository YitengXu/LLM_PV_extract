      <h2 id="sect284"><span class="a_heading">1 Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>Electromagnetic radiation is a form of energy with wave character that is emitted or absorbed by charged particles. Electromagnetic radiation has existed in the ambient environment within living memory. Although its source is mainly the sun, all animals, plants and human beings also produce weak electromagnetic fields. However, in the modern age of electricity, various electric appliances, mobile phones, satellites, radio and TV towers, the so-called artificial electromagnetic radiation produced by those mechanisms has started to appear and accumulate in the surroundings. This radiation is often termed as electromagnetic smog, or electromagnetic interference (EMI).</span>
      <p class="otherpara">Electromagnetic radiation waves from these devices can interfere with other electronic appliances, which leads to the lowering of their efficiency, and in some cases even to their malfunction.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2</span></sup></a> These factors can also affect the functions of the human body, mainly when organisms are subjected to their exposure for a longer period of time. The most common symptoms are headaches, irritability, insomnia, fatigue or failure of attention, which may be the reason for more serious illnesses.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3–5</span></sup></a> Therefore, the need electromagnetic radiation shielding has become increasingly pronounced over the last decades, and is a very prospective sphere of research and investigations.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The most common materials for EMI shielding are metals due to their high conductivity. However, their high weight density, low flexibility, propensity to corrosion, heavy processing or manipulation limit the utilization of metals and metal composites in modern devices. To overcome the limitations of metal-based EMI shielding materials, a lot of effort has been paid to the development of polymer materials and composites due to their easy processability, flexibility, low specific weight, chemical and corrosion resistance, or tunable structural and mechanical properties. In addition, in contrast to the reflection dominated EMI shielding of metals, the polymer-based materials exhibit the ability to shield electromagnetic waves primarily through absorption, which has been increasingly preferred in many applications, such as in military or stealth technology. Intrinsically conductive polymers with delocalized π-conjugated electronic structure demonstrate unusual electronic properties, such as low ionization potential, high electron affinity and conductivity, which can be significantly enhanced by chemical or filler doping.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> The generally used polymers are typical electrical insulators. Therefore, they are not able to provide shielding effects. However, the introduction of suitable fillers results in the preparation of polymer composites with unique electromagnetic properties. The application of a suitable filler or filler combinations can not only provide the opportunity to tune the physical–mechanical properties of the polymer composites, but also provide the possibility to adjust the permittivity, permeability, thermal and electrical conductivity, or thickness to obtain improved EMI performance. Thus, the polymer composites have become versatile materials with tunable mechanical, dynamic, optic and electromagnetic properties, which helps to expand their application field. The polymers and polymer composites demonstrate great promise as light weight, thermally stable, mechanically strong, ultra-efficient EMI shielding materials in advanced application fields, such as in electronics, radars, flexible portable and wearable electronic devices, aircraft, defense, aerospace applications, military applications or stealth technology.</p>
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect293"><span class="a_heading">2 Mechanisms of EMI shielding</span></h2>
      <span>Three mechanisms contribute to the overall effectiveness of electromagnetic radiation or electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, namely absorption, reflection and multiple reflection.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7–9</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">The primary mechanism of EMI shielding is usually reflection. The principle is based on the simple reflection of EM radiation from the surface of the shielding material. The material that is able to reflect EMI must be a carrier of free electric charges (electrons or holes), which interact with the electromagnetic field in the radiation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> The shielding material must therefore be conductive, although high conductivity is specifically not required (a volume resistivity of around 1 Ω cm is typically sufficient). There is also no requirement to reach the percolation threshold or the connectivity of conductive fillers incorporated into dielectric matrices in order to provide good reflection efficiency. However, increasing the amount of conductive filler paths in composites leads to the significant increase in the shielding effectiveness. Typically, the materials that have good efficiency to shield EMI by reflection are various metals (copper, nickel, aluminum, silver, gold, <span class="italic">etc.</span>); this is due to the high amount of free electrons that are able to conduct electric current.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11–13</span></sup></a> Composites containing conductive fillers as metal powders or carbon fibers, and materials that have been surface-treated with conductive layers and coatings are the next examples of materials that provide good shielding efficiency by reflection. In general, it can be stated that over 103 Hz, the efficiency of reflection is improved with increasing shield conductivity, and deteriorates with increasing shield permeability and frequency of electromagnetic radiation.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Absorption is a secondary mechanism of EMI shielding, and depends on the thickness of the shielding material. The efficiency of shielding by absorption increases with the presence of electric and/or magnetic dipoles in the shield that are able to interact with the EM radiation.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7,14</span></sup></a> The sources of the electric dipoles are mainly materials with high values of dielectric constant (permittivity), for instance, BaTiO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, and ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Magnetic dipoles have materials with high permeability. Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>, ferrites, super permalloy and mumetal (alloy of iron and nickel) belong to the excellent absorption materials due to their high values of permeability.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15–18</span></sup></a> The efficiency of absorption increases with increasing frequency of EM radiation, with increasing thickness and permeability of the shielding material. In the absence of magnetic properties, EMI shielding is dependent exclusively on the dielectric properties and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">In addition to the reflection and absorption, the third mechanism of EMI shielding is multiple reflection, which refers to the reflection of EM radiation from various surfaces, phase interfaces and in-homogeneities in the shield.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> Materials with good multiple reflection ability exhibit high specific surface area (foam or porous materials) or a large phase interface (composites containing fillers with high specific surface areas).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14,21</span></sup></a> The amplitude of the incident radiation is attenuated by multiple internal reflections within the shielding material.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Electromagnetic radiation at high frequencies can only penetrate to the near surface regions of the electric conductors. This is known as the skin effect.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22,23</span></sup></a> The strength of the electromagnetic incident wave declines exponentially when passing through the conductor. The depth at which the electric field drops to 1/<span class="italic">e</span> (<span class="italic">e</span> is Euler's number and 1/<span class="italic">e</span> = 0.37) of the incident value is called the skin depth (<span class="italic">δ</span>):<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn1"/><a href="/image/article/2021/NA/d0na00760a/d0na00760a-t1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: d0na00760a-t1.tif" src="/image/article/2021/NA/d0na00760a/d0na00760a-t1.gif"/></a></td><td class="rightEqn">(1)</td></tr></table>where: <span class="italic">f</span> – frequency of electromagnetic radiation, <span class="italic">σ</span> – shield electric conductivity (Ω<small><sup>−1</sup></small> m<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) a <span class="italic">μ</span> – shield magnetic permeability, <span class="italic">μ</span> = <span class="italic">μ</span><small><sub>o</sub></small><span class="italic">μ</span><small><sub>r</sub></small>, where <span class="italic">μ</span><small><sub>r</sub></small> = shield relative magnetic permeability, and <span class="italic">μ</span><small><sub>o</sub></small> – permeability of air or free space (<span class="italic">μ</span><small><sub>o</sub></small> = 4π × 10<small><sup>−7</sup></small> H m<small><sup>−1</sup></small>). It becomes evident that the skin depth decreases with the increase in the EM wave frequency, magnetic permeability and conductivity of the shield. Owing to the skin effect, composites containing conductive fillers with a small unit dimension are more effective for shielding when compared to the fillers with a large unit size. It has been reported that the unit size of the filler should be less or comparable to the skin depth.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> Thus, the filler with a unit size of 1 μm or less is typically preferred. However, the dispersion and distribution of small fillers in polymer matrices are often very difficult. They also tend to agglomerate, leading to dispersive non-homogeneity, which may have negative effects not only on the processability and physical–mechanical properties of composite materials, but also on their shielding performance.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Following the transmission line theory and plane-wave theory, the shielding mechanism of the EMI shield can be inferred with respect to the skin depth and thickness as:</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(a) When the thickness of the EMI shield is much lower than the skin depth (<span class="italic">t</span> ≪ <span class="italic">δ</span>), the attenuation occurs solely by reflection. This condition takes place either at low frequencies, or in the case of thin material with good electrical conductivity. Under these conditions, the total shielding phenomenon is independent of frequency.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">(b) When the thickness of the EMI shield is much larger than the skin depth (<span class="italic">t</span> ≫ <span class="italic">δ</span>), the attenuation occurs by reflection, absorption and multiple internal sub-phenomenon for good conductors, whose <span class="italic">σ</span>/<span class="italic">ωε</span> ≫ 1. In this case, the total shielding phenomenon is dependent on frequency. This condition is fulfilled either at high frequencies, or in the case of an electrically conductive thick sample.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">The electromagnetic radiation can be imagined as a self-propagating transverse oscillating wave. From <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>, it becomes evident that the electromagnetic wave consists of two essential elements, a magnetic field (<span class="italic">H</span>) and an electric field (<span class="italic">E</span>). These two fields are perpendicular to each other, and the direction of the wave propagation is at a right angle to the plane containing the two components. The relative magnitude depends on the waveform and its source. The ratio of the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields is called wave impedance <span class="italic">Z</span> (|<span class="italic">E</span>|/|<span class="italic">H</span>|). The wave impedance decreases with increasing distance from the source. The magnetic field and the electric field both decrease in amplitude by 20 dB if the distance is increased by ten times. In a certain distance from the source, the transmitted wave is changed into a plane wave with a constant value of impedance <span class="italic">Z</span><small><sub>0</sub></small> = 377 Ω (impedance of free space).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> The region with a constant value of wave impedance is the far-field shielding region (radiation field or Fraunhofer zone) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> In the far-field shielding region, the distance between the radiation source and the shield is higher than <span class="italic">λ</span>/2π (where <span class="italic">λ</span> is the free-space wavelength of the radiation). The electromagnetic plane wave theory is generally applied for the EMI shielding in this region. When the distance between the source and the shield is lower than <span class="italic">λ</span>/2π, it is the near-field shielding. The theory based on the contribution of the electric and magnetic dipoles is then used for EMI shielding.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> In the near-field region (reactive field or Fresnel zone), (|<span class="italic">E</span>|/|<span class="italic">H</span>|) is not constant and the shielding effectiveness must be observed separately for the magnetic field and electric field. The ratio between the fields depends on the distance from the radiation source. For high current low voltage sources, the near-field is mainly magnetic. However, for low current high voltage sources, the electric field dominates.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> The magnetic field controls the near-field when the source has low impedance. On the other hand, the electric field takes over when the source has high impedance. Between the near-field and far-field regions, there exists a transition region, in which the distance between the radiation source and the shield is roughly equal to <span class="italic">λ</span>/2π (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> Electromagnetic waves are categorized based on the frequency as radio waves, microwaves, visible light, ultraviolet waves, X-rays, and gamma rays.

The amplitude of both waves depends on the individual impedances of the shield and ambient environment. The strength of the penetrated wave is lowered and weakened due to its absorption by the shield. The absorbed energy is subsequently dissipated in the form of heat. As the attenuated electromagnetic wave reaches the second surface of the shield, a portion of the radiation passes through the shield, while the second portion is reflected back to the shield. If the shield is thicker than the skin depth, the wave reflected from the internal surface is absorbed by the shield, and the multiple reflection does not take place, or the loss due to it can be neglected.

      <p class="otherpara">Based upon the outlined formulations, it can be stated that the efficiency of shielding by absorption is a function of <span class="italic">σμ</span>, whereas shielding by reflection is dependent on the ratio of both parameters <span class="italic">σ</span>/<span class="italic">μ</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14,31,41,42</span></sup></a></p>

By contrast, magnetic materials with permeability <span class="italic">μ</span> &gt; 1 significantly reduced the shielding by reflection, and their dominant shielding mechanism becomes absorption. The efficiency of reflection decreases with increasing frequency equivalent to −10 dB per decade of frequency. For example, the shielding efficiency of conductive material from copper at 1 kHz is 138 dB. Nevertheless, with increasing frequency up to 10 MHz, the shielding efficiency falls down to 98 dB. On the other hand, the efficiency of shielding by absorption increases with increasing frequency according to the graphical dependence √<span class="italic">f</span> on the decibel scale. However, the situation is different for composite materials with heterogeneous structures, in which the polarization of the matrix, conductive filler and interfacial polarization can occur depending on the frequency range.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44–46</span></sup></a> These polarization sites lead to the formation of local fields, and lag of the displacement current relative to the conduction current.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit47"><sup><span class="sup_ref">47,48</span></sup></a> Fillers and matrices exhibit different electromagnetic properties.

Parameter <span class="italic">ε</span>′ (real permittivity or dielectric constant) represents the electric charge storage capacity, whereas <span class="italic">ε</span>′′ (imaginary permittivity) indicates the dielectric dissipation or losses. Similarly, <span class="italic">μ</span>′ and <span class="italic">μ</span>′′ represent the magnetic storage and losses, respectively. The extent of losses can be calculated from the tangent of the dielectric loss (tan<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/><span class="italic">δ</span><small><sub>E</sub></small> = <span class="italic">ε</span>′′/<span class="italic">ε</span>′) and magnetic loss (tan<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/><span class="italic">δ</span><small><sub>M</sub></small> = <span class="italic">μ</span>′′/<span class="italic">μ</span>′).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49,50</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">The permittivity and permeability have been reported to be crucial parameters that influence the EMI shielding efficiency. The complex permittivity constitutes the real component <span class="italic">ε</span>′ and imaginary component <span class="italic">ε</span>′′. The real permittivity of the filled composites is a measure of the amount of micro-capacitors and polarization centers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45</span></sup></a> It is related to the displacement current and mainly affected by the polarization (localized charges) inside the material, and is correlated with the electrical charge storage within the composite. Imaginary permittivity, which is related to the dissipation of the electrical energy (dielectric loss), is mainly affected by ionic, orientational (dipole orientation), electronic and interfacial polarization. The ionic and orientational polarization is attributed to the bound charges in the material. The interfacial polarization originates from space charges, which accumulate owing to the dissimilarity in the electrical conductivity/dielectric constant at the interface of the two different materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51</span></sup></a> The enhanced dielectric permittivity of the composites can increase the dielectric loss contribution due to the difference in conductivity between the non-conductive polymer matrix and conductive filler. Due to this electrical conductivity mismatch between the matrix and the filler, composite materials may have polarization and charge accumulation at their interfaces. Thus, polymer composites with high dielectric values might act as good absorbers of electromagnetic radiation. In nanocomposites, conductive nanofiller networks act as dissipating mobile charge carriers. The increase in the number of conductive networks, as a result of increasing filler content, can lead to higher imaginary permittivity and finally to higher EMI dissipation by absorption.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52–54</span></sup></a> Following the free electron theory, the imaginary permittivity or dielectric loss is given by <span class="italic">ε</span>′′ = <span class="italic">σ</span>/2π<span class="italic">ε</span><small><sub>0</sub></small><span class="italic">f</span>, which indicates that the increasing conductivity shifts to the increase in imaginary permittivity. By contrast, the dielectric loss decreases with increasing frequency. The frequency-dependent dielectric response can be explained by the presence of electric dipoles. When the frequency of the applied field increases, the dipoles present in the system are not able to reorient themselves fast enough to respond to the applied electric field, which results in a decrease of the dielectric loss.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> The ionic and electronic polarization play a role only at very high frequencies (above 1000 GHz). Thus, their effects can be ignored in low microwave frequency region. Dipole polarization is led mainly by the presence of defects, voids and residual groups in the material, and it is influenced mainly by the production process, material types, and annealing temperature. The polarization ability of the composites can also be improved by the orientation and type of fillers in the matrix.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48,56</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another important parameter is the material permeability. Materials with high permeability or magnetic loss have been reported to be good materials for shielding by absorption. The permeability of some materials changes with the change in intensity, temperature, and frequency of the applied magnetic field. The overall EMI SE also depends on the radiation frequency. It has been shown that the absorption shielding ability increases with the increase in radiation frequency. The magnetic loss results from hysteresis loss, domain wall loss, eddy current loss and residual loss. The hysteresis loss originates from the hysteresis (time delay of the magnetization vector <span class="italic">M</span> behind the magnetic field vector <span class="italic">H</span>), where the magnetic energy is dissipated in the form of heat.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit57"><sup><span class="sup_ref">57</span></sup></a> The eddy current loss can be neglected for highly conductive materials, and remains constant with the change in frequency. The magnetic loss also comes from the natural resonance and exchange resonance. The natural resonance usually takes place at lower frequencies, and nano-sized particles enhance the exchange resonance. Magnetic metals and their alloys (Fe, FeCo, FeNi) exhibit high saturation magnetization and good permeability. However, their conductive behavior generates eddy current losses, which results in reduced permeability at lower frequencies (typically in MHz range). On the other hand, ferrites rank among semi-conductive materials and have much lower saturation magnetization. Thus, natural ferromagnetic resonance takes place at the low GHz range. The above outlined aspects limit their utilization in the high GHz range to the maximum bulk ferromagnetic materials. To overcome the problem, research studies have been focused on nano- and micro-sized materials because the low-dimension materials mitigate eddy current loss. It can also be stated that the highly effective magnetic fields favor higher EMI absorption in the higher frequency range.

      <p class="otherpara">Generally, in addition to the thickness of the shielding material, several other factors influence the overall EMI SE, including the electrical conductivity, permeability, permittivity, content, size, shape, aspect ratio and morphology of the filler/fillers applied. Among them, the electrical conductivity is one of the key parameters for effective shielding materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit59"><sup><span class="sup_ref">59</span></sup></a> In general, the electrical conductivity of composites increases with increasing amount of conductive filler incorporated in the polymer matrix. With increasing content of the filler, an interconnected filler network within the polymer matrix is formed, resulting in the sharp increase of the electrical conductivity. Thus, the content and the shape of the filler are the most important factors that influence the conductivity of composites. In contrast to spherical-type fillers, inclusions with fibrillar or tubular shape with a high aspect ratio can more easily connect together when dispersed within the polymer matrix at higher concentrations, forming a spatial filler network structure, leading to a significant increase of the conductivity. The geometric characteristics and the structure of the filler, such as the particle size, specific surface area, aggregating or agglomerating tendency also play important roles in the conductive network formation and overall EMI SE performance. The specific surface area and thus the aggregation tendency of the filler both increase with decreasing particle size. High structure fillers, for example carbon black, can more easily form a conductive filler network within the polymer matrices. Arjmand and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60</span></sup></a> synthetized silver nanowires (AgNW) by electrodeposition technique, and incorporated them into a polystyrene (PS) matrix through the solution-processing approach. Polystyrene/multiwalled carbon nanotube (PS/MWCNT) composites were fabricated following the same procedure for comparison. It was shown that AgNW developed into chain nanospheres by the fragmentation phenomenon at molding temperature (240 °C). The results demonstrated that at low filler loading, the electrical conductivity of PS/AgNW was inferior compared to that of the PS/MWCNT composites. This can be attributed to the higher particle size of AgNW (10 nm diameter for MWCNT, 25 nm diameter for AgNW), and thus a lower specific surface area, lower aspect ratio, fragmentation phenomenon and inferior conducting network of AgNW. On the other hand, at high filler loading, the intrinsic conductivity of AgNW overcame the lower aspect ratio and worse conducting network. This resulted in the better electrical characteristics of the PS/AgNW composites. The results also demonstrated a very close correlation between the conductive network formation and EMI shielding performance. Ram <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> investigated the influence of three different nano-carbon based fillers, namely carbon black, types N472, N550 and N774 on the electrical conductivity and EMI SE of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) based polymer composites. All three types of carbon black exhibited different particle size and structure, and thus also different aggregating tendency. The results revealed that the electrical conductivity of the composites increased as following: PVDF/N774 &lt; PVDF/N550 &lt; PVDF/N472. The different behavior can be attributed to the different particle size and structure of the tested fillers. Finally, the authors stated that carbon black type N472 with the smallest particle size, the highest specific surface area and the highest structure imparted the highest electrical conductivity and the highest overall EMI SE to the corresponding composites. In addition to the filler size and morphology, the filler synthesis conditions can also affect the electrical properties of the composite materials. For example, in the study performed by Arjmand <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> it was demonstrated that the synthesis catalyst Co, Fe and Ni strongly influenced the electrical properties and crystalline structure of the nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNT) by chemical vapor deposition method. The synthesized N-CNT were subsequently melt compounded with the PVDF matrix. The application of Ni and Fe resulted in the formation of N-CNT with bamboo-like configurations, whereas N-CNT fabricated by application of Co was open-channel. The filler aspect ratio was the highest by using the Co catalyst, followed by Ni and Fe. On the other hand, the introduction of the Ni catalyst resulted in the highest nitrogen content for N-CNT. The electrical conductivity and EMI SE of the N-CNT composites prepared by application of different catalysts increased in the order: Co &gt; Fe &gt; Ni. The higher EMI shielding performance of the N-CNT nanocomposites fabricated by the Co-catalyst was attributed to the combination of the high synthesis yield, high crystallinity of N-CNT, high aspect ratio of the filler, low structural defects, low nitrogen content, as well as good filler dispersion state in the composite. It was also clearly revealed that the high aspect ratio along with the good filler dispersion state resulted in a low percolation threshold and improved conducting network formation. This was subsequently reflected in the higher shielding efficiency of the nanocomposites.</p>

      <span>Experimental instruments called network analyzers are introduced for the evaluation of EMI SE. Two types of network analyzers, which operate on the principle of the waveguide technique, can be applied: a scalar network analyzer (SNA) and vector network analyzer (VNA). The scalar network analyzer (SNA) determines the amplitude of signals, while the network analyzer VNA detects the signal magnitude response, as well as phases of various signals. As SNA cannot be used for the determination of complex signals (complex permeability or permittivity), VNA is the more preferred instrument, despite its higher price.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit59"><sup><span class="sup_ref">59</span></sup></a> VNA containing two ports emits electromagnetic radiation in the examined frequency range from both ports and records the reflected radiation, as well as the transmitted radiation obtained from the tested shielding material (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a>). According to the EMI shielding theory, when the electromagnetic propagating wave reaches the surface of the shielding material, the incident power is divided into the reflected, absorbed and transmitted power, and the corresponding power coefficients of absorbance (<span class="italic">A</span>), reflectance (<span class="italic">R</span>), and transmittance (<span class="italic">T</span>).

        <h3 id="sect769"><span class="b_heading">5.1 Intrinsically conductive polymers (ICP)</span></h3>
        <span>Despite the fact that polymers are generally considered to be an electrical insulator, there are some polymers with increased conductivity in the doped states. In general, ICP possesses alternating single (<span class="italic">σ</span>) and double (π) bonds, and these conjugated systems with the presence of π-electrons lend the ICP their inherent optical, electrochemical, and electrical/electronic properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit70"><sup><span class="sup_ref">70</span></sup></a> The π-electrons in the conjugated backbone are available to delocalize into a conduction band. In the idealized situation of a uniform chain, the resulting conduction band would give rise to metallic behavior. However, this system is unstable with respect to the bond alteration, which causes the formation of an energy gap in the electronic spectrum. Dopant ions are incorporated into the structure to overcome the energy gap, and thus to impart conductivity to those polymers. Conductive polymers have been doped using different methods in order to achieve high conductivities. Dopants in the polymers undergo redox processes, in which the charges are transferred with the subsequent formation of charge carriers. The role of the dopant is not only to withdraw electrons from polymer chains, but also to add electrons to the polymer backbone. These oxidation/reduction processes create charge carriers in the form of polarons (radical ions), bipolarons (dications or dianions), or solitons in the polymer. The ability to control their electrical conductivity by adjusting parameters, such as the oxidation state, doping level, dopant ion size, protonation level, morphology and chemical structure makes them suitable candidates for EMI shielding in various technological applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit71"><sup><span class="sup_ref">71</span></sup></a> The shielding efficiency of intrinsically conductive polymers arises from mobile charges (polarons, bipolarons, solitons) and bound charges (dipoles) at their backbone.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24,72,73</span></sup></a> When compared to solid metals, ICP exhibits low density, ease of processing and preparation conditions, easy-to-control shape and morphology, corrosion resistance, structural flexibility, and tunable electrical conductivity. For instance, iodine-doped polyacetylene shows an electrical conductivity of around 1.7 × 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> S cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, which is comparable to some metals.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit60"><sup><span class="sup_ref">60</span></sup></a> On the other hand, as with many other polymers, they undergo thermo-oxidative aging and other forms of degradation. However, due to the low hydrogen content and aromatic structure, their thermal, chemical and thermo-oxidative stability are very high. They also suffer from swelling in some solvents, cracking or contraction, which may have a negative impact on their electrical and mechanical properties. Those properties can be enhanced by the addition of a second phase, mainly in the form of fillers, such as metallic or magnetic particles, metal oxides or various carbon-based fillers. Those fillers can improve their mechanical properties (mostly carbon based fillers), thermal stability, dielectric or magnetic properties and electrical conductivity, and thus improve their overall shielding efficiency. A lot of nanocomposites containing carbon-based fillers, such as carbon nanotubes, graphene, carbon nanofibers or carbon nanotubes, have been prepared and examined.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit74"><sup><span class="sup_ref">74–76</span></sup></a> These carbon fillers improved the structural ordering of the polymer chains and facilitated the delocalization of the charge carriers, resulting in enhanced conductivity.

These materials are marked so-called “intelligent stealth materials”, because they exhibit the reversible electrical properties of conducting polymers, which are influenced by redox doping/de-doping processes. Intrinsically conductive polymers mainly include polyaniline (PANI), polypyrrole (PPy), polythiophene (PTH), polyfuran (PF), polyacetylene (PA), polyparaphenylene (PPP), poly(<span class="italic">p</span>-phenylene vinylene) (PPV), and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT). They have been successfully used in many applications, such as chemical sensors, electro-magnetic shielding, electrically conducting fibers, corrosion inhibitors, antistatic coatings and in “smart” windows that can regulate the amount of light passing through them. Some of the most exciting potential utilizations of these materials include compact electronic devices, such as polymer-based transistors, lasers and light-emitting diodes. These electronic devices can find novel applications in the electronic industry, for example in flat flexible television screens or as acceptors in polymeric solar cells.

The incorporation of fillers results in the modification of processing characteristics, physical–mechanical properties, and in the manipulation of electric and electromagnetic properties. On the other hand, the high level of filler loading can be detrimental for the processability, density, surface quality and physical–mechanical properties of composites.

        <h3 id="sect935"><span class="b_heading">5.3 Conductive polymer composites</span></h3>
        <span>With the exclusion of ICP, the majority of polymers exhibit zero or only a minimal intrinsic conductivity. In general, it can be said that polymer matrices are typical electric insulators, thus they are not able to provide shielding effects. However, when they are filled with suitable materials (mainly different types of fillers in the form of particles, fibers, flakes, ribbons, platelets, sheet or tubes), such composites take part in significant status among materials able to provide protection against EMI. Despite the fact that polymer matrices are electric insulators and do not contribute to shielding, they can influence the dispersion and distribution of fillers, and the formation of a filler network structure within the polymer matrices, and thus they enhance the shielding efficiency. Non-conductive polymers containing conductive fillers, known also as extrinsic conductive polymer composites, have been deeply investigated as potential materials for EMI shielding applications due to their lightweight property, stability, flexibility, extensive absorption, corrosion resistance, and ease of processing. They can be bent, shaped, or coiled without the loss of their electromagnetic properties. Moreover, due to the appropriate electrical and dielectric characteristics, they are able to avert electrostatic discharge, disturbance and interference between the electronic systems. Having the outlined advantages, extrinsic conductive polymer composites have been used in practical applications in the sphere of automobiles, aircraft, aerospace, civil engineering, or commonly used electronic devices. The versatility and easy adaptability to the requirements of different technological applications have ranked the conductive polymer composites among perspective alternatives to metal enclosures used in power electronics, communication systems, generators and electric motors. The easy processing, in line with the good tensile characteristics, and design flexibility provide benefits over traditional materials that are limited by intensive time and labor processes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit119"><sup><span class="sup_ref">119</span></sup></a> Different fillers have been introduced into polymer matrices in order to prepare efficient EMI shielding polymer composites, such as metals, metal oxides, ferrites and other inorganic fillers, as well as various types of carbon-based structures, such as carbon black, carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, graphite, or various forms of graphene. In polymer composites, the two major constituents are the matrix phase and the reinforcement filler phase. However, the interfacial region between the matrix and the filler forms the third material constituent, which significantly affects the macroscopic characteristics of the composite materials. In the interfacial region, composites exhibit substantially different properties when compared to complex composite structures.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit59"><sup><span class="sup_ref">59,68</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">When conductive or semi-conductive fillers are distributed within the insulating polymer matrix, they act as “micro-capacitors”, enhancing their ability to store the electric energy. This affects the electrical properties of the composites according to the degree of filling and distance between the applied filler particles. When particles are not in contact, the conductivity of the composites only slightly changes, although the dielectric properties may change significantly. However, when the conductive fillers are close to each other, electrons can jump the gap between particles with the formation of a current flow.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> When the content of the conductive fillers in the polymer matrix reaches a critical concentration, an interconnected network of the filler particles is made up. This transition is known as the percolation transition, and the critical concentration of the conductive fillers at the percolation transition is termed as the percolation threshold.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38</span></sup></a> At the percolation threshold, a continuous electric current pathway is established. Above this concentration, the electrical conductivity of polymer composites increases significantly. In addition to the filler content, the percolation threshold is dependent on the geometrical factors of the filler, including the size, shape, morphology, orientation, aspect ratio, as well as the electrical conductivity of the filler. The influence of these factors on the electrical conductivity of the polymer composites is described in more detail in Section 2. Moreover, the percolation transition depends also on the dispersion, distribution of the filler within the polymer matrix, mutual adhesion and compatibility between the filler and the matrix, and the processing method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48</span></sup></a> In general, as the dispersion state of the filler within the polymer matrix and the mutal adhesion between the filler and polymer increases, the percolation threshold decreases. It can also be stated that the high structure fillers (as for instance, high structure carbon black) can form an interconnected filler network at lower concentrations when compared to traditional spherical-type fillers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The general dependence of the conductivity of polymer composites on the conductive filler content with respect to the aspect ratio is displayed in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig9">Fig. 9</a>. In general, for conventional roughly spherical-shaped fillers with random distribution, around 10–20% has to be added into the polymer matrices in order to reach the percolation threshold. With increasing aspect ratio (length-to-width ratio) of the particles, the concentration decreases for the percolation threshold to be achieved. In polymer composites with conductive fillers below the percolation threshold, the influence of the frequency on their dielectric constant and dielectric loss factor in the tested frequency range is fairly limited, and their values increase with the increase in filler loading. On the other hand, the values of these parameters are frequency-dependent above the percolation threshold.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a> There are two theories or theoretical models that describe the conductive mechanism of the composites. The first one is the conductive channel theory, and the second one is the tunnel effect theory. The conductive channel mechanism can be applied at high filler content (above percolation threshold) when the particles in contact form conductive channels, and the charge carriers can freely migrate within the system. The tunnel effect theory plays a role at low filler content when the polymer matrix surrounds the filler particles, and thus there is certain spacing between the conductive particles. Electrons in the thermal vibration are under the action of migration with the formation of a conductive network.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a></p>

        <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, it must be taken into account that increasing the amount of filler can have detrimental effects on the processing characteristics, viscosity, thermo-oxidative stability and physical–mechanical properties of the composites, such as the tensile strength, tear strength, flexibility or dynamic characteristics, and heaviness. This is mainly the case of the inorganic metal fillers, metal oxides or ferrites, which are usually heavyweight and have been proved to be mostly inactive fillers from the point of the physical–mechanical properties when incorporated into the polymer matrices. Moreover, fillers based on transition metals and metal oxides (especially iron, copper, manganese) have been proved to be polymer poisoning, lowering the thermo-oxidative stability of polymer composites. On the other hand, carbon-based fillers impart not only good EMI shielding characteristics to the polymer composites, but also contribute to the improved physical–mechanical properties, like high tensile strength and moduli. Among them, carbon black is a cost-affordable and widely used reinforcing filler, mainly in rubber technology. Outlining these facts, not only the conductivity, dielectric or electromagnetic characteristics of fillers, but also their physical and structural characteristics affecting the physical–mechanical properties and stability of composites must be considered when formulating and designing the polymer composites for particular EMI shielding applications.</p>

          <span id="sect953"/><span class="c_heading_indent">5.3.1 Metallic fillers. </span>
          <span>Metals belong to the oldest materials used for electromagnetic interference shielding. Due to their excellent conductivity, they seem to be ideal materials for EMI shielding. However, the main mechanism of their shielding efficiency is based on the reflection of EM radiation. In many cases, the shielding by reflection is undesirable due to the secondary interference of the reflected EM waves with the initial radiation emitted from other electronic sources, causing a secondary electromagnetic radiation effect. Formerly, metals were used mainly in the form of sheets, which is impractical due to their heavy mass and complicated manipulation. Metal shields are also susceptible to corrosion, leading to the nonlinearity and decrease in the shielding effectiveness. Metals are also rigid, expensive and difficult to process in addition to their high production cost. Nowadays, lightweight aluminum sheets are partially applied, but metals are often used in the form of thin layers deposited on a suitable surface, then in the form of powdery fillers, fibers and alloys in composites with different types of matrices. They are also used in combination with other shielding materials as carbon fibers, carbon nanotubes, graphite or graphene. Metal-based shielding materials show the highest efficiency at lower frequencies of electromagnetic radiation, at which the effect of the reflection shielding is the most pronounced. With increasing frequency, the shielding effectiveness of the metal shields decreases. The experimental works revealed that the EMI SE of metals and metal materials in the frequency region between 0.1 GHz and 1.5 GHz ranges from −30 dB up to −60 dB depending on the applied form (sheet, fiber, powdery filler) and on the degree of filling. The most common metals used as EMI shields are copper, cobalt, nickel or iron. The others include aluminium, brass, silver, steel and tin. The electrical conductivity of some metals is shown in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. Copper provides the highest shielding efficiency, as it is the best electrical conductor. However, it also exhibits the highest proportion of reflection shielding. On the other hand, iron shows the lowest shielding efficiency, but its adsorption mechanism was found to be dominant. Jalali <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122"><sup><span class="sup_ref">122</span></sup></a> investigated the influence of cobalt, nickel, iron and iron oxide (Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>) as nanoparticle fillers in epoxy thermosetting resin on the shielding effectiveness of the prepared composites over the X-band frequency range (8.2–12.4 GHz). When comparing the tested materials, composites filled with iron particles showed the most stable and predictable shielding and absorption behavior. Nickel, cobalt and iron oxide showed lower absorption shielding efficiency, but also lower reflection shielding. Composites filled with iron oxide exhibited the lowest reflection of the EM waves (∼5%), which can be attributed to the low conductivity of iron oxide (six magnitudes smaller than iron). Then, the authors tested the influence of the particle size of iron and nickel on EMI SE. It was found out that iron nanoparticles with the smallest diameter (25 nm) exhibited the highest adsorption ability from all analyzed materials. Though, again, they showed the highest reflection of the electromagnetic field power. The iron particles with diameters of 50 nm provided the lowest reflection loss, while still showing higher absorption loss than particles of 75 nm. The incorporation of iron nanoparticles into carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites led to the increase of the total EMI SE up to 15 dB, implying a rise from 30 dB without iron nanofiller up to 45 dB with inclusion, in the considered 8.4–12.4 GHz frequency range. The improvement was moreover formed through a decrease of reflection and increase of adsorption shielding. Wu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123</span></sup></a> studied the influence of the iron particle size in epoxy resin on the adsorption shielding efficiency of the prepared composites. Their research revealed that adsorption shielding significantly increased with a decrease in the particle size. The size of the particles also had considerable influence on the shielding efficiency of the tested materials – the smaller were the particles, the higher was the overall EMI SE. Highly conductive copper nanowire (CuNW)/polystyrene (PS) composites were investigated in the work.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> The percolation threshold of the composites was reached only at 0.24 vol% of CuNW. The analysis of the shielding effectiveness within the X-band frequency range showed that the composite film with thickness of 210 μm containing 1.3 vol% of CuNW exhibited an EMI SE value of 27 dB. When the content of the copper nanowire in PS was 2.1 vol%, the shielding efficiency increased up to 35 dB. The contribution of the absorption of both types of composites to the overall EMI SE was about 54%. Jiao and his coworkers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> presented an easily-operated and scalable method, which included pyrolysis and magnetron sputtering, to fabricate core–shell structured composite comprising nano-copper (nCu) and cotton-derived carbon fibers (CDCF). Outstanding hydrophobicity and excellent antibacterial activity were achieved for the composite material owing to the composition conversion from cellulose to carbon, nano-size effect and strong oxidizing ability of the oxygen-reactive radical sites from the interactions of nCu with the sulfhydryl groups in the enzymes. In addition, the core–shell composite showing strong electrical conductivity induced the conduction loss and interfacial polarization loss, which resulted in a high absorption-dominated EMI SE of 29.3 dB within the X-band frequency range. Yu <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit126"><sup><span class="sup_ref">126</span></sup></a> prepared high electrical conductive films by the blending of silver nanowires (AgNW) and silver nanoparticles (AgNP) with hydrophobic and hydrophilic resins. The silver content in the tested films filled with AgNW could be significantly reduced due to the high aspect ratio of the silver nanowires. The overall EMI SE of the composites increased with increasing content of silver. When the shielding efficiency was under −20 dB (&gt;99%) in the tested frequency range of 3–17 GHz, the AgNW-filled film exhibited higher EMI SE than that filled with AgNP, which can be attributed to fewer requirements in the content. Highly flexible ultralight biopolymer aerogels, consisting of cellular biomimetic microstructures formed from silver nanowires (AgNW) and cellulose nanofibers (CNF), were fabricated <span class="italic">via</span> the facile and convenient freeze-casting method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> The honeycomb-like, lamellar and random porous scaffolds were obtained by adjusting the freezing techniques to modulate the relationships among the microstructure, macroscopic, mechanical and EMI shielding performance.

The prepared CNF/AgNW materials exhibited hydrophobicity and antibacterial properties, which extended the application potential of the hybrid biopolymer aerogels. Although there have been several polymer composites with nanostructured silvers exhibiting moderate stretchability, their EMI SE usually deteriorates consistently with stretching. Therefore, Yao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> developed a highly stretchable polymer composite based on a three-dimensional (3D) liquid-metal (LM) network embedded in polymer matrix, which exhibited significant improvement in EMI SE when stretched. The composite matches the EMI SE of metallic plates within the unexpectedly broad 2.65–40 GHz frequency range. The electrical conductivity of the 3D LM composite is among the state-of-the-art in stretchable conductors under high mechanical deformations. With skin-like elasticity and toughness, the composite material paves the way for emerging soft and human-friendly electronics. Composites having conductive coatings are other common forms of composite shielding materials. The surface-type conductive polymers can be prepared by different methods, such as electroplating, electroless plating, ion plating, vacuum deposition, zinc flame spraying, zinc arc spraying, conductive paints, cathode sputtering, foils, laminates, and tapes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27,121</span></sup></a> However, the outlined operations for surface treatment are secondary techniques to the mixing and molding procedures, and require additional surface preparation, as well as special construction equipment. Low mechanical properties, high rigidity, poor wear and scratch resistance are the next drawbacks, which limit the application of metalized polymers, such as the shielding materials in many applications.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> Also, as metals are prone to corrosion, this effect may lead to the non-linearity in surface compactness, and thus negatively influence the shielding performance. Shipeng <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> examined the effect of various metal fillers on the shielding efficiency of electromagnetic shielding coatings. They revealed differences in the microstructure of coatings prepared with different morphologies of metal powders. Silver powder and the silver-plated copper powder are flakes in the material preparation process. When deposited on the surface, the metals overlap the surface very well. This leads to the reduction of voids on the surface layer, leading to the improvement of high-frequency shielding performance. Nickel powder is spherical with more hollows
in the microstructure. As the EM wave frequency increases, the electromagnetic radiation on the coating penetration capacity increases, resulting in lowered EMI shielding ability. The coating of metallic nickel on the activated carbon fiber felt (ACFF) <span class="italic">via</span> the electrodeposition method and investigation of EMI SE of the prepared materials in the X-band frequency was the main goal of the work.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> Ni coating on ACFF lowered the absorbed process, and the main mechanism of EMI shielding was based on reflection (almost 94% at around 8 GHz).

Yoo-Ji Yim <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> used the electroless plating method for the fabrication of nickel/copper sulfide–polyacrylonitrile (Ni/CuS–PAN) fibers, and investigated their EMI shielding properties.

          <span>In contrast to the highly conductive metals with mostly reflection-dominated shielding mechanism, materials possessing electric and/or magnetic dipoles are suitable for shielding applications, in which the prevailing shielding mechanism is absorption. Electric dipoles exhibit materials with high permittivity, such as Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, ZnO or BaTiO<small><sub>3</sub></small>, whereas magnetic dipoles are present in materials with high permeability (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>, different types of ferrites, mumetal, super permalloy). The high initial permeability of magnetic fillers, for instance ferrites, gives the possibility for the fabrication of polymer composites with absorption-dominated shielding at the broadband frequency range. One of the biggest disadvantages of magnetic fillers is their worse dispersion within polymer matrices, and the fact that magnetic fillers are inactive fillers from the point of their physical–mechanical properties. This means that their incorporation into polymer matrices is usually connected with the deterioration of the tensile strength characteristics of composite materials. The problem can be solved by the combination of magnetic fillers with carbon-based fillers, which facilitates the dispersion of magnetic fillers within the polymer matrices by increasing the viscosity of the polymer melts, and thus increasing the shear stress during compounding on the one hand. On the other hand, carbon-based fillers as reinforcing fillers contribute to the improved physical–mechanical properties of polymer composites. The dispersion of magnetic fillers can also be improved by using the segregated microstructure techniques, followed by the enhanced conductivity characteristics of composites (see Section 5.3.5.2). The combination of magnetic fillers and carbon-based fillers, or the preparation of composites by the segregated microstructure approach, seems to be the future trend in the development of polymer composites with incorporated magnetic fillers.</span>

The amount of metal oxides in the composites, which were prepared by solvent casting method, ranged from 0.1 to 10 wt%.

The results showed that the permittivity of the tested composites showed a decreasing trend with an increase in frequency, but increased with increasing content of NiO. This can be attributed to the interfacial polarization on the boundaries between the two phases, where the space charges of NiO accumulate at the interface. The absorption increment was found to be higher than the reflection increment due to the interaction of the EM waves with electric dipoles. The increase of the absorption shielding was recorded with increasing content of NiO due to interfacial polarization, which increased the absorption increment (from 7.1 dB at 5 vol% to 11.4 dB at 25 vol% loading). The reflection increment also increased with increasing content of NiO as a result of the conductivity increase (from 0.33 dB at 5 vol% to 1.04 dB at 25 vol% loading). As a consequence, the overall EMI SE was also enhanced with increasing content of nickel oxide.

The prepared nanocomposites exhibited low dielectric loss (0.31 at 8.2 GHz) and excellent dielectric permittivity (64 at 8.2 GHz), which were reported to be among the best values published, over the X-band frequency range. The outstanding dielectric properties of the composites can be attributed to the dimensionality match between the fillers, higher dispersion state of the fillers, positioning of the ferroelectric MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>NW in-between space of AgNW, which increased the dielectric permittivity of the composites. Furthermore, MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>NW acted as a barrier, which cut off the contact spots of AgNW, resulting in lower dielectric loss. The aligned structure of AgNW increased the specific surface area of AgNW.

The EMI SE of the composites also showed a decreasing trend with an increase in the ferrite ball milling time, and increased with increasing frequency. The maximum EMI SE value of 3.75 dB was reached at 1 GHz and 10 mm thickness of the composite. The results revealed that the reflection loss and multiple reflection loss were much lower than the absorption loss in the tested frequency range, which indicates that absorption is the dominant mechanism of shielding.

Jagatheesan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit146"><sup><span class="sup_ref">146</span></sup></a> investigated the electromagnetic absorption characteristics of the carbon helical yarn fabric-based composites and manganese–zinc (MnZn) ferrite filler-loaded 3 phase fabric composites. The carbon helical yarn fabric composite was fabricated by sandwiching a fabric with polypropylene (PP) films and thermally pressed. The results revealed that the absorption loss of the composites was low in the C-band frequency region (4–8 GHz). To enhance the absorption coefficients, MnZn ferrite particles were dispersed in the PP matrix. The PP/ferrite composites showed higher permeability and permittivity values. Thus, the absorption loss of the composite materials was improved. As the filler content increased, the magnetic permeability and dielectric loss of the PP/ferrite composites increased due to the enhanced magnetic loss. The increasing content of ferrite resulted in the improvement of the absorption loss and total EMI SE. The work<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">147</span></sup></a> deals with the investigation of the shielding characteristics of the three-phase percolation composites, which were prepared by dry-mixing technique from Ni fillers, microsized NiCuZn ferrites and polymer epoxy matrix. The results demonstrated that Ni fillers occupy the inside of the polymer gap, and act as magnetic bridges to improve the magnetic exchange coupling and effective permeability due to the decreasing demagnetization field. The frequency response of the microwave absorption in composites is attributed to the dielectric and magnetic losses correlated with the spin resonance, domain-wall motion and dipolar relaxation. The increasing content of Ni in the composites caused a significant increase in their microwave absorbing properties. Below 0.7 GHz, the microwave absorption of composites occurred mainly due to dielectric loss. On the other hand, the magnetic loss mainly contributed to the absorption shielding at higher frequency. The authors also stated that the double-layer absorbers, which are laminated with high dielectric/magnetic loss structure, exhibit a higher return loss, lower matching frequency and narrower absorption bandwidth.

The presence of the nanoparticles resulted in the enhancement of the thermomechanical, as well as dielectric response. Three relaxations were observed in the dielectric spectra of the composite systems, originating from the polymer matrix and the filler. These are the interfacial polarization, which is due to the accumulation of free charges at the filler–rubber interface, the glass to rubber transition of the polymer matrix, and the rearrangement of the small polar side groups of the polymer chains. Zinc ferrite imparts magnetic properties to the polymer matrix. As a result, the magnetization of the composites increases with increasing filler content. The results also revealed that the composites exhibit superparamagnetic behavior at room temperature.

The absorption maxima of the composites were reached at −30 dB at 1.1 GHz frequency and −35 dB at 0.9 GHz frequency for NBR/Li ferrite composites or NBR/MnZn ferrite composites, respectively. Composites filled with Li were reported to be more suitable for absorption shielding than those of NBR/MnZn due to their lower optimal material thickness and wider absorbing frequency bandwidth.

          <span>Carbon based fillers show unique characteristics, such as high permittivity, excellent conductivity, low density, high mechanical, chemical and thermal stability, as well as outstanding physical properties. Those attributes make them suitable candidates for EMI shielding applications. Moreover, due their diverse structures, they exhibit higher or lower reinforcing character, and contribute not only to the enhanced EMI shielding characteristics of polymer composites, but also to improve their physical–mechanical and dynamic properties. These materials thus offer a great opportunity to manufacture many varieties of polymer materials with tunable electrical, optical, magnetic and physical–mechanical properties.</span>
          
            
            <span id="sect1264"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">5.3.4.1 Carbon black (CB). </span>
            <span>Carbon black (CB) is the most frequently used carbon-based filler in polymer industry, especially in rubber products manufacturing due to their affordable price, ease of production and tunable physical properties. Moreover, it is an excellent UV absorber, protecting polymer composites from UV-light exposure. CB is used as a reinforcing filler in a variety of products, such as tyres, conveyor belts, mechanical goods, cables, wires, footwear or shock absorbers. Carbon black is produced by the incomplete combustion of gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons, derived mostly from petroleum. Although carbon black is mainly composed of carbon, it also contains small amounts of chemically combined hydrogen and oxygen groups. Carbon black primary particles have an onion-like paracrystalline structure (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11b</a>). The bent and fractured crystallites consist of parallel, graphitic layer planes (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11a</a>). The primary particles connect together to form an aggregated chain-like structure. The primary structure is then the single aggregate (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11c</a>). A secondary structure is the agglomerate, which is formed from clusters of physically bound and entangled aggregates (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig11">Fig. 11d</a>). The particular structure of CB depends mainly on the manufacturing and processing conditions. In general, smaller particles of CB together with higher structure and low volatility (fewer chemisorbed oxygen groups) shift towards higher conductivity in polymer composites.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> As the reinforcement filler, conductive CB helps to improve the conductivity of polymer composites even at lower contents in comparison to the conventional CB. Rahaman <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> studied the influence of two types of conductive carbon black (Printex XE2 and Conductex) on the EMI shielding characteristics of composites based on ethylene–vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA), acrylonitrile–butadiene rubber (NBR) and their blends. The results showed that Printex carbon black exhibited higher conductivity and higher EMI SE in comparison with Conductex at the same loading, which can be attributed to the higher structure (aggregating tendency, and thus formation of conductive network in polymer matrices) of Printex carbon black when compared to that of Conductex carbon black. Mondal <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">179</span></sup></a> used a single-step solution mixing to prepare composites based on chlorinated polyethylene (CPE) and conductive Ketjen carbon black (K-CB) with high EMI shielding characteristics associated with absorption-dominant ability by conductive dissipation, as well as reflection of EM waves. The relatively low content of K-CB with respect to other conventional carbon black fillers contributed to a low percolation threshold (9.6 wt% of K-CB) and high EMI SE of 38.4 dB (at 30 wt% loading) in the X-band frequency region. Classical percolation theory demonstrated that the electrical conductivity behavior through the CPE/K-CB composite materials is quasi-two dimensional in nature. The investigation of the DC conductivity, dielectric and microwave absorption properties, and overall EMI SE of silicone rubber filled with 1–15 wt% of carbon black was the main aim of the study.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a> The results showed that the percolation threshold was reached even at a lower amount of carbon black in the rubber matrix compared to that in the previous case (3 wt%). The complex permittivity values revealed that composites filled with 5 wt% of CB showed more than 90% microwave absorption (reflection loss ≥10 dB) within the 8–18 GHz frequency range and composite thickness of 1.9–2.7 mm. Composites filled with 15 wt% of CB exhibited −40 dB EMI SE in the tested frequency range and thickness of 2.8 mm. The authors stated that the prepared rubber composites can be used as microwave absorbers in stealth applications, as well as for EMI shielding of electronic devices in diverse civilian and military areas.

Regardless of the composite conductivity and thickness, absorption was found to be the dominant shielding mechanism, contributing up to 87% of the total EMI SE. In the study,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit182"><sup><span class="sup_ref">182</span></sup></a> silicone rubber (Q)/polyolefin elastomer (POE) blends containing ionic liquids (1-vinyl-3-ethylimidazolium bromide IL) modified with carbon black (CB–IL) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT–IL) were fabricated by melt-blending and hot pressing. The results showed that Q/POE/CB–IL and Q/POE/CB–MWCNT–IL composites exhibited co-continuous structural morphologies. The cation π-interactions between IL and MWCNT were stronger than those between IL and CB due to the high length and large surface area of MWCNT, which facilitated better dispersion of the carbon-based fillers. The conductive networks play an important role in the reflection, absorption and scattering multiplication of the EM waves. The prepared composites Q/POE/CB–MWCNT–IL showed outstanding EMI shielding characteristics due to the synergistic effect of IL-modified CB and MWCNT. The composite with composition 60/40/15–5–4 wt% of Q/POE/CB–MWCNT–IL exhibited an overall EMI SE of 36.5 dB at 9 GHz.

            <span>Carbon nanotubes (CNT) are allotropes of carbon with a cylindrical or tubular nanostructure containing six-membered carbon rings. These cylindrical carbon molecules have unusual properties, which are valuable for nanotechnology, electronics, optics and other fields of materials science and technology. In addition, owing to their extraordinary thermal conductivity, mechanical and electrical properties, carbon nanotubes find applications as additives to various structural materials. Carbon nanotubes are categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWCNT) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig13">Fig. 13a</a>) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNT) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig13">Fig. 13b</a>). The electrical properties of SWCNT are different from MWCNT due to their smaller diameter and higher aspect ratio. As a result of this, both types exhibit different EMI SE characteristics when incorporated in polymer composites. The main drawbacks of SWCNT are the complicated fabrication process, extremely high conductivity and poor magnetic characteristics. These features limit the utilization of SWCNT as excellent microwave absorption materials. MWCNT are the more preferred types of carbon nanotubes. MWCNT consists of multiple layers of graphite superimposed and rolled into a tubular shape. The structural disorders, which appear in MWCNT during the production process, are responsible for the unique optic, electrical properties and also other features.

The results showed that injection-molded nanocomposites, in which MWCNT were aligned, exhibited lower EMI shielding characteristics in comparison to compression-molded nanocomposites with a random distribution of MWCNT. This was attributed to the lower probability of MWCNT to make contact with adjacent MWCNT particles in the injection-molded nanocomposites. The compression-molded composites exhibited higher electrical conductivity and lower percolation threshold when compared to corresponding injection-molded composites. The lower shielding efficiency of the injection molded composites can be attributed to the lower electrical conductivity, imaginary permittivity (ohmic loss) and real permittivity (polarization loss). Finally, the authors stated that EMI shielding does not require filler connectivity. However, the filler connectivity increases EMI SE.

The investigation of the complex impedance in the frequency range of 1 kHz to 2 MHz revealed that the real part of the dielectric permittivity changed from positive to negative in the electrically percolated composites, suggesting the metal-like behavior of the filler segregated network. However, in contrast to the reflective metals, the high EMI SE of the PE-based composites within the 40–60 GHz frequency range was due to absorption coursed by multiple reflection on every PE/CNT segregated network interface, followed by EMI absorbed in each isolated PE granule enclosed by conductive CNT shells (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig14">Fig. 14</a>). Composite materials with segregated conductive filler networks exhibit high conductivity, resulting in the efficient attenuation of EM radiation by both reflection and absorption processes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit209"><sup><span class="sup_ref">209,210</span></sup></a> Cui <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit211"><sup><span class="sup_ref">211</span></sup></a> developed a segregated polylactic acid PLA/CNT composite with high electrical conductivity and improved shielding effectiveness of 35.5 dB in the X-band frequency range at CNT content of 1.0 wt%.

Inorganic hollow microspheres were found to be low-cost materials with good chemical stability, low weight and high-temperature resistance. They are ideal raw materials for the preparation of absorbing polymer composites as their micron size promotes the ease of combination with the polymer matrix. The HGM embedded into the polymer matrix play an important role in reflecting and multiple scattering of the incident EM waves (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig15">Fig. 15</a>). The synergistic effect between the HGM and the MWCNT conductive networks, governed by a dominant absorption mechanism, resulted in a significant improvement to the EMI SE of the porous composites.

Composites filled with MWCNT were found
to reach the lowest percolation threshold and the highest overall EMI SE, which can be attributed to the higher aspect ratio and conductivity of MWCNT in comparison with CNF and HS-CB.

            <span>Graphite (GR) has a layered lattice structure consisting of sheets of carbon atoms arranged in a regular hexagonal pattern (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16</a>). It is a crystalline material, in which the sheets are stacked parallel to one another in regular fashion. The intermolecular attractive forces between the sheets are relatively weak physical van der Waals bonds, making graphite soft and brittle. In the lattice, carbon atoms are bonded together by covalent carbon–carbon bonds. The low price, good electrical conductivity, good thermal and mechanical stability make it an attractive filler in optic, electronic and energy devices. Over the last years, more and more attention has been paid to the expanded graphite (EGR). Expanded graphite, obtained by heat treatment, consists of a small stack of graphite layers and exhibits high mechanical stability, low resistivity and low cost. The biggest disadvantage of graphite and expanded graphite is their poor magnetic characteristics, which restricts their utilization in EMI shielding applications.</span>

            <span>Graphene oxide (GO) is the 2D oxidized form of graphene decorated with various functional oxygen groups, such as epoxy, carboxyl, carbonyl, hydroxyl, diol or ketone, preferentially on the basal planes (bottom and top) and graphitic edges.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">137,138</span></sup></a> It is a single-atomic layered material, which is produced by oxidation of graphite using strong oxidizing agents. Due to the polar oxygen groups, it is hydrophilic, which enables it to extract GO after water sonication. It is dispersible in water and in a variety of inorganic and organic solvents, in which the functional groups of GO can be easily modified by other materials. It is also considered easy to process. Graphene oxide is not a good conductor, but its heat and light treatment or chemical reduction can restore most properties of pristine graphene. It can be reduced in solutions, as well as in the form of thin films using a variety of reducing conditions, and reduction converts GO into the excellent electrical conductive material. For the synthesis of graphene oxide, four basic methods are generally applied, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, Hofmann, Brodie, Staudenmaier and Hummers, which are thermal or mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or epitaxial growth (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19</a>). The effectiveness of the oxidation process is often determined by the oxygen/carbon ratios of GO. Graphene oxide has become one of the most popular 2D materials available and has attracted much interest thanks to its outstanding properties, such as large surface area, excellent mechanical stability, tunable electrical, optoelectronic and transport properties, which hold great promise for versatile applications in the field of photocatalysis, memory devices, solar cell, energy storage/conversion, chemical sensors, optoelectronics, drug delivery, as well as composite materials. The excellent compatibility of graphene oxide with polymers makes it an attractive filler for the preparation of composites with significantly enhanced electrical and thermal conductivity, tensile strength or elasticity. The excellent mechanical and reinforcement properties of polymer composites arise from the oxygen-containing functional groups of GO, which help to increase the interfacial bonding and to transfer stresses from the polymer matrix to the filler and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68,228,229</span></sup></a></span>

Moreover, the functional groups and structural defects within the RGO sheet help to improve the impedance mismatch, electronic dipole polarization and defect polarization relaxation.

The unique size and platelet morphology of GNP make these nanoparticles especially effective for providing barrier properties, while their pure graphitic composition imparts them with excellent thermal and electrical characteristics. When they are added at 2–5 wt% to the polymer matrices, they form polymer composites that are not only thermally or electrically conductive and less permeable to gases, but simultaneously improve the physical–mechanical properties like the tensile strength, stiffness, surface toughness or design flexibility. The outstanding increase in the thermal conductivity of the GNP-based polymer composites can be attributed to the GNP 2D planar structure, which minimizes the phonon scattering on the polymer/nanofiller interface. The edges of the nanoparticles can be occupied with functional groups, such as carboxyls, ethers or hydroxyls. Those functional sites show the possibility of the surface modification and functionalization of GNP with other suitable materials, providing hydrogen or covalent bonding capability, as well as enable higher interactions with polymer matrices. Graphene nanoplatelets can be produced from natural graphite <span class="italic">via</span> liquid phase chemical exfoliation without further centrifugation steps.

The composite containing 15 wt% of NiO presented the best morphology and EMI SE of 32 dB in the 0–6 GHz frequency range. The authors stated that the improved EMI SE could be attributed to the percolation network formed through the introduction of conductive GR/NiO hybrid fillers in the polymer matrix, and the formation of higher amount of magnetic and electrical dipoles. In the scientific research,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266</span></sup></a> a simple chemical method with the introduction of hydrazine hydrate as a reductant was used to uniformly anchor silver nanoparticles on the surface of poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) microspheres.

The minimum reflection loss was achieved at 8.8 GHz (−28.1 dB) with a composite thickness of 2 mm, and the effective absorption bandwidth (reflection loss less than −10 dB) ranged from 7.9 GHz to 9.8 GHz. However, the content of PAN/Ag and RGO was only 3 wt% and 1 wt%, respectively. As the amount of the PAN/Ag powder decreased to 1 wt%, the EP/PAN/Ag/RGO composite still retained favorable microwave absorption performance with the optimal reflection loss of −14.7 dB.

Moreover, the ultralight and ultrathin composites can be easily bent, folded and twisted, showing their simple and excellent processability for commercial applications.

The combination of the prepared foam with epoxy resin resulted in the fabrication of 3D EP/RGO/AgPS nanocomposites showing strongly regular segregated structures. Due to the interconnected hollow conducting networks of RGO/AgPS and the interfacial synergy between EP and RGO/AgPS, the 3D EP/RGO/AgPS composites containing 0.44 vol% of RGO and 0.94 vol% of AgPS revealed the maximum EMI SE of 58 dB in the X-band frequency range (99.99% shielding of EM waves). This represents 274% enhancement when compared to that of the 3D EP/RGO nanocomposites (21 dB). In their work,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit270"><sup><span class="sup_ref">270</span></sup></a> Choudhary <span class="italic">et al.</span> stated that the EMI shielding efficiency of the composites based on polyvinylidene fluoride and carbon nanostructures embedded with cobalt nanoparticles is strongly dependent on the concentration of graphitic carbon and the magnetic properties of the Co particles. Co nanoparticles encapsulated by graphitic carbon and incorporated in the PVDF matrix were prepared by the one-pot pyrolysis process at two different temperatures, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, 1000 °C (Co-1000) and 800 °C (Co-800). It was shown that the pyrolysis temperature plays a significant role in determining the morphology, structure and magnetic characteristics of the polymer matrix, graphite layer and cobalt nanoparticles. The Co-1000 sample exhibited a high saturation magnetization and higher content of graphitic carbon when compared to that of the Co-800 sample. This resulted in a higher EMI SE of PVDF/C/Co-1000 nanocomposite. The higher impedance mismatch and dielectric loss of the PVDF/C/Co-1000 nanocomposite originates from its more inhomogeneous dielectric medium. Finally, it was reported that the highly magnetic particles and higher degree of graphitization shift towards more effective EMI shielding of the polymer nanocomposites. The same group of authors investigated the X-band frequency range EMI shielding behavior of the flexible PVDF composites containing tubular- and globular-shaped carbonaceous nanostructures decorated with mono-metallic (Ni), as well as bi-metallic (CoNi, FeNi, MnNi) alloy nanoparticles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271"><sup><span class="sup_ref">271</span></sup></a> Pyrolysis was carried out at 800 °C and 1000 °C to fabricate carbon-structured materials having two different morphologies. Carbon nanotubes were mostly observed in the samples synthesized at 800 °C, while carbon globules (CG) were formed in the samples prepared at 1000 °C. The PVDF/CNT composites showed better microwave-shielding behavior than the PVDF/CG composites, which was attributed to the improved absorption of the EM microwaves through the interfacial polarization loss and ohmic conduction. The 1D structure of CNT provided the required conduction pathways for the electrons, and generated the network to trap the EM microwaves within them through multiple scattering. It was reported that the microwave absorption performance of the composites resulted mainly from the graphitic walls of CNT, the metallic nature of the embedded nanoparticles, and the graphitic layer encapsulating the metallic nanoparticles. The authors further demonstrated the direct correlation of the EMI shielding performance of the tested nanocomposites with the morphology of the carbon-structured nanomaterials and the conductivity of the implemented metallic nanoparticles. The influence of the nanocomposite preparation methods on the electromagnetic parameters, electrical conductivity and EMI SE of the polypropylene/nickel-coated carbon fiber PP/Ni-CF composites was investigated in the work performed by Lee <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit272"><sup><span class="sup_ref">272</span></sup></a> The composites were prepared by using an internal mixer, injection molding machine, and screw extruder. The highest electrical conductivity (17.5 S cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) and EMI shielding ability (48.4 dB at 10 GHz) exhibited composites prepared by injection molding. This can be attributed to the increased CF length when the PP/Ni-CF nanocomposite was fabricated by injection molding, which led to the formation of a conducting network within the composite. It was also reported that the major electromagnetic absorption mechanism was dielectric loss, namely the dipole and interface polarization and polarization between the filler and the polymer matrix, which resulted in the enhanced EMI absorption values.</span>

The thorough analysis of the shielding efficiency within the 8.2–18 GHz frequency range showed that in addition to the magnetic and conductive losses due to SYCO and CB, respectively, the synergy among PVDF, CB and SYCO facilitates shielding by input impedance matching, improving the multiple internal reflection from SYCO followed by subsequent CB absorption, dielectric damping losses, eddy current losses and interfacial polarization losses. The proposed shielding mechanisms contributed to the excellent EMI SE of 50.2 dB, from which 41.2 dB was the contribution of absorption.

      <h2 id="sect1782"><span class="a_heading">6 Conclusion and future outlooks</span></h2>
      <span>The current study provides detailed insight into conductive polymers and polymer composites filled with different inorganic metallic and magnetic fillers, as well as organic carbon-based fillers and their combinations, which are able to shield harmful electromagnetic radiation. After a brief introduction of the theoretical fundamentals, the relationships between the morphology, structure, functionalization of the materials with respect to their magnetic, dielectric, conductive and EMI shielding characteristics are closely described. Polymers and polymer composites are versatile and widely used materials. In contrast to heavily-massed ceramics, concretes and metals, they exhibit the ease of processability, low density, good corrosion resistance or high design flexibility, tunable mechanical and structural properties. In addition, depending on the composition, type and amount of the filler, they exhibit small matching thickness, high absorption, and wide frequency bandwidth, pointing to their potential for various EMI shielding applications.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">The development in the field has progressed in enormous speed over the last several years, and many challenges have been still demanding. The shielding by absorption has become the most desirable, since the absorbed electromagnetic wave is efficiently attenuated and not emitted back to the surrounding. Although many fabricated materials exhibit high absorption ability, their absorption shielding is limited to the narrow frequency bandwidth or high shield thickness. Thus, the development of multifunctional polymer composite systems seems to be the future trend to reach the requirements, where the suitable correlation among permittivity, permeability, conductivity, frequency and thickness can be achieved. Another factor that must be taken into account is the weight, physical–mechanical and functional properties of the final materials. The main mechanism of shielding of metallic fillers is mostly based on reflection, which is not desirable. However, the utilization of metallic inclusions as the back side of the shield can provide the solution for EMI to be re-reflected to the body of the shield, in which it can be efficiently absorbed. Magnetic fillers possessing electric and/or magnetic dipoles exhibit good absorption ability. The disadvantage of inorganic fillers is that their incorporation into the polymer matrices is usually connected with the deterioration of the physical–mechanical properties and thermo-oxidative stability of the composites. High-density metals and ferrites also increase the weight of the composites. On the other hand, carbon-based fillers show high permittivity, excellent conductivity, low density, as well as outstanding physical properties. Thus, they contribute not only to the good shielding efficiency, but also to the improved physical–mechanical properties of the corresponding composites. Moreover, due to the high aspect ratio, the percolation threshold can be reached at lower filler content. It is believed that the suitable combination of the fillers in a proper content and ratio, together with the proper selection of polymer matrix/matrices might be the key for the development of high-tech materials, demonstrating not only excellent shielding performance, but also applicable physical–mechanical and structural features. The recently introduced novel ultra-efficient EMI shielding composite foams, hydrogels, aerogels or advanced multicomponent or multilayer 3D composite architectures present the cutting-edge materials with high application potential in different areas of practical, scientific, military and commercial applications.</p>
