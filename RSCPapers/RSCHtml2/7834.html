      <h2 id="sect765"><span class="a_heading">Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>The availability of effective and general protocols for the direct and selective structural modification of complex biorelevant compounds is of utmost importance in research and development (R&amp;D) campaigns. Actually, they are considered a powerful tool to speed up the optimization of ADME profiles and physical properties such as solubility and stability. Over and above these key issues, late-stage functionalization (LSF) of pharmaceutical agents can hasten the identification of structure–activity relationships (SARs), thereby optimizing on-target potency and minimizing undesired off-target effects.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1–5</span></sup></a> Even the introduction of small alkyl groups can have dramatic effects on the bioactivity profiles of complex molecular architectures: it is indeed always astonishing to consider how a simple change of a C–H to a C–Me bond can induce up to a 2135-fold boost in the potency of a drug candidate thanks to both conformational changes and hydrophobic effects, thereby leading to the postulation of the so-called <span class="italic">magic methyl effect</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> Groundbreaking avenues in the field of LSF have been unearthed by Baran lab in 2012 who devised sodium and zinc sulfinate based reagents<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> (known with the commercial name of Baran Diversinates™) and by Sharpless lab in 2014 with the development of sulfur(<span class="small_caps">VI</span>) Fluoride Exchange (SuFEx) chemistry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> To this end, visible-light photocatalysis (Vis-PC) offers unique opportunities to achieve smooth and clean functionalization of drugs by unlocking site-specific reactivities under generally mild reaction conditions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> As a matter of fact, fine-tuneable settings relying on single-electron transfer processes (SET) mediated by excited-state organic or metal-based photosensitizers, hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) catalysts, or the formation of electron–donor–acceptor (EDA) complexes, have been rescuing open-shell intermediates from being considered untamed species, thereby further extending the scope of radical chemistry to LSF and supporting the translational potential of radical species.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10,11</span></sup></a> Additionally, the possibility of unravelling unexpected reactivities far beyond the classical ionic chemistry triggered by thermal activation provided new stimulating perspectives in the synthesis of drugs.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12–14</span></sup></a> In order to promote the application of photosynthetic approaches to the synthesis of target compounds, recently, König, prompted by the lack of bachelor and master courses focused on photochemistry and photoredox catalysis, issued specific retrosynthetic disconnections with informative schemes, availability of the catalysts and reagents, and functional group tolerance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> The widening of knowledge in the field to an even broader readership including medicinal chemist practitioners is a priority for scientists committed to the advancement of such a chemistry domain. The innate green features arising from being inspired by Nature's exploitation of light radiation as primary energy source throws vibrant brushstrokes of colors in the landscape of industrial-scale synthesis of drugs.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16–19</span></sup></a> Yet, while advancements in the field of Vis-PC have been recurrently reviewed,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20–29,30–37</span></sup></a> a comprehensive highlight of exclusive opportunities provided by Vis-PC for the late-stage modification of pharmaceuticals has not been reported so far. Accordingly, the present review aims to bridge this gap by selecting visible light promoted transformations which have been applied to bioactive substrates as chemical inputs, thus demonstrating to be enough mild, robust, and general to become part of the existing LSF toolboxes. To this end, original articles published from 2014 up to June 2020 have been covered. <small><sup>#</sup></small> The manuscript is organized in paragraphs and subparagraphs on the basis of the key-reactive functional groups directly engaged in the visible light promoted processes and either already present on the drug scaffolds or formerly introduced to provide a suitable handle for the derivatization. The section dealing with arenes C(sp<small><sup>2</sup></small>)–H functionalization includes also heteroarenes when they have been enclosed in the scope of the protocol, while the section addressing heteroarenes C(sp<small><sup>2</sup></small>)–H functionalization covers methodologies limited to such a class of aromatic substrates. Furthermore, synoptic tables divided by functional groups can be found as ESI,<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> in order to provide a useful, fast, and easy reference to the transformations discussed in the text.

      <span>The reductive addition of carbon-centered radicals to electron-poor olefins, also known as Giese-type addition, is one of the most exploited photocatalyzed transformations enabling the redox-neutral construction of C–C bonds.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit38"><sup><span class="sup_ref">38,39</span></sup></a> In particular, in the first reports by Minisci <span class="italic">et al.</span> and by Giese <span class="italic">et al.</span> the intermediate C-centered radicals were generated by using either metal salts and diacyl peroxides or alkyl-mercury salts and NaBH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, respectively. At the time, this kind of transformation was mainly exploited for the synthesis of tailor-made polymers, and in order to develop more controllable reaction conditions suitable for the creation of polyfunctionalized small molecules, the influence of substituents at both the olefin and the radical center on reactivity as well as regio- and stereo-selectivities were largely investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> With the burgeon of visible light photocatalytic methods, a plethora of mild synthetic protocols have spread out in the literature, thus enabling ever increasing applications of Giese-type reactions to the construction of diverse and complex linear and cyclic scaffolds. Thanks to the identification of suitable and often bench stable radical precursors, olefins have been reported to smoothly undergo alkylation and arylation, as well as the introduction of functional groups such as fluoromethyl<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41</span></sup></a> or perfluoroalkyl, halogens, amines, amides, sulfonamides, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, thus providing an easy access to chemical useful intermediates. Worthy of note, as highlighted hereafter, the scope of such a powerful transformation, has been extended in recent years to convergent three-component processes and to the achievement of enantioenriched scaffolds <span class="italic">via</span> the use of asymmetric either metal-based photocatalysts or organocatalysts. Additionally, the merging of photoredox and transition metal catalysts, empowered the obtainment of functionalized olefins <span class="italic">via</span> crosscoupling pathways following the photoinduced generation of open-shell intermediates.</span>

Interestingly, the use of quinuclidin-3-ol as additive is required to enhance boronic acids and esters reactivity, characterized by high oxidation potentials, by engaging their vacant p-orbital in a dative bond with the n-orbital of the Lewis base. A single-electron oxidation of the complex boronic acid/ester-LB, with a reductive quenching cycle of the photocatalyst, allowed the smooth generation of the carbon-radical, which will then add to the alkene. The reaction scope was widely demonstrated with electron-deficient olefins, with both alkyl- and aryl-boronic acids, and with alkyl-boronic esters, while aryl-boronic esters were found to be substantially less reactive.

The aryl bromide scope was wide, and sensitive functional groups such as acidic, electrophilic, and homolytically labile C–H bonds were well tolerated. Suitable tertiary alkyltrifluoroborates included polycyclic ones, while secondary radicals gave satisfactory yields, partially affected by a direct cross-coupling as a major competing reaction pathway. Moreover, other electronically deficient alkenes, bearing ester and nitrile functional groups, could be incorporated into the reaction scope.

          <p class="otherpara">The mechanistic approach always relied on the excited-photocatalyst mediated oxidation of arenes through a SET event generating the corresponding cation radicals, which were able to act as electrophiles for nitrogen nucleophiles. In particular, aryl amination was accomplished by using Me<small><sub>2</sub></small>-Mes-Acr<small><sup>+</sup></small> under blue LEDs irradiation, and DCE or a mixture of DCE and pH 8 phosphate buffer (if amine hydrochloride salts were employed) as solvent. With anisole as the starting arene, a mixture of <span class="italic">ortho</span>- and <span class="italic">para</span>-regioisomers were obtained. Nevertheless, amino acid esters, linear aliphatic amines, bulk amines such as <span class="italic">tert</span>-butyl amine, halogenated amines, allylamine, benzylamine derivatives, including chiral ones, proved all to be suitable substrates. The scope of pharmaceutically relevant complex amines included adamantylamine and memantine, anti-Parkinson and anti-Alzheimer drugs, respectively; the antiviral rimantadine, gapentin methyl ester, and mexiletine (<strong>701–705</strong>, <a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch126">Scheme 126</a>). As for the arene coupling partner, the regioselectivity of the amination could be altered depending on the substitution pattern on the phenolic ether: more steric encumbered aliphatic (Me, Et, <span class="italic">t</span>Bu) and silyl-protected (TES, TBS, TBDPS) phenolic ethers led to higher amounts of the <span class="italic">para</span>-isomer. With halogens on the aromatic ring, a substoichiometric amount of TEMPO was required, and the major product resulted from an <span class="italic">ortho</span>-addition with respect to the methoxy substituent. In general, 1,2-, 1,3- and 1,4-disubstituted arenes reacted efficiently, and when an additional ring was present, the functionalization only occurred on the more-electron-rich ring. Examples of heterocycles such as 2,6-dimethoxypyridine, <span class="italic">N</span>-methylindazole, and 7-bromo-<span class="italic">N</span>-methylindazole all gave single regioisomers. As examples of complex biorelevant arenes the NSAID fenoprofen, gemfibrozil, clofibrate, and bezafibrate were successfully aminated with <span class="italic">tert</span>-leucine methyl ester or valine methyl ester.</p>

The authors developed a computational model able to predict both reactivity and regioselectivity by considering some innate factors of the aromatic systems such as the redox potentials, the electrophilicity, the electron-density, the representation (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> delocalized or localized distonic alkene cation radical) of the intermediate aryl cation radical after a SET oxidation from the photocatalyst, and the electronic nature and the position of substituents. These parameters were computationally investigated and compared with experimental data for a wide number of aromatic scaffolds, which were grouped into two main classes: (i) six-membered aromatics such as benzenoids, pyridines and quinolines and (ii) aromatics with at least one five-membered heteroaromatic ring or aromatic bicyclic [4.3.0] core. As general guidelines, for the first group, the site of functionalization matched E<small><sub>A</sub></small>S selectivity, whereas, for the second category including pyrazoles, indazoles, bridging-nitrogen polyaromatics, benzofurans, indoles and benzazoles, the site of functionalization matched where iminium or oxocarbenium radical character predominated. Remarkably, as several classes of aromatic heterocycles were too electron-deficient and could not be oxidized by the acridinium catalyst, being so unreactive under the developed conditions, selective functionalization of more electron-rich heteroaromatics could be possible (for a flowchart further illustrating general selectivities for heterocycles grouped by class see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

      <span>The emergence of visible light photocatalysis, besides injecting new life into the realm of radical chemistry, has further strengthened the long-standing intimate connection between synthetic organic chemistry advancements and medicinal chemistry progresses. The collection of photosynthetic approaches here reported calls attention to the importance of including examples of bioactive complex scaffolds, during the evaluation of the scope of new synthetic protocols, in an ever-increasing number of articles. Major future perspectives undoubtedly include the increase of site-selectivity along with its predictability, the investment of resources to identify effective and general protocols circumventing the use of precious metal complexes, and the implementation of flow techniques, which, by providing high illuminated surface-to-volume ratios, holds promise for the inclusion of photochemical processes in industrial settings. Likewise, the merging of photo- and micellar catalysis, albeit poorly investigated so far, could land new efficient green methodologies associated with optimum mass-based metrics (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> E factor and PMI) thanks for example to the possibility of recycling aqueous solutions of the photocatalyst while extracting the products with organic immiscible solvents.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit502"><sup><span class="sup_ref">502,503</span></sup></a> Up-and-coming alliances come from photochemistry and electrochemistry as well as biocatalysis giving birth to research areas such as synthetic photoelectrochemistry and photobiocatalysis.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit504"><sup><span class="sup_ref">504,505</span></sup></a> Light-driven synthetic applications keep becoming more and more exciting and we are confident that the late-stage functionalization of pharmaceuticals will mirror such a glowing future.</span>
