Moreover, the use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a C1 building block to mitigate CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions and, at the same time, produce sustainable chemicals or fuels is a challenging and promising alternative to meet global demand for chemicals and energy. Hence, the chemical incorporation and conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into valuable chemicals has received much attention in the last decade, since CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is an abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic, nonflammable, and renewable one-carbon building block. Nevertheless, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is the most oxidized form of carbon, thermodynamically the most stable form and kinetically inert. Consequently, the chemical conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> requires highly reactive, rich-energy substrates, highly stable products to be formed or harder reaction conditions. The use of catalysts constitutes an important tool in the development of sustainable chemistry, since catalysts increase the rate of the reaction without modifying the overall standard Gibbs energy in the reaction. Therefore, special attention has been paid to catalysis, and in particular to heterogeneous catalysis because of its environmentally friendly and recyclable nature attributed to simple separation and recovery, as well as its applicability to continuous reactor operations. Focusing on heterogeneous catalysts, we decided to center on zeolite and ordered mesoporous materials due to their high thermal and chemical stability and versatility, which make them good candidates for the design and development of catalysts for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion. In the present review, we analyze the state of the art in the last 25 years and the potential opportunities for using zeolite and OMS (ordered mesoporous silica) based materials to convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into valuable chemicals essential for our daily lives and fuels, and to pave the way towards reducing carbon footprint. In this review, we have compiled, to the best of our knowledge, the different reactions involving catalysts based on zeolites and OMS to convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into cyclic and dialkyl carbonates, acyclic carbamates, 2-oxazolidones, carboxylic acids, methanol, dimethylether, methane, higher alcohols (C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH), C<small><sub>2+</sub></small> (gasoline, olefins and aromatics), syngas (RWGS, dry reforming of methane and alcohols), olefins (oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes) and simple fuels by photoreduction. The use of advanced zeolite and OMS-based materials, and the development of new processes and technologies should provide a new impulse to boost the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into chemicals and fuels.</p></div><hr/><table><tr><td class="biogPlate"><a href="/image/article/2023/CS/d2cs00456a/d2cs00456a-p1_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: d2cs00456a-p1.tif" src="/image/article/2023/CS/d2cs00456a/d2cs00456a-p1.gif"/></a><p><span class="graphic_title">

        <h3 id="sect815"><span class="b_heading">1 Scope</span></h3>
        <span>Since 1850 and the beginning of the industrial revolution, human sources of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere have grown constantly and dramatically, at a rate of almost 3% each year. The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions and population growth<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> can be closely linked and world population, currently 7.8 billion, is expected to reach 9.1 billion by 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100. This population growth will mainly occur in developing countries. Besides, if until now the impact of developing countries over greenhouse gas emission has been negligible, this is now increasing and will continue to do so, due to the economic development needed to reduce poverty and the actual linkage of economic development, energy consumption and use of fossil hydrocarbons as the primary source of energy. However, this paradigm can be changed and, at present, several efforts are being devoted to energy generation on the bases of renewable sources.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The global warming is one of the main issues of the 21st century and it is principally due to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and methane emissions. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is a greenhouse gas present in the atmosphere at a concentration of 418 ppm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions are also related to ocean acidification, climate change and species extinction. For many years, the technologies of capture, storage or sequestration of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from concentrated emission sources (natural gas and industrial processing) or air constitute powerful methods to reduce atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Moreover, the capture technologies make CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> available for its use in food processing and chemical industries. Incorporating anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and building chemicals is a way to pave a path towards a more sustainable and renewable carbon economy and neutrality, and constitutes a supplement to geological sequestration. Thus, our society is moving away from carbon capture and storage (CCS) to carbon capture and utilization (CCU). Consequently, the chemical incorporation and conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into valuable chemicals has received much attention for the last decade. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is an abundant, inexpensive, nontoxic, nonflammable, and renewable one-carbon building block. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> finds main purposes as green alternative to carbon monoxide and phosgene in the production of carbonates, carboxylic acids and derivatives. Nevertheless, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is the most oxidized form of carbon, thermodynamically the most stable form and kinetically inert. Consequently, chemical conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> requires highly reactive, rich-energy substrates, highly stable products to be formed or harder reaction conditions. In the context of low-carbon economy, the use of severe reaction conditions cannot be considered since the high-energy consumption also involves more CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, unless the energy will be supplied by renewables sources. Some traditional thermal processes allow the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> incorporation into valuable products such as the synthesis of urea,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3,4</span></sup></a> salicylic acid<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> and inorganic carbonates that do not require the use of catalysts to be industrially applied.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6–8</span></sup></a> Meanwhile, numerous catalytic transformations have been the center of several studies using organometallic complexes<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> and heterogeneous or homogeneous catalysts,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10–13</span></sup></a> and the incorporation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into chemicals such as urea derivatives, carbonates, carbamates, methanol and dimethyl-ether, alcohols, formic and carboxylic acids, alkanes, olefins and aromatics, among others, has been described.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,14–16</span></sup></a> Nevertheless, the scope and efficiency of the reported CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transformations are narrow and have not been industrially applied due to the thermodynamic stability and kinetic inertness of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Indeed, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transformations usually require the use of a high ratio of organometallic compounds, solvent, additives associated with the production of large amounts of hazardous wastes and are generally performed under harsh reaction conditions.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In chemical processes, the use of catalysts constitutes an important tool for the development of sustainable chemistry. Indeed, catalysts increase the rate of reaction without modifying the overall standard Gibbs energy change in the reaction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> Therefore, an adequate and effective activation of substrates (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) allows overcoming the energy barrier of the reaction, improving the reaction rate and selectivity. Consequently, highly efficient catalysts in terms of energy, selectivity, productivity and reusability are decisive to develop a sustainable and economic process (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>). Thus, in accordance with green chemistry and sustainability criteria, the development of effective and robust heterogeneous catalysts is crucial (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>).</p>

        <p class="otherpara">Solid catalysts are attractive due to advantageous characteristics such as activity, robustness, efficiency, recovery and recycling, ease of handling that makes them economically advantageous, and environmentally friendly by minimizing waste. Focusing on heterogeneous catalysts, we will center here on ordered micro- and meso-porous materials because of the flexibility in their composition and pore structure system and their high surface area and because they are adjustable and customizable. Considering ordered microporous materials for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, metal organic frameworks (MOFs) have exhibited catalytic activity for transforming CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into chemicals and several compilation works have been published in the last few years.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12,16,18</span></sup></a> Nevertheless, chemical, thermal and mechanical stability of MOFs<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19,20</span></sup></a> is one of the major concerns.

        <h3 id="sect873"><span class="b_heading">2 Zeolites</span></h3>
        <span>Followed by ordered microporous materials, zeolites constitute the most important catalysts traditionally used in oil-refining and petrochemistry<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> and find numerous applications as adsorbents, ions exchangers and finally as catalysts in many chemical processes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25,26</span></sup></a> More specifically, zeolites are crystalline microporous aluminosilicates with cavities and pore topologies of molecular dimensions (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig4">Fig. 4</a>). Zeolites are characterized by their high surface areas and shape/size selectivity along with the flexibility in their chemical compositions and the ability to accommodate different metals in their frameworks, resulting in acid/base or redox properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> Moreover, their high thermal stability makes them robust and readily reusable after the regeneration stage.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The versatility in the tetrahedra assembly lead to the diversity of zeolite structure with tridimensional framework constituted by cages and channels with molecular dimensions. Up to now, 235 natural and synthetic zeolite framework types have been recognized by the International Zeolite Association (IZA) and assigned with a three-letter code.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28,29</span></sup></a> Zeolites are characterized by dimensions of the channels conventionally defined by the ring size of the aperture. Accordingly, zeolites are classified as small-pore (≤8-ring), medium-pore (10-ring), large-pore (12-ring), and extra-large-pore zeolites (&gt;12-ring). The microporous void space enables the access and diffusion of molecules with suitable size, shape, and polarity, well-known as shape-selectivity in zeolites. In some cases, the molecular dimensions of zeolites pore systems present severe limitations for the access, formation and diffusion of large molecules. Therefore different strategies were explored to improve the diffusion, increasing the zeolite pore sizes,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30–33</span></sup></a> decreasing crystal size,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34–36</span></sup></a> forming single layer zeolites (delaminated) or introducing mesoporosity into the zeolite crystals.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37–40</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The zeolite framework is formed by corner-sharing TO4 tetrahedra where T could be a metal or metalloid such as Si, Al, Fe, Ge, B, Ti, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, while in the aluminophosphate family Al and P are predominant. The substitution of an atom by another with a lower valency such Si<small><sup>4+</sup></small> with Al<small><sup>3+</sup></small> or P<small><sup>5+</sup></small> with Si<small><sup>4+</sup></small> generates a negative charge on the framework which has to be compensated by a proton or a metallic cation that is responsible of the acid/base properties of the zeolites. Compositional and geometric factors are the main features that control the acid/base properties.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The basicity of the zeolites is associated with the presence of basic framework oxygen atoms, basic sites of the Lewis type, and their strength is related to the density of negative charge. Therefore, the zeolite basicity is a function of the nature of the framework atoms, the extra-framework cation nature and the zeolite structure. To modify and enhance the basic properties of zeolites two main approaches have been explored: the incorporation of alkali metal clusters and oxide/hydroxide particles or the variation of the nature of the cation framework or extra-framework with suitable physicochemical properties using low electronegativity cations such as alkali metal cations.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41–44</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">In the same way, the partial substitution of Si atoms with Sn, Ti, or Zr introduces well-defined Lewis acid sites conferring new catalytic properties on the zeolite which are mainly governed by the metal coordination.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45,46</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Owing to their remarkable properties (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a>) such as high hydrothermal stability, adsorption, acid/base and redox properties, availability and low production cost, zeolites have been widely and successfully used as efficient catalysts, adsorbents, and ion exchangers. Zeolites can also act as host for different compounds such as single atom, metal clusters or nanoparticles,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit47"><sup><span class="sup_ref">47–51</span></sup></a> molecular catalysts, organometallic species or forming composites with multi-functionalities.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52,53</span></sup></a> The preparation of these advanced multifunctional materials can be performed during the zeolite synthesis, by adsorption/impregnation, ion-exchange and assembly inside the pores and cages (ship-in-a-bottle), and with or without reaction with silanol groups of the surface (covalent bond). On the bases of the versatility of zeolites in composition, structure and catalytic properties and their industrial availability, zeolites can be active players for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture and conversion.</p>

The use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as C1 building block is very attractive since it provides an eco-friendly process that fulfills numerous principles of “Green Chemistry”. Moreover, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> shifts from an undesirable waste to an alternative carbon feedstock. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is the most oxidized form of carbon and so very stable. Consequently, chemical conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> requires highly reactive/rich-energy substrates or strong reaction conditions (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>). Therefore, catalysis is key for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and the design of suitable catalysts will allow overcoming the kinetic barriers enabling new technologies for a sustainable transition to fossil sources. Accordingly, owing to the great features and customizable properties, industrial availability and thermal stability, zeolites and ordered mesoporous silicates may offer great opportunities for conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into valuable chemicals in order to minimize, and perhaps revert, the greenhouse effect of anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit76"><sup><span class="sup_ref">76–79</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">Here, we present a critical review of the different reported concepts and findings on the mechanism, catalytic performance, catalyst types and strategy design in the direct successful conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into chemicals in the presence of advanced zeolites and OMS based materials. Although different reviews present CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions, this review differs in presenting the potential and versatility of zeolites and OMS and their capabilities to be engineered for preparing catalysts suitable for the development of industrial catalysts directed in the manufacture of a wide range of bulk, commodity, specialties and fine chemical products, polymers and fuels. Several chemical conversions of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig7">Fig. 7</a>) for the synthesis of carbonates (cyclic and dialkyl), carbamates (acyclic and 2-oxazolidinones), carboxylic acid through different chemical reactions such as cycloaddition, carboxylation and coupling are explored. Numerous CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions based on hydrogenation/reduction process for the production of MeOH, DME, C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, or SYNGAS through RWGS are also reviewed. The main achievements for the production of gasoline, olefins and aromatics through CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation undergoing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> modified Fischer Tropsch or methanol mediated route have been discussed taking into account several recent and very comprehensive reviews.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11,80–89</span></sup></a> The dry reforming of methane and alcohols with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> constitute other important pathways to produce SYNGAS and allow for a continuity in the production of a broad range of chemicals, commodities, specialties and fuels, currently manufactured from fossil resources. The oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes to ensure a more sustainable and selective production of alkenes is also reviewed. Finally, the photocatalysis using zeolite and OMS-based materials for the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to the production of solar fuels has been examined. Considering the environmental impact, economic cost and sustainability, an analysis of the different developed catalytic systems has been done based on the required reaction conditions such as temperature, pressure and catalyst efficiency and availability. From now on, in order to mitigate the effect of anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, considering the global situation of energy deficiency, all processes that contemplate CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> use and conversion, especially those involving high energy consumption, must use green and renewable energy, (sun, wind, and water), to be sustainable and efficient.</p>

              <span>A broad variety of advanced heterogeneous catalytic systems is reported in the bibliography, and some of them exhibited high catalytic behavior with good scope for the cycloaddition of epoxides with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Nevertheless, some of the reported catalysts presented one or more disadvantages such as low stability, need for a co-catalyst, poor catalyst reusability or harsh operating conditions (high pressure and/or high temperature). Moreover, the catalyst cost remained high, especially if there was limited reusability and loss of efficiency along the runs. A catalytic system incorporating quaternary ammonium halide has shown to be efficient for the cycloaddition of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and epoxide. In this sense, the ability of zeolite and OMS as a host should be a reliable avenue for the development of an efficient and stable heterogeneous catalyst for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> cycloaddition with epoxide, due to the synergistic effects of the multifunctional active sites of quaternary ammonium halide, for one side, and for example of a Lewis acid present in the zeolite or OMS structure, for the other. Accordingly, among all examples, the possibility of using ordered micro and mesoporous materials incorporating the structure directing agents (SDAs) that can act as active sites for catalyzing the cycloaddition opens interesting opportunities since they moreover present high stability against leaching and hard reaction conditions and demonstrate recyclability. On the other hand, this approach lowers the cost of the catalyst which is limited to the cost of zeolite or mesoporous material synthesis, which in addition could be further calcined and used in other processes. Undoubtedly, the systematic study and understanding of the reaction mechanism, kinetics, thermodynamics, determination of reaction intermediates and active species due to the advantages of computational chemistry, and <span class="italic">in situ</span> and <span class="italic">operando</span> spectroscopy should allow a great understanding, to help rationalize experimental results and thus the design of new efficient zeolite and OMS-based catalysts and processes.</span>

            <span>Dialkyl carbonates play an important role in our daily life and among them the most important short-chain dialkyl carbonates are diethyl (DEC) and dimethyl carbonates (DMC). The numerous properties of dialkyl carbonates such as polarity, good biodegradability, low toxicity and reactivity make them important chemical materials to produce polycarbonates, chemical intermediates, fuel additives and solvents for coating, adhesives and for batteries.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit90"><sup><span class="sup_ref">90,91,203,204</span></sup></a> Dialkyl carbonates can be prepared by different phosgene free synthetic routes such as alcoholysis of urea, oxidative carbonylation of alcohols or transesterification of cyclic or dialkyl carbonates. The interests and economic viability of each route vary in function of local resources, environmental standpoint, value and application of the dialkyl carbonates. The direct carbonylation of alcohols by reacting CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with two equivalents of an alcohol to yield linear carbonates and water as the sole side-product, constitutes a valuable and attractive alternative. This direct synthesis pathway offers a green and sustainable approach to prepare linear carbonates but is very challenging because of the need to activate CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the unfavourable thermodynamics of the reversible process, the deactivation of the catalysts, and the hydrolysis of dialkyl carbonates formed due to the concomitant formation of water (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch33">Scheme 33</a>). Thus, the development of effective catalytic system requires the combination of an efficient and recyclable catalyst with a dehydration system. Indirect synthesis of dialkyl carbonates from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can also be carried out starting from urea produced at a large scale from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The production of dialkyl carbonates directly from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> requires both the activation of alcohol and the formation of alkyl species and activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecules preferably over acidic and basics sites, respectively.

Therefore, the design of efficient and recyclable catalyst has been based on this acid–base catalytic mechanism. Metal oxides have therefore been intensively explored as catalysts for the preparation of dialkyl carbonates since they offer the possibility of combining the presence of both acid and basic active sites on the catalytic surface with tunable strength, dispersion and structure. Also, the synergetic effect between acidic and basic sites can be provided by amphiprotic oxides.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit209"><sup><span class="sup_ref">209</span></sup></a> Therefore, different oxides mixtures (CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) have been employed.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit210"><sup><span class="sup_ref">210,219–221</span></sup></a> As aforementioned, the basicity in zeolite and ordered mesoporous material is associated with the presence of framework oxygen atoms, Lewis basic sites, and their strength is related to the density of negative charge. Therefore, the basicity or the negative charge on oxygen atom, is a function of framework atoms, the extra-framework cations nature and the structure. To modify and enhance the basic properties different approaches can be followed such as the occlusion in the pore system of alkali metal clusters and oxide/hydroxide particles, or the modification of the intrinsic basicity of the framework oxygen, varying the cation framework or by cation-exchange of the extra-framework cations, suitably using low electronegativity cations such as alkali metal cations.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit41"><sup><span class="sup_ref">41–44</span></sup></a> Following these leads, the catalytic performance of solid base materials, CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> or exchanged alkali metal MCM-41 and Na-ZSM-12, Cs-ZSM-12 zeolites were investigated for the synthesis of diethyl carbonate in the presence of butylene oxide as a dehydrating agent.

At 170 °C and 4.5 MPa CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> pressure, low yield and selectivity to diethyl carbonate (DEC) were achieved. The higher DEC formation was obtained in the presence 16 wt% Ce–H-MCM-41 and 32 wt% Ce–Si-MCM-41 and attributed to the presence of weak and strong basic sites while no DEC was observed in the presence of the alkali metal exchanged materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit222"><sup><span class="sup_ref">222</span></sup></a></span>

            <span>The direct synthesis of dialkyl carbonates is a difficult task due to the thermodynamics and the reversibility of the process. Moreover, the production of water constitutes another limitation and induces a rapid deactivation of the catalysts and hydrolysis of the carbonates. Very few attempts to design and develop heterogeneous catalytic systems have been investigated and this remains a topic to be explored. Zeolites and ordered mesopore-based catalysts, due to their versatility in accommodating different types of active sites and the possibility to control their hydrophobic properties, should be good candidates to develop active and efficient catalysts to activate both CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and ROH molecules and remove water through chemical transformation or rapid desorption from the catalytic surface. Moreover, the development of knowledge and insights into the elucidation of catalytic species, intermediates and substrates through theoretical calculations, characterization and modeling studies should be of great value to rationalize experimental data and design new efficient and recyclable catalysts.</span>

              <span>The syntheses of acyclic carbamates have been scarcely investigated in the presence of zeolites and OMS based catalysts although good yield and selectivity were reached. The recyclability of the catalysts should be further explored and reaction conditions improved for achieving potential application. This process generally requires highly active and selective homogeneous organometallic complexes and strong bases, and it is of interest to find heterogeneous alternatives. Today, it is still difficult to transfer the remarkable catalytic activity of homogeneous organometallic complexes to solid catalysts. Nevertheless, recent developments in the rational design of solid catalysts with well defined single or multiple active sites, can help in the synthesis of tailor made hybrid organic–inorganic structured materials containing one or the two required catalytic functions. This last could be a good direction in the achievement of more successful solid catalysts for the synthesis of acyclic carbamates.</span>

          <span>Several investigations have focused on substituting toxic carbonylating agents by inexpensive, nontoxic and accessible CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Nevertheless, due to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> inertness, the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> fixation to produce 2-oxazolidines is a difficult task and several limitations such as moderate yields and selectivity, the use of large amounts of homogeneous catalysts and harsh reaction conditions constitute impediments for the high-scale production. Therefore, the design and development of efficient, selective, recyclable and economic catalysts is still challenging. Today, we have knowledge and tools for the rational design of micro and mesoporous materials that can act as molecular sieves for reactant selection, while containing well-isolated single or multiple active sites accommodated on the zeolite walls, and so accessible to reactants through their diffusion. From there, materials could be developed with regular pores and cavities, even by “<span class="italic">ab initio</span>” synthesis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> that can control the reactant adsorption and transition-state stabilization and supplying the desired process selectivity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit313"><sup><span class="sup_ref">313</span></sup></a> Besides, kinetic, theoretical and modelling studies, are still required to a rational design of the catalysts. Then, owing to their robustness, versatility in their possibilities of functionalization, and zeolite and OMS-based catalytic systems containing multi-active centers for activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecules and others components of the different CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> fixation pathways may offer opportunities worth being explored for the production of carbamates.</span>

            <span>There are more than 200 papers published in the last decade dealing with the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into methanol. Nevertheless, few studies reported the direct hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into MeOH using zeolite based catalysts. However, the textural properties of ordered mesoporous silica have been used to disperse the metal-oxide active phase and to take advantage of the confinement. Due to the enhanced catalytic performance of the ternary catalyst Cu/ZnO/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, and the similarity between syngas-to-methanol conversion, Cu-based and Cu/ZnO based materials have been extensively investigated. Up to now, Cu is regarded as the main active component for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation and ZnO is regarded to promote hydrogen spillover and the dispersion of Cu nanoparticles. Numerous papers described the catalytic performance of catalysts based on Cu and/or Pd.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit371"><sup><span class="sup_ref">371,418</span></sup></a> Actually, bifunctional metal-zeolite based materials are preferentially used for the synthesis of dimethylether, olefins or aromatics since it is possible to take advantage of the acid properties of these materials and shift the process selectivity avoiding competitive side reactions. Indeed, the presence of multinuclear metal centers and active sites in a single solid catalyst presents several advantages over mononuclear catalysts due to the cooperativity effect between the different centers such as synergetic activation of substrates and electronic interactions between the metal centers, which is potentially beneficial to the catalytic activity. Hence, investigations have focussed on the preparation of metal oxides with excellent activity and stability for the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and efficient catalysts should exhibit high specific surface area, high number of active sites, high dispersion, optimum acid/base site distribution, and small particle size in order to increase the activity and selectivity to methanol.</span>

              <p class="otherpara">Recently, the catalytic performance of Cu supported on Zr-doped SBA-15 was explored.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit440"><sup><span class="sup_ref">440</span></sup></a> The Zr doping allowed promoting the formation of acid sites, and because Cu is prone to occupy the acid sites, higher Cu dispersion was reached. Before Cu nanoparticles’ confinement inside the pores, the external surface of Zr-SBA-15 was methylated and functionalized with amine groups to promote Cu<small><sup>2+</sup></small> coordination. High catalytic activity of Cu/Zr-SBA-15 was reached, achieving 15% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion but with low selectivity to MeOH, close to 27% (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>, entry 8). In a following work, the Cu/Zr-SBA-15 catalytic performance was reported under optimized reaction conditions and exhibited 25% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion after 14 days with considerably improved methanol selectivity close to 80% (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>, entry 9).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit441"><sup><span class="sup_ref">441</span></sup></a> More recently, the same group reported the preparation of Cu/Zr-SBA-15 following different synthetic routes.

Differences in catalytic selectivity were attributed to the Zr content that contributes to the electron/oxygen mobility of Cu and controlled the amount of weak and medium acid sites. The DME selectivity increases when increasing the strength of acid sites with medium acid strength. Then, Cu/Zr-SBA-15_EIWI with high total concentration of acid sites exhibited high methanol selectivity (92%) at 6.5% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>, entry 10). DRIFTS studies revealed that DME formation came from two surface methoxy groups in the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation reaction, when its concentration is high enough to form DME, while methanol formation is favoured since it only requires one molecule (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19</a>).</p>

Numerous investigations have focused on the confinement of the Cu–ZnO–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> active phase in OMS<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit443"><sup><span class="sup_ref">443</span></sup></a> due to the activity of Cu–Zn–Zr catalysts<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit444"><sup><span class="sup_ref">444,445</span></sup></a> for methanol synthesis. Accordingly, the ordered mesoporous channels of SBA-15 were exploited to control the particle size, dispersion, and morphology of Cu-oxide nanoparticles, and to promote the interaction between multi-active sites for the double activation of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is adsorbed on the active support while H<small><sub>2</sub></small> is adsorbed on the Cu phase to provide atomic hydrogen. The presence of zirconia was shown to enhance both the yield and selectivity to methanol. The maximum activity for the catalyst CZZS_20_1 (Cu–ZnO–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/SBA-15) with a space-time-yield (STY) of methanol of 376 mg<small><sub>CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH</sub></small> h<small><sup>−1</sup></small> g<small><sub>cat</sub></small><small><sup>−1</sup></small>, 37-times higher than that of the unsupported homologue was reached. The enhanced catalytic performance of the SBA-15 supported catalyst was attributed to the exposure of the active phase to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>. An experiment of 50 h of TOS support showed the high performance, stability and the industrial potential of the CZZS_20_1 catalyst (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>, entry 11).</p>
              <p class="otherpara">The confinement of the Cu–ZnO–MnO (CZM) active phase was also achieved in morphologically distinct siliceous porous carriers such as SBA-15, MCF and KIT-6.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit446"><sup><span class="sup_ref">446</span></sup></a> SBA-15 is a 2D mesoporous silica with pore channels in a hexagonal arrangement, MCF (mesostructured cellular foam) is a 3D mesoporous silica with large uniform spherical cells and KIT-6 is an ordered 3-D mesoporous silica with a gyroid cubic structure. The effect of different textural properties was expected to greatly influence the catalytic behavior of the prepared catalyst. Indeed, a large surface area carrier was expected to promote the formation of small metal nanoparticles with high dispersion, enabling the exposure of a large metal surface area to the reactants. CZM-SBA-15 and KIT-6 resulted to be the most efficient catalysts with 99% methanol selectivity and particularly, CZM KIT-6 exhibited a higher CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion (8.2%) and STY (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>, entries 12 and 13). The Cu<small><sup>0</sup></small> particle size after reduction followed the order CZM/KIT-6 &lt; CZM/SBA-15 &lt; CZM/MCF, inversely to the Cu<small><sup>0</sup></small> surface area that followed the order CZM/KIT-6 &gt; CZM/SBA-15 &gt; CZM/MCF. Thus, together with a higher copper surface area, the particular morphological features of KIT-6 enabled higher CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> effective diffusivity. Therefore, the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was correlated with the order of copper surface area, since dissociative adsorption of H<small><sub>2</sub></small> occurs on the copper sites, and as could be expected, the production of atomic hydrogen increases when increasing the copper surface area. The H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPR reduction peak was deconvoluted into two peaks assigned to the low-temperature reduction of well-dispersed CuO, and to the high-temperature reduction of bulk CuO (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit435"><sup><span class="sup_ref">435</span></sup></a> For CZM/KIT-6, a lower temperature for both reduction peaks was recorded, indicating the higher dispersion of CuO and lower metallic phase/support interaction for this sample.</p>

              <p class="otherpara">A study of the Ce content in Cu–ZnO–CeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> dispersed in SBA-15 showed that methanol and CO synthesis can be controlled at the interface of Cu/ZnO/CeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> due to the synergistic effects between the three active components and the basic character of CeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit227"><sup><span class="sup_ref">227</span></sup></a> Suitable morphological features of SBA-15 promoted the mass and heat transfer as well as a high dispersion and exposure of the active phases, enabling the production of methanol and CO. Cu is regarded as the active site for activating hydrogen while ZnO and CeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> are the promoters, which exhibit excellent adsorption and activation capacities for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is more efficient than ZnO in promoting the dispersion of Cu nanoparticles and methanol generation, while ZnO promoted the dispersion of CeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> and the production of CO. Both ZnO and CeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> were beneficial for hydrogen spillover but mainly took part in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and influence product selectivity. XPS and Cu LMM XAES spectra of the reduced sample showed no satellite peaks of Cu 2p<small><sub>3/2</sub></small> and Cu 2p<small><sub>1/2</sub></small> in the XPS spectrum, indicating that Cu<small><sup>2+</sup></small> was completely reduced, while two peaks at 932.7 and 952.7 eV were assigned to Cu 2p<small><sub>3/2</sub></small> and Cu 2p<small><sub>1/2</sub></small> of Cu<small><sup>+</sup></small> or Cu<small><sup>0</sup></small>, respectively.

The shift towards lower values indicates the strong interaction between metallic species, Cu, ZnO and CeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> due to the Lewis acidity of ZnO and CeO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> which promotes the presence of Cu<small><sup>+</sup></small> beneficial for the hydrogenation process.

High dispersion of metal oxides generally involves strong metal/support interaction leading to a shift to higher temperature of the reduction peak.

            <span>The direct hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to form methanol requires further development and improvement of catalyst activity, selectivity and stability for industrial application. The hydrophobic properties of the catalyst surface have to be considered, and further studies on the nature of the catalyst active species and reaction intermediates are required for a successful design of an efficient and selective catalyst. The reported catalysts are multifunctional and multidimensional, characterized by different active sites with different chemical and oxidation states, with different electronic and geometrical environments with specific activities for each stage of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to methanol transformation process. It is therefore crucial to determine and control the active species, reaction intermediates and kinetics for the rational design of more efficient catalysts. Thus a better understanding and knowledge of what happens at the molecular level should help to find consensus on the mechanisms involved in the hydrogenation reaction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to methanol of which adsorption phenomena are key. Therefore, the successful design of a new efficient catalyst requires the combination of computational chemistry studies with <span class="italic">in situ</span> spectroscopy to elucidate the fundamental steps for the adsorption and activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, for the hydrogenation reaction and the desorption of the product.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">In addition, special attention should be paid to the morphology of the support to improve the physical isolation and shielding of metal species. In this regard, the use of OMS materials, hierarchical zeolites, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials can promote the amount, dispersion and stabilization of the active centers.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Considering thermodynamics, the development of catalysts able to work at low temperature and high pressure is a clear objective. The morphology, topology, thermal stability, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, acid/base and redox properties of zeolite and OMS materials are properties that can be tailored when designing new catalysts and they should play a key role.</p>

          <span>Aromatics are important intermediates for petrochemical and chemical industries.

Since methanol synthesis from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81,371,482,483</span></sup></a> has been widely studied, the combination of catalytic properties or directly of catalysts suitable to perform methanol synthesis and C-methylation should enable the methylation of aromatics starting from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>. It seems that for this cascade process, it may be worthwhile to study micro- and mesoporous catalysts. Very recently, the catalytic methylation of aromatics using CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> using a physical mixture of Re/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H-MOR, both catalysts suitable for the methanol production and subsequent C-methylation at low temperature, was reported<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit484"><sup><span class="sup_ref">484</span></sup></a> with good catalytic performance at 1 MPa <span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>, 5 MPa; P<small><sub>H<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>, 250 °C and 20 h in a batch reactor.

The process was also performed over the optimized catalytic system using MeOH, CO/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and HCOOH/H<small><sub>2</sub></small>.

These results are promising although the selectivity to xylenes and <span class="italic">p</span>-xylene is still low and no data for a continuous process have been reported.

Therefore the presence of metal oxide and acid sites in a single system<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit500"><sup><span class="sup_ref">500,514,515</span></sup></a> could improve mass transfer, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and rates of hydrogenation/dehydration, due to the proximity of active sites.</p>

            <span>The DME synthesis involves three main reactions, the RWGS, the methanol synthesis and dehydration (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch51">Scheme 51</a>). With the exception of RWGS, all the reactions are exothermic and so thermodynamically disfavoured with high temperature. The dehydration reaction of methanol occurs without variation in the number of moles and is slightly exothermic over solid acid catalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit516"><sup><span class="sup_ref">516,517</span></sup></a> Accordingly, the process pressure does not affect the extent of the dehydration reaction while lower temperatures are thermodynamically beneficial. Besides, the dehydration reaction of methanol allows shifting the thermodynamic equilibrium for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation and working at lower pressure and higher temperatures (&gt;240 °C) that have been shown to promote the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> activation rate and the formation of methanol or carbon monoxide.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit518"><sup><span class="sup_ref">518</span></sup></a></span>

            <p class="otherpara">As it occurs for methanol synthesis, where the active catalyst for methanol from syngas showed to be active for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation, the active catalysts for DME synthesis from syngas exhibit activity to DME synthesis from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. For methanol synthesis, the suitable properties of Cu<small><sup>0</sup></small> for H<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissociation, and the dispersion effect of carrier oxides<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit519"><sup><span class="sup_ref">519–522</span></sup></a> such as ZnO, Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, and ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> providing an active metal–oxide interface to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and activation have been largely described and studied. Accordingly, the direct CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation into DME is generally performed in the presence of Cu-based methanol synthesis catalyst (CuO–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> or CuO–ZnO–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>)<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit511"><sup><span class="sup_ref">511,523</span></sup></a> and an acid catalyst, such as γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, silica–alumina or zeolites for methanol dehydration. Due to its acid properties γ-alumina could be a good candidate for the methanol dehydration reaction but as we discussed for methanol synthesis, alumina presents some limitations. The hydrophilicity of γ-alumina and ZnO has a negative effect over the metal particle stability and favours sintering and agglomeration. Moreover, water has strong competitive adsorption with methanol and so it inhibits the methanol dehydration step. Zeolites offer great potential due to suitable and controllable Brønsted and Lewis acid properties, water resistance and shape-selectivity. Among zeolites, HZSM-5 zeolite based catalysts have been widely used for methanol dehydration due to their suitable acid properties that have to be tuned to avoid the formation of hydrocarbons. Following these leads, numerous catalytic systems based on Cu and HZSM-5 have been studied for the direct hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The metal particle size, usually Cu, plays a great role in methanol synthesis activity, and consequently in DME formation. Nevertheless, the stability of Cu particles, under reaction conditions, is limited due to sintering and agglomeration, as it was discussed for methanol synthesis. Hence, different strategies, such as the addition of a dispersive phase or promoters (ZnO, ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, La<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and MnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) or the addition of a second hydrogenation metal with suitable properties to dissociate H<small><sub>2</sub></small> such as Pd, are followed to improve the bifunctional catalytic system. Then, different preparation methods have been developed, including co-precipitation, sol–gel, citrate or impregnation routes, in order to increase the catalyst activity and stability. The main challenge is to reach high DME selectivity (&gt;70%) at a high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion level, minimizing CO production and avoiding catalyst deactivation.</p>

            <span>Cu-based zeolite catalysts have been the main zeolitic catalysts reported up to now for the transformation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into DME. Catalytic systems to direct transformation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to DME have to contain active sites for methanol synthesis and for methanol dehydration that could be integrated with a hybrid catalyst or which are present in two different catalysts physically mixed. For the first time a hybrid catalyst incorporating both functionalities for methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration was prepared by impregnation in 2001.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit524"><sup><span class="sup_ref">524</span></sup></a> The Cu–Mo supported HZSM-5 catalyst was found to be highly active for DME synthesis. The addition of a small amount of Mo enhanced the catalytic activity of the hybrid catalyst that was found to be stable for 10 h of time of stream. DME was produced with high selectivity of up to 77% and low 12.3% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, at 240 °C and 2 MPa (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>, entry 1).</span>

              <span>A large variety of catalysts for direct CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation into DME have been studied such as Cu–ZnO, Pd and bimetallic catalysts. Among them, Cu–ZnO based catalysts are undoubtedly the most commonly explored and used. Among the Cu based catalysts, the mostly studied and employed catalytic system for direct DME synthesis from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are conventionally Cu–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> and Cu–ZnO–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> based catalysts. Cu–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> based catalysts are traditionally used for direct hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into methanol and have been widely used and studied for direct hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into DME. The catalytic system should consist of a physical mixture or hybrid catalysts with active sites for both methanol synthesis and dehydration that will involve a zeolite function.</span>

Different strategies to design and prepare new structured zeolitic catalysts with high dispersion and stabilized metallic active sites have been investigated. For methanol synthesis, it was demonstrated that the yield and selectivity were highly dependent on Cu dispersion and surface area. However, Cu in Cu–ZnO based catalysts is thermally unstable and the particle size increases with temperature over 250 °C inducing the loss of surface area and sintering. Moreover, the production of water causes poisoning of acid active sites and Cu sintering. Rare earth metal oxides added in small amounts usually act as promoters to improve the dispersion of the active phase and the thermal stability of the catalysts. Following these leads, and to improve the catalytic properties of CuO–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5, a new design of catalyst structure was developed. An encapsulated catalyst composed of CuO–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> composite nanoparticles as the core and HZSM-5 as the shell was prepared, with the HZSM-5 shell being synthesized hydrothermally onto CuO–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> nanoparticles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit529"><sup><span class="sup_ref">529</span></sup></a> At 270 °C and 3.0 MPa, 48.3% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and 23.4 and 48.5% of DME yield and selectivity were reached (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>, entry 7). No deactivation of the catalyst was observed for the first 24 h. Then, the catalyst stability was attributed to the core–shell structure that allowed controlling the consecutive order of the reaction, methanol synthesis and methanol dehydration.

H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPR profiles showed that La incorporation induced an increase of peak area of reduction of CuO indicating that CuO species dispersion was improved by incorporating La. Moreover, a shift of the reduction peak positions to higher temperatures was observed with La incorporation of up to 2%, as well as a shift to lower temperatures. These results indicate that La<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> also makes difficult the reduction of CuO because of the strong interactions between metallic phases ZnO–CuO–La<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>. It was concluded that La doping allows enhancing the dispersion of the CuO copper oxide and reduction of CuO while the strong interactions between CuO–ZnO–La<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> hinder the reduction of CuO, implying that a balance between the benefits and detriments of La<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> addition has to be found (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig25">Fig. 25</a>).

Indeed, NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>-TPD profiles showed that the amount of the strong acid increased to a maximum with La content, up to 2 wt%, and then decreased. This behavior was attributed to the acidic properties of the lanthanum ions, and to the polarization of the hydroxyl group of the silicon and aluminum framework, leading to stronger acidity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit532"><sup><span class="sup_ref">532</span></sup></a> At higher La contents, the formation of La<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> with basic properties involves the formation of new basic sites on the catalytic surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit533"><sup><span class="sup_ref">533</span></sup></a> At 250 °C and 2 MPa, high 43.8% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and 71.2% selectivity to DME were reached (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>, entry 9).

              <p class="otherpara">(i) <span class="italic">Effect of proximity between acid and metallic active sites</span>. The catalytic behavior of the adequate combination of Cu–ZnO–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> materials and commercial H-ZSM5 to the direct CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation reaction to DME was studied in different reactor bed configurations (physical mixing (ZZ-M), dual-bed (ZZ-D) and mono-bed prepared by grinding and pelletization (ZZ-G)).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit518"><sup><span class="sup_ref">518,534</span></sup></a> At 3.0 MPa, the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion varied from 1.6 to 16.1%, at 180 and 240 °C, respectively. Meanwhile the DME selectivity decreased drastically from 70.9 to 33.9% and methanol selectivity decreased from 21.7 to 11.8% due to a notable CO selectivity increase from 7.4 to 54.3%. The ZZ-M system exhibited the best performance with STY values increasing from 130 to 430 g<small><sub>total<img class="charmap" align="absbottom" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>MeOH</sub></small> kg<small><sub>cat</sub></small><small><sup>−1</sup></small> h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, at 180 and 240 °C, respectively, while the ZZ-G system reached the lowest productivity (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>, entry 11). The best results achieved over the mixed catalyst in comparison to the dual bed system configuration were attributed to the enhanced methanol mass transfer from the methanol catalyst sites to the zeolite acid sites owing to the proximity of the active centres. Grinding was negative because of deterioration of the interaction between the methanol catalyst and zeolite due to strong mechanical stress. The methanol catalyst (ZCZ) structure was damaged favouring the redistribution of Cu over zeolites. In this respect, different strategies have been developed to improve the proximity of the different functionalities. One approach is the co-precipitation of metal oxides in the presence of acid carriers in order to provide hybrid materials with both metal-oxides and acid sites in a single catalyst grain. Accordingly Frusteri and co-workers reported different investigations where the effects of carriers, precipitating agents and the ratio of metal oxides:carrier were studied. They compared the DME productivity achieved in the presence of a physical mixture of the CuZnZr methanol catalyst and a zeolite, and in the presence of a multifunctional system, in which the different active sites were integrated during the gel-oxalate precipitation of the Cu–Zn–Zr precursors in a solution containing dispersed MFI-zeolite.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit535"><sup><span class="sup_ref">535</span></sup></a> In principle, the synthesis of a hybrid system by co-precipitation should maintain the adequate properties of the active sites and enable a higher yield of DME due to the regular and homogeneous distribution, and proximity of the active sites. In the presence of the co-precipitated catalyst, the DME selectivity was higher while the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was practically the same, 15.9% <span class="italic">versus</span> 15.4%. The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was not improved by the proximity of the acid sites that were supposed to shift positively the equilibrium and achieve higher value than for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation into MeOH (18%). Under optimized reaction conditions, 240 °C and 5.0 MPa, maximum CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion of up to 23.6% with lower 24.5% CO selectivity, and therefore higher selectivity to MeOH and DME, 25.5 and 49.3%, were achieved, respectively (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>, entry 12). The authors adopted co-precipitation as a simple method to prepare Cu-based hybrid catalysts, and ensure the presence of the multifunctionality grain-to-grain.</p>
              <p class="otherpara">(ii) <span class="italic">Effect of catalyst preparation on the catalytic activity</span>. It was shown before that co-precipitation resulted in a simple method to prepare Cu-based hybrid catalysts, and ensure the presence of the multifunctionality grain-to-grain.

The characterization study revealed that a balanced distribution of different sites on the catalyst surface became determinant: the strength of basic sites, the ratio between acid and basic sites and the Cu particle sizes were crucial to maximize the catalytic performance and minimize CO selectivity. The CuO–ZnO–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/HZSM-5 system revealed to be a promising catalyst for direct conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into DME.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit534"><sup><span class="sup_ref">534–536</span></sup></a> CuO–ZnO–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/HZSM-5 bifunctional catalysts were generally prepared by physical or mechanical mixing methods.

Nevertheless, these methods present some drawbacks such as the use of metal salts associated with the proton zeolite exchange with both Na and Cu cations. Consequently, the acidic properties of HZSM-5 are reduced, affecting the methanol dehydration step.

The characterization study revealed that reduction of metallic copper surface area, adsorption capacity of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, surface area, and reducibility of CuO were strongly affected by the calcination temperature and the suitable temperature was 300 °C.

            <span>Direct hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in DME is an attractive route considering the environmental and economic issues involved. Efforts are being made to improve the hydrophobic and acid properties of the catalytic surface, and the Cu nanoparticle size and dispersion in order to optimize both methanol dehydration, and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and activation, by controlling the zeolite structure and/or the Si/Al ratio, and/or by incorporating a transition metal. The results showed the importance to balance adequately the acidity of the surface to promote methanol dehydration over strong acid sites. Similarly, the importance of the distance between the two types of active sites, the metal sites for methanol synthesis and the acid sites for methanol dehydration, has been studied. The proximity between the two sites was shown to be crucial to minimize mass transfer restrictions and to improve the DME selectivity, being more convenient to integrate the two types of active sites in a single moiety. Nevertheless, the developed catalysts exhibit limited catalytic performance since low DME selectivity is usually achieved because of high CO production. Moreover, the catalysts suffer from drastic deactivation due to the large amount of water produced during the reaction. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29 and 30</a> illustrate the catalytic performance of the different zeolite-based catalysts reported and highlight the catalytic performance of La–Cu–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5 and Cu–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5 due to the good DME selectivity and productivity.

            <span>Nowadays natural gas constitutes 24% of global primary energy consumption of fuel and it is the third fuel used for power generation, and the main one for heat generation in industry and households.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit563"><sup><span class="sup_ref">563</span></sup></a> Currently, methane can be obtained from natural wells with fossil origin, from purifying biogas obtained by fermentation of organic matter and from the synthetic gas route. In 2022, natural gas reserves account for ∼50 years of current production. In 1872, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation into methane was first discovered by applying an electric discharge to a CO/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixture.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit564"><sup><span class="sup_ref">564</span></sup></a> At the beginning of the twentieth century, Sabatier developed a process to produce methane and water starting from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the presence of a heterogeneous nickel catalyst.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit565"><sup><span class="sup_ref">565</span></sup></a> Since then, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation or CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation, also called the “Sabatier reaction”, has been studied for more than 100 years. Nowadays, because of the increasing demand for natural gas and the reduction of greenhouse gases, the production of synthetic natural gas (SNG) constitutes an important future energy carrier due to its environmentally friendly nature and high calorific value (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a>). Moreover, SNG can be stored and distributed easily thanks to its worldwide existing infrastructure consisting of storage facilities, filling stations, and pipeline networks.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit566"><sup><span class="sup_ref">566–569</span></sup></a> More importantly, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation is one of the most promising strategies within the concept of power-to-gas. Indeed, the main problem found with renewable energy is to adapt the production and demand, as there are situations where the amount of energy produced is greater than the demand when there is for examples excess wind, sun or rain. Then the storage becomes expensive and finally ends up wasting it. Accordingly, the Power-to-Gas (P2G) process is an alternative to adjust this demand since it allows the transfer of excess electricity from renewables from the electricity grid to the natural gas grid. P2G involves the conversion of electricity into thermal energy in the form of methane, and is still an incipient technology. An overview of the production costs of synthetic methane in a P2G process has been recently reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit570"><sup><span class="sup_ref">570</span></sup></a> The production costs depend on three determining economic factors such as the price and market of electricity, the price and market of SNG and the market price of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and the availability. It was so envisioned that with the future expected development of capital and operational expenditure, electricity prices and gas costs, a viable and economic production of synthetic natural gas for the years 2030, especially for 2050, is feasible. The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation process requires H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and for sustainability and environment considerations, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> has to be green. Therefore, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> is obtained from water splitting that requires electric energy produced from green and sustainable sources. Current electrolysis technologies at an industrial scale are alkaline electrolysis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit571"><sup><span class="sup_ref">571</span></sup></a> and proton exchange membrane electrolysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit572"><sup><span class="sup_ref">572</span></sup></a></span>

            <span>Methanation for the production of SNG is a very complicated process and the thermodynamics of the process has to be considered for the evaluation of any proposed technology. Then, numerous studies of thermodynamic equilibrium calculations of complex chemical systems based on Gibbs free energy minimization have been reported, providing information such as the type of thermodynamically stable reaction products together with their selectivity and yield, heat transfer requirements (endothermic or exothermic process) and the impact of reaction parameters (temperature, pressure, or reactant ratios).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit573"><sup><span class="sup_ref">573–575</span></sup></a> CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation is known to be a highly exothermic reaction. However, it is difficult to achieve because of the high kinetic barriers of the eight-electron reduction process. The hydrogenation process starting from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> involves six possible products, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CO, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and C deposited through three independent reactions (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch54">Scheme 54</a>).

              <p class="otherpara">Nickel-based zeolite catalysts exhibit maximum CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> selectivity but suffer from drastic deactivation due to water adsorption on active sites. Therefore, to comply with “Le Chatelier's principle” <span class="italic">in situ</span> removal of water from the reaction sites is required and the use of molecular sieves due to their adsorption properties should be beneficial. Accordingly, a recent study showed the importance of regeneration of the active sites of the catalyst (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab6">Table 6</a>, entry 2).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit617"><sup><span class="sup_ref">617</span></sup></a> The catalytic performances of 5Ni/13X and 5Ni/5A samples were compared for alternated cyclic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation and drying at 300 °C. Better catalytic performance of 5Ni/13X was demonstrated, which is attributed to its higher water adsorption capacity with the optimal catalyst regeneration by a simple drying step under an oxidizing (air) atmosphere which allowed the redispersion of the Ni nanoparticles<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit618"><sup><span class="sup_ref">618</span></sup></a> and improved the catalyst stability.</p>
              <p class="otherpara">Therefore, the development of a robust and successful zeolite-based catalyst is related to three key parameters which are hydrophobicity, nickel nanoparticle size and dispersion, and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and activation.</p>
              <p class="otherpara">In the literature, numerous works have reported the effect of compensating cation exchange on the basic properties of zeolite-based catalysts affecting the adsorption and activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and also on the stabilization and dispersion of Ni nanoparticles that can be additionally modified by adding promoters, the effect of Si/Al ratio on the acid/base properties and the hydrophobicity, and the effect of the structure on the Ni stability and dispersion and also on the hydrophobicity inherent to each zeolite structure.</p>

This is because of the lower water adsorption on the high Si/Al ratio zeolites that lowers the deactivation of the Ni components by water that reduces the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> surface coverage. Moreover, the high Si/Al ratio also improved the dispersion and stability of Ni nanoparticles as it was also described in a recent work.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit625"><sup><span class="sup_ref">625</span></sup></a> Comparison of the catalytic behavior of both zeolite structures showed higher activity for the pure silica ITQ-2 zeolite indicating the crucial effect of the aluminum content and its impact on the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the catalytic surface and nickel particle size and dispersion. 68% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and 99% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> selectivity were achieved at 350 °C (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab6">Table 6</a>, entries 3 and 4).

Indeed the different voids and microenvironments defined by the zeolite topologies are responsible for stabilization and dispersion of metallic active sites.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48,51,87,539,635</span></sup></a> A recent work reported the effect of the zeolite framework type on the catalytic performances of Ni-based catalysts (15 wt%) using commercial USY, BEA, ZSM-5 and MOR zeolites with the Si/Al ratio close to 40 and ion-exchanged with Na<small><sup>+</sup></small> or Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit636"><sup><span class="sup_ref">636</span></sup></a> The zeolites exhibited different particle sizes, and the BEA sample had the smallest particle size, and the intercrystalline space of the BEA sample was responsible for the formation of mesoporosity. TEM analysis revealed that USY, ZSM-5 and MOR samples exhibit similar Ni<small><sup>0</sup></small> particles sizes, while the BEA exhibited higher dispersion and smallest Ni<small><sup>0</sup></small> particles. Even if the zeolites presented a similar Si/Al ratio, their H<small><sup>+</sup></small> exchange capacities were different, leading to distinct alkali and alkali earth compensating cation contents and so diverse CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacities as follows: USY &lt; BEA &lt; ZSM-5 &lt; MOR. The H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPR study demonstrated similar reducibility for USY and BEA samples with a greater amount of NiO reduced at <span class="italic">T</span> &gt; 500 °C, probably due to NiO located in mesopores, and similar reducibility for MOR and ZSM-5 samples with NiO particles mainly located on the external surface. Since the hydrophobicity was established as paramount importance to shift the equilibrium and to avoid the deactivation of active sites, the hydrophobicity index was calculated for the different zeolites and followed the order: USY &gt; MOR &gt; BEA ≈ ZSM-5. Besides these characterization data, the catalytic performances followed the order: 15%Ni/Na-USY &gt; 15%Ni/Na-BEA &gt; 15%Ni/Na-ZSM-5 ≈ 15%Ni/Na-MOR. Thus, taking into account that Ni<small><sup>0</sup></small> particles size, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacity and hydrophobicity are considered key parameters for the design of an efficient zeolite-based catalyst and the catalytic activity order, the authors concluded that the mandatory parameter is the hydrophobicity.

However, the Cs<small><sup>+</sup></small> exchanged sample favoured Ni<small><sup>0</sup></small> dispersion owing to its ability to inhibit the migration path of the nickel species and to suppress the metal agglomeration as commented above. Thus, the dispersion of Ni<small><sup>0</sup></small> particles followed the order BEA &gt; MOR &gt; USY &gt; ZSM-5, while the catalytic activity of the exchanged sample followed the order 15Ni/Cs-USY &gt; 15%Ni/Cs-BEA ≈ 15%Ni/Cs-MOR &gt; 15% &gt; Ni/Cs-ZSM-5. Since the characterization data did not allow supporting the activity order, the authors attributed the best catalytic performance of the USY sample to more favourable metal/support interaction inherent to the zeolite structure. Additionally, a characterization study of textural properties and the catalytic performance of a BEA sample with Si/Al = 243 was performed.

            <span>Among the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation reactions, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation is the most favoured reaction from a thermodynamic point of view.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit679"><sup><span class="sup_ref">679</span></sup></a> However, the development of new catalysts able to perform the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation reaction at lower temperature is still required. The activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is of paramount importance to achieve high methanation activity at lower reaction temperature, and the oxygen mobility and basic properties (strength, number) of the support are key parameters to enhance the adsorption and activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Therefore, the improvement of metal dispersion and reducibility by the addition of promoters, the control of basic properties by cation exchange, the preparation method and the reduction conditions allow optimizing the catalytic performance of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation catalysts. Moreover, the hydrophobicity of the catalyst surface is of paramount importance to limit the water adsorption and avoid the water inhibitory effect on CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig44">Fig. 44</a>). Then, the zeolite framework composition was found to affect strongly the zeolite-based catalyst activity due to important changes in the catalyst–CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and catalyst–H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O interactions. Among the different based-zeolite and OMS catalysts reported, USY based catalysts could present great potential due to the improved stability provided by post synthesis treatments and strong metal/support interaction. For future strategies, it should be particularly important to focus on the morphology of the carrier to improve dispersion, physical isolation and protection of metal species, and mass transfer and also to avoid pore blockage due to coke formation. Therefore, new strategies will consider the use of OMS materials, hierarchical zeolites, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials to promote the amount, dispersion and stabilization of active centers and mass transfer. Moreover, for a better understanding of the active species, the mechanism of the activation and cleavage of C–O (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>), and of the H<small><sub>2</sub></small> activation, and the determination of reaction intermediates, computational modeling and <span class="italic">in situ</span> spectroscopy studies should be fundamental tools for the rational design of efficient and stable catalysts for methanation. From a commercial point of view and industrial applicability, several catalytic processes and reactor technology are available and should be translated to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation since at laboratory scale, high conversion and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> selectivity close to 100% are achieved. However, the viability for large scale CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> fixation also depends on ready availability and price of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> produced from waste and/or renewable sources in order to a develop sustainable process, based on heat produced from renewable (sun, wind) or by nuclear energy to move towards zero carbon footprint.</span>

Since the beginning of the 19th century, the synthesis of higher alcohols (HAS) from syngas has been studied in the presence of Rh- and Mo-based catalysts, and modified Fischer–Tropsch synthesis or methanol synthesis catalysts. From mechanistic standpoints, the HAS can be considered as a combination of Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) and methanol synthesis (MS) pathways. FTS has been defined as a surface polymerization, following a carbide-based reaction pathway where the CO dissociative adsorption produces C species subsequently hydrogenated into alkylmonomers which undergo coupling forming hydrocarbons (HCs) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig46">Fig. 46a</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit689"><sup><span class="sup_ref">689,691,692</span></sup></a> However, this reaction pathway makes this surface polymerization process different as the adding group may be a fragment, rather than a complete molecule, and the growing chain may also have to undergo further reactions before the addition of the next fragment is possible. During MS, CO is adsorbed and hydrogenated to methanol (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig46">Fig. 46b</a>).

            <span>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation to C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH is an attractive process to obtain new building block molecules (olefins from alcohol dehydration) and energy carriers since C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH has higher energy densities, and lower toxicity and corrosiveness than methanol. But, if CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation to C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH has been widely studied in the last decades, very few studies focusing on the development of hydrogenation catalysts based on zeolites or OMS have been reported besides the benefits of confinement effect, nanoparticle stabilization by electronic features and shape-selectivity (reactant, product, and transition state). Accordingly, if the best yield for heterogeneous catalysts has been achieved over the RhFeLi/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalyst with 4.91% C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH yield, maximum 100% ethanol selectivity on the organic product basis has been reached over the Cu@Na-Beta catalyst.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">However, high yield and selectivity of C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH remain a major challenge and could be achieved by <span class="italic">ab initio</span> design of the catalysts, introducing the necessary active sites, which can be rationalized and simulated by computational chemistry. Therefore, additional thorough mechanistic studies, based on operando analysis and characterization of the catalysts, reactants, products and intermediates are required to understand the reaction pathways and the nature of active sites to generate fundamental knowledge. Thus, the selectivity could be improved towards selected alcohol (C<small><sub>2–4</sub></small>), controlling the nature and number of active sites with dissociative, non-dissociative and propagation chain abilities. Actually, up to now, different mechanisms based on products, by-products and intermediate formations detected by DRIFT studies have been proposed and are highly dependent on the catalyst. Moreover, the cost and stability of the catalyst has to be optimized, and the metal choice is of paramount importance. In the case of the few reported works for OMS and zeolite based catalysts, both Cu and Rh exhibited high abilities for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation to C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH, nevertheless, considering catalyst costs, Cu seems more indicated for industrial application. It is clear that zeolites and OMS based catalysts are good candidates for the development of selective and stable catalysts for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation to C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH, and which have so far been under-considered.</p>

            <span>The production of hydrocarbons, aromatics, and olefins <span class="italic">via</span> catalytic hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is an attractive route to produce fuels (C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>) and pave the way to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> circularity. In comparison to C<small><sub>1</sub></small> products, C<small><sub>2+</sub></small> products possess higher energy densities. Light olefins such as ethylene, propylene, and butylene are the top-produced petrochemicals worldwide and constitute important raw materials for the chemical industry and the production of plastics, fibers, and chemicals. They are generally produced through the hydrocracking of hydrocarbons of fossil sources under high temperature. Aromatics also constitute important platform chemicals for the synthesis of petrochemicals, polymers, and medicines. They are usually produced by oil thermal cracking and naphtha reforming. The alternative strategy to produce gasoline, olefins and aromatics from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is an important way to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, develop new sustainable routes for the production of value-added chemicals and reduce dependence on fossil sources (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig52">Fig. 52</a>).</span>

            <p class="otherpara">The main drawback for C<small><sub>2+</sub></small> hydrocarbon production is the kinetic barriers for C–C coupling.

            <p class="otherpara">RWGS is an endothermic process, whereas the FTS reaction is exothermic, which makes the RWGS-FTS tandem thermodynamically favorable (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch56">Scheme 56</a>). Thus, the equilibrium of the RWGS reaction can be shifted due to the consumption of CO by the FTS for hydrocarbon production. Similarly, for the methanol-mediated route, the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to methanol is exothermic and thermodynamically limited at high temperature, and kinetically limited at low temperature. However, the combination of methanol synthesis with conversion to hydrocarbons allows shifting the equilibrium due to methanol consumption.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Different catalysts (metals, metal oxides, metal carbides, MOFs, and zeolites) that have been applied for the synthesis of hydrocarbons from synthesis gas or methanol to olefins or aromatics (MTO/MTA) have also been tested for the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to hydrocarbons <span class="italic">via</span> the tandem process. Different strategies have been followed to optimize the catalytic properties and reaction conditions to enhance CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> activation, decrease the energy barrier for C–C coupling and minimize the CO and methane yields. Therefore, the effects of the addition of alkali promoters, addition of iron to enhance CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and increase the surface CO/H<small><sub>2</sub></small> ratio, addition of a second metal to improve strong interactions between the support and active phase and modify the electronic environment of active species, the modification of acid–base properties, for example to weaken the secondary hydrogenation ability of olefins or to avoid undesirable alkylation and isomerization have been explored.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Usually, hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> over Fe and Co based catalysts produces CO as the intermediates while over Cu/Zn catalysts methanol is the main intermediate. Only Fe, Co, Ni, and Ru of group VIII exhibit sufficiently high activities for the hydrogenation of CO to warrant their use as effective FT catalysts and among them, only Co- and Fe-based catalysts may be considered as practical FT catalysts, while Fe-based catalysts remain the preferred for commercial FT synthesis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit712"><sup><span class="sup_ref">712</span></sup></a></p>

This last result was attributed to 10 MR pore openings with a lamellar structure consisting of two independent pore systems of the MWW structure with demonstrated catalytic properties for isomerization, alkylation and disproportionation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit720"><sup><span class="sup_ref">720</span></sup></a> Additionally, a study of the adequate distance of the different active sites showed the effects over the selectivity of hydrocarbon products. When Na–Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> and HZSM-5 powders were mixed, the closest proximity of iron-based sites and acid sites led to the acid site poisoning by Na. However, when Na–Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> and HZSM-5 were combined by granule mixing, the adequate distance between iron-based and zeolite acid sites allowed the formation of olefin intermediates on iron-based sites and its diffusion through the pores of the zeolite towards the acid sites, where oligomerization, isomerization and aromatization reactions occurred. Therefore, maximum 73% C<small><sub>5</sub></small>–C<small><sub>11</sub></small> selectivity at 34% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was achieved. Nevertheless, when the hydrogenation process was carried out in the dual-bed configuration with HZSM-5 packed below Na–Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> and separated by a thin layer of inert quartz sand, lower 67% C<small><sub>5</sub></small>–C<small><sub>11</sub></small> selectivity (67%) at 34% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion were reached and attributed to the larger distance of active sites.</p>

              <span>The selective hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to gasoline and olefins has been successfully explored and achieved. Nevertheless, the selective hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to aromatics remains challenging due to the high unsaturation degree and complex structures of aromatics.</span>
              <p class="otherpara">Recently, an attempt of conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to aromatics in the presence of a bifunctional catalyst comprising nano-scaled spinel structural ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> and H-ZSM-5 was reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit728"><sup><span class="sup_ref">728</span></sup></a> A characterization study was performed to determine the active sites and the combination mode of both catalysts. The TPR results showed that both ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> and ZnO can be hardly reduced by H<small><sub>2</sub></small> below 430 °C and 7% less zinc oxides could be reduced above 730 °C. Therefore, it was concluded that Zn<small><sup>2+</sup></small> is responsible for the activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation. The IR study of absorption of DTBPy (2,6-di-<span class="italic">tert</span>-butyl-pyridine absorption) to investigate the external surface Brønsted acid sites that are able to catalyze the hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to paraffins and not to aromatics revealed that the characteristic bands at 3365, 1614 and 1531 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> disappeared after mixing, grinding and pressing under high pressure with ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>. These results indicate that the external Brønsted acids of H-ZSM-5 are blocked by ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> after mixing, which is beneficial for the aromatization process, and which was demonstrated by the catalytic performance recorded with different combinations of both ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> and H-ZMSM-5 catalysts (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig63">Fig. 63</a>). The aromatics or C<small><sub>2–4</sub></small> olefin selectivity follows the order ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>&amp;H-ZSM-5 &gt; ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> + H-ZSM-5 &gt; ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/H-ZSM-5, in contrast to C<small><sub>2–4</sub></small> paraffin selectivity that follows the opposite order. Therefore, when CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation was performed over ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>&amp;H-ZSM-5 a high aromatics selectivity of 73.9% with low 0.4% methane selectivity was achieved.

The proposed mechanism involves the formation of methanol and dimethyl ether by hydrogenation of formate species formed on the ZnAlO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> surface, which diffuse to H-ZSM-5 at acid sites where they are successively converted to olefins and aromatics.</p>

              <p class="otherpara">Previously, direct CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was carried out over the ZnZrO/ZSM-5 bifunctional catalyst.

              <p class="otherpara">The main drawback of the direct conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to aromatics is the high CO selectivity (&gt;40%) produced by the RWGS reaction.

The Cu-MCM-41 catalyst exhibited the best catalytic properties for the RWGS with maximum CO selectivity at 550 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit772"><sup><span class="sup_ref">772</span></sup></a> The Co-MCM-41 and Ni–MCM-41 materials exhibited high catalytic activity although these exhibited lower CO selectivities, 95 and 70%, respectively (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab10">Table 10</a>, entries 4–7). Fe-KIT-6 prepared by direct hydrothermal synthesis with different Fe loadings showed well-ordered cubic structures and its structural integrity was preserved for Si/Fe ratios up to 10.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit773"><sup><span class="sup_ref">773</span></sup></a> The characterization of the Fe-KIT-6 sample (Si/Fe = 30) by EPR and XPS spectroscopies showed that Fe was present as a tetrahedrally coordinated iron atom in the KIT-6 framework, although the presence of extra-framework species/small iron oxide clusters could not be discarded. The Fe-KIT-6 sample with a higher Fe content exhibited the best catalytic performance for the RWGS reaction being the rate of hydrogenation a direct function of the amount of iron active sites and the reaction temperature, so a high iron content favoured methanation. Therefore, 97% CO selectivity at low 16% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion was reached at 500 °C over Fe-KIT-6 (Si/Fe = 10) (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab10">Table 10</a>, entry 8).</span>

            <span>The production of CO from the RWGS is a very attractive process due to its use as a building block for the synthesis of chemicals and hydrocarbons from Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, always considering the use of anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and green and renewable hydrogen. The main issue is the co-production of methane. It is crucial to make the RWGS catalysts 100% CO selective for commercialization, as an increase in hydrogen consumption will make the process more expensive, will require a subsequent separation process and will also affect the carbon footprint. In the few last decades, numerous studies on the RWGS using, specially, supported metals, have been carried out. The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and CO desorption appear key factors for enhancing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and CO selectivity. Nevertheless, new efforts are still required to determine the reaction mechanism and find the working active sites to finally establish the structure–activity/selectivity relationship. Therefore, computational modeling and <span class="italic">in situ</span> spectroscopy studies will be fundamental tools for the rational design of efficient and highly selective catalysts for the RWGS. In the present review, a short compilation of works showed that the potential of ordered microporous and mesoporous materials has been scarcely considered and undervalued. The studies described present strategies to maximize CO selectivity and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, improving the metal–support interaction and stability, potentially through the incorporation of a promoter (alkali, second metal), increasing the oxygen mobility generating oxygen vacancies owing to the presence of reducible transition metal oxide or maximizing the dispersion and stability of metal nanoparticles by enveloping within the zeolite pore channel system. Enhancement of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption/activation and fast and easy CO desorption are key steps to consider for the design of new RWGS catalysts and catalyst issues. In addition, future studies will focus on the catalyst deactivation mechanism in order to improve the stability of catalysts for the RWGS. Undoubtedly, the unique properties of zeolites and OMSs as supports to confine, disperse and stabilize metal species due to their pore structure and high surface area make them attractive supports for the development of RWGS catalysts. The benefits of the support morphology and pore topology to enhance the dispersion and attachment of metal species should be fundamental. Therefore, future studies should focus on hierarchical zeolites, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials to promote the physical isolation and protection of particles as well as mass transfer.</span>

            <span>The catalytic dry reforming of methane into synthesis gas (H<small><sub>2</sub></small> + CO) is a very attractive CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion since it makes possible the simultaneous mitigation of two important greenhouse gases, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig77">Fig. 77</a>). DRM is a 100% atom efficiency process and provides a highly regarded H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio of 1 for further industrial conversion such as Fischer–Tropsch and other valuable chemicals (methanol). However, in practice, DRM requires high energy consumption due to the very endothermic character of the reaction. Moreover, the high temperatures required by the process induce a rapid deactivation of the catalyst due to sintering of the metal and severe coke deposition. So far, the rapid deactivation of the catalyst together with the high energy use constitutes the biggest obstacle to the development of an environmentally friendly industrial application to date. Therefore, the design of a robust and efficient catalyst at “low temperatures” is topical and very challenging.</span>

            <span>DRM is highly endothermic and a high temperature is required to reach high thermodynamic conversions. Hence, for an industrial implementation, renewable energy sources must be considered in order to achieve an economically and environmentally sustainable process. Simultaneously, the RWGS can take place and decrease the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio to a lower value than an ideal ratio of 1. However, the main drawback remains the strong deactivation of the catalyst because of coke deposition originated mainly from methane decomposition (cracking) and CO disproportionation (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig78">Fig. 78</a>). A study based on the standard free energy change determines that DRM occurs above 640 °C and the RWGS above 840 °C, while coke formation by methane cracking takes place from 557 °C and coke formation by CO disproportionation (the Boudouard reaction) is inhibited above 710 °C due to high exothermicity.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit794"><sup><span class="sup_ref">794–796</span></sup></a> Therefore, at a temperature of &gt;800 °C, superficial carbon species are issued from CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> cracking, and can be easily oxidized by CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, limiting the formation of coke (route 2, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig79">Fig. 79</a>).

Over the last 30 years, DRM studies have shown that Ni catalysts are the most suitable candidates for industrial implementation owing to their low cost and availability in comparison to noble metal (Pt, Ru, and Rh) based catalysts.

After 6 h TOS, at 650 °C, 71% and 54% of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions and 71.2% and 56.3% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions were obtained over Ni/USY and Ni/ZSM-5, respectively (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab11">Table 11</a>, entries 5–7). Later on, another study of the catalytic activities of the Ni/γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>, Ni/Y, and Ni/H-ZSM-5 samples prepared by impregnation, with the 5 wt% Ni content, confirmed the dependence of the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversion on the support.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit824"><sup><span class="sup_ref">824</span></sup></a> However, a different stability order of the Ni-based catalysts was established: Ni/H-ZSM-5 &gt; Ni/γ-Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> &gt; Ni/Y. The best catalytic data were obtained over Ni/H-ZSM-5 with a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio close to 1 owing to the lower carbon deposition registered and the higher stability of the textural properties of the catalyst (BET area). High CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions were achieved over all the Ni catalysts, close to 80% with a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio close to 1 along 9 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab11">Table 11</a>, entries 8–10). The very stable MOR was compared with FAU, both with a 2.5–3 wt% Ni content.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit825"><sup><span class="sup_ref">825</span></sup></a> The MOR based catalysts exhibited the better catalytic performance in terms of conversion and stability (Ni/HMOR &gt; Ni/NaMOR &gt; Ni/HY). At 750 °C, for 24 h TOS, 92% and 87% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions and 86% and 75% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions were achieved over Ni/H-MOR and Ni/NaMOR, respectively (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab11">Table 11</a>, entries 11–14). The data of CO, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO were not provided. The mixing Ni/H-MOR and Ni/NaMOR and Ni/HY with Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> allowed improving the stability of the catalyst by reducing coke deposition.</p>

              <p class="otherpara">These comparative studies evidenced the potential of zeolites as the support for the design of DRM catalysts. Nevertheless, short-term experiments were performed indicating low catalytic stability. Different strategies were reported to improve the robustness of the zeolite based catalysts and the preparation method, metal doping, and modification of the basicity or morphology have been studied. MFI zeolites were the most support used for the design and development of DRM catalysts while other zeolite structures have been investigated more occasionally being the use of FAU more common.</p>

              <p class="otherpara">* <span class="italic">ZSM-5 as the support for the preparation of DRM catalysts.</span> ZSM-5 has been widely used as the support for DRM catalysts due to its easy synthesis within a wide range of compositions. Recently, the hierarchical ZSM-5 zeolite with micropores and mesopores was impregnated with Ni and used for DRM. The data of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions and the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio revealed that a sample with Si/Al = 30 exhibited the highest catalytic performance, at 800 °C. The maximum 98% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and 95% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions with a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio close to 0.9 were maintained for 30 h (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab11">Table 11</a>, entry 15).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit826"><sup><span class="sup_ref">826</span></sup></a> These results were attributed to the acid strength and crystallinity of the ZSM-5 structure. Samples with lower acidity exhibited lower catalytic activity and showed lower crystallinity and BET area. In addition to high catalytic performance, the Ni/ZSM-5(30) micro-mesoporous sample exhibited high stability and resistance to coke deposition, with no-deactivation registered after 30 h TOS. For all samples, the same tendency was observed, and due to the endothermicity of DRM, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio increased when the temperature increased.</p>
              <p class="otherpara">– <span class="italic">Effect of the preparation method of Ni/ZSM-5-based catalysts for DRM</span>. The activity and stability of DRM catalysts strongly depend on Ni nanoparticle dispersion and metal–support interactions, which in turn influence metal sintering and coke resistance. Therefore, the preparation method constitutes an important strategy to control the metal location, deposition and dispersion. The benefits of the chemical and physical effects of high intensity ultrasound for the synthesis of metal supported nanoparticle catalysts and nanomaterials have shown to minimize the metal particle size, improve the distribution and dispersion of the particles, and enhance the catalytic features.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit827"><sup><span class="sup_ref">827–829</span></sup></a> Following this strategy, the sonochemical method was applied to the preparation of Ni/ZSM-5 with different Ni contents (3–20 wt%).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit830"><sup><span class="sup_ref">830</span></sup></a> The characterization data showed that the ZSM-5 crystallinity decreased slightly upon Ni incorporation.

The TPR study indicated a shift to a lower temperature of NiO reduction for higher Ni contents for monometallic samples. This result was attributed to the formation of nickel species with a larger particle size, with a small interface with the support, and a weak NiO/support interaction that make nickel oxide easy to be reduced. Therefore, the larger the particle size, the lower the reduction temperature. On the other hand, the presence of a small amount of Pt in Ni catalysts evidenced the easier reduction of NiO, probably because Pt is reduced first and activates hydrogen which favours the reduction of NiO by spill over. Moreover, the improved coke resistance of Pt promoted Ni catalysts was attributed to the formation of Pt–Ni particles covered mainly by Ni, leading to high Ni particle dispersion and the formation of a higher amount of active carbon species further oxidized into CO. Thus, at a low reaction temperature (600 °C), modest 28% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and 69% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions were achieved (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab11">Table 11</a>, entries 31 and 32).

Catalytic dry reforming of methane is an important strategy to mitigate the emissions of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> greenhouse gases. Ni based-zeolite catalysts owing to the huge properties of zeolites such as the high surface area and thermal stability offer opportunities for the preparation of DRM catalysts. Moreover, different strategies have been reported to improve the dispersion and stabilization of nickel particles by the addition of a suitable second metal (promoter), enabling the establishment of new electronic metal/metal and metal/support interactions that enhance the NiO reducibility and coke resistance owing to the oxidation of carbon species deposited on the Ni particle surface, or by the control of acidity/basicity through the incorporation of alkali metal promoting CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and activation (C–O cleavage). Thus, great opportunities for the development of robust catalysts based on zeolites have been reported and the results summarised in the <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab11">Table 11</a> illustrate the high activity of zeolite-based catalysts for the DRM reaction at high temperatures.

              <span>Different strategies have been followed to improve the catalytic properties, robustness and stability of Ni based catalysts towards Ni sintering and coke deposition, such as the incorporation of noble metals and transition metals to enhance the reducibility and dispersion of Ni, or of alkali and alkaline earth metals to create basic sites enhancing the adsorption and activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (C–O cleavage), or the confinement of nanoparticles inside hollow, core–shell or mesoporous structures. Accordingly, OMSs have been explored as supports, especially to control the nanoparticle size, dispersion and stability owing to the high surface area and controllable pore size providing the beneficial spatial confinement effect to prevent Ni particle sintering. Recently, a study of the role of the pore size and the wall thickness of a series of mesoporous structures including MCM-41, KIT-6 and SBA-15 over the activity of Ni-catalysts prepared by the impregnation method for DRM was reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit913"><sup><span class="sup_ref">913</span></sup></a> The results indicated that small pore diameters and thin silica walls of MCM-41 were responsible for lower catalytic performance due to low ability to prevent Ni sintering. Thus, Ni–MCM-41 exhibited the lower activity in comparison to Ni-SBA-15 and Ni-KIT-6 (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 1–3). Previously, a comparative study of Ni supports over OMS and zeolites showed that CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions were dependent on Ni particle average size that was controlled by the high specific area of the support, strong metal–support interaction and metal reducibility.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit914"><sup><span class="sup_ref">914</span></sup></a> Thus, larger Ni particles (23–29 nm) were preferentially obtained from more readily reduced Ni owing to the weaker interaction with the zeolite support. In contrast, smaller Ni particles (9–11 nm) were formed from slowly reduced Ni due to the strong interaction with the SBA-15 and Al-MCM-41 supports through Ni–O–Si or Ni–Al bonds. Moreover, smaller particles exhibited a higher sintering resistance and the formation of filamentous coke did not induce catalytic deactivation. Filamentous carbon deposition was observed by SEM and from DTG profiles, with amount increasing in the following order Ni/Al-MCM-41 &gt; Ni/SBA-15 &gt; Ni/MFI and negligible for Ni/FAU. At 750 °C, over Ni/Al-MCM-41 and Ni/MFI, 94 and 70–60% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions and 93 and 65–55% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions were achieved, respectively, along 12 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 4–7). These results showed the higher physicochemical properties exhibited by OMSs than those by zeolites to the support and disperse metallic active sites, and design and develop robust and efficient DRM catalysts.</span>

              <p class="otherpara">* <span class="italic">Effect of the preparation method of Ni/SBA-15-based catalysts for DRM</span>. The preparation method of Ni supported catalysts can strongly affect the metal dispersion, particle size and interaction with the support. Therefore, different methods have been reported with the aim to improve the dispersion and stability of metal nanoparticles and favour the strong metal–support interaction. Recently, the catalytic behavior of previously prepared Ni nanoparticles with a homogeneous size of ∼5 nm and further supported on ordered mesoporous silica (SBA-15), alumina and commercial silica was described.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit916"><sup><span class="sup_ref">916</span></sup></a> The characterization and catalytic data revealed that the ordered mesoporous structures were more suitable to stabilize Ni nanoparticles due to the beneficial confinement effects preventing nanoparticle aggregation. The presence of Lewis acid sites in the case of the alumina support was responsible for higher coke formation at a lower temperature. Ni/SBA-15 with 1 wt% Ni exhibited the best catalytic properties. A study of the reaction temperature revealed that 800 °C was the optimum temperature to perform DRM avoiding the strong aggregation phenomenon of Ni nanoparticles that took place at 850 °C. Indeed, at 800 and 850 °C, 91.4 and 45.9% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions, 91 and 70% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions were reached with 0.79 and 0.97 H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratios, respectively, over Ni/SBA-15 (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 9–12). The use of organic solvents as dispersants and stabilizing agents for the preparation of supported metallic nanoparticles has been recently developed. The use of ethylene glycol (EG) to support Ni (11 wt%) on SBA-15 as the solvent and the delivery conveyor of the Ni precursor inside the SBA-15 pore systems was first described in 2014.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit917"><sup><span class="sup_ref">917</span></sup></a> The resulting catalyst exhibited improved coke and sintering resistances owing to the confinement effect of SBA-15 and smaller Ni nanoparticles. At 750 °C, 96% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and 87% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions with a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio of ∼1 were maintained over Ni/SBA-15-EG along 20 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 13 and 14). Later, EG was newly used as the solvent and the delivery conveyor to study the spatial confinement effect of SBA-15 walls over Ni/SBA-15 physicochemical and catalytic features.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit918"><sup><span class="sup_ref">918</span></sup></a> High dispersion of Ni nanoparticles (7 wt%) with a small particle size (∼3.1 nm) embedded into the Al-SBA-15 mesostructure was successfully achieved. The comparison of the catalytic behavior of Ni/SBA-15 catalysts revealed that the sample prepared with EG exhibited better catalytic activity. Moreover, a study of catalytic stability showed that Al conferred higher hydrothermal stability to the Ni/Al-SBA-15-EG catalyst and potential for the prolonged use under harsh conditions. The benefit of the confinement effect to prevent sintering was demonstrated with average Ni particle sizes of 3.2 and 3.6 nm for fresh and spent catalysts, respectively. At 700 °C, 70 and 72% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions and 79% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion were achieved over Ni/SBA-15-EG and Ni/Al-SBA-15-EG, with 0.91 and 0.95 H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratios, respectively, along 15 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 15–17). The effect of different impregnation techniques (impregnation (IM), rotary evaporator- (RE), shaker (SH) and ultrasounds (US)) for the preparation of 3 wt% Ni/SBA-15 catalysts from waste POFA (palm oil fuel ash) over their catalytic and physicochemical properties was recently investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit919"><sup><span class="sup_ref">919</span></sup></a> The characterization and catalytic data revealed that the impregnation method influenced the Ni particle size and dispersion, and interaction with the support through the formation of Si–O–Ni bonds (FTIR spectra) with the following order of the Ni-support interaction for Ni/SBA-15 samples: RE &lt; SH &lt; IM &lt; US. The basicity distribution of the Ni-containing mesoporous catalysts determined by CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPD evidenced three peaks with different temperature regions, indicating three types of basic active sites for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption on the catalyst surface with different strengths (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig90">Fig. 90</a>). The Ni/SBA-15 sample prepared by impregnation under ultrasound exhibited the higher amount of strong basic sites. Finally, the catalytic study showed that the activity and stability varied with the preparation method in the following order: US &gt; IM &gt; SH &gt; RE. Ultrasounds showed to provide the catalysts with a smaller Ni particle size with good dispersion and stronger interactions with the support responsible for the higher catalytic activity and resistance to Ni sintering and coke deposition of the 3 wt% Ni/SBA-15(US) sample. Thus, 80% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and 95–90% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions with a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio of 0.89 were maintained over 24 h TOS at 800 °C in the presence of the 3 wt% Ni/SBA-15(US) catalyst (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 18–21).</p>

              <p class="otherpara">On the other hand, the impact of homogeneous precipitation (HP) and impregnation (imp) preparation methods over the catalytic performance of Ni/SBA-15 samples was also compared.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit920"><sup><span class="sup_ref">920</span></sup></a> The characterization results revealed high dispersion and a small size (2–5 nm) of Ni nanoparticles and improved NiO reducibility owing to the strong metal–support interaction with improved sintering resistance. Consequently, the catalytic results showed the better catalytic performance of Ni/SBA-15(HP) than that of Ni/SBA-15(imp). At 800 °C and 100 h TOS, good and stable 74% and 80% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO up to 0.9 were achieved over Ni/SBA-15(HP) and with certain amount of filamentous coke deposition (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 22 and 23). Previously, the influence of the three Ni/SBA-15 preparation methods, impregnation (IM), precipitation (PM) and precipitation-reduction with ascorbic acid (RM), over their physicochemical and catalytic properties was investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit921"><sup><span class="sup_ref">921</span></sup></a> The characterization data revealed that confined and small Ni particle sizes (∼5 nm) were obtained through PM and RM methods, while through the IM route, Ni was mainly present on the outer support surface with worst dispersion and a higher particle size (∼12 nm). Moreover, different Ni-active phases were dispersed and Ni-species met in the IM sample are NiO species, and those met in the PM sample are only phyllosilicate species, while in the RM sample both phyllosilicate species and NiO-species are met. During the DRM process, the IM catalyst suffered rapid deactivation, while PM and RM catalysts exhibited improved stability, and the PM catalyst showed slightly higher activity and selectivity than the RM sample, resulting in a higher H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio (0.87). Thus, 8 wt% Ni/SBA-15(RM) exhibited higher catalytic performance with stable 65% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and 90% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions, at 600 °C, over 24 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 24–26). Moreover, lower coke deposition in the form of filamentous carbon was formed, closed to 11 wt% for the RM catalyst while 46 wt% was formed over the IM catalyst inducing severe deactivation. The effect of the use of different chelating agents such as ethylene diamine (en), acetic (ace) and citric (cit) acids and without (conventional (cm)) to prepare Ni/SBA-15 by impregnation over Ni dispersion and nanoparticle size was recently examined.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit922"><sup><span class="sup_ref">922</span></sup></a> The benefits of electron-pair donor atoms (O, N) of ligands such as ethylenediamine and citric acid, which possess two and three electron-pair donor atoms respectively, able to form a chelate ring with a single metal with strong steric hindrance, in contrast to citric acid that will always give rise to a multimetal ring structure favourable to metal agglomeration, were shown. Moreover, the viscosity of the chelated metal solution is higher than the solution of inorganic salts, reducing the evaporation of the solvent that prevents the agglomeration of metal particles. Therefore, the assisted chelating agent impregnation method allowed preparing catalysts with highly dispersed and ultrafine Ni nanoparticles (4–6 nm) and with the improved coke deposition resistance. At 800 °C, all the samples initially exhibited high activity while the stability test, over 50 h TOS, showed that samples issued from the modified impregnation method exhibited higher and stable activity with good CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions up to 85% and 80%, respectively (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 27–31). The characterisation data determined a coke formation of less than 10–20 wt% for the catalysts prepared in the presence of the chelating agent, while 40 wt% coke was analysed for the sample prepared by the conventional method.</p>
              <p class="otherpara">Ni nanoparticle deposition through the conventional impregnation method is usually controlled by diffusion and by bulk oxide type formation with the weak metal–support interaction. Consequently, the resistance to sintering of Ni nanoparticles is low. As an alternative, a new ammonia evaporation (AE) method was developed where the solvated metal precursor by ammonia is dispersed over the surface of the support which is in suspension in aqueous solution and a subsequent heating evaporates ammonia leading to the hydrolysis of the metal–ammonia complex. Following this synthetic route, the Ni/SBA-15 catalyst was prepared and the catalytic performance checked and compared to the results obtained in the presence of a sample prepared by the conventional impregnation method.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit923"><sup><span class="sup_ref">923</span></sup></a> Therefore, a smaller Ni particle size from 3.05 to 5.17 nm, higher dispersion and homogeneously distribution with an average diameter of 4.09 nm inside the mesopores were obtained following the described AE method, leading to the strong metal–support interaction. Then, a higher metal/support interaction allows achieving the metal with a smaller particle size. In contrast, the broad range of a particle size from 2.47 to 17.1 nm were obtained for the Ni/SBA-15(IM) sample prepared by impregnation. Therefore, even if both catalysts exhibited high initial activity, they showed different stabilities along 100 h TOS. The Ni/SBA-15(AE) catalyst displayed high coke deposition and sintering resistance owing to strong metal–support interactions. Thus, at 750 °C, 75% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and 80% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions were maintained over Ni/SBA-15(AE) over 100 h TOS with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO close to 0.85 (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>, entries 32–35).

SBA-15 due to its high surface area and thermal stability is of interest to prepare Ni-based catalysts for the DRM process making use of the confinement effect of its mesopore system, and numerous works have been published.

              <p class="otherpara">* <span class="italic">Preparation of bimetallic Ni/MCM-41-based catalysts for DRM</span>. Suitable metal doping could be a key to improve both the metal particle size and dispersion by establishing metal–metal and metal active phase/support interactions. Consequently, metal sintering and catalyst coke resistances should be enhanced. Moreover, the modification of surface basicity would improve the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and dissociation unfavouring the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> adsorption and decomposition, promoting CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissociation and the release of active oxygen species to boost the gasification of adsorbed carbon species.</p>
              <p class="otherpara">Numerous papers disclosing different metal doping impacts of DRM catalysts have been published. For instance, a study of the benefits of Ga-doping over catalytic and textural features of 5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 showed an optimum Ga content, close to 2 wt% to maximise the catalytic performance and stability.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit952"><sup><span class="sup_ref">952</span></sup></a> Due to metal doping, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPR profiles revealed that the reduction of nickel shifted at higher temperatures which was attributed to the strong metal–support interaction that improved Ni particle dispersion and low Ni particle size. A decrease in the amount of medium and strong basic sites was observed when increasing Ga loading, which was attributed to the formation of extra-framework acid sites. For Ga content &lt;3 wt%, the catalytic results of the Ga-doped 5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 sample were superior to those of the un-doped sample and a maximum was observed for 2 wt% Ga–5 wt% Ni/MCM-41. High 90–85% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and 88–83% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversions, for H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO close to 1 and 50% H<small><sub>2</sub></small> selectivity, were achieved at 800 °C along 30 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab13">Table 13</a>, entry 6). Moreover, the doped catalyst exhibited higher resistance to coke deposition and Ni sintering. The Sc doping effect over 5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 physicochemical properties demonstrated that Sc loading induced a decrease in the surface area and catalytic activity of 5%Ni/MCM-41 catalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit953"><sup><span class="sup_ref">953</span></sup></a> While Sc loading &lt;1 wt% enabled an increase in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion up to 38% for the 0.1 wt% Sc content. The presence of Sc small amount favoured the strong interaction between the metal and the support leading to higher dispersion of Ni nanoparticles and also increased the surface basicity. Therefore, enhanced CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and activation led to the presence of a high amount of active oxygen species promoting the oxidation of carbon species and lowering coke deposition. At 800 °C, the best catalytic performance was achieved over the 0.1 wt% Sc–5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 catalyst, achieving stable and high 87% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and 85% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions with a H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio of 0.94 and a H<small><sub>2</sub></small> yield close to 86%, along short 7 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab13">Table 13</a>, entries 7–9). Years ago, the impact of the incorporation of different transition metals (Zr, Ti, and Mn) into the silica framework over the catalytic and textural properties of Ni/MCM-41 samples prepared by the hydrothermal method was explored.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit954"><sup><span class="sup_ref">954</span></sup></a> The characterization data disclosed that higher Ni dispersion was achieved for Zr-doping in contrast to Ti- and Mn-doping. XRD patterns evidenced the presence of the amorphous silica matrix for Ni–Ti/and Ni–Mn/MCM-41 spent catalysts, suggesting that the Ti and Mn incorporations worsen the thermal stability of the MCM-41 silica support. In contrast, the presence of Zr cations in the framework stabilizes the MCM-41 structure. The catalytic performance of Zr-doped Ni/MCM-41 catalysts was similar or superior to the catalytic activity of the Ni/MCM-41 catalyst. In contrast, the decoration of Ni particles by TiOx and MnOx for Ti- and Mn-based Ni/MCM-41 catalysts hindered the accessibility to Ni-active centers and lowered their catalytic performance. Accordingly, Zr doped catalysts exhibited higher activity and stability and were maximum over 1 wt% Zr–2 wt% Ni/MCM-41, with maintained 92% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversion, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio close to 0.95, at 750 °C over 72 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab13">Table 13</a>, entries 10–13). However, neither any data of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion nor H<small><sub>2</sub></small> or CO selectivity were reported. A Gd doping study of 5 wt% Ni/MCM-41 prepared by the co-impregnation method revealed the improvement of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and activation through the Gd<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>CO<small><sub>3</sub></small> species formation similar to La<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>2</sub></small>CO<small><sub>3</sub></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig81">Fig. 81</a>) preventing coke deposition and also enhancing Ni reducibility.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit955"><sup><span class="sup_ref">955</span></sup></a> Over the 0.1 wt% Gd-promoted catalyst, high 88% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and 92% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO close to 1 were maintained over short 6.5 h TOS while carbon deposition was negligible (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab13">Table 13</a>, entries 14–17). The catalytic performance of Ni/MCM-41 catalysts doped with Ru and Mg by impregnation showed that Ru incorporation improved the activity and stability of Ni/MCM-41 catalysts, being maximum H<small><sub>2</sub></small> selectivity achieved over 1 wt% Ru@Ni/MCM-41, while Mg doping enhanced the 1 wt% Ru@Ni–MCM-41 catalytic performance increasing the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> conversion and limiting the RWGS reaction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit956"><sup><span class="sup_ref">956</span></sup></a> However, low 31% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and 37% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO &lt; 1 were achieved at 600 °C after 4 h of TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab13">Table 13</a>, entries 18–23). The TGA revealed coke formation with a high weight loss for all samples (45–65%) that did not particularly affected the catalytic activity of the catalyst over 4 h TOS, but induced the blockage of a reactor at longer 7 h TOS. The same group previously described a similar study of the preparation and catalytic performance of Ni/MCM-41 samples doped with Rh.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit957"><sup><span class="sup_ref">957</span></sup></a> Mono- and bimetallic MCM-41 catalysts were prepared either by Rh impregnation (Rh@Ni–MCM-41) or by one-pot hydrothermal synthesis (Rh–Ni/MCM-41). The optimum 0.19 Ni/Si ratio was determined achievieng low 31% CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and 41% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversions for 14 h at 600 °C (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab13">Table 13</a>, entries 24–29). The Rh incorporation was shown to improve the catalytic activity and stability. However, the catalyst prepared by the impregnation method suffered higher coke deposition at longer reaction times. Earlier, a comparative study of the catalytic behavior of monometallic 20 wt% Ni/MCM-41 and bimetallic Pd–20 wt% Ni/MCM-41 samples demonstrated the promoting effect of Pd-doping on the activity and stability of 20 wt% Ni/MCM-41 catalysts owing to the synergetic effect between Ni and Pd improving Ni nanoparticle dispersion and reducibility.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit958"><sup><span class="sup_ref">958</span></sup></a> At 650 °C, over 0.3 wt% Pd–20 wt% Ni/MCM-41, the best catalytic results were achieved and maintained for 10 h TOS.

              <p class="otherpara">(iii) <span class="italic">Conclusion</span>. The main drawback of DRM is the high temperature required due to the endothermicity of the process, which not only results in high energy consumption that is not economically and environmentally sustainable, but is also incompatible with the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions. Therefore, any industrial application must foresee the exclusive consumption of heat produced from renewable (sun, wind, and water) or nuclear sources. In addition to the high energy cost, the rapid deactivation of the catalyst must be overcome. The present review illustrates the high activity of the Ni-based zeolite and OMS catalysts, despite deactivation due to Ni sintering and coke deposition which, in turn, can plug the reactor in long-term tests. Thus, numerous attempts have been made to improve Ni-catalyst stability minimizing metal particle sizes, and improving metal dispersion and reducibility. The use of the high surface area support and second or multi metal-doping constitutes the main strategies, improving the metal–support interaction and modifying acid–base and redox properties. Thus, zeolites and OMSs offer opportunities for the development of the robust and efficient DRM catalyst. Unfortunately, most of the here referenced works remained far from an industrial implementation since the studies lack of the long-term stability test, catalytic regeneration study, and the process were performed at a high temperature (&gt;750 °C) with catalytic performance close to thermodynamic equilibrium. The small pore size system of zeolites compared to mesoporous materials may be a weakness to reach a high dispersion of small metal nanoparticles and probably more prone to pore blockage due to metal sintering and/or coke deposition. Hence, the collection of references shows a greater number of studies exploring the potential of SBA-15 as the support fully supported by promising results that should make it a good candidate for the development of DRM catalysts. The high surface area, confinement effect of the mesoporous structure and thermal stability of SBA-15 should be a key to achieve high Ni nanoparticle dispersion and stability using the optimum preparation method and suitable metal promoters. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig100">Fig. 100 and 101</a> compare the best catalytic results reached over Ni-OMS and Ni-zeolite based catalysts compiled in the literature.

Moreover, from thermodynamics standpoints, DRE is favoured at a temperature higher than 318 °C, whereas DRM at a temperature above 600 °C. Thus, DRE may allow diversifying and making more flexible and sustainable the production of syngas. The production of glycerol is more limited although the DRG constitutes a great opportunity to value the main byproduct of biodiesel production. Despite the advantages of DRE and DRG, these represent emerging technologies poorly explored and several papers covered the use of zeolites and OMS based catalysts.</span>

              <span>To make possible the development of viable DRE technology, the design and development of efficient, selective and robust catalyst is the key. Therefore, the addition of suitable promoters, multiple active phases maximizing the metal nanoparticle dispersion and stability through the strong metal/support interaction are crucial together with the design of optimized catalyst regeneration. As it occurs for dry reforming of CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, Cu, Co, Rh and Ni supported solid catalysts have been largely used for DRE, being Ni the most explored metal because of its high activity, selectivity, availability and price, besides its rapid sintering and deactivation at high temperatures.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit962"><sup><span class="sup_ref">962–965</span></sup></a> Therefore, the choice of a suitable support with a high surface area and/or appropriate redox properties has shown to be crucial to achieve high NiO dispersion with a small particle size which give a Ni higher resistance to coke deposition and sintering. As discussed in this review, the addition of a suitable promoter (Zr, Ce, La, Mn, Co, and Mg) contributes to improve the activity and stability of Ni-based catalysts. In the bibliography, the catalytic activity of zeolite based materials for DRE has not been explored, while only two works described the catalytic performance of OMS based catalysts. The benefits of the incorporation of Ce in the SBA-15 structure have been widely described to promote the oxygen surface mobility owing to the special redox properties of Ce (Ce<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/C<small><sup>4+</sup></small>) and oxygen vacancy formation. Accordingly, the suitable catalytic performance of Rh/CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> has been demonstrated due to the interaction between Rh and CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and the advanced properties of CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for DRE.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit966"><sup><span class="sup_ref">966,967</span></sup></a> Following these leads, in 2009, the catalytic performance of Rh/Ce-SBA-15 catalysts prepared by impregnation of Ce-SBA-15 with different Ce/Si molar ratios issued from direct synthesis was explored.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit968"><sup><span class="sup_ref">968</span></sup></a> Firstly, the catalytic performances of 5 wt%-Rh, Ni, Co, and Pd supported on SBA-15 were checked, revealing the lower catalytic activity of 5 wt% Ni/SBA-15 exhibiting the higher catalytic activity of 5 wt% Rh–SBA-15.

Therefore, 1 wt% Rh/Ce-SBA-15 catalysts with a Ce/Si molar ratio ranging from 0 to 1 were prepared. The stability of the ordered mesoporous structure was affected by the incorporation of Ce and could be conserved for Ce/Si up to 1/5.

Therefore, different approaches have been explored and the oxidative dehydrogenation using CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a soft oxidant instead of oxygen as alternative emerged and strengthened, because of several advantages from energetic, thermodynamic and kinetic (rate of reaction, higher alkene selectivity) standpoints, such as the suppression of the over-oxidation of substrates and products, the reduction of carbon deposits and the use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the main greenhouse gas.

            <span>The use of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> binary oxides as catalysts and supports has found many applications in catalysis due to their excellent redox properties and oxygen storage capacity as it was illustrated along the present review.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1022"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1022</span></sup></a> Accordingly, an attempt of preparation and use as a catalyst for EB ODH of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> oxides deposited onto mesoporous silicalite-1 (CS-1) was performed. First, metal hydroxide precipitated carbon nanoparticles were prepared by a pH controlled precipitation method of metal precursors onto carbon nanoparticles and further used for the hydrothermal synthesis of CS-1.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1000"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1000</span></sup></a> The characterization data showed the XRD pattern as a typical reflectance of MFI type zeolite while no reflectance of the crystalline phase of the TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small> oxides was detected, indicating that no mixed oxide was occluded on the surface. The registered catalytic performance of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–ZrO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CS-1 revealed the better resistance of the supported catalysts; however, low catalytic results were achieved, at 650 °C, 30% EB conversion and 70–75% ST selectivity were maintained over 9 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab14">Table 14</a>, entries 18 and 19). The low selectivity was attributed to the higher amount of strong acid and base sites determined by NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>-TPD and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPD may be due to the formation of solid solutions (ZrTiO<small><sub>4</sub></small>).</span>

            <span>The use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a soft oxidant offers several advantages to ensure and enhance the catalytic activity due to its ability to activate ODH directly promoting EB ODH or by combination of alkane dehydrogenation and RWGS, thus favouring thermodynamics. The catalytic results showed that high ST selectivity could be reached at a good conversion level with OMS based catalysts (V/ and Cr/MCM-41, La-V/MCMC-41 and SBA-15) (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig108">Fig. 108 and 109</a>). Nevertheless, catalyst lifetime was insufficiently studied to improve the stability and regeneration opportunities. More efforts should be spent to study catalyst robustness and reactor configuration to achieve and maintain high EB yield and selectivity offering SBA-15 support great potential. Despite their better thermal stability and robustness, zeolites because of smaller pore size may present some limitation to efficiently and homogeneously disperse metallic oxides, with high amounts of active species and metal loading. Hence, future study should focus on the benefits of hierarchical zeolite application due to its meso- and macroscale secondary porosity, together with the microporous primary structure, two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets and core–shell materials to improve the accessibility to the active center and mass transfer. In addition, OMS owing to their large pore structure offer great opportunities to prepare catalysts with high metallic phase dispersion and sintering stability owing to the confinement effect of the mesopores and strong interaction metal/support, combined with thermal stability.</span>

Ethylene is mainly produced by steam cracking of hydrocarbons like natural gas and naphtha at high temperatures, with strong drawbacks such as high energy consumption, rapid coke formation and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1055"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1055–1057</span></sup></a> Thus different alternative processes for ethylene production have been explored such as ethanol dehydration based on biomass and sustainable feedstock or the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethane.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1058"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1058,1059</span></sup></a> In the last decade, the ODH of alkanes strengthened since it offers several advantages from kinetics and environmental standpoints.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1060"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1060</span></sup></a> Dehydrogenation is an endothermic process which in the presence of oxygen becomes exothermic, since the produced H<small><sub>2</sub></small> is removed by oxidation into water and the equilibrium shifted (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch72">Scheme 72</a>). However, the flammability of ethane, exothermicity of the reaction, over-oxidation of ethylene, the hazardous use of pure oxygen and probable hotspot formation hampered the industrial implementation.

              <span>Years ago, the catalytic activity of different transition metal oxides (Cr, V, and Ga) supported on protonic zeolites prepared by impregnation was explored.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1062"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1062,1063</span></sup></a> The surface acidity of zeolite plays a crucial role in chemical transformation, and for the ethane ODH the following activity order was obtained: Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 850) &gt; Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 95) &gt; Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 45) &gt; Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 15). These results showed the impact of the Si/Al ratio and acid properties over the nature of Cr active species. The initial rate of ethylene formation was 1.6 times higher over Cr/H-ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 850) than over Cr/SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> while Cr/H-ZSM-5 catalysts, with a lower Si/Al ratio, exhibited low activity. On the other hand, Ga and V/ZSM-5 (Si/Al = 850) showed low activity for ethane ODH. TPR-spectra showed the presence of a reduction peak at high temperature (∼450 °C) assigned to the high oxidation state Cr species (Cr(<span class="small_caps">VI</span>)) with a key role in dehydrogenation activity. The authors also claimed the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> importance in the re-oxidation of Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small> species into Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> active species and in removing coke from the catalytic surface, thus prolonging the catalyst life. At 650 °C, the maximum rate of the formation of ethylene was 0.516 mmol g<small><sub>cat</sub></small><small><sup>−1</sup></small> min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> with 28% and 90% ethylene yield and selectivity (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab15">Table 15</a>, entry 45). More recently, a series of submicron Cr/ZSM-5-supported samples were prepared by impregnation of ZSM-5 with submicron size and their catalytic and textural properties were explored.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1064"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1064</span></sup></a> XPS study allowed analyzing the two oxidation states of Cr species, and the deconvolution of the Cr<small><sub>2p2/3</sub></small> spectra enabled obtaining two bands at 576.5 and 579.5 eV, assigned to Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small> and Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small>, respectively, and determining a decreasing Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small>/Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small> ratio when Si/Al increased and Na content decreased. These results showed the importance of zeolite framework composition and sodium presence on the nature of chromium species. The catalyst stability increased with the Si/Al ratio while Na samples exhibited superior catalytic performance than the protonic one. It has been widely described that the nature of chromium oxide is crucial and that crystalline Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> exhibits low activity while oligomeric chromium species are more active than isolated ones. Therefore the difference in activity for Cr/NaZSM-5 and Cr/HZSM-5 was attributed to the presence of dispersed Cr(<span class="small_caps">VI</span>) species in the form of polymeric chromates and monochromates in Cr/NaZSM-5 and to the presence of crystalline Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> in Cr/HZSM-5, determined by laser Raman spectroscopy. An optimum value of Cr close to 3 wt% was found. The best catalytic performance was achieved over 3 wt% Cr/NaZSM-5 (Si/Al = 160), at 650 °C, with initial 65% ethane conversion and 49% ethylene yield and good catalytic stability with practically constant 46% ethylene yield over 50 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab15">Table 15</a>, entries 46–48). A recent work reported an attempt of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture and utilization for ethane ODH in two stages, by combining in a fixed-bed reactor a physically mixed adsorbent and catalyst, composed of a double K–Ca salt and a Cr-impregnated H-ZSM-5 zeolite.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit988"><sup><span class="sup_ref">988</span></sup></a> A CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption study revealed that K–Ca exhibited the highest CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake (5.2 mmol g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) while characterization-activity results of Cr/H-ZSM-5 samples revealed an optimum 10 wt% Cr loading, with the highest TOF number and the lowest Cr surface density. The combined capture utilization process consisted first of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption at 600 °C, with 10% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/Ar, followed by the ethane ODH reaction at 700 °C with 5% C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small>/Ar. With GHSV = 5000 mL g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> h<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, a (K–Ca)/(Cr10/HZSM-5) ratio of 1, 25% ethane conversion, 88% and 22% ethylene selectivity and yield and 14% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion were achieved. Nevertheless, catalytic stability and adsorption studies revealed a constant deactivation of the catalyst and decrease of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacity due to adsorbent particle sintering and reduction of Cr active species (Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small>) (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab15">Table 15</a>, entry 50).</span>

              <span>The catalytic behavior of highly dispersed Zn-based SSZ-13 (NaS50) zeolite with different Zn contents was explored for ethane ODH.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1066"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1066</span></sup></a> The catalytic data revealed that conversion was correlated with Zn loading, indicating that Zn constituted the single active site of the catalyst. The catalytic activity of zeolites based on Zn with different structures was compared and the superior 2.9 wt% Zn/NaS50 catalytic performance stood out. The following activity order was established, NaS50 &gt; NaZSM-5 &gt; MCM-22 &gt; NaY, interestingly opposite to the size of the pore diameter order SSZ-13 (0.38 Å) &lt; ZSM-5 and MCM-22 (0.55 Å) &lt; Y (0.78 Å), indicating that zeolites with a small pore opening favoured CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> diffusion and adsorption. Then, DFT and operando studies were performed to determine the role of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the dehydrogenation of C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small> over Zn catalysts, considering two types of active sites based on the EXAFS data, [Zn–O–Zn]<small><sup>2+</sup></small> and Zn<small><sup>2+</sup></small>, corresponding to zinc oxide and zinc ion located on SSZ-13 zeolite. The proposed C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small> dehydrogenation mechanism involves two parts that are C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small> activation and C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small> desorption, and hydrogen desorption. Thus, C<small><sub>2</sub></small>H<small><sub>6</sub></small> dehydrogenation involves the first C–H cleavage leading to the formation of Brønsted acid zinc hydroxyl group (ZnOH) while the second C–H bond cleavage leads to the formation of Zn–H.

Therefore, the use of OMS and zeolites as supports, owing to their surface area, thermal stability and versatility in framework composition, offers great opportunities to reach maximum chromia dispersion and stabilization to the design and development of efficient and robust ODH catalysts. The impact of the preparation method on metal dispersion and particle size has been widely reported since they in turn affect the catalytic properties of the prepared catalyst. Accordingly, the importance of the addition sequence of chromium and silica precursors on the textural and catalytic properties of Cr/MCM-41 materials with different Cr loadings was explored, with Cr-TEOS or TEOS-Cr indicating the order of addition of the precursors, <span class="italic">i.e</span>., chromium and silica and, silica and chromium, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1072"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1072</span></sup></a> TEM results revealed that the TEOS-Cr addition order provided mesoporous silica with a very small nanoparticle size while the SEM study indicated higher CrO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> species dispersion with a maximum Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small>/Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small> ratio obtained for 8 wt% Cr/MCM-41-Cr-TEOS sample.

              <p class="otherpara">The benefits of sulfate modification of the silica support have been reported for the preparation of active ODH Cr-based catalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1067"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1067</span></sup></a> The surface acidity has been reported as a key parameter to activate alkane and strongly influenced the catalytic performance of ODH catalysts, and the sulfatation showed to enhance the catalytic activity of the Cr/SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalyst but induced a slight decrease in ethylene selectivity.

              <p class="otherpara">(i) <span class="italic">Bimetallic OMS-based catalysts for ethane ODH</span>. In the recent decades, and as it was mentioned many times in this review, in the preparation of bimetallic and multi-metallic catalysts much attention was paid to achieve a uniformly and highly disperse metallic active phase by establishing strong metal/metal and metal/support interactions due to electronic effects, improving metal stability against physical migration, and to enhance the catalytic activity. Following these leads, recently the synergetic effect of the addition of a second metal oxide (Co, Ce, Zn, Nb, V, and Mo) to the Cr-MCM-41 sample, over the textural, physicochemical and catalytic properties, was investigated.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1077"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1077</span></sup></a> Accordingly MCM-41-supported bimetallic oxides containing Ce, Co, and Zn were prepared following one-pot synthesis, while samples containing Mo, V and Nb were prepared following a two steps synthesis (hydrothermal + impregnation). The mesoporous structure of MCM-41 and high BET surface area were maintained after the incorporation of both metal oxides. H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPR profiles showed different reduction peaks from those of the Cr-monometallic sample attributed to metal/metal interaction, and revealed an increase in the Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> concentration for 4 wt% Cr–4 wt% Ce/MCM41 while higher temperature reduction peaks were registered for 4 wt% Cr–4 wt% Mo/MCM41 and 4 wt% Cr–4 wt% V/MCM-41 which could imply the worse reducibility of chromium. The catalytic activity of Cr-based catalysts is related to the amount of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> species and the characterization study indicated that incorporation of Ce or Co improved the reducibility of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> owing to the redox properties of CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and Co<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small>. Therefore, the catalytic activity could be correlated with amount of redox sites and dispersion of the metallic phase, and Cr–Ce/MCM-41 and Cr–Co/MCM-41 samples exhibited the higher catalytic activity while Cr–V/MCM-41 and Cr–Mo/MCM-41 displayed lower activity and selectivity to ethylene, and the highest ethylene selectivity and lower activity were reached over Cr–Zn/MCM-41 and Cr–Nb/MCM-41 (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab15">Table 15</a>, entries 18–23). The highest catalytic performance was reached over 4 wt% Cr–4 wt% Ce/MCM-41 with 37.9% ethane conversion and 35.1% ethylene yield. In addition to medium catalytic results, the catalyst showed constant deactivation over 8 h TOS. The same group studied the impact of the addition of different TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> loadings over the catalytic and textural properties of 8 wt% Cr–Ti/MCM-41 samples.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1078"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1078</span></sup></a> MCM-41 samples were first modified with TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> addition prior to Cr loading. The synergetic effect between both metal allowed improving Cr dispersion, and Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> concentration and enhancing metal–support interaction. TPR profiles registered two reduction peaks corresponding to the reduction of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> species dispersed on the α-Cr<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> surfaces at low temperatures, and Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> species interacting with the framework of siliceous support at higher temperatures. An optimum in the Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> amount interacting with the support was observed for 1.9 wt% Ti, which exhibits high Cr dispersion, predicting optimized catalytic activity and stability. Therefore, the best catalytic results were reached over 8 wt% Cr–1.9 wt% Ti/MCM41 with 52% ethane conversion and 48% ethylene yield at 700 °C (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab15">Table 15</a>, entries 24–27). Nevertheless, a constant decrease of the catalytic performance was observed over 8 h TOS (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab15">Table 15</a>, entry 28). In the same way, a series of Cr/Ce-MCM-41 samples were prepared by first adding CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and then Cr loading.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1079"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1079</span></sup></a> Moreover, the benefits of utilization of plasma energy for catalyst preparation (Cr/Ce-MCM-41(Si/Ce = 25)-p) over their morphological and catalytic features were observed. TEM analysis evidenced the alteration of the MCM-41 structure when excess of ceria was used leading to structure deterioration (Si/Ce &gt; 25). The incorporation of ceria allowed enhancing the dispersion of Cr while the plasma treatment further improved the distribution and uniformity of nanoparticles in the narrow range of 7.4–22 nm. The authors claimed that the synergistic effect of ceria incorporation and plasma treatment strengthened the interaction between Cr/MCM-41 preventing the migration of Cr particles and controlling the size of Cr ensemble. Therefore, the best catalytic performance was achieved over Cr/Ce-MCM-41(Si/Ce = 25)-p with 62% ethylene yield and 64% ethane conversion, at 700 °C (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab15">Table 15</a>, entries 29–32). A comparison of catalytic reported data is difficult because of the difference and lack of details of reaction conditions. Therefore, it is not possible to determine ethylene productivity. However, Cr/Ce-MCM-41(Si/Ce = 25)-p exhibited high catalytic performance and stability and offers great potential for the development of an industrial catalyst. A similar study was reported using SBA-15 as the support in which Cr–Ce/SBA-15 samples with different Ce loadings were prepared by co-impregnation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1069"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1069</span></sup></a> The characterization study showed the improvement of Cr dispersion due to the incorporation of Ce with the preservation of the SBA-15 structure. The TPR profiles registered three reduction peaks, at 457 °C, corresponding to the reduction of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> species, and at 378 and 799 °C to the reduction of surface ceria oxide (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig111">Fig. 111</a>). The comparison of H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPR profiles of 5Cr–Ce/SBA-15 and 10Ce/SBA-15 samples indicated that Ce reduction temperature decreased due to Ce/Cr interaction that modifies the redox ability of Ce species. H<small><sub>2</sub></small> consumption increased with Ce loading to reach a maximum for 5Cr–10Ce/SBA-15 sample corresponding to the maximum amount of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> species.

              <p class="otherpara">Years ago, the study and development of monolithic catalysts revealed several advantages of these composites, such as low-pressure drop, high heat and mass transfer rates and minimum axial dispersion owing to their unified structure in a single block.

As well as, basic supports favour the formation of stable vanadium mixed oxides, while acid supports contribute to high dispersion of vanadium species avoiding the formation of polymeric species. Therefore, a recent study reported the influence of the introduction of different metals into MCM-41 framework on the nature of vanadium species, activity and stability of ODH catalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1084"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1084</span></sup></a> Thus a series of VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/MCM-41, VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg-MCM-41, VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg–Al-MCM-41 and VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg–Zr-MCM-41 were prepared. The incorporation of different metals (Mg, Al, Zr) affected the catalytic activity, the structural and textural properties (crystallinity, particle size, dispersion) and acid/base properties. XRD patterns showed that the high surface area of MCM-41 enables high dispersion of vanadium and no peak of crystalline V<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>5</sub></small> was registered. The incorporation of Mg and Zr into the VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg–Zr-MCM-41 sample led to the formation of MgO and the tetragonal phase of zirconia. Moreover, the framework substitution of a larger diameter cation such as Zr<small><sup>4+</sup></small> and Mg<small><sup>2+</sup></small> by smaller Si<small><sup>4+</sup></small> induced modifications of bond length of M–O–Si and then led to the MCM-41 structure deformation. FESEM and EDX analyses revealed improved V dispersion on the VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg–Zr-MCM-41 sample attributed to the surface acidity due to framework zirconia. The surface acidity determines alkane activation; greater the acidity, higher the ethane conversion. Thus the framework incorporation of Mg, Al and Zr produced different samples with different acid strengths and hence different catalytic behaviors. Accordingly, from NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>-TPD, the following order of acidity was obtained: VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/MCM-41 &lt; VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg-MCM-41 &lt; VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg–Al-MCM-41 &lt; VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg–Zr-MCM-41. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra allowed determining two types of vanadium oxo-species, one dimensional oligomeric and two-dimensional polymeric units in octahedral coordination. The best catalytic performance for ethane ODH was observed for the VO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>/Mg–Zr-MCM-41, which contained only oligomeric tetrahedral vanadium species with higher dispersion and the higher amount of acid sites.

            <span>Most of the reported catalysts for ethane ODH are CrO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>-based, implying severe limitations due to the carcinogenicity of chromium species (Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small>) and severe control and measures in the catalyst preparation, use and elimination. Therefore, alternative should be deeply considered. Besides, the catalytic performance of 5 wt% Cr/SBA-15/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/FeCrAl over 1100 h reached goals of production and catalyst stability with good 63% ethylene yield, highlighting the potential of SBA-15 as a support. Actually, catalyst success will depend on catalyst and operation costs, catalyst stability and coke deposition besides the catalytic performances and features. The use of zeolites as a support due to the pore size characteristic is limited, since a high active metal content is required to achieve high catalytic activity provided by a large number of active sites, and to achieve high productivity, leading to a decrease in surface area and blockage of the zeolite pores. Therefore, the preparation of hierarchical zeolite-based ODH catalysts, due to their meso- and macroscale secondary porosity, together with the microporous primary structure and two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets based ODH catalysts, should allow the preparation of zeolitic catalysts with a high content of metal species with improved catalytic activity and mass transfer.</span>

            <span>Propylene is a valuable platform molecule for the production of a large number of chemical commodities (propylene oxide, acrylic acid, acrylonitrile, isopropanol, cumene, and butyraldehyde) and polymers. The propylene global production in 2020 was 108 Mt and is expected to reach 128 Mt by 2027, and the current industrial production is based on catalytic propane dehydrogenation.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit991"><sup><span class="sup_ref">991,1085</span></sup></a> From thermodynamic standpoints (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch73">Scheme 73</a>), propane ODH with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> involves different competitive endothermic reactions and mainly propane dry reforming which is thermodynamically less constrained than ethane and methane dry reforming.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1086"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1086</span></sup></a> Other reactions such as cracking and propylene and propane decomposition take place readily. On the other hand, since propane ODH is a reaction with volume increase due to process stoichiometry, the co-feeding of inert gas is favourable to propane conversion enhancement, decreasing propylene production. Therefore, the challenge lies in developing a selective catalyst to promote propane ODH and kinetically suppress propane dry reforming.

The best catalytic performance was reached over the 3 wt% Cr/ZSM-5-S with 0.4 μm crystal size than over 3 wt% Cr/ZSM-5-L with 2 μm crystal size due to the presence of a higher amount of Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> species.

Surface acidity is a key parameter to selectively adsorb and activate the reactants, and different strategies can be followed to modify the acidity of zeolite by dealumination using acid treatment or by steaming at high temperature. Accordingly, a series of Cr/Si and Al-Beta samples were prepared with different Cr loadings by impregnation using AlBeta sample with Si/Al = 17 and dealuminated SiBeta with Si/Al = 1000.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1089"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1089,1090</span></sup></a> The catalytic behavior for propane ODH revealed the negative effect of the presence of Al over the catalytic activity of 2 wt% Cr/AlBeta achieving low 4.5% propane conversion and 2% propylene yield, at 550 °C, attributed to higher surface acidity.

              <p class="otherpara">Another strategy to modify and weaken the acidic properties of zeolite is the isomorphous substitution of Al by another metal such as boron. Therefore, Cr/silicalite-1 and Cr/H[B]MFI (incorporating boron) were prepared and further treated by steaming (Cr/H[B]MFI-st).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1091"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1091</span></sup></a> H<small><sub>2</sub></small>-TPR spectra revealed that no reduction peak of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> into Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small> was observed for Cr/silicalite-1 and Cr/H[B]MFI-st, while it was detected for the boron containing sample (Cr/H[B]MFI). The presence of boron allowed the formation of some Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> species readily reduced into Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small> by H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and also by steaming treatment. Then, steaming treatment enabled the auto-reduction of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> into Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small> located near to boron to counterbalance the negative charge of the framework. The comparison of the catalytic performance revealed that Cr/H[B]MFI exhibited higher catalytic activity and stability than Cr/silicalite-1. The propane conversion over Cr/H[B]MFI decreased rapidly from 50% to 20% in 2 h while this was around 10% over Cr/silicalite-1. When the catalytic performance of Cr/H[B]MFI-st and Cr/H[B]MFI samples was compared for 70 h TOS, a constant decrease of propane conversion from 30 to 7% was recorded over Cr/H[B]MFI over 60 h TOS, while ∼13% propane conversion remained stable over Cr/H[B]MFI-st. These results were attributed to the weakened Brønsted acidity because of steaming treatment and the differences in the nature of Cr species, the Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small>/Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> ratio and the formation of polychromates (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab16">Table 16</a>, entries 6–8). Dealumination strategy by steaming of HZSM-5 zeolite to optimize acid properties of Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5 was also used to improve the catalytic performance of the Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5 catalyst.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1092"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1092</span></sup></a> A NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>-TPD study showed only one desorption peak with a small area at 264 °C attributed to a low Al framework content for HZSM-5 zeolite, while after gallium oxide incorporation, a second peak at 465 °C was recorded, indicating that some strong acid sites are formed. After steaming and dealumination, acidity was drastically weakened. The excess of loss acidity was attributed to the loss of interaction of Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> with the support due to the absence of Al. Hence, the catalytic performance of Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5 samples varied with the Si/Al ratio, and propane conversion order was Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5(700) ≫ Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5(650) &gt; Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5(750) ∼ Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5(600) &gt; Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5 ∼ Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5(800) ∼ Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/silicalite.

Catalyst stability increased with increasing Si/Al ratio because coke deposition lowered. As previously published, the proposed mechanism for propane ODH over Ga<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> supported catalysts should follow the heterolytic dissociation pathway, where the presence of Brønsted acid sites in zeolite should promote the dehydrogenation reaction (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig117">Fig. 117</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1093"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1093</span></sup></a> On the other hand the role of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was explored, and a control of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CO concentration for propane ODH allowed determining that CO production was twice CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, leading to assume that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mainly participates in the Boudouard reaction and coke gasification.</p>

A constant catalytic performance decrease was observed over TOS to reach a steady state after 50 h. The propene yield first increased with P loading, until 1.5% and then decreased.

              <span>The catalytic activity and selectivity of supported chromia materials for alkane dehydrogenation have been studied for many years, with the dispersion and formation of monochromate active species being the key parameters. Years ago, it was demonstrated that the MCM-41 ordered mesoporous structure and its high surface area allow high dispersion and amount of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> active species achieving similar catalytic performance than Cr/SiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for propane ODH (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab16">Table 16</a>, entries 24 and 25).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1109"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1109</span></sup></a> Previously, Cr/MCM-41 materials were successfully prepared by direct hydrothermal (DHT) and template-ion exchange (TIE) methods without destroying the mesoporous structure of MCM-41 for Si/Cr ratio &gt; 25. Difference in chromium species was observed, and for samples prepared by DHT (Cr/MCM-41(DHT)), monochromate species were formed while for samples prepared by the TIE method (Cr/MCM-41(TIE)), large amount of polychromate species were formed besides monochromate species.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1110"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1110</span></sup></a> Nevertheless, both samples exhibited similar catalytic performance with 92% propylene oxide selectivity and 28% and 29% propane conversion over 3 wt% Cr/MCM-41(DHT) and 3 wt% Cr/MCM-41(TIE) catalysts, respectively, at 550 °C (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab16">Table 16</a>, entries 26 and 27). However, no stability data on catalytic activity were provided. Later, four series of Cr supported catalysts with different Cr contents (0.7–13.7 wt%) over MCM-41, amorphous silica and mesoporous silica with cubic (SBA-1) and hexagonal phase (SBA-15) were prepared by impregnation and tested for propane ODH.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1111"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1111–1113</span></sup></a> Higher dispersion of chromium species was achieved over mesoporous supports owing to their high surface area, implying a higher content of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> for mesoporous materials.

However, the amount of Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small> species depends on the support and specifically the surface area.

            <span>Propane ODH with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is an attractive approach to produce propylene showing different advantages such as shifting of equilibrium owing to combination with RWGS, completion of redox cycle with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> participation, and improvement of catalytic life due to coke elimination through reverse Boudouard reaction. However, many unknown data still remain to be clarified such as redox cycle and involved species, mechanisms, competitive adsorption between CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, alkane and alkene and, above all, to investigate the stability, reuse and regeneration of catalysts in order to give industrial application a chance. Therefore, computational modeling and <span class="italic">in situ</span> spectroscopy studies will be fundamental tools for the rational design of efficient and stable ODH catalysts. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig121">Fig. 121 and 122</a> depict a graphical comparison of the different catalytic performance of propane ODH catalysts to evaluate the productivity or selectivity of the process. High catalytic data were reached, with high propane conversion up to 42%, and propylene selectivity up to 92% with rapid deactivation of the catalyst (V or Cr/MCM-41), while monolithic V–Cr/SBA-15 based catalysts exhibited the best catalytic performance. For industrial application, propylene productivity is a benchmark and propylene selectivity is of paramount importance. To compare the catalysts’ life additional studies are required since each process has a specific state-of-the-art technology, an optimized reactor system including catalyst regeneration cycles, and the reaction time can be short with catalyst regeneration intervals allowing continuous use for years.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit991"><sup><span class="sup_ref">991</span></sup></a> For example the CATOFIN® process, a widely applied technology, alternates incessantly dehydrogenation, regeneration, and purge stages with a few minutes of duration for each stage, in a multiple reactor bed to ensure constant propylene production (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig123">Fig. 123</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1117"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1117</span></sup></a></span>

Currently, the two main methods to produce isobutene based on fossil source are naphtha steam cracking and fluidized catalytic cracking, which cannot fully supply the increasing demand.

A comparison of catalytic performance 3 wt% Cr/Silicate-1 and 3 wt% Cr/SBA-15 revealed that higher isobutene conversion was achieved on 3 wt% Cr/Silicate-1 owing to higher amount of Cr active species, while higher selectivity was reached over 3 wt% Cr/SBA-15 attributed to the lower acidity of the SBA-15 sample. The characterization of spent catalysts showed that coke was more easily burnt off over 3 wt% Cr/Silicate-1 while a higher Cr<small><sup>6+</sup></small>/Cr<small><sup>3+</sup></small> ratio was also determined indicating that Cr species interacting with nest silanols were more easily re-oxidized by CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> during the ODH process.

Good catalytic results were achieved in the presence of OMS-based catalysts that should stimulate and drive the scientific community and industry to explore their potential up to the last step of commercial application. Moreover, to overcome the limitation of microporosity of zeolites, the benefits of the development of catalysts based on hierarchical zeolites and two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets to promote physical isolation and protection of particles as well as mass transfer should be explored.</span>

      <span>The use of solar energy to convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into chemicals and fuels has received great attention in the last 30 years. Indeed, electro- and photo-reduction reactions have great potential for producing fuel molecules such as CO, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, HCOOH, HCHO, MeOH and EtOH, using solar energy directly or indirectly. In photocatalysis, also called artificial photosynthesis, electrons are produced from the excitons of semiconductor photocatalysts by means of photonic excitation, whereas in electrocatalysis, the electrons are produced from an external electric field that, in turn, can be produced by photovoltaic solar cells, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> indirectly using solar energy.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect15101"><span class="b_heading">1 Electroreduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></span></h3>
        <span>Electrocatalytic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reduction is a very attractive CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion method due to its ambient reaction conditions and simplicity of device fabrication. However, there are several challenges, such as low CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> solubility, high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> activation energy, low energy efficiency and low selectivity of the process. But the main drawbacks such as the low stability of the electrodes and their deactivation in less than 100 h restrict their commercialization (metal poisoning and agglomeration of the active centers),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1124</span></sup></a> while the low selectivity of the process requires costly separation steps and energy consumption.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1125</span></sup></a> The low efficiency of solar to chemical energy conversion is due to the difficulties in fulfilling all the requirements: high catalytic activity at the electrode surface, sufficient passivation of the electrode surface (limiting the recombination of carriers), formation of a high energy barrier at the semiconductor/solution interface, and proximity of energy levels between the semiconductor and the reactants to minimize energy loss in interfacial reactions.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In the last few decades, the large number of investigations on electrocatalysts, reaction conditions and devices for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> electroreduction have allowed the development of the knowledge and the improvement of the catalytic performance of electrocatalysts. The current understanding of the reaction mechanism requires further exploration involving theoretical calculations and <span class="italic">in situ</span> characterization techniques to monitor the variations in the electronic structure of the active sites and to detect metastable intermediates. Therefore, research should not be limited to the development of excellent electrocatalysts, but to an overall understanding of the electrolysis system. So far, the design and development of electrocatalysts, due to multiple requirements and complexity to improve their efficiency and stability, have not considered the use of zeolite and OMS probably due to their intrinsic properties and capabilities to generate and transfer electrons (potential, faradaic efficiency, and energy efficiency), and it is reasonable to consider that future research will focus on other approaches.</p>

Then, the high redox potential for an electron transfer to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is −1.9 eV due to the linear geometry of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecule and the energy requirement to bend and inject an electron into its orbitals. Although the redox potential is lower than the conduction band (CB) of most semiconductors, some photocatalysts can adsorb CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and bend the configuration of the molecule. Thus, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can have a lower LUMO level allowing electron transfer. To compare, the thermocatalytic reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> requires elevated temperatures and pressures, while photocatalysis occurs at room temperature and ambient pressure under solar irradiation, and requires an efficient semiconductor.

          <p class="otherpara">Upon irradiation, electrons from the valence band (VB) are excited to the conduction band (CB) leaving vacancies (“holes”) in the valence band. Therefore, the electrons and holes produced can be involved in a photocatalytic reaction (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig127">Fig. 127 and 128</a>). The photoreduction requires a reductant and the normally preferred one is water owing to its richness, non-toxicity, and effectiveness. The main problem with the use of water as a hydrogen donor and hole quencher is that water competes to absorb electrons in the conduction band to generate hydrogen. In addition, this hydrogen is generally formed in higher yields than CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photoreduction products. Other reductants such as trimethylamine (amines) or Na<small><sub>2</sub></small>S capable of consuming the photogenerated holes during the photocatalytic reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are also used, especially in the gas phase, conferring structural stability to the photocatalysts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1131</span></sup></a></p>

              <span>Zeolites are used as catalysts in numerous chemical processes due to their high specific surface area, pore structures, stability, Lewis and Brønsted acid and base properties, ability to host organic and metal complexes, nanoparticles and metal oxides, high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake capacity<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1135</span></sup></a> and ability to stabilize radical cations and trap electrons.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1136,1137</span></sup></a> All these properties can be tuned to obtain zeolites with superior CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption and activation ability. Unfortunately, the application of zeolites as photocatalysts for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photoreduction has been rather disregarded probably because it was assumed that the “ideal zeolite” was a good insulator<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1138"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1138</span></sup></a> so research has focused on the development of semiconductors for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photoreduction. The photoactivity of zeolite is related to the possible photoexcitation of the (M<small><sup><span class="italic">n</span>+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>2−</sup></small>) to (M<small><sup>(<span class="italic">n</span>−1)+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>−</sup></small>)* pair. Thus, different approaches have been explored to introduce substituted or anchored heteroatoms into zeolite structures to enhance their photocatalytic properties. Moreover, zeolites provide oxygen defects that promote better charge separation while OH groups favor the proton and charge transport. These physicochemical properties of zeolites make them attractive supports for the design and synthesis of photocatalysts with different active centers specific for competitive adsorption/desorption of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, CO, H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and redox reactions.</span>

              <span>Another approach to improve the photocatalytic properties of zeolite-based materials is the incorporation of organic semiconductors, such as polythiophene (PT). Then, the preparation of the photocatalyst Na-ZSM-5-PT by chemical oxidative polymerization of thiophene for reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to formic and acetic acid was described.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1142</span></sup></a> The advantage of a PT/zeolite photocatalyst is the absorption of the radiation at wavelengths ≤650 nm, invading the infrared region and enabling the use of a wider range of wavelengths for the photoreduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab19">Table 19</a>, entry 16). In line, an advanced photocatalyst was prepared combining the photocatalytic properties of TS-1 nanosheets were combined with those of a semiconductor (graphitic carbon nitride (CN)) to enhance light absorption, especially for visible light. Thus, TS-1 nanosheets were hybridized with hydroxylated CN nanosheets to form a 2D/2D hCN/TS-1 Z-scheme nanocomposite that exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the pristine TS-1 nanosheets (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab19">Table 19</a>, entries 6 and 7). The photocatalytic performance increased with the increasing loaded amounts of CN up to 10 wt%, to reach the maximum owing to optimum charge separation due to strengthened interfacial interactions favorable to charge transfer.</span>

              <span>The microporous nature of zeolite can hinder mass transfer and hamper the catalytic reaction. To this end, the use of zeolite nanosheets with thicknesses of a few nanometers, the introduction of a hierarchical porous structure and the introduction of macropores for the design of novel zeolite-based photocatalysts would be valuable strategies for future developments. Accordingly, the preparation of two-dimensional (2D) TS-1 nanosheets was reported not only to take advantage of the larger surface area but also to reduce the charge transfer distance for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photoreduction exhibiting higher photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> than the 3D sample (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab19">Table 19</a>, entry 8).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1143</span></sup></a> Following the same approach, the synthesis and photocatalytic performance of zeolite SAPO-5 nanosheets for the photoreduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was reported.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1144</span></sup></a> The photocatalytic study revealed that SAPO-5 ultrathin nanosheets exhibited six times higher photocatalytic activity than SAPO-5 microrods for CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> formation and higher than other standard zeolites. The results were attributed to the higher amount of exposed Al atoms owing to the morphology of nanosheets that enhances not only the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacity but also the excited state electron capture and transfer. In addition, the nanosheet morphology allowed the improvement of the mass transfer process. All these improved physicochemical properties enabled longer excited state lifetime on SAPO-5 nanosheets and led to higher photoactivity for the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab19">Table 19</a>, entries 14 and 15).</span>

Therefore, different strategies have been followed to introduce heteroatoms into zeolite structures and to enhance their photocatalytic activity. Hence, the introduction of efficient electron scavengers such as noble metals such as Au, Pd or Ag that are relatively inexpensive, allows improving the photocatalytic performance. Titanosilicate-1 (TS-1) is an important zeolite with isomorphic substitution of Ti<small><sup>IV</sup></small> species in the MFI zeolite framework, which has long been applied to various photocatalytic and oxidation reactions.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1145,1146</span></sup></a> The photocatalytic activity of zeolitic titanosilicate has been explored in various studies, and the activity of Ti–O species was reported to be higher than that of Ti species octahedrally coordinated of bulk TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photoreduction.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1134"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1134,1141,1146</span></sup></a> Therefore, in addition to the benefits of the pore system, large surface area and the possible modifications of redox and acid/base properties with functional components, different strategies have been followed to improve the photocatalytic activity of these materials, such as the deposition of metal clusters and metal oxide clusters, metal nanoparticles and metal oxide nanoparticles and polymeric semiconductor nanoparticles. Moreover, the presence of a high number of silanol groups confers high hydrophobicity to the surface of TS-1 that favors proton and charge transfer as well as adsorption of water.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1147</span></sup></a> The synthesis of Ag and TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles co-loaded zeolite TS-1 (Ag–TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/TS-1) by the ion-exchange and <span class="italic">in situ</span> photodeposition method in successive steps was recently reported for its use as photocatalyst for the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1148"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1148</span></sup></a> XPS and EPR analyses revealed that Ag–TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/TS-1 nanocomposite exhibits the higher amount of Ti<small><sup>3+</sup></small> defects and oxygen vacancies, allowing better visible light adsorption and separation efficiency of the photogenerated charges. The high photocatalytic activity was attributed to the properties of TS-1, to the highly exposed reduction planes {101} of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and to the uniformly dispersed Ag nanoparticles. The TS-1 high surface area and rich defects enabled the high dispersion of active species and molecular adsorption of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, as well as accelerated charge separation by hole and electron trapping.

              <p class="otherpara">Also, the photocatalytic performance of TS-1 nanosheet hybridized material with a semiconductor (graphitic carbon nitride (CN)), hCN/TS-1, was improved by the deposition of Ag nanoparticles.

The content (wt%) of CN and Ag was optimized and the 1.5Ag/hCN10/TS-1 composite displayed the best catalytic performance for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photoreduction, and the yield in the presence of 1.5Ag/hCN10/TS-1 was approximately 7 times higher than that of pristine TS-1 (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab19">Table 19</a>, entry 10). In this zeolite-based composite photocatalyst, the charge transfer was achieved under visible light irradiation (<span class="italic">λ</span> &lt; 390 nm).

            <span>
              <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab19">Table 19</a> summarizes the main results obtained for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> photoreduction in the presence of zeolite-based photocatalysts. The productivity and fuel production cannot be compared exactly due to the variability in reaction conditions and reaction system configurations, but a general view can be given. The main drawbacks are the narrow absorption range of visible light together with low photoconversion efficiency, which limits the application of these photocatalytic systems. Compared to the study of semiconductor photocatalysts, the study of zeolite-based photocatalysts has been quite disregarded. The unique properties of microporous zeolites make them a viable photocatalytic alternative to sophisticated chemical and semiconductor processes. Their microstructures have a high surface area that favors a higher light uptake, a high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacity and physicochemical and adsorption/desorption properties that allow the activation of the molecules, providing them with a high reaction rate and photocatalytic activity. The synthesis and application of hierarchical zeolites to the development of photocatalysts should enable the enhancement of the unique properties of zeolites and counteract mass transport limitations. Hierarchical zeolites possess meso- and macroscale secondary porosity along with microporous primary structures. These materials then exhibit the conventional properties of zeolites with enhanced diffusion of molecules to solve the mass transport limitation. It is hoped that a combination of molecular simulation and machine learning techniques can be applied to the design of zeolite photocatalysts leading to an in-depth understanding of zeolite-based photocatalysts necessary for future research and development of the photoreduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</span>

            <span>The photoconversion process involves three crucial steps: the light adsorption on the surface of the photocatalyst to produce electron–hole, the photogeneration carrier transport, and the oxidation–reduction reactions.

              <span>In 1998, the photocatalytic activity of titanium oxide species embedded within the framework of OMS Ti-MCM-41 and Ti-MCM-48 prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis was explored for the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O at 55 °C to produce CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH in the gas phase.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1153</span></sup></a> The characterization study indicated that Ti species were highly dispersed within the zeolite framework and in tetrahedral coordination. The photocatalytic reaction rate and selectivity showed to be dependent on the type of catalyst. Over Ti-containing OMS and zeolite type catalysts, higher amount of CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH was produced while CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> was the main product over bulk TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. These results were attributed to the charge transfer photoexcited state of the highly dispersed titanium oxide species (Ti<small><sup>3+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>−</sup></small>)* (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab20">Table 20</a>, entry 1). The same trend was observed for the photocatalytic reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> over Ti-FSM-16. The CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH production was related to the local structure of the Ti-oxide species and the photocatalytic activity attributed to the charge transfer excited state dispersed tetrahedrally coordinated Ti-oxide species (Ti<small><sup>3+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>−</sup></small>)* (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab20">Table 20</a>, entry 2).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1154</span></sup></a> More recently, the photoreduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was studied in the presence of optimized Ti-mesoporous silica, Ti-SBA-15 and Ti-KIT-6, with different Si/Ti ratios.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1155</span></sup></a> Photocatalytic study revealed that Ti-KIT-6 calcined with Si/Ti = 100 exhibited the best photocatalytic performance for the reduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> with water in the gas phase which was attributed to the higher accessibility to the active sites together with the lower number of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> agglomerates and higher number of isolated Ti species determined by UV-Vis spectroscopy, TEM and XPS analyses. The concentrations of OH groups were found to play a key role due to the competitive adsorption of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O on the catalyst surface that influences the process selectivity towards CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> or CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH. The higher concentrations of the OH groups, detected from the FT-IR spectra for Ti-KIT-6-calcined with Si/Ti = 100, control the adsorption properties and the reaction pathway (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab20">Table 20</a>, entry 3). Therefore, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> formation increased with H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O adsorption increasing due to the greater hydrophilicity of the material. An appropriate way to boost the activation of inert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> molecules is its adsorption on the surface of any semiconductor to lower its energy barrier.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1156"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1156</span></sup></a> Therefore, a mechanism starting with the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O adsorption on isolated tetrahedrally coordinated Ti<small><sup>4+</sup></small> centers was proposed ((<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig129">Fig. 129</a>). The UV light absorption enables charge-transfer excited states (Ti<small><sup>3+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>−</sup></small>)* with the photogenerated electron and hole localized on neighboring atoms responsible for a higher lifetime of the excited Ti<small><sup>3+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>−</sup></small> (54 μs)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1157</span></sup></a> in comparison to bulk TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> powder (nanosecond order). The interaction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O on the (Ti<small><sup>3+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>−</sup></small>)* photoexcited active sites leads to the formation of intermediates species and finally to C, H and OH radicals further combined to generate CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>OH. The source and intensity of the UV light and the H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O/CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> ratios are the key factors influencing the photoactivity of the catalyst, the main drawback of this system being that the sunlight is not short enough.</span>

            <span>The main drawbacks of the photoreduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to simple fuel molecules are the narrow absorption range of visible light together with low photoconversion efficiency, which limits the application of these photocatalytic systems. In comparison to the large number of studies reported for semiconductor photocatalysts, the study of zeolite-based photocatalysts has been quite disregarded. This fact has been attributed to the insulator property of zeolites. Nevertheless, the photocatalytic activity of zeolites associated with the possible photoexcitation of the (M<small><sup><span class="italic">n</span>+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>2−</sup></small>) to (M<small><sup>(<span class="italic">n</span>−1)+</sup></small>–O<small><sup>−</sup></small>)* pair and the key role of hydrophilic–hydrophobic properties governed by the presence of silanol groups to promote proton and charge transfer and water adsorption have been fully recognized and demonstrated. Moreover, the unique properties of zeolites and OMS make them viable photocatalytic alternatives to sophisticated chemical and semiconductor processes. Their porous structures have a high surface area that favors a higher light uptake, a high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacity and tunable physicochemical and adsorption/desorption properties that allow the activation of the molecules, providing them with a high reaction rate and photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the synthesis and application of hierarchical zeolites to the development of photocatalysts should enable the enhancement of the unique properties of zeolites and counteract mass transport limitations.</span>

      <span>The use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a C1 building block to mitigate CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions and at the same time produce sustainable chemicals or fuels is a challenging and promising alternative to meet the global demand for chemicals and energy. In this review, we have collected the different reactions involving zeolite and OMS-based catalysts to convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into valuable chemicals and fuels (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig132">Fig. 132</a>). Their flexibility in the composition and structure such as support and/or a host of metals, metalorgano-complexes, and organo-catalysts and robustness were highlighted exhibiting the great potential of zeolite and OMS catalysts to boost CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> chemical conversion. Today, the use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a building block still requires a lot of effort, fundamental knowledge and insights to understand the mechanisms, determining the intermediate species and the active centres for each stage. The stability of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and the high activation energy barrier to overcome thermodynamic equilibrium, requiring high energy consumption, are the main impediments and bottlenecks to commercialisation that keep these processes still in the laboratory research stage.</span>

      <p class="otherpara">From environmental standpoints, reactor design and energy efficiency are key and heat production must be based on renewable (wind, hydro and solar) or nuclear energy sources to minimize the carbon footprint and meet carbon neutrality. Moreover, the use of high temperature enhances the formation of undesirable products, making it crucial to design and develop efficient and selective catalysts. For CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, heterogeneous catalysts are attractive and preferred for industrial implementation due to their catalytic features such as activity, robustness, efficiency, recovery and recycling, easy handling making them economically advantageous, environmentally friendly minimizing wastes. To enable CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, efficient and high-throughput CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture technologies with adequate purity, probably located at point sources, will first have to be available. In the same way, for the hydrogenation process, H<small><sub>2</sub></small> will be available and green. Despite these barriers, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> constitutes an indisputable and necessary source of carbon to produce the chemicals and fuels that our society requires and on which it depends.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In the present review, we revise and examine the zeolite- and OMS-based materials activity and opportunities to convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into valuable chemicals and fuels. We summarise the main advances, limitations and major challenges to be overcome in order to successfully convert anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The synthesis of cyclic carbonates by cycloaddition of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and epoxides in the presence of advanced multifunctional catalysts based on zeolites and OMS has been extensively studied, and the main issues are low catalyst stability and few recycling opportunities, as well as the use of co-catalysts and harsh operating conditions that hinder the feasibility of this transformation. However, we can highlight the catalytic performance of zeolites and OMS containing the structure directing agent as active sites for catalyzing the cycloaddition with interesting opportunities for stability and recycling and limited catalyst cost. The cycloaddition constitutes an attractive and important approach because it involves a high-energy three-membered ring substrate, being a 100% atom economy reaction. Moreover, the use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> constitutes a great opportunity to substitute toxic carbonylating agents such as phosgene and derivatives. Nevertheless, the inertness and stability of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> proved to be the major impediments. On one hand, marginal routes have been explored to produce cyclic carbonates such as olefin oxidative carboxylation and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> carbonylation of diols that received low consideration. On the other hand, the synthesis of dialkyl-carbonates is thermodynamically limited and received poor attention as it is the case of the preparation of acyclic carbamates or 2-oxazolidinones.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The synthesis of carboxylic acids such as acetic acid by reaction between CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, and propanoic acid by reaction between ethane and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are practically impossible from an industrial perspective because of high energetic barriers. With respect to the synthesis of formic acid, the few references found in the bibliography evidence that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation using zeolite- and OMS-based catalysts has been insufficiently explored besides the requirement of novel and efficient catalytic system for the very challenging production of formic acid as a potential way to chemically store hydrogen.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The direct hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in methanol to industrial production is still an immature process and still requires improvement of the catalytic performance in terms of activity, stability and MeOH selectivity. For future study, the adsorption properties (hydrophobicity) of the surface should be considered while exhaustive and comprehensive studies of active species and intermediates of reaction will be required for a successful <span class="italic">ab initio</span> design of an efficient and robust catalyst, taking into accounts thermodynamics since the reaction is feasible from low temperature. Considering the morphology, topology, thermal stability, hydrophobic/hydrophilic, acid/base and redox properties of zeolites and OMS materials, greater consideration should focus on these materials when designing new catalysts.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The direct transformation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into DME is an attractive route considering the environmental and economic issues involved. Nevertheless, the developed catalysts exhibited limited DME selectivity because of high CO production, in addition to the drastic deactivation catalyst due to water production. Nonetheless, the catalytic performance of La–Cu–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5 and Cu–ZnO–Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/HZSM-5 due to the good DME selectivity and productivity was highlighted. However, the direct transformation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into DME remained still an immature technology from an industrial perspective and studies taking into account catalyst stability and regeneration step should be performed.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Among CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation reactions, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation is the most favoured reaction from thermodynamics. The activation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is of paramount importance to reach high methanation activity at lower reaction temperatures constituting crucial parameters, the oxygen mobility and basic properties of the support, as well as the hydrophobicity of the catalytic surface to limit the water adsorption and inhibitory effect. Among the various zeolite-based and OMS-based catalysts herein reported, USY-based catalysts exhibited great potential owing to improved stability provided by post synthesis treatments. From commercial and industrial perspectives, several catalytic processes and reactors technology are available that should be transferred to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> methanation as high conversion and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> selectivity close to 100% are reached at the laboratory scale. However, the viability for large-scale CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> fixation also depends on readily availability and price of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> issued from waste and/or renewable sources in order to develop sustainable processes, based on the heat produced from renewable or nuclear energy to move towards zero carbon footprint.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation to C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH is an attractive process to obtain new building block molecules and energy carriers. Although this process has been widely studied in the last decade, few studies focused on the development of catalysts based on zeolites or OMS besides the benefits of confinement effect, nanoparticle stabilization by electronic features and shape-selectivity (reactants, products, and transition states). The best yield has been achieved over the RhFeLi/TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> catalyst with 4.91% C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH, and maximum 100% ethanol selectivity on the organic product basis has been reached over the Cu@Na-Beta catalyst. The main challenge is to improve the yield and selectivity of C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH. To this end, the <span class="italic">ab initio</span> design of the catalysts, introducing the necessary active sites, rationalised and simulated by computational chemistry can be a decisive tool. Zeolites and OMS-based catalysts constitute good candidates for the development of selective and stable catalysts for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation to C<small><sub>2+</sub></small>OH, but they have been so far under-considered.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> hydrogenation to gasoline, olefins and aromatics offers new opportunities to convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into value-added products and pave a path to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> circularity. In the last decade, significant advances in the development of tandem catalysts based on metal oxides and zeolites have been made for the selective hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to lower olefins (C<small><sub>2</sub></small>–C<small><sub>4</sub></small>), gasoline (C<small><sub>5</sub></small>–C<small><sub>11</sub></small>) and aromatics (C<small><sub>6</sub></small>–C<small><sub>8</sub></small>) of wide interest to the chemical industry. The high activity of the heterogeneous catalyst is usually attributed to the synergy between the active sites and the support and/or the promoter. The improvement of process selectivity is still required and is challenging, and should avoid expensive separation steps. Thus, new studies on the specific modification of zeolite morphology, such as tuning the pore size and poisoning of external acid sites, should allow controlling the hydrocarbon product selectivity. Undoubtedly, the future tandem catalyst for direct hydrogenation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to C<small><sub>2+</sub></small> will be based on zeolite-type materials.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transformation into syngas constitutes a winning approach towards the sustainable production of chemicals and fuels towards a carbon neutral society. Further syngas conversion into MeOH or through the Fischer Tropsch process constitutes direct routes to the production of fuels and chemicals through technologies already explored, developed and implemented. Accordingly, the production of CO from RWGS is challenging because of its huge interest as a building block. Numerous studies investigated the RWGS process but new efforts are still required to determine the reaction mechanism and achieve comprehensive knowledge about the nature of active sites to finally establish structure–activity/selectivity relationship. In the present review, we recompiled a few studies revealing that the potential of zeolites and OMS materials has been scarcely considered and undervalued. These studies described important strategies to maximize CO selectivity and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion, to enhance metal–support interaction and stability, to improve CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption/activation and fast and easy CO desorption, which are determinants for the design of new RWGS catalysts. Future studies of catalytic stability and deactivation are also essential for RWGS development and implementation. Much effort has to be devoted to gain a greater knowledge and for understanding of RWGS, and a final push is needed to move from laboratory studies to the industrial scale, where zeolites and OMS based materials should play a more relevant role.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The catalytic conversion of DRM into syngas (H<small><sub>2</sub></small> + CO) enables the simultaneous mitigation of two main greenhouse gases, CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which is a 100% atom efficiency process, and provides a highly regarded H<small><sub>2</sub></small>/CO ratio of 1 for further industrial conversion. However, in practice, DRM requires high energy extra consumption due to endothermicity, inducing fast catalyst deactivation, which compromises its industrial implementation as an environmental-friendly method to date. Therefore, the design of a robust and efficient catalyst at “low temperature” is topical and very challenging. On the other hand, the viability of the technology depends on the capture and availability of both CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, which cannot be of a fossil source. The present review illustrates the high activity of Ni-based zeolites and OMS catalysts despite the deactivation due to Ni sintering and coke deposition that in turn may block access to the active sites and plug the reactor in long-term tests. The use of high surface area support and bi- or multi metal-doping constitutes the main strategies to enhance the metal–support interaction and match suitable acid–base and redox properties. Zeolites and OMS offered great opportunities for the design and development of robust and efficient DRM catalysts but the catalytic performance remained far from an industrial application. The studies require long-term stability test and catalytic regeneration step while the operating temperature is very high (&gt;750 °C), with catalytic performance close to thermodynamic equilibrium. From a materials standpoint, the small pore size system of zeolites compared to mesoporous materials may be a weakness to reach a high dispersion of small metal nanoparticles and probably more prone to pore blockage. A large collection of references shows the potential of SBA-15 as support, which makes SBA-15 a great candidate for the development of DRM catalysts owing to the high surface area, confinement effect of mesoporous structure and thermal stability that should allow achieving high Ni nanoparticles dispersion and stability using optimum preparation method and suitable metallic promoters. Furthermore, the design of DRM reactors with alternating cycles of reaction and catalyst regeneration should be key. On the other hand, the combination of POM and DRM processes offers opportunities to overcome the main limitation of energetic cost by taking advantage of the POM exothermicity, although the POM + DRM route has been insufficiently explored and even less so in the presence of zeolite and OMS catalysts.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Another route based on renewable feedstock to produce syngas is the dry reforming (DR) of alcohols derived from bio-resources such as bio-ethanol and glycerol derived from biodiesel, effectively closing the carbon cycle by producing valuable chemicals and using the main greenhouse gas, mitigating the effects of anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Besides, dry reforming of ethanol and glycerol are emerging technologies that require knowledge and mechanistic insights to design efficient catalysts, reach sustainable syngas manufacturing, and solve the crisis of glycerol as a biodiesel byproduct. However, from the point of view of global syngas production and consumption and the urgency to mitigate CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, the DRG would constitute an almost marginal alternative and DRE results a more promising and attractive approach.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">As an alternative to catalytic dehydrogenation, oxidative dehydrogenation using CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a soft oxidant emerged and strengthened due to several advantages from energetic, thermodynamic and kinetic (rate of reaction, higher alkene selectivity) standpoints, suppressing substrate and product over-oxidation, reducing carbon deposits and consuming CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the main greenhouse gas. Then, oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes has been extensively investigated as an energy-saving and more environmentally friendly strategy to produce alkenes. The use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as a soft oxidant for alkanes ODH involves several advantages to ensure and enhance the catalytic activity due to its ability to activate ODH directly promoting alkane ODH or by a combination of alkane dehydrogenation and RWGS, and thus favouring thermodynamics. In this review, the collected results for EB ODH revealed that high ST selectivity was reached at a good conversion level. Nevertheless, the lifetime of the catalysts has been insufficiently studied and future studies devote more efforts to studying the robustness of catalysts and reactor configurations to achieve and maintain high EB yield and selectivity over a long operating time, combining reaction and regeneration stages. SBA-15 exhibits great potential in contrast to zeolite that despite its better thermal stability and robustness and presents a limitation to efficiently and homogeneously disperse the high amount of metallic oxide due to the diffusion restrictions and the blockage of pores. Regarding ethane ODH, most of the catalysts are CrO<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>-based, implying severe limitations due to the carcinogenicity of chromium species and hazardous catalyst preparation, use and elimination. Besides, 5 wt% Cr/SBA-15/Al<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small>/FeCrAl catalytic performance allowed reaching interesting goals of production and catalyst stability with a good 63% ethylene yield, over 1100 h highlighting the potential of SBA-15 as support. Actually, the catalyst success will depend on catalyst and operation costs, and catalyst stability besides the catalytic performances and features. Propane ODH with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was also reviewed and good catalytic data were reached, although propane selectivity and productivity must be further improved.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The main drawbacks to the photoreduction of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to simple fuel molecules are the narrow absorption range of visible light together with low photoconversion efficiency, which limits the application of these photocatalytic systems.

Moreover, the unique properties of zeolites and OMS make them viable photocatalytic alternatives to sophisticated chemical and semiconductor processes. Their adjustable porous structures have a high surface area that favors a higher light harvesting, a high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption capacity and tunable physicochemical and adsorption/desorption properties that allow the activation of the molecules, providing them with high reaction rate and photocatalytic activity. Moreover, the future synthesis and application of hierarchical zeolites to the development of photocatalysts should be a new breakthrough to improve mass transfer and ensure their development. Future research based on a combination of molecular simulation, machine learning techniques and <span class="italic">in situ</span> spectroscopy should help to determine the reaction mechanism and find the active sites that work to finally establish the structure–activity/selectivity relationship.

      <p class="otherpara">In the present review, we have analyzed the current state of the art in the zeolite- and OMS-based materials activity and opportunities to convert CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into valuable chemicals essential for our daily lives and to pave the way towards reducing carbon footprint.
