By virtue of their relatively recent discovery<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2,3,6,7,10</span></sup></a> and their outstanding physicochemical properties, the study of these contracted porphyrinoids represents a still young but rapidly expanding research area. Subporphyrinoids differ from other porphyrin analogues in the size of the macrocycle, which is composed of three pyrrole or isoindole units, and exclusively coordinate a boron atom within their binding core (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig1">Fig. 1</a>). The boron tetrahedral coordination imposes to these 14 π-electron compounds a characteristic cone-shaped geometry, rendering subporphyrinoids one of the few known examples of non-planar aromatic molecules. As a result, subporphyrinoids exhibit peculiar structural, optical and electronic features which make them intriguing candidates for a wide variety of applications ranging from optoelectronics to biomedicine.</span>

      <p class="otherpara">A comprehensive review on subporphyrinoids was presented by some of us in 2014.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> Since then, an impressive number of publications has been reported dealing with the synthesis, study and application of these fascinating derivatives, which highlight the huge interest of the scientific community in this fervent field. Remarkable progress has been made in the chemistry of SubPcs, which represent the first discovered macrocycles in the family of subporphyrinoids. Novel strategies have been presented for the derivatization of the preformed SubPc macrocycle. Crucial advances have been made in understanding the organization features of SubPcs, and a plethora of SubPcs as dimeric, oligomeric and polymeric systems has been described. The ground- and excited-state interactions of SubPc-based multicomponent systems have been thoroughly investigated, laying the foundations for their implementation in solar energy conversion schemes. Important steps forward have also been made in the application of SubPcs in the biomedical area. In addition, substantial progress has been done in the synthesis and reactivity of the younger SubPs, SubPzs and BzSubPs congeners, and several new analogues have been reported.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Herein, we present a review of the most recent advances in the chemistry of all these contracted porphyrinoids. The first part of the review is dedicated to SubPcs, which constitute by far the most investigated subporphyrinoids. We will first discuss the synthetic procedures for the preparation of SubPcs, which trimeric structure is invariably assembled through boron-templated cyclotrimerization of phthalonitrile derivatives. In addition, we aim at providing an overview of the reactivity of these macrocycles, with a special emphasis on the methodologies for the post-functionalization of the axial and peripheral positions. Then, we will describe the supramolecular organization of SubPcs in the crystalline solid state, as well as in thin films, on surfaces, in solution and in the mesophase. We will next examine all-SubPc as well as hybrid, SubPc-containing multicomponent systems. In this connection, we will give a special focus to the photophysics of donor–acceptor systems based on SubPcs. Finally, we will describe the applications of these subporphyrinoids, with a particular emphasis on their exploitation as molecular materials in organic photovoltaics.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The second part of this review is devoted to SubPs, BzSubPs, SubPzs, as well as their structurally related analogues. In this case, a great assortment of synthetic procedures and starting materials to assemble the very different structures will be described. We will particularly emphasize on the youngest SubPs, since they are by far the subporphyrinoids for which a wider variety of synthetic procedures and post-functionalization methods has been developed. Comparisons between the physicochemical properties of SubPs and those of their better-studied SubPc relatives will be made. We will also describe recent advances in the synthesis of SubP-based multicomponent systems and initial studies on their technological applications, an aspect that remains in its infancy. A comprehensive overview of the chemistry of the SubPz and the subnaphthalocyanine (SubNc) families is also included. Reported for the first time more than 25 years ago, SubNcs have been the object of recent interest for their application in solar technologies.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In summary, the final aim of this review is to bring out the outstanding chemical, structural, optical and electronic features of subporphyrinoids, while providing an updated view of the most promising applications of these fascinating macrocycles.</p>

      <span>SubPcs are aromatic macrocycles composed of three <span class="italic">N</span>-fused 1,3-diiminoisoindole units arranged around a boron atom, which also bears an axial substituent. The 14 π-electron conjugated system of these derivatives is mainly located in the inner ring, whereas the isoindolic benzenes virtually preserve their electronic structure. Hereafter, the X<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small>SubPc–Y notation will be employed to refer to SubPc species, where X and <span class="italic">n</span> indicate the nature and the number of the substituents linked to the isoindolic benzene rings, respectively, and Y stands for the apical ligand (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig2">Fig. 2</a>).

          <span>The main outcomes on SubPc synthesis published during the first four decades after their discovery<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> have been reviewed by some of us in previous works.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,8</span></sup></a> Here, general considerations on SubPc preparation are reported and the major results presented since our last review on SubPcs and other contracted porphyrinoids are discussed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">SubPcs are synthesized through cyclotrimerization reaction of one (or more) phthalonitrile derivative(s) in the presence of a boron-based Lewis acid at high temperatures (generally, above 140 °C) in high-boiling aromatic solvents. To date, no reports have been published on the synthesis of “free-base” SubPcs or SubPc derivatives featuring a central atom different from boron, which preparation constitutes one of the foremost challenges in SubPc chemistry. However, the possibility to incorporate central atoms different from boron within the SubPc core has been widely investigated through theoretical calculations, as will be described in Section 2.3.9.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> constitutes undoubtedly the most employed boron reagents in SubPc synthesis. Although to a lesser extent, BBr<small><sub>3</sub></small> is also quite commonly used for the preparation of SubPc derivatives. Upon reaction of these Lewis acids with a starting phthalonitrile, the corresponding SubPc-Cl and SubPc-Br species are formed, respectively. The reason why BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> constitutes by far the most used boron halide in SubPc synthesis despite its lower reactivity in comparison with BBr<small><sub>3</sub></small> lies in the higher stability of axially chlorinated SubPcs with respect to the corresponding brominated analogues.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Some significant improvements have been introduced in the synthetic methodology for the preparation of SubPc-Cl derivatives since their serendipitous discovery in 1972. For three decades after their first preparation, SubPcs have been mainly synthesised by addition of an excess of BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> – as a condensed liquid or as a solution in low-boiling solvents – to the starting phthalonitrile dissolved in a high-boiling solvent.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> In 2003, a highly efficient method for the preparation of axially chlorinated SubPcs involving the use of <span class="italic">p</span>-xylene solutions of BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> was presented by Torres, Schucmann and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> The general protocol presented in this work consists in the addition of 1 equiv. of BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> from a 1 M solution in <span class="italic">p</span>-xylene to the starting phthalonitrile under argon atmosphere. The reaction mixture is then refluxed for a time depending on the nature of the phthalonitrile precursor (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch1">Scheme 1</a>). This approach presents several advantages over the use of condensed BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small>. First of all, the use of a BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> solution allows to control the stoichiometry of the reagents, thus minimizing side reactions related to the use of large excesses of a strong Lewis acid. In particular, <span class="italic">p</span>-xylene is a very good solvent for precursor phthalonitriles and has a sufficiently high boiling point to allow for its use in SubPc synthesis. Moreover, this solvent can efficiently reduce the chlorine released during the preparation of the SubPc core (please refer to Section 2.1.4 for further details on the mechanism of SubPc formation), preventing the formation of peripherally chlorinated SubPc by-products. Finally, the set-up of the reaction is easier.</p>

        <span>Over the years, SubPcs have proved to constitute a class of extremely versatile compounds in terms of chemical modification of the macrocyclic system. Traditionally, SubPc reactivity has been classified in three main categories, depending on the reactive center and the nature of the target product: (a) axial reactivity, (b) peripheral reactivity and (c) ring-expansion reactions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> In axial and peripheral reactivity, the reactive center consists in the axial B–Y bond and the functional groups linked to the isoindolic benzene rings, respectively. Both maintain the structure of the macrocycle, and result in the formation of functionalized SubPcs. On the other hand, ring expansion reactions, in which the reactive center is constituted by the imine-type SubPc core, determine the loss of the SubPc macrocyclic framework affording low-symmetry Pcs.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Although the preparation of asymmetric Pcs has constituted one of the first applications of SubPcs, the interest in the chemical modification of these macrocycles has been shifted almost completely over the decades to the functionalization of the SubPc axial and peripheral positions. As a matter of fact, the restrictions imposed by the use of boron reagents in SubPc synthesis in terms of variety of both axial and peripheral substituents prompted the development of numerous strategies for the post-functionalization of the preformed macrocycle. Importantly, tailoring the molecular structure of SubPcs permits to tune their physical, photophysical and electrochemical features (see Section 2.3 for further details).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> Moreover, the introduction of proper functionalities allows the control of the organization features of these macrocycles, besides enabling the preparation of dimeric, oligomeric or polymeric SubPc-based structures, as well as the integration of SubPcs in multicomponent systems (see Sections 2.4–2.6). Thus, investigation on novel approaches in SubPc axial and peripheral reactivity is of paramount importance in SubPc chemistry.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Besides these reactivity modes, Sessler, Guldi, Torres and co-workers presented in 2012 a novel type of reactivity in which the SubPc acts as π-ligand towards the arenophilic Ru(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) in the presence of [Cp*Ru(MeCN)<small><sub>3</sub></small>]PF<small><sub>6</sub></small> leading to the formation of ruthenoarene π-complexes of SubPcs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a> Direct functionalization of either the axial phenol moiety or one of the isoindolic benzene rings of the SubPc precursor was found to take place.

        <p class="otherpara">An additional type of reactivity consists in the coordination or protonation of the <span class="italic">meso</span>-nitrogen atoms of the SubPc ring in the presence of Lewis acids or Brønsted acids, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a> Evidence of complexation of the SubPc macrocycle in the presence of boron or aluminum halides as well as H<small><sub>2</sub></small>SO<small><sub>4</sub></small> has been reported by the groups of Bender and Torres.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,65,66</span></sup></a> Recently, the reversible protonation of the azomethine bridge of the SubPc macrocycle in the presence of organic Brønsted acids was studied by Decréau and co-workers through UV-vis, NMR and IR spectroscopic assays.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a> In particular, the number of protonated sites was shown to depend on the p<span class="italic">K</span><small><sub>a</sub></small> of the acid employed as well as on the peripheral substitution pattern of the SubPc, which was argued to regulate the basicity of the <span class="italic">meso</span>-nitrogen atoms.</p>

          <span>Substitution of the axial ligand represents a recurrent method for the functionalization of the SubPc macrocyclic system. The reason why axial reactivity has been thoroughly employed for the derivatization of SubPcs rely on a combination of different factors. First, the reaction protocols for axial substitution reactions are generally simple. Second, modification of the axial ligand permits to preserve the electronic properties of the macrocycle, which are mainly determined by the ring substituents. Third, functionalization of the apical position allows to avoid the synthesis of asymmetrical SubPc. Moreover, the introduction of proper axial functionalities can improve the solubility and stability of SubPc derivatives.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">As a result of the peculiar coordination of the central boron atom, modification of the axial substituent involves reactions that are specific of SubPcs chemistry. In particular, the low reactivity of the tetracoordinated boron atom constitute a major drawback for axial functionalization. Thus, harsh conditions are generally required, which may lead to the decomposition of the macrocyclic system. Nevertheless, efficient methodologies have been developed for axial substitution reactions, which are based on the generation of activated SubPc intermediates that are susceptible to react with a variety of nucleophiles under mild reaction conditions (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch4">Scheme 4</a>).</p>

            <p class="otherpara">An in-depth investigation on the mechanism of the axial ligand exchange reaction between SubPc-Cl derivatives and phenols was reported in 2014 by Torres, Corral, González-Rodríguez and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123</span></sup></a> In this work, a bimolecular σ-bond metathesis mechanism was postulated, in which the phenol assists in weakening the B–Cl bond by proton coordination concomitantly with the formation of the B–O bond. The peculiar chemical environment of the tetracoordinated boron atom in SubPc derivatives justifies such an intriguing mechanism, not common in the chemistry of boron derivatives. Considering the proposed mechanism, a number of experimental and theoretical findings could be rationalized. As a matter of fact, kinetic measurements showed that at low conversions a bimolecular second-order rate equation reliably fits the experimental data. DFT calculations confirmed the predicted individual rate orders, and revealed a double-well reaction profile involving a four-centered bimolecular transition state of the rate-controlling step in which two bonds (B–X and O–H) undergo dissociation and other two bonds (B–O and H–X) undergo formation in a concerted mechanism (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig8">Fig. 8</a>). In addition, the effect of several parameters such as the nature of the SubPc axial and peripheral substituents, the electronic features of the phenol and the characteristics of the solvent on the rate of axial substitution were investigated. The axial ligand exchange reaction rate was found to increase upon changing the axial halogen atom in the order Br &gt; Cl &gt; F and in the presence of electron-donating groups at the SubPc periphery. Moreover, faster axial substitution reactions were detected in the presence of phenols bearing an electron-withdrawing group at the <span class="italic">para</span> position. Regarding solvent effects, increasing polarity resulted in an enhancement of the reaction rate, while the use of coordinating solvents led to slower reactions.</p>

            <p class="otherpara">Based on these results, González-Rodríguez, Torres and co-workers presented in 2015 a novel methodology for axial substitution in SubPc-Cl derivatives based on reaction with TMS-protected nucleophiles, which allows for the efficient introduction of aryloxy substituents at the apical position of the macrocycle (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch7">Scheme 7</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a> In these conditions, a volatile by-product (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> Me<small><sub>3</sub></small>SiCl) is generated, which pushes the equilibrium to the right and simplify the purification of the target SubPc derivatives. Moreover, the TMS functionality decreases the nucleophilicity of the substrate, reducing the generation of side products from SubPc decomposition. Similarly to what observed for the reaction of SubPc-Cl with phenols, in this one-step reaction a bimolecular four-centered transition state is formed, in which the electrophilic TMS functionality plays the role of the phenol proton assisting B–Cl bond dissociation through coordination of the halophilic Si center to the leaving chlorine atom concomitantly with the formation of the new B–Nu bond. As a result, a concerted rupture of the B–Cl and Si–O bonds and formation of the B–O and Si–Cl bonds is observed. Surprisingly, in the case of TMS-protected phenol, DFT calculations revealed an activation barrier higher than in the presence of the unprotected alcohol. Such a finding can be rationalized on the basis of the steric hindrance of the TMS moiety and is responsible for the smaller reaction rates observed in axial substitution reactions with TMS-protected phenol derivatives. On the other hand, in the case of aliphatic alcohols no reaction and/or decomposition or the macrocycle was observed.</p>

          <span>Unlike axial substituents, which usually have no or very little impact on the electronic characteristics of the SubPc macrocycle, peripheral substituents can produce strong perturbations on the system which are reflected on the spectroscopic and electrochemical properties of SubPc derivatives. The harsh conditions required for SubPc synthesis limit the functional groups that can be introduced in the starting phthalonitrile, since many functionalities are incompatible with the boron reagents employed. As a matter of fact, the peripheral groups that can be introduced directly through SubPc synthesis are restricted to halogen atoms, nitro groups, amines, alkyl groups, ethers, thioethers or sulphones. For this reason, chemical modification of the peripheral substituent of the SubPc preformed ring is of paramount importance.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Whereas axial ligand exchange reactions are exclusive of SubPc chemistry, peripheral reactivity involves common organic reactions. Anyway, it is worth to mention that due to the chemical instability of SubPcs, the experimental conditions need to be carefully selected in order to prevent the decomposition of the SubPc macrocycle.

The nature of the axial and peripheral substituents does not practically affect the position of the nitrogen and carbon atoms of the ring, with the exception of slight variations of the bond lengths and bond angles at the level of the Y(N<small><sub>i</sub></small>)<small><sub>3</sub></small> tetrahedron, where Y indicates the apical ligand and N<small><sub>i</sub></small> refers to the isoindolic nitrogen atoms.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> As a general trend, the B–Y bond length increases descending along the halogen series, while it does not practically depend on the peripheral substitution pattern of the macrocycle.

The axial B–O bond length in SubPcs axially substituted with a pentafluorophenoxy ligand also showed minimal variations upon modification of the peripheral substituents. In all the investigated structures, the distances between the boron atom and the planes defined by the inner N atoms and the outer N atoms showed negligible variations. On the other hand, the distance between the boron atom and the plane of the six outer C atoms showed higher perturbations. This evidence was ascribed to π–π and halogen–π interactions in the crystal systems. A similar effect was observed in SubPcs axially functionalized with hydroxy-phenoxy moieties, in which distorted B–O–C angles were detected as a consequence of H-bonding interactions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> The sensitiveness to strong intermolecular interactions of the angle between the apical phenoxy ligand relative and the SubPc macrocycle had previously been observed in the presence of strong halogen bonds.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a></p>

Moreover, the exploitation of the train sublimation technique for the obtention of crystal is of particular interest in view of the potential applications of SubPcs as molecular materials, as it well approximates the vacuum deposition conditions normally employed for the preparation of organic electronic devices.

          <span>Unlike Pcs, which <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR spectra are generally broad due to aggregation issues, SubPcs do not tend to form aggregates in solution. Therefore, their <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR spectra are usually characterized by sharp peaks which chemical shifts do not depend on the concentration of the sample. Due to the diatropic ring current generated by the 14 π-electron aromatic system, the signals of the protons of the isoindolic benzene rings appear at low fields (generally between 7.8 and 9.9 ppm), while the signals of the protons of the axial substituent are shifted upfield with respect to that of the corresponding free ligand. As an example, the axial phenyl group in H<small><sub>12</sub></small>SubPc–Ph gives rise to three signals at 6.63, 6.51 and 5.37 ppm, being the latter the one corresponding to the closest proton to the SubPc core, whereas the signals of the <span class="italic">ortho</span> and <span class="italic">meta</span> protons of the macrocyclic framework appear at 8.78–8.76 and 7.81–7.79 ppm, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a> The axial hydroxy substituent yields a broad signal at −0.58 ppm, while a methoxy group linked to the boron atom gives a signal at 1.50 ppm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">The effect of the diatropic ring current of the macrocycle on the ring substituents allows to differentiate the signals of the protons located “inside” or “outside” the bowl-shaped SubPc framework. For peripherally binaphthyloxy-substituted SubPc <strong>9</strong> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig5">Fig. 5</a>) two sets of peaks were observed for the protons of the ring substituents, as a consequence of the location of the naphthalene rings at both the <span class="italic">endo</span> and the <span class="italic">exo</span> sides of the macrocycle.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> A similar effect was detected in the low-temperature NMR spectrum of a SubPc peripherally substituted with six 2′,6′-di-iso-propylphenoxy moieties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> In the case of SubPc π-complexes featuring a Cp*Ru<small><sup>+</sup></small> unit coordinated to either the concave or the convex face of the macrocycle (<strong>63–66</strong>, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig12">Fig. 12</a>), a notable diatropic effect on the Cp* moiety was observed in the case of the <span class="italic">endo</span>-coordinated compound, while an exceptionally small shift was detected for the <span class="italic">exo</span>-coordinated complex.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">Peripheral substituents influence the chemical shifts of the isoindolic benzene protons in a predictable way, according to their electronic nature. On the contrary, the effect of the axial ligand is not as clear, although differences in the chemical shifts of the isoindolic protons of SubPcs axially substituted with different moieties suggest the existence of a communication between the aromatic macrocycle and the axial substituent.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a> As a matter of fact, the chemical shifts of the aromatic protons of the SubPc macrocycle follow the order <span class="italic">δ</span><small><sub>H</sub></small> (Y<small><sub>B</sub></small> = Br) &gt; <span class="italic">δ</span><small><sub>H</sub></small> (Y<small><sub>B</sub></small> = O) &gt; <span class="italic">δ</span><small><sub>H</sub></small> (Y<small><sub>B</sub></small> = Cl), where represents the atom of the axial substituent directly linked to the boron atom. Notably, the variation of the axial ligand from an alkoxy (Y<small><sub>B</sub></small> = O) to a thioalkoxy (Y<small><sub>B</sub></small> = S) or an amino (Y<small><sub>B</sub></small> = N) moiety does not influence in an appreciable way the chemical shift of the peaks corresponding to the benzo protons.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a> Upon addition of acids, a downfield shift of the signals corresponding to the SubPc benzene rings was reported by Decréau and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a> The protonation of the azomethine bridges was proposed as a possible rationale, although peaks corresponding to iminium-like protonated bridges were not identified.</p>

          <span id="sect1920"/><span class="c_heading_indent">2.3.5 UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. </span>
          <span>The absorption spectra of SubPcs are dominated by two intense bands in the 260–370 nm region and the 460–580 nm region. The absorption at lower wavelengths (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> Soret band or B band) originates from the S<small><sub>0</sub></small> → S<small><sub>2</sub></small> transition, while the absorption at higher wavelengths (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> Q band) is attributable to the S<small><sub>0</sub></small> → S<small><sub>1</sub></small> transition. Shoulders of the Q band associated to vibronic transitions are also commonly observed. Although the overall shape of the UV-vis spectra of SubPcs is similar to that of Pc derivatives, both the B and the Q band are blue-shifted with respect to the corresponding Pc transitions as a consequence of the smaller π-conjugated system (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> 14 π-electrons in SubPcs <span class="italic">vs.</span> 18 π-electrons in Pcs). The molar extinction coefficients (<span class="italic">ε</span>) of the main bands are lower for SubPc than for Pcs, being the <span class="italic">ε</span> value of the SubPc Q band of the order of 5–6 × 10<small><sup>4</sup></small> dm<small><sup>3</sup></small> mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Such a difference in the absorption coefficient of the Q band could be related to the non-planar geometry of the SubPc macrocycle. With some exceptions,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit37"><sup><span class="sup_ref">37,38</span></sup></a> concentration effects on the position and shape of the absorption bands are commonly absent, confirming the low tendency of SubPcs towards aggregation in solution. The effect of SubPc substituents on the absorption characteristics of these macrocycles greatly depends on the functionalization site. A review on the impact of the macrocycle functionalization pattern on the optical properties of SubPcs has been recently reported by Dowds and Nielsen.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit62"><sup><span class="sup_ref">62</span></sup></a> In general, axial ligands do not affect or have a very small effect on the absorption maxima (see for example ref. <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1">1</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32">32</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit110">110</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122">122</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132">132</a> and <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit141">141</a>). On the other hand, peripheral substituents have appreciable effects on the position of the absorption bands. As a matter of fact, in the presence of both electron-donor (see for example ref. <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16">16</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19">19</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20">20</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23">23</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit35">35</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit46">46</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit47">47</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50">50</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51">51</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55">55</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit105">105</a> and <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit118">118</a>) and electron-withdrawing (see for example ref. <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29">29</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32">32</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50">50</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52">52</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80">80</a>, <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit114">114</a> and <a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit122">122</a>) peripheral substituents able to slightly extend the π-conjugation of the macrocycle, the Q band is commonly shifted to higher wavelengths with respect to the perhydrogenated SubPc derivative. When the macrocycle is substituted with π-donor atoms (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur), as in the case of ether-, amino- or thioether-substituted SubPcs, this effect is generally stronger. In this case, the shift to the red of the Q band increases with the π-donating characteristics of the atom linked to the macrocycle and the number of π-donor peripheral substituents. Furthermore, in the presence of alkoxy, sulfonyl, thioether or amino substituents, additional bands in the 400–500 nm region originating from n → π transitions are observed. A red shift of the Q band is observed also in SubPc analogues (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> SubNcs) characterized by an extended conjugated system and in SubPc fused dimers (see Sections 2.5.1 and 4.2).</span>

These variations can be rationalized of the basis of the extension of the π-conjugation of the system.

          <span>Emission spectra of SubPcs are commonly the mirror image of the absorption Q-band.

Such spectral features suggest an only slight geometric distortion between the ground state and the singlet excited state as well as a narrow density of states of the HOMO and LUMO levels. Normally, modulation of solvent polarity does not lead to systematic changes in the position of the absorption and emission maxima, indicating a negligible variation of the dipole moment between the ground state and the singlet excited state. Singlet excited state energies of approximately 2.1–2.0 eV are generally calculated for SubPc derivatives from the intersection between the absorption Q band and the emission band, which are consistent with the HOMO–LUMO gaps calculated from cyclic voltammetry studies. Anyway, lower values have been observed in specific cases (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> in the presence of diphenylamino substituents).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit197"><sup><span class="sup_ref">197</span></sup></a> In general, these values are higher in comparison with those observed for Pcs (around 1.7 eV) and similar to those observed for porphyrins (approximately 2.0 eV).

In the triplet state, the unpaired electrons delocalized in the conjugated ring, and extra stability is supplied by delocalization. In contrast, in the aluminium cation the triplet states are stabilized through metal-centered and ligand-centered separation of unpaired electrons. The longer Al–N bond length and the smaller N–Al–N bond angle in the triplet state with respect with those in the singlet state are a consequence of the metal-centered unpaired electron, while the ligand-centered unpaired electron leads to the odd number of π electrons in the macrocycle in the triplet state. Accordingly, a notable energy relaxation after the first vertical singlet-to-triplet transition was suggested by TDDFT studies. For both the singlet borenium cation and the singlet aluminium cation, the NICS values at ring centers were found to be negative, indicating the aromatic nature of the rings. On the other hand, the NICS values at the inner rings were found to be positive (which indicate the antiaromatic nature of these rings) and the NICS values at outer rings were close to zero (as the unpaired spin density mainly concentrates in the inner part of the macrocycle) for the triplet borenium cation. Nevertheless, the whole macrocycle is apparently antiaromatic. On the contrary, a single aromatic or antiaromatic nature was not supported by NICS values for the triplet aluminium cation.</p>

            <p class="otherpara">In summary, the crystal packing of halo-SubPcs is generally not affected by changing the axial chlorine substituent by bromine. However, the axial fluorine significantly enhances a columnar-type type solid state arrangement with intercolumn connections through B–F⋯π interactions. Changes in the nature and number of peripheral halogen substituents also have an impact on the solid-state organization. Peripheral chlorination enhances π–π interactions, while peripheral fluorination enables a column-like arrangement. The number of peripheral chlorine substituents influences more the solid-state arrangement than the number of peripheral fluorine atoms.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">As peripherally halogenated SubPcs are π-electron deficient molecules, the introduction of axial π-electron donor aryloxy groups favors π-stacking interactions with shorter distances between the axial substituent and the concave face of the macrocycle.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">The organization of SubPcs in columnar assemblies is experiencing an enormous interest as potential ferroelectric and bulk photovoltaic properties are typically developed in polar organic materials. Due to their polar B–Y bond, when SubPcs organize in columnar assemblies, a macroscopic polarization along their longer axis forming polar assemblies is developed, due to the sum of the individual molecular dipoles. However, as mentioned above when discussing the solid-state organization of SubPcs bearing axial fluorine atoms, the columns are arrayed in a more electrostatically stable, antiparallel orientation, thus cancelling the macrodipoles, and giving rise to non-polar crystals. New rational approaches need to be developed to selectively stabilize parallel orientations in columnar assemblies. Very recently, Miyajima and co-workers have developed a strategy based on spin frustration to form SubPc-based polar assemblies, by inducing a trigonal lattice of the columnar organization using <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>-sym bowl-shaped π-systems based on SubPcs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a> For this study, in addition to α-F<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc (<strong>79</strong>) and β-F<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc (<strong>5</strong>), enantiomerically pure <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>-α-F<small><sub>3</sub></small>SubPc (<strong>80</strong>), <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>1</sub></small>-α-F<small><sub>3</sub></small>SubPc (<strong>81</strong>), <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>-β-F<small><sub>3</sub></small>SubPc (<strong>82</strong>) <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>1</sub></small>-β-F<small><sub>3</sub></small>SubPc (<strong>83</strong>) were used. All of them formed one-dimensional columnar assemblies with SubPcs piled up. α-F<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc formed crystals with a trigonal lattice with all SubPcs oriented in the same direction in the crystal by forming a 3D-hydrogen bonding network between fluorine and hydrogen atoms (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19</a>). The six fluorine and six hydrogen atoms of α-F<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc-F form H-bonds with SubPcs located obliquely up and down, respectively, resulting in stagger-like arrangements of macrocycles. Similarly, the other α-F<small><sub>3</sub></small>SubPcs, regardless of the number of fluorine atoms (3 or 6), molecular symmetry (<span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>1</sub></small> or <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>) and chirality (racemic or chiral) formed the same polar crystals. In contrast, all the SubPcs having fluorine atoms at β-positions, such as β-F<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc, formed nonpolar assemblies with antiparallel orientation of the SubPc columns due to stronger F–F interactions. Interestingly, it was noticed that β-substituted SubPc-F derivatives possess superior bowl stacking ability than the α-substituted analogues, which results in antiparallel packing. Indeed, remarkable differences in the π–π distances between the SubPcs when comparing the polar (3.74 Å) and non-polar (3.53 Å) assemblies may account for this behavior that can be explained considering the differences in the bowl depths. Therefore, the formation of polar assemblies with <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>-sym bowl-shaped molecules based on SubPcs can be induced by enhancing the <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>-sym intermolecular interaction and reducing the bowl-stacking nature.</p>

Neither thermal nor solvent annealing post-treatments proved very effective to tune the morphology of solution processed SubPc films until Lin and Ma developed a post-treatment approach capable of introducing molecular ordering (or crystallization) in solution processed organic semiconductor thin films, through a thermal imprint process (or thermal annealing under mechanical gauge pressure).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">183</span></sup></a> In particular, they have shown that large area phase change from amorphous to crystalline morphology for solution processed 2-allylphenoxySubPc (<strong>84</strong>) thin films can be realized by thermal imprint with a flat mold.

          <span>In electronic devices, molecules are in contact with metal surfaces. Therefore, understanding the interactions taking place in such metal–organic semiconductor interfaces is crucial for improving device performance. For that, firstly, it is important to study the adsorption process, then the growth mechanism, and finally the characterization of the ordered molecular arrays formed on the metal substrates, often inferred by spectroscopic techniques.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Different metal/molecule forces, such as dipole interaction, charge transfer, and van der Waals bonding, occur with similar magnitude, making quite unpredictable the resulting thin film structure upon molecular adsorption on different types of metal substrates. Substrate chemical identity plays the most relevant effect on the absorption process. Secondly, the structural diversity of organic semiconductors may be considered.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">For instance, dipolar non-planar semiconductors such as SubPc-Cl derivatives tend to flatten when deposited on metal surfaces. Moreover, their cone-shape results in different adsorbate configurations that have been classified as “Cl-up” (with the axial chlorine atom facing vacuum), or “Cl-down” (with chlorine atom pointing towards the substrate). These two configurations differ on the conductance at the molecular center, producing two different STM contrasts.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Although the first SubPc-Cl deposition was described by Yanagi in 2000 on a Si(111) substrate,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit252"><sup><span class="sup_ref">252</span></sup></a> most of the work has been performed on Cu, Au and Ag metal surfaces to yield highly ordered 2D-arrays.

            <span>Studies reported by Monti in 2016<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit253"><sup><span class="sup_ref">253</span></sup></a> have shown that at low coverage, only two types of contrasts are observed by low-temperature STM, independently on the tip–surface voltage (from −2.5 V to +0.5 V). Molecules of type I exhibit a bright center while for type II the conductance increasing in the molecular center is much less pronounced (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21a</a>). When the two most widely proposed configurations, that is, molecules with chlorine atoms protruding toward vacuum (“Cl-up”, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21b</a>), and molecules with chlorine atoms oriented toward the substrate (“Cl-down”, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21b</a>) were simulated by DFT, the results indicated that Cl-up configuration results in the most stable adsorbate geometry, with an adsorption energy of −3.56 eV, and a simulated STM image that is remarkably similar to those observed for type I molecules. Moreover, the simulations revealed that the proposed Cl-down configuration does not form readily on the surface, showing a small adsorption energy of only −0.60 eV. Intriguingly, the simulated STM images in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig21">Fig. 21</a> for the Cl-down configuration look profoundly different from either the type I or the type II molecules observed in the experimental images, suggesting a different nature of the type II configuration. In fact, results were interpreted as a surface-catalysed dechlorination, yielding “DeCl-up” molecules. Simulated DeCl-up molecules show a height increase in the center of the molecule, which is in good agreement with the experimentally determined constant current images for adsorbate type II. It is worthy to point out that no evidence for dechlorination prior to adsorption was found. Indeed, dechlorination of SubPc-Cl is reported to occur in solution, in particular, when nucleophilic solvents and SubPcs bearing peripheral electron-donating groups are employed, because they lead to the formation of a more stable borenium cation. In this case, the Cu(111) can play the same role, acting as an electron donating pool that partially stabilizes the borenium cation formed by dechlorination of the SubPc-Cl molecule.</span>

            <p class="otherpara">The consequences of strong coupling between polar adsorbates such as SubPc-Cl and Cu(111) on the self-assembly at the surface have also been studied. The combination of photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) and LT-STM can help to understand these interfaces. UPS measures the work function changes of a system upon surface/molecule interactions. Monti has observed that SubPc-Cl undergoes a significant charge transfer upon adsorption on Cu(111) since a newly filled <span class="italic">f</span>-LUMO located at the Fermi level was observed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit250"><sup><span class="sup_ref">250</span></sup></a> This charge transfer state is interface specific and related to the “Cl-up” orientation of the molecule on the surface. The same author has also studied the origin of the strong electronic coupling between SubPc-Cl and Cu(111), which seems to arise from a planarization of the macrocycle upon adsorption on the surface, driven by strong of van der Waals interactions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit254"><sup><span class="sup_ref">254</span></sup></a> Under these conditions, the macrocycle loses it peculiar cone-shape geometry and recovers a 94% of planarity, becoming a disk with trigonal pyramidal feature. Moreover, the electronic structure of SubPc-Cl become metallic due to the strong hybridization between molecule and metal states occurring in conjunction with electron transfer from the substrate to adsorbate. In fact, the strong-coupling regime can be reached only provided that the molecule significantly changes its shape, which is shown to be a consequence of van der Waals forces pulling it toward the surface.</p>

In contrast, molecules without a bright center are assumed to adopt the Cl-down binding configuration with the molecule's axial chorine atom pointing toward the substrate.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">According to Jiang's studies, these two configurations are roughly equivalent in their prevalence, in line with the small difference of 0.09 eV between these two binding configurations on their calculated adsorption energies, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>up</sub></small> = 0.19 eV <span class="italic">vs. E</span><small><sub>down</sub></small> = 0.10 eV. DFT simulation identified the interstices of the topmost layer of the Ag(100) substrate as the preferred binding sites for SubPc. The highly dense SubPc layer on Ag(100) can be viewed as stacked chains of molecules mechanically interlocked (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23</a>), resulting in a zipper-like pattern, different than the honeycomb-like patterns reported before on Ag(111)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit256"><sup><span class="sup_ref">256</span></sup></a> and Au(111).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit257"><sup><span class="sup_ref">257</span></sup></a> Moreover, the SubPc molecules seem to be slightly tilted with respect to the Ag(100) substrate, making the isoindole lobes between adjacent chains closer to the substrate than those interlocked along the same chain. SubPc molecules within the “zipper” pattern are seen to be aligned with the lattice direction of the Ag(100) single crystal. The interactions between either individual molecules or SubPc islands with the underlying Ag(100) are relatively weak, as concluded from Tip-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (TERS) and SERS experiments. TERS has been shown to be an effective tool for interfacial characterization of nanoscale molecular systems, since small shifts of a vibrational peak are due to strong molecule–substrate coupling.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit258"><sup><span class="sup_ref">258</span></sup></a> The vibrational spectra exhibit no discernible differences in peak position and/or intensity between the Cl-up and Cl-down binding configurations. The B–Cl bond-stretching mode should be much more susceptible to frequency shift than others, due to the plausibly strong coupling between the Ag(100) substrate and the highly polarizable chlorine atom of SubPc regardless of its binding configuration. Moreover, the intermolecular interactions between SubPc molecules within an island on the Ag(100) substrate are also relatively weak. Otherwise, the strong couplings between SubPc molecules would have notably deviated their vibrational frequencies from those for an isolated molecule. Both molecule–substrate and molecule–molecule interactions are rather weak for the self-assembled SubPc layer on Ag(100).</p>

          <span>Supramolecular columnar assemblies of π-conjugated disc-like molecules are suitable materials for optoelectronics because they are hold by π–π interactions between molecular components, that facilitates the contact between their π-surfaces and, therefore, the efficient exciton and charge transport along the column axis. In particular, discotic molecules forming spontaneous columnar liquid crystals have been extensively studied. In those assemblies van der Waals forces between the aliphatic chains contribute to stabilizing the organized columnar mesophase, in addition to π-stacking. SubPcs are peculiar molecules with bowl-shape geometry, always bearing an axial substituent. Therefore, their organization in columnar liquid crystalline phases requires SubPcs bearing small axial ligands (typically fluorine) which can stack in a head-to-tail fashion. The resulting columnar assemblies present some additional features, that is, they are non-centrosymmetric due to the intrinsic <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small> symmetry of the components. In addition, these assemblies are polar, if we consider that all the polar B–Cl or B–F bonds may be oriented in the same direction within the column. The non-centrosymmetric head to-tail or convex-to-concave columnar organization, with a permanent axial dipole moment observed for SubPcs, induces a macroscopic polarization that can result in electric-field-responsive polar materials.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit259"><sup><span class="sup_ref">259</span></sup></a></span>

            <span>Nonplanar molecules such as SubPcs are reluctant toward aggregation, especially if they bear bulky substituents at the axial position. This has been so far the basis of their applications in organic optoelectronics. Nevertheless, the aggregation of bowl-shaped polar molecules in columnar stacks that can interact with electric fields is quite challenging, since they can generate polarly ordered materials exhibiting switchable (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, ferroelectric) or permanent polarization, as well as anisotropic charge transport.</span>

The presence of a strongly polar axial B–F bond additionally reinforces convex–concave association due to dipole–dipole interactions. Detailed aggregation studies were carried out by monitoring UV-vis absorption, emission, and CD spectral changes as a function of temperature, concentration and solvent nature. Whereas both <strong>87a</strong> and <strong>87b</strong> show a Q band absorption at 580 nm as monomers, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig24">Fig. 24b and c</a> show the different spectral changes experienced by both monomers as a function of the volume fraction of dioxane (<span class="italic">χ</span><small><sub>D</sub></small>) in a MCH solution (3.2 × 10<small><sup>−5</sup></small> M, <span class="italic">T</span> = 20 °C). <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig24">Fig. 24c</a> clearly shows a critical solvent composition in which polymerization of SubPc <strong>87b</strong> is abruptly triggered, with a clear isosbestic point at 528 nm.

In addition, SubPc <strong>87b</strong> is a <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small>-symmetric chiral molecule, whose enantiomers (<span class="italic">P</span> and <span class="italic">M</span>) can be easily separated by HPLC. Aggregation studies were carried out for each isolated enantiomer by UV-vis absorption, emission, and CD spectroscopies, indicating the formation of homochiral non-centrosymmetric columns (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig25">Fig. 25</a>). Specifically, compound <strong>87b</strong> displayed blue-shifted absorption (Q band at 518 nm whereas the monomer absorbs at 580 nm), a significantly quenched emission, and a remarkably different CD spectrum upon aggregation, which is a mirror image for each enantiomer. In addition, hydrogen bonding between the exocyclic amide groups was confirmed by <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Interestingly, important differences were observed when comparing the absorption changes at 580 nm as a function of temperature for the racemic mixture of <strong>87b</strong> and that of its <span class="italic">P</span> or <span class="italic">M</span> enantiomers, indicating that the racemic stacks are substantially more stable than the homochiral stacks obtained from the individual enantiomers. These results can only be explained considering a clear preference for heterochiral head-to-tail binding in the self-assembly of racemic <strong>87b</strong>. Quantum chemical calculation studies additionally shed light to understand the cooperative character and the chiral self-sorting for this self-association process. It was found that the optimal peripheral amide conformation in enantiomer <span class="italic">P</span> of SubPc <strong>87b</strong> leading to the most stable homochiral right-handed (<span class="italic">P</span>) helical stack, is the one named <span class="italic">anti</span>-in, with the carbonyl dipole aligned antiparallel to the axial SubPc B–F bond, and in orientation with respect to the isoindole ring, in order to both maximize the intermolecular H-bonding and minimise the net dipole moment of the assembly. In the stacks, neighbouring molecules are separated by 4.12 Å and rotated by 23.08°, establishing that 16 molecules are necessary to complete one helical pitch. In addition, The F<small><sup><span class="italic">δ</span>−</sup></small>⋯B<small><sup><span class="italic">δ</span>+</sup></small> contacts between adjacent molecules are calculated to measure 2.78 Å, which are significantly shorter than the sum of the van der Waals radii of boron (1.92 Å) and fluorine (1.47 Å), that evidencing the contribution of the strong dipolar interaction between B–F dipoles along the stacks. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26</a>, as the columnar stack grows, the H-bonding network strengthens and the aggregate becomes more stable, suggesting a cooperative character to the self-assembly of SubPc <strong>87b</strong><span class="italic">P</span> in non-polar solvents. Moreover, these studies reproduced the experimental CD of a right-handed trimer made of three <span class="italic">P</span> enantiomers of SubPc <strong>87b</strong> with an <span class="italic">anti</span>-in conformation. Theoretical calculations also helped to understand the reason why pure enantiomers (<span class="italic">M</span> and <span class="italic">P</span>) self-associate with itself forming homochiral columns, whereas an alternate stacking of <span class="italic">P</span> and <span class="italic">M</span> enantiomers is favoured from racemic samples. The formation of a helical heterochiral supramolecular polymer was found to be energetically favored against a homochiral polymer to maximize core-to-core contacts of head-to-tail heterochiral stacks, thus in agreement with the self-discrimination process experimentally observed.</p>

            <span>Liquid crystalline behaviour of SubPcs bearing at their peripheral positions six long alkyl chains ranging from 10 to 18 carbon atoms was reported years ago, provided that they contain a relatively small axial chlorine substituent.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit261"><sup><span class="sup_ref">261</span></sup></a> Transition from mesophase to isotropic liquid occurred at <span class="italic">ca.</span> 90 °C.

Semiempirical calculations showed that aggregation within a column is not only driven by dispersion or van der Waals forces, but also by strong F⋯B dipolar interactions between adjacent SubPcs. Therefore, the axial, highly electronegative fluorine atom was key to obtain a stable head-to-tail non-centrosymmetric columnar stacking with a strong axial dipole (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig27">Fig. 27b</a>). A second harmonic generation (SHG) signal was observed in the mesophase when the material was cooled down from the isotropic liquid under a DC field. This SHG response was preserved after turning off the field and maintained at room temperature for several weeks without appreciable degradation, indicating that the material has a macroscopic polar axis along the direction of the field. However, SHG interferometry showed that the liquid crystal sample is permanently polarized once formed, but it is not electrically invertible. In other words, the mesophase is not ferroelectric but pyroelectric. The only way to invert the polarization of the material is to heat back to the isotropic phase, and cool down again by applying an electric field in the opposite sense (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig27">Fig. 27c</a>).</span>

Therefore, authors tried to keep the columnar order of the mesophase while adding a nonpolar solvent that would be incorporated within the columns, hence weakening the intermolecular forces between SubPcs. Indeed, a 10 wt% (3.4 × 10<small><sup>−2</sup></small> M) SubPc <strong>87</strong> solution in dodecane formed amphitropic columnar LCs that are stable at room temperature.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> POM and X-ray diffraction studies indicated the formation of a columnar nematic N<small><sub>Col</sub></small> lyotropic mesophase which, as other nematic mesophases, has shown an electro-optic response.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">A polar switching was confirmed by texture observations and SHG methods. When an electric field of 10 V μm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was applied, a black texture could be observed between crossed polarizers, which was retained for at least several minutes when the electric field was turned off. Moreover, a molecular reorientation occurred when voltage was inverted, reappearing the brown texture. In line with these results, strong SHG signals were observed when the sample was subjected to an electric field, which saturate for fields in the range of 10 V mm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, indicating that the material has a macroscopic polar axis along the field direction. A remanent polarization (<span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>r</sub></small>) of <span class="italic">ca.</span> 0.13 mC cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> was calculated. To further confirm the switching process, SHG interferometry experiments were carried out, showing that positive and negative fields induced opposite polarities in the sample. Therefore, this material was considered as the first nematic columnar ferroelectric phase. Taking into account that bowl inversion of SubPc <strong>87</strong> within the columns is not likely to occur, authors have speculated that the SubPc columns might disassemble into shorter columns that could move from up to down and invert their macrodipoles upon field application (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig27">Fig. 27</a>).</p>
            <p class="otherpara">More recently, the problem of the high temperature required to melt the mesophase of SubPc <strong>87</strong> was circumvented by applying an external field of <span class="italic">ca.</span> 30 V μm<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at 130–140 °C, for about 20 min, which resulted in a high degree of homeotropic alignment.

Simultaneous switching of polarization and conductivity measurements of devices based on LCs of SubPc <strong>87</strong> sandwiched between gold electrodes, indicated a polarization reversal when the externally applied electric field passed the coercive field, as well as a strong rectifying behavior at low voltages. The experiments displayed a remarkable hysteresis behavior in the current–voltage (<span class="italic">j</span>–<span class="italic">V</span>) loop which is attributed to a bulk conductivity modulation.

            <span>The preparation of SubPc fused dimers <strong>90</strong> from tetrafluorophthalonitrile presents several advantages such as: (i) it provides good solubility to the final macrocycle, (ii) its symmetry allows an easier NMR characterization, and (iii) it forms stable derivatives. Very few other peripheral substituents such as halogens, thioether, and phenoxy groups have been incorporated into fused SubPc dimers, all of them with lower yields.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit187"><sup><span class="sup_ref">187,267–270</span></sup></a> The synthetic methods, summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, are very similar, only differing in the excess of phthalonitrile acting as peripheral unit employed, and the addition or not of <span class="italic">o</span>-DCB as reaction co-solvent. Most probably, either the lack of stability and/or solubility of the intermediates or final products might be the reason for the remarkable different yields, which are also summarized in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. In some cases, these problems could be overcome by performing a subsequent substitution of the axial chlorine atoms by a phenoxy group on the reaction crude (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, method A + D) in order to obtain stable and soluble products, amenable of being purified by column chromatography, size exclusion chromatography or recycling preparative HPLC. The latter was, for instance, the approach for preparing (SubPc)<small><sub>2</sub></small><strong>91</strong> bearing peripheral octylthioether groups.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267,268</span></sup></a> Whereas the chlorinated axial derivates decomposed on silica gel, the corresponding <span class="italic">tert</span>-butylphenoxy derivatives were obtained in 16% yield after purification by column chromatography. On the other hand, the reduced symmetry of the 4-iodophthalonitrile precursor led to the formation of a SubPc dimer <strong>92</strong> as a complex mixture of 14 isomers, which was difficult to characterize.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267,268</span></sup></a><a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a> also indicates the cases in which the corresponding topoisomers <span class="italic">syn</span> and <span class="italic">anti</span> were separated.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">Peripheral substitution showed a very strong effect on the absorption bands of dimers (see <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). In particular, electron-donating octylthioether substituents (as in <strong>91</strong>), led to a Q band absorption centered at 739 nm, which is red-shifted by around 45 nm with respect to perfluoro-substituted compound <strong>90</strong>.</p>

            <span>Apart from benzene, there are scarce examples of other aromatic units have been introduced as the fused bridge shared by the two SubPcs, the reason being the difficult preparation of the corresponding tetracyano-precursors. Thus, Kobayashi and Shimizu reported in 2016 the pyrene-bridged dimer <strong>96</strong> by cross-condensation of 2,7-di-<span class="italic">tert</span>-butyl-4,5,9,10-tetracyanopyrene and tetrafluorophthalonitrile.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> Similar to the case of benzene-bridged SubPc dimers, the two isomers <span class="italic">syn</span> and <span class="italic">anti</span>, arising from the connection manner to the two bowl-shaped SubPc units were equally formed and separated. Both showed very similar spectroscopic features, so that the final configuration assignment was performed by X-ray crystallographic analysis. In fact, the <span class="italic">syn</span> configuration of dimer <strong>96</strong> was unambiguously determined by growing co-crystals of <span class="italic">syn</span>-<strong>96</strong> and C<small><sub>60</sub></small>, which is embraced by the large convex–convex π-surface of the SubPc dimer. The absorption spectrum of both topoisomers of compound <strong>96</strong> exhibited a Q band at 610 nm in CHCl<small><sub>3</sub></small>, that is, shifted to the red and broadened relative to the SubPc monomers. However, it is remarkably blue-shifted relative to the Q band of SubPc dimers <strong>90b</strong> (at 690 nm), indicating a smaller electronic interaction of the SubPc unit through the pyrene bridge.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">In 2015 Kobayashi reported a peculiar pseudofused SubPc dimer (<strong>97</strong>) in which two SubPc units were fused to the two benzene rings of a [2.2]paracyclophane.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> Since two sp<small><sup>3</sup></small>-hybridized ethylene bridges are linking two benzene units, they are neither linear and π-conjugated. However, owing to the small distance (less than 3 Å) between them, through-space transannular interactions have been demonstrated in this type of SubPc dimers that are coined as Subphthalocyaninophanes. As a consequence of the [2.2]paracyclophane two-layer topology, standard cyclotrimerization of 4,5,12,13-tetracyano-[2.2]paracyclophane with an excess of tetrafluoro-phthalonitrile in the presence of boron trichloride, followed by substitution of axial chlorine by phenol, afforded a mixture of three isomers that differ in the orientation of the convex and concave surfaces of the SubPc units with respect to the paracyclophane moiety, namely, the concave–concave (CC), the convex–concave (CV), and the convex–convex (VV) isomers (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a>). Monomeric <span class="italic">endo</span> and <span class="italic">exo</span> cyclophaneSubPcs formed by cyclomerization of only one phthalonitrile subunit were also isolated. Interestingly, the higher yields of VV and <span class="italic">exo</span> derivatives, as compared to those of CC and <span class="italic">endo</span>, are indicative of preferential formation of the less sterically hindered compounds with the adjacent moiety residing on the exo side of the SubPc unit. In the <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR spectra, the chemical shifts of the cyclophane hydrogen atoms (sharing unit) are consistent with the orientation of each SubPc unit with respect to the cyclophane bridge in each isomer, that is, depending if they are facing the concave or the convex face. In any case they never reach the downfield shifted values of SubPc dimers sharing a benzene ring (around 10 ppm), indicating the lack of π-conjugation. These protons experience the largest upfield shift (by 3.92 ppm) with respect to those of unsubstituted [2.2]paracyclophane in isomer CC, as a consequence of a strongest diatropic ring current on the endo side. Owing to their presence on both <span class="italic">endo</span> and <span class="italic">exo</span> sides, the signals of the cyclophane hydrogen atoms appear at 6.48 and 2.38 ppm in the case of CV. In contrast with the previously reported SubPc fused dimer <strong>90a</strong>, the Q-band of all Subphthalocyaninophane dimer isomers were centered at <span class="italic">ca.</span> 594 nm, experiencing very small redshift with respect to those of SubPc-cyclophane monomers (8 nm) and with respect to regular SubPcs (and 20 nm). The latter can be rationalized considering a small through-space expansion of the conjugated systems through the cyclophane bridge. Moreover, CV and VV isomers exhibited a broadening and a decrease in intensity of the Q band, and in the case of VV, the Q-band absorption split into two peaks at 617 and 593 nm.</p>

            <span>Replacement of axial halogen atoms of SubPc dimers with phenols allowed the preparation of more stable and soluble derivatives. Most authors made it by refluxing the crude product from the mixed condensation reaction of phthalonitriles with phenol or 4-<span class="italic">tert</span>-butylphenol in toluene for 16–24 hours (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>, method A + D).

Similar to what is observed in SubPcs, axial substitution by phenoxy groups causes only a very small blue-shift in the Q band absorption of SubPc fused dimers. The phenol groups in the axial position not only provide increased solubility and stability to SubPcs and SubPc fused dimers, but they can also be a tool for the assignment of the <span class="italic">syn</span> and <span class="italic">anti</span> topologies by means of <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR spectroscopy.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265</span></sup></a> The aromatic signals corresponding to the axial <span class="italic">tert</span>-butylphenol appear at 5.2–5.5 and 6.7–6.9 ppm in all dimers (<strong>90c</strong>, <strong>91</strong> and <strong>92</strong>). The signals at 5.2–5.5 ppm, corresponding to the protons that are closer to the π-surface of the SubPc moiety, were employed as probes for the assignment of each topoisomer. While in the <span class="italic">anti</span> isomer the chemical shifts of the aromatic phenolic protons are very similar to those of the corresponding SubPc, in the <span class="italic">syn</span> isomer the proximity of the axial groups (less than 3 Å) and their resulting interaction shift significantly the signals with respect to those of the SubPc (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 0.2 ppm).</span>
            <p class="otherpara">Interestingly, when 3-hydroxybenzaldehyde was used as axial ligand to prepare <strong>90d</strong>, only the corresponding <span class="italic">syn</span>-diformyl topoisomer was obtained in overall 5% yield.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit271"><sup><span class="sup_ref">271</span></sup></a> Even more surprisingly, only decomposition products could be observed when the axial substitution was carried out from pure dichloro <span class="italic">anti</span> isomer <strong>90a</strong>, while in the case of the <span class="italic">syn</span> topoisomer, axial substitution proceeded with 47% yield starting from pure <span class="italic">syn</span> dichloroSubPc <strong>90a</strong>.</p>

The <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR spectra of <span class="italic">syn</span>-<strong>99</strong> in CDCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> showed the diagnostic singlets at high chemical shifts around 10.50 ppm corresponding to the protons of the central benzene ring of the SubPc fused dimer unit. The appearance of more than one singlet indicates the formation of different stereoisomers, <span class="italic">rac</span> and <span class="italic">meso</span>, depending on the mutual relative orientation of the two axial ethynyl-SubPcs linked to each boron atom of the SubPc dimer platform. Signals corresponding to these axial SubPc fragments, in particular those of the benzene units closer to the concave face of the SubPc fused dimer, are significantly upfield shifted (0.7 ppm) owing to the well-stablished influence of the anisotropic ring current of the aromatic SubPc dimer surface. UV-vis absorption spectra of SubPc-SubPc dimer hybrids <span class="italic">syn</span>-<strong>99</strong> and <span class="italic">anti</span>-<strong>99</strong> in chloroform are basically defined as the sum of their macrocyclic components. Both compounds feature the characteristic Q band maximum of the perfluorinated SubPc dimer unit at 696 nm, with a number of less intense shoulders at higher energy, followed by the Q band of the octysulfanyl-substituted SubPc units peaking at 596 nm. The high intensity of this band, approximately doubling that of SubPc monomer, supports the presence of two units of SubPc per unit of SubPc dimer in the final structure of <span class="italic">anti/syn</span>-<strong>99</strong>.</p>

            <span>The preparation of SubPc fused dimers with different peripheral substituents at each SubPc half implying the cross-condensation of 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene and two different phthalonitriles, would probably lead to complex reaction mixtures.

In particular, condensation of di(<span class="italic">tert</span>-butyl)-substituted SubPc <strong>41</strong> with 4,5-dichlorophthalonitrile in the presence of BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> proceeded in 16% yield to provide the unsymmetrical dimer <strong>98</strong> using an optimized SubPc/phthalonitrile/BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> ratio of 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>4<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>6. The alternative experimental procedure that imply first the activation of 4,5-phthalonitrile and then, the addition of a solution of dicyano-SubPc <strong>41</strong> in <span class="italic">p</span>-xylene, resulted more convenient. In this case, although the starting dicyano-SubPc <strong>41</strong> was bearing a <span class="italic">p-tert</span>-butylphenoxy group as axial substituent, the final dimer was isolated as a dichloro derivative, probably due to the excess of BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> employed.

In particular, dimers <strong>103–105</strong> were prepared in 36%, 40%, and 43% yield, respectively, by treating equimolar amounts of SubPc-OH <strong>56</strong> with the corresponding SubPc-Halo, namely F<small><sub>12</sub></small>SubPc-Br, Cl<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc-Cl, or Cl<small><sub>12</sub></small>SubPc-Cl, in the presence of K<small><sub>3</sub></small>PO<small><sub>4</sub></small> in 1,2-dichlorobenzene at 180 °C for 1 hour. One of the peculiar properties of these SubPc derivatives is their high solubility in a broad range of solvents. On the other hand, whereas the electrochemical properties of these oxygen-bridged SubPc dimers are not very different to those of related SubPc-Halo derivatives, the absorption and fluorescence properties are remarkably different. Thus, their UV-vis spectra display a Q band absorption with a noticeable blue shift and broadening in comparison with those of the corresponding SubPc monomers.

The introduction of reactive functionalities, such as iodo, in the aniline substituent opens the door to the incorporation of these μ-azo SubPc compounds in multicomponent systems of higher complexity. UV-vis absorption and emission spectra of the nitrogen-bridged SubPcs <strong>107–110</strong> were registered in different solvents at room temperature to evaluate any solvent polarity effects. As in the case of the oxygen-bridged SubPc dimers, they exhibit blue shifted and significantly broadened Q band absorptions (<span class="italic">λ</span><small><sub>max</sub></small> (<strong>109</strong>) = 560 nm; <span class="italic">λ</span><small><sub>max</sub></small> (<strong>107</strong>) = 548 nm) with respect to the corresponding monomeric SubPc-Cl.

Apart from particular differences, the effect of the bridging atom (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> N <span class="italic">vs.</span> O) does not seem to influence significantly the electronic properties of these SubPc derivatives.</p>

            <span>By far, reaction between SubPc-Cl species and an excess of phenols in refluxing toluene or other high-boiling aromatic solvents has been the most recurrent way to prepare multicomponent SubPc-based systems in which a SubPc is axially linked to other unit(s). As mentioned in Section 2.2.1.1, this procedure requests an excess of phenol, therefore, the preparation of dimers or trimers from benzene-diols or benzene-triols turns out more challenging than it looks at first glance. One strategy for the preparation of these derivatives consists in the one-step reaction of the hydroxylated unit with the chlorinated SubPc precursors, which directly affords the target product (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>, method A). An alternative approach involves the formation of a 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 intermediate featuring one SubPc unit linked to the nucleophile through one of the OH functionalities, and the subsequent reaction of the remaining unreacted hydroxyl group with other SubPc units (method B, <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>).</span>

            <p class="otherpara">As a result of the diamagnetic ring currents from the two SubPc units in the dimer, the <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR resonances of the linking hydroquinone moiety, around 5 ppm, showed considerable upfield shifts, larger than the ones of axial phenoxy substituents in SubPcs. It is also noticeable the sensitivity of hydroquinone bridge resonance to the peripheral substitution of the SubPc components. In the case of the unsymmetrical dimer <strong>27<span class="italic">p</span></strong>, the hydroquinone bridge showed two different proton signals as two doublets between 4.83 and 4.73 ppm.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Concerning the absorption properties, the UV-vis spectra showed similar Q band maxima to the SubPc-phenoxy derivatives, and quite different to the corresponding μ-oxo dimers, indicating a low degree of interaction between the SubPc components. Differences caused by the <span class="italic">ortho</span>-, <span class="italic">meta</span>- and <span class="italic">para</span>-hydroquinone substitutions were not observed. In the UV-vis spectra of heterodimers, two absorption peaks, irrespective of the solvent and concentration, were observed in Q band region, suggesting that each SubPc unit absorbs light independently. Fluorescence quantum yields (<span class="italic">Φ</span><small><sub>F</sub></small>) of 0.32 and 0.33, respectively, were calculated for homodimers <strong>24</strong><span class="italic">ortho</span>- and <span class="italic">para</span>-in dioxane upon excitation at 530 nm. On the other hand, <span class="italic">meta</span>-homodimer <strong>24<span class="italic">m</span></strong> showed a higher fluorescence quantum yield (<span class="italic">Φ</span><small><sub>F</sub></small> = 0.52) in dioxane, indicating that electronic communication between the SubPc moieties of dimers linked at <span class="italic">ortho</span>- and <span class="italic">para</span>-positions is stronger than that between the dimers linked at <span class="italic">meta</span> positions. In the case of heterodimers <strong>28</strong>, their fluorescence decreased significantly in dioxane. In particular, fluorescence peaks at 570 nm are more significant quenched than those around 616 nm, which implies energy/electron transfer from the H-SubPc moiety to the TFEO-SubPc moiety. <span class="italic">Φ</span><small><sub>F</sub></small> values of <span class="italic">ortho</span>-linked SubPc dimer <strong>28<span class="italic">o</span></strong> displayed a more important decrease, probably implying that, in addition to regular through-bonding electron transfer, a through-space electron transfer process due to the closer proximity of the two electronically different SubPc components takes place.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR spectra of trimer <strong>30</strong> showed unique peaks at 2.6, 2.8 and 2.9 ppm corresponding to three protons of the central benzene ring which are strongly shielded by the diatropic magnetic currents of the three different SubPc moieties. This suggests an independent absorption of each SubPc component, which is not influenced by their SubPc neighbour. On the other hand, the steady-state fluorescence spectra of trimer <strong>30</strong> show quenched peaks suggesting energy transfer from H<small><sub>12</sub></small>SubPc to F<small><sub>12</sub></small>SubPc <span class="italic">via</span> TFEO-substituted SubPc units, and/or directly from the H<small><sub>12</sub></small>SubPc to the F<small><sub>12</sub></small>SubPc units.</p>

They were prepared using method A (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>) by treating SubPc-Cl <strong>20</strong> with the corresponding bis-hydroxyazobenzenes.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24,127</span></sup></a> Single crystals of <strong>116</strong> show the azobenzene moiety is highly planar in a <span class="italic">trans</span> configuration. The UV-vis absorption spectrum of triad <strong>117</strong> in DMF shows the standard profile of SubPc absorption spectra: a B band at <span class="italic">ca.</span> 300 nm and a Q band in the 550–600 nm region. In addition, a shoulder is observed in the 357 nm region, corresponding to the azobenzene π–π* transition. More interestingly, the photoisomerization of <strong>116</strong> was studied in dilute DMF solutions. Conversion of the <span class="italic">trans</span> isomer to a <span class="italic">cis</span> rich photostationary state was accomplished through irradiation with a 365 nm light. The <span class="italic">cis</span>/<span class="italic">trans</span> back reaction occurred upon irradiating in the visible region with a 570 nm laser, indicating that SubPc can act as a light-harvesting unit. In the dark, the isomerization also take place in about two days. The <span class="italic">trans</span>/<span class="italic">cis</span> photoisomerization process could be followed by monitoring the decrease in the intensity of the shoulder band at 357 nm. Additional evidence for the photoisomerization was obtained by NMR spectroscopy since, in addition to the doublets for the azobenzene unit in the <span class="italic">trans</span> isomer at 7.23 and 5.41 ppm, two new doublets are observed at 6.15 and 5.24 ppm, assigned to the corresponding <span class="italic">cis</span> isomer when a CDCl<small><sub>3</sub></small> solution of <strong>116</strong> is irradiated with UV region light (365 nm). As a consequence of a closer proximity of the SubPcs in this <span class="italic">cis</span>-isomer, the signals are considerably upfield shifted. Integration of these groups of signals indicates that 25% of triad <strong>116</strong> is in the <span class="italic">cis</span> form in the PSS. In the case of triad <strong>117</strong> the conversion of the <span class="italic">E</span>,<span class="italic">E</span> conformer to a photostationary state that contains the <span class="italic">E</span>,<span class="italic">Z</span> conformer was accomplished through irradiation at 385 nm.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> As in the previous triad <strong>116</strong>, only the main π–π* bis (azobenzene) band of the <span class="italic">E</span>,<span class="italic">E</span>-isomer loses intensity upon irradiation. Photoisomerization was also inferred from the appearance of a new singlet in the <small><sup>1</sup></small>H-NMR spectrum, assigned to the central benzene ring of the bis(azobenzene) unit. However, no changes were detected in the terminal phenoxy units, probably due to the longer distance of the bis(azobenzene) bridge. Significantly, an obvious decrease in the fluorescence emission intensity is also observed.</p>

            <span>Despite the widespread use of SubPcs in organic electronics as small molecule, and the well-known benefits of polymeric organic materials, only few reports deal with SubPc-containing polymers. In particular, it is noteworthy the work of Bender and Lessard in this field, who described in 2012 the first SubPc incorporated as pendant unit into a random styrene-phenoxy copolymer <strong>135</strong>, using a post-polymerization transformation strategy that consist in the displacement of the axial bromide of SubPc-Br <strong>31</strong> by the phenolic side groups in a preformed polymer (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig35">Fig. 35</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit280"><sup><span class="sup_ref">280</span></sup></a> Later on, they developed a synthetic route involving the reaction with the carboxylic acid groups of a styrene (S)–acrylic acid (AA) copolymer, obtaining the corresponding SubPc-containing polymer <strong>136</strong><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit281"><sup><span class="sup_ref">281</span></sup></a> by TEMPO-mediated polymerization; however, a significant amount of an undesired side product was formed.

            <span>Considering the sensitivity of the SubPc macrocycle towards nucleophiles and the restricted chemistry that this peculiar macrocycle allows in general, palladium-mediated coupling reactions have been the best tool that SubPc chemist handled for the preparation of multicomponent SubPc based systems. Monoiodo-SubPc derivatives are by far the most used starting materials for performing these chemical transformations. In contrast, <span class="italic">ortho</span>-diiodoSubPc has been scarcely employed in the preparation of multicomponent systems.

Compounds <strong>145</strong> were obtained as a mixture of two topoisomers that could not be separated, one with all SubPc units facing the same direction, and another with one of the SubPc moieties facing the opposite direction. In a more recent example, a conjugated SubPc dimer <strong>146</strong> sharing a conjugated cyclic bridge was published by the group of Nielsen (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab6">Table 6</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit53"><sup><span class="sup_ref">53</span></sup></a> The two SubPc units were fused to the radiaannulene core with 10% yield by a four-fold Sonogashira coupling of <span class="italic">ortho</span>-diiodoSubPc and the bis(triisopropylsilyl)-protected tetraethynylethene (TEE) monomer, using AsPh<small><sub>3</sub></small>.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The Q band absorption maximum undergoes a progressive bathochromic shift on going from a single-unit SubPc to the fused dehydro[18]annulene trimer <strong>145</strong> by <span class="italic">ca.</span> 20 nm per SubPc unit up to 623 nm. The extinction coefficients also increased according to the increasing number of SubPc chromophores. In the case of the radialene fused SubPc dimer <strong>146</strong> the red-shift is even stronger (60 nm compared to that of unsubstituted SubPc up to 621 nm), and it shows a small degree of solvatochromism. Its decrease in fluorescence when increasing the solvent polarity in the heptane, CH<small><sub>2</sub></small>Cl<small><sub>2</sub></small>, MeCN progression suggests quenching <span class="italic">via</span> a charge-transfer state. In addition, polyacetylenic scaffolds such as radiaannulenes and dehydroannulenes are molecules with good electron acceptor properties. Indeed, trimer <strong>145</strong> exhibited easier oxidation and reduction processes, by 30 and 50 mV respectively, than the SubPc reference. The radialene <strong>146</strong> is an excellent multi-electron acceptor, exhibiting four closely spaced one-electron reductions at −1.42 V, −1.68 V, −1.92 V and −2.16 V during the negatively going scan, corresponding to the formation of the radical anion, dianion, radical trianion and tetraanion, respectively.</p>

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicated a great thermal stability of the SubPc-containing polymers <strong>149</strong> and <strong>150</strong>, with decomposition temperatures (5% weight loss) of 314 °C and 276 °C, respectively.

To confirm the porosities of SubPc-polymers the nitrogen gas adsorption-desorption isotherms at 77 K were measured, suggesting a limited microporous structure in these polymers.

            <span>The use of C<small><sub>60</sub></small> derivatives as electron acceptors in most organic photovoltaic devices, and the importance of controlling the contact between donors and acceptors to facilitate the electron transfer between them, has pushed forward the search of fullerene receptors during the last years. Among them, π-conjugated curved molecules such as corannulene or SubPcs have been proposed as ideal molecules to bind complementary spherically shaped fullerene guests, as a result of concave–convex intermolecular interactions. Since fullerenes are scarcely polar molecules, the electrostatic interactions with the receptor might be negligible, therefore the contact area between host and guest should be maximized to enhance dispersion forces, in most cases exploiting π–π interactions. In order to obtain efficient OPVs, not only a good complexation has to be ensured, but also some electronic matching is needed to favour the electron transfer process. The bowl-shaped geometry of SubPc provides the best topology for noncovalent π–π complex formation with the curved surfaces of C<small><sub>60</sub></small> and C<small><sub>70</sub></small> fullerenes. Computational studies indicate that the closest contact between C<small><sub>60</sub></small> and SubPc is 3.20 Å with the SubPc five-membered rings. In contrast, C<small><sub>70</sub></small> enables two types of interactions with the SubPc receptor, namely, through its polar region, or by the equatorial region, the latter being more favorable, since C<small><sub>70</sub></small> exposes a larger area maximizing close contacts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit288"><sup><span class="sup_ref">288</span></sup></a> These calculations also predicted the higher stability of the 2<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1 SubPc/C<small><sub>60</sub></small> complexes. Indeed, SubPc and fullerene heterolayers have been successfully incorporated as donor–acceptor components in organic heterojunction photovoltaic devices.

Experimental studies by Torres and co-workers on the complexation of different fullerenes by cone-shaped SubPc molecules bearing different type of peripheral substituents have shown that shape complementarity alone is not enough for the formation of strong complexes between SubPcs and fullerenes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit290"><sup><span class="sup_ref">290</span></sup></a> Additionally, structural factors such as the electronic nature of the SubPc (which is modulated by the peripheral substituents) and the incorporation of peripheral medium-sized alkyl chains seem to play an important role in the binding process, influencing both the stoichiometry and strength of the complexes formed with C<small><sub>60</sub></small> and C<small><sub>70</sub></small> in solution.

The POP-SubPc derivatives <strong>162</strong> and <strong>163</strong> were characterized by different techniques. The FT-IR spectra of SubPc-POPs <strong>162</strong> display the characteristic C<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_e001.gif" alt="[double bond, length as m-dash]"/>N stretching of the SubPc monomer at 1465–1468 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, and the B–O stretching of the axial ligands at 1046–1039 cm<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

Most importantly, the permanent porosities of the SubPc-POPs were evaluated by nitrogen gas adsorption isotherms at 77 K.

However, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis of the SubPc-POPs revealed amorphous materials with no apparent long-range. Authors claim this disorder to be related to the large size of the axial phenoxy substituents, preventing the monomers from forming the desired concave-to-ligand stacking interactions. In contrast to the monomers in solution, fluorescence of SubPc-POPs was fully quenched in the solid-state, most probably due to the formation of disordered J-aggregates.</span>

        <span>Throughout this review, it has been shown how the extraordinary features of SubPcs can be drastically modulated <span class="italic">via</span> either axial or peripheral functionalization. This in-depth understanding of the structure-property relationship of SubPc derivatives, together with the control of their organization at the nanometer scale, have enabled their use in a plethora of state-of-the-art fields that range from electronic devices to biomedicine. Thus, the aim of this section is to show the reader the different applications that SubPcs have found and are currently finding in the context of material science. In particular, this section has been divided in three main parts: (1) applications in photovoltaic devices, (2) applications in biochemistry and biology and (3) additional applications.</span>

In this connection, SubPcs offer many molecular properties that are especially useful in this field and, importantly, can be applied as both donor and acceptor materials since they present substituent-dependent redox profiles. As a result, SubPcs have been extensively studied in organic photovoltaics (OPV) and currently hold a privileged position among the most employed organic semiconductors.</span>

After these two subsections, which cover the most explored configurations, we will overview their incorporation in tandem architectures (TSCs). Then, some examples of SubPcs as sensitizers in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) and their employment as hole- or electron-transport material (HTM and ETM) in perovskites solar cells (PerSCs) will be commented.</p>

This, together with the strong absorption of PDI moieties from 370–520 nm, result in a significant photocurrent contribution of the acceptor showing a broad EQE from 300 nm to 800 nm. Moreover, as inferred from electrochemical measurement, the acceptor properties of SubPc were also found to improve (LUMO energy of −3.78 eV).

The resulting device showed an excellent PCE of 6.1%.

            <span>Since the seminal work published by O’Regan and Gräztel in 1991,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit462"><sup><span class="sup_ref">462</span></sup></a> DSSCs have been extensively investigated as a promising cost-effective alternative to the common p–n junction devices. In this configuration, particular attention has been paid to the optimization of the sensitizer. In this sense, although most efforts have been directed to the use planar porphyrinoids sensitizers (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Pors or Pcs), SubPcs have also shown promising results. In 2014, the groups of Torres and Nazeeruddin synthetized five SubPcs bearing different carboxylic acids both at the axial and the peripheral positions, and tested for the first time their performances in DSSCs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit47"><sup><span class="sup_ref">47</span></sup></a> The authors screened several electrolytes and found that those containing Li+ significantly improved the <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small>. Thus, with the optimized electrolyte in hand (mixture of 0.5 M NaI and 0.5 M LiI), a maximum PCE of 1.32% was obtained using the peripherally functionalized SubPc. In contrast, when the axially substituted SubPcs were tested, PCEs drastically decreased as a result of the poor electronic communication between SubPc orbitals and TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (PCEs of 0.05–0.38%). Importantly, the addition of coadsorbant did not improve the performance owing to the low aggregation tendency of SubPcs. In spite of the low PCEs obtained and the low <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small> values, this work paved the way for further research on SubPc-based.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">In an attempt to improve <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small>, the same authors described two years later another set of asymmetric SubPcs holding a carboxylic acid at the periphery.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a> Such compounds were tested in DSSCs on [9+4] mm thick TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> film (9 mm thick active layer and an additional 4 mm thick scattering layer) and also afforded low PCEs ranging from 0.23% to 0.91%. Supported by electrochemical measurements, the authors concluded that the poor efficiencies of SubPc-based DSSCs mainly arise from the small driving forces for electron injection as a consequence the low-lying LUMO levels of these sensitizers, which significantly limits the <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small>.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Later, Gotfredsen <span class="italic">et al.</span> similarly evaluated the efficiency of both liquid- and solid-state DSSCs using a new push–pull SubPc sensitizer consisting of two aniline donor moieties and a benzothiadiazole acceptor moiety.

            <span>Solar cells based on organo-metal halide perovskites (PerSCs) have gained an unprecedented research interest reaching impressive PCEs above 25% in a few years. In view of the potential that SubPcs have demonstrated in the other configurations, some authors have started to explore their potential also in this type of solar cells. However, it should be noted that, since in this case the perovskite layer is the light absorber, the role of SubPc is just extracting the holes or electrons (HTM or ETM) from such layer. Accordingly, this section is divided in (1) SubPcs as HTM and (2) SubPcs as ETM.</span>
            
              
              <span id="sect6230"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">2.7.1.5.1 Subphthalocyanines as HTM. </span>
              <span>In an attempt to substitute the well-known spiro-OMeTAD, the groups of Lianos and Kumar explored the use of <strong>20</strong> as HTM.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit463"><sup><span class="sup_ref">463</span></sup></a> In this study, the authors prepared a PerSC consisting of a CH<small><sub>3</sub></small>NH<small><sub>3</sub></small>PbClxI<small><sub>3−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small> perovskite deposited onto a mesoporous TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> surface by spin coating, where the SubPc layer was subsequently introduced by vacuum deposition. SEM studies revealed well-defined layer structure evidencing that this fabrication method is effective. Interestingly, when this device was stored under ambient conditions in dark, it underwent an incubation period of 9 days during which the efficiency increased, affording a maximum PCE of 6.6%. The cell stability with and without SubPc was studied by Micro-Raman techniques. With SubPc, the device started to degrade after the 9th day. In contrast, the device without SubPc rapidly degraded in a period of two days. Therefore, it was concluded that the placement of SubPc on the top slowed down the degradation process.</span>
              <p class="otherpara">Further research on this SubPc-based HTMs was reported by Wan <span class="italic">et al.</span> describing the use of a new Me<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc-Cl.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> In this case the SubPc was deposited by spin coating and integrated in the following solar cell configuration: FTO/SnO<small><sub>2</sub></small>/PCBM/perovskite/Me<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc-Cl/Au. The layer morphology was again evaluated by SEM measurements and revealed that the SubPc formed a smooth and flat surface in contact with perovskite and Au layers. After that, the solar cell performance of this novel derivative was measured under AM 1.5G illumination and compared with that of <strong>20</strong> and spiro-OMeTAD. Remarkably, the Me<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc-Cl device outperformed that of spiro-OMeTAD and <strong>20</strong>, displaying a high <span class="italic">V</span><small><sub>oc</sub></small> of 0.986 V and a PCE of 6.96%. The authors attributed these results to the fact that the HOMO–LUMO levels of Me<small><sub>6</sub></small>SubPc-Cl are better aligned with the valence band of the perovskite material.</p>
              <p class="otherpara">Xu and co-workers proceeded in a different way by incorporating <strong>20</strong> as a passivating agent with the aim of filling the voids and defects in the perovskite surface.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit464"><sup><span class="sup_ref">464</span></sup></a> They found that, upon addition of small SubPc concentrations (0.5–1 mg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), the free charge carrier lifetime increased because of the efficient passivation of the surface defect trap-states. Thus, the <span class="italic">J</span><small><sub>sc</sub></small> and FF values dramatically raised boosting the PCE up to 13.6%. The addition of higher concentrations of SubPc led to the formation of clusters that hinder the charge transfer from perovskite to PC<small><sub>61</sub></small>BM and therefore lower device performances. Another noteworthy aspect is the mildness of the device fabrication method. The SubPc was deposited by spin-coating thus avoiding the damage of the perovskite by thermal annealing, as for example may happen with other common strategies, such as the thermal deposition of polymers.</p>

Accordingly, for the same shortcomings commented in Sections 2.7.1.1.2 and 2.7.1.2.2, there is an urgent need to develop non-fullerene organic ETMs. Inspired by their success in the conventional p–n devices, several authors have just recently explored the use of SubPcs as ETM in PerSCs.

More importantly, the authors demonstrated that the implementation of a SubPc in the ETM significantly increased the device stability. Based on a comprehensive device characterization, the authors explained that the SubPc chemically interacts with the perovskite halide ions in a such a way that avoid their migration toward the electrode. As a result, these devices exhibited an unprecedent long-term stability (95% of PCE retained over 1200 hour of outdoor testing and 90% of PCE retained under illumination and MPPT for over 2000 h).</span>

On the other hand, with regard to the therapeutic activity, they have a longer triplet lifetime compared to other widely used porphyrinoids, such as porphyrins or Pcs, and therefore usually provide excellent quantum yields for the generation of singlet oxygen (Section 2.3.7). In addition, SubPcs can exhibit excellent water solubility due to their low tendency towards aggregation and their versatility in terms of functionalization, which is of paramount importance for their study in the living world.</span>

In addition to diagnosing, the <span class="italic">in vitro</span> visualization by microscopy is a powerful tool to assess what method is the most suitable. A priori, the synthesis of water-soluble derivatives seems to be the most efficient approach. To this end, the SubPc can be functionalized with polar groups at either the axial or the peripheral positions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> However, several authors have also obtained encouraging results by means other strategies.

The second strategy consisted of the synthesis of water-soluble SubPcs which are axially functionalized with an alkylsulfonate derivative (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig68">Fig. 68</a>). Remarkably, both strategies turned out to be equally efficient and did not showed cytotoxicity. Another noteworthy finding in this work was that, depending on the pH, SubPcs bearing amine-containing axial substituents can show a pH activatable fluorescence. In a subsequent work, the same group developed a new strategy to achieve water solubility consisting in the axial functionalization of SubPcs with a chelator moiety (tetraxetan; DOTA, or Pentetic acid; DPTA) complexed with medically relevant metals, such as Gd, Y or In (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig69">Fig. 69</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> These derivatives, which are bimodal contrast agents, showed sharp Q-bands in water, thus evidencing high solubility, and also provided good fluorescence images of B16 cells by means confocal/biphoton microscopy.</span>

            <p class="otherpara">Further research in the application of SubPcs as probes have involved their conjugation with biomolecules to achieve site-selective bioimages. For instance, the axial position of SubPc or SubPc-containing liposomes has been functionalized with bombesin, a well-known peptide which is an over-expressed receptor at the surface of tumour cells.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit108"><sup><span class="sup_ref">108</span></sup></a> In this case, the use of liposome was found to be the most suitable approach since the direct functionalization of SubPcs led to modest water solubility and low stability, presumably due to the intrinsic sensibility of SubPc against certain nucleophiles. Unfortunately, such liposomes lost inhibitory activity with respect to the reference compound (Bombesin [<strong>1–14</strong>]), which exhibited 66-fold affinity for BBN receptors. Importantly, this work claims again the use of liposomes as promising alternative to employ non-water-soluble or unstable SubPcs. In 2020, Voskuhl and co-workers described the synthesis of axially substituted SubPcs that are able to form host-guest complexes with cyclodextrins.

When this polymer was subjected to positive potential (from 0 to 1.6 V), excellent blue-to-transmissive transitions were observed. This discoloration is due to the oxidation of Fe(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) to (<span class="small_caps">III</span>), which avoids the MLCT from Fe to SubPc ligand.

            <span>Given the strong and red-shifted absorption of SubPcs, some authors have envisaged their use in the rapidly growing field of photoredox catalysis. In this case, the role of SubPc is (1) capturing the light to reach the excited state, (2) generating high-energy, SubPc-based radical ions and (3) triggering an electron transfer process while returning to the ground state (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig74">Fig. 74</a>). On this basis, Shibata and co-workers found that trifluoroethoxylated SubPcs is very effective to catalyse the iodo-trifluoromethylation of alkenes under red LED irradiation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit496"><sup><span class="sup_ref">496</span></sup></a> Indeed, after optimizing several parameters, this SubPc outperformed other commonly used photocatalysts by furnishing the model product in a 96% yield after 1 hour. Importantly, it was found that the reaction does not work when using <strong>20</strong> as catalyst, thus suggesting that the peripheral substitution of SubPc with trifluoroethoxy groups is crucial for its catalytic activity. Another example in this field includes that of García and co-workers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a> This group demonstrated that a SubPc encapsulated within a metal–organic framework can generate α-ketyl radicals from α-haloacetophenones under sunlight irradiation.

Peripheral functionalization with aryl and vinylene moieties has been achieved by modification of preformed SubPzs through Pd catalyzed, CuTC mediated cross-coupling reactions of hexasulfanylated SubPzs with a variety of arylboronic<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512,518</span></sup></a> or vinylboronic<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512</span></sup></a> acids, respectively (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch20">Scheme 20</a>).

The angles between two consecutive benzene rings are also much smaller than those observed for the corresponding octaarylated porphyrazines. As a result of all these smaller dihedral angles between the substituents and macrocycle, peripheral aryl substituents produce stronger influences on the electronic properties of SubPzs related to those of porphyrazines.</p>

Thus, electron donor <span class="italic">para</span>-substituents produce stronger effects (36–202 nm in <strong>256–258</strong>, <strong>264</strong> and <strong>266</strong>) than <span class="italic">meta</span>-substituents (8–12 nm in <strong>262</strong>, <strong>265</strong> and <strong>267</strong>) and electron acceptor <span class="italic">para</span>-substituents (1–18 nm in <strong>259–261</strong>).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512,518</span></sup></a> Besides, the same aryl substituents produce a higher impact when they are a part of a push–pull SubPz (for example, <span class="italic">λ</span><small><sub>em</sub></small> = 612 nm in <strong>256</strong> and <span class="italic">λ</span><small><sub>em</sub></small> = 662 nm in <strong>250</strong>).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512,517</span></sup></a></p>

          <span>SubPz <strong>276</strong> exhibits in CV two reversible redox processes, namely an oxidation at +0.83 V and a reduction at −1.72 V (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab11">Table 11</a>). SubPzs are, therefore, more difficult to reduce and oxidize electrochemically than SubPcs. The effect of axial ligation has only a small impact on the redox properties of SubPzs. For instance, replacing the phenoxy group in <strong>276</strong> by a fluoride anion in <strong>277</strong> shifts the oxidation potential anodically by only 10 mV. As an exception, π-coordination of <strong>276</strong> to RuCp* to give <strong>286</strong> shifts the first reduction and oxidation peaks anodically by 200 mV and 140 mV, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a></span>

          <p class="otherpara">Peripheral functionalization produces important changes in the electrochemistry of SubPzs. Firstly, all the hexasulfanylated, hexaarylated and hexavinylated SubPzs exhibit three or four reversible reduction peaks in addition to one or two oxidation processes that are irreversible in most of the cases. Moreover, all the hexasulfanylated, hexaarylated and hexavinylated SubPzs are by 160–870 mV easier to reduce, even when functionalized with electron donor functions, such as <strong>258</strong> (<span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>1/2</sub></small> = −1.56 V).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512,518</span></sup></a> Significantly, the latter potential value is very close to that exhibited by the RuCp* π-complex <strong>286</strong>. As a general trend, the effect of <span class="italic">para</span>-substitution in the first reduction potentials of hexaaryl-SubPzs correlates with the Hammett constants (<span class="italic">σ</span><small><sub>p</sub></small>) corresponding to the substituents, so that the potentials are shifted cathodically in the order: NO<small><sub>2</sub></small> &lt; CF<small><sub>3</sub></small> &lt; CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>Me &lt; H ≈ MeS &lt; MeO &lt; NMe<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The most positive reduction potential corresponds to the nitro-substituted SubPz <strong>259</strong>, with <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>1/2</sub></small> = −0.85 V for the first reduction potential.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit518"><sup><span class="sup_ref">518</span></sup></a> In addition, the effect of the substituents can be different depending on the position to which they are attached. Thus, methoxy substituents in SubPzs <strong>256</strong> and <strong>262</strong> produce opposite effects, with <span class="italic">E</span><small><sub>1/2</sub></small> being by 90 mV cathodically shifted in <strong>256</strong><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit518"><sup><span class="sup_ref">518</span></sup></a> with respect to <strong>255</strong> and by 50 mV anodically shifted in <strong>262</strong>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">Likewise, the oxidation trend correlates quite well with the corresponding Hammett constants for each substituent at the <span class="italic">para</span>-position. Again, the position of the substituents determines opposite effects. For example, <strong>256</strong> is 170 mV easier to oxidize than <strong>255</strong>, while <strong>262</strong> is 50 mV more difficult.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512</span></sup></a></p>

The formal addition of three fused benzene rings to a SubPc structure can result in two types of SubNcs, namely, 2,3-SubNcs and 1,2-SubNcs (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig93">Fig. 93</a>). The latter exists as two <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>3</sub></small> and <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>1</sub></small> regioisomers, each one consisting in a pair of enantiomers.</span>

        <p class="otherpara">The first example of subnaphthalocyanine is a 2,3-isomer and dates back to 1995.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit556"><sup><span class="sup_ref">556</span></sup></a> Hanack described the cyclotrimerization reaction of naphthalene-2,3-dicarbonitrile, as well as that of its <span class="italic">tert</span>-substituted derivative, in the presence of dichloro(phenyl)borane in boiling naphthalene, affording analytical amounts of SubNcs <strong>328</strong> and <strong>330</strong> (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>). Both compounds were reported to show absorption bands at 650 and 654 nm, respectively, matching the absorption profile that is currently well-known for these derivatives. The number of publications on SubNcs is roughly one-tenth of that of SubPcs. Therefore, compared to the list of available SubPcs, the number of SubNcs that has been reported is quite limited, although in the last ten years there is an increasing interest in the study of these extended-conjugated analogues for their application in photovoltaics.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">The most usual method to prepare 2,3-SubNcs consists in the cyclotrimerization reaction of the corresponding naphthalene-dicarbonitrile derivative in different aromatic solvents (<a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch30">Scheme 30</a> and <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab12">Table 12</a>), in the presence of a boron template, which is usually BCl<small><sub>3</sub></small>. The reported yields range from <span class="italic">ca.</span> 1% to 80%, depending on the substitution pattern and the reaction conditions. For unsubstituted SubNc <strong>224</strong>, multichlorination processes of the aromatic rings occur, usually at the naphthalene bay positions (C4, C9, C16 and their symmetric sites), giving rise to a mixed alloy mixture of SubNc derivatives with different degrees of chlorination (Cl–Cl<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small>SubNc), which complete separation is not feasible. Bender has dedicated much work to search for reaction conditions that could inhibit the chlorination processes, without much success.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit418"><sup><span class="sup_ref">418</span></sup></a> In fact, a total occupancy of 0.99–1.13 peripheral chlorines per SubNc molecule,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit418"><sup><span class="sup_ref">418,444</span></sup></a> with an average molecular formula of C<small><sub>36</sub></small>H<small><sub>16.87</sub></small>BCl<small><sub>2.13</sub></small>N<small><sub>6</sub></small>, was determined for <strong>224</strong>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit418"><sup><span class="sup_ref">418</span></sup></a> In general, the use of an electron-poor solvent (nitrobenzene) for the synthesis of Cl–Cl<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small>SubNc resulted in the highest degree of bay position chlorination. More recently, bay position bromination has also been detected when attempting to increase the yield of <strong>329</strong> by using a modified version of the Kennedy method, namely, <span class="italic">o</span>-dichlorobenzene as reaction solvent.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit557"><sup><span class="sup_ref">557</span></sup></a> Under optimized conditions, <strong>329</strong> was obtained in 32% yield as a Br–Br<small><sub><span class="italic">n</span></sub></small>SubNc alloy. It is worth noting that it is possible to avoid bay position bromination by employing low temperature synthetic methods, although only analytical amounts of the macrocycle are produced.</p>

          <span>The crystal structure of 2,3-SubNcs exhibit the typical cone shape of the SubPc analogues. The depth of the cavity can be characterized by the SubNc bowl-depth, defined by the distance from the mean plane of peripheral six <span class="italic">C</span><small><sub>f</sub></small> carbons (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig94">Fig. 94</a>) to the center boron atom. The bowl-depth of <strong>224</strong> is of 3.250 Å, deeper than that of SubPcs, owing to the three additional benzene rings that enlarge the π-surface (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab13">Table 13</a>). However, the curvature is slightly less pronounced than that of SubPcs, and even less pronounced than that of SubPzs. This is in line with that observed upon annulating peripheral rings to the SubPz structure. Specifically, the average distance between the boron atom and the plane defined by the 3 N<small><sub>p</sub></small> atoms (<span class="italic">P</span>1) decreases in the order SubPz (0.62 Å) &gt; SubPc (0.61 Å) &gt; SubNc (0.60 Å).

A similar effect is observed for SubPc bowl-depth (<span class="italic">P</span>3): SubPc (2.55 Å) &gt; SubNc (2.40 Å).</span>

          <span>When benzene rings are fused to the SubPc structure, there is a narrowing of the HOMO–LUMO gap due to destabilization of the 1a<small><sub>2</sub></small> HOMO of SubNc, relative to the 1e LUMO and 1a<small><sub>1</sub></small> MO.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit566"><sup><span class="sup_ref">566</span></sup></a> The effect is smaller in magnitude than that observed on going from SubPz to SubPc, since in SubNc the additional benzene rings lie further from the inner perimeter where the largest MO coefficients are anticipated for the HOMO and LUMO orbitals.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit566"><sup><span class="sup_ref">566</span></sup></a> The effect on the 1a<small><sub>2</sub></small> MO is originated from an antibonding interaction at the point of attachment of the C<small><sub>4</sub></small>H<small><sub>4</sub></small> bridges that are added upon annulation of benzene rings.

          <p class="otherpara">Unlike SubPcs, for which the introduction of electron donating or withdrawing groups always produce bathochromic shifts of the Q-bands, the effect of peripheral substitution in SubNcs can produce either red or blue shifts, depending on the nature of the substituent (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab14">Table 14</a>). Given the limited catalogue of peripherally substituted SubNcs, building a general trend is not easy, but the available data seem to indicate that substituents functioning essentially as electron acceptors, such as halogens (except fluorine), imides, sulfones, or triple bonds, produce small bathochromic shifts of the SubNc Q-bands. Fluorine, with strong π-donor ability, produce small hypsochromic shifts. Thus, for example, dodecafluorination (SubNcs <strong>333</strong> and <strong>363</strong>) produces a 10 nm hypsochromic shift of the SubNc Q-band (contrasting with the 10 nm bathochromic shift produced in SubPcs) and 0–5 nm hypsochromic shift of the SubNc <span class="italic">λ</span><small><sub>em</sub></small>. However, dodecachlorination (SubNcs <strong>334</strong> and <strong>362</strong>) does not have any noticeable effect on the Q band of SubNc, while it shifts <span class="italic">λ</span><small><sub>em</sub></small> 8 nm bathochromically.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit562"><sup><span class="sup_ref">562</span></sup></a> Hexafluorination (SubNc <strong>332</strong>) shifts 11 nm both Q and emission bands to higher energies, while the other halogens (SubNcs <strong>336</strong>, <strong>338</strong> and <strong>339</strong>) do it to lower energies, this effect increasing in the order Cl &lt; Br &lt; I (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig97">Fig. 97</a>). Substitution with twelve sulfones produces 21 nm and 36 nm red shift of Q and emission bands, respectively, in SubNc <strong>335</strong>, while the effect upon imidation is of 6 and 1 nm, respectively, and 19 nm upon ethynylation (SubNc <strong>353</strong>).</p>

          <span>SubNc <strong>224</strong> exhibits in DPV three main redox processes, namely two oxidations at +0.26 V and +0.73 V and a reduction at −1.35 V (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab15">Table 15</a>). They are, therefore, easier to oxidize and more difficult to reduce electrochemically than the corresponding SubPc. Compared to peripheral substitution, axial ligation has a small effect on the redox properties of SubNcs. For instance, replacing the chloride group in <strong>224</strong> by phenoxy in <strong>359</strong>, shifts exclusively the reduction potential cathodic by 180 mV, while substitution with the electron-deficient pentafluorophenoxy moiety makes the reduction of <strong>360</strong> slightly easier than in <strong>359</strong> (50 mV) and the oxidation somewhat more difficult (40 mV). A similar trend is observed upon axial substitution of dodecahalogenated SubNcs with a <span class="italic">tert</span>-butylphenoxy group, resulting in moderate cathodic shifts of 110 and 130 mV for the first reduction potential of <strong>362</strong> and <strong>363</strong>, related to the corresponding chloro-substituted SubNcs <strong>334</strong> and <strong>333</strong>, respectively.</span>

Dodecachlorination and dodecafluorination makes the oxidation of <strong>334</strong> and <strong>333</strong> by 380 and 360 mV more difficult, respectively, while the reduction is facilitated by 200 and 140 mV, respectively. The highest effect is observed upon dodeca-substitution with sulfones in <strong>335</strong>, with the first reduction process 240 mV anodically shifted and no oxidation process detected.

        <h3 id="sect9988"><span class="b_heading">6.1 Synthesis of subporphyrins</span></h3>
        <span>Discovered in 2007 by Osuka<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> and Kobayashi in two independent reports,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3,571</span></sup></a> Subporphyrins (SubPs) constitute the youngest members of the Subporphyrinoid family. SubPs have shown extraordinary structural versatility, which is clearly indicated by the prolific number of reports on SubPs in a relatively short period of time, much higher than those on SubPzs and SubNcs, reported one, two and twelve years before, respectively. A large part of their structural versatility arises from the presence of <span class="italic">meso</span> bridges that are an additional functionalization site. Smaller C<small><sub>pyrr</sub></small>–C<small><sub>meso</sub></small>–C<small><sub>pyrr</sub></small> angles of the trimeric SubPs (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 117°) with respect to porphyrins (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 127°) provides larger explementary angles and consequently, larger distance between the <span class="italic">meso</span> substituents and the adjacent pyrrole rings. As a result, sterically non-congested <span class="italic">meso</span>-aryl SubP substituents can rotate freely, allowing their strong electronic coupling to the SubP core and causing large substituent effect.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a> The synthesis and properties of SubPs published during the first six years after their discovery have been reviewed by some of us and others in previous works.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,4,5,572</span></sup></a> Here, a strong focus is given on the synthesis of SubP. Besides, the present review intends to offer a general picture of the chemistry and properties of SubPs, in particular, the effects of substitution in the structure and properties of these macrocycles. Therefore, we will emphasize new results that have appeared in the last eight years, but will also include some relevant aspects already discussed in the previous reviews.</span>

This method has been demonstrated to be very effective for the synthesis of versatile symmetric and unsymmetric SubPs, since the access to various <strong>f</strong>-type intermediates is relatively simple and SubPs can be constructed in a controlled manner. However, the Adler reaction from tri(1<span class="italic">H</span>-pyrrol-1-yl)borane precursors still constitutes the most usual access to symmetric SubPs. <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab18">Table 18</a> compiles A<small><sub>3</sub></small>, A<small><sub>2</sub></small>B and ABC SubPs that have been directly prepared by following the reactions shown in <a title="Select to navigate to scheme" href="#imgsch41">Scheme 41</a>.

          <span>Most of SubPs are reported as methoxo-compounds that are obtained by treatment with MeOH, as one of the last steps in the synthesis of SubPs. This contrasts with axial ligand exchange reactions of SubPcs, which typically require more forcing conditions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit68"><sup><span class="sup_ref">68</span></sup></a> The axial hydroxo- or methoxo-groups can easily be replaced by any other alkoxy or carbonyloxy groups, for different purposes, for example, to obtain single crystals that can be studied by XR diffraction,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit586"><sup><span class="sup_ref">586</span></sup></a> or to endow the molecule with additional functionalities, such as a thiol group.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit636"><sup><span class="sup_ref">636</span></sup></a> This process can be reverted to the axial hydroxy SubP by simply washing the B-alkoxy and B-carbonyloxy subporphyrin with aqueous HCl. Interestingly, bowl-inversion has been observed in some SubPs containing a chiral sulfinyl substituent at one of the β-positions, upon treatment with alcohols at different temperatures.

          <span>Almost all the structures of key SubPs have been revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.

          <p class="otherpara">As a general trend, the curvatures for substituted SubPs are slightly smaller than that of unsubstituted SubP <strong>415</strong>, and depend on the axial, <span class="italic">meso</span>- and β-substituents, as well as crystal packing manners. Thus, for example, introducing one (SubP <strong>606</strong>), or two (SubP <strong>430</strong>) phenyl substituents at one or two of the <span class="italic">meso</span>-positions slightly flattens the molecule to bowl depth values of 1.42 and 1.46 Å, respectively, while the curvature of the corresponding triphenyl-substituted SubP <strong>390</strong> is of 1.29 Å (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab24">Table 24</a> and <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig105">Fig. 105</a>). Comparable effects are observed upon trialkyl (SubP <strong>491</strong>)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit586"><sup><span class="sup_ref">586</span></sup></a> or bis ethoxycarbonyl (SubP <strong>437</strong>) <span class="italic">meso</span>-substitution.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit603"><sup><span class="sup_ref">603</span></sup></a> Functionalizing at the six β-pyrrole positions with ethyl groups (SubP <strong>412</strong>) or fusing benzene rings at the same positions (BzSubP <strong>387</strong>) also reduces the SubP bowl depths (1.43 Å and 1.32 Å, respectively). The corresponding <span class="italic">meso</span>-triphenyl-substituted SubPs <strong>411</strong> and <strong>388</strong> are still shallower (1.16 and 1.18 Å, respectively), reflecting the smaller curvatures of SubPs fully substituted at both <span class="italic">meso</span>- and β-positions (see <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab24">Table 24</a> SubPs <strong>411</strong>, <strong>h</strong>, <strong>457</strong>, <strong>459</strong>, <strong>455</strong>, <strong>460</strong>, <strong>461</strong>, <strong>462</strong>, <strong>463</strong> and <strong>388</strong>). In this respect, compound <strong>461</strong>, containing three <span class="italic">meso</span>-phenyl substituents and six <span class="italic">tert</span>-butylsulfanyl groups at the β-positions, shows a curvature of 1.04 Å,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit611"><sup><span class="sup_ref">611</span></sup></a> which represents the smallest bowl-depth among all the reported neutral SubPs.</p>

          <span>SubP <strong>415</strong> displays a Soret band at 341 nm arising from a transition that is analogous to the B transition of porphyrins within Gouterman's four-orbital model. In addition, a vibronic structure appears as two absorption bands at 432 and 455 nm with an order of magnitude less intense than the B band (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig106">Fig. 106</a>), which correspond to Q-like transitions within Gouterman's four-orbital model.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit644"><sup><span class="sup_ref">644</span></sup></a> The Soret-like band of SubPs is progressively red shifted upon substitution at the <span class="italic">meso</span>-positions with phenyl rings, and the same occurs for the Q-absorptions. Thus, SubPs <strong>606</strong>, <strong>430</strong> and <strong>390</strong> (<a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab25">Table 25</a>) exhibit their corresponding B-bands at 352, 362 and 373 nm, respectively, while the Q-bands appear at, 440 and 461, 450 and 461, and 484 nm, respectively, indicating electronic interaction of the <span class="italic">meso</span>-phenyl groups with the SubP core. The latter has been attributed to smaller steric hindrance around the <span class="italic">meso</span>-phenyl groups in SubPs related to the corresponding tetraphenylporphyrins,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit595"><sup><span class="sup_ref">595</span></sup></a> which leads to a substantial electronic conjugation of the aromatic <span class="italic">meso</span>-rings to the SubP core in <span class="italic">meso</span>-phenyl and thienyl-SubPs <strong>390</strong> and <strong>421</strong>, contrasting with porphyrins, for which this conjugation is only marginal.</span>

In contrast, the TA of the nitro-SubP <strong>515</strong> in acetonitrile showed that the CS took place with a time constant of 2.8 ps, while CR occurred with a time constant of 20 ps.

Thus, photoexcitation of <strong>523</strong> leads to the population of the locally excited state (LE) that has a slow transient absorption decay and high fluorescence quantum yield. In contrast, photoexcitation of <strong>524</strong> produces rise and decay profiles with time constants of 3.5 and 44 ps, respectively. The time constant of 3.5 ps indicates that the formation time of the CS state involves the structural twisting motion at the C<small><sub><span class="italic">meso</span></sub></small>–N bond, to trigger the intramolecular charge transfer, giving subporphyrin anion radical and 1,4-diaminobenzene cation radical.</p>

The triply fused dimer <strong>630</strong> takes a domed structure with a positive Gaussian curvature. The calculated bowl-depth of the SubP halves is of 1.65 Å, much larger than that of SubP monomers, and indicating that the triple linkage forces additional structural strain. <strong>630</strong> displays absorption bands at 315, 403, 500, 810, and 942 nm (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig119">Fig. 119</a>). A narrow optical HOMO–LUMO gap clearly suggests the effective conjugation extending over the whole molecule. The absorption bands at 315, 403, and 500 nm have been assigned as split Soret-like bands. The absorption spectrum of <strong>629</strong> is clearly different from that of <strong>627</strong>, but similar to that of <strong>630</strong>, suggesting substantial interaction through the Pt-linkage.</p>

The electronic interaction between the SubP and the TCBD–aniline unit is also influenced by the position to which the acceptor unit is attached. In particular, the attachment at the axial position in <strong>633</strong> produces less perturbation, since a large HOMO–LUMO gap of 2.12 eV disables any emissive CT state, and enforces an emissive exciplex deactivation in apolar environments next to the SubP-centered fluorescence; in polar environments, a CS state is generated.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Contrasting, the <span class="italic">meso</span>-substituted SubP <strong>632</strong> showed strong electronic coupling between the donor and acceptor units, owing to the very reduced HOMO–LUMO gap of 1.77 eV, enabling an emissive CT state in virtually all environments, although it is only in polar environments, where it links a local excitation with an indirect CS.</p>

Measurements on the fluorescence decays for the five dyads show that there is a systematic variation of the singlet excited state lifetime with the substitution pattern ranging from 5–15 ps, which corresponds to near quantitative CS. TA measurements revealed that both CS and CR times vary systematically with steric bulk, reflecting that the electronic coupling between the SubP and the NDI becomes smaller as the dihedral angles between the two subunits are increased.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">As SubPs, Subchlorins and Subbacteriochlorins exhibit a 14π-electron aromatic circuit and conical geometry, with bowl-depths of 1.26 Å, although the degree of aromaticity of the three compounds is different, as inferred from their NMR data. Accordingly, the nuclear independent chemical shift (NICS) values calculated at B3LYP/6-311G(d) level are of −10.9 ppm for <strong>649</strong> &lt; −14.9 ppm for <strong>642</strong> &lt; −18.9 ppm for <strong>390</strong>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit659"><sup><span class="sup_ref">659</span></sup></a> The different aromatic characters of the three compounds are also reflected by their optical properties, with decrease and blue shift of the Soret bands in <strong>642</strong> and <strong>649</strong>, related to that of <strong>390</strong>, while the fluorescence quantum yields follow the order <strong>642</strong> &lt; <strong>390</strong> &lt; <strong>649</strong> (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig123">Fig. 123</a>). Comparatively, the oxidation potentials of Subbacteriochlorins are lower than those of the corresponding Subchlorins, and these are in turn lower than those of the parallel SubP. For example, the potential values for the first oxidation peaks are of 0.00 V for <strong>649</strong>, 0.42 V for <strong>642</strong> and 0.78 V for <strong>390</strong>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit587"><sup><span class="sup_ref">587,660</span></sup></a></p>

As a consequence, the triphyrin core shows an almost planar arrangement, except for the 2<span class="italic">H</span>-pyrrole ring opposite to the ethene bridge, which is slightly tilted (16.6°) from the mean plane defined by the four <span class="italic">meso</span>-carbons.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit677"><sup><span class="sup_ref">677</span></sup></a> Two of the <span class="italic">meso</span>-phenyl substituents display a dihedral angle of ∼77° each, with respect to the plane of the triphyrin, whereas the corresponding dihedral angles of the other two are of 46.7° and 36.9°, respectively. The strong triple hydrogen bonding presumably compensates the macrocycle's diamagnetic ring current effect, therefore, the resonances of the [14]triphyrin(2.1.1) inner NH protons lie at remarkably low field despite their calculated NICS(0) values ranging from −9.15 to −15.6 ppm.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit668"><sup><span class="sup_ref">668,672,677</span></sup></a> Similar structures have been reported for triphyrins <strong>692</strong> and <strong>693</strong>.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit675"><sup><span class="sup_ref">675,676</span></sup></a> The crystal structure of the benzo-fused triphyrin <strong>685</strong> also shows 16.3° tilting for the corresponding isoindole ring situated opposite to the ethene bridge.

      <span>Since the serendipitous synthesis of the first subporphyrinoid in 1972, the chemistry of tripyrrole and triisoindole porphyrin analogues has expanded considerably. This review, which comprehensively covers the last decade of discoveries, documents the exponential growth in the number of publications related to subporphyrinoids and highlights the scientific interest in this class of compounds for many application areas ranging from optoelectronics to biomedicine.</span>
      <p class="otherpara">On one hand, big steps forward have been made during the last years in the fundamentals of subporphyrinoids chemistry. The development and optimization of novel methodologies for the synthesis and post-functionalization of these contracted macrocycles keep drawing attention, leading to the possibility of finely tuning the optoelectronic properties of these derivatives. Importantly, tremendous progress has been made in understanding the supramolecular organization of these cone-shaped cores. On the other hand, the application of subporphyrinoids is gaining more and more attention from the scientific community due to the outstanding physicochemical characteristics that these macrocycles offer. The field of subporphyrinoid-base systems for solar energy conversion has blossomed during the last decade, paving the way for the effective implementation of these derivatives in photovoltaics. Moreover, significant advances have been made in the exploitation of this contracted porphyrinoids for therapy and imaging in bio-focused application.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Nevertheless, this upward trend is still at an early stage, and many challenging issues at both the fundamental and application levels remain unexplored. The preparation and exploitation of chiral subporphyrinoids constitutes one of the hottest topics in the frame of the optoelectronic applications of these derivatives. Although initial studies on the application of SubPcs in solar energy conversion schemes have shown the great potential of this class of compound, future efforts are needed to optimize the architecture and the performances of SubPc-containing photovoltaic devices. On the other hand, more comprehensive studies are needed in the frame of the biological applications of SubPcs. Certainly, the development of subporphyrinoid-based applications requires further efforts and fundamental progresses in the chemistry of these macrocycles.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">We hope that this review, in which the most recent advances in subporphyrinoids are presented and discussed, will inspire and boost further research in this area, contributing to unveil the fundamentals of this fascinating class of compounds, and leading to innovative developments in their known implementations in optoelectronics and biomedicine as well as in yet unexplored applications.</p>
