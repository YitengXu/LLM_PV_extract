          <span>Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is recognised as being vital to least cost pathways for climate change mitigation, and in particular the negative emissions technologies (NETs) that are key to limiting warming to “well below” 2C. However, it has not yet been deployed on the scale understood to be required, owing to a variety of technical, economic and commercial challenges. This paper provides a state-of-the-art update of each of these areas, and provides a perspective on how to the discipline forward, highlighting key research challenges that should be addressed over the course of the next decade. Importantly, this perspective balances scientific, policy and commercial priorities.</span>

      <h2 id="sect1027"><span class="a_heading">1 Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>This paper is the third installment in a series of publications over several years in Energy &amp; Environmental Science.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1,2</span></sup></a> The first (published in 2010) provided an introduction to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture technologies, with an overview of solvent-based chemisorption (amines and ionic liquids), carbonate looping, oxy-fuel combustion technologies, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and utilisation (CCU) and multi-scale process engineering of CCS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> The second installment presented an update on developments in amine scrubbing, ionic liquids, oxy-combustion and calcium looping. New topics added in this second paper include chemical looping combustion, low temperature adsorbents, direct air capture technologies, flexible CCS operation, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transport and storage, and a historical overview of the UK and EU CCS policy and legislation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">Distinct from the previous installments, this third paper sets out to comprehensively review the state-of-the-art developments in CCS, whilst also providing a holistic perspective on the role of CCS technologies in mitigating anthropogenic climate change. We first discuss the current status of CCS development and highlight key CCS technologies that are near commercialisation phase (Section 2). Then in Section 3 we contextualise CCS technology by considering its representation and utilisation in integrated assessment models (IAMs), challenging the view that it is a “bridging technology”, likely to be relevant for only a few decades. We then go on to quantify and qualify the role and value of CCS at a more granular level by evaluating the way in which CCS interacts with national scale electricity systems. This in turn helps us address the question of what service CCS provides to the electricity system, with whom is CCS competing and what technologies does CCS complement.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">We then move on to consider the utility of CCS in decarbonising the industrial sector, with a focus on the key emitters – the production of iron and steel, cement and oil refining and petrochemicals. Throughout, we aim to challenge the perception that industrial CCS is uniquely costly, showing that, for example, the cost of decarbonising the refining sector is essentially “lost in the noise” of market fluctuations of the end use sectors.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Section 4 of the paper considers key post-combustion CCS technologies in detail. The purpose of this paper is not to enumerate the panoply of technologies that are available for capturing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Rather, we focus on solid- and liquid-phase sorbents, and attempt to specify key research questions that need to be address in these areas. We then select three particularly promising alternative technologies for CCS in Section 5: chemical looping combustion, membranes and ionic liquids.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">It is well known that the thermophysical and kinetic properties of the sorbents used for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture dictate both the capital and operating cost of the processes in which they are used. For this reason, there is a concerted effort to rationally design new sorbent materials, with the bulk of the effort in the development of liquid sorbents, where available theories are more readily applied. Thus, we present an assessment of SAFT-based approaches to model and design new materials in Section 6, with a focus on how efforts at the molecular and process scales might be linked.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Before CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can be safely and reliably sequestered, it must be transported from source to sink. Whilst the majority of studies assume pipeline transport, ship and rail transport are potential alternatives; these other transport options are discussed in Section 7. Similarly, despite the fact that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transport by pipeline is exceptionally mature, the impact of capturing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from a diverse set of power and industrial sources on the quality of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> being transported is sufficiently important to warrant careful consideration.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The typical fate of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is to be sequestered, either in a saline aquifer or, potentially, used for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The various challenges of operation, monitoring and verification of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage are discussed in Section 8, whereas Section 9 discusses CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR. A potential alternative to the storage of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is its re-use – the valorisation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to produce marketable compounds. The argument is sometimes made that this can both contribute to climate change mitigation and provide an attractive revenue stream. Section 10 discusses the potential for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and utilisation (CCU), also its merits and challenges are presented and considered.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">In light of the global commitment achieved in Paris in December, 2015,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> we have extended this paper to include key negative emissions technologies (Section 12); bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) and direct air capture of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (DAC). These areas are of particular importance owing to their potential importance and their controversy.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Despite the fact that there are currently 37 CCS projects at various stages in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Asia-Pacific,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit4"><sup><span class="sup_ref">4</span></sup></a> CCS continues to languish as an “orphan technology”.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn1">†</a> With decades of technical experience across the entire value chain, it is clear that it is not a lack of technical expertise that is inhibiting the commercial deployment of CCS technology. Thus, we have devoted a section of this paper to consider “what needs to happen” from a commercial perspective (Section 13), drawing upon experience developed as part of the UK's most recent CCS commercialisation programme.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit5"><sup><span class="sup_ref">5</span></sup></a> Having provided this perspective from the private sector, we then complement this with an international analysis of the political economy of CCS (Section 14). Section 15 then concludes with a proposed approach to evaluate the utility of a “novel technology” and feasibility of particular targets by identifying limitations that might prove to be showstoppers.</p>

        <span>Chemical absorption (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, using aqueous amine solutions) has been used to remove CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from natural gas for decades,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> thus, it is considered to have a TRL of 9.

        <h3 id="sect1107"><span class="b_heading">CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage</span></h3>
        <span>As many commercial-scale CCS projects already use CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-enhanced oil recovery (EOR), 13 of the 17 operating commercial-scale CCS projects, there is a significant amount of existing experience and knowledge, which has enabled CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR to reach TRL 9. Similarly, saline formations have been used for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage at commercial-scale project, including Sleipner CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> Storage, Snøhvit CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> Storage and Quest (on-shore and off-shore).

        <span>There are a number of facilities that utilise CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for various applications. These commercial CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilisation processes are TRL 9 as they are mature technologies.

        <span>Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) have been at the heart of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) assessment of pathways towards keeping average global warming to less than 2 °C within this century.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> They provide a means to explore the future role of particular technologies in meeting climate targets such as renewables or nuclear.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">CCS is one of the very attractive options in the IAMs mitigation portfolios, as it has a number of advantages. First, CCS can be integrated into existing energy systems without requiring large amendments to the system itself. Clearly, renewable technologies become more expensive at high penetration rates as a result of the need for the infrastructure to accommodate intermittency.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> Furthermore, CCS is a viable option for the decarbonisation of emission-intensive industries such as cement production (specific industrial CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture costs are given in Section 3.3).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> And finally, CCS can be combined with low-carbon or carbon-neutral bioenergy (BECCS) to generate negative emissions,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit31"><sup><span class="sup_ref">31</span></sup></a><span class="italic">i.e.</span> while the cultivation of the feedstock biomass sequesters about as much CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as is generated during the process of producing energy (bio-electricity or biofuels), additionally capturing the latter leads to a withdrawal of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the atmosphere.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32</span></sup></a> BECCS has the double benefit of mitigating emissions and generating energy, making it attractive from the cost-optimisation perspective of an IAM.</p>

          <span id="sect1193"/><span class="c_heading_indent">3.1.1 CCS in integrated assessment models (IAMs). </span>
          <span>Based on the model intercomparison study by Koelbl <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> some general statements on the implementation of CCS in IAMs can be made. In some cases, CCS is modelled as a lump-sum add-on cost to the technology it is combined with, while other models separate capture costs and transport &amp; storage and a few separate all cost items. The latter modes obviously give more detail about the CCS supply chain, which enables modellers to also test the sensitivity of results to individual cost components. All IAMs include at least the power sector for CCS and many also cover industry and liquid fuels/hydrogen/gas production. At least 1 sector is also eligible for BECCS (in- and excluding liquid fuels), but many IAMs cover up to 3 sectors with BECCS. There is quite a divergence with respect to the assumption about CCS lifetimes, ranging from 30 to 60 years (partially depending on the technology), though most of the models assume around 40 years. It is also interesting in this light that there are some models not allowing early retirement of CCS plants. Almost all of the IAMs of the model intercomparison assume that CCS investment costs develop according to an exogenous constant (often declining); only two have endogenous learning.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn3">§</a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">Finally, concerning storage, while many models have a regional differentiation of storage capacity, only a few models allow for international trade in storage capacity. The maximum capacity ranges between 3500 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> cumulative, and unlimited storage. Transportation and storage cost (excluding capture cost) varied between 10–300 US$ per ton CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, depending on model and storage type.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> All of the models considered transportation and storage costs at the lower end of this range. Models that also considered high transportation and storage cost include the POLES model (upper range value of $300 USD) and the GRAPE model (upper range cost of $262 USD).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> The higher values for storage cost are associated with options that were offshore, enhanced coal bed methane (ECBM) and at greater depths (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, 2000–3000m).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit34"><sup><span class="sup_ref">34</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">The IAMs thus differ widely in their deployment of CCS, yet the model intercomparison, which is the basis for the numbers cited above, could not explain the divergence of results on the basis of model type, model assumptions or the way in which CCS has been modelled.

            <p class="otherpara">Furthermore, the authors do not find a decreasing role for CCS over time. On the contrary, the CCS share in primary energy is mostly higher in the second half of the century compared to the first. In particular, the ranges for capture rates in Koelbl <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a> are 5–23 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year in 2050 and 8–50 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year in 2100. This undermines the reputation of CCS as a bridging technology and further underlines its importance in IAMs, which seek to achieve ambitious climate targets. The importance is further enhanced under pessimistic assumptions about technological development of renewable energy for a given climate target, indicating little flexibility for the cost-optimal deployment of alternatives.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">Finally, the use of BECCS<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn8">‡‡</a> in the models’ CCS fuel portfolio increases with the stringency of the target. This is mostly connected to substitution for coal and natural gas over time. In response to the concerns with respect to large-scale cultivation of biomass for BECCS and the reservations concerning CCS discussed above, the EMF models also produced a whole array of scenarios limiting the use of both biomass and CCS. Although these scenarios achieve the same target, they are consistently characterised by higher costs, which is consistent with earlier findings by <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Azar <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit49"><sup><span class="sup_ref">49</span></sup></a> and later confirmed by the results of the IPCC's AR5.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">In the absence of CCS, the total cost of climate change mitigation increased by 138%, whereas limited bioenergy availability increased cost by 64%.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn9">§§</a><small><sup>6</sup></small> The integration of CCS into an energy system provides a significantly greater reduction in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions compared to wind technology.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a> With limited CCS and biomass availability, the deployment of nuclear, intermittent solar/wind, interconnection and gas-fired power needs to increase, consequently leading to higher total system cost.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit51"><sup><span class="sup_ref">51</span></sup></a> The increase in mitigation cost is associated with the delay in technology deployment<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit6"><sup><span class="sup_ref">6</span></sup></a> (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, more time to establish infrastructure), use of more expensive technologies (nuclear), and maintaining grid stability (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, intermittency requires the addition of “back-up” capacity and part-load/flexible operation).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">In particular, the IPCC scenarios associated with a more than even chance of achieving the 2 °C target are characterised by average capture rates of 10 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year in 2050 and 25 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year in 2100 and cumulative storage of 800–3000 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> by the end of the century.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> With respect to finding more expensive mitigation strategies when CCS is not available, it is important to note that under these circumstances, there are actually a significant number of IAMs, which do not find a feasible solution at all: Riahi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit52"><sup><span class="sup_ref">52</span></sup></a> conduct a model intercomparison, where a third of the IAMs do not find a feasible solution at 450 ppm without CCS under optimal circumstances. If there is further delay in mitigation, this share drops to a fifth. In other words, the target is not just more expensive to reach, but not reachable at all, given the current parameterisation of the models.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">In addition, the AR5 scenarios have been under scrutiny for their deployment of CCS in conjunction with bioenergy. The 101 out of 116 scenarios leading to concentration levels of 430–480 ppm CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-equivalent (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>eq.) (considered to be consistent with a 66% probability of limiting warming to below 2 °C) require global net negative emissions between 2050 and 2100.

            <span>What is currently available in terms of 1.5 °C IAM scenarios is much less than what is presented above on 2 °C from the IPCC's AR5. This subsection draws on work from Rogelj <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> and Luderer <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> which offer an assessment of what is currently available on 1.5 °C.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn10">¶¶</a></span>
            <p class="otherpara">The most outstanding feature that systematically distinguishes the 1.5 °C from the 2 °C IAM scenarios examined in Rogelj <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> is that there is not a single pathway with a 50% probability of achieving the target without overshooting it until 2100. That is, the average global temperature increase will at some point exceed 1.5 °C, before returning to this level at the end of the century.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">This implies that much of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emitted in the first half of the century will need to be removed from the atmosphere again. In other words, emissions have to be negative at some point. Indeed, the analysis in Rogelj <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit55"><sup><span class="sup_ref">55</span></sup></a> shows that there are no feasible 1.5 °C scenarios without negative emissions. In particular, the cumulative negative emissions are between 450 and 1000 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> until 2100. This is in stark contrast to some 2 °C scenarios, which do manage to reach their target without carbon removals. Luderer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit56"><sup><span class="sup_ref">56</span></sup></a> point out that energy efficiency improvements can have this effect for 2 °C scenarios.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">In the current IAMs, these negative emissions are primarily achieved by the deployment of BECCS.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn11">||||</a> This has triggered a discussion reflecting on large concerns not only about CCS (<span class="italic">cf.</span> discussion in Section 3.1), but also with respect to the implications of the large amounts of biomass that would be needed to achieve sufficient scales to reach the level of negative emissions needed for ambitious climate change mitigation. In an ex-post assessment of the amounts of negative emissions through BECCS in the IPCC's AR5, Smith <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> estimated the range of land area, costs, water and nutrients footprints and biophysical effects. They find that, indeed, the areas of land, which would be needed, are large (380–700 Mha by 2100).<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn12">***</a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Relating the primary energy of the biomass (in EJ) used in BECCS to the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored geologically is complex. This relationship strongly depends on the choices made in the cultivation, harvesting, transport and utilisation of the biomass throughout the BECCS supply chain. Assuming that all of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sequestered by the biomass is assumed to be released in the flue gas upon combustion, the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sequestered per MJ of biomass would then depend on the capture rate applied at the BECCS facility, the biomass carbon content, the biomass heating value and the biomass carbon footprint. Considering a capture rate between 60% and 90%, a biomass carbon content between 45%<small><sub>dry</sub></small> and 50%<small><sub>dry</sub></small>, an HHV<small><sub>dry</sub></small> between 18 and 20 MJ kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> (dry mass) and biomass carbon footprint between 0 and 36 g<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> MJ<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sequestered would be found to be between 14 and 92 g<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> MJ<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. One EJ of biomass could thus capture between 14 and 92 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year, resulting in an annual requirement of between 130 and 860 EJ by 2100 to capture 12 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a> however, the total primary energy supply in 2100 is expected to grow to 1300–1800 EJ.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit64"><sup><span class="sup_ref">64</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">Smith <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> also point to other negative emission technologies, which could complement BECCS to alleviate the pressure on land that is also needed to feed a growing population, host biodiversity and many other ecosystem services. The dominance of BECCS in the current scenarios may be due to the fact that other options (see <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>) are not included in the models. Incorporating other negative emission technologies could potentially lead to a lower uptake of BECCS, assuming that these other technologies are cost-competitive in comparison to BECCS, especially in scenarios limiting CCS and/or biomass use.</p>

          <span>As the IAM community is moving towards producing input for the Special Report on 1.5 °C – upon invitation from the UNFCCC – in order to inform climate negotiations at COP23 in 2018 (and eventually the sixth assessment cycle), there are two developments, which could alter the role of CCS in their models.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The first is related to the above-mentioned concerns with respect to the high share of BECCS in low-stabilisation portfolios. More research along the lines of Smith <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit61"><sup><span class="sup_ref">61</span></sup></a> and Fajardy and Mac Dowell<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a> will help to shed light on the implications for other policy goals such as ensuring food security, as well as biodiversity and other ecosystem services. In addition, as can be seen in the adopted outline for the Special Report,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit65"><sup><span class="sup_ref">65</span></sup></a> climate change mitigation is closely embedded into a broader context of sustainable development, indicating that the new scenarios will also be designed to reflect a wider set of policy objectives.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The second development is the growing body of knowledge on other options for negative emissions and their interplay with what is currently included in the IAMs. There are already some IAMs that are experimenting with the integration of enhanced weathering<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit66"><sup><span class="sup_ref">66</span></sup></a> and direct air capture (DAC) is also an important candidate for integration into the IAMs despite current uncertainty on technical performance and cost.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">The main CCS research priorities in IAMs include:</p>
          <p class="otherpara">• More within-model studies to understand better the interactions between CCS characteristics and modelled deployment/cumulative storage, which are difficult to discern in model intercomparisons.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit33"><sup><span class="sup_ref">33</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">• Update parameterisation with new insights from CCS research and demonstration.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">• Within-model studies also to better understand system dynamics.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">• Complement with geographically explicit techno-economic engineering approaches and geological suitability analysis to identify key areas for deployment and more realistic potentials.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit32"><sup><span class="sup_ref">32,68</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">• Explore scenarios considering technology choice depending on institutional barriers and social acceptance.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">• Include other negative emissions options (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> direct air capture, soil carbon sequestration, enhanced weathering) in addition to BECCS to decrease competition for storage capacity, and biomass (also other side effects, such as competition for land and water<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit63"><sup><span class="sup_ref">63</span></sup></a>).</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Clearly, as ambitions become higher and action is further delayed, CCS will continue to play an important role in mitigation pathways. Broadening the portfolio of energy options to include CCS would improve the affordability of a near-zero emissions energy system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit69"><sup><span class="sup_ref">69</span></sup></a> This is especially true in the case of combining it with bioenergy to generate negative emissions.

The UK has also adopted the 20–20–20 targets proposed by the European Commission.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86</span></sup></a> This requires approximately 30% of electricity to come from renewable sources by 2020 to achieve the UK's overall target of 15% of primary energy from renewable sources, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, solar, wind and biomass, however, excludes nuclear and CCS.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit86"><sup><span class="sup_ref">86,87</span></sup></a> This has led to a suite of policies that have subsidised the production of electricity from renewable sources. A significant proportion of this has come from intermittent sources such as wind and photovoltaic (PV). In financial year 2014/15, more than 50 TWh (representing 15% of the 340 TWh generated) was from intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit88"><sup><span class="sup_ref">88</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">It has been proposed that the UK could generate a very high proportion (if not all) its energy from IRES.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89–91</span></sup></a> However, there are a number of issues that are likely to arise that could be expensive to solve or could ultimately limit the penetration of IRES. The three main factors that may constrain IRES deployment:</p>
          <p class="otherpara">(1) IRES technologies do not displace firm capacity on a one for one basis, nor do they typically provide ancillary services such as inertia, frequency response, or reserve capacity;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">(2) Their intermittent output and the relatively unpredictable element of their output demand more of these ancilliary services from the grid than conventional plants;<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50,51</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">(3) The highly correlated nature of the wind and sun across the UK means that at high penetration level, IRES output is weighted towards periods of surplus and away from times of system shortages. Consequently, the surplus causes wind output to be curtailed and become increasingly lower in value (market cannibalisation<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn13">†††</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit92"><sup><span class="sup_ref">92</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">Many studies have considered some of the costs that arise from integrating IRES.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit93"><sup><span class="sup_ref">93</span></sup></a> However, in addition to cost, it is vital to include the above issues and consider the need to balance energy, whilst also considering the margin of firm capacity over peak demand and the provision of response, reserve and inertial services. Using the BERIC model,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit94"><sup><span class="sup_ref">94</span></sup></a> we provide some new analysis of these issues here.</p>

Although this approach has value for the comparison of a homogeneous set of thermal technologies providing a similar service (energy, firm capacity, reserve, response, inertia, <span class="italic">etc.</span>), it is no longer relevant when comparing technologies that deliver only a selection of these services, and nor does it account for the effects seen here where the effectiveness of a technology is strongly dependant on the existing grid mix.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50,51,71,94,116</span></sup></a></span>

The technologies are in general (with the exception of direct capture) conceptually similar to their counterparts in power generation, though it is notable that calcium looping utilises one of the feed stocks for cement production (CaO) as its main sorbent; this leads to significant synergies between the cement process and Ca looping. Direct capture has no obvious analogue; it utilises indirect radiative heating of the limestone-containing raw meal feed to the system to “directly” produce a pure stream of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Both direct capture and oxy-fuelled systems have the potential for efficiency gains within the system, owing to either thermodynamic benefits (direct capture) or a reduction in the total amount of thermal “ballast” in the system by eliminating the nitrogen from air.</p>

Some recent work by Leeson <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120,121</span></sup></a> found that, when adjusted to a consistent year and currency basis, costs for calcium looping were between $20 and $75 per tonne of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> avoided (central estimate ∼$40), oxy-fuel was around $60 (only one estimate was found in the academic literature) and amine scrubbing was significantly higher, between $65 and $165 with a central estimate of ∼$106. The single study referenced in Leeson <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit120"><sup><span class="sup_ref">120</span></sup></a> was conducted by Mott-MacDonald (with input from Whitehopleman and the British Cement Association) and was a comparison between post-combustion and oxy-fuel capture.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">157</span></sup></a> Importantly, this study only considered “partial” oxy-firing, of only the pre-calciner, the sealing of the large rotating kiln, heat transfer changes within the kiln, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, being considered to be sufficiently challenging that deployment in the “near future with moderate risk” was unlikely. However, it was stated that no “showstoppers” were found in the potential future deployment of a fully oxy-fired system, though this was an area for basic R&amp;D. Post-combustion capture using amine scrubbing was shown to be nearly three times more expensive. This is because of two main issues – the requirement to protect the amines used from NO<small><sub><span class="italic">X</span></sub></small> and SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, the clean-up of which necessitates a selective catalytic reduction and wet scrubbing system, respectively; and the heavily increased fuel-burn, owing to the paucity of low-grade heat in the system. One point of note is that because the kiln would not be converted to oxy-firing in the above study, the amine scrubbing system captured significantly more CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (74% <span class="italic">vs.</span> 61%). It was also noted that integration of a cement plant with a nearby power plant would significantly reduce the costs for post-combustion capture (allowing the transfer of steam from the power station to effect the regeneration of the amines), though presumably similar benefits would accrue if an oxy-fuelled plant were located next to an oxy-fuelled power station with an oversized ASU. A recent paper<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit158"><sup><span class="sup_ref">158</span></sup></a> examining the application of calcium looping to cement manufacture found that calcium looping had a high avoided CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (94%) in comparison to an partially oxy-fuelled plant modelled (76%); the same group has modelled the integration of a calcium looping system with a power plant and export of the spent CaO to a cement works;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">159</span></sup></a> this yields some of the lowest potential costs seen for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> avoidance in cement manufacture, though the fuel-based emissions in the cement plant are not fully addressed. The minimum cost of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> avoided in the combined system was approximately 27 £ per tonne. Of course, such integration would require the co-location of the two plants, which may be geographically challenging.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">It was noted in Barker <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">157</span></sup></a> that building a plant in a far-eastern location would be significantly cheaper (more than 50% cheaper) than building it in a European location. Another study<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit160"><sup><span class="sup_ref">160</span></sup></a> investigating the application of post-combustion solvent scrubbing to cement production in a similar location (China), but for a retrofit, found a cost of $70 per tonne of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> avoided (in this case, a CHP plant was used to make up for the lack of low-grade heat to regenerate the amines). This paper was one of the first to make the case for “carbon capture readiness” for the cement industry. This subject was also explored by Hills <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">145</span></sup></a> who also considered the technology readiness levels (TRLs) for different CCS technologies applied to the cement industry. The TRLs for amine scrubbing, calcium looping and partial oxy-fuel were assessed to be at or near to 6, with full oxy-fuel being a little lower (4) and direct capture somewhere in between. This work also made it clear that because cement-plant renovation and capture plant construction are likely to take similar lengths of time, it would likely save time and money to synchronise these. Discussions with cement manufacturers<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">161</span></sup></a> similarly have underlined the long lifespans of cement plants and the razor-sharp margins in this industry; it has also long been known that some form of tariff is required to maintain a level playing field between regions with regulated CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions and those not subject to such controls.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit123"><sup><span class="sup_ref">123,162</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">There is a renewed drive to apply CCS to industrial processes.

          <span>The first and most important point to make about the petrochemical sector is its strong underpinning expertise in many aspects of the individual elements and the whole system associated with CCS. This comes about through expertise in managing geological formations and reservoir engineering, offshore technologies, high pressure systems and safety, pipeline design, construction and operation and management of large, multi-partner, multibillion dollar projects with cross-party risk. This is complemented by the large balance sheets, access to low cost finance and comprehensive value chain relationships. Hence, one could argue that any large scale deployment of CCS would most likely be done in partnership with major players in this sector. Ten companies in the sector have recently established the oil and gas climate initiative (OGCI) in recognition of their capabilities and responsibilities in this area.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">166</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">The sector is responsible for approximately 6% of total global CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit167"><sup><span class="sup_ref">167</span></sup></a> and these are distributed across the value chain from exploration and production, refining and downstream petrochemical production. Although in this analysis we are excluding the downstream use of the products, it is worth noting that the use of the industry's products in power generation, heating and transport is responsible for approximately 50% of global emissions.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The relevant experience of this sector is broad, with a comprehensive understanding of relevant issues to CCS: geology, licensing, site operation, safety, high pressure operation/transport, and offshore engineering. Particularly, the oil and gas industry has considerable experience in upstream processing, which involves gas sweetening and produced CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, as well as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-enhanced oil recovery (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR) with the associated CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transport and injection infrastructure.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An interesting macroeconomic feature of this industry sector is the large swings in crude oil price (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> between approximately $40 to $140 per bbl<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">168</span></sup></a>) and that the price differentials that the industry must manage are considerably lower than the marginal cost of CCS applied to different elements of the value chain discussed below. For the sake of argument, assuming that approximately 17.2% of the feedstock is used as internal energy in the process for production, conversion and logistics (assuming an energy return on investment of 11<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">169</span></sup></a> and a refinery efficiency of 91%<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit170"><sup><span class="sup_ref">170,171</span></sup></a>) and a very conservative decarbonisation cost of $200 per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>, the additional cost per barrel of crude oil would be $13, a figure easily contained within the recent price fluctuations, which in turn have been well borne by the end-use sectors.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The downstream sector of the oil and gas industry was particularly challenging to decarbonise, while contributing around 4% of global CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">172</span></sup></a> Oil refineries offer a particular challenge here owing to their large, integrated nature, the heterogeneity of these facilities in general and finally the potentially large number of point sources in any given installation (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> heaters, furnaces, boilers, crackers and utilities), which themselves have the potential to be diverse in terms of flow rate and composition and which may need innovative concepts in retrofit and exploring trade-offs between aggregating flue gas sources for centralised capture and aggregating CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> streams.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">There are some point sources of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> at a refinery that are relatively easy to mitigate, such as catalytic crackers – decarbonisation of these units should be a high priority. It was further noted that decarbonising a complex refinery might require the use of more than one capture technology. A report produced for the UK Government in 2015 estimated that a new, efficient refinery exploiting CCS where most economic could have CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions which are 36% of a 2012 baseline.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">173</span></sup></a> Refineries also benefit from locations favourable to CCS such as being near coasts and/or industrial hubs and therefore should have ready access to CCS infrastructure should it arise. Examples of such locations in Europe include Grangemouth and Rotterdam.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A variety of technologies for carbon capture have been considered for refining, including classical post-combustion capture (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Andersson <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">174</span></sup></a> who explore how excess waste heat can be exploited), oxy-combustion (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Escudero <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">175</span></sup></a> who consider utility boilers and find that it is an economically viable technology under certain scenario assumptions) and chemical looping combustion (CLC). The latter is interesting because the refinery light gases are suitable CLC fuels<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176</span></sup></a> and from an engineering point of view, refinery designers and operators have experience of engineering and controlling hot solids looping processes in terms of fluid catalytic cracking.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">177</span></sup></a> One obvious quick win is the hydrogen production plant<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">178</span></sup></a> (mainly used for fuel upgrading) which by its nature produces a relatively pure stream of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> which would require basic post-processing prior to compression and transport.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An important factor to consider is whether the end-use emissions would grow with an increase in hydrocarbon production (considering both conventional and unconventional oil and gas and in particular the scope for increased gas production), and how these emissions can be mitigated at source. This can for example be based on-site hydrocarbon reforming to produce hydrogen with simultaneous storage of the associated CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> which may have the potential to be a more cost-effective option than the production of hydrocarbon and the subsequent capture and storage of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Australia and Japan are planning such a supply chain, using Australian coal as the primary resource (initially without CCS) and shipping liquid hydrogen to Japan.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">179</span></sup></a> More generally, while it is relatively commonplace for countries to produce and distribute CH<small><sub>4</sub></small>, in the future gas exporting countries might reform the CH<small><sub>4</sub></small> as a matter of course, exporting the resulting H<small><sub>2</sub></small> and using the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for enhanced oil or gas recovery. This would have the effect of removing concern about CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> – enhanced hydrocarbon recovery; if the carbon is being immediately returned to the subsurface, then there can be no subsequent CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emission when the hydrogen is being used for heat, power or transport.</p>

      <h2 id="sect1939"><span class="a_heading">4 Post-combustion capture technology</span></h2>

        <span>The classic chemical absorbent for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation applications is 20–30 wt% aqueous monoethanolamine (MEA). It was proposed in the original patent from 1930 for an amine process to separate acid gases<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> and has found widespread use in industry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a> MEA is particularly suited to low CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> partial pressure applications and as a consequence has become the benchmark amine for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture from electricity generation. In a standard CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation process applied to flue gas (10–15 kPa CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) at 40 °C, and using 30 wt% MEA and 90% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> removal, typical minimum stripper reboiler duties are ∼3.6–4.0 GJ per tonne CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured. This value has been validated at small to medium pilot scale in a number of studies.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit181"><sup><span class="sup_ref">181–184</span></sup></a> The reboiler energy requirement is not the only metric that defines the performance of an absorbent, but reducing this value is the primary goal of much chemical absorbent research, and new absorbents are typically benchmarked against the value for 30 wt% MEA. Rates of mass transfer, stability in the presence of oxygen and elevated temperature, volatility, solids formation, toxicity and biodegradability and price are also important in real world flue gas applications. New absorbents are also benchmarked against MEA in terms of these characteristics. MEA has good rates of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mass transfer, is low cost and readily biodegradable but suffers from moderate rates of oxidative and thermal degradation and moderate levels of toxicity.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">180</span></sup></a> It is also corrosive when used at higher concentrations.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Research and development of new absorbents for flue gas applications has been ongoing for a number of decades. These new absorbents perform better than MEA in some or all of these characteristics. This suggests it may be time to move on from MEA and choose one of the new generation of absorbents for benchmarking purposes. As an example the formulation of aqueous piperazine (PZ) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) has been extensively studied. This blend has achieved ∼3 GJ per tonne CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured at pilot scale and also has favourable mass transfer and stability properties.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">185,186</span></sup></a> Commercial solvent technologies are also potential benchmark solvents, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Econamine FG+, KS-1, and Cansolv.

        <p class="otherpara">In the following sections state of the art amine-based and multi-phase chemical absorbents will be discussed. These will be limited to absorbents that have been characterised in detail and progressed from the lab scale at least to small pilot scale testing.

          <p class="otherpara">The blend of PZ and AMP is probably the best known and well characterised of new absorbent formulations. AMP is a very similar molecule to MEA, but with two additional methyl groups located at the α-carbon position. AMP is a sterically hindered amine highlighted in the work of Sartori and Savage.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit213"><sup><span class="sup_ref">213</span></sup></a> Being sterically hindered, it has greater absorption capacity than sterically unhindered primary and secondary amines, but it suffers from low rates of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mass transfer at low CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> loadings. Steric hindrance affects the absorption capacity of an amine by reducing the stability of the carbamate species formed either by crowding of the reactive site and/or electronic effects, resulting in increased bicarbonate formation. However in the case of crowding (which is the case for AMP), it may also affect mass transfer by reducing the intrinsic rate of reaction between CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and the amino group. Seo and Hong<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit214"><sup><span class="sup_ref">214</span></sup></a> proposed the addition of PZ and so developed a PZ/AMP formulation.

          <span>Many new absorbents are under development at the bench scale, however very few have progressed to small scale pilot plant studies outside of the cloistered halls of technology vendors. This testing in a complete process is a critical step for the development of absorbents. Issues that may not be apparent in a laboratory environment come to the fore. For example the hydrodynamics, volatility and degradation behaviour when exposed to high shear gas flows, pumping through pipework and continuous heating and cooling for extended periods is difficult to replicate in any one laboratory experiment. So it is critical that new absorbents that show promise using the traditional metrics of capture performance are moved on to testing at pilot scale. Only this will allow the development of a more complete understanding of the critical factors that ultimately lead to success and failure.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">In terms of developing the perfect amine for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture, this is a challenging task. The most common approach to-date has been to assess the performance of existing amine molecules. As a consequence of the knowledge gained doing this, there is now considerable understanding of the relationship between chemical structure and absorption performance and stability. The next generation of amines will be less a product of discovery and more a product of targeted task specific molecular design and synthesis, with multiple amino groups having complementary properties contained in single molecules. A few studies have started down this path<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit260"><sup><span class="sup_ref">260–263</span></sup></a> with initial results looking promising. There is growing interest in water-lean solvents (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, ionic liquids, non-aqueous organic amine blends), which exhibit lower reboiler duty and higher mass transfer properties compared to aqueous formulations. However, water-lean solvent tend to be more expensive and testing has been limited to lab-scale (∼3 L).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit187"><sup><span class="sup_ref">187</span></sup></a> As expertise in the relevant synthetic chemistry increases, and these task specific molecules become available in larger quantities and at lower cost, they are likely to outperform and outlast the current suit of amines.</p>

By far, the greatest research efforts have been directed at developing improved adsorbents with higher working capacity for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, better selectivity, and better tolerance to impurities. New CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture adsorbents are reported almost daily. The classical adsorbents (carbons, aluminas, silicas, zeolites) and modifications thereof have all been evaluated for their potential in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture applications and new adsorbents (metal organic frameworks, hydrotalcites, amine supported adsorbents, polymers, high temperature metal oxides) have all been explored for their application in a range of areas.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267–270</span></sup></a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">Leaving aside developments in adsorbents, important as they may be, there have also been important developments and progress in adsorption processes for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture over the last three decades.

          <span>Adsorption is an attractive technology for a number of reasons. It can be retrofitted to any power plant should the adsorption column be optimised to ensure acceptable footprint and cost. In addition, it can cover a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions so that low, medium and high temperatures adsorbents can be used and adsorbents for both pre- and post-combustion settings can be designed – here we focus on low temperature adsorbents for post-combustion (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, &lt;200 °C). It is worth noting that adsorption is particularly well-suited for air capture as it involves very low CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentrations. However, this is beyond the scope of this section. Air capture is discussed in Section 12.2 and further information on air capture using adsorption is available in other papers.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit272"><sup><span class="sup_ref">272–274</span></sup></a> While there is no direct and fully comprehensive way to assess the economics and energetics of adsorption compared to those of absorption, many indicators points to the cost reduction enabled by adsorption.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit275"><sup><span class="sup_ref">275</span></sup></a> Another strength of adsorption is the potentially minimal environmental footprint <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> amine-based solvents, which tend to decompose and form toxic and/or corrosive compounds. The use of waste materials as adsorbents could potentially enhance the sustainability of the process, though life cycle assessment would be needed to confirm that aspect.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit276"><sup><span class="sup_ref">276</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">Considering the aforementioned strengths, pilot-scale CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption projects have been proposed and implemented, enabling the community to acquire the knowledge, skills and expertise needed to improve the technological maturity of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption. Among them, there is the CO2CRC H3 capture project based at the International Power plant in Australia which operated from 2009 to 2011.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit277"><sup><span class="sup_ref">277</span></sup></a> Besides adsorption, the project also investigated the potential of absorption and membrane processes for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture from a coal-fired power plant.

          <span>Worldwide projects deploying CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption technology at a large-scale are few compared to those that employ absorption technologies. This gap is particularly striking given the ∼120 reviews on carbon capture (including CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorption) in the past five years.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2,280–288</span></sup></a> One plausible reason for this gap is that the number of possible adsorbent materials is enormous and the task of synthesising and testing them all is daunting. This is particularly so for the case of ‘designer sorbents’ such as metal organic frameworks (MOFs), which counts thousands of compounds already synthesised and millions more that are possible. High-throughput simulation techniques therefore have a key role in quickly screening for successful CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> adsorbing structures. One interesting approach uses a global approach to screen thousands of zeolites and MOFs for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture solely based on their parasitic energy demand.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit289"><sup><span class="sup_ref">289</span></sup></a> This methodology is limited however to crystalline adsorbents and does not take into account aspects such as materials robustness to cycling or competitive adsorption with other flue gas components.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The complexity of the screening challenge arising from the multitude of adsorbents is magnified by the plethora of performance criteria to be considered when designing an adsorbent. These criteria have been reviewed recently and are summarised in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit282"><sup><span class="sup_ref">282</span></sup></a> In addition to the criteria detailed in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab5">Table 5</a>, we add the energy required for regeneration (linked to OPEX) and chemical and thermal robustness. Although many adsorbents have been tested for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture, the focus has only been on their CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake, selectivity and recyclability; these criteria are insufficient for the technical confidence needed to move to higher technology readiness levels. Fortunately, researchers have started to combine experimental data with molecular simulation and process-scale modelling. Thus, incorporating multi-objective optimisation enables quantitative comparison of adsorbents against a number of process performance criteria (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> purity, recovery, energy consumption, productivity).<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit290"><sup><span class="sup_ref">290–296</span></sup></a> For these studies, one needs to specify the process options, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> TSA, PSA or others, and rely on molecular simulation to provide sorption isotherms validated by experiments. It is interesting to note that while the challenge related to the numerous potential sorbents and performance criteria also exists when designing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture solvents (absorption), the complexity in the case of solid sorbents is increased because data on mass-transfer resistance and diffusion limitations are scarce, yet are required to model a full adsorption process.</p>

          <span>There are major engineering obstacles associated with the application of adsorption for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture. The advances in cyclic processes improve the commercialisation potential of adsorption technologies, these developments are discussed below.</span>
          
            <span id="sect2426"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">Pressure vacuum swing adsorption. </span>
            <span>Cyclic adsorption in fixed beds is now a relatively mature technology and all of the various modes of adsorbent regeneration have been applied to carbon capture. For post combustion flue gas at atmospheric pressure, vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) (also sometimes referred to as Pressure Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) since the feed stream might be slightly pressurised) is the logical choice amongst the pressure regeneration modes since the feed stream is mostly nitrogen. A large number of studies of VSA have been carried out, most typically using activated carbon<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300–302</span></sup></a> and 13× zeolite adsorbents<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit303"><sup><span class="sup_ref">303–306</span></sup></a> and a large number of adsorption cycles have been proposed and tested.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit307"><sup><span class="sup_ref">307,308</span></sup></a> The consensus is that if only a single VSA stage is used, significantly deep vacuum levels are required (at least 10 kPa) to achieve specification CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> product purity (&gt;95%) necessary for acceptable CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> recovery using the popular 13× adsorbent. More exotic adsorbents, such as metal organic frameworks (Mg-MOF 74,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit309"><sup><span class="sup_ref">309</span></sup></a> UTSA-16<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit292"><sup><span class="sup_ref">292</span></sup></a>), may be able to improve this situation in the future but these MOFs are unlikely to be available at large scale in the near term. This has led researchers to examine two stage PVSA systems,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit300"><sup><span class="sup_ref">300,310,311</span></sup></a> in which different adsorbents can be used in each stage and there is scope for considerable integration. Of course, the penalty here is a substantial increase in cost. It is also worth pointing out that most PVSA studies have assumed a dry flue gas since the 13× adsorbent suffers severe CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capacity deterioration in the presence of water although Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit312"><sup><span class="sup_ref">312</span></sup></a> have shown that multilayer beds with 13× can be used (although at a significant energy penalty) to handle wet gas streams.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">The energy demand of the VSA process is frequently cited as being considerably less than conventional amine processes. This is not correct. A range of specific energies from 100 kWh per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> to more than 1000 kWh per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> have been reported – the exact number depending greatly on specifics of the process. Most of these quoted numbers rely on unrealistic equations for vacuum pump energy consumption. In one of the few studies in which an experimental energy consumption of 340–580 kWh per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> was reported,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit305"><sup><span class="sup_ref">305</span></sup></a> it was found that theoretical calculations significantly underestimated the true energy required. Reliable reported energies seem to fall between 1.5 to 3 GJ per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> (electrical). This converts to about 4.5 to 9 GJ per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> thermal, substantially more than conventional amine solvent processes (reboiler duty of 2–4 GJ per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>, shown in <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab4">Table 4</a>). Overall, VSA and PSA appears to be more suitable for smaller scale operation and it is difficult to see these fixed bed processes being extended beyond the 50 MW scale for post-combustion capture unless multiple trains are installed, losing economy of scale. Applications for VSA and PVSA are more likely to be in IGCC,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit313"><sup><span class="sup_ref">313</span></sup></a> petrochemical, and steel and cement processes where the gases have higher CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> partial pressures and lower volumetric flow rates.</p>

            <span>A more attractive and scalable regeneration option for post combustion capture is temperature swing adsorption (TSA). Generally, both PSA and TSA are considered mature technologies and have been employed for a number of applications in industrial gas separation.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266,301,314–316</span></sup></a> Temperature swing adsorption has been used for removing trace amounts of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and water from air in Air Separation Units and natural gas dehydration prior to liquefaction. Its application to bulk CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> removal is however, in its infancy. Numerous studies have been reported from the groups of Mazzotti,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit317"><sup><span class="sup_ref">317,318</span></sup></a> Webley,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit319"><sup><span class="sup_ref">319</span></sup></a> and others (Korea,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit320"><sup><span class="sup_ref">320,321</span></sup></a> and RTI,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit322"><sup><span class="sup_ref">322,323</span></sup></a>), which have highlighted the performance and obstacles of this approach. Joss <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit318"><sup><span class="sup_ref">318</span></sup></a> developed improved cycles for TSA operation attaining comparable regeneration energies to solvent based processes.

As their adsorbent was 13× zeolite, which strongly adsorbs water (thereby reducing its CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capacity), there was a need to dry the flue gas stream prior to their TSA. This adds 2–3 GJ per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> to the energy requirement (already comparable to amine-based processes). Pre-drying the flue gas stream is therefore not a feasible option for large scale adsorption based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture, which suggests water tolerant adsorbents (in fact, water non-adsorbing adsorbents) may be needed. The voluminous work on amine-based sorbents fills this requirement.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit324"><sup><span class="sup_ref">324</span></sup></a></span>
            <p class="otherpara">Conventional TSA run in packed beds incurs the significant penalty of long cycle times due to long heating and cooling requirements. To overcome these limitations, fluidised bed configurations are popular for TSA.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit325"><sup><span class="sup_ref">325,326</span></sup></a> The strong mixing enables rapid heat transfer but intense mixing and co-current gas-solid flow leads to lower average CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> loadings (the adsorbent is at equilibrium with the gas leaving the fluidised bed). Pirngruber <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit327"><sup><span class="sup_ref">327</span></sup></a> has estimated a lowest heat of 2.1 GJ per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> (thermal) for ideal adsorbents under isothermal conditions.

            <span>Many of the TSA systems described above rely on indirect heating or heating with hot gas for regeneration. If low-pressure steam is available, this is the preferred option for TSA implementation. Clearly, water tolerant adsorbents are required and functionalised adsorbents (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> amine-based sorbents) are ideal for this application.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit331"><sup><span class="sup_ref">331</span></sup></a> These adsorbents suffer from degradation at very high temperature and poor kinetics at low temperature.

Through this means they were able to obtain high purity (&gt;98% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>) and high recovery (&gt;93%) – difficult to achieve with VSA alone. The reported energy consumption of 1.47 GJ per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> accounts only for the steam usage and apparently does not include vacuum power. A relatively modest vacuum level of 15 kPa was used. This is a promising approach and is worthy of continued effort. Avoiding TSA allowed these workers to retain the use of fixed beds.</span>

Packed beds of adsorbent therefore are eliminated from consideration and carbon monoliths are the most common configuration. Since zeolites offer more benefits for temperature swing adsorption given their strong adsorption of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, they are more attractive for ESA applications.

Further work around adsorber design is also crucial to allow faster cycles since it will directly influence the overall process.

          <p class="otherpara">Industrial scale formulation of some of the novel advanced adsorbents (discussed in Section 4.2.4) will become increasingly important.

          <span id="sect2750"/><span class="c_heading_indent">4.3.1 Current developments. </span>
          <span>The realisation that the lime in the CaL processes suffered rapid deactivation has led to over a decade of work on improving sorbent performance, and reducing deactivation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit397"><sup><span class="sup_ref">397</span></sup></a> The other major issue for CaL is that of attrition or sorbent loss due to mechanical impacts experienced in real fluidised beds, as opposed to the more benign testing environment which is normally provided in a thermogravimetric analyser (TGA), which is still the most common tool used to investigate sorbent performance.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">It was gradually recognised that the typical TGA environment used to assess sorbent performance was associated with major flaws.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit397"><sup><span class="sup_ref">397</span></sup></a> In particular, the chemical environment was unrealistic as it missed both the positive effects of water addition on capture<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit398"><sup><span class="sup_ref">398–400</span></sup></a> and the negative effects of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. More importantly, calcination in N<small><sub>2</sub></small> or environments with low levels of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> at temperatures of 850 °C or below is unrealistic and tends to overestimate sorbent performance. In real systems, it appears that the water content typical of a combustion environment (10–20%) partially compensated for the presence of SO<small><sub>2</sub></small>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit401"><sup><span class="sup_ref">401</span></sup></a> but higher temperatures necessary to drive calcination in the presence of nearly 100% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> always led to a significant deterioration in sorbent performance regardless of the modification process involved.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit402"><sup><span class="sup_ref">402,403</span></sup></a> It is also interesting to note that He <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit404"><sup><span class="sup_ref">404</span></sup></a> have reported a beneficial effect of steam on the ability of carbide slag to capture CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Finally, it is worth noting that steam has been shown to produce clear beneficial effects on the carbonation process; it also appears that it can produce significant benefits in improving sorbent performance when it is added to the calciner of a 100 kW<small><sub>th</sub></small> pilot plant.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit405"><sup><span class="sup_ref">405</span></sup></a> These benefits do not appear to be related to a lowering of the calcination temperature due to the reduction in partial pressure of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit406"><sup><span class="sup_ref">406</span></sup></a> but instead it has been suggested that they are associated with reduction in sintering produced by the lower CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> levels in the calciner.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Despite ample evidence to the contrary, numerous studies on sorbent performance are compromised by the use of low calcination temperatures and unrealistic chemical environments. This has been pointed out again recently by Clough <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit407"><sup><span class="sup_ref">407</span></sup></a> who have suggested a novel TGA protocol to ensure more realistic results are obtained on modified sorbent performance.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Sorbent attrition is another area which has received attention over an extended period. Although there are limestones that perform extremely poorly,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit408"><sup><span class="sup_ref">408</span></sup></a> the fact that there are both fully operational demonstration units and a large number of pilot plants<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit396"><sup><span class="sup_ref">396</span></sup></a> is a clear indication that natural sorbents can perform adequately in CaL processes. Nonetheless, numerous attempts have been made to improve sorbent performance by various kinds of treatment, most notably pelletisation with a support material, often with mixed results (and a critical issue in such evaluations is again that tests be performed under realistic fluidised bed conditions).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit409"><sup><span class="sup_ref">409</span></sup></a> Another critical question for all such attempts is that the cost of such approaches may easily outweigh any benefit in terms of potentially superior performance and/or mechanical resistance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit410"><sup><span class="sup_ref">410</span></sup></a> An interesting result from the work of Erans <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit411"><sup><span class="sup_ref">411,412</span></sup></a> is that some additives may actually weaken the resulting sorbent, and this is only apparent when tests are performed under fluidised bed conditions and that this phenomenon counteracts any reactivity benefit associated with the additive, in this case flour incorporated into the pelletised matrix, to serve as a representative form of biomass addition.</p>

          <span id="sect2783"/><span class="c_heading_indent">4.3.2 Sorbent enhancement and sorbent reactivation. </span>
          <span>Erans <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit411"><sup><span class="sup_ref">411</span></sup></a> have recently provided an overview of the various approaches used to improve the performance of sorbents in Ca looping. These range from hydration, re-carbonation, doping with various reagents, pre-treatments by materials such as organic acids, and re-pelletisation of spent sorbents, as well as the use of methods such as thermal pre-treatment or preparation of extremely active sorbents by techniques like sol–gel or precipitation of calcium carbonate or the preparation of nano-materials. A number of interesting insights have been obtained from this work. Thus, for instance, treatment with organic acids to produce reactive sorbents now appears to be due more to the production of a reactive physical matrix in the sorbent rather than to the chemical changes produced by creating a Ca salt of the organic material.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit413"><sup><span class="sup_ref">413</span></sup></a> Earlier work also demonstrated that pore-size distributions of the sorbent and the changes thereof with cycling/doping are responsible for the differences in reactivity of different limestones.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit414"><sup><span class="sup_ref">414,415</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">The importance of the final physical matrix in terms of ultimate performance of a Ca sorbent has been further demonstrated by mixing low levels of biomass into a pelletised matrix, and observing a significant improvement in sorbent performance,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit416"><sup><span class="sup_ref">416</span></sup></a> which as noted above does not necessarily lead to superior performance in a real fluidised bed system as the resulting material becomes more susceptible to fragmentation and attrition. It should also be noted that while this discussion is focused on limestone, there are many natural Ca-based materials, some of which may well have superior performance, and there is a significant body of literature on the potential of various such materials, some of which appear to have superior capture performance (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, waste marble powders<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit417"><sup><span class="sup_ref">417</span></sup></a>); however, the key issue here will be the overall amounts of such material available for significant removal of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from industrial processes and power production, which is the primary reason for restricting this discussion to limestone and sorbents derived from it, rather than looking at other materials potentially available.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Hydration to form Ca(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small> at temperatures below 500 °C is beneficial due to the formation of cracks in the CaO particles creating paths to the interior of the particles and, therefore, improving CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit418"><sup><span class="sup_ref">418–421</span></sup></a> Another positive effect of hydration is the formation of larger pores; unfortunately, this is also associated with weakening the sorbent matrix, and so any potential benefit can easily be outweighed by sorbent loss due to attrition and elutriation. The hydration reaction:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn4"/><span id="eqn4">CaO + H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O ↔ Ca(OH)<small><sub>2</sub></small> Δ<span class="italic">H</span> = −109 kJ mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small></span></td><td class="rightEqn">(4)</td></tr></table>can be carried out at high pressure to avoid cooling the sorbent and thus reducing the parasitic energy consumption, but this would involve the use of a high-pressure vessel and, at least at this time, it seems likely than any benefits associated with this approach will be outweighed by the potential complexity and cost of such a sub-system.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">An alternative to steam reactivation is to recarbonate the spent sorbent. This was first suggested by Salvador <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit422"><sup><span class="sup_ref">422</span></sup></a> who proposed that recarbonation in high concentrations of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> might be a reactivation strategy.

Initial work in this area focused on making core-in shell pellets of combined CaO/CuO and testing them in a TGA environment,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit430"><sup><span class="sup_ref">430</span></sup></a> and more recently there has been an effort to model the performance of such particles.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit431"><sup><span class="sup_ref">431</span></sup></a></span>

          <span>Why the interest after 100 years given the advantages of other commercially available processes currently used for air separation in <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, oxy-fuel combustion? The large heat of reaction typically involved in the metal oxide redox reaction would initially seem to rule out using <a title="" href="#eqn5">reaction (5)</a> for air separation. Indeed, membrane processes in which oxygen is transferred through a metal oxide structure have many similarities to chemical looping and do not require the addition or removal of heat to drive the cycle of oxidation and reduction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit446"><sup><span class="sup_ref">446</span></sup></a> The answer lies in the temperature at which these process run. Traditional carbon capture processes are based on low temperature absorption or oxygen production <span class="italic">via</span> an air separation unit. Thermodynamics requires work to be expended to separate gases, either the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the flue gases or O<small><sub>2</sub></small> from air. This work can be provided as heat with a certain capacity to do work (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, exergy) or directly as compression work. In low temperature processes, the work is taken directly from the power station, for example, steam bled from the turbine is used for amine scrubbing, steam whose exergy would otherwise have been used to generate electricity. Running a high temperature cyclic process overcomes this limitation in number of ways. Firstly, the heat rejected from the cyclic chemical looping process is at a temperature above the turbine inlet temperature (for a steam plant), meaning that all the heat released can be recovered back into the power cycle. Secondly, heat release from combustion would normally be transferred from a hot flame, to a relatively cold steam cycle, destroying a large amount of the heat's potential to do work. The combustion reaction itself also destroys exergy. Using this heat instead to separate gases, before it is transferred to the power cycle, uses work potential that would otherwise have been lost.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A similar argument can be made for chemical looping combustion, in which the fuel is brought into direct contact with the metal oxide. Here, the exergy loss associated with the combustion reaction itself is partially avoided. Chemical looping combustion was originally proposed as a way to increase the efficiency of fossil fuel power station because it avoided the exergy loss associated with combustion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit447"><sup><span class="sup_ref">447</span></sup></a> Materials for chemical looping combustion need to operate with an equilibrium <span class="italic">p</span>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> &gt; O (10<small><sup>−7</sup></small>); this ensures that the partial pressure of CO (or other un-combusted fuel) is low at the exit of a well-mixed reactor. Iron oxide for example has several oxidation states which can be used to transfer oxygen, the Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>O<small><sub>3</sub></small> to Fe<small><sub>3</sub></small>O<small><sub>4</sub></small> transition has a <span class="italic">p</span>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> of ∼3.6 × 10<small><sup>−7</sup></small> bar at 900 °C which means that, at equilibrium, the ratio of CO to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> would be ∼1 × 10<small><sup>−5</sup></small>, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> near complete combustion.</p>

          <span>For power production, chemical looping combustion has gone from small scale tests in the laboratory, through to pilot scale at the tens of kilowatts through to a scale of around 1 MW (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, the 1 MW<small><sub>th</sub></small> unit at Damstadt<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit448"><sup><span class="sup_ref">448</span></sup></a>). Most work has focussed on interlinked fluidised beds, in which the oxygen carrier is circulated between a fuel reactor (where oxygen is removed from the solid to produce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and water) and the air reactor, where the oxygen carrier is regenerated. Initial research investigated the combustion of gaseous fuels, typically syngas or methane<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">176,449–451</span></sup></a> but more recently the interest has shifted to solid fuels.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit452"><sup><span class="sup_ref">452,453</span></sup></a> Solid fuel combustion typically takes place in two stages: (i) loss of volatile matter, and (ii) combustion of the remaining char or coke. In chemical looping combustion it is relatively easy to envisage the interaction of the gaseous volatile matter and the solid oxygen carrier.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit454"><sup><span class="sup_ref">454</span></sup></a> Combustion of the char with a solid oxygen carrier is more difficult and there is some debate about whether there is any significant interaction between the solid char and the solid oxygen carrier.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit455"><sup><span class="sup_ref">455</span></sup></a> Regardless of the solid–solid interaction, there is a very significant interaction <span class="italic">via</span> gas phase gasification products. For instance, in a reactor which is fluidised by steam or CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, gasification of the solid will lead to combustible gas phase intermediates (CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small>) which can be combusted by the oxygen carriers:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn7"/><span id="eqn7">C + H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O → CO + H<small><sub>2</sub></small></span></td><td class="rightEqn">(7)</td></tr></table><table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn8"/><span id="eqn8">CO + H<small><sub>2</sub></small> + 2MeO → H<small><sub>2</sub></small>O + CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> + 2Me</span></td><td class="rightEqn">(8)</td></tr></table></span>
          <p class="otherpara">This can mean that the rate of solid fuel conversion is actually limited by the rate of gasification of the solid fuel.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit453"><sup><span class="sup_ref">453,456</span></sup></a> Research into the kinetics of the gasification reaction has a long history, beyond the scope of this discussion, however, two important features of relevance to chemical looping are: (i) the big differences in reactivity between different kinds of chars, and (ii) the effect of product inhibition. CO and H<small><sub>2</sub></small> retard the rate of gasification, so when gasification is carried out in the presence of a solid oxygen carrier, the gasification rate is accelerated.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit456"><sup><span class="sup_ref">456–458</span></sup></a> This acceleration rate, although significant, does not lead to an order of magnitude change in the rate of gasification. This means that for coals which produce un-reactive chars, the build-up of char in the system is problematic. The problem is compounded by the use of interlinked reactors if the char is recirculated to the air reactor, where it can burn releasing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> back into the environment.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Two strategies for dealing with the low reactivity char are to: (i) physically separate the char from the oxygen carrier using carbon strippers,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit459"><sup><span class="sup_ref">459</span></sup></a> or (ii) increase the rate of char conversion using CLOU combustion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit460"><sup><span class="sup_ref">460</span></sup></a> In the former, the difference in density is used to separate the char from the oxygen carrier and return it to the fuel reactor, allowing a larger inventory and increased carbon conversion rate. In the latter, oxygen carriers which release gas phase oxygen can be used to increase the carbon conversion rate. Copper(<span class="small_caps">II</span>) oxide<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit461"><sup><span class="sup_ref">461,462</span></sup></a> and manganese based materials (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, mixed oxides of iron and manganese<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit463"><sup><span class="sup_ref">463</span></sup></a> or perovskites based on calcium manganate) all have an equilibrium <span class="italic">p</span>O<small><sub>2</sub></small> which is significant at fuel reactor temperatures and also allow the material to be re-oxidised by air containing 21% oxygen at air reactor temperatures.</p>

          <span id="sect2972"/><span class="c_heading_indent">5.1.4 Economics and the future of chemical looping. </span>
          <span>In terms of economics, chemical looping will usually appear favourable compared with coal-fired power stations fitted with first generation capture technologies. The thermodynamic arguments put forward previously means higher efficiencies and lower costs. However, this argument only holds if capital and running costs, largely the cost of the replacing degraded oxygen carrier, are competitive. In addition, for natural gas powered systems, the chemical looping combustor must be pressurised in order to be integrated with the CCGT, otherwise the unabated chemical looping system would struggle to reach the efficiency of a standard CCGT with first generation capture. A gas-fired system would therefore be comparable to a chemical plant in complexity, but a power station in scale. Ekström <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit464"><sup><span class="sup_ref">464</span></sup></a> assessed the economics of various capture technologies, including CLC as part of the European ENCAP project. For coal, CLC was found to be ∼119% as costly as an unabated reference plant, <span class="italic">versus</span> oxy-fuel combustion with ∼137% the cost of the reference plant. For gas systems, they found CLC gave the lowest penalty of all technologies examined.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Economic assessments must consider the cost and lifetime of the oxygen carrier material, and also the availability of the plant. Paper studies will make sensible assumptions about the availability of the plant, but will not consider the case where the technology fails (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a very low plant availability). This latter point is perhaps what holds back chemical looping technology, in that a chemical looping combustion power plant will be much more complicated than a standard power station, and will require a massive upfront investment. For an investor the risk <span class="italic">versus</span> benefit argument becomes one of confidence in the technology at scale. Research effort has therefore been directed at precisely these issues, both in the (i) development of materials and understanding the costs, and in (ii) developing confidence at scale.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The contribution of the cost of the oxygen carrier to the overall operating cost is proportional to the supply cost and inversely proportional to the material lifetime; cheap easily degraded materials or expensive long lasting materials could perform equally as well. The conceptual design of a 1000 MW coal-fired system is given by,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit465"><sup><span class="sup_ref">465</span></sup></a> assuming a low cost ore (ilmenite or manganese ore) as the oxygen carrier. They assumed a lifetime of only 200 hours and concluded that the contribution to the cost of carbon capture of the oxygen carrier would be €1.3–4 per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small><img class="charmap" align="absbottom" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>captured</sub></small>, less than cost of the final oxy-polishing step. For coal-based systems it is hard to see how a very expensive material could be used, since it will quickly become contaminated with the components of the coal ash. Natural gas systems are cleaner and therefore perhaps easier in this regard. Porrazzo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit466"><sup><span class="sup_ref">466</span></sup></a> modelled the performance of a natural gas-fired CLC system, operating at 10 bar with an oxygen carrier consisting of NiO on alumina ($15.3 per kg). Given the difficulties of presenting consistent economic data, they explored the sensitivity to material lifetime. The levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) fell to a plateau (at around 500–1000 h of lifetime), at which point material cost was no longer significant. To break even with a NGCC system fitted with an amine scrubber, the particles would have to last around 500 to 700 hours. These lifetimes do not seem unreasonably difficult targets to achieve, and it is likely that materials for chemical looping can be made cost effective.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">On building confidence, progress has been made on moving from laboratory tests, through to pilot scale, in order to answer the questions of (i) reliability, and (ii) durability of materials over long-term trials. Recent demonstrations have focussed on larger scale (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, 1 MW<small><sub>th</sub></small> CLC using ilmenite,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit448"><sup><span class="sup_ref">448</span></sup></a> 3 MW<small><sub>th</sub></small> Alstom calcium sulphate process<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit467"><sup><span class="sup_ref">467</span></sup></a> or longer trials (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, 99 hours of operation in a 10 kW CLC system using calcium manganate,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit468"><sup><span class="sup_ref">468</span></sup></a> 200 hours in 25 kW<small><sub>th</sub></small> CDCL system<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit469"><sup><span class="sup_ref">469</span></sup></a>).

          <span>The use of a redox reaction to transfer oxygen between from the air to a process stream is a well-established idea, and processes making use of these solid oxide carriers were proposed in the early 20th Century or earlier. They fell out of favour with the development of modern air separation technologies for the production of oxygen, but are now of interest because of the ability of a chemical looping cycle (operating at a high temperature) to be heat integrated into a power plant flow sheet. Cycles based on chemical looping, theoretically at least, allow power production with carbon capture with very low energy penalties. Moving from theory to practice, particularly at power generation scale, has been the subject of a large research effort in recent years. With the current demonstrations at the megawatt scale, chemical looping has already demonstrated itself to be a promising second generation carbon capture technology.</span>

            <span>Materials exploiting solid-state ion conduction can also be used to fabricate highly selective membranes for use at high temperature. Selectivity is conferred by the fact that, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, an oxygen ion vacancy within an ionic oxide<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn22">¶¶¶¶</a> is unlikely to be occupied by any species other than an oxygen ion due to the very specific chemical environment of that vacancy. However, it may be possible for similarly sized ions such as hydroxyl ions, or fluorine ions, to occupy the vacancy. Oxygen-ion transport may then occur by oxygen ions “hopping” from one vacancy to another. Appropriate oxides to consider for use as membranes include fluorites, pyrochlores, brownmillerites and perovskites. In many cases, such materials can be doped to create intrinsic oxygen defects (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, oxygen-ion vacancies in the case of our discussion), or employed under conditions where oxygen defects will be created as the result of gas-solid reactions with the prevailing atmosphere.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">A membrane that shows pure oxygen vacancy diffusion cannot be employed as a gas separation membrane. A steady flux of ions across such a membrane cannot be achieved due to the development of a potential difference across the membrane. To achieve a steady flux, an equal and opposite flux of another charge carrying species must be permitted, either: (i) through the use of an external circuit (thus becoming a solid state electrochemical cell and not covered here), or (ii) by the introduction of a charge transfer pathway internal to the membrane. In the case that this additional charge carrier is an electron, the material is known as a mixed ion and electron conductor (MIEC). A second example of an ion-transport membrane includes the dual-phase ion-conducting gas separation membranes. These membranes will be discussed in more detail below.</p>

In the case of an oxygen-ion and electron conductor, if there is equilibrium on both sides of the membrane between gas-phase oxygen, oxygen ionic charge carriers and electrons, it can be shown that the flux of oxygen, <span class="italic">j</span><small><sub>O</sub></small>, is:<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit489"><sup><span class="sup_ref">489</span></sup></a><table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn10"/><a href="/image/article/2018/EE/c7ee02342a/c7ee02342a-t6_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c7ee02342a-t6.tif" src="/image/article/2018/EE/c7ee02342a/c7ee02342a-t6.gif"/></a></td><td class="rightEqn">(10)</td></tr></table>where <span class="italic">σ</span><small><sub>O</sub></small> is the oxygen-ion conductivity, <span class="italic">σ</span><small><sub>e</sub></small> is the electronic conductivity, <span class="italic">R</span> is the general gas constant (8.314 J mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small> K<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), <span class="italic">F</span> is the Faraday's constant (96<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>500 C mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>), <span class="italic">T</span> is temperature, and <span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>O<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> is the partial pressure of O<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Application of the Nernst–Einstein equation relating conductivity to diffusion coefficient allows one to show that, once more, permeability depends upon a diffusion coefficient and a solubility. During permeation experiments, the permeate side of the membrane is often fed with an inert sweep gas, which leaves the logarithm of <span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>O<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> poorly controlled (and dependent upon an oxygen material balance on the permeate side). This is not an ideal way to perform a permeation experiment. Oxygen partial pressures should be controlled on both sides of the membrane (ideally, with the oxygen partial pressure difference being small). The flux is then determined by measuring what would be small changes in oxygen partial pressures over the membrane module. Such a technique has not been adopted by the research community possibly due to the difficulties of gas analysis but it would be a significant improvement in current experimental design.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">MIEC oxide membranes tend to have oxygen fluxes of about 1 ml (STP) cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> min<small><sup>−1</sup></small> or about 10<small><sup>−6</sup></small> mol cm<small><sup>−2</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> at temperatures of around 800 °C.

            <p class="otherpara">Another application of MIEC oxide membranes is in hydrogen permeation. An oxygen vacancy in an oxide membrane has the possibility to react with water, forming a hydroxyl-like species and releasing a proton, which combines with a lattice oxygen species to produce a second hydroxyl species. Protons may then hop from one lattice oxygen site to another lattice oxygen site, leading to hydrogen permeation. The level of proton-conduction <span class="italic">versus</span> oxygen-ion conduction in such a material is a strong function of its degree of hydration. Hydration of the oxide lattice itself is exothermic, and thus, if high proton to oxygen-ion conductivity ratios are to be achieved, lower operating temperatures are necessary. However, lower temperature operation will limit flux. Hydrogen permeation using this class of membranes has not been exploited seriously in CCS applications to date.

            <p class="otherpara">The dual-phase ion-conducting class of membranes uses two phases to conduct charge carriers instead of one, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, one ion conducting phase and an electronic conducting phase.

            <p class="otherpara">One promising approach recently adopted uses a molten salt as one of the phases.

Perhaps most interesting for the field of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture is the use of molten carbonate systems, where the carbonate is housed within a porous solid, providing a route for carbonate ion transport.

            <p class="otherpara">There has been too little research on this class of membrane to clearly identify the major problems and modes of degradation under operating conditions. However, we might anticipate that possible problems with this class of membrane may include carbonate conversion to oxide in low CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> partial pressure atmospheres. Although the oxide will initially remain dissolved in the carbonate, it will eventually solidify at common operating temperatures once the mole fraction reaches saturation. This will impact membrane function and will also eventually lead to gas leakage across the membrane. Furthermore, other gases are known to dissolve in molten carbonates and may also undergo reaction with the carbonate or dissolved oxide in the carbonate. The effects of any such processes will need to be studied and accounted for in the design of the membrane and process. It must be emphasised that this is a relatively new research area, and as a consequence, further work on the mechanism is required to develop good understanding of membrane behaviour.</p>

The sweep gas can be chosen to facilitate separation of the permeating gas from the sweep gas itself; water vapour is a common choice as it is condensable. Another possibility is to perform a reaction on the permeate side to consume the permeating gas, which would provide a chemical driving force for permeation, avoiding the need for a pressure difference across the membrane. Regardless of such considerations, there is a significant opportunity for intensification through removing the WGS equilibrium constraint. Ultimately, it is important to evaluate all process modifications <span class="italic">via</span> a whole-systems analysis with an aim to understand the impact of that modification on the cost per unit of decarbonised product, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, MWh, as discussed in Cabral and Mac Dowell.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit503"><sup><span class="sup_ref">503</span></sup></a></span>

            <span>As an alternative to catalytic steam reforming, the unmixed reforming process involves separate air and fuel/steam feeds to create a cyclic process (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the air and fuel/steam feeds do not mix).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit512"><sup><span class="sup_ref">512</span></sup></a> Membranes can be used to facilitate unmixed reforming. The oxygen permeable membrane would operate at high temperature with feeds of methane and water to opposite sides of the membrane.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn25">†††††</a> Synthesis gas would be produced on the methane side, and hydrogen on the water side; it is this hydrogen stream that can be used for a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> free combustion process. As this membrane process is endothermic, combustion of the synthesis gas may be required to provide energy. The combustion would only produce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and water, provided oxy-combustion conditions are used, which would make CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation relatively straight forward. High conversions can be achieved for steam-methane reforming (SMR) by using high temperatures, thereby avoiding the need for a trans-membrane pressure difference to increase hydrogen mole fraction. This process does have the potential for intensification through significant process simplification, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, combine reforming processes, HTS and LTS into one membrane reactor.</span>
            <p class="otherpara">One approach for unmixed reforming is to direct the reformate or synthesis gas product to a membrane reactor that houses an oxygen permeable membrane with water being fed to the other side of the membrane. Alternatively, the two processes of unmixed reforming and subsequent unmixed shift could occur in series and operated in one membrane unit. The synthesis gas would provide the reducing gas to further drive water splitting on the water side of the membrane (overall this is a combined unmixed WGS and hydrogen purification). The WGS reaction is slightly exothermic, therefore no heat input is required. However, if the syngas produced from the unmixed reforming is not combusted, the overall process becomes endothermic. It is important to consider the energy requirement for such a process and avoid unacceptable CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, due to syngas combustion). Similar to the previous unmixed reforming scenario, no trans-membrane pressure difference would be required to get high mole fractions of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and water (on the reformate side) and hydrogen (on the water side). Also, process intensification is possible by combining the HTS and LTS in one membrane reactor.</p>
            <p class="otherpara">The membrane-based processes for unmixed reforming and unmixed shift both result in hydrogen production using a reducing gas to provide, <span class="italic">via</span> an oxygen permeable membrane, the driving force to split water on the other side of the membrane.

They reported up to 0.5 moles of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> could be captured per ion pair at atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> pressure. The mechanism they reported was similar to aqueous amines, though only one carbamate salt can form per two ion pairs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit586"><sup><span class="sup_ref">586</span></sup></a> This highlights one of the drawbacks listed above for IL-based CCS: amine functionalised cations cannot bind as much CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> per amine on a molar basis, much less compete on a mass or volume basis where the molecular weight of the IL outdistances that of a traditional amine several fold at similar densities. Further, as discussed below, the functionalisation of the cation inherently lowers electron density at the amine site, leading to reduced interactions with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. A similar IL, 1-(3-aminopropyl)-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, demonstrated relatively slow kinetics for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake compared to aqueous amines, due to the high viscosity of amine-functionalised ILs. However, although the viscosity increases dramatically upon complexation with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit601"><sup><span class="sup_ref">601,602</span></sup></a> the absorption of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> was significantly higher than for the analogous physisorbing IL 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate.

            <span id="sect3561"/><br/><span class="d_heading_indent">Amine-functionalised anions. </span>
            <span>Since the anion of the IL is the more electron rich centre, it is a natural source for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> interactions. This has commonly involved the use of (deprotonated) amino acids with tethered amine groups (such as lysine) as the anionic component of the IL. While amino acids are naturally abundant, there are several misconceptions about their nature. For example, they are relatively high in cost (owing to difficult synthesis or isolation), and fairly toxic.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit610"><sup><span class="sup_ref">610</span></sup></a> However, they are unquestionably biodegradable, and their use is not regulated. Their incorporation into ILs is fairly difficult, however, due to the need to use a hydroxide intermediate,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit611"><sup><span class="sup_ref">611</span></sup></a> which is normally obtained through ion exchange chromatography. Also, amino acid ILs are highly viscous, highly basic and (as with amino acids themselves) have low thermal stability. In order to overcome the relatively poor mass transport in these ILs, Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit612"><sup><span class="sup_ref">612</span></sup></a> synthesised silica-supported amino acid ILs with an extra amine group and created 1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>2 complexes with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. The viscosity of these ILs was later reduced by using small teraalkylammonium cations in place of Zhang's tetraalkylphosphonium centres,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit613"><sup><span class="sup_ref">613,614</span></sup></a> with similar CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capacities. While a range of amino acids can be used, the necessity of a free amine group to increase capacity is obvious. This necessitates the use of the deprotonated, highly basic free amine form of the amino acid, with negative consequences for potential thermal or chemical stability of the IL. As the most common mechanism of IL degradation is nucleophilic attack of the cation by the anion (followed by dealkylation of the cation),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit615"><sup><span class="sup_ref">615</span></sup></a> the basic (and nucleophilic) nature of these amino anions is detrimental. More stable cations, such as tetraalkylphosphonium salts, can alleviate this effect to some extent,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit576"><sup><span class="sup_ref">576,616</span></sup></a> creating ILs which compete with aqueous amines on a (molar) capacity basis. Glycine and sarcosine ILs with phosphonium cations<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit617"><sup><span class="sup_ref">617,618</span></sup></a> and tetraalkylammonium methionine<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit619"><sup><span class="sup_ref">619</span></sup></a> have each shown essentially equimolar CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake, though not all amino acid ILs showed this level. Additionally, according to Luo <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit620"><sup><span class="sup_ref">620</span></sup></a> functionalised methylbenzolate-based ILs and nicotinate-based ILs with an amino group at the <span class="italic">para</span> or <span class="italic">ortho</span> position exhibit both higher capacity and lower enthalpy than related structures. It was later pointed out that the absorption was significantly affected by the nature of anions, due to different entropic driving forces for the reaction with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit585"><sup><span class="sup_ref">585</span></sup></a></span>
            <p class="otherpara">While the ILs mentioned thus far relied on long chain (trihexyltetradecyl phosphonium or ammonium) cations, traditional amino acid based ILs pair a much smaller cation.

            <span>Since amine-functionalised ILs chemisorb CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> similarly to liquid amines (by making the carbamate half of a liquid amine complex), the resultant solutions always suffer from extremely high viscosities post-capture, limiting their potential as usable solvent systems.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit579"><sup><span class="sup_ref">579,582,585,612</span></sup></a> There are many alternative structures that can bind CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> without forming carbamates – and after all, the synthetic flexibility of ILs is what attracts researchers to the field.

            <p class="otherpara">Azolate ILs (aprotic heterocyclic anion ILs)<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit624"><sup><span class="sup_ref">624,625</span></sup></a> capture CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in equimolar quantities, and the anions are fairly straightforward to obtain through neutralisation of an azole superbase. Examples such as tetraalkylphosphonium pyrazolate can capture equimolar CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> at atmospheric pressure, while tetrazolate, triazolate, and even pyrrolidonate anions have been shown to be moderately effective, and the use of imidazolate as an anion provided a nice symmetry to the field of ILs by incorporating the most common cation structure as an anion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit580"><sup><span class="sup_ref">580</span></sup></a> These very basic anions even sometimes show a slight decrease in viscosity upon CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> absorption,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit580"><sup><span class="sup_ref">580,626</span></sup></a> though viscosities still typically range close to 1000 cP.

Molecular dynamics simulations have shown that the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake is enhanced through chemical interaction with the anion.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit624"><sup><span class="sup_ref">624</span></sup></a> Both kinetics<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit625"><sup><span class="sup_ref">625</span></sup></a> and thermodynamics<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit584"><sup><span class="sup_ref">584,632</span></sup></a> for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake by tetraalkylphosphonium AHAs have been investigated. It is clear that substituted imidazolate anions can be used to vary reactivity, enthalpy of binding and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capacity. This can clearly be attributed to the relative electron density (and therefore reactivity) of the active site on the anion. By varying the alkyl chain lengths on the cation (from 38 total carbons down to 14), the viscosity could be reduced to under 100 cP without impacting molar uptake.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit634"><sup><span class="sup_ref">634</span></sup></a> This was later attributed to differences in reaction entropy and ionicity,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit635"><sup><span class="sup_ref">635</span></sup></a> though it is additionally important to note that the uptake in moles per unit mass would now be significantly higher, resulting in an intensified process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit570"><sup><span class="sup_ref">570</span></sup></a></p>
            <p class="otherpara">What is clear from the AHAs is that the anion basicity has a controlling influence on the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake. This is similar to the amine-functionalised cation dominance, and is unsurprising – the more electron-rich the reactive site of the ion, the more CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> will be chemisorbed. However, traditional ILs with very basic anions become both highly viscous and unstable, and the AHAs appear to at least be able to avoid the viscosity issues. While tuning anion basicity does enable greater control over CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> uptake, the highly complex nature of these ion structures does not lend much promise to industrial application for cost reasons. Additionally, higher capacity through electron density increase is normally associated with higher enthalpies of binding and therefore more energy on regeneration.

The multiple associative equilibria are treated implicitly within the theory without having to specify the detailed equilibrium reactions, in contrast to a chemical treatment. The equivalence of a SAFT description of the associative equilibria and a chemical or quasi-chemical description has been demonstrated by Economou and Donohue,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit725"><sup><span class="sup_ref">725</span></sup></a> though care has to be taken with the stoichiometry of the reactions in the detailed comparison.

        <span>In the models described in the previous section, a SAFT treatment of the reactions associated with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture in amine solvents does not explicitly take into account the speciation products nor the electrolytic nature of the system. Though it is apparent that a good representation of the thermodynamics and fluid-phase equilibria can be obtained for the chemisorption of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in a variety of amine solvents using SAFT without an explicit treatment of the polar and electrostatic interactions, a physical approach is expected to be increasingly inadequate when the reaction products are highly charged and chemically distinct from the parent reactants.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">As was mentioned in the introductory section, the eNRTL approach is often employed to represent the thermodynamic properties (activity) of the species formed in solutions of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in aqueous amines<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit697"><sup><span class="sup_ref">697,698,703,704</span></sup></a> and a different model (an equation of state) is used to treat the gas phase.

It is clearly advantageous to treat the liquid and gas phases within the same thermodynamic framework and Fürst and co-workers<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit753"><sup><span class="sup_ref">753,754</span></sup></a> followed in this vein, using a different equation of state for electrolytes<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit755"><sup><span class="sup_ref">755</span></sup></a> (which extends the capability of the SRK equation using the mean-spherical approximation, MSA,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit756"><sup><span class="sup_ref">756</span></sup></a> for the contribution to the free energy of the charged species) to represent the fluid-phase equilibria of in aqueous alkanolamine solutions. Unfortunately, the use of the SRK equation of state as the reference for the uncharged aqueous systems comes at the cost of a poor description of the properties of water which are dominated by the strong hydrogen-bonding association interactions. A natural step is the use of extensions of the SAFT approach to electrolytes to describe the chemical and phase equilibria of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in aqueous alkanolamines.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The SAFT framework was first extended to treat electrolyte solutions by incorporation of free energy contributions to take into account the presence of charged species assuming fully dissociated charged species. A Coulombic term, usually written following the expressions of the primitive models of Debye and Hückel<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit757"><sup><span class="sup_ref">757</span></sup></a> (DH) or the mean spherical approximation (MSA),<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit756"><sup><span class="sup_ref">756</span></sup></a> is typically added to the classic SAFT Helmholtz free energy expression.

It is only relatively recently that approaches treating the chemical equilibria between the neutral and charged species have also been presented in SAFT frameworks, mostly with the ePC-SAFT equation,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit767"><sup><span class="sup_ref">767</span></sup></a> see for example <a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit769">ref. 769, 774 and 775</a>.

        <h3 id="sect3968"><span class="b_heading">6.4 The role of thermodynamic models in the design of novel solvents for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture</span></h3>
        <span>Most thermodynamic models of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> absorption in aqueous amine solutions have been developed with the aim to enable the design and operation of chemical absorption and desorption processes, whether in the context of gas sweetening or in that of flue gas treatment. Detailed models based on chemical theory, such as those briefly discussed in Section 6.1 (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit704"><sup><span class="sup_ref">704</span></sup></a>), are very well-suited for this purpose: they take into account every chemical species in the postulated reaction mechanism and therefore allow the calculation of quantities that can have an impact on process performance when operating away from chemical and phase equilibrium. This is the case for instance of the ionic strength, which affects mass transfer, and of the concentrations of all species, which have an effect on reaction kinetics as well as mass transfer. Indeed, such detailed models have been used extensively and quite successfully in modelling pilot plant data without the need for fitting any model parameters to plant data;<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit779"><sup><span class="sup_ref">779,780</span></sup></a> they have an important role to play in developing better processes.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">With the imperative to develop processes that can capture vast quantities of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from post-combustion flue gas at low cost and with minimal environmental impact, however, there has been an increasing focus on effecting step-change improvements in the performance of absorption processes,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit781"><sup><span class="sup_ref">781</span></sup></a> through novel equipment (rotating packed beds)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit782"><sup><span class="sup_ref">782</span></sup></a> but also through novel solvents.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit783"><sup><span class="sup_ref">783</span></sup></a> In the latter case, extensive research has taken place to gain a better understanding of solvent mixtures or additives that have been found to provide some advantage, such as reduced degradation or increased reaction kinetics, as afforded for instance by the combination of methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and PZ.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit784"><sup><span class="sup_ref">784</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The search for novel solvents has mainly been based on extensive experimental programs. For instance, within the CESAR project funded under the FP7 programme of the European Commission,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit785"><sup><span class="sup_ref">785</span></sup></a> experiments from laboratory to pilot plant scale were undertaken for monoethanolamine and several alternative mixtures. This painstaking work allowed the identification of PZ/AMP as a promising candidate. As discussed in Papadopoulos <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit783"><sup><span class="sup_ref">783</span></sup></a> the thorough experimental investigation of a single solvent requires the deployment of significant resources over a number of years, hindering the search for improved amine-based carbon capture processes.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">To support the search for novel solvents, there is thus a pressing need for predictive thermodynamic models of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> absorption that can be applied to solvents that have not been used for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture previously, or even to molecules that have never been synthesised. The prediction of the thermodynamic behaviour of novel solvents is an important enabling capability in overcoming the challenges to the implementation of solvent-based post-combustion capture. Even where new process topologies are sought, the benefits that can potentially be derived from flowsheet innovation are intimately connected to the nature of the solvent. This is the case for instance with phase-change solvents, which have been gaining increasing attention as a means to reduce the energetic cost of solvent regeneration, as discussed in Section 4.1.3. The performance of a process based on such a solvent depends greatly on the thermodynamic phase behaviour of solvent + CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mixtures as a function of composition, temperature and pressure. As seen in Section 6.2, the development of such models is a challenging task, but given that they are to be used to guide the search for novel solvents at an early stage, they need not be subject to the same stringent conditions on accuracy and fidelity as those models that are used for detailed process design.</p>

Chemical absorption processes are, however, significantly more challenging than the physical absorption processes investigated so far with CAMPD due to the presence of chemical reactions that had until recently prevented the development of predictive models linking molecular structure to phase and chemical equilibria. Even with the advent of predictive SAFT-γ SW models, one must note that the use of a physical representation of the chemical reactions (see the scheme in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig13">Fig. 13</a>) implies that the product concentrations are not explicit in the model calculations, that the ionic nature of the products is not explicitly taken into account and that the reactions are necessarily at equilibrium.

The outcome of this step (step 2 in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig16">Fig. 16</a>) is a prioritised list of solvent candidates. Top candidates are then experimentally tested iteratively in step 3 in terms of their key physicochemical properties.

        <span>Thermophysical properties of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and its mixtures with reservoir fluids play an important role in storage-site selection, the design of injection strategies, and in predicting the long-term fate of injected CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Phase behaviour and diffusivity control the extent and rate of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissolution into the connate fluids. Interfacial tension (IFT) and fluid–fluid–mineral contact angles are key parameters influencing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mobility at the pore scale. Finally, properties of the solutions formed when CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissolves in the reservoir fluids play are role in determining field-scale convective flows. A great deal of effort has been expended on understanding the thermophysical properties of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–brine systems. The miscibility behaviour has been extensively studied at reservoir conditions and beyond, and reliable correlations are available.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit863"><sup><span class="sup_ref">863,864</span></sup></a> Diffusion coefficients have also been reported for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in both water and brines<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit865"><sup><span class="sup_ref">865,866</span></sup></a> and the effects of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-dissolution on both the density and viscosity are reasonably-well understood.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit867"><sup><span class="sup_ref">867–870</span></sup></a> The IFT of the baseline CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–water system has been the subject of numerous studies.

Current research is focused mainly on the effects on these properties of the impurities that are inevitably present in the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stream.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Dissolution of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the reservoir brines of course creates an acidic solution that can dissolve minerals (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> carbonates) at significant rates and transport them to regions of higher pH where they may then precipitate again.

        <p class="otherpara">The presence of hydrocarbons, especially oil, complicates the problem substantially, mainly due to their diverse chemical compositions. Given the typically low miscibility of hydrocarbon and aqueous phases under reservoir conditions, the phases formed when CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissolves in the reservoir fluids are primarily CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–brine and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–hydrocarbon mixtures. To predict the thermophysical properties of the latter, bottom-hole oil samples are required; traditional techniques of reservoir fluid analysis and property modelling can then be applied.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit881"><sup><span class="sup_ref">881</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">One of the most challenging properties to predict is the contact angle formed between partially miscible fluid phases and the mineral surfaces. A recent review of contact angle measurements in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–brine–silica systems shows the data scattered over a range of almost 90°.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit882"><sup><span class="sup_ref">882</span></sup></a> This variation is attributed to the variations in surface morphology and impurities.

There are no observations reported in the literature of the impact on relative permeability and capillary pressure functions, or dependencies on reservoir conditions. Injection of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into oil reservoirs dominates the current suite of industrial scale projects, making up over 90% of the approximately 30 Mt per year of anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured and sequestered and 11 of the 14 currently operating projects.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit862"><sup><span class="sup_ref">862</span></sup></a> It has been estimated that there is sufficient capacity for oil reservoirs to take up to 350 Gt of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, sufficient for the majority of the first generation of industrial scale CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit897"><sup><span class="sup_ref">897</span></sup></a> It is thus important that the petrophysics of these systems be more thoroughly investigated.</p>

        <h3 id="sect4253"><span class="b_heading">8.3 Site development and reservoir engineering</span></h3>
        <span>Site characterisation involves the evaluation of a field with the aim of assessing its suitability for the injection of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Most of the techniques were established in the petroleum industry.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit909"><sup><span class="sup_ref">909</span></sup></a> They include sampling and geophysical observational activities that allow for the construction of a geological model of the injection zone and overburden.

        <p class="otherpara">The development practices for gas injection enhanced oil recovery projects are well established, whereas there is little experience with the development of dedicated CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage projects injecting into saline aquifers. Industry field development plans for injection into a saline aquifer at the Gorgon storage injection project in Australia have been reported in Flett <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit910"><sup><span class="sup_ref">910,911</span></sup></a> and for the now cancelled Peterhead project in the UK.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit912"><sup><span class="sup_ref">912</span></sup></a> Detailed development plans, including simulations, have also been proposed in a screening study of prospective early storage development sites in the UK by Pale Blue Dot and Axis Well Technology.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit913"><sup><span class="sup_ref">913</span></sup></a> The presence of wells and previous hydrocarbon production activity is viewed as a significant factor in speeding up the development.

A typical timeline inclusive of the use of appraisal wells, the final investment decision, and preparation for industrial scale injection will be 7–10 years.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Reservoir engineering for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage also largely follows practices established in petroleum engineering. The guiding principles are to meet injection targets while minimising the risk of leakage through overpressure and fracturing of the cap rock, or plume migration to zones with potential leakage pathways. Plume migration has in practice not been a concern due to the size of the geologic units relative to the injection volumes of the first-mover projects. Pressure increases that limited injection have occurred at the Snøhvit site in the Norwegian Barents Sea as well as at the In Salah site in Algeria.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit914"><sup><span class="sup_ref">914</span></sup></a> Both of these involve injection into saline aquifer systems, without the pressure alleviation provided by past or ongoing hydrocarbon production.

        <span>Monitoring of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage relies on a suite of technologies developed for petroleum production applications. Instrumentation in the well bores – down hole data includes pressure, temperature logging, fluid geochemical sampling, the use of tracers, near well geophysical saturation monitoring, and potentially crosswell seismic reservoir characterisation. Over large spatial scales, the use of seismic surveys has been demonstrated to be useful in monitoring the growth and migration of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> plumes. A major development was the successful demonstration of the use of InSAR technology at the In Salah field site to monitor movements in surface elevation over the injection site. This provided detailed constraints on the pressurisation of the subsurface. Jenkins <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit926"><sup><span class="sup_ref">926</span></sup></a> provides a comprehensive review of the state of the art.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The main challenge in the further development of these technologies concern their use in ways that allow for quantitative estimation the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored and the extent of the plume at the outer reaches of migration. This quantification is needed to verify the efficacy of storage. With seismic imaging, for example, there are significant limitations on quantifying fluid plume thickness and fluid saturation in the pore space.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit927"><sup><span class="sup_ref">927,928</span></sup></a> Additionally, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> plumes will frequently have long thin tongues migrating as a gravity current in response to buoyancy, difficult to detect with seismic monitoring. Current research efforts are focused on extending the interpretation of seismic surveys so that thin layer features may be identified and saturation quantified, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ghaderi and Landrø,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit929"><sup><span class="sup_ref">929</span></sup></a> Trani <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit930"><sup><span class="sup_ref">930</span></sup></a> Similarly, saturation quantitation is also being extended to down well geophysical measurements such as crosswell seismic<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit931"><sup><span class="sup_ref">931</span></sup></a> and near well observations, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, pulsed-neutron logging.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit932"><sup><span class="sup_ref">932</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another significant challenge for monitoring and verification lies in the development of techniques for quantifying the extent to which CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> has partitioned into the aqueous phase or has become residually trapped. Geochemical techniques show the most promise, with the use of both artificial and naturally occurring partitioning tracers allowing for estimates of residual trapping and the extent of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dissolution.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit933"><sup><span class="sup_ref">933–936</span></sup></a></p>

        <h3 id="sect4383"><span class="b_heading">8.6 Outlook for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage</span></h3>
        <span>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage research has progressed significantly over the last decade. The technical feasibility of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage has been demonstrated through a number of industrial scale projects, with most being EOR projects. Subsequently, much of the existing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage experience is based in the oil industry and knowledge about CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage in saline aquifers is limited. Similarly, the technology for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage monitoring was originally developed for the petroleum industry. Further development of monitoring instruments is required to enable quantitative predictions of the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored, the extent of plume migration, geophysical saturation, and the extent of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> trapping and dissolution. Although leak detection has not been a focus for the petroleum sector, advances in leak detection technology is required to ensure that the storage of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is permanent. Sensitive CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> leakage indicators include pressure monitoring and measuring CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> flux at the surface over storage sites (either as CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration in the soil/atmosphere or pH at the sea floor). To prevent CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> leakage, safety measures that have been developed are chemical seals and pressure management of the site (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, brine production to prevent over-pressure).</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The thermophysical and flow properties of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> are generally well understood. Furthermore, there are well established procedures for site characterisation and determining the suitability of an injection site (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, cap rock or rock heterogeneity that control/prevent leakage). However, to further de-risk CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage, research is required on studying the effect of: (i) impurities introduced <span class="italic">via</span> the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stream on the thermophysical properties of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–brine system, (ii) hydrocarbons already present in the geological system, and (iii) heterogeneity of reservoir rock on flow properties. Ultimately, the capacity of permanent CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage needs to be quantified on a global scale to ensure that all of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured can be adequately stored. However, this has typically been evaluated using “static” capacity models, which does not account for the dynamics of injection. Recent advances in models now provide time-varying capacity estimates, which consider the influence of system dynamics, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, plume migration, injectivity, pressure build-up. Future work on integrating these dynamic storage capacity models into energy systems models could provide valuable insight into the impact of storage capacity on meeting demand for low carbon energy.</p>

      <span>Carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR, has been practised for many decades as a means to enhance the recovery of oil from depleted reservoirs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit965"><sup><span class="sup_ref">965</span></sup></a> The process (illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig19">Fig. 19</a>) is most effective by operating in ‘miscible’ mode, whereby the injected CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, usually in the liquid or supercritical state, is fully miscible with the oil phase in the reservoir, reduces the viscosity of the oil phase which is then displaced from the rock pores in a single-phase drainage process. This requires the temperature–pressure conditions in the reservoir to be above the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) for the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>–hydrocarbon mixture. This is typically about 75 bar for light crudes at reservoir temperatures of about 70 °C and rises with temperature. Whilst immiscible displacement using CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> can also lead to moderate enhancement of recovery, this miscibility condition does mean that there is a limited window of opportunity to exploit the much more efficient miscible CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR process in depleting reservoirs before the pressure has declined below the MMP. Because of the lower viscosity and density of the injected CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> relative to the <span class="italic">in situ</span> oil, there is usually significant fingering into the oil and breakthrough of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> leading to about 50% recycle. Alternating injection of water and gas (WAG) is a widely practised technique to improve the displacement and recovery of oil.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit966"><sup><span class="sup_ref">966</span></sup></a></span>

      <p class="otherpara">Carbon capture and storage enhanced oil recovery, CCS-EOR, is a similar process but with the dual objective of recovering additional quantities of oil from reservoirs whose oil production has fallen below critical levels whilst at the same time storing some of the injected CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> permanently in the depleted reservoir rather than pumping it back to surface. The driver here is to generate as much income as possible from incremental oil to offset the high costs of the CCS process – of order $70 per tonne of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored. Whereas in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR, the objective is to produce as much incremental oil as possible using as little CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as possible, without any concern for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> retention in the reservoir (or in optimum scenarios to recover as much CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> as possible so that it can be recycled), with CCS-EOR there clearly needs to be a balance between recovered hydrocarbon (to generate income) and the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored, which for the process to be economically viable needs to be significantly greater than the optimal amount required for efficient miscible displacement. This balance turns out to be critical in determining the viability of CCS-EOR processes.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">CCS-EOR is a form of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilisation<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit967"><sup><span class="sup_ref">967</span></sup></a> and is currently the only way to add value to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> at the mega-tonne per annum scale. Typical incremental oil values for optimised CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR processes are 5–15% of the original oil in place (OOIP), and the typical utilisation is about 3 tonnes of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> purchased and injected leads to about 1 bbl of incremental oil.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect4446"><span class="b_heading">9.1 Current CCS-EOR activity</span></h3>
        <span>Globally there are currently more than 140 CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR projects, producing about 300<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 bbl of incremental oil per day, equivalent to about 0.35% of global oil production. Most of this production is in the United States Mid-West. The objective is mainly EOR, not CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage, aiming to minimise net CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> injection and maximise oil recovery. For the process to be a viable route for high volume CCS requires a paradigm shift where the business target is to maximise both oil recovery and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage. Since 2000 about six projects have been commissioned which are truly CCS-EOR, of which the largest are both in Saskatchewan, Canada: at Weyburn-Midale and at Estevan (Boundary Dam).</span>

More than 20 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> have been stored to date and the expectation is that 40 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> will be stored over the project lifetime, 30 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> in the Weyburn field and 10 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> in Midale. The daily injection of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> consists of 6500 t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> of fresh feed accompanied by 6500 t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> of recycle; the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> feed comes from the North Dakota Beulah synfuels gas plant <span class="italic">via</span> a 320 km pipeline.

        <span>In order to add CCS capability to a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR project (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-CCS-EOR), several further issues need to be considered. Additional site characterisation and risk assessment is needed to assure storage integrity, together with additional measurements of gas venting and fugitive emissions associated with inadvertent gas releases from surface equipment. Long term integrity needs to be assured through additional monitoring of the subsurface and enhanced field surveillance using surface monitoring. Changes in abandonment processes to ensure long-term well seal integrity also need to be implemented. All this adds costs to conventional CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">One of the most detailed analyses of the viability of combining CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR with CCS was carried out recently by the IEA.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit968"><sup><span class="sup_ref">968</span></sup></a> In their 2015 report they call this process ‘CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+’ and identify three possible scenarios:</p>
        <p class="otherpara">• CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ Conventional (or ‘Light’), where conventional CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR is supplemented by a full CCS risk assessment, monitoring and verification but little attempt is made to increase the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> injected. Representative values given for this scenario are a net utilisation of 0.3 t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per bbl oil produced with an incremental oil recovery of 6.5% of OOIP.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">• CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ Advanced (or ‘Balanced’), where the aim is to increase both the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored and also the incremental oil recovered – a win-win scenario.

        <p class="otherpara">• CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ Maximum Recovery (or ‘Heavy’) where there is a strong focus on CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage, with representative values of injecting 0.9 t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per bbl oil produced for the same incremental oil recovery of 13% OOIP as in the Balanced scenario.

        <h3 id="sect4588"><span class="b_heading">9.3 Is there enough storage volume for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+?</span></h3>
        <span>The brief answer to this question is ‘Yes, but maybe not in the right places’. Current CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions are about 36 Gt pa, equivalent to about 100 Mbbl CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> per day, compared with oil production levels of about 90 Mbbl per day. We need to capture 15–20% of total CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions to meet global carbon mitigation targets (the remainder being accounted for by energy efficiency/savings measures [up to 50%] or through increased deployment of renewables and nuclear [about 30%]). CCS targets to meet the COP21 target of limiting mean global temperature rise to 1.5–2 °C through capping atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> levels at about 450 ppm require capacity to store 120–160 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> at a rate of about 10 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> pa by 2050, equivalent to ∼3000 major facilities. The storage requirement by 2100 may be as high as 1200–3300 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The global storage potential for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ Light has been estimated at 70–140 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>, in principle, resulting in about 470bn bbl of incremental oil (see <a title="Select to navigate to table" href="#tab8">Table 8</a>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit973"><sup><span class="sup_ref">973</span></sup></a> However, this may be a highly optimistic estimate of the total deployable CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR capacity.

        <p class="otherpara">In other words, as illustrated in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig20">Fig. 20</a>, there appears to be an unfortunate disconnect between regions of substantial CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR potential and those regions with the largest anticipated population growth, dependence on fossil fuels and requirement to sequester CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> over the course of the next century. In fact, the only region where it appears certain that there is sufficient CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR capacity to meet the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage requirements to 2050 is the Middle East and Africa – although the requirements are close in North America and the Former Soviet Union. Given the size and rate of growth of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR industry in the USA, it is likely that this region will be a leader. If we recognise that in some cases CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> injection will be restricted by availability rather than by CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR capacity, a more realistic estimate is likely to be on the order of 40 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> injected and stored <span class="italic">via</span> CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR. This is in line with the recent IEA estimate. If we adjust this for the net emissions from the additional incremental oil (see later), the total capacity for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ Light is about 35 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>, which is ∼30% of the 2050 target and 4–5% of the total CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mitigation target.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The IEA analysis used the industry U-Cube capacity database<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit977"><sup><span class="sup_ref">977</span></sup></a> on a field-by-field basis. It estimates that the global capacity for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ ‘Balanced’ is ∼240 Gt and for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR ‘Heavy’ is about 360 Gt, two and three times respectively the IEA's estimate of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage. Outside North America, the main capacity is focused on the Middle East (&gt;100 Gt), Russia (&gt;70 Gt), North Africa (∼35 Gt) and Central Asia (∼20 Gt). The potential for incremental oil for conventional CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR up to 2050 is 190bn bbl, whilst the ‘Balanced’ and ‘Heavy’ scenarios could deliver an additional 375bn bbls during that period, over ten times the current annual oil consumption. Therefore the technical global capacity of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ to both store CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and to deliver significant incremental oil to deliver revenue through CCS is therefore considerable, capable of meeting current targets to meet the 2 °C scenario. The main issue is whether the economic drivers will be in place to make the process financially viable.</p>

The major future drivers for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ will be:</span>

        <p class="otherpara">The conventional CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ ‘Light’ process remains the best option for low oil and high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> prices (costs), down to the point where carbon pricing forces CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> prices to be negative. The ‘Balanced’ scenario is the favoured option once CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> prices become negative (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> producer pays) or oil rises above about $90 per bbl, which is where oil prices were 2008 to 2014, driven by income from both incremental oil and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> disposal payments. Once the latter rise further, with further rises in the carbon price, then the ‘Heavy’ CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ option becomes increasingly viable with increased CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> disposal revenues.

        <h3 id="sect4784"><span class="b_heading">9.5 Does CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-CCS-EOR really reduce emissions?</span></h3>
        <span>A final critical issue for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-CCS-EOR, in the light of the production of incremental oil (and sometimes gas), which will be subsequently burned for fuel or power, is whether CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions are actually reduced by storing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the sub-surface alongside increasing oil production to partially offset the costs of CCS. Here it is crucial to carry out a life cycle analysis from the production of the original hydrocarbon, through its use, then its capture, transport and storage <span class="italic">via</span> CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR, including CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> recycle and separation of produced natural gas liquids, to the eventual use of the incremental oil.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Considering just the storage process itself, project level emissions are significantly carbon negative when disposing of anthropogenic CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, ranging from −0.76 tonnes CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-equivalent per tonne of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> delivered for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ ‘Light’ to −0.86 tonne CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-equivalent for the ‘Heavy’ process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit968"><sup><span class="sup_ref">968</span></sup></a> When emissions from the use of the incremental oil are included, the ‘Balanced’ CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ process is essentially carbon neutral whereas the ‘Heavy’ scenario results in a net storage of ∼33% of the injected CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. However, the additional oil produced by CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR can displace oil which would otherwise have been produced elsewhere with additional cost and additional CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> footprint. Once these displaced emissions are taken into account, then the net CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions vary from about 0.7 to 0.8 tonne CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-equivalent per tonne CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit968"><sup><span class="sup_ref">968</span></sup></a> This clearly depends on the type of oil recovered by EOR and displaced.

        <span>Overall, the emissions reductions resulting from the use of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR+ will vary with the precise conditions, but they will always be negative and typically above 0.7 tonne CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-equivalent per tonne CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored. Yet the processes of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR and CCS are currently far from optimal so better understanding and optimisation of miscible CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> displacement processes in porous reservoirs for both enhanced recovery and storage<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit979"><sup><span class="sup_ref">979</span></sup></a> should result in improved efficiencies and lower costs. There is an element of risk reduction and public reassurance that such processes are safe and secure, particularly on land. To enhance public reassurance and reduce risk, R&amp;D and field trials focus on key assurance issues such as decommissioning, fugitive emissions monitoring and sub-surface monitoring of fluids migration and real-time process control.

Alternatively, converting fossil-based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> by mineralisation would also be conceptually carbon-neutral.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Beyond the simple carbon-accounting perspective, CCU could contribute to climate change mitigation <span class="italic">via</span> further mechanisms:</p>
        <p class="otherpara">• Carbon-reducing products: even when a CCU pathway is not overall carbon-negative, it can be carbon-reducing by replacing an existing product with less greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intense alternative. A recent example is the production of polyethercarbonate polyols from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> (which can be processed further to polyurethane (PU) foams).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit996"><sup><span class="sup_ref">996</span></sup></a> The novel polyols contain about 20 mass% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and could reduce GHG emissions by 11–19% compared to conventional polyether polyols.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit997"><sup><span class="sup_ref">997</span></sup></a> Often, the carbon reduction depends on the availability of hydrogen with low or even very low global warming impacts.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit998"><sup><span class="sup_ref">998,999</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">• Temporary carbon storage: chemicals or fuels produced from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> offer temporary storage of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.

        <p class="otherpara">The life-cycle of CCU (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig22">Fig. 22</a>) is also helpful to clarify the relation between carbon dioxide re-use and carbon capture and storage. Often, CCU has been contrasted to CCS and proposed as an alternative. This viewpoint may be tempting due the joint capture step and the similar acronyms CCS and CCU used for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> re-use in the literature. However, it is also misleading. Even though both CCU and CCS aim at mitigating climate change, the approaches are rather complementary than in conflict. While CCS addresses the end-of-life problem, CCU addresses a beginning-of-pipe problem, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, a raw materials problem, by providing a sustainable carbon source. Thus, the CCU life-cycle integrates naturally into the CCS life-cycle. A storage step could be added to all CCU routes where CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is released at the end-of-life. The debate about CCU should therefore be separated from CCS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1005"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1005</span></sup></a></p>

However, it has to be emphasised that one major environmental driver for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilisation is the provision of a non-fossil carbon feedstock for the chemical industry which helps to reduce depletion of resources.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit984"><sup><span class="sup_ref">984</span></sup></a> Avoiding fossil-based feedstock then often induces savings of GHG emissions as a secondary effect.

        <span>Carbon dioxide re-use will have a role in climate-change mitigation – but the size of this role is still unclear. A number of key issues need to be addressed to make best use of the potential benefits from implementing CCU. These issues are discussed in the following.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The scale of CCU will mainly depend on the large-scale implementation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based fuels since the potential for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> re-use in fuels is about 12–14 times higher than for chemicals.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit988"><sup><span class="sup_ref">988</span></sup></a> CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-Based fuels have been shown to be able to reduce GHG emissions over the life cycle.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit998"><sup><span class="sup_ref">998,999,1015</span></sup></a> Several pilot-plants are already in operation for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based methane and methanol.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit992"><sup><span class="sup_ref">992</span></sup></a> The George Olah Renewable Methanol Plant in Iceland is producing 4000 tonne per year.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1017"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1017</span></sup></a> However, the large-scale implementation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based fuels still requires to overcome several challenges.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The production of potential fuels such as methane, methanol by Fischer–Tropsch synthesis still requires major progress in catalysis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit991"><sup><span class="sup_ref">991</span></sup></a> and the design of efficient processes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1018"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1018</span></sup></a> CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-Based methanation is expected to increase the cost of natural gas by a factor of 2.4 based on the most optimistic estimate for the year 2050 while current worst estimates predict a cost increase as large as a factor of 30.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1019"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1019</span></sup></a> For methanol, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based production are estimated to increase the selling price by a factor of 1.8.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1020"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1020</span></sup></a> Thus, cost efficiency has to be addressed in all aspects; most importantly for the hydrogen source but also for the feedstock CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and for investment cost. It has been argued that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based fuels could provide an important link to the energy sector by providing chemical energy storage as well as flexibility to the electrical grid.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1021"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1021</span></sup></a> Thus, dynamic operation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based fuel production may provide opportunities but will require the development of novel technologies.

For methanation, the strong exothermic reaction provides opportunities for heat integration.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1019"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1019</span></sup></a> For methanol production, highly selective and long-term stable catalysts are required as well as more efficient separation technologies for the methanol–water mixture.

        <p class="otherpara">The production of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based fuels usually requires the reduction of the oxidation state of carbon to 2+ or lower. For this purpose, high energy exchanges are needed by strong reducing agents such as hydrogen.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1026"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1026</span></sup></a> Even assuming a conversion process that achieves ideal performance at the thermodynamic minimum, the availability of hydrogen at low-carbon impacts and low cost often remains the crucial element for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based fuels. Thus, efficient production of hydrogen with low environmental impacts will be the key enabler for large-scale CCU. Machhammer <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1028"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1028</span></sup></a> compared the cost and carbon footprint related to the operation of hydrogen production technologies. The identified Pareto-efficient technologies for hydrogen production are: water electrolysis using wind power (zero carbon footprint for operation; high cost), methane pyrolysis (medium carbon footprint; medium cost) and conventional methane steam reforming (high carbon footprint; low cost). Taking a full life-cycle assessment into account suggests that methane pyrolysis could even become more CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> efficient than water electrolysis driven by wind power if the produced carbon is stored.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1029"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1029</span></sup></a> In this case, however, the demand for fossil resources is more than doubled. Hydrogen production by water electrolysis has only low emissions if renewable surplus electricity is available. Renewable energy, however, will still be limited in most places for the foreseeable future. Thus, overall process efficiency remains a key performance indicator since power-to-fuel technologies would be competing with other pathways to utilise renewable energy.

        <p class="otherpara">CCU has the potential to play a role as renewable carbon feedstock for the chemical industry.

        <span>Computer models used for energy-related planning and policy analysis typically employ one of two methods to represent technological change: either the future cost and performance of technologies are exogenously specified by the modeller, or a mathematical model is used to relate the future cost and performance of energy-related technologies to other model parameters. The latter method includes the use of “learning curves” (or experience curves) to project the future cost of technologies.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In 1936, Wright<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1056"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1056</span></sup></a> observed that the average time required to manufacture a given model of a Boeing aircraft decreased systematically with each unit produced. Wright<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1056"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1056</span></sup></a> captured this phenomenon with an equation representing what he called a “progress curve” given by:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn15"/><span id="eqn15"><span class="italic">Y</span> = <span class="italic">ax</span><small><sup><span class="italic">b</span></sup></small></span></td><td class="rightEqn">(15)</td></tr></table>where, <span class="italic">Y</span> is the estimated average direct man-hours per unit for <span class="italic">x</span> units; <span class="italic">a</span> is the direct man-hours needed to manufacture the first unit; and <span class="italic">b</span> is a parametric constant. Using this equation, Wright demonstrated that the labour input, <span class="italic">Y</span>, dropped by 20 percent for every doubling of cumulative output, an 80 percent “progress ratio” where the exponent <span class="italic">b</span> was −0.32.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Wright's work remained relatively obscure until a decade later, when it was picked up by a group of economists at the then recently founded RAND Corporation, who applied his findings to the production of war materials and described the phenomenon as “learning-by-doing”. Subsequent work by the Boston Consulting Group (1968)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1057"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1057</span></sup></a> applied Wright's equation to the relationship between the average unit price and cumulative production of two dozen selected industrial products. When applied in this fashion to a class of product (rather than to a specific manufacturing process), the “learning curve” equation became referred to as an “experience curve”.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">More recently, this formulation (<a title="" href="#eqn15">eqn (15)</a>) has been adopted in empirical studies to characterise learning phenomena in a broad range of sectors, including manufacturing, ship production, consumer products, energy supply technologies, fuel technology, energy demand technologies, and environmental control technologies.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1058"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1058</span></sup></a> In these applications, the dependent variable <span class="italic">Y</span> is typically the unit price or cost of a technology and <span class="italic">x</span> is its cumulative production or installed capacity. <a title="" href="#eqn15">Eqn (15)</a> also can be re-written as:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn16"/><span id="eqn16">log<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/><span class="italic">Y</span> = <span class="italic">c</span> + <span class="italic">b</span><img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>log<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/><span class="italic">x</span></span></td><td class="rightEqn">(16)</td></tr></table>where, <span class="italic">c</span> is a constant and <span class="italic">b</span> is the slope of a line on a logarithmic scale.

        <p class="otherpara">Today, this log-linear form of the learning curve remains the most popular equation used to represent the expected cost improvements of a technology.

        <p class="otherpara">“Component-based learning curves” extend the one-factor learning model to represent the total cost of a technology as the sum of individual component or sub-system costs. This formulation seeks to account for the fact that different components of a complex technology (like a power plant) may have different levels of maturity and different rates of learning.

        <p class="otherpara">Research over the past few decades also has sought deeper insights into the underlying factors that contribute to cost reductions and technological change. One result is a variety of multi-factor learning models that have been developed to explicitly account for such factors such as R&amp;D spending, knowledge spill-overs, increased capital investments, economies-of-scale, changes in input prices, labour costs, and other factors.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1058"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1058</span></sup></a> While such models provide more detailed descriptions of factors that affect a particular technology cost, they are not as prevalent as the one-factor model shown earlier, in large part because of data requirements and limitations.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">For energy technologies, the most prevalent multi-factor model is a “two-factor learning curve” where the key drivers of cost reduction are assumed to be the cumulative expenditure for R&amp;D on the technology, in addition to its cumulative installed capacity or production.

        <span>Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mitigation technology which combines bioenergy applications with carbon capture and storage. This concept is not consistently defined and can include a variety of industrial and energy technologies with different amounts of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions, such as biomass combustion (dedicated or co-firing) for power production, biomass conversion to liquid and gaseous fuels, bio-refineries, pulp and paper production. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig23">Fig. 23</a> is a graphical representation of the BECCS concept (throughout the literature, the term Bio-CCS is also used as an alternative). In BECCS, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> originating from biomass, which has undergone a conversion process, is capture and stored in geological formations. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> utilisation concepts exist for BECCS as well (BECCUS or Bio-CCUS), where the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is temporarily fixed in products, such as fuels, construction materials, chemicals, plastics <span class="italic">etc.</span> The concept of BECCS depends on the assumption that biomass binds CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the atmosphere as it grows and, if captured and stored after conversion, results in a net removal of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the atmosphere. Technologies allowing for this net removal are referred to as negative emissions technologies (NETs), and include ocean fertilisation, mineral carbonation, afforestation and direct air capture (DAC) – discussed in Section 12.2.</span>

In comparison, CCS on fossil fuels (Fossil-CCS, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, Coal-CCS and Gas-CCS) is quite different, as it can at best lead to zero emissions. Fossil-CCS takes carbon from the geosphere and returns it there, while BECCS takes carbon from the atmosphere, puts it temporarily into the biosphere, and then permanently into the geosphere (assumed there is no major leakage from the storage reservoir). Without a CCS component, processes take carbon from either geosphere or biosphere and transfer it to the atmosphere, so can be at best carbon neutral (biomass resource) or will be net positive (fossil resources).

Another issue with regards to using some of the above-mentioned feedstocks for large-scale BECCS is their seasonal availability due to harvesting schedules, which makes pre-treatment and storage necessary. Future availability will further depend on improvement in yields, cultivation methods, and growth in demand.

As discussed above, marginal lands can be used to partially meet land requirements. Another option that can free significant amounts of land is through dietary changes. The current average diet in the US contains a high amount of animal products (meat, dairy, eggs, fish) and has a land intensity of about 1.08 ha per year per person (of which, 0.74 ha per year is for pasture and 0.34 ha per year for cropland). In contrast, a vegetarian diet requires 0.14 ha per year per person (0.02 ha per year for pasture and 0.12 ha per year for cropland) and a fully plant-based diet needs 0.13 ha per year per person.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1128</span></sup></a> Assuming the current world population of 7.5 billion, a full transition to a vegetarian or plant-based diet could free around 605–685 Mha of cropland and 3165–3315 Mha of pasture. However, the likelihood of human society undergoing such a drastic change in behaviour appears unlikely. In addition, it is important to keep in mind that free allocations between cropland and pastures are usually not possible, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, only a certain proportion of pastures will be suitable as cropland. Other, less drastic scenarios estimate that a 40% cut in consumption of animal products by the 2.2 billion people currently on a US-type diet could free 140 Mha of cropland and 500 Mha of pasture.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1129</span></sup></a> Further options to free land are crop yield/livestock productivity improvements or reduction of food waste, as the land area associated with food waste totals ∼1400 Mha, for crop and animal commodities combined.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1090"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1090,1111,1112,1130</span></sup></a> In conclusion, we could make enough land available for large-scale BECCS deployment, or bioenergy deployment in general, but only with far-reaching changes to our diets and agricultural systems.</p>

        <h3 id="sect5541"><span class="b_heading">12.2 Direct air capture of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></span></h3>
        <span>Direct air capture (DAC) has gained a lot of interest mostly in popular media,<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1131–1134</span></sup></a> because it appears to be an easy fix to our current climate crisis. The concept of placing DAC plants anywhere to remove CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the air provides the mental picture of our atmosphere one day having a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration as low as it was prior to the industrial revolution. However, this approach has many technical and economic caveats, primarily associated with the highly dilute nature of atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, 400 ppm, a factor of 100–300 times more dilute than the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration in gas- and coal-fired power plants. In this section, we will summarise the technology, economics, and system considerations with an aim to objectively assess the state of DAC today.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In order for DAC to result in a negative CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions scenario, it would have to be coupled to CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transport and sequestration infrastructure in order to ensure a positive climate impact. Several companies have emerged with small-scale applications,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1135"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1135</span></sup></a> but their impact on significant and permanent atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> reductions is minimal owing to their present scale.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">There are a range of views regarding DAC as a realistic option for climate change mitigation. In particular, two reports have been published by the American Physical Society<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1097"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1097</span></sup></a> and the National Academy of Sciences<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1136"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1136</span></sup></a> that discuss the challenges associated with implementing DAC at a scale capable of impacting climate. To the authors’ knowledge, there have only been two studies that have proposed specific designs for DAC systems with estimated costs. In the work of Holmes and Keith,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1137"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1137</span></sup></a> an air–liquid contactor design based upon cooling tower technology was proposed, while in the work of Mazzotti <span class="italic">et al.</span>,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1138"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1138</span></sup></a> a more conventional contactor was proposed, which may be more suited for flue gas applications. Both designs are unique and the costs for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture range between $300 and $600 per tonne of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. House <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit67"><sup><span class="sup_ref">67</span></sup></a> demonstrated the relationship between CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration and the energy efficiency of a given separation process and determined that the more dilute a system is, the more unwanted material there is to be processed, leading directly to higher costs with an estimate on the order of $1000 per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>. Although there is general consensus in the community that DAC is significantly more expensive than conventional carbon capture from coal or natural gas-fired power plants, it is described by some as “insurance” against potential CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> leakage from geologic storage sites or as a means to offset emissions from dispersed sources such as automobiles, ships, and airplanes.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1139"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1139</span></sup></a></p>

The interfacial concentration, <span class="italic">c</span><small><sub>i</sub></small>, is shown for a number of solvents, including ionic liquids (IL), piperazine-activated amines (amines-PZ), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), and potassium carbonate (K<small><sub>2</sub></small>CO<small><sub>3</sub></small>) as a function of gas-phase CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> partial pressure and solvent Henry's law values. The Henry's law constant is a solvent property that indicates the extent to which CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is soluble in a given solvent. Assuming the concentration of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the gas phase is defined as <span class="italic">c</span><small><sub>g</sub></small>, the Henry's law constant may be defined in a dimensionless form, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, <span class="italic">c</span><small><sub>i</sub></small>/<span class="italic">c</span><small><sub>g</sub></small>, or in a more conventional form, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, <span class="italic">c</span><small><sub>i</sub></small>/<span class="italic">P</span><small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>, with units of atm-cm<small><sup>3</sup></small> mol<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

          <p class="otherpara">Hence, to force the same amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> across the interface for DAC as one would have for the more concentrated cases, <span class="italic">E</span> may be up to two orders of magnitude higher to compensate since <span class="italic">k</span><small><sub>l</sub></small> is a parameter solely influenced by the solvent and its relationship to the packing material. Increased enhancement can be achieved by choosing strong bases with fast kinetics, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1141"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1141</span></sup></a> or combinations of piperazine (PZ) with potassium carbonate (K<small><sub>2</sub></small>CO<small><sub>3</sub></small>).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1142"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1142</span></sup></a> However, the trade-off with having to choose a strong base is the increase in energy required for regeneration.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Due to the increased binding between CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and a strong base, a chemical shift process is required for regeneration rather than a simple thermal- or pressure-swing process. For instance, in the case of NaOH, sodium carbonate (NaCO<small><sub>3</sub></small>) is formed and in order to regenerate NaOH and to produce a near-pure stream of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, one can either react NaCO<small><sub>3</sub></small> with lime (Ca(OH<small><sub>2</sub></small>))<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1143"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1143</span></sup></a> or with TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, with the second process (titanate cycle) potentially being less energy-intensive.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1144"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1144</span></sup></a> In both reactions, NaOH is regenerated, but a final thermal decomposition step (calcination in the case of calcium carbonate) is also required for producing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">As expected, similar to absorption separation processes, the low driving force inherent in DAC systems also affects CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation using solid sorbents. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig26">Fig. 26</a> shows the relationship between pore size and CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration in the pore. Due to the low concentration of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in air, no matter how small the pore is, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> will never saturate the pore. On the other hand, in the case of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation from the exhaust of a coal-fired power plant, which is 300 times more concentrated than air in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, saturation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> takes place in the micropores and smaller mesopores. This state of saturation is an added driving force that can only take place for applications in which CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is sufficiently concentrated in the gas phase.</p>

          <p class="otherpara">An alternative way to show that energy increases with decreasing concentration is through examining the minimum work of a given separation process. The relationship between initial CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> dilution and the energy required for purification can be shown by estimating the minimum work as a function of initial concentration, capture rate, and final purity. As shown in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig27">Fig. 27</a>, the minimum work associated with separating CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from air is approximately 2, 3, and 5 times more energy-intensive than separating CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the exhausts of natural gas combustion, coal combustion, and coal gasification, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit308"><sup><span class="sup_ref">308</span></sup></a> It is also important to note that a reduction in the capture rate combined with a reduction in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> purity will decrease the minimum work, but not significantly.

          <p class="otherpara">Another technical challenge associated with DAC is the amount of air that needs to be processed to capture a comparable amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> compared to a power plant. Assuming a capture rate of 50%, one is reducing a volume of gas from 400 ppm down to 200 ppm. In this case a tall contactor is not required, which is different than conventional carbon capture, where a common target is a capture rate of 90% from an exhaust stream with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration ranging from approximately 6% to 12%. The degree of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation increases with column height, as does the pressure drop. The unique “short” design of a DAC plant is a consequence of the low degree of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation combined with minimising the energy required to overcome the pressure drop. However, there is also a lower limit to the pressure drop that should be avoided. Pressure drop allows for one to control how the flow of the solvent distributes across the system. Inadequate coating of the solvent across the packing material can impact the extent of mass transfer across the gas–liquid interface.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The contactor cross-sectional area can be estimated based upon the amount of air to be processed. For a given DAC plant to capture 1 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year at a 50% capture rate requires processing approximately 80<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 m<small><sup>3</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of air. Using a typical air velocity ranging between 2–3 m s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> leads to surface areas on the order of 30<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 m<small><sup>2</sup></small>. This is about 600 times the cross-sectional area of a large packed tower used for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture from a power plant flue gas. This large surface area requirement for DAC systems may well dominate the capital cost of the plant design. Overcoming the pressure drop across each of these units will require fan power. In conventional carbon capture systems for coal or natural gas exhaust streams, fan or blower power may only comprise up to 3% of the total energy of the separation process,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1145"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1145</span></sup></a> but may in fact dominate in the case of a DAC plant. An added expense is the need for an air filtration system. Due to the complexity of placing filtration units on each of the contactors, likely a central air handling unit would have to be in place prior to air distribution across the contactors.</p>

          <span>There is a wide range of cost estimates for DAC in the literature.

A review of the literature by Goeppert <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit993"><sup><span class="sup_ref">993</span></sup></a> reported a range of $20 to $1000 per ton of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.

          <p class="otherpara">There is strong evidence that the cost of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture rises with increasing initial dilution.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit121"><sup><span class="sup_ref">121</span></sup></a> The CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> used for commercial markets is from high purity sources such as ammonia plants, ethanol plants and hydrogen production. The reason for this is that starting with high purity sources results in the lowest production costs. This relationship was quantified in an empirical correlation called the Sherwood Plot (see <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig28">Fig. 28</a>). Reasons for increased cost at lower dilution include smaller driving forces for mass transfer and greater amounts of material to process (see pressure drop discussion below).</p>

Based on air being an ideal gas and assuming no losses in the process, if we had a pressure drop of 0.016 bar (0.23 psi), we would need 1 MWh to move the air. In other words, at this pressure drop, just moving the air would require all the energy released in generating the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> in the first place. This means for a DAC process to be at all practical, pressure drops need to be limited to the order of 6.89 × 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small> bar (0.01 psi) and/or that the energy source for DAC needs to be carbon-free. A pressure drop of 6.89 × 10<small><sup>−4</sup></small> bar (0.01 psi) is extremely small and it is unclear whether it can be realised in a full-scale DAC system. A better use for carbon-free power today would be to replace fossil-fuel fired power and avoid putting the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> into the air in the first place.</p>

          <span>DAC is essentially an extension of CCS. Once the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is captured, and is available at sufficient purity, the options for storage or utilisation are the same in both cases. As shown above, a given technology that is suitable for flue gas CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> removal from a coal-fired power plant may not be the equivalent best technology for DAC.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1140"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1140</span></sup></a> Similarly, opportunities that can make DAC more competitive, may not necessary be suitable for CCS. For DAC processes, the resulting gas stream may have a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> concentration as low as 50 vol%.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1147</span></sup></a> Although too dilute for geological storage, there are several opportunities for dilute CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> gas streams (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, &lt;50 vol%) to be utilised. For example, opportunities may include, however not limited to, EOR, mineral carbonation, microalgae cultivation and fuel synthesis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1147"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1147</span></sup></a></span>
          <p class="otherpara">The proponents of DAC make the case that there is a significant advantage to be able to theoretically site a DAC facility anywhere. Specifically, they suggest that it can be located near a storage site (reducing the pipeline cost), or away from populated areas. Siting is a multi-faceted, complex decision. While you may save some money building near a storage site, if there is no industrial infrastructure around, other costs will go up significantly. It is not at all clear that the fact that the feedstock for DAC (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, air) is found everywhere translates into any real economic advantage.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Proponents also suggest placement of a DAC plant nearby an EOR site may seem desirable. However, there are usually an abundance of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sources that are more concentrated nearby EOR operations that can produce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for much less cost than DAC.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Finally, for DAC to be at all practicable, the systems will need to operate at high capacity factors. Almost no work has been done on long-term operation of these systems. There are trace impurities in the air and since such a large amount of air is processed, they can have an adverse impact on DAC systems. Also, these systems must be able to stand up to the elements. Depending on where they are located, this includes water, wind, cold, and sandstorms. So far, the DAC literature is silent on these issues.</p>

          <span>The time scale of DAC implementation is quite slow. If one accepts the high cost associated with concentrating CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from 400 ppm to 90+% purity, the number of DAC plants to be built per year is limited not just from a cost perspective, but also in terms of optimal siting. In addition, once CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is captured, the dilemma of how to permanently dispose of it, is still an issue. Further, due to the slow scale of implementation associated with this approach, the impact that it could have on slowing global warming is limited. First and foremost, conventional carbon capture and storage, the replacement of fossil-based energy with renewables and nuclear power, increasing efficiencies across all sectors, reforestation efforts, and the prevention of deforestation all must be practiced collectively in order to impact climate on a scale that will matter.</span>

      <span>This section is intended to provide insights into the challenges facing the development of a viable CCS industry highlighting new approaches and commercial models that could be deployed to realise the full potential of CCS in decarbonising future energy systems at lowest cost. Although based upon experiences from the recent UK CCS Commercialisation Programme and written mostly from a UK perspective with UK solutions in mind, the lessons learnt and proposed approaches can be applied globally.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect5769"><span class="b_heading">13.1 Current status</span></h3>
        <span>Since the late 1990s, a number of flagship government backed programmes have been set up around the world with the specific intent of demonstrating the commercial viability of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an effective and affordable way to decarbonise power generation and other energy intensive industries (EII). Many of these programmes have featured financial support to off-set the costs of CCS as a means to encourage the private sector to invest in the development and deployment of CCS technology. Despite the ambition of these programmes and the scale of the support offered, progress has been minimal. To date, there are two “commercial scale” CCS projects in the power generation sector that are operational, the first is the Boundary Dam project in Canada at 110 MW<small><sub>e</sub></small> net output,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit188"><sup><span class="sup_ref">188</span></sup></a> second is the Petra Nova W.A.

More success has been enjoyed in the United States through various programmes supported by the US Department of Energy. The Petra Nova W.A. Parish project commenced operation as planned in January 2017.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> However, Southern Company's Kemper County IGCC project (lignite power generation at 582 MW<small><sub>e</sub></small> net output) has encountered a number of problems with delivery delays, major technical issues and being significantly over-budget.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21,22</span></sup></a> Consequently, the clean coal component of the project has been suspended.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> In the United Kingdom two competitive CCS procurement programmes for power generation have been run by the UK Government since 2007 with both having being abandoned without success.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The need for CCS as a key part of global strategies to reduce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions may be great<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit3"><sup><span class="sup_ref">3</span></sup></a> but so far this need has not been framed in a way that is attractive or rational for the private sector to respond to with investments in CCS projects. The physical and commercial risks associated with the development of large scale CCS projects and the associated CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transport and storage (T&amp;S) infrastructure have so far outweighed the potential rewards on offer, as evidenced by the abandonment of many tens of promising CCS projects around the world.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">With the failure of the various government-backed programmes to establish a viable CCS industry and in the absence of any private sector companies willing to expose their balance sheets to full chain CCS projects,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1149</span></sup></a> the question arises: what needs to happen to make CCS a commercial reality? The need for CCS is becoming ever more acute and new approaches to its commercial deployment are needed as a matter of urgency if we wish to meet our carbon targets in the most cost-effective manner.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">One of the key attributes of CCS is that it can be applied to all main carbon emitting sectors and is therefore ideally suited to system-wide decarbonisation efforts. A key focus in the early stages of deployment will need to be on the development of CCS infrastructure to which multiple CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sources can connect so as to take advantage of economies of scale and to optimise the development pathway. In the UK regulatory and financial frameworks are already in place for low-carbon power which can be modified to fit CCS. This, together with the large volumes of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> available to support large scale CCS infrastructure development, makes the power generation sector, in an increasingly electrical future, the logical first mover sector for CCS.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect5791"><span class="b_heading">13.2 The value of CCS</span></h3>
        <span>The value of CCS derives from the fact that it is the only technology that can simultaneously address carbon reduction objectives across all main carbon emitting sectors of the economy, without compromising their cost-effective provision of service. These sectors include power generation, industry, transport and heating.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn27">§§§§§</a></span>
        <p class="otherpara">For many industrial applications there is currently no alternative to CCS for reducing the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions that are inherent to the manufacturing process. The decarbonisation of transport, including road transport, will inevitably involve increases in the numbers of electric vehicles. The resulting demand for electricity can be in part supplied from CCS enabled power stations. CCS in combination with hydrogen production could provide the low-cost route to the decarbonisation of heating as well as support the development of other aspects of the hydrogen economy including the use of fuel cells. CCS is also the only technology that can remove industrial quantities of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the atmosphere when combined with power generation from sustainable biomass combustion (so-called BECCS) creating room within carbon budgets for sectors more difficult to decarbonise, such as aviation. Indeed, in the UK, without CCS it is unlikely that the country's 4th and 5th carbon budgets can be met.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit85"><sup><span class="sup_ref">85</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">The development of CCS, like all low-carbon technologies, will bring with it some additional costs. In a report prepared by the CCSA together with the TUC<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1150"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1150</span></sup></a> however, it was estimated that the Gross Value Added<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn28">¶¶¶¶¶</a> (GVA) benefits from CCS deployment in the UK would be in the region of £2bn–£4bn per year by 2030, with a cumulative market value of £15bn–£35bn (depending on whether 10 GW or 20 GW of CCS capacity is installed respectively). This is in addition to the creation of between 15<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 and 30<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 jobs.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">If CCS is to form a key part of decarbonisation strategies it is important that the benefits of CCS across the economy at the total energy-system level are understood and that the long-term value-for-money case forms a central consideration in developing energy policy.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect5806"><span class="b_heading">13.3 The cost of CCS</span></h3>
        <span>One of the most frequently expressed concerns regarding CCS is that it is too expensive. Indeed one of the primary reasons given for the discontinuation of the UK CCS competition was the view that the costs to consumers of the first CCS projects would be high and regressive<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1151"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1151</span></sup></a> although it was acknowledged that the cost was likely to be higher for the first CCS projects as they provide transport and storage (T&amp;S) infrastructure that could be used by subsequent projects. In the short term the cost of CCS for power generation will continue to be compared to alternative forms of low-carbon power generation even though those alternatives (and their intermittent output) will lead to higher system-wide costs in the long run.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1152"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1152</span></sup></a> In facing up to this challenge any new approaches to CCS commercialisation will need to deliver significant short-term reductions in the costs of first mover projects.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The driving forces for cost reduction have been set out in the CCS cost reduction task force (CRTF) report<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1153"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1153</span></sup></a> published in 2013 as part of the UK government's CCS roadmap,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1154"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1154</span></sup></a> including:</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(1) investment in large CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage hubs, supplying multiple CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> sites connected through large, shared pipelines, with high load factors;</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(2) investment in large power stations with progressive improvements in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture capability that should be available as from the early 2020s;</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(3) a reduction in the cost of project capital through a set of measures to reduce risk and improve investor confidence in UK CCS projects; and</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(4) exploiting potential synergies with CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-based EOR in some Central North Sea oil fields.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">All of these drivers are as relevant today as they were when the CRTF report was issued in 2013. Based upon technology progress in the intervening years and by applying the lessons learnt from the UK CCS Competition, significant reductions in the cost of CCS first mover projects are achievable. Success will depend on the development of large scale anchor projects that invest simultaneously in over-sized T&amp;S infrastructure with third party access rights for follow on projects.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In addition, new commercial approaches will be required that balance multiple key risks (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig29">Fig. 29</a>) and see a transfer of some of the CCS specific development and operational risk from the private sector to the public sector beyond that previously envisaged.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1155</span></sup></a></p>

        <p class="otherpara">The CRTF predicted that the costs for CCS in the UK would be around £161 per MWh for the first mover projects and could approach £100 per MWh by the early 2020s, and achieve a cost significantly below £100 per MWh soon thereafter. The CRTF report was produced as part of the UK CCS roadmap and reflected the expected trajectory of cost reductions as experience and economies of scale grew against reducing capital and operating costs (discussed in Section 11). The UK CCS Commercialisation Programme, itself an integral part of the CCS roadmap, was aimed at attracting developers of first mover projects to invest in full chain CCS projects through a competitive process and offered a package of support in the form of capital grant funding, market price support through a contract for difference (CfD) and a share in the CCS specific risks.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The CRTF predictions for the first mover projects were largely borne out by the subsequent competition projects with the high prices largely a reflection of the adopted approach to risk allocation which crucially placed the full chain technical and commercial integration risk as well as significant CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage risk with the private sector developers and operators. By adopting new commercialisation approaches that focus on the identified cost reduction drivers and include a modified risk approach that accommodates the lessons learnt from the competition projects, much of the cost reduction potential envisaged by the CRTF for subsequent projects could already be realised for the first mover projects albeit with a transfer of risk to the public sector. This would bring the cost of CCS to levels that are competitive with alternative forms of low-carbon power making CCS more affordable from the outset.</p>

          <span id="sect5835"/><span class="c_heading_indent">13.4.1 CCS risk. </span>
          <span>The starting point for the development of the CCS industry has invariably been based on the premise that the private sector should deliver CCS and manage all of the technical and commercial integration risks across the full chain. Indeed there are many risks that the private sector is able to manage and price competitively especially where these are within the competences of the developers of the individual chain link elements and can be accommodated within their established business models. There are however certain risks, related to the nascent status of the industry and the lack of proven commercial models across the full chain, that the market will either only accept at a premium or indeed in some cases not accept at all whatever the price.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Based on the UK lessons learnt<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1149"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1149</span></sup></a> and the Key Knowledge Deliverables,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1156"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1156</span></sup></a> the CCS specific key risks that present the greatest challenges and could most benefit from additional public sector risk support to overcome barriers to CCS development and drive down costs through reduced risk premiums include:</p>
          <p class="otherpara">(i) Cross chain default (also referred to as “project on project”) risk;</p>
          <p class="otherpara">(ii) Post decommissioning CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage risk;</p>
          <p class="otherpara">(iii) Sub-surface CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage performance risks impacting on storage rates and capacity;</p>
          <p class="otherpara">(iv) Decommissioning cost sufficiency and financial securities related to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage permit;</p>
          <p class="otherpara">(v) Insurance market limitations for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> T&amp;S operations.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Risk (i) applies to all individual chain link elements, whereas risks (ii) to (v) apply almost exclusively to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage aspects. Risks (i) and (ii) would in all likelihood need to be absorbed by the public sector potentially for the lifetime of a specific CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> T&amp;S system, whereas risks (iii), (iv) and (v) may be time limited and transferrable back to the private sector as practical experience is gained and operating confidence increases. By introducing commercial models that entail a transfer of these risk categories to the public sector, not only can barriers be removed that have thus far prevented the private sector from investing in CCS, but also project financeability would increase and the risk premium added to the cost of capital funding would be significantly reduced.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">With private sector confidence in the deliverability of CCS being at a low ebb presently, together with the current lack of appetite to invest in the development of storage capacity where all of the risks (i) to (v) apply, there is a strong argument for the public sector to take direct responsibility for the realisation of the T&amp;S infrastructure. The creation of a publicly owned national transport and storage company (NT&amp;SCo) to provide secure long term CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage capacity, as recently recommended in a report by the parliamentary advisory group on CCS, chaired by Lord Oxburgh,<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> would provide much needed certainty and boost confidence in the deliverability of CCS. Such a company would provide a strong counterparty and a significantly de-risked T&amp;S infrastructure to potential private sector developers of generation and capture (G&amp;C) assets. The use of public sector financing for the T&amp;S assets would also bring benefits by lowering the overall cost of finance and as a consequence the cost of transporting and storing the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The Oxburgh report goes a step further and also considers public ownership of the G&amp;C assets with a view to privatisation after a period of successful operation. Private sector investment at a later stage would still require sufficient financial shielding from shortfalls in the availability of the T&amp;S infrastructure (cross chain default risk). This could be achieved through permitted unabated operation with assured revenue stream mechanisms for example through continuation of CfD payments or through switching to capacity market payments. Combining both CfD and capacity payment mechanisms for a single generator would however require amendments to current regulation. The private sector investor would also need to be shielded from liabilities associated with continued payment of T&amp;S capacity reservation and use-of-system fees should the G&amp;C assets suffer prolonged outages for example through contracting for capacity on a pay as you use basis with limitations of liability for non take-up.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Whether or not it is necessary for the public sector to take responsibility for the delivery of the G&amp;C assets rather than the private sector will depend upon confidence in the deliverability of CCS in the UK and the degree to which CCS specific key risks are transferred to the public sector, whether that occurs at the outset or at a later stage following initial operations. Whichever route is followed it will be important to leverage the skills and competences of the private sector that has established a good track record in the delivery of power generation assets since privatisation of the electricity markets in 1990.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Though there are many ways to structure the commercial arrangements between the various stakeholders in a CCS network including direct public sector engagement, regulated asset based models, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Success will depend upon the appropriate balance of risk between the private sector and the public sector taking into account the listed CCS specific key risks. It will also be important that models form a robust template for the long term development of the CCS industry that is most likely to develop along the lines of clusters of users alongside CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> T&amp;S services providers with a clear transfer of liability for the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to the T&amp;S service provider, potentially a NT&amp;SCo in the UK, at the factory boundary (<a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig30">Fig. 30</a>).</p>

          <span>In order to benefit from economies of scale, future programmes for the commercialisation of CCS should be based on the establishment of a large scale anchor project with 10–15 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year T&amp;S capacity. The aim should be to maximise the clean power output to reduce the unit cost of CCS per MWh. CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> intensity in terms of t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per MWh should be as low as possible to minimise the scale up factor for the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture technology. This would also be advantageous in minimising the initial capacity reservation in the T&amp;S system allowing more capacity for follow-on third party users thus achieving a critical mass as soon as possible. Based upon these considerations and given the current status of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture technology in terms of proven operation at commercial scale, the optimum anchor project should feature a <span class="italic">ca.</span> 1 GW gas combined cycle plant with post combustion capture technology currently available competitively from a number of suppliers.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">To maximise the future benefit of the established T&amp;S infrastructure, the anchor project should be sited in a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-intense industrial cluster. In the UK, there are several such clusters, located mostly along the east coast. This would also reduce transportation distances to the vast potential for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage sites in the Central and Southern North Sea. Keeping pipelines short and avoiding overland pipelines as far as possible will help to keep costs down and avoid protracted, complex and costly easement negotiations with a number of landowners.</p>

        <span>The funding of CCS requires that a predictable and secure revenue stream is available to cover the costs of CCS and allow the developer to meet all of its financial needs. This will invariably require non-market derived sources of income and/or beneficial tax incentives for the generation of low-carbon power with CCS and the long-term storage of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In the UK, power generation is currently the only sector for which existing regulation and financial frameworks are in place to support low-carbon technology through market price support mechanisms established through the electricity market reform (EMR) and as enshrined in the 2013 Energy Act.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit81"><sup><span class="sup_ref">81</span></sup></a> CCS is recognised as a low-carbon technology and as such qualifies for financial support through the CfD mechanism.

          <span id="sect5893"/><span class="c_heading_indent">13.5.1 Contract for difference. </span>
          <span>The allocation of funds from the Levy Control framework (LCF) for CCS projects is key for the development of CCS projects with power generation. The revenue certainty provided through a CfD linked to a strike price for clean power generation is fundamental to the financial viability of a CCS project. However, clarification of the LCF budget (£7.6 billion in 2020/21)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1158"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1158</span></sup></a> available to CCS following the recent cancellation of the UK CCS Commercialisation competition, as well as the detailed terms and conditions of the CfD, is required from government.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">The development of a CCS project can take several years with costs running into several tens of millions of pounds. It is crucial therefore that the CfD allocation process provides developers with a high degree of certainty that a fully funded CfD will be available at the right strike price once they are ready to take a final investment decision on their projects. Even with such certainty however, a degree of public sector compensation of CCS project development costs is likely to be needed to mitigate to some degree the perceived political risk in such development programmes.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">Much of the system-wide value of CCS derives from its ability to operate as flexible generation capacity alongside base load technologies like new nuclear and intermittent renewables. The CfD however as currently designed encourages base load operation as the marginal costs of production can always be covered. If the full value of CCS is to be realised mechanisms should be developed that reward flexibility.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The term of the CfD for CCS projects is set at 15 years in the generic CfD contract. By increasing the term to 20 years, significant reductions in the strike price can be achieved. Other design aspects that warrant further development include valuation and reward for negative emissions (BECCS) and application or alternative mechanism for industrial EII projects for which there is currently no CfD equivalent.</p>

          <span id="sect5901"/><span class="c_heading_indent">13.5.2 Alternative funding mechanisms. </span>
          <span>Part of the reason that the strike prices anticipated for the two preferred bidder projects under the second UK CCS commercialisation programme were relatively high, compared to alternative forms of low carbon power generation, lies in the fact that they carry the costs of oversized infrastructure for future users. As long as this approach is taken the leveraging effect that this has on the required strike price for a relatively small clean power output capacity will disadvantage any anchor project in a simple numerical comparison with strike prices of established alternative forms of low-carbon generation. If the potential benefit for follow-on projects is not taken into account in terms of pre-paid and de-risked T&amp;S infrastructure leading to significantly lower strike prices for such follow-on projects then this bias is likely to continue to prevent the CCS industry from developing.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Alternative funding mechanisms across the full chain could be considered that would eliminate this bias. Currently, an unabated fossil fuel power generator can emit CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to atmosphere for a relatively low cost<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn29">||||||||||</a> and, along with its customers, be forever freed from any future liability for the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the moment it leaves the stack. The CCS-enabled generator carries the cost of development of T&amp;S infrastructure for its own and future users’ needs and has long-term liability for the safe and secure storage of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured. Under the principle of the polluter pays consideration should be given to spreading the costs of the T&amp;S infrastructure over all fossil fuelled power generators and potentially other CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emitters either through a hypothecation of carbon floor price levies, a carbon tax, or a form of CCS obligation certificate similar to the renewables obligation certificate first introduced in 2002 that was instrumental in supporting the early deployment of renewable technology in the UK.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a></p>
          <p class="otherpara">Such an alternative approach to funding of the T&amp;S infrastructure would significantly reduce the strike price required by the CCS enabled generator to a level more competitive with alternative forms of low-carbon generation. It would also ensure that the value that CCS brings at the total energy system level in terms of decarbonising the economy is paid for more broadly across society and provide the economic drivers for further decarbonisation technology development using tax (or similar levies) as a behaviour modifier.</p>

Providing the grant in this way does not change the risk profile of the project, but serves only to reduce the developers’ financial exposure to full chain risks regardless of their nature including many business as usual risks. For future programmes it is worth considering targeting any grant funding to those risks in the full chain where there is a lack of market appetite particularly relating to the storage element. Deploying grant funding in this way for a multi-user store, without the requirement for a return on investment built in to the T&amp;S capacity reservation and use-of-system fees, would provide several G&amp;C and EII developers with low-cost CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> T&amp;S services representing a far better outcome for the public funding deployed.</span>

The providers of project finance will in turn evaluate the credit worthiness of a CCS enabled power generation project on its stand-alone merits <span class="italic">i.e.</span> the ability of the project to meet its debt service obligations even when operating under certain adverse physical or economic conditions. The revenue certainty provided by the CfD mechanism, contracted through the low carbon contracts company (LCCC), is very attractive from a project finance perspective.

        <span>To date, efforts around the world to develop a commercially viable CCS industry have largely failed despite the levels of government intervention and support that have been considered. If this trend is to be reversed the lessons of the past need to be learned and new approaches developed.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The private sector is very unlikely to deliver fully integrated CCS infrastructure and projects without increased public sector support and clear government policy that supports CCS. It is imperative therefore for governments to take firm decisions on whether or not CCS technology will form a key part of their long-term low-carbon future energy strategy.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Where the case for CCS is made, a clear and stable CCS energy policy with a comprehensive roadmap for delivery will be required. This is necessary to build confidence in the deliverability of CCS and to attract the necessary private sector investment. In the UK a new strategy for CCS commercialisation is needed as a matter of urgency as each year of delay in deployment substantially increases the costs of decarbonisation of the UK economy in future years.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">CCS can support carbon reduction efforts across all major carbon emitting sectors and represents an essential component of the low-cost pathway to energy-system-wide decarbonisation. Development of CCS will create some costs; however a vibrant CCS industry will bring significant GVA to the economy as well as generate substantial employment potential.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">For CCS to take off as a commercially viable and financeable proposition, the public sector will need to accept more of the development and operational risks that have thus far proved to represent unsurmountable barriers for the private sector, most notably in terms of commercial integration of the full chain and the development and operation of storage sites in a multi-user environment.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">By optimising the structure, scale, location, technology choices and introducing new commercial models with modified risk reward structures, on the basis of increased public sector allocation of certain CCS specific key risks, the cost of CCS can be reduced significantly. Strike prices that are competitive with alternative forms of low-carbon generation should be achievable including for the first mover anchor projects.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In the UK, the creation of a government backed national CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> T&amp;S company, with responsibility for the development of T&amp;S infrastructure guaranteeing the long-term availability of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage capacity for G&amp;C and EII users, would be necessary for the successful development of the CCS industry. The availability of a de-risked T&amp;S infrastructure would provide a much firmer basis for the private sector to develop G&amp;C and EII assets in the UK.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The financial viability of CCS in the power generation sector currently requires a source of funding out with that which can be derived solely from market trading to cover the extra capital and operating costs and provide investors with an adequate return for the risks involved. In the UK, the CfDs available to CCS-enabled power generators are a good example of how this can be achieved. As the market adjusts to further penetration of low carbon generation technologies, as CCS design and operating experience grows and capital and operation costs reduce, the additional funding required <span class="italic">via</span> the CfD will reduce accordingly. If CCS is to be successfully deployed by EII operators a comparable mechanism will need to be devised.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In order to reduce the costs of the first mover projects, large scale power generation anchor projects (<span class="italic">ca.</span> 1 GW) connected to multi-user T&amp;S CCS infrastructure should be envisaged from the outset. CCS technology is ready for large scale deployment.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The benefits of CCS are economy wide however the costs have invariably been seen as the responsibility of the developer operator of a CCS project. Alternative funding mechanisms could be considered to spread the costs of CCS infrastructure across all major emitters. This would align with the principle of the polluter pays and also reduce the cost to the consumer of the low-carbon electricity generated.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">UKGS financial guarantees should also be considered to support UK developers of G&amp;C assets in securing the finance needed for their investment bringing increasing project credit ratings and reducing costs.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">If the lessons of previous unsuccessful CCS development programmes are learnt and the remaining challenges to full commercialisation resolved though new commercial approaches, there is every chance that CCS will be able to play its envisaged key role in supporting the cost effective decarbonisation of energy use across the economy starting in the early 2020s.</p>

      <span>Compared to other leading alternatives for mitigating climate change such as nuclear energy, biofuels and renewable energy, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies is a relatively new and unfamiliar option for large-scale decarbonisation and, as such, the politics and economics are not yet settled. Debates over CCS have been embryonic and fairly tepid when compared to nuclear power for example, where entrenched views and social movements have led to vocal political opposition since the 1960s;<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1159"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1159</span></sup></a> or biofuels, where non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have provoked heated disputes over potential competition with food and impacts on biodiversity and sustainability.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1160"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1160</span></sup></a> Even renewables, which are generally viewed more favourably on a national level, have also seen significant opposition, usually local, with opponents sometimes criticised for being driven by not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) concerns.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1161"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1161</span></sup></a> In all cases, there have been longstanding government support mechanisms in the form of large scale R&amp;D, subsidies and other support mechanisms, reflecting interests coalescing in support (or opposition) to specific options over the course of years and decades.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1162"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1162</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">By contrast, CCS has largely been far removed from attention of not only the public, but also of politicians and other key stakeholders.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit43"><sup><span class="sup_ref">43,1163</span></sup></a> Despite this wider neglect, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has led efforts to consolidate and disseminate knowledge on the subject and have highlighted the benefits (and to a lesser-extent the challenges) of large-scale deployment. Other leading analytical organisations such as the International Energy Agency (IEA)<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1164"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1164</span></sup></a> or the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC), have found CCS to be critical to efforts to meet aggressive decarbonisation targets at least cost. For example, the CCC finds that without CCS, the cost of meeting the UK's 2050 targets would be twice as high as if CCS were to be included.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit89"><sup><span class="sup_ref">89</span></sup></a> As discussed in the introduction to this paper, the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report describes how leaving out CCS would result in far higher costs for an aggressive decarbonisation strategy than would be the case if similar limitations were imposed on other low-carbon technologies (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, costs would be on average 138% higher under a 450 ppm scenario if CCS were unavailable, compared to 7% higher if omitting nuclear power, 8% for limited penetration of solar/wind and 64% for bioenergy).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit45"><sup><span class="sup_ref">45</span></sup></a> Even more tellingly, when asked to solve such a stabilisation scenario, in the electricity sector only 5 models can even solve without recourse to CCS, compared to 36 models with CCS. In the industrial sector, only 3 models could solve (compared with 22 with CCS).</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Indeed, there were many reasons to expect that deploying CCS technologies would be relatively straightforward in political economy terms. CCS is the rare option that could address many important policy goals simultaneously including: addressing concerns over security of supply by providing both base-load and flexible low-carbon power; appealing to major influential stakeholders in industry; and allowing for the possibility of decarbonising existing and planned infrastructure in major developing countries. Moreover, CCS is fairly unique in providing viable options for hard-to-reach sectors including process industries such as chemicals, cement, steel as well as offering a potential pathway for negative emissions technologies (NETs) with biomass energy plus CCS (BECCS). Still, in spite of the advent of a few individual projects, driven by local context and incentives, CCS has had, at best, a chequered track record over the past decade.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit39"><sup><span class="sup_ref">39</span></sup></a></p>
      <p class="otherpara">Research into CCS dates back to the 1990s although the constituent parts have been tested over the course of many decades. Yet, CCS did not emerge as a potential energy option for low-carbon development until the 2000s. The IPCC Third Assessment Report (TAR) of 2001 did not devote more than one paragraph out of its 58 page Technical Summary to CCS. The first serious effort by the international scientific community to investigate the technologies was when the IPCC issued a 443 page Special Report on CCS in 2005 at the same time as the issue was receiving attention from many national governments and international institutions.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">The optimism of 2005 was followed by a series of announcements and cancellations by both government and industry, but more recently, over the course of just the past two years, a number of operational large-scale projects have emerged. The full-chain (capture, transport and storage) exemplars that store roughly 1 million tons or more of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> per year have come on line include the Boundary Dam project in south-eastern Saskatchewan and the Shell Quest project in northern Alberta in Canada, the Petra Nova project in Texas, Emirates Steel in Abu Dhabi.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1165"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1165</span></sup></a> Other new projects slated to launch in 2017 include the Illinois Industrial CCS project (1 Mtpa), which claims to the first biomass energy with CCS (BECCS) project, the Gorgon LNG facility in Australia (capable of up to 4 Mtpa) and other CCS projects in Canada associated with the Alberta Trunk Line project. Prior to Boundary Dam beginning operations in 2014, however, the only large-scale efforts had been storage projects such as Sleipner and Snøhvit in Norway and In Salah in Algeria, which all used CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from gas processing facilities.</p>
      <p class="otherpara">Looking forward however, the pipeline slows and little new CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture capacity is expected between 2018 and 2022. Moreover, according to the IEA, very few national commitments on the advent of the 2015 Paris Climate Conference (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, intended nationally determined contributions or IDNC), even mention the possibility of using CCS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1166"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1166</span></sup></a> In spite of its scant coverage in the IPCC's 2001 TAR, the reduction potential by 2020 was estimated at 150–750 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> primarily in the power sector, ‘split equally between coal and gas, and between developed and developing countries’. According to the Global CCS Institute, in 2020, large scale capture will amount to only 40 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year, virtually all of which will be in developed countries and the vast majority will be from gas processing and for use in enhanced oil recovery operations. The question therefore is how to explain this uneven and slower-than-expected rollout of CCS, first, the slow progress, followed by a spurt of new projects and then a drying up of projects before lessons can be learned from the first projects?</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect5980"><span class="b_heading">14.1 Stakeholder views</span></h3>
        <span>CCS has largely remained a technological and future-oriented solution and as a result, most firms and NGOs have kept a ‘watching brief’ on the issue but have not been involved deeply in advocacy (either in favour or against), with a few exceptions. In the early 2000s, under the leadership of John Browne, BP was the first major industry advocate for using CCS and sought to build a series of ‘decarbonised fossil’ (DF) plants, including DF-1 at Peterhead in Scotland, DF-2 at a petroleum coke plant in Carson, California, DF-3 at Kwinana in Australia and DF-4 at Hydrogen Power Abu Dhabi.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1167"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1167</span></sup></a> All of these projects failed for a variety of reasons including government reluctance to pick winners and local opposition. The one small success was the In Salah storage project at its facility in Algeria, which stored 1 Mtpa from 2004–2011. When Tony Hayward took over as CEO in 2007, however, BP largely abandoned its role as a strong advocate.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In the meantime, other large energy firms became more deeply involved in supporting the technology, notably, Shell and Statoil. Other firms, which had taken a more active role in the expectation of growing demand for CCS include oil field services firm Schlumberger, which set up a carbon services division, power equipment manufacturers such as Alstom (now GE), and chemicals firms with air separation capabilities such as Air Products and BOC. Still, many other leading firms such as ExxonMobil or Halliburton have shied away from significant involvement. Finally, despite the initial focus being almost entirely on power sector decarbonisation, virtually all electric utilities (including those that had been early leaders and enthusiasts such as Vattenfall in Europe and AEP in the US) have given up on CCS due to a lack of political and financial support. Most recent projects have been led by oil and gas companies. For example, in the most recent UK Competition, the two finalists were not led by electric utilities, which were effectively junior partners. The one clear exception is the Boundary Dam project where SaskPower, as a Crown Corporation (owned by the provincial government) has a very different set of incentives and governance structure than any private sector power company.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The environmentalist view is probably best summarised by a 2006 position paper by the Climate Action Network Europe umbrella group, which argued that CCS ‘may have a role to play’ but ‘climate policy cannot wait for any one technology’ and ‘CCS must not divert public investments or political attention away from renewable energy and energy efficiency’.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1168"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1168</span></sup></a> There have been some NGOs that have taken a more positive stance. In 2011, a number of small to medium sized NGOs – Bellona and ZERO in Norway, Green Alliance, E3G and Sandbag in the UK, Pembina Institute in Canada, the Climate Institute in Australia and the Natural Resources Defence Council, Clean Air Task Force and World Resources Institute in the US – came together to form an ENGO network on CCS. The distribution of these NGOs also reflects the countries where CCS has received the greatest attention and support. The largest NGOs, such as WWF and Friends of the Earth, have taken a relatively positive if muted view, given the large diversity of their national branches.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Other NGOs, notably Greenpeace, have been more critical voices. For example, the only major example of open advocacy against CCS was their 2008 report <span class="italic">False Hope</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1169"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1169</span></sup></a> Their concerns were that: (i) CCS ‘won’t deliver in time’ (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, before 2030); (ii) underground storage is risky and poses significant liability; (iii) CCS wastes energy, is expensive and undermines funding in sustainable solutions; and (iv) the world already has the solutions to the climate crisis in the form of renewables. Linked to these concerns is a view that CCS simply perpetuates fossil fuels, which is compounded by many of the first projects being part-financed by using the captured CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Still, there is little evidence that NGO opposition has done much to shift support (for or against) CCS on specific projects or at a national level.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The one area where opposition has made a difference is when local concerns derailed the prospects of CCS, specifically in onshore projects in Germany and the Netherlands. For example, the effort by Shell in 2007–2010 to develop a pilot storage site at Barendrecht (outside of the Netherlands) in the face of significant public opposition ultimately led first to the project being abandoned and then to all onshore storage in the Netherlands being banned.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1170"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1170,1171</span></sup></a></p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect5995"><span class="b_heading">14.2 The politics of CCS</span></h3>
        <span>Governments have been, if anything, less consistent in their support of CCS technologies than non-state actors. There have been a handful of countries or jurisdictions, all of which are reliant on fossil fuels, where CCS has moved up the political agenda to the point where it emerged onto the wider political stage. In Canada, resource-rich provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta took the lead, and in the US, projects were pushed forward in Texas, Mississippi and Alabama, despite these regions being most sceptical of the need for action on climate change. In Europe, although domestic politics were more favourable towards climate action, the common denominator of the leaders, Norway, the Netherlands and the UK was that they were Europe's main natural gas producers. Australia, whose economy is almost completely dependent on resources, even tried to assert overall leadership by creating a Global CCS Institute funded at A$100 million per year.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Nevertheless, here had been some indications that, even in leading jurisdictions, the politics of CCS would not be as easy as some had assumed and that turning expert consensus into action faced some serious political and economic obstacles. Although, as noted earlier, CCS is largely unknown to the public and many stakeholders, there have been cases where the subject has become politically salient, notably in these resource-rich economies and if CCS becomes an issue then there is a danger of being on the losing side.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Norway was the first nation to take CCS seriously as the government made the decision over whether CCS would be mandated on all fossil-fired generation, which at the time only involved a single gas-fired plant.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1172"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1172</span></sup></a> The technology continued to rise up the national agenda to the point where, in 2011, Jens Stoltenberg, the prime minister, declared CCS would be Norway's “Moon mission”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1173"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1173</span></sup></a> The first major effort was focused on Statoil's Mongstad oil refinery, one of the largest point sources in the country, first on a test centre to be followed by full-scale capture. Unfortunately, the costs of Mongstad rose dramatically, leading to the larger ambitions for full-scale capture at Mongstad being first delayed in 2011 and then abandoned in 2013 (after an expenditure of over $1 billion) although the large Test Centre Mongstad continues.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1174"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1174</span></sup></a> This failure and criticism from Norway's Auditor General for cost overruns led the Norwegian government to completely revisit its approach to CCS before being relaunched in 2016, with a commitment to have a full-chain project operating by 2022.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1175"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1175</span></sup></a> There has been, therefore, fairly consistent support from one government to the next although with some division over specific details.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">CCS became an issue in provincial elections in both Alberta and Saskatchewan with differing outcomes. In Alberta, the long-serving Conservative government had advocated for CCS. During the 2015 election campaign, the climate sceptic Wildrose Party opposed any further spending on CCS and promised to cancel the Quest project. Ultimately, the socialist New Democratic Party (NDP) won the election and although they had been sceptical of CCS and preferred renewables and carbon pricing, once in power the new left-wing government continued to support the project. In Saskatchewan, Brad Wall, the right-leaning premier who had championed CCS throughout his term, highlighted the Boundary Dam project in launching his 2016 re-election campaign. In response, the opposition NDP sought to highlight cost overruns and technical problems at Boundary Dam. Ultimately, Wall was easily re-elected with a 62% mandate and increased his majority to 51 of the 61 seats in the Legislative Assembly.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In some cases, the shift that followed an election was more dramatic. In Australia, the Tony Abbott Government cut the CCS budget by some 70% in its first budget (cutting A$460 million out of A$650 million), after having campaigned against Labour's climate-friendly agenda. In a stealthier manner, with a brief note to markets, the new majority Conservative government in the UK abandoned the 1 billion competition that had been initiated in 2011 when the Conservatives were in coalition with the Liberal Democrats.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In other cases, the barriers were more institutional than political. The MIT Future of Coal study in 2007, led by Ernie Moniz, the condemned the US Government's reliance on small-scale scale storage projects and called for 3–4 large-scale storage projects of greater than 1 million tons per year and significant investment in major demonstration projects.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1176"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1176</span></sup></a> Yet, as Secretary of Energy under President Obama, Moniz was unable to push through any major project, hemmed in by Congressional recalcitrance to take action on climate change and vested interests in the form of the existing Department of Energy (DOE) regional partnerships, each of which touted the benefits of their own small-scale storage experiments.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">At a more technical level, governments can over-specify or poorly specify the rules and conditions and thereby reduce the viability of projects. The UK, which had been considered a leader in policy design pre-2015, has seen no less than three failed efforts to fund large-scale CCS demonstration projects. The first failure, BP's DF-1 project at Peterhead, failed in the early 2000s because the UK Government did not want to ‘pick winners’, which led to a first CCS competition. According to its own National Audit Office (NAO), the first Competition failed because of the government's insistence on mandating post-combustion coal thereby imposing unnecessary constraints on top of a poorly designed procurement process.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1177"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1177</span></sup></a> The second competition was cancelled in late 2015 and the government was criticised by the NAO for failing to properly quantify the costs of delaying large-scale deployment and take that account in their decision and pointed to inter-departmental battles with HM Treasury. The House of Commons Public Accounts Committee also issued a harsh report pointing to the additional cost of decarbonisation without CCS, the hole in the Government's long-term plans for decarbonisation and the damage to investor confidence from the hasty withdrawal of funding.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1178"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1178</span></sup></a> Despite the stern criticism from policy circles, the decision produced few political repercussions other than some criticism from the opposition (primarily from the Scottish National Party), but relatively minimal media coverage.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1179"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1179</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">There have, of course, been cases where the problem was primarily technology choice and economics. The Kemper County project in Mississippi, which was intended to be a large 582 MW coal IGCC plant, was driven by interests in providing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to nearby oil fields and taking advantage of the proximity of minemouth coal rather than climate ambition. Like earlier IGCC projects in the 1970s and 1980s which suffered from delays, cost overruns and reliability problems the Kemper project was delayed repeatedly. With costs projected to exceed $7 billion (some $5 billion more than the original estimate) and plagued by years of technical problems, low gas prices and a complicated supply chain, the plant owners, Southern Company, decided to halt the IGCC element and continue operating as a conventional natural gas power plant.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Outside of the core leading countries or regions, the problem has been even more severe, in part because of the perception that CCS is at best of marginal interest and, at worst, would cannibalise support from preferred technologies. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) offers an example of the impact of CCS being perceived as being of relevance to only a select few.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit1180"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1180,1181</span></sup></a> CDM was designed as a flexibility mechanism under the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 to allow public or private actors to get credit for abatement activities carried out in developing countries.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1182"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1182</span></sup></a> Many of the countries that benefited from CDM projects using existing approaches, for example, those receiving credit for afforestation projects in Latin America, were concerned that if CCS was included in the CDM, they would lose out. As a result, it took from 2005 to 2011 to officially accept even the possibility of using CCS as an option within the CDM and still not a single project has emerged.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another instance of the marginalisation of CCS can be seen in the European debate, despite early ambitions. The European Union, as an institution, took some encouraging steps, such as issuing a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> Storage Directive (Directive 2009/31/EC) to encourage all member states to prepare appropriate regulations for storing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> supplemented by other support mechanisms (to which only a handful of member states responded). A zero emissions fossil fuel power plant (ZEP) technology platform was launched in 2005 with an aim to have up to twelve full-chain projects across Europe by 2020.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">To that end, the EU created a new mechanism to provide financial support through its NER 300 programme, which reserved 300 million emissions permits from the New Entrants Reserve (NER) for auction.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1183"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1183</span></sup></a> The price of carbon in the ETS collapsed from over €20 to close to €5 and so much of the anticipated funding stream disappeared, but even more importantly, the scope of the NER300 was expanded to include innovative renewable technologies (IRTs). Unlike CCS, virtually every country had one or more small-scale IRT projects to advance. When NER300 projects were finally awarded under the first call, 15 diverse renewables projects in over a dozen member states had been selected, but not a single CCS project was funded.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Here too, part of the explanation was institutional since the priorities of the European Commission did not necessarily align with those of the member states that were expected to cover most of the bill. For example, the project rated highest of all by the Commission, the Hatfield/Don Valley project did not even make the shortlist of four projects that the UK Government was considering and so the potential of aligning sources of funding was missed.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect6025"><span class="b_heading">14.3 Future challenges and opportunities</span></h3>
        <span>In the wake of the Paris agreement's reaffirmation of a 2 °C global target with an aim ‘to pursue efforts towards’ 1.5 °C, a rapid scale up of CCS (including BECCS and CCS for industry) should be crucial. Yet, the prospects for CCS technologies are problematic (and at a complete standstill in many countries), driven by the political economy challenge of decarbonising fossil fuels as much as by any technological or economic barriers. It is misleading though to describe the problems as primarily one of cost or economics. Some low-carbon technologies such as offshore wind receive generous subsidies of the scale that would be needed for CCS. Other technologies such as nuclear power have existed for over sixty years and yet at least some governments still willingly provide large subsidies.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Undoubtedly, there are important technical, economic and commercial challenges, which help explain the slow rollout of CCS, but the political economy, which initially appeared promising, has proven to be more problematic than anticipated. As Lord Oxburgh has aptly described it, CCS is an ‘orphan technology’.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1184"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1184</span></sup></a> Unlike nuclear power (or onshore wind), there are no strong opponents, but equally there are few if any advocates willing to lobby strongly. If there were to be unambiguous, serious political commitment to meeting a 2 °C target, then all large energy firms would eagerly lobby for CCS, but for most (and many politicians), their preferred alternative is continued unabated fossil fuel use.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A few resource-rich countries such as Canada, the US, Australia and Norway have moved forward with CCS almost independent of (or despite) their level of commitment to climate change. The economic crisis of 2007–2008 and the stimulus spending that followed meant that CCS was carried along, which, in spite of numerous setbacks, allowed a half dozen large integrated facilities to emerge since 2014. Yet, the portfolio of new projects at even an advanced planning stage is diminishing. Given the long time-scales involved and significant possibility of governments or firms or both reneging on commitments, the cupboard is essentially bare.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The recent round of emergent projects offers an important opportunity for learning. Global R&amp;D on CCS is increasing and in some countries, such as Norway and the US, R&amp;D support has been particularly generous. There will therefore be technological progress; the question is whether the political economy dynamic will change. Ultimately, CCS provides a litmus test for how serious governments take the challenge of deep decarbonisation. If there is a genuine effort to meet ambitious climate targets then, if the many analyses are correct, the needed shifts in incentives and regulations will mean change the interests (and the economics) and large-scale deployment CCS will eventually follow.</p>

        <h3 id="sect6036"><span class="b_heading">15.1 Benchmarking CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mitigation cost</span></h3>
        <span>For any process capturing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, costs are comprised of the capital to install carbon capture and storage (CCS) equipment, the fixed costs to operate, and the variable cost to operate which includes the electricity the facility would have otherwise generated had CCS not been implemented. The key challenge is to reduce, by the greatest extent possible, the increase in the cost of the decarbonised product, be this a tonne of low carbon steel or cement or a MWh or low carbon electricity. Whilst the perspectives and analyses presented in this section are general in nature, the remainder of this discussion will be constrained to the perspective of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture with subsequent storage in a saline aquifer implemented in the coal-fired power industry.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Even in this context, there are a number of ways one can choose to calculate the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture cost that includes all three cost categories mentioned in some form. However, for the purposes of comparing the performance of one CCS technology <span class="italic">versus</span> another and for evaluating the most impactful CCS methods (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, more CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured) this paper will formulate discussion around the following calculation:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn21"/><a href="/image/article/2018/EE/c7ee02342a/c7ee02342a-t13_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c7ee02342a-t13.tif" src="/image/article/2018/EE/c7ee02342a/c7ee02342a-t13.gif"/></a></td><td class="rightEqn">(21)</td></tr></table>The CCS community is most interested in reducing the cost to capture and dispose of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. However, the power generation industry is most interested in selling electricity; anything that significantly adds to the cost to generate power is therefore of priority interest. Furthermore, the power industry as an entity exists to satisfy a given power demand; therefore both Cost of Electricity (COE) terms calculated in <a title="" href="#eqn21">eqn (21)</a> assume a fixed net power generation of each plant (to satisfy a fixed demand) regardless of whether CCS is installed or not. Consistent with this perspective, the captured cost numerator calculates the difference in cost to generate one Megawatt-hour of electricity with CCS <span class="italic">versus</span> one Megawatt-hour without CCS. Because <a title="" href="#eqn21">eqn (21)</a> incorporates all systems-level factors relevant for assessing CCS impact (cost, efficiency and amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured) a major premise of this section is that captured cost is a sufficient proxy for guiding the improvement of CCS R&amp;D.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The effect of CCS on COE can be inferred through examination of:<table><td class="leftEqn"> </td><tr><td class="eqn"><span id="eqn22"/><a href="/image/article/2018/EE/c7ee02342a/c7ee02342a-t14_hi-res.gif" title="Select to open image in new window" onclick="open(this.href, &#34;_blank&#34;, &#34;toolbar=1,scrollbars=yes,resizable=1&#34;); return false;"><img alt="image file: c7ee02342a-t14.tif" src="/image/article/2018/EE/c7ee02342a/c7ee02342a-t14.gif"/></a></td><td class="rightEqn">(22)</td></tr></table>where CCF is the capital charge factor, CC is capital cost, VOM is the variable operating and maintenance, CF is the capacity factor, FOM is fixed operating and maintenance, and MWh<small><sub>net</sub></small> is the net power generation capacity.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In general, without balance of plant improvements, and compared to a plant without CCS, CCS always increases COE. Practically, CCS adds to all cost terms in the numerator of <a title="" href="#eqn22">eqn (22)</a> (CC, VOM, FOM). Importantly, owing to the level of perceived risk associated with a “new technology”, the CCF is also likely to increase, at least for initial projects.

        <h3 id="sect6066"><span class="b_heading">15.2 Establishing a framework to evaluate CCS technology</span></h3>
        <span>In practice, there are numerous ways for a power plant to generate the power required to operate the CCS system. There are also numerous power generation sources of varying CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> footprints (nuclear, solar, wind, natural gas, <span class="italic">etc.</span>) from which a plant can purchase electricity to operate a CCS system. In the interest of reducing confounding factors in the cost analysis, this discussion will not explicitly consider all options for electricity generation or its source. Instead, we imply in <a title="" href="#eqn21">eqn (21)</a> a formulation that the power required to operate the CCS equipment is generated by the base plant with CCS; <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, when calculating COE of a plant with CCS, one does not use the MW of power generation of a plant without CCS in the denominator. <a title="" href="#eqn21">Eqn (21)</a> is then somewhat of an abstract comparison of plants with and without CCS, as it suggests a comparison of COE of one plant that is different in size than another. However, there are three main benefits of such a perspective.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The first benefit is that each CCS technology can be evaluated independently of the method to provide the electrical load to operate it. The second is that each CCS technology is evaluated under consistent constraints to satisfy a given power demand and the resultant penalties in cost and performance. The third is that the balance of plant contribution to COE is calculated assuming the same equipment and costing methods, which more accurately isolates the true cost of implementing CCS (including larger equipment sizes and/or auxiliary equipment). While there a better metrics to assess the true financial burden on the entity installing and operating CCS on any specific plant, the metrics proposed here are ideal for objectively evaluating a range of CCS technologies.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">With this in mind, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has proposed near term goals for reducing the cost to capture CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> and uses the above metrics in its assessment of the promise these technologies have for mitigating emissions from fossil-based power plants. In this framework, it is convenient to isolate two main factors that drive the cost to capture CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>: energy penalty to separate and compress the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, which result in a loss of power generation efficiency, and cost penalties, which are those costs required to build, install and operate the equipment. The energy penalty explicitly accounts for the electricity requirements to power the CCS equipment, as such embody the cost of lost power generation and associated lost revenue. Recall, the calculations assume the electricity required to run the CCS system is provided by the same plant fitted with the CCS system. The cost penalties required to operate the equipment do not include this lost revenue or power purchase costs, but instead includes the fixed and variable operating cost of supplies, personnel, maintenance, <span class="italic">etc.</span> If one acknowledges this distinction between the two cost types, the R&amp;D efforts can be largely split between performance improvements and equipment/operating cost reductions. Decomposing costs in this manner is convenient from a systems perspective because the balance between performance improvements and their associated installation/operating cost increases can be explicitly analysed and optimised.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In the context of the equations presented above, the U.S. DOE has set a target for captured cost at $40 per tonne of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured and compressed to 152.7 bar (2214.7 psi) for sequestration in a saline aquifer. Cost and performance assumptions used to obtain this target are summarised in an extensive set of guidelines which can be found in Fisher <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1186"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1186</span></sup></a> Under these same assumptions and within the same calculational framework, today's cost to capture CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is $61 per tonne, assuming a given solvent based CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture system detailed.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1187"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1187</span></sup></a> How to reduce the cost from $61 per tonne to $40 per tonne is a complex matter of extensive and multifaceted R&amp;D efforts.

Successful R&amp;D will produce a trajectory from the reference value to any point on the line that corresponds to $40 per tonne capture; to Point B, for example. A continuum of cost combinations can achieve the DOE goal, however, these combinations are bound by thermodynamic laws and practical cost reductions. In fact, the key insight in this chart is the lower limit on thermodynamic costs associated with the unavoidable energetic investment of an ideal, reversible separation and compression process. This thermodynamically infeasible region was calculated by first determining the minimum energy required to overcome the entropy of ideal mixing that corresponds to 90% separation of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> out of a mixture that initially contains 14 mol% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn30">******</a> The power required for reversible compression from 1.014 bar to 152.7 bar was then added to the ideal separation energy requirement for a total minimum energy requirement to capture and compress CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from a typical flue gas. More details on this calculation can be found in McGlashan and Marquis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1185</span></sup></a> The conclusion is that even if CCS equipment has zero installation and operation costs, there is a minimum energy penalty equating to ∼5–10% points of the base plant net power that manifests as an increase in COE, and thus a positive captured cost for a plant with even perfectly ideal CCS.</p>

        <p class="otherpara">The scope of this analysis is on carbon capture and compression, therefore the thermodynamic limit in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a> is developed assuming the only processes added to the base plant are the minimum required for 90% CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation from flue gas and compression to 152.7 bar. The scenarios depicted in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a> are specific to pulverised coal based power plants with post combustion carbon capture. While the ideal energy requirement to separate CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> liberated by a process relying on complete combustion of coal cannot change, balance of plant improvements can reduce the net energy penalty as reflected in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a>. For example, the minimum energy penalty of this separation and compression can be offset if implementing the CCS system provides a productive use of low grade heat not utilised in the base plant. Alternatively, changing the base power generation platform can also offset the net energy penalty by producing efficiency gains elsewhere in the process. It should be noted however that even power generation platforms projected to be among the most efficient options for power generation are only about one-third as effective at reducing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions than CCS.<a title="Select to navigate to footnote" href="#fn31">††††††</a> So while thermodynamic penalties may be offset by adopting more efficient power generation, the need for implementing and improving CCS is certainly not removed.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Because zero cost equipment is unrealistic, one can also presume a maximum capital/operating cost reduction that will limit the ultimate success of R&amp;D in this category, similar to the thermodynamic limit previously discussed. A maximum cost reduction is less rooted in fundamental theory and therefore is a more subjective limit that depends on technology, material, manufacturing improvement and even engineering intuition. While the exact value of maximum cost reduction will almost certainly be subject to significant debate, as an R&amp;D trajectory brings costs closer to zero, additional gains will become more difficult to attain and should be considered when devising an R&amp;D plan. <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a> assumes an 80% reduction limit on the cost per gross thermal input to the system.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">History has shown in many cases (in particular those cases that do not involve manufacturing or materials breakthroughs) that as thermodynamic improvements are made (<span class="italic">via</span> more integrated system configurations, better materials, or better devices) that equipment costs, installation costs, and/or operational costs generally increase. See the notional trajectory from Point A to Point C in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a>. This phenomenon suggests some degree of tolerance has typically been required for cost penalties as performance is improved, or <span class="italic">vice versa</span>. However, <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a> suggests a limit on tolerance for both types of penalties. Insight in this context can be gained by noting where the line that represents the DOE goal crosses into space that is thermodynamically-infeasible or cost-infeasible. The point at which these crossovers occur correlates to maximum acceptable penalty values on the vertical and horizontal axes. That is, if one penalty is too high, reducing the other such that the cost reduction goals are met requires an impossible value in infeasible space.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect6135"><span class="b_heading">15.3 Framing future CCS R&amp;D strategies</span></h3>
        <span>The location of the reference technology on <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a> suggests that most likely a combination of both cost and performance improvements are required to reach the DOE goal; at this point additional thermodynamic penalty will ultimately result in an infeasible path to the DOE target, with a similar conclusion for the cost penalties, albeit there seems to be a bit more room for cost excursions when targeting the DOE goal. To date, most R&amp;D for CCS has explored various ways to improve thermodynamics, independent of cost or manufacturing improvements. In fact, some early stage technologies are projecting a 50% reduction in net energy penalty compared to reference technology. This is remarkable, but unfortunately remains insufficient to reach the DOE target.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Cost projections in most of the CCS screening studies done to date carry a fairly large uncertainty range (±30–50%). However even with the error acknowledged in most studies performed, the trends still indicate performance enhancements tend to result in slightly increased capital/operating costs. To date, nearly all of the cost penalties of CCS technology are due to capital and installation costs. This suggests a need for more focused attention on reducing capital cost while preserving thermodynamic improvements. If additional capital cost penalties cannot be prevented, thermodynamic laws may ultimately prevent the CCS industry from reaching the DOE goal. The maturity of readily available equipment and state of the art manufacturing processes has left little room for equipment cost improvements. However, recent progress in advanced manufacturing and process intensification may provide additional options for realising cost improvements. New manufacturing techniques will allow production of multi-functional unit operations which require complexities in geometry that until recently were infeasible to build. Combining simultaneous thermodynamic operations in such a way may allow improved efficiencies in smaller equipment, with less raw material costs. For example, 3D printing techniques have great freedom in building multiple independent, yet adjacent flow paths in one unit operation which may allow nearly arbitrarily close integration of heat exchange, reaction, and mass exchange operations.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Reaching an optimal combination of cost and performance improvements requires a detailed understanding and ability to accurately simulate the underlying thermodynamics and kinetic phenomena in a manner sufficient for holistic optimisation of the entire system. Evaluating a CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture material in a system optimised for its performance is critical to properly assessing its promise and intelligently informing future R&amp;D pathways. Little work of this extent has been done to date. However, recent efforts in the Carbon Capture Simulation Initiative (CCSI) funded by the U.S. DOE's Office of Fossil Energy have begun to address this issue rigorously.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1189"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1189</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">Understanding the scale at which certain CCS technology platforms outperform others is also critical. The DOE goal of $40 per tonne of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> captured is formulated around a plant that is sized to produce 550 MW of net power generation, which is on the larger size of most point source generators of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Indeed, over half of the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from coal fired power generation in the U.S. is produced by power plants smaller than 550 MW, with normalised CCS capital costs that can triple compared to those required for the baseline 550 MW plant. The implication is that achieving the DOE goal of $40 per tonne will become exponentially more difficult at smaller plant sizes.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">At large scales, the need for thermodynamic performance improvements will likely dominate, because economies of scale are healthy. Still, process intensification strategies will almost certainly be required to shrink equipment sizes or collapse some of the larger, single-purpose unit operations into more multi-purpose unit operations that require less material and space for similar performance. However, as point source sizes become one to two orders of magnitude smaller, economies of scale disappear and the cost to capture a unit mass of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> increases dramatically. At those smaller scales, adequately reducing capital costs will likely require a dramatic shift in paradigm to uncover cost effective solutions. Advanced, mass manufacturing strategies will likely be required to generate low capital cost solutions for small scale, modular CCS. Furthermore, the degree to which cost savings can be realised will almost certainly depend on technology platform. Regardless of platform, and in contrast to larger scales, cost savings at smaller sizes are likely to come at the expense of thermodynamic performance. Whether process intensification, mass manufacturing, advanced manufacturing or a combination of all three are employed to reduce cost, a firm understanding of which technology platform will be most cost effective at each scale after optimisation is first required. An important counterfactual in this context is that, for some hard to reach point sources, it may be preferable to simply off-set these emissions <span class="italic">via</span> the use of negative emission or greenhouse gas removal (GGR) technologies.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In tandem with the stated need to reduce cost and energy penalties of CCS, simultaneous performance improvements in power generation itself are also critical as they reduce the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> liberated to satisfy a given power demand in the first place. However, the opportunity for improvements in the power generation efficiency of an existing facility is extremely limited without a major repowering effort. This requires a shift in perspective to greenfield designs. To reveal where the most opportunity for improvements in power generation improvements exist, one can extend the exergy analysis used to generate the thermodynamically infeasible region associated with CCS in <a title="Select to navigate to figure" href="#imgfig31">Fig. 31</a> to the remainder of the subsystems in a Pulverised Coal (PC) plant with CCS.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The methodology for exergy analysis in McGlashan and Marquis<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1185"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1185</span></sup></a> was used to calculate the work lost due to thermodynamic non-idealities in each subsystem of the power plant. In identifying the sources of these non-idealities, one also identifies areas with the most room for improvement. A typical analysis will reveal that for an average PC power plant equipped with amine based CCS, the ordered priority for improvements above the base PC plant is as follows:</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(1) Fuel chemical energy transfer (50–60% loss of theoretically ideal work)</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(2) Steam turbine (∼10% loss)</p>
        <p class="otherpara">(3) CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture and compression (5–10% loss)</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Of particular interest is that operating the CCS system results in less of a power penalty than sources of thermodynamic inefficiency elsewhere in the plant. The transfer of coal combustion heat to the steam cycle by far exhibits the largest losses, due primarily to the large temperature difference in the associated heat exchange process. The steam turbine is the next largest source of lost work. The lost work associated with these two processes in the standard coal based power generation platform process suggests the best opportunity to decrease lost work of low carbon power generation (<span class="italic">i.e.</span>, to increase power generation efficiency) is to first improve the base power generation technology platform, rather than to increase the efficiency of the CCS process.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Indeed, there is great opportunity in greenfield plant designs to integrate advanced power generation with CCS in manners that render CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation more inherent (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, Chemical Looping, Fuel Cells) or that have higher driving forces for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> separation &amp; compression (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, IGCC, Pressurised Oxycombustion). Nevertheless, in addition to offsetting CCS penalties with high efficiency power generation platforms, improving the CCS processes not completely inherent in power generation remains critical. Most work to date focuses on CCS processes that extract CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from a flue gas or syngas already generated by the power generation process, and are in that context largely independent of power generation platform. Transformational, low carbon fossil power generation will need to simultaneously generate power and concentrated CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> more efficiently. As a result, the current sequential, or even semi-integrated, approaches to CCS are likely to become obsolete in the long term.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In the near term, where applications for CCS to be retrofit abound, developers should continue to preserve the currently projected thermodynamic improvements to CCS. However, kinetic improvements including heat and mass transfer as well as precisely controlled reaction/separation networks should garner more attention to decrease overall equipment size. Furthermore, as most state of the art CCS systems are sequential and/or only semi integrated, there is great untapped potential to apply concepts of process intensification to even near-term CCS designs. The intent here is to transcend the limitations of conventional, generalised equipment designs to produce geometries and configurations for new equipment that are highly specific to and efficient for CCS application. While an increase in equipment complexity has often resulted in an increase in cost, we again mention that the impending revolution in advanced manufacturing has the potential to cost effectively bring this designer equipment to market.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In the long term, as retirement of existing PC plant designs increases, the need to replace them with advanced baseline fossil power generation platforms like those mentioned above will increase. At this point, the power generation industry will need to implement a new paradigm of CCS; one where the line separating power generation from CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture is significantly blurred.</p>

        <h3 id="sect6175"><span class="b_heading">16.1 IAMs and negative emissions</span></h3>
        <span>In the context of meeting the climate change commitments of limiting warming to less than 2 °C, most integrated assessment models (IAMs) cannot find a solution without carbon capture and storage (CCS). In other words, CCS is not just vital to the cost-optimal solution, it is vital to the solution, period. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios associated with a more than even chance of achieving the 2 °C target are characterised by average capture rates of 10 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year in 2050, 25 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year in 2100 and cumulative storage of 800–3000 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> by the end of the century.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Further, IAMs do not find a decreasing role for CCS over time. On the contrary, the CCS share in primary energy is mostly higher in the second half of the century compared to the first. This undermines the reputation of CCS as a bridging technology and further underlines its importance in IAMs, which seek to achieve ambitious climate targets. In other words, CCS is likely to be important for the long term.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The more stringent our climate targets, the more important bioenergy with CCS (BECCS), and other negative emissions technologies (NETs), become. In 2100, it is more likely than not that BECCS will provide more than 5% of total global primary energy. For a 1.5 °C scenario, the cumulative negative emissions are between 450 and 1000 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> until 2100. This is in stark contrast to some 2 °C scenarios, which do manage to reach their target without carbon removal technologies. Thus, in the context of meeting a 1.5 °C target, all the evidence points to an overshoot in temperature, which will need to be brought back under control <span class="italic">via</span> NETs. There are no feasible scenarios which do not involve NETs. Importantly, in addition to removing CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the atmosphere, NETS allow the offsetting of emissions from hard-to-reach areas, like shipping or aviation. Importantly, the dominance of BECCS may well be a function of the lack of other options within IAMs, and therefore incorporating other NETs in IAMs is a priority. Of the range of potential NETs, BECCS and direct air capture (DAC) are two that are of potential significance.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">BECCS is currently industrially deployed, with five plants operating worldwide. The technical maturity and costs of BECCS are comparable to conventional Fossil-CCS technologies, with BECCS costs typically estimated to be on the order of half that of direct air capture.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The technical potential for BECCS pathways is estimated to be in the range of 3–20 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the resource requirement to deliver BECCS is case-specific. Between 380–700 Mha of land may be required by 2100, and depending on the choices made throughout the biomass supply chain, capturing 12 Gt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year would require between 130–860 EJ. Land availability for biomass feedstock production is a key driver for large-scale BECCS implementation. Land demand for BECCS largely depends on the selected feedstock.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">It is finally important to note that the large-scale deployment of BECCS is contingent on first having access to a mature CCS industry. Given the challenges associated with delivering CCS, the additional challenges of securing sufficient sustainably sourced biomass and the policy questions around incentivising and regulating negative emissions facilities would render attempting large-scale BECCS in the absence of a mature CCS industry exceptionally challenging.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The direct capture of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> from the air is possible, but technically and economically challenging, primarily as a result of the extremely dilute nature of atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Owing to the low concentration of atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, costs of DAC are likely to be very substantial, and perhaps as much as two orders of magnitude greater than CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture from power plant exhaust gases. However, at the time of writing, a DAC facility is operating on a commercial basis in Switzerland, and is selling the captured CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> for utilisation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> However, given that the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is not geologically stored, this does not constitute a negative emissions project.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">One key way in which the dilute nature of atmospheric CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> affects process design is the required affinity of the sorbent for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> – this would need to be as much as two orders of magnitude greater than is the case for “standard” capture with chemical solvents such as amines. This in turn makes sorbent regeneration that much more challenging and necessitates a chemical shift process as opposed to a simple temperature or pressure swing. DAC costs are likely to be dominated by the requirement to treat vast volumes of air in order to capture a meaningful amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, with the capture of 1 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year necessitating the processing of 80<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 m<small><sup>3</sup></small> s<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of air. The actual cost of DAC is likely to be in the range of $600–1000 per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small>. In order to have a realistic assessment of the likely utility of DAC, transparent and realistic estimates of the cost of this technology are urgently required. Given the present level of uncertainty, rational decision making or inclusion in IAMs is nigh impossible.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect6216"><span class="b_heading">16.2 Industrial CCS</span></h3>
        <span>In addition to decarbonising the power sector, CCS also plays an important role in decarbonising the industry sector. Decarbonising the industrial sector presents a unique set of challenges, in that there are no obvious alternatives to CCS (<span class="italic">cf.</span> renewable energy in the power sector) and the international nature of industry. Particularly important industrial sectors are iron and steel, cement, and oil refining, with large integrated mills, for example, emitting 3.5 Mt<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per year, on the order of 1.8 t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per t<small><sub>steel</sub></small>. Cement production is also a carbon intense activity, with a carbon intensity in the range of 0.6–1.0 t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> per t<small><sub>cement</sub></small>, with approximately 60% of this CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> associated with the calcination step, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, even if the energy required to operate the process was entirely zero carbon, this would only reduce the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> intensity by 40%.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Decarbonisation of cement production <span class="italic">via</span> amine scrubbing has been observed to be ∼3 times more energy intense than oxy-firing and the demonstration of full oxy-fired cement production has been identified as a priority for future research, though Calcium looping is another important technology. In the context of industrial decarbonisation, industrial symbiosis, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, recovering waste heat from neighbouring facilities, has been observed to be key to cost reduction. Owing to their unique skill sets, the application of CCS to any industrial sector is likely to involve the petrochemical industry. Moreover, when it comes to decarbonising the refining sector, this cost is well within the large swings in oil price. Put another way, the end-use sectors can easily afford to pay for decarbonising this sector. However, relative to the power sector, there is a paucity of academic studies of industrial carbon capture, despite the fact that much of the real-world deployment is happening in the industrial sector. This is therefore an area that warrants further research.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect6235"><span class="b_heading">16.3 Technology development</span></h3>
        <span>The rate at which new materials progress from the lab- or bench-scale to the pilot-scale is too slow. It is critical that this rate be increased. One potential impediment is that the current sorbent benchmark is still 30 wt% MEA, which was originally proposed in 1930. However, this option is now significantly outclassed by blends of solvents, such as the formulation of piperazine (PZ) and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP). It is time to update this benchmark, preferably with reference to current industrial best practice. The fact that new materials continue to be compared with an obsolete benchmark is potentially limiting progress in this area. Efforts should also be made to ensure that laboratory-scale work investigates materials under conditions somewhat representative of the real world-high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> partial pressure for desorption, and eventually including the presence of steam and trace and minor species.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Ionic liquids (ILs) have shown some promise as next-generation CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture solvents, mainly through their highly desirable stability and low volatility, combined with reasonable absorption capacity. However, there are issues with poor gas uptake kinetics, stemming from high viscosity. Also, the high molar mass of most ILs dictates that, even with high molar CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capacities, the mass uptake rate remains inferior to aqueous alkanolamines, particularly at low pressures. It would seem prudent for future research to focus on reducing the molar mass and viscosity of functionalised ILs. By employing functionalised ions (azolate, phenolate, amino acid) there remains the possibility of increased capacity without necessitating higher cost. If future designs can take into consideration cost aspects in combination with reduced capture energy and higher capacity, there could be justification for the use of these novel solvents.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) are a promising class of sorbent materials. However, they are not typically manufactured at large scale, and for those that are, they are typically supplied as a powder rather than a structured adsorbent. Developing an understanding of the large-scale production of MOFs in a form suitable for practical application is key to moving these materials forward towards industrial deployment.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">There are an immense number of possible materials which could be used for CCS – testing them all at pilot scale is not practicable. The development of high throughput modelling and simulation approaches which combine molecular- and process-scale information for material screening is therefore vital. Importantly, data describing mass transfer resistance and diffusion limitations are required to enable this, but are particularly scarce.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transport remains an over-designed element of the CCS chain, owing to uncertainties around material selection and process operation. A better understanding of the role of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> composition in fracture propagation is vital for derisking this element of this technology. Importantly, if purity constraints can be relaxed, this can lead to non-negligible reductions in whole-system cost.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">When assessing an improvement in CCS technology, it is important to recall that whilst the CCS community want to reduce the cost of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> capture, the owner of the facility from which the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> must be captured prioritise minimising the cost of their low carbon product. This is especially true of the power sector where they are operating to meet a fixed, and largely inflexible, demand.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">With existing technologies, the majority of “CCS costs” are, in fact, associated with increases in capital cost, as opposed to operating cost. This implies that whilst a continued focus on improving thermodynamic performance is helpful, priority must be given to research which promises reduced capital costs.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">In this context, in addition to improving the CCS process, the value of improving the underlying process, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the power plant is also vital. From a thermodynamic perspective, 50–60% of theoretical losses occur in the conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy. By comparison, CCS is only 5–10% (except for the cases of high temperature cycles, which integrate the capture efficiency loss into the lost work from the conversion of heat to work, and are therefore more efficient). Moreover, as the power plant increases in efficiency, less CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> is produced per MWh thus reducing the cost of the starting point. Thus, where new facilities are built, the deployment of state-of-the-art facilities should be a given.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Thus, R&amp;D initiatives aimed at “improving” CCS should take a whole systems approach and focus on reducing the cost per unit of decarbonised product (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, steel, cement, power), and how this decarbonised process will, itself, compete in the market, <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, what will displace what. This may well be distinct from focusing exclusively on minimising the cost of capturing the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect6259"><span class="b_heading">16.4 CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage</span></h3>
        <span>In the past 5 years, great progress has been made in the area of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage. Outstanding challenges in the area of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage monitoring and verification include the development of technologies to allow for the quantification of the amount of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> stored and plume migration. Approaches for obtaining quantitative insight into the extent to which CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> has partitioned into the aqueous phase, or has become residually trapped are also a key research priority. Leak detection and remediation remain key areas for research, hampered by the lack of analogue in the petroleum industry.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A final key area for urgent research is the development of better understanding of regional CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage capacity, how it changes with use and how this capacity might evolve over time. Indeed, the lack of such insight is a key hurdle to a better representation of CCS in IPCC-type assessments.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect6270"><span class="b_heading">16.5 CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> conversion and utilisation (CCU)</span></h3>
        <span>There is a common narrative that CCU can enable CCS. In the US, where the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transport and storage infrastructure is available and largely written off, this may be true in the case of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> enhanced oil recovery (CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR). In this context, the potential of residual oil zones (ROZs) is significant owing to their likely high CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> injected to oil recovered ratios. Thus, in the US, the primary objective is driving down the $ per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> cost so that CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR, combined with the existing tax credit scheme, represents an attractive investment in an era of relatively low oil prices.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">In other parts of the world, like the UK or EU, the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> transport and storage infrastructure does not exist at the same scale, nor is there a sufficient investment incentive to induce its deployment (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, EOR may not be an option). Thus, in these regions, the key barriers are the lack of infrastructure, with the cost of capture a secondary barrier. Consequently, the UK/EU region would be better advised to focus on deploying transport and storage infrastructure and derisking that element of the investment. Innovations to reduce the $ per t<small><sub>CO<small><sub>2</sub></small></sub></small> cost of capture will continue to come from the global academic community, and can be imported on an as-needed basis. Infrastructure cannot, however CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR can potentially enable the deployment of CCS infrastructure. However, the extent to which CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR will actually store CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> strongly depends on the way in which the EOR operation is managed, and also on the kind of oil which is recovered. It is important, therefore, to carry out thorough life cycle analyses, both attributional and consequential, in order to develop this kind of insight.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The magnitude of the role that CCU might play in climate change mitigation is likely to be very small, relative to that played by CCS. However, CCU might offer very cost efficient options for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> mitigation, even yielding a profit in some cases. One option which might be deployable at scale is the conversion of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to a fuel product (<span class="italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="italic">via</span> Fischer–Tropsch processes). However, this requires major progress in catalysis and process design, additionally this route does not store CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> long-term but would offer carbon-neutral fuels in a best case future scenario. The primary source of cost in CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> to fuels processes is that of hydrogen, with the cost of CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> coming second. Thus, in order to move CCU forwards, a key area for research is the development of reduced cost approaches for producing renewable hydrogen. Another key constraint is that, in order to avoid partial decarbonisation scenarios, the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> used must (a) ideally not come from a fossil source, and (b) be recaptured after the, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-fuel is used. This will have the effect of enabling CCU to be a key element of a coherent circular economy narrative.</p>
      
      
        
        <h3 id="sect6301"><span class="b_heading">16.6 Policy considerations</span></h3>
        <span>Current and medium-term UK and EU decarbonisation targets are expressed in terms of a percentage of renewable energy. This is essentially confusing ends (sustainable, affordable and reliable energy) with means (deployment of specific technologies) and is distinct to a technology-agnostic aim of deploying low carbon electricity. As a consequence, the deployment of CCS is disadvantaged from a policy perspective. Better would be to define low carbon energy, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, 50 g kWh<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, and replace renewables targets with low carbon targets, <span class="italic">e.g.</span>, <span class="italic">x</span>% of power to come from low carbon targets by a given date. This would allow individual states the flexibility to realise these goals in a locally optimal manner.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">It is vital to recognise that, as we move to a more diverse energy system, not all power generation technologies provide the same services to the system, and thus attempting to value them on a basis of levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) is, at best, misguided. Better to evaluate the value of each technology to the energy system on an individual basis, noting that this value varies with the composition of the system. In this context, CCS, nuclear and bioenergy are notable for their ability to significantly reduce CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> emissions at a marginal increase in total system cost. Thus, these technologies must compete amongst themselves. In other words; CCS and intermittent renewable energy generators are not competing to provide the same set of services.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">It is evident that, despite substantial public and private effort to commercialise and deploy CCS technology, progress is lagging behind what is commonly considered to be required to meet climate targets. This is despite ample evidence that CCS will both reduce whole-system energy costs, and thus the cost to the consumer and also create a significant number of jobs.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">One key issue with the CCS commercialisation models that have been followed thus far is that the private sector should manage all of the technical and commercial integration risks across the full CCS chain (capture, transport and storage). Whilst the private sector can manage and competitively price many risks, there is a lack of proven models for commercialising CCS (distinct to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small>-EOR industry, which is much more straightforward). This lack of a proven commercial model across the full chain, means that the market will either only accept at a premium, or not accept, whatever the price.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The key commercial risks that require public support are (i) cross chain default, (ii) post decommissioning CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage risk, (iii) CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage performance risks, (iv) decommissioning cost and financial securities related to the CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> storage permit, and finally (v) insurance market limitations for CO<small><sub>2</sub></small> T&amp;S operations. A commercial model that entails a transfer of risks iii–v categories to the public sector will both remove the key barriers that have thus far prevented the private sector from investing in CCS and also improve financeability and consequently significantly reduce the risk premium added to the cost of capital funding. This model is in line with what was suggested by the 2016 Oxburgh Report.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a></p>
        <p class="otherpara">However, it is not necessary to have public ownership of the generation and capture assets, and with the transfer of the aforementioned risks iii-v to the public sector, the private sector can likely deliver CCS without any change to existing regulation. This latter element is particularly important; wherever possible initiatives should ideally fall within existing regulatory frameworks.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Whilst the technical elements of CCS are well-understood, and, as has been discussed in this paper, the financial models are becoming increasingly clear, public acceptability and the consequent impact on the political economy are as yet at an embryonic stage. This is despite substantial evidence of the economy-wide GDP and employment benefits associated with the deployment of CCS.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">It is misleading to describe the problems with CCS commercialisation as primarily one of cost. Some low-carbon technologies such as offshore wind receive generous subsidies of the scale that would be needed for CCS. Other technologies such as nuclear power have existed for over sixty years and yet, some governments still willingly provide large subsidies. Uniquely for CCS, the political economy has proven to be more problematic than anticipated. Unlike nuclear power or onshore wind, there are no strong opponents, but neither are there advocates willing to lobby strongly. If there were to be unambiguous, serious political commitment to meeting a 2 °C target, then all large energy firms would eagerly lobby for CCS, but for most (and many politicians), their preferred alternative is continued unabated fossil fuel use.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Ultimately, CCS provides a litmus test for how serious governments take the challenge of deep decarbonisation. If there is a genuine effort to meet ambitious climate targets then, if the many analyses are correct, the needed shifts in incentives and regulations will mean change in the interests (and the economics) and large-scale deployment CCS will eventually follow.</p>
