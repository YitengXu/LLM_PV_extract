      <h2 id="sect454"><span class="a_heading">1 Introduction</span></h2>
      <span>This is the latest review covering the topic of advances in the analysis of metals, chemicals and materials. It follows on from last year’s review<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit1"><sup><span class="sup_ref">1</span></sup></a> and is part of the Atomic Spectrometry Updates series.<a title="Select to navigate to reference" href="#cit2"><sup><span class="sup_ref">2–6</span></sup></a></span>
      <p class="otherpara">The ever-expanding repertoire of LIBS analysis has continued in this review period. Its on-line/<span class="italic">in situ</span>/standoff abilities continues to make it an attractive proposition in many areas. Research in the metals industry has used it for several years, but it has been plagued by the fact that calibration can be problematic. Methods to improve the accuracy of calibration have continued and many different models have been produced. In this review period, this has been especially true for non-ferrous metals, where it may be used during manufacture or during the re-cycling of scrap. It has also found use for sorting different polymers during re-cycling, estimating the calorific values of coal, and use in the cultural heritage sector. The standoff ability of LIBS has also found significant use for nuclear applications. The drive to expand the number of radionuclides measurable to contribute to safe, cost-effective decommissioning continues. To this end, several reports of new techniques were developed. The analysis of fuels has continued to be of great interest, although, somewhat surprisingly, the analysis of alternative fuels has received less attraction during this review period. The analysis of cultural heritage artifacts has also received huge interest. Since these samples are precious, the majority of these applications use non-destructive or minimally destructive methods of analysis. Therefore X-ray-based techniques, LIBS or laser ablation sample introduction feature heavily. Often, these are used in combination with one or more chemometric techniques to try and elucidate manufacturing processes, provenance <span class="italic">etc.</span> Similar strategies are often adopted for the forensic analysis of materials, where sample destruction should be avoided and chemometric methods may aid classification/identification. The analysis of electronic components, wafers, thin films and solar cells often makes use of surface analysis tools such as SIMS, TOF-SIMS and assorted X-ray-based techniques. Some of the X-ray techniques, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> XPS and XANES give information on the chemical surroundings or speciation of the analyte whereas others give bulk surface concentrations. Other techniques may be used for depth-profiling studies, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> LA, LIBS or SIMS. The requirement for better resolution (both lateral and depth) is driving the research for depth profiling/surface analysis techniques. The analysis of nanostructures has also matured, with fundamental studies of nanoparticle sizing being fewer in number than previous years. Instead, a large number of reviews have covered varying aspects of nanostructure analysis. Other papers have concentrated on improving figures of merit and validating existing procedures. The number of application-based papers for nanomaterials has increased markedly. This indicative of the methodology developed and reported over the last few years reaching maturity.</p>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect465"><span class="b_heading">1.1 Reviews of instrumental techniques</span></h3>
        <span>A brief section has been provided in this year’s review because several review pieces have been published that cover numerous topic areas. It was therefore deemed sensible to cover these in this one section rather than writing about them all in four or five different sections. Other, more focused reviews, are given in the relevant individual sections.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The majority of the <span class="italic">review papers covering general industrial applications have discussed the use of laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS)</span>. The use of LIBS has certainly increased significantly over the last five years. This is because of its ability for rapid and cheap analysis as well as its potential for on-line use at manufacturing plants. It is certainly a money saver for industry if their product can be analysed as it is made rather than collecting a sub-sample and then having it analysed off-line in a laboratory. Alterations to the product recipe can be made in real-time, saving time and expense. The stand-off ability of LIBS also offers numerous advantages where dangerous or unpleasant conditions occur. Examples include the nuclear industry where the use of LIBS enables analysis of components from a safe distance for the operators. Similarly, it may prevent the need for a reactor shutdown so that sample can be collected for laboratory analysis. The standoff analysis of potential explosive devices also has clear beneficial health implications. Despite its many obvious advantages, LIBS does have a couple of drawbacks. It is not completely sample non-destructive, but its main drawback is that it can be very difficult to use quantitatively. This is because the sensitivity of analysis can be affected by numerous parameters, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the matrix, temperature, pressure, the atmospheric medium, <span class="italic">etc.</span> Numerous research papers have been published over the years describing assorted different calibration strategies. These have been summarised in a review with 93 references presented by Costa <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit7"><sup><span class="sup_ref">7</span></sup></a> It covered methods such as matrix matched calibration, internal standardization, standard additions, multi-energy calibration, one-point gravimetric standard addition, one point multi-line calibration, slope ratio calibration, two point calibration transfer, single sample calibration, multiple linear regression, principal component regression (PGR), partial least squares and artificial neural network. Examples of each were given and the advantages, disadvantages and limitations of each discussed. A review by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> (with 70 references) covered the use of machine learning algorithms as a method for overcoming calibration problems and for gleaning the maximum amount of information from the data.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit8"><sup><span class="sup_ref">8</span></sup></a> Other review papers covering LIBS were prepared by Guo <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit9"><sup><span class="sup_ref">9</span></sup></a> which contained 210 references and covered developments in the application of LIBS in recent years and another by Senesi <span class="italic">et al.</span> who discussed field portable LIBS, giving a historical review, current status and future prospects (118 references).<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit10"><sup><span class="sup_ref">10</span></sup></a> In the latter review, two types of instrument were compared: hand-held instruments and those that are modular and joined by an umbilical. The performance of both was also compared with portable XRF. The industrial applications of LIBS were reviewed (with 190 references) by Legnaioli <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit11"><sup><span class="sup_ref">11</span></sup></a> The subject areas covered in particular were applications in the steel and coal industries. Also covered was LIBS applications in the re-cycling industry, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> of plastics for recycling. A further review, of remote analysis LIBS, was presented by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit12"><sup><span class="sup_ref">12</span></sup></a> The review covered 123 references and concentrated on methods of signal enhancement, its use in a variety of fields and some of the problems encountered. A review of methods and applications of LIBS containing 230 references was published by Shah <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit13"><sup><span class="sup_ref">13</span></sup></a> In one section, the sensitivity, speed of analysis, accuracy and sample preparation methodology were compared with other techniques. A second part focussed on the instrumentation used and the third part on quantitative and qualitative analysis. Different analysis parameters and their effects as well as the fields of application were also discussed. A final review of LIBS analysis covering its use for mapping studies of samples was prepared by Limbeck <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit14"><sup><span class="sup_ref">14</span></sup></a> This review cited 188 references and covered sample types such as cultural heritage samples, thin films, catalysts, biological materials and concrete. The review was split into instrumentation types (different lasers, spectrometers, collection optics <span class="italic">etc.</span>), sub-sections for assorted chemometric data handling methods and calibration. Overall, it is a good read for a novice just starting in the area.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The related technique of <span class="italic">laser ablation assisted spark induced breakdown spectrometry</span> (LA-SIBS) and its applications was reviewed (with 42 references) by Zhou <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit15"><sup><span class="sup_ref">15</span></sup></a> This methodology also needs no sample preparation and hence, is quick and likely to gain in popularity. The fundamentals were described in the review, which also covered applications – especially those involving conducting materials.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">Synchrotron-based X-ray techniques</span> are known to have several advantages over some techniques because they have a high intensity, monochromatic and collimated beam. The use of techniques such as small/wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD) and different methods of X-ray imaging were reviewed (with 131 references) by Rahimabadi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit16"><sup><span class="sup_ref">16</span></sup></a> Each technique was discussed in its own sub-section with both theory and applications being present.</p>
      
    
    
      
      <h2 id="sect499"><span class="a_heading">2 Metals</span></h2>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect502"><span class="b_heading">2.1 Ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>This has been an even more active area of research that in previous years. There has, however, been a change of emphasis. In previous years, a lot of the research was based on the calibration of laser induced breakdown spectrometry (LIBS) or on methods to minimise interferences during LIBS analysis. This review period still has a high number of LIBS-based applications, but these are more application-based and include several papers describing other techniques used. It should be noted that those applications describing the analysis of cultural heritage samples can now be found in Section 5.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">One of the advantages of LIBS is that it can be portable and can hence be taken to the field or production site. This helps speed of the analysis since samples do not have to be returned to a laboratory. There have therefore been several <span class="italic">applications reported of the LIBS analysis of steel at the production line</span>. An example of this was a paper entitled “feasibility investigation for on-line elemental monitoring of iron and steel manufacturing processes using LIBS”, published by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit17"><sup><span class="sup_ref">17</span></sup></a> The paper studied the effects of different sample temperatures, lens to target distance and the angle of analysis. The Q-switched Nd:YAG laser operating conditions and the spectrometer used were discussed in detail with the aid of a schematic diagram and the method validated by the use of numerous standard steel samples. The sample temperature effects were studied by undertaking analysis at room temperature, 300, 500 and 700 °C. The emission intensity increased with increasing temperature. This was attributed to lower laser energy being required for sample ablation and vaporization meaning that more can be used for plasma evolution processes to enhance the plasma emission intensity. Similarly, the ablation and vaporization of sample also increased causing the increase of plasma emission intensity. Consequently, the emission intensity of measured spectra at higher sample temperature is higher than that at lower sample temperature. This study therefore indicated that calibration of the LIBS system was sample temperature dependent. Although this finding is not completely unexpected, it does highlight the potential pitfalls of simply using an instrument and assuming correct answers will be produced. Lens to target distance was varied between 3.5 and 4.1 m, with 3.9 providing highest intensity. Spectra obtained using different sample angles of 0°, 15°, 30° and 75° were obtained with results indicating that an increased sample angle (meaning the sample surface was far away from the vertical direction of laser beam), led to the signal intensity decreasing. A 3D profile measurement system was also described in the paper. A paper by Zeng <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the production of a prototype instrument capable of the rapid on-line analysis of steels through the use of a mobile fiber optic LIBS system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit18"><sup><span class="sup_ref">18</span></sup></a> A schematic of the prototype instrument was provided to aid the reader. Numerous standard steel samples were used for calibration purposes, including the six carbon steels (GBW01211–GBW01216), seven standard samples of microalloy steel (GSB 03-2453-2008-1 to GSB 03-2453-2008-7) and 11 samples of low alloy steel purchased from NIST. A polynomial fitting was required to obtain the best calibration functions for the analytes Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni and V, since linear fitting led, in some cases, to poor regression coefficients (with 0.861 for Cu being the poorest). Once polynomial fitting was used, regression coefficients of the calibration curves improved to greater than 0.99. Average absolute errors of Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni and V were 0.440, 0.003, 0.039, 0.07, 0.033 and 0.057 wt%, respectively. Their average relative errors fluctuated from 2.9% to 15.7%. The instrument provided LOD at the mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> level, with the best being 31 (for Cr) and worst being 290 (for Mo). As mentioned previously, the production of instruments capable of working on-line or in-line provide a huge benefit in terms of time- and cost-saving since samples do not have to be returned to the laboratory for analysis. Once they are reliable and easy to use, even relatively untrained workers may use them successfully.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An application was reported by Lednev <span class="italic">et al.</span> in which LIBS was used <span class="italic">on-line to detect defective laser welding</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit19"><sup><span class="sup_ref">19</span></sup></a> A description of the system was provided along with schematic diagrams and a photograph. Briefly, the diode pumped pulsed solid state Nd:YAG laser (1064 nm, 5 ns, 130 mJ per pulse, 10 Hz, <span class="italic">M</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> = 90) beam was focused by quartz lens (<span class="italic">F</span> = 280 mm) through a pierced aluminium mirror at a 45° angle to the sample surface. Analysis of the melt pool enabled both atomic and ionic lines for major components (Cr, Fe or Ni) to be compared as well as lines for alloying elements (Mn, Si). The spectral region from 275 to 290 nm enabled this to be undertaken. If the melt pool becomes too hot, then this results in a defective weld. By measuring the intensity of the atomic Fe 278.81 nm and ionic Fe 274.67 nm iron lines signals as well as their ratio, it was possible to use hypothesis testing by paired sample <span class="italic">t</span>-test to identify defects. Two other sensing procedures were attempted. These were: thermal emission spectroscopy of the welding melt pool induced by a continuous wave laser (passive sensing) and LIBS analysis of a solidified hot weld. Both of these methods failed to detect defects. Another paper to use LIBS for the analysis of welds was presented by Taparli <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used it for the <span class="italic">in situ</span> chemical composition analysis of tungsten inert gas (TIG) austenitic stainless steel welds.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit20"><sup><span class="sup_ref">20</span></sup></a> These authors used a similar setup to that of Lednev <span class="italic">et al.</span>, but employed an analysis angle of 20° rather than 45°. The Mn signal was enhanced during the welding process. This was attributed to Mn vapour forming over the weld pool and then on-cooling, it re-condenses and forms a layer on the surface of the weld. As well as the on-line LIBS, the authors also used LIBS to study the effects of differing welding currents, finding that local increases in Mn and Ni concentration occurred at higher current. Again, this was attributed to higher Mn concentrations entering the vapour phase, later to re-condense on the surface. The advantages of these systems is that they can detect faults in real time, enabling corrective action to be undertaken and hence decreasing the number of failures.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another paper that discussed LIBS measurements was presented by Petersson <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used the technique for the <span class="italic">rapid analysis of steel slag</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit21"><sup><span class="sup_ref">21</span></sup></a> The experimental setup was described in detail and entailed a YAG laser operating at 10 Hz and with a pulse energy of 300 mJ at a wavelength of 1064 nm. Also incorporated into the experimental setup was a spherical aluminium mirror in a near-colinear configuration to collect the light emitted, a CCD detector and a rotating sample holder to ensure that data could be averaged from a sufficiently high number of laser shots covering a large area of sample. This last attribute was necessary because of the inhomogeneous nature of the slag samples. Averaging of several hundred laser pulses was required to obtain a good overall estimate of bulk composition. A large number of samples were also analysed using XRF and the concentration data from these helped calibration of the LIBS system. Samples analysed using XRF were also used for a comparison of data between the two techniques, with good agreement being obtained. Despite the large number of laser shots used, precision for the LIBS system was still 2–4 times worse than that from XRF. However, it was concluded that they were still adequate for on-line or near the line applications and, with further optimization, could potentially be improved. These authors also indicated that slag at 1200 °C gave a very different LIBS intensity response to that from cold slag. Further work was required to develop “transfer functions” from room temperature calibrations to those at elevated temperature.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The concept of <span class="italic">transfer learning that enables LIBS calibration obtained at room temperature to be transferred to analysis at elevated temperature</span> was also addressed by Chang <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit22"><sup><span class="sup_ref">22</span></sup></a> Spectral data of calibration samples obtained at room temperature (12 CRMs) and spectral data of uncalibrated samples (8 samples) at high temperature were transferred to a high dimensional feature space using kernel function mapping. One in this space a model is trained and established. Results for Cr indicated that the use of the feature-based transfer learning method decreased the mean relative error from 32.31% to only 6.08%.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper by Lednev <span class="italic">et al.</span> investigated the feasibility of using on-line LIBS for <span class="italic">the analysis of compositionally graded alloy parts during their fabrication</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit23"><sup><span class="sup_ref">23</span></sup></a> Chromium bronze and stainless steel 410 powders were deposited using laser cladding, forming a metal part with a compositional gradient. The LIBS measurements were undertaken on the melt pool, the finished material as well as the powder starter materials. Results produced from the melt pool and the finished product were comparable because of a homogeneous mixture of analytes being present. However, very poor precision degraded the data from the start powders to the extent where it was concluded that the LIBS analysis could not be performed reliably. Despite this, the transition zone between two pure components was quantified using LIBS for the first time and so the experiment could be regarded as a success.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Some papers have used <span class="italic">chemometrics approaches to aid either the calibration of LIBS analysis of steels or to distinguish between different steel grades in a scrapyard</span>. The determination of C in steels can be problematic because the C line at 193.09 nm is in the vacuum UV region and light emission is easily absorbed, leading to a huge drop in sensitivity. Another C line (at 247.856 nm) is interfered with by Fe lines. Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> employed the chemometric method of least absolute shrinkage and selection operator for spectral feature selection in combination with back-propagation neural networks to correlate LIBS spectra with C concentration without explicitly measuring C spectral lines.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit24"><sup><span class="sup_ref">24</span></sup></a> This machine learning approach succeeded by first using 12 certified materials with a C content ranging from 0.013 to 3.73% and with a widely varying concentration of other metals to help train the calibration model. A further three CRMs were used to validate the method developed. The multivariate chemometrics approach was summarised nicely in a flow chart. Once optimized, the method had a LOD of 0.0366% and produced regression coefficients of 0.9999. Poggialini <span class="italic">et al.</span> used multiple artificial neural networks (ANN) to greatly improve the precision and accuracy of a commercial hand-held LIBS instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit25"><sup><span class="sup_ref">25</span></sup></a> The ANN algorithm links a set of inputs (the spectral intensities of some lines in the LIBS spectrum) to a set of outputs (the concentration of the elements of interest) through a non-linear relation that can be determined by minimizing the deviation between the predicted and nominal outputs on a set of known samples. The relation obtained between inputs and outputs is then used for obtaining the outputs associated with unknown samples from the measured inputs. Several ANN were prepared including: one for the major elements and one for minor elements. The performance with the calibration built into the instrument were compared in terms of linearity of calibration and relative mean standard error (RMSE). Performance with and without the ANN were comparable for standards/known samples, but the ANN assisted calibrations were significantly improved for unknown samples, with RMSE improving from 1.83 to 0.70% for Cr and from 2.98 to 0.62% for Ni. Kashiwakura and Wagatsuma developed a method using a LIBS system made in-house followed by partial least squares regression (PLSR) for the rapid determination of components of austenitic stainless steels.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit26"><sup><span class="sup_ref">26</span></sup></a> Eight CRMs of the JSM M 200 series (materials 21–28) were used to train the model for the analytes Cr, Mo, Nb, Ni and Ti. Spectral data could be obtained very rapidly (approx. 13 s), but more than 10 minutes was required for the calculation of regressions when all the relevant wavelengths were utilised. However, the calculation time could be reduced if single wavelengths that had higher excitation levels were chosen for each analyte. The method was applied to the analysis of five stainless steel types: SUS304, SUS310, SUS316, SUS321 and SUS347. The range of recovery rates were 94.3–111% and precision was better than 10% RSD. Another paper that determined C in both solid and molten steels was presented by Cui <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit27"><sup><span class="sup_ref">27</span></sup></a> These workers employed a UV long-short double pulse LIBS system that they both discussed in detail and provided a schematic diagram of. Six CRMs were used for calibration at room temperature and then one of them was heated to 1800 °C. Spectra were taken at three different periods after the melting process. After 0.5 min, a clear C peak was observable at 193.091 nm. However, this peak diminished significantly after 12 min and had disappeared completely after 15 min. This is a well known effect in the steel industry and is termed the carbon escape phenomenon. The influence of the presence of oxygen was studied and had a significant effect on the presence of C, with much of it boiling off as carbon dioxide. It was concluded that this was unavoidable in molten steel. In a second paper by the same research group, sample temperature effects were compared for both single pulse LIBS and colinear long-short double pulse LIBS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit28"><sup><span class="sup_ref">28</span></sup></a> The authors used the emission intensity ratio of Mn 404.136 nm/Fe 402.187 nm and the Fe 402.187 nm/Fe 400.524 nm for the comparison. The effect of the delay time between pulses was also studied. As would be expected, a temperature rise from 20 to 700 °C had a very adverse effect on accuracy of analysis when single pulse LIBS was used. This effect was very much diminished in the long-short pulse version. This was attributed to it maintaining a higher plasma temperature and for longer. An attempt to correct for plasma temperature using Fe 402.187 nm/Fe 400.524 nm resulted in a marginal improvement in precision from 22.56 to 21.86% RSD for the single pulse LIBS. However, the long-short double pulse LIBS provided a much improved precision of 6.46% anyway, which improved further to 1.78% once plasma temperature had been corrected for. Improvements to calibration are obviously welcome since it betters the chance of obtaining accurate data. These papers therefore add to the increasing volume of literature that will enable more accurate data to be provided by instruments in the future.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several other papers reporting the LIBS analysis of steels have been reported. In one, by Cai <span class="italic">et al.</span> a portable LIBS instrument built in-house was used <span class="italic">to study the aging of the heat resistant steel T91</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit29"><sup><span class="sup_ref">29</span></sup></a> The chemometric tools of wavelet threshold de-noising followed by multiple scattering correction were used to clean up the data. Then, both support vector machine (SVM) and <span class="italic">k</span>-fold support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (K-SVM-RFE) were used on the data from slices of pipe that had undergone different levels of aging to establish the model. This was then applied to artificial samples. The performance of the wavelet threshold de-noising and multiple scattering correction on the performance of the model were studied. Once optimized, the process was capable of determining the age of the material with an accuracy of 85.17%. Although clearly not perfect, it does give a very good indication of how old and hence, how likely to fail, a steel is.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Electrical steel (steels containing between 1.1 and 4% Si) is used for things such as electric motors, transformers, generators and high frequency convertors. It requires analysis to ensure that the correct grade is used for the right job. Silicon is known to be problematic to detect using LIBS because of self-absorption and matrix effects. A combination of <span class="italic">LIBS and laser induced molecular fluorescence was used by Zhang et al. to measure Si as the molecule SiO</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit30"><sup><span class="sup_ref">30</span></sup></a> The paper showed a convenient schematic of the experimental setup, which comprised two lasers one of which (a Nd:YAG operating at 1064 nm; pulse duration: 6 ns; beam diameter: 5 mm; repetition rate: 10 Hz; pulse energy: 60 mJ) was used to ablate the sample and the second (OPOTek, VIBRANT™ HE 355 LD; wavelength range: 225–2400 nm; pulse duration: 10 ns; operating at 10 Hz and 1 mJ) was used for SiO molecular excitation. An XYZ translation stage, collection optics and a Czerny–Turner spectrometer equipped with an intensified CCD were also part of the setup. Seven certified materials (GSB 03-2453-2008-1 to GSB 03-2453-2008-7, with Si contents of between 0.021 and 1.370%) were used as the samples. The atomic Si 288.16 nm line was interfered with by the ionic Fe 288.08 nm line at a low silicon content. This obviously greatly limited the analytical accuracy and sensitivity of LIBS for silicon in steels. Two types of molecular excitations were therefore evaluated: vibrational ground state excitation and vibrational excited state excitation. Both showed a huge improvement in Si detection capacity, with the excited state excitation (with detection of SiO at 248.68 nm) showing the best results of all. For that, regressions (<span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small>) were 0.988, the LOD was 187 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and the root-mean-square error of cross-validation (RMSECV) was 0.046%. The method is therefore a significant advance on other LIBS methods.</p>

A total of 15 reference materials were analysed including GBW01238, GBW01241, GBW01242, and GBW (E) 010224, which are all certified for total Al and acid soluble Al, were analysed. One laser pulse per spot was used for the analysis, with the excited region being 10 mm × 10 mm, and the distance between the centres of two adjacent spots being 250 μm. A total of 1681 sets of intensity data were obtained for each analysis. Several series of mathematical functions were derived enabling a relationship between intensity of light emitted and the particle size to be deduced. Results obtained using the method developed were compared with those obtained using SEM-EDS. According to the authors, general agreement was obtained, but there was still room for improvement. However, the inclusion content and particle sizes can be analysed simultaneously using LIBS, which therefore, offers a simple sample preparation and rapid analysis.</p>

One spectrometer had a wavelength range of 244–360 nm and the other 382–469 nm. The setup was shown in a schematic diagram. The inter relationship between the different parts of the unit were described. When the laser power was 0.044 W, a crater with an inner diameter of approximately 3 μm was achieved. After background correction of the spectra, a quadratic function was used to correlate the intensity and concentration of each of the eight analytes (Al, Cr, Cu, Mn, Nb, Ni, Ti and V). Regression coefficients of better than 0.99 were obtained for Al, Cu, Nb, Ni and V, whereas correlations for the other analytes were better than 0.95. Detection limits varied significantly, with Ti providing the lowest at 0.04%, despite the fact it produced the worst regression. The highest LOD (1.77%) was for Ni.</p>

These steps were: employing a standard normal variate procedure, applying a Savitzky–Golay smoothing procedure and then cutting the spectra into fragments to cover only the ranges required for the analytes. Once these steps had been performed, both univariate and multivariate (partial least square) calibration and validation protocols were tested. The predictive capability of each calibration model was evaluated by calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (<span class="italic">R</span>), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute prediction error (MAPE) and LODs, whereas the leave one out cross validation (LOO-CV) method was used to perform external validation. Correlation between LIBS and XRF data were plotted. The multivariate approach was significantly better than the univariate with <span class="italic">R</span><small><sup>2</sup></small> values of 0.93–0.99.

In addition, results obtained using alternative techniques, namely ICP-OES and ICP-MS following acid dissolution procedures, were also compared with those from GD-MS. Semiquantitative data were also obtained for some analytes. The agreement between semiquantitative GD-MS and ICP data was less impressive, with data for some analytes agreeing reasonably well whereas others differing by a factor of three.

        <h3 id="sect593"><span class="b_heading">2.2 Non-ferrous metals</span></h3>
        <span>Many of the overall themes for the analysis of non-ferrous materials are the same as for the ferrous ones, although the sample types are more diverse. Strangely, there are still a large number of papers reporting methods for LIBS calibration. The number of these were significantly diminished in the Ferrous section during this review period. Several papers discussed the use of chemometric methods to aid the calibration, assist with classification or undertake data pre-treatment or reduction. The use of chemometrics is still a very popular area of research for several reasons. Data reduction is required because LIBS can produce an enormous amount of data. Reducing this to the relevant wavelengths facilitates calculations and enables it to be accomplished with a more basic computer. Calibration is very dependent on matrix, temperature and pressure. For on-line analysis, chemometrics may be used to calculate correction factors or isolate data that are least affected by changes in operating conditions. The biggest advantage of LIBS over more traditional atomic spectrometric methods is that it (as well as portable XRF) may be used in the field. This has a particular advantage in the recycling of scrap, since different alloys may be identified rapidly, minimising the potential of cross-contamination and, in some cases, facilitating an estimate of worth to a customer. Portable LIBS instruments are available commercially. If the calibration models can be improved, then the accuracy of these instruments may be improved.</span>

Using laser energies of both 0.3 and 0.5 mJ, a linear increase in Cu signal at 521.82 nm was observed with increasing temperature, with the 0.5 mJ producing a greater emission intensity. A study of the electron number density and temperature was undertaken using the Boltzmann equation and Stark broadening. As the temperature of the sample increased, the electron temperature increased whereas the electron density decreased. It was concluded that an increased target temperature leads to improved resolution and sensitivity of femtosecond LIBS.</span>

            <span class="italic">Relative sensitivity factors for elements in a copper matrix</span> were also studied by Zhang <span class="italic">et al.</span> who compared continuous direct current glow discharge mass spectrometry and micro-second pulsed GD-MS for the analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit40"><sup><span class="sup_ref">40</span></sup></a> High purity copper powders (99.999%) were spiked with a solution containing 72 analytes and the relative sensitivity factors obtained using a high resolution double-focusing sector-field GD-MS instrument equipped with a Grimm-type fast-flow dc source. The precision was comparable to that of data obtained using ICP-MS and ICP-OES following a dissolution procedure. The GD-MS method therefore offered the clear advantages of time-saving and of not requiring the use of corrosive chemicals and the associated fume extraction. The technique had a limited linear range, with a regression of 0.9993 when additions of 1, 5 and 10 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small> were used, but this reduced to 0.9177 when the calibration was extended to 50 and 100 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.

Water is known to have quenching problems though and so operating conditions tend to be quite different to normal analyses. Both papers provided a schematic diagram of the setup.

An inter-pulse delay of 10 ns provided an absorption at 324.754 nm with a precision of 1.5% RSD, which increased to 5.3% RSD when the inter-pulse delay was increased to 30 ns. Precision at 327.396 nm was 2.7% and 3.3% for 10 and 30 ns inter-pulse delays, respectively. The reason for poorer precision at higher inter-pulse delay was that the amount of absorption decreased. Underwater LIBS can suffer from light transmission losses back through the fibre optic to the detector. This, when added to the quenching effect by the water has a deleterious effect on the sensitivity. The experiments undertaken in these experiments help optimise signal so that some of the losses can be minimised.</p>

The model was trained using one certified aluminium alloy and then tested on four others. Experimental results were in reasonable agreement with certified values, with averaged relative errors being: 0.065%, 19.45%, 11.97%, 13.03%, 9.77% and 7.81% for Al, Cr, Cu, Mg, Mn and Zn, respectively. The authors concluded that the method was a convenient, rapid and reliable way of determining both major and minor elements in the samples. The advantages of the system over LIBS systems include its fast speed of spectral data collection, cost-effectiveness and its low continuum background. The other paper used particle swarm optimization to narrow down the full dataset to those parts that give most reliable results and then combined this with extreme learning machine.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit44"><sup><span class="sup_ref">44</span></sup></a> The theory of these two techniques is beyond the scope of this text. However, particle swarm optimization is a stochastic global optimization algorithm based on swarm intelligence and extreme learning machine is a signal hidden layer feed-forward network with fast learning speed and high learning accuracy. Both statistical techniques were described in full in the paper and a schematic of the experimental setup was also given. During the experiment, 11 alloys were used, seven of which were used for calibration and the remaining four for prediction. All samples had previously been analysed using either AAS or XRF. The data obtained for the four predictive samples were compared with these reference data. In addition, other models were also compared. These were: a univariate approach, support vector machine and extreme learning machine without the particle swarm optimization. In all cases (all four samples and for Cr, Cu and Mg), the particle swarm optimization combined with extreme learning machine provided results in closest agreement with those obtained using XRF. Using the combined method, correlation coefficients for calibration were greater than 0.997 and the root mean square error of prediction was 0.0045%, 0.0095% and 0.0138% for Cr, Cu and Mg, respectively.</span>

The results were compared with those obtained from data analysis using support vector machine alone. As is the norm for this type of paper, a training set of spectra was required from samples of known composition and this was used to develop the model. Other samples of known composition are then used to verify the accuracy of the model before it can be used on unknown samples. Both classification methods performed well, with the support vector machine alone classifying 98.3% of samples correctly and the PCA – least squares support vector machine 100%. The results for the support vector machine showed that of the 60 spectra of the test set, one 7075 aluminium alloy spectrum was misclassified as 5052, with the remaining 59 spectra being predicted correctly. Therefore, the prediction accuracy of 7075 is 91.67%, and the prediction accuracy rate of the other four aluminium alloys was 100%. It is known that LIBS spectra can vary through changes in laser fluence. Yue <span class="italic">et al.</span> used machine learning to correct for this efficiently.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit46"><sup><span class="sup_ref">46</span></sup></a> These authors deliberately changed the fluence of the Nd:YAG laser used between 7.9 and 71.1 mJ and collected the LIBS spectra from aluminium alloys, with Mg being the analyte. Comparison of the data obtained using the proposed method was made with other methods, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> through correction for crater volume, electron number density and plasma temperature and a classical univariate correction method (normalising with laser pulse energy and total spectral intensity). The authors noted that improvements over no correction were made for the crater volume, electron number density and plasma temperature method. However, they pointed out that measurement of crater volume is not always easy and can be time-consuming, especially for an industrial application. The machine learning method, however, first used the back propagation neural network to train and validate the model. This led to an average precision of 6.3% RSD being achieved for the test samples; a significant improvement over the other methods. This could potentially allow it to be used in an on-line industrial setting.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A paper by Wang <span class="italic">et al.</span> described a feature selection method called <span class="italic">recursive feature elimination (RFE) and combined that with ridge regression</span> and then applied this combination to data obtained from the LIBS analysis of aluminium alloys.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit48"><sup><span class="sup_ref">48</span></sup></a> The paper described the model in full mathematical detail. This method uses a base model for multi-round training. After each round of training, several features of weight coefficients are removed, and the next round of training is based on a new feature subset. The RFE method recursively reduces the size of feature subsets by sequential backward selection. This greatly reduces the randomness of spectral lines. In this paper, the ridge regression is used as the basic model of RFE to solve the quantitative problem. The ridge regression model is used to fit the calibration set data, and the regression coefficients are recorded. The spectral features are sorted according to the absolute value of the regression coefficients. The lowest ranking spectral feature is deleted from the feature set in each cycle. Once the weakest of the data had been removed, the remaining subset was input to a partial least squares regression model (PLS). The analytes determined were Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Si and Zn. Comparison was made between partial least squares regression using the full data set, a genetic algorithm partial least squares model and the proposed model.

Several commercial alloys (A1050, A1100, A2017, A2024, A5052, A5083 and A6061) were then analysed using the system. Overall, the method was deemed successful, although several could not be classified into the alloy type. This though was not a failing of the LIBS system. Instead, it stemmed from the different alloys having extremely similar chemical fingerprints. To prove their point, the authors used a dissolution method followed by ICP-OES and had similar results. It was noted that the LIBS analysis was rapid and could be undertaken on-line, whereas the ICP-OES analysis could not and required a sample dissolution procedure, making it far slower.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A second paper by Fugane <span class="italic">et al.</span> used LIBS for the rapid <span class="italic">detection and characterization of inclusions in re-cycled aluminium materials</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit50"><sup><span class="sup_ref">50</span></sup></a> The Nd:YAG laser system, optics, detection system and motorized X,Y,Z sample plate were all discussed in detail. Again, the gate delay and gate width were optimized prior to analysis. The inclusions contained significant amounts of Fe and Si. The number of inclusions was estimated by analysing the surface of the 4 mm × 5 mm sample and then, assuming homogeneity throughout the sample, the number of inclusions on the surface was extrapolated to the number in the whole sample. Lateral resolution of the LIBS system was restricted by the size of the ablated crater and was approximately 100 μm. Analysis of the entire surface took approximately 40 minutes to complete. The authors did specify that this time could be reduced significantly if spectrum analysis was automated using a high-performance computer. The LIBS system was clearly well-suited to such an analysis, since a standard procedure would require the dissolution of the sample which would also probably dissolve the inclusion.</p>

The particles collected at each stage were analysed using TXRF so that an identification of the bulk components could be made. Analysis of the original material confirmed that Inconel 718 contains ∼52% Ni, 20% Cr and 18% Fe, with much smaller concentrations of Mn, Mo, Nb and Ti also being identified. The particles formed during the process were mainly in the &lt;100 nm fractions and had a very different composition; with 47% Cr, 26% Ni, 18% Fe and almost 10% Mn being found. A XANES study of the oxidation states of the four main analytes in the particles was then undertaken. This identified that Cr, Fe and Mn all demonstrated significant oxidation compared with the original sample, but that the Ni remained in its metallic form. Fortunately, there was no evidence that Cr<small><sup>VI</sup></small> had been formed as this would have had significant health implications for the workers. The work was therefore a good example of where atomic spectrometry can be used not just to determine the composition of samples, but also to use the information to assess toxicity.</span>

The IMEC method is a two-stage process. The first is the preparation of a standard.

A portion of this is sent away for analysis to confirm the composition. The second stage is to use this standard during the LIBS analysis along with a quantitative analysis algorithm. This algorithm was discussed in detail in the paper. The performance of the methodology was compared with that of an internal standardisation method during the analysis of 13 batches of sample. Average values of both the root mean square error (RMSE) and the RSD were improved by a factor of approximately two.</p>

The reader is directed to that section for a more in-depth discussion. Another paper reporting the analysis of superalloys was presented by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span> who used both μ-XRF and LIBS for the surface and depth-resolved analysis of the composite powders, respectively.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit54"><sup><span class="sup_ref">54</span></sup></a> The nickel-containing superalloy had a mean particle size of 100 μm and 42 g was mixed in a ball mixer with cobalt (8 g) that had a mean particle size of &lt;5 μm. Steel balls (100 g, 7 mm diameter) were used for the mixing which occurred at 200 rpm, since higher speeds led to adsorption of the powders to the mixing balls or vessel. Mixing times of 0.5, 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours were used and the resulting powder from each (10 g) was pressed at 900 MPa into a disk suitable for μ-XRF and LIBS analysis. The crater depth arising from LIBS analysis was determined using a three-dimensional optical profilometer. The analysis of the bulk material was achieved using ICP-OES. Analytical data from μ-XRF showed that the concentration of Co increased rapidly between 0.5 and 4 hours, but then stabilised to a value of approximately 62%. Precision improved from nearly 14% RSD after four hours to approximately 4% RSD after 24 h. The optical profilometry indicated that, at the surface, a single LIBS laser shot produced a crater of depth 0.5 μm. This value increased with increasing numbers of laser shots. Overall, the samples taken after 24 h were homogeneous, but the Co content was less than that expected from the ingredients added. It was concluded that the very fine particulate Co powder was adsorbed to the steel balls and vessel to a greater extent than the larger superalloy particles.</span>

A total of 54 analytes were determined with LOD ranging from 0.4 to 3000 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. Unfortunately, there was quite a sizeable matrix effect for many of the analytes, with their signal dropping by up to 90% when the tungsten reached 3 g L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The worst affected analytes were those with a mass of between 40 and 130 a.m.u. A bigger dilution of sample (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> a tungsten concentration of &lt;700 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>) went some way to overcoming this problem, but led to many analytes being diluted to below their LOD. Subsequent ICP-MS analyses were undertaken with a tungsten concentration of 700 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>. The operating conditions for ETV-ICP-MS had to be optimized. Factors considered were the plasma power, ETV temperature program, the transfer gas flow rate and the ion lens settings.

Method validation for the ETV-ICP-MS was achieved through comparison with ICP-MS and ETAAS data and through spike/recovery experiments.

Briefly, 1.5 g of sample was placed in a quartz cup that was placed in a vacuum distillation device. This was then heated to 390 °C. When the first sign of melting occurred, a tiny bleed of filtered air was admitted so that an oxide layer formed on the surface. Vacuum distillation then occurred for a period of 3 hours, leaving a thin film of cadmium oxide rich in impurities in the quartz container and the cadmium coated elsewhere. The cadmium oxide film containing the analytes was then dissolved in nitric acid and diluted to 3 mL for ICP-MS analysis or to 5 mL for ICP-OES analysis. The LOD for 41 analytes ranged from 0.002 to 10 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for ICP-MS and from 0.1 to 40 ng g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for 43 analytes using ICP-OES.

Approximately 0.5 g of these “chips” were weighed into 10 mL of water. Then, hydrofluoric acid (1 mL) was added very slowly (20 min) to minimise splashing. Then, 5 mL aliquots of the solution were placed in a clean platinum crucible and dried at 107 °C. Further aliquots were added and dried until the residue from the whole solution was present. The lithium borate flux was added and the mixture fused using a complex temperature program (provided in the paper). Overall, the zirconium and 17 analytes were diluted by a factor of 16.

The more energetic plasma increases the plasma temperature by up to 20% and that, combined with the elongated lifetime of the plasma, leads to an increase in sensitivity by an order of magnitude. Using the method, the grade of gold could be determined with an analytical error of less than 0.5%. An added advantage was that stylus profilometry demonstrated that the damage caused by the laser shot was less than that caused during normal LIBS.</p>

For certification purposes, 10 mg aliquots from different bottles of SENS-1 were weighed into microwave bombs and then digested with microwave assistance using a mixture of nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide. The resulting solutions were spiked with Se-82 and then an isotope dilution analysis undertaken using a triple quadrupole ICP-MS instrument employing oxygen as the reaction gas to quantify the Se present.

The analytical data obtained from the samples were then analysed statistically using PCA, where the input to PCA was 30 LIBS spectra per sample, and another chemometric tool called graph clustering. A brief description of the latter was given in the paper. The PCA was easily capable of discriminating between different brands of toner, although sometimes a second iteration of PCA was required. The graph clustering model also managed to classify the majority of toners with 100% accuracy with all except one of the others being classified correctly 97% of the time.

It was noted that the ICP-OES instrument was capable of determining P, which acted as a very good discriminating element. Unfortunately, the LIBS instrument used was not capable of this. Data from only 20 spectral lines were collected using LIBS and subjected to PCA. This was sufficient to be able to distinguish between two inks of the same colour. The method was applied to the analysis of a cheque in which a 10 had been converted to 100. The last zero was identified as being added by a different pen because it contained large concentrations of Cu whereas the one and the first zero did not.

Although some analytes were found to form strong clusters, it was impossible to discriminate between samples from the different sites. The authors suggested that future work could perhaps try to separate impurities from the cocaine prior to the analysis. Spike tests indicated good recoveries for the majority of analytes (typically 90–115%).

However, the XRF identified clear differences in the metallic signatures for many of the dyes, even on a single hair. For instance, product A yielded a Fe signal, product B both K and Mn and product C Ti. A combination of SERS and XRF was more efficient at differentiating the dyes than either technique alone.</p>

Three drugs were analysed: bismuth pectin, bismuth aluminate and bismuth magnesium sodium bicarbonate. Sample (0.4 g) was digested using nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide at elevated temperature. The digests were then evaporated to dryness and the residue dissolved and diluted to 25 mL for analysis. The effects of the presence of low molecular weight organic substances, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> formic acid, acetic acid, methanol and ethanol were tested. Formic acid at a concentration of 3% performed the best and increased sensitivity by a factor of 23.

Unfortunately, the presence of the formic acid improved the interferences from Cu, but did not ameliorate them completely, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> recovery improved from 180% to 116%.

          <span>There were many more papers on this subject than last year; mostly of Chinese origin which may reflect the current interest in coal in this part of the world. The analytical technique of LIBS features highly this year and much research is in the field of improving the measurement of calorific value for the optimal control of coal blending and combustion in thermal power generation. The calorific value of coal is positively correlated with the content of C, H, and S involved in combustion, but is also closely negatively correlated with the ash content (oxides of Si, Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, <span class="italic">etc.</span>).</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A contribution by Li <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit80"><sup><span class="sup_ref">80</span></sup></a> was in the field of calorific value measurement and described a method of determining <span class="italic">light elements associated with the organic fraction using LIBS and inorganic ash forming elements using XRF.</span> The combined approach greatly improved the measurement repeatability of the coal calorific value. The prediction model used PCA and multiple regression. The experimental results showed that the SD of calorific values predicted is 72 J g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> which is an order of magnitude lower than the 700 J g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> of traditional LIBS. This method could be applied in power plants and other fields that need to pay close attention to coal quality. The quick, reliable and on-site analysis afforded by LIBS is therefore an ideal solution to the problem of obtaining best combustion from coal.</p>

This paper established a novel calibration model by using a genetic algorithm optimized support vector regression. The traditional AAS and ICP-AES methods of analysis for these elements have some disadvantages such as use of reagents, long turnaround time and possible contamination. Although LIBS technology has a gap in measurement precision and detection limits compared with AAS and ICP-AES it has unique advantages in rapid detection and simplicity which meets the demands of industrial production monitoring. The characteristic wavelengths of Fe, Ni and V were found by comparing the LIBS spectrum of petroleum coke with the NIST database. Feature selection was then carried out by modelling and sorting root means square error (RMSE) after cyclically removing one feature wavelength. After feature selection, support vector regression modelling was performed again. The prediction accuracies of V and Ni with feature selection were close to that of standard ASTM D6376. It was therefore concluded that it is feasible to determine Fe, Ni, and V in petroleum coke using LIBS in an industrial environment.</p>

This tandem approach allows simultaneous determination of major and minor elements in coal. The research focused on coal-classification strategies based on PCA combined with K-means clustering, partial least-squares discrimination analysis (PLSDA) and support vector machine. Correlation analyses performed using TOF-MS and LIBS spectra from the coal samples showed that most major, minor and trace element emissions had negative correlation with the volatile content. Suitable variables for the classification models were determined from these data. The individual TOF data, LIBS data and combined data from TOF and LIBS as the inputs for different models were analysed and compared. In all cases the results obtained with the combined TOF and LIBS data were found to be superior to those obtained with the individual TOF or LIBS data. The nonlinear support vector machine model combined with TOF and LIBS data provided the best coal-classification performance, with a classification accuracy of up to 98%.</p>

The detection of N and S in coal is essential for the evaluation of its quality. This study employed LIBS to test coal quality and combined two variable selection algorithms, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling and the successive projections algorithm to establish the corresponding partial least square model. The partial least square modelled with the full spectrum of 27<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>620 variables had poor accuracy. The coefficient of determination and RMSE of the test set for N were 0.5172 and 0.2263, respectively. For S they were 0.5784 and 0.5811, respectively. The competitive adaptive reweighted sampling and the successive projections algorithm screened 37 and 25 variables respectively in the detection of N and S but the prediction ability of the model did not improve significantly. Successive projections algorithm partial least square finally screened 14 and 11 variables respectively through successive projections and obtained the best prediction effect among the three methods. The coefficient of determination of the test set and root mean square error of N were 0.9873 and 0.0208 and those of S were 0.9451 and 0.2082 respectively. In general, the predictive results of the two elements increased by about 90% for root mean square error and 60% for coefficient of determination of the test set compared with partial least square treatment. The results showed that LIBS combined with successive projections algorithm-partial least square has good potential for detecting N and S content in coal and is a very promising technology for industrial applications.</p>

Isotopes monitored were <small><sup>58</sup></small>Ni, <small><sup>32</sup></small>S and <small><sup>51</sup></small>V, at a medium resolution of 4000. The spectrometer was fitted with a commercial micro-flow total consumption nebulizer mounted with a laboratory-made jacketed spray chamber whose temperature was set at 60 °C. Large quantities of clusters were detected in Boscan crude and its toluene soluble and toluene insoluble subfractions both at room temperature and after heating. Dilution experiments showed no significant change of these profiles suggesting that these clusters, as well as the other lower molecular weight aggregates and molecules, are not in equilibrium with each other and behave as independent units. A temperature cycle was then used to monitor possible changes of GPC-ICP-HRMS profiles with temperature. Here Boscan crude samples were heated from 25 to 200 °C, left standing for 24 h and then cooled back to 25 °C before measurement. Small changes were found for Boscan crude asphaltenes however vast changes in the profiles were detected for toluene soluble and insoluble subfractions indicating interchange of material between the cluster and the other components of the solution. These results were discussed in terms of different arrays that may result when asphaltenes are separated into the two subfractions, and nanoaggregates are relocated within the cluster before and after heating.</p>

The Ni, S and V species size distributions were studied to track their evolution during the catalytic processes. For the Ni and V aggregates, it was found that high molecular weight compounds are more refractory compared with low molecular weight and medium molecular weight compounds which were removed at low temperatures. For the S aggregates a slightly different behaviour was observed, the low molecular weight and medium molecular weight aggregates are not as easily hydrotreated compared with the high molecular weight aggregates. This phenomenon illustrated the inherent difference in chemical composition of the metallo-organic compounds compared with the S-containing compounds and their reactivity.</p>

Natural plant biomass or biowaste plants in many cases show deficiencies in Fe, Co and Ni and they are supplemented with trace elements to guarantee stable gas and energy production. In this study a procedure was developed to monitor dissolved elements in these processes to prevent an overdose or underdose of these elements. The digester liquid is comparable to sludge with a high solids content and a high salt concentration. A series of two centrifugation steps followed by microwave assisted digestion was used prior to analysis using TXRF.

        <h3 id="sect1008"><span class="b_heading">3.3 Polymers and composites</span></h3>
        <span>Research into the atomic spectrometric analysis of polymers and composites has followed two main themes: the analysis of micro or nano-plastics in the environment and classification for recycling purposes. The second category has made significant use of the varying forms of LIBS; usually in combination with a chemometrics method. There are, however, several other un-related but interesting applications to be discussed.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">For some time now there has been concern that micro/nanoparticles of polymers that enter the environment may act as sinks for toxic organic compounds and for heavy metals. This has led to a huge increase in the number of papers undertaking their analysis. An example was presented by El Hadri <span class="italic">et al.</span> who employed <span class="italic">LA-ICP-MS to determine the trace element distribution in marine microplastics</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit95"><sup><span class="sup_ref">95</span></sup></a> The operating conditions of the Nd:YAG laser used were optimized in terms of signal intensity and precision through the analysis of the reference material NIST 612 glass. It was possible to distinguish analytes that were additives (Cu, Pb and Sb) from those that were adsorbed to the surface (As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Pb, Sb, Sn, U and Zn). The authors proposed a spatiotemporal correlation of the sorption pattern comparing microplastics in terms of relative exposure time and time-weighted average exposure concentrations.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">Single particle ICP-MS analysis</span> has normally been applied to the analysis of engineered nanoparticles. However, in a paper by Jimenez-Lamana <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit96"><sup><span class="sup_ref">96</span></sup></a> it was employed for the detection and quantification of nanoplastics. The polymer particles were attached to functionalized gold-containing nanoparticles. This was achieved by using the negatively charged carboxylate groups on the plastics surface with a positively charged gelatin moiety attached to the gold nanoparticle. The Au was then detected using ICP-MS operating in single particle mode enabling the nanopolymers to be quantified with &lt;5% error. The model was developed using polystyrene particles of nominal diameter of 759, 990 and 3030 nm which mimic the natural breakdown of plastics in the environment. The quantification limit was 8.4 × 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> nanoparticles per litre and the calibration was linear up to 3.5 × 10<small><sup>8</sup></small> nanoparticles per litre. Once developed, the method was applied to the detection of nanoparticles in drinking, tap and river waters. Assuming a fully functionalized nanoplastic, the theoretical limit of detection for size of the proposed strategy was 135 nm and the maximum size that could be quantified was 1000 nm.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper by Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the <span class="italic">use of LIBS for the analysis of single microplastics</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit97"><sup><span class="sup_ref">97</span></sup></a> The LIBS system used was discussed and a schematic diagram provided. The methodology was optimized using pure polypropylene particles of 150 μm diameter that had been treated with different concentrations of lead acetate and cadmium sulfate. Analytical signals were normalised to the C signal at 247.9 nm to compensate for any laser energy fluctuation or particle morphology effect. The Cd and Pb signals were proportional to the concentrations of analyte the polymers were exposed to. The methodology developed was applied to particles collected from seawater through filtration, the polymers identified using Raman and then the LIBS system to determine trace metal content. The advantages of the system were described as: its ability for multi-elemental determination, its speed (100 ms acquisition time – but this was limited by the speed of the laser used and could probably be reduced further), not having the requirement of chemical treatment of the samples (unlike other techniques) and its ability to analyse individual particles of micron size. The size LOD was 70 μm, but that was restricted because of the need to transfer the particle from the Raman microscope to the LIBS setup. It was thought that the particle size LOD could be improved further if a hybrid system was developed. In that case, size would be determined by the resolution of the LIBS system and could be as low as 1 μm.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An interesting application of microplastic analysis was reported by Holmes <span class="italic">et al.</span> who developed a method for the determination of the <span class="italic">in vitro avian bioaccessibility of metals adsorbed to the pellets</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit98"><sup><span class="sup_ref">98</span></sup></a> Polyethylene pellets were collected from beaches and then exposed to an acidified (pH 2) saline solution of pepsin for 168 h at 40 °C. The extracted Co, Fe, Mn and Pb as well as their residual concentrations, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> those that could be extracted using dilute <span class="italic">aqua regia</span>, were quantified using ICP-MS. Time-based studies indicated that the Co, Fe and Mn were mobilised quickly at the beginning of the pepsin leach, but slowed to a quasi-equilibrium. The Pb leaching was more complex, with evidence of secondary maxima and re-adsorption. After the full 168 hours, the concentrations of metals extracted from the solid material were 0.014, 0.81, 38.9 and 0.10 μg g<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for Co, Fe, Mn and Pb, respectively representing an extraction efficiency of 50, 80, 60 and 80%, respectively.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">metrologically traceable protocol for the quantification of trace metals in different types of micro-plastics</span> was described by Hildebrandt <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit99"><sup><span class="sup_ref">99</span></sup></a> Three different microwave digestion systems, that differed in their temperature and pressure regulation as well as the number of samples that could be processed simultaneously, were compared. Also compared were different acid digestion mixtures as well as different temperatures and hold times of the digestion procedure. The digestion and analysis stages were validated by the use of six CRMs: two polyethylene CRMs (ERM1-EC680m and ERM1-EC681m), a PVC (NMIJ CRM 8123-a), two polypropylene (NMIJ CRM 8133-a and lead in plastic-QC) and an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) CRM (BAM-H010). Determination of a total of 56 analytes (although the certified ones were: As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb, Sb, Sn and Zn) was by ICP-MS/MS. Recovery in the certified materials fell in the acceptable range of 95.9 ± 2.7% to 112 ± 7% for all analytes except for Cr in ABS. After optimization of the procedure, these figures improved marginally to be between 103 ± 5% and 107 ± 4% for all analytes. However, this further optimization also brought the Cr result in ABS to much more acceptable levels.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The other main topic of research has been the <span class="italic">analysis, characterisation and identification of waste plastics</span>. An example by Junjuri and Gundawar used a low-cost LIBS system to obtain analytical data and then the chemometric tools of principal component analysis (PCA) and artificial neural network (ANN) to analyse the data and to characterise 10 types of polymer.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit100"><sup><span class="sup_ref">100</span></sup></a> The two LIBS setups used were described in detail. One comprised a Nd:YAG laser, an Echelle spectrometer, an intensified CCD, optics and an X–Y translational stage. The other comprised a low cost, compact, and portable non-gated Czerny–Turner CCD spectrometer. Data were recorded in two modes: single shot using both CCD and intensified CCD and an accumulation of 10 shots using only the intensified CCD. Spectra were collected that obtained data for Ca at 393.33 nm, H at the 656.36 nm line, K at 766.69 nm, Mg at 279.51 and 280.33 nm, N at 742.42, 744.35 and 746.90 nm, Na at 589.52 and 589.61 nm and for O at the 777.23 nm line. In addition, the C<small><sub>2</sub></small> Swan band and the band for CN were also measured. Data analysis using PCA was described as having “excellent discrimination”. However, use of ANN demonstrated even better performance, with discrimination rates of up to 99% being achieved. The Echelle-based instrument equipped with the intensified CCD and using 10 laser shots provided data that had 97% discrimination. However, the Czerny–Turner-based instrument equipped with the ordinary CCD and using only one laser shot provided a similar performance. This latter instrument was therefore much lighter, smaller, was more portable and less expensive than the Echelle instrument. It also provided data much more quickly (by a factor of 15) because of a reduced amount of time required to train and test the ANN model.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper by Brunnbauer <span class="italic">et al.</span> described the use of <span class="italic">LIBS combined with PCA and K means clustering to classify bulk polymers as well as individual layers of layered polymer composites</span>, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> two-sided sticky tape.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit101"><sup><span class="sup_ref">101</span></sup></a> The LIBS parameters (laser energy, gate delay, laser spot size and the gaseous atmosphere) were all optimized. A short gate delay resulted, in increased emission intensities of the elements C, H and O and longer gate delays improved the signal-to-noise ratio especially in the wavelength range of the C2 swan band. The compromise conditions were tabulated. Bulk polymer sample types from a 3-D printer included polyethylene, polyacrylate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polylactic acid. The two-sided sticky tape was known to comprise four different layers: a polyethylene liner, polyacrylate adhesive layer, PVC support and a second polyacrylate adhesive layer providing a total thickness of 250 μm. The PCA was incapable of discriminating between PVC and polyacrylate. However, the K means clustering discriminated between all polymer types. The obtained 3D distribution of the different polymers present in the multilayer sample was compared with data obtained from a microscopic cross-section of the investigated sample. The sequence of the different layers present in the sample was correctly classified and also the thickness of each layer is in good agreement with the microscopic cross-section.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">An array of different spectroscopic techniques (attenuated total reflection (ATR)-FTIR, near IR reflectance spectroscopy, LIBS and XRF) and seven different classification methods were used by Michel <span class="italic">et al.</span> to classify different polymers.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit102"><sup><span class="sup_ref">102</span></sup></a> Classification methods included: naive spectral matching and three machine learning classifiers (support vector machine (SVM), <span class="italic">k</span> nearest neighbours (kNN), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)), each of which was also coupled with PCA: PCA-SVM, PCA-kNN, and PCA-LDA. Polymer types tested were: polyethylene terephthalate (PET), high density polyethylene, PVC, low density polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene. The success rates for the different techniques using the different classifiers were tabulated. Linear discriminant analysis proved to be the best classifying method for the ATR-FTIR, near IR-reflectance and LIBS analyses with a success rate of 99 ± 1, 91 ± 1 and 97 ± 2%, respectively. The best classification success rate for XRF analysis was obtained using <span class="italic">k</span> nearest neighbour; but was much lower at 70 ± 4%. The last paper of interest in this little sub-section was provided by Liu <span class="italic">et al.</span> who described the development and use of a software system to be used in conjunction with LIBS analysis to analyse different plastics.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit103"><sup><span class="sup_ref">103</span></sup></a> Partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) were used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of plastics. The LIBS devices, including laser, spectrograph, delay generator and sample holder, were automatically controlled by the software. The plastic database was created with the capability of input, query, modify, delete and storage. It included a basic element database based on NIST and a dedicated plastic database which contains industrial plastics, plastic bottles and standard samples. A de-noising method, a baseline correction method and a peak detection method enabled material identification based on PLS-DA and quantitative analysis based on PLSR were all realized by the software. The software performance was excellent with an identification accuracy of 99.80% for industrial plastics being achieved.</p>

This reference method was validated through the analysis of the certified reference material ERM-EC681k polyethylene. Results for the calibration strategies ranged between 74 and 139% for PLS, 74 and 123% for PCR and 100 and 127% for two point calibration transfer. Precision was also very variable, ranging between 3 and 37% for PLS, 5 and 30% for PCR and 6 and 21% for two point calibration transfer. Although the results and precision were very variable, the authors still concluded that they were fit for purpose.</p>

Scatter plots of the Ti k<small><sub>β</sub></small>/Sb L<small><sub>αβ</sub></small> against the Zr k<small><sub>α</sub></small>/Nb k<small><sub>α</sub></small> X-ray intensities were used to discriminate between individual fibres.

The polymer blocks were placed in the cell holder without undergoing any treatment and were analysed using a spectral accumulation time of 300 s. The chemometric tool of partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to relate the scattered spectral radiation with the concentrations of C and H, hence enabling physical sample properties such as density, mass per atom and water absorption to be elucidated. Root mean square error of cross validation was used as the performance metric and provided values of approximately 4% for C.</p>

        <span>The <span class="italic">interrogation of gunshot residue (GSR)</span> continues to be a major inorganic forensic application of atomic spectrometry, serving as alternatives to the established SEM-EDX analysis. Madeira <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the successful discrimination of GSR collected from the hands of shooters of four different firearms using WDXRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit124"><sup><span class="sup_ref">124</span></sup></a> Statistical analysis of trace component concentrations and Rh tube Compton scattering arising from the organic components in the sample allowed identification of the GSR examined, including those that were Ba, Pb and Sb free. Analysis was performed using a standard laboratory sequential spectrometer equipped with a 4 kW Rh target X-ray tube and a range of diffracting crystals. Spectral data were processed using smoothing, baseline correction, normalisation and scaling prior to analysis by HCA, PCA and nearest known neighbour techniques. Detailed elemental mapping of tape-collected GSR was achieved using LA-ICP-MS equipped with a 213 nm Nd:YAG pulsed laser.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit125"><sup><span class="sup_ref">125</span></sup></a> A 4 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small> area was scanned in 33 minutes with the ablation of 100 lines, 2000 μm in length, and a spot size of 20 μm. A constant flow of He was used to carry ablated material to the plasma. Accurate determination of <small><sup>137</sup></small>Ba, <small><sup>121</sup></small>Sb and <small><sup>208</sup></small>Pb allowed for the visualisation of collected samples, whilst ternary distribution plots allowed discrimination of collected GSR particles from other sources of characteristic elements such as brake dust and fireworks.

        <p class="otherpara">Trace elemental profiling coupled with chemometric and other statistical techniques was utilized to <span class="italic">characterise and discriminate a variety of pyrotechnic sparklers used in the production of homemade explosive devices</span>. The concentration of 50 elements in 48 sparkler samples from eight brands available in Australia were determined using ICP-MS. Ground up samples were extracted in 10% nitric acid for 24 prior to analysis and a seven-element profile, consisting of Co, Ni, Sb, Sn, Sr, V and W, developed to identify the correct brand. The paper demonstrated the potential of using trace element data and chemometrics to correctly identify the origin of materials for forensic evaluation.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Several papers have reported forensic applications of glass analysis. Akmeemana <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed the <span class="italic">standard method ASTM E2927-16e</span>, which is a consensus-based approach to sampling, sample preparation, quantitative analysis and “match” comparison of chemical properties.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit127"><sup><span class="sup_ref">127</span></sup></a> Using glass from different manufacturers prepared days, weeks and months apart and analysing using LA-ICP-MS enabled the analytical data to be studied using chemometrics. Likelihood ratios were established that range between 10<small><sup>−3</sup></small>, where the glass comes from different manufacturers or from the same manufacturer months apart, to 10<small><sup>3</sup></small> where the glass samples are from the same manufacturer and prepared on the same day. The paper was very light regarding the analytical chemistry detail and concentrates more on the chemometric side of the work. However, is worth mentioning simply because it is a standard method. The method requires a glass fragment with dimensions of approximately 400 × 200 × 100 μm. A paper by Becker <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported attempts to reduce the size of the glass particle required.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit128"><sup><span class="sup_ref">128</span></sup></a> Ten small fragments of glass along with the standard reference materials FG1, FG2, NIST SRM 610 and NIST SRM 612 were mounted on a 3D moveable stage. Float glass standard FGS 2 was used as external standard, FGS 1 was used as a quality control sample and NIST SRM 612 served as a standard to quantify elements not certified in FGS 2. The samples were then analysed using LA-ICP-TOF-MS using an ArF excimer laser, the operating conditions for which were tabulated. The spot size of the laser was only 90 μm so the dimensions of the glass particles required for analysis could be reduced to 100 × 100 × 33 μm. This represented a sample mass reduction from 20 μg to only 0.8 μg. A total of 110 laser shots were made on each sample, with data from the first 10 being ignored because of potential surface effects. Data for 18 analytes were obtained and a modified 5-sigma criterion was used to identify match and no match samples from different sources.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A total of 17 laboratories participated in three <span class="italic">inter-laboratory comparisons for the forensic analysis of glass fragments from car windshields</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit129"><sup><span class="sup_ref">129</span></sup></a> The report, by Corzo <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the assessment of the data obtained using refractive index as well as from LIBS and μ-XRF. Every laboratory was sent three fragments of each of several samples, some of which were known samples and others were “unknown”. The exact details of each of the comparisons were given in the paper. The most interesting was in comparison three, where the participants were given a case scenario where three questioned glass fragments (Q1) from suspect one and three fragments (Q2) from suspect two were sent to the participants. Participants were asked to follow ASTM E1967 (for RI) and ASTM E2926 (for μXRF). In this example, all laboratories using refractive index correctly associated Q1 to K1, resulting in no false exclusions. All labs also correctly excluded all K1/Q1 and K1/Q2 pairs, resulting in no false inclusions. Similar results were obtained for those laboratories using μ-XRF and the labs using LIBS. Overall, the correct association rate was greater than 92% for all three techniques for samples that originated from the same source. For samples that originated from different vehicles, the correct exclusion rate is 82, 96 and 87% for refractive index, μ-XRF and LIBS, respectively.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Almirall <span class="italic">et al.</span> published a paper reporting the results of 17 major and trace elements in new <span class="italic">float glass materials intended to be used as matrix matched standards for LA-ICP-MS forensic analysis</span> of glass.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit130"><sup><span class="sup_ref">130</span></sup></a> Three Corning glasses, one each at low, medium and high concentrations of analytes (CFGS1–CFGS3), were distributed to seven laboratories who then analysed them using the standard ASTM E2927-16e1 method. A range of ICP-MS instruments and LA units were used during the study, with the diameter of the laser sampling spots being in the range 50–100 μm. A total of eight sets of data were obtained using the standard LA-ICP-MS methodology along with one set obtained using the standard ASTM E2926-17 μ-XRF method. Precision was typically better than 3% RSD within each laboratory and better than 5% RSD between labs. Given the laser spot size and the precision achieved, it was concluded that the glasses were homogeneous. Results were checked against the existing SRMs NIST 1831 and FGS2. At present, the materials developed in this study are not yet regarded as being SRMs. However, work is on-going with NIST to make them so.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Scatter is a problem associated with the forensic μ-XRF analysis of glass fragments, a problem exacerbated by their small size (typically &lt;1 mm). A study by Corzo and Steel attempted to <span class="italic">improve the signal to noise ratio of μ-XRF measurements by reducing the scatter produced by the sample stage</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit131"><sup><span class="sup_ref">131</span></sup></a> This was achieved by using 3D printing to produce a plastic mount that enabled the sample to be as raised as possible from the sample stage. Results for LOD from the analysis of NIST SRM 1831 were compared between a simple sample cup, a stage and two different mounts as well as for two different instruments. In both instrument cases, the LOD improved for the cup and the mount when compared with the standard stage, although the improvement was not uniform across the analyte mass range. Instead, the light elements, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Mg and Na as well as the heavy elements Sr and Zr, were improved by a factor of approximately two using the mount. Other analytes, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ca, Fe, K, Mn and Tl showed no improvement in LOD. Raising a specimen above the stage can improve the analysis of any type of sample that is partially transparent to the primary beam or small relative to the primary beam, as this will ensure that the background scatter is predominantly from the specimen itself and not the instrument. As particles approach bulk thickness (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> they become opaque to the primary beam), the stage plays an insignificant role and raising the specimen above the stage is not necessary. A second method to improve the LOD, that of using primary beam filters, was also tested during the study. Elements with lines in the high energy range (<span class="italic">e.g.</span> Rb, Sr and Zr) showed the greatest improvement in LOD. Unfortunately, different elements demonstrated an improvement whilst employing different filters.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A standardized method for the in-<span class="italic">air particle induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) analysis of glass fragments that uses a tantalum window material as a current normaliser</span> was reported in a paper by Sharma <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit132"><sup><span class="sup_ref">132</span></sup></a> Glass fragments were irradiated in air using a 3.5 MeV proton beam and simultaneous measurement of the prompt gamma rays from proton-induced reactions of isotopes of low atomic number elements <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Al, B, Mg, Na and Si as well as those at 135 or 165 keV from the tantalum window were measured. The results were compared with those obtained using a conventional (in vacuum) PIGE method in which sample in pellets of cellulose were analysed. Both methods were validated through the use of soda lime and borosilicate glass reference materials. The external (in air) method was both rapid and non-destructive and was able to discriminate between the two different glass types qualitatively and quantitatively. The only analyte capable of discriminating soda lime (automobile) glasses was Al. Therefore, an instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) method was also developed that enabled 13 analytes (including some transition and REE) at both major and trace levels, to be determined. Statistical analysis of the data using dendrograms and cluster analysis indicated that the glasses used in the study fell into three distinct groups. This gave the methods developed the potential to be used for forensic analysis.</p>

Any significant deviation from 1 indicated an error. This method was validated for S concentrations between 0.1 and 2 wt%, so long as the lead content was below 8 wt% since the Pb Mβ and Pb Mα lines overlap with S Kβ, S Kβ′.</p>

        <span>Various applications of the analysis of glass have been prepared during this review period, but the most common theme has been of a forensic nature. For those applications, minimally damaging methods of analysis are required to preserve the evidence. Therefore, techniques such as XRF, LIBS or LA-ICP-MS are the most common.

        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">production of reference materials</span> is always useful as it helps validate methodology. A paper by Chen <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported the production of two silicate glass standards containing precious group elements (Au, Ir, Os, Pd, Pt, Re, Rh and Ru) at relatively high concentrations.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit155"><sup><span class="sup_ref">155</span></sup></a> The materials were prepared at very high oxygen potentials, <span class="italic">i.e.</span> at elevated pressure. Experimental details of their preparation were provided. The samples were then analysed using SEM, electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and LA-ICP-MS. Although EPMA is not a sensitive technique, it could be used because the concentration of the analytes were sufficiently high. This is important because the correction procedures needed with this analytical method are well understood and so good accuracy is achievable using only pure metal or similar readily available substances as standards. The LA-ICP-MS was undertaken using an ArF laser operating at 193 nm and at a frequency of 5–10 Hz with an energy of 60–80 mJ. This provided craters of between 47 and 100 μm diameter. Calibration was achieved through the analysis of the SRMs NIST 610 and 612. The SEM data indicated that there were no remaining metal nano-nuggets, although this was limited by the resolution of the instrument (10 nm). It was declared that the glasses were homogeneous down to at least the micron scale. Chemical analysis indicated that Pt was present in both materials at between 400 and 5000 mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, with the other analytes being less. The data obtained using EPMA and LA-ICP-MS were in good agreement.</p>

The chemometric tools were PCA, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and the support vector machines support vector classification (SVC) and support vector regression (SVR). The paper provided a brief but useful introduction to each of the chemometric methods that a new worker in the area could find useful. The main elements of interest were Cr, Sr and Ti. Classification studies were made using PCA, PLS-DA and SVC. The PCA was unsuccessful in classifying all groups of glasses. The supervised techniques of PLS-DA and SVC were more successful, with PLS-DA classifying 90% successfully, and the SVC 100% (for both calibration and validation sets of samples). For quantitative analysis, SVR and PLSR were used. For PLSR, the root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.16, 0.20 and 0.08% for Cr, Sr and Ti, respectively. This was marginally better than those obtained using SVR. It was concluded that such an analytical approach could usefully be employed for process control of nuclear waste, nuclear forensics <span class="italic">etc.</span></p>
        <p class="otherpara">An interesting application of LIBS was reported by Stefanuk <span class="italic">et al. who increased the sensitivity of the analysis of glass by coating it with a few layers of graphene</span> prior to analysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit157"><sup><span class="sup_ref">157</span></sup></a> This is an extension to the now accepted nanoparticle enhanced LIBS analyses reported in previous years. The graphene layers were deposited onto copper foils using cold vapour deposition by CVD using methane and hydrogen as precursors. All depositions were performed at atmospheric pressure at 1000 °C for a duration of 30 min. After deposition, the copper foils were dissolved in a chemical solution of iron nitrate and, after repetitive washing cycles, the graphene layers remained floating in distilled water. They were then transferred to the sample to be analysed (Corning microscope slides). Each round of deposition resulted in six or seven layers of graphene being deposited. Using a Nd:YAG laser operating at 355 nm, the sensitivity of the LIBS determination of several analytes including Ca, Mg, Na and Si was enhanced significantly. Six-seven layers provided a much higher intensity than the plain glass surface and 12–14 layers enhanced sensitivity even further. The method was described as being cheap, rapid and easy to implement.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">The <span class="italic">surface contamination on optical glass</span> was determined by Gerhard <span class="italic">et al.</span> using a sensitivity-improved calibration-free LIBS system.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit158"><sup><span class="sup_ref">158</span></sup></a> The LIBS system, employing a Nd:YAG laser operating at 266 nm was described in full with the aid of a schematic diagram. Calibration-free LIBS can suffer from reduced sensitivity. The authors overcame this by recording two spectra with different delays between the laser pulse and the detector gate. The first measurement was performed in full local thermal equilibrium conditions, when the electron density is large enough to ensure Boltzmann equilibrium distributions of all plasma species. Since this has a low signal-to-noise ratio, this spectrum enables the quantification of major and minor elements only. To obtain data for trace analytes, a second spectrum was recorded with a longer delay. The lower electron density means that the equilibrium condition is not fulfilled for all elements. Atoms such as oxygen are characterised by large energy gaps between their electronic excitation levels. They are therefore out of equilibrium. Contrarily, the equilibrium condition is still fulfilled for metallic atoms because their energy levels lie closer to each other. Since the number of charged particles are reduced, the continuum emission intensity is lower and hence low-intensity emission lines are observable with an improved signal to noise ratio. The system enabled depth-resolved measurements to be made. Method validation was achieved by combining the depth-resolved measurements to give a bulk concentration, this was then compared with data obtained using a nitric/hydrofluoric acid etching followed by ICP-OES analysis.</p>

The safe and efficient operation of existing nuclear reactors was also a key topic, including assessing the condition of reactor components and quantifying the impurities in fuel. The drive to expand the number of measurable radionuclides to contribute to safe, cost-effective decommissioning continues, with destructive mass spectrometric techniques commonly used, in some cases supported by rapid, online radiochemical separation of the radioanalytes. Finally, isotopic ratio measurement was a popular area for identifying the source of nuclear contamination and for the safeguarding of nuclear materials.

The operating conditions for the glow discharge were optimized for each substrate to ensure best instrumental performance.

After dilution the sample was analysed using ICP-MS. Method validation was through spike recovery experiments with recoveries obtained for the 12 analytes being generally close to 100%.

          <span>A number of <span class="italic">reviews covering NP measurements</span> have been published this year. The first of these described here was presented by Laborda <span class="italic">et al.</span> and covered the detectability of NPs and the estimation of detection limits in sNP-ICP-MS from a metrological approach.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit263"><sup><span class="sup_ref">263</span></sup></a> The paper summarises and reviews, citing 48 papers, the different approaches that have been applied to determine whether NPs are detectable using sNP-ICP-MS and proposes a holistic approach for the estimation of the different critical values and LOD values. In addition, a calculation tool for estimating and predicting these critical and LOD values under different experimental conditions is also presented. The paper focuses more on the discrimination of particle events and the calculation of size LOD values, with less attention given to particle number concentrations and the associated dissolved element LOD values. The authors concluded that the discrete nature of the detected signals from individual particles and the distributions involved, which are governed by Poisson statistics, introduce additional levels of complexity in data treatment that have been overlooked in many publications. They also concluded that sNP-ICP-MS still lacks a standardised metrological approach to express and calculate its detection capabilities. A review by Mozhayeva and Engelhard, with 241 cited references, covering sNP-ICP-MS assessed the steps needed to be taken for it to become an “ideal method for nanomaterial characterization”.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit264"><sup><span class="sup_ref">264</span></sup></a> Most of the citations are summarised in tabular format with the text mainly devoted to sample introduction systems, the behaviour of NPs in the ion source, ion transport to the detector and the mass analysers in between the ion source and the detector, NP quantitation and the coupling of NP separation systems to ICP-MS instruments. The authors concluded that a careful optimization of the plasma conditions and dwell time is required to achieve improved NP size LOD values as well as accurate particle size and number values from a sample. Whilst sNP-ICP-MS is currently a very useful method for NP analysis there is still room for fundamental studies, instrumental improvements, and methodological advances to bring the technique closer to the goal of being an ideal method for nanomaterial characterization. The paper by Galazzi <span class="italic">et al.</span> that reviews, with 80 cited references, ICP-MS for NP detection and characterization reported on the evaluation of NPs in distinct biological samples and the behaviour of NPs and their toxicity in organisms.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit265"><sup><span class="sup_ref">265</span></sup></a> As well as sNP-ICP-MS the review has significant sections covering the use of LA-ICP-MS, HPLC-ICP-MS, FFF-ICP-MS and single-cell ICP-MS. The authors concluded that ICP-MS based strategies can help, to a large extent, in many studies and applications involving NPs and in analytical, biological, medical and environmental areas. A discussion paper by Wojcieszek <span class="italic">et al.</span>, entitled what “To-Do and Not-To-Do in Model Studies of the Uptake, Fate and Metabolism of Metal-Containing Nanoparticles in Plants”, which cites 54 articles, has also been published this year.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit266"><sup><span class="sup_ref">266</span></sup></a> The paper covered in detail areas such as NP transformations in growth media, sample preparation and the extraction of intact NPs from solid samples, NP uptake, translocation and biotransformation in plants. Speciation studies of NP and spatial distributions were also covered. The review is a welcome and timely addition to the NP focussed literature given the ever increasing number of studies involving NPs. The authors presented a number of recommendations on how to undertake such studies in the conclusion section with probably the most important being that initial studies should verify that the NPs under study are stable in the growth media used and that NP stability in the extraction protocols to be used should also be assessed.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">Further <span class="italic">reviews on the use of atomic spectroscopy for NP characterization</span> and detection have also been published this year. One of these, by Semenova and Silina, covers the various techniques that can be used to investigate the manufacture of organic–inorganic nanohybrids.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit267"><sup><span class="sup_ref">267</span></sup></a> The review, which cites 93 papers, gives an overview of a number of techniques that can be used for this purpose, namely FT-IR, Raman spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance, ICP-MS, sNP-ICP-MS, LA-ICP-MS, TOF-SIMS, LC-MS and laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry. The authors concluded that the nanoanalytical techniques mentioned in the review require a fundamental understanding of the physical processes between nano-objects and these detection techniques. Developments in this field will help the extraction of a maximum of analytical information from a single run. To address this, developments in both nanoanalysis tools (instrumentation), as well as new nanoanalytical methodologies, are to be expected. Two reviews covered different aspects of X-ray-based techniques for NP characterization and detection. The first of these, by Bleiner <span class="italic">et al.</span> with 128 articles covered, was a tutorial review of soft X-ray LA for nano-scale chemical mapping microanalysis.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit268"><sup><span class="sup_ref">268</span></sup></a> The review gave a good overview of the topic, including differentiating between imaging and mapping, spatial resolution and the trade off with chemical resolution, mechanisms of laser sampling, laser-plasma emission spectrometry and laser MS with a wealth of information included. Detailed conclusions on the benefits and drawbacks of the techniques discussed were given. The authors concluded that the results presented show that XUV/SXR-laser desorption spectrometry shows promise as an alternative to XUV/SXR-laser ablation spectrometry although ‘engineering robustness’ of the instrumentation needs to improve for this to be achieved. The other aspect of X-ray-based techniques that has been reviewed is angle resolved XRF, as given by GE-XRF and GI-XRF.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit269"><sup><span class="sup_ref">269</span></sup></a> This review by Baumann <span class="italic">et al.</span>, which cited 158 papers, gave a good introduction to the fundamentals of these two allied techniques, with sections on excitation sources including X-ray tubes, synchrotron radiation, laser produced plasmas, ion beams and the various detectors in current use. The review also had an extensive section on applications of GI-XRF and a smaller section on coupling of GE-XRF with other techniques such as microfocus excitation.

          <span>For particles with dimensions at the size limit of detection (LOD<small><sub>size</sub></small>) the generated ion signals lie within the standard deviation of the background signal, which arises from the signal from ionic species of the analyte present in the sample and electronic noise. Thus, there is considerable interest in <span class="italic">improving sample transport to the plasma and increasing ion transmission in the MS for SP-ICP-MS to improve obtainable figures of merit</span>. One way of improving the ion transmission is to increase the mass bandwidth of the quadrupole mass filter and this approach has been described and used by Meyer <span class="italic">et al.</span> for Au and composite REE NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit273"><sup><span class="sup_ref">273</span></sup></a> After optimization the sensitivity for <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au increased by a factor of 8.4 with a decrease in the LOD<small><sub>size</sub></small> from 7.0 to 4.9 nm. Increasing the quadrupole bandwidth decreases the mass resolution, allowing spectral overlap from adjacent <span class="italic">m</span>/<span class="italic">z</span> ratios and this factor allowed the sensitivity for the REES under study to increase by differing factors <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Er by a factor of 12 and Gd by a factor of 33. As the authors pointed out, one of the drawbacks of this approach is the potential for spectral interferences from other elements present in the samples under study. These therefore need to be carefully considered and it is possible that this approach is only suitable for suspensions of single element NPs and ions and not for multielement solutions.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">An alternative approach to <span class="italic">improving sensitivity for single NP analysis, using a newly developed conical torch</span> as opposed to the parallel path of the conventional Fassel type torch fitted to most modern instruments, has been reported by Alavi <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit274"><sup><span class="sup_ref">274</span></sup></a> The torch was fitted into what appears to be an in-house built ICP-OES instrument, with axial monitoring of the produced emission signals. A microdrop generator was used to produce monodisperse 50 μm <span class="italic">Ø</span> droplets containing NPs from one of eight elements, Ag, Al, Be, Ca, Fe, Mg, Na or Sr, which were desolvated and introduced into the plasma <span class="italic">via</span> an Ar gas carrier stream. A detailed description of the conical torch, which operates at a reduced RF power and gas flow rates compared with a Fassel type torch, is given in a cited reference and the sample introduction system is described in ESI. After optimization of the system for both conical and Fassel torch types, it was found that the conical torch gave a 1.5 to 8 times larger peak intensity, a two to four times greater peak area and higher precision (on average a 1.5 times lower RSD for peak intensity and a 1.8 times lower RSD for peak width) than the Fassel type torch. The authors concluded that these improvements observed using the conical torch were due to a much higher electron density in the plasma, a higher excitation temperature and plasma robustness and an improved particle trajectory which led to more rapid vaporization, atomization and ionization of particles with a lower atom/ion cloud diffusion. The capability of analysing single particles at a rate of at least 2000 particles per second was also demonstrated. It remains to be seen if any of the major instrument manufacturers or component suppliers will offer this conical torch design commercially. A microdrop generator has also been used to produce monodisperse droplets, containing different amounts of a dissolved element, to expand the versatility and the general understanding of sNP-ICP-TOF-MS measurements.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit275"><sup><span class="sup_ref">275</span></sup></a> In this work by Gundlach-Graham and Mehrabi, the temporal durations and elemental sensitivities obtained from the produced microdroplets and NPs were very similar such that microdroplets were used as proxies for NPs by controlling the absolute mass of elements injected into the plasma in each droplet. The paper described how microdroplets can be used to calibrate sNP-ICP-MS, in terms of both NP mass and particle number concentration and shows that, when combined with sNP-ICP-TOF-MS, online microdroplet calibration can be a powerful method for untargeted quantitative single-particle analysis. The use of microdroplets as a tool to study approaches for split event correction and single-particle detection with ICP-TOF-MS was also demonstrated. The authors concluded that microdroplet-based sample introduction, giving total consumption and quantitative transport of analyte in each microdroplet, could reduce sampling bias and thus improve quantification of element-mass distributions in analyte particles or cells. They also pointed out that the low volumetric throughput for microdroplet sample introduction remains a challenge for the detection of anthropogenic NPs at environmentally relevant particle number concentrations (10<small><sup>2</sup></small> to 10<small><sup>6</sup></small>) but anticipate improvements in this direction.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">general factorial design, with nebuliser gas flow, plasma RF-power and sampling depth as the independent variables</span> and the intensity of <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au as the response variable, was used by Kinnunen <span class="italic">et al.</span> to improve the sensitivity of sNP-ICP-MS for Au NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit276"><sup><span class="sup_ref">276</span></sup></a> The optimization was performed using both Au NPs and solutions of ionic Au and the instrumental parameter values after optimization were found to be in a good agreement for both analyte types, indicating a similar behaviour of the NPs in the plasma when compared with the dissolved analyte. The results obtained showed that significant interactions occur between the main instrument parameters under study hence consecutive single parameter optimization approaches may not be suitable for optimizations of sNP-ICP-MS instrumental conditions. The authors also point out that for more challenging analytes, such as Fe or Ti NPs, the potential for polyatomic interferences and doubly charged ions also needs to be included in the optimization routine. In sNP-ICP-MS the ion cloud produced from each particle is detected as a transient signal and, due to the size range of NPs that can be detected, this can span many orders of magnitude of the detector response. Non-linear detector responses can therefore cause biased results and this has recently been investigated by Strenge <span class="italic">et al.</span> using an in-house constructed data acquisition system fitted to a commercially available ICP-MS instrument.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit277"><sup><span class="sup_ref">277</span></sup></a> The device was used to assess the suitability of applying dead time correction to time resolved signals from gold NPs of both milli- and microsecond durations generated by a microdroplet sample introduction device. The results were compared with those obtained from the analysis of 11 Au NP suspensions, covering a size range of 10–100 nm, introduced <span class="italic">via</span> regular solution nebulisation. Applying a dead time correction routine to μs time resolved data increased the maximum number of counts tolerated per particle by four to fifteen-fold which resulted in the linear dynamic range increasing from 10–40 nm to 10–60 nm for Au NPs. It was also found that an accurate cross-calibration between pulse and analogue counting detector modes could extend the linear range up to 100 nm. The authors concluded that the results obtained support the theory of dead time related count losses being the main reason for nonlinear response in pulse counting sNP-ICP-MS. However, applying a dead time correction can lead to slightly distorted measured particle size distributions. In addition, despite the fact that counting electronics with ultra-low dead times could further improve the linear dynamic range, other ways must be explored to extend the top end of the tolerated particle mass range and, thereby, the methods’ applicability and usability. The five papers covered in this paragraph provide a wealth of information and interest for those who wish to explore the fundamentals of sNP-ICP-MS.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A number of reports of <span class="italic">attempts to improve the figures of merit achievable using sNP-ICP-MS</span> have been published this year. The use of IR energy to heat the sample introduction system, with the aim of reducing the LOD values obtainable, has previously been described in conjunction with ICP-OES. Williams <span class="italic">et al.</span> have now investigated whether this approach can improve the sample transport efficiency for sNP-ICP-MS.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit278"><sup><span class="sup_ref">278</span></sup></a> It was found that the number of detected Au NPs per min increased from 540 at room temperature to 600 at 60 °C and 840 at 80 °C. However, as it was only possible to use IR heating outside of the torch box, condensation could subsequently occur as the aerosol cooled on the way to the torch and no significant change in the LOD<small><sub>size</sub></small> resulted at 60 °C and degradation of this parameter occurred at 80 °C. The authors then investigated mono-segmented flow analysis (MSFA), in which a discrete sample volume is injected into a flow of air, in conjunction with sNP-ICP-MS for the same purpose. It was found that, with IR heating the transport efficiencies rose from 3.7 ± 0.3% to 10 ± 1% at 20 °C and 4.1 ± 0.2% to 12 ± 2% at 60 °C for sNP-ICP-MS and MSFA-sNP-ICP-MS, respectively. In all cases the measured size of the Au NPs, which ranged from 50 ± 13 to 54 ± 6 nm, were in statistical agreement with the certified size of 49.9 ± 2.2 nm. The same research group have also published a paper which described a different approach for calculating NP masses from sNP-ICP-MS data.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit279"><sup><span class="sup_ref">279</span></sup></a> If external calibration with standard solutions is used to find the mass of NPs, the average signal intensity for each standard solution is typically used, which requires measurement of the transport efficiency of solutions through the spray chamber. In this new approach the signal is integrated over a constant time period for all standards and samples and the mass of analyte aspirated can be calculated from the analyte concentration in each standard, the gravimetrically determined sample uptake rate and the integration time used. The line of best fit through the calibration curve of integrated signal <span class="italic">versus</span> sample mass can then be used to find the total mass of NPs nebulised during the integration time, and the mass of each NP then corresponding to the fraction of the total integrated signal caused by the NP. Measurement of the transport efficiency is only required if the concentration of NPs is desired. An alternative approach to improving sample transport efficiency is to directly nebulise NP suspension into the plasma, which obviates the need for transport efficiency measurements. These two papers contain a good explanation of the theory of IR heating and the calculations involved for the new approach for estimating transport efficiency and are well worth a read. A demountable direct injection high-efficiency nebulizer introduction system hyphenated to a flow-injection valve and a gas displacement pump was used by Tharaud <span class="italic">et al.</span> for this purpose with sample flow rates as low as 8 μL min<small><sup>−1</sup></small>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit280"><sup><span class="sup_ref">280</span></sup></a> Measurements made using this system were described as accurate and repeatable and the average measured diameters of Ag, Au and Pt NPs were in agreement with the manufacturers’ reference values. The system was also used to analyse for Au NPs in surface waters.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">A study by Yamashita <span class="italic">et al.</span> reported on a <span class="italic">new approach to extend the quantifiable size range of Au NPs in sNP-ICP-MS</span>, which is typically limited by detector saturation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit281"><sup><span class="sup_ref">281</span></sup></a> To achieve this, the signal intensities of Au related polyatomic ions such as <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au<small><sup>12</sup></small>C<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au<small><sup>14</sup></small>N<small><sup>+</sup></small>, <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au<small><sup>16</sup></small>O<small><sup>+</sup></small> and <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au<small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small>, instead of the <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au<small><sup>+</sup></small> signal, were used for the size calibration of Au NPs. Using the <small><sup>197</sup></small>Au<small><sup>40</sup></small>Ar<small><sup>+</sup></small> for example, the signal intensities emanating from the Au NPs were reduced to the 10<small><sup>5</sup></small> level for 400 nm Au NPs.

          <span>Several <span class="italic">studies focussed on improving the validation of data acquired using sNP-ICP-MS</span> have been published this year. Usually, the sample transport efficiency in sNP-ICP-MS is measured using a suspension of pure NPs, often of a single size. However, for some NPs pure suspensions are not available, particularly for those consisting of two or more elements or compounds. Therefore, an alternative approach, in which the transport efficiency is determined gravimetrically and termed a dynamic mass flow approach, has been developed by Cuello-Nunez <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit283"><sup><span class="sup_ref">283</span></sup></a> Initial studies used well characterized spherical Au NPs of 30 and 100 nm nominal diameter and the particle number results obtained by the dynamic mass flow approach, the conventional particle frequency approach and a laser-based (405 nm) particle tracking analysis method were all in good agreement within uncertainty limits. Subsequently, the dynamic mass flow method was applied to the particle number determination of triethanolamine stabilised bipyramidal shaped TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs for which no reference standard was available. Again, the results obtained for the dynamic mass flow and particle tracking analysis methods were in good agreement within uncertainty limits. For all approaches investigated, the uncertainties of the measured particle number concentrations, which are fully traceable to the SI, were between 10 and 15% relative, with the number of detected NP in the ICP-MS time scan being the major contributing factor to the overall measurement uncertainty. The use of microdroplet generators is increasing in laboratories investigating fundamentals of sNP-ICP-MS and a report of a combined microdroplet generator/conventional nebulisation sample introduction system was published by Rosenkranz <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit284"><sup><span class="sup_ref">284</span></sup></a> The system allowed rapid switching between the two devices, with each being able to introduce either NPs or their dissolved ion solutions to the plasma, such that various signal types could be monitored in a single time resolved run allowing rapid assessment of the total metal concentration and particle number and mass concentrations to be made, even when well characterized NPs are not available. After optimization the system was tested using Ag, Au and CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs in three different modes, termed counting mode (mode I), sensitivity ratio mode (mode II) and the well-established analysis mode in which both ionic standards and NP-containing suspensions were introduced <span class="italic">via</span> the microdroplet generator (mode III). For all three modes the measured particle sizes for the Ag, Au and CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs were all in statistical agreement with each other and the supplier’s data for the Ag and Au NPs. However, the determined average value for CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small>, 69 ± 6.4 nm, was much higher than the expected 28.4 ± 10.4 nm. The authors attributed this to possible NP agglomeration and/or the inability to detect NPs existing within this lower size range. For the Ag and Au NPs particle number concentrations were in agreement with the supplier’s data when measured using modes I and II, with recoveries of between 91 and 100%. However, this was not the case for mode III where the recoveries were between 70 and 88%. For the CeO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs the authors concluded that this latter measurement was not possible due to these NPs’ polydiversity, size and polyhedral shape.</span>

Method validation using NIST:8013 60 nm Au NPs at two concentration levels, 500 and 50 pg mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, showed no differences within uncertainty limits for particle number and recovery measurements. The values obtained for transport efficiency sNP-ICP-MS and hydrodynamic chromatography-sNP-ICP-MS, also showed no difference. The actual transport efficiency was lower for the sNP-ICP-MS method (2.54%) compared with the HDC-sNP-ICP-MS method (6.86%). The found particle size measurements agreed with the certified values, within uncertainty limits, for both approaches. Further validation and cross calibrations between the two methods described were also undertaken and are described in detail in the paper. Finally, as a proof-of-concept application, various liposomes with embedded Au NPs were analysed and the hydrodynamic sizes and metallic/inorganic content of lipid-based nano-carrier systems were determined. It was shown, which is again described in detail, that the HDC-sNP-ICP-MS setup was able to differentiate between similar sized lipids, the liposome inorganic content could be evaluated, that the particle uptake distribution of the loaded liposomes could be obtained in parallel with the actual hydrodynamic size of the nano-carrier systems and that liposome loaded and free NPs could be distinguished which is not possible with conventional sNP-ICP-MS. Due to instrumental developments it is now possible to use sub-millisecond dwell times for sNP-ICP-MS and the effect of this on the LOD<small><sub>size</sub></small> obtainable for sNP-ICP-MS was investigated by Mestek <span class="italic">et al.</span> using Ag NPs as the target analyte.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit286"><sup><span class="sup_ref">286</span></sup></a> Using dwell times of 10, 20 and 50 μs did not lead to a statistically significant decrease in the obtainable LOD<small><sub>size</sub></small>, which ranged between 9.4 ± 1.2 and 11 ± 4.7 nm, when compared with the value obtained using a dwell time of 100 μs, 12.4 ± 2.4 nm. When analysing for Ag NPs close to the LOD<small><sub>size</sub></small>, a low detection yield was observed, with only 5% and 44%, for 14 and 20 nm NPs, respectively, of the expected number of NPs as estimated from the transport efficiency, being detected. For 30 nm NPs the detected and estimated particle number concentrations were in statistical agreement leading the authors to conclude that, when using very short dwell times for NP sizes near the LOD<small><sub>size</sub></small>, the apparent transport efficiency value changes sharply and subsequently affects the particle concentration detection limit and that these measurements should be made with caution.</span>

          <span>Typically, sNP-ICP-MS is used to determine a NP comprised of a single element but, as NPs and microparticles can be comprised of more than one element or may contain isotopic information that can lead to source apportionment, the research field is expanding to account for this. Reports of ICP-MS being used to detect C, due to poor sensitivity and generally high background levels in reagents, are few and far between. Therefore it is good to see a paper where <span class="italic">sNP-ICP-MS has been used to detect microparticles on the basis of the</span><small><sup><span class="italic">13</span></sup></small><span class="italic">C signal</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit287"><sup><span class="sup_ref">287</span></sup></a> In this work, by Laborda <span class="italic">et al.</span> a flow focussing nebuliser was used in conjunction with a spray chamber designed for single cell analysis to improve the transport of the microparticles to the plasma. A range of dwell times, from 50 to 200 μs, were employed to analyse suspensions of latex and polystyrene microparticles, extracts of personal care products and teabags and Au NPs. Very high purity Ar (99.9999%) was used in an attempt to minimise background signals, which ranged from 80<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 to 100<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>000 cps for high purity water with a typical sensitivity of 1000 cps per 1 mg L<small><sup>−1 13</sup></small>C. After careful optimization of the system for both particle transport and atomisation efficiency, a LOD of 0.8 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> was achieved, illustrating the challenges involved. The authors stated that acidification and inert gas purging of the samples was not considered appropriate. The reasons for this are not given and would be interesting to know but an LOD of 0.1 mg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for dissolved organic carbon, using combustion/IR based instruments, can be readily achieved. It would seem that further work on this aspect could reduce the background to more manageable levels. The transport efficiency for 2.22 μm polystyrene microparticles was 29.9 ± 0.9% which was in fair agreement with the efficiency calculated using 50 nm Au NPs of 28.2 ± 0.4%. This fell to 12.5 ± 0.6% for 4.82 μm polystyrene μPs, showing that transport efficiency is dependent on size for polystyrene microparticles over <span class="italic">ca.</span> 3–5 μm. For size measurements of the polystyrene microparticles recoveries ranged from 90 to 95% for particles ranging from 1.98 to 5 μm but were 163% for 1.04 μm particles. Particle number concentrations were accurately measured up to 2 × 10<small><sup>9</sup></small> L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for 3 μm particles and a good discussion of the steps needed to achieve accuracy in both particle size and number measurements was given in the paper. The size of the particles detected in the personal care products and teabag extracts ranged between 2 and 3 μm with 10<small><sup>7</sup></small> to 10<small><sup>11</sup></small> particles per g released from the former and 10<small><sup>4</sup></small> particles per g released from the latter. Although, as the authors stated, the technique has limitations, particularly for environmental samples where particle number concentrations are often much lower than those measured here, it also shows promise if the challenges of high background levels of C can be reduced.</span>
          <p class="otherpara">A <span class="italic">multi-method approach to characterize metal nanoparticles contained in nanoplastic colloids</span>, which were described as composite particles, was reported by Barber <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit288"><sup><span class="sup_ref">288</span></sup></a> The techniques FFF-sNP-ICP-MS, TEM, Asymmetric Flow Field-Flow Fractionation-UV–Vis (AF4) and centrifugal field-flow fractionation (CFFF) were employed. The in-house synthesised target analytes were Au polystyrene-<span class="italic">block</span>-polyacrylic acid (Au-PS-<span class="italic">b</span>-PAA), Au-PS and Au-citrate NPs. The metal NP size and particle number concentration were obtained using sNP-ICP-MS whereby AF4 and CFFF were used to separate and size the composite particles based on their hydrodynamic diameter and buoyant mass, respectively. Off-line sNP-ICP-MS analysis of fractions obtained by the FFF separations facilitated measurement of the mass and number of Au-PS NPs (from 1 to &gt;8) contained in the composite particles. Differences or similarities in the NP size results obtained by AF4 and sNP-ICP-MS were used to further characterize composite particles, with the use of AF4 also allowing the detection of organic material associated with the inorganic NPs. In CFF, using a carrier that was density-matched to the polymer component of the composite particles allowed the measurement of multiple gold NPs in the composites. The authors concluded that to effectively apply the developed methodology to the environmental behaviour of nanoplastics in model systems, the mass of metal NPs in the composite particles should be kept small compared with the overall mass of the polymer in the nanoplastic.</p>

The uncertainties (2 SD) on the isotope ratios were 35% for 30 nm NPs, 17% for 50 nm NPs and 10% for 70 nm NPs with the precision obtained presumably improving due to the increasing ion signal with increasing NPs size for a given particle number concentration. The measured sizes for 30 and 50 nm Pt NPs were 30 nm ± 3 nm and 47 nm ± 5 nm which was in agreement with the data acquired by TEM.

The dead time correction factor was calculated using a solution of dissolved Pt and it may be that alternatives to this, using NPs, needs investigating.

          <span>The <span class="italic">various forms of FFF are probably the most common technique used for the separation of NPs based on size and this is often coupled with ICP-MS as the detector</span>. Velimirovic <span class="italic">et al.</span> used a combination of ultracentrifugation and hexane washing, thermal destruction of the matrix, and surfactant assisted particle extraction to extract TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs from sunscreen products.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit291"><sup><span class="sup_ref">291</span></sup></a> Particle size distributions in the extracts were assessed using AF4 hyphenated with Multi-Angle Light Scattering (MALS) and ICP-MS based on size calibration of the particle retention time in the AF4. The accuracy of the methodology was assessed by two internal reference samples: TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs (EC JRC NM104) and similar TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanoparticles dispersed in a sunscreen matrix. In each case the particle mass concentration recovery was greater for ICP-MS, 83–93%, than for MALS, 71–79%. When the developed methodology was applied to two commercial sunscreen samples TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs &lt;100 nm were detected. In a separate study reported by the same group, an intra-laboratory assessment was carried out to establish the effectiveness of a method for the detection of TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs and particles of a larger size, 200–500 nm in sunscreens.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit292"><sup><span class="sup_ref">292</span></sup></a> The extraction procedure involved the addition of a commercially available cleaning agent to aliquots of the sunscreens under test, shaking, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), the addition of 0.2% SDS (m/v) at pH 8.5–9, further UAE, dilution with 0.1% (v/v) SDS, filtration through 0.02 μm disc filters and a final step of UAE. Quantitative AF4-MALS and AF4-ICP-MS measurements of the hydrodynamic radius of the NM104 and the extracted TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs were then undertaken with the values obtained for the NM104 NPs used as reference values for the spiked sunscreen samples. It was found that there was a shift in the size distribution towards larger sizes for the spiked sunscreen extracts when compared with the reference values. Uncertainties, based on the method precision, were 3.9–8.8%. Finally, the bias data showed that the trueness of the method (5.5–52%) can only be taken as a proxy due to the lack of a sunscreen standard containing certified TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> NPs.

This was found to be a critical parameter in this regard. In AF4 the dissolved fraction passes with the cross flow through the membrane of the separation channel and is usually not analysed which is a disadvantage when compared with centrifugal field flow fractionation and chromatographic techniques. Thus, an AF4-ICP-MS system which allows the conversion of the discontinuous cross flow into a continuous flow to the ICP-MS for analysis was developed by Tan <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit297"><sup><span class="sup_ref">297</span></sup></a> Quantification was performed both for aqueous standard solutions and for environmental water samples using ultrafiltration as a reference method.

For Al and P the dissolved fraction, which was in the low μg L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> range, elevated recoveries were observed, presumably due to contamination from the AF4 system, but their values obtained still agreed with the ultrafiltration values within confidence intervals. This fraction is relevant to determine the ratio of free and particle bound nutrients or toxicologically relevant elemental species, to establish the dissolution rate of non-stabilised (nano)particles and to establish a mass balance for quality control of the fractionation results. Fraction collection of the cross flow followed by off-line elemental analysis is rarely performed to determine the dissolved fraction because of delayed elution through the frit of the channel, dilution and elevated blank levels for some elements. The authors concluded that the system could be used to determine the ratio of free and particle bound nutrients or toxicologically relevant elemental species, for NP dissolution rate studies and for determining a mass balance for quality control purposes.</p>

A polyimide coated fused silica capillary (i.d. 75 μm; o.d. 375 μm; length 70 cm) was used for the CE separations with ammonium bicarbonate (20 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, pH 7.4) as the running buffer and an applied voltage of +18 kV. Oxygen was used as the ICP-MS cell gas to allow <small><sup>32</sup></small>S<small><sup>16</sup></small>O to be monitored as a marker for proteins and V was added to the sheath liquid for use as an internal standard. Under these conditions the repeatability of migration times and peak areas ranged from 0.23–4.98% RSD, spike recoveries were 93 to 97% and the LOD values were 54 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> and 101 ng mL<small><sup>−1</sup></small> for SPIONs with carboxyl and amino terminal groups, respectively. The carboxyl coated SPIONs were found to be stable in the buffer solution for 24 hours whilst some of the amino coated SPIONs transformed into a form with higher electrophoretic mobility which matched the retention time of FeCl<small><sub>2</sub></small>. Monitoring of the <small><sup>32</sup></small>S<small><sup>16</sup></small>O signal led the authors to conclude that the majority of the carboxyl SPIONS and albumin present in the sample formed a conjugate. A CE-ICP-MS application was developed by Wroblewska <span class="italic">et al.</span> for monitoring the formation of cisplatin targeting delivery systems with Au NPs.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit308"><sup><span class="sup_ref">308</span></sup></a> In this work cisplatin was bound to Au NP with 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid as a nanomaterial surface modifier, the electrolyte was 40 mmol L<small><sup>−1</sup></small> HEPES at pH 7.4, the applied voltage was +15 kV, the sample injection pressure was 30 mbar for 5 s and the capillary length was 70 cm (i.d. 75 μm) with a total run time of 40 minutes. The results showed that an activated form of Au-cisplatin could be produced. Details of this procedure were given in a cited reference. All of the Au NPs were incorporated in the Au-cisplatin produced by this method. Taylor dispersion analysis is a microcapillary flow-based technique whereby a nanolitre-scale sample pulse is injected into the laminar flow of running buffer, which then undergoes axial dispersion. Detection of the equilibrium concentration profile of the dispersed sample pulse allows the molecular diffusion coefficient and hence hydrodynamic radius of solute molecules to be calculated. This technique has been coupled with ICP-MS to allow the determination of the hydrodynamic radius of Gd containing NPs, including sub 5 nm particles, in urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and undiluted serum. Precision of the measurements (RSD) was less than 10%. The authors stated that the specificity of the method provided the opportunity to perform measurements in complex biological media.</p>
          <p class="otherpara">The physicochemical properties and applications of C based nanomaterials are dependent on the amount of carboxyl group on their surfaces, and it remains a challenge to <span class="italic">determine the amount of carboxyl groups on the surface of these structures</span>.

Quantitative imaging of amyloid beta (A beta) in brain tissues is important in the development of Alzheimer’s disease treatments. A method using antibody-conjugated Au NPs for quantitative imaging of A beta peptide in the brain of a mouse suffering from Alzheimer’s disease using LA-ICP-MS was presented by Gao <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit310"><sup><span class="sup_ref">310</span></sup></a> A beta antibody (anti-A beta) was labelled with Au NPs to form the conjugate Au NP–anti-A beta which was immunoreactive with A beta in the brain slice of mouse. Quantitative imaging of Au was acquired with homogenised brain slice matrix-matched standards as external calibrants. The stoichiometric ratios between metal conjugates and A beta were optimized and the immunoreaction efficiency after labelling was also investigated. According to the molar relationship between Au NPs and anti-A beta (1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>4.3) and the ratio of anti-A beta to A beta (1<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>:<img class="charmap" src="https://www.rsc.org/images/entities/char_2009.gif" alt="[thin space (1/6-em)]"/>1), quantitative imaging of A beta in brain was accomplished. The method displayed the location and concentration of A beta aggregation in the brain tissues, and this was consistent with traditional immune-histochemical staining methods. The proposed methodology was stated to have potential for investigating the quantitative imaging of biomarker heterogeneity, and could also be useful for understanding complex brain mechanisms in the future. Analysis for NPs directly in solid biomatrices by LA-sNP-ICP-MS can produce erroneous results if non-optimal operational conditions are used. A report offered insights into the analysis for NPs by LA-SP-ICPMS, based on modelling the chain of events from NP release to LA cell washout to ICP-MS detection as a function of the biomatrix characteristics, instrumental specifications and variable operational settings was published by Metarapi and Van Elteren.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit311"><sup><span class="sup_ref">311</span></sup></a> By processing the computational data <span class="italic">via</span> an “outlier” filter to differentiate between NPs and dissolved ions, guidelines have been established to achieve the optimal instrumental setup and operation.

      <span>The analysis of cultural heritage samples continues to be a very popular topic. As with most years, the majority of the papers do not discuss the analytical experiments in any great detail, concentrating instead on the archaeological or historical aspects. These papers are therefore not discussed in this section. Instead, those papers that do go into greater detail will be discussed and others, that have some novelty, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> the use of chemometrics to discuss the provenance, manufacturing process, <span class="italic">etc.</span>, or those that show a good level of method validation, will be discussed in brief in tables. It is usual to want to preserve most of these samples. Therefore, techniques such as LIBS, LA and XRF that are either non-destructive or minimally destructive, proliferate.</span>
      
        
        <h3 id="sect2511"><span class="b_heading">5.1 Metallic artefacts of cultural heritage</span></h3>
        <span>A lengthy review containing 160 references of the <span class="italic">use of non-traditional heavy stable isotopes (e.g. Ag, Cu, Fe, Hg, Sb and Sn) in archaeological research</span> was made by Stephens <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit350"><sup><span class="sup_ref">350</span></sup></a> Although the stable isotopes of these analytes do not have any radioactive parents, their ratios may undergo limited fractionation from various causes. The review was split into numerous sections, including sections for each of the analytes. The paper reviewed the recent work (since 2010) for archaeological purposes and investigated whether or not they may be used for determining the geological provenance of materials such as bronze and glass. The conclusion from the literature was that, in general, they could not. The Cu and, to a lesser extent thus far, Ag was useful for determining the type of ore (supergene or hypogene) the material had been made from though. Applications as well as future developments were discussed.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">Dechlorination is a method of stabilizing archaeological iron artefacts. Reguer <span class="italic">et al.</span> investigated the use of <span class="italic">XANES as a technique for the analysis of Cl K-edge during the dechlorination treatment</span> of wrought iron bars raised from Roman shipwrecks.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit351"><sup><span class="sup_ref">351</span></sup></a> The paper presented new results but also gave a summary of the work undertaken using X-ray absorption spectroscopy over the last 10 years. The historical work has aimed to decipher the corrosion patterns of Cl ions in iron artefacts and also to understand the dechlorination process. Samples complete with corrosion products were subject to dechlorination in either aerated solution (five samples) or de-aerated solution (two samples). In both cases, the solution was 0.5 M NaOH. The dechlorination process was stopped for some samples so that the dechlorination front could be located. Samples were dried at 50 °C for 10 min using a heat gun prior to analysis. As well as XANES, XRF and EXAFS were also performed. The XANES enabled the chemical form of the Cl, its distribution and its role in each phase’s stability to be determined. The Cl ions maybe trapped inside the structure of the iron oxyhydroxide as akageneite (beta FeO<small><sub>1−<span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>(OH)<small><sub>(1+<span class="italic">x</span>)</sub></small>Cl<small><sub><span class="italic">x</span></sub></small>) and beta or gamma-ferrous hydroxychlorides, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> beta-Fe<small><sub>2</sub></small>(OH)<small><sub>3</sub></small>Cl. Some may also be adsorbed to the surface of the grains of the various phases present. It was concluded that XANES was very suitable for the task.</p>

        <h3 id="sect2647"><span class="b_heading">5.2 Cultural heritage samples of organic origin</span></h3>
        <span>Several <span class="italic">reviews or overviews of the analysis or restoration of artworks</span> have been produced during this review period. Included in this number is one by Borg <span class="italic">et al.</span> who reviewed (with 131 references) the application of state of the art technologies to support artwork conservation.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit365"><sup><span class="sup_ref">365</span></sup></a> Some of the technologies discussed were: XRF, holographic interferometry, Raman spectroscopy, thermal quasi-reflectography, FT-IR and terahertz imaging. The techniques allow analysis of the paintings, statues and murals, providing information about the pigments, restoration history and media constituents. The review was conveniently split into sections covering each of the techniques, so any reader could simply read the section applicable to them. Another paper, by Dudeja, containing 18 references, gave an overview of laser technology for analysis, cleaning and restoration of artworks.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit366"><sup><span class="sup_ref">366</span></sup></a> Although by no means a comprehensive review, it did highlight the use of techniques such as LIBS, micro-Raman spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, LIF, <span class="italic">etc.</span> and would, perhaps, be a useful read for anybody interested in the area.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">
          <span class="italic">Macro-XRF is a very useful technique for the analysis of artworks</span> and other historical artefacts and is employed almost routinely by many workers. This is because it can give valuable information on pigments but also, because of the penetrative nature of X-rays, it can give information on layers beneath the surface. It can therefore potentially identify pictures that have been painted over. The development and application of a highly mobile and versatile macro-XRF scanner for the <span class="italic">in situ</span> analysis of painted works of art was reported by Pouyet <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit367"><sup><span class="sup_ref">367</span></sup></a> The system enabled the real-time elemental mapping of large painted surfaces. This was facilitated by the system having an XRF head that was capable of moving 84 × 84 × 20 cm in the <span class="italic">X</span>, <span class="italic">Y</span> and <span class="italic">Z</span> directions, respectively. The technical details of the scanner were described in detail in the paper. Briefly, the X-ray beam size was adaptable and the detection system comprised a 50 mm<small><sup>2</sup></small> active area coupled to a CUBE preamplifier and DANTE digital pulse processor. The system was controlled using a custom software including a graphical user interface that had been programmed in Python. Detection limits for K-lines of elements with an atomic number of &lt;50 were typically at the 10s of mg kg<small><sup>−1</sup></small>, but this increased rapidly at higher <span class="italic">z</span>. For these higher <span class="italic">z</span> elements, L-lines were required. The authors applied it to the successful analysis of paintings.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Another paper to have utilised <span class="italic">macro-XRF was presented by Watteeuw et al. who combined it with multi-light reflectance imaging</span> to study medieval illuminated manuscripts.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit368"><sup><span class="sup_ref">368</span></sup></a> The combination of the complementary techniques enabled the analysis of the pigments to be made in an advantageous way compared with normal analysis. Comparing and combining the macro-XRF data and the reference datasets for the multi-light reflectance imaging, enabled the ink and paint layer compositions to be characterised. The genuine 13<small><sup>th</sup></small> century materials and the areas that had been retouched in the 19th century could clearly be distinguished. This is just one example of the numerous papers that have employed complementary techniques for the analysis of materials in an attempt to glean as much information as possible. This use of complementary techniques is probably used most in the analysis of artworks.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A third paper to report the use of macro-XRF for the analysis of pigments was presented by Orsilli <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit369"><sup><span class="sup_ref">369</span></sup></a> These authors combined <span class="italic">macro-XRF with Statistically Tailored Elemental Angle Mapper for the analysis of a painting</span> by Giotto. The paper is partially an overview (with 54 references) that discussed the relative merits and limitations of using macro-XRF. The data handling aspect is based on the spectral angle mapper algorithm and on global spectrum analysis. It first maps the elemental distribution and then, in synergy with XRF data at set points, it exploits the information gathered from the mapped area(s) as a database to extend the comprehension to data outside the scanned region(s). The methodology was explained fully in the text of the paper.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper by Lazic <span class="italic">et al.</span> discussed the <span class="italic">pitfalls associated with LIBS depth-profiling of painted layers</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit370"><sup><span class="sup_ref">370</span></sup></a> Simply taking into account the line intensities or applying a single normalization approach based on the analyte line and a matrix reference line, <span class="italic">e.g.</span> Ca, led to misleading results. This was attributed to the crater formation and different overlaid materials affecting the plasma dynamics and hence, sensitivity. The authors set about picking Cu and Ca atom lines that were less affected by variations of the plasma temperature and that had a similar energy gap between ground and excited state. Each analyte therefore had its own reference Ca line. A total of 20 analytes were determined per laser pulse. In this way it was possible to detect thin over-painted layers of similar colour and to recognise the painting technique used. In some instances, it was even possible to establish geographical origin of the materials used.</p>

        <h3 id="sect2771"><span class="b_heading">5.3 Ceramic objects of cultural heritage</span></h3>
        <span>The analysis of ceramic objects is always a popular area of research in cultural heritage studies. A paper by Niedzielski <span class="italic">et al.</span> evaluated the <span class="italic">effects of sample processing on the XRF results from archaeological pottery</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit381"><sup><span class="sup_ref">381</span></sup></a> A total of 41 samples of pottery from the late bronze age/early iron age were used in the study. Of these, some were hand made and others had been wheel-thrown pottery. All had been collected from western Andalusia, Spain. The results from intact samples had significantly higher levels of Al, Ca, Co, Fe, K, Nb, S, Sb, Si, Sn and Sr compared with pulverised ones. Cluster analysis and PCA were used with the datasets. Cluster analysis failed to identify any clusters. However, PCA identified two outlying samples in the intact (<span class="italic">i.e.</span> non-destructively prepared) samples; indicating that they had a different chemical composition. Analysis of the same samples that had been pulverised did not make that distinction. The clear conclusion was that grinding the sample loses vital information (as well as destroying part of the sample).</span>
        <p class="otherpara">The use of LIBS has become popular in cultural heritage studies because it is quick, cheap and quasi-non-destructive. It does, however, suffer from problems associated with calibration and the production of huge amounts of information that can require powerful computing capacity. Some researchers therefore use statistical techniques to help remove redundant or insignificant data, thereby improving the efficiency of data interpretation. Such a paper has been produced by Ruan <span class="italic">et al.</span> who developed a <span class="italic">novel hybrid filter/wrapper method for feature selection for the LIBS analysis of archaeological ceramics</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit382"><sup><span class="sup_ref">382</span></sup></a> The method was based on the mutual information algorithm-based filter method (to remove redundant or insignificant data) and the bi-directional selection algorithm-based wrapper method (to obtain the optimal feature subset with good productive performance). The method was implemented through a random forest-based non-linear multivariate classification method. A total of 35 archaeological ceramics were analysed in the study. Prior to the use of the method, the LIBS spectra were treated using wavelet transform de-noising. The overall method was compared with other methodologies and was found to have superior performance in terms of classification ability.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">A study presented by Odelli <span class="italic">et al.</span> used portable XRF followed by data analysis using an assortment of chemometric methods to <span class="italic">classify the provenance of 73 transport amphorae</span>.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit383"><sup><span class="sup_ref">383</span></sup></a> These authors used PCA, cluster analysis and a method called graph clustering for the classification. The analysis took place on a fresh cut surface. Classification using the new method was by no means universally successful. A success rate of approximately 75% was achieved. However, the authors did note that the majority of failures were for samples that had coarse grained clay pastes, implying that the method is especially useful for fine-grained materials. Despite this obvious flaw, the method was rapid, easy and relatively non-destructive.</p>
        <p class="otherpara">Vannoorenberghe <span class="italic">et al.</span> used LA-ICP-MS for the analysis of the clay fraction of archaeological pottery samples with a view to elucidate provenance.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit384"><sup><span class="sup_ref">384</span></sup></a> Assorted different calibration strategies were tested on the reference material NIST 679 brick clay before being applied to the archaeological samples. These strategies were: external calibration with no internal standard, external calibration with Si as an internal standard, sum normalization approach with estimation of the Si concentration as internal standard and another sum normalization method. The calibration materials tested were a matrix matched clay and five glass reference materials. When no internal standard was used, the glass materials provided incorrect data. The matrix matched material did, however, produce reliable data. When the normalizations or the internal standard were used, either the glass materials or the matrix matched sample could be used for calibration. Once the method had been developed, it was applied to a series of Mesolithic and early Neolithic ceramic materials from the Scheldt valley. Data for 44 analytes from these analyses were treated using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). This was capable of classifying the different sediments used.</p>

        <h3 id="sect2897"><span class="b_heading">5.4 Glass samples of cultural heritage</span></h3>
        <span>This has been a relatively quiet area of research in this review period with only two papers of note to be discussed. One, by Comite <span class="italic">et al.</span>, used LA-ICP-MS, SEM-EDS, FTIR and XPS to <span class="italic">identify the degradation products that show up as iridescent black patinas or incrustations on Byzantine glasses</span> from Northern Tunisia.<a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit395"><sup><span class="sup_ref">395</span></sup></a> All of the analytical techniques were either non-destructive or, at worst, minimally destructive. The LA-ICP-MS was used to identify the chemical composition of the glass and the degradation products whereas the XPS was used to identify the elements present at the surface and their chemical state. The iridescent areas were found to be depleted in alkali and alkaline earth elements. The incrustations were a result of deposits of calcium carbonate or oxyhydroxides.</span>
        <p class="otherpara">A paper that critically compared the <span class="italic">performance of four non-invasive techniques for the differentiation of glass types in historical leaded windows</span> was presented by Cagno <span class="italic">et al.</span><a title="Select to navigate to references" href="#cit396"><sup><span class="sup_ref">396</span></sup></a> The techniques were: macro-XRF, UV–Vis-IR, Raman and IR thermography. All of the techniques could be used <span class="italic">in situ</span> but the macro-XRF was least portable. The non-quantitative nature of macro-XRF and its inability to measure low <span class="italic">z</span> elements such as Mg and Na meant that it was not ideal. However, it was capable of distinguishing two glass types based on their K content. It was also the technique that provided the most chemical information. The UV–Vis-IR broadly matched the macro-XRF findings. The Raman spectroscopy has had a good previous track record of historical glass analysis. However, in this case where colourless glass was analysed, there was very little fluorescence detected.</p>
